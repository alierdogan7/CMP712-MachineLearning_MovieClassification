00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,187
Okay, I'm going to ask you
to take a deep breath in.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

(EXHALES FORCEFULLY)

7
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,358
Should I do it again?

8
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,032
No, one is good.

WOMAN: <i>...upset about?
Apparently...</i>

10
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,535
...we had this fundraiser...

11
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,362
...and I brought cupcakes,
she brought cake pops.

12
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,531
And she's like,
"That's too similar."

13
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,534
I'm like,
"No, a cupcake is a cupcake.

14
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,935
A cake pop is cake
with a stick in it."

15

Cynthia? I'm going to ask you
to scooch down the table...

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,545
Mmm-hmm.
...and turn over, please.

17
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:53,081
We are grown women and we're
fighting about cake pops.

18
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,224
Let's get over it already!
But the real issue is...

19
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,657
...her daughter Alicia
is a very nice girl,

20
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,958
but not very smart,
whereas my daughter...

21
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,295
Hey, Eva.
Nice to see you.

22
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,405
Hey.
Come on up.

23
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,741
How's everything?

24
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:18,974
Great.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,583
Excuse me.

27
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,149
Where are you going?

28
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,516
To a party with Sarah and Will,

29
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,258
so they don't have to be alone.

30
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,620
Want to come?

31
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,163
Why?

32
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,598
Because you're leaving soon,
and I want to be with you.

33
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,337
I'm good, thanks.

34
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,168
Have fun.
Thanks, honey.

35
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,343
SARAH: <i>She's driving
us totally crazy.</i>

36
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,610
We can't find anything.

37
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,944
She puts things in
the weirdest places.

38
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,278
Like, if I leave my
bracelet in the kitchen,

39
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,513
she'll put it in
a kitchen drawer!

40
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,280
Why can't you just do it?

41
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,016
I always do it. I fired the gardener.
It's not fair.

42
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,193
We want to fire her,
and he won't do it.

43
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,521
It's not hard for you. Why
does it have to be fair?

44
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,793
You should do it because
it's hard for you.

45
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,127
Oh, please.

46
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,200
You're a grownup.
You can fire a maid.

47
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,859
That's the definition
of maturity?

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,862
Firing your friggin' maid?

49
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,540
Sarah, is this
color good on me?

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,145
You look good.
You look pretty.

51
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,712
WILL: That's good.
That's a nice look.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,713
Whose party is this, anyway?

53
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,650
He's a book editor and she's an
interior designer. They know everybody.

54
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,881
Maybe some single men are here.
No.

will you show me?

Show me who.

58

Come on, introduce me.
Stop looking. No.

lady from my gym. What is...

Okay, bye.
Bye.

62

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

incredible masseuse.

71

Wonderful.
Thank you very much.

72
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,697
Excuse me a second. I have,
I have to find a bathroom.

73
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,769
That was abrupt.

74
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,931
Oh, my goodness! Look at
those shoes and that outfit.

75
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,541
With the purse?
It looks so nice.

76
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,714
Thank you. I should
bring you everywhere.

77
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,280
I love your outfit, too. Oh.

78
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,812
So you're a masseuse?

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,112
I am, yeah.

80
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,375
Yeah?

81
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,719
And what is it you do?

82
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:38,945
I'm a poet.

83
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,885
Oh. And I'm a dreamer.

84
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,115
No, really.

85
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,618
You're really a poet?

86
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,786
I am.

87
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,462
You do it for a living?

88
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,291
I do.
Wow!

89
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,794
You do, I don't. You're
a poet, now I know it.

90
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,298
Good one.

91

Feel free to steal it. (LAUGHS)

92

Can I give that to you?
Thank you.

93

94
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,679

got a new client.

95

98

She's really nice and funny,
she's got great taste.

99
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,322
And very attractive.

100
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,416
I bet you think all the
women here are attractive.

101
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,818
Pretty much.

102
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,494
Hold this. There's not one man
at this party I'm attracted to.

103

How's it going?
How are you? Hi.

107
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,677
So, this is a nice party. Got all
the nice white balls hanging down.

108
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,539
Eva was just telling
me that there are

109
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,673
no men at the party
she's attracted to.

110
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,041
Okay.
(CHUCKLES)

111
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,110
I don't know why you would
make that announcement, but...

112
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,181
Is that unusual?

113
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,357
No, actually, it's not unusual.
No offense.

114
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,961
No, that's okay. There's no one
here I'm attracted to, either.

115
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,024
Yeah, it's kind of
an ugly crowd, really.

116
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,695
Jason, you have a kid
in college, right?

117
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,371
Two. Yeah.

118

I have one leaving in the fall.

119

I do, too!

120
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,371
That's all I have.
Me, too.

121
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,147
Come on. Your kids are supposed to go away.
That's healthy.

122
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,813
No. Shut up.

123
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,049

Do the guys get boners? No.

126

Haven't we been over this? Yes.

127
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,161
I get so nervous with massages.

128
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,228
I'm afraid I'm
going to get a boner.

129
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,160
You are? Absolutely. Absolutely.

130
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,493
Do they hit on you?

131
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,325
Okay, you're starting
to depress me.

132
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,738
No, they don't hit on me.
They don't get boners, either.

133
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,900
I do have one guy who has like a hundred
stairs going up to his house...

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,413
...and he never helps me
carry my massage table.

135
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,080
Did you ever ask him to?

136
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,181
She shouldn't have to!
No, I shouldn't have to!

137
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409

You littered, honey.

What did you say?

145
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,963
I said, pick up your trash.
You're not British.

Thank you.

149
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,080
Nice to see you.
You, too.

You can just put your table
clown there if you want.

Would you mind
taking your shoes off?

152

Not at all.

00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,632
Thank you.
And your socks, too.

That sounds good.
Thank you.

take my card to be polite.

I'm not polite.

at home, look around.

of fabulous, too.

00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,580
...let alone
create a child.

179
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,752
I know what you mean about your ex.
We had zero in common.

180
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,684
I don't know how lever had a
real conversation with him.

181
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,190
It's crazy, right?

182
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,129
I'd like to call you pretty
soon if it's all right.

183
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,597
My right shoulder
is still very tight.

184
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,523
You should ice it tonight.

185
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,525
And drink plenty of water.

186
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,860
It's important
to stay hydrated.

187
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:58,866
Of course. Hey, do you want some chervil?
I'm drowning in it.

188
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,200
Sure.

189
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,106
I'll just give
you what I've cut.

190
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,113
I don't have anything
to put it in, but...

191
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,782
Oh, that's ideal.
Thank you.

192
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,785
Lovely. Thank you.

193
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,784
Thank you so much.

194
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,053
What is chervil? She said
she was drowning in it.

195
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,382
(PRONOUNCING H) It's a herb.

196
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,794
A what? (DROPPING H) <i>An herb.</i>

197
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,224
How long have you known me?

198
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,228
I can't understand
a damn thing you say.

199
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,456
Oh, my God.

200
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,466
Everything in that house was gorgeous.
I wanted everything.

201
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,900
She has no cellulite!

202
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,163
How can that be?

203
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,165
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

204
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,399
Nothing.

205
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,739
Will told me some guy you met
at the party wants your number.

206
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,313
<i>Jason's friend, I think.</i>

207
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,986
That's so funny. We both said we
weren't attracted to each other.

208
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,578
I don't know what to do.
He's kind of fat.

209
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,580
He is?

210
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,917
He's got this big belly.

211
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,322
<i>Well, you've got
nothing to lose.</i>

212
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,860
No, but he does.
(LAUGHING)

213
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,102
Your light came on.
You got a patient.

214
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,997
<i>Better get a move on.</i>

215
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,860
What happens if you
never go out there?

216
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,772
Do they...
(IMITATES GUNSHOT)

217
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,832
Was that inappropriate?

218
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,134
Bye.

219
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,346
I'm sorry about this. I swear to
God I made a dinner reservation.

220
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,174
No, it's okay.
It's fine.

221
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,785
What about you?
What do you do?

222
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,016
I work at the American
Library of Cultural History.

223
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:25,456
The what? Exactly. It's kind
of a television library.

224
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,559
Do you watch a lot of TV?

225
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,462
No, it's television history.

226
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,192
What's on now, I have no clue.

227
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,863
I tried to watch one of those
<i>Housewives of Idiot Town...</i>

228
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:41,202
...but I got so depressed, I thought
I was going to jump off a building.

229
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,038
I know what you mean. I tried to
watch one with my daughter...

230
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,717
...and I could not believe
what I was watching!

231
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:52,821
No brains, and the fake
cheekbones and fake boobs.

232
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,556
Do you like fake boobs?

233
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,060
No. I like real boobs.

234
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,896
I have real boobs.

235
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,603
That's working out for us then.
(CHUCKLING)

236
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,240
How long have
you been divorced?

237
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,901
About four years.

238
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,574
Was it mutual?

239
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,406
Not really. No.

240
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,409
Can I have her number?

241
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,852
Of course.

242
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,921
Imagine the time
that would save.

243
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,680
We should all put
a sign on our necks

244
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,457
with what's wrong with us.
Get it all out there.

245
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,856
Good idea. What
would your sign say?

246
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,258
I don't know. I'm a slob.
I have ear hair.

247
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,763
There are things
to get rid of that.

248
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,437
Researched, taken care of.

249
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,540
So you're a slob, huh?

250
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,933
Not like a dirty hoarder slob.

251
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,106
What kind?

252
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,441
A normal disorganized one.

253
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,204
Does your daughter
live with you?

254
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,206
Half the time.

255
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:58,286
It aggravates her sometimes. She and
her mother are very, very neat.

256
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,955
As a matter of fact,
their favorite store...

257
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,456
...I don't know,
it's... it's the store

258
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,791
with all the empty
boxes and storage.

259
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,396
The Container Store?

260
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,294
Yes. The Container Store.

261
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:14,629
The store that sells crap you can put
your crap in so you can buy more crap.

262
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,567
I love that store!
I love crap.

263
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,472
So did my ex-wife, and she puts it in
lovely, flowery and expensive boxes.

264
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,307
You should know, they have things
in sort of manly designs there.

265
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,642
Manly designs?

266
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,480
Yeah, like browns,
and little cowboy designs.

267
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,980
Little cowboys.

268
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:36,248
I mean, come on. It's hard
to live with somebody,

269
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,484
don't you think?
People's habits are...

270
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,988
Okay, listen to this.
I like guacamole.

271
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,667
But I don't like the onions in
guacamole, so I take a chip...

272
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,994
...and swirl it
around and separate

273
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,928
the onions from
the guacamole...

274
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,001
...so I can eat it. Now,
that drove her bananas.

275
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,609
It sounds pretty harmless.

276
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,838
I thought so, but by the end of
our marriage, it made her gag.

277
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,777
That's not nice.

278
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,519
You have...

279
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,954
...lovely hands.

280
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,126
I thought, as a masseuse,
you'd have big,

281
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,450
muscular hands,
but they're very lovely.

282
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,452
Thank you.

283
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,624
You have nice hands, too.

284
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,027
Thank you.

285
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,027
Kind of like paddles.

286
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,193
(CHUCKLES)

287
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,802
(BACKGROUND MUSIC
VOLUME INCREASES)

288
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,870
Did they just turn
the music louder?

289
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,041
No, I think you just got older.

290
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,545
(LAUGHING)

291
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,308
Excuse me! Do you mind turning
down the music a little?

292
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,583
I'm old.

293
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,387
No, I'm sorry.

294
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:44,389
No, you're sorry I'm old or that
you won't turn the music down?

295
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,560
I'm not allowed to
change it, ma'am.

296
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,565
He's so nice!

297
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,894
I find I don't
like younger people.

298
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,193
Eh?

299
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,564
I'm sorry, I picked
the wrong restaurant.

300
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,243
I'm having a great time.
This is delicious.

301
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,907
I can't hear what
you're saying, but...

302
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,343
That's probably why you're
having a great time.

303
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,182
What is this, tomatoes?

304
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,254
Tomatoes?
It's watermelon.

305
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,084
That's croutons next to it.

306
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,354
Doesn't that
defeat the purpose?

307
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,429
It's nonfat yogurt, not ice cream.
You can put stuff on it.

308
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,527
That looks good, man.

309
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,437
What? What?

310
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,197
People tasting?

Put something in your bowl.

314
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,380
I know. Give me this.

315
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,887
They have to test the flavors,
there's millions of them.

Very Berry Sorbet, and...

317

Here's mine.

321
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,629
Right there.

322
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,234
She's beautiful.

323
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,803
You got any money?

324
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,732
I'm kidding.

I had such a good time.
That was really fun.

328
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,578
I thought so, too.

329
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,989
I'm not sure.

330
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,321
Okay.

331
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,494
I mean...

332
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,663
...I mean, maybe.

333
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,936
I understand.

334
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,169
It's just... I'm not sure.

335
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,841
I get it.
I'm not deaf.

336
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,142
I'm a little deaf in...

337
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,174
Thank you very much.

338
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,845
I like your paddles.

339
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,158
I like your ass.

342
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,454
Well, thank you.

343
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,031
Good night.

344
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,032
Hi!

345
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,475
Hi.
Hi.

346
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,902
How was it?

347
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,036
Fine.

348
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,549
I mean, if he hooks up with someone
else, I'll feel like an idiot.

349
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,377
So don't do it.

350
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,510
What are you talking about?

351
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,546
Nothing.

352
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,222
I can't decide if I should
sleep with Chris or not.

353
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,656
I don't want to do
something I'll regret...

354
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,389
...but I also really like him,
so I don't know what to do.

355
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,563
And you're a virgin?

356
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,498
Yeah.
Don't answer that!

357
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:48,075
Here's what I say. You can't live
in fear of making a mistake.

358
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,744
If you want to do it, do it.

359
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,909
Mom.
What?

360
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,582
Stay out of it.

361
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,580
Ellen, honey, she asked me.

362
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,080
She did?

363
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,686
Right, Chloe? No?

364
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,750
My bad.

365
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,420
Quiet.

366
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,591
EVA: <i>Ellen, I forgot to ask...</i>

367
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,288
...what happened
to Maddy Price?

368
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,599
She was so rude to
me the other day!

369
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,127
CHLOE: She had a threesome with
Sage Berger and Brendon Weiss...

370
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,539
she thinks she's Taylor Momsen.

371
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,030
ELLEN: Don't tell my mom!

372
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,874
She can tell me stuff.
You never do.

373
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,444
Wait a minute.
They had a threesome?

374
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,546
ELLEN: Forget it, Mom.

375
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,782
What is happening?

376
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,785
Is everybody doing it?

377
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,283
ELLEN: Mom, shut up!

378
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,213
Come out!

379
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,459
You look beautiful!

380
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,954
Look at you two.

381
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,393
Come on!

382
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
We're not buying
the same dress, Mom!

383
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,059
We won't wear it
at the same time.

384
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,061
But you look stupid.

385
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,229
I think I look good.

386
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,397
You're so lumpy!

387
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,103
I'd wear that if I could.

388
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,405
Thank you.

389
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,637
No, you wouldn't.
Mom, you look crazy.

390
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,983
You are not the only attractive
girl in this family, Chloe.

391
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,154
Why can't you dress like Ellen's mom?
She looks normal.

392
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,156
So what happened
with not-so-funny guy?

393
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,922
MARIANNE: It didn't work out.

394
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,596
Oh.
No, it's fine.

395
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,162
What about you?

396
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,335
Do you have a boyfriend?

397
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,510
I had a very good first
date over the weekend.

398
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,613
Oh, how nice!
What's he like?

399
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,012
Funny.

400
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,686
We really never
stopped talking.

401
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,857
It was like we were
old friends already.

402
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,119
Be careful with that, 'cause
it could kill the chemistry.

403
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,025
No, no.
In a good way.

404
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,699
Really. I mean, it was just...
it was very flirtatious.

405
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,335
I didn't find him
attractive at first,

406
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,805
because he's not handsome
in the typical way.

407
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,809
But, um...

408
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:05,212
...I don't know... now I
find him kind of... sexy.

409
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,525
(DOORBELL RINGS)

410
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,072
Hi.

411
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,742
Did I get the day wrong?

412
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,502
No. Why?

413
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,842
Because you're wearing pajamas?

414
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,416
It's just brunch. It's Sunday.
I like to be comfortable.

415
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,688
Oh, good. Okay.
Come on in.

416
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,251
I got us that.

417
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,421
I'll make us some mimosas.

418
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,755
This is nice.
Thank you.

419
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,095
You carry a purse?

420
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,870
No, that's my daughter Tess's.

421
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,766
It was outrageously expensive, but
it was her 18th birthday, so...

422
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,611
Oh, my God! Bagels!

423
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,614
I love bread.
I really love it.

424
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,287
So, what's she like?
Your daughter.

425
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,115
She's very sophisticated... as
you can tell by the pocketbook.

426
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,724
"Pocketbook".

427
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,129
She's smart, lovely and funny,
and she's moving to New York.

428
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,064
Very far away.

429
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,734
It is far.

430
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,611
She's going to Parsons
School of Design. Oh!

431
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,965
I'm very proud of her.

432
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,300
I bet. I would be.

433
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,939
But part of me thinks
that I shouldn't let her go.

434
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,000
She's 18 and this is
a great opportunity...

435
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,969
...but if something
happens to her...

436
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,907
...while she's in New York,
I will never forgive myself.

437
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,909
Come on. But I know
what you mean.

438
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,912
This going away
to college thing.

439
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,148
We just send them off? And not
know where they are all the time?

440
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,151
Aside from the fact
that I don't know

441
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,322
what my life will be
like when she's gone.

442
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,596
And Ellen doesn't
want her dad and me

443
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,497
to take her there.
We take her...

444
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,102
...to the airport here,
but don't fly with her.

445
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,861
That would kill me...
just put her on the plane?

446
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,637
Heartbreaking.

447
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,437
We're going to have
to develop hobbies.

448
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,011
I guess so.

449
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,510
I already have one,
'cause I knit.

450
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,184
So I'll just spend the rest of my
life knitting. That's my plan.

451
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,786
That's funny because...
actually, I weave.

452
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,012
Like baskets?

453
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,190
Yeah, I do it in the garage.
Really!

454
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,515
No.

455
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,183
(LAUGHS)

456
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,027
Why would you think I'd weave?

457
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,199
I thought you were...
I didn't want to insult you.

458
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,299
I'm kind of glad you don't weave.
Me, too.

459
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,031
I've been picturing what it's going
to be like for her not to be here.

460
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,642
Even though she's only here half
the time, it'll be very different.

461
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,177
I can see your penis.

462
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,904
My God!

463
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,472
Your pajama thing
is a little bit open.

464
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,816
Shit! I'm very sorry.

465
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,711
What did you think?

466
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,355
(STAMMERING) I think
you are very healthy.

467
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,549
Thank you.

468
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,884
Go change your pants.

471
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,891
What happened to you guys? Not
the details, just general...

472
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,898
We were... very different.

473
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,236
We never had sex.
Not my choice.

474
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,511
She just had no interest in it.

475
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,578
And I'm pretty sure
she had an affair.

476
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,203
Which was awful,

477
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,013
because it meant
that she did like sex,

478
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,913
she just didn't
like it with me.

479
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,175
You. Right.

480
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,252
She thought my job was stupid.

481
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,923
She thought I parented badly.
I thought she parented badly.

482
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,853
Why are you
wrecking my backyard?

483
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,193
You have a lot of weeds.

484
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,353
I thought this was all good.

00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,526
No.

486
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,097
We never had sex, either.
Not his choice.

487
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,272
We were pretty out of
sync in that department.

488
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:55,443
We were pretty out of sync with Ellen, too.
Oh, my God...

about how to parent.

What's the deal?

504
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,073
It has to do with my mother.

505
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,507
She had feet?

506
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,415
She had spectacular feet.

Here we go.

508
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,188
They were red and
yellow and green

swollen with veins.

Don't do that.

I have to. I've never
had a pedicure.

until this actual moment.

Stop it.

518
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,167
Two bags. Two bags
for the old bag.

519
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,341
I knew I shouldn't
have told you.

520
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,339
They're naked, right?

521
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,440
Yeah.

522
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,184
Are you ever attracted to them?

523
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,686
No.

524
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,013
I'm sure they're
attracted to you.

525
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,520

526
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,689

Sometimes, yeah.

00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,369
I can give you a massage
some time, if you want.

00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,870
I might like that.

530
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,877
I would definitely hit on you.

531
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,544
That might be okay.

532
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,377
Really?

533
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,887
Want a kiss?

534
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,719
Yeah.

535
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,019
You didn't actually open your
eyes at any point, did you?

536
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,597
No. No worries.

537
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,692
I kept my eyes closed.

538
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,103
I figured...

539
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,265
...if I couldn't see you,
you couldn't see me.

540
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,769
Oh, I saw you.

541
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,781
Oh, God.

542
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,113
I'm tired of being funny.

543
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,391
Me, too.

544
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,065
But you're not funny.

545
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,629
SARAH: I'm so excited for you.
He sounds great.

546
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,568
He is great. It was so cute...
he made a whole bruncheon.

547
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,139
Sweet.
Yeah, it was sweet.

548
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,308
Okay, good.

549
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,803
(WHISPERS)
We had such good sex.

550
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:18,904
(MOANS)

551
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,142
How fun.
I can't even imagine.

552
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,581
What do you think?

553
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,158
I liked how it was before. You're
going to give yourself a hernia.

554
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,285
Okay, you guys are done.
Thanks for your help.

555
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,987
Take your drawing
in the kitchen.

556
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,161
You can watch TV,
but no <i>Cleveland Show.</i>

557
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,493
KIDS: Please, Mom?

558
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,665
Okay.

559
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,674
Jeez. Way to
put your foot down.

560
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,604
I'm too tired to
be a good parent.

561
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,835
Maybe because you're
always moving furniture.

562
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,006
Hi, Cathy!
<i>Hola.</i>

563
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,852
You have no idea. Will
refused to fire her...

564
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:01,551
...so I let it go, hoping she'd get better.
But she got worse.

565
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,693
It was like she wanted to be fired.
She did such dumb stuff.

566
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,623
That is so interesting.

567
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:10,698
So I fired her. And she started crying.
Then I started crying.

568
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,527
Then we were hugging and...
I hired her back.

569
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,533
Of course you did.
You're nice.

570
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,897
Right? Some people would see
me as being compassionate

571
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,377
or soft-hearted.

572
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,967
Will thinks I'm a baby.

573
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,369
He wants me to fire her again
as a learning experience!

574
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,474
Jesus Christ!

575
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:27,673
That's our relationship.

576
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,877
Not your whole relationship.
Whatever.

577
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,643
He's a middle child who never got
enough fried chicken at dinner

578
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,178
and needs everything
to be fair.

579
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,251
Miss Sarah? Where should I put this?
It was in the bathroom.

580
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,487
Outside, with the
ping pong table.

581
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,992
Okay. No problem.

582
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,158
Jesus.

583
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,061
ALBERT: <i>Wow.</i>

584
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,730
I've never actually
seen wisdom teeth.

585
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:49,836
You do have a lot of fillings.

586
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,697
Are they the mercury kind?

587
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:53,831
The normal kind.

588
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,505
And a couple of crowns.

589
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,839
Yeah. Okay, your turn.

590
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,914
Well, I'd rather you didn't.

591
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,584
Well, I'd rather I did.

592
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,916
I'm going to get my glasses.

593
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,258
Come on. Open your mouth! No.

594
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,427
Open your mouth.
Make me.

595
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,194
Make me.

596
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,765
Open your mouth.
Okay.

597
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,562
Oh, my God!
You're missing a tooth?

598
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,935
You are!
Yes, I am.

599
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,198
Let me see.

600
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,276
You can't tell... it's way back there.
It doesn't matter.

601
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,713
I need some kind of
hideous bone graft.

602
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,114
It costs a lot of money
and I'm putting it off.

603
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,219
My grandma Dee Dee had that.

604
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,618
Your grandma Dee Dee.
Thank you for that. Thanks.

605
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,259
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

606
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:49,553
Oh, I'm so sorry!

607
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,297
It's okay. This is Ellen's best friend,
Chloe. This is my friend, Albert.

608
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,797
Hi.

609
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,908
Ellen didn't answer my texts.
I thought she was sleeping.

610
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,634
She's at her dad's, honey.
Is everything okay?

611
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,402
I thought we were
getting breakfast.

612
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,912
You hungry?

613
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:09,312
Let's see.
From 1975, Channel 4.

614
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,813
Well, what time?

615
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,148
Oh, come on.

616
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:13,979
Saturday morning.

617
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,660
<i>Woody Woodpecker, Pink Panther,
McDuff, the Talking Dog...</i>

618
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,353
...which I didn't
like but watched anyway,

619
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,766
<i>Monster Squad,
Land of the Lost,</i> then...

620
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,164
<i>...Big John, Little John</i>, which was
like the movie <i>Big</i>, but weirder.

621
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,827
That's incredible.

622
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,466
I thought I watched
a lot of TV!

623
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,097
I looked forward
to that lineup.

624
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:35,442
What, were you
neglected as a kid?

625
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,435
I was kind of
raised like a veal.

626
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,848
I was put in a dark room...

627
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,174
...fed and told
not to move.

628
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,690
Very relaxing.

629
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:55,787
(EXHALES)

630
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:01,392
CYNTHIA: ...and she's like, "I
might want to get another size",

631
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,532
but that's bullshit,
it is the right size.

632
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,469
She's petite, but very heavy
on top, so I got a medium!

633
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,974
But here's the thing,
I got it at Nordstrom Rack,

634
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,469
but I put it in
a Neiman Marcus box...

635
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,744
(ALARM BEEPING)

636
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,714
Oh, yeah, that's good.

637
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,051
Don't open the door.

638
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,891
Just pretend you
don't know I'm here...

639
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,062
...even though you
heard me lock my car.

640
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,228
Wow!

641
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,565
Amazing.

642
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,737
So what do you
do with all this?

643
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,567
Do you really want to hear this?
Yeah. I do. What?

644
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,837
I make sure things are
transferred to digital properly.

645
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,074
I make sure they' re logged in properly.
I write blurbs...

646
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,516
...so if anyone under 50 wants to
put down their phone and come in...

647
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,055
...and watch something original
and brilliant, they can find it.

648
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,516
Like what, for instance?

649
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:00,390
<i>The Sid Caesar show.
The Jack Benny show.</i>

650
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,027
<i>The Dean Martin show.</i>

651
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,222
So cool.
Yeah, it is.

652
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,891
I kind of love it.

653
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,902
On slow days...

654
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:13,370
...I can sit in my office and watch
episodes of <i>What's Happening!!</i>

655
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,566
No, you don't.

656
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,539
Well, if things...

657
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,746
This is my office.

658
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,252
That's Bob. Hey.

659
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,284
Did you ever see <i>Flipper?</i>
Of course I did.

660
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,289
Oh, God. It made me want a
dolphin as a pet so bad.

661
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,255
Really? That's
a lot of work.

662

663
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,297
What is that noise?
(MAN CRYING)

664
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,971
Somebody watching something.
It happens occasionally.

665
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:51,137
It's <i>Taxi.</i> The episode
where Alex's dog dies.

666

Buddy or Buster or something.

You hungry?
Starving.

668
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,176
Let's get lunch.

Right on time.

670
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,425
Hi, honey.
Hi, Dad.

671
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,420
So, Eva...

672
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,588
Tess. Tess, Eva.

673
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:11,590
Hi. Nice to meet you.

674
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:12,757
You, too.

675
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,170
Seriously?

676
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,203
They have great chili!

677
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,504
I love chili.

678
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,101
Have you ever been to Lilly's?

679
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,172
No.

680
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,511
It's so good.
It's around the corner.

681
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,116
Lilly's it is.

682
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,845
I'll be studying
fashion design.

683
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,713
You obviously have good taste.

684
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:36,847
Thank you.

685
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,295
Eva has a daughter your age going
to college in the fall also.

686
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,620
She's going to Sarah Lawrence.

687
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,363
She's interested in English and history.
She loves history!

688
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,365
I think she wants
to be a writer.

689
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,970
Sarah Lawrence is
not what it used to be.

690
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,207
I mean, I'm sure
it's still good.

691
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,213
It's just gone downhill a lot in the
last few years. Some of my, um...

I'm sure a lot of smart people
still go there. Oh, yeah.

694
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,484
I know. I'm just saying.

695
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,391
I think you should stay
home and go to school here.

696
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,497
At least you're
honest about it.

697
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:22,330
Mom acts like she's excited to be on
her own again, but I don't buy it.

698
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,902
Why don't we take it a little easy on Mom.
She's all right.

699
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,906
Don't judge till you
have kids of your own.

Except I'm not having any.

701
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,342
And why do you say that?

702
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,413
I want a career.

703
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,582
Anyway, I hate kids.

704
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,752
Really?

705
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,526
Right now we
have that in common.

706
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,759
TESS: Corey?

707
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:52,856
Listen, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

708
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,201
She's too young to
know what she wants.

709
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,764
Dad, I'm going to go
get a coffee, okay?

710
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,275
Bye. Thank you
for lunch.

711
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,603
So nice to meet you.
You, too.

712
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,639
Yeah. Great.

713
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,938
Bye!
Bye.

714
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,282
Be careful!

715
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,786
She has a lot of friends.

716
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,218
EVA: You think she
has threesomes?

717
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,215
What? Why would
you say that?

718
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,485
I know, but apparently, it's
what they're doing these days.

719
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,794
That's what I heard.

720
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,789
Oh, my God.

721
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,791
Right?

722
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,799
I'm afraid that
window's closed.

723
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,302
There was a window?

724
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,314
How was the daughter?

725
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,655
Kind of awful, actually.
A real snob.

726
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,657
That's too bad.

727
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,499
I wonder what your
roommate will be like?

728
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,501
Me, too.

729
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,931
You want me to
call her parents?

730
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,665
No, I don't.

731
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,672
You hungry, honey?

732
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,844
Not really.

733
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,673
What did you eat yesterday?

734
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,017
I don't know.

735
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,187
Well, think. Tell me.
I want to know what you ate.

736
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,524
Cereal...

737
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,194
...a banana...

738
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,357
Where'd you get the banana?
Mom, you're crazy!

739
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,692
What?

740
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,698
What'd you have for lunch?

741
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,028
Okay, bye.

742
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,036
Where are you going?

743
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,180
I mean, he's kind of flabby and
middle-aged, but I don't care.

744
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,550
I'm flabby and
middle-aged.

745
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,388
It's funny, because our
middle-agedness is...

746
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,160
...comforting, and sexy to me.

747
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,391
Isn't that so incredibly sad?
But sort of good, too.

748
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:10,400
Yeah. I think that my ex, all he
wanted was for me to accept...

749
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,236
...his belly and
all his quirks.

750
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,902
In the end, I was completely
repulsed by him sexually.

751
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,572
Kind of terrible in bed
and just very clumsy.

752
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,574
Oh, no.

753
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,084
Just a sec.

754
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,393
Here. It's my last copy, but I
really want you to have it.

755
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,886
Wow! Are you sure?

756
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,230
Absolutely.
Oh, wow.

757
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,399
I'm a little intimidated. I'm
not really good with poetry.

758
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,866
Just let it wash over you.
Don't try to understand it.

759
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:47,600
I won't, believe me.
God, thank you so much!

760
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,372
I've loved our time together.
I know.

761
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,871
Do you think it would be weird
if we hung out as friends?

762
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,375
I would love that!
I would!

763
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,613
I want you to try this salsa,
'cause these tomatoes are amazing.

764
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,120
But careful! There's
a ton of onions.

765
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,292
One of the many
upsides to my divorce.

766
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:09,121
What do you mean? My ex hated
onions, so he would take a chip...

767
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:14,727
...and he would put it in the
salsa and tap, tap, tap...

768
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,661
...swirl, tap, tap, tap,
swirl, and so on,

769
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,463
until all the onions
were pushed...

770
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,410
...up against the side!

771
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,743
It kind of made me sick.

772
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,570
GIRL: Mom?

773
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,911
That's my daughter... she's not
feeling well. Be right back.

774
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,410
Hi, honey.
GIRL: Hi.

775
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,349
I don't feel good.

776
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,685
I feel... Right here.
Let me see.

777
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,187
They're swollen.

778
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,521
Listen, will you come meet my friend?
Just for a second, please?

779
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:43,924
Eva?

780
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,528
Eva?

781
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,861
That's so weird, she was just here.
Eva?

782
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,937
I'm going back to bed.

783
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,201
I love you. I love you, too.
You have bad breath.

784
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,040
I'm sick!

785
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,712
God!

786
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,784
Hi.

787
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,712
This planting I'm
admiring, it's so huge!

788
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:09,714
Thank you.

789
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:12,892
I wanted you to meet my
daughter Tess, but...

790
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,562
I have to go.

791
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:17,893
Okay!

792
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,401
Yeah. Okay.

793
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:22,898
Great!

794
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,634
All right.

795
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,800
So I'll call you and
we'll do something.

796
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,635
Wonderful.
Thank you so much!

797
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,902
It was so nice!

798
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,473
Thank you so much.

799
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:34,905
Have a great day.

800
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,908
Great, great, great!

801
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,251
MARIANNE: Bye-bye.

802
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,691
Are you okay?
I got it!

803
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,257
(EXHALES)

804
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,438
Do you believe that?
I am not shitting you!

805
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:02,439
Thai is an unbelievable coincidence.
What will you do?

806
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,701
I don't know!

807
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:07,712
Oh, shit! Your light went on.
Can you call me back, please?

808
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,006
Hi, Mom!

809
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,008
Hi! Did you take
your shoes off?

810
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,052
No. Since when
do I have to?

811
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:16,623
We're doing that now. It's cleaner.
And your socks, too.

812
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,793
You are not going
to believe this.

813
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:26,625
It turns out that the woman I've
been massaging is Albert's ex-wife.

814
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,727
Weird!
So weird.

815
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,635
I have been listening to her say the
worst things about the one guy...

816
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,467
...I started to really,
really like.

817
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:38,305
And I pictured the ex she was
talking about as this fat...

818
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,309
...irritating slob...

819
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,642
...and it turns
out it's Albert!

820
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,142
Fat Albert!

821
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,911
What? Who?

822
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,249
It's a cartoon. A cartoon!

823
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,486
But he's so not like that.

824
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:51,749
How do you know?

825
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,486
We had breakfast the other day.
He's sweet, funny.

826
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,595
Yeah, you liked him, right?

827
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,494
Totally.
Wait, what?

828
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,996
You weren't here.
We all had breakfast.

829
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,070
I haven't even met him.

830
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,604
Well, you will.

831
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,832
What did she say about him?
Oh, my God!

832
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:12,102
It's like this parade of horribles!
He's disgusting.

833
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,172
That he's like
this clown in bed.

834
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,840
Mom! Oh, my God!

835
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,286
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

836
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,014
I date sometimes. It's just
so hard to meet people.

837
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,256
And I'm not
attracted to anybody.

838
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,257
Really?
Really.

839
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:33,592
And you weren't attracted to your
ex-husband? That must have been difficult.

840
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:37,096
Well, I tried
really hard. I did.

841
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:42,601
But he would go on so many diets,
and then he would cheat...

842
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:46,279
...and then he would act
shocked when he got fatter.

843
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,440
...the behavior
around the weight.

844
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,640
Excuse me.

845
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,447
Are you Marianne Hope?

846
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,644
Yes.

847
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,121
Oh, my God!
I told you.

848
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,486
You are like our biggest idol.

849
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,284
This means so much to us.

850
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,794
She gave me a copy of <i>Beautiful
Fruit</i> when my mom died.

851
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,455
It saved me.

852
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,323
How wonderful.
I'm so sorry.

853
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,624
Oh, thank you.

854
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,634
Well, thanks very much.
Blessings.

855
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:11,829
Blessings.

856
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,131
Take care.
Blessings!

857
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,473
It's so cool
that you saved her.

858
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,647
But, he never got obese, right?

859
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:28,822
Well, it depends on your
definition of the word obese.

860
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:36,162
But initially,
um... you were...

861
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,863
...I don't know, you
liked him, more or less?

862
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,334
Unfortunately... less.

863
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,330
There were just so many things
that really got on my nerves.

864
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:47,874
Like what, though?

865
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,168
Sorry I'm being so negative.
I really am.

866
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:52,041
It's okay. It is.

867
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,509
It's just that I don't
really have anybody

868
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,845
I can bitch to
about things like this.

869
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:00,349
You can completely
bitch to me. Really.

870
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,521
Thank you.
Oh, sure.

871
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,190
I trust you.

872
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:05,725
Oh, good.

873
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,560
I do.

874
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:10,526
What's wrong with you? She
can find another masseuse.

875
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,523
I'm her friend. She doesn't
have any close friends.

876
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,025
I'm like it.

877
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:19,031
I feel so pulled in. She's
like a human Trip Advisor.

878
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,732
Albert is not a hotel.

879
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,740
But if you could avoid staying
in a bad one, wouldn't you?

880
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,236
Oh, my God.

881
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,240
She has said so many
bad things about him.

882
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,712
She's not perfect.

883
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,388
But she knows what she's talking about.
She's smart.

884
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:34,879
So are you.

885
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,922
Maybe she's ultimately right.

886
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:41,391
Are you right about Peter? You didn't
want him... does that make him unlovable?

887
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,059
By anyone normal.

888
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,896
You haven't said anything about
my furniture arrangement.

889
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,261
I don't remember
how it was before.

890
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,405
Hey! What do you think?

891
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,233
Oh, honey. Why do you
keep doing this?

892
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:56,912
She's filling a hole.

893
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:58,236
I'll fill your hole.

894
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:00,947
Different hole.

895
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,079
You're missing out.
Fun time!

896
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,615
Hi!

897
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,090
Whose car is this?

898
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,419
Tess is getting hers fixed.
This is a rental.

899
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:16,587
Sorry.

900
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:17,988
Why do you have it?

901
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,492
I'm letting her drive mine.
She likes it better.

902
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,802
Yeah, I bet she does.

903
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,634
You okay?
Yeah.

904
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:31,768
(ENGINE RATTLES)

905
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:32,770
What was that?

906
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,779
The gear skrinkle.

907
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,449
"Skrinkle?"

908
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:43,792
Why are you shaking that?

909
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:45,958
It spreads the butter around.

910
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,290
You put more butter on that?

911
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,966
No, I put regular butter. I asked for
butter. I didn't put more butter.

912
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh, I thought it
came with butter.

913
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,717
This actor, I saw him
in a restaurant.

914
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,320
He was about three
and a half feet tall.

915
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,486
You need to whisper, okay?

916
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,722
What is she wearing?
It looks like her aunt

917
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,160
crocheted something
to put over a plant.

918
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,387
Shh!

919
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:27,924
You got to whisper.

920
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,165
I am whispering.

921
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,329
I'm whispering.
No.

922
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,398
ALBERT: <i>I want to
ask you something.</i>

923
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,843
And I really want the truth.

924
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,676
Okay?

925
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,518
Can you breathe
when I'm on top of you?

926
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:48,380
Yeah!

927
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,384
I'm planning on losing some weight.
I know I need to.

928
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,193
Was it an issue with your ex-wife?
Oh, my God!

929
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:00,523
Sometimes I ate
just to drive her nuts.

930
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,525
(CHUCKLES)

931
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:05,469
(BREATHING LOUDLY)

932
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:07,907
You have a cold?

933
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,372
No. No, I...

934
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,371
I broke my nose a couple times.

935
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:17,550
My doctor says at this point,
my nose is purely ornamental.

936
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:18,876
(LAUGHS)

937
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:25,916
Will you get it fixed?

938
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:27,594
Yeah, after the missing tooth.

939
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:37,900
You know, I think
Tess really liked you.

940
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,732
I could tell.

941
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,405
She seems so neat.

942
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,903
She really is a great girl.

943
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:50,079
I know she can be obnoxious
sometimes, but...

944
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:54,620
...she's young. She's really got a
good heart. She'll figure it out.

945
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,295
I kind of adore you already.

946
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,476
So what about you and Chris?
What's going on?

947
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:19,942
What? What?

948
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:21,772
We did it.

949
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:22,940
Really?

950
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,118
How was it?

951
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,312
Nice. I think.

952
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,119
No, it was good.

953
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,450
Congratulations.
I'm happy it was nice.

954
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:35,829
Even if we don't stay together,
I'm glad I got it over with.

955
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,554
I'm glad I took your advice.
(DOOR OPENS)

956
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,298
Hey! Hi, honey.

957
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,491
When did you get here?

958
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,139
A couple of minutes ago.
Just waiting for you.

959
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:45,800
Look.

960
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,637
I've wanted to paint your
nails for like ten years.

961
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,206
I thought you
were too ticklish.

962
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,642
EVA: I know!

963
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,141
She's in love.

964
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,641
So I guess that
makes you not ticklish.

965
00:47:57,842 --> 00:47:59,651
You weren't here.
Come be with us.

966
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,687
Actually, I have some...

967
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,655
CHLOE: Come on, Ellen.
Come back.

968
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,019
MARIANNE: Crazy day.

969
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:12,832
I had a wonderful call from
Joni Mitchell this morning.

970
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:17,699
She read the galleys to my new collection
and loved them, so that was...

971
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:19,864
You're friends
with Joni Mitchell?

972
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:24,677
Yeah, we have been for a while.
Do you want some water?

973
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,203
No, thank you.

974
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,938
And I met a guy!
A really nice guy.

975
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,385
He takes really good care
of himself. He's vegan...

976
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:34,883
...and he actually read
my work before he met me.

977
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:38,353
A poetry-reading vegan.
Oh, my God!

978
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,355
MARIANNE: I hope it goes well.

979
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,925
I tend to get my hopes
up a little early.

980
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,363
I just don't want to
be disappointed again.

981
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,693
With Albert, there was
always this bait and switch.

982
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,438
When we first started
dating, I thought,

983
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:54,042
"Oh, he's mature.
He can buy a house."

984
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,572
This house?
Yes!

985
00:48:57,067 --> 00:49:00,071
But you should see where he lives now.
And he made...

986
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:05,377
...this dish of spaghetti
with eggplant and mozzarella.

987
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,382
Sounds kind of delicious.

988
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:09,922
But it turned out that
was all he could cook.

989
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,926
And he has no friends.
I mean, neither do I, but...

990
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,429
Well, me and Joni.

991
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,564
Yeah. That's true!
That's true, that's true.

992
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,073
Hi.

993
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,246
Hungry?
Yes.

994
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:40,085
Get ready for some
eggplant with mozzarella!

995
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:45,792
You okay?
Yeah.

996
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:54,926
Wow! This is
actually delicious!

997
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,932
Why do you sound surprised?

998
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:58,796
It's great.

999
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:00,864
How was work today?

1000
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:02,139
Good.

1001
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,870
I had two massages.

1002
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,105
Barnacles?

1003
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:08,110
Non-stop talking?
Boners?

1004
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:15,447
There was this nice woman
in Santa Monica.

1005
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:20,789
She talked a lot
about her ex-husband.

1006
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,468
I just hope it
wasn't my ex-wife.

1007
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:28,866
(COUGHING)

1008
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,636
I got you a little present.

1009
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,143
You did?

1010
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,376
Now, it's just
a little present.

1011
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,156
Oh, my God!

1012
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:52,825
I saw it and thought of you.

1013
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,654
This beautiful, wonderful...

1014
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,331
I can't do it,
but let me help you.

1015
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,000
Oh, my God.

1016
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,176
Thank you so much.

1017
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:13,504
Look.

1018
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,204
Do you like it on me?

1019
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,206
It's nice.

1020
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,011
Maybe I shouldn't have?
Is it too soon?

1021
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,583
No. It's just so nice.

1022
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:25,849
Thank you.

1023
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,089
Oh!

1024
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:33,699
What?
Nothing.

1025
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,428
You all right? Yeah. I don't
know what that was. Sorry.

1026
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,704
Let me get here.
You okay?

1027
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,703
(GIGGLING)

1028
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:50,550
Stop! Stop!
Your beard is so tickly.

1029
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:52,575
Sorry.

1030
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:53,577
That's okay.

1031
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,222
Okay, here I come again.
Oh, goodie.

1032
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,397
Oh, my hair!
My hair, my hair!

1033
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:10,138
I don't know what I'm doing, but this isn't
going very well, so let's just stop.

1034
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:01,612
What?

1035
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:03,956
You look cute in my robe.

1036
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,524
Is everything okay? You have
like four hundred mouthwashes.

1037
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,799
Yeah, I need to use them and...

1038
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:19,972
...then I buy them and then I forget
about them and then I buy more of them.

1039
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,533
And you have like 80
million toothbrushes.

1040
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,801
I do?

1041
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:27,214
I only use one of them.

1042
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:29,883
So why don't you throw
the other ones out?

1043
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:34,820
I don't know. Because...
they're my friends?

1044
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,495
Are you all right?

1045
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:58,176
You want to take
another shot at it?

1046
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:03,011
I'm just...
I'm kind of tired.

1047
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,009
Is that okay?
It's okay.

1048
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,359
FRAN: You looked
so pretty.

1049
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,927
Seriously, kiddo,
I'm proud of you.

1050
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,261
Thank you, Dad.

1051
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:23,726
We are so proud.

1052
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:26,367
We have some graduation
money for you.

1053
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,038
Thank you, Fran, Dad.

1054
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,769
It's in fives.

1055
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,213
Thank you for including me.

1056
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,111
You really have
a fight with your mom?

1057
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,216
Huge.
Where's your clad?

1058
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:41,045
He lives in San Diego, but
you'd think he was in Alaska.

1059
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,216
He never visits.

1060
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,120
But I don't care.

1061
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,727
He remarried this really weird
woman, and she never talks.

1062
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,795
Hear, hear for
second marriages!

1063
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,321
FRAN: It's kind of true.

1064
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:55,091
It's good when everyone
is older and wiser.

1065
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:56,093
Steady.

1066
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,570
And people have figured
out how to compromise.

1067
00:54:58,796 --> 00:54:59,797
Or behave.

1068
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,134
Thank you very much.
Nobody's talking about you.

1069
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,902
Don't take it personally.
I'm talking generally.

1070
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:09,311
If I got married again, I'd be on the
lookout for the inevitable problems.

1071
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,148
Odd conversation.
Pretty weird.

1072
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,912
Sorry, but maybe don't get
married a second time.

1073
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,988
I'm not saying I will.
I'm just saying.

1074
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,419
She's just saying.

1075
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,592
Fran, what was
your ex-husband like?

1076
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:26,422
Oh, he was actually a lovely, lovely man.
But not for me.

1077
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:27,766
Very grownup!

1078
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,660
He passed away.
Two years ago.

1079
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,928
Oh, I'm sorry.

1080
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:34,170
Could we get some
more bread, please?

1081
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,171
Please, no more bread.
Why not?

1082
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:37,794
I don't want to eat it.
Then don't.

1083
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,105
More bread, please.

1084
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,104
Are you going to eat it?

1085
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,941
I don't know,
but somebody else might.

1086
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,517
I probably will.
Me, too.

1087
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,276
Bread eater, bread eater.

1088
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,780
I'm sorry. So, Fran,
you eat bread, I see.

1089
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,356
It's true!

1090
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:55,028
So you get to keep
cookies in the house.

1091
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,355
I can.

1092
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,963
What are you talking about?

1093
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,533
It's not a big deal, but I have
trouble controlling myself...

1094
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:04,295
...so when Peter would
bring home things like...

1095
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:06,539
...chocolate or good
bread, yummy stuff,

1096
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,643
I'd eat all of it,
then hate myself.

1097
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,633
And me for bringing it home.

1098
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,045
So did you stop buying it?

1099
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,212
Yeah, I did.
And got so angry.

1100
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,372
I was not angry.
A little bit angry.

1101
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,740
WILL: Well, he should
have been angry.

1102
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,381
Why should he be deprived because
she can't control herself?

1103
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:23,386
Because she's his wife and
he's trying to help her?

1104
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,815
Yeah, but is that
really helping her?

1105
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,083
Yes!

1106
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:29,086
Not if we want her to
learn to control herself.

1107
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,320
"We?"

1108
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,556
I just said it's
not fair to him.

1109
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,667
Why does everything have to be fair?
What are you, six?

1110
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,169
Of course... What?
Let's keep it nice.

1111
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,898
I just forget the
cookies are there. So...

1112
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:44,502
EVA: That's why it's good you're
married to Peter and I'm not.

1113
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:47,179
That is absolutely
the God's honest truth.

1114
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:52,781
Ooh, it's cold out.

1115
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,113
Nobody ate the bread,
by the way.

1116
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:58,180
You did.

1117
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,524
Yeah, exactly.

1118
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,693
Exactly?

1119
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,192
Let me ask you a question.

1120
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:08,194
When people ask why we got
divorced, what do you say?

1121
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:11,200
I say I don't think you and I
should have been together.

1122
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:15,870
What about Fran? Did you
talk to her about us?

1123
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:20,204
Right. She's
your wife. Right.

1124
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,047
Yeah, okay.

1125
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,716
That was fun, huh?

1126
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:45,266
I started this blanket
when you were five.

1127
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,630
I don't know what I was
thinking about this color.

1128
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:50,077
I'm going to finish it,
so you can take it with you.

1129
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:52,747
I'll probably buy
another one, in case.

1130
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:55,439
What are you talking about?
This will be good.

1131
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:59,451

1132
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,287
(SIGHS) I don't know.

1133
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,285
I just pulled it out.

1134
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:08,618
I was trying to
remember what I knew.

1135
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:12,355
Did I already know those
things about your dad?

1136
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:14,802
I mean the things
we would fight about.

1137
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:20,965
Probably not.

1138
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,104
I think I did, actually.

1139
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,643
I think I always knew.

1140
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,811
Or felt them.

1141
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:29,815

here and cozy up with me.

Are you still seeing his wife?

1152
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:05,343
Well, she has a bad shoulder.
And she has no friends.

on it, Albert!

Oh, my God. Okay. Well, it is.

Yes, it is.
Okay, fine, good. Bye!

1165
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:42,922

have to talk to him anymore.

What happened?

1167
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,083
He thinks he should take
Tess to school, not me.

1168
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,428
Tess wants it to be me,
because she told me.

1169
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:53,031
But, I mean... Thank you. Can't
you both just take her?

1170
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,759
I don't think so.
No, I don't.

1171
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,471
He's such a wreck
about her going away.

1172
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,939
She doesn't need that
kind of energy right now.

1173
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:05,436
And he just focuses so much onto her.
She can feel it.

1174
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,875
Isn't that kind
of nice, though?

1175
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,782
I mean, that he focuses?

1176
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:16,117
Well, maybe if he had a girlfriend or
something so it would balance it out...

1177
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,222
...but I don't
see that happening.

1178
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,791
Really? Why not?

1179
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,393
Because he's a loser.

1180
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:23,820
Uh-oh.

1181
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,797
Such a mean word, but it fits.

1182
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,124
How does it fit?

1183
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,131
For instance-this
is typically Albert...

1184
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,303
...when we were
first going out,

1185
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,408
he had nothing next to his bed.

1186
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,405
No table, nothing.

1187
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,839
At first I thought,
"That's cute.

1188
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,141
It's kind of bohemian."
Stuff like that.

1189
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,815
So then we got
married and I went out

1190
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,419
and bought these really
lovely bedside tables.

1191
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,511
Then last year,
I saw all of his stuff

1192
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:50,079
was on the side
of the bed again.

1193
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,185
I mean, I took
the tables, granted,

1194
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,488
but he never went
out and replaced them.

1195
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:58,597
He's just content to just put
his shit on the floor again.

1196
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:02,827
Metaphorically speaking, he's not
building a life for himself.

1197
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,504
I mean, who would date
a person like that?

1198
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,963

01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,831
Exactly! You don't
need somebody else's!

1222
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:18,569
Will you please just say yes
and do this for me? Please?

1223
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,179
They had stars
and suns and moons.

1224
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,508
I know. I hate those.

1225
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,913
Why do women like things that look
like they belong to children?

1226
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:31,023
You know what I love? Dollhouse furniture.
I would eat it if I could.

1227
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,755
Sometimes I wish I was single, just
so I could have girlie sheets.

1228
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:36,088
You would love that.

1229
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:39,027
I have flowery sheets. They're not
all they're cracked up to be.

1230
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,428
I like your flowery sheets.

1231
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,431
Oh! Don't sell
me out, man.

1232
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:46,435
We're new. I'd like her sheets if
they had little Mussolinis on them.

1233
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,710
Talk to me when
you get night tables.

1234
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:52,278
He has normal sheets,
but no night tables.

1235
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,280
So I don't have night tables.

1236
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,606
Maybe it's a metaphor.

1237
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,548
Or maybe not!

1238
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,711
I don't know.

1239
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:04,290
I make a million compromises.
It just seems...

1240
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:07,449
...not having flowery
sheets is not a big deal.

1241
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,487
(SCRAPING CHIP IN BOWL)

1242
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,063
I know. I know you
make compromises.

1243
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,628
Really? What do
you think they are?

1244
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,062
This is not the time.

1245
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,597
Sometimes I wish
I was with somebody

1246
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:23,232
who was more
interested in history.

1247
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:24,906
What?
History.

1248
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,410
Okay.
I'm just saying.

1249
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,480
More guacamole?
Not for me.

1250
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:31,082
I'd love some, actually.

1251
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,310
You know how many calories
are in guacamole?

1252
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:35,416
Ten.

1253
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,750
Lay off the guy.
He likes guacamole.

1254
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,985
You know what?
We don't need the guac!

1255
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:43,996
I'll just stick
with the cheese.

1256
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,166
You know what I'm going to get you
as a present? A calorie book.

1257
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,660
Please don't.

1258
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:55,337
Yeah. A calorie book as
a gift is not so good.

1259
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:00,103
Eva tells me
you're a therapist.

1260
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,010
Tell us about your
weirdest patient.

1261
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:03,444
No, I can't She can't.

1262
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,348
Of course you can! You don't
have to name names, mate.

1263
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,612
You're so uptight
about confidentiality.

1264
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:10,847
Shouldn't she be?

1265
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,119
Well, you know.

1266
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,860
Okay. I have one patient who
picks his nose and eats it.

1267
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,529
Oh, man!

1268
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:19,790
In front of you?
Yes.

1269
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:20,957
Is he a child?

1270
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:22,535
Are you making this up?

1271
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:24,493
It is so gross and distracting.

1272
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:27,805
He does it in this way he thinks I
can't see, but it's so obvious.

1273
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,033
I won't say who it is,
but he is famous.

1274
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,802
Really famous.
He is not!

1275
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,378
I know who it is.
EVA: You do?

1276
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:34,979
No, you don't.
I absolutely do.

1277
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,310
Please, Sarah,
tell us! Please!

1278
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,884
Okay! That's it!
Shaw's over!

1279
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:43,488
I like being drunk. I really
think it's highly overrated.

1280
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,714
Underrated!

1281
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:45,982
You're shouting.

1282
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,559
I am? No, I'm not.

1283
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:48,851
You are. A little.

1284
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:49,853
Okay, I'm sorry.

1285
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,397
I don't want to wake
up the small people.

1286
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:53,723
I'm sorry.

1287
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,024
You want to know
something funny?

1288
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,402
This one here can't whisper.

1289
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,402
What?

1290
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,234
Will you do it right now?
Will you show them?

1291
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,673
I'm whispering.

1292
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,749
That was a whisper.

1293
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,953
Huh? What?
No, it's not.

1294
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,078
Can I?

1295
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:16,179
Yeah, that was a whisper.

1296
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,790
What about me?

1297
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,257
Yes, you can whisper.

1298
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:25,760
(IN NORMAL VOLUME)
This is whispering.

1299
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:36,108
No, it's not. That is
not a whisper at all.

1300
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,276
You're picking on him.
No, I'm not!

1301
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:39,775
You are.

1302
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,272
You kind of are.

1303
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:45,543
Okay, I'm sorry. I've just,
never in my entire life...

1304
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,278
...have I met anybody who
couldn't whisper at all.

1305
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,717
Whatever.

1306
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:56,387
No. You are not allowed to
complain about her anymore.

1307
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,122
Why the fuck is this
in the drawer? Cathy?

1308
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,299
Did you put this in the drawer?
No.

1309
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:02,662
Maybe one of the kids did.

1310
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,896
That could be.

1311
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,232
But I think you put
it there, 'cause I find

1312
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:08,467
weird stuff in these
drawers all the time.

1313
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,074
I clean the best I can.

1314
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:15,249
I'm just trying to understand
the thought process.

1315
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,313
You like the counters clean.

1316
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,813
Yeah, but not by shoving weird
shit in the wrong drawers.

1317
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,148
Does the ball
belong in the kitchen?

1318
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:26,416
That's enough.

1319
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,992
You know what,
Mrs. Sarah?

1320
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:30,185
I find your crap everywhere.

1321
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,466
You think I know
where to put it?

1322
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,823
You leave stuff
all over the house.

1323
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,162
You let your children
write on the walls.

1324
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,338
You floss your
teeth and leave it.

1325
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,266
You clean your own house.

1326
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,779
You people disgust me.
But you is nice, Mr. Will.

1327
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,008

Guys, my timing
might be a little off...

1332
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,198
...but I think I put
the ball in the drawer.

1333
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:12,633
Not funny.

1334
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,364

fun evening, was it?

God! Yikes!

1337
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:30,386
Why do you care if I don't
know how to whisper?

1338
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:32,549
What was that?

1339
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:34,993
I mean, that was embarrassing.

1340
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:40,224
I was just joking around.
That was complete... nothing.

me a calorie book?

buy you a calorie book.

actually liked me.

spend the night?

really want to go home. Is this okay?

...you would be so welcome to stay
in Ellen's room once she's gone.

You'd have to check with your
mom, but the room will be empty.

Really?
Oh, yeah.

1364
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,674

Thank you so much.

1365
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,509

but can I have my mom back?

Honey, we were just watching
something and passed out.

move into my room when I'm gone.

I'm sorry.

fault, sweetie.

You know, I guess I am...

a little bit more separate.

you know you're my baby.

Right, honey? Give Mommy a hug.
Will you sit with me?

and Fran gave you?

take up room. You'll use those.

chance to look at my book?

are beautiful!

01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:55,312
I mean, not that I understand
them, but I like them.

1392
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,489
Thank you. And I'm sure
you understand them.

1393
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,655
TESS: Mom!

1394
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:03,589
We're out here!

1395
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,158
Dad's in the car.
I forgot my phone.

1396
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:11,092
Good, because I finally get
to introduce you guys.

1397
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:12,333
This is Eva.

1398
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,600
Tess!

1399
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:15,832
Hi?

1400
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,771
You guys know each other?

1401
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,503
Uh, yeah, we know each other.

1402
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:21,946
This is Tess.

1403
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,014
Mom, she's dating Dad.

1404
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:28,452
What?
You didn't know that?

1405
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,952
You date Albert?

1406
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:38,894
I'm not sure what's going on right now.
Wait a minute.

1407
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:41,065
ALBERT: Hello! Marianne!

1408
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:45,565
Sorry to interrupt, but, Tess,
we really have to get going.

1409
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:48,898
Hi!

1410
01:12:49,232 --> 01:12:50,302
Hi.

1411
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:54,313
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

1412
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:57,474
She massages me.
We're friends.

1413
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,083
I thought

1414
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:02,583
You're friends with Marianne.

1415
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:07,087
I met you...

1416
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:11,095
...at a party and you
gave me your card...

1417
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,164
No, no. I gave
you my card.

1418
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:17,768
Yes. I think you
were at that same party.

1419
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:19,937
Yeah, I remember the party.

1420
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:21,600
And you met us both.

1421
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:27,841
So now you're her masseuse?

1422
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:29,276
Yeah!

1423
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:32,844
For how long?

1424
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:34,850
Ever since we all met.

1425
01:13:35,111 --> 01:13:36,784
EVA: Well, I didn't know...

1426
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:40,790
...who she was,
or who you... are, were.

1427
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:42,291
So...

1428
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,965
...you put it together
at some point, right?

1429
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,255
No.

1430
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,257
No?

1431
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,860
I'm sorry, at some
point, I, um...

1432
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:52,128
When?

1433
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,704
Well, I think...

1434
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,531
What?
When?

1435
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:57,471
When? Umm...

1436
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:04,407
Yeah.

1437
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:10,221
You got your phone?
Yeah.

1438
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,890
Okay, let's go.

1439
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:29,499
I'm so sorry.

1440
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:48,256
Are you okay?
Should I not be here?

1441
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:49,860
Probably not.

1442
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,763
Oh, I screwed up big time.
What happened?

1443
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:57,698
Oh, shit!

1444
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,697
Oh, that's my mom.

1445
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,043
Hi, Mom.

1446
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:09,947
I'm sorry, do you have a daughter?
'Cause this one's mine.

1447
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,445
Who do you think
you are, telling her

1448
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,713
she should have sex
with her boyfriend?

1449
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,213

All she needs...

1450
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:18,948

about the kitchen remodel.

1454
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:08,434
They talked to the guys in
Rome about the travertine.

1455
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:12,109
Apparently when they were lifting
it up, it snapped or something...

1456
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:27,052
Is your dad here?

1457
01:16:27,283 --> 01:16:28,728
He went to the market.

1458
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,129
Sorry to just
come over like this,

1459
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,632
but he hasn't been
returning my calls, so...

1460
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,134
I'll tell him you came by.

1461
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,303
What are you
gonna do with that?

1462
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:41,400
You want one?

1463
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,637
Oh, sure.

1464
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:58,147
(NERVOUSLY) Hi.

1465
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,320
You know how many
calories are in that?

1466
01:17:10,226 --> 01:17:11,728
I just want to talk.

1467
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:18,301
It really was
a coincidence. Okay?

1468
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,145
And I wanted it to stop.

1469
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:25,646
But she needed massages and we sort of...
Oh, thank you.

1470
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,816
We sort of became friends...

1471
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,489
...and I didn't
know what to do.

1472
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,654
She needed massages?

1473
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:41,324
You knew what to do.
You just didn't do it.

1474
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,835
Well, I was very torn.

1475
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,836
So while you were being torn...

1476
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:51,611
...she was poisoning
our relationship

1477
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:54,179
and poisoning your
perception of me.

1478
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,283
Why would you want that?

1479
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,854
I don't know.

1480
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:07,354
I mean...

1481
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:12,196
Except maybe I was trying to protect
myself, you know, because...

1482
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,693
...you know...

1483
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,863
...because we'd both been
married before, and...

1484
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,538
...you know how
things can turn out.

1485
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,140
What about us?
What about...

1486
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,046
...protecting us?

1487
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,816
I didn't protect us.

1488
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,719
And it didn't get
poisoned, Albert.

1489
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:43,554
I still really wanted us
to keep seeing each other.

1490
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,723
I wouldn't know how, you know?

1491

it is that you made me

look like an idiot in
front of my daughter.

01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,073
It really smells good in here!

1567
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:41,941
Yeah? I can't
smell it anymore.

1568
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:46,083
It's unbelievably delicious sound...
Sounding. Smelling.

1569
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:55,425
You excited?

1570
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,086
Oh, my God, beyond!

1571
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,422
You think she'll
look different?

1572
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:02,758
Yeah, maybe she grew
a beard or something.

1573
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,926
You know how it is
at Sarah Lawrence.

1574
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:08,663
No, she looks the same. I
Skyped with her yesterday.

1575
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:10,200
Actually, I think
she's gained weight.

1576
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:12,199
What time are
you picking her up?

1577
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,804
Not till two.

1578
01:26:14,036 --> 01:26:15,640
We're eating at
five... you should just

1579
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:17,375
come straight here
from the airport.

1580
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:21,381
Oh, let's use the fancy plates.

1581
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,383
But you say you
don't like them.

1582
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:25,522
I know. But it's
Thanksgiving...

1583
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,490
you're supposed to
use the ugly plates.

1584
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,158
Okay, I'll see you. Bye.

1585
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:38,234

(ALARM BEEPS)

1591
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:18,767
I don't always park
in front of your house.

1592
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:21,830

1593
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:25,842

by your house, too.

1594
01:28:27,002 --> 01:28:28,174

01:29:30,332 --> 01:29:31,868
'Cause I've built a cage.

1618
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:11,774
<i>I like your toothy smile</i>

1619
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:17,912
<i>It never fails to beguile</i>

1620
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:23,589
<i>Whichever way
the wind is blowing</i>

1621
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:28,952
<i>I like the way this is going</i>

1622

<i>I like to watch TV with you</i>

1623
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:39,163
<i>There's really nothing</i>

1624
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:41,767
<i>That I would rather do</i>

1625
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:45,710
<i>Then maybe we can go to bed</i>

1626
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:51,715
<i>And get up and do it all again</i>

1627
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:57,452
<i>I like the way your pants fit</i>

1628
01:32:00,148 --> 01:32:03,152
<i>And how you stand
and how you sit</i>

1629
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:08,793
<i>Whatever seeds
that you're sowing</i>

<i>None of it was made to last</i>

1633
01:32:30,812 --> 01:32:32,655
<i>It's not who you've known</i>

1634
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:35,152
<i>But who you're knowing</i>

1635
01:32:36,518 --> 01:32:39,590
<i>I like the way this is going</i>

1636
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:45,560
<i>I like the way this is going</i>
