Is it still warm?

9
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,674
I've got the sniffles this morning!

10
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,270
It must have been the dampness
on the boat.

11
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,313
I only have to set foot
on that boat...

12
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,234
Perhaps I'm allergic.

13
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,388
Even if the boat's not moving,
the dampness gets to me.

14
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,115
I don't know how you can
stay on it all night...

15
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,073

19
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,950
This is America
around the outside...

20
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,275
and this is an American car.

21
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,550
They say they're
going to buy one, too.

22
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,274
It's written here:
"We're buying one".

23
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,868
But I think they're joking...

24
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,115
because they cost a load of money.

25
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,518
But they say it's a rich country...

Excuse me, could you sign this?

181
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,317
Please, could you sign this?
(Clears Throat)

182
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,151
Would you make it unique, maestro?

183
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,590
Would you make it unique, maestro?

184
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,073
My name's Mario Ruoppolo.

185
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,594
Thank you.

186
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,989
- And my mail?
- There isn't any.

187
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,872
Come on, Mario, you should be happy.

188
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,274
Happy?

189
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,429
I told him quite clearly,
Mario Ruoppolo.

190
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,356
"Regards, Pablo Neruda."

191
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,232
It means nothing.

192
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,757
You don't think he can cross
it out and write it better...

193
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,758
so you can see it's for me,
that we're friends?

194
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,318
Do you think he'd cross it out
because you don't like it...

195
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,237
and write you another?

196
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,268
Perhaps he did it on purpose
because you bothered him.

197
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,995
No, I asked him.
He was staring at the mountain.

198
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,430
- Exactly, you see?
- No, I know the mountain...

199
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,755
but he was holding an onion.

200
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,839
So you think a poet can't think
when he's holding an onion, eh?

201
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,033
When am I supposed
to ask him, then...

202
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,789
if I can't ask him
when he's peeling an onion?

203
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,399
He's a busy man.

204
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,990
He can't be running after people
to make them happy.

205
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,394
Yes, but he's a communist.

206
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,317
So what?

207
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,274
Didn't you say that
communists love the people?

208
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,234
Mario, don't make me annoyed!

209
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,632
I bought a copy of the book.

210
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,831
When you have the chance...

211
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,349
with extreme tact...

212
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,994
ask him if he would sign it for me.

213
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,439
Sign it?

214
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,791
Take this one, then.
"Regards, Pablo Neruda."

215
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,434
No, this is yours.
He signed it for you.

216
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,516
- I'm happy to let you have it.
- No!

217
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,756

218
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,276
(Shouting, Chattering)

219
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,920
Mr Di Cosimo, shall
I empty all the water?

220
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,758
All of it, all of it.

221
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,799
'Morning.

222
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,393
Mr Di Cosimo...

223
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,399
what can I do to thank you?
Your wreath was the nicest.

224
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,274
Nothing, Donna Rosa.
Just vote and get others to vote.

225
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,392
Remember to use
that little pencil of yours.

226
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,751
And hopefully some
of your customers will, too.

227
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,035
"...happens that I go into the
tailors' shops and the movies...

228
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,832

229
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,191

(Bicycle Bell)

234
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,915
Mail.

235
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

236
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,153
What's the matter?

237
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,436
Don Pablo?

238
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,313
You're standing
as stiff as a post!

239
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,192
Nailed like a spear?

240
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,358
No, immobile like the castle
on a chess board.

241
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,232
Stiller than a porcelain cat.

242
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,274
Elementary Odes isn't
the only book I've written.

243
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,550
I've written much better.

244
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,389
It's unfair of you to shower me
with similes and metaphors.

245
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,955
Don Pablo?

246
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,318
Metaphors.

247
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,438
What are those?

248
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,673
Metaphors?

249
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,714
Metaphors are...
How can I explain?

250
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,957
When you talk of something,
comparing it to another.

251
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,358
Is it something...

252
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,391
you use in poetry?

253
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,559
Yes, that too.

254
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,231
For example?

255
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,112
For example...

256
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,152
when you say, "the sky weeps,"
what do you mean?

257
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,352
That it's raining.

258
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,272
Yes, very good.

259
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,632
- That's a metaphor.
- It's easy, then!

260
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,594
Why has it got such
a complicated name?

261
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,597
Man has no business...

262
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,513
with the simplicity
or complexity of things.

263
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,879
Excuse me, Don Pablo,
then I'll go.

264
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,675
I was reading
something yesterday:

265
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,316
"The smell of barber shops
makes me sob out loud."

266
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,552
Is that a metaphor, too?

267
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,715
No...

268
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,955
not exactly.

269
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,434
I liked it, too, when...

270
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,278
when you wrote:

271
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,795
"I am tired of being a man."

272
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,037
That's happened to me, too...

273
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,674
but I never knew how to say it.

274
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,360
I really liked it when I read it.

275
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,794
Why "the smell of
barber shops makes me sob"?

276
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,190
You see, Mario...

277
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,639
I can't tell you...

278
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,320
in words different
from those I've used.

279
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,359
When you explain it,
poetry becomes banal.

280
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,156
Better than any explanation...

281
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,398
is the experience of feelings
that poetry can reveal...

282
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,438
to a nature open enough
to understand it.

283
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,677
Will you open this, please?

284
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,911
- Who, me?
- Yes.

285
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,913
- Shall I open it?
- Yes!

286
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,592
My hands are dirty.

287
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,839
It's written in...

288
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,159
It's foreign.

289
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,798
Is it more important
than the others?

290
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,672
Yes, it's from Sweden.

291
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,035
What's so special about Sweden?

292
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,315
The Nobel Prize for Literature.

293
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,159
A prize, then?

294
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,033
If they give it to me,
I won't refuse.

295
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,069
Why?

296
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,789
How much money is it?

297
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,356
171,135 Swedish krona.

298
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,950
I've no idea, is that a lot?

299
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,038
Lots and lots!

300
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,116
Then you'll get it.

301
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,994
There are candidates with
a better chance than me this year.

302
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,035
Why?

303
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,157
Because they've
written important works.

304
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,874
No...

305
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,150
you'll get it, I'm sure.

306
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,474
Thank you.

307
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,955
Shall I open the other letters?

308
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,150
No, I'll read them later.

309
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,471
Are they love letters?

310
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,831
What a question!
Don't let Matilde hear you.

311
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,952
I'm sorry, Don Pablo.
I only meant...

312
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,472
I'd like to be a poet, too.

313
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,352
No, it's more original
being a postman.

314
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,153
You get to walk a lot
and don't get fat.

315
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,157
We poets are all fat.

316
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,358
Yes, but...

317
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,277
with poetry...

318
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,789
I could make women fall for me.

319
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,234
How...

320
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,149
How do you become a poet?

321
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,836
Try and walk slowly along
the shore as far as the bay...

322
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,833
and look around you.

323
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,474
And will they come to me,
these metaphors?

324
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,154
Certainly.

325
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,996
Don Pablo!

326
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,834
Mario, can you send someone to see
about this problem with the water?

327
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,518
Have you got water?

328
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,636
No, that's exactly the problem.

329
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,670
That's no problem at all!

330
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,756
Why? Is it normal?

331
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,154
It's normal.

332
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,669
You've run out of water...

333
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,313
up at the cistern.

334
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,273
Do you use a lot of water?

335
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,079
No, just what I need.

336
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,471
Then that's too much.

337
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,433
Because...

338
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,109
it runs out all of a sudden
because the water-supply ship...

339
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,360
comes only once a month,
so the water gets used up.

340
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,916
We've got... They've been saying
we'll get running water...

341
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,797
for ages.

342
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,036
"You'll have running water." But...

343
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,276
And you don't protest?

344
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,152
What do we say?

345
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,315
My father swears every so often...

346
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,510
but... only to himself.

347
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,519
There are people who, with a strong
will, manage to change things.

348
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,959
It's a pity.

349
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,196
This place is so beautiful!

350
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,313
Think so?

351
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,072
Yes. Sit down.

352
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,553
Here on the island, the sea...

353
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,238
so much sea.

354
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,157
It spills over from time to time.

355
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,238
It says yes, then no...

356
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,713
then no.

357
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,070
In blue, in foam, in a gallop...

358
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,555
it says no, then no.

359
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,752
It cannot be still.
My name is sea, it repeats...

360
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,350
striking a stone
but not convincing it.

361
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,075
Then with the seven green tongues
of seven green tigers...

362
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,111
of seven green seas...

363
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,549
it caresses it, kisses it, wets it...

364
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,911
and pounds on its chest,
repeating its own name.

365
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,719
Well?

366
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,717
What do you think?

367
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,551
It's weird.

368
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,432
What do you mean, weird?

369
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,519
- You're a severe critic.
- No, not your poem.

370
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,234
Weird...

371
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,515
Weird...

372
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,837
how I felt while
you were saying it.

373
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,757
How was that?

374
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,318
I don't know.

375
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,518
The words went back and forth.

376
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,598
- Like the sea, then?
- Exactly.

377
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,792
- Like the sea.
- There, that's the rhythm.

378
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,559
I felt seasick, in fact.

379
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,357
Because...

380
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,278
I can't explain it. I felt like...

381
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,949
like a boat tossing
around on those words.

382
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,993
Like a boat tossing
around on my words?

383
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,033
Do you know what you've done, Mario?

384
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,118
- No, what?
- You've invented a metaphor.

385
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,638
- Yes, you have!
- Really?

386
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,630
But it doesn't count
because I didn't mean to.

387
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,955
Meaning to is not important.

388
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,071
Images arise spontaneously.

389
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,514
You mean, then that...

390
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,108
for example,
I don't know if you follow me...

391
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,673
that the whole world...

392
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,799
the whole world,
with the sea, the sky...

393
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,717
with the rain, the clouds...

394
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,354
Now you can say etc., etc.

395
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,436
Etc., etc.

396
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,030
The whole world is
the metaphor for something else?

397
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,753
- I'm talking crap.
- No, not at all.

398
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,279
Not at all.

399
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,755
You pulled a strange face.

400
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,836
Mario, let's make a pact.

401
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,076
I'll have a nice swim...

402
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,873
and ponder your question.

403
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,072
Then I'll give you
an answer tomorrow.

404
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,794

- Yes, really.

Don Pablo, good morning.

412
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,756
I've got to talk to you.

413
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,190
It must be very important.
You're snorting like a horse.

414
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,958
It's very important.

415
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,429
- I've fallen in love.
- Nothing serious. There's a remedy.

416
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,198
No, no remedy!

417
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,270
I don't want a remedy.
I want to stay sick.

418
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,630
I'm in love,
really, really in love.

419
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,831
Who are you in love with?

420
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,511

00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,114
Don Pablo?

423
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,757
Dante Alighieri.

424
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,792
He fell for a certain Beatrice.

425
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,196
Beatrices have
inspired boundless love.

426
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,954
What are you doing?

427
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,548
Writing down the name Dante.

428
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,510
Dante I know, but Alighieri...

429
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,553
- Has it got an "h" in it?
- Wait, I'll write it for you.

430
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,954
Thank you.

431
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,236
I'm madly in love.

432
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,399
You've already told me that,
but what can I do about it?

433
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,876
I don't know, if you can help...

434
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,355
But I'm an old man.

435
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,357
I don't know, because...

436
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,392
I suddenly saw her in front of me.

437
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,638
I stared at her,
but I couldn't utter a word.

438
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,228
What, you didn't
say anything to her?

439
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,758
Not much.

440
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,870
- I watched her and fell in love.
- Just like that? In a flash?

441
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,192
No, I stared at her
for ten minutes first.

442
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,839
And she?

443
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,518
And she said...

444
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,789
What's up,
never seen a woman before?

445
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,918
What's your name?

446
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,199
Beatrice Russo.

447
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,071
(Inaudible)

448
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,154
And you?

449
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,197
I couldn't think of anything to say.

450
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,834
Nothing at all?

451
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,111
- You didn't say a word?
- Not exactly nothing.

452
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,877
I said five words to her.

453
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,319
Which were?

454
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,795
I said, "What's your name?"

455
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,034
- And she?
- And she: "Beatrice Russo".

456
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,757
"What's your name?" are three words.
And the other two?

457
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,115
Then I repeated Beatrice Russo.

458
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,353
Don Pablo, if...

459
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,431
I don't want to bother you, but...

460
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,472
can you write me
a poem for Beatrice?

461
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,956
I don't even know her!

462
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,590
A poet needs to know
the object of his inspiration!

463
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,792
I can't invent something
out of nothing.

464
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,990
I've got this little ball...

465
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,590
which Beatrice put in her mouth.
She's touched it.

466
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,153
So what?

467
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,430
It might help you.

468
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,312
Look, Poet...

469
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,557
if you make all this fuss
over one poem...

470
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,513
you're never going
to win that Nobel Prize!

471
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,670
Mario, pinch me and wake me
from this nightmare!

472
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,868
What am I supposed to do?

473
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,390
No one else can help me.
They're all fishermen here!

474
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,317
What am I supposed to do?

475
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,955
Fishermen fall in love, too!

476
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,675
They are able to talk
to the girls they love...

477
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,553
to make them fall in love, too,
and marry them.

478
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,351
- What does your father do?
- He's a fisherman. Naturally!

479
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,031
He must have spoken to your mother
to get her to marry him.

480
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,675
I don't think so.
He doesn't talk much.

481
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,676
Come on, give me my mail.

482
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,355

490
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,675
I saw this.
It looks important.

You're right, it is important.

but kept forgetting.

00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,797
- I'll put it here. Goodbye.
- Wait a minute.

who had come up from a coal mine.

520

He was a mask
of coal dust and sweat...

tell me they have managed to

00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,349
(Speaking Spanish)

537
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,232
(Neruda)... Mario...

538
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,673
...Ruoppolo...

539
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,557
(Inaudible)

540
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,832
I told them I'm here with
a friend who wishes to say hello.

541
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,635
And tell them something nice
about this beautiful country.

542
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,149
Yes.

543
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,751
- Good morning.
- No, in there.

544
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,836
Something nice about the island?

545
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,872
Yes, one of the wonders
of your island.

546
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,072
Beatrice Russo.

547
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,439
Now let's go to the inn...

548
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,393
and meet this famous
Beatrice Russo.

549
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,913
Are you joking?

550
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,679
No, I'm serious.

551
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,756
Let's have a look at this girlfriend.

552
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,074
Mamma mia!

553
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,033
Pablo Neruda and Mario Ruoppolo
at the inn.

554
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,434
She'll faint!

555
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,953
Well? What is it now?

556
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,431
Don Pablo, when I get married
to Beatrice Russo...

557
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,471
will you be my best man?

558
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,954
Listen...

559
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,436
first let's have a drink,
then we'll decide.

560
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,070
Gennarino, wait! I'm coming, too!

561
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,478
Domenico, come here
or I'll thrash you!

562
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,231
Look who's here. Neruda!

563
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,359
Good morning.

564
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,549
(# Soft Jazz)

565
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,359
What will it be?

566
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,032
A glass of red wine, please.

567
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,991
And the pinball king?

568
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,438
- Do you want red wine, too?
- Red wine, yes.

569
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,154
Two glasses of red wine
and a pen to write with.

570
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,231
He's here for your niece.

571
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,719
Give me the notebook.

572
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,512
Notebook? Why?

573
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,353
Thank you.

574
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,313
Thank you.

575
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,039
Just a moment.

576
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,189
"To Mario, my intimate friend
and comrade - Pablo Neruda"
