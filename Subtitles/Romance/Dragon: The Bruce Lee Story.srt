that's an appointment.

362
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,085

363
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,594

364
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,429

366
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,435
BRUCE:
Emotion can be the enemy.

367
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,359
If you give in to emotion,
you can lose yourself.

368
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,987
Be at one with your emotions,

369
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,111
because the body
always follows the mind.

370
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,364
This is not about winning.

371
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,945
This is about perfection.

372
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,411
Then why all
those colored belts?

373
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,457
The only thing belts are good
for is to hold your pants up.

374
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,792
Okay, let's spar, shall we?

375
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,714

376
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,296

377
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,433
(CHUCKLING) Linda and me, I guess.
Come, Linda.

378
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,634

379
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:26,927

380

00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,184
Mm-hmm.

382
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,566
Set?

383
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:38,898
You're open.

384
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,316
I saw it coming.

385
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,371
Uhh!
Yeah!

386
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,829
There you go. You see? It isn't
size or strength that matters.

387
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,708
It's focus. You all have
a chi, an inner spirit.

388
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,961
Focus and then there's nothing
you cannot bend to your will.

389
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,084

390
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,886

391
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,721

393
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,094

No, just you and me.

Why?

396
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,021

don't understand,

and they get afraid.

Teach them the beauty of that strange
thing and they're no longer afraid,

become part of them.
