1
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:58,216
What are they like, these girls?

2
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:03,192
They're very good. A bit wild.
Spend their money quickly. Work hard.

3
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:05,286
-Are they literate?
-Some of them.

4
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:08,396
ln and out of reformatories
from the day they were picked up.

5
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:10,866
Jobs like this. lt's degrading.

6
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,729
They shouldn't use human beings
to move earth.

7
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:14,736
No.

8
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:16,431
And it's not efficient.

9
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,600
lf they were to give me
two more excavators...

10
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:20,234
...l'd be a year ahead of the plan by now.

11
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:22,006
You're an impatient generation.

12
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:23,102
Weren't you?

13
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:25,114
Yes, we were. Very.

14
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:30,317
Don't be too impatient, Comrade Engineer,
we've come very far, very fast.

15
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:31,912
Yes, l know that, Comrade General.

16
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,550
Yes, but do you know what it cost?

17
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:38,594
There were children in those days
who lived off human flesh.

18
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:39,755
Did you know that?

19
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,570
What is your interest in this girl,
Comrade General?

20
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:54,469
She may be my brother's child.

21
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:56,241
-Yuri Andreyevich?
-Yes.

22
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,577
My half-brother, l should say.

23
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:02,151
lf she is...

24
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:05,019
...she's also Lara's child.

25
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,423
The Lara?

26
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:11,192
The Lara, yes.

27
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:17,530
This is a new edition of the ''Lara Poems.''

28
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:21,298
Yes, l know.
We admire your brother very much.

29
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes, everybody seems to, now.

30
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:28,605
Well, we couldn't admire him
when we weren't allowed to read him.

31
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:30,471
No.

32
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:47,492
Come in.

33
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:54,599
l sent for you, Comrade.

34
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,302
You're not in any trouble.

35
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:12,022
l'm General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago.

36
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:15,586
l'm looking for someone.

37
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,656
Do you understand?

38
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,302
The person l'm looking for
would be my niece.

39
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:30,939
Please sit down.

40
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,274
Your name is--

41
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,644
Tonya Komarova, Comrade General.

42
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:40,141
They found you in Mongolia, didn't they?

43
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:44,050
-Yes, Comrade General.
-What were you doing there?

44
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:45,646
l was lost, Comrade General.

45
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,714
How did you come to be lost?

46
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:49,550
l've forgotten.

47
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,891
Was Komarovsky your father's name?

48
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:53,987
l suppose so, Comrade General.

49
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,565
You suppose so?

50
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:57,434
lt's a common name.

51
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,469
Do you remember your father?

52
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:00,862
No.

53
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:04,036
Do you remember your mother?

54
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:07,110
Yes, l remember my mother.

55
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:08,902
What was her name?

56
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:10,806
''Mammy.''

57
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:15,075
What was she like?
l mean, what did she look like?

58
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:17,247
Big.

59
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,215
Big?

60
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,223
l was little. She looked big.

61
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:32,698
-Can you read?
-Yes.

62
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:38,131
''Lara. A Cycle of Poems, by Y.A. Zhivago.''

63
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:41,003
Not me. My half-brother.

64
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:45,409
The person l'm looking for...

65
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:48,777
...would be this man's daughter.

66
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:54,953
This would be her mother.

67
00:11:58,296 --> 00:11:59,422
''Lara.''

68
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,798
Did anybody ever call your mother Lara?

69
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:08,572
l don't know. l don't think so.

70
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,271
She's nice.

71
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:18,113
l'm not your niece, Comrade General.

72
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:20,651
Well, l'm nobody's idea of an uncle.

73
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:24,119
But if this man were my father,
l should want to know.

74
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:27,590
Did your mother ever tell you
your father was a poet?

75
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,786
Comrade General, my father wasn't a poet.

76
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,419
What was your father?

77
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:32,925
Not a poet.

78
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:39,466
Did you like your father?

79
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:41,232
l've forgotten.

80
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:43,433
But you liked your mother?

81
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,509
Yes, of course.

82
00:12:48,946 --> 00:12:52,382
Does the name ''Strelnikov''
mean anything to you? ''Strelnikov''?

83
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:56,815
''Varykino''?

84
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:59,649
That's a place, not a person.

85
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,023
''Gromeko''?

86
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,989
-Gromeko?
-Yes.

87
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:07,995
You see...

88
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,801
...he lost his mother...

89
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:13,399
...at about the same age you were...

90
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:17,539
...when your mother lost you.

91
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:22,808
And, in the same part of the world.

92
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,668
Now is life's artful triumph
of vanities destroyed...

93
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:58,032
...for the spirit has vanished
from its tabernacle...

94
00:14:58,242 --> 00:14:59,937
...its clay groweth black.

95
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:04,239
The vessel is shattered, voiceless,
emotionless, dead.

96
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:08,717
Committing which unto the grave,
let us beseech the Lord...

97
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:12,945
...that He will give her eternal rest.

98
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:22,884
Yuri?

99
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,891
You and your husband will dine with us,
Madame Gromeko.

100
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:58,359
Thank you, Father.

101
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:03,023
Will you lie down, then, Yuri?

102
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:08,232
Your mammy and l were great,
great friends, you know...

103
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:11,139
...so now we are going to look after you.

104
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:13,438
Thank you.

105
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:19,413
That's mother's.

106
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:21,084
lt's yours now.

107
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:23,050
Yes, Yuri. Mammy left it to you.

108
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:24,718
ln her will.

109
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:27,619
Do you know what a will is, old chap?

110
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,183
Money.

111
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:33,656
No, Yuri, just this.
Your daddy has all the money.

112
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:35,794
Can you play it?

113
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,632
l thought all the people in this part
of the world could play the balalaika.

114
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,865
You don't live here, do you?

115
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,338
No, we live in Moscow.

116
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:46,501
That's a long way from here,
but you will like Moscow.

117
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:48,905
-Won't he?
-ln a bit.

118
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:51,607
lt takes time
to get used to things, doesn't it?

119
00:17:51,816 --> 00:17:53,613
Mother could play it.

120
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:57,383
Well, your mother was an artist, Yuri.

121
00:17:57,855 --> 00:18:02,292
She could make this common
little instrument sound like two guitars.

122
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,423
Your mother had a gift.

123
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:06,325
Perhaps Yuri's got a gift.

124
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:07,828
Would you like lessons?

125
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:09,422
l can't play it.

126
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:16,603
Say good night to Yuri, Tonya.

127
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,669
He's your brother, now.

128
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:27,650
Good night, Yuri.

129
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:29,709
Good night, old chap.

130
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,048
Good night.

131
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:47,056
The Gromekos dldn't know
what to make of hlm.

132
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:51,967
He made hls reputatlon as a poet
whlle he was studylng to be a doctor.

133
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:55,562
He sald that poetry was no more
of a vocatlon than good health.

134
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:58,038
What he needed was a job.

135
00:19:58,275 --> 00:19:59,264
Pretty?

136
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:01,066
Very.

137
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:08,577
Yeah. lt's their right to be pretty.

138
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,620
What will you do next year, Zhivago?

139
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,555
l thought of doing general practice.

140
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,718
Think about doing pure research.

141
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:19,361
lt's exciting, important, tender, beautiful.

142
00:20:19,864 --> 00:20:21,058
General practice.

143
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:23,632
Life. He wants to see life. Well....

144
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:27,737
You'll find that pretty creatures
do ugly things to people.

145
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:06,634
What's your name?

146
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,072
Antipov.

147
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:10,163
Address?

148
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,731
15 Patrofka.

149
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:13,034
l'll have these.

150
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,670
We have permission
from the chief of police.

151
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:18,477
-Well, you claim them at the station.
-When?

152
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,744
Now if you like.

153
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:22,079
Very well.

154
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:24,352
He's my brother.

155
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:29,125
Well, take him home, Miss.
Before he gets into trouble.

156
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:37,166
Pasha, please!

157
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:38,895
lt's got to be done.

158
00:22:39,036 --> 00:22:40,799
Pasha, why has it got to be done?

159
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,964
For them. For the Revolution.

160
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:46,708
-Pasha, they don't want a revolution.
-Yes, they do.

161
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,711
They don't know it yet,
but that's what they want.

162
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:50,440
Give me some of those, Comrade.

163
00:22:52,449 --> 00:22:55,543
Pasha, are you a Bolshevik?

164
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:59,086
No. The Bolsheviks don't like me.
And l don't like them.

165
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:01,319
They don't know right from wrong.

166
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:04,394
Pasha Antipov, you're an awful prig.

167
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:12,728
Why did you tell him l was your brother?

168
00:23:13,404 --> 00:23:15,736
Well, what else could l have told him?

169
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,501
You could have told him l was your fiance.

170
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:20,937
Pasha, don't be silly. l'm--

171
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:29,176
Monsieur Komarovsky has come to see
my mother on business.

172
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:32,588
People gossip around here.

173
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,180
lt's the system, Lara.

174
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:36,849
People will be different
after the Revolution.

175
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:40,156
Will you come?

176
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,595
No, Pasha.

177
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,259
l've got exams to take, Pasha.
l've got to get my scholarship.

178
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:13,894
Hello, Auntie.

179
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:16,561
There's a letter for you.

180
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,167
From Paris.

181
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,794
Lovely writing.

182
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:23,464
She's coming home next month.

183
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,202
Tonya? Oh, that's good!

184
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:37,450
He does seem to be very well informed.

185
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:40,051
And such a handsome figure of--

186
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:42,854
Good evening, Mama. Madame.

187
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:44,324
Larissa.

188
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:47,961
You can work in there, dear.
Monsieur Komarovsky's here.

189
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:09,441
Good evening, Larissa.

190
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:11,820
Good evening, Monsieur.

191
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:19,992
He advises some very important people.

192
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:21,326
Yes, l know.

193
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:23,457
l believe he has government connections.

194
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:25,195
l don't know, l'm sure.

195
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:27,960
lsn't he very expensive?

196
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:32,100
Monsieur Komarovsky advises me
out of kindness, Baroness.

197
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,207
He was a friend of my late husband.

198
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:35,643
Oh, l see.

199
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:36,906
Allow me.

200
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:09,071
Tuesday, if l can, my dear. Goodbye.

201
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,488
Where did you get this?

202
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:30,692
A friend gave it to me,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

203
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:32,962
You're not to go
to this peaceful demonstration.

204
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:33,695
No, Monsieur.

205
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,000
lt may not be as peaceful as they think.

206
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,641
That's all l have to say.
Tell your friend that she's a silly creature.

207
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:42,375
Yes, Monsieur.

208
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:55,114
How old are you now?

209
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,784
Seventeen, Monsieur.

210
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:14,660
A hundred and three.

211
00:28:14,771 --> 00:28:17,638
Oh, dear.
And l was so looking forward to it.

212
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:21,637
Oh, never mind. l'll be all right here.

213
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,912
You will take Lara, won't you,
Victor Yppolitovich?

214
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:27,916
lt is so stupid of me!
lt's her first long gown.

215
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:33,513
l think you'd better call it right off.

216
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,023
Yes. l'll stay with you.

217
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:38,186
Nonsense! l'll be perfectly all right.
l've got a book.

218
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:40,787
lt's so disappointing for her,
Victor Yppolitovich.

219
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:44,459
There's so little opportunity
to mix with good society.

220
00:28:46,203 --> 00:28:48,194
Very well. Get your coat.

221
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,398
We're late, if we're going.

222
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:53,238
l want to avoid Kropotkin Street.

223
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:34,777
''Brotherhood and freedom.''
Yuri, what splendid words.

224
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:38,951
''Justice, equality and bread.''

225
00:29:40,157 --> 00:29:41,988
Don't you think they're splendid?

226
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,151
Yes, l do.

227
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:45,422
''Brotherhood and freedom.''

228
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:49,056
Brotherhood and fiddlesticks!
You're frozen through.

229
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:52,425
You've no right, Annushka. lt isn't fair.

230
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:59,609
We'd given you up, Monsieur.

231
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:02,672
My niece. Coat, Lara.

232
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:08,975
Charmante.

233
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:10,647
Come, my dear.

234
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:39,845
How's the Foie de Veau, Gascoigne?

235
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,474
As always, Monsieur.

236
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:44,611
-All right. Not too much--
-Not too much mustard, Monsieur.

237
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:50,516
-Jambon Farcl en Crote.
-Oul, Mademolselle.

238
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:52,889
Wine, Monsieur?

239
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,663
A little light wine, yes.

240
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,631
Oul, Monsleur. Mademolselle.

241
00:30:57,768 --> 00:31:01,067
This place must be dreadfully expensive,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

242
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:03,866
lt is.

243
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:06,667
Why not ''Victor Yppolitovich''?

244
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:09,804
l can't.

245
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:39,569
Mother made this dress.

246
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,204
Very nice.

247
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,908
She's clever, isn't she?

248
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:46,979
Your mother? Yes. Fine little woman.

249
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:32,623
No doubt they'll sing in tune
after the Revolution.

250
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:36,919
Prepare!

251
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:00,740
Mount!

252
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,120
Tote sabers!

253
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:43,135
What, what?

254
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:44,606
What?

255
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,578
-Good night, dear.
-Good night...

256
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,581
...Victor Yppolitovich.

257
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:38,197
Go inside your houses, please.

258
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:40,926
All these people will be taken care of.

259
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:42,928
Go inside, please.

260
00:37:43,273 --> 00:37:46,037
All these people will be taken care of.

261
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:47,900
Go inside, please.

262
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,578
Get inside.

263
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:01,416
Yuri, please. No trouble.

264
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:04,352
Take him inside, sir,
or l'll put him under arrest.

265
00:38:04,494 --> 00:38:08,328
Yuri, l beg you.
Tonya's coming home tomorrow.

266
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,951
Daddy!

267
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:46,789
There, now, that's enough.

268
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:49,859
Your mother, your mother.

269
00:39:52,702 --> 00:39:53,794
Mammy!

270
00:40:01,844 --> 00:40:03,573
Mammy, how are you?

271
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:07,178
Me? Fit as a fiddle.

272
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:09,517
Turn 'round.

273
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:15,119
Well, they've taught her something.

274
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:26,496
-Look at that!
-lsn't Yuri looking well, Tonya?

275
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,561
Yes. Well, let's get along, dear.

276
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,573
Yes. Run along, you two.

277
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:40,145
l brought you this. lt has a piece in it
about young Russian poets.

278
00:40:40,249 --> 00:40:42,911
Oh, good! Thank you.
Does it mention me?

279
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,050
lt begins with you. You're the best.

280
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:49,618
Very intelligent nation, the French.

281
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,760
They have their heads together.

282
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:53,955
Yes. They're looking at the paper.

283
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,225
They're head over heels--

284
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:57,891
Annushka, stop it!

285
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:01,793
Good marriages are made in Heaven,
or some such place.

286
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:13,410
Victor Yppolitovich?

287
00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:19,111
l want to talk to you.

288
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:22,048
No, Pasha.

289
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:23,682
lt's important.

290
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:26,619
All right.

291
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:38,565
How did you do it?

292
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,035
l didn't.

293
00:41:41,277 --> 00:41:42,608
A Dragoon did.

294
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:46,442
Oh, Pasha, darling!

295
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,381
Come, come.

296
00:41:51,587 --> 00:41:53,714
-Where's your mother?
-Asleep.

297
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:13,907
Pasha, l can't deal with this.

298
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:15,738
Have you got any iodine?

299
00:42:15,845 --> 00:42:17,574
-Yes, but--
-Get it.

300
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:32,125
Will it hurt?

301
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,159
Pasha, darling!

302
00:42:38,468 --> 00:42:41,335
Pasha, you must go to a hospital!

303
00:42:42,638 --> 00:42:44,902
l daren't for a day or two.

304
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:49,273
-Will you do something for me?
-Oh, yes. What?

305
00:42:50,947 --> 00:42:52,414
Hide this.

306
00:42:57,753 --> 00:42:59,448
Oh, throw it away!

307
00:42:59,555 --> 00:43:00,522
No.

308
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:04,016
There'll be no more
peaceful demonstrations.

309
00:43:04,594 --> 00:43:07,529
There were women and children, Lara,
and they rode them down.

310
00:43:08,197 --> 00:43:10,688
Starving women asking for bread.

311
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:14,826
On Tamskaya Avenue, the pigs
were eating and drinking and dancing!

312
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:16,733
Hide it for me.

313
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:22,606
Thanks, Comrade.

314
00:43:22,912 --> 00:43:25,437
Pasha, darling, l'm not your comrade.

315
00:43:25,548 --> 00:43:26,708
Lara?

316
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,815
-Yes?
-Who is there?

317
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:34,550
lt's only Pasha.

318
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:38,994
You came in very late last night, dear.

319
00:43:39,095 --> 00:43:41,256
The time went so quickly.

320
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:42,755
Good.

321
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,561
Are you going to church?

322
00:43:45,968 --> 00:43:46,992
Yes.

323
00:43:58,621 --> 00:44:01,818
You know what our Lord said
to the woman taken in adultery?

324
00:44:02,558 --> 00:44:03,820
Yes, Father.

325
00:44:04,127 --> 00:44:06,027
He said, ''Go and sin no more.''

326
00:44:06,095 --> 00:44:07,323
And, did she?

327
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:11,224
-l don't know, Father.
-Nobody does, child.

328
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:13,998
The flesh is not weak.

329
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:17,604
lt is strong. Only the sacrament
of marriage will contain it.

330
00:44:17,974 --> 00:44:19,202
Remember that.

331
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:49,363
Monsieur....

332
00:44:50,506 --> 00:44:54,465
lt's Number Six, this evening, sir.
The most important person here.

333
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:07,622
Sorry, l'm late.

334
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:10,592
l've been waiting nearly an hour, Victor.

335
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,291
Have you ordered?

336
00:45:13,129 --> 00:45:13,993
No.

337
00:45:14,096 --> 00:45:16,587
Well, you should have done.

338
00:45:38,888 --> 00:45:40,378
You chose it, Victor.

339
00:45:44,694 --> 00:45:46,821
You've grown up a lot, haven't you?

340
00:45:47,697 --> 00:45:48,686
Yes.

341
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:50,830
What did you tell your mama tonight?

342
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,265
Victor, don't!

343
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:56,404
-May l smoke?
-Yes, of course.

344
00:46:01,277 --> 00:46:04,440
You like it, don't you? Cigar smoke?

345
00:46:06,315 --> 00:46:07,782
Come along, my dear.

346
00:46:09,218 --> 00:46:10,446
Sant!

347
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:12,852
Sant!

348
00:46:17,026 --> 00:46:18,357
Drink, drink.

349
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:21,186
Up, up, up.

350
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:41,575
Where did you tell her
we were going, your mama?

351
00:46:43,085 --> 00:46:44,416
She didn't ask.

352
00:46:44,787 --> 00:46:46,948
-That's because she knows.
-No, she doesn't.

353
00:46:47,023 --> 00:46:49,548
You'd both take an oath she doesn't.
But she does.

354
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:51,422
And you both know she does.

355
00:46:51,594 --> 00:46:52,822
Victor, don't!

356
00:46:53,195 --> 00:46:54,059
What?

357
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:55,290
Torment me.

358
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:58,697
Torment? Oh, what a little hypocrite it is.

359
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:03,668
l'm going, now, Victor.

360
00:47:04,273 --> 00:47:05,934
Whatever you like, dear.

361
00:47:09,278 --> 00:47:11,712
You see, you'll always come back.

362
00:47:19,722 --> 00:47:21,019
Stay, darling.

363
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,422
Stay.

364
00:48:22,952 --> 00:48:25,284
Wake up! Here, take this.

365
00:48:25,488 --> 00:48:27,649
You show it to someone
if you lose your way.

366
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:31,022
Professor Boris Kurt. And, you find him.
Now, go on.

367
00:48:31,894 --> 00:48:33,156
Professor Boris Kurt.

368
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:51,438
But, Boris, this is genius.

369
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:55,139
Really, l thought it was Rachmaninoff?.
l'm going for a smoke.

370
00:49:05,728 --> 00:49:07,958
And how's the general practitioner?

371
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:09,927
A bit scared of his finals.

372
00:49:10,132 --> 00:49:12,123
Well, l don't think he need be.

373
00:49:12,368 --> 00:49:15,633
How do you like the idea of marrying
a general practitioner?

374
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:19,164
l like it very much.
But no general practitioner has asked me.

375
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:20,071
No?

376
00:49:20,576 --> 00:49:22,771
l thought you nomads were hot-blooded.

377
00:49:22,845 --> 00:49:24,904
A slow lot, these general practitioners.

378
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,505
How do you fancy
a professor of pathology?

379
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,740
Does he write poetry?

380
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:31,346
Alas, no.

381
00:49:31,787 --> 00:49:34,654
Then l'm afraid it's out of the question.
Excuse me.

382
00:49:45,201 --> 00:49:47,294
That's a marvelous girl, Zhivago.

383
00:49:48,204 --> 00:49:49,535
Yes, l'd noticed.

384
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:52,738
lt's for you.

385
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:14,725
How would the poet like to see
a bit of general practice?

386
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:22,201
Boris, thank God you've come.
This is very good of you, Boris.

387
00:50:22,271 --> 00:50:24,569
Yes, l know it is. My assistant.

388
00:50:24,673 --> 00:50:26,231
-How do you do?
-Where is she?

389
00:50:26,308 --> 00:50:27,468
This way.

390
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:44,018
When did she do it?

391
00:50:44,093 --> 00:50:46,186
About eight o'clock this evening.

392
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,599
Do you know what it was?

393
00:50:57,907 --> 00:50:59,704
Why didn't you get a local doctor?

394
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:01,902
-l couldn't.
-No, l suppose you couldn't.

395
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:03,069
Come on in.

396
00:51:05,114 --> 00:51:06,445
Turn her over.

397
00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:12,979
All right.

398
00:51:15,524 --> 00:51:16,456
Water.

399
00:51:32,074 --> 00:51:34,975
Now, Yuri. Come on, dear. Come on.

400
00:51:36,078 --> 00:51:37,340
Now, Yuri.

401
00:51:39,048 --> 00:51:40,310
Come on, dear.

402
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,274
Come on, Yuri.

403
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:43,375
Sorry.

404
00:51:44,887 --> 00:51:47,720
Well, my dear, that's it.

405
00:51:48,657 --> 00:51:50,181
That's it. Good.

406
00:51:50,326 --> 00:51:51,384
Good.

407
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:53,957
Good.

408
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,162
ls she going to live?

409
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,932
Water.

410
00:52:12,281 --> 00:52:14,408
-She is, isn't she?
-Yes.

411
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:16,910
Funny thing.

412
00:52:16,986 --> 00:52:20,012
There's a man, speaks on public platforms.

413
00:52:20,322 --> 00:52:23,985
ln with the government.
ln with the Liberals. ln with everybody.

414
00:52:24,293 --> 00:52:25,760
And he risks it all.

415
00:52:26,195 --> 00:52:27,423
For that!

416
00:52:28,497 --> 00:52:30,692
That's not how poets see them, is it?

417
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:32,700
That's how GPs see them.

418
00:52:33,202 --> 00:52:34,669
That's how they are.

419
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:38,139
You know, from here, she looks beautiful.

420
00:52:38,774 --> 00:52:41,106
Zhivago, l think you're a hard case.

421
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:49,618
There's a child in the case.
A child. Her daughter.

422
00:52:49,685 --> 00:52:51,653
Oh, for heaven's sake, Boris--

423
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:55,147
She might have thought about ''Lara''
before she did it.

424
00:52:55,624 --> 00:52:56,818
Does the girl know?

425
00:52:56,892 --> 00:52:58,359
l'm afraid she does.

426
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:00,891
-ls she here?
-Yes.

427
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:04,389
Tell her that her mother's going to live.

428
00:53:05,567 --> 00:53:08,001
Wait a minute, Victor. Yurian.

429
00:53:08,237 --> 00:53:09,568
Yes, of course.

430
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:14,004
What are we going to say about this?

431
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,005
-Must we say anything?
-l'm afraid so.

432
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,139
l'm taking her to the hospital.
We'll have to say something.

433
00:53:20,249 --> 00:53:22,740
You know that needn't be difficult, Boris.

434
00:55:54,803 --> 00:55:57,465
-What is the name of your assistant?
-Zhivago.

435
00:55:57,706 --> 00:55:58,934
Andreyevich?

436
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:01,168
Yes, why? Do you know him?

437
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:04,143
No, l knew his father slightly.

438
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,569
Fine.

439
00:56:15,657 --> 00:56:19,149
Cheer up, Yuri. l'll have the poor bitch
in hospital tonight.

440
00:56:19,361 --> 00:56:20,760
What's his name?

441
00:56:21,697 --> 00:56:24,632
That's Victor Komarovsky.
He says he knows you.

442
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:27,026
He executed my father's will.

443
00:56:27,703 --> 00:56:29,568
Uncle Alex turned it down.

444
00:56:29,905 --> 00:56:32,305
By Komarovsky's account
there wasn't much in it.

445
00:56:32,374 --> 00:56:34,535
And what there was
belonged to Komarovsky.

446
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,703
Oh, he's a very good businessman.

447
00:56:37,212 --> 00:56:39,112
But l doubt that he's crooked.

448
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:41,949
Very good company. Knows life.

449
00:56:43,118 --> 00:56:45,109
He's had a bad scare tonight.

450
00:57:03,772 --> 00:57:06,366
You don't mind coming here, do you,
Victor Yppolitovich?

451
00:57:06,441 --> 00:57:09,103
No, no. lt reminds me of my youth.

452
00:57:12,214 --> 00:57:14,409
-l went to the hospital again.
-And?

453
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:19,011
She wants you to go and forgive her.
For her suspicions.

454
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:21,487
You can tell her the truth
if you like, Larissa.

455
00:57:28,297 --> 00:57:29,423
ls this him?

456
00:57:29,665 --> 00:57:30,723
Yes.

457
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:33,066
-He knows nothing about--
-No.

458
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:42,302
Pasha, this is Monsieur Komarovsky.

459
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,241
Please.

460
00:57:55,324 --> 00:57:57,258
-Will you eat?
-No, thank you.

461
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,956
l hope you don't think this is impertinent,
Pavel Pavlovich.

462
00:58:01,029 --> 00:58:02,053
Not at all.

463
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:05,759
l am...l have been advising
Larissa's mother for many years.

464
00:58:06,101 --> 00:58:07,966
l'm interested in what happens to her.

465
00:58:08,036 --> 00:58:10,197
There's something l have to tell you.
And that is this:

466
00:58:11,807 --> 00:58:14,105
l am committed to the Revolution.

467
00:58:14,476 --> 00:58:15,636
Nothing...

468
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:20,174
...not even Lara,
has more importance for me.

469
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,683
You misunderstand.

470
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:26,444
Your political views do not concern me.

471
00:58:26,521 --> 00:58:29,979
So far as that goes, l'm probably
more in sympathy than you suppose.

472
00:58:30,058 --> 00:58:33,221
l have a few contacts of my own,
which might surprise you.

473
00:58:33,862 --> 00:58:35,329
How do you propose to live?

474
00:58:35,397 --> 00:58:37,194
l've been offered a teaching post.

475
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:40,166
-May l know where?
-Gradov. lt's in the Urals.

476
00:58:40,235 --> 00:58:42,533
l know it. Not much of a place.

477
00:58:42,704 --> 00:58:45,138
lt's beautiful country,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

478
00:58:45,207 --> 00:58:47,266
lt'll be a quiet life, won't it?

479
00:58:47,676 --> 00:58:49,166
That's what we want.

480
00:58:49,311 --> 00:58:52,747
Well, you'll excuse me.
Will your salary be adequate?

481
00:58:52,848 --> 00:58:54,509
Adequate. lf not more.

482
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,654
Pavel Pavlovich, my chief impression is,
and l mean no offense...

483
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:04,818
...is that you're very young.

484
00:59:04,893 --> 00:59:07,555
Monsieur Komarovsky,
l hope l don't offend you.

485
00:59:07,729 --> 00:59:09,458
Do people improve with age?

486
00:59:10,098 --> 00:59:11,861
They grow a little more tolerant.

487
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:14,424
Because they have more
to tolerate in themselves.

488
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:17,697
lf people don't marry young,
what do they bring to their marriage?

489
00:59:17,939 --> 00:59:20,032
A little experience.

490
00:59:20,442 --> 00:59:24,276
l'm 26. My mother died, needlessly,
when l was eight.

491
00:59:24,446 --> 00:59:27,711
My father died in prison.
l have fended for myself.

492
00:59:27,783 --> 00:59:30,479
l've worked my way
through higher school and university.

493
00:59:30,552 --> 00:59:33,612
l am familiar with things
that you can hardly guess at.

494
00:59:33,889 --> 00:59:36,483
All this is an experience
of a kind, certainly.

495
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:39,650
l've no amorous experience,
if that's what you mean.

496
00:59:39,728 --> 00:59:43,596
None whatever. Lara's 17.
That speaks for itself.

497
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:47,331
You probably find this situation comic.
We don't.

498
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:49,902
We're going to be married next year.

499
00:59:57,646 --> 01:00:00,114
l hope l haven't offended you
by speaking plainly.

500
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:01,774
Not at all. Admirable.

501
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:11,825
A young crusader.

502
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,188
Oh, he's not--

503
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:16,321
He's a very fine young man.
That's obvious.

504
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,067
You're very generous,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

505
01:00:23,238 --> 01:00:25,229
Larissa, l want to talk to you.

506
01:00:34,649 --> 01:00:36,674
Monsieur Komarovsky, will you--

507
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:39,012
l beg you.

508
01:00:39,087 --> 01:00:42,454
Drop this affectation of addressing me
as ''Monsieur Komarovsky''!

509
01:00:42,757 --> 01:00:45,817
Under the circumstances,
l find it rather ridiculous.

510
01:00:46,027 --> 01:00:49,793
Lara, l am determined to save you
from a dreadful error.

511
01:00:50,332 --> 01:00:54,291
There are two kinds of men, and only two.
And that young man is one kind.

512
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:56,768
He is high-minded. He is pure.

513
01:00:57,105 --> 01:01:01,166
He is the kind of man that the world
pretends to look up to and despises.

514
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:06,572
He's the kind of man who breeds
unhappiness, particularly in women.

515
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:08,113
-Do you understand?
-No.

516
01:01:08,183 --> 01:01:09,377
l think you do.

517
01:01:10,252 --> 01:01:11,844
There's another kind.

518
01:01:12,053 --> 01:01:15,511
Not high-minded. Not pure, but alive.

519
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:20,388
That your tastes at this time should incline
toward the juvenile is understandable.

520
01:01:20,462 --> 01:01:23,590
But, for you to marry that boy
would be a disaster.

521
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:26,129
Because, there are two kinds of women.

522
01:01:27,536 --> 01:01:31,768
There are two kinds of women and you,
as we well know, are not the first kind.

523
01:01:36,211 --> 01:01:39,647
You, my dear, are a slut.

524
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:42,474
l am not!

525
01:01:43,852 --> 01:01:45,080
We'll see.

526
01:02:29,764 --> 01:02:32,289
And, don't delude yourself
that this was rape.

527
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,267
That would flatter us both.

528
01:03:19,447 --> 01:03:21,312
The master's not at home, Miss Lara.

529
01:03:21,383 --> 01:03:22,577
Not at home?

530
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:25,779
No. He went to
the Sventytskis' Christmas party.

531
01:03:28,356 --> 01:03:30,221
Are you going there, Miss?

532
01:03:31,293 --> 01:03:33,193
Please don't say l told you.

533
01:03:33,428 --> 01:03:34,918
No, thank you, Piotr.

534
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:37,155
Merry Christmas, Miss Lara.

535
01:03:38,433 --> 01:03:40,697
Oh, thank you,
and Merry Christmas to you.

536
01:03:46,775 --> 01:03:48,936
Merry Christmas, Yuri Andreyevich.

537
01:04:30,919 --> 01:04:32,284
What's the matter?

538
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:39,188
We had an appointment this evening.
Where are you going?

539
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,490
Haven't you got the letter? l left a letter--

540
01:04:41,563 --> 01:04:43,929
l've not been home. l'm going home, now.

541
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:48,698
Where're you going, Lara?
l've a right to know.

542
01:04:49,104 --> 01:04:50,662
What's in this letter?

543
01:04:52,307 --> 01:04:53,899
What's in this letter?

544
01:04:57,412 --> 01:04:58,572
Are you breaking--

545
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:00,409
-lt's all in the letter.
-What is?

546
01:05:00,482 --> 01:05:01,676
Everything.

547
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:03,477
Don't!

548
01:06:08,483 --> 01:06:11,316
Yuri, there's an extraordinary girl
at this party.

549
01:06:11,786 --> 01:06:13,686
l know. l'm dancing with her.

550
01:06:16,157 --> 01:06:17,784
You're keen tonight, Victor.

551
01:06:17,859 --> 01:06:19,190
l like to win.

552
01:06:19,594 --> 01:06:20,652
Silence!

553
01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:23,923
Silence, everybody! Silence, please!

554
01:06:24,766 --> 01:06:27,929
l have a very delightful announcement
to make.

555
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:32,296
Oh, Madame Sventytski!

556
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:33,768
Yes. Why not?

557
01:06:35,009 --> 01:06:38,069
l have to announce that Dr. Yuri Zhivago--

558
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,676
Doctor Zhivago,
he came third in all Moscow.

559
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,412
Now, listen, please!

560
01:06:46,588 --> 01:06:49,113
Dr. Zhivago is betrothed in marriage to--

561
01:07:12,614 --> 01:07:14,138
My dear Victor!

562
01:07:15,483 --> 01:07:16,711
My dear man!

563
01:07:16,918 --> 01:07:18,180
Get her out.

564
01:07:18,753 --> 01:07:19,742
What?

565
01:07:19,854 --> 01:07:22,220
Get her out. Get her out!

566
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,758
Yes. Yes. l'll get the police.

567
01:07:24,826 --> 01:07:25,850
No!

568
01:07:26,327 --> 01:07:28,158
l don't want you to get the police.

569
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:31,993
l do not want the police.
l just want you to get her out!

570
01:07:50,852 --> 01:07:52,080
Let her go!

571
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,500
Please!

572
01:08:17,612 --> 01:08:20,206
Quiet, please. Please. Give way.

573
01:08:20,281 --> 01:08:22,249
Please, would you mind?

574
01:08:23,318 --> 01:08:25,513
Would you mind? Thank you, thank you.

575
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:40,565
Our destinies seem to be interwoven,
don't they?

576
01:08:40,635 --> 01:08:41,533
Yes.

577
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:44,500
l was a close friend of your father.

578
01:08:45,239 --> 01:08:47,469
l knew you were his business partner.

579
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:50,773
Rather more than that.
l was present at his death.

580
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:55,515
Also, l am in contact with your brother.

581
01:08:56,217 --> 01:08:56,979
Yevgraf?.

582
01:08:57,051 --> 01:08:59,918
l should say l'm in contact with those
who are in contact with him.

583
01:08:59,988 --> 01:09:02,183
Oh, l disagree with Bolshevism.

584
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:03,648
Thank you.

585
01:09:05,026 --> 01:09:06,926
You seem to know your trade.

586
01:09:07,095 --> 01:09:10,326
But, l can still admire Bolsheviks, as men.

587
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:14,227
Shall l tell you why?

588
01:09:14,469 --> 01:09:15,527
Yes.

589
01:09:17,538 --> 01:09:18,869
They may win.

590
01:09:21,843 --> 01:09:24,141
l'd like to meet him, Yevgraf.

591
01:09:24,545 --> 01:09:26,513
He sent me a marvelous letter.

592
01:09:27,115 --> 01:09:28,639
He likes my poetry.

593
01:09:29,584 --> 01:09:31,814
That would have pleased your father.

594
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:35,981
Your father was not a bad man, Yuri.
lf l may call you Yuri?

595
01:09:36,357 --> 01:09:37,949
l hardly knew him.

596
01:09:39,627 --> 01:09:41,788
You perhaps may not credit this...

597
01:09:43,164 --> 01:09:45,394
...but he was devoted to your mother.

598
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,972
l suppose l may continue to rely
on your professional discretion?

599
01:10:06,954 --> 01:10:11,357
You mean, will l tell anyone the truth
about that girl?

600
01:10:12,226 --> 01:10:14,023
That's what l mean, yes.

601
01:10:16,097 --> 01:10:20,227
You may continue to rely
on my professional etcetera.

602
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:22,959
You are fastidious, aren't you?

603
01:10:24,305 --> 01:10:27,866
What happens to a girl like that,
when a man like you is finished with her?

604
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,472
lnterested?

605
01:10:31,546 --> 01:10:32,911
l give her to you.

606
01:10:36,217 --> 01:10:38,811
You shouldn't smoke. You've had a shock.

607
01:10:45,893 --> 01:10:48,487
l give her to you, Yuri Andreyevich.

608
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:51,097
A wedding present.

609
01:12:04,672 --> 01:12:06,731
Where have you seen that girl before?

610
01:12:07,475 --> 01:12:09,602
What makes you think
l've seen her before?

611
01:12:09,677 --> 01:12:10,939
Haven't you?

612
01:12:11,946 --> 01:12:13,641
-Yes.
-Where?

613
01:12:14,215 --> 01:12:17,480
l'm not supposed to say.
lt was on a case. Not very nice.

614
01:12:17,652 --> 01:12:20,485
No, don't tell me,
if you're not supposed to say.

615
01:13:00,528 --> 01:13:04,020
ln bourgeols terms lt was a war
between the Allles and Germany.

616
01:13:04,599 --> 01:13:08,899
ln Bolshevlk terms lt was a war between
the Allled and the German upper classes.

617
01:13:09,337 --> 01:13:12,568
And, whlch of them won was
a matter oflndlfference.

618
01:13:29,757 --> 01:13:34,456
l was ordered by the Party to enllst.
l gave my name as Petrov.

619
01:13:35,296 --> 01:13:37,821
They were shoutlng for vlctory
all over Europe...

620
01:13:37,899 --> 01:13:40,629
...praylng for vlctory, to the same God.

621
01:13:41,469 --> 01:13:46,099
My task, the Party's task,
was to organlze defeat.

622
01:13:46,841 --> 01:13:49,309
From defeat would sprlng the Revolutlon.

623
01:13:49,377 --> 01:13:52,141
And, the Revolutlon would be
vlctory for us.

624
01:13:53,114 --> 01:13:55,605
The Party looked
to the conscrlpt peasants...

625
01:13:55,983 --> 01:13:58,952
...most of them wearlng
thelr flrst good palr ofboots.

626
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:02,289
When the boots wore out,
they'd be ready to llsten.

627
01:14:02,657 --> 01:14:06,616
When the tlme came, l was able to take
3 battallons wlth me out of the Front Llne.

628
01:14:06,694 --> 01:14:08,924
The best day's work l ever dld.

629
01:14:09,497 --> 01:14:12,261
But, for the moment,
there was nothlng to be done.

630
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:15,097
There were too many volunteers llke me.

631
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:17,629
Mostly, lt was mere hysterla.

632
01:14:17,972 --> 01:14:21,703
But there were men wlth better motlves,
men who saw the tlmes were crltlcal...

633
01:14:21,776 --> 01:14:23,607
...and wanted a man's part.

634
01:14:23,844 --> 01:14:25,436
Good men, wasted.

635
01:14:26,414 --> 01:14:27,972
Unhappy men, too.

636
01:14:28,382 --> 01:14:30,247
Unhappy ln thelr jobs.

637
01:14:31,052 --> 01:14:32,986
Unhappy wlth thelr wlves.

638
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:35,350
Doubtlng themselves.

639
01:14:36,257 --> 01:14:38,225
Happy men don't volunteer.

640
01:14:38,926 --> 01:14:43,022
They walt thelr turn and thank God
lf thelr age, or work, delays lt.

641
01:14:44,098 --> 01:14:48,091
The ones who got back home wlth
the prlce of an arm or an eye or a leg...

642
01:14:49,337 --> 01:14:51,669
...these were the lucky ones.

643
01:14:56,911 --> 01:14:58,435
Even Comrade Lenln...

644
01:14:58,846 --> 01:15:03,215
...underestlmated both
the angulsh of that 900-mlle-long front...

645
01:15:04,051 --> 01:15:06,645
...and our cursed capaclty for sufferlng.

646
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:12,220
By the second wlnter of the war...

647
01:15:12,727 --> 01:15:14,695
...the boots had worn out...

648
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,793
...but the llne stlll held.

649
01:15:18,866 --> 01:15:21,801
Thelr great coats fell to pleces
on thelr backs.

650
01:15:22,837 --> 01:15:24,930
Thelr ratlons were lrregular.

651
01:15:25,906 --> 01:15:28,568
Half of them went lnto actlon
wlthout arms...

652
01:15:28,976 --> 01:15:30,967
...led by men they dldn't trust.

653
01:15:31,045 --> 01:15:33,309
Come on, you bastards!

654
01:15:34,849 --> 01:15:36,544
And, those they dld trust--

655
01:15:36,617 --> 01:15:38,642
Come on, Comrades. Come on!

656
01:15:39,487 --> 01:15:40,511
Come on!

657
01:15:50,564 --> 01:15:51,997
Come on!

658
01:15:54,502 --> 01:15:55,662
Come on!

659
01:15:56,137 --> 01:15:58,833
Comrades! Earthshakers!

660
01:15:59,106 --> 01:16:01,199
Show them!

661
01:16:03,411 --> 01:16:05,436
Charge!

662
01:16:26,901 --> 01:16:31,201
At last they dld what all the armles
dreamed of dolng:

663
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,230
They began to go home.

664
01:16:44,752 --> 01:16:47,312
That was the beglnnlng of the Revolutlon.

665
01:17:12,346 --> 01:17:13,836
Deserters.

666
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:15,771
Replacements.

667
01:17:28,529 --> 01:17:32,021
Tote arms!

668
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:40,934
Come back.

669
01:17:42,209 --> 01:17:43,938
Stick together!

670
01:17:47,047 --> 01:17:49,345
Stick together and we'll be all right.

671
01:17:50,518 --> 01:17:52,247
And be ready for them.

672
01:18:17,945 --> 01:18:19,310
Turn around, lads!

673
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,105
-Don't go any farther.
-Come on, lads. Turn around.

674
01:18:22,183 --> 01:18:24,515
Pigs to the slaughter! Look at you!

675
01:18:24,752 --> 01:18:26,242
Turn around, lads.

676
01:18:48,209 --> 01:18:49,471
Listen, lads.

677
01:18:50,311 --> 01:18:52,711
Ten miles up that road are the Germans!

678
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,346
-Rubbish.
-Not rubbish.

679
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:59,442
They're coming. And they're coming fast.

680
01:19:00,421 --> 01:19:02,013
You've let them in.

681
01:19:04,325 --> 01:19:06,316
They're coming for your wives...

682
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,758
...your houses, your country.

683
01:19:08,896 --> 01:19:11,330
Your country, Officer!

684
01:19:12,132 --> 01:19:15,158
Yes, my country! And proud--

685
01:19:30,251 --> 01:19:31,946
Get back in your ranks!

686
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:34,412
Get back in your ranks!

687
01:19:40,227 --> 01:19:41,694
Get back!

688
01:19:44,598 --> 01:19:46,759
Get back in the ranks!

689
01:21:02,843 --> 01:21:04,174
Are you a nurse?

690
01:21:05,012 --> 01:21:05,944
Yes.

691
01:21:06,046 --> 01:21:07,707
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

692
01:21:08,449 --> 01:21:09,848
Then help me.

693
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:41,345
Doctor, l ought to tell you,
l'm not a trained nurse, l'm a volunteer.

694
01:21:41,415 --> 01:21:42,609
l see. Right.

695
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:45,142
Why did you volunteer?

696
01:21:45,853 --> 01:21:48,788
-l came here to find my husband.
-Very gently.

697
01:21:49,223 --> 01:21:51,589
-Have you ever seen an operation?
-Yes.

698
01:21:51,759 --> 01:21:53,021
We'll manage.

699
01:22:05,606 --> 01:22:09,098
They're in the next village, brothers.
The Germans.

700
01:22:10,344 --> 01:22:12,039
-Your Honor--
-Keep still.

701
01:22:42,109 --> 01:22:44,043
Did you find your husband?

702
01:22:45,479 --> 01:22:46,468
No.

703
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,911
Your Honor....

704
01:22:48,048 --> 01:22:49,709
Yes, we'd better be off.

705
01:23:06,133 --> 01:23:09,068
You know, you often look at me
as though you knew me.

706
01:23:09,269 --> 01:23:12,432
l have seen you.
Four years ago. Christmas Eve.

707
01:23:14,808 --> 01:23:16,366
Were you there?

708
01:23:17,311 --> 01:23:19,006
No wonder you look at me.

709
01:23:20,981 --> 01:23:22,972
Did you know Victor Komarovsky?

710
01:23:23,617 --> 01:23:26,814
Yes, l did. That young man,
who took you away--

711
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:27,818
My husband.

712
01:23:27,888 --> 01:23:31,051
A lot of courage.
He made the rest of us look very feeble.

713
01:23:31,124 --> 01:23:33,752
As a matter of fact, l thought you both did.

714
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:35,823
Good man to shoot at.

715
01:23:36,864 --> 01:23:39,264
l'd give anything never to have met him.

716
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:11,225
The tsar's in prison.

717
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,724
Lenin's in Moscow.

718
01:24:16,203 --> 01:24:17,966
Civil war has started.

719
01:24:18,372 --> 01:24:19,339
Good!

720
01:24:19,406 --> 01:24:20,964
Civil war, good?

721
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:24,070
Not good, Comrade Nurse, inevitable.

722
01:24:25,712 --> 01:24:28,704
But Lenin in Moscow!

723
01:24:29,383 --> 01:24:32,875
This Lenin, will he be the new tsar then?

724
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:37,423
Listen, Daddy.
No more tsars, no more masters.

725
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:41,125
Only workers in a worker's state.
How about that?

726
01:24:42,462 --> 01:24:43,952
Are you a doctor?

727
01:24:44,164 --> 01:24:45,859
-Yes.
-Follow me, please.

728
01:25:32,713 --> 01:25:34,647
l can't deal with this.

729
01:25:35,182 --> 01:25:38,674
Order of the Provisional Government.
You'll have to try, friend.

730
01:25:46,827 --> 01:25:49,489
''lf you could see how hard
we have been working here...

731
01:25:49,563 --> 01:25:53,021
''...l feel sure you'd forgive me, dear,
for not writing more regularly.''

732
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,465
When was that written?

733
01:25:54,568 --> 01:25:55,830
July 20th.

734
01:25:55,902 --> 01:25:57,062
Eight weeks!

735
01:25:57,638 --> 01:26:00,334
''But now the war seems
really to have stopped.

736
01:26:00,407 --> 01:26:03,672
''The hospital is emptying,
and l shall have more time.

737
01:26:03,777 --> 01:26:08,111
''l may even get time to write some verse,
if l've not forgotten how to.''

738
01:26:08,715 --> 01:26:10,182
Oh, l do hope so!

739
01:26:12,452 --> 01:26:16,013
''Larissa Antipova is still here,
and l admire her more and more.

740
01:26:17,758 --> 01:26:22,127
''She seems to have the strange gift
of healing, which doctors don't believe in.

741
01:26:22,863 --> 01:26:26,799
''She often does the wrong things,
but it always seems to work out right.

742
01:26:28,435 --> 01:26:29,902
''How is Uncle Alex?

743
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:33,471
-''Can he still get his English tobacco?''
-Would that he could!

744
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:36,703
''Can Sasha say his letters yet?
And how is Auntie Anna?''

745
01:26:38,311 --> 01:26:40,176
He didn't get my letter.

746
01:26:41,348 --> 01:26:43,839
''Most of all, my dearest, how are you?''

747
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:47,113
Strangely upsetting.
He doesn't know she's dead.

748
01:26:48,388 --> 01:26:50,515
Can't see what difference it makes.

749
01:26:51,892 --> 01:26:53,359
They're at it again!

750
01:26:54,061 --> 01:26:56,552
l wish they'd decide once and for all...

751
01:26:57,164 --> 01:27:01,931
...which gang of hooligans constitutes
the government of this country!

752
01:27:08,775 --> 01:27:10,242
Cheer up, Sergei.

753
01:27:11,111 --> 01:27:12,840
Don't you want to go home?

754
01:27:13,613 --> 01:27:16,480
There's fighting at home, Your Honor.
l've had enough.

755
01:27:17,117 --> 01:27:21,076
Red Guards and White Guards,
this old man's had enough.

756
01:27:22,556 --> 01:27:24,547
Your Honor is a kind gentleman.

757
01:27:27,294 --> 01:27:29,558
And, the nurse is a kind lady.

758
01:27:44,578 --> 01:27:45,738
Finished?

759
01:27:45,979 --> 01:27:47,310
Just about.

760
01:27:56,289 --> 01:27:58,951
ln a couple of weeks
you'll be with your little girl.

761
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:00,686
lf l can get on a train.

762
01:28:03,697 --> 01:28:06,860
l want to be with Katya
more than anything in the world.

763
01:28:07,134 --> 01:28:08,396
Yes, of course.

764
01:28:09,903 --> 01:28:12,201
But, now that we're going, l feel sad.

765
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:15,363
Sad.

766
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:17,802
Really sad.

767
01:28:18,445 --> 01:28:20,777
-Well, we've been here some time.
-Yes.

768
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:25,941
This must have been a lovely house, once.

769
01:28:26,887 --> 01:28:28,047
Don't you think?

770
01:28:28,121 --> 01:28:29,884
What are you going to do?

771
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:31,682
ln Gradov?

772
01:28:31,758 --> 01:28:32,747
Yes.

773
01:28:33,994 --> 01:28:35,086
l'll be all right.

774
01:28:35,162 --> 01:28:36,823
l wish l could think so.

775
01:28:42,736 --> 01:28:44,397
You could run a laundry.

776
01:28:46,072 --> 01:28:47,562
What will you do?

777
01:28:47,674 --> 01:28:50,006
l suppose l'll go back to the hospital.

778
01:28:51,077 --> 01:28:53,170
lt's funny to think of you there.

779
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:59,415
l used to pass it on my way to school.

780
01:29:00,754 --> 01:29:02,745
Do you ever come to Moscow?

781
01:29:02,989 --> 01:29:04,149
From Gradov?

782
01:29:05,158 --> 01:29:07,752
lf only there were someone
to look after you.

783
01:29:07,828 --> 01:29:11,161
Of course, if there were,
l'd be destroyed by jealousy.

784
01:29:11,264 --> 01:29:12,629
Zhivago, don't.

785
01:29:16,837 --> 01:29:19,567
My dear, don't, please!

786
01:29:25,478 --> 01:29:27,571
Now, look what you've made me do.

787
01:29:35,188 --> 01:29:38,521
We've been together six months,
on the road and here...

788
01:29:39,693 --> 01:29:43,356
...and we've not done anything
you'll have to lie about to Tonya.

789
01:29:44,564 --> 01:29:47,055
l don't want you to have to lie about me.

790
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:49,996
You understand that, Yuri?

791
01:29:53,473 --> 01:29:55,168
You understand everything.

792
01:30:05,385 --> 01:30:07,546
Come on, Comrades! l'm in a hurry.

793
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:09,644
Going home, Kuril?

794
01:30:09,923 --> 01:30:11,481
Home, Your Excellency?

795
01:30:11,725 --> 01:30:14,091
Petrograd. l'm joining the Red Guard.

796
01:30:14,261 --> 01:30:15,751
What about your wife?

797
01:30:16,529 --> 01:30:19,089
Sometimes, Comrade Nurse,
women have to wait.

798
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,989
Right!

799
01:30:21,268 --> 01:30:22,963
Goodbye, honored Doctor.

800
01:30:24,104 --> 01:30:25,503
Want some advice?

801
01:30:25,605 --> 01:30:28,438
-Said the millstone to the barley.
-That's right.

802
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:29,770
Adapt yourself!

803
01:30:37,918 --> 01:30:39,249
Goodbye, Durinev.

804
01:30:39,486 --> 01:30:40,976
Goodbye, Your Honor.

805
01:30:42,455 --> 01:30:43,888
Goodbye, Andr.

806
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,289
Goodbye, Simyon.

807
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:51,830
l'll never forget Your Honor.

808
01:30:52,732 --> 01:30:53,756
Never!

809
01:30:55,268 --> 01:30:56,599
Goodbye, Zhivago.

810
01:30:58,571 --> 01:31:00,061
Goodbye. Thank you.

811
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:04,699
Pilenko.

812
01:31:43,316 --> 01:31:45,511
Goodbye, brothers!

813
01:32:31,164 --> 01:32:32,859
The doctor is a gentleman.

814
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:34,757
Right. Written all over him.

815
01:32:34,834 --> 01:32:36,529
He's a good man.

816
01:32:36,903 --> 01:32:38,427
God rot good men.

817
01:32:55,522 --> 01:32:56,546
Yuri!

818
01:33:28,488 --> 01:33:31,980
This is Comrade Yelkin,
our local delegate. He lives here.

819
01:33:33,893 --> 01:33:35,121
How do you do?

820
01:33:36,029 --> 01:33:37,053
Welcome.

821
01:33:38,031 --> 01:33:39,521
Comrade Kaprugina--

822
01:33:39,732 --> 01:33:40,562
Welcome.

823
01:33:40,633 --> 01:33:42,897
lt's not for you to welcome us, Comrade.

824
01:33:42,969 --> 01:33:46,735
Comrade Kaprugina is the chairman
of the Residents' Committee.

825
01:33:47,507 --> 01:33:49,873
-Yes, of course.
-Your discharge papers?

826
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:51,334
Oh, yes.

827
01:33:53,046 --> 01:33:55,105
l signed them myself, l'm afraid.

828
01:34:01,087 --> 01:34:02,247
Holy Cross?

829
01:34:03,022 --> 01:34:04,080
What?

830
01:34:04,357 --> 01:34:07,849
-Holy Cross Hospital. lt's on--
-The Second Reformed Hospital.

831
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:12,261
Good. lt needed reforming.

832
01:34:18,204 --> 01:34:21,037
Medicals report
to their place of work at once.

833
01:34:21,241 --> 01:34:23,232
Yes. l believe there's typhus?

834
01:34:25,044 --> 01:34:27,638
You've been listening
to rumormongers, Comrade.

835
01:34:27,714 --> 01:34:29,705
There is no typhus in our city.

836
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:33,517
Well, that's good news.
l'll report tomorrow.

837
01:34:34,087 --> 01:34:36,920
When you've started work,
you'll get a ration book.

838
01:34:37,724 --> 01:34:39,191
l've always worked.

839
01:34:44,998 --> 01:34:46,659
Whatever is the matter?

840
01:34:47,033 --> 01:34:48,022
You are.

841
01:34:51,137 --> 01:34:55,301
There was living space for 13 families
in this one house.

842
01:34:58,545 --> 01:35:02,003
Yes. This is a better arrangement,
Comrades.

843
01:35:02,415 --> 01:35:03,473
More just.

844
01:35:11,491 --> 01:35:14,983
Well, it is more just, Tonya.
Why did it sound so funny?

845
01:35:25,238 --> 01:35:26,830
ls it good to be home?

846
01:35:36,816 --> 01:35:37,805
Sasha?

847
01:35:37,917 --> 01:35:39,077
Who else?

848
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:43,279
lt's your daddy, Sasha.

849
01:35:43,356 --> 01:35:44,345
Sasha!

850
01:35:46,025 --> 01:35:47,014
Sasha!

851
01:35:48,628 --> 01:35:49,617
Naughty boy!

852
01:35:49,696 --> 01:35:51,186
No, don't say that.

853
01:35:53,266 --> 01:35:54,597
May l come in?

854
01:35:57,303 --> 01:35:58,736
Watch carefully.

855
01:35:59,706 --> 01:36:03,540
l am about to ignite the last half
of the last cigar in Moscow.

856
01:36:06,279 --> 01:36:07,439
Good meal?

857
01:36:07,714 --> 01:36:09,477
-Very.
-Say something.

858
01:36:11,851 --> 01:36:13,614
That was very good, Tonya.

859
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:14,778
That was nothing.

860
01:36:14,854 --> 01:36:17,186
She's been saving that salami
for three months.

861
01:36:17,257 --> 01:36:18,349
Have you, darling?

862
01:36:18,424 --> 01:36:19,755
l got it for a clock.

863
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:23,322
She's a marvel. Coffee, you observe.

864
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:26,460
Stop it, Daddy. He knows l'm a marvel.

865
01:36:28,067 --> 01:36:29,557
Did you write any poetry?

866
01:36:29,636 --> 01:36:30,898
Quite a lot.

867
01:36:31,371 --> 01:36:32,463
ls it good?

868
01:36:33,573 --> 01:36:35,404
Yes, l think so.

869
01:36:36,342 --> 01:36:37,536
Can l see it?

870
01:36:38,311 --> 01:36:39,801
Well, of course.

871
01:36:41,581 --> 01:36:45,415
What happened to Nurse Antipova?
Your letters were full of her.

872
01:36:46,386 --> 01:36:48,081
Yes, l suppose they were.

873
01:36:49,122 --> 01:36:52,114
That's the girl who shot
friend Komarovsky, isn't it?

874
01:36:52,325 --> 01:36:54,156
Yes, Daddy. You know it is.

875
01:36:54,527 --> 01:36:56,688
She's gone home to her little girl.

876
01:36:57,764 --> 01:36:59,755
-Oh, we shan't see her then?
-No.

877
01:37:00,767 --> 01:37:01,927
What a pity!

878
01:37:10,677 --> 01:37:12,941
Farewell, the pleasures of the flesh.

879
01:37:14,447 --> 01:37:18,281
What l don't understand is
how we're going to stay alive this winter.

880
01:37:23,356 --> 01:37:25,722
You have no right whatever
to call me from work.

881
01:37:25,792 --> 01:37:27,225
As a Soviet deputy, l--

882
01:37:27,293 --> 01:37:29,693
That gives you the power, not the right.

883
01:37:29,962 --> 01:37:33,125
lt's noticed, you know.
Your attitude is noticed.

884
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:35,995
You should have called the area doctor.

885
01:37:36,269 --> 01:37:38,203
l want this done quietly.

886
01:37:38,638 --> 01:37:40,629
Why, what is it, typhus?

887
01:37:50,850 --> 01:37:53,512
l'll take him away. Get me some transport.

888
01:37:54,053 --> 01:37:55,611
lt isn't typhus.

889
01:37:56,389 --> 01:37:59,552
lt's another disease
we don't have in Moscow: starvation.

890
01:37:59,992 --> 01:38:01,857
That seems to give you satisfaction.

891
01:38:01,928 --> 01:38:04,226
lt would give me satisfaction
to hear you admit it.

892
01:38:04,297 --> 01:38:06,663
-Would it? Why?
-Because it is so.

893
01:38:08,201 --> 01:38:11,728
Your attitude is noticed, you know.
Oh, yes, it's been noticed.

894
01:38:16,275 --> 01:38:17,264
Hello.

895
01:38:22,014 --> 01:38:23,345
The stove's out!

896
01:38:28,087 --> 01:38:29,418
The stove's out!

897
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:33,482
What's the matter with you?
No wonder he's losing weight!

898
01:38:41,968 --> 01:38:46,462
She lets it out as soon as you've gone,
and she lights it before you come home.

899
01:38:59,986 --> 01:39:01,647
We haven't enough fuel.

900
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:26,142
l told myselflt was beneath my dlgnlty
to arrest a man for pllferlng flrewood.

901
01:39:28,948 --> 01:39:32,247
But nothlng ordered by the Party
ls beneath the dlgnlty of any man...

902
01:39:32,318 --> 01:39:33,785
...and the Party was rlght.

903
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,012
One man desperate for a blt of fuel
ls pathetlc.

904
01:39:37,356 --> 01:39:40,883
Flve mllllon people desperate for fuel
wlll destroy a clty.

905
01:39:42,061 --> 01:39:44,757
That was the flrst tlme
l ever saw my brother.

906
01:39:44,831 --> 01:39:49,063
But, l knew hlm,
and l knew that l would dlsobey the Party.

907
01:39:49,969 --> 01:39:53,302
Perhaps lt was the tle ofblood
between us, but l doubt lt.

908
01:39:53,606 --> 01:39:57,303
We were only half-tled, anyway,
and brothers wlll betray a brother.

909
01:39:57,543 --> 01:40:00,740
lndeed, as a pollceman, l would say
''Get hold of a man's brother...

910
01:40:00,813 --> 01:40:02,474
''...and you're half way home. ''

911
01:40:03,049 --> 01:40:05,950
Nor was lt admlratlon
for a better man than me.

912
01:40:06,886 --> 01:40:10,549
l dld admlre hlm, but l dldn't thlnk
he was a better man.

913
01:40:11,123 --> 01:40:14,615
Besldes, l've executed better men than me
wlth a small plstol.

914
01:40:47,026 --> 01:40:49,824
Now you'll have to live
like the rest of us, Doctor.

915
01:40:49,896 --> 01:40:52,057
Bring that! Bring that back!

916
01:40:52,131 --> 01:40:54,656
Oh, listen to His Excellency!

917
01:40:56,636 --> 01:40:58,160
l want no anarchy!

918
01:40:59,005 --> 01:41:01,098
l want this carried out correctly.

919
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:05,470
What are you doing?

920
01:41:05,545 --> 01:41:07,638
Re-allocation of living space,
Comrade Doctor.

921
01:41:07,713 --> 01:41:10,580
Fifty square meters
for a family of less than five persons.

922
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:12,743
Dammit, whose house is this, anyway?

923
01:41:13,019 --> 01:41:14,509
Father, be quiet!

924
01:41:14,587 --> 01:41:18,045
All right, 50 square meters.
What're you doing with my things?

925
01:41:18,124 --> 01:41:19,352
They're being stored.

926
01:41:19,425 --> 01:41:20,915
They're being stolen.

927
01:41:21,994 --> 01:41:23,291
Just a minute!

928
01:41:33,239 --> 01:41:35,002
And where did you get this?

929
01:41:35,174 --> 01:41:37,142
l pulled it out of a fence.

930
01:42:05,071 --> 01:42:07,039
l told them who l was.

931
01:42:07,406 --> 01:42:11,365
The old man was hostlle, the glrl cautlous.

932
01:42:12,311 --> 01:42:13,505
My brother...

933
01:42:15,514 --> 01:42:17,106
...seemed very pleased.

934
01:42:21,053 --> 01:42:24,545
l thlnk the glrl was the only one
who guessed at thelr posltlon.

935
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:29,728
You're just as l imagined you.
You're my political conscience.

936
01:42:29,829 --> 01:42:32,059
l asked hlm hadn't he one of hls own.

937
01:42:32,331 --> 01:42:34,629
And so he talked about the Revolutlon.

938
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:39,137
You lay life on a table and you cut out
all the tumors of injustice. Marvelous.

939
01:42:39,205 --> 01:42:42,436
l told hlm lf he felt llke that
he shouldjoln the Party.

940
01:42:42,875 --> 01:42:46,333
Cutting out the tumors of injustice,
that's a deep operation.

941
01:42:46,612 --> 01:42:48,842
Someone must keep life alive
while you do it.

942
01:42:48,914 --> 01:42:50,142
By living.

943
01:42:50,616 --> 01:42:51,947
lsn't that right?

944
01:42:52,018 --> 01:42:54,145
l thought then lt was wrong.

945
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:58,415
He told me what he thought
about the Party and l trembled for hlm.

946
01:42:58,524 --> 01:43:03,086
He approved of us, but for reasons
whlch were subtle, llke hls verse.

947
01:43:03,763 --> 01:43:06,391
Approval such as hls
could vanlsh overnlght.

948
01:43:06,465 --> 01:43:07,523
l told hlm so.

949
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,058
Of course, l can't approve this evening
something you may do tomorrow.

950
01:43:11,137 --> 01:43:15,369
He was walklng about wlth a noose
round hls neck and dldn't know.

951
01:43:15,908 --> 01:43:19,742
So l told hlm what l had heard
about hls poems.

952
01:43:21,681 --> 01:43:22,978
Not liked?

953
01:43:24,116 --> 01:43:25,583
Not liked by whom?

954
01:43:27,086 --> 01:43:28,314
Why not liked?

955
01:43:28,387 --> 01:43:29,979
So l told hlm that.

956
01:43:39,432 --> 01:43:43,368
Do you think it's ''personal,
petit-bourgeois and self indulgent''?

957
01:43:44,804 --> 01:43:45,862
l lled.

958
01:43:46,572 --> 01:43:48,199
But he belleved me.

959
01:43:48,908 --> 01:43:52,344
And lt struck me through to see
that my oplnlon mattered.

960
01:43:54,113 --> 01:43:56,843
The glrl knew what lt meant,
what lt was golng to mean.

961
01:43:56,916 --> 01:43:59,976
They couldn't survlve
what was comlng ln the clty.

962
01:44:00,052 --> 01:44:03,283
l urged them to leave and llve obscurely
somewhere ln the country...

963
01:44:03,355 --> 01:44:05,516
...where they could keep themselves allve.

964
01:44:05,591 --> 01:44:09,220
We have, used to have,
an estate at Varykino, near Yuriatin.

965
01:44:11,664 --> 01:44:13,632
The people know us there.

966
01:44:13,933 --> 01:44:15,264
He dldn't reslst.

967
01:44:15,568 --> 01:44:18,628
l offered to obtaln permlts,
passes, warrants...

968
01:44:18,971 --> 01:44:21,940
...told them what to take
and what to leave behlnd.

969
01:44:25,544 --> 01:44:28,945
l had the lmpertlnence to ask hlm
for a volume of hls poems.

970
01:44:30,282 --> 01:44:31,874
And so we parted.

971
01:44:32,218 --> 01:44:35,779
l thlnk l even told hlm
that we would meet agaln ln better tlmes.

972
01:44:36,422 --> 01:44:38,117
But perhaps l dldn't.

973
01:46:36,709 --> 01:46:38,040
Fifty persons!

974
01:46:38,177 --> 01:46:39,667
Fifty persons only!

975
01:46:39,845 --> 01:46:41,176
Fifty persons!

976
01:46:44,917 --> 01:46:46,179
Tonya, here!

977
01:46:46,285 --> 01:46:48,446
Fifty persons only!

978
01:46:48,787 --> 01:46:49,947
Get back!

979
01:46:52,424 --> 01:46:54,289
Fifty persons only!

980
01:46:54,693 --> 01:46:56,388
Fifty persons!

981
01:46:57,696 --> 01:46:59,163
Fifty persons!

982
01:46:59,298 --> 01:47:01,698
Only 50 persons!

983
01:47:14,513 --> 01:47:16,242
Charming accommodation.

984
01:47:16,482 --> 01:47:18,347
Charming accommodation.

985
01:47:19,051 --> 01:47:20,416
That's very good.

986
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,387
l'm an intellectual.

987
01:47:22,454 --> 01:47:25,082
Shut up, you ''intellectual.''

988
01:47:26,825 --> 01:47:28,554
Shut up, you lickspittle.

989
01:47:36,035 --> 01:47:37,024
Forced labor.

990
01:47:48,013 --> 01:47:49,503
Attention, Comrades.

991
01:47:49,648 --> 01:47:52,014
Your train will leave tomorrow morning.

992
01:47:52,251 --> 01:47:54,378
Health regulations for the journey:

993
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:57,550
Night soil will be emptied
every morning without fail.

994
01:47:57,623 --> 01:48:01,491
Straw to be replaced at ten day intervals
and the old straw burned.

995
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:05,357
ln the event of fresh straw
being unavailable, old straw to be turned.

996
01:48:06,332 --> 01:48:08,266
This is disinfectant. Use it.

997
01:48:10,302 --> 01:48:12,736
ln this wagon is a detachment
of Voluntary Labor.

998
01:48:12,805 --> 01:48:13,829
Liar.

999
01:48:18,944 --> 01:48:22,345
You are required by Military Committee
to show them all assistance.

1000
01:48:22,448 --> 01:48:26,475
One carriage is occupied by sailors
of the heroic Kronstadt Sailors' Soviet.

1001
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:29,787
So you'll be in good hands.

1002
01:48:29,855 --> 01:48:31,152
They're idiots.

1003
01:48:33,092 --> 01:48:34,559
Attention, Comrades.

1004
01:48:34,994 --> 01:48:38,555
ln approximately 1 1 days' time
you'll pass through the Urals province...

1005
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:41,724
...where White Guard units,
aided by foreign interventionists...

1006
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,292
...and other criminal reactionary elements,
have recently been active.

1007
01:48:46,038 --> 01:48:48,097
The Military Committee assures you...

1008
01:48:48,273 --> 01:48:51,401
...that the criminals have been
completely routed in that area...

1009
01:48:51,477 --> 01:48:55,379
...by Red Guard units under the command
of People's Commander Strelnikov.

1010
01:48:57,349 --> 01:48:58,577
There's a man.

1011
01:48:59,084 --> 01:49:00,108
Clap him.

1012
01:49:02,087 --> 01:49:04,385
The line is definitely clear.

1013
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:06,523
Long live the Revolution!

1014
01:49:06,592 --> 01:49:07,957
Long live anarchy!

1015
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:10,490
Lickspittle! Bureaucrat!

1016
01:49:20,105 --> 01:49:21,538
ls that necessary?

1017
01:49:22,641 --> 01:49:26,304
Six volunteers l've signed for,
and six l'll deliver.

1018
01:49:27,813 --> 01:49:30,213
l'm a free man, lickspittle.

1019
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:33,514
There's nothing you can do about it.

1020
01:49:39,458 --> 01:49:41,983
l'm the only free man on this train.

1021
01:49:43,262 --> 01:49:45,162
The rest of you are cattle.

1022
01:54:57,876 --> 01:55:00,276
Help me, brothers, for the love of God.

1023
01:55:16,194 --> 01:55:17,821
Come on!

1024
01:55:37,516 --> 01:55:39,450
Yuri, the child is dead.

1025
01:55:49,261 --> 01:55:51,126
lt wasn't my child, dear...

1026
01:55:51,396 --> 01:55:54,456
...and his little soul's in Heaven now,
that's certain.

1027
01:55:56,001 --> 01:55:58,196
Who did it, Comrade, the Whites?

1028
01:55:58,670 --> 01:55:59,830
The Whites?

1029
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:03,940
No, Strelnikov.

1030
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:08,235
Well, then, you must have done something.

1031
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,677
lt wasn't us, Comrade.

1032
01:56:10,949 --> 01:56:13,417
The commander said
we'd sold horses to the Whites.

1033
01:56:13,485 --> 01:56:15,783
lt wasn't us, it was those pigs in Kuniko.

1034
01:56:15,921 --> 01:56:17,889
We told him, but he didn't believe us.

1035
01:56:17,956 --> 01:56:19,651
l expect you were lying.

1036
01:56:19,724 --> 01:56:21,885
-As God's my witness.
-But he isn't.

1037
01:56:23,929 --> 01:56:26,090
Commander Strelnikov is a great man.

1038
01:56:27,766 --> 01:56:31,293
A commander, Sasha,
and he lives on bread and water.

1039
01:56:31,903 --> 01:56:32,961
Does he?

1040
01:56:33,872 --> 01:56:35,339
l don't know. They say so.

1041
01:56:35,407 --> 01:56:36,396
lt's true.

1042
01:56:36,475 --> 01:56:38,534
No one knows where he comes from.

1043
01:56:39,044 --> 01:56:41,035
And they never know where he is.

1044
01:56:41,179 --> 01:56:43,409
-He's back up the line.
-Yes?

1045
01:56:46,451 --> 01:56:47,884
Someone's for it.

1046
01:56:50,455 --> 01:56:52,150
Oh, really, not again!

1047
01:56:53,758 --> 01:56:55,089
What this time?

1048
01:57:05,337 --> 01:57:07,999
Never mind, Father.
Get a good night's sleep.

1049
01:57:13,211 --> 01:57:15,008
l know what l'm going to do.

1050
01:57:37,769 --> 01:57:38,793
Look!

1051
01:57:39,971 --> 01:57:41,199
The Urals.

1052
01:57:43,074 --> 01:57:46,066
Look, Sasha, look.
That's where we're going, darling.

1053
01:57:46,411 --> 01:57:48,902
Through the mountains and into the forest.

1054
01:57:49,147 --> 01:57:51,138
Then it'll be much warmer still.

1055
01:57:52,384 --> 01:57:54,875
Will there be wolves in the forest?

1056
01:58:19,678 --> 01:58:21,270
Strelnikov!

1057
01:58:29,354 --> 01:58:30,844
That's Strelnikov.
