1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,810
You said: "I love you."
I said: "Wait."

2
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,110
I almost said: "I'm yours."
You said: "Go."

3
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,880
JULES AND JIM

4
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,130
With the Little
SABINE HAUDEPIN

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,800
With
And the voice of

6
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,740
Based on the novel by

Adaption and Dialogue by

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,180
Edited by

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,350
Music by

10
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,590
Song written by

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,490
Director of Photography

12
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,290
It was around 1912.

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,000
Jules, a foreigner in Paris,
asked Jim, whom he hardly knew,

14
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,840
to get him into the Art Students' Ball.

15
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,000
Jim got him a ticket
and a costume.

16
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,070
While Jules was hunting for
a slave costume...

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,410
their friendship was born.

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,110
It grew as Jules watched the ball
with his kind tender eyes.

19
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,690
The next day, they had
their first real conversation.

20
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,820
Each taught the other his language
and his culture until late at night.

21
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,690
They translated
each other's poetry.

22
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,060
They shared
an indifference for money.

23
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,800
They talked,
and they listened to each other.

24
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,740
Jules had no girls in Paris
and he wanted one.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,470
Jim had several.
He introduced Jules to a musician.

26
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,280
They were in love for about a week.

27
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,250
Then came a sweet thing
who loved to talk all night.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,520
And a pretty blonde widow
who made them a trio.

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,820
She confused Jules.
She found him nice, but clumsy.

30
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,160
She brough thim a quiet friend
who was too quiet.

31
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,460
Despite Jim's advice, Jules
got in contact withp rofessionals...

32
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,730
but found no satisfaction.

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
Let's get to work.

34
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,390
"Down with everything"

35
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,460
No more paint, you bitch.

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,590
They'll say
anarchists can't spell, again.

37
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,560
Save me! He's after me!

38
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,830
He's stronger than you!
Let's run!

39
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,270
Can you put me up for the night?

40
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,430
- I'm Therese.
- Of course, Therese.

41
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,770
You can't stay with me.
I've got a date.

42
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,110
Gilberte? But Jules can...
That's me...

43
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,580
And who're you?
Jim and Jules, then?

44
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,620
No, Jules and Jim.

45
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,640
What's that?

46
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,440
It's better than a clock.
When the sand stops, I must go to sleep.

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,670
-You'll sleep here and me there.
- I see.

48
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,370
- Got a cigarette?
- Of course.

49
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,470
- Are you Jim?
- No, Jules.

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,440
You're sweet.

51
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,750
I'll show you a steam engine.

52
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,440
It's almost dawn.

53
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,810
Jim, you might stay here
with me for once.

54
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,400
No, Gilberte.

55
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,570
If I stayed only once,
I'd feel guilty.

56
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,090
If I stayed longer,
we'd be almost married.

57
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,350
- That's against our rules!
- What a twisted mind.

58
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,330
And the cat doesn't like
to stay at home alone.

59
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,020
Besides, it's morning.

60
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,100
Just imagine that I'm going to work.

61
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,370
You're going home to sleep until noon.

62
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,670
No, it was Shakespeare.

63
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,170
Give me a dime for the music.

64
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,540
It was Shakespeare,
I tell you.

65
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,220
Do you have a cigarette?

66
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,090
Can you put me up for the night?
I'm Therese.

67
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,230
Forget it. There are more
where she came from.

68
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,670
I wasn't in love with her.

69
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,480
She was both mother and daughter to me.

70
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,150
I'm not lucky in Paris.

71
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,120
Good thing I know girls back home.

72
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,590
I love one, Lucie.

73
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,990
She refused to marry me.

74
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,260
I've decided to wait 6 months,
and ask her again.

75
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,270
There's another, too.
Birgitta.

76
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,600
And there's Elga.

77
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,040
I'd love her
if I didn't love Lucie.

78
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,630
This is what she looks like.

79
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,610
Jules sketched a woman's face
on the table.

80
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,320
Jim wanted to buy the table...

81
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,260
but the owner wanted
to sell the whole set.

82
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,900
Albert.

83
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,060
This is Jim, a French friend.

84
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,080
Hello. I think we've met before.

85
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,740
Sit down.

86
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,080
-Jim had asked...
- Who is Albert?

87
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,920
The artists' friend.

88
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,790
He knows everyone
who'll be famous in ten years.

89
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,230
This is more exotic.

90
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,330
She looks like an Incan statue.

91
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,440
This one is somewhat Romanesque.

92
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,600
It's weathered because
I found it in the garden.

93
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,770
It was out in the rain for years.

94
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,940
This one is very touching.

95
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,990
Reminds you of a decaying face.

96
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,250
Strange to see stone
worked so flabbily.

97
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,990
This face has beautiful lips.

98
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,830
They're scornful.
Admirable eyes, too.

99
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,840
May we see that last one again?

100
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,550
I made a close-up of it, too.

101
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,880
The slide showed
a woman's face...

102
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,480
whose tranquil smile gripped them.

103
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,890
The statue was in an outdoor museum
on an Adriatic island.

104
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,460
They left immediately to see it.

105
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,550
They wore
the same white outfiits.

106
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,870
They stared at the face
for an hour.

107
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,100
It stunned them into silence.

108
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,910
They were speechless.
Had they ever met such a smile?

109
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,580
No. If they ever met it,
they would follow it.

110
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,950
Jules and Jim
returned home dazzled.

111
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,850
Paris greeted them gently.

112
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,740
- How is your book?
- It's coming along.

113
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,110
It will be rather autobiographical.

114
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,950
Our friendship had
a major part in it.

115
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,520
I'd love to have you read
an excerpt from it.

116
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,720
Please do.

117
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,290
"Jacques and Julien were inseparable.

118
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,630
Julien's last novel
was successful.

119
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,600
In it, he described
the enchanting women he had known...

120
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,400
...before he had met Jacques
and even Lucienne.

121
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,370
Jacques was proud of Julien.

122
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,310
People called them
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza...

123
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,750
and they never knew that neighbors
found their friendship ambiguous.

124
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,910
They ate together
in small restaurants.

125
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,650
They bought for one another
the best cigars."

126
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,550
It's beautiful.

127
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,250
Let me translate it into German.

128
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,090
Now, for a shower.

129
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,200
My cousinjust wrote me.

130
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,260
Three girls he knows
are coming to Paris.

131
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,210
One is German, one is Dutch,
and one is French.

132
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,300
They're coming to dinner tomorrow.

133
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,350
I want you to join us.

134
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,510
Catherine, the French girl,
was the statue.

135
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,850
She had the same smile, nose,
mouth, chin, and forehead.

136
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,260
Asa child, she had
been idolized in her hometown...

137
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,730
during a religious celebration.

138
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,160
It started almost like a dream.

139
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,330
As your host, I propose...

140
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,400
that we would abolish
all formalities forever...

141
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,300
by drinking my best wine
in brotherhood.

142
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,180
Instead of linking arms
in the usual way...

143
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,810
let us touch feet under the table.

144
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,520
Jules was happy
and moved his feet away.

145
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,020
Jim's foot stayed near Catherine's.

146
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,390
She moved hers away first.

147
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,330
Jules smiled happily...

148
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,660
as he beamed at the others.

149
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,130
Jules vanished for a month.

150
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,710
He saw Catherine alone...

151
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,070
but the two friends
met at the gymnasium.

152
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,840
Excellent.

153
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,650
Why don't you spend the evening
with Catherine and me?

154
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,320
I've talked about you so much...

155
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,490
Catherine is anxious
to know you better...

156
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,260
but not this one,Jim. Okay?

157
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,430
Hello, Mr.Jim.

158
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,110
Pronounce his name in English,
not French.

159
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,820
"Jeem" doesn't suit him.

160
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,420
Do you like our friend Thomas?

161
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,090
Can we go out with him?

162
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,400
Not bad. A moustache would help.

163
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,140
Now for a test in the street.

164
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,900
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a match?

165
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,640
Thank you, sir.

166
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,840
She was proud
of her clever disguise.

167
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,110
The men were moved,
but didn't really understand why.

168
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,510
- Either it's raining or I'm dreaming!
- It might be both.

169
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,290
Then if it's raining,
let's go to the seashore.

170
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,850
We go tomorrow.

171
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,890
Let's have a race.

172
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,700
First one to the end of the bridge.

173
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,520
- You cheated.
- But I won.

174
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,930
Thomas always wins.

175
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,900
He speaks three languages,
he swims like a fish.

176
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,560
Can he stand on his hands?

177
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,000
You'll teach him.

178
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,410
Can you come to my flat tomorrow...

179
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,910
to help take my baggage
to the station?

180
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,180
She's a strange breed.

181
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,850
Her father was an aristocrat,
her mother wasn't.

182
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,260
He came from Burgundy.
Her mother was English.

183
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,850
That's why she's not average...

184
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,290
and she teaches everyone.

185
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,870
- Teaches what?
- Shakespeare.

186
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,170
Jim took it for granted
that she belonged to Jules.

187
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,040
Catherine wore that calm smile.

188
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,080
It was natural and said everything.

189
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,410
I'm almost ready.
I just have to put on my dress.

190
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,490
- Never put a hat on a bed.
- Do we take the bike?

191
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,560
And the bag, too?

192
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,830
- What are you doing?
- I want to burn lies.

193
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,670
Give me a match.

194
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,540
- Oh, my God!
- Don't move.

195
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,160
- Are you alright?
- Hand me the dress.

196
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,530
It's by the bed.

197
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,440
- Got a broom?
- It's under your nose.

198
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,800
Can you help me?

199
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,380
Thanks.

200
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,010
We'll take this, too.

201
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,680
What is it?

202
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,520
Vitriol, for the eyes of men who lie.

203
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,430
That bottle will break
and ruin your things.

204
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,690
Besides, you can buy Vitriol anywhere.

205
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,930
- Is that true?
- Yes.

206
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,030
But not this bottle.

207
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,430
I swore I'd only use this bottle.

208
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,950
It took them a while...

209
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,510
to find the house of their dreams
along the coast.

210
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,780
It was too big and isolated,
solemn, white, and empty.

211
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,390
- Sleep well?
- Very well.

212
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,760
- Is Jim awake?
- I don't know.

213
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,630
- How is everyone else?
- Everyone else is fine.

214
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,770
What a nice day.

215
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,700
Hurry, let's go to the beach.

216
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,240
Let's find the last signs
of civilization.

217
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,080
A piece of tire.

218
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,130
- Look, a bottle!
- An old shoe.

219
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,530
A can!
Watch out back there.

220
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,280
Look, Catherine.

221
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,490
Watch out, it's steep.

222
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,230
A postcard.

223
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,700
A piece of porcelain.

224
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,810
A cup and a cigarette butt.

225
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,980
- A pack of English cigarettes.
- I'm afraid we're lost, kids.

226
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,470
Do you think I should marry her?

227
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,560
Answer me honestly.

228
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,110
Is she cut out
to be a wife and mother?

229
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,870
I'm afraid she will never
be happy on this earth.

230
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,350
She has a vision. Maybe
she can't belong to just one man.

231
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,580
- Let's go.
- No.

232
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,420
This time, I won't move.
I give up.

233
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,430
Help me, kids.

234
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,250
Let's go, kids.

235
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,080
At last, I read a book I liked.

236
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,810
A writer, a German, of course...

237
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,620
who dares to say out loud
what I think inside.

238
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,350
The sky that we see is merely
a small hollow ball...

239
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,430
no bigger than that.

240
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,560
And we walk
with our heads towards the center.

241
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,310
The attraction pulls towards
the outside under our feet...

242
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,610
towards that solid crust
in which the bubble is enclosed.

243
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,690
How thick is the crust
and what's beyond it?

244
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,760
Go and see.

245
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,490
That's not a question
to discuss between gentlemen.

246
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,300
Answer me tomorrow, Catherine.

247
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,810
If you say no...

248
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,570
I will ask you every year again
on your birthday.

249
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,240
You've known few women.

250
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,250
I've known plenty ofmen.
It averages out.

251
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,290
We might make an honest couple.

252
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,000
I've proposed to her.
She almost said yes.

253
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,380
At fifteen,
I was in love with Napoleon.

254
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,480
I dreamt I met him in an elevator.

255
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,520
We had a child
and I never saw him again.

256
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,890
Poor Napoleon.

257
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,920
I was taught:
Our father who arts in heaven.

258
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,760
I thought it said arts.

259
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,700
I imagined my father with an easel
painting in Paradise.

260
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,440
I believe I've said something funny.

261
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,240
At least, amusing.
You might try to smile.

262
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,480
Will anyone present
scratch my back?

263
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,960
The Lord scratches
those who scratch themselves.

264
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,230
The Lord scratches those...

265
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,730
You two taught me how to laugh.

266
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,570
Before, I always looked glum.

267
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,570
But that's all over.

268
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,990
It's raining. Come and see.

269
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,830
I miss Paris.
Let's go back, please.

270
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,060
We'll be there tomorrow night.

271
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,390
I've sold my book.

272
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,360
This is for Catherine.

273
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,300
This is for both of you.

274
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,440
- What is it?
- A back-scratcher.

275
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,580
I'm taking you
to the theater tonight.

276
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,550
- What will we see?
- A new Swedish play.

277
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,690
It starts at nine.

278
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,960
When the sand stops,
we'll get dressed.

279
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,060
Jim saw his friends often.

280
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,610
He liked to be with them.

281
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,730
Jules' two pillows
were now side by side.

282
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,280
Catherine learned to live again.

283
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,090
I still like that girl.

284
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,530
She wants to be free.
She invents her own life.

285
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,000
- Doesn't Jim agree?
- No.

286
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,440
It's a confused
and self-indulging play.

287
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,170
The writer revels in vice
to preach virtue.

288
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,500
We don't even know
when or where it's taking place.

289
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,600
He doesn't say
if the heroine is a virgin.

290
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,770
That's not important.

291
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,550
Usually not, but since he explains
that the hero is impotent...

292
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,990
that his brother is gay
and that the sister is a nymphomaniac...

293
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,560
why should he dismiss the heroine?

294
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,590
That's all in your mind.

295
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,220
Yes, and you help us think ofit.

296
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,790
No psychology tonight.

297
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,700
It's not psychology,
it's metaphysics.

298
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,240
In a couple,
the wife must be faithful.

299
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,710
The husband doesn't count.

300
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:04,040
Who wrote: "Woman is natural,
therefore abominable?"

301
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,120
Baudelaire. But he meant
a certain class.

302
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,580
Not at all.
He meant women in general.

303
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,880
Here's how he describes
a young girl:

304
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,760
"Monster, assassin of the arts.
Little fool, little slut.

305
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,390
A blend of idiocy and depravity."

306
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,690
Wait, that's not all.
This is marvelous:

307
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,170
"I wonder why women are
allowed to enter churches.

308
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,440
What could they hope
to say to God?"

309
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,140
- You're a pair of fools.
- I haven't said anything.

310
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,810
And I don't approve
of wha tJules says at 2 in the morning.

311
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,180
- Then protest!
- I am protesting.

312
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,160
Jim never forgot thatjump.

313
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,530
He drew it the next day,
though he was not anartist.

314
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,690
His admiration for Catherine
struck him like lightning...

315
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,770
as he blew her an invisible kiss.

316
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,840
He didn't worry.

317
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,600
He was swimming with her mentally,
and held his breath to frighten Jules.

318
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,910
Catherine, why?

319
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,110
You're crazy.

320
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,330
Her hat drifted away.

321
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,600
Jules was pale, silent,
unsure of himself, and more handsome.

322
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,340
Catherine had a triumphant smile.

323
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,980
No one spoke about her jump.

324
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,850
- I've arrived.
- Please, Mr.Jim.

325
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,120
- No, just Jim.
-Just Jim.

326
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,290
I want to ask you some advice.

327
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,460
Can you meet me tomorrow
at 7 in our cafe?

328
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,660
Yes.

329
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,040
- She wants to talk to you.
- Right, I'll be there at 7.

330
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,430
- Are you joking?
- I never joke.

331
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,800
I've no sense ofhumor.

332
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,700
I know people who have.
My wife's friends, working relations.

333
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,570
But personally, I never joke.

334
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,640
Jim was late, as usual,
because he was an optimist.

335
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,840
He was afraid she had already left.

336
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,320
Jim thought.: 'A girllike that...

337
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,050
would probably not have waited.

338
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,250
A girl like that
might have just walked in...

339
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,490
without noticing me
behind my newspaper, and left."

340
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,500
He kept repeating:
'A girl like that."

341
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,260
But what was she like?

342
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,530
For the first time,
he began to think ofher.

343
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,680
Another coffee, please.

344
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,710
Another glass.

345
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,530
Did I wake you up, Jim?

346
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,090
We're going to my country,
to get married.

347
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,570
Tell her I'm sorry I was late.
I waited almost till 8.

348
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,110
She's more optimistic than you.

349
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,180
She was at the hairdresser...

350
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,650
and arrived at 8
to have dinner with you.

351
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,120
If I had known she'd come,
I could have waited until midnight.

352
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,060
Catherine wants to speak to you.

353
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,060
I'm very happy, Jim.

354
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,760
Jules will teach me French boxing.

355
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,600
With an Austrian accent.

356
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,900
I've lost my accent!
My French is perfect!

357
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,600
Listen to the Marseillaise.

358
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,940
A few days later, war was declared.

359
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,980
Jules and Jim were separated
by their uniforms...

360
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,780
and lost touch for a long time.

361
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,770
The war was neverending.

362
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,210
Gradually, it became
like a normal life...

363
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,310
tempered by the different seasons.

364
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,620
A normal life with deadbeats, routines,
pauses, and even distractions.

365
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,530
Gilberte sent parcels to Jim.

366
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,370
He almost saw her a few times,
but each time his leave was canceled.

367
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,270
Then, in 1916,
he spent a week in Paris.

368
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,050
Don't marry me for my parcels.
We're fine as we are.

369
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,090
All right,
but I know this will last.

370
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,250
- How is Jules?
- No news of him since his wedding.

371
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,350
Sometimes, I'm afraid
I'll kill Jules during a battle.

372
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,100
My darling...

373
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,170
In ever stop thinking of you.

374
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,710
Not of your soul.
I don't believe in it anymore.

375
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,540
But of your body...

376
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,580
and our son who is inside you.

377
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,890
I've no more envelopes.
I don't know how to mail this letter.

378
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,760
I am going to the Russian front.

379
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,870
It will be tough...

380
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,530
but I prefer it because
I was afraid to kill Jim here.

381
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,270
My darling...

382
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,310
let me kiss you.

383
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,370
Jules' country lost the war.
Jim's had won.

384
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,970
But they were both victorious
since they were alive.

385
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,210
They began to write each other again.

386
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,940
Catherine and Jules lived
in a cottage near the Rhine.

387
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,450
They had a daughter, Sabine.

388
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:44,510
Jim wrote Jules.: "Tell me,
should I marry and have children, too?"

389
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,720
Jules replied.:
"Come and judge for yourself."

390
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,730
Catherine signed the invitation.

391
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,430
Jim left,
buthe delayed his arrival.

392
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,970
He walked along the Rhine,
and stopped in several towns.

393
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,900
He was writing about Germany
after the war for a Paris paper.

394
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,210
He wanted to see
his battlegrounds again.

395
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,910
In some places, the land
had been bombarded so heavily...

396
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,280
that nothing could ever
grow on it again.

397
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,320
They became cemeteries where Jim
looked on graves for familiar names...

398
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,660
cemeteries that were being shown
to school children.

399
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,040
Catherine was waiting at the station
with her daughter.

400
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,080
Her eyes were shining with joy.

401
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,760
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Catherine.

402
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,890
- This is Sabine.
- Hello, Mr.Jim.

403
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,030
Let's go.
Jules is anxious to see you.

404
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,670
Her deep voice made Jim think
she had finally made their date...

405
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,740
and had dressed up
especially for him.

406
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,870
She took him to their cottage,
surrounded by pines and near a hill.

407
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,170
- How are the others?
- Oh, the others, you know.

408
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,420
- You haven't changed, Jim.
- You haven't changed, Jules.

409
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,220
So, no one has changed.

410
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,300
Sit down.

411
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,740
Come here, Sabine.

412
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,030
No, thanks.

413
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,790
- You want some?
-Just a little.

414
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,400
No, thanks. I stopped smoking
when I started to love plants.

415
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,050
An angel is passing by.

416
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,900
Of course, it's twenty past one.

417
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,260
So?

418
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,130
Angels always pass by
at twenty past.

419
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,570
- I didn't know that.
- Neither did I.

420
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,640
At twenty past
and twenty to as well.

421
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,380
Soyou won the war, you louse.

422
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,220
I'd rather have won this.

423
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,360
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

424
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,530
Afterwards, I'll show you the house.

425
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,570
Jim here, Jules over there.
And Sabine next to me.

426
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,510
How is your new novel?

427
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,450
These articles won't let me finish it.

428
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,690
I work on them all week,
write them Friday night...

429
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,590
and send them airmail
the next day. And you?

430
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,600
I am doing a book on dragonflies.

431
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,030
I am writing it for a publisher.

432
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,870
Catherine is illustrating it.

433
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,930
Even Sabine helps.
She goes with me into the swamps.

434
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,270
I'm going to build
a pond in the garden.

435
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,320
One day, perhaps, I may become literary
and write a love story...

436
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,020
with insects as characters.

437
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:48,490
I have a bad tendency to specialize.

438
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,650
I admire your versatility,J im.

439
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:57,930
Oh, me, I'm a failure. Sorel,
my teacher, taught me all I know.

440
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,040
"What do you want to do," he asked me.
I said I wanted to be a diplomat.

441
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,240
"Do you have money?"
"No."

442
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:08,250
"Areyou related to anyone famous?"
"No."

443
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,250
"Then forget about diplomacy!"
"But what can I become?"

444
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,220
"Curious."
"That's no career."

445
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,980
"Not yet.

446
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,350
Travel, write, translate.

447
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,690
Learn to live anywhere,
beginning now.

448
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,820
There's a future in it.

449
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,870
The French have ignored the world
for too long.

450
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,140
A paper will always
pay for your fun."

451
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,640
Jules thinks you have
a bright future.

452
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,650
So do I,
but it may not be spectacular.

453
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,810
Jules works and sleeps here.

454
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,860
We're as organized as a monastery.

455
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,790
Jules writes his books...

456
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,350
and hunts his insects.

457
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,730
Mathilde, who you saw,
comes from a nearby farm.

458
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,630
She helps me
with the house and Sabine.

459
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,400
My room.

460
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,370
That's Jules!

461
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,250
Yes, his father liked Mozart so much
that he once disguised him as Mozart.

462
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,110
Here is the balcony.

463
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,630
Over there is the inn
where you'll sleep.

464
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,700
Jules will take you there later.

465
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,670
Jules and Jim
carried on their conversation.

466
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:49,170
They talked about the war.
Jules avoided talking about his family.

467
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,370
Catherine was kind and stough...

468
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,110
but Jim felt something was wrong.

469
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,580
To bed, sleepyhead.

470
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,220
Once upon a time...

471
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,900
there was a little sleepyhead...

472
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,990
- Good night, Sabine.
- Good night, Jim. See you tomorrow.

473
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,310
- Good night, Jules.
- I want to talk to you.

474
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:32,470
- What doyou think of her?
- Marriage and motherhood suit her.

475
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,710
She's less of a grasshopper
and more of an ant.

476
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,710
Be careful.

477
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,360
True, she keeps order in our home.

478
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,890
But if things go too smoothly,
she changes.

479
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,770
She becomes a tyrant in her words.

480
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,170
Yes, she has a Napoleonic side.

481
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,600
She believes the world is rich...

482
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,040
and that one can cheat a little.

483
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,840
She begs God
to forgive her in advance.

484
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,210
She is sure that He will.

485
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,820
I'm afraid she'll leave us.

486
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:15,480
- Impossible!
- No, she has done it already.

487
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,290
It lasted 6 months.
I gave up hope.

488
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,660
She's ready to do it again.

489
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,270
She's not really my wife,Jim.

490
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,800
She has had three lovers.

491
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:32,340
One was a fling the day before
ourwedding, to bury her youth.

492
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,170
And one as revenge
for something I did.

493
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,750
I don't know what.

494
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,140
I'm not the man she needs...

495
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,550
and she won't accept that.

496
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,020
I'm used to her
being unfaithful to me at times...

497
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,290
but I couldn't stand to see her go.

498
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,860
- But there's Albert.
- The singer who found the statue?

499
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,430
Yes, it was he who showed it to us.

500
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,060
He was wounded in the war.

501
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,200
He's convalescing
in a village near here.

502
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,080
Catherine encourages him
and gives him hope.

503
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,250
He has spoken about her to me.

504
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,950
He wants to marry her
and take the child.

505
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:19,390
I hold no grudge against him.

506
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:21,720
I have nothing against him nor her.

507
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,060
I am slowly renouncing her...

508
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,290
and all I had expected from the world.

509
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:33,630
That's what she likes about you.
That Buddhist side of yours.

510
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,330
She's usually kind and generous...

511
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,140
but when she thinks
she is not appreciated...

512
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,710
she becomes terrible, and suddenly
goes from one extreme to the other...

513
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,650
with sudden attacks.

514
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,220
Listen to that mole-cricket.

515
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,090
It's like a mole.

516
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:59,450
Jim could see the cottage
from his bedroom window.

517
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,000
Catherine was there,
a queen ready to flee.

518
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,830
Jim wasn't surprised.

519
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,870
He recalled Jules' mistakes
with other girls.

520
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,310
Catherine, he knew, was precise.

521
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:13,640
Jim felt sorry for Jules,
but he could not condemn her.

522
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,610
She jumped at men
the way she had jumped into the river.

523
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,810
The house was under a cloud.

524
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,990
Another week began.

525
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,760
- Time to go to bed, Sabine.
- Okay, Mommy.

526
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,890
I need to speak to you later,Jim.
Will you be free?

527
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,870
Words change meaning
from one language to another...

528
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,560
when they change gender.

529
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:19,630
In German, war and death are masculine,
unlike in French...

530
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,780
while sun and love are feminine.

531
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,580
- Life is neuter.
- Life is neuter?

532
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:34,780
Very pretty and very logical.

533
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,670
Skirts became short in France, too,
during the war.

534
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,430
Married soldiers hatedthat.

535
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,840
They felt betrayed...

536
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,000
but it was because
the fabric was scarce.

537
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,440
Yes, and women
cut their hair short...

538
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,340
to avoid danger in factories.

539
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:01,680
It's timeyou start to
appreciate German beer, Jim.

540
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,950
Jim is like me! He's French.
He couldn't care less about German beer.

541
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,920
- Not at all.
- What?

542
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,480
French wines are the best in Europe,
in the world even.

543
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,960
Look at the clarets:
Chateau Lafite, Chateau Margaux.

544
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,730
That's not all. There are others.

545
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,710
The burgundies: Romane, Chambertin...

546
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,400
Beaume, Pommard, Chablis, Volnais.

547
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:30,500
And Beaujolais wines:
Pouilly-Fuisse...

548
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,810
Moulin a Vent, Fleurie,
Morgon, Saint Amour.

549
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,520
We stared at the shell
as it rolled down the steps.

550
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,820
Three steps, two steps.
Lie down.

551
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,550
Catch me.

552
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,850
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing. I want to listen.

553
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,980
- To judge me?
- Certainly not.

554
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,390
I have nothing to tell you.
I want to question you.

555
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:26,070
The question is:
tell me about Jim.

556
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,010
- Okay, but tell you what?
- Anything, but tell me point-blank.

557
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,740
Jim told of two young men
which he didn't name...

558
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:38,300
and told the story
of their friendship in Paris...

559
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,180
and how they met a certain girl.

560
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:47,050
He told of... Not that one, Jim.
There, he had to say his own name.

561
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,820
He told of their friendship,
of their trip by the sea.

562
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:53,460
Catherine saw that Jim remembered
everything about her.

563
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,400
She argued on a few points
and added other details.

564
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,530
He described their date, told her
how he perceived all three of them.

565
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,600
He said he always knew
that Jules could never keep Catherine.

566
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:09,610
- You'd have said that in the cafe?
- Yes.

567
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,420
- Go on.
- That's all there is.

568
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,550
There was the war...

569
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,290
my joy to see Jules again,
my seeing you at the station...

570
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,690
the happy days
I've spent with you here...

571
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,390
what I have seen, what I have learned,
what I have guessed...

572
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,930
that pending cloud, I mean Albert.

573
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:32,970
- Areyou against me?
- No more thanJules is.

574
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,210
Let me tell
my side ofthe story now.

575
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:41,010
Jules conquered me
with his generosity...

576
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,840
his innocence, and his vulnerability.

577
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,420
He was such a contrast to other men.

578
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,480
I hoped to cure him
of his insecurities...

579
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,460
but I learned
they were part ofhim.

580
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,720
We were happy,
but our happiness did not last...

581
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:02,790
and we became two people, not one.

582
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,830
His family was torture for me.

583
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,370
At a reception before our wedding...

584
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:14,000
Jules' mother
offended me very deeply.

585
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,170
Jules said nothing.

586
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,240
I punished him by spending a few hours
with an old lover, Harold.

587
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,180
Yes, a lover.

588
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:27,780
So I was able to marry Jules
with all accounts squared.

589
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:31,990
Luckily, his family moved away.

590
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,190
The war broke out.
Jules went to the Russian front.

591
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,900
He wrote me love letters,
wonderful letters.

592
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:44,570
I loved him more at a distance.
He became a saint again.

593
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,270
Things reallywent wrong
during his first leave.

594
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,910
I felt as if i was
in the arms of a stranger.

595
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,920
He left: Sabine was born
nine months later.

596
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,510
She doesn't lookvery much like Jules.

597
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,880
Believe what you want,
but she's his.

598
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:01,320
I said, "I've given you a child.
That's enough.

599
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:04,950
I want my own bedroom.
I want my own freedom."

600
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,530
Remember our friend, Fortunio?

601
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,270
He was free. So was I.

602
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:14,770
He was a sweet partner.
What a vacation.

603
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:18,040
But he was tooyoung to be serious.

604
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,640
One day, to my surprise...

605
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,970
I missed Jules and his indulgence.

606
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,140
My daughter attracted me
like a magnet.

607
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,690
I left.

608
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,310
I've been back for three months.

609
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,760
Jules is no longer my husband.

610
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:42,320
Don't feel sorry for him.
My presence alone satisfies him.

611
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,260
Then there is Albert.

612
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:49,430
He told me ofthat statue you loved
which resembles me.

613
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,010
I flirted with him.

614
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:54,840
He can be strange, but he has
a natural strength that Jules doesn't.

615
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:58,780
He wants to leave everything,
marry me and take me and my daughter.

616
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,280
So far, I like him. That's all.

617
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:04,250
He's coming to lunch tomorrow.
I'll see.

618
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,020
I talked more than you did.

619
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,030
I didn't say everything.
Neither did you.

620
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,290
Perhaps I've had other men.
That's my business.

621
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,130
I spoke only of what you mentioned.

622
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,790
- I understand.
- I don't want you to.

623
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,230
It's almost dawn.

624
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:24,530
Jim desired her,
but he kept repressing that desire.

625
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,510
She had to stay.
Was Jim acting for Jules?

626
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:31,580
Or for himself?.
He would never know.

627
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:42,230
Perhaps she was seducing him,
although Jim was unsure.

628
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:47,290
But she revealed her goals
only when she achieved them.

629
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,610
- Hello, Sabine.
- Hello, Albert.

630
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:05,270
- How are you? How is your mother?
- Fine.

631
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:14,790
Hello, Albert.

632
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,450
- You sacrificed your moustache?
- Yes, everyone did.

633
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,860
But I don't like it.
Now I feel naked.

634
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:24,560
I'll let it grow back.

635
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,040
Albert was wounded...

636
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,540
in the trenches.

637
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,870
I'm all right now,
but when I woke up...

638
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,670
and saw the doctors probing inside
my skull, I thought of Oscar Wilde.

639
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,940
God, spare me physical pain.

640
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,280
I'll take care ofthe moral pain.

641
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,510
What's revolting about war...

642
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,880
is that it deprives man
of his own individual battle.

643
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:49,480
Yes, but even in the midst of war,
he can fight it.

644
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,090
I knew a soldier in the hospital.

645
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,660
On leave, he met a girl on a train.

646
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,030
They talked between Nice and Marseilles.

647
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,040
She left and gave him her address.

648
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,240
Well, he wrote her every day
for two years from the trenches...

649
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,570
by candle light, during battles.

650
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,550
His letters became more intimate.

651
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,350
At first, he wrote: "Dear Miss,"
and ended with, "Yours truly."

652
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:20,020
Soon he called her "My little lamb"
and asked for her picture.

653
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,490
Then she became "My adorable lamb."
First: "I kiss your hand."

654
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,360
Then: "Your forehead."

655
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,230
She sent him a picture...

656
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:32,390
and he wrote that he could see
her breasts through her robe.

657
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,170
He became more blunt.
"I love you terribly."

658
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:40,040
He wrote to her mother
and proposed marriage.

659
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:44,240
He became her fiance
without having seen her again.

660
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:48,250
As the war continued,
his letters became more intimate.

661
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:52,590
"I take you, my love.
I hold your adorable breasts.

662
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,520
I hold you naked against my body."

663
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,650
She wrote a cold letter,
and he begged her to be serious...

664
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,560
for he could die at any time,
and he was right.

665
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:07,300
This mad affair
by correspondence could exist...

666
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:10,270
only in the violence
of trench warfare...

667
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,780
with death always nearby.

668
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,880
So this man fought the war...

669
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:21,470
but he fought
his own battle as well...

670
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:24,850
and he won a woman by mail.

671
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,090
He had a head wound, too,
when he arrived at the hospital...

672
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:31,160
but he was less lucky.

673
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:34,600
He died the day
before the Armistice.

674
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,600
In his last letter, he wrote her...

675
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,670
"Your breasts are
the only bombs I've loved."

676
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:44,330
I'll show you some photos of him.

677
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,540
If you flip through them quickly,
he seems to be moving.

678
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,130
Pretty story.

679
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:51,080
Jules wrote me
beautiful letters too.

680
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,810
Hello, Albert.
Have you finished my song?

681
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,820
Let's go upstairs
and work on it together.

682
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,910
A rocking chair
has a rhythm of its own.

683
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,280
- What about the song?
- It's almost ready.

684
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:32,050
Yes. Let's go.

685
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,260
It's too good for them...

686
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,560
but we've no other audience.

687
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:51,710
She wore rings on every finger

688
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:54,400
More bracelets than I can tell

689
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:57,070
And she was the kind of singer

690
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,980
To put me under a spell

691
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,880
She had eyes, eyes of opal

692
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:05,350
They fascinated me

693
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,790
Her pale face was an oval

694
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,950
What a fatal femme fatale

695
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,530
We met with a kiss

696
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,900
A hit, then a miss

697
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,230
It wasn't all bliss

698
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,770
Andweparted

699
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,210
We went our own ways

700
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,610
In life's whirlpool of days

701
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:30,080
I saw her again one night

702
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,650
Again she was an enchanted sight

703
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,580
I recognized her after a while

704
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,950
By her mysterious smile

705
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,320
Her face in an oval
Her eyes of opal

706
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,790
Affected me more than ever

707
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,230
I drank as I heard her sing

708
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:50,630
Alcohol lets time lose its sting

709
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,000
I drank far too much

710
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,600
I awoke to her touch

711
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,110
We met with a kiss

712
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,340
A hit, then a miss

713
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:05,680
It wasn't all bliss

714
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,150
But we started

715
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,580
We wentour own ways

716
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,880
In life's whirlpool of days

717
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:15,220
Again I saw her one night

718
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,790
Again her smile was alight

719
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,330
When you kiss

720
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,530
Why miss

721
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,630
When you return

722
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:30,210
Why be stern

723
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,500
Together, we make our ways

724
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:34,740
In life's whirlpool of days

725
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:37,080
We go round and round

726
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:41,880
Together bound
Together bound

727
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:53,520
Each saw her in his own light.
She couldn't please them all.

728
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,290
Jim couldonly admire
Catherine alone.

729
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,890
He felt he was in the way.

730
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,190
- Good night.
- Good night.

731
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,690
Our affection is new. We should
let it rest like a newborn baby.

732
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:28,290
You were in love, Jim.
I can feel that.

733
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,270
- Why didn't you marry her?
- It didn't work out.

734
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:34,070
- What is she like?
- Quiet and patient.

735
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:37,300
Gilberte says she'll wait
for me forever.

736
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:39,380
You still love her,
and she loves you?

737
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:45,740
- Don't make her suffer.
- I need adventures and risks.

738
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,710
There's been a change too.

739
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:57,050
I admire you.
I enjoy seeing you.

740
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,430
- I'm afraid I'll forget Jules.
- You must not forget him.

741
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:01,930
Warn him.

742
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,800
Translate that!

743
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:16,350
The yearnings of two hearts
create such heavenly pain.

744
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:18,940
Not bad.

745
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:23,180
Though you added the heavenly.
Good night.

746
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,980
Give my regards to the others.

747
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:29,220
I'd like to read Goethe tonight.
May I have it?

748
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:32,520
- I lent it to Jim.
- Too bad.

749
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,230
- Good night,Jim.
- Good night.

750
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,270
I'll bring it tomorrow.

751
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,950
You must bring it now.

752
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,220
She insists on reading it tonight.

753
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:05,460
Jim, she doesn't want me anymore.

754
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:10,100
I'm afraid she will disappear
from my life.

755
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,300
The last time I saw you with her...

756
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,670
you looked like a couple.

757
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,900
Love her, marry her...

758
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:20,030
and let me see her.

759
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,600
I mean, if you love her,
don't think I'm an obstacle.

760
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,420
Jim had waited for her all day.

761
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,890
She came into his arms gravely.

762
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,290
Their first kiss lasted all night.

763
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,760
They were silent
as they drew close.

764
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:50,800
Later, they remained silent.

765
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:54,340
Her face expressed
strange joy and curiosity.

766
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,340
Jim was prisoner.

767
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,670
No other woman existed for him.

768
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:04,310
Your turn.

769
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:27,930
I've asked Jim
to move into the house.

770
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,100
He'll take the small room.

771
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,710
Careful, Jim.

772
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:40,780
Be careful for both of you.

773
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,920
This is your room.

774
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:19,150
The books are in German,
but I've got others in my room.

775
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,720
I'll unpack your bag.
I think it will do.

776
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:28,890
The rest is a mess...

777
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,930
but we can't help that.

778
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:35,770
- What is on the other side?
- Sabine and Mathilde's room.

779
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,710
The bed isn't too bad.

780
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:47,010
Sit down next to me.

781
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,890
I've always liked
the nape of your neck.

782
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:57,650
That was the only part ofyou
I could look at without being seen.

783
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,120
What about Jules?

784
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,190
He loves us both.

785
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:33,490
This won't surprise him.
He won't suffer.

786
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,590
We shall love him and respect him.

787
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:43,100
In the village they were
known as the three lunatics...

788
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:45,140
but they were accepted.

789
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,300
When she found that out, Catherine
invented a game: the village idiot.

790
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:51,750
The village was the table.
They took turns as the idiot.

791
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:54,320
Sabine made them laugh.

792
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,920
Catherine believed
that love was short...

793
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:32,580
but constantly recurring.

794
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,750
Life was a vacation
for all of them.

795
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:38,230
Jules and Jim
had never lived so intensely.

796
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:40,300
Time went by.

797
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,460
Happiness can't be told, but
it wears off without anyone noticing it.

798
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,640
One day, she decided
to seduce Jules.

799
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:49,730
While Jim was reading downstairs...

800
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,070
she took Jules into her room.

801
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,410
Jules said no,
but Catherine said yes.

802
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:26,510
Jim said he wasn't jealous,
but he was.

803
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:30,410
She saw this and never
repeated the experiment.

804
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,110
One day, they walked around a lake...

805
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:37,420
hidden in them is to a green valley.

806
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,580
The harmony between them was perfect.

807
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:43,460
Catherine had a headache,
so did Jim.

808
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,690
If they had children, he thought,
they would be tall...

809
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,160
thin and have headaches too.

810
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,670
They played on the shore
of the lake.

811
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:55,930
She made him throw stones. She and
Jules learned how to skip stones.

812
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,030
The sky was so close to them.

813
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:12,720
Jim had to return to Paris.

814
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,720
His paper needed him.

815
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:18,260
But they knew he would return...

816
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,260
and things would remain the same.

817
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,360
Their perfect month
was engraved into them.

818
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,840
They waved at each other as he left.

819
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:33,470
Jules gave them his blessings
and promised to take care ofher...

820
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,070
for they wanted to marry.

821
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:47,250
Jules is willing to divorce.

822
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,720
I'm going to marry Catherine.

823
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:52,390
I want to have children with her.

824
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,120
Jules will find me work
in his country.

825
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:59,360
Right now, I'm translating
an Austrian play.

826
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:03,570
Where are you going?

827
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:05,610
- Home.
- I'll go with you.

828
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:08,230
I'd rather you didn't.

829
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,350
Hello,Jim.

830
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:18,790
It's me, Therese.
The steam engine.

831
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:21,480
Therese, how are you?
How is...

832
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,150
It lasted two weeks.
I cheated on him.

833
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:27,420
He found out, got jealous,
stopped trusting me.

834
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:30,020
He locked me up for three weeks.

835
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:32,570
I was flattered, then furious.

836
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,970
I got out on a painter's ladder
with the painter.

837
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:37,630
I got impatient.
A guy wants to make me rich.

838
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,640
I follow him to Cairo
where he puts me up in a house.

839
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,150
An Englishman rescues me.

840
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:49,950
I move into his villa by the Red Sea,
play tennis, ride horses.

841
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:52,610
Then I get a letter.

842
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,350
- Hello, isJules in Paris?
- No, he didn't come.

843
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:59,290
I go to wreck the wedding.
I marry him.

844
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,390
Hello, Jim. How is your buddy?

845
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,760
- Still with the same girl?
- Always.

846
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:08,770
He was serious.
He thought I wasn't.

847
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:11,400
My husband divorced me finally.

848
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:13,740
My undertaker married me.

849
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,970
It's a perfect marriage,
but no children.

850
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,640
I've neither time nor energy
to be unfaithful.

851
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:24,880
So I'm writing my memoirs for
the Sunday Times Magazine in Europe.

852
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:27,220
My husband.

853
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:31,790
- What about you,Jim?
- I'm getting married.

854
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:44,210
- How's Jules?
- All right.

855
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,140
Interesting, isn't she?
Her name is Denise.

856
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,650
She won't talk to you.

857
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:55,620
She never talks.
She's not stupid.

858
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:59,350
She's empty.
It's all empty in there.

859
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:02,020
- She's a thing.
- Pretty thing.

860
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:05,030
Yes, beautiful. It's just sex.

861
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,030
Pure sex.

862
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:11,830
- Say good-bye, Denise.
- Sir.

863
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:19,270
Catherine spent the winter at home
in front of the fire place.

864
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,940
She was Jim's fiancee,
on loan to Jules.

865
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:23,950
Every day she asked Jules...

866
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:26,020
"Do you thinkJ im loves me?"

867
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,320
Listen to me, Gilberte.

868
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:33,250
If Catherine wants something...

869
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,220
and she thinks
no one will be hurt...

870
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,950
she may be wrong,
but she'll do it...

871
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,530
to learn from the experience.

872
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:44,470
It's her way of achieving wisdom.

873
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:46,660
That can last a long time.

874
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,670
Don't be mean.

875
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:52,400
I'm not mean. I'm jealous.

876
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:57,050
I knew it would end this way.

877
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,480
Don't leave tomorrow.

878
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:04,880
You'll give her your life,
so just give me one more week.

879
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:09,290
Jim couldn't leave Gilberte.
Catherine couldn't leave Jules.

880
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:11,860
They couldn't hurt
Jules or Gilberte...

881
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,520
who belonged to the past
and who each played the same role.

882
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:19,860
"Tell Jules I saw Therese.
She's married and is writing.

883
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:22,170
I have to delay
my trip back once again...

884
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,830
but soon I'll be free,
ready for you.

885
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:27,930
I must still say a few good-byes.

886
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:31,480
A few good-byes."

887
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,510
Do you think Jim loves me?

888
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,880
- Hello, Jules.
- Hello.

889
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:45,790
What's wrong?

890
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,730
Why didn't Catherine
come to meet me?

891
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:53,000
She disliked your letters. You talked
about your work, your good-byes.

892
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,560
She didn't like your absence.
You were gone too long.

893
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:59,470
When she is in doubt,
she can do anything.

894
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:03,270
- Is she waiting for us?
- Yes, I think so.

895
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,910
I didn't want to tell you.

896
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:38,640
She left yesterday morning
without saying a word.

897
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:42,380
I had hoped that she would
be back before your arrival.

898
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:44,480
Aren't you worried?

899
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:47,820
You mean, is she in danger?

900
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,890
She is merely doing
something irreparable.

901
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,200
I told you,
she disliked your letters.

902
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,790
"Therese is married
and has become a writer.

903
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:03,870
I must say a few good-byes."

904
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,640
No, Catherine never
does anything halfway.

905
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:13,680
She's an irresistible force
that can't be stopped.

906
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,750
Her harmony is never
shaken because...

907
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:19,380
she knows she is always innocent.

908
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:23,120
-You speak ofher as if she was a queen.
-She is a queen.

909
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:26,190
Let me be frank.

910
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:30,230
She's not especially beautiful
or intelligent or sincere...

911
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:32,300
but she is a real woman.

912
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,530
And that is why we love her...

913
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,900
and all men desire her.

914
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:42,340
Despite this,
why did she make us a gift...

915
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,570
of her presence?

916
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,480
Because we treated her
like a queen.

917
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:51,550
You know, I almost stayed in Paris.

918
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:54,450
I knew it could never last.

919
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,550
Even our friendship suffers.

920
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,430
At times, I'm jealous
of your years with her.

921
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:04,260
And I hate you
for not being jealous of me.

922
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,560
Do you believe that?

923
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:10,970
I'll do anything
not to lose her completely.

924
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:13,340
You will, too, when she returns...

925
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,380
for she always returns.

926
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,920
Listen, I'm going back to Paris.

927
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:22,010
Tell her you didn't see me
at the station.

928
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,420
It's the only solution.

929
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:31,450
I see. I met the train,
but you weren't on it.

930
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,770
Hello. What's the matter?

931
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,150
You've just arrived.

932
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:57,710
You're mine and I'm yours.
All is well.

933
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:00,380
But in your letters,
you said you had things to do.

934
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:04,020
So did I.
You said good-bye to your loves.

935
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,890
I decided to say good-bye to mine.

936
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,960
You'll hold me in your arms
all night long, but that's all.

937
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:14,200
We want a child, don't we?

938
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,430
Well, if i had one now,
I wouldn't know ifit was yours.

939
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,440
Do you understand?

940
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:24,670
- I had to do it.
- Doyou love Albert?

941
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:27,250
- No.
- Does he love you?

942
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:33,080
Yes. You must believe me.
It was your only chance.

943
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:36,130
Albert equals Gilberte.

944
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,350
You don't say anything?

945
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,790
We must start with a clean slate.

946
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:45,200
A clean slate and no debts.
That was her creed.

947
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,790
And nothing happened.

948
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:51,030
She slept,
but Jim's eyes remained open.

949
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:55,240
He realized that they were
being drawn together.

950
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:58,910
So they started all over again,
flying high like birds of prey.

951
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:03,580
They restrained until she was sure
she didn't bear Albert's child.

952
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:07,450
This restraint exalted them.
They were always together.

953
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,220
They never cheated.
Thep romised land was in view.

954
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,500
And The Promised Land Faded

955
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,370
They realized that Catherine
was not pregnant with their child.

956
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:24,170
They saw a specialist who told them
that this was notuncommon...

957
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:26,770
and that these things took time
with most couples.

958
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:35,950
What's wrong?

959
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,250
I want to sleep alone tonight.
Go toyour room.

960
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,880
- Why?
- I just want to.

961
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:43,790
- Explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

962
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:46,420
I'll just stay with you.
That's all.

963
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:48,460
That's not true.

964
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:51,970
I don't want you to stay.
I'm disgusted.

965
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:54,000
It's a nightmare
when the night comes.

966
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,440
When I think of that child we will
never have, I feel I'm taking a test.

967
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:01,100
- I can't stand it.
- Our love is all that counts.

968
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:03,680
No, because I count too...

969
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,080
and I loveyou less.

970
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:08,740
Let's stay away from each other.

971
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:12,450
I may still love you,
but I'll run that risk.

972
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,250
Go to Gilberte
since she writes you every day.

973
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:21,230
- You are not fair.
- I know, but I'm heartless.

974
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:25,390
That's why I don't love you
and why I'll never love anyone.

975
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,990
Besides, I'm 32, and you are 29.

976
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:32,010
When I'm 40,
you'll want a girl of 25...

977
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:34,910
and I'll be left alone
like a fool.

978
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:40,050
You may be right.
I'll leave for three months.

979
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,980
Are you hurt?

980
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:46,250
I'm not anymore.

981
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,820
We should never be hurt
both at once.

982
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:52,260
When you stop suffering,
I'll start.

983
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:01,090
Am I disturbing you?

984
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,870
I can't stand it.

985
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:14,180
- Did you hear us arguing?
- No, I was working.

986
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:17,650
I can't stand him.
I'm going mad.

987
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,450
I'm glad he's going tomorrow.
Good riddance.

988
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,960
Don't be unfair.

989
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,990
You know he loves you.

990
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,500
I really don't know anymore.

991
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,600
He lied to me.

992
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:35,070
He didn't drop Gilberte. He doesn't
even know what he wants himself.

993
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:39,130
I love her. I don't love her,
but I will, maybe.

994
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:43,810
I can't help it
if we didn't have a child.

995
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:47,410
- Got a cigarette?
- You want one?

996
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:02,160
- Want me to talk to him?
- No, please don't.

997
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:05,130
I'm half for him
and half against him.

998
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,700
But I want him to go.

999
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,000
We've decided to separate
for three months.

1000
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:13,040
What do you think?

1001
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:17,140
I don't know.
It may be a good idea.

1002
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,580
You won't say what you think.

1003
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,580
I know you despise me.

1004
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:28,520
No, I shall never despise you.

1005
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,820
I shall always love you...

1006
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:37,020
no matter what you do,
no matter what happens.

1007
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,830
Is that true?

1008
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:45,830
I love you too.

1009
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:52,840
We were happy, weren't we?

1010
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:54,920
But we are happy.

1011
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:58,680
I mean, I am.

1012
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,810
Is that true?

1013
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:05,990
Yes, let's always stay together...

1014
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:10,070
like an old couple,
with Sabine...

1015
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,500
and our grandchildren.

1016
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,510
Stay near me.

1017
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:25,250
I don't want to see him
before he goes.

1018
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:27,780
Then stay here.

1019
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,550
I'll sleep downstairs.

1020
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,140
My little Catherine.

1021
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:51,840
Often you remind me...

1022
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:57,000
of a Chinese play I saw
before the war.

1023
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:59,950
The curtain rises
and the emperor...

1024
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:03,180
turns to the audience and says...

1025
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:07,750
"I am the unhappiest man on Earth...

1026
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:10,290
because I have two wives.

1027
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:13,920
My first wife and my second wife."

1028
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:43,720
Their love was now relative,
but to Jules it was absolute.

1029
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,620
The next morning
Jim left the house.

1030
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:50,220
Catherine took him to the station.

1031
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:52,930
A mist settle dover the valley.

1032
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:57,060
The hive felt that Jim
has lost favor with its queen.

1033
01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:59,070
He had to go.

1034
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:28,600
We can't see the house.

1035
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:39,110
The railway schedule had been changed.

1036
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,410
The train left the next day.

1037
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:51,930
One always feels guilty
in a hotel room.

1038
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:55,960
I'm not very moral,
but I dislike it.

1039
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:58,970
Don't tell me you don't.
I wouldn't believe you.

1040
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:13,410
Jim thought of their children.

1041
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,580
He imagined a houseful
of beautiful children.

1042
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,350
He knew that if they had none...

1043
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,390
Catherine would have affairs again.

1044
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:25,390
They were silent in the gloomy
hotel room, but they made love.

1045
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:29,590
They didn't know why. Maybe
it was their way to end their story.

1046
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:33,730
It was like a funeral
and as if they were already dead.

1047
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:57,220
The next day she took him
tohis train, but they did not wave.

1048
01:27:57,330 --> 01:28:00,890
They separated,
though nothing forced them.

1049
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,300
It's all over now,
Jim told himself once again.

1050
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:29,720
- Your medicine and a letter.
- Thanks.

1051
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:37,660
I think I'm pregnant.
Come. Catherine.

1052
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:40,670
Gilberte, please give me
some writing paper.

1053
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:43,830
Catherine, I am in bed
andveryill.

1054
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:47,000
Besides, I doubt
that your child is mine.

1055
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:51,510
One night could not succeed
where love failed.

1056
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:55,350
"Where love failed."

1057
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:59,150
You are right.
That illness is ajoke.

1058
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:02,850
I'll write and say
you want to see him.

1059
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:07,160
Dear Hypochondriac,
come as soon as you can.

1060
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:09,560
Catherine awaits a letter.

1061
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:12,070
Write in big letters
for her eyes are tired...

1062
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:15,660
and she cannot read
small handwriting.

1063
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:19,710
She doesn't think I was ill.

1064
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:21,740
I don't think she is pregnant.

1065
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,210
In any case,
I doubt that I'm the father.

1066
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:26,280
I've got reasons to doubt.

1067
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:28,870
Our past, Albert and the rest.

1068
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,890
Since you're going out,
could you mail this letter?

1069
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:33,390
Certainly.

1070
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,990
Oh, there's a letter for you.

1071
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:49,030
I'm late. See you later.

1072
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,500
I love you, Jim.

1073
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:58,480
So many unbelievable things
turn out to be true.

1074
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:00,550
I'm going to have a child.

1075
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:05,680
Let us thank God, Jim.
I am sure you are the father.

1076
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:09,920
I beg you to believe me.
Your love is now alive within me.

1077
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:12,320
You must believe me.

1078
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:14,860
This paper is your skin.
This ink is my blood.

1079
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,060
I'm pressing on my pen.
Please, answer me.

1080
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,980
Darling, I believe you.
I am going to you.

1081
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:40,080
All that is good within me
comes from you.

1082
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:43,780
They had promised
neverto call each other.

1083
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:46,260
They couldn't talk
if they couldn't touch each other.

1084
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,530
The mail took three days.
Their letters crossed.

1085
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:54,800
I've got reasons to doubt.
Our past, Albert and the rest.

1086
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,740
I will stop thinking of you,
so that you can stop thinking ofme.

1087
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,830
You disgust me, but that is wrong.

1088
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:03,000
Nothing should ever be disgusting.

1089
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,250
My Jim, your long letter
changes everything.

1090
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:13,410
In two days you'll be here.
Not a letter, but you.

1091
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:17,150
Let's forget our differences.
They are gone.

1092
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:21,290
Come back to me soon,
even late at night.

1093
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,460
Atlast, Jim received
a letter from Jules.

1094
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:27,900
"Your child died
before it could be born.

1095
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,370
To Catherine, you died with it."

1096
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:33,700
They had created nothing.

1097
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:37,140
Jim thought,
new laws are beautiful...

1098
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:40,880
but it's more practical
to obey old ones.

1099
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,420
We played with life and lost.

1100
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,440
I don't believe it.

1101
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,800
- You gave up your cottage?
- Yes.

1102
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:05,900
We're living in France now.

1103
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:08,880
We've rented an old mill
on the Seine.

1104
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:12,710
We must see each other.
Drop in tomorrow.

1105
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,580
Please tell me about Catherine.

1106
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:19,520
For a long time,
I feared she'd commit suicide.

1107
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:21,820
She had bought a gun.

1108
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,980
She would say,
"So-and-so killed himself'...

1109
01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:28,720
like others say,
"So-and-so died of cholera."

1110
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:33,170
She seemed to be in mourning.
She looked like she'd been ill.

1111
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:38,070
She moved in slow motion
with a dead smile on her face.

1112
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,970
Gilberte, this is my friend Jules.

1113
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:48,540
Jim has told me so much about you.
I feel like I know you.

1114
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:54,910
Does Catherine know
you've come to see me?

1115
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:58,260
Yes. She's inviting you
for a ride in her car.

1116
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,060
I'd like you
and maybe your wife to come.

1117
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:05,600
- She won't accept, but I will.
- I've got to go now.

1118
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,600
No, Jules! You can't wear a hat
like that, at least not in France.

1119
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:13,200
Here. Take mine.

1120
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:19,510
- Hello.
- Hi.

1121
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:21,710
Come. It's over there.

1122
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,960
She's in a good mood today.

1123
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:39,000
Don't jar her.

1124
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:42,570
Your place is beautiful.

1125
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:45,510
Look at her car.

1126
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,780
It'sJim.

1127
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:14,690
Catherine smiled,
but she looked mysterious.

1128
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:19,260
She tookher white pajamas
and wrapped them in a neat parcel.

1129
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:23,410
Jim wondered why
and then forgot about it.

1130
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:25,710
They went for a drive.

1131
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,410
I'm hungry. Let's eat here.

1132
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:34,210
Albert, what are you doing here?

1133
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,220
Getting some fresh air.

1134
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:41,210
Besides, I live here.

1135
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:44,190
- Will you eat with us?
- Sure, if we eat now.

1136
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:47,420
- You got a date?
- Perhaps.

1137
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:11,480
Please give me my parcel.
Good night.

1138
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:24,160
She's done it again.

1139
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:26,170
I didn't expect it.

1140
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:29,290
I thought she'd use
a new leading man.

1141
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:33,030
- Albert is an old story.
- He was perfect for tonight.

1142
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:35,580
Leave her the car.

1143
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:40,380
She thinks that in a couple, at least
only one person needs to be faithful.

1144
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,820
- The other--
- I must go home.

1145
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,440
You saw that I'm not living alone.

1146
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,850
- I'm going to marry Gilberte.
- You're wiser than I am.

1147
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,730
You've realized that when it's over
with Catherine, it's all over.

1148
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:56,350
Gilberte will make a good wife.

1149
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:58,370
She's very beautiful.

1150
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:12,240
Jim recognized Catherine's car.

1151
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:15,080
First he saw nothing.

1152
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:19,140
Then he saw the car
weaving on the empty square...

1153
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:22,690
like a riderless horse,
like a ghost ship.

1154
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:54,850
What a night.
I made a mistake.

1155
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,790
That life was dead for me.

1156
01:37:57,890 --> 01:38:00,260
It was a desert, Jim.

1157
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,760
I kept looking for you.

1158
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:05,030
Then come right away.

1159
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:23,950
Lie down next to me.
Kiss me.

1160
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:27,320
There's something I must tell you.

1161
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:28,820
Say it.

1162
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,290
I found a passage
you had marked in a book.

1163
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,560
"On a ship, a woman made love...

1164
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:44,070
to a stranger in her mind."

1165
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:46,840
It struck me as a confession.

1166
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:49,880
That's how you explore the universe.

1167
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,470
I feel that curiosity too.

1168
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:54,520
Perhaps everyone does.

1169
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:58,210
I overcome it foryour sake,
butyou don't.

1170
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,050
In love, I agree with you...

1171
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,630
a couple is not ideal.

1172
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:09,120
Just look around you.

1173
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:11,700
You wanted something better...

1174
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:14,270
by refusing to submit
to hypocrisy.

1175
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,000
You wanted to invent love.

1176
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:24,040
But pioneers must be
humble and unselfish.

1177
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:27,170
Let's face it.

1178
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,680
We have failed in everything.

1179
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,350
You tried to change me.

1180
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:40,290
I tried to spreadjoy,
but I've created only pain.

1181
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:45,460
I promised to marry Gilberte...

1182
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:48,540
but I can't postpone
my promise endlessly.

1183
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,940
It's counterfeit.

1184
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,170
I've no longer any hope
of marrying you.

1185
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:58,180
Catherine, I am going
to marry Gilberte.

1186
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,870
We can still have children.

1187
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:04,680
How touching.

1188
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:10,550
What about me?
What about me?

1189
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:14,920
What about the children I wanted?

1190
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:18,230
- You didn't want any.
- I did.

1191
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:23,830
They would have been beautiful.

1192
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:35,380
You are going to die.

1193
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:38,420
You disgust me, Jim.
I'm going to kill you.

1194
01:40:43,690 --> 01:40:46,460
You're a coward. You're scared.

1195
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:10,970
Jim was glad to see Jules
and to see that Catherine left him cold.

1196
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:14,280
She tried not to leave them alone
and suggested a ride.

1197
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:16,540
Jim agreed.
But where to?

1198
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:21,750
Catherine drove fast
and carelessly.

1199
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:26,760
Something was in the air,
just like the day they met Albert.

1200
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:30,300
They stopped in a cafe by a pond.

1201
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:34,770
- Now they're burning books.
- It's unbelievable.

1202
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:45,380
Catherine found
you were easy to get...

1203
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:47,680
and hard to keep.

1204
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:51,480
Your love vanished and returned...

1205
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:54,280
with hers.

1206
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:57,880
I never knew those ups and downs.

1207
01:42:57,990 --> 01:43:00,790
Mr.Jim, I've something to tell you.

1208
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,920
Will you come with me?

1209
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:10,630
Watch us,Jules.

1210
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,690
Jules would no longer dread,
as he had from the beginning...

1211
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,960
her unfaithfulness
and that he might lose her...

1212
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:43,060
since she was gone now.

1213
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:45,640
Their bodies were found
in theriver.

1214
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:47,870
Jim's coffin was huge.

1215
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:50,170
It dwarfed Catherine's.

1216
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:54,050
They left nothing of themselves.
But Jules had his daughter.

1217
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:58,410
Did Catherine merely
seek excitement? No.

1218
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,780
But she had dazed Jules.

1219
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:03,220
He was overcome with relief.

1220
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:09,790
The friendship of Jules and Jim
had no equivalent in love.

1221
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:12,090
They enjoyed little things together.

1222
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,690
They accepted their differences
with tenderness.

1223
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,040
Everyone called them
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.

1224
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:27,530
The ashes were placed in an urn.

1225
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,840
Jules might have mixed them.

1226
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:34,640
Catherine wanted hers
to be cast to the wind...

1227
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:37,150
but that was not permitted.
