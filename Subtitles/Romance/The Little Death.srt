- Want me to stop?

4
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:08,162
Yeah, can you just come up
here and fuck me, please?

OK.

Not right after. Come on.

Well, I need you... I need you

- It's a fantasy of mine.

37
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,117
What, getting raped?

38
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,020
Yeah, it's like
your foot thing.

39
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:51,222
Um, it's a bit different,
I think, hon.

40

- How?

41

different from me raping you?

Oh, come on,

43
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,264

I've always wanted to try.

a nice thing

- Not now, not now.
- No? When?

50
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,977
- Um, I don't want to know.
- OK, tomorrow, or...?

how to take that, babe.

60
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,509
Honey, it's a
really common fantasy.

61
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,837
Yeah, I'm not 100% sure
it is, hon.

62
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,143
It is actually and you said
you wouldn't judge me.

63
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,945
No, I didn't.
I absolutely did not.

Maeve?

65
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,282
You just told me
you had a fantasy

66
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,524

67
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,088
No, what? Yes, it does!

68
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,187
You said you want to be raped
but not by me.

69

No! Oh, no, no, no, darling,

Oh, my God,

71
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,298
No, I want to be raped by you.

72
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,897
No, you don't.

73
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,298
Yes, you are the only man in
the world I want to rape me.

74
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,001
I love you
but because I love you

75
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,342
and because you're the only
man I want to be with,

76
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,038
I want you to have sex
with me.

77
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,810

out the wrong way.

87

Well, you remember the last
time you went down on me, Dan?

95
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,267
- 'Cause I don't.
- OK. OK.

96
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,205

you had sex?

- Like, um...
- It was, um, it was...

100
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,134
It was last month
before your fun run.

101
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,857
Was it?

102
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:22,304
OK. What seems to be missing
here is communication.

103
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,302
But you're both struggling
with that.

104

So as an experiment tonight...

It's the same every time.

180
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,310
Two days before I start
ovulating, twice a day,

181
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,975
morning and night
in the recommended position.

182
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,085
And for 20 minutes afterwards,
I elevate my hips.

183
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:11,488
And it's been like that
for almost three years now

184
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:15,161
so you can't tell me that
there isn't something wrong.

185
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,932
There isn't something wrong.

186
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,000
Sometimes it just comes
down to bad luck.

187
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,169
Will you please just tell us
what to do?

'Cause I'll try anything.

189
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,168
Do you climax at the point
of ejaculation?

190
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,176
Mutual orgasms are said
to increase

191
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,938
the chances of conception.

192
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,846
So do you orgasm during sex?

193
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,853
Yeah, I mean, I have. Yeah.

194
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,794
While you've been trying
to conceive?

195
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,189
Oh, no, not since
I've been married.

196
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,529
How's your cervical mucus? OK?

197
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,734
It's good. Yeah.

198
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,296
Good.
And what about the doctor?

199
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,006
Did she say anything or...?

200
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,137
Actually, she, uh,
she did say one thing.

201
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,844
- Yeah?
- Um...

202
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:10,046
Yeah. She said that it might
help if I orgasm during sex.

203
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,080
You orgasm during sex
all the time.

204
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,815
Yeah, so...

205
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:19,317
Yeah, we just... We, uh,
keep doing what we're doing.

206
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,426
- Yeah.
- Knuckle down.

207
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,299
Hey.

208
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,998
If having a baby was easy,
everyone would be doing it.

209
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,001
<i>I think everyone is doing it.</i>

210
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:33,443
Yeah, but their babies suck.
Ours is going to be awesome.

211
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,010
- (Laughs)
- We'll be right.

212
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,509
<i> (Phone rings)</i>

213
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,511
I should get that.
That'll be work.

214
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,151
RICHARD: Hello.

215
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,591
You want to go outside?

216
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,465
Babe. What's wrong, honey?

217
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,405
My dad's dead.

218
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,912
Oh, my God.

219
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,488
He, uh... had a...
had a heart attack.

220
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,217
No.

221
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,890
(Cries)

222
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,207
I've never
seen you cry before.

223
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,799
(Both moan)

224
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,313
(Cries)

225
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,022
MAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa...
(Laughing, animated chatting)

226
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,715
Hey, the place looks great.
I am so jealous.

227
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,156
- Thank you.
- Well, slowly but surely...

228
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,031
Only one thing left to do now,
Paul.

229
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,730
- Yael.
- What do you mean?

230
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:40,332
I think she means marriage,
mate.

231
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,333
- Oh, right,
- What, it's been five years?

232
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,166
BOTH: Six.
- Six?

233
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,171
- Yeah.
- So what are you waiting for?

234
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,913
- OK, that's enough.
- No, it's OK, it's fine.

235
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:53,209
Uh, no, it's, like, we're not
really waiting for anything.

236
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,453
We're just not really marriage
kind of people, that's all.

237
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,219
Yeah.

238
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,794
What? We've talked about this.

239
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,088
- I know.
- We laughed about it.

240
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,360
We said we didn't need to go
through all that.

241
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,459
Yeah, I know. I know.

242
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,462
Um, should we do dessert?

243
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,265
- Yes, please!
- Let's do that.

244
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,967
- Great.
- Thank you.

245
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,469
Thanks, darling.

246
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,705
- You OK?
- Hmm.

247
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,811
- You seem a little bit...
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

248
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,453
Hey, can I ask you something?
Have you ever...

249
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,316
Have you ever... (Sighs)

250
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,055
Have you ever raped anybody?

251
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,069
No. Who's been saying that?

252
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,838
- No-one, no, it's...
- Have you?

253
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,398
No.

254
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,406
No, I haven't and that's the
thing. I don't really want to.

255
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,276
Mate, that's good.
That's good.

256
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,450
- You don't have to.
- No.

257
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,779
(Laughs) Mate, I'm not...

258
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,285
No, it's not that, it's...
It's not me, it's...

259
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,118
It's Maeve.
She's got this, uh...

260
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,464
What?

261
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,789
I don't even know
what you call it.

262
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:19,964
- That thing, this, uh...
- Oh. Like a fantasy?

263
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,466
Yeah. A fantasy.
How did you know that?

264
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,299
(Laughs) OK.
Rape fantasy - very common.

265
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,995
No shit. That's what she said.

266
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,906
Yeah. Yael's got one.
Massive one.

267
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:33,308
- Really? And you've never...?
- No, can't be done.

268
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,813
I've tried but
it's a flawed fantasy.

269
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,375
- Not possible.
- Why?

270
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,083
Well, think about it.

271
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,315
The moment someone asks to
be raped, it stops being rape.

272
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,322
Right? It's only rape
if they don't want it.

273
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,825
- She wants it - not rape.
- Right.

274
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,927
The reason they can't get
what they want

275
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,829
is because they want it.

276
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,434
God, that doesn't seem fair.

277
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,134
Sucks, mate.

278
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,166
There's got to be something
I can do.

279
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,872
I just want to make her happy.

280
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,114
Whatever happened
to good, old-fashioned...

281
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,879
- ..run-of-the-mill sex?
- Yeah.

282
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,448
People have to complicate it
with all this kinky shit.

283
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,877
Yeah.

284
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,952
You don't have anything
like that, do ya?

285
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,750
- Hm?
- No weird fetish?

286
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,292
Nah. I mean, define 'weird',
you know.

287
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,038
(Doorbell chimes)

288
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,742
Hi.

289
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:41,184
- Hi! Hi, sorry to bother you.
- That's OK.

290
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,481
Uh, were you in the middle
of something?

291
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,123
Oh, no, we're just having
some lunch. It's alright.

292
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,889
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's fine.

293
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,887
I'll be quick.
Um, my name's Steve.

294
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,159
I've just moved in
down the road.

295
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,828
- Oh, we've just moved in too.
- Hey, how about that!

296
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,987
- Hello, welcome.
- Thank you.

297
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,296
Well, as I said,
I won't keep you.

298
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,129
- I'm doing the rounds.
- Nice.

299
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,934
- Visiting the neighbours.
- Good.

300
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,466
And I wanted
to give you these.

301
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,370
- Aww... (Gasps)
- My way of saying hi.

302
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,342
Oh, my God. Golliwogs.

303
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,051
Also, I am required
by federal law to inform you

304
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,049
that I am a convicted
sex offender.

305
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,521
Where did you find Golliwogs?

306
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,521
I didn't think
they made them anymore.

307
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,523
- No, they don't, I do.
- Oh!

308
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,425
Yeah, baking
is my little hobby.

309
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,257
Amazing. I haven't seen these
since I was a kid.

310
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,033
I think they stopped
making them

311
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,331
on account of
the, you know, racism.

312
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:38,944
- Yeah, makes you think.
- Yeah, it does.

313
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,038
OK, well, I won't keep you
any longer.

314
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,540
- OK, thanks, Dan.
- Steve.

315
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,842
Steve! Sorry. Maeve.
Nice to meet you.

316
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,114
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thanks so much for this.

317
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,653
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you, bye.

00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,295
I didn't get that raise
that...

344
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:18,001
I told you why I couldn't
give you the raise...

345
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,774
..home life got
a little bit...

346
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,442
..times are tight,
money's tight.

347
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,311
I mean, we're all feeling
the pinch.

348
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,239
- I'm cancelling my holiday.
- Really?

349
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,214
- Shortening it, yeah.
- OK, I'm sorry.

350
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,953
It won't happen again.

351
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,746
Have you ever been
to Thailand?

352
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,286
You've never been, have you?

353
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,761
Remember I did my shoulder
in Bangkok?

354
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,030
The doctor put me on these.
Right?

355
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,129
These little suckers
will knock you out

356
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,861
a good six, eight hours.

357
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,526
OK, I'm not kidding
but be careful.

358
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,204
They're from Thailand
so they're not technically,

359
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,044
you know, legal.

360
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,036
I'm not great with pills.

361
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,282
I've got a really sensitive
gag reflex.

362
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:03,477
I almost choked on them
at a school camp when...

363
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,993
So I'll just...
I'll put them in some tea.

364
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,159
There you go.
Those'll do the trick.

365
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,728
That's the same stuff
they force-feed prisoners

366
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,187
when they riot.

367
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,455

You're gonna sleep.

It really was.

Also, I'm required
by federal law to inform you

Baby, you're not crying.

427
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,384
I don't think I have
any tears left in me.

428

Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mrs Hawkins.

433
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,819
Actually, doctor, it's 'Miss'.

434
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,147
Well, Miss Hawkins,
why don't you take a seat?

435
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,457
You look very sexy
in that outfit, doctor.

436
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,458
Now, Miss Hawkins, I have
the results of your test here.

437
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:25,831
Oh, yes. Will you need
to examine me further?

438
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,971
Uh, no, no, it's conclusive.

439
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,397
And I'm afraid it's bad news.

440
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,972
Well, I have been
a very bad girl.

441
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:35,472
- Perhaps you need to...
- You have hepatitis.

442
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,136
- Sorry, what?
- Hepatitis.

443
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,381
Well, that's not very sexy,
is it?

444
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:49,324
No, no, it's not.
Particularly not hepatitis C.

445
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:56,159
So, I'm going to prescribe you
a course of interferon

446
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,062
and I'll give you the number

447
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:01,403
of a support group
in the area.

448
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,870
And I'll see you again
in a couple of weeks.

449
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,506
- Sorry, Dan, I'm confused...
- Dan?

450
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,513
It's 'Doctor'! Stay in it!

451
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,215
Now we have to start again.

452
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:20,177
No, no, we don't have
to start again.

453
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,046
- Just getting good too!
- How was it getting good?

454
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,755
Why do I have hepatitis?

455
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:28,857
Because I thought that your
character was, you know,

456
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:31,201
like, maybe got around a bit.

457
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:33,997
You know, a bit slutty.
I thought that would be sexy.

458
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,369
I'm not gonna want to have sex

459
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,397
if you've just diagnosed me
with an STD.

460
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,640
Just... Just make me
feel sexy.

461
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,309
Alright, alright, alright.

462
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,912
Do it again. I promise
I'll make you feel sexy, OK?

463
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,914
Um, go back to your spot.

464
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:53,546
I'll start here and...

465
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:59,164
- You alright?
- Just feel a bit hot.

466
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,331
Oh, is this part of the...?
We started?

467
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,158

I need to speak...

00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,353
- Um... yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

518
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,254
I thought we could watch one
in bed?

519
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,286
- Alright.
- Alright.

520
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,761
Actually, I picked up a couple
on my way home.

521
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,260
What have I got?

522
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,762
I have got Sophie's Choice
or Philadelphia.

523
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,364
Any comedies?

524
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,066
Might be a bit heavy for me,
hon.

525
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,601
Oh.

526
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,340
Well, maybe later?

527
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,910
Will you come and help me
make some dinner?

528
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,139
Yeah, yeah, just give me
a couple of minutes.

529
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:49,105
Alright, well, I'll leave
the onions on the bench

530
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,814
for you to cut, OK?

531
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,316
Just... Onions again?

532
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,677
Jesus, Ro, no offence,
I'm a bit onioned out.

533
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,346
I feel like
we've been eating onions

534
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,085
every night
for the past week.

535
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,790
OK, alright.

536
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,262
OK.

537
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,997
- How was your day?
- It was good.

538
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,344
It was exhausting but good.

539
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,339
Oh, that's nice.

540
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,480
So you haven't been thinking
about your dad at all?

541
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,350
(Sighs) Well, I am now.

542
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,477
Why did you bring up Dad?

543
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:30,716
Well, you just haven't spoken
about him in a few days.

544
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,362
You must miss him.

545
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,258
I'm just trying not to think
about it.

546
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,931
Can we just talk about
something else?

547
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:41,361
Hey, you remember
when he used to leave

548
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,026
those ridiculously long
messages on your phone

549
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,736
and you wouldn't even finish
listening to them?

550
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,308
You'd just delete them.

551
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:53,238
You ever think about that
and wish you hadn't done that?

552
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,305
(Cries) God...

553
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:58,854
Hey. Hey, hey.

554
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,850
Honey. Hey, what's wrong?
Look at me.

555
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,693
I just miss him so much.

556
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,159
Hey, it's alright, sweetheart.
It's OK.

557
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:08,688
I've got you, honey,
I've got you.

558
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,164
Hey, what... Are you serious?

559
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,930
What, I thought you wanted...

560
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,732
What, I wanted a handjob while
I thought about my dead dad?

561
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,235
No. Thanks.

562
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,143
Hello, girl.

563
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,549
You're my good girl,
aren't you?

564
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,417
My best girl.

565
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,849
I love you. I love you.

566
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,425
OK.

567
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,425
You ready for a little trip?

568
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,372
Just one night. I'll pick her
up again tomorrow afternoon.

569
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,899
- I don't know, Ro.
- One night. That is all.

570
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:56,144
- Why?
- I want to take Richard out.

571
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,941
As a surprise and I don't want
him worrying about the dog.

572
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,444
You know what he's like.

573
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,451
- Why are you lying?
- What? I am not.

574
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,891
Yes, you are lying.
Your knee is twitching.

575
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,447
I have known you
my entire life

576
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,155
and you cannot tell a lie
without your knee twitching.

577
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,328
What's going on? Ro!

578
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,387
Look, will you take her
or not?

579
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,256
Yeah, alright,
I'll take her but...

580
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:21,504
I gotta run.
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

581
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,703
Run away?!
How did she run away?

582
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,006
- I-I don't know, sweet...
- How did she get out?

583
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,338
I-I came home and
the side gate was open.

584
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,344
Why was the side gate open,
Ro?

585
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:36,276
- I don't know, sweetheart.
- Jesus!

586
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,451
Oh, my God, you must be
feeling so emotional.

587
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,420
Come on, baby, come here.
It's alright.

588
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,119
I know how much
she meant to you.

589
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,450
Meant to me?! Don't say
'meant'! 'Means' to me!

590
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:46,156
Call me if she shows up!

591
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,678
- Miss Wickam, I beg of you!
- Mr Callum, hold your tongue.

592
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,715
I'm to be wed within the week.

593
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:17,221
You love him not.

594
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,922
If you walk away from me now,

595
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,294
you'll be making the biggest
mistake of my life.

596
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:22,993
I feel faint.

597
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,864
I used to be scared
of the idea of growing old.

598
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,364
Now I'm just scared
of the idea

599
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,226
of growing old without you.

600
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,568
- Baby...
- Shh.

601
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,873
What are you doing?
I was watching that.

602
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,376
No, wait,
I need to talk to you.

603
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,478
OK, talk to me but
can you turn the TV back on?

604
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,550
- No, this is important.
- What is it?

605
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,852
- I love you.
- How is that important?

606
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,353
- Give me the remote.
- No, no, wait. Listen to me.

607
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:57,530
I'm in this.
You and me, all the way.

608
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,726
- Are you?
- Yeah, of course.

609
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,374
<i> Are you?</i>

610
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,410
I mean, what if... what if
we were to take things

611
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,108
to the next level?

612
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,908
Oh, we are so
on the same page, it's scary.

613
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,377
Where are you going?

614
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,402
Is this next level enough
for you?

615
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:35,328
I need to tell you something.

616
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,273
Wait, wait, wait,
let me enter into it.

617
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,799
No, Dan, I'm not
doing this anymore, OK?

618
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,236
You're giving me really mixed
messages here, Evie.

619
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,011
I just want to tell you
something.

620
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,540
Well, tell me, tell me!
Just stop playing games!

621
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:51,946
- Tell me!
- Dan, I'm...

622
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,680
(Doorbell rings)

623
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:56,715
- No, leave it.
- Could be important.

624
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,491
I can promise you
it is not as important

625
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,220
as what I'm about to tell you.

626
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,959
(Doorbell rings)

627
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,232
I'm sorry, it's going to
annoy the shit out of me.

628
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:08,201
<i>- Don't you dare.
- Don't I dare ?</i>

629
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Calm down,
I'll be two seconds.

630
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,072
I'm asking you,

631
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,910
your wife is asking you
to not answer the door.

632
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,324
Yeah?

633
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,388
- Bad time?
- Uh, I don't know, maybe.

634
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,918
- Depends what you want.
- Good point.

635
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:36,064
My name's Steve. I've just
moved in down the street.

636
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,261
OK.

637
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:39,102
Just wanted
to introduce myself

638
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,097
and say hi to the neighbours,
that's all.

639
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,729
(Door slams)

640
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,244
Uh, OK, yeah, in that case, it
is kind of a bad time, mate.

641
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:47,067
- Sorry.
- Yeah, of course.

642
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,042
I see you've
got your hands full.

643
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,980
Uh, look, I just wanted
to give you these

644
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,407
and I'll get out of your hair.

645
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,281
Thanks.

646
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:02,992
- They're Golliwogs.
- Yeah. Thanks.

647
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:05,018
Bet you haven't seen those
for a while.

648
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,723
Um, no. Suppose not.

649
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:10,425
- Uh, is that it?
- Uh... yeah.

650
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,302
Actually,
there is one more thing.

651
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:14,758
Yep?

652
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,796
I am required by federal law
to inform you

653
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,501
that I am a convicted
sex offender.

654
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,171
Yeah, that's fine.
Anything else?

655
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,284
No. That's everything.

656
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:27,077
OK!

657
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,021
Evie!

658
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,984
Evie, open the door.

659
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,820
Evie, don't do this.

660
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,362
Evie!

661
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:46,125
Honey, what are you doing?
Go to sleep.

662
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,401
No, I can't, I have to
finish these posters.

663
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,803
D'you think you'll be able
to put them up

664
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,173
around the streets tomorrow?

665
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:55,101
- Yeah, of course, honey.
- Thanks.

666
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:58,166
- I'm sorry.
- Baby, don't apologise.

667
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,876
It's not your fault.

668
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,352
I bet you anything that
when you get home tomorrow,

669
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,250
Roxy'll be here
waiting for you.

670
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,346
Run away?!

671
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,889
W-What do you mean?
How is that even possible?

672
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,893
Well, I think maybe she went
out the side gate

673
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:19,396
'cause the latch is broken.

674
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:22,467
- Why is the latch broken?
- It's a long story.

675
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,897
I'm so sorry, Ro.
I-I didn't...

676
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:27,373
OK, you can never tell Richard
about this. I mean it.

677
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:28,742
What?

678
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,810
You can never tell him
that Roxy was here.

679
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,379
He will never forgive me.
Or you.

680
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,077
- Ro...
- You gotta promise me.

681
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,779
- Ro!
- No, promise me!

682
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,450
I promise, what is going on?

683
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,316
Oh, my God.

684
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,332
- Did you find Roxy?
- Not yet.

685
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:53,098
But we will. We will.

686
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:55,428
Hmm, the posters should help,
don't you think?

687
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,897
Definitely. Someone
will see those posters

688
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,403
and they'll call.

689
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,705
Yeah. So you put
all the posters up or...?

690
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:04,207
- Of course.
- Of course.

691
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:05,909
- Yeah.
- Hmm, that's weird.

692
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,310
What?

693
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,382
I was putting out the garbage
earlier today

694
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,211
and the bottom of the bag
split open.

695
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,016
- Oh.
- And I found these.

696
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,994
What the fuck, Ro?

697
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,161
- I must have accidentally...
- Oh, must you?

698
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
That's bullshit
because you just told me

699
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,862
that you put up
all the posters.

700
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:27,364
Yeah, but what I meant was...

701
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,065
- Where's Roxy?
- I don't know.

702
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:30,827
Don't you?
Why are you lying to me?

703
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,335
Why would you hurt me
like that?

704
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,137
I mean, do you not
want to find Roxy?

705
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,839
I did not hurt Roxy!

706
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,910
Who said anything
about you hurting Roxy?

707
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,909
- I didn't mean...
- What did you do to her?

708
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,351
If it was an accident,
just tell me. I'll understand!

709
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,747
- Did you kill her?
- What? No!

710
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,449
I did not kill the dog!

711
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:49,051
(Faint noise)

712
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,620
Can we help you?

713
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,164
I'll come back another time.

714
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,874
Just tell me,
what has happened?

715
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,297
Richard, I swear to you.

716
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,202
The last time I saw Roxy,
she was fine.

717
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,104
But there's something,
isn't there?

718
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:09,806
I know you, Ro, I can see it.

719
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,880
There's something wrong
with me.

720
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,349
Um... I wanted to tell you
as soon as I felt it

721
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,420
and I should have but I...

722
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,187
I am sick, Richard.

723
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,890
- I'm so sick.
- Sick?

724
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,961
What do you mean, sick?
Sick, how?

725
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,490
God, I'm so afraid
to tell you.

726
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,025
It's not...
It's not cancer, is it?

727
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:35,831
- Baby, it's...
- It's not... cancer, is it?

728
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:48,081
It could be...
a bit of cancer, yeah.

729
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,379
Oh, God...

730
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:52,381
What does that mean -
'could be'?

731
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,883
Well, the doctor says
that the results are...

732
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,386
They're inconclusive.

733
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,317
Wait, wait, wait,
I'm confused.

734
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:00,993
It's OK, it's alright.
I've got you.

735
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:03,692
- Hey, let it out.
- No, no, no. I've got you.

736
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:06,995
- I'll be strong for you.
- Not too strong. Hey?

737
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,166
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

738
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:12,869
Oh, my God!

739
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,711
Ah! Ah!

740
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:18,707
Ah! Ah! Ah!

741
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,280
(Screams)

742
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,408
(Door closes)
- Just me!

743
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,724
Will you shut up?
The boys are asleep.

744
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:28,017
Oh, I know,
I-I'm sorry I'm late.

745
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:31,419
- I can explain...
- Stop fucking mumbling, Phil.

746
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:34,362
'Not too late.' Do you
remember saying that?

747
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,359
Yeah, I do remember
but I wanted to get...

748
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,491
I don't care.

(Sighs)

776
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,064
Hey, honey bee!

777
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:55,464
I got a little surprise
for you today!

778
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,069
Hello?

779
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,035
What's with
the silent treatment?

780
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,242
Oh, Evie, talk to me.

781
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,452
Do you remember
what our counsellor said

782
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,148
about communication?

783
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,180
Yes, I remember
what our counsellor said

784
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:15,685
about communication.

785
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:17,787
I remember everything
our counsellor said

786
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,719
including the date and time of
the next fucking appointment.

787
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:22,215
Did you, Daniel? No.

788
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:23,926
Don't call me Daniel, Evelyn.

789
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:26,958
Daniel. Da-niel. Daniel,
Daniel, fucking Daniel.

790
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:30,165
Honey bee, honey bee,
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

791
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:32,698
I'm a shithead,
I completely forgot.

792
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:36,014
- Won't happen again, alright?
- Yeah, well, better not.

793
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,308
Got a present for you today.

794
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,479
Really?

795
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:54,358
- It's a video camera.
- It's for our role plays.

796
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,459
I thought we could tape
and watch it back.

797
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,261
- Dan.
- Don't you reckon?

798
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:01,233
- How much was it?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

799
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,932
Couple of hundred bucks.

800
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:04,874
We should really be saving
right now.

801
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,969
No, no, we're fine.
Do you want to try it out?

802
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:08,471
I have costumes

803
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:11,013
and I've set up a little
something in the garage.

804
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,046
Let me get the light

805
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:22,149
and, uh, let me see,
press that there.

806
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:26,393
Evie, you look amazing.
This is so exciting.

807
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,364
- Uh, you ready?
- Yep.

808
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,500
And... action.

809
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,831
Action. (Clears throat)

810
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:38,473
Um...

811
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:41,069
I hear you've been
misbehaving, prisoner.

812
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:43,872
(Clears throat)

813
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:47,475
Um... I always fall
for the bad boys.

814
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:50,408
What are you in here for,
stud?

815
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:54,175
Assault. Sexual assault.

816
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:57,485
I'll bet
she secretly loved it.

817
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:59,188
He.

818
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,020
- For fuck's sake, Dan!
- What?

819
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,986
You're trying to turn me on
by telling me

820
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:05,825
you have sexually assaulted
a man?!

821
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,830
It's called having
a back story, Evie.

822
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:10,132
(Beeping)
- Something's burning.

823
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:13,374
Oh, shit. It's the light. Get
the door! Get the door, Evie!

824
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:16,041
- I am!
- Bloody thing.

825
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,940
We're fine! We're fine!
Everything's fine!

826
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:24,376
Close the door, Evie! Close
the door! Close the door!

827
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,223
(Coughs)

828
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,752
No! Oh, fuck, Evie!

829
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,756
This cost $3,000!

830
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,058
Thank God it's working.
OK, let's go from the top.

831
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,830
- The top of what?
- The scene.

832
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,770
What scene? Dan, do you even
remember why we're doing this?

833
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:46,067
- For the sex.
- For the marriage.

834
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,770
You're really starting to
scare me. Look at yourself.

835
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:50,573
Don't even recognise you
anymore.

836
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,242
Babe, babe! Warden! Warden!

837
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:55,814
Perhaps we can have
a bit of fun before you go.

838
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,414
Hey.

839
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,077
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean? Work.

840
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:35,815
Well, I called your work

841
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,850
and they said that
you left hours ago.

842
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:41,285
- So where have you been?
- Just been in the car.

843
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:43,062
Don't you dare fucking mumble.

844
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,560
I've been in the car!

845
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:47,162
Honestly, I've just been
driving around, thinking.

846
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,855
Why weren't you at work?

847
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:52,096
Maureen, there's been
a bit of a reshuffle at work.

848
00:52:52,103 --> 00:52:53,103
It's nothing I did.

849
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:55,344
Are you cheating on me, Phil?

850
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,039
What?

851
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:02,205
$500 on women's clothes.
$70 at The Body Shop.

852
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,713
- Interflora, David Jones...
- Show me that.

853
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,215
Fuck you!

854
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:09,387
We have a joint bank account,
you idiot.

855
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:13,957
- I can explain.
- Yes. Yes, this time explain.

856
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:17,488
I can... First of all,
I never did anything...

857
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,057
It's so complicated...

858
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,226
You're not going to
understand.

859
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,868
OK.

860
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,447
Yeah, I've been having
an affair.

861
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,150
(Gasps)

862
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:49,433
It's over and
it will never happen again.

863
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,831
- Who is she?
- Someone from work.

864
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:56,731
- You don't know her.
- What's her name?

865
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,374
- Does it matter?
- What is she like?

866
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,870
- Don't do this.
- Is she younger than me?

867
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,772
- She's about the same.
- Prettier?

868
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:06,084
- Again, about the same.
- Is she thinner than me?

869
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,777
You have a lot in common.

870
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:10,278
She's not younger than me.
She's not skinnier than me.

871
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:13,021
She's not prettier than me.
Why couldn't it just be me?

872
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:14,517
Because she's softer than you.

873
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,819
She's quieter than you.

874
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,755
She doesn't yell at me.

875
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,788
She doesn't call me an idiot

876
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:25,233
or tell me to shut up
all the time.

877
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:29,504
She listens to me.

878
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,597
She's nice to me.

879
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,273
She doesn't make me feel like
the only thing stopping her

880
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:38,973
from being happy... is me.

881
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,345
Get out.

882
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,251
- Maureen.

00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:32,211
Otherwise, we need to have
a little nap.

A nap? In the car?
While I drive?

922

Can you spare a dollar, mate?

923
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:38,794
No, sorry, mate,
we don't have any.

924
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,559
That's right,
you remember it.

925
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,929
Come on, man, just a dollar.

926
00:57:47,932 --> 00:57:50,402
Mate, we honestly don't
have anything. I'm sorry.

927
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,496
Not one single dollar?

928
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,909
OK, you should just give them
what you've got.

929
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,839
- Alright.
- He doesn't have anything.

930
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,845
- For fuck's sake.
- That's what he said.

931
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:04,347
Alright, mate.

932
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,257
- Alright, that's fine.
- OK.

933
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,695
What?

934
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:23,869
Alright, you want phones?
They're yours.

There you go.

Oh, come on, mate.
That's enough.

937

You got what you wanted.

938
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,450
I wouldn't say that.

939
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,922

a pretty little thing?

Sorry, sir, there's been
a gas leak in the garage.

945
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:54,922
- I can't let you through.
- A gas leak?

946
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,115
Hmm.

947
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:57,986

Paul! Where are you...?

950
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,957
Is he OK?

951
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,413
Hey.

952
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:53,975
Hey, sweetheart.

953
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:59,391
- Where are we?
- We're in the hospital.

954
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:02,760
- Shit, are you OK?
- Am I OK?

955
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,930
Yeah, I'm OK. You're not OK.

956
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,833
You fractured your skull,
honey.

957
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,332
But you're going to be fine.

958
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,174
Oh, my God. How?

959
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,599
You fell and hit your head.

960
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:18,969
Really? I don't remember.

961
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:21,936
Yeah, the doctor said
you might not.

962
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:24,875
- It's OK, just rest.
- What happened?

963
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:26,422
Somebody hit you.

964
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,185
The car park.

965
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:34,021
Yeah. In the car park.

966
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,933
Did I rape you?

967
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,632
Shh.

968
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:46,835
That's what I was trying
to do, sweetheart.

969
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,397
- Shh.
- Those men, I paid them.

970
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:50,105
- I know.
- They were actors.

971
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:52,367
They were meant to hit me
with a fake bottle.

972
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,336
- Yeah.
- Did they use a real bottle?

973
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:57,084
- I-I don't...
- It should have been fake.

974
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:59,211
Honey, just try and rest.
Just try and relax.

975
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,016
- It was for your birthday.
- I know.

976
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:02,718
- As a surprise.
- I know.

977
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,390
Did I do it?

978
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,423
Maeve, tell me.

979
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,161
Did I rape you?

980
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:20,072
- Yeah. Baby, you raped me.
- Yeah?

981
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,800
(Sighs) Was it OK?

982
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:24,166
Yeah.

983
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:27,008
Was it what you wanted?

984
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:31,105
- Yeah.
- Thank God.

985

986
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,321
I really tried to think
of everything this time.

987
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:40,121
You know, I really put
some thought into it.

988
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:41,964
- I know.
- Yeah.

989
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:43,459
I practised.

990
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,960
But, you know, it was
my first rape and I...

991
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:50,274
I don't know if I'm, like,
meant to be a raper.

992
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,967
- Shh...
- 'Cause it was...

993
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,599
No, baby, it was perfect.

994
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,437
It was perfect.

995
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,048
Wait, so when
did I hit my head?

996
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,916
- Right after.
- Shit.

997
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,420
- There was more.
- No.

998
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:13,161
- There was more...
- No more, no.

999
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:14,857
I was meant to do
one more thing.

1000
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:17,228
Pauly, no more, please.
Honey, no, that's enough.

1001
01:03:17,227 --> 01:03:19,487
Just one more thing.

1002

You're late home

I'm under the pump at work,
babe.

1022
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:33,469
That is bullshit. Bullshit!

1023
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,270
I called your brother
and he told me

1024
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:37,142
you've been taking
theatre lessons.

1025
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,270
Theatre... Screen acting
classes. So what?

1026
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:41,976
So what the fuck? Since when
did you want to be an actor?

1027
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:44,079
You're the one who said
I should get into it.

1028
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:45,781
- What? When?
- Oh, God!

1029
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:48,082
When we first started
this whole role play thing.

1030
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:50,445
You said I could be
a famous actor. Your words.

1031
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:53,694
That does not sound like
something I would say.

1032
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,190
And that is not the point.

1033
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:57,162
The point is you lied
about it.

1034
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,860
I was embarrassed.

1035
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:03,202
I mean, Jesus, Evie!
Me? An actor?

1036
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,300
- It's crazy.
- It's ridiculous.

1037
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:07,002
It's not ridiculous.

1038
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:10,214
Dan. It's ridiculous.

1039
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,494
Don't go. Evie.

1040
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,921
Don't go.

1041
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,157
If you walk out that door,

1042
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,230
you'll be making the biggest
mistake of my life.

1043
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,395
I used to be scared
of the idea of growing old.

1044
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,000
Now I'm just scared
of the idea...

1045
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,513
..of growing old without you.

1046
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:07,063
- Ow. Fuck!
- What?

1047
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:09,204
Oh, I got it in my eye.
Christ!

1048
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:11,029
- Got what in your eye?
- Tiger Balm.

1049
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:14,004
I got fucking Tiger Balm in my
eye. God, that really stings.

1050
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:16,044
How did you get Tiger Balm
in your eye?

1051
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:18,009
You're supposed to put it
near your eye.

1052
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:20,308
Like, the bridge of your nose
and it makes you cry.

1053
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,910
They showed us how to do it
in acting class this week.

1054
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,215
You were acting?

1055
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,277
Yeah, you couldn't tell,
though, right?

1056
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,321
You are a psychopath.

1057
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,385
You're not... you're not
even ready to be a husband,

1058
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:41,096
let alone a...

1059
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,395
Let alone a what?

1060
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,338
Evie.

1061
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,381
Let alone a what?

1062
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,746
An actor?

1063
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:01,249
You're not a fucking actor.

1064
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,345
Wow.

1065
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:16,264
What happened to you?
Where's Dan?

1066
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:19,096
'Where's Dan? Where's Dan?'
Fuck Dan!

1067
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:20,872
Dan is boring. He's pathetic.

1068
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:22,901
Why do you keep going
on about Dan?

1069
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:25,536
I can be better
than Dan, Evie.

1070
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:31,505
I'm done with Dan.

1071
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,876
Yeah.

1072
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,453
Me too.

1073
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,267
(Door opens)

1074
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,711
DOCTOR: OK, so I will see you
next time?

1075
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,207
Have a good day.

1076
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:01,079
Richard, come on in.

1077
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,675
(Sighs)

1078
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:07,121
What's bothering you?

1079
01:08:07,117 --> 01:08:11,347
Um, well, I just wanted to
talk to you about Rowena.

1080
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,203
- Where are you going?
- Uh, I don't know.

1081
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,033
I just can't be here
right now.

1082
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:26,034
Why?

1083
01:08:26,036 --> 01:08:27,996
I saw Dr Barnes today.

1084
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:31,114
She said she hasn't seen you
in weeks.

1085
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:34,478
- And you don't have cancer.
- I don't have cancer.

1086
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:36,908
What the fuck is going on?

1087
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:38,483
Well, I just came
from the doctor

1088
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:41,222
and the results came back
and they are negative.

1089
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:43,118
I don't have cancer.
We beat it.

1090
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,850
No, it's bullshit.

1091
01:08:44,855 --> 01:08:46,955
Dr Barnes said she hasn't
seen you in weeks.

1092
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,817
I never said
I went to Dr Barnes.

1093
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:51,285
Yes, you did.
You said Dr Barnes.

1094
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,194
Well, honey, if I said that,
I'm sorry.

1095
01:08:53,196 --> 01:08:55,656
I thought I had cancer,
I was a bit confused.

1096
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:57,195
But I don't...

1097
01:08:58,234 --> 01:08:59,934
..have it.

1098
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:10,509
- So there's no cancer.
- No.

1099
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,881
(Cries)

1100
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:16,951
Are you crying?

1101
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:20,421
Aw...

1102
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,260
- Sweetie, are you crying?
- Yes, I'm fucking crying!

1103
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:26,361
- Ow! That hurt!
- Oh, did it? Good!

1104
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:28,063
I hurt you, good!

1105
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:30,834
Because I can't help but feel
that for the last few weeks,

1106
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:33,744
<i>you've been hurting me. Like,
deliberately or something.</i>

1107
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:36,197
- That is so crazy!
- Is it?

1108
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:37,906
Then how come you keep putting

1109
01:09:37,908 --> 01:09:39,868
photos of my dad up
all around the house?

1110
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:42,076
I put a couple up,
I don't keep putting...

1111
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:44,148
But you do! This is
what I'm talking about!

1112
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:46,307
You're not putting photos up,
except you are.

1113
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:49,016
Y-You didn't throw those
posters out, except you did.

1114
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:51,389
But only because you have
cancer, except you don't!

1115
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:53,088
I can't trust you anymore, Ro!

1116
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:55,919
I still don't know where
Roxy is. My dad's dead.

1117
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:58,226
I'm crying
all the fucking time.

1118
01:09:58,228 --> 01:10:00,858
I'm so dehydrated
and I can't help but feel

1119
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:03,064
that you are somehow...
you're behind it all!

1120
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:05,826
OK, firstly,
I did not kill your dad.

1121
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:12,244
(Chuckles) Boy, do I keep
picking the wrong times.

1122
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,342
So sorry.

1123
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,047
Richard, can you just...?

1124
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,750
Wait, Richard!

1125
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:24,351
Please, can you just stop
and talk to me?

1126
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:30,485
- Honey, please don't go.
- Why?

1127
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,933
Are you gonna actually tell me
what's going on?

1128
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:35,329
Like, look in my eyes and
actually tell me the truth?

1129
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,067
No, of course not.

1130
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,974
All I ever wanted
was to have a family with you.

1131
01:10:44,975 --> 01:10:47,905
And now...

1132
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:50,381
..shit, I'm almost glad
I couldn't get you pregnant.

1133
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,321
<i>I am pregnant.</i>

1134
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,329
What?

1135
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,202
- Please come here.
- No, what did you say?

1136
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,336
Don't fuck with me, Ro,
not about this.

1137
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:18,569
- What did you say?
- I said I'm pregnant.

1138
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,484
Is that true?

1139
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,880
Are you sure?
How can you be sure?

1140
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,382
Just, I am, I'm sure.

1141
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,822
You're pregnant?

1142
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:33,861
That's what all this
has been about?

1143
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:35,957
Why didn't you tell me?

1144
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,533
Scared.

1145
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,196
We're gonna have a baby?

1146
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,099
We're gonna have a baby?

Who's this?

01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,801
Hi, this is Monica
calling from...

1189
01:15:06,803 --> 01:15:09,903
You sound really cute, Monica.
I don't normally do girls

1190
01:15:09,906 --> 01:15:12,736
but I'm so horny tonight,
I'll make an exception.

1191
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:17,412
No, no, sorry, no. No.
I'm calling from Video Relay.

1192
01:15:17,413 --> 01:15:19,713
My name is Monica.
I have a caller on the line

1193
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:22,316
that uses sign language and
I'll be interpreting the call

1194

(Roughly) What?

1196
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:27,918
If you talk to me, I will
sign to the caller who's deaf

1197
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:30,424
and he will sign back to me
and I will talk to you.

1198
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:32,026
He's deaf?

1199
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,828
