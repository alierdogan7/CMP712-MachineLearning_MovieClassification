1
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:46,047
- Yes, I'm still on hold.
- MAN: <i>And what was this?</i>

2
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:50,093
I'm looking at your advertisement
for the airline promotion and giveaway.

3
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,220
<i>- Ah, this is our frequent flyer plan.</i>
- Yeah.

4
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:55,557
It's hard to understand
because it says, "In addition to."

5
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,101
But I can't exactly understand
"in addition to" what?

6
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,396
Because there's actually
nothing to add it to.

7
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,481
<i>I think that's a typo then.</i>

8
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:06,401
Okay, so just to clarify — I'm sorry.

9
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:10,405
Ten purchases of any of your
Healthy Choice products equals 500 miles.

10
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:14,325
And with the coupon, the same purchases
would value 1,000 miles?

11
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,994
<i>- That's it.</i>
- (heavy thump, faint)

12
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,997
Do you realize that the monetary value
of this promotion and the prize

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,666
is potentially worth more
than the purchases?

14
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,251
(metallic thwack)

15
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,630
<i>- I don't know.</i>
- (thwacking continues)

16
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,677
Could I call you back?

17
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,263
Could I ask you your extension
and your name, possibly?

18
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:38,725
<i>It's extension 215 and the name is Carter.</i>

19
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,351
Carter.

20
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,353
- Thank you very much, Carter.
<i>- All right.</i>

21
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,772
Good-bye.

22
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,416
(tires screeching)

23
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:21,244
- I'm not sure what that means.
- MAN: <i>If they break or something.</i>

24
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,872
<i>- What is it, plastic?</i>
- It's, uh, plastic, yeah.

25
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,040
But that kind of breakage
shouldn't be a problem.

26
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:29,103
<i>- Let me call you first thing tomorrow.</i>
- (muttering) In shipping we have insurance.

27
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,671
<i>I'm gonna run the numbers,
see what's what. I'll call back.</i>

28
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:34,173
Okay. You have my home
phone number, right?

29
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:37,176
<i>- What's that for?</i>
- If you wanted to call me.

30
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,221
- It's not a problem.
<i>- No, I'm fine. I have your work number.</i>

31
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:44,684
Okay. Because of the time difference,
if you needed to reach me earlier —

32
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,104
<i>No, that's fine.
I can just get you at your office.</i>

33
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,814
- Okay. All right.
<i>- Okay.</i>

34
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:51,482
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

35
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,846
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,447
Hi.

38
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,368
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

39
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,994
No.

40
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:48,498
- They're not open yet?
- They don't get open until 8:00.

41
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,084
Is it okay if I leave my car, you think?

42
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,586
I don't know. I-I don't know.

43
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,797
I thought they opened at 7:00.

44
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:02,887
- If I left my car, would it be okay?
- Geez, I don't know how they do it.

45
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:05,848
- Do you know them?
- Not very well.

46
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,893
Can I ask you —
Could I trust to leave my key with you

47
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:11,604
so that when they get here
you could give it to them?

48
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:13,856
Okay, yeah, sure.

49
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,701
- You think it's okay where I've left it?
- I think it'll be fine, yeah.

50
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,703
- I can watch it.
- Thanks a lot.

51
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,538
Keep an eye on it.

52
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,419
- There's a piano in the street.
- Yeah.

53
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,966
Okay. Maybe I'll see you later.
Thank you for your help.

54
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,384
Thank you.

55

- Yes.

73
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,644
Why you wearing a suit?

74
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:23,064
I bought one. I thought it would be nice
to get dressed for work.

It's not a piano. I got a piano at home.

00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,382
- Oh.
- Where'd you get it?

81
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:53,344
It was dropped in the street.

82
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,722
Why is it here?

My boss won't like that.
Can you guarantee all your sales?

00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,243
Barry, it's your sister.

165
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,871
- Hi. How are you?
- Hey, Elizabeth.

166
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,748
- How's it going?
- It's going great.

167
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,112
- Just stopped by to say hello.
- Terrific. How you doing?

168
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,327
- So you're going tonight, right?
- Yes, I'll be there.

169
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:38,796
- Cool.
- You're going?

170
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,008
Yes, I am. Actually, I came by to talk
to you about something in particular.

171
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:47,930
There's this girl from work who I think is really
cute and really cool, and I want you to meet her.

172
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:51,809
So I was thinking about bringing her
to the party tonight. What do you think?

173
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,729
Yeah, I don't want to do that.

174
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:59,108
- Why?
- I just — I don't do stuff like that.

175
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,735
Well, you don't really do anything.

176
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,405
Everybody would be looking at me.

177
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,157
So? What's wrong with looking at you?
It's a free country.

178
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:12,663
I just feel like I would be a little tense
and I don't think I'd act like myself.

179
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,416
Well, that's kind of your fault.

180
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,506
There's an outside chance
I'm not even coming tonight.

181
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,426
Oh. Really?

182
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,238
Everyone said you were coming.
Didn't you tell everybody you were coming?

183
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,306
I have to renew my gym membership.

184
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,017
Oh! Right.

185
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,436
Oh, God, well —
well, that solves everything, actually.

186
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,064
If you're not gonna come, I can just bring her.
It's not that big of a deal.

187
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,151
Oh, well, it'll be fine. Great.

188
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,989
- Please don't.
- I'm just trying to be your friend, Barry.

189
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,074
Hope you can make it!

190
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,039
WOMAN: Remember when Barry
used to get all mad?

191
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,207
- WOMAN #2: Oh, my God.
- WOMAN: He would freak out.

192
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,044
WOMAN #3: Because Rhonda
used to call him "gay boy" all the time.

193
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:03,047
- (all chattering)
- WOMAN: Remember the sliding glass door?

194
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,550
He threw that hammer
through the sliding glass door!

195
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:10,262
WOMAN #4: He got glass in his foot and
Mom and Dad had to take him to the hospital.

196
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:13,783
WOMAN: He came home from the hospital and
locked himself in the bathroom with the hammer.

197
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,934
(women chattering)

198
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,686
- Hey! There he is!
- Hi.

199
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,314
- ALL: Hi!
- We were just talking about you.

200
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,317
Remember when we used to call you "gay boy"
and you'd get all mad?

201
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,694
- What's that?
- We used to call you "gay boy." Remember?

202
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:28,739
You'd be fine, and then we'd call
you "gay boy," you'd just freak out.

203
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,324
We were calling you gay,

204
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,410
and you got so mad you threw the hammer
through the sliding glass door.

205
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,412
- I don't remember that.
- Yes, you do.

206
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,998
We were calling you "gay boy,"
and you got so mad.

207
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:41,001
- Are you gay now?
- I don't know.

208
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:42,711
- (all laughing)
- I don't know.

209
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:45,047
We were trying to figure out
why you had the hammer.

210
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,342
- Why are you wearing that suit?
- I-I-I... I don't know.

211
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,968
- I like the suit.
- Thank you!

212
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,946
Are you using that dandruff
shampoo I bought you?

213
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,097
- Yes.
- Barry. Barry.

214
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,683
- You are?
- Barry, why'd you have the hammer?

215
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,352
Why did I have the hammer? Wh —

216
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,146
- He was building a doghouse.
- Oh, okay. Rhonda.

217
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,148
- (all chattering)
- Happy birthday.

218
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,858
Thanks for coming.

219
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,361
Oh, a cake. We have a cake.

220
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,906
- You got a cake?
- Hey, I was just thinking about you.

221
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,658
Glad you could make it.

222
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,160
Mr. Chatty. Hi, Mr. Chatty. (kisses)

223
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,870
- You have rice in your hair.
- Oh...

224
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,081
Did you say hello to your brother-in-laws?

225
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,334
- Hey, Barry. How you doing?
- Mike. How you doing, pal?

226
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:25,129
- Good to see you.
- I saw your car out front. Pretty snazzy.

227
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:28,841
- Hey, Barry. How's it goin'?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

228
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,467
How's it going?

229
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,136
How's work?

230
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,263
Business is very food, thank you.

231
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,348
What's "very food"?

232
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:39,560
- What's that?
- You just said, "Very food."

233
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,354
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant to say, "Very good."

234
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,233
Maybe you said "food,"
uh, 'cause you're hungry.

235
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,944
- You know, you want to eat.
- That makes sense.

236
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:52,030
(chattering continues)

237
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:56,160
Is your friend here?

238
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,412
No. You're off the hook, Barry.

239
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,706
- She couldn't make it.
- Thank you.

240
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,834
- You nervous?
- No.

241
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,586
You look nervous.

242
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,755
- I feel very happy.
- Oh, good.

243
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,215
Did you get your gym membership?

244
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,469
- Tomorrow.
- (chattering continues)

245
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:17,931
Hey! I had a girl I was gonna bring for Barry,
and he wouldn't let me do it.

246
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:21,143
So, I had this girl I was gonna bring for him,
and she's totally awesome.

247
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,728
- We work together.
- Yeah?

248
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,439
And he said that, uh,
he couldn't be himself.

249
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,357
RHONDA: Come on, gay boy.
It's time to eat.

250
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:31,320
ELIZABETH: I don't know. Maybe he's worried
we're gonna give him a bunch of shit about it.

251
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,572
He said he wouldn't come if I brought her.

252
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,242
SISTER: He did? He's such a fuckin' asshole!
Why do you listen to him?

253
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,912
ELIZABETH: I don't know.
I was totally gonna bring her.

254
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:43,123
- It would've been, like, totally casual.
- Look at him!

255
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,625
(glass shattering)

256
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,088
SISTER: What the fuck is your problem?

257
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,508
ELIZABETH: You fucking retard, Barry!

258
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,635
(all shouting)

259
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,642
I'm sorry about that.

260
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,062
- Sorry about what I did.
- It's all right.

261
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:10,192
I wanted to ask you something
because you're a doctor, right?

262
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,861
Yeah.

263
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:18,116
I don't like myself sometimes.

264
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,956
Can you help me?

265
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,877
Barry, I'm a dentist. I...

266
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,213
What kind of help
do you think I can give you?

267
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,842
I know.
Uh, maybe you know other doctors?

268
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,385
Like a psychiatrist?

269
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:40,138
I just don't have anybody else
I can talk to about things,

270
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,517
and I understand
it's confidential with a doctor.

271
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,938
I just, um —
I don't want my sisters to know. Okay?

272
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,649
'Cause I'm embarrassed about this.

273
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,444
Barry, if it's about getting you
a phone number for a psychiatrist,

274
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,113
I can do that.

275
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,823
It's not a problem.

276
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,910
But what exactly is wrong?

277
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:07,165
I don't know if there is anything wrong
because I don't know how other people are.

278
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,963
I sometimes cry a lot...

279
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,341
for no reason.

280
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,101
(stifled sobbing)

281
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,315
I'm sorry.

282
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,692
(whimpering)

283
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,776
Dollar, 79.

284
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,764
(whispering) What am I looking for?

285
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,809
What am I looking for? Please tell me.

286
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:52,729
Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me.

287
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,818
Pudding.

00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,931

289
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,058

292
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,325
Yes, it is.

<i>Can I have your credit card number
followed by the expiration date?</i>

294
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:53,749
Sure. Uh, how much is this, anyways?

295
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:59,046
<i>It's 2.99 per minute for the first half-hour
and 1.99 per minute after that.</i>

296
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,131
Okay, and it's confidential?

297
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,632
<i>What do you mean?</i>

298
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,969
The information I give you,
it's private, confidential?

299
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,387
<i>Of course. Yeah.</i>

300
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,389
<i>Would you like to talk to a girl?</i>

301
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,767
<i>I can connect you with a beautiful girl</i>

302
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,021

(continues, faint)

328
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,892
JANICE: <i>We're all set.</i>

329
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:39,938
<i>Can I have a telephone number, area code first,
on where we can call you back?</i>

330
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:43,567
Could you possibly just
connect me to one of the girls?

331
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,194
<i>It's a callback service.
A girl will call you back.</i>

332
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,821
Okay, eh...

333
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:51,366
I just was calling to speak
with one of the girls.

334
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,076
I thought that's how it worked.

335
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,703
- I'm at 8-1-8...
<i>- Okay.</i>

336
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,080
- 7-7-5...
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

337
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,667
3-9-9-3.

338
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,503
<i>Okay. And what kind of a girl
would you like to talk to?</i>

339
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:07,924
I don't want anybody to know it's me though.
I don't want them to know my name. Okay?

340
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:11,720
<i>- Nobody'll know your name.</i>
- Okay, if you could tell her my name is Jack.

341
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:13,847
<i>- You want her to call you Jack?</i>
- Sure.

342
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,141
I just don't want her to know it's me.

343
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:18,268
<i>- Okay, that's fine, Jack.</i>
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

344
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,437
<i>No problem.
So we'll call you right back. Okay?</i>

345
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,731
- Terrific.
<i>- Okay.</i>

346
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,441
(beeps)

347
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,946
WOMAN (on TV):
<i>...ever increasing, expanding program.</i>

348
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,074
(clears throat, continues, faint)

349
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,844
(rings)

350
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,138
Hello, this is Back.

351
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:57,265
WOMAN: <i>I'm calling for Jack.</i>

352
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,643
How you doing?

353
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,102
<i>Hi. How are</i> you <i>doing?</i>

354
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,021
- This is Jack.
<i>- This is Georgia.</i>

355
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:06,524
- Hiya.
<i>- Hiya. What are you doing tonight?</i>

356
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,985
Nothing. What are you doing?

357
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,529
<i>I am laying on my bed.</i>

358
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,282
Where are you?

359
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,825
<i>I'm in my bedroom.</i>

360
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,119
No, I mean, what state.
What city are you in?

361
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,081
<i>- I'm in California.</i>
- Me too. I'm in California.

362
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,541
<i>I know you are, baby. I'm in Los Angeles.</i>

363
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,253
- I'm in Los Angeles too.
<i>- Well, well, well.</i>

364
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:29,339
<i>Maybe we should hook up sometime.
What do you think?</i>

365
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,259
<i>Are you watching a porno movie, Jack?</i>

366
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,386
No, I'm not, Georgia.

367
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:37,430
<i>- Do you like porno movies?</i>
- Sure.

368
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,015
<i>Yeah?</i>

369
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,935
<i>So, Jack, are you stroking it?</i>

370
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,688
No.

371
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,773
<i>What are you doing then?</i>

372
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm talking to you.

373
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,277
<i>With your pants off?</i>

374
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,821
No, my pants are on.

375
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,783
<i>I'm only wearing a T-shirt and panties.</i>

376
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,370
- Really?
<i>- Yeah, really.</i>

377
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:04,040
<i>And I'm looking at
my shaved pussy in the mirror.</i>

378
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:07,127
<i>- Do you want to know what I look like?</i>
- Doesn't matter.

379
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,337
<i>What do you mean, it doesn't matter?</i>

380
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,757
Well, I have no way of finding out,
so it doesn't matter.

381
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,509
<i>I'm not lying to you, Jack.</i>

382
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:20,390
<i>I'm about 5 foot 8, 34-28-34.
My friends say I'm gorgeous.</i>

383
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,851
- Really?
<i>- Yeah, really.</i>

384
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,978
<i>- What about you?</i>
- That doesn't matter.

385
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,980
<i>Yes, it does.</i>

386
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,859
- Mmm —
<i>- You're married, aren't you?</i>

387
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:33,737
- No.
<i>- No? You have a girlfriend?</i>

388
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,655
- Yes.
<i>- Oh.</i>

389
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,282
<i>Where is she?</i>

390
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:40,869
<i>She went out of town.</i>

391
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,747
<i>Oh! Good. I like that.</i>

392
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,750
<i>I'm so horny, Jack. What about you?</i>

393
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,501
Sure.

394
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,295
<i>Do you like peaches, Jack?</i>

395
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,380
They're okay.

396
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,675
<i>Well, you'll like 'em even better,
'cause I'm a Georgia peach.</i>

397
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,218
(chuckles)

398
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,387
<i>Are you jacking off yet, Jack?</i>

399
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:01,139
No, I'm not.

400
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:04,267
<i>Well... do you ever?</i>

401
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,021
Sometimes, yeah, when I'm lonely.

402
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,399
<i>Well, you don't have to be lonely anymore,
'cause you got me now.</i>

403
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:15,820
You sound very nice and very personable.

404
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:18,740
(laughs) <i>Very personable. Thank you, baby.</i>

405
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:21,117
<i>So, what do you do, Barry?</i>

406
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,828
I work. I have my own business.

407
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:26,623
I work hard at doing my business.

408
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:29,209
<i>- Are you good at your business?</i>
- Yes.

409
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:33,254
<i>Yeah? So, do you do really well?
Do you make tons of money?</i>

410
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:38,009
I'm doing pretty good, I think, as a start.

411
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:41,012
I wish I was making more,
doing a little bit better,

412
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,181
but I can't get over a certain hump.

413
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:48,103
I will. I'll crack something very soon,
I think, and really do better.

414
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,438
I'd like to diversify.

415
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:53,608
But I'm doing great, I think, as a start.

416
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:56,069
<i>Are you stroking it yet, baby?</i>

417
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:00,198
- No, I'm not.
<i>- Is your cock hard?</i>

418
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:02,784
I don't know what it's doing right now.

419
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,204
<i>Why don't you take your clothes off, Jack?</i>

420
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:11,835
<i>And I want to picture you
laying down with me next to you.</i>

421
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,547
<i>And I want you to stroke your cock, okay?</i>

422
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,591
(whispers) <i>Okay?</i>

423
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:23,721
<i>Okay? I'm so horny, Barry. I want you.</i>

424
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,614
(phone rings)

425
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,994
(rings)

426
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:48,455
- This is Barry.
- GEORGIA: <i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

427
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,875
<i>- How are you?</i>
- I'm fine. Nothing. How are you?

428
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,793
<i>It's me. It's Georgia.</i>

429
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,838
How's it going? Good morning.

430
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,757
<i>- It's okay that I'm calling, right?</i>
- Sure.

431
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:03,636
<i>I just wanted to call and talk to you
and thank you for last night</i>

432
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,681
<i>and, um, just catch you
before you went to work and say hey.</i>

433
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:08,892
Well, thank you.

434
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,687
<i>I am so tired.
I went to bed so late last night.</i>

435
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,772
<i>What about you? When did you go to sleep?</i>

436
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,691
Not very late.

437
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,944
<i>- Well, you going to work now?</i>
- Yes.

438
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,947
<i>- Can I ask you a question?</i>
- Sure.

439
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,741
<i>Remember last night when we were talking</i>

440
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,076
<i>and I was telling you
about my apartment and my rent?</i>

441
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,786
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Remember?</i>

442
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,330
- Mm-hmm.
- (Georgia laughs)

443
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,874
<i>This is so weird
and really embarrassing for me.</i>

444
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,501
- No.
<i>- But, um...</i>

445
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:38,129
<i>I was wondering if maybe you could
help me out with some money.</i>

446
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,340
- Me?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

447
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,593
Uh, yeah — No, I'm sorry.

448
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,094
I can't afford that.

449
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,847
<i>But you don't even know how much it is.</i>

450
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,307
How much is it?

451
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,310
<i>Like seven, 50. 750.</i>

452
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,729
Yeah, no, no. I can't afford that.

453
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,397
I'm s-sorry. Sorry.

454
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:57,899
<i>Seriously?</i>

455
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:01,069
You're having trouble. Financial trouble?

456
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:05,615
<i>It's so hard these days,
and, yeah, I really need it.</i>

457
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:10,245
Yeah, I just don't have enough money
to be able to do that. I'm sorry.

458
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:15,124
<i>I thought you said you had your own business.
You said you were going to diversify.</i>

459
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,877
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- So you think you can?</i>

460
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,881
I'm sorry.

461
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:25,176
<i>Maybe I should call back
and talk to your girlfriend?</i>

462
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,638
<i>Maybe it'd be better
to ask her for the money.</i>

463
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,849
<i>It could be really easy, you know, Barry.
I have all your information.</i>

464
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,727
<i>I have your credit card information,
all of your billing stuff—</i>

465
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,813
- Okay, no, thank you.
- (phone beeps)

466
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,319
- Good morning, Barry.
- Morning, Lance.

467
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,321
What's with all this pudding?
What is this?

468
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:49,158
Oh, that's part of a pretty amazing airline
promotional giveaway that's really tremendous.

469
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,220
I'm gonna start a collection
of puddings and coupons

470
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,538
that can be redeemed
for frequent flyer miles

471
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,665
through Healthy Choice
and American Airlines.

472
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,875
- You going on a trip?
- No, no.

473
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,837
But airline mileage
is like a currency these days.

474
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,256
- You should go on a trip.
- Yeah, no, thank you.

475
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,425
So, what do you want me to do with it?

476
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,844
Why don't we just leave it there for now.

477
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,642

Thank you very much. I'm doing well.
My name is Barry Egan.

486
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:22,919
- WOMAN (on phone): <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- I have a little problem with my Mastercard.

<i>- Okay.</i>

I, uh, lost it and I found it again,

00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,517
<i>- Okay, what's the account number?</i>
- Okay.

492
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,520
I did punch that in earlier. I'm sorry.

493
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:42,897
I just — I-I'm nervous about the whole situation.

494
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,109
Is there the proper —
I don't know the etiquette in this situation.

495
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,529
I just wanna make sure
that no one spent any money so far.

496
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,531
- I don't have money to burn.
<i>- Okay.</i>

497
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,616
<i>- Uh, but there's nothing —</i>
- I'm clean for now?

498
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,287
<i>- Yes, um, everything is fine.</i>
- Yeah, I'm sorry to sound panicked.

499
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,872
<i>- That's okay —</i>
- What's your name?

500
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:02,166
<i>- My name is Jeanette.</i>
- Nice to meet you.

501
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,836
- So I'm gonna go ahead and cut it up.
<i>- Okay, that's fine.</i>

502
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,798
I'll cut up my card then
a-and, um, get a new one going. Right?

503
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,466
<i>- Yes, you will.</i>
- Thank you very much.

504
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,884
<i>- You're welcome.</i>
- Okay.

That shouldn't be there, Rico!

507
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,323
I don't want to be a dick,
but that could hurt somebody.

508
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:37,785
It already did hurt somebody.
It hurt me. Let's please move that.

He's wearing that goddamn suit again.
I don't know why he's wearing that suit.

512
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,423
- He doesn't usually dress like that.
- It's fine.

513

Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you wearing that suit again?

- Yes, I do.
- This is Lena.

517

She's a good friend from work.

00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,314
We were in the neighborhood.
She had to pick up her car.

We're getting breakfast before we go in.
Want to go? We're gonna eat. Let's go.

520
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,569
- Yeah, I can't.
- Why?

521
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,571
I have to work. I have to stay here.

522
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,573
Seriously, though,
we're going to eat, I said.

523
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,575
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. That's all right.

524
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:20,119
What is that?
Are you learning to play the piano?

525
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:21,788
(mutters) That's not a piano.

526
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,289
- (shouts) Lance!
- Yeah?

527
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,291
Remember, we have to
call that guy in Toledo.

528
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,418

What's all that pudding?

531
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:38,304
I don't know. I'm gonna talk to you
in a second. Let me just get this.

532
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,556
ELIZABETH: What's that pudding, Barry?

533
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,266

534
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,268
<i>I guess we got disconnected before.</i>

535
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:45,853
We got disconnect —

536
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,272
How did you get this number?
You're calling me at work?

537
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,484
<i>You canceled your credit card.
I need you not to cancel your credit card.</i>

538
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,486
<i>And I need you to up your limit.</i>

539
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,113
Okay, this is making me
very uncomfortable.

540
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:59,116
<i>I need help.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?</i>

541
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,828
<i>Maybe I should just call back
and talk to your girlfriend.</i>

542
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,830
- I don't have a girlfriend.
<i>- You said you did.</i>

543
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:06,415
- I know, but I don't.
<i>- You lied to me?</i>

544
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:09,919
This is illegal, okay?
I'm sorry. I'll call the police.

545
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,712
<i>No, you won't.</i>

546
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:15,842
- This is a little embarrassing. I'm sorry.
- I'll go pay for my car.

547
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,260
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

548
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:20,888
He's being weird. I have no idea why
he's being weird and dressed in that suit.

549
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,612
LENA (chuckles): It's not bad. It's okay.

550
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,269
He's so strange. I don't even know if you'd
really want to go out with someone like him.

551
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:29,522
- It's all right. I'll just pay for my car.
- I'm sorry.

552
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:40,783
<i>- Come on, rich boy. I thought we had fun.</i>
- This isn't cool.

553
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:43,148
<i>- You thought it was cool last night.</i>
- I'm gonna hang up.

554
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,097
<i>You have no idea what could happen,
you motherfucker.</i>

555
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,164
- I have to go.
<i>- You're making a big mi —</i>

556
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:50,459
- What do you think? She's cool, right?
- Why did you just come by like this?

557
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,169
- It's not cool?
- No, it's fine.

558
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:55,339
- It's just, I feel put on the spot.
- Do you think you'll ask her out?

559
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:57,967
- Are you gonna do it?
- I don't do things like that.

560
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,969
You don't do <i>anything.</i>
Why are you being scared?

561
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:03,556
I'm not being scared. I just —
You're gonna rag on me if I do this.

562
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,475
I'm not gonna rag you.
Why would I do this just to rag you?

563
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,912
- (mutters) I don't know.
- Can I ask you a serious question?

564
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,272
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?

565
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,193
Barry, did you ask Walter
to get you a shrink?

566
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,696
What's the matter with you? Are you okay?

567
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,616
He is lying.

568
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:25,870
You're being weird again.
Come on. Please don't be weird.

569
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,413
We should be going.

570
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:31,334
Yep — No, I have to get
something from my car.

571
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,712
What guy in Toledo are you talking about?

572
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,797
I'm talking about the guy.

573
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:40,885
- I'll come over, I'll tell you later.
- Are you talking about the Ramada Inn?

574
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:44,138
I'll just come over to you
in — in a second.

575
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:52,322
I'm sorry I couldn't come to
your sister's birthday party last night.

576
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,649
Elizabeth invited me,
and I couldn't make it.

577
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:58,027
Not a problem. Don't worry about it.
We had a terrific time though.

578
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,321
Must be weird
for you to have so many sisters.

579
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,406
No, not at all. It's very nice.

580
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,034
- Telephone, Barry. Line one.
- Pardon me.

581
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,912
- (line beeps)
- This is Barry.

582
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:10,265
GEORGIA: <i>Hang up again
and see the trouble it's gonna make.</i>

583
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,375
- Thank you.
<i>- What do you mean, thank —</i>

584
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,169
- Business is good. You're busy.
- Yeah. Um, not really.

585
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,922
- I saw a picture of you.
- Oh, yes?

586
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:21,634
Elizabeth has a picture of you guys,
your sisters and you.

587
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,803
It's a lot of family. It must be nice.

588
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,805
- Do you have brothers or sisters?
- No.

589
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:27,306
I'm the exact opposite.

590
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,016
- (phone rings)
- That must be nice.

591
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,161
- That must be really, really, really —
- (phone rings)

592
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:33,187
No, it's terrible.

593
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:38,317
- What's the pudding for?
- That's something else.

594
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:41,153
- Gonna get pancakes?
- Yes, we are.

595
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,947
- You're going up —
- (driver shrieks)

596
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,783
- Oh, my God.
- How long have you worked with my sister?

597
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,202
- (Lance shouting in Spanish)
- Six months, maybe five.

598
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,496
- So you know her.
- Do you want to check that?

599
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,665
- Sure.
- (Spanish continues)

600
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,542
Are you guys hurt? Are you okay?

601
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:58,587
They're okay. So, you do what she does?
The same job, the same work as her?

602
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,089
I do.

603
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:03,092
But I do mainly field consultations too.

604
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:06,679
Which is cool 'cause I get to travel.
I'm going to Hawaii on Friday.

605
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:09,223
Hawaii? I was thinking about going there.

606
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,851
- Really?
- I was thinking about going there on business.

607
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:15,021
- Well, if you're gonna go...
- I'm probably not gonna go though.

608
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:18,524
Oh, that's — that's too bad,
'cause it's so great over there,

609
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,736
and if you were there we could
say hello to each other or something.

610
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,448
That would be great, but I have so much
going on. A lot depends on this thing.

611
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:29,535
If it happens, I won't be able to go.
But if it doesn't, I might be able to.

612
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:33,748
I can't find that thing in my car,
but I can give it to you later.

613
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:36,042
So, are you gonna come eat with us?

614
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,585
- Yeah, I can't.
- Whoa!

615
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:39,545
- (Lena gasps)
- Oh, my God!

616
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,088
LANCE: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

617
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:43,215
- It was great to meet you again.
- What was that?

618
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:46,570
- Thanks for helping me yesterday and —
- What is that piano? What is this pudding?

619
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:48,137
- I don't know.
- Why are they here?

620
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,680
- I have no idea.
- Call me later.

621
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:51,604
We can talk about
asking Walter for the shrink.

622
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,952
- And he said you have this crying problem.
- LENA: Bye, Barry.

623
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,645
- ELIZABETH: Call me later.
- (Lance shouting in Spanish)

624
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,482
ELIZABETH: He's obviously very busy.

625
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:02,610
I don't even know
if he has time for a girlfriend.

626
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,570
Sorry.

627
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,281
- So I'll just see you at the restaurant?
- Okay.

628
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:27,593
(Lance, workers chattering in Spanish)

629
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:39,230
Um, I'm gonna go and eat tomorrow night.
Do you want to go with me?

630
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,148
Sure.

631
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:43,150
Do you want to pick me up?

632
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:44,693
Sure.

633
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:47,404
Can I write down my address
and phone number for you?

634
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:49,115
Sure.

635
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,872
- This is funny.
- Yeah.

636
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,251
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

637
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,045
(Lance continues in Spanish)

638
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:06,340
I didn't ask for a shrink.
That must have been somebody else.

639
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,467
Also, that pudding isn't mine.

640
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:12,096
Also, I'm wearing a suit today because
I had a very important meeting this morning.

641
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:15,391
- And I don't have a crying problem.
- Okay.

642
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,315
(mutters) Okay.

643
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:25,067
- Hi.
- Hi.

644
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,652
Hi.

645
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,117
(phone rings)

646
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,121
(rings)

647
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:39,915
This is Barry.

648
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:42,918
GEORGIA: <i>You just made a fucking war
for yourself that you can't afford.</i>

649
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:44,837
(line: receiver slams down)

650
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,386
WOMAN (moaning): <i>Ooh, yeah.</i>

651
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:55,657
- MAN: How do you know this guy's rich?
- GEORGIA: He said he was gonna diversify.

652
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,725
- Diversify what?
- His business.

653
00:41:57,808 --> 00:42:00,436
- And what is his name?
- Barry Egan.

654
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,897
- I can take the brothers on this mission?
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,398
We'll do it.

656
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,942
Thank you so much.

657
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:16,660
- (feedback)
- Check. Check. One, two. Test. Test.

658
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:18,412
- How's that sound?
- Bring it down.

659
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,623
You can't do that. It's wrong.

660
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,333
Check.

661
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,335
Check, check, check. Hold on.

662
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,629
One, two, test. Check.

663
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,130
They'll go.

664
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:29,632
Great. (sighs)

665
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:32,092
- I'm only paying two of you guys.
- That's cool.

666
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:34,094
- When can you leave?
- If you want —

667
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,388
I want you to go right away.
I think that's best.

668
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:40,851
I also really need you to check out a car
for me down there that this guy's selling.

669
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:45,648
- Your expenses are your own.
- But Latisha said you were gonna cover —

670
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,710
- She didn't know what she was talking about.
- Whatever, man. That's not cool.

671
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:52,446
David, don't. Seriously. Doesn't make sense
if you think about it in a fair, deal-like sense.

672
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,925
- Okay? It's business.
- WOMAN: Baby, are you stroking your cock?

673
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:58,911
$100, two days work. A lot more than your
family's making, sitting around your house.

674
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:01,622
(chuckles) All right?
Now, I'm serious now. Okay?

675
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:03,874
Please. Now just stop.

676
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:06,418
Keys to the truck. You gotta gas that up.

677
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,003
Save receipts on that.

678
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,547
His address.

679
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:14,301
We have his business address too, but —

680
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:16,262
You know what?

681
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:19,265
(sighs) Hit him at his house first.

682
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:24,019
See what this little bad boy
businessman is all about.

683
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:26,438
- Just fix it, sir.
- (Lena, Barry laugh)

684
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:30,484
And now I want — I want to tell you something.
I've got to tell you.

685
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,111
Oh, no.

686
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:34,571
I saw a picture of you guys,
your sisters and you,

687
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:37,116
and... I saw your picture

688
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,660
and I really wanted to meet you.

689
00:43:43,706 --> 00:43:47,793
I came to drop my car off, on purpose,
to try and meet you.

690
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:52,131
Ha-ha-ha. What, are you lying?

691
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:53,924
No.

692
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:55,759
- Oh, my...
- I thought I should tell you.

693
00:43:55,843 --> 00:44:00,681
I didn't want to get too far along
on going out and be hiding something.

694
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,145
It was very nice of you to say.

695
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:07,771
Terrific.

696
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:13,110
I was listening to these morning DJs
this morning.

697
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:17,364
They always have couples that call in and...
and talk about their problems.

698
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:23,245
And this DJ Justice —
this morning DJ that I really like.

699
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:26,749
And they were talking about pictures,
about yearbook pictures

700
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:29,752
and how nobody's happy
with the way they look in their pictures.

701
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:33,589
And I just love this guy
because he tells it the way it is.

702
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,591
He's, you kn — He's not a phony.

703
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:40,512
And this guy calls up
and he's talking about his senior quote.

704
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:44,266
So DJ Justice says, "What was your senior
quote? What was so great about it?"

705
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,354
And he says, "I stole an ancient proverb."
And so he says, "Okay."

706
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:51,440
And he, uh, says, "Confusion say —"

707
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,567
- (Lena laughing)
- And then DJ Justice —

708
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,153
"Confusion or Confucius?"

709
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:57,905
And it was just so comical.

710
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:02,034
DJ Justice just cuts you down to size.
That's my favorite part of the show.

711
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:05,120
I laugh — I laugh and laugh.
Even when I'm alone.

712
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:11,126
So, uh, how's your business going?
Did you sell all that pudding?

713
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,508
That pudding is not a sales item.

714
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,010
Why?

715
00:45:22,513 --> 00:45:25,349
It's not for sale.

716
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,476
Really? Uh...

717
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,228
Wh-Why is that?

718
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:34,024
I'd rather not say, if that's okay.

719
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:37,361
Oh. I'm sorry.
What is it, like, a secret pudding?

720
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:43,158
Let's just keep it between you and I,
if that's possible.

721
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:45,077
Sure, sure.

722
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:51,041
(whispering)
Healthy Choice and American Airlines

723
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,794
got together for this promotion.

724
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:57,047
If you buy any ten
of Healthy Choice products,

725
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:59,883
they will award you
500 frequent flyer miles.

726
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:04,012
With this special coupon,
they'll up it to a thousand miles.

727
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:08,892
So I think they're trying to
push their teriyaki chicken, which is $1.79.

728
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:11,520
But I went to the supermarket
and I looked around,

729
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,689
and I saw that they had pudding

730
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:15,649
for 25 cents a cup.

731
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:18,318
Comes in packages of four.

732
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:20,529
But, insanely,

733
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:24,199
the bar codes are on the individual cups.

734
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:27,578
So, a quarter a cup...

735
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:30,080
Say you bought $2.50 worth.

736
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:32,624
That's worth 500 miles.

737
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,835
With the coupon, it's a thousand miles.

738
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:37,963
It's a marketing mistake,
but I'm taking advantage of it.

739
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:41,717
If you were to spend $3,000,

740
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,094
that would get you
a million frequent flyer miles.

741
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:47,222
You would never have to pay for a ticket
the rest of your life.

742
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:50,684
So you — you bought all that pudding
so that you could get frequent flyer miles?

743
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,060
Yeah, yeah. Yes.

744
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:54,563
That's insane.

745
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,732
I'm guessing it was a mistake.

746
00:46:56,815 --> 00:47:00,611
But I'm taking advantage of it
while it's offered.

747
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:02,029
Ah.

748
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:05,699
Who knows how long it'll last
if too many people start doing it.

749
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:07,201
Mm-hmm.

750
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:12,122
Your sister was telling me
a very funny story about you —

751
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:13,999
when you guys —

752
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,626
when you were kids.

753
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:19,296
You were building a ramp for the dog
and you threw a hammer through a window.

754
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,341
You threw a hammer
straight through a sliding glass door.

755
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:24,009
Is that right?

756
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:30,724
Threw a hammer.
I don't remember doing that.

757
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,434
(exhales)

758
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:34,311
My sister's a liar.

759
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:38,857
I have to go to the bathroom.

760
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:46,448
(gasps)

761
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,660
(shouting)

762
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:58,001
Okay. Sorry.

763
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,589
And the waiter come by yet?

764
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:04,091
- Hello.
- Hi.

765
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:06,677
- Can I talk to you, sir?
- Why?

766
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,179
- I just need you for a second, please.
- Okay.

767
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:16,478
- Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.
- Yeah.

768
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:19,064
- Did you do it?
- No.

769
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,942
- You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
- No.

770
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:23,944
Well, who did?

771
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:27,155
I don't know.

772
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,242
- Sir, your hand is bleeding.
- I cut myself.

773
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:32,703
- How?
- On my knife.

774
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:36,915
What? What?

775
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,917
- Sir, your hand is bleeding.
- I know.

776
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:42,129
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

777
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:45,299
Sir, I've got no way to prove
that you smashed up the bathroom —

778
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:46,800
I didn't do that. I didn't.

779
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:50,095
- Look, I'm gonna have to ask you to go.
- Okay. I didn't do it though.

780
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:53,348
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- Please don't do this to me.

781
00:48:53,432 --> 00:48:56,518
- Sir, I'm gonna call the police.
- All right. Can I just stay?

782
00:48:56,602 --> 00:49:00,314
Sir, I'm gonna crack your fuckin' head open.
Get out of here.

783
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:05,193
(whispers) We should go.
I think I don't like it here, okay?

784
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:06,778
- Okay.
- All right.

785
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:13,660
BARRY: Thank you.

786
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:18,517
- Okay. (chuckling)
- Okay. You hit it. You can tell.

787
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,353
Oh, yeah. So, um,

788
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:24,189
you know that —

789
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:27,901
the harmonium that —
it's ended up in your office?

790
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,616
Harmonium?

791
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:37,327
The piano.

792
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:44,042
Did you steal that from the street?

793
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:47,045
What's this?

794
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:51,299
You did, didn't you?

795
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:57,472
Yeah, I did. Why? Is it yours?

796
00:50:57,556 --> 00:50:59,474
No, it's yours.

797
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:07,983
Um, you learning to play it?

798
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:11,194
Um —

799
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:14,656
- I wouldn't put on any concerts yet.
- (laughing)

800
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,075
- I'm trying.
- Okay.

801
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:20,454
So, I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry
about the pudding

802
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:22,706
and the harmonium and everything,
but, um, I...

803
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:26,293
- Not at all.
- You must travel quite a lot.

804
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:29,212
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I don't travel.

805
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:34,593
Oh.

806
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:38,180
Uh, you want to take a left just up here.

807
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:40,932
Okay, I'm gonna go.

808
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:42,768
Well, it's good to see you again.

809
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:45,520
Good to see your face again
and go out with you.

810
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:48,315
I'm gonna be around or back in town
in a few days.

811
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,525
- But if you come to Hawaii...
- I don't know.

812
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:53,449
- You don't think you'll go? Okay.
- We'll see about that. I don't know.

813
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:56,156
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Okay.

814
00:51:58,992 --> 00:52:00,911
Have a good trip.

815
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:03,288
And bye-bye.

816
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:06,958
(door closes)

817
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:11,880
And bye-bye.

818
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:16,426
And bye-bye, you fuckin' —

819
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,471
And bye-bye, you stupid motherfucker.

820
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,056
(bell dings)

821
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,772
WOMAN: Are you Barry?

822
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:33,902
- Yes.
- This is for you.

823
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:40,534
Okay.

824
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:49,918
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

825
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:56,466
This is Barry.

826
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,760
<i>It's me. It's Lena.</i>

827
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:00,804
Mmm. Hi.

828
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:04,349
<i>I just wanted you to know,</i>

829
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:08,311
<i>wherever you're going
or whatever you're doing right now,</i>

830
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:11,731
<i>I want you to know
that I wanted to kiss you just then.</i>

831
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,401
Really?

832
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,112
<i>Yeah.</i>

833
00:53:17,988 --> 00:53:19,614
(bell dings)

834
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:56,318
(alarm blaring)

835
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:09,456
(doorbell rings)

836
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,891
That was good. (panting)

837
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:29,309
Yeah.

838
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,603
I'll see you later.

839
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:33,188
Okay.

840
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:38,318
I don't freak out very often.

841
00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:41,112
What do you mean?

842
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:44,449
No matter what my sister says, okay?

843
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,493
I don't know what you mean.

844
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:49,412
- (whispers) I don't freak out.
- Okay.

845
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:52,415
Have a good trip.

846
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:54,000
Thank you.

847
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,092
(door opens)

848
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:25,699
(tires squeal)

849
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:55,395
(beeping)

850
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:04,070
So, I got $500. That's maximum —

851
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:07,365
- That's what I can take out in a day.
- Okay.

852
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:10,744
This is what you get
when you're a pervert.

853
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:12,829
Said you'd help somebody out
and you didn't,

854
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:16,041
so we're just gonna take this money
back to her, and that's that.

855
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:21,087
Okay, but before you guys go,
I wanted to bring up one thing.

856
00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:22,881
I said no to Georgia.

857
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:25,467
She wanted the money, and I had to decline

858
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,552
because I don't really have that much.

859
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:30,722
That money I just gave you
is actually a lot of money to me.

860
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:33,308
"99 cents."
So, I don't know if this is fair.

861
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:36,978
Wait, whoa. Wait. No, no, plea —
Ow! Ow! Wait, ouch, ouch!

862
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,276
You wanna fuck
with what my brothers are saying?

863
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,403
You wanna fuck with my family? Fuck!

864
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:47,322
(groaning)

865
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:55,205
(whimpering)

866
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,333
(engine revving)

867
00:57:02,629 --> 00:57:04,547
(tires screeching)

868
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:07,217
(gasping)

869
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:13,098
Help me!

870
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:20,271
- (groans)
- (truck approaches)

871
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:24,859
(grunting)

872
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:31,449
(groans)

873
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,953
(whimpering)

874
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:38,498
(whimpering continues)

875
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:45,964
Where the fuck are you going?
We know where you live.

876
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:02,230
- Hey, Barry. Good morning.
- Hey, Lance. Can I talk to you for a second?

877
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:04,315
- Sure.
- Just come on in here.

878
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:07,986
Let's shut —

879
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:16,995
I got in trouble last night.
I got in a little bit of trouble.

880
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:19,664
- What happened?
- I made a phone call.

881
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:39,851
I better get more pudding.

882
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:44,147
MAN (on PA): <i>Barry, telephone on line one.
Barry, telephone, line one.</i>

883
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,990
- This is Barry.
<i>- Hey, it's me. It's Rhonda.</i>

884
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:48,860
<i>I need to talk to you
about smashing those windows last —</i>

885
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:52,155
Yeah. You know what?
I'm gonna go out of town for two days.

886
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:54,532
- Where you going, Barry?
- I have to go to Hawaii.

887
00:58:54,616 --> 00:58:56,618
- But you can't tell my sisters.
- Going to Hawaii?

888
00:58:56,701 --> 00:59:00,222
- Yeah. Make sure you don't tell my sisters.
- That's so wonderful, you're going to Hawaii.

889
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:01,748
- Okay.
- Okay.

890
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:04,292
And I have to get more pudding
for this trip to Hawaii.

891
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:07,712
As I just said that out loud,
I realize it sounded strange, but it's not.

892
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:11,341
- So would you like to come with me?
- Okay. Right now? Barry?

893
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:13,426
Yes.

894
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:18,598
First I saw the teriyaki chicken for $1.79,
then the soup, which made a real deal.

895
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:22,936
But to stumble across the pudding —
It's just tremendous how most people don't look.

896
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:25,188
They don't look at the fine print, Lance.

897
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,357
Oh, my.

898
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,942
Okay.

899
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,570
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
<i>You are on your way.</i>

900
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:36,199
<i>You are on your way. Don't stop now.</i>

901
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:39,077
<i>Don't be discouraged, and don't be sad.</i>

902
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,579
You can go to places in the world
with pudding.

903
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:43,623
- That is funny.
- Yeah.

904
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:45,333
That's funny.

905
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,674
Yes!

906
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,351
It's going to work.

907
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:06,062
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

908
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:08,314
Lena, I'm coming.

909
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:11,401
- I'm going to get on line.
- Oh, Lena. Aloha.

910
01:00:11,484 --> 01:00:13,736
- Barry, I'll be on line.
- Okay.

911
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,030
- I'm coming.
- Okay.

912
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:19,617
No, no, no, no. What do you mean?

913
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:22,263
- It doesn't state six to eight weeks anyway.
- MAN (on phone): <i>Sir.</i>

914
01:00:22,287 --> 01:00:25,832
<i>It takes that much time to process
the order and make sure it's valid.</i>

915
01:00:25,915 --> 01:00:28,459
I had this planned in my mind, okay?
I had to —

916
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:32,005
I could get the pudding over to you today.
I'm leaving today.

917
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:35,508
<i>Sir, I've explained this to you before.
It takes this much time to process.</i>

918
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:38,469
How am I supposed to know this
if you don't tell me this,

919
01:00:38,553 --> 01:00:41,639
if it's not in your rules and regulations,
in the fine print?

920
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:44,475
- That's an impossibility.
<i>- It takes that much time to process.</i>

921
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,979
I didn't see a "six" or an "eight" anywhere.
This is bullcrap to me.

922
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:51,149
Sir, I can't explain it to you.
It takes that much time to process.

923
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:54,610
- (screams) Fuck!
<i>- Hello?</i>

924
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:56,321

<i>- Hello?</i>

925
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:00,408

<i>♪ I knew at once

929
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:22,055
All right.

930
01:01:23,556 --> 01:01:27,602
The pudding's gonna take six to eight weeks
to process, so that's not gonna work today.

931
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:30,146
I'll take a bath on that today.

932
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:33,316
So here's what I'm gonna tell you.

933
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:36,235
Now, the pudding...

934
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:39,697
- Oh!
- You okay?

935
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:42,325
- The chair broke.
- We'll get to the pudding later.

936
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:44,577
- I'm gonna go now.
- Okay.

937
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,704
- I'll call you from there.
- Yeah.

938
01:01:46,788 --> 01:01:49,624
- You're running the place until I get back.
- No doubt.

939
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:53,169
- Don't tell my sisters anything, okay?
- Right.

Could you take me to where
the beaches and the hotels are?

961
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,972

964
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:38,816
- BARRY: <i>Hey, it's me.</i>
- Hey, what are you doing?

965
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,610
Nothing. I'm at work.

966
01:03:40,693 --> 01:03:42,862
I was wondering,
do you remember your friend Lena?

967
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:45,114
<i>- Yeah, what about her?</i>
- WOMAN: Thank you so much!

968
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:48,117
Well, I was wondering if you know
where she's staying in Hawaii.

969
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:50,495
'Cause she forgot her pocketbook
at my work.

970
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:53,581
I wanted to get it back to her,
make sure she wasn't nervous.

971
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:57,502
<i>Oh, my God. I know exactly where
she's staying, and you're fucking lying.</i>

972
01:03:57,585 --> 01:04:00,796
<i>She didn't forget her purse or pocketbook.
What do you want her number for?</i>

973
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,466
- Don't do this to me.
<i>- What do you want her number for?</i>

974
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:06,385
- All I want is her number. Can you help me?
<i>- Why? Tell me why.</i>

975
01:04:06,469 --> 01:04:09,305
- There's no reason for you to treat me this way.
<i>- Do you like her?</i>

976
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:11,766
You're killing me
with the way you are towards me.

977
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:13,684
<i>- Why?</i>
- All I want is her fucking number!

978
01:04:13,768 --> 01:04:16,538
That should be goddamn good enough
for you. Give me that fucking number!

979
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:19,315
You fucking hear me?
I'm sick of this fucking shit!

980
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:21,958
Stop fuckin' treating me this way
and give me the fuckin' number!

981
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:23,861
I'll fuckin' kill you! You want that?

982
01:04:23,945 --> 01:04:26,822
- (line ringing)
- MAN: <i>Aloha, Sheraton Waikiki.</i>

983
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:29,242
Hi, yes. Lena Leonard's room.

984
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:31,702

MAN: <i>Hello.</i>

987
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,377
<i>Hello?</i>

988
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:44,674
- Is Lena there?
<i>- You have the wrong room.</i>

989

01:04:46,968 --> 01:04:49,637

Hi, yes. I just called?

993
01:04:53,683 --> 01:04:55,851
I think I was connected to the wrong room.

994
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:59,689
I'm looking for a Lena Leonard,
and there shouldn't be a man in that room.

995

Yeah, I'm just down here
on my business trip.

1007
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,977
<i>Well, let's do something.
You want to do something?</i>

1008
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:41,731
Yeah! You don't have a boyfriend
or anything, do you?

1009
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:45,109
<i>- No. What do you mean?</i>
- I just wanted to know.

1010
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:47,320
When's the last time you had a boyfriend?

1011
01:05:47,403 --> 01:05:49,447
<i>About six months ago. Why?</i>

1012
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,282
I just wanted to make sure.

1013
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:53,451
<i>When's the last time you had a girlfriend?</i>

1014
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:55,995
- Were you ever married?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1015
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:59,582
Okay. How long were you married for?

1016

<i>Do you want to meet me
and talk about this stuff?</i>

1017
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:03,794

1046
01:10:04,285 --> 01:10:06,871
I'm sorry. I forgot to shave.

1047
01:10:07,997 --> 01:10:10,875
Your face is so adorable.

1048
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:13,794
Your skin and your cheek.

1049
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:16,380
I want to bite it.

1050
01:10:16,463 --> 01:10:20,801
I want to bite your cheek and chew on it,
it's so fucking cute.

1051
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,766
I'm looking at your face,
and I just want to smash it.

1052
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:31,770
I just want to fuckin' smash it
with a sledgehammer

1053
01:10:31,854 --> 01:10:34,648
and squeeze it, you're so pretty.

1054
01:10:34,732 --> 01:10:38,277
I want to chew your face
and I want to scoop out your eyes

1055
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,863
and I want to eat them.

1056
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:43,407
Chew them and suck on them.

1057
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:47,077
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1058
01:10:48,037 --> 01:10:51,206
- This is funny.
- Yeah.

1059
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:53,125
This is nice.

1060
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,557
At that restaurant,
I beat up the bathroom.

1061
01:11:08,641 --> 01:11:10,267
I'm sorry.

1062
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,198
- ELIZABETH: <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

1063
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:29,161
<i>Apparently, they need to see the new 4-84s
to make sure it works with their OC.</i>

1064
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:31,413
Okay, and what should I do about Eric?

1065
01:11:31,497 --> 01:11:33,499
<i>Just tell him to call me.</i>

1066
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:36,877
- Okay.
<i>- Okay, so did my brother call you?</i>

1067
01:11:37,586 --> 01:11:40,381
- No.
<i>- I have no idea what he's doing then.</i>

1068
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:43,008
<i>- I'm really sorry that didn't work out.</i>
- No, it's fine.

1069
01:11:43,092 --> 01:11:45,636
<i>I mean, you wouldn't want
to go out with him anyway.</i>

1070
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:50,099
<i>- Honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.</i>
- Yeah, he did seem a little strange.

1071
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:52,351
<i>Well, he's not</i> that <i>strange.</i>

1072
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:54,186
<i>Don't say that.</i>

1073
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:57,564
You're right. I'm sorry.

1074
01:11:57,648 --> 01:12:00,234
<i>I think he's weird, but that's me.</i>

1075
01:12:02,695 --> 01:12:06,824
Okay. So should I call you later?

1076
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:09,326
<i>That's okay.
I'll just see you when you get back here.</i>

1077
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:11,412
- Okay.
<i>- Okay, bye.</i>

1078
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:21,380
So where do you have to go?

1079
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:23,799
For what?

1080
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,384
For work.

1081
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:30,764
I don't have any business here.
I came here for you.

1082
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:48,198
(phone line ringing)

1083
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:56,415
GEORGIA: <i>Oh. Hello there, guy.</i>

1084
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:58,000
Hi, look. This is Bar —

1085
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:01,086
<i>You have almost reached me, but not quite.</i>

1086
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:04,006
<i>I'm in the other room,
shaving my roommate's pussy right now,</i>

1087
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:05,924
<i>so I'm a bit distracted.</i>

1088
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:10,054
<i>But if you leave me your name and home
phone number, area code first, please,</i>

1089
01:13:10,137 --> 01:13:12,890
<i>I'll be sure to call you back
as soon as I'm done.</i>

1090
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:15,350
<i>God, she's so sexy. Bye, honey.</i>

1091
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:17,478
- (beeps)
- Yes, this is Barry Egan.

1092
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:20,272
I am calling in regards
to what took place the other night.

1093
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:24,443
I just wanted to tell everybody
I know it was not fair what you did to me

1094
01:13:24,526 --> 01:13:26,445
and I am expecting my money back.

1095
01:13:26,528 --> 01:13:29,907
I realize you have my home phone number.
I'm away on vacation right now.

1096
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:32,993
If you guys want to reach me,
shortly I will be home

1097
01:13:33,077 --> 01:13:36,455
and we can discuss
how you can return my money.

1098
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:40,167
Otherwise, I'm pretty sure
that the police can be contacted

1099
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:44,129
and I could do that,
and I feel like i-it's warranted.

1100
01:13:44,213 --> 01:13:47,174
So, um, let's — let's figure something out.

1101
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:51,178
Uh, like I said, I'll be home shortly.
Give me a call.

1102
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:53,138
Okay, thank you.

1103
01:14:00,354 --> 01:14:03,190
(woman on PA, faint)

1104
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:13,700
How many airplanes have you been on?

1105
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:17,579
I think maybe over a hundred.

1106
01:14:18,831 --> 01:14:21,792
That's right. You travel a lot.

1107
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,377
Yeah.

1108
01:14:27,381 --> 01:14:30,551
How much do you travel?
Do you travel all the time?

1109
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:35,180
I forgot about that.

1110
01:14:38,225 --> 01:14:41,311
Can I come home with you
when we get there?

1111
01:14:41,395 --> 01:14:43,480
Of course.

1112
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:45,774
Is it okay to ask that?

1113
01:14:49,194 --> 01:14:51,697
I thought that you were anyways.

1114
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:04,877

1115
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:13,802

1116
01:15:31,612 --> 01:15:33,447
Come here.

Are you okay?

1118
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:58,931
- Yes, I'm fine. Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

1119
01:15:59,014 --> 01:16:01,225
- What is this?
- It's okay.

1120
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:02,809
It's okay.

1121
01:16:04,311 --> 01:16:06,730
Follow the penlight with your eyes, okay?

1122
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:11,526
People are just crazy in this world, I think.

- No, sweetheart, I don't remember you.
- Cut the crap, lady!

1134
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:16,591
You said your name was Georgia.

1135
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:20,095
You said our conversation was confidential,
and I trusted you!

1136

<i>And then you called me,
and you asked me for money!</i>

1137
01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:26,018
(shouting) Am I right? Am I right?

1138
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:28,395
<i>- Sir —</i>
- Get your supervisor on the phone!

1139
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:31,690
Or whoever owns that place.
I want him on the phone! Do you hear me?

1140
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:34,484
- Okay. Can you hang on a second, please?
<i>- No more bullcrap!</i>

He wants to talk to a supervisor.</i>

1146

<i>- Nothing.</i>

1147

<i>- No, this is bad. Something must've happened.</i>

connect you with my supervisor now.</i>

You're in trouble, honey.

- Hello, sir. My name's Barry Egan.

1152
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:12,814
- I called your service the other night.
<i>- Why don't you shut the fuck up?</i>

1153
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:15,317
- What's that?
- I said calm down and shut the fuck up.

1154
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,610
What's the problem?

1155
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,987
<i>The problem is,
if you give me a chance to explain,</i>

1156
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:22,741
one of your employees, that girl who I was
just speaking with, has been threatening me.

1157
01:18:22,824 --> 01:18:26,328
And four blond gentlemen just attacked me

1158
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:30,123
and smashed my car and hurt my girl.

1159
01:18:30,207 --> 01:18:31,333
Go fuck yourself.

1160
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:34,419
That shit has nothing to do with me.
I run a legitimate business here.

1161

Listen to me.

1162
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:39,132
(shouts) What's your name, sir?

1163
01:18:39,216 --> 01:18:41,635
- Answer me!
<i>- What's your name, asshole?</i>

1164
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:45,639
- I'm Barry Egan.
<i>- How do I know? You could be anybody.</i>

1165
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:49,559
You're a bad person. You have no right
taking people's confidence in your service.

1166
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:53,438
- You understand me, sir? You're sick.
- No, no. Shut up!

1167
01:18:53,522 --> 01:18:56,274
- Shut the fuck up!
<i>- You have no right to take people's trust.</i>

1168
01:18:56,358 --> 01:18:58,527
Shut up! Will you shut up! Shut up!

1169
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:01,446
Shut, shut, shut, shut, shut up!

1170
01:19:02,656 --> 01:19:04,825
Shut up!

1171
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:07,828

01:19:22,884 --> 01:19:24,511
Yes, I did.

Is he just around the corner? Can you —

1181
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:39,820
Yes, there's a police officer here.
He'll want to ask you some questions.

No, the guy who came in with me,
is he there?

1183
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:44,489
The guy who came in with you?
I'm not sure.

1184
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:46,908
We can ask the receptionist
to go get him for you.

1185
01:19:46,992 --> 01:19:48,792

Did they move her room?

1189
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:29,826
- What's her name, sir?
- Lena Leonard.

1250

and they hurt you, and I'm sorry.

1251
01:25:27,707 --> 01:25:31,127
And then I had to leave again
because I wanted to make sure

1252

you never got hurt again.

1253
