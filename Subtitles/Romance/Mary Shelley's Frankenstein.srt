00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,537
<i>I busied myself</i>
<i>to think of a story...</i>

1
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:37,908
<i>which would speak to the mysterious</i>
<i>fears of our nature...</i>

2
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,278
<i>and awaken thrilling horror--</i>

3
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:47,821
<i>one to make the reader</i>
<i>dread to look around--</i>

4
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:50,551
<i>to curdle the blood...</i>

5
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,389
<i>and quicken the beatings</i>
<i>of the heart.</i>

6
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:48,610
Tell the captain
we've got to take in...

7
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:50,674
the top sail!

8
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:53,050
She's going to rip!

9
00:01:57,892 --> 00:01:59,723
Please, Captain!

10
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:02,194
We have to drop the sails!

11
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:04,254
All hands to the mast!

12
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,562
Take the wheel! Come on!

13
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:13,972
We're dead!
We've hit the ice!

14
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:18,637
Iceberg ahead!

15
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:25,942
Hard to starboard!

16
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:55,009
Help!

17
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,444
Hold on men!

18
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:26,445
Put your backs into it, men!

19
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:30,244
- Let's go!
- Captain, this is useless.

20
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,981
- The ice stretches for miles.
- Do you suggest we lay down and die?

21
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:36,785
The men are exhausted.
They can't go on.

22
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:39,827
I have not come this tar
to give up now.

23
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,055
They knew the risk when they signed on.

24
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:46,225
And we're gonna chop our way
to the North Pole if we have to.

25
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,531
Then you run the risk
of mutiny, Captain.

26
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,533
- Did you say "mutiny"?
- Yes, I did, sir.

27
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:00,244
We proceed north as planned.

28
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:06,720
- At the cost of how many more lives?
- As many as it takes!

29
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:22,902
There's something out there.

30
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:32,946
What the hell is that?

31
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,935
Who is your captain?

32
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,639
I am.
Who the devil are you?

33
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:12,880
I have no time to talk. Bring your men
and weapons and follow me.

34
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:17,382
- Now!
- Stay where you are!

35
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,585
I give the orders here.

36
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:27,628
Stop the dogs! Get them!

37
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,135
Leave them.

38
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,668
They're already dead.

39
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,353
Get back to the ship now!

40
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,446
Everybody back to the ship!

41
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:55,059
Bears don't kill like that!
Nothing does!

42
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,687
Maybe it wants that man.

43
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:59,756
- Or it wants the captain.
- It's the devil come for the captain.

44
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:04,601
For the last time, I made my way from
St. Petersburg to Archangel on toot.

45
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:07,641
From there I took
a whaling ship north.

46
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,802
When we hit the ice,
I used the dogs.

47
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,143
What's out there?

48
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,153
Listen to me.
I have spent six years planning this.

49
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:28,820
My entire fortune.

50
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:32,354
I will not be stopped by you
or some phantom.

51
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,096
Do you share my madness?

52
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:39,768
No, not madness.

53
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,774
What, then?

54
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:48,138
There's a passage to the North Pole,
and I will find it.

55
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:51,309
At the cost of your own life?
The lives of your crew?

56
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:54,354
Lives come and go.

57
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:58,756
If we succeed, our names
will live on forever.

58
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:04,723
I will be hailed
as the benefactor of our species.

59
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,733
You're wrong.

60
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:11,099
I, of all men, know that.

61
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:13,003
Who are you?

62
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:16,768
My name...

63
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,017
is Victor Frankenstein.

64
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,965
Oh, my wonderful son, Victor.

65
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,237
You are the handsomest,
kindest, cleverest...

66
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,871
most wonderfulest boy
in the whole world.

67
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,441
Madam, you will spoil the boy.

68
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:11,124
Would you and your daughter
leave us, please, Mrs. Moritz?

69
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:15,432
Come along, Justine.

70
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:21,874
Victor, this is Elizabeth.
She's coming to live with us.

71
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:25,708
She's lost both her mother
and father...

72
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,305
to the scarlet fever, Victor.

73
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,316
She's an orphan now.

74
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,443
You must think of her
as your own sister.

75
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:39,454
You must look after her,
and be kind to her.

76
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:43,596
Always.

77
00:08:57,244 --> 00:09:00,805
Mother! How is the imminent arrival?

78
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:03,441
Oh, a little frisky today.

79
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:16,360
When you were a little boy, you
used to chase fireflies in the field.

80
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,194
Yes, and when I'd trap them
in my jar, they died.

81
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:21,700
- Do you remember how you cried?
- Yes.

82
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,294
Because you wanted to keep them glowing
by your bedside...

83
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:26,305
to light you as you read.

84
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:28,671
You were so hungry for knowledge.

85
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,676
Such a serious little boy.

86
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:36,240
You've become
such an earnest young man.

87
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:41,914
All these strange and ancient books.

88
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,217
You'll be an even greater doctor
than your father.

89
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:54,061
But you know, Victor,
life shouldn't be all study.

90
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,430
There's such fun to be had.

91
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:02,535
Give me that back, Mother.

92
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:14,053
Change partners and twirl!

93
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:18,023
Caroline, you mustn't
exert yourself. Please.

94
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:22,119
Don't worry, madam.
Your new baby will be a natural dancer.

95
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:23,925
Excellent.

96
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:29,001
You'll be the envy
of all the young ladies and gentlemen.

97
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,441
Please, Justine,
may I have this dance?

98
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,813
Madam.

99
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:47,445
Come on. That's it.
You must make a decision.

100
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,751
- The baby's in the wrong position.
- Cut me.

101
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:52,155
Oh, I cant.

102
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,293
Cut me. Save the baby.

103
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:07,963
She'll be all right.

104
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,011
Father's the finest doctor in Geneva.

105
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,253
Father?

106
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,628
Well, how is she?

107
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:32,131
I did everything I could.

108
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,235
Mother!

109
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
Bring her back.

110
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:04,722
Please bring her back.

111
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:46,801
Oh, Mother,
you should never have died.

112
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:49,570
No one need ever die.

113
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,708
I will stop this.

114
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,552
I promise.

115
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:04,751
Victor, you're completely obsessed.
Please explain what that is.

116
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,090
It's energy. It never disappears.
It merely changes form.

117
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:12,599
It's possible to convert this candle wax
into a mechanical dog's convulsions.

118
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:17,399
The applications of this
are limitless. Really.

119
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:20,998
Well, please come outside, Victor.
It's such a beautiful day.

120
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:23,600
Go away. I'm busy.

121
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,043
What's this?

122
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,618
It's for spraying down
the electric eels.

123
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:37,314
Now put it down.
It's not for playing with.

124
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:42,357
Don't do that.

125
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,363
Give me that.

126
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:57,540
Yes, come on! After all,
we should be grateful to Victor...

127
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,909
for abandoning his experiments
for one afternoon.

128
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,972
Well, who says I have?

129
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,019
- What do you mean?
- Look!

130
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:09,487
We're all going to die.
You knew this was going to happen.

131
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:13,583
Not for certain. But I had hoped
the conditions would be right.

132
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,756
But I've never seen one quite as large
as that. Look, it's wonderful!

133
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:20,891
- You shouldn't have done this.
- It's all right.

134
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:24,404
- We must take cover. A tree!
- That's exactly the wrong thing to do.

135
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:28,703
- It's a larger conductor than we are.
- What about Willie?

136
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:31,301
- What are we to do?
- Come on!

137
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:34,279
Spread out!
Elizabeth, take this.

138
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:37,283
- Come on! Quickly!
- What is that?

139
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:41,320
- Dig it right into the ground.
- Now what?

140
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,850
Everyone down. Quickly!

141
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,794
Give me your hands.
It'll be fine.

142
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:52,957
- That's good.
- I hope you know what you're doing.

143
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,524
Willie, don't look up!

144
00:14:56,403 --> 00:14:57,836
Wait.

145
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:00,806
One, two, three!

146
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,217
Now.

147
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:30,966
So how do you feel, Elizabeth?

148
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:34,906
Alive.

149
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:07,298
Ladies and gentlemen,
dear friends...

150
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:09,035
gather around and listen.

151
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:13,142
As you probably know,
tomorrow my dear son Victor...

152
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:16,046
leaves me to pursue
what I'm sure...

153
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:17,947
will be an illustrious career
in a profession...

154
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,885
that I myself am not altogether
unassociated with.

155
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,852
Though, my--

156
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:30,624
My one regret is that his mother--

157
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,667
my late wife--

158
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:36,794
is not here...

159
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:42,769
to share the fire...

160
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:47,338
which our son fills me with tonight.

161
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:53,085
Yes.

162
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:02,960
She wanted you to have this, Victor,
on your graduation.

163
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:08,265
And in it she has written...

164
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:13,668
"This is the journal
of Victor Frankenstein."

165
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:20,340
The rest of the leaves are blank...

166
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,284
to be filled with the deeds
of a noble life.

167
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:54,914
We'd better go in
before they miss us.

168
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:57,507
Just a little while longer,
please.

169
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,186
I don't know when
we'll be alone together again.

170
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:05,857
Oh, dear Victor.

171
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,856
I'll miss you laughing at me.

172
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:12,888
I'll miss you making me laugh.

173
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,938
So...

174
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,240
how do brothers and sisters
say good-bye?

175
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:35,120
Perhaps they never have to.

176
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,958
I won't if you won't.

177
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,636
Are you my sister?

178
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,445
Sister.

179
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,948
Friend.

180
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:05,717
Lover.

181
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,489
Wife?

182
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:11,990
Yes.

183
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,425
Then come with me to Ingolstadt.
Marry me now.

184
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:16,826
- No.
- Then I'll stay.

185
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:22,961
I want more than anything else
in the world to be your wife.

186
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,369
But as long as you're away,
I belong here.

187
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:30,800
I want to make this house live again.

188
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:34,142
I want to make this
a great home for our children.

189
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:40,085
And now you must go,
and do the great things you need to do.

190
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,746
I want you so much.

191
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:48,019
I'll be here when you return.

192
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,655
Each holiday.

193
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,131
Every visit.

194
00:19:57,003 --> 00:20:00,131
And on our wedding night.

195
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,384
Until our wedding night.

196
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:38,040
A lot of stairs, I'm afraid.
How was your journey?

197
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,841
Very good, thank you.
I made good progress in the mountains.

198
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:46,045
Good. I'm pleased. As I've said,
we've only got attic space.

199
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,815
That's exactly what I'm looking for.
But Frau Brach...

200
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:52,154
there will be a great deal
of scientific equipment and rigging...

201
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:54,386
to be delivered every day
for the next week.

202
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,156
I trust you've no objections.

203
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:59,494
I'm sure you appreciate the need
for a proper laboratory.

204
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,500
Oh, Putzi likes you.

205
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:12,011
This will be perfect.

206
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:20,346
<i>The foolish and vain</i>
<i>force their views by the rod...</i>

207
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,550
<i>but "knowledge is power</i>
<i>only through God. "</i>

208
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:27,787
Our motto. Easily forgotten...

209
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:30,125
by you young men in a hurry.

210
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:36,966
But perhaps the greatest mistake...

211
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:40,973
that all students make
during their time here...

212
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,772
is to suppose
that they can ever have...

213
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,110
an original or creative thought.

214
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,442
We have all imagined that in our time.

215
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,655
But gentlemen,
you have not come here...

216
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,561
in order to think for yourselves.

217
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:09,159
You are here to learn how to think
for your patients.

218
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:12,069
You must learn, therefore,
in the first place...

219
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:14,732
to submit yourselves...

220
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:19,802
to the established laws
of physical reality.

221
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,279
But surely, Professor...

222
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:26,315
you don't intend we disregard
more philosophical approaches?

223
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,819
Philosophical?

224
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,990
Those which stir the imagination
as well as the intellect.

225
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:33,457
Paracelsus, for example.

226
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,790
Ah, Paracelsus.

227
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:37,921
An arrogant and foolish Swiss.

228
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:39,693
Albertus Magnus.

229
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:42,462
His nonsense was exploded...

230
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,799
500 years ago.

231
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,702
Cornelius Agrippa.

232
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:49,867
A sorcerer, an occultist.
What is your name?

233
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:55,277
Victor Frankenstein, sir.
Of Geneva.

234
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,476
Oh, another Swiss.

235
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:01,111
Mr. Frankenstein...

236
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:03,985
here at the University of Ingolstadt
we teach...

237
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:07,584
and indeed hope to advance,
the science of medicine.

238
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:11,654
Chemistry, biology, physics.
We study hard science.

239
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:15,667
But surely, Professor, the greatest
advances come in combining these things.

240
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:19,432
We do not study the ravings
of lunatics and alchemists...

241
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,736
hundreds of years in their graves.

242
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:24,572
Because their kind...

243
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:27,613
of amateur, fanatical,
fantastical speculation...

244
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:30,707
does not heal bodies or save lives.

245
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,082
Only science can do that.

246
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:40,492
Now, have we your permission
to continue?

247
00:23:45,031 --> 00:23:47,727
- Nice coat.
- Thank you.

248
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,396
Don't take it too hard. Krempe just
doesn't approve of public humiliation.

249
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,531
- I am not mad.
- My dear fellow, of course you're not.

250
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,633
In fact, that's just the sort of thing
I'd expect a rational person...

251
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:00,009
to say to a complete stranger.

252
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,607
Henry Clerval, by the way,
and I'm completely crazy.

253
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:06,584
- Victor Frankenstein.
- Of Geneva.

254
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:10,421
Why don't you look where I'm going?

255
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,619
That's Schiller,
ornament of the playing field.

256
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:16,423
- Really?
- You can tell he's new.

257
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:20,091
He goes around looking at things
with his mouth open.

258
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:24,166
What are you here for?

259
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:26,467
- Research.
- Very grand.

260
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,666
I'm here to become
a mere doctor.

261
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:31,939
I'm told that has something to do
with healing the sick...

262
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,480
but I find sick people
rather revolting.

263
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:37,311
Still, I'll have a good time...

264
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:40,114
get my degree--
if I can stop failing anatomy--

265
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:43,781
and settle down to relieve rich ladies
of their imaginary aliments...

266
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,792
and then relieve their very real
and beautiful daughters.

267
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,624
Who was that?
He was at the lecture.

268
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,459
That's Waldman.

269
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,089
Yes. Interesting case.

270
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:57,159
They say in his youth he could break
into heaven and lecture God on science.

271
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:59,569
Ran into trouble with the authorities
a few years back.

272
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:01,903
Something to do
with illegal experiments.

273
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:05,308
What kind of experiments, I wonder?

274
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:09,337
What was it you were saying?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?

275
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:13,648
Yes, it's a life of sacrifice,
I know, but someone's got to do it.

276
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,129
That is why the central nervous system
and its crowning achievement...

277
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:35,936
the brain, are as complicated
and mysterious a set of organs...

278
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:38,000
as you are ever likely to encounter.

279
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,707
Mr. Frankenstein,
the incision is yours.

280
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,684
Excellent.

281
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:53,886
Mr. Clerval, you may remove
the cranial lid.

282
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:01,328
"Henry has now fully recovered and
continues his struggle to pass anatomy."

283
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:03,198
I was always terrible at anatomy.

284
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:05,328
"Professor Waldman is very tolerant
of him and myself.

285
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:08,533
I am learning a great deal.
Professor Waldman is remarkable."

286
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,839
- And so is Henry.
- "God bless you all. My Love, Victor."

287
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:13,970
- That's very nice.
- "P.S. I've fallen in love."

288
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:18,313
- I beg your pardon!
- "She's dark, sleek and beautiful...

289
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:21,148
and always wags her tail
whenever she sees me.

290
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:25,419
Her name is Putzi, and she's the
friendliest sheepdog I've ever known."

291
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:32,727
"P.S. Elizabeth, I dream of how your
hair shines in the moonlight."

292
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,791
<i>Of how your lips taste.</i>
<i>I dream of your arms and your breasts...</i>

293
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,200
<i>and of the time on our wedding night...</i>

294
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,569
<i>when we will be alone together</i>
<i>at last.</i>

295
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,369
What else does it say?

296
00:26:42,442 --> 00:26:45,775
It says, "I'm working very hard
and making lots of new friends."

297
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:47,779
Coffee, anyone?

298
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,810
Once and for all, Frankenstein.

299
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:55,980
Life is life. Death is death.

300
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,558
These things are real.

301
00:26:59,626 --> 00:27:01,423
That is rubbish,
and you know it.

302
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:05,123
That premise has been repeatedly
challenged by your own staff members.

303
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:07,758
We don't know where life ends
or death begins.

304
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,429
Hair and fingernails continue to grow
after what we choose to call death.

305
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:16,498
We know that a man's brain, heart and
lungs may continue to pump and breathe.

306
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:18,305
Now, you know that!

307
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:21,939
Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva, I warn you,
what you are suggesting...

308
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,610
is not only illegal,
it is immoral.

309
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,118
Rubbish!

310
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:32,785
"Dear Diary, Why does no one
understand me?

311
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,124
P.S. I am not mad."

312
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,563
You! Explain yourself!

313
00:27:39,632 --> 00:27:43,830
Professor, I'm sorry. Listen. I came
here to learn all about the new science.

314
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:47,236
Galvanism, Franklin's experiments.
The combination of modern disciplines...

315
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:50,140
with ancient knowledge
in an attempt to protect and create--

316
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,440
To create what?

317
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:55,976
So we can change things.
We can make things better.

318
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,143
You know that. We are on the verge
of undreamt-of discoveries...

319
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,346
if we've the courage
to ask the right questions.

320
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:04,322
Now, you must help me. Please!

321
00:28:06,426 --> 00:28:08,360
Come on.

322
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:37,449
Lock the door.

323
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:47,692
Now, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have based their medical science...

324
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:52,704
on the belief that the human body is
a chemical engine run by energy streams.

325
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,364
But how do they explain--

326
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,806
Don't touch that!

327
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:01,906
Their doctors treat patients
by inserting needles like these...

328
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:06,748
into the flesh at various key points
to manipulate these electric streams.

329
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,252
I see.

330
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:10,881
So electricity is the key.

331
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,448
Now look at this.

332
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,942
Go on. Touch it.

333
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:37,406
- It feels warm.
- Yes.

334
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,586
Yes. How do you do?

335
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:47,251
- Turn it oft!
- I can't. It's not working.

336
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:51,093
Try to stay calm. It's simply
a matter of reducing the polarity.

337
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,099
- A monkey's arm is like a human's.
- No arm is this strong!

338
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,533
Now, this must work.

339
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,701
Let me help you, Professor.

340
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:09,913
You shall, of course, tell no one.

341
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:14,476
They wouldn't believe you anyway.

342
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:25,096
"Dearest Victor,
Nothing much changes here.

343
00:30:25,164 --> 00:30:30,397
Mrs. Moritz continues to love
and torment Justine in equal measure.

344
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,734
Willie grows more precocious
every day...

345
00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:37,139
and Father almost expires with pride at
the very thought of you and your work.

346
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,738
And l-- Well, I just miss you.

347
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:43,873
Very much.

348
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,043
Please write soon, Victor."

349
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,315
<i>No, I'm serious.</i>
<i>You take vaccine, for instance.</i>

350
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,449
Thirty years ago, the entire concept
of vaccine was unheard of...

351
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:54,993
and now we save lives every day.

352
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,427
- But that isn't the whole answer.
- What do you mean?

353
00:30:57,497 --> 00:31:00,830
Eventually, the best way to cheat death
will be to create life.

354
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,095
Now you've gone too far.

355
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:05,034
There's only one God, Victor.

356
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:08,870
Leave God out of this. Listen.
Say someone you love has a sick heart.

357
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:11,102
- Would you give them a healthy one?
- Impossible.

358
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:12,701
We can do it.

359
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:16,715
If we can replace one part of a human
being, we can replace every part.

360
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:19,149
And if we can do that,
we can design a life.

361
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:22,278
We can create a being
that will not grow old or sicken.

362
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:24,789
One that will be stronger than us,
better than us.

363
00:31:24,857 --> 00:31:27,451
One that will be more intelligent,
more civilized than us.

364
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:29,927
- In our lifetime?
- No.

365
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:37,399
How close did you get, Professor?

366
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,030
Too close.

367
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:45,202
Professor, I beg you,
let me see these notes.

368
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,839
My work now and its application
lies exclusively...

369
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:51,383
in the preservation of life.

370
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,648
I abandoned my other researches
many years ago.

371
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,654
Why?

372
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,782
Because they resulted in abomination.

373
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:24,182
You're not sticking that in me.
It's got a pox in it, I hear.

374
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,014
- Pox? They're giving us pox?
- That's right.

375
00:32:27,086 --> 00:32:30,283
It's a vaccine that will prevent
a plague in this city.

376
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:33,086
Just tiny harmless amounts
of anti-smallpox serum.

377
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,219
- You just said pox!
- I said it was harmless.

378
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:39,856
It's a necessary precaution
without which this godforsaken city...

379
00:32:39,932 --> 00:32:42,025
would be immediately
put under quarantine.

380
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:45,935
I don't care what you doctors tell me.
You're not sticking that in me!

381
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,600
Yes, I am! It's the law!
Now, sit him down, someone.

382
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:52,940
- Come on.
- You're not sticking that in me!

383
00:32:56,215 --> 00:32:58,445
- Sir?
- Professor?

384
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:04,086
Get him!

385
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:06,090
Come on!

386
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,693
It's no use, Victor.
He's gone.

387
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:12,697
Let him go.

388
00:33:12,765 --> 00:33:14,699
This shouldn't happen.

389
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:21,729
It need not happen!

390
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,850
To hell with you!

391
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,384
Whatever you say,
whatever you call it...

392
00:33:35,454 --> 00:33:37,752
you doctors are killers!

393
00:33:38,824 --> 00:33:41,224
You murder people!

394
00:33:41,294 --> 00:33:43,319
Evil! You're evil!

395
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:47,959
You're the ones deserve to die!

396
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:50,969
God will punish you!

397
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:12,182
My God, you were so close.

398
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,694
Of course, the power!
The materials were wrong.

399
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:19,026
You needed auxiliary sources.

400
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,692
Yes, the experiment.

401
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,895
A failure? "Resulting reanimant...

402
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:29,204
malformed and hideous to behold.

403
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:33,268
This factor dependent
on the appropriate raw materials."

404
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:40,341
Raw materials.

405
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,739
- Come on, Henry.
- I can't help you.

406
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:04,332
- What are you frightened of?
- Everything.

407
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,344
- What if the authorities--
- We'll do this in secret.

408
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:10,348
I've got the raw materials.
I've got Waldman's journals.

409
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:13,544
- You stole Waldman's journals?
- We owe it to him to complete his work.

410
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,087
- He was one step away.
- He never wanted this.

411
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:20,148
- He couldn't face it.
- Even if it were possible...

412
00:35:20,226 --> 00:35:24,322
and even if you had the right, which
you don't, to make this decision...

413
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:27,525
can you imagine for one second there
wouldn't be a terrible price to pay?

414
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,467
I think for the chance
to defeat death and disease--

415
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:33,266
to let everyone on this earth
have the chance of life--

416
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,273
sustained, healthy life--

417
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:40,040
to allow people to love each other,
to be together forever--

418
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:44,412
for all of that,
I think it's a risk worth taking.

419
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:06,669
Please, Justine, just leave me alone.
I won't talk about it.

420
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,809
All these letters.
You read them to us every week.

421
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:14,778
I wrote the letters!
He hasn't written to me in months.

422
00:36:16,315 --> 00:36:19,978
Something horrific is happening to him.
I can feel it.

423
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,385
At first I wasn't sure, but I knew
I had to hide it from Father.

424
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:25,686
Now there are rumors of cholera.

425
00:36:25,758 --> 00:36:28,852
I can look after Father and Willie.
You go to Ingolstadt.

426
00:36:28,928 --> 00:36:32,329
That's not possible. He won't want me.
He's probably found someone else!

427
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,890
It he was mine,
I would have gone already!

428
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,369
But he isn't mine.
He's yours.

429
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:43,041
And you must go to him.

430
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:00,153
Raw materials,
that's all they are.

431
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:03,428
Tissue to be reused.

432
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:14,138
The very finest brain.

433
00:37:26,652 --> 00:37:29,177
- But they all died of cholera, sir.
- No matter.

434
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:31,052
Thank you.

435
00:37:38,397 --> 00:37:43,425
Now, the assembled organs must have
the appropriate nutrients and heat.

436
00:37:43,502 --> 00:37:48,439
And crucially, more direct power.

437
00:37:51,977 --> 00:37:53,945
More direct power.

438
00:38:16,435 --> 00:38:18,869
Amniotic fluid is the chief
biogenic element.

439
00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:20,997
The subject is injected with this.

440
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:24,440
The acupuncture needles pierce the flesh
at all key energy points.

441
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,469
After the removal of current,
a dead toad should retain animation...

442
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:32,711
but independently
of external power sources.

443
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:43,284
Yes!

444
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,024
That's it!

445
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:49,067
That's the combination!

446
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:50,726
That's it!

447
00:39:57,903 --> 00:39:59,234
Open the door!

448
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,974
- Victor, please!
- What do you want?

449
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:05,169
It's cholera.
It's an epidemic.

450
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:08,780
The city's been placed
under martial law.

451
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:11,543
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes. And?

452
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,051
The militia's arriving
to quarantine the city.

453
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,246
Most of us are getting out
while we still can.

454
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:20,088
Krempe knows you're here.
What if he tells the authorities?

455
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,786
Good-bye, Henry.

456
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:26,524
Victor, it's me! Elizabeth.

457
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:31,669
Can you hear me?

458
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,739
Victor, I have to see you.

459
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,037
- Go away!
- Please, Victor!

460
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,279
I won't leave here
until you see me!

461
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,085
Come in the side door.

462
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:58,295
Alone!

463
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:13,069
What's happened to you?

464
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:17,913
How can you live here like this?

465
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:20,645
And that stench!

466
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,778
Don't go in there!

467
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:31,520
- We have to leave. It isn't sate.
- No, I have to stay.

468
00:41:31,597 --> 00:41:35,397
- Even if it means you will die?
- Yes.

469
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:48,946
Well, let me help you.

470
00:41:49,848 --> 00:41:52,214
No, that's impossible.

471
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,246
We made a promise.

472
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:07,626
Victor, I beg you.

473
00:42:11,603 --> 00:42:15,767
Look, I know that this is difficult
for you to understand...

474
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:20,301
but I cannot abandon
this work now.

475
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,309
It is too important.
Not just for me, but...

476
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,477
believe me, for everyone.

477
00:42:30,823 --> 00:42:34,623
And it must come first.

478
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:41,660
Before us?

479
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:51,436
I love you so much.

480
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,943
But--

481
00:43:05,157 --> 00:43:07,250
Good-bye.

482
00:43:36,788 --> 00:43:38,881
Oh, God! Elizabeth!

483
00:45:40,812 --> 00:45:43,337
Live! Live!

484
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,912
Yes!

485
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:38,535
It's alive.

486
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:55,105
What have I done?

487
00:49:15,227 --> 00:49:18,355
Massive birth defects.

488
00:49:20,298 --> 00:49:24,200
Greatly enhanced physical strength.

489
00:49:25,704 --> 00:49:29,037
But resulting...

490
00:49:29,107 --> 00:49:31,405
reanimant...

491
00:49:31,476 --> 00:49:35,378
is malfunctional...

492
00:49:35,447 --> 00:49:37,608
and pitiful...

493
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:42,011
and dead.

494
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:50,989
Tomorrow, this journal
and its secrets must be destroyed.

495
00:49:53,064 --> 00:49:54,998
Forever.

496
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,638
Oh, God.

497
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:04,157
You tool, Victor Frankenstein
of Geneva!

498
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,998
How could you know
what you'd unleashed?

499
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,234
How is it pieced together?

500
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:14,870
With bits of thieves,
bits of murderers?

501
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:18,507
Evil stitched to evil
stitched to evil.

502
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:24,044
Do you really believe this thing
will thank you for its monstrous birth?

503
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:28,024
Evil will have its revenge.

504
00:51:28,093 --> 00:51:31,529
God help your loved ones!

505
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,932
What do you think you're doing?

506
00:52:51,443 --> 00:52:55,470
He's got cholera! He's the one
who's been spreading the plague!

507
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,139
Get him!

508
00:53:20,004 --> 00:53:22,996
- Get him!
- Kill him!

509
00:53:34,686 --> 00:53:36,620
Come here, you--

510
00:53:43,294 --> 00:53:45,922
Keep away from him!

511
00:53:45,997 --> 00:53:47,931
Kill him now!

512
00:54:04,149 --> 00:54:06,379
He went this way!

513
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,692
There now. Easy.

514
00:54:57,769 --> 00:55:00,033
Easy. Just a bit.

515
00:55:00,104 --> 00:55:02,595
That's it.

516
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,801
There now. Rest easy.

517
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:07,845
- Henry, you're here.
- Of course I'm here.

518
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:11,348
It was touch and go with you, though.
Just a bit more.

519
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:15,284
I teared cholera.
Turned out to be pneumonia.

520
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,550
Yes, I'm becoming
something of a doctor.

521
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:20,955
Even Krempe seems pleased with me.

522
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:24,392
At this rate,
I might even pass anatomy.

523
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:28,455
- The-- The epidemic.
- Dreadful.

524
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,001
There's nothing we can do for them.

525
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:35,028
The vulnerable,
anyone who's without shelter or food--

526
00:55:35,106 --> 00:55:37,301
the newborn especially will die.

527
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,933
Are you sure?

528
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,671
I'm certain of it.

529
00:55:42,146 --> 00:55:44,137
Thank God.

530
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,480
What do you mean?

531
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:56,490
Nothing.

532
00:56:00,064 --> 00:56:03,693
Well, then, that's my shift finished.

533
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:10,366
I'll see you later.

534
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:33,914
- Oh, please, forgive me.
- Of course I do.

535
00:57:39,297 --> 00:57:41,891
Victor, I don't know
what you were working on.

536
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:45,402
I don't want to know,
but it nearly killed you!

537
00:57:47,105 --> 00:57:50,336
It's over. It's finished.
It should never have started.

538
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,343
It's dead!

539
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:51,494
- Felix.
- Yes?

540
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:54,766
Don't forget the onion scraps.

541
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:58,639
- All right, I've got them.
- Make sure the shed door is shut.

542
00:58:58,709 --> 00:59:00,643
Go on! Get!

543
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:02,969
Come on.

544
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:09,108
Get out!

545
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:24,294
- How are the pigs?
- They're happy. They've been fed.

546
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:30,438
- How're your hands?
- They're bleeding again.

547
00:59:30,508 --> 00:59:32,442
Let me see them.

548
00:59:38,883 --> 00:59:40,748
That's better.

549
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:46,483
There.

550
00:59:48,259 --> 00:59:51,558
- Soup's ready.
- Come on, Grandpa. Sit down.

551
00:59:52,597 --> 00:59:54,292
Thank you.

552
01:00:53,658 --> 01:00:56,650
We'll never get through the winter
with this yield.

553
01:00:58,362 --> 01:01:00,330
The ground's frozen hard.

554
01:01:00,398 --> 01:01:03,162
- We'll sell another pig at market.
- We can't.

555
01:01:04,235 --> 01:01:06,829
Not until they lift the quarantine.

556
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:08,633
Even then, it's one less for us.

557
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,970
And he'll be back
for last month's rent soon.

558
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,839
Come on!

559
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,844
We'll do this together.

560
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,240
You're right.

561
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:23,981
We've got to.
Before the snow comes.

562
01:01:31,095 --> 01:01:32,687
Come on, then.

563
01:01:50,514 --> 01:01:52,914
The ground's frozen solid.

564
01:01:52,984 --> 01:01:56,010
We haven't the strength.
We'd need 20 men to work this field!

565
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,520
It's useless!

566
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:01,183
- We should stop. It's late.
- We don't have enough to eat!

567
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,193
We'll manage.

568
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,024
Let's go.

569
01:02:28,185 --> 01:02:29,914
Look!

570
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,996
They must be gifts from
the good spirit of the forest!

571
01:02:45,069 --> 01:02:48,402
Father, nothing in this life
comes tree of cost.

572
01:02:48,472 --> 01:02:50,406
I'd like to know who and why.

573
01:02:50,474 --> 01:02:52,772
Was it, Grandpa?

574
01:02:52,843 --> 01:02:55,607
- Was it the good spirit?
- I believe it was.

575
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,615
Will you stop tilling their head
with nonsense?

576
01:03:19,136 --> 01:03:21,161
Who's there?

577
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:25,267
Felix? Children?

578
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,447
Right.

579
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,921
What's this one?

580
01:03:42,993 --> 01:03:44,756
"Frie--

581
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:47,897
nd."

582
01:03:48,432 --> 01:03:49,524
Friend?

583
01:03:50,334 --> 01:03:52,495
Well done!

584
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:55,061
That's very good.

585
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:58,165
You've got lots of friends,
haven't you?

586
01:03:58,242 --> 01:04:00,369
Grandpa's your friend.

587
01:04:00,444 --> 01:04:04,005
- Thomas is your friend.
- Friend.

588
01:04:36,514 --> 01:04:37,947
Friend.

589
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:42,281
Family.

590
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,850
Father.

591
01:04:49,827 --> 01:04:52,694
This is important. You must
travel with him the entire journey.

592
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,731
This equipment must not be
left unattended.

593
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,495
My father will personally take delivery
in Geneva. Understand?

594
01:04:57,568 --> 01:04:58,694
- I do.
- Thank you.

595
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:02,261
- Going somewhere?
- Look at this locket Victor gave me.

596
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:06,139
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Lovely. Is this really you?

597
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:10,806
It's a bad likeness, but for now,
it'll serve instead of a ring.

598
01:05:10,881 --> 01:05:14,112
Congratulations!
This is entirely expected!

599
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:15,948
- When?
- As soon as we get home!

600
01:05:18,923 --> 01:05:20,857
I can't believe we'll be there
for New Year's eve.

601
01:05:20,925 --> 01:05:23,359
- Victor's taking his father's practice.
- And expand it.

602
01:05:23,427 --> 01:05:26,419
I'm going ahead, now that quarantine's
lifted. There's so much to do!

603
01:05:26,497 --> 01:05:29,523
The practice needs a partner.
There's not much money.

604
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,900
But there is food and board
and some very good company.

605
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:39,432
And it's the ideal position for someone
who has finally passed anatomy.

606
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:44,948
So we were wondering if there was
anybody you could recommend?

607
01:05:48,419 --> 01:05:52,253
- I don't know what to say.
- Please say yes.

608
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,030
And you can write that down
in your journal!

609
01:06:17,448 --> 01:06:21,077
"This is the...

610
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:25,447
journal of...

611
01:06:28,325 --> 01:06:31,294
Victor...

612
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,831
Frankenstein...

613
01:06:34,899 --> 01:06:39,336
of Geneva."

614
01:06:43,974 --> 01:06:45,669
Come on. Quickly!

615
01:06:45,743 --> 01:06:47,904
Oft you go! Quickly now!

616
01:06:50,814 --> 01:06:52,975
Merry Christmas!

617
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,177
Come on. Time for bed.

618
01:06:55,252 --> 01:06:57,516
In you go.

619
01:07:05,963 --> 01:07:09,956
"For the good spirit...

620
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:12,935
of the forest."

621
01:07:27,117 --> 01:07:30,416
Are you the good spirit
of the forest?

622
01:07:30,487 --> 01:07:33,888
Not exactly.
Where's your father?

623
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:37,519
I said, where's your father?

624
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:38,892
Who's there? Maggie?

625
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,965
Oh. It's you.
What have you done to Maggie?

626
01:07:44,034 --> 01:07:47,265
Is he in there,
hiding behind a blind old man?

627
01:07:47,338 --> 01:07:49,306
Get away!

628
01:07:51,508 --> 01:07:54,306
Don't blame me.

629
01:07:54,378 --> 01:07:57,905
Blame your son
for not paying his rent on time!

630
01:08:10,394 --> 01:08:12,589
Oh, my God!

631
01:08:13,597 --> 01:08:16,760
Thank you so much, my friend.

632
01:08:19,803 --> 01:08:21,828
Won't you come sit by the tire?

633
01:08:23,774 --> 01:08:26,709
Please. Don't be afraid.

634
01:08:28,412 --> 01:08:29,845
Come.

635
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,479
Come in.

636
01:08:40,391 --> 01:08:42,382
Have a rest. Sit down.

637
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:45,826
There. That's better.

638
01:08:45,896 --> 01:08:48,023
That's better.

639
01:08:49,433 --> 01:08:52,664
I'm glad you finally came in.

640
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:56,801
A man shouldn't have to hide
in the shadows.

641
01:09:03,947 --> 01:09:05,972
Better that way.

642
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:08,610
For me.

643
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,881
Why?

644
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,083
People are afraid.

645
01:09:16,727 --> 01:09:19,719
Except you.

646
01:09:21,098 --> 01:09:23,498
It can't be as bad as that.

647
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:30,468
Worse.

648
01:09:32,576 --> 01:09:35,807
I can see you with my hands.

649
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:38,810
It you'll trust me.

650
01:09:58,469 --> 01:10:00,596
Papa! He hurt Grandpa!

651
01:10:00,671 --> 01:10:03,367
- Who hurt Grandpa?
- What was that noise?

652
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,670
- Tell me what the noise was!
- What happened?

653
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,677
You poor man.

654
01:10:14,118 --> 01:10:16,245
Have you no friends?

655
01:10:19,923 --> 01:10:24,417
There are some people.

656
01:10:29,566 --> 01:10:33,297
But they don't know me.

657
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:36,203
Why do you not go to them?

658
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:43,711
Because...

659
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:47,114
I am so very...

660
01:10:52,689 --> 01:10:55,089
ugly.

661
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,752
And they are...

662
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:01,957
so very...

663
01:11:07,337 --> 01:11:09,737
beautiful.

664
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,672
Father!

665
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:14,768
Get out of here!
You animal!

666
01:11:14,845 --> 01:11:17,006
- You monster!
- Leave him alone!

667
01:11:19,349 --> 01:11:21,579
It's all right.

668
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,280
We have to leave here.

669
01:13:00,717 --> 01:13:03,811
I will have revenge!

670
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,691
Geneva.

671
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:02,235
Quickly!

672
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,940
She's here! We got your letter!

673
01:14:05,015 --> 01:14:07,245
- Did you?
- It was the first one I could read!

674
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:12,311
- Congratulations! I'm happy for you.
- Thank you, Justine.

675
01:14:12,389 --> 01:14:14,323
Is that the locket?

676
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,760
Look how handsome Victor is.

677
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:20,092
Elizabeth, can I take this
to show Peter?

678
01:14:20,163 --> 01:14:23,326
- It's not a toy!
- Let him go. Don't dawdle, William!

679
01:14:32,309 --> 01:14:35,403
Justine, you idiot!
Pay attention!

680
01:14:35,479 --> 01:14:37,447
Anyone would think
you're the one getting married.

681
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,448
- Yes, Mother.
- What's wrong?

682
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:41,575
Nothing, really.

683
01:14:41,651 --> 01:14:44,347
Just leave it!
You've ruined it now.

684
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:34,169
You! Quickly!

685
01:15:34,237 --> 01:15:36,102
- Have you seen Willie?
- Isn't he back yet?

686
01:15:36,173 --> 01:15:40,041
Claude went to see if he lost track
of time. They say he never arrived.

687
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:42,601
It's far too late
for him to still be out.

688
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,708
This isn't a game!

689
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,385
It's so late!

690
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:28,385
We're all so tired.

691
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:30,653
I'm so tired.

692
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:36,722
Father! I am so pleased to see you!

693
01:16:42,706 --> 01:16:44,469
What's wrong?

694
01:17:16,139 --> 01:17:18,403
We checked the east ridge.
There's nothing there.

695
01:17:18,475 --> 01:17:20,102
Damn!

696
01:17:25,715 --> 01:17:27,945
We found him!

697
01:17:29,586 --> 01:17:32,555
I found him.

698
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:16,699
We did everything we could, sir.

699
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:20,726
You just rest easy now.

700
01:18:20,804 --> 01:18:22,897
We did everything we could.

701
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,506
Sir, I'm terrified for my girl.

702
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,544
She's still out looking for William.

703
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:32,510
We parted badly.
I was cruel to her.

704
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:34,379
I didn't mean it!

705
01:18:34,451 --> 01:18:38,353
I think she finds it very hard now
with your wedding.

706
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,224
She loves you dearly.

707
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:44,988
I couldn't bear it if anything happened
to her. She's all I've got.

708
01:18:45,061 --> 01:18:46,858
Please help me!

709
01:18:48,365 --> 01:18:50,765
We'll organize another search
now that it's light.

710
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:53,960
We'll find her, Mrs. Moritz.
I promise.

711
01:18:58,008 --> 01:19:00,943
- How is Father?
- His heart is breaking.

712
01:19:11,187 --> 01:19:15,556
Mr. Frankenstein, we've apprehended the
murderer, not five miles from here...

713
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,559
hiding in a barn.

714
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:20,990
We found this on her.

715
01:19:21,064 --> 01:19:23,089
'Tis yours, I believe, sir.

716
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:29,035
Sir, you must come immediately.

717
01:19:30,507 --> 01:19:32,441
The townspeople have gone mad.

718
01:19:34,744 --> 01:19:37,975
- What are they doing?
- They must have broken into the jail!

719
01:19:38,048 --> 01:19:41,779
- For God's sake! Can't you stop them?
- They've gone wild! It's a lynch mob!

720
01:19:41,851 --> 01:19:45,014
Stop! This is unlawful!

721
01:19:55,065 --> 01:19:57,863
Victor! Help me!

722
01:19:57,934 --> 01:19:59,799
I was trying to find him!

723
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:02,099
I went to the lake!

724
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:06,108
But it was dark!
I wanted to bring him to you!

725
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:08,838
He must be there for the wedding!

726
01:20:08,912 --> 01:20:12,473
I'm sorry! He's so tiny!

727
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:51,183
We managed to close the gates
on the mob, Claude.

728
01:20:51,254 --> 01:20:53,688
What about Justine?

729
01:20:53,757 --> 01:20:56,055
We cut her down, sir.
We can bury her in the morning.

730
01:20:56,126 --> 01:20:58,617
Thank you, Claude. Get to bed.

731
01:21:05,268 --> 01:21:07,896
The sea of ice.

732
01:21:09,005 --> 01:21:11,439
I will meet you there.

733
01:21:11,508 --> 01:21:14,272
On the sea of ice.

734
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:36,095
Oh, Justine, forgive me.

735
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:38,464
Victor, tell me.

736
01:21:38,535 --> 01:21:41,834
Who is this man?
How do you know he's responsible?

737
01:21:41,905 --> 01:21:45,807
-I'll tell you after I've destroyed him.
-This is a matter for the police!

738
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:48,207
They wouldn't understand.

739
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:49,939
Well, neither do I!

740
01:21:51,414 --> 01:21:53,348
Then just accept it.

741
01:23:41,791 --> 01:23:43,725
Get up.

742
01:23:44,994 --> 01:23:47,462
You do speak.

743
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:50,226
Yes, I speak.

744
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,291
And read.

745
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:55,804
And think.

746
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,606
And know the ways of man.

747
01:24:00,643 --> 01:24:02,235
How did you find me?

748
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:08,444
Your journal.

749
01:24:12,455 --> 01:24:14,218
Then you mean to kill me.

750
01:24:20,196 --> 01:24:23,359
You murdered my brother, didn't you?

751
01:24:25,702 --> 01:24:30,036
I took him by the throat
with one hand...

752
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:34,338
and lifted him off the ground.

753
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:38,608
Slowly crushed his neck.

754
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:43,516
And as I killed him...

755
01:24:43,586 --> 01:24:45,713
I saw your face.

756
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:52,555
You gave me these emotions...

757
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,995
but you didn't tell me
how to use them.

758
01:24:57,333 --> 01:24:59,392
Now, two people are dead...

759
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:03,071
because of us.

760
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:06,904
Why?

761
01:25:08,911 --> 01:25:11,311
There was something at work
in my soul...

762
01:25:11,381 --> 01:25:13,645
which I do not understand.

763
01:25:16,619 --> 01:25:19,486
What of my soul? Do I have one?

764
01:25:20,723 --> 01:25:23,817
Or was that a part you left out?

765
01:25:26,262 --> 01:25:30,631
Who were these people
of which I am comprised?

766
01:25:32,368 --> 01:25:35,201
Good people?
Bad people?

767
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:39,638
- Materials, nothing more.
- You're wrong.

768
01:25:42,879 --> 01:25:45,575
Did you know
I knew how to play this?

769
01:25:47,617 --> 01:25:51,075
In which part of me
did this knowledge reside?

770
01:25:51,754 --> 01:25:54,120
In these hands?

771
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:57,057
In this mind?
In this heart?

772
01:25:58,061 --> 01:26:00,928
And reading.

773
01:26:00,997 --> 01:26:03,192
And speaking.

774
01:26:04,767 --> 01:26:08,294
Not things learned
so much as things...

775
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:10,805
remembered.

776
01:26:11,974 --> 01:26:14,909
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.

777
01:26:17,013 --> 01:26:21,575
Did you ever consider
the consequences of your actions?

778
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,484
You gave me life.

779
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:30,322
But then you left me to die.

780
01:26:36,499 --> 01:26:38,194
Who am I?

781
01:26:38,267 --> 01:26:39,700
You--

782
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,505
I don't know.

783
01:26:51,214 --> 01:26:54,445
And you think I am evil?

784
01:26:56,919 --> 01:26:58,784
What can I do?

785
01:26:59,822 --> 01:27:04,225
There is something I want.
A friend.

786
01:27:05,928 --> 01:27:08,294
Companion.

787
01:27:08,364 --> 01:27:11,458
A female.

788
01:27:12,301 --> 01:27:14,667
Someone like me...

789
01:27:15,738 --> 01:27:17,603
so she won't hate me.

790
01:27:17,673 --> 01:27:19,573
Like you?

791
01:27:22,245 --> 01:27:24,543
Oh, God.
You don't know what you're asking.

792
01:27:25,481 --> 01:27:28,780
I do know that...

793
01:27:29,852 --> 01:27:33,015
with the sympathy of one living being...

794
01:27:34,323 --> 01:27:37,850
I would make peace with all.

795
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:44,293
I have love in me,
the likes of which...

796
01:27:44,367 --> 01:27:48,064
you can scarcely imagine...

797
01:27:49,739 --> 01:27:51,798
and rage...

798
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:55,037
the likes of which
you would not believe.

799
01:27:58,414 --> 01:28:02,180
It I cannot satisfy the one...

800
01:28:04,353 --> 01:28:08,813
I will indulge the other.

801
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:13,819
And...

802
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:16,397
if I consent...

803
01:28:17,433 --> 01:28:19,094
how will you live?

804
01:28:21,971 --> 01:28:25,566
We would travel north,
my bride and I...

805
01:28:25,641 --> 01:28:28,508
to the furthest reaches of the pole...

806
01:28:29,879 --> 01:28:33,007
where no man has ever set foot.

807
01:28:34,150 --> 01:28:36,277
There...

808
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,217
we would live out our lives.

809
01:28:40,122 --> 01:28:41,555
Together.

810
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:46,724
No human eye
would ever see us again.

811
01:28:48,664 --> 01:28:51,599
This I vow.

812
01:28:53,469 --> 01:28:56,131
You must help me.

813
01:28:56,806 --> 01:28:58,364
Please.

814
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:05,578
If it is possible
to right this wrong...

815
01:29:08,651 --> 01:29:10,585
then I will do it.

816
01:29:15,024 --> 01:29:16,958
Are you all right?

817
01:29:18,995 --> 01:29:21,225
Yes, I'm all right.
I'm safe.

818
01:29:21,297 --> 01:29:23,492
What happened?

819
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:25,500
Tell us.

820
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:34,271
Victor, you have to tell us
what happened!

821
01:29:34,343 --> 01:29:36,470
One month! That's all I ask!

822
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:39,742
Then we can be married
and forget this whole business!

823
01:29:39,815 --> 01:29:42,045
- I promise!
- Promise?

824
01:29:42,118 --> 01:29:46,555
Don't dare use that word to me!
You promised to tell me who this man is.

825
01:29:46,622 --> 01:29:48,920
You promised to abandon
this work for good!

826
01:29:48,991 --> 01:29:51,687
Your promises don't mean anything.
I have to leave this house.

827
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:54,821
- Where will you go?
- Somewhere I can recover.

828
01:29:54,897 --> 01:29:57,058
This is ridiculous!
I haven't got time to argue!

829
01:29:57,133 --> 01:30:01,069
Isn't it convenient?
Doesn't it fit in with your plans?

830
01:30:01,137 --> 01:30:05,506
Don't you ever think of anyone
or anything but yourself?

831
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:18,219
God forgive me.

832
01:31:42,805 --> 01:31:44,500
Why her?

833
01:31:45,908 --> 01:31:49,366
Materials, remember?
Nothing more.

834
01:31:49,445 --> 01:31:50,878
Your words.

835
01:31:53,949 --> 01:31:56,042
You will honor your promise to me.

836
01:31:56,118 --> 01:31:58,643
I will not.

837
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:00,348
Go on. Kill me now.

838
01:32:00,423 --> 01:32:02,789
That is mild compared to what will come.

839
01:32:02,858 --> 01:32:07,192
If you deny me my wedding night,
I will be with you on yours.

840
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:16,500
Wait! Please wait!

841
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:19,568
I have to speak to you.

842
01:32:19,642 --> 01:32:21,303
Please!

843
01:32:31,053 --> 01:32:32,884
What do you want to say?

844
01:32:34,857 --> 01:32:36,791
Don't go.

845
01:32:39,128 --> 01:32:40,561
Please.

846
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:43,564
Don't go.

847
01:32:49,738 --> 01:32:52,036
I'm frightened.

848
01:32:55,277 --> 01:32:56,904
Of what?

849
01:33:01,584 --> 01:33:03,518
I have done something...

850
01:33:04,887 --> 01:33:06,821
so terrible...

851
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:11,316
so evil.

852
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:17,063
And I am frightened...

853
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:19,363
that if I tell you the truth...

854
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:23,567
that I will lose you.

855
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:29,310
You'll lose me if you don't.

856
01:33:32,882 --> 01:33:34,315
I...

857
01:33:35,684 --> 01:33:38,118
don't know...

858
01:33:41,757 --> 01:33:43,190
what...

859
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,757
to do.

860
01:34:23,299 --> 01:34:25,233
Will you marry me?

861
01:34:29,638 --> 01:34:31,606
Marry me today.

862
01:34:33,509 --> 01:34:35,409
Tomorrow...

863
01:34:35,477 --> 01:34:37,411
tell me everything.

864
01:34:39,815 --> 01:34:42,147
But you must tell me the truth.

865
01:34:45,187 --> 01:34:48,623
And together we can face anything.

866
01:34:50,593 --> 01:34:52,527
Whatever you've done...

867
01:34:53,963 --> 01:34:55,897
whatever has happened...

868
01:34:58,167 --> 01:35:00,101
I love you.

869
01:35:10,546 --> 01:35:12,605
To share the truth...

870
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:14,114
the whole truth...

871
01:35:14,183 --> 01:35:16,117
for good or ill.

872
01:35:17,186 --> 01:35:19,177
To stand by each other...

873
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:22,190
in sickness and in health...

874
01:35:23,826 --> 01:35:26,226
and in joy...

875
01:35:26,295 --> 01:35:29,662
from this day forward...

876
01:35:29,732 --> 01:35:32,758
till death do you part.

877
01:35:50,452 --> 01:35:52,943
Who is this man?
How shall we know him?

878
01:35:53,022 --> 01:35:55,718
- Believe me, you'll know him.
- He killed Master William.

879
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:57,952
And Justine Moritz died for it.

880
01:35:58,027 --> 01:36:01,053
No hesitation, lads!
Shoot the bastard on sight!

881
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,860
- Henry.
- Don't worry about a thing.

882
01:36:03,932 --> 01:36:07,766
You two look after each other.
I'll look after your father.

883
01:36:49,745 --> 01:36:51,474
"Ferry"

884
01:36:51,547 --> 01:36:54,380
I'm sorry, sir.
The last ferry's gone.

885
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:56,509
- There's nothing there till morning.
- Damn.

886
01:36:56,585 --> 01:36:58,712
I'll ride on ahead
and secure you lodgings for the night.

887
01:36:58,787 --> 01:37:00,379
- Thank you.
- Come on.

888
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,892
- Keep your pistols dry!
- They're dry enough.

889
01:37:06,962 --> 01:37:11,262
It they fail, we've others. If those
fail, we can always cut the bastard.

890
01:37:11,333 --> 01:37:13,267
- Go to your post.
- Yes, sir.

891
01:37:16,338 --> 01:37:19,330
Don't worry, sir.
You're well guarded.

892
01:37:20,909 --> 01:37:23,605
Now, why don't you go on upstairs
to your wife.

893
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,807
It's not often a man
has his wedding night.

894
01:37:51,874 --> 01:37:53,808
You're soaking.

895
01:38:03,152 --> 01:38:06,019
Brother and sister no more.

896
01:38:07,122 --> 01:38:09,056
Now, husband and wife.

897
01:39:39,848 --> 01:39:41,782
Lock the door.

898
01:39:45,387 --> 01:39:47,787
I saw him in the lightning.
He vanished toward the lake!

899
01:39:47,856 --> 01:39:49,346
You two stay here!

900
01:40:01,103 --> 01:40:03,628
We lost him.

901
01:40:05,974 --> 01:40:08,670
Don't bother to scream.

902
01:40:27,563 --> 01:40:29,497
Please, sir.

903
01:40:30,999 --> 01:40:32,489
Please don't hurt me.

904
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:36,936
You're lovelier than I ever...

905
01:40:37,005 --> 01:40:39,530
could have imagined.

906
01:40:53,488 --> 01:40:54,887
I keep my promises!

907
01:41:25,187 --> 01:41:27,121
For God's sake.
Tell me what happened!

908
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:30,522
No point.
I know what I have to do.

909
01:41:30,592 --> 01:41:33,152
God! No! You can't do this!
I won't let you!

910
01:41:33,228 --> 01:41:35,628
She's gone. I love her.
What would you do?

911
01:41:35,697 --> 01:41:37,892
- Leave her in peace!
- You call this peace?

912
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,558
Father would have
done this for mother.

913
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:41,500
Your father's dead!

914
01:41:43,238 --> 01:41:45,172
Then there's nothing left to lose.

915
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,435
Nothing but your soul.

916
01:43:57,839 --> 01:44:00,330
Live!

917
01:44:34,442 --> 01:44:36,034
Live!

918
01:45:09,778 --> 01:45:12,178
Say my name.

919
01:45:13,915 --> 01:45:15,348
Please.

920
01:45:16,418 --> 01:45:18,215
Say my name.

921
01:45:20,288 --> 01:45:22,779
Remember?

922
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:24,792
You must remember.

923
01:45:38,073 --> 01:45:39,665
That's it.

924
01:45:41,943 --> 01:45:44,434
That's it. You remember.

925
01:45:48,483 --> 01:45:50,417
That's it.

926
01:45:55,624 --> 01:45:57,353
Now stand.

927
01:46:10,272 --> 01:46:12,001
Up. Yes!

928
01:46:37,699 --> 01:46:39,530
Remember?

929
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:32,749
She's beautiful.

930
01:47:36,624 --> 01:47:40,116
- She's not for you.
- Come.

931
01:47:46,301 --> 01:47:48,235
Say my name.

932
01:48:06,721 --> 01:48:08,621
You're beautiful.

933
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:15,489
Say my name.

934
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:20,501
Come to me.

935
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:31,730
Say my name.

936
01:49:36,044 --> 01:49:38,035
That's right.

937
01:49:41,883 --> 01:49:43,214
You're mine.

938
01:49:47,989 --> 01:49:50,787
Leave her alone! No!

939
01:49:50,859 --> 01:49:54,556
- Get away from her! She's mine!
- She said my name! She remembers!

940
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:56,221
She's mine!

941
01:50:50,285 --> 01:50:52,219
<i>All that I once loved...</i>

942
01:50:52,287 --> 01:50:55,085
<i>lies in a shallow grave...</i>

943
01:50:55,156 --> 01:50:57,090
<i>by my hand.</i>

944
01:51:01,229 --> 01:51:04,289
I followed the trail
he left for me.

945
01:51:05,366 --> 01:51:06,799
North.

946
01:51:07,769 --> 01:51:10,670
Always north.

947
01:51:10,738 --> 01:51:12,672
For months now.

948
01:51:14,075 --> 01:51:16,009
With one intent.

949
01:51:18,146 --> 01:51:20,080
To kill him.

950
01:51:23,318 --> 01:51:24,910
Now...

951
01:51:29,724 --> 01:51:31,316
I'm tired.

952
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:37,457
I'm so...

953
01:51:38,833 --> 01:51:41,825
very, very tired.

954
01:51:58,152 --> 01:52:00,177
What did he say?

955
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:03,924
He's dead.

956
01:52:05,893 --> 01:52:08,123
He died raving...

957
01:52:08,196 --> 01:52:11,290
about some phantom.

958
01:52:11,366 --> 01:52:13,766
What is it out there, Captain?

959
01:52:18,072 --> 01:52:21,098
He told me a story that...

960
01:52:24,612 --> 01:52:26,546
couldn't be true.

961
01:52:28,283 --> 01:52:30,217
He was mad.

962
01:52:31,886 --> 01:52:33,820
I think.

963
01:52:36,457 --> 01:52:38,391
A warming breeze.

964
01:52:41,829 --> 01:52:44,059
The ice will melt yet.

965
01:52:44,832 --> 01:52:47,062
And what then, Captain?

966
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:55,805
- We head north.
- No.

967
01:53:19,934 --> 01:53:22,129
Who are you?

968
01:53:25,707 --> 01:53:28,540
He never gave me a name.

969
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:57,961
Why do you weep?

970
01:54:00,408 --> 01:54:03,002
He was my father.

971
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:09,546
"And, yea, I gave my heart
to know wisdom...

972
01:54:09,617 --> 01:54:12,313
and to know madness and folly.

973
01:54:12,387 --> 01:54:16,653
And I perceived that all is vanity...

974
01:54:16,724 --> 01:54:19,022
and vexation of spirit.

975
01:54:19,093 --> 01:54:23,325
For in much wisdom
is much grief.

976
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:25,764
And he that increaseth knowledge...

977
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:28,529
increaseth sorrow.

978
01:54:28,603 --> 01:54:31,697
For God shall bring every work...

979
01:54:31,773 --> 01:54:34,606
and every secret thing
into judgement...

980
01:54:36,043 --> 01:54:38,603
whether it be good...

981
01:54:38,679 --> 01:54:40,579
or whether it be evil."

982
01:54:48,956 --> 01:54:52,858
- Captain, we--
- He has a right to bear witness.

983
01:55:04,105 --> 01:55:07,438
- Jesus! It's breaking up!
- The ice is giving way!

984
01:55:10,478 --> 01:55:12,139
Help me!

985
01:55:16,784 --> 01:55:18,979
Get back to the ship, Captain!

986
01:55:19,787 --> 01:55:22,483
Leave the damn torch!

987
01:55:25,393 --> 01:55:26,724
Come with us!

988
01:55:28,763 --> 01:55:31,391
I am done with man.

989
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:44,978
Hang on! I've got you!

990
01:55:45,046 --> 01:55:46,479
Help!

991
01:55:51,686 --> 01:55:54,587
Here, Captain!
Take my hand!

992
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:08,024
Where to now, Captain?

993
01:57:20,541 --> 01:57:21,974
Home.
