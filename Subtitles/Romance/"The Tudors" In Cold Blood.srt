2
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:22,079
Ducal Palace
Urbino, Italy

3
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:41,044
Signore Ambassador.

4
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,086
It's really most
humiliating Signore Bedoli.

5
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:45,461
My lord, Prego, excellency, Prego.

6
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:47,465
What could possibly be so important
that you dragged me

7
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,485
from my bed before 7 o'clock
in the morning?

8
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:53,371
The duke has called an early meeting
of the council he wanted you to attend.

9
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:54,384
Tôt le matin.

10
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:57,010
Monsieur.

11
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,014
Why are the French here?

12
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:02,355
That is what his grace
wants to talk to you about.

13
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,025
Excellence.

14
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:38,062
French bastards!

15
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:17,270
Whiteball Palace
London

16
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,082
Mr. Pace.

17
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:24,012
Mr. More.

18
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:27,082
His Majesty wants council
this afternoon to be brief.

19
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:30,082
- He doesn't want a lot of speeches.
- Where is the king?

20
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:33,060
He's in seclusion and
not to be disturbed.

21
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,072
How is he?

22
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:36,071
With regards to...?

23
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:38,001
With regard to Italy!

24
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:40,010
What the French are doing in Italy.

25
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:41,070
What other regard is there?

26
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:43,071
His Majesty is counselling patience.

27
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:45,052
Yes, but you're his secretary.

28
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:46,063
You see him everyday.

29
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:50,062
In private he's mad with grief.
Almost inconsolable.

30
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:54,340
I think you ought to remember
it was his uncle they murdered.

31
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:57,050
The King!

32
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,033
My Lords.

33
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:12,480
We meet to consider
questions of great moment.

34
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:17,040
The King of France has demonstrated
to the world his aggressive policies.

35
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:21,021
He has already overrun 5
or 6 city states in Italy.

36
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:25,330
He's a threat to every Christian
nation in Europe,

37
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:28,013
yet he bullies the Pope into
declaring him defender of the faith.

38
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:32,480
On top of that, to prove that
nobody can touch him

39
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:35,982
he has our ambassador
in Urbino...

40
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:39,000
and my uncle...

41
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:41,021
murdered.

42
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:43,060
In cold blood.

43
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:48,020
My Lords...

44
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:55,030
I believe these are
all just causes for war!

45
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:59,031
Your Majesty is certainly right.

46
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:01,043
You have every reason
to prosecute a war.

47
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:04,012
Indeed, I warned you a year
ago about French ambitions,

48
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:08,301
though has taken this personal tragedy
for Your Majesty to accept my word.

49
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:16,061
Norfolk.

50
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:20,442
I agree with my Lord Buckingham.

51
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:24,462
The King of England has
an ancient and historic right

52
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:27,062
to the French throne, which
the Valois have usurped.

53
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,070
It is high time we kick them out.

54
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:32,661
We should attack France
with all our might.

55
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:34,030
Yes.

56
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:40,021
What say you, Wolsey?

57
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:46,381
I concur with Your Majesty.

58
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:50,060
These are indeed, just causes.

59
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:52,001
Good!

60
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,071
Then it is settled.

61
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,033
We are to war with France.

62
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:59,021
Yes!

63
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,023
Your Eminence will make
all the arrangements.

64
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:04,060
Now!

65
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,092
I can go play.

66
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,441
Do you really think
we should go to war?

67
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,350
I think we should try to do
what the king wants us to do.

68
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:23,670
What if the king doesn't know
what's in his best interests?

69
00:05:23,677 --> 00:05:27,322
Then, you should help him decide.

70
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:33,002
How is your husband?

71
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:35,053
My husband?

72
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:38,022
He's extremely jealous.

73
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:42,052
He's threatening to make a scandal.

74
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:45,052
Says he'll put me in a nunnery.

75
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,050
Oh!

76
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:52,023
That would be such a waste.

77
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:06,461
Hampton Court
Surrey

78
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:12,881
His Excellency the French
Ambassador and Bishop Bonnivet.

79
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,431
Gentlemen, welcome.

80
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:20,061
Your Excellency...

81
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:26,691
what happened in Urbino, the
butchering of our ambassador was

82
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,300
most unfortunate. Especially for me.

83
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:33,472
Your Excellency is well aware of
my sentiments towards your country.

84
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,401
I have laboured long ad
consistently in French interests.

85
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,661
But how to explain this?

86
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,400
The matter of my king's uncle.

87
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:45,450
Frankly, it was not done
on my master's orders.

88
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:49,003
And those that committed
the crime have been punished.

89
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:53,471
Now, now, you must understand,
we are well beyond that.

90
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,001
King henry is a young man.

91
00:07:56,007 --> 00:08:00,051
He has an appetite for war
and on this occasion

92
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,451
he will not be easy to appease.

93
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:07,001
Then, by all means
let us have war.

94
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:11,031
With the greatest respect,
you don't mean that.

95
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:15,093
Well, I believe that everything
humanly possible

96
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:19,000
should be done to avoid
a war between our 2 countries.

97
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:23,422
It would do England no good
to get involved in our

98
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,020
European squabbles.

99
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,411
Far better she stands above them.

100
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:34,073
I'm sure Your Eminence has ways
of pacifying the young lion.

101
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,071
Play on!

102
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:53,002
15-love.

103
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,991
- 30-love.
- Yeah!

104
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,431
Good shot.

105
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:11,043
Our game, I think, Anthony.

106
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,363
Your Majesty knows
we're just lettin' you win.

107
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,080
Actually, I was playing as hard as I can.

108
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:20,541
Now there is someone I have to try.

109
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:24,423
See, middle gallery, blue dress,
that exquisite virginal face.

110
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,001
Who is she?

111
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:32,073
40-love. Game.

112
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:38,002
She's Buckingham's daughter.

113
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,032
A hundred crowns, you don't succeed.

114
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:43,073
Done.

115
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,011
How is our daughter?

116
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,021
She's well.

117
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:56,043
You know her tutors say
she has exceptional talents.

118
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,010
Especially in music.

119
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,053
You should be proud.

120
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:03,031
I am.

121
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:05,071
You know I am, Katherine.

122
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:08,002
Mary is the pearl of my world.

123
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:20,010
You have not answered
my nephew's letters.

124
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:21,990
Just because your
nephew's the king of Spain.

125
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,970
Does he think I have
nothing better to do?

126
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:28,000
You know he advises you to
sign a treaty with the emperor,

127
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:30,043
recognizing France
as our mutual enemy.

128
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:35,011
He also advises you not to
heed everything Wolsey tells you

129
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:37,463
because Wolsey is so
biased with the French.

130
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,073
Since when are you a diplomat?

131
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:45,043
I am my father's daughter.

132
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:47,030
You are my wife.

133
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,042
You are not my minister.

134
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,022
You are not my chancellor.

135
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:53,213
But my wife.

136
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:03,022
I should like to be
your wife in every way.

137
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:11,473
Henry, will you not visit
my bed chamber as you used to?

138
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:15,063
Eat.

139
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:10,353
Gown.

140
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,021
Your Majesty.

141
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:45,042
Where is the Queen Katherine?

142
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:48,012
Her Majesty is still
at prayer, Your Majesty.

143
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:51,020
Tell her Majesty...

144
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,474
I came to offer my love and
devotion as her true husband.

145
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,095
Yes, Your Majesty.

146
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:26,995
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for
us now and at the hour of our death.

147
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,011
Amen.

148
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,040
Hail Mary, Mother of Grace,
our Lord is with thee blessed

149
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:34,141
art thou amongst women and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb. Jesus.

150
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:59,060
Jane.

151
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,050
Your Majesty...

152
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,461
Do you consent?

153
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,012
Yes, Your Majesty.

154
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:34,481
3 points!

155
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,483
Earl of Portland!

156
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:48,393
Mr. Charles Brandon has
now entered the list.

157
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,490
Your Majesties.

158
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,751
My Lady Buckingham,

159
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:09,453
would you do me the honour of
letting me wear your favours today?

160
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:51,400
Lord Hallam challenges.

161
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:53,461
A plaisance!

162
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,473
A terre!

163
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:23,592
Two points.

164
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:26,310
Mr. Charles Brandon.

165
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:37,841
His Grace the Duke of Buckingham

166
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:42,441
will now joust a plaisance
with the Earl of Newcastle.

167
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,073
A terre!

168
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:02,352
Another 3 points for His Grace.

169
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:20,451
Does Your Eminence have a plan?

170
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:24,250
A way to avoid war?

171
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,030
This is the outline
of a new peace treaty.

172
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:33,022
Uniting the English with the French.

173
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:34,040
May I?

174
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,063
No.

175
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:40,001
I want you to take it away
and read it very carefully.

176
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:44,450
I believe it represents something
new in the world of diplomacy.

177
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:49,491
If your King accepts it in principle
he can sign it without any loss of face.

178
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:52,001
Indeed, he can rejoice.

179
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:54,010
My master can rejoice.

180
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:56,071
We can all rejoice.

181
00:17:56,098 --> 00:18:00,490
In which case, what does
Your Eminence want in return?

182
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:02,011
Nothing.

183
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,590
Nothing?

184
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,780
Nothing from you.

185
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:10,083
What I want, Your Grace.

186
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,030
Only you can give me.

187
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:21,010
The Duke of Buckingham
has re-entered the lists.

188
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,480
He's won 10 courses already.
What is he trying to prove?

189
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:26,041
- I'm gonna take him.
- No, I'll do it.

190
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:28,360
I'd love to damage
Buckingham's pride.

191
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:36,311
My Lords, the king
has entered the list.

192
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:51,062
His Majesty makes the challenge?

193
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,061
A la guerre.

194
00:18:58,757 --> 00:19:00,013
Here we go again.

195
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,022
Claim or no claim.

196
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:03,891
Buckingham's not the king.

197
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,012
Not all of the court is
as loyal as you Charles.

198
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:22,010
My Lady.

199
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:23,413
A terre!

200
00:20:24,277 --> 00:20:27,571
His Majesty wins the day.

201
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,013
The King.

202
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,330
And easy!

203
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,340
Present oars!

204
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:21,092
- Thomas.
- Your Majesty.

205
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:23,462
This is my family.

206
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:26,013
Your Majesty.

207
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:27,493
My wife Alice.

208
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,001
Alice, won't you kiss the king?

209
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,012
Mistress Alice.

210
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:35,361
Your Majesty.

211
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:40,972
Shall we walk by the river, Thomas?

212
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:42,403
I like walking.

213
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:48,873
Why won't you come
and live at court?

214
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,880
You know perfectly well
why; I don't like it.

215
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,642
My legal practice
and my life are here.

216
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,573
The court is for more ambitious men.

217
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:02,573
You didn't say much
in council last month.

218
00:22:02,595 --> 00:22:04,001
About what?

219
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:05,570
Going to war with France.

220
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,543
As a humanist I have
an abhorrence of war.

221
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:13,060
It's an activity fit only
for beasts yet practiced

222
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:17,452
by no kind of beast
so constantly as by man.

223
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:19,462
As a humanist I share your opinion.

224
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:22,043
As a king I am forced to disagree.

225
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:24,000
Spoken like a lawyer.

226
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:26,553
- You should know. You taught me.
- Not well enough, it seems.

227
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,092
- Are you finished?
- Yes!

228
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:36,022
Harry!

229
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:36,700
I must urge you

230
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:41,001
that instead of spending ruinous
amounts of money going to war,

231
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:44,752
you should spend it rather, on
the welfare of your people.

232
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:49,092
Thomas, I swear to you...

233
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:52,042
I intend to be a just ruler.

234
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:57,020
But tell me this:
why is Henry V remembered?

235
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:59,223
Because he endowed universities

236
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:01,423
and built alm's houses
for the destitute?

237
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:02,420
No.

238
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:06,003
He is remembered because he
won the Battle of Agincourt.

239
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:09,003
3000 English bowmen
against 60 000 French.

240
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:12,580
The flower of French
chivalry destroyed in 4 hours.

241
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,032
That victory made him famous,
Thomas.

242
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:21,003
It made him immortal.

243
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,052
He has no right to any of this.

244
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,482
His father seized the
crown on the battlefield;

245
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:40,111
he had no real claim to it, only
through a bastard on his mother's side.

246
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,622
Your Grace's family is more ancient.

247
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:46,390
I'm a direct descendant of
Edward II. This is my crown

248
00:23:46,397 --> 00:23:48,873
and this is my court.
Not his crown or his court.

249
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:53,000
That's treason, Your Grace.

250
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,001
It's the truth.

251
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:59,021
And one day...

252
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:02,020
we shall make it come true.

253
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:12,091
Your Grace.

254
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,001
What's this?

255
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:40,010
Brandon!

256
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:41,661
It's what it looks like.

257
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:43,023
Your Grace.

258
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:49,062
You violated my daughter.

259
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:50,093
No.

260
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:52,023
No, she begged.

261
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:54,052
You've taken her honour.

262
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:57,562
I swear to Your Grace, someone
else was there before me.

263
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:03,011
You son of a whore.

264
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,042
Yes, that is true, Your Grace.

265
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:09,002
I should kill you for this.

266
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:15,043
Get out.

267
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:53,572
Eminence, Lady Blount is here.

268
00:25:56,045 --> 00:25:57,072
Very well.

269
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:06,041
Your Eminence.

270
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,550
What can I do for you, Lady Blount?

271
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:12,010
I am...

272
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:15,091
with child, Your Eminence.

273
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:18,053
Yes...

274
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:22,580
it is His Majesty's child.

275
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:28,423
- You are certain?
- Yes.

276
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:33,422
- Have you told the king?
- No.

277
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:35,092
Good.

278
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,022
I will inform His Majesty
in due time.

279
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:47,842
In the mean time you will say
nothing to anybody on pain of death.

280
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:49,411
Do you understand?

281
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:56,400
When you are no longer able to
hide your condition, you will be...

282
00:26:56,967 --> 00:27:01,473
removed to a private
place for your lying-in.

283
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,032
There you can give
birth to your bastard.

284
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:13,043
Thank you, Your Eminence.

285
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:49,493
Will you bless my sick child?

286
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:00,361
Your Eminence, please
draw me an audience...

287
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:03,881
Oh My Lords and Masters, make
way for His Lord's Grace.

288
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:13,000
Your Eminence.

289
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:14,490
Ah, Mr. Pace.

290
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:17,463
I trust you are keeping a
good eye on my interests?

291
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:19,463
Of course, Your Eminence.
Like an eagle.

292
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:21,552
I don't want an eagle, Mr. Pace.

293
00:28:22,088 --> 00:28:23,993
They can soar too high.

294
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:27,762
- Be a pigeon, shit on everything!
- Yes, Eminence.

295
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:31,012
Where is the king?

296
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:32,082
Out hunting.

297
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:35,572
Good. It keeps him in good humour.

298
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:39,461
- Send word when he returns.
- Yes, Eminence.

299
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:46,092
Who are you?

300
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:48,040
What is it you want?

301
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:51,042
I have letters of introduction sir.

302
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:56,573
But these are from the Dean
of Canterbury Cathedral!

303
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:58,013
Yes, sir.

304
00:28:58,018 --> 00:29:01,023
Why did you not present yourself?

305
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:02,621
- Thomas Tallis.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:08,033
And you can play, it says,
the organ and the flute

307
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:11,563
and can sing more
than moderately well.

308
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:13,880
Anything else?

309
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:15,793
Yes, sir.

310
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:18,020
I compose a little.

311
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:20,042
Indeed.

312
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:22,680
Well...

313
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:25,540
if the dean commends your talents...

314
00:30:26,037 --> 00:30:28,690
we shall have to see, won't we?

315
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:34,023
Thomas.

316
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,551
I trust Your Majesty
enjoyed hunting today.

317
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:42,043
How are the preparations going?

318
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:43,021
Very well.

319
00:30:43,025 --> 00:30:45,063
Both your army and
fleet are assembling.

320
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:47,041
Stores and provisions
are being laid in.

321
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:50,041
You could go to war
in a matter of weeks.

322
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:51,063
Excellent.

323
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,260
- I knew I could depend on you.
- I am grateful to Your Majesty.

324
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:06,651
What is it?

325
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:11,030
Your Majesty, wars are expensive.

326
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:13,983
To pay for them
you have to raise taxes.

327
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:17,042
That is not always popular.

328
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:21,273
What if Your Majesty could gain
more power and prestige

329
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:24,520
- by other means?
- Other means?

330
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,043
Peaceful means.

331
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:28,021
What!

332
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:29,081
No battles?

333
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:30,480
No glory?

334
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:33,472
I think Your Majesty
should hear him out.

335
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:41,332
In the past few weeks,
I have conducted,

336
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:45,582
on Your Majesty's behalf,
an intense round of diplomatic talks.

337
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:48,580
Not just with the French ambassador
but also with

338
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:52,042
representatives of the emperor,
with envoys from

339
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:55,543
- Denmark, Portugal, the Italian states--
- What for?

340
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:57,543
To make a treaty.

341
00:31:57,597 --> 00:31:59,032
What kind of treaty?

342
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:03,433
A treaty of universal
and perpetual peace.

343
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:14,013
- How is it to be effected?
- In several stages.

344
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,030
In the first place
there would be

345
00:32:16,048 --> 00:32:18,430
a summit meeting between
the kings of France and England.

346
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,423
At the summit, Your Majesty's
daughter would be betrothed

347
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:23,560
formely to the French dauphin.

348
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:26,003
And at the end of the summit,
you would both sign the treaty.

349
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:29,023
The treaty is entirely new
in the history of Europe,

350
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:32,950
committing all its signatories
to the principles of

351
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,751
collective security
and universal peace.

352
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:39,990
How would it be enforced?

353
00:32:40,097 --> 00:32:43,841
Should any of the signatory
countries suffer aggression,

354
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:47,080
all the others would immediately
demand that the aggressor withdraws.

355
00:32:47,088 --> 00:32:51,500
If he refuses, within 1 month the
rest would declare against him...

356
00:32:51,505 --> 00:32:53,503
and continue until peace is restored.

357
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:59,522
The treaty also envisages the
creation of pan-european institutions.

358
00:33:11,028 --> 00:33:13,003
In some ways I like it.

359
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,022
I recognize it...

360
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,013
So do you, Thomas.

361
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,062
Indeed.

362
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:22,592
It's the application of humanist
principles to international affairs.

363
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,783
Your Eminence is
to be congratulated.

364
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:32,002
I don't seek praise.

365
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:36,023
Your Majesty would be known as the
architect of a new and modern world.

366
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:39,031
That would be reward enough.

367
00:33:41,057 --> 00:33:44,543
Always, be assured of our love.

368
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:49,020
Goodnight gentlemen.

369
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:52,993
What is it?

370
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:56,040
Your Majesty, the Duke of Buckingham
insists upon an audience.

371
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:06,000
Your Grace.

372
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:08,583
Your Majesty ought to be made
aware that I have discovered

373
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,450
Mr. Charles Brandon in flagrante
delicto with my daughter.

374
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:17,672
Mr. Brandon has brought
shame to my family.

375
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:20,543
I demand that Your Majesty
banish him from court

376
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:23,511
with whatever other punishment
Your Majesty sees fit.

377
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:25,401
There will be no punishment!

378
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:28,050
Unless your daughter
accuses Mr. Brandon of rape.

379
00:34:28,057 --> 00:34:29,903
Does she so claim?

380
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:32,682
Does your daughter claim
Mr. Brandon raped her?!

381
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:33,870
She doesn't need to.

382
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:37,023
The offence is against
me and against my family!

383
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,763
As far as I know, there
has been no offence.

384
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:41,643
So there is no need
for any punishment.

385
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,091
Your Majesty.

386
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:50,030
Your Grace.

387
00:34:58,085 --> 00:35:00,541
Be careful of Buckingham, Harry.

388
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:05,031
He may well be stupid, but
he's richer than you are,

389
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:07,663
and he can call upon
a private army.

390
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:10,032
Not even your father crossed him.

391
00:35:19,055 --> 00:35:22,003
I'm very happy that the King
of France has agreed

392
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:24,643
to sign the treaty and
to host the summit.

393
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,030
His Majesty is delighted
there will be no war.

394
00:35:27,036 --> 00:35:28,091
As we all are.

395
00:35:32,018 --> 00:35:34,032
What about the other
matter we discussed?

396
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:37,043
Which other matter, Your Eminence?

397
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:43,992
I saved your master's arse.

398
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:47,961
Now I want my reward.
And you can arrange it.

399
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:50,030
Do you understand?

400
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:09,033
Poor you.

401
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:17,002
Now, where were we when we
were so rudely interrupted?

402
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:26,012
Charles...

403
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:28,002
we shouldn't.

404
00:36:37,055 --> 00:36:39,023
My father will kill you.

405
00:36:47,096 --> 00:36:49,590
Then I shall die a happy man.

406
00:36:58,036 --> 00:36:59,043
Now...

407
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:02,002
Have you all finished
your reading?

408
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:04,000
Yes, father.

409
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,020
Yes, father.

410
00:37:05,027 --> 00:37:06,033
Yes.

411
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,082
Very well.

412
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:15,660
May god and his angels bless you
and keep you this night and always.

413
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:22,032
Goodnight.

414
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:30,011
Goodnight children.

415
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:32,022
Stop.

416
00:38:21,016 --> 00:38:24,042
The letter to King Francis,
Your Majesty.

417
00:38:28,027 --> 00:38:29,581
My dearest Royal Cousin...

418
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:31,063
No.

419
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:34,092
Make that my beloved cousin.

420
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:37,541
We send you our love.

421
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:41,692
We love you so much it would be
impossible to love you better.

422
00:38:43,006 --> 00:38:46,553
Make all the necessary arrangements
so we may meet face to face.

423
00:38:46,598 --> 00:38:49,591
Nothing is now closer or more
dear to my heart

424
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:52,660
than this treaty of universal peace.

425
00:38:56,085 --> 00:39:01,292
As a token of my good will,
my commitment to this treaty, and

426
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:05,073
my love for Your Majesty,

427
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,071
I have decided...

428
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:14,053
I have decided...

429
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:20,020
Yes, Majesty.

430
00:39:20,077 --> 00:39:23,093
I have decided I will not
shave again until we meet.

431
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:28,573
My beard will be a token
of universal friendship,

432
00:39:30,008 --> 00:39:32,512
of the love between us.

433
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,621
- Your Eminence.
- Your Grace.

434
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,572
I have some news
for Your Eminence.

435
00:39:50,045 --> 00:39:54,021
His Holiness, Pope Alexander,
is desperately ill.

436
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:59,562
It cannot be long before he
is summoned to God's house.

437
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:07,042
In view of Your Eminence's
well-known Piety,

438
00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:12,031
as well as your great
learning and diplomatic skills

439
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:15,570
I can assure Your Eminence of the
support of the French cardinals

440
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:18,593
at the conclave
to elect a successor.

441
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:22,011
With the votes of your own cardinals

442
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:28,002
and if it is pleasing to
god you will be elected Pope,

443
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:32,050
Bishop of Rome
ur new Holy Father.

444
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:37,013
Thank you, Your Grace.

445
00:40:38,066 --> 00:40:39,080
You make me feel...

446
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:42,030
truly humble.

447
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,070
Are you ill, Lady Blount?

448
00:40:58,047 --> 00:40:59,562
No, Your Majesty.

449
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,062
Please, stay.

450
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:11,051
Thank you.

451
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:13,020
Goodnight.

452
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,562
I have not talked to
anyone for a long time.

453
00:41:30,058 --> 00:41:33,073
Cardinal Wolsey dismissed
my Spanish confessor

454
00:41:33,078 --> 00:41:37,580
and most of my Spanish ladies
in case they were spies.

455
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:42,022
And I cannot trust
my English confessor.

456
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:47,631
But I can trust you though,
can I not, Lady Blount?

457
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:50,553
Yes, madam.

458
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:55,001
What is my sadness?

459
00:41:57,397 --> 00:42:00,023
It is that I...

460
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:04,011
I cannot give the King a living son.

461
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,790
I gave birth to a baby boy once.

462
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:13,002
A sweet boy...

463
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:18,793
but he died...

464
00:42:19,065 --> 00:42:21,401
in my arms...

465
00:42:23,075 --> 00:42:26,582
after just 4 weeks of life.

466
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,031
The king blames me. I know.

467
00:42:30,045 --> 00:42:31,683
He thinks it all my fault!

468
00:42:32,698 --> 00:42:37,030
He does not know how much
I suffer, how much I pray.

469
00:42:43,078 --> 00:42:45,560
I've been thinking
about my brother.

470
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:48,001
Arthur.

471
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:53,030
When he died it was decided
that I should marry Katherine.

472
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:57,541
I think my father didn't
want to lose her dowry.

473
00:42:59,057 --> 00:43:01,030
Or the prestige...

474
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:03,060
of a Spanish marriage.

475
00:43:06,028 --> 00:43:07,072
In any case...

476
00:43:09,077 --> 00:43:13,022
Katherine swore the marriage
was never consummated.

477
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:17,581
That's why a Papal
dispensation was granted.

478
00:43:20,078 --> 00:43:22,033
And so I married her.

479
00:43:27,027 --> 00:43:31,080
And since then we have
had 5 still-born children.

480
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:34,023
A boy...

481
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:39,580
who lived for 26 days...

482
00:43:45,058 --> 00:43:47,091
And a single living daughter.

483
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:53,063
What if their marriage
was consummated?

484
00:43:55,095 --> 00:43:58,043
She has sworn before God
that it was not.

485
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:01,021
What does it say in the gospels?

486
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:05,570
If a man should marry
his brother's wife?

487
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:07,073
Tell me.

488
00:44:09,015 --> 00:44:10,693
In the Leviticus...

489
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:15,040
it says: "If a man
marries his brother's wife,

490
00:44:15,048 --> 00:44:17,040
they will die childless".

491
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:19,041
But you have a child.

492
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:21,002
But not a son!

493
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:24,093
I have no son.

494
00:44:42,018 --> 00:44:43,673
Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.

495
00:44:45,026 --> 00:44:46,053
Sir Thomas.

496
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:49,042
I hope you didn't find my
invitation presumptuous.

497
00:44:49,047 --> 00:44:51,031
I heard you had been
recalled from France.

498
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:53,012
I'm here for a short while,
Your Grace.

499
00:44:56,047 --> 00:44:57,071
Come.

500
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:01,013
They tell me you are
an excellent ambassador.

501
00:45:01,056 --> 00:45:04,623
Then, whoever they are,
they are very kind.

502
00:45:05,098 --> 00:45:08,653
You come from an old family.

503
00:45:10,065 --> 00:45:13,040
Though not as ancient, nor
as grand, as Your Grace's.

504
00:45:13,096 --> 00:45:16,090
The King chooses to surround
himself with commoners,

505
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:19,063
men of no distinction, new men,
without pedigree or titles.

506
00:45:19,076 --> 00:45:21,661
How does that help the
prestige of his crown?

507
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,592
- Your Grace, I...
- His father only acquired the crown

508
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:27,551
- by force not by right!
- Your Grace,

509
00:45:27,698 --> 00:45:31,651
no one wants to return to
the evil days of civil war.

510
00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:34,561
What is done is done.

511
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:37,020
The King is the King.

512
00:45:39,035 --> 00:45:40,061
The King is the King.

513
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:45,042
Wolsey.

514
00:45:48,007 --> 00:45:51,020
A man of the cloth with a
mistress and two children.

515
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,022
How do you like this fellow?

516
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,063
Not at all.

517
00:46:05,005 --> 00:46:06,042
We shall talk again.

518
00:46:14,078 --> 00:46:16,682
Tell me about King Francis,
Sir Thomas.

519
00:46:17,048 --> 00:46:20,020
- He is 23 years old.
- Is he tall?

520
00:46:20,038 --> 00:46:21,570
Yes.

521
00:46:23,065 --> 00:46:25,013
But ill-proportioned.

522
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:28,540
What about his legs?

523
00:46:29,035 --> 00:46:31,663
Are his calves strong, like mine?

524
00:46:31,677 --> 00:46:34,691
Majesty, no one has calves like yours.

525
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:42,670
Is he handsome?

526
00:46:43,098 --> 00:46:45,532
Some people might think so.

527
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:50,690
- He certainly thinks so himself.
- He's vain?

528
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:53,672
Your Majesty, he's French!

529
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,671
What about his court?

530
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:05,661
It has a reputation for loose
morals and licentiousness,

531
00:47:05,665 --> 00:47:08,883
which the king, by his own
behaviour, does nothing to dispel.

532
00:47:09,088 --> 00:47:12,012
You have two daughters, Sir Thomas.

533
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:15,853
- How do you protect them?
- I keep a watchful eye on them.

534
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:19,663
But I also trust in
their goodness and vertue.

535
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:25,610
You will return immediately to Paris.

536
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:29,630
I am entrusting you with all the
diplomatic negotiations for the summit.

537
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:39,052
Checkmate.

538
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:44,071
Your Majesty...

539
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:47,021
Mary!

540
00:47:48,386 --> 00:47:50,002
Papa.

541
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:51,691
Aren't you beautiful?

542
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:54,000
Aren't you the most
beautiful girl in the world?

543
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:57,013
- I don't know.
- Yes you are. How do you feel?

544
00:47:57,038 --> 00:47:59,052
- Well.
- Well?

545
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:01,043
Papa's busy.

546
00:48:01,447 --> 00:48:04,071
Be good.
Do everything you are told.

547
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,303
May we speak?

548
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:11,582
Continue.

549
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:15,550
My Lady.

550
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:23,011
Majesty.

551
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:35,071
- I do not like it.
- What don't you like?

552
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:37,041
Your beard.

553
00:48:39,027 --> 00:48:41,811
- Not what it represents.
- Katherine.

554
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:45,291
You are giving my daughter away
to the Dauphin and to France.

555
00:48:45,296 --> 00:48:47,482
You did not even consult me.

556
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:52,022
The Valois are the sworn
enemies of my family.

557
00:48:52,038 --> 00:48:56,652
She is mine to do with as I see fit.
It's a great marriage.

558
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:01,632
I see Wolsey's hand behind this.

559
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:08,023
Though I love Your Majesty,

560
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:13,060
and am loyal to you
in every way,

561
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:19,032
I cannot disguise my
distress and unhappiness.

562
00:49:20,025 --> 00:49:21,783
Well you're going to have to.

563
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:32,010
Paris, France

564
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:35,012
Bonjour Monsieur l'Ambassadeur.

565
00:49:35,036 --> 00:49:37,010
Il y a des messages pour vous.

566
00:49:37,018 --> 00:49:39,020
Et demain vous avez une
audience avec le Roi.

567
00:49:39,027 --> 00:49:41,092
Très bien. Merci Pierre.

568
00:49:41,107 --> 00:49:42,671
Where are my daughters?

569
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:45,681
I have some exciting news.

570
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:49,753
There is to be a summit between King
Francis and King Henry near Calais.

571
00:49:49,757 --> 00:49:51,911
I am to arrange it.

572
00:49:52,048 --> 00:49:53,342
That means you will both

573
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:55,852
have the opportunity
to meet the King of England!

574
00:49:58,068 --> 00:49:59,042
Mary.

575
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:06,010
And Anne. Boleyn.

576
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:07,680
To your futures!

577
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,000
His Eminence Cardinal Wolsey.

578
00:50:14,037 --> 00:50:15,663
I want your opinion.

579
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:20,632
Do you like this cloth?

580
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:23,293
I think it suits Your Majesty very well.

581
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:31,672
Perhaps, if I might suggest...

582
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:35,690
with these.

583
00:50:38,087 --> 00:50:41,622
Do you think Francis will
have anything as fine as these?

584
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:43,683
Only if he steals them.

585
00:50:45,018 --> 00:50:46,001
Come.

586
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:49,523
Let's eat together.
We can talk.

587
00:50:59,025 --> 00:51:00,041
Hold.

588
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:17,650
Your Grace will apologize.

589
00:51:20,098 --> 00:51:21,692
I said...

590
00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:24,013
You will apologize.

591
00:51:25,027 --> 00:51:28,021
I apologize if I have offended
Your Majesty.

592
00:51:30,028 --> 00:51:31,682
Your Grace may leave us.

593
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:39,012
Boy, fetch the chancellor
a new pair of shoes!

594
00:51:40,038 --> 00:51:41,020
Hopkins!

595
00:51:43,488 --> 00:51:45,030
Hopkins!

596
00:52:02,057 --> 00:52:03,042
Your Grace.

597
00:52:04,055 --> 00:52:05,060
It's time.

598
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:09,010
Speak to me.

599
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:11,011
Yes, well...

600
00:52:11,075 --> 00:52:13,073
everything is prepared
for the summit.

601
00:52:14,078 --> 00:52:17,970
It will take place in the Pale
of Calais, English territory.

602
00:52:17,975 --> 00:52:21,183
In a valley known as the
Val d'Or, the Valley of Gold.

603
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:26,013
A thousand labourers have constructed
a palace for Your Majesty.

604
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:28,081
It's known as the Palace of Illusions.

605
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:30,693
Some say it's the
8th wonder of the world!

606
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:35,622
You are to purchase as much cloth
of gold and silver as you can find.

607
00:52:35,628 --> 00:52:37,600
It is a better thing to
bribe the guards with.

608
00:52:37,626 --> 00:52:38,613
Yes, Your Grace.

609
00:52:38,615 --> 00:52:41,513
Then I want you to proceed to our
estates and do as we discussed,

610
00:52:41,517 --> 00:52:44,811
just making some noise that we're
only raising men to defend ourselves.

611
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:46,480
Yes, Your Grace.

612
00:52:48,606 --> 00:52:52,672
Lady Blount is with child.

613
00:53:00,017 --> 00:53:01,010
Lady Blount?

614
00:53:01,618 --> 00:53:04,050
If you want to keep the child,
I will arrange for her

615
00:53:04,065 --> 00:53:07,051
to be moved to
the house at Jericho.

616
00:53:09,037 --> 00:53:11,623
I will also deal with her husband.

617
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:17,030
My father...

618
00:53:17,045 --> 00:53:20,621
once told me how he had planned
to assassinate Richard III.

619
00:53:22,077 --> 00:53:25,883
He would come before him with a
knife secreted about his person.

620
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:29,502
Your Majesty!

621
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:07,622
I can't wait for this summit!

622
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:10,772
It'll change the world forever.

623
00:54:11,045 --> 00:54:14,532
That is my dearest
hope, and my ultimate belief.

624
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:19,683
Nothing will ever be
the same, Your Eminence.

625
00:54:21,075 --> 00:54:23,761
You and I will be immortal.

626
00:54:23,768 --> 00:54:27,813
