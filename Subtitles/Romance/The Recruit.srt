00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,204
Have six pull in tight
on F-4.

185
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,970
All right,
now give me some angles,

186
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,739
both tests... both tests.

187
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:01,905
Tighter.

188
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,084
It's a carbon copy.

189
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,552
F-4... yank him.

190
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,915
You've been caught
cheating, pal.

191
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,722
Please leave.

192
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,854
Still got the eyes, Walter.

193
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:19,955
What's that story,

194
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,592
you saw some old woman
pushing a baby carriage?

195
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,263
And Walter sees the carriage is
riding a little low, so bam!

196
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,306
No questions, blows grandma
right out of her shoes.

197
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,500
Turned out she was Hamas,

198
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,736
and the whole thing was
stuffed with explosives.

199
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,540
She wasn't Hamas,
she was Abu Nidal.

200
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,045
Abu Nidal, that's right.

201
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,174
These war stories...
you just love them, don't you?

202
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,451
Uh, D-4...

203
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,259
tell him to forget the chick
and finish the test.

204
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,927

and finish the test."

PS YCHIATRIST:
How do upsetting problems

207
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,404
generally make you feel?

208
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,412
JAMES: Upset.

209
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,244
And when you get angry,

210
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,478
do you have trouble
staying in control?

211
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,780
Sure.

212
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,754
How do you typically
deal with failure?

213
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,084
Badly.

214
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,852
Have you ever been deliberately
cruel to an animal?

215
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,586
Yes.

216
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,888
Please, elaborate.

217
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,056
For Christmas, I tied wool
reindeer horns to my dog's head.

218
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,294
PS YCHIATRIST #1:
Would you consider yourself

219
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,134
subjectively firm
or objectively flexible?

220
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,333
Metaphysically wrinkle-free.

221
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,672
Quickly... would you rather
ride on a train,

222
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,144
dance in the rain,
or feel no pain?

223
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,575
[Door opens]

224
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,544

225
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,849
Feel no pain.

226
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:58,192
I know I said the rain-dancing
thing, but... feel no pain.

227
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,190
Thank you.

228
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,901
God, I hate this.

229
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,673
Hey.

230
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,771
Hi.

231
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,315
I'm James.

232
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,951
Layla.

233
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,816
Like the song.

234
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,786
Yeah.

235
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,586
That's a big coffee.

236
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,184
I'm a big girl.

237
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,455
Sure.

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,326
POLYGRAPH OPERATOR:
Is your name James Clayton?

00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,094
James Douglas Clayton.

240
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,499
Just a yes-or-no answer.

241
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,163
Is your name James Clayton?

242
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,501
Yes.

243
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:46,135
You were born
October 21, 1976?

244
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,803
Yes.

245
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,644
Have you ever worked for
any foreign governments?

246
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,740
No.

247
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,718
Have you taken tranquilizers
today?

248
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,550
No.

249
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,683

Miami.

254
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,698
Mind if I sit here?

255
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:17,867
Sure.

256

[Zack speaking Farsi]

257
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,544
Hey.
Ronnie Gibson from D.C.

258
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,138
James Clayton from all over.

259
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,843
[Chuckles]
Nice to meet you.

260
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:26,850
You too.

261
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,288
[Layla speaking Farsi]

262
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,053
You got any idea what those two
are speaking over there?

263
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,991
I think it's Farsi.

264
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,461
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Farsi.

Uh, what are you doing?

270
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,359
Nothing.

271
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,364
What?

272
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,731
Some of these chairs
are wired.

273
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,736
They catch you drifting
during this,

274
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,066
10,000 volts up your ass.

275
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,367
Bullshit.

276
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,305
All right.

277
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,070
- Good morning.
- ALL: Good morning.

278
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,078
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Dennis Slayne.

279
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,273
I'm assistant director
of operations at Langley,

280
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,043
and I would like
to welcome you here

281
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,880
to the CIA Special
Training Facility,

282
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,217
affectionately known
as "the farm."

283
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,346
Now let me introduce to you

284
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,084
your senior instructor,
Mr. Walter Burke.

285
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,352
Morning.

286
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,791
ALL: Morning.

287
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,488
So, why are you here?

288
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,931
Why are you here?

289
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,163
It ain't the money.

290
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:04,505
A GS-15 pay grade officer,
yours truly...

291
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,842
I rake in about, what,
75 grand a year?

292
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:13,351
You can't buy
a decent sports car for that.

293
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,010
It ain't sex.

294
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,113
Hey, being here
won't get you laid.

295
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,782
Oh, you're
a dental hygienist?

296
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:24,261
I'm a member of the CIA,
Moscow Station chief.

297
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,297
- [All chuckling]
- Hello?!

298
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,799
What about fame?

299
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,064
Our failures are known.

300
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:36,801
Our successes... are not.

301
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,536
That's the company motto.

302
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,204
You save the world,

303
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,080
they send you to some
dusty basement at Langley,

304
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,084
give you a little lemonade
and cookies,

305
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,676
and show you your medal.

306
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,244
You don't even get
to take it home.

307
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,189
So it ain't money,
it ain't sex, it ain't fame.

308
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,555
What is it?

309
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,756
I say we are all here
in this room

310
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,231
because we believe.

311
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:06,067
We believe in good and evil,

312
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,696
and we choose good.

313
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,503
We believe in right and wrong,

314
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,942
and we choose right.

315
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,639
Our cause is just.

316
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:20,811
Our enemies... everywhere.

317
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,446
They're all around us.

318
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,513
Some scary stuff out there.

319
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,789
Which brings us here...
to the farm.

320
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:34,161
You have all just stepped
through the looking glass.

321
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,701
What you see, what you hear...

322
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:40,135
nothing is what it seems.

Hey.

327
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,710
I was just, uh... I was hoping
maybe I could buy you a beer

328
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,118
and we could talk.

329
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,555
I have so many questions
about my dad.

330
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,286
You're making a mistake, son.

331
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,328
Let me remedy it.

with you

for that reason...

I was recruiting you.

I'm not your friend.

336
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,668
I'm not your ally.

we're gonna teach you
how to deceive,

You will night-parachute,
rappel from choppers,

361
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,978
learn dry and wet demolition,

362
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,644
learn tactical, high-speed
emergency driving.

363
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,948
You will become...

That's good.

367
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,287
You're ahead of all of us.

368

Let's start with Clayton.
Why don't you take... Zack?

Aah!

00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,429
[Chuckles] Nice move.

371

you learn how to do that?

Come on, rough me up.
Let's go! Rough me up!

- No.

Let's do it.

399
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:30,230
These are paper ants...
microphone transmitters.

400
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,702
They adhere equally well
to flesh or clothing,

401
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,762
and they're biologically
manufactured,

402
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,740
so as soon
as they become separated

403
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,504
from their storage palate,
they begin to break down.

404
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:43,912
After 48 hours,
this bug consumes itself.

405
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,109
These are all live

You can conceal them
throughout the bug house.

409
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,989
Your objective is to gain entry,
install three bugs each,

410
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,226
and exit the bug house
without getting caught.

411
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,767
You will have eight minutes.

What do we got here, Walter,
a bunch of D.S. & T. Geeks,

00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,561
or we got some quality

I don't know.

416
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,325

you've tagged a NOC.

Well, maybe yes, maybe no.

You've just been blanketed.

Buenas noches, amigo.
You've just been blanketed.

Who was that?

441
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,393
You okay?

442
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,401
Yeah.

443
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,768
Okay.

444
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,569
Some of you will not survive
the farm.

445
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,372
Some will be asked to leave.

446
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,174
Some will quit.

447
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,612
But those of you
who do graduate

448
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,242
will be sent to work
out of Langley

449
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:04,880
or embassies around the world
as official cover operatives.

450
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,289
That is, spies
with diplomatic immunity.

451
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,760
Now, every once in a while,

452
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:15,630
someone is selected to be
a nonofficial cover operative,

453
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,863
or N-O-C... NOC.

454
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:23,897
The NOC is the truest
practitioner of espionage...

455
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,376
always out there,
always alone, unprotected.

456
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,538
If you are caught,

457
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:34,449
you will most likely be
tortured, shot, and/or hanged.

458
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,181
And here's the best part...

459
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,883
no one will ever hear about it.

460
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,052
You will become a star
on a wall,

speak Spanish?

I do.

475

547
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,701
What's it look like?

548
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,293
Looks like you're drunk.

549
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,362
Perceptive.

550
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,066
Is everything okay?

551
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,575
Yeah, everything's great.

552
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,838
All right.

553
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,846
See you tomorrow.

554
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,279
## =w, change ##

555
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,337
James...

556
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,316
## But be yourself, now ##

557
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,047
- They cut me. I'm out.
- ## Change ##

558
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,884
- You're kidding.
- ## But be yourself, now ##

559
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,049
- I'm out of the program.
- ## Change ##

560
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,786
You're serious...
did they say why?

561
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,952
They didn't say anything.

562
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,155
They just sit you down,
debrief you,

563
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,290
and then stick you
in some shit-bag motel.

564
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,560
## Change ##

565
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,999
## But be yourself, now ##

566
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,038
Sorry, all I can think about
is throwing up.

567
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,197
You all right?

568
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,901
Yeah, I think I had
too much tequila.

569
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,307
You know,
it's just that you and I

570
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,314
finally have
this chemistry moment,

571
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,215
you know, and I even have
a motel room

572
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,479
where we could go back

573
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,680
and have completely
justifiable comfort sex,

574
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,882
but all I can think about
is not throwing up.

575
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,789
[Chuckles]

576
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,386
The... the room's spinning,
right?

577
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,896
Yeah, like a top.

578
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,296
You should go home.
I'll call you a cab.

579
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,495
Come on. Come here.

580
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,705
Will you settle for taking
me home and tucking me in?

581
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,037
I wish.

582
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,045
[Cheers and applause]

583
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,005
Blue Ridge Bar, yeah.

584
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,518
10 minutes? Thank you.

585
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,144
Cab will be here in 10.

586
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,018
- Okay.
- Okay.

587
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,614
Come on, wait with me
outside, okay?

588
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,623
I...

589
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,681
Come on.

590
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,728
Layla, let's wait inside.
It's cold.

591
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,322
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Just wait.

592
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,028
Come on.
I want to kiss you.

593
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,229
Tell me about it.

594
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,328
Thank you.

595
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,497
For what?

596
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,074
Op completed.

597
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,406
My op was to stop you
from completing yours.

598
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,379
- Who said my op was complete?
- [Horn honks]

599
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,252
- Lighten up, man.
- It's just an op.

600
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,087
Just doing her job,
that's it.

601
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,389
God, I hate this guy.

602
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,734
You did your job. Good.

603
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,667
ZACK: Are you a citizen
of the United States?

604
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,898
- Layla: Yes.
- [Beeping]

605
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,304
True.

606
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,400
Are you in any way
affiliated with the CIA?

607
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,409
No.

608
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,945
- [Shrill beep]
- It's false.

609
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,981
All right, let's break up
this dance team.

610
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,748
Clayton, switch places
with, uh, Zack here.

611
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,351
All right, we all know,
I believe,

612
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,691
what a lie is when we see it.

613
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:30,462
But a good interrogator
can also soften a subject...

614
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,902
you know, uh,
knock them off-balance,

615
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,836
make them vulnerable.

616
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,898
Never know what you might get.

617
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,638
So... fire at will.

618
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,703
[Inhales sharply]

619
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,373
Is your name Layla Moore?

620
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,475
- Yes.
- [Beeping]

621
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,952
True.

622
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,986
Last night at the bar,

623
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,958
you said we had
chemistry together.

624
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,289
Do we?

625
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,487
What?

626
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,531
His interrogation.
Answer the man.

627
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,862
Simple question...
yes or no?

628
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,960
I was undercover legend.
It was part of the op.

629
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,305
- [Beeping]
- True.

630
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,499
[Beeping]

631
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,873
You said you wanted to go home
and have comfort sex.

632
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,640
Did you?

633
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,046
You're abusing this exercise.

634
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,585
Did you want to have sex with me
last night... yes or no?

635
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,716
No.

636
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,928
[Shrill beeping]

637
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,067
Would you do anything
to become a CIA officer?

638
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,267
Anything?

639
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,339
No.

640
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:59,189
[Beeping]

641
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,559
Layla!

642
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,686
Stay away from me.

643
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:05,854
Can I talk to you?

644
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,158
There are limits, James.

645
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,256
You want to suck up to Burke,
do it on your own.

646
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,459
This isn't about Burke.

647
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,670
You won, okay?
You got even.

648
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,069
How does it feel?

649
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,629
Huh?

650
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,402
God!

651
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,467
[Panting]

652
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,484
I pity the fool.

653
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:32,814
Anyone I know?

654
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,050
Maybe.

655
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,160
Let it go.

656
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,753
You first.

657
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,821
[Panting]

658
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,893
I don't know how I...

659
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,603
I don't belong here.

660
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,268
Come on...
meant to do this, son.

661
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,141
You know more about me
than I do?

662
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,309
Hey, this bag knows more
about you than you do, James.

663
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,714
It's in you.

664
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,480
It's in your blood.

665
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,487
Aah!

666
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,047
BURKE: Mama Land's crabs

667
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,593
from the Circle's fourteenth
in Saigon...

668
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,185
best crabs in the world.

669
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,255
This place... second-best.

670
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,366
Okay, why don't you
just go ahead?

671
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,441
Go ahead and ask me.

672
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,039
Did you know him?

673
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,780
No.

674
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,548
I met him once.

675
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,078
Falklands... around '89.

676
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,818
[Chewing, crunching]

677
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,258
What was he...
what was he doing there?

678
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,058
Think, son.
I can't tell you specifics.

679
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,496
I just can't.

680
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,525
I can't even confirm
his mission.

681
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,036
I can't.

682
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,933
He used to tell me stories.

683
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,101
He'd say, uh...

684
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:02,407
when they'd hit one,
the desert would rain oil.

685
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,142
That's what he did, James.
He told stories.

686
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,148
Yeah.

687
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,377
And he lied.

688
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,581
That doesn't mean
he didn't love you.

689
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,416
What was he, really?

690
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,552
What did he do?

691
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,889
You gotta come off it, kid.
You really do.

692
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,696
Because you keep looking back,

693
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,465
you're gonna miss
your whole life.

694
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:31,338
It's a mystery
you cannot solve.

695
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,969
Who is...
who is Edward Clayton?

696
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:38,141
Well, among many things,
he was James Clayton's father.

697
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,115
Also, he was someone else.

698
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,782
[Crunching continues]

699
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:53,062
He was a spook, James...
just like me.

700
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,859
Just like you.

701
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,025
Don't look now.

702
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,968
By the bar...
we're being followed.

703
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,129
You serious?

704
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,105
Yeah.

705
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,904
Sometimes these guys
just like to loiter around,

706
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,706
see if they can gain intel
on the farm.

707
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,713
I'll get someone on it.

708
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,772
[Crunching continues]

709
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,733
Hey.

710
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:37,866
Looking good.

711
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,001
Yeah, but can I do it
blindfolded

712
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,442
jumping out of a plane?

713
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,571
I bet you can.

714
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,080
Thanks.

715
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,583
It's probably not
the best time to apologize.

716
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,676
You don't have to apologize.

717
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,278
[Chuckles]

718
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,289
Can I?

719
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,756
Sure.

720
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,668
Here's how
I'm gonna look at it.

721
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:10,104
We learned a lot
about each other.

722
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,005
Yeah, the hard way.

723
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:16,103
Yeah, the hard way,
but still... at least we know.

724
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,713
Okay.

725
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,742
So, now...
we're ahead of the game.

726
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,253
Is that it?

727
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,686
Exactly.

728
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,357
So what do we do?

729
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,189
Nothing.

730
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,161
Not here.

731
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,662
Not now.

732
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,494
No, not now.

733
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:43,501
JAMES: One year from now,
where are you?

734
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,407
Probably waitressing
at Denny's.

735
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:50,038
Mm-hmm... yeah.

736
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:54,813
When I was a kid, my father
would get out the atlas...

737
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,147
[Exhales deeply]

738
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,189
BURKE: Okay, today we practice
the art of surveillance.

739
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,655
Remember your training.

740
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,249
The person being followed
is the...

741
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,521
Rabbit.

742
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,859
Rabbit. The person doing
the following is the...

743
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,193
- Eye.
- Eye.

744
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:12,065
Behind the eye is the rest
of the surveillance team,

745
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,537
who cannot see the rabbit
but follow the eye.

746
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,767
As the rabbit travels,

747
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,573
the teammates will rotate
themselves into the eye position

748
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,739
so that the rabbit doesn't
realize he's being followed.

749
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,113
Rabbit, don't forget,
your choke points

750
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,516
help you to identify
who's on your tail.

751
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,418
And keep those cellphones off.

752
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,890
In the field,
they act like homing devices.

753
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,291
All right?
What do we do?

754
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,524
ALL: Lmprovise, modify,
adapt, overcome.

755
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,259
Let's go to work!

756
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,063
Turn your cellphone off?

757
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,534
Didn't bring it.

758
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,367
Good.

759
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:52,034
Hey... this looks like
a good choke point.

760
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,235
You're right.

761
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,150
Let's hide here
and wait, okay?

762
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,549
Sure.

I am a Diplomatic Corps trainee.

774

We know that you work
for the CIA.

775
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,998
The CIA.

776
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,340
I don't work for the CIA.

777
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,970

You guys make the best stuff.

799
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,605
You realize that no country
with a McDonald's

800

has ever attacked
the United States?

what you're talking about.

a game, James?

No.

00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,029
The washout was faked.

912
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,629
You're the NOC.

913
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,231
I told you I was
a scary judge of talent.

914
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,210
Why me?

915
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,137
Get in here.

916
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,380
[Door closes]

917
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,044
I don't believe this.

918
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:07,047
[Door closes]

919
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,489
More farm mind games.

920
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,356
Nothing is what it seems,
na na na.

921
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,361
No, no, no, no.
School's out.

922
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:16,092
Open that, uh,
glove compartment.

923
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,464
Go ahead.

924
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,867
- [Sighs]
- [Clicks]

925
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:23,839
Find out why you.

926
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,048
That's why you.

927
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:39,316
Layla? Wh...

928
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,324
Layla Moore...

929
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:44,259
raised from the age of 3
by Tom and Susan Moore

930
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,262
of Worcester, Mass.

931
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,959
However, her real last name
isn't Moore... it's Nasari.

932
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:52,798
Birth mother is Algerian,
father's French.

933
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,337
It's all there...

934
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:59,900
secret bank accounts,
phony records, fake passports.

935
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:01,945
Layla's a sleeper.

936
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,742
She's a mole, James.

937
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,516
I don't believe it.
This is crazy.

938
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:11,748
How the hell
did she get into the farm...

939
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,346
We wanted her in.

940
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:16,257
We want her to burrow in
as deep as she can,

941
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:18,795
because then, she'll lead us
to her handlers.

942
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,420
We know exactly
what she wants.

943
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:24,058
It's who she's giving it to...
that's what we need to know.

944
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:27,126
Layla's gonna take us
right up the food chain.

945
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,831
I won't do it.

946
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,271
You won't do it?

947
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:33,469
James...

948
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:37,105
why do you think I came
to Cambridge to recruit you?

949
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:39,274
Nobody's chasing CTs anymore.

950
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,580
I mean, our applications
are through the roof.

951
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:45,110
We needed you... James.

952
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:46,520
No accidents.

953
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,024
You and Layla were matched.

954
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,856
She's an orphan.

955
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:53,192
You're a young man
searching for a father.

956
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:56,062
You're both highly motivated,
you're both highly independent.

957
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,658
You even look good together.

958
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,965
We paired you at the farm, son.

959
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,440
We paired you, remember?

960
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,534
The Blue Ridge barhop?

961
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:10,102
The lie detector session?

962
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,239
The choke point test?

963
00:54:12,316 --> 00:54:14,807
And it worked, didn't it?

964
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,750
She trusts you.

965
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,253
Loves you, maybe.

966
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:21,655
And you're gonna take
that trust and that love

967
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,421
and you're gonna use it to
find out who she's working for.

968
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,399
James...

969
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:36,598
My first posting was
in Italy... Trieste.

970
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:39,768
A physics conference
met there every summer.

971
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:43,609
So I meet this local girl...
beautiful, sweet.

972
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:47,344
She's working for the Russian
group as a secretary.

973
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:50,945
Anyway, I did my job.
I worked her. I turned her.

974
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,546
Pretty soon, she's giving me
everything, you know...

975
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,559
I mean,
really high-grade stuff...

976
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,596
and, uh, I'm a hero.

977
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,860
But I'm still a kid, two years,
fresh out of Ocala, Florida.

978
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:05,663
I got this perfect Italian girl,
and she's crazy for me,

979
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,226
and we're falling in love.

980
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,035
I knew the Russians were
getting close to her.

981
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:14,077
I knew she was
in jeopardy, but...

982
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,941
material was valuable.

983
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:19,012
I could've warned her.

984
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:23,076
I could've saved her.

985
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:27,185
But the information
was more important.

986
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,221
You understand?

987
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:34,788
The information was more
important than she was...

988
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:37,993
more important than I was.

989
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,867
It is what we do.

990
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:50,579
I need to think about it.

991
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,138
Oh, come on.
"Think about it."

992
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,582
You got 24 hours.
