487
02:41:42,856 --> 02:41:44,687
Rasika has told me everything.

488
02:41:44,891 --> 02:41:47,655
Rasika is lying.

Are you happy?

491
02:41:56,770 --> 02:41:57,600
Yes.

492
02:41:58,672 --> 02:41:59,696
Bhuan Jee is a good man.

493
02:42:01,841 --> 02:42:04,639
l would have called Dev Jee
if we would've got married.

494
02:42:04,811 --> 02:42:06,779
Let the clothes stay in there for
a while.

He has two kids.
- They're lovely, they love me very much.

504
02:44:21,714 --> 02:44:22,738
You don't love me.

505
02:44:23,683 --> 02:44:25,651
You can't love anyone but
yourself.

506
02:44:25,819 --> 02:44:28,652
You should get married to this
mirror, bathroom mirror.

507
02:44:34,861 --> 02:44:35,885
Don't drink too much.

508
02:44:36,830 --> 02:44:39,799
Some things you get very fond of
that you hate everything else.

509
02:44:46,806 --> 02:44:47,773
l'm going home.

510
02:44:48,741 --> 02:44:49,673
Forget about me.

511
02:44:49,809 --> 02:44:51,674
And go and take care of your work.

512
02:44:52,912 --> 02:44:54,777
And you go take care of you
old husband.

513
02:44:56,649 --> 02:44:58,742
He's old by age.
But not in bed.

514
02:44:59,919 --> 02:45:02,911
Then what are you doing here? You
should've stayed on top your old superman.

515
02:45:03,823 --> 02:45:05,757
With him l don't need to be
On tOp.

516
02:45:08,928 --> 02:45:10,691
Making fun of me?

517
02:45:11,731 --> 02:45:14,757
NO.
Just reminding you of your place.

518
02:47:47,920 --> 02:47:48,852
What happened?

519
02:47:53,659 --> 02:47:54,785
Would you say something?

520
02:48:10,777 --> 02:48:15,840
Your lover very depressed.
He threw his purse at me.

521
02:48:16,849 --> 02:48:21,809
Don't let him go, keep him with
you. 10 days, 15 days.

522
02:48:21,888 --> 02:48:24,652
Until then l'll empty his purse.

523
02:48:37,703 --> 02:48:41,639
Give me his purse.

524
02:48:42,742 --> 02:48:44,607
Are you in love?

525
02:48:44,811 --> 02:48:47,609
You'll get your money.
Give me his purse.

526
02:48:48,648 --> 02:48:50,878
She's gone mad.
- Keep mouth shut, you pimp.

527
02:48:52,652 --> 02:48:53,641
His purse.

528
02:50:21,674 --> 02:50:22,663
Did you sleep?

529
02:50:27,780 --> 02:50:28,872
There's coffee in the coffee maker.

530
02:50:41,928 --> 02:50:44,761
What's your story?

- Become a whore?

02:50:57,810 --> 02:51:00,904
l have a client.
He can't even say whore.

533
02:51:04,884 --> 02:51:06,875
Saying whore is out of fashion.

534
02:51:09,789 --> 02:51:13,657
She did the right thing.
You don't love her.

535
02:51:13,826 --> 02:51:16,852
l love her.
- Then you would've been with her.

536
02:51:17,697 --> 02:51:20,894
When you found out that lt was
yourfault, there was still time.

537
02:51:21,634 --> 02:51:25,764
But your ego is biggerthan you,
not once you told herto stop.

538
02:51:40,886 --> 02:51:43,616
l'm okay since l accepted it all.

539
02:51:44,690 --> 02:51:47,750
Are you okay?
- You say that l'm not okay.

540
02:51:59,739 --> 02:52:00,899
Whateveryou say.
You're the boss.

541
02:52:02,708 --> 02:52:03,800
What are you so happy?

542
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:06,778
What else l should do?
Tell me.

543
02:52:14,754 --> 02:52:16,779
l have ears.

544
02:52:18,624 --> 02:52:19,886
Why are you taking her side?

545
