I'm not gonna hook up with Matty again
until we DTR.

- What are you talking about?
- Define the relationship.

00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,217
Thanks again for ditching
out of the party with me.

5
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:10,427
It was the best part of the night.

6
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,595
Jenna, I like you.

7
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,973
I'm just not sure I'm ready

In high school,
perception's everything.

10
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:27,903
And being dropped off by a parent

11
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,088
is like owning a rolling backpack

12
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:32,824
or kissing your grandparent
on the mouth.

13
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,326
Unsavory.

14
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,396
In an environment where
everyone was playing the role

15
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:38,622
of judge and jury,

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,666
the only way to survive was to assert

17
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,833
some kind of independence.

18
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:43,001
All right, all right, all right.

19
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,629
I'm getting out.

20
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,756
You need to blend,
and then change that shirt.

21
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,842
People are gonna think that
we can't afford nice things.

22
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,178
Here.
And it's backless,

23
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,514
so you don't even have to wear a bra.

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,682
Nice. That'll be
interesting in gym

25
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:57,808
when I have to run the mile.

26
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,102
Jenna, it would not kill you
to take a risk.

00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,979
Be bold once in a while.

28
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:03,980
My mother's perception
of being bold

29
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:04,982
was free-boobin'.

30
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:06,316
I'd had enough.

31
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:13,615
If you're not into the shirt,

32
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:15,734
at least take these so you look hip.

33
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:16,868
They're fake.

34
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:20,038
And they'll help you hide
your big unibrow.

35
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,746
I wanted an excuse
to walk in together.

36
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,849
But what I really needed
was an excuse to talk.

37
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,885
Matty said he wasn't ready to be
in a relationship with anyone.

38
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:52,320
But maybe he just didn't want
to be in a relationship with me.

39
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:55,365
And why would he?

40
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,618
I was the suicide girl.

and the back said "in tribute."

46
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:09,688
That's clearly about me, right?

47
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:11,590
As clear as the cold sore
on vera Herbert's face.

48
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,675
I'd say it's oozingly obvi.

I mean, crap
to the **** pile,

50
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,554
I saw a girl get out
of Matty's truck.

51
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,515
I mean, I think he's hooking up
with someone else.

52
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,059
You're like a daytime

What did I do to deserve
all this effed-up karma?

56

Okay, act totally normal
and don't look now,

00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:33,653
but up on the right, she's
the one in the bleachers.

00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,684
- The whore!
- Yes, but don't stare!

59
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,719
- Not looking.
- No idea who she is.

- Ah, cramp.
- Me either.

61
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,582

Yeah, but prettier.
And cooler.

63

She's Jenna plus.

64
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:52,714
No way.
She's Jenna minus!

65
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:54,966
You don't taste like ashtray,
and you put out.

66
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,676
She probably puts out too.

67
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,221
But she's older, so the sex
is super dirty.

68
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:00,972
What?

69
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:04,042

No wonder Matty wants to
keep his options open.

- Starved.

178
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,431
Uh...Jell-o?

179
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,425
Mmm. Hello.

180
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,186
Uh...

181
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,562
Your mouth is saying okay,
but your eyes are saying,

182
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,064
"save me from this lunatic."

183
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,265
Which I totally understand
because I'm rambling

184
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,399
and sounding like a whack job.

185
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:23,443
But just so you know,
I was having a bad day,

186
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,779
and I slipped-- I had an accident.

187
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,572
Normal people have accidents.

188
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,841
And that's exactly what I had
because I'm perfectly normal.

189
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:32,744
[Forced laugh]

190
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,829
Oh, what was I <i>saying?</i>

191
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,289
You're--
you're totally normal.

192
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:40,001
- Yes.
- I got it.

193
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,252
- I'll see ya.
- Okay.

194
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:44,923
Matty ditched me
to bring that chick a sandwich?

195
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,825
I fooled around with the guy
at least eight times,

196
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,053
and he never bought <i>me</i> a sandwich.

197
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,263
He just bought her a sandwich.
We have to follow them.

198
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,432
Who?

199
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:56,059
Your face is all red,
and you have crazy eyes.

200
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,394
Did you feed the rabid squirrels
in the quad?

201
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,671
Listen, those shirts
are spreading,

202
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:00,772
and I know Matty's seen them.

203
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,007
Did you see those people
wearing them?

204
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,399
I just need to find out
if they're together.

205
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,901
You're going
to a dark place, J.

206
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,511
Stay with us.

207
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,571
I just need concrete proof
that they're dating.

208
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,033
I knew it.

209
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,202
You're totally cashing in
on my faux suicide attempt.

210
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,454
That is illegal.
I could have you arrested!

211
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,655
You're stalking me.
Admit it.

212
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,124
I saw you at least
five times last period.

213
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm an office aid.

214
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,129
Mm. Yeah?
Take the damn shirt off--now.

215
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,380
You are ruining my life.

216
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,757
Those are mine.

217
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,135
- Take it off.
- No.

218
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,178
Take it... off.

219
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,179
- No.
- Fine.

220
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,390
I will.
Just stop it, okay?

221
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,766
People are getting the wrong idea.

222
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,810
They think I'm crazy, okay?
Just stop it!

223
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,520
Stop stalking me,
stop with these stupid T-shirts!

224
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,680
Just stop it!
Just stop it! Just stop it!

225
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,649
- Stop it!
- You're crazy.

226
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:56,242
Does this really
warrant detention?

227
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,676
If you were 18,

228
00:08:57,801 --> 00:08:59,812
it could warrant
some time in the slammer.

229
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:02,081
Sorry I couldn't give you
special treatment.

230
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:03,418
I mean, I could have,

231
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,784
but there were so many witnesses.

232
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:09,716
I see some new faces...

233
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,551
Mixed in with the old.

234
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,136
To the rookies--

235
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,760
we're on the honor system here.

236
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:17,263
Now, I'll be back to check on you,

237
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:19,434
but you won't know when.

238
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,269
So you best be on your best.

239
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,439
Like busy little worker bees--

240
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,732
zzz--

241
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,861
you will be working on your
homework honey pot,

242
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,277
and I will be in my office

243
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:33,823
attending to my piles

244
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,783
and piles of work.

245
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:39,162
Sometimes it feels like
I have detention too.

246
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,701
We have exactly two hours.

247
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,430
Starting now.
[Snaps]

248
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:02,227
Two hours for, uh, for what?

249
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,271
Valerie's nap.
We're heading to Giuseppe's.

250
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,046
Guess Jenna plus
was a regular in detention.

251
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,181
And the leader among the rebel herd.

252
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:12,403
Maybe Matty thought
being bad... was good.

253
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,156
Come on, newbie.

254
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,659
From the small bird tattoo
on her ankle

255
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,662
to the simple carmex she wore
instead of lip gloss,

256
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,373
everything about Jenna plus was cool.

257
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,208
Bitch.

258
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,210
So what are you in
detention for, wonder boy?

259
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,337
I was caught holding
the hose at the bonfire.

260
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,048
- Kinky.
- [Laughs] Yeah.

261
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,806
And your crime, Hamilton?

262
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,010
Oh, just a little...

263
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:40,223
[Ahem] Misunderstanding.

264
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,517
At lunch.
What are you in for?

265
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,394
I'm a detention
rewards card member.

266
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,851
Today I blew off history

267
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,897
'cause I was on the phone having
a meltdown with this guy.

268
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:49,355
Was she talking about Matty,

269
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,693
or was I having a paranoia stroke?

270
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,152
[Cell phone tune]

271
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,904
Speak of the devil.

272
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,585
What?

273
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,993
No!

274
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,536
What does that even mean?

275
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:05,070
Can I bum a smoke?

276
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:06,499
Sure.

277
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,440
I wondered
if Matty liked smokers.

278
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:10,712
And if so, could I fake a pro?

279
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:11,963
Okay, then why don't you
take your sweet ass time

280
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,506
to think about it and call me back?

281
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,219
[Coughs]

282
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:21,681
Everything okay?

283
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,141
Yeah. It's just my ex.

284
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,642
We've been on a break,

285
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,312
and we're in the process
of maybe getting back together.

286
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,161
Did that mean
I was Matty's rebound?

287
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:30,982
Breaks are hard.

288
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,775
Someone always hooks up
with another person,

289
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,066
maybe even falls for them.

290
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:35,486
Think he's into someone else?

291
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:39,271
I thought so.
But now I'm not so sure.

292
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:41,607
When we're together, it's...
It's amazing.

293
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:42,910
It's like...

294
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:45,621
The world falls away...
Then the next day,

295
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:47,479
he's indifferent, he doesn't call me.

296
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:49,314
He doesn't even want
to be seen with me.

297
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:50,501
So started to wonder

298
00:11:50,774 --> 00:11:52,962
if maybe I'm imagining
all the good stuff.

299
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:55,954
Jenna plus and I might have
been from different planets,

300
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,426
but her Matty heartbreak
was the same.

301
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,220
[Cell phone tune]

302
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,430
There it was.

303
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,016
The answer I was chasing.

304
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,366
I couldn't live in the safety
of denial anymore.

305
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:09,979
She was with Matty.
He was with her.

306
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,439
And I was with cancer.

307
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,373
I'm gonna let him sweat it
for a little while.

308
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,653
Thanks for listening.

309
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,197
Are you okay?

310
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,713
Whatever the misunderstanding
was today,

311
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:23,159
it'll blow over.

312
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,203
Nothing's ever as bad as it seems.

313
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,663
Here.

314
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,749
Take my last smoke.
I'm gonna grab another pack.

315
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,057
As much as I wanted
to hate on Jenna plus,

316
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,158
I couldn't.

317
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:34,193
The bitch was decent.

318
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,195
Maybe even sweet.

319
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,020
And it made me
really want to kill myself.

320
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,798
{pub}I didn't know
you were a smoker.

321

Well, I hear lung cancer
does make your ass look huge.

Well, I'm having a crappy day.

324
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,939
Everyone thinks
I tried to kill myself,

325
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,574
and there's a lame guy
selling T-shirts

326
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:55,817
keeping the stupid story alive.

327
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,236
I don't think
you tried to kill yourself.

328
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,779
- Really?
- No.

329
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,239
You're not the type.

330
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,117
Well, unless you keep smoking.

331
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,622
And there's a guy...

332
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,165
Oh. Mysterious.

333
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:12,500

but he has a girlfriend.

00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,835
Who is it?

335
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,211
I can't say.

336
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,421
Oh. So I'd know him.

337
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,047
No comment.

Aw, come on.

00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,736
Does this guy even know
that you like him?

340
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:25,012
I'd say it's pretty clear.

341
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:28,141
I mean...
He's funny and he's cool,

342
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,809
and everybody likes him,

343
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,344
which is part of the problem.

344
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:33,479
But I feel like I see
who he really is,

345
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:34,447
and he gets me.

346
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:36,232
Yeah.

00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,517
But we're not
on the same level,

348
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,619
and he can never be
with a freak like me, so...

349
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:40,945
It's kinda hopeless.

the situation,
