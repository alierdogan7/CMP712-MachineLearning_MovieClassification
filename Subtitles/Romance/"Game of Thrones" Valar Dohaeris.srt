1
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,053
Welcome, Lord Stark.

2
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:19,222
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

3
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,312
The honour of your presence is requested.

4
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:25,978
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

5
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,685
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.

6
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:32,322
If you'd like to change into something
more appropriate...

7
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,861
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

8
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:15,074
About time we had
some stern northern leadership.

9
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:17,995
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

10
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,079
Sturdy old thing.

11
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,533
How many kings' arses
have polished it, I wonder?

12
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,412
Um, what's the line?

13
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:27,795
The king shits and the Hand wipes.

14
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,128
Very handsome armour.

15
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:33,627
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

16
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:37,304
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

17
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:40,102
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

18
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,346
I have a knack for it.

19
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,610
It must be strange for you,
coming into this room.

20
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,866
I was standing right here
when it happened.

21
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:57,950
He was very brave, your brother.

22
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,870
Your father, too.

23
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:01,995
They didn't deserve to die like that.

24
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,912
Nobody deserves to die like that.

25
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,871
But you just stood there and watched.

26
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:09,917
500 men just stood there and watched.

27
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:12,667
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

28
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:15,127
You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?

29
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:17,764
No, Lord Stark.

30
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:21,967
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

31
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:27,225
Except for the screams, of course,

32
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:29,315
and the Mad King laughing.

33
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,021
And later...

34
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,693
when I watched the Mad King die,

35
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:38,109
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

36
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,120
It felt like justice.

37
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,746
Is that what you tell yourself at night?

38
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:50,667
You're a servant of justice?

39
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:55,259
That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

40
00:04:55,386 --> 00:05:00,131
Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly
instead of the back,

41
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,009
would you admire me more?

42
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:07,188
You served him well...
when serving was safe.

43
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:22,367
Lord Stark.

44
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,291
Lord Varys.

45
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:30,118
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles
on the Kingsroad.

46
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:33,878
We are all praying
for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

47
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:37,211
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

48
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:41,632
Renly! You're looking well.

49
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,426
And you look tired from the road.

50
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,766
I told them this meeting could wait
another day, but...

51
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,564
But we have a kingdom
to look after.

52
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,765
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

53
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:55,352
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

54
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,489
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

55
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:01,783
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem...

56
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,785
from navel to collarbone.

57
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:05,952
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

58
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:07,873
It wasn't the man that I chose, my lord.

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,289
It was Catelyn Tully.

60
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,623
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

61
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:16,329
I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

62
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:18,963
Grand Maester.

63
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,337
How many years has it been?

64
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,930
- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.

65
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:29,480
Oh, how forgetful of me.

66
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:33,307
This belongs to you now.

67
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:37,778
Should we begin?

68
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,822
- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,

69
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,200
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

70
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,363
His Grace has many cares.

71
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:51,117
He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.

72
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:54,045
We are the lords of small matters here.

73
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:02,006
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

74
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,510
in honour of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

75
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,175
- Mm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

76
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:09,847
20,000 to the runner-up,

77
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,015
20,000 to the winning archer.

78
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,438
Can the treasury bear such expense?

79
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:18,397
I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters
will accommodate, I expect.

80
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,696
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,000?

81
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:23,568
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

82
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:27,533
- I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?

83
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:31,785
The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.

84
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,417
I will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

85
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:38,333
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,

86
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:42,173
but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.

87
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:44,759
"Counting coppers," he calls it.

88
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,679
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

89
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:50,015
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.

90
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:52,552
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

91
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:55,564
There will be no plans...
until I speak to Robert.

92
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,611
Forgive me, my lords. I'm...

93
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:07,111
- I had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

94
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:09,700
We serve at your pleasure.

95
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:18,794
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

96
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:24,753
- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.

97
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:28,594
You fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

98
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:32,389
I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.

99
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,137
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

100
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:38,273
That's not true. You killed the beast.

101
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:41,567
You only spared the girl because of the love
your father bears her father.

102
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:43,024
I didn't, I...

103
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:47,817
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.

104
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,493
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

105
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,078
Do I have to marry her?

106
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:00,001
Yes.

107
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,289
She's very beautiful and young.

108
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:05,628
If you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

109
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:10,091
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

110
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,145
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

111
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:17,809
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins,
so be it.

112
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,068
You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.

113
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:27,979
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

114
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:29,908
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

115
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:34,868
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

116
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:37,490
We allow the northerners too much power.

117
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,999
They consider themselves our equals.

118
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:41,671
How would you handle them?

119
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:47,419
I'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.

120
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,751
A royal army?

121
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,679
Why should every lord
command his own men?

122
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,971
It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.

123
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,143
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

124
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,930
trained by experienced soldiers,

125
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,646
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

126
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,110
And if the northerners rebel?

127
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,814
I'd crush them.

128
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:10,075
Seize Winterfell and install someone
loyal to the realm as warden of the North.

129
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,534
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

130
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:15,326
And these 10,000 northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

131
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:17,614
- For me. I'm their king.
- Mm-hm.

132
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,707
But you've just invaded their homeland,

133
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,547
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

134
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:25,589
The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.

135
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:27,709
It's too big and too wild.

136
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:29,379
And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together

137
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:31,635
couldn't save you and your royal army.

138
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,599
A good king knows
when to save his strength...

139
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:38,599
and when to destroy his enemies.

140
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:41,308
So you agree...

141
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,685
the Starks are enemies?

142
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:49,522
Everyone who isn't us...
is an enemy.

143
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,277
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

144
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:57,370
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

145
00:10:57,498 --> 00:10:59,407
- The prince.
- Arya, stop!

146
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,662
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

147
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,076
The Hound killed your friend.

148
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,621
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

149
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:09,083
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,

150
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:10,381
Mycah would be alive.

151
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:11,886
Enough!

152
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:16,181
What's happening here?

153
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,515
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

154
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,561
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

155
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:32,108
That's for you, love.

156
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:45,287
The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

157
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,751
Don't you like it?

158
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:52,427
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.

159
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:56,971
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

160
00:11:57,808 --> 00:12:00,216
It's all right. Go on.

161
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,521
War was easier than daughters.

162
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:18,652
Go away!

163
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:21,243
Arya, open the door.

164
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,465
May I come in?

165
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,680
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

166
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:44,472
Give it to me.

167
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,024
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

168
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:57,992
Where did you get this?

169
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,156
This is no toy.

170
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,004
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

171
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,039
And I don't want to be a lady.

172
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:13,377
Come here.

173
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,924
Now what do you want with this?

174
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:23,384
It's called Needle.

175
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,559
Oh, a blade with a name.

176
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:29,228
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

177
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,309
Your sister?

178
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,686
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

179
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,571
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

180
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,485
That's the essence of it.

181
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:43,489
I was trying to learn.

182
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,992
I asked Mycah to practice with me.

183
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:53,587
I asked him. It was my fault.

184
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:58,880
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

185
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:03,422
I hate them. I hate all of them.

186
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,801
The Hound, the queen and the king

187
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,472
and Joffrey and Sansa.

188
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:10,226
Sansa was dragged
before the king and queen...

189
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,855
and asked to call the prince a liar.

190
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:16,483
So was I! He is a liar.

191
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:18,607
Shh, darling, listen to me.

192
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,733
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey someday.

193
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,488
She cannot betray him.

194
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:28,244
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

195
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,211
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

196
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:36,006
Well...

197
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,132
Look at me.

198
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:43,382
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

199
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,014
Winter is coming.

200
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:52,180
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.

201
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,643
But now winter is truly coming.

202
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:58,727
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

203
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,193
look after one another.

204
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:02,613
Sansa is your sister.

205
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:06,071
I don't hate her.

206
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:08,111
Not really.

207
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:13,284
I don't want to frighten you,
but I won't lie to you either.

208
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:15,828
We've come to a dangerous place.

209
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,290
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.

210
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,295
All right?

211
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:25,636
Go on. It's yours.

212
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:30,812
I can keep it?

213
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:33,854
Try not to stab your sister with it.

214
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:46,739
If you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.

215
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:58,252
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.

216
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:04,376
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

217
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,598
I know a story about a boy who hated stories.

218
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:11,312
I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.

219
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:13,305
Those were always your favourites.

220
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:15,686
Those weren't my favourites.

221
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,314
My favourites were the scary ones.

222
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:23,907
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

223
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:27,235
Fear is for the winter,

224
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,573
when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.

225
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:35,119
Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years

226
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:40,211
and children are born and live and die,
all in darkness.

227
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,963
That is the time for fear, my little lord,

228
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:47,261
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

229
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:53,967
Thousands of years ago there came a night
that lasted a generation.

230
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,940
Kings froze to death in their castles,

231
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,189
same as the shepherds in their huts.

232
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,027
And women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve,

233
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:08,450
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

234
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:12,081
So is this the sort of story that you like?

235
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:19,831
In that darkness, the white walkers
came for the first time.

236
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,960
They swept through cities and kingdoms,

237
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,168
riding their dead horses,

238
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:29,087
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as hounds...

239
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:35,471
What are you telling him now?

240
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:37,888
Only what the little lord wants to hear.

241
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,603
Get your supper. I want some time with him.

242
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:53,535
One time she told me

243
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:55,829
the sky is blue
because we live inside the eye

244
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,710
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

245
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:00,912
Maybe we do.

246
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:05,417
How do you feel?

247
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,131
You still don't remember anything?

248
00:18:13,184 --> 00:18:17,312
Bran, I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

249
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:19,229
In the wind, in the rain...

250
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,396
A thousand times.

251
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:23,732
- You never fall.
- I did though.

252
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:28,987
It's true, isn't it,

253
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:32,361
what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

254
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:41,783
I'd rather be dead.

255
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,340
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

256
00:18:58,062 --> 00:19:00,600
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.

257
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:02,771
But still too many.

258
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:05,432
It's nine years since I've set foot
in the capital.

259
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,773
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came, either.

260
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,865
My lady.

261
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,121
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

262
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,034
I would. We've done nothing wrong.

263
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,326
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

264
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,169
Instructed?

265
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:26,912
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

266
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,668
Follow me, Lady Stark.

267
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,802
Cat!

268
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:44,188
Go on. Go upstairs.

269
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:49,101
You little worm!

270
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:53,402
You take me for some back-alley Sally
you can drag into a...

271
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:56,905
Pssst!

272
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,417
I meant no disrespect,
to you of all people.

273
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:07,494
How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?

274
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:10,087
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

275
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,711
I'm truly sorry... about the locale.

276
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,088
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

277
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,140
A dear friend told me.

278
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:23,730
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

279
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:27,806
To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.

280
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,272
Your poor hands.

281
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,365
How did you know I was coming?

282
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,858
Knowledge is my trade, my lady.

283
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:40,153
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

284
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:44,121
My little birds are everywhere...

285
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,368
even in the North.

286
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,961
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

287
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,380
Valyrian steel.

288
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,261
Do you know whose dagger this is?

289
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:03,927
I must admit I do not.

290
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:07,520
Well, well, this is an historic day.

291
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,853
Something you don't know that I do.

292
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:18,072
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

293
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:22,153
- It's mine.
- Yours?

294
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,501
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

295
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,496
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,

296
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:31,380
as any sane man would.

297
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:36,465
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him,
I lost this dagger.

298
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:38,713
To whom?

299
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:40,722
Tyrion Lannister.

300
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,056
The Imp.

301
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:45,759
Grenn, show him
what you farm boys are made of.

302
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:54,022
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

303
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:59,778
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle
spitting down on the likes of you.

304
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:01,823
Pyp.

305
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,904
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?

306
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,877
Next!

307
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:28,096
Next!

308
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:45,412
Well, Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.

309
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:47,655
Go clean yourselves up!

310
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,538
There's only so much
I can stomach in a day.

311
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:53,036
A charming man.

312
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,631
I don't need him to be charming.

313
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,801
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

314
00:22:58,928 --> 00:23:00,339
into men of the Night's Watch.

315
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:03,808
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

316
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,427
Slowly.

317
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,973
A raven came... for Ned Stark's son.

318
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,359
Good news or bad?

319
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:19,066
Both.

320
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:23,658
Lord Stark.

321
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:26,579
I meant...
to give you this earlier.

322
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,867
So forgetful these days.

323
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:35,500
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

324
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:48,425
Good news?

325
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,390
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.

326
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,525
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

327
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:09,864
Yes, I'm looking at you.

328
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:15,202
I thought that she'd be safest in here.

329
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:18,089
One of several such
establishments I own.

330
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:21,920
You're a funny man.

331
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:24,425
Huh? A very funny man.

332
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:27,931
Ned!

333
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,440
Ah, the Starks...

334
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:39,402
Quick tempers, slow minds.

335
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:47,113
You broke my nose, bastard!

336
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:56,499
It's an improvement.

337
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:02,592
If we threw you over the Wall,
I wonder how long it would take you to hit.

338
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,960
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

339
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:11,760
What are you looking at, halfman?

340
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:14,432
I'm looking at you.

341
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:19,686
Yes. You've got an interesting face.

342
00:25:20,778 --> 00:25:23,862
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

343
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,567
All of you.

344
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,823
And what do you care about our faces?

345
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:29,695
It's just...

346
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:33,779
I think they would look marvellous
decorating spikes in King's Landing.

347
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:36,834
Perhaps I'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.

348
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:41,420
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

349
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:51,676
Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.

350
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,138
No one but you.

351
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:57,810
My father knew and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

352
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,016
Grenn's father left him too...

353
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:03,271
outside a farmhouse, when he was three.

354
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:07,358
Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.

355
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:10,742
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.

356
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,535
He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.

357
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:18,533
I've been asking the Lord Commander
about them. Fascinating stories.

358
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:20,543
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

359
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:25,049
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.

360
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:27,631
I don't imagine any of them
had ever held a real sword

361
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:29,754
before they came here.

362
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,016
Oh...

363
00:26:35,144 --> 00:26:37,184
Your brother Bran.

364
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:40,347
He's woken up.

365
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,735
The mere suggestion that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy

366
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:46,060
would be considered treason.

367
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:48,403
We have proof. We have the blade.

368
00:26:48,532 --> 00:26:50,525
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

369
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,115
The only man who could say otherwise
has no throat,

370
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:54,491
thanks to your boy's wolf.

371
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:58,375
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

372
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:03,837
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.

373
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:06,420
I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.

374
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:08,258
A fool's task, admittedly,

375
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:10,924
but I've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.

376
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:13,095
I won't forget this.

377
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:15,263
You're a true friend.

378
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:18,512
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

379
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:25,183
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

380
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,063
He's a child. Ten years old.

381
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:29,521
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

382
00:27:29,657 --> 00:27:32,113
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

383
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:36,027
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing. He remembers nothing.

384
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:38,203
Then what are you raving about?

385
00:27:38,332 --> 00:27:41,748
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw...

386
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:44,119
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

387
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:48,087
We'll say whatever we like.
I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.

388
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:51,302
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

389
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:54,050
They can write a ballad about us -

390
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:55,841
"The War For Cersei's Cunt."

391
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,390
- Let me go.
- Never.

392
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:07,273
- Let me go.
- The boy won't talk.

393
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:10,360
And if he does, I'll kill him.

394
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:13,823
Him, Ned Stark, the king -
the whole bloody lot of them,

395
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:18,412
until you and I are the only people
left in this world.

396
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,376
I wish I could see the girls.

397
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,714
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

398
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:36,964
Until we know who our enemies are.

399
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,175
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

400
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,184
In my bones, I know it.

401
00:28:41,312 --> 00:28:43,186
Littlefinger's right.

402
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:47,099
I can't do anything without proof.

403
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:49,772
And if you find the proof?

404
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,902
Then I bring it to Robert...

405
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,700
and hope he's still the man I once knew.

406
00:28:56,661 --> 00:28:58,618
You watch yourself on the road, huh?

407
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:02,036
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

408
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,660
My temper?

409
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:07,666
Gods be good, you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.

410
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,295
He still loves you.

411
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:17,221
Does he?

412
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:36,442
Off with you.

413
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:11,811
Yes, it's been a long time.

414
00:30:12,904 --> 00:30:15,441
But I still remember every face.

415
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:19,150
You remember your first?

416
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:23,697
Of course, Your Grace.

417
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:25,788
Who was it?

418
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,494
A Tyroshi.

419
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,333
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

420
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:32,668
How did you do it?

421
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,708
Lance through the heart.

422
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:36,550
Quick one.

423
00:30:38,054 --> 00:30:40,296
Lucky for you.

424
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:44,180
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

425
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:50,266
My horse took an arrow so I was on foot,
slogging through the mud.

426
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:56,858
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

427
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:01,651
thinking he could end the rebellion
with a single swing of his sword.

428
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,037
I knocked him down with the hammer.

429
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:07,495
Gods, I was strong then.

430
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:10,330
Caved in his breastplate.

431
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:13,747
Probably shattered every rib he had.

432
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:17,466
Stood over him, hammer in the air.

433
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:23,641
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait! Wait."

434
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:32,931
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

435
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:37,356
They don't put that part in the songs.

436
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,366
Stupid boy.

437
00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:48,661
Now the Tarlys bend the knee
like everyone else.

438
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:53,418
He could have lingered on the edge
of the battle with the smart boys,

439
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:57,087
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

440
00:31:57,258 --> 00:32:00,093
his sons would be ingrates,

441
00:32:00,261 --> 00:32:04,674
and he'd be waking three times in the night
to piss into a bowl.

442
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:06,551
Wine!

443
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:13,683
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

444
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:17,350
Lancel Lannister.

445
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:22,574
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

446
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:27,696
What are you doing?

447
00:32:29,123 --> 00:32:31,744
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean, it's empty?

448
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:34,663
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?!

449
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:38,956
So get more.

450
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:45,217
Tell your cousin to get in here.

451
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:48,426
Kingslayer! Get in here.

452
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:59,103
Surrounded by Lannisters.

453
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:02,937
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

454
00:33:03,074 --> 00:33:06,443
and their smug, satisfied faces.

455
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,493
It must wound your pride, huh?

456
00:33:09,622 --> 00:33:12,457
Standing out there like a glorified sentry.

457
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,744
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...

458
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:24,464
forced to mind the door while your king
eats and drinks and shits and fucks.

459
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:27,966
So come on.

460
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,056
We're telling war stories.

461
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,928
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

462
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,812
One of the outlaws
in the brotherhood.

463
00:33:38,943 --> 00:33:41,434
I was there that day.

464
00:33:41,612 --> 00:33:44,649
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

465
00:33:44,782 --> 00:33:47,617
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

466
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:49,819
Best move I ever saw.

467
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:54,201
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

468
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,456
Your outlaw...

469
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,004
any last words?

470
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,835
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmm.

471
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:04,837
What about Aerys Targaryen?

472
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:08,753
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

473
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:10,971
I never asked.

474
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:13,931
Did he call you a traitor?

475
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:17,062
Did he plead for a reprieve?

476
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:21,608
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

477
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:25,444
"Burn them all."

478
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:32,154
If that's all, Your Grace...

479
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,942
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

480
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:09,071
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

481
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,406
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

482
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:12,946
From whom?

483
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,613
If you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -

484
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,534
pay tribute or fight.

485
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:20,376
An easy choice for most.

486
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:23,871
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

487
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:27,375
Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

488
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:29,924
He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.

489
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:33,803
Sometimes a khal decides
his riders haven't had a good fight in months

490
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:36,887
and need the practice.

491
00:35:40,106 --> 00:35:41,933
Tell them all to stop.

492
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:45,150
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?

493
00:35:46,737 --> 00:35:49,063
Until I command them otherwise.

494
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:51,946
You're learning to talk like a queen.

495
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:53,985
Not a queen.

496
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,947
A khaleesi.

497
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,990
You dare!

498
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,369
You give commands to me? To me?

499
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:43,998
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

500
00:36:44,128 --> 00:36:48,837
I don't take orders from savages
or their sluts. Do you hear me?

501
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,885
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

502
00:36:57,058 --> 00:36:58,516
No.

503
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:04,601
Rakharo say you should take ear,
to teach respect.

504
00:37:04,732 --> 00:37:07,305
Please. Please, don't hurt him.

505
00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:15,231
Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.

506
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,367
Huh?

507
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:31,505
Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!

508
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:39,552
I am your king!

509
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:43,680
Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?

510
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,996
Uh uh uh uh uh.

511
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,994
You... walk.

512
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:43,651
I wanted to be here
when you saw it for the first time.

513
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:55,121
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

514
00:40:56,214 --> 00:40:58,372
I'm the First Ranger.

515
00:40:58,507 --> 00:41:00,880
My job is out there.

516
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,130
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

517
00:41:04,222 --> 00:41:06,095
The kind I don't want to believe.

518
00:41:07,808 --> 00:41:10,216
I'm ready. I won't let you down.

519
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:12,771
You're not going.

520
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:17,018
You're no ranger, Jon.

521
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:19,772
- But I'm better than every...
- Better than no one!

522
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:26,825
Here...

523
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:29,159
a man gets what he earns,

524
00:41:29,288 --> 00:41:31,328
when he earns it.

525
00:41:35,378 --> 00:41:37,454
We'll speak when I return.

526
00:41:53,187 --> 00:41:56,188
- A bear's balls.
-  Oh, you're joking?

527
00:41:56,315 --> 00:41:59,684
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart,

528
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,352
all fried in his own fat.

529
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:05,020
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

530
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:08,609
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

531
00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:11,819
And how do a bear's balls taste?

532
00:42:11,956 --> 00:42:14,162
A bit chewy.

533
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:20,457
And what about you, my lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

534
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,214
Do Dornish girls count?

535
00:42:26,262 --> 00:42:31,505
So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
collaring pickpockets and horse thieves

536
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:33,635
and bring them here as eager recruits?

537
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:35,477
Aye.

538
00:42:35,563 --> 00:42:38,517
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.

539
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:41,520
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

540
00:42:41,652 --> 00:42:44,523
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

541
00:42:44,614 --> 00:42:46,737
They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.

542
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,533
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?

543
00:42:52,663 --> 00:42:56,875
Is that what we are, Lannister?
An army of jesters in black?

544
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:59,082
You don't have enough men
to be an army

545
00:42:59,212 --> 00:43:02,794
and, aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

546
00:43:02,965 --> 00:43:05,587
I hope we've provided you
with some good stories to tell

547
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:07,468
when you're back in King's Landing.

548
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:11,178
It's something to think about
while you're drinking your wine down there,

549
00:43:11,307 --> 00:43:13,300
enjoying your brothels.

550
00:43:14,393 --> 00:43:17,679
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

551
00:43:18,564 --> 00:43:21,020
Might be a wildling's axe that gets them,

552
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,724
might be sickness,

553
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:26,566
might just be the cold.

554
00:43:26,697 --> 00:43:28,441
They die in pain.

555
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,111
And they do it...

556
00:43:31,244 --> 00:43:36,368
so plump little lords like you can enjoy their
summer afternoons in peace and comfort.

557
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,953
Do you think I'm plump?

558
00:43:44,257 --> 00:43:47,875
- Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
- Call me what you like.

559
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,299
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.

560
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:52,469
I have great admiration for the Night's Watch.

561
00:43:52,598 --> 00:43:55,006
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

562
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:57,141
You know, my brother once told me...

563
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:01,766
that nothing someone says
before the word "but" really counts.

564
00:44:01,857 --> 00:44:03,517
But...

565
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:07,563
I don't believe that giants and ghouls
and white walkers

566
00:44:07,697 --> 00:44:09,488
are lurking beyond the Wall.

567
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:13,658
I believe that the only difference
between us and the wildlings

568
00:44:13,786 --> 00:44:16,491
is that when that wall went up,
our ancestors happened

569
00:44:16,622 --> 00:44:18,698
to live on the right side of it.

570
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:20,624
You're right.

571
00:44:22,378 --> 00:44:24,454
The wildlings are no different from us.

572
00:44:25,423 --> 00:44:27,332
A little rougher maybe.

573
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:30,088
But they're made of meat and bone.

574
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:32,799
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

575
00:44:33,514 --> 00:44:36,634
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

576
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:42,354
You've never been north of the Wall,
so don't tell me what's out there.

577
00:44:45,943 --> 00:44:47,900
Are you going below?

578
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,780
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

579
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:54,616
Oh, I always do.

580
00:45:03,836 --> 00:45:05,995
I think he's starting to like me.

581
00:45:08,841 --> 00:45:12,127
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

582
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:16,051
Into the tunnel and out the other side.

583
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,761
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

584
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,056
So... you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

585
00:45:24,148 --> 00:45:26,722
Aye, day after tomorrow.

586
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:30,560
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

587
00:45:30,696 --> 00:45:34,824
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

588
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:37,074
I, er...

589
00:45:37,161 --> 00:45:39,913
I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.

590
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:43,906
Not this time. We'll be staying
at the finest castles and inns.

591
00:45:44,043 --> 00:45:46,415
No one turns away a Lannister.

592
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:04,228
Yes, Khaleesi.

593
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:08,230
Oh, what are you doing?

594
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:10,897
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?

595
00:46:13,364 --> 00:46:15,321
You change, Khaleesi.

596
00:46:16,784 --> 00:46:19,156
It's a blessing from the Great Stallion

597
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:28,581
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade is a good thing,

598
00:46:28,713 --> 00:46:30,373
easier to handle.

599
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:33,383
It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.

600
00:46:34,594 --> 00:46:38,722
But a man in full plate...

601
00:46:38,848 --> 00:46:40,924
...the arakh won't get through the steel.

602
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:44,259
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

603
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:47,271
Designed for piercing plate.

604
00:46:48,941 --> 00:46:51,693
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.

605
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:54,737
- Armour.
-  Armour.

606
00:46:54,864 --> 00:46:57,437
Armour make a man, erm...

607
00:46:57,617 --> 00:46:59,574
Slow.

608
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:03,285
- Slow.
- It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.

609
00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:07,418
My father taught me how to fight.

610
00:47:07,543 --> 00:47:10,959
He taught me that speed defeats size.

611
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:13,840
I've heard that
your father was a famous warrior.

612
00:47:13,966 --> 00:47:16,291
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.

613
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:22,755
And your father, Jorah the Andal?
He was a warrior also?

614
00:47:22,892 --> 00:47:25,299
He still is.

615
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:27,808
A man of great honour

616
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:29,765
and I betrayed him.

617
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,979
The Khaleesi wants
to eat something different tonight.

618
00:47:37,114 --> 00:47:39,107
Kill some rabbits.

619
00:47:39,242 --> 00:47:41,281
There are no rabbits.

620
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,111
Find some ducks, she likes ducks.

621
00:47:45,248 --> 00:47:48,699
Have you seen any ducks, woman?
No rabbits, no ducks.

622
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:51,160
Do you have eyes in your head?
Do you?

623
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,371
Dog then.
I have seen many dogs.

624
00:47:53,506 --> 00:47:55,831
I don't think she wants to eat dog.

625
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:01,883
The khaleesi have baby inside her.

626
00:48:03,558 --> 00:48:06,761
It is true. She does not bleed
for two moons.

627
00:48:06,894 --> 00:48:09,219
Her belly start to swell.

628
00:48:11,023 --> 00:48:13,395
A blessing from the Great Stallion.

629
00:48:13,526 --> 00:48:15,518
She does not want to eat horse.

630
00:48:16,612 --> 00:48:19,364
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

631
00:48:24,662 --> 00:48:27,200
I need to ride to Qohor.

632
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:34,165
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

633
00:48:34,297 --> 00:48:36,503
Don't worry. I'll catch you.

634
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:39,004
The horde's easy to find.

635
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:54,892
Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit a moving target.

636
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:01,984
Except for you. You move too much.

637
00:49:02,116 --> 00:49:04,654
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

638
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:13,244
How many winters
have you seen, Lord Tyrion?

639
00:49:13,377 --> 00:49:15,584
Eight. No, nine.

640
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:18,128
All of them brief?

641
00:49:18,257 --> 00:49:21,294
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.

642
00:49:21,427 --> 00:49:24,463
This summer has lasted nine.

643
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:28,808
But reports from the citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

644
00:49:28,893 --> 00:49:31,265
The Starks are always right eventually -

645
00:49:31,395 --> 00:49:33,803
winter is coming.

646
00:49:34,774 --> 00:49:36,766
This one will be long...

647
00:49:37,693 --> 00:49:39,816
and dark things will come with it.

648
00:49:39,904 --> 00:49:44,530
We've been capturing wildlings,
more every month.

649
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:45,939
They're fleeing south.

650
00:49:46,118 --> 00:49:50,199
The ones who flee...
say they've seen the white walkers.

651
00:49:50,331 --> 00:49:53,581
Yes, and the fishermen
of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

652
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:57,161
One of our own rangers swore he saw them
kill his companions.

653
00:49:57,296 --> 00:50:01,294
He swore it right up to the moment
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

654
00:50:01,425 --> 00:50:05,838
The Night's Watch is the only thing
standing between the realm

655
00:50:05,972 --> 00:50:08,344
and what lies beyond.

656
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:14,014
And it has become an army
of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

657
00:50:14,188 --> 00:50:16,762
There are less than a thousand of us now.

658
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:20,610
We can't man the other castles on the Wall.

659
00:50:20,778 --> 00:50:23,696
We can't properly patrol the wilderness.

660
00:50:23,864 --> 00:50:28,194
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.

661
00:50:28,327 --> 00:50:32,242
Your sister sits by the side of the king.

662
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:36,586
Tell her... we need help.

663
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:41,503
When winter does come,
gods help us all if we're not ready.

664
00:51:04,196 --> 00:51:05,856
It's a boy.

665
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:12,611
How do you know?

666
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:16,992
I know.

667
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:50,696
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

668
00:51:52,578 --> 00:51:54,535
It's either me or this cold,

669
00:51:54,664 --> 00:51:56,905
and it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

670
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,793
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

671
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:01,117
I expect I will.

672
00:52:01,254 --> 00:52:05,382
Gods know there aren't many feather beds
between here and King's Landing.

673
00:52:05,508 --> 00:52:07,500
If you see my brother Bran,

674
00:52:07,635 --> 00:52:10,256
tell him I miss him.

675
00:52:11,097 --> 00:52:12,508
Tell him I'd visit if I could.

676
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,885
Of course.

677
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:16,434
He'll never walk again.

678
00:52:16,561 --> 00:52:20,345
If you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.

679
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:22,853
You take care, Snow.

680
00:52:22,984 --> 00:52:24,810
Farewell, my lord.

681
00:52:36,747 --> 00:52:39,120
You are late, boy.

682
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,499
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

683
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:45,871
Who are you?

684
00:52:46,632 --> 00:52:49,799
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

685
00:52:54,098 --> 00:52:55,557
Tomorrow you will catch it.

686
00:52:55,683 --> 00:52:57,474
Now pick it up.

687
00:52:59,937 --> 00:53:02,226
That is not the way, boy.

688
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:06,436
It is not a greatsword that is needing
two hands to swing it.

689
00:53:06,611 --> 00:53:10,525
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

690
00:53:10,656 --> 00:53:12,400
to make you strong.

691
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:14,909
Just so.

692
00:53:15,036 --> 00:53:17,324
One hand is all that is needed.

693
00:53:18,706 --> 00:53:20,699
Now you are standing all wrong.

694
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,158
Turn your body sideface.

695
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:25,536
Yes.

696
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:27,878
So.

697
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:30,296
You are skinny. That is good.

698
00:53:31,093 --> 00:53:33,216
The target is smaller.

699
00:53:33,346 --> 00:53:35,422
Now the grip - let me see.

700
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:38,177
Yes.

701
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:40,930
The grip must be delicate.

702
00:53:42,021 --> 00:53:43,848
What if I drop it?

703
00:53:43,981 --> 00:53:46,307
The steel must be part of your arm.

704
00:53:46,442 --> 00:53:49,063
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

705
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:53,239
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

706
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:56,070
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

707
00:53:56,202 --> 00:53:57,910
I'm a girl.

708
00:53:58,037 --> 00:54:03,411
Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.

709
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:06,877
That is the grip.

710
00:54:07,004 --> 00:54:09,958
You are not holding a battle-axe.
You are holding...

711
00:54:10,091 --> 00:54:11,419
A needle.

712
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:14,172
Ahhh.

713
00:54:15,054 --> 00:54:16,762
Just so.

714
00:54:16,847 --> 00:54:19,599
Now we will begin the dance.

715
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:21,142
Remember, child,

716
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:24,104
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning...

717
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:28,014
The knight's dance,
hacking and hammering.

718
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:31,860
This is the Braavos dance...

719
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:35,279
the water dance.

720
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:37,566
It is swift...

721
00:54:37,702 --> 00:54:39,908
and sudden.

722
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:43,572
All men are made of water.

723
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:45,416
Do you know this?

724
00:54:45,543 --> 00:54:47,832
If you pierce them,

725
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,538
the water leaks out and they die.

726
00:54:52,884 --> 00:54:56,050
Now you will try to strike me.

727
00:54:59,181 --> 00:55:00,973
Ha!

728
00:55:12,737 --> 00:55:14,112
Up!

729
00:55:17,617 --> 00:55:18,612
Ha!

730
00:55:30,004 --> 00:55:31,202
Ah.

731
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:35,300
Dead.

732
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:36,375
Oh!

733
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,135
Dead.

734
00:55:38,262 --> 00:55:40,089
Hup!

735
00:55:42,683 --> 00:55:44,676
Very dead.

736
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,602
Come.

737
00:55:47,313 --> 00:55:49,352
Ah ah ah!

738
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:52,233
Hup!

739
00:55:52,944 --> 00:55:54,817
Again, faster.

740
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:01,192
Ah.
