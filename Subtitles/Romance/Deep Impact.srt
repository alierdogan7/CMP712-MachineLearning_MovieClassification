00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:08,487
Nobody else could answer it.

183
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:10,485
I picked it up once.

184
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:13,372
Said hello,
and it's nobody home.

185
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,206
It rings, he shuts the door.

186
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:17,888
Why not hang a sign?

187
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:19,373
Do you have a name?

188
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:21,206
This is what I get

189
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:22,773
for talking to the press.

190
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,731
I'm selling my soul
right now.

191
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,374
I can feel it.
I can feel it.

192
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,127
I name a name and get
someone into trouble.

193
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,169
So you do have a name.

194
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,926
Just a first name.

195
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:34,493
Oh, my God.
I'm going to say it.

196
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:36,246
Ellie.

197
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,928
Ellie. Nothing else?

198
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:42,528
I think the president
knows about it, too.

199
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,765
Overheard the secretary
talking to him about her.

200
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:47,287
Isn't Washington sick?

201
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:28,565
Hi.

202
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:30,610
How you doing?

203
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:31,604
Can I help you?

204
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:32,729
Well, actually,

205
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:34,532
we're looking
for your mom.

206
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:35,729
Is she around?

207
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:38,567
My mom's sick.
She's not here.

208
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:41,771
Gosh, I love boats.
Are you going on a trip?

209
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:43,287
Yeah.

210
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:48,494
That's exciting. Looks
like a long trip, huh?

211
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:51,247
So, listen, do you know
where you're going?

212
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,165
Rittenhouse: She's going
back to the house.

213
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:55,893
Hey, you want to stop that?

214
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,169
Lily, please.

215
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,164
Lily, that's a pretty name.

216
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:01,690
Lily.

217
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:04,413
Do as I say.
Go on.

218
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:06,769
If we could just get
a minute of your time.

219
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,048
What do you want from me?

220
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,694
We'd like to talk
about your resignation.

221
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:13,129
My wife is sick.
She's in the hospital.

222
00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:15,774
That's why I resigned.
Everybody knows this.

223
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:16,923
We could talk
about your wife,

224
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,606
or we could just
talk about Ellie.

225
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:33,006
Turn the camera off.

226
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:36,848
If you want to talk to me,
turn it off.

227
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:40,407
We know everything.

228
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:41,688
Nobody knows everything.

229
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:45,323
Well, we know about
the secret phone lines

230
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:47,644
and the whispered calls
to the president

231
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,645
and about a secretary
of the Treasury

232
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:52,123
who's kept his entire
department in the dark

233
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:53,613
about what
he's really doing...

234
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:56,254
about a cover story
about his resignation

235
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:57,449
that just fell through.

236
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:58,853
You want me to go on?

237
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:02,210
And you're
just gonna break it?

238
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:04,683
Well, that's what we do
for a living.

239
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:07,572
Well, congratulations.

240
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:09,565
You now have
the biggest story in history.

241
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:11,292
Good luck to you.

242
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:12,523
Personally...

243
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,570
I think it's a mistake
to run the story,

244
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,246
but hey, what the hell?

245
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,847
Why not?

246
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:21,893
What difference
does anything make any more?

247
00:14:27,654 --> 00:14:29,372
Look.

248
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,570
I know you're just a reporter,

249
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:35,932
but you used to be
a person, right?

250
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:43,123
I wanted to be with my family.

251
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:47,491
Can you understand that?

252
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:10,447
OK, Secretary of the Treasury
Alan Rittenhouse

253
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,521
resigns because of a mistress
named Ellie.

254
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,122
The biggest story
in history?

255
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:18,326
What an ego.

256
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:20,604
Now, if it was
the president...

257
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:22,042
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

258
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,802
The president
has a mistress named Ellie,

259
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,686
and Rittenhouse pretends
that he's having the affair

260
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,327
and takes the fall and resigns,

261
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:31,481
and the president
buys him a yacht?

262
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:32,479
[Thump]

263
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,082
Son of a bitch.

264
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,360
Oh, shit.

265
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:43,883
Oh, shit.

266
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:47,405
Right! OK, OK!

267
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,717
Oh, God. Oh, God.

268
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,239
FBI. If you would,
please, ma'am.

269
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:12,444
What do I do
with my car?

270
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:13,405
We'll take care
of your car.

271
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:14,365
Just step back
to my car.

272
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:15,677
Get her car here.

273
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:23,844
Let's go.

274
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,682
[Tyres Screech]

275
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,362
Would you
come this way please?

276
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:54,039
Morton Entrekin, Ms Lerner.

277
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,843
I'm expected
back at MSNBC at 6:00.

278
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,443
I think
I should be there.

279
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:03,202
People knew about the Manhattan
Project, you know,

280
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,007
and they kept it a secret.

281
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:08,968
That was just the creation
of the atom bomb.

282
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,205
Hmm.

283
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:24,717
[Door Opens]

284
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:38,164
Ms Lerner, Tom Beck.

285
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:40,524
I understand you've come
into some information.

286
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,362
Ms Lerner was just expressing
her lack of enthusiasm

287
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:44,768
for matters
of national security

288
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:47,238
where journalistic
competitiveness is at stake.

289
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,002
Mr President,
I'm not interested

290
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:52,398
in using Ellie to
further my career.

291
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,366
What do you know
about E.L.E.?

292
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:59,637
I know you should have
picked a better cover story

293
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:00,605
than a sick wife.

294
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:01,565
See?

295
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:03,560
What did I tell you?

296
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,880
We'd always thought
the deadline for going public

297
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,721
was the publication
of the budget,

298
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:11,959
since we've spent
more money than we can hide.

299
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,880
The budget comes out
in 2 weeks.

300
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:18,759
I don't suppose I could convince
you to sit on this for 2 weeks.

301
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,603
No such thing as 2 weeks
in the news business.

302
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:23,917
And I can't appeal
to your sense

303
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,567
of what's in the nation's
best interest?

304
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:28,038
I always thought
the truth

305
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,040
was in the nation's
best interest.

306
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:35,205
Entrekin:
You want to hold her?

307
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,328
What if we go public
in 48 hours?

308
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,127
Now that's doable,
isn't it?

309
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,006
Entrekin: That would be very
difficult, Mr President.

310
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,161
Morton, if she knows,
how long can it be

311
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:49,400
before CNN or the <i>Post</i>
breaks the story?

312
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:51,480
This was never
gonna be a secret

313
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:52,922
as long as you wanted
it to be.

314
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,440
Give us 2 days, Ms Lerner.

315
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,121
You'll get second row,
centre,

316
00:18:58,209 --> 00:18:59,801
at the White House
press conference.

317
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,039
Now, from what I know of your
career, that's a promotion.

318
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,084
I want exclusivity.

319
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:04,841
Now, listen, young lady.

320
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,682
This is a presidential favour.

321
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:09,327
I'm letting you go

322
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,478
because I don't want
another headache.

323
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:11,888
And I'm trusting you

324
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:15,644
because I know what this
can do for your career.

325
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,401
It might seem
that we have each other

326
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,127
over the same barrel,
Ms Lerner,

327
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,245
but it just seems that way.

328
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:26,558
I want...

329
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:27,968
Want?

330
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,686
May I...

331
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,522
May I have
the first question?

332
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,726
We'll see you Tuesday,
Ms Lerner.

333
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,486
Come on, come on.

334
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,598
E.L.E., E.L.E.

335
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:25,358
Paleontology?

336
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:26,723
Paleontology?

337
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,642
What's paleontology
have to do with anything?

338
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,923
Come on.

339
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,202
Beth: Hey.

340
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,358
Hey.

341
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:54,484
Look who's working late.

342
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,207
How's Rittenhouse going?

343
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,722
No sign of the wife yet.

344
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,003
Is she missing?

345
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,158
No. We're still
working on it.

346
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:01,159
We'll get there.

347
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:02,568
I know,
it's a dull story.

348
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,526
Next time we'll get you
something more exciting.

349
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:06,600
Great.

350
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:08,122
Are you OK?

351
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,358
Yeah.

352
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:10,564
Want to come
to dinner with us?

353
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:13,482
I can't.
I have plans.

354
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:14,684
OK. We'll see you tomorrow.

355
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:26,367

356
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,445
Ah, here she is.

357
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,042
Jenny.

358
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:35,881
Hello.

359
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,008
Hi, Chloe.

00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,204
Waiter: Would you like
some champagne, miss?

361

I missed you.

I mean we missed you
yesterday.

I must say, I'm...

you didn't come

to our wedding.

367
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:58,008
Jason, you
promised.

368
00:21:58,089 --> 00:21:59,602
I know I promised,

369
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,008
but it was
a beautiful event,

370
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,238

You should have been there.

The twins, they were
running around like mad

00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:07,526
and throwing flowers.

00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:09,327
It was wonderful,
especially Emma.

I don't think it's funny
that life goes on.

back together with Mom.

why wasn't this announcement
made sooner?

558

Well, until we knew
we could build the rocket

559
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,270
and the comet
could be intercepted,

560
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,555

to alarm the planet.

question, Ms Lerner?

Yeah. Um...

between the comet

MSNBC has learned that
Secretary Rittenhouse

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,553

announced by

isn't it true, sir,

that not everyone
in your administration

his country with full devotion.

He resigned
for personal reasons.

everyone in this room and
everyone listening to my voice,

585
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,030
that at some point
over the next 10 months,

586
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,910
all of us will entertain
our worst fears and concerns.

promise you this.

saw the comet
in my photograph,

I'd been to the moon.

ain't going to the moon.

the moon did not have

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,237
a rotational cycle
of 14 hours.

727
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,311
I mean, we only have
7 hours of dark

to land on this thing.

none of you
want me here.

You don't even really know
who I am, which is OK.

742
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,999
I walked on the moon,

I belonged to your daddies.

what I'm doing here,

make things worse.

Sometime in the next hour,

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,678
the <i>Messiah</i> mission will
enter its most critical phase:

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,557
the interception
of Wolf-Biederman

853
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,392
and the setting of
the nuclear devices

854
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,948
that will deflect it off
its collision course with Earth.

But first,
Captain Spurgeon Tanner

856
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,272

How come that doesn't
make me feel any better?

864
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,879

865
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,359
Lights on.

866
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,873
Cameras on.

867
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,520
Tanner: On the Mississippi River
in Mark Twain's time,

868
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,033
there were riverboat pilots

869
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,951
who only knew a few miles
of the river.

870
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,632
I mean, conditions
changed so much,

871
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,312
you couldn't
know the whole trip.

872
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,550
Floods, sandbars,
fallen logs...

873
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,676
It was all a riverboat pilot
could do

874
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,639
was to know his little
piece of the puzzle.

875
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,439
So for the next few hours,
this is my ship.

876
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,711
We start our approach.

877
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,593
Jenny:
...are images from cameras

878
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,274
mounted inside the cargo bay
of the <i>Messiah. </i>

879
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,591
Now, these images are delayed
by approximately 20 seconds,

880
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,716
due to the distance
they must travel.

881
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,394
OK, you can see that the image
is breaking up a bit.

882
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,948
Uh, Houston is prepared
for this.

883
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,429
They've informed us that
due to the uncertain make-up

884
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,078
of the comet's coma,

885
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,311
they're unsure whether or not
transmission will be possible.

886
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,995
OK, now, now, it ap-appears
we're losing reception here.

887
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,350
OK, we've... we've
lost picture now.

888
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,510
But we will stay on the air.

889
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,478
We'll stay with you
through all of this.

890

892
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,793
Tanner, Over Intercom:
Roger, descent.

893
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,834
[Alarm Beeping]

894
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,273
Oh, my God.

895
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,238
Baker: Look at these.
They're the size of houses.

896
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,309
Yeah, I know.

897
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,038
I see.

898
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,549

899
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,914

Baker: Cabin press, 5.7.

902
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,039
Negative guidance errors.

903
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,475
Whoa!

904
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,410
Tanner: Use your
primary thrusters.

905
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,218
Baker: Primary thrusters.

906
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,729
What's the descent rate?

907
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,380
3 feet per second. 2.

908
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,654

Tanner: Opening
payload doors.

914
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,015
Don't let that little bit
of gravity down there

915
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,852
go to your heads.

916
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,453
OK.

917
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,889
Start the clock.

918
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,615
Jenny: If all is going
according to schedule,

919
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,975
the astronauts should
now be placing the moles

920
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,493
on the comet surface.

921
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,572
The moles are, well,
they're what they sound like.

922
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,252
They are drilling machines

923
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,377
that burrow
to a depth of 100 metres,

924
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,530
where they wait
to be detonated.

925
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:38,296
Each one carries
a 5,000 kiloton warhead.

926

How's our time?

927
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,729
It's getting tight.
1:36:30.

928
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,969
It's taking too long.

929
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,932
Yup.

930
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,456
What happens if
they do not get off

931
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,451
the comet's surface
in time?

932
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,531
The sun striking the comet
will cause the temperature

933
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,737
to rise 350 degrees
in just a few minutes

934
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,288
and activate
the high-speed gas jets.

935
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,654
Well, if that happens,

936
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,016
it will be like trying
to work in a minefield.

937

Tanner: Mark, what's
your mole 4 readout?

938
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,288

942
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,849
It's stuck.

943
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,929
Try backing it up.

944
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,055

945
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,414
75 feet.

946
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,774
Is that enough?

947
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,213
No. That'll just break
pieces off the surface.

948
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,494
That's not
deep enough.

949
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,572
Yeah, Fish, I know
that's not deep enough.

950
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,809
I'm going in.

951
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,174
Simon: Oren, no.

952
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,057
Monash: No, I'm gonna see
if I can free it up.

953
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,773
Stand by,

954
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,134
All right, I gotcha.

959
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,697
Another 6 minutes, they won't
have time to get back to us.

Blow the tethers.
Let's go get 'em.

961
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,972
If we go after them,

962
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,539
we may not have enough fuel
to get off the surface.

963
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,939
Blow the goddam tethers.

964
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,817

your way, Oren.

966

how much prop we need

967
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,533
to get off this rock.

968
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,212
We'll shut it down
when we hit it.

969
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,415
Will do.

970
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,294
It opens up
into a cave down here.

971

against the side.

973
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,729
Give me your hand.

974
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,654

was going great,

up at 75 feet.

extra in these tanks.

better hurry, boys.

and graduate of
Carnegie-Mellon University,

his medical training

00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,214
at Duke University.

1040
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,337
Dr Partenza was selected
specifically for this mission,

1041
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,014
not only for his
medical expertise,

1042
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,738
but also for his dedication

1043
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,209

of space technology.

and with Oren Monash
injured,

Captain Spurgeon Tanner
is now in charge of the mission.

1048
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,371

Once again, let me remind you,
there is a 20-second delay,

comes back to us,

have been knocked off

So now we're just waiting

1067
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,617
for the picture
to come back.

1068
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,251

1070
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,731
Simon: Mick!

1071
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,299
I'll get the halon!

1072
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,659
Aah!

1073

1074
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,410

I'm still here.

1075
00:58:02,606 --> 00:58:05,359

in 10 seconds.

1076
00:58:05,446 --> 00:58:07,243
Cue the president.

1077
00:58:07,326 --> 00:58:10,796
Mr President,
5, 4, 3...

1078
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,120
Hello, America.

1079
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:19,118
It is my unhappy duty
to report to you

1080
00:58:19,206 --> 00:58:21,322
that the <i>Messiah</i>
has failed.

1081
00:58:21,406 --> 00:58:23,715
This computer-enhanced radar
image from Houston

1082
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:25,637
shows how the detonation
succeeded,

1083
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:28,559
however, did not
destroy the comet.

1084
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:31,956
There are now 2 pieces...
one 6 miles wide,

1085
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:33,957
the other,
a mile and a half.

1086
00:58:34,046 --> 00:58:37,755
Both are still on a path
towards Earth.

1087
00:58:37,846 --> 00:58:39,962
We've lost communication with
the <i>Messiah</i> spacecraft,

1088
00:58:40,046 --> 00:58:43,516
although we continue
to track it visually.

1089
00:58:43,606 --> 00:58:45,915
We don't know
how many are alive.

1090
00:58:46,006 --> 00:58:48,839
We don't know
their condition.

1091
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:52,123
Now, we have to make
some decisions together.

1092
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:54,197
What do we do?

1093
00:58:54,286 --> 00:58:57,278
You have a choice.
We have a choice...

1094
00:58:57,366 --> 00:58:58,560
Right now.

1095
00:58:59,806 --> 00:59:01,319
Ever since the comet
was discovered,

1096
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:03,920
we've been hoping
and working for the best,

1097
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:06,804
but we've also been
planning for the worst.

1098
00:59:06,886 --> 00:59:09,798
Our strategy
has been twofold.

1099
00:59:09,886 --> 00:59:12,161
First, our strategic
missile command

1100
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:13,725
is preparing to coordinate
with the Russians

1101
00:59:13,806 --> 00:59:15,524
a massive strike
of Titan missiles

1102
00:59:15,606 --> 00:59:17,995
to intercept the comets.

1103
00:59:18,086 --> 00:59:20,919
If we can deflect
these comets enough,

1104
00:59:21,006 --> 00:59:24,919
they will bounce harmlessly
off our atmosphere

1105
00:59:25,006 --> 00:59:27,679
and head on out into space.

1106
00:59:27,766 --> 00:59:30,519
Unfortunately, the Titans
cannot be launched

1107
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:32,756
until the comets
are only a few hours away.

1108
00:59:32,846 --> 00:59:36,759
And while we are confident
the missile attack will succeed,

1109
00:59:36,846 --> 00:59:39,235
it is only prudent that we
now take cautionary steps

1110
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,920
to ensure the continuation
of our way of life,

1111
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:45,078
to guarantee that there
will be enough of us left

1112
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,963
to rebuild a new world

1113
00:59:47,046 --> 00:59:50,516
in the unlikely event that
the comets do strike the Earth.

1114
00:59:50,606 --> 00:59:54,724
So, in the soft limestone
of Missouri,

1115
00:59:54,806 --> 00:59:57,559
we've been preparing
a network of immense caves,

1116
00:59:57,646 --> 00:59:59,477
and they're almost finished.

1117
00:59:59,566 --> 01:00:02,126
And we can put
a million people in them.

1118
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:04,766
And that million people can
survive there, underground,

1119
01:00:04,846 --> 01:00:06,279
for 2 years,

1120
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:10,200
until the air clears
and the dust settles.

1121
01:00:10,286 --> 01:00:12,641
Now, the cave is more
than a dormitory.

1122
01:00:12,726 --> 01:00:14,796
It's our new Noah's Ark.

1123
01:00:14,886 --> 01:00:16,842
We're storing seeds
and seedlings,

1124
01:00:16,926 --> 01:00:20,441
plants, animals,
enough to start over.

1125
01:00:20,526 --> 01:00:22,005
On August 10th,
a computer

1126
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:25,362
will randomly select
800,000 Americans

1127
01:00:25,446 --> 01:00:29,200
to join the 200,000 scientists,
doctors, engineers,

1128
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:32,323
teachers, soldiers, and artists,
who have already been chosen.

1129
01:00:32,406 --> 01:00:34,317
Other countries
are preparing similar caves

1130
01:00:34,406 --> 01:00:36,203
along whatever lines
they feel are best

1131
01:00:36,286 --> 01:00:38,481
to preserve their way
of life.

1132
01:00:38,566 --> 01:00:40,079
This is ours.

1133
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:44,079
Beginning tonight and continuing
until the crisis passes,

1134
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:47,283
I am declaring a state
of martial law.

1135
01:00:47,366 --> 01:00:49,038
The armed forces
and the National Guard

1136
01:00:49,126 --> 01:00:51,879
are working
with local law enforcement.

1137
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:54,434
A national curfew begins
at midnight tonight.

1138
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:58,041
Now, wherever you are,
go home.

1139
01:00:58,126 --> 01:01:00,879
Stay off the roads
after sunset.

1140
01:01:00,966 --> 01:01:02,524
Crimes against persons
or property

1141
01:01:02,606 --> 01:01:06,963
will be dealt with
swiftly and harshly.

1142
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:09,355
News stations around the nation
are being faxed copies

1143
01:01:09,446 --> 01:01:11,243
of the lottery procedure
as we speak,

1144
01:01:11,326 --> 01:01:13,635
and they'll be broadcasting
the details to you

1145
01:01:13,726 --> 01:01:15,079
in a few moments.

1146
01:01:22,286 --> 01:01:23,560
I wish...

1147
01:01:26,286 --> 01:01:27,321
No.

1148
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:30,844
Wishing is wrong.

1149
01:01:30,926 --> 01:01:32,803
It's the wrong word
right now.

1150
01:01:32,886 --> 01:01:34,399
That's not what I mean.

1151
01:01:36,486 --> 01:01:38,158
What I mean is...

1152
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:42,116
I believe in God.

1153
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:44,356
Relax.

1154
01:01:44,446 --> 01:01:47,006
I know a lot of you don't,

1155
01:01:47,086 --> 01:01:48,838
but I still want
to offer a prayer...

1156
01:01:48,926 --> 01:01:51,315
for our survival.

1157
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:54,274
Mine included.

1158
01:01:55,486 --> 01:01:58,444
Because I believe that God,

1159
01:01:58,526 --> 01:02:00,244
whomever you hold
that to be,

1160
01:02:00,326 --> 01:02:03,238
hears all prayers,

1161
01:02:03,326 --> 01:02:06,079
even if sometimes
the answer is no.

1162
01:02:07,286 --> 01:02:10,084
So, may the Lord bless you.

1163
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,555
May the Lord keep you.

1164
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,797
May the Lord lift up His divine
countenance upon you...

1165
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:19,756
and give you peace.

01:16:07,425 --> 01:16:09,177
- What?
- I want to stay.

1414

No. I have to stay
with you.

a phone call for you.

1425
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:57,344
Yes?

01:16:57,425 --> 01:16:59,461
This is she.

1428
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:10,335
When?

1429
01:17:15,225 --> 01:17:16,658
Uh, 61.

1430
01:17:18,145 --> 01:17:22,616
I'll come down there then.
Thank you.

1431
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:24,297
Thank you very much.

1432
01:17:28,105 --> 01:17:30,141
Jenny, do you want us
to do something?

1433
01:18:31,705 --> 01:18:35,380
You're too late. I already
took care of everything.

1434
01:18:37,585 --> 01:18:40,577
Come. Inside the car.
You're getting sick. Please.

1435
01:18:40,665 --> 01:18:42,576
I want to talk to you.

1436

Go home and tell it
to Chloe.

1439
01:18:51,345 --> 01:18:52,744
I can't.
She left me.

1440
01:18:52,825 --> 01:18:55,623
She's with her mother.
They both got scared.

1441

Come. I want
to talk to you.

1442
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:00,535
I need you.

1443
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:02,138
How does it feel?

1444
01:19:06,225 --> 01:19:08,261
I feel like an orphan.

Welcome to the ARK. I'm

01:20:32,345 --> 01:20:34,905
That's where you'll be

I wanted to show you that
you're not an orphan.

you're not an orphan.

01:22:22,185 --> 01:22:23,140

01:22:34,665 --> 01:22:36,064

1486
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:38,938
She took this?

1487
01:22:39,025 --> 01:22:39,901
Mm-hmm.

1488
01:22:39,985 --> 01:22:42,943
And this one, too.

1489
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:45,334
She was such an artist,
don't you think so?

1490
01:22:47,465 --> 01:22:49,296
You don't remember
when we take them, hmm?

1491
01:22:49,385 --> 01:22:52,377
I'm 5 years old. How
would I remember that?

1492
01:22:52,465 --> 01:22:56,663

when they were 5 years old.

01:22:59,105 --> 01:23:01,335
It was such
a beautiful day.

1494
01:23:01,425 --> 01:23:03,620
All alone on the beach.

1495
01:23:05,305 --> 01:23:08,297
And, of course, she would
have been in the picture,

1496
01:23:08,385 --> 01:23:12,537
but there was no one else
to hold the camera,

1497
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:15,742
and... she insisted.

1498
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:18,339
You know how she is.

1499
01:23:18,425 --> 01:23:20,063

Radio: We have now
confirmed the launch

1508
01:24:20,505 --> 01:24:22,336
of all the Titan missiles

1509
01:24:22,425 --> 01:24:24,814
from their positions in
North Dakota and Wyoming.

1510
01:24:24,905 --> 01:24:27,703
The comets are now
approximately 14 hours

1511
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:30,140
outside of
Earth's atmosphere,

1512
01:24:30,225 --> 01:24:32,216
and we are told it should
take these missiles

1513
01:24:32,305 --> 01:24:35,103
less than 20 minutes
to reach their target.

1514
01:24:35,185 --> 01:24:37,653
Jenny: OK, here's what
we're looking at.

1515
01:24:37,745 --> 01:24:40,054
All of the Titans
have been launched.

1516
01:24:40,145 --> 01:24:42,898
We still won't know if
they've made a difference.

1517
01:24:42,985 --> 01:24:45,294
The comets have
to travel for a while

1518
01:24:45,385 --> 01:24:47,694
before the radar tracking
stations can see

1519
01:24:47,785 --> 01:24:49,423
if they've been pushed
to a safe course

1520
01:24:49,505 --> 01:24:51,336
that'll bypass the Earth.

1521
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:55,184
So, one more time
we have to wait.

1522
01:25:13,584 --> 01:25:14,619
Are we on?

1523
01:25:14,704 --> 01:25:16,820
Cameraman: We're on,
Mr President.

1524
01:25:26,184 --> 01:25:28,015
Our missiles have failed.

1525
01:25:29,784 --> 01:25:35,142
The comets are
still headed for Earth...

1526
01:25:35,224 --> 01:25:36,816
and there's nothing
we can do to stop them.

1527
01:25:40,264 --> 01:25:43,176
So, this is it.

1528
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:45,937
If the world does go on...

1529
01:25:46,024 --> 01:25:48,492
it will not go on
for everyone.

1530
01:25:48,584 --> 01:25:51,382
We have now been able
to calculate

1531
01:25:51,464 --> 01:25:53,136
the comets'
final trajectories,

1532
01:25:53,224 --> 01:25:56,773
and we have determined where
they're going to strike.

1533
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:00,300
The smaller of the 2 comets,
Biederman, will hit first,

1534
01:26:00,384 --> 01:26:02,215
somewhere along
the Atlantic Seaboard

1535
01:26:02,304 --> 01:26:05,023
probably in the waters off
the coast of Cape Hatteras

1536
01:26:05,104 --> 01:26:08,813
in just under 12 hours at
4:35 p.m. eastern daylight time.

1537
01:26:08,904 --> 01:26:12,977
The impact of the comet
is going to be...

1538
01:26:13,064 --> 01:26:15,373
Well, disastrous.

1539
01:26:15,464 --> 01:26:18,183
There will be
a very large tidal wave

1540
01:26:18,264 --> 01:26:20,095
moving quickly through
the Atlantic Ocean.

1541
01:26:20,184 --> 01:26:22,015
It will be 100 feet high,

1542
01:26:22,104 --> 01:26:24,015
travelling at
1,100 miles an hour.

1543
01:26:24,104 --> 01:26:26,857
That's faster than
the speed of sound.

1544
01:26:26,944 --> 01:26:29,253
As it reaches shallow water,
it's going to slow down,

1545
01:26:29,344 --> 01:26:30,697
but the wave height,

1546
01:26:30,784 --> 01:26:33,059
depending on the depth
of the shelf off the coast,

1547
01:26:33,144 --> 01:26:37,456
will be anywhere from
1,000 to 3,500 feet high.

1548
01:26:37,544 --> 01:26:40,058
Where the land is flat,

1549
01:26:40,144 --> 01:26:45,502
the wave will wash inland
600 to 700 miles.

1550
01:26:45,584 --> 01:26:50,214
The wave will hit our nation's
capital 40 minutes after impact.

1551
01:26:50,304 --> 01:26:56,743
New York City, Boston,
Atlanta, Philadelphia...

1552
01:26:56,824 --> 01:26:58,701
all will be destroyed.

1553
01:26:58,784 --> 01:27:02,174
If you have any means of getting
away from the path of this wave,

1554
01:27:02,264 --> 01:27:04,539
leave now.

1555
01:27:04,624 --> 01:27:07,218
The impact of the larger comet

1556
01:27:07,304 --> 01:27:10,296
will be nothing less than
an extinction-level event.

1557
01:27:10,384 --> 01:27:13,103
It will strike land
in Western Canada

1558
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:15,220
3 hours after Biederman.

1559
01:27:15,304 --> 01:27:17,135
Within a week,

1560
01:27:17,224 --> 01:27:19,055
the skies will be dark
with dust from the impact

1561
01:27:19,144 --> 01:27:22,102
and they will stay dark
for 2 years.

1562
01:27:22,184 --> 01:27:26,143
All plant life
will be dead within...

1563
01:27:26,224 --> 01:27:28,784
4 weeks.

1564
01:27:28,864 --> 01:27:32,174
Animal life within...

1565
01:27:32,264 --> 01:27:33,902
a few months.

1566
01:27:36,824 --> 01:27:39,099
So that's it.

1567
01:27:39,184 --> 01:27:41,175
Good luck to us all.

Fish: Could I bother
everyone for a minute?

1569
01:28:09,144 --> 01:28:10,975
Let's take a look
at the big one.

1570
01:28:11,064 --> 01:28:13,783
Now, the outgassing
has created a vent

1571
01:28:13,864 --> 01:28:16,253
a half mile wide and
at least 2 miles deep.

1572
01:28:16,344 --> 01:28:18,096
Comet gets closer to the sun,
sun melts the ice,

1573
01:28:18,184 --> 01:28:21,620
ice turns to steam,
we get a big hole, OK?

1574
01:28:21,704 --> 01:28:25,936
So, how many nukes do we
have left in the back?

1575
01:28:26,024 --> 01:28:28,140
4.

1576
01:28:28,224 --> 01:28:32,695
If we can get the remaining
bombs in that vent,

1577
01:28:32,784 --> 01:28:36,618
there shouldn't be anything
left bigger than a suitcase.

1578
01:28:36,704 --> 01:28:38,376
We can't do anything
about the little one,

1579
01:28:38,464 --> 01:28:42,423
but it just might
give them a chance.

1580
01:28:42,504 --> 01:28:44,335
Without the arming codes,

1581
01:28:44,424 --> 01:28:46,858
we're going to have to wait
to set the bomb timers

1582
01:28:46,944 --> 01:28:49,060
until we get closer to Earth
to raise Houston.

1583
01:28:49,144 --> 01:28:51,942
We may not have enough

to get back into
the cargo bay for the nukes,

1585
01:28:54,024 --> 01:28:56,015
much less to go down
to the comet.

1586
01:28:56,104 --> 01:28:57,742
We sure as hell don't have
enough propellant left

1587

in the <i>Messiah</i>
to manoeuvre with.

How are we supposed to get
back off the surface

1589
01:29:03,624 --> 01:29:05,660
once we've
gotten down there?

1590
01:29:10,824 --> 01:29:12,018
We don't.

1591
01:29:20,864 --> 01:29:23,697
Well, look at
the bright side.

1592
01:29:23,784 --> 01:29:26,093

high schools named after us.

Nice of you to call,

1597
01:30:05,904 --> 01:30:07,462

to wonder

1598

up there.

Yep. We don't have time
to talk, Houston.

There's nothing we can do
about the smaller one,

but we do have a plan.

1604
01:30:17,744 --> 01:30:20,178
We need the arming codes
for the last 4 nukes.

We have one helicopter.
Holds 7 people.

1610
01:30:30,984 --> 01:30:33,418
We can ferry 6 people to
high ground in West Virginia

1611
01:30:33,504 --> 01:30:34,414
and take Jenny to the ARK.

The road was so crowded.
We weren't gonna make it.

we should be here

01:44:49,303 --> 01:44:54,252
Hi, sweetie.
This is your father.

1760
01:44:54,343 --> 01:44:57,380
His name is Oren.
I named him after you.

1761
01:44:57,463 --> 01:44:59,772
Monash: Hello, Oren.

1762
01:44:59,863 --> 01:45:02,377
Show him what
you brought him.

1763
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:05,694
He's holding up
a little rocket.

1764
01:45:05,783 --> 01:45:08,900
That's a mighty powerful
rocket you got there.

1765

Simon:
He's laughing.

1766
01:45:10,423 --> 01:45:13,574
I can hear him.
I know.

1767

Mariette...

1768
01:45:15,703 --> 01:45:18,297
I'm hugging you both
right now.

1769
01:45:18,383 --> 01:45:19,498
I'm holding you.

1770
01:45:21,383 --> 01:45:22,498
Baker: 25 seconds.

1771
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:24,096

the nukes.

It's been a pleasure
serving with you, Commander.

1783
01:45:45,903 --> 01:45:48,417
The honour's
all mine, Andy.

1784
01:45:53,223 --> 01:45:55,862
Be good, Oren.

1785
01:45:58,423 --> 01:45:59,458
Be good.

[Mariette Sobbing]

1787
01:47:08,023 --> 01:47:10,981
Beck: We watched as the bombs
shattered the second comet

1788
01:47:11,063 --> 01:47:13,054
into a million of pieces
of ice and rock

1789
01:47:13,143 --> 01:47:15,338
that burned harmlessly
in our atmosphere

1790
01:47:15,423 --> 01:47:18,540
and lit up the sky
for an hour.

1791
01:47:18,623 --> 01:47:22,411
Still, we were left with
the devastation of the first.

1792
01:47:22,503 --> 01:47:24,812
The waters
reached as far inland

1793
01:47:24,903 --> 01:47:26,973
as the Ohio
and Tennessee Valleys.

1794
01:47:27,063 --> 01:47:30,499
It washed away
farms and towns...

1795
01:47:30,583 --> 01:47:34,371
forests and skyscrapers.

1796
01:47:34,463 --> 01:47:38,092
But the water receded.

1797
01:47:39,743 --> 01:47:42,735
The wave hit Europe
and Africa, too.

1798
01:47:42,823 --> 01:47:45,701
Millions were lost.

1799
01:47:45,783 --> 01:47:50,015
Countless more
left homeless.

1800
01:47:50,103 --> 01:47:53,652
But the waters receded.

1801
01:47:55,463 --> 01:47:59,138
Cities fall...

1802
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:01,532
but they are rebuilt.

1803
01:48:01,623 --> 01:48:04,262
And heroes die...

1804
01:48:04,343 --> 01:48:07,460
but they are remembered.

1805
01:48:07,543 --> 01:48:10,615
We honour them
with every brick we lay...

1806
01:48:10,703 --> 01:48:13,536
with every field we sow...

1807
01:48:13,623 --> 01:48:17,332
with every child we comfort
and then teach to rejoice

1808
01:48:17,423 --> 01:48:19,459
in what
we have been regiven.

1809

01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,380
Our home.

01:48:29,983 --> 01:48:31,780
