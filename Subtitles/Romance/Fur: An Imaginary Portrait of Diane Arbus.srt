1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,995
Englewood. Englewood.

2
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:43,066
Anyone for Englewood.

3
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:57,720
Hello.

4
00:03:58,564 --> 00:03:59,907
Mrs. Arbus?

5
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:01,940
That's right.

6
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:05,392
I'm Jack Henry.

7
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,483
Welcome to Camp Venus.

8
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:09,075
It's terrific to be here.

9
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:17,899
Come on in. Thank you.

10
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:21,700
I don't wanna be any bother.

11
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:26,454
Oh, no, not at all. We're
delighted to have a photographer here.

12
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:28,337
It's simply...

13
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:32,937
I n order to get permission, you
must take them off.

14
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:38,192
No one ever mentioned that.

15
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,763
And there are two rules.

16
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:44,369
Yes?- The first one is:

17
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,594
No erections.

18
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:55,609
And no staring.

19
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,566
I'm sorry.

20
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:00,327
Please, go ahead and disrobe,Ms. Arbus.

21
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:02,898
We're used to it. Aren't we, Jack?- Hm.

22
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:09,304
To tell you the truth, I need a
moment to myself, if that's all right.

23
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:12,450
I understand. - We'll leave you alone.

24
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:19,125
Oh.

25
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,002
How pretty.

26
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,839
Belonged to a friend.

27
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,810
Okay, boys, let's move them in.

28
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:10,991
Jimmy, get in the back. - Okay, boss.

29
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:52,998
Mother?

30
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:55,415
Grandma and Grandpa are here.

31
00:06:56,643 --> 00:06:58,599
Thank you, Gracie.

32
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,967
Welcome to the Allan
Arbus Family Photo Studio...

33
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:23,765
...run by my son-in-law, Allan...
|My talented son-in-law, Allan.

34
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:26,489
...and his number one
assistant, my daughter Diane.

35
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,752
This also happens to be their home.

36
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,635
So it's a real family business.

37
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,663
We hope you'll all become part of our family.

38
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:37,272
Look! Mommy, look!

39
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:41,143
...Macy's, Bergdorf's and all the
other great stores across town.

40
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:43,560
Hello, Diane.

41
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,046
There must be someone moving in upstairs.

42
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:50,466
Clearly.

43
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:53,650
There was no way for me to know|this
would happen tonight, Mother.

44
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:57,524
Diane, we're holding the show here|this
year to help you and your family out.

45
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,481
I know. We're grateful.

46
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,281
Where did you get that dress?

47
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:04,161
Well...

48
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:06,117
...you gave it to me, Mother.

49
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:08,036
I gave it to you last year.

50
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:20,350
I n the living room, please, Merta. |
- Yes, Mrs. Arbus.

51
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,020
Easy, Jim.

52
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:30,593
Easy.

53
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:33,819
There we go. Hang on.

54
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:36,347
Hang on, hang on. Set it down.

55
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,186
You got it?

56
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:40,605
You okay?- All right.

57
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:47,012
Keep going, boys,all the way to the top.

58
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:58,521
Diane.

59
00:08:58,713 --> 00:09:00,554
Not now. - Come on.

60
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,429
Here, let me help you with that, Rose.

61
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:06,462
Your father's already driving me nuts.

62
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:08,265
I know, Allan.

63
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,178
He wanted to trim it with monkey. 
- A monkey?

64
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:14,058
I said no.

65
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,661
To all the greatest fur buyers in America:

66
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,730
My wife, Gertrude, and I welcome
you to my daughter's home.

67
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,149
Thank you all for coming.

68
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,569
She's really something.

69
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:27,254
Thank you all for taking the
time to join us this evening.

70
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:29,134
As you know, for the past 30 years...

71
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,743
...Russeks has been|the
biggest buyer of pelts...

72
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,968
...and producers of fur
garments in the world.

73
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,152
And like us, you all don't want
to let only New York ladies...

74
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,221
...have the luxury of world-class
furs. - I need gloves. Like this?

75
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,101
Now, do we?- Of course not.

76
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,748
So without further ado... - Finally!

77
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:48,123
...ladies and gentlemen,observe the fox.

78
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,919
Stealthy, luxurious,the colors of autumn.

79
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:57,215
Each individual coat truly a thing of beauty.

80
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:01,435
Lustrous, dark-hued,naturally cloud-soft.

81
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:04,926
Crafted with the distinctive
flair and elegant styling...

82
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:09,453
...women of discriminating taste
have come to expect from Russeks furs.

83
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,256
And the leopard.

84
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:15,284
The spotted and graceful
dancer of the jungle.

85
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:20,079
Notice the matching hat,
purse, mirror and cosmetic case.

86
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,108
This prestigious ensemble
will be the cornerstone...

87
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:26,985
...of our fall advertising campaign,to
be photographed, of course...

88
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:30,054
...by the Allan Arbus Family
Photo Studio which later...

89
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:36,230
There really isn't an occasion
when you can't wear leopard.

90
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:50,731
Friends, prepare yourselves...

91
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:54,836
...for the unbearably
soft appeal of chinchilla.

92
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:59,977
The silkiest and most sensual
fur that money can buy.

93
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:02,854
This one's jammed. Get me the
Hasselblad with the wide-angle.

94
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,430
Okay.

95
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,150
This delicate fur... - Excuse me.

96
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:09,682
...and certainly.

97
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:22,956
All set, Charlie. - Got everything?

98
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:24,490
That's it.

99
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:27,444
Good luck to you.

100
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:20,960
Diane? You got it?

101
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:22,072
What?- The Hasselblad.

102
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:24,451
Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

103
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,755
Come on.

104
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,482
Let's go upstairs for the studio tour...

105
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:30,742
...take a look at the wonderful
work my son-in-law's doing.

106
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:33,773
Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Seventeen.

107
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,382
My husband has... Has shot campaigns for...

108
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:40,180
...Chock full of Nuts, Sunbeam|and many more.

109
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:45,128
But his main focus for the past 10
years has been the daily new Russeks ads...

110
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:49,502
...for my father's world-renowned
store that run in The New York Times.

111
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:52,762
May I ask, uh, what do you photograph,Diane?

112
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:58,555
Me? Um, oh, no, I'm...
I'm not the photographer.

113
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,895
No, my husband is.

114
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,044
But, uh, what do you do?

115
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:06,113
Um...

116
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,683
Well, I...

117
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:13,708
I take light readings and I,
uh... I... I... iron clothes.

118
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,243
I, um...

119
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:22,263
I provide straws for the models so that their
lipstick doesn't smudge, and I, uh...

120
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:25,831
...I accessorize their clothes.
I rearrange their hair.

121
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:29,130
I... It's not that much.

122
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:33,657
Diane, uh, do you have any
fashion tips for a friend?

123
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,608
Um, as a matter of fact, yes, yes, I do.

124
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:39,603
One's, um...

125
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:45,127
One's nails should, um... Should only
be slightly longer than the pads of...

126
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:46,777
Of one's...

127
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:50,652
One's fingertips, and...

128
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:52,570
For chrissake, what now?

129
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,442
Excuse me.

130
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,091
Are you all right?- I'm sorry.

131
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:07,608
Everyone, dessert is
served|downstairs in the living room.

132
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:18,196
Diane?

133
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:19,961
Uh...

134
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:27,211
I'm okay, Allan. I'm sorry.

135
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:31,546
Just need a moment. Okay?

136
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,774
Are you sure?

137
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:35,421
Yes.

138
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:38,988
Okay.

139
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:42,172
Thank you.

140
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:23,373
Diane?

141
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,145
Maybe you should take some time off.

142
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,214
Allan. |- I could hire an assistant.

143
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:45,700
I bought you that square-format
camera 10 years ago...

144
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,426
...you haven't even used it, Diane.

145
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,994
Maybe you could take a class.

146
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,390
Is that your secret?

147
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,730
Yes.

148
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,799
My answer is no.I'm not
gonna leave you during the day.

149
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:09,868
What's yours?

150
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:13,743
Come on, tell me. What's your secret?

151
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,755
I unbuttoned my dress on the porch tonight.

152
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:28,017
What?

153
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,817
Allan, I...

154
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,922
I don't wanna be like that.

155
00:17:33,957 --> 00:17:34,957
Like what?

156
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,065
I'm your wife, I shouldn't do that.

157
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,980
Dee...

158
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,003
You know I think you're brilliant.

159
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:49,151
No, you think I'm strange... - No.

160
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,031
...that I can't be normal.

161
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:53,295
I never said that.

162
00:17:54,215 --> 00:17:57,438
Even our own children think I'm strange.

163
00:17:58,704 --> 00:17:59,931
I love you.

164
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,550
I love you.

165
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:51,222
Good night, sweetheart.

166
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,792
Good night.

167
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,280
What do you think?

168
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:16,502
I don't know.

169
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:19,341
I don't know. It's all so predictable.

170
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:24,059
You know we have the golf course in about 20 minutes.

171
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:27,359
With swimsuits and puppies.

172
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:31,924
The client's gonna love it.

173
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:33,804
Mm-hmm.

174
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:35,185
Mother?

175
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:39,328
Go ahead, take it. - Okay.

176
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:40,901
What is it, Grace?

177
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:43,356
There's something wrong with the plumbing.

178
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,867
I need you to turn off the
main water valve, the big one...

179
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,476
...and bring me Daddy's
tool kit and a bucket.

180
00:20:56,668 --> 00:20:59,008
You're a good girl. - Okay, Mom.

181
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:02,805
Uh, Grace, tissue.

182
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:07,715
Trash.

183
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:10,669
Oh, yuck.

184
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:19,761
Oh.

185
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,283
Ew!

186
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:37,830
What was that?

187
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:42,088
It's nothing.

188
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,003
Okay, Gracie, let's go.

189
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,788
Taxi!

190
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,264
Yes?

191
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:36,371
Are you washing a dog?

192
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:39,977
Excuse me?

193
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:42,777
Do you have a large dog?

194
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,233
A dog?

195
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,752
Your dog's hair is in my pipes. It's
causing problems with the plumbing.

196
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,897
Perhaps you should check the basement...

197
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:57,777
...Diane.

198
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:09,208
Hello.

199
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:16,305
Are you a new neighbor?

200
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,180
I'm a friend of Lionel's. - Lionel?

201
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,211
The man who lives upstairs?

202
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,804
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll, uh, get out of your way.

203
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:24,284
Time to sleep now, Gracie.

204
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:26,164
Okay, Mom.

205
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:25,434
Allan.

206
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:12,005
Christ, what is that?!

207
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:33,564
I fixed my drain for you.

208
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,278
Thank you.

209
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:43,346
You still think I have a dog?

210
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:46,607
I have 10 dogs.

211
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,405
I don't think you have a dog.

212
00:30:50,597 --> 00:30:53,669
I haven't seen any dogs going up the stairs.

213
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:58,576
I'm not feeling very well right now. I can't find my rabbit.

214
00:30:59,995 --> 00:31:04,676
Oh, okay. Then I'll, uh...
|I'll... I'll come back later.

215
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,675
You saw me the night I moved in, remember?

216
00:31:22,284 --> 00:31:23,400
Yes.

217
00:31:23,435 --> 00:31:26,351
I definitely saw you.

218
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,957
You trying to seduce me, Diane?

219
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:31,683
No.

220
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:33,486
No. - No?

221
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:34,829
God, no.

222
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,511
Is that why you came up
here|in the middle of the night?

223
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,304
I, um...

224
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:47,143
Well, I would like to, uh...

225
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,785
I'd like to take a portrait|of
you and your... Your wife.

226
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:54,969
I don't have a wife.

227
00:31:57,347 --> 00:32:01,644
Well, then I would like to
take a portrait of you, just you.

228
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:04,943
When?

229
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,393
Now.

230
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:14,150
It's not a good time for me.

231
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:19,214
Come back tomorrow night at 9.

232
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,477
Tomorrow?

233
00:32:21,861 --> 00:32:23,357
Okay.

234
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,160
Okay.

235
00:32:30,838 --> 00:32:34,022
Do you have trouble sleeping, Diane?

236
00:32:35,863 --> 00:32:39,930
Actually, it's "Diane. "

237
00:32:40,812 --> 00:32:45,723
Why would you want to take a portrait|of
someone you've never seen, Diane?

238
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:53,012
Most nights I have trouble sleeping.

239
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:57,270
Did you get the key?

240
00:32:59,495 --> 00:33:00,531
The key?

241
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:05,556
Diane, come back tomorrow night at 9.

242
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:22,243
Hey, watch it, Vern.

243
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,245
I forgot something.

244
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,887
Looks like gin rummy.

245
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:46,756
Foo-Foo, don't you bother Donald,
now,you keep still for Mummy.

246
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:48,675
They're adorable, aren't they?

247
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:50,900
And such beautiful coats.

248
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,290
I'll be to bed soon, darling.

249
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,285
I...

250
00:35:20,477 --> 00:35:22,625
I thought I'd go for a walk.

251
00:35:22,817 --> 00:35:24,083
Okay.

252
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:25,886
Be careful.

253
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:47,407
Lionel?

254
00:36:50,706 --> 00:36:52,240
Hello?

255
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,038
Hello?

256
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,240
Lionel?

257
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:14,797
Do not go near him,ladies and gentlemen.

258
00:38:14,832 --> 00:38:17,674
He has taken lives already.

259
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:22,968
In captivity, we have the upper hand.

260
00:38:23,582 --> 00:38:26,919
But isn't Lionel a good doggie?

261
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:09,502
Drink a cup.

262
00:39:56,342 --> 00:39:57,647
Turn around.

263
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:00,524
Don't look at me.

264
00:40:07,122 --> 00:40:10,038
Turn around.

265
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,884
Take off your camera.

266
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:29,104
Just put it on the table.

267
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,817
Please close your eyes now.

268
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,426
I only wanna take your portrait.

269
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,075
Diane...

270
00:40:55,612 --> 00:41:00,062
...please close your eyes.

271
00:41:00,254 --> 00:41:02,556
Step back from the window.

272
00:41:18,246 --> 00:41:20,625
Are your eyes closed?

273
00:41:20,817 --> 00:41:21,814
Yes.

274
00:41:29,793 --> 00:41:33,476
Don't turn around. Keep your eyes closed.

275
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:37,159
And please disrobe. - What?

276
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:41,264
You can keep your undergarments on if you like. 
The bath is getting cold.

277
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:45,138
I don't want to.

278
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,698
I think I should go.

279
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:24,038
I'm sorry.

280
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:56,876
Hello.

281
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,099
Take anything in your tea?

282
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,677
Now, tell me something.

283
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,940
Tell me something about yourself.

284
00:43:17,937 --> 00:43:19,472
Are you rich?

285
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:22,349
You look rich.

286
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:24,037
My parents are.

287
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:26,147
So you were a spoiled child?

288
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:30,098
Did you eat caviar? Did you have servants?

289
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:32,323
Yes.

290
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,510
What were their names?

291
00:43:36,275 --> 00:43:37,733
Scott was my chauffeur...

292
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:43,295
...Gisela was my German nanny,and
Catherine was my French nanny.

293
00:43:43,794 --> 00:43:46,134
Did you ever show your nanny|your tits?

294
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:50,814
Now, when you were a teenager...

295
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:55,840
...there must have been a doorman you
made love to in the basement...

296
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,599
...or a chauffeur, a
gardener,|an elevator man?

297
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:02,937
Did you ever give him a blowjob on
the way down to the lobby?

298
00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:05,008
No. - No?

299
00:44:06,888 --> 00:44:08,729
Did he want you to?

300
00:44:13,064 --> 00:44:15,405
Well, did he?

301
00:44:15,596 --> 00:44:17,092
Probably.

302
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:19,318
How could you tell?

303
00:44:21,005 --> 00:44:22,348
I...

304
00:44:23,576 --> 00:44:27,335
He used to stop the elevator between floors.

305
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,826
And?

306
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:32,898
And stare at me.

307
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:36,542
Did you like that?

308
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,148
It terrified me.

309
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,299
Of course, but...

310
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,985
But did you like it?

311
00:44:46,593 --> 00:44:49,125
One time I showed him my underwear.

312
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:50,583
So? Then I'm right.

313
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:53,652
Chauffeured girls don't expose themselves.

314
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:55,187
They don't show their tits.

315
00:44:55,378 --> 00:44:58,831
Don't they?
- I don't know. Do they? You tell me.

316
00:45:01,593 --> 00:45:03,281
Where have you been hiding?

317
00:45:07,194 --> 00:45:11,069
I suppose I did. I exposed myself.

318
00:45:11,104 --> 00:45:13,025
Till my father caught me.

319
00:45:13,217 --> 00:45:14,870
Where did this occur?

320
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:16,976
I n the bathroom. - To whom?

321
00:45:17,168 --> 00:45:18,818
To the neighbors.

322
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:23,920
I would touch myself in front of the window.

323
00:45:24,112 --> 00:45:25,570
Really?

324
00:45:25,761 --> 00:45:27,603
Did you ever see anyone watching?

325
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:34,048
I saw you...

326
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:37,193
...through my window.

327
00:45:37,884 --> 00:45:41,145
And right away I wanted
to come into your home.

328
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:50,352
And when you were young, did
anyone like me ever come to your house?

329
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:58,868
There was a little boy. He had...

330
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,784
He had a purple birthmark across his face.

331
00:46:01,976 --> 00:46:03,820
I saw him in the park and I...

332
00:46:03,855 --> 00:46:07,960
I followed him all the way|to
his front door in the Bronx.

333
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,914
But he disappeared before I could...

334
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:16,131
Shortly after that, I dropped
doing that sort of thing.

335
00:46:16,323 --> 00:46:19,239
And I planned on going so many places.

336
00:46:20,773 --> 00:46:22,078
Where?

337
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:24,303
All sorts of places, everywhere.

338
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:25,952
Where? Tell me.

339
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:30,671
A doll hospital...

340
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:33,433
...the city morgue...

341
00:46:34,776 --> 00:46:36,809
...the insane asylum...

342
00:46:37,384 --> 00:46:41,239
...dumps, flophouses, everywhere, I...

343
00:46:41,274 --> 00:46:45,095
And instead,I was my husband's assistant.

344
00:46:57,601 --> 00:46:59,136
Join me?

345
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:23,534
Would you like to|take off your slippers?

346
00:47:39,685 --> 00:47:41,488
Wanna step in?

347
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:21,308
My condition is called hypertrichosis.

348
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:24,051
When I was a teenager, I woke
up every morning at 5 a. m...

349
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:26,487
...to shave every part of me that
stuck out from my clothing.

350
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:30,285
Grew back so quickly it
was hardly worth the effort.

351
00:48:32,434 --> 00:48:34,352
Besides, it made me prickly.

352
00:48:38,303 --> 00:48:40,682
Would you please close your eyes again?

353
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:47,510
Can I trust you to keep them closed?

354
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,045
Yes.

355
00:48:52,536 --> 00:48:57,216
Well, just in case, put this on.

356
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,665
Do you like to go swimming?

357
00:49:32,624 --> 00:49:34,082
Yes.

358
00:49:57,982 --> 00:50:01,818
Did you get the key?

359
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,285
That little boy...

360
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:01,932
...was so beautiful.

361
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:00,704
Have a cookie.

362
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,957
I must be brave.

363
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:11,254
I must be brave. I must be brave.

364
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:14,630
I must be brave.

365
00:52:59,168 --> 00:53:01,969
Twenty, 19.

366
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:04,424
Oh, my God!- Good morning.

367
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:06,496
I'd better go.

368
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,905
Sleep all right?

369
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:14,859
Lint brush.

370
00:53:15,473 --> 00:53:16,930
Thank you.

371
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:19,347
Will you come back?

372
00:53:21,304 --> 00:53:22,685
Do you want me to?

373
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,523
You still need to take my portrait.

374
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:35,804
Tell me a secret.

375
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:40,868
I wanna live in a big house someday.

376
00:54:41,098 --> 00:54:42,786
Out of the city.

377
00:54:43,515 --> 00:54:46,699
With a big back yard and a dog.

378
00:54:47,274 --> 00:54:49,806
Leaving Manhattan gives me hives.

379
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,333
Tell me another secret.

380
00:54:56,174 --> 00:54:59,205
I actually had a dream we
were gonna have another baby.

381
00:54:59,972 --> 00:55:01,392
A baby?

382
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:03,425
Huh.

383
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:08,373
Now it's your turn. What's your secret?

384
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:13,476
I think I'm ready to take some
time off from the business.

385
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,430
Really?

386
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:18,463
What are you gonna do instead?

387
00:55:19,038 --> 00:55:22,107
I'd like to take some photographs...

388
00:55:22,337 --> 00:55:23,987
...of my own.

389
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:25,752
Of what?

390
00:55:27,478 --> 00:55:29,204
I don't know.

391
00:55:30,509 --> 00:55:32,427
Our neighbors.

392
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:37,222
Good. Yeah.

393
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,212
I think that sounds great.

394
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:45,278
Allan?

395
00:55:48,002 --> 00:55:49,230
Is it okay?

396
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:51,723
Sweetheart, it's wonderful.

397
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,562
Thanks, sweetheart.

398
00:56:27,324 --> 00:56:28,781
Where you going?

399
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:31,697
Just up to the neighbors. I...

400
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,843
I thought I'd try Mrs. Rebushong first.

401
00:56:35,188 --> 00:56:37,183
Eat your broccoli, Sophie.

402
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:02,195
Who is she?

403
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:06,569
She is, uh, Althea.

404
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,065
Oh.

405
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:12,400
Uh, she's, uh...

406
00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:15,008
...an admirer.

407
00:57:15,238 --> 00:57:17,732
An admirer?- Yes.

408
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:20,763
Who does she admire?

409
00:57:25,635 --> 00:57:27,054
At me, I guess.

410
00:57:28,397 --> 00:57:30,315
Why isn't she your girlfriend?

411
00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:33,959
Well...

412
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:37,450
She doesn't touch me.

413
00:58:08,601 --> 00:58:10,519
Goddamn it.

414
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:40,403
Hey.

415
00:58:40,595 --> 00:58:42,283
I'm here.

416
00:58:47,347 --> 00:58:48,843
Lionel?

417
00:58:54,137 --> 00:58:55,787
Lionel?

418
00:58:56,247 --> 00:58:58,280
I'm here for the picture.

419
00:58:58,856 --> 00:58:59,891
I'll be right there.

420
00:59:03,728 --> 00:59:05,262
Hi.

421
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:11,247
Take off your camera.

422
00:59:12,283 --> 00:59:14,891
-We're going out. 
- Now?

423
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,221
Come on.
