1
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,195
"Past the age of fifty, Velasquez
stopped painting definite things.

2
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,149
He hovered around objects
with the air, with twilight,

3
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,914
catching in his shadows
and airy backgrounds...

4
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,752
the palpitations of colour...

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,437
which formed the invisible core
of his silent symphony.

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,875
Henceforth, he captured only...

7
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,830
those mysterious interpenetrations
of shape and tone that form a constant,

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,275
secret progression,

9
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,799
neither betrayed nor interrupted
by any jolt or jar.

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,355
Space reigns supreme.

11
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,592
It is as if an aerial wave,
sliding over the surfaces,

12
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,152
soaked up their visible emanations,
defined and modeled them,

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,233
then spread them about like a perfume,

14
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,391
an echo of themselves,

15
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,838
a scattering of impalpable dust.

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,159
The world he lived in
was one of sadness:

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,790
a degenerate king, sickly infantes,

18
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,749
idiots, dwarfs, cripples,

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,037
a handful of clownish freaks
dressed up as princes,

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,840
whose function it was
to laugh at themselves...

21
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,197
and to amuse a cast
that lived outside the law,

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,718
in the meshes of etiquette,
plots and lies,

23
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,589
bound by the confessional and remorse,

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,118
with the inquisition
and silence at the door."

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,351
Listen to this, little girl!

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,397
"A spirit of nostalgia pervades his work,
yet he avoids what is ugly, sad,

27
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,474
or cruelly morbid
about those oppressed children.

28
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,597
Velasquez is the painter of evening,

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,230
of open spaces and of silence,

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,951
even when he painted in broad
daylight or in a closed room,

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,318
even with the din of battle
or of the hunt in his ears.

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,796
As they seldom went out during the day,

33
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,918
when everything was drowned
in torrid sunshine,

34
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,039
the Spanish painters
communed with the evening."

35
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,873
Beautiful, isn't it, little girl?

36
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,554
You're crazy to read her
things like that!

37
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,473
Off to bed, sleepyheads!

38
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,394
Why are they still up?

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,395
Because you sent the maid
to the movies...

40
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,358
for the third time this week!

41
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,909
Sure, I did.

42
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,312
They're showing Johnny Guitar...
good for her education.

43
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,118
We see too many squares.

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,830
Hurry up! Frank and Paola
will be here any minute.

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,751
I'm not going.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,992
I've decided to stay home
with the children.

47
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,874
No! Frank is bringing his niece.

48
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,873
She can baby-sit till we get back.

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,634
She's a student.

50
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,555
Since when has he got a niece?
I'll bet she's a call girl.

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,552
I'm not going.

52
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,310
You'll do as you're told!

53
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,917
He's the president of Standard Oil
and papa will introduce you.

54
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,118
And I'll sue the TV people
for firing me.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,116
When someone finds you a job,
you might be good enough to take it!

56
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,710
Aren't you wearing a slip?

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,953
No! I'm wearing my new
Maidenform girdle... it's invisible!

58
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,436
In my new trousers I've got
that young look with Maidenform!

59
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,910
After Athens,

60
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,592
after the Renaissance, we are now
entering the civilization of the rump!

61
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,799
Let me show you...

62
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,712
She loves the children.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,117
If anything comes up, call us at...
What number?

64
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,510
225-70-01

65
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,796
This is Frank's niece.

66
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,869
Can't you say Balzac 70-01? You don't
know Balzac? Read César Birotteau!

67
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,873
With the 5th Symphony
pounding in his poor head!

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,759
- What's eating you?
- Let's go, daddy-o!

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,592
Chapter Two

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,991
A party at the home of Mr. & Mrs.
Expresso, whose daughter is my wife.

71
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,159
The new Alfa-Romeo,

72
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,995
with its four-wheel disc brakes,

73
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,038
Luxurious interior
and road-holding ability,

74
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,555
is a first-rate "gran turismo":

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,439
safe, fast and pleasant to drive,

76
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,592
with quick get-away
and perfect balance.

77
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,839
It's easy to feel fresh. Soap washes,
cologne refreshes, perfume perfumes.

78
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,911
To combat under-arm perspiration,

79
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,119
I use Odorono after my bath
for all-day protection.

80
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,639
Odorono comes in spray-bottle, aerosol
(it's so fresh!), stick or roll-on.

81
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,232
But the Oldsmobile 88 has
even more to offer:

82
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,838
its rigorous design,
powerful, sober lines,

83
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,678
and exclusive elegance...

84
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,708
are proof that beauty is compatible
with red-hot performance.

85
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,278
You seem to be alone.

86
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,068
He's American. He can't speak French.

87
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,669
My fluffy hair-do...

88
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,118
kept its shape all day
thanks to a cloud of Aquanet.

89
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,469
Now the lacquer brushes out
with effortless strokes.

90
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,479
Soft...

91
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,393
My hair is like so many blond
silk threads!

92
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,793
Shimmering!

93
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,159
Clean!

94
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,595
Women must give up filmy negligees...

95
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,592
and romantic style nightgowns.

96
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,998
Out of doors or in bright light, lingerie
loses its charm and becomes indecent.

97
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,950
Olympio's melancholy

98
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,232
Give me the keys to the Lincoln.

99
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,072
You're leaving?

100
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,117
I'm tired.

101
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,836
I've got a machine to see with,
called eyes.

102
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,316
To hear with, I've got ears.

103
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,596
To talk with, a mouth.

104
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,075
But they feel like separate machines,
there's no unity.

105
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,678
A person ought to feel unified.

106
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,548
I feel like I'm divided up.

107
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,192
You talk too much,
it makes me tired just listening.

108
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,396
You're right... I talk too much.

109
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,029
A man alone always talks too much.

110
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,917
I'll wait for you at home.

111
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,152
Next chapter:

112
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,233
Despair... Memories and freedom...

113
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,948
Bitterness... hope...

114
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,111
Remembrance of things past.

115
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,316
Marianne Renoir

116
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,233
You're still here?

117
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,554
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,551
You've missed the last métro.

119
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,358
I know.

120
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,958
You're alone?

121
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,869
I was bored, so I came home.

122
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,110
Anything wrong? You look depressed.

123
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,353
There are days like that...
You meet nothing but squares.

124
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,998
So you start to look in the mirror...

125
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,516
and have doubts about yourself.

126
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,117
Come on, I'll take you home.

127
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,359
Frank lent you his car?

128
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,592
Yes... Don't you like American cars?

129
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,193
Sure...

130
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,718
- Funny, our meeting again like this.
- Yes...

131
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,754
It's been four years.

132
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,596
No, five and a half, and it was October.

133
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,549
You're married?

134
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,793
I found an Italian girl with money.
But she doesn't really interest me.

135
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,155
Why don't you divorce?

136
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,198
Yes, I wanted to once.

137
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,876
I was alive then... I've gone to seed.

138
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,157
To want something,
you have to be alive.

139
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,709
Do you still teach Spanish?

140
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,839
No... I'm in TV. But I gave it up.

141
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,152
- What about you?
- Oh, nothing special.

142
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,960
- You don't want to talk about yourself?
- No...

143
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,953
Two years ago
a friend of mine saw you in London.

144
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,191
Are you still with that American?

145
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,237
That was finished a long time ago.

146
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,790
Have you known Frank long?

147
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,118
No... I just ran into him.

148
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,590
Mysterious as ever, I see.

149
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,191
No, I just don't like
to talk about myself.

150
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,318
OK... so we'll stop talking.

151
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,629
...garrison massacred by the Viet Cong...

152
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,871
who lost 1 1 5 men.

153
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,430
Awful, isn't it? So anonymous...

154
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,874
What is?

155
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,272
They say "1 1 5 guerrillas"
and it doesn't mean a thing to us.

156
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,957
Yet each one is a man,
and we don't even know who he is.

157
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,430
We don't know if he loves his wife,
if he has kids,

158
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,433
if he prefers movies or plays.

159
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,151
We don't know anything.
All they say is "1 1 5 killed".

160
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,839
It's like photographs.
They've always fascinated me.

161
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,598
You see a snapshot of a guy
with a caption underneath.

162
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,195
He was a coward, maybe, or a nice guy.

163
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,635
But at the time when it was taken...

164
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,078
no one can say exactly
what he was thinking about.

165
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,754
His wife? His mistress?

166
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,878
The past? The future?
A basketball game?

167
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,236
Nobody will ever know.

168
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,596
That's life for you.

169
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,231
Yes... that's what makes me sad:
life is so different from books.

170
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,558
I wish it were the same:

171
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,918
clear, logical, organized...

172
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,557
Only it isn't.

173
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,510
Yes it is...
a lot more than people think.

174
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,478
No, it isn't, Pierrot.

175
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,000
My name's Ferdinand...
I won't tell you again!

176
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,199
I know... but you can't say
"My friend Ferdinand".

177
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,228
You can if you want to, Marianne.

178
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,833
I want to.

179
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,195
I'll do anything you want.

180
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,831
Me too, Marianne.

181
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,755
I'm putting my hand on your knee.

182
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,112
Me too, Marianne.

183
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,435
I'm kissing you all over.

184
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,192
Me too, Marianne.

185
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,713
We'll see...

186
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,548
Marianne... Renoir

187
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,430
Rise up, Lazarus!

188
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,996
- You see? I was right.
- What about?

189
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,549
You didn't believe
we'd always be in love.

190
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,078
No, I didn't... I never told you
I'd love you all my life

191
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,117
Oh my love

192
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,630
You never swore to adore me all your life

193
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,318
We never made promises like that,
knowing me

194
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,676
Knowing you

195
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,549
We never thought
we ever would be caught by love

196
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,439
Fickle as we were

197
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,557
And yet, and yet, step by step

198
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,753
Without a word between us.
Bit by bit

199
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,152
Feelings slipped
between our merry mingled bodies

200
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,392
And words of love rose to our naked lips.
Bit by bit

201
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,629
Lots of words of love began to mingle

202
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,919
Gently with our kisses.
How many words of love?

203
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,596
I never would have thought
I'd always want you

204
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,876
Oh my love

205
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,468
We never would have thought we two
could live together and not get bored

206
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,390
Wake up every morning and be
just as surprised to be just as happy

207
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,870
In the same bed

208
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,953
Desire nothing more
than that oh so banal pleasure

209
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,192
Of feeling so good to be together

210
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,717
And yet, and yet, step by step

211
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,272
Without a word between us.
Bit by bit

212
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,877
Our feelings bound us tight in spite
of ourselves, bound us tight forever

213
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,755
Feelings stronger than any words of love

214
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,718
Known or unknown

215
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,790
Feelings so wild and so strong

216
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,919
Feelings we never thought
were possible before

217
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,029
Don't ever promise to adore me
all your life

218
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,510
Let's not make promises like that,
knowing me

219
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,876
Knowing you

220
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,549
Let's keep the feeling
that this love of ours

221
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,234
This love of ours

222
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,948
Will be short and sweet

223
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,910
We'll know when we're dead. In 60 years,
we'll know if we were always in love.

224
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,230
That's not true. I know I love you.

225
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,438
But I'm not sure about you.

226
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,156
I do, Marianne, I do.

227
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,153
Well, I'll know soon enough.

228
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,117
Your wife was here this morning.

229
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,078
I don't give a damn!

230
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,355
That's not all.

231
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,068
I don't give a damn, I said.

232
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,713
- Marianne tells
- Ferdinand

233
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,075
- a story
- all mixed up

234
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,914
- I knew some people
- like in the Algerian war

235
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,357
- I can explain it all
- escape from a bad dream

236
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,236
- Frank had the keys?
- I can explain it all

237
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,391
- were you in love?
- I can explain it all

238
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,598
- did he kiss you?
- I can explain it all

239
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,635
- a story
- all mixed up

240
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,075
- leave in a hurry
- escape from a bad dream

241
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,072
- I knew some people
- politics

242
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,799
- an organization
- get away

243
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,678
gun-running

244
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,075
in silence...in silence

245
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,634
in silence

246
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,550
- it's me... Marianne
- he kissed you

247
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,915
- a story
- all mixed up

248
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,957
- I knew some people
- you were in love

249
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,953
- use my apartment
- the Algerian war

250
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,191
- my brother
- escape from a bad dream

251
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,477
leave in a hurry... Leave in a hurry...
Leave in a hurry

252
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,755
- answer
- clobber him

253
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,750
- argument
- garage

254
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,876
- who is it?
- down south

255
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,792
- get away
- no money

256
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,239
It was time to leave
that rotten world anyway.

257
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,199
We left Paris by a one-way street.

258
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,032
Recognizing two of her children,

259
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,556
the Statue of Liberty
gave us a friendly wave.

260
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,912
Put a tiger in my tank.

261
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,149
We don't sell tigers.

262
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,039
Then fill 'er up and shut up, Jack!

263
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,552
If it's me, he won't suspect.

264
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,756
That'll be 49 francs.

265
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,436
Water and oil, pal!

266
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,557
Help me, dope!

267
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,079
Christ! Another one!

268
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,029
I remember a trick
from Laurel and Hardy. Get in!

269
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,712
- Shame on you! You haven't any money?
- No, sir.

270
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,394
Then get a job.
Don't you want to work?

271
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,789
No, sir, we don't.

272
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,349
Then how are you going to pay me?

273
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,960
Christ! There's still one left!

274
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,032
Call the police.

275
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,277
- Sum-total:
- it was an adventure film

276
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,839
Necklace of blood

277
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,559
- Sum-total:
- Tender is the night.

278
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,156
It was a love-story.
It was a love-story

279
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,789
- Tender is the night.
- It was a love-story.

280
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,873
We'll find my brother eventually.

281
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,639
Just what kind of smuggling is he in?

282
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,235
Oh... things in Africa.

283
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,110
Angola... The Congo...

284
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,069
I thought he did TV shows
in Monte Carlo?

285
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,117
Yes... that too.

286
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,315
Let's decide where we're going.

287
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,592
We said we were going to Nice...
then maybe Italy.

288
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,229
We haven't enough money to get to Nice.

289
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,914
We'd better dump this Peugeot.

290
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,871
Did you ever kill a man, Pierrot?

291
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,715
My name's Ferdinand.
Why do you ask?

292
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,673
Because I can tell
it's going to turn your stomach.

293
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,875
I wonder what she told the cops.

294
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,952
Maybe she hasn't seen them yet.

295
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,997
That's rich, Fitch!

296
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,152
She told them
everything she could to hurt you!

297
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,158
She did right.

298
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,078
Anyway, I'm sorry for her sake.

299
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,833
Sorry?

300
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,194
Men like you are always sorry.

301
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,156
But it's always too late.

302
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,433
What are you doing?

303
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,795
Looking at myself.

304
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,599
And what do you see?

305
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,469
The face of a man who's about to drive
over a cliff at 60 mph.

306
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,878
I see the face of a girl...

307
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,193
in love with the man who's about to drive
over a cliff at 60 mph.

308
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,079
Then let's kiss.

309
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,190
The next day

310
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,392
The next day

311
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,196
- we find the Peugeot
- entering a town in central France

312
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,396
- with its tank
- almost empty.

313
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,629
- Marianne
- and Ferdinand

314
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,189
- stop at a bar
- and order drinks

315
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,192
- wondering
- how to pay for them.

316
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,991
- Their descriptions are on the radio.
- People stare at them suspiciously.

317
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,438
- Their descrip...
- People stare at them suspiciously.

318
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,635
The people are:

319
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,996
Lazlo Kovaks, student;

320
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,677
born January 25, 1 936...

321
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,319
at San Domingo;
forced to flee the American invasion.

322
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,599
Now residing in France
as a political refugee...

323
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,197
France: the land of liberty,
equality and fraternity.

324
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,830
Viviane Blassel,
born March 21, 1 943 in Marseilles.

325
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,592
Uh... I'm 22, I work
at Auxerre Emporium, perfume counter.

326
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,312
Eté, André, born May 25, 1 903
in Marbouie (Eure et Loire).

327
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,872
Age: 62... Present occupation:
motion picture extra.

328
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,429
Let's tell stories.

329
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,033
The right words may move them.

330
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,998
- What stories?
- Anything at all.

331
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,677
The Fall of Constantinople, or the story
of Nicolas De Stael and his suicide.

332
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,638
Or the one about William Wilson:

333
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,316
He saw his double in the street
and wouldn't rest till he'd killed him.

334
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,916
When it was done,
he realized he'd killed himself,

335
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,037
and it was his double who was left.

336
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,794
OK, maybe they'll give us some money.

337
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,600
Marianne had the eyes
of both Romeo and Juliet,

338
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,037
so she told them about William
of Orange's nephew, Vivien,

339
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,068
who died fighting 30,000 Saracens.

340
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,950
He bled from 1,000 wounds and he fought
alone, for he'd sworn not to retreat.

341
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,239
Oh, young and gentle nephew,
why such a mad, noble oath?

342
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,111
Ferdinand told them
the story of Guynemer,

343
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,952
but they didn't listen.

344
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,839
Then he spoke of the summer,

345
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,755
and of how lovers
crave the warm night air.

346
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,709
He spoke of man, and the seasons,
and unexpected encounters.

347
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,877
But he told them never to ask
which came first,

348
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,999
words or things...
nor what comes next.

349
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,437
I feel alive,
and that is all that matters.

350
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,513
I've got an idea!

351
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,913
We'll fake an accident.

352
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,994
The police will think we're dead.
OK, Pierrot?

353
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,355
My name's Ferdinand!

354
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,433
- All we have to do is...
- What?

355
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,194
...burn the car!
They'll think we burned too!

356
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,671
- Always fire, blood and war!
- It wasn't my idea!

357
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,512
Bring it closer.

358
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,189
It's got to look real.
This isn't a movie.

359
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,392
Closer, hurry up!

360
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,075
No matches... Let's go.

361
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,880
That's OK, give me the rifle.

362
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,638
The same make that killed Kennedy!

363
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,190
Sure, didn't you know it was me?
Get out of the way.

364
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,509
Wait a minute...

365
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,639
Pretty, isn't it?

366
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,952
- You know what was in that suitcase?
- No... what?

367
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,158
The dollars you were looking for
in the flat.

368
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,630
Poor idiot! I'll bet
you didn't tell me on purpose.

369
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,313
That's right.

370
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,673
Think what we'd have done
with all that money!

371
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,198
We'd have gone to Chicago... Las Vegas...
Monte Carlo... You poor idiot!

372
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,510
I'd have gone to Florence and Athens.

373
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,228
Let's go...
Travel broadens the mind!

374
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,599
- Chapter Eight.
- A season in hell.

375
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,479
- Chapter Eight.
- We crossed France

376
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,278
- like shadows
- through a mirror.

377
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,030
- Like shadows
- through a mirror.

378
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,795
I saw the café where Van Gogh
decided to cut off his ear.

379
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,191
- You're a liar. What did you see?
- I saw...

380
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,758
Look, Pierrot, a Ford Galaxy.

381
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,709
My name's Ferdinand.
Yes, that's the '62 model.

382
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,513
- Show me that you're a man.
- Wait till I finish this.

383
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,072
"After eating up a good many miles,
they came to the Bayorda desert,

384
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,357
which they had to cross
to reach Karthum.

385
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,795
'Darn! Not much shade!'
they grumbled,

386
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,998
as they set out across the sand
under a burning sun.

387
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,789
'We'd be a lot better off
in the cool shade of a glass of lager!"'

388
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,032
Make up your mind or I'll hitchhike!

389
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,555
Let's go, daddy-o!

390
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,797
A grease-job.

391
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,678
Where's the lavatory?

392
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,310
Hey, kid! How'd you like
to own a car like this?

393
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,151
Very much!

394
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,072
Well, you never will.

395
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,669
Marianne, the jacket!

396
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,075
Hey, kid! How'd you like
to earn 1 00 francs?

397
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,796
The landscape rose slowly before us.

398
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,953
Countless centuries fled
into the distance, like so many storms.

399
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,232
Get rid of our clothes
while I turn around.

400
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,917
Heigh-ho, the Rover Boys!

401
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,354
Hurry!

402
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,035
- Well?
- Nothing special.

403
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,114
They questioned her.

404
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,148
She said she saw us naked in my bed.

405
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,755
You see? And you called me a liar!

406
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,274
Anything else?

407
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,239
Still interested in your wife, eh?

408
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,398
Nothing at all.

409
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,598
I can't understand it!
He's gone crazy!

410
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,030
Leave a woman and she'll claim
you're off your nut.

411
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,033
Oh, men are the same way.

412
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,433
That's true.

413
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,753
What's more, I'm beginning
to smell the odor of death.

414
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,110
Go ahead and say you miss her!

415
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,157
Cut it out!
You get on my nerves!

416
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,153
No... the smell of death
in the landscape, the trees,

417
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,152
in women's faces, in cars...

418
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,198
We're going to be
in a hell of a fix without money.

419
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,237
We can't even get to Italy.

420
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,959
We can just stop anywhere.

421
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,597
We can stop anywhere.

422
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,910
And what will we do all day?

423
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,755
No, let's find my brother first,
he'll give us lots of dough.

424
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,518
Then we'll find ourselves
a high-class hotel and have some fun!

425
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,433
- All she thinks about is fun!
- Who're you talking to?

426
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,113
The audience.

427
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,596
I told you so...
You're already sorry.

428
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,912
- You were crazy to do this.
- No, I'm in love.

429
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,878
It's the same thing.

430
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,436
I've decided never to fall in love again.

431
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,238
It's a disgusting habit!

432
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,232
Don't say that!

433
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,073
Don't say that!

434
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,074
Ten minutes ago, I saw death everywhere.
Now it's just the opposite:

435
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,874
Look at the sea, the waves, the sky...

436
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,957
Life may be sad,
but it's always beautiful!

437
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,714
Suddenly I feel free.
I can do what I want when I want!

438
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,635
Look! Left... right... Left... right...

439
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,279
Look at the crazy little man!

440
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,593
He's driving down a straight line
and he has to follow it all the way!

441
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,512
Yeah? Just watch this!

442
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,235
Chapter Eight

443
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,040
- A season in hell.
- Love needs to be reinvented.

444
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,350
Real life is something else.

445
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,112
Countless centuries fled
into the distance, like so many storms.

446
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,397
I held her close and I started to cry.

447
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,755
It was our first,

448
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,470
our only dream.

449
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,030
Coming?

450
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,553
Where?

451
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,520
To the mysterious island,
like Captain Grant's children.

452
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,399
- And do what?
- Nothing. Just exist.

453
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,837
- It doesn't sound like much fun!
- That's life.

454
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,395
It's a good thing I don't like spinach,

455
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,596
because if I did, I'd eat it,

456
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,115
and I can't stand the stuff.

457
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,032
It's the same with you,

458
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,676
only the other way round.

459
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,312
There was a film like that with
Michel Simon. He got taken by this girl...

460
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,553
- Well, you wanted to start life over!
- I didn't mean to be nasty.

461
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,836
You said we'd see it
through to the end.

462
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,230
Yes... to the end of the night.

463
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,629
What a good view of the moon!

464
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,794
I don't find it so special.

465
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,476
I do... I see a man up there.

466
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,599
Maybe it's Leonov,
or that American... White.

467
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,711
Yes, I see him too.

468
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,589
But it's not a Rusky
and it's not a Yank.

469
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,432
- You know who it is?
- Who?

470
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,830
It's the moon's only inhabitant.

471
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,959
And you know what he's doing?
Running away as fast as he can.

472
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,519
Why?

473
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,988
- Look.
- Why?

474
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,876
Because he's fed up.
When he saw Leonov land, he was glad.

475
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,792
I'll bet! Someone to talk to at last!

476
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,713
He'd been all alone for an eternity.

477
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,714
But Leonov tried to stuff
his head with Lenin.

478
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,589
When White, the American, landed,
he fled to his camp.

479
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,549
But as soon as he saw him,
White jammed a Coke into his mouth...

480
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,552
and made him thank him first!

481
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,835
So now he's fed up.

482
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,516
The Americans and Russians
can shoot it out; he's going away.

483
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,909
- Where?
- Here.

484
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,869
Because he thinks you're lovely...

485
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,351
He admires you.

486
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,158
He thinks your legs...
and your breasts... are very moving.

487
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,353
Be quiet...

488
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,192
Chapter Seven

489
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,750
- A poet named revolver
- Robert Browning

490
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,194
- get away
- never

491
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,510
- beloved
- as long as I'm me

492
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,909
and you're you

493
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,072
as long as the universe
will hold the two of us

494
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,039
- l, who love you
- and you, who reject me

495
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,636
- as long as we want to run
- it's too much like fate

496
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,355
Any creature,
faced with nature, will believe.

497
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,074
We live by hunting and fishing.
Tuesday: nothing

498
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,079
Eyes: human landscapes... Mouth:
onomatopoeia that end up as language

499
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,436
Ruins beget the language of poetry

500
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,352
The writer chooses to appeal...
freedom of others

501
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,073
- Did you get all the books?
- No... But I found this:

502
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,548
It's by someone with your name.

503
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,633
- Oh, Ferdinand.
- You've heard of him?

504
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,357
"l was fire, I was light,
I was miracle.

505
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,434
I could no longer hear...
I was rising...

506
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,718
I passed... through the air..."

507
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,632
It's too much!

508
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,469
"l saw happiness... in front of me...

509
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,029
Supernatural emotion!

510
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,239
And then,

511
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,394
I lost all sense of awareness...

512
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,269
I went forward...
a bit with my hands...

513
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,630
and I dared... to the right...

514
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,918
I touched... softly...

515
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,957
the hair of my good fairy...

516
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,191
of my adorable miracle...

517
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,919
Virginia."

518
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,199
Guignol's Band.
OK... Now, are you coming?

519
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,033
"Perfect happiness!

520
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,434
Ah! my ecstasy was so intense...

521
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,830
that I dared not move.

522
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,231
Crying with happiness,
smitten with happiness...

523
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,472
I quivered, quivered...

524
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,795
My heart could swell and burn me...
I didn't care... I, too, was flame.

525
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,476
I was in space, I clung to Virginia."

526
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,870
Give me that.

527
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,310
"You promised me China and Tibet,
Mr. Sosthène,

528
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,349
you promised me the Sunda Islands
and wonderful, magic plants...

529
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,955
So where are they?

530
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,759
Cham-cham-cham... ratatam...
I caught him up in his lies."

531
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,796
What's today?

532
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,029
Friday.

533
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,998
You'll never leave me?

534
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,468
Of course I won't.

535
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,073
Of course?

536
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,913
Of course...

537
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,472
Yes... of course.

538
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,672
Thursday: poetry is a game
of loser take all

539
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,154
What am I to do?

540
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,949
I don't know what to do!

541
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,909
What am I to do?

542
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,750
I don't know what to do!

543
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,835
What am I to do?

544
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,673
I don't know what to do!

545
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,638
Silence! I'm writing!

546
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,397
"That is the basic problem...

547
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,710
You're waiting for me...
I'm not there...

548
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,269
I arrive... I enter the room...

549
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,830
That's when I really start
to exist for you...

550
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,799
But I existed before that...
I had thoughts...

551
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,076
I may have been suffering...

552
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,791
So the problem is to show you alive,
thinking of me,

553
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,476
and at the same time, to see me alive
by virtue of that very fact."

554
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,312
Underlined.

555
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,196
Still thinking about your brother
and that gun business?

556
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,596
Why do you look so sad?

557
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,989
Because you talk to me with words,

558
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,959
and I look at you with feelings.

559
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,074
Conversation with you is impossible.

560
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,029
You never have ideas, only feelings.

561
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,034
That's not true!
Feelings contain ideas!

562
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,558
OK... Let's try to have
a serious conversation.

563
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,678
You tell me what you like,
what you want...

564
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,638
and I'll do the same.

565
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,916
OK, you start.

566
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,673
Flowers,

567
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,798
animals,

568
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,518
blue skies,

569
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,718
the noise of music,

570
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,156
I don't know... everything!
What about you?

571
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,033
Ambition,

572
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,959
hope,

573
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,159
the motion of things,

574
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,112
accidents,

575
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,910
uh.. what else?... well, everything!

576
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,479
See? I was right five years ago.

577
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,595
We never understand each other.

578
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,028
What am I to do?

579
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,157
I don't know what to do!

580
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,350
What am I to do?

581
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,875
I don't know what to do!

582
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,075
What am I to do?

583
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,155
I don't know what to do!

584
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,153
Sunday... she opened the...
then... Monday

585
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,548
How's the old man?

586
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,392
Fair to middling.

587
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,632
I've got an idea for a novel.

588
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,358
Instead of being about people's lives...

589
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,549
it would be about life,
life as a thing in itself,

590
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,318
what lies between people... space,

591
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,791
sound, and colors.

592
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,914
That would be something worthwhile.

593
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,759
Joyce made a try at it,

594
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,437
but it should be possible...
to do better.

595
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,318
I've got your books.

596
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,028
Those aren't the right ones!

597
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,430
There's one missing.
I said five.

598
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,911
I bought a little record... Look.

599
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,278
I said a record every fifty books!
Literature before music!

600
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,554
If you don't like it, little man,

601
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,478
Little mouse, it's on the house!

602
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,557
What's eating you?

603
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,151
I can make rhymes, too, stupid!

604
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,159
What's the matter?

605
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,958
I'm fed up!

606
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,033
I'm sick of the sea
and the sun and the sand!

607
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,350
I'm sick of eating out of tin-cans!

608
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,875
I'm sick of wearing the same dress!

609
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,872
I want to leave this place.

610
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,318
I want to live.

611
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,630
What do you want me to do?

612
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,230
I don't know... I want to go away.

613
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,393
Anyhow, I threw away
the rest of our money.

614
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,390
Where?

615
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,835
In the sea, idiot!

616
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,476
You're crazy, Marianne!

617
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,870
If we're to leave here,
we'll need money.

618
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,395
There're lots of tourists
from the mainland...

619
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,076
We can rob them... Come on, Pierrot.

620
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,390
My name's Ferdinand.

621
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,637
Oh, come on! We've played
Jules Verne long enough!

622
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,872
Let's go back to our gangster movie,

623
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,590
with fast cars and guns
and night-clubs.

624
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,432
Come on!

625
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,600
Wait for me, Marianne!

626
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,951
Do you really have a brother?

627
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,397
You never believe me, do you?

628
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,673
If we do find Fred and he gives us dough,
why don't we go to Miami Beach?

629
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,635
- You're a coward at heart.
- No...

630
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,111
"Courage consists in staying home,
close to Nature,

631
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,476
for she is oblivious to our disasters."

632
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,280
Hurry, or the tourist boat will leave.

633
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,715
Wait! I've got an idea...

634
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,713
Give me your lipstick.

635
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,233
"At bottom,

636
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,551
the only thing of any interest...

637
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,713
is the road that people follow.

638
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,869
The tragic part is that once they know...

639
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,033
where they're going and who they are...

640
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,555
everything else is still a mystery."

641
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,791
Like the scent of eucalyptus.

642
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,996
- That's it... "eucalyptus."
- You bet!

643
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:08,076
"And that mystery,
forever unsolved, is life."

644
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,437
- Get a move on, Paul!
- Shut up, Virginia!

645
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,353
We are the dead on furlough.
And the trees?

646
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,954
To earn some money,

647
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:55,037
we drew for the tourists
(modern slaves)

648
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,310
Damn! Americans!

649
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,228
That's OK, we'll change our politics.

650
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,317
We can put on a play.
Maybe they'll give us some dollars.

651
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,632
- What play?
- I don't know. Something they'll like.

652
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,633
I've got it! The Viet Nam war!

653
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,029
Uncle Sam's nephew
versus Uncle Ho's niece

654
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,236
A little something for the actors.

655
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,393
Hurray for Kennedy!

656
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,673
We've lost them. Let's go home.

657
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,956
I'm going dancing.

658
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,749
No, come on... You can go tomorrow.

659
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,197
Next chapter: despair

660
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,635
- No, I'm staying here.
- OK, I'll go back alone.

661
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,630
Hope

662
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,756
You do that.

663
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,149
Remembrance of things past

664
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,871
I hear there's a dance-hall
across the water.

665
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,951
I'm going dancing.

666
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,869
If we get killed, it's just too bad.

667
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,398
They'll catch up with us... so what?

668
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,750
Tuesday, I wanted
to buy a record-player.

669
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,436
But he spent all our money on books.

670
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,591
Actually, I don't give a damn.

671
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,795
But he can't even begin to see that.

672
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,396
I don't give a damn about books...

673
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,037
or records, either.
I don't even care about money.

674
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,636
I just want to live.

675
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,915
But he'll never understand that.

676
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,673
I want to live.

677
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,633
My fate-line is short as it can be

678
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,958
My fate-line is short as it can be

679
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,239
My palm is such an ill-fated thing

680
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,519
I'm afraid of what tomorrow may bring

681
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,039
My fate-line, my fate-line

682
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,756
Darling, what do you think
of my fate-line?

683
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,276
What does it matter?
It's fine, just fine

684
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,991
But your thigh-line is more in my line

685
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,791
My fate-line

686
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,759
I love to hold it in my lap

687
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,792
Your thigh-line!

688
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,076
My fate-line!

689
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,312
It's another feather... in my cap!

690
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,710
Just look at my little fate-line

691
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,954
Just look at my little fate-line

692
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,079
Just look at destiny's call

693
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,199
So small you can hardly see it at all

694
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,274
My fate-line, my fate-line

695
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,990
Darling, what do you think
of my fate-line?

696
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,755
What does it matter?
It's fine, just fine

697
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,197
Give me your hand and don't say a word

698
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,677
- Your thigh-line
- My fate-line

699
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,480
Your hand is like a morning bird

700
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,510
- Your thigh line
- My fate-line

701
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,957
Frivolous bird, harbinger of fate

702
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,508
My fate-line, my fate-line

703
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,150
Darling, what do you think
of my fate-line?

704
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,915
What does it matter?
It's fine, just fine

705
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,630
Every morning I'm the happiest man

706
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,829
- Your thigh-line
- My fate-line

707
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,992
A bird is singing in my hand

708
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,550
- Your thigh-
- line...

709
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,916
- My fate-
- line...

710
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,115
Maybe I'm daydreaming...

711
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,151
She reminds me...

712
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,273
of music.

713
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,159
Her face...

714
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,433
We have come to...

715
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,198
the age of double men.

716
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,358
We don't need mirrors any more
to talk to ourselves.

717
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,195
When Marianne says:

718
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,998
"It's a fine day",

719
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,276
I wonder what she's thinking.

720
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,395
All I have is that image of her...

721
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,473
saying: "It's a fine day."

722
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,312
Nothing else.

723
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,869
What's the point of figuring it all out?

724
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,635
We are made of dreams,

725
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,516
and dreams are made of us.

726
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,835
It's a fine day, my love,

727
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,193
in dreams, in words and in death.

728
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,756
It's a fine day, my love,
it's a fine day...

729
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,513
in life.

730
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,632
- You know what I think?
- I don't give a damn!

731
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,393
Now let's not start that again!

732
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,150
I told you to leave me alone!

733
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,794
Anyway, I'm not starting again,
I'm continuing.

734
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,434
- Oh, damn!
- What?

735
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,916
Damn! Damn! Damn!

736
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,912
What's the matter?

737
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,798
I've got a subject of a novel for you.

738
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,950
Someone is walking around Paris...

739
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,758
and suddenly he sees Death.

740
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,833
So he goes south
to avoid running into Him,

741
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,753
because he figures
his time hasn't come yet.

742
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,434
He drives all night at top speed,

743
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,672
and the next morning,
when he reaches the sea-shore,

744
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,517
he has a crack-up and dies...

745
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,991
just when he thought
Death had lost his trail.

746
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,512
- Let's hurry.
- There's plenty of time.

747
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,637
No... I'm scared.

748
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,639
Stay here.

749
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,478
- Small world, isn't it?
- What do you want?

750
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,513
I'll be back in five minutes.

751
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,318
Want me to beat him up?

752
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,438
I can handle him.

753
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,712
I have to find Fred, Pierrot.

754
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,599
My name's Ferdinand. OK, OK...

755
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,270
- Two beers.
- Two.

756
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:07,153
That way, when I've finished one,
I'll still have one left.

757
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,159
Remember me?

758
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,678
You stayed at my place last year.

759
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,911
I lent you 1,000 francs.

760
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,193
- You went to bed with my wife.
- Yes, that's right.

761
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,908
- So now you're in the south, eh?
- That's right.

762
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,435
- Everything OK?
- Fine.

763
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,952
Are you Mr. Griffon?

764
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,554
My name's Ferdinand...
Yes, it's me.

765
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,358
I'm scared.

766
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,996
They're off their nuts.

767
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,711
I swear it's not a gag.

768
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,956
Tell me where the money is... or else!

769
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,553
We'll give you electric shocks...

770
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,394
the way they did during the war.

771
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,194
Or else,

772
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,397
Viet Nam style,

773
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,311
we'll undress you,

774
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,912
put you in a bath-tub
full of napalm,

775
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,909
and set fire to it!

776
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,754
No, right away! Please!

777
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,514
Yes, anything you want.
I'll be nice to you again.

778
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,319
So come quick!

779
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,992
We'll walk up.

780
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,879
A glorious death for a little man.

781
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,439
What are you doing here?

782
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,558
I heard a noise. I live downstairs.

783
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,279
Hit him.

784
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,676
We'll use that trick of yours.

785
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,395
Resistance is useless.

786
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,313
What'd you do with the money
in the Peugeot?

787
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,073
Yeah... in the bath-room.

788
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,232
The trick you learned in...

789
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,677
We'd better not forget
about the yacht!

790
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,592
Hey, there aren't any towels!

791
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,513
Use that little whore's dress.

792
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,159
Just press it to his face
so the water will cut off the air.

793
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,198
To make it easier for you,
I'll tell you all I know.

794
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,989
Then all I want
is the answer to one question.

795
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,710
I know your name
is Ferdinand Griffon.

796
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,111
I know you were with Marianne
when she stabbed Donovan...

797
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,709
and ran off with my $50,000.

798
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,757
Fee fi fo fum!

799
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,395
Personally, I've nothing against you.

800
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,679
I'm almost sure Marianne dragged
you into this. That's your business.

801
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,672
As I was saying...

802
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,714
I'm not interested in you,
but I want her.

803
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,952
Now, tell me where to find her...
and the money.

804
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,398
This is your last chance...
Tell me, or we'll kill you.

805
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,119
Fee fi fo fum.

806
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,359
The "Marquise" dance-hall.

807
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,591
Either that's the truth or it isn't.

808
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,718
But he looks so dopey
that I doubt he'll say any more.

809
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,473
Let's go have a look.

810
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,511
"Marquise" dance-hall.

811
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,476
Ah, what a dreadful five
in the afternoon!

812
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,355
I do not want to see it!

813
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,558
Ah, what a dreadful five
in the afternoon!

814
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,670
I do not want to see it!

815
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,956
I do not want to see it!

816
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,192
Ah, what a dreadful five
in the afternoon!

817
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,197
- Next, we find Ferdinand arriving in...
- Toulon.

818
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,398
He strolls along the waterfront.
He is staying...

819
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,073
at the Little Palace Hotel.

820
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,753
- He looks for
- Marianne,

821
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,037
but doesn't find her.
The days go by.

822
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,875
Some afternoons,
he sleeps in all-day movies.

823
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,031
He still keeps a diary.

824
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,238
For words can lighten the shadows

825
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,835
around the thing they designate

826
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,036
even if it is degraded in everyday life.

827
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,271
Words retain only what is pure.

828
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:51,114
In Viet Nam, the Da Nang base,
a major US stronghold,

829
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,998
was raided by the Viet Cong.

830
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,879
7 planes were destroyed
on the ground.

831
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,235
In the jungle,

832
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:02,554
US soldiers fought side by side for the
first time with South Vietnamese forces...

833
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,308
against Viet Cong guerilla units.

834
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,638
Despite this increased activity,
and the Commonwealth mediation failure,

835
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,714
Harold Wilson still offers
to help promote negotiations.

836
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,471
That was all there was to it?

837
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,234
Yes, he turned away...

838
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,229
and left me bewildered.

839
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,629
It was up to me to decide...

840
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:51,029
when the imaginary character
had given way...

841
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,875
to the real one
if there ever was a real one.

842
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,034
I am Princess Aïcha Abadie,

843
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:08,114
and in spite of my fragile,
doll-like appearance,

844
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,999
I am a very strong-minded woman!

845
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,755
I do not like people to resist me,
I want to be obeyed!

846
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,115
Your orders, ma'am?

847
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,998
I am Lebanese by adoption.

848
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,677
In 1 960, I married the Emir Abadie,

849
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,789
and I am Queen of Lebanon in exile,
for, as you know, my country...

850
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,076
is now a Socialist Republic.

851
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,709
I am therefore in Nice incognito,

852
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,157
as my husband and l
have terrible enemies.

853
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,631
There are prices on our heads
in Lebanon.

854
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,714
I am often the target
of machine-gun fire...

855
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,396
which always misses me,
no doubt because of Allah's protection.

856
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,631
In order to marry the Emir,

857
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,996
I had to convert to the Moslem faith.

858
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:56,836
I have flown to Beyrouth twice
in my husband's space machine.

859
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,077
Well, Alexis? Please keep me...

860
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:06,556
from flying away, the sea is choppy,
and you know how light I am.

861
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,434
Help me, Ferdinand.

862
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,640
Ferdinand, we weigh anchor in an hour.

863
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,596
Yes, Princess.

864
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,434
Alexis, take me into town.

865
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,189
Pierrot!

866
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,108
It's me!

867
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,512
My name's Ferdinand... Hi.

868
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,032
You don't seem surprised to see me.

869
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,238
How'd you get here?

870
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,473
I'm so glad I've found you at last!

871
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,632
- Where are you staying?
- With you, idiot!

872
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:19,953
I'm staying with you.
I looked for you everywhere!

873
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,952
Why didn't you wait for me?

874
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,792
I wanted to...

875
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,317
but I only just got away
before those men came.

876
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,996
Then I ran to the dance-hall
to tell you not to come,

877
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,196
but you weren't there,

878
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,551
so I went back

879
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,951
and I saw those other men
getting into the blue Ford.

880
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,919
And I thought they'd killed you.

881
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,670
So I went away... I didn't care where...

882
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,436
I don't even remember where...
I was afraid to go back to the sea-shore.

883
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:02,679
Then one day I ran into Fred in a bar.

884
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,912
I swear I did!
The Las Vegas bar, in Toulon!

885
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:09,470
- How'd you know I was here?
- By accident.

886
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,712
It's the truth, you know...

887
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,831
I believe you, liar...

888
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,674
Why don't you ever believe I love you?

889
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,990
I do love you... in my own way.

890
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,832
That's true.

891
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,634
I can prove it.

892
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,112
Look... I went back to our beach
and got your notebook.

893
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,713
Thanks.

894
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,116
Look at the last page.

895
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,631
There's a little poem about you.
I wrote it.

896
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,749
"Tender... and cruel...

897
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,272
Real... and surreal...

898
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,319
Terrifying... and funny...

899
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,519
Nocturnal and diurnal

900
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,435
Toward and untoward

901
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,591
- Handsome as anything
- Crazy Pierrot..."

902
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,638
My name's Ferdinand!
I told you so before, God damn it!

903
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,270
If you think it suits you to say
"God damn it"...

904
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,233
God can go to...

905
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,596
Don't talk like that.

906
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:13,033
You can talk! We're wanted for murder!
You know what a murder is?

907
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,750
Sure I know... So what?
Does it scare you?

908
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,873
Well, answer me...

909
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:23,869
I'm looking at you, I'm listening to you,
but that's not what counts.

910
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,348
Well, thanks a lot!

911
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,309
No... I mean right this moment,
but it's already gone...

912
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:34,839
It's... oh, I don't know... the color
of the sky... our relationship...

913
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,718
I don't get it.

914
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,270
I wish time would stand still.

915
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,349
Look... I put my hand on your knee.

916
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,308
That's a wonderful thing in itself...
That's life.

917
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,717
Space... feelings...

918
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:57,233
Instead, I'm coming with you...
back to our tale of sound and fury.

919
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,709
Actually, I don't care.

920
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,552
Come on... Fred's waiting.

921
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,758
OK, forget it... Let's go, daddy-o.

922
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,077
I wonder what's keeping the cops.
We should be in jail by now.

923
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,233
They're smart...
They let people destroy themselves.

924
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,477
Why do you do things like that?

925
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:47,156
But I tell you I didn't kill him!

926
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,314
It's funny we've survived
all that killing.

927
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,073
Yeah... funny... ha ha ha.

928
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,799
Just like in Pepe-le-Moko.

929
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,393
Who?

930
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,270
- Pepe-le-Moko.
- Who's that?

931
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,875
Wow! You really don't know much!

932
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,708
What about you?
Do you know what you are?

933
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,155
I am homosexualis.

934
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,193
Says you!

935
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,668
I know who you are...
But you don't know.

936
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:38,597
That's true. I'm just a huge question mark
overlooking the Mediterranean.

937
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,352
Are your parents still alive?

938
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,751
Yes, and they've never been separated.

939
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,514
Once, they were almost separated.

940
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,073
Papa was taking a trip somewhere...

941
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,276
A little trip.

942
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,032
They didn't have enough money
for 2 tickets...

943
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,279
Mama went with him to the bus-stop...

944
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,551
And they looked at each other:

945
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,156
papa in the window,
mama on the pavement.

946
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,879
And just as the bus started,
papa got off in a hurry:

947
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,190
he didn't want to leave mama.

948
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:33,389
And while he was getting off in front,
she was getting on in back,

949
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,756
because she didn't want to leave him.

950
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,275
Finally, papa gave up his trip.

951
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,159
What did you do in that shop?

952
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,870
Oh, I watched people's faces.

953
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,032
- Where was it?
- Galeries Lafayette.

954
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,518
Why all these questions?

955
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,671
I want to know exactly who you are.

956
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,070
I never knew... Not even 5 years ago.

957
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:00,389
Oh, I'm just a sentimental girl,
that's all.

958
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,514
What a fool you are
to make a mystery of that!

959
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:09,039
What's your brother do? I never know
when you're making things up!

960
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,512
Oh... my brother...

961
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,876
What was he doing in Tel Aviv?

962
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,478
Listen... at the moment
there's a war in Yemen...

963
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,154
You don't know anything!

964
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,672
He gets money from the Royalists...

965
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,957
What about those other men?
The Arab League?

966
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,679
Who knows? Probably...

967
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,150
Is there really a troop of dancers?

968
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,278
What do you care?

969
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:40,435
Why does he need a cover? Nowadays,
gun-running is practically official!

970
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,234
- What do you care?
- Answer me!

971
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,118
Listen:

972
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:50,836
there are 3,600 seconds in an hour.

973
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,759
That makes
about 1 00,000 seconds in a day.

974
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:59,757
In an average lifetime, that makes...

975
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,596
250 billion seconds!

976
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,720
All in all, the two of us
have been together for a month.

977
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:16,798
Add it all up! You'll find I've only been
with you a couple of million seconds...

978
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,430
out of the 250 billion
that go to make up your life.

979
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:25,039
That's not much...
So I'm not surprised that I don't know...

980
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,191
who you are, either.

981
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,112
- Is he willing?
- He'll do anything I want.

982
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,036
What a crazy set-up!

983
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,318
What am I supposed to do?

984
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,758
You'll do as you're told.

985
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,878
Just keep your eyes and ears open.

986
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,715
Remember the scent of eucalyptus?

987
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,758
- With you, it's always mixed up.
- No, everything is simple.

988
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,069
Too much at once

989
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,309
No...

990
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,437
A little harbor, as in Conrad

991
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,513
A sail-boat,
as in Robert Louis Stevenson

992
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,149
An old brothel, as in Faulkner

993
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,075
A steward-turned-millionaire,
as in Jack London

994
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,713
- With you, it's always mixed up.
- Everything's simple.

995
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,678
- Too much at once
- No...

996
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:04,993
Two men who beat me up,
as in Raymond Chandler

997
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,391
and you... and me... and him...
see how simple it is?

998
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,709
I don't see at all.

999
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,109
- They want to
- buy the yacht.

1000
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,429
- The old man
- isn't French.

1001
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,238
- My brother
- collects the money.

1002
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,913
- The others
- don't know.

1003
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,229
- They'll be
- furious.

1004
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,596
They tail Fred...
we get rid of them.

1005
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,751
- And then?
- You'll do as you're told!

1006
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,997
It's easy for a girl
to kill a lot of people.

1007
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,232
There's no reason
why soft breasts and thighs...

1008
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:01,792
should keep her from killing everybody
to stay free or defend herself!

1009
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,079
Just look at Cuba...
or Viet Nam... or Israel.

1010
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,869
- I love you!
- Me too.

1011
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,076
Next chapter: despair

1012
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:36,677
Next chapter: freedom...
bitterness...

1013
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,716
Seen a girl who looks
like a movie star?

1014
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,512
None of your business.

1015
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,752
- Is it all there?
- Yes...

1016
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,356
- We all meet tonight as planned?
- Yes...

1017
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,471
Some people saw me.

1018
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,549
I don't understand.

1019
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,995
That way, it'll look like Fred's
in the clear.

1020
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,231
Why are you double-crossing me?

1021
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,999
What's the matter?

1022
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,835
Nothing... I'm looking
at a woman who's hurting me.

1023
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,311
$50,000 would make anyone nervous,
Pierrot.

1024
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,278
My name's Ferdinand.

1025
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,312
Why did you kiss me just now?

1026
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,551
Because I felt like it.

1027
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:49,117
- Kiss me again.
- Not here.

1028
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,755
Why do you wear such tight slacks?

1029
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,437
If you don't like it,
go back to Paris.

1030
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,678
Kiss me.

1031
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,712
OK, I get it.

1032
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,873
You know, it's not healthy
to double-cross us.

1033
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,633
"Be quiet, Cassandra."

1034
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,075
- What?
- It's the title of this book.

1035
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,833
You poor idiot!

1036
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,909
Listen...

1037
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,312
- Marianne!
- What?

1038
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:23,634
TWA - Nice airport - 2:45 PM plane for
Tahiti... We just have to climb aboard.

1039
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,271
Just the two of us...

1040
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,272
Obviously.

1041
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,312
Obviously.

1042
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,513
Words are funny...

1043
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,718
They say the opposite of what they mean.

1044
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:45,316
We say "obviously"
when things aren't obvious at all.

1045
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,950
Like it wasn't obvious to me
that I'd find the old man...

1046
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,078
with a bullet-hole in his forehead.

1047
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:56,269
- Did you know your brother'd kill him?
- It was none of my business.

1048
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,750
I'm willing to run away with you,

1049
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,798
but Fred will find us and get even.

1050
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,793
I saw him get even with a girl once.

1051
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,758
I'll protect you.

1052
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,437
OK. But I have to go alone
or they'll suspect.

1053
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,908
OK, beautiful.

1054
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,673
OK, handsome.

1055
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,869
Well...

1056
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:23,113
I'm off, since we've nothing more to say.

1057
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,237
Meet me in half an hour.

1058
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,708
No...

1059
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,958
I'll count to...

1060
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,432
1 37...

1061
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,792
You're really crazy.

1062
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,275
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1063
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,159
What about the case?

1064
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:50,359
Start the car. Trust me,
and I'll trust you. 1 8, 1 9, 20...

1065
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,993
1 06, 1 07, 1 08, 1 09, 1 1 0...

1066
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,879
Anything wrong?

1067
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,714
It's... it's that tune.

1068
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,195
You can't imagine
what it means to me.

1069
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,793
That tune... hear it?

1070
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:10,235
No, I don't hear a thing.

1071
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,195
You wouldn't understand...

1072
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,352
That tune's my whole life!

1073
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,917
When I hear it...
it does something to me!

1074
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:24,199
One day I was at home,
it was on the radio...

1075
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,472
She was sitting beside me...
she was beautiful...

1076
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,351
I took her hand, like this...

1077
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,388
And I stroked the back of it,
like this...

1078
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:46,199
I asked her: "Do... you... love... me?"

1079
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,558
She said: "No!"

1080
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:56,154
So I bought the record,
because that music got me!

1081
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:01,433
A case of mass hysteria
all by myself!

1082
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:05,912
One day, at home,
I put on the record...

1083
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:12,713
It went round and round in my head!
Everything was spinning!

1084
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:16,631
She was beside me...
Not the same woman, another one...

1085
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,269
Not as pretty as the first...

1086
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,159
But what can you do?

1087
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,796
I took her hand...

1088
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:31,433
and stroked it... on the other side,
this time... I wanted a change.

1089
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,510
I asked her: "Do... you... Love... me?"

1090
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,029
And she said: "Certainly".

1091
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:47,748
But I didn't love her.
So I broke the record!

1092
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:55,668
One day, I turned on the radio
and it was playing.

1093
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,434
Why that? Why not something else?

1094
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:02,673
She was beside me... on the other side:
it was her house.

1095
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,951
Still another woman...

1096
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,831
I took her hand

1097
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,674
and stroked it. On both sides,
just to get it over with...

1098
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:13,832
This thing was getting on my nerves!

1099
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:17,072
I asked her: "Do... you... Love... me?"

1100
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,956
She said: "Yes, sir."

1101
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,679
I asked her:
"Will you give me your hand?"

1102
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,639
She said:
"You've had it for ten minutes."

1103
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:31,348
She was right...
"You're right," I said.

1104
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,832
So I kept it.

1105
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,758
I kept it ten years!
I can't stand that tune any more!

1106
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,312
Do you hear it?
I can't stand it any more! Hear it?

1107
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,709
No.

1108
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,634
That one, right there...
You can't hear it?

1109
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,359
No.

1110
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,554
Tell me... am I crazy?

1111
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,153
Come right out and say it!

1112
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,075
I'd like to hear you say it...
Say: "You're crazy!"

1113
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,392
- You're crazy.
- Well, that's more like it.

1114
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,271
- Going to the island?
- Yes, sir.

1115
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,114
- What's your boat called?
- Howa.

1116
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,469
"Howa you"!

1117
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,552
Then that tune I hear
doesn't exist?

1118
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,273
The tune I've been hearing all my life?

1119
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,114
That tenderness?
No! Insensitive man!

1120
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:46,029
You missed the whole point!

1121
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,230
Do you love me?

1122
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:01,796
I held her close and began to cry.

1123
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:05,835
It was our first, our only dream.

1124
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:30,470
I want to make a call to Paris.

1125
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,594
Balzac 75-02.

1126
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:37,433
So you've forgotten Balzac, too?

1127
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,952
Yes... I'll wait.

1128
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,319
It hurts.

1129
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,470
You brought it on yourself.

1130
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,911
You brought it on yourself.

1131
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,913
Please forgive me, Pierrot...

1132
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,158
My name's Ferdinand.

1133
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,318
It's too late.

1134
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,915
Yes... I'm waiting.

1135
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:03,588
Balzac 75-02?

1136
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,436
Is Mrs. Griffon there?

1137
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,588
Who is this?

1138
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,593
The maid?

1139
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,837
How are the children?

1140
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,710
Nobody's calling!

1141
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,559
death

1142
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:04,552
... what I wanted to say...

1143
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,873
Why?

1144
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:09,270
This is silly...

1145
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,358
- It's ours again
- What is?

1146
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,670
- Eternity
- No, that's just the sea

1147
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,558
And the sun

1148
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:02,639
Remerciements au ministère
des affaires étrangères.
