00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
[Man]
what can you say

2
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,053
about a 25-year-old girl
who died?

3
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,059
That she was beautiful
and brilliant?

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,064
That she loved
mozart and bach...

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,567

00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,586
Do you have the waning of the middle ages?

You have your own
library, preppie.

8
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,590
Would you answer
my question?

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,592
Would you
answer mine first?

10
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,094
Look, we're

I am not talking legality, preppie.
I'm talking ethics.

13
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,100
Harvard's got
five million books,

14
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,102
and radcliffe's got
a few loussy thousand.

15

24
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,128

What's polyphony?

30
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,147
Nothing sexual,
preppie.

31
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,650
Look, miss cavilleri,

32

I'm having coffee with a harvard building.

41
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,168
You're barrett hall.

42
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,669
I'm not barrett hall.

43
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,672
My great-grandfather happened
to give the thing to harvard.

44
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,674
So his not-so-great
grandson

45
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,676
would be able to
get in.

46
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,179
If you're so convinced
i'm a loser,

47
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,182
why did you bulldoze me
into buying you coffee?

48
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,684
I like your body.

49
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,694

Barrett's slipping.

369
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:57,755
It's amazing.

370
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,759
Huh?

371
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,762

Oliver?

375
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,779
Hmm?

00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:36,473
i can't believe
how great you were.

380
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:38,976
That tells me what you know about music.

381
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:40,477
I know enough.

382
00:24:40,477 --> 00:24:43,480
Wise up. I was not
great or all-ivy.

383
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,482
I was just o.k.,
o.k.?

384

O.k.

385
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:50,988
i mean, you should
always keep at it.

Yeah. I've never
been to europe.

393
00:25:06,503 --> 00:25:08,005
I can hardly wait.

394
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:10,507
How long have you
known about this?

395
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:13,010
Come on, ollie,
don't be stupid. It's inevitable.

396
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,511
What is?

397
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:16,513
That we'll go
our separate ways

398

What are you
talking about?

00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:22,019
You're a preppie
millionaire,

401

and i'm
a social zero.

402
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,523
What does that have to do
with separating?

403
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:27,524
We're happy.

00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:30,527

the holiday's over--

this has been more
than a holiday.

Because.

reason.

00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:14,131
Yeah, right.

438
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:19,136
Never.

Don't worry, jenny.
It'll be a breeze.

No.

going soon.

Why are you so uncomfortable with your parents?

486
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:42,637
What gave you
that impression?

487
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:44,639
Why did you
want to leave

the minute
we got there?

they were treating you.

are in, jennifer?"

of his firm?

So your people come
from cranston, jenny.

498
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,662
Well, mostly.

499
00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:09,664
My mother came
from fall river.

500
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:11,666
The barretts have mills
in fall river.

501
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,669
Where they exploited the new
england poor for generations.

502

In the 19th century.

00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,172
When you inherit,
oliver,

504
00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:21,175
you can give all our money back as reparations.

505
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:24,679
Well, that's exactly what the
philosopher saint-simon advocated.

506
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,681
In the 18th century.

507
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:30,685
It's getting late.

508
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:31,686
For what?

509
00:31:31,686 --> 00:31:33,688
You're staying for dinner,
aren't you?

510
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:34,689
No. Yes.

511
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:36,190
No. I've got to
get back.

512
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,192
Nonsense. You're staying
for dinner,

513
00:31:38,192 --> 00:31:39,694
and that's an order.

514
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:41,195
Everything is
an order,

515
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,197
a directive,
a command.

516
00:31:43,197 --> 00:31:45,700
Where is your
sense of humor?

517
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,702
You know,
when i was in school,

518
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:50,204
he used to send me
memos. Memos!

519
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:52,707
I mean, don't you
find that rather odd?

520
00:31:52,707 --> 00:31:54,208
I find it
rather cute.

521
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:59,714
Tell me, oliver, have you heard
from law school?

522
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:02,216
Uh, no, sir, not yet.

523
00:32:02,216 --> 00:32:04,719
He'll get in.
Who is better than oliver?

524
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,220
I quite agree.

525
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,223
He's bound to be graduated
with honors.

526
00:32:09,223 --> 00:32:11,225
Oliver has always done well in school.

527
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:12,727
At exeter,
he was the very--

528
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:14,228
it doesn't mean
a thing.

529
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:17,231
A lot of guys are trying
to get into law school.

530
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:19,734
I could give
price zimmerman a ring--

531
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,235
no!

532
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:23,738
I mean,
please don't, sir.

533
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:26,240
Merely to find out
if he knows.

534
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,244
I want to get my letter
with everyone else, please.

535
00:32:32,747 --> 00:32:35,249
He was only trying
to be helpful.

536
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,753
But, jenny, i don't need
that kind of help.

537
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:40,254
O.k.

538
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:41,756
no, it's not o.k.!

539
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:43,758
He's not going to
be satisfied

540
00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:45,760
till he cuts them off.

541
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,261
What?

542
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:49,764
What you wouldn't like
to be cut off.

543
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:52,767
Oh...

544
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:55,269
well, we've got to
take care of those.

545
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:56,771
Take care, you two!

546
00:32:56,771 --> 00:32:58,272
Drive with caution,
oliver.

547
00:32:58,272 --> 00:33:01,275
Get there a minute later,
but get there.

548
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:09,784
You really like to bug your father,
don't you?

549
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:12,286
The feeling's mutual,
or haven't you noticed?

550
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:14,789
I didn't think you'd stop at anything

551
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:17,291
just to get
to your old man.

552
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:19,794
It's impossible to get
to oliver barrett iii.

553
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:22,296
Unless maybe...

554
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:25,299
if you marry
jennifer cavilleri?

555
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:31,305
[Tires squeal]

556
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:32,807
is that what you think?

557
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:35,810
Yes, i think
it's part of it.

558
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:38,813
Jenny, you don't believe
i love you?

559
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:41,816
Yes, but in a crazy
sort of way,

560
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:43,818
i think
you also love

561
00:33:43,818 --> 00:33:45,319
my negative
social status.

562
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,821
No.

563
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:49,323
Listen, i can't pass
judgment, oliver.

564
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:50,825
I just think so.

565
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:52,326
I mean...

566
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:54,829
i know that i love
not only you,

567
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:57,331
but your name
and your numeral.

568
00:33:57,832 --> 00:34:00,334
After all, it's part
of what you are.

569
00:34:00,835 --> 00:34:02,837
Oh, how can you do it?

570
00:34:02,837 --> 00:34:04,338
What?

571
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,843
How can you see me
and still love me?

572
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:11,846
That's what
it's about, preppie.

573
00:34:20,354 --> 00:34:21,856
[Tires squeal]

574
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:43,878
how are you, son?

575
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:45,379
Oh, i'm o.k.

576
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:46,881
o.k., sir.

577
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:49,383
Did you hear
from law school?

578
00:34:49,383 --> 00:34:51,385
Yes. I called you,
remember?

579
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:53,387
Oh, yes, yes.
Congratulations.

580
00:34:53,387 --> 00:34:56,891
You'll be the first barrett
on the supreme court.

581
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:59,393
Oh, i may just chase
ambulances instead.

582
00:34:59,393 --> 00:35:00,895
Yes, fine.

583
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:02,396
How's raymond?

584
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:04,899
He's fine.
Got into o.c.s.

585
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:06,400
army?

586
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,902
Mm-hmm.

587
00:35:07,902 --> 00:35:09,403
That's good.

588
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:10,905
That's bad.

589
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,409
You haven't
mentioned jennifer.

590
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:16,911
What's there to say?

591
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:20,414
You're presenting us with afait accompli,
are you not?

592
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:22,366
But what
did you think?

593
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:23,918
I think
she's absolutely charming,

594
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:27,421
and i think for a girl
from her background

595
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:29,924
to get all the way
to radcliffe is--

596
00:35:29,924 --> 00:35:31,425
get to the point.

597
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:33,928
The point doesn't concern
the young lady.

598
00:35:33,928 --> 00:35:35,930
It concerns you.
Your rebellion.

599
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,431
Ah.

600
00:35:37,431 --> 00:35:39,433
And you are rebelling,
oliver.

601
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:40,935
[Loudly]
i fail...

602
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:43,938
[quietly] i fail to see how marrying

603
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:46,440
a beautiful and brilliant radcliffe girl

604
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,942
constitutes
rebellion.

605
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:50,945
I mean, she's not
some crazy hippie.

606
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:52,446
She's not many things.

607
00:35:53,948 --> 00:35:55,449
What irks you
most, father?

608
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:57,952
That she's catholic
or that she's poor?

609
00:35:57,952 --> 00:36:00,404
What attracts you most?

610
00:36:00,404 --> 00:36:01,956
I'm leaving.

611
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:04,458
Don't go off
half-cocked, damn it!

612
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:07,962
I would only ask
that you... wait a bit.

613
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:09,463
Define "bit."

614
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:10,965
Finish law school.

615
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:12,466
If this thing is real,

616
00:36:12,466 --> 00:36:14,969
it will stand
the test of time.

617
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:16,971
I don't see why
i have to put it

618
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:18,422
to some
arbitrary test.

619
00:36:18,422 --> 00:36:19,974
Because
i'm asking you to.

620
00:36:19,974 --> 00:36:21,475
You're
commanding me!

621
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:22,977
Oliver,

622
00:36:22,977 --> 00:36:24,478
if you marry her now,

623
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:27,481
i'll not give you
the time of day.

624
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:31,485
Father, you don'tknow the time of day.

625
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:41,996
[Clock chiming
the hour]

626
00:36:57,011 --> 00:36:58,512
we're, uh,
looking forward

627
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:01,515
to having you
with us next year.

628
00:37:01,515 --> 00:37:03,517
Me, too,
dean thompson.

629
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:05,019
Uh, something's come up.

630
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,521
Not a change
of heart, i hope.

631
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:11,025
No, no, i'm still set
on law school, but...

632
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:14,028
[chuckles] i'm going to need a scholarship.

633
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:17,031
Really?

634
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:19,533
That's why i'm here.

635
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:21,035
That's, uh--

636
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:22,536
well, that's
rather curious,

637
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:24,538
considering
your background.

638
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:27,541
I'm not his son anymore.

639
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,543
I beg your pardon?

640
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:31,545
Well, uh...

641
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:33,547
we have had a--

642
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:35,549
a misunderstanding.

643
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,551
It's a parting
of the ways.

644
00:37:39,553 --> 00:37:40,554
This is...

645
00:37:41,055 --> 00:37:43,057
very unfortunate,
mr. Barrett.

646
00:37:43,057 --> 00:37:45,559
I am not exactly
jumping for joy.

647
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:48,062
Yet, uh,
we have many entering students

648
00:37:48,562 --> 00:37:50,064
in far worse straits
than you.

649
00:37:50,564 --> 00:37:53,067
What's worse than the straits of destitution?

650
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:55,569
Dean thompson,
i'm getting married next month.

651
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:58,072
Now, we're both going to
work all summer,

652
00:37:58,072 --> 00:38:00,574
and then jenny's
going to take a job

653
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:02,076
in a private school,
teaching.

654
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:04,078
That's a living,
but it's not tuition.

655
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:05,579
Your tuition
is pretty steep.

656
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:08,582
Yes.

657
00:38:10,084 --> 00:38:12,086
Dean thompson,
i need a scholarship.

658
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:14,588
I'm a harvard magna.
I've already been accepted.

659
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:16,590
I don't have any money
in the bank.

660
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:20,094
You have
a millionaire father.

661
00:38:20,094 --> 00:38:21,595
Had, dean, had.

662
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:23,097
Why should i be
penalized

663
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,599
because i was once
related to a rich man?

664
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,101
Uh, mr. Barrett,

665
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:30,104
i really don't think
that this office

666
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:31,605
should enter
into a...

667
00:38:31,605 --> 00:38:33,607
family quarrel?

668
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:36,110
A rather distressing one,
at that.

669
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,611
I see.

670
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:39,113
Thank you.

671
00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:41,115
Uh...

672
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:42,616
perhaps...

673
00:38:42,616 --> 00:38:44,118
at midyear--

674
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,621
thank you.

675
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:50,124
You've been very generous
with your time.

676
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,133
[Jenny] we just passed my junior high school!

677
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:02,052
[Oliver] i can't believe he liked my instant poverty.

678
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:03,554
He did, i swear.

679
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:05,639
At least now you've got something in common.

680
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:08,642
God, when i first told him oliver barrett--

681
00:39:08,642 --> 00:39:10,644
yeah? Yeah?

682
00:39:10,644 --> 00:39:13,147
I mean, he just
couldn't believe it.

683
00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:14,648
He kept
reminding me

684
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:16,150
of the 11th
commandment.

685
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,651
11th?

686
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:20,154
"Do not bullshit
thy father."

687
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:23,157
Any other commandments
i ought to know about?

688
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:24,658
Yeah. "Stay loose."

689
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:30,664
[Children shouting]

690
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:40,674
[dog barking]

691
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,183
so, is he for it?
Does he approve?

692
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:50,684
What do you think?

693
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:52,186
[Phil]
i won't allow it!

694
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:54,188
I won't allow it!
Get me?

695
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:55,689
You're tilting
at windmills, phil!

696
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,692
Stop referring to his father as a windmill.

697
00:39:58,692 --> 00:40:00,694
He's a distinguished
citizen of boston--

698
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:01,695
mr. Cavilleri--

699
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:03,197
phil.
My name is phil.

700
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:06,200
I'll call his goddamn father.
I'll go to boston!

701
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:08,702
It won't do any good,
goddamn it!

702
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:11,205
Would you please not use profanity in this house?

703
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:12,706
You do.

704
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:14,708
What the hell
will he think?

705
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,210
That you've lost
your marbles.

706
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,712
Because i won't allow
a parent to reject a child?

707
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:19,746
Mr. Cavilleri--

708
00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:21,715
phil. Ha ha ha!

709
00:40:21,715 --> 00:40:23,217
Phil.

710
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,718
Phil, sir,

711
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:26,720
i reject him, too.

712
00:40:26,837 --> 00:40:28,722
Now, don't talk
like that, oliver.

713
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:31,725
A father's love is something
to cherish and respect.

714
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:33,227
It's a rare thing.

715
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:34,728
Especially
in my family.

716
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:36,730
Let's get him
on the phone.

717
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,233
No, no. You see,
my father and i

718
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,734
have installed
this cold line.

719
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:43,237
He'll thaw, oliver.
He'll thaw, and he'll melt.

720
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:45,739
Believe me, when it's time
to go to church--

721
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,741
let's get him
on the phone.

722
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:49,243
Uh, wait. Phil.

723
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:51,245
What?

724
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:52,746
Um,

725
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,248
about
the church bit.

726
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:57,251
Well, we're kind of
negative on it.

727
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:01,755
Oh. Ha ha!

728
00:41:01,755 --> 00:41:05,759
Well, i-- i didn't necessarily m-mean the catholic church.

729
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,261
I, uh--

730
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:10,764
you-- you know
that, uh,

731
00:41:10,764 --> 00:41:12,266
jennifer
is catholic.

732
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:14,768
She may have
told you that.

733
00:41:14,768 --> 00:41:17,271
And her...
sainted mother

734
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,773
always dreamed
of a--

735
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:21,775
well, the whole
mass rigmarole,

736
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:23,777
but-but you're--

737
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:28,732
well, god would bless this union in any church.

738
00:41:28,815 --> 00:41:30,284
Uh, phil--

739
00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:31,285
yeah.

740
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:33,287
About the god bit.

741
00:41:33,453 --> 00:41:34,404
Yeah?

742
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,790
Well, we're sort of negative
about that, too.

743
00:41:36,957 --> 00:41:38,292
About god?

744
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:42,296
About anybody's god?

745
00:41:42,296 --> 00:41:43,797
See...

746
00:41:43,797 --> 00:41:46,300
we neither one of us
believe...

747
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,752
and we won't be
hypocrites.

748
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:50,304
Well.

749
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:51,305
Well, uh...

750
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:54,808
if that's
what you wish,

751
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:56,810
just tell me
who performs the wedding.

752
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,762
We do.

753
00:42:02,316 --> 00:42:04,818
You mean,
do-it-yourself?

754
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,820
Huh?

755
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,323
Ha ha! Ha ha!

756
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:10,824
That's, uh--

757
00:42:10,824 --> 00:42:12,326
that's wonderful.

758
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:15,829
I know i'm--

759
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:17,831
i mean, that's--

760
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:19,833
that's... just--

761
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,335
just wonderful.

762
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:26,340
Do-- do it yourself, huh?

763
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:28,342
I think that's...

764
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:29,843
just wonderful.

765
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:32,846
But, uh, tell me.

766
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:35,849
Is-- is it, uh--
what's the word?

767
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:37,351
You mean legal?

768
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:39,353
Legal. Is that it?
Is it?

769
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,856
Yes.
One of the college chaplains just sort of--

770
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:44,808
oh!

771
00:42:44,891 --> 00:42:47,361
No, i mean
he presides over it,

772
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:49,863
and then the man and the woman
address each other.

773
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:52,366
You mean
the bride speaks, too?

774
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:55,369
Ha ha ha!

775
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:57,371
It's a new world,
philip.

776
00:42:57,704 --> 00:42:58,872
Oh, yeah, yeah,

777
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:01,875
it's-- it's-- it's new,
all right.

778
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,391
You two ready?

779
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:18,892
Amen.

780
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:20,394
They haven't
started yet.

781
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:21,895
[Chaplain]
friends--

782
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:23,397
how would i know?

783
00:43:23,397 --> 00:43:25,899
I've never been
to a do-it-yourself.

784
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:27,901
Let us listen
to the words

785
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:29,903
they've chosen to read
on this sacred occasion.

786
00:43:30,153 --> 00:43:31,405
Amen.

787
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:32,906
[Ray]
huh?

788
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:34,908
He said "sacred'"
the priest.

789
00:43:35,275 --> 00:43:37,411
[Ray]
he's not a priest.

790
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:39,413
He is to me.

791
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:54,428
When our two souls stand up erect and strong,

792
00:43:54,428 --> 00:43:56,430
face to face,

793
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,433
silent, drawing
nigh and nigher

794
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:01,935
until the lengthening
wings break into fire

795
00:44:01,935 --> 00:44:03,437
at either curved
point,

796
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,940
what bitter wrong can the earth do to us

797
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,943
that we should not long be here contented?

798
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:11,445
Think.
In mounting higher,

799
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:13,947
the angels
would press on us

800
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:17,951
and aspire to drop some golden orb of perfect song

801
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,953
into our deep,
dear silence.

802
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:23,457
Let us stay rather
on earth, beloved,

803
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:26,960
where the unfit,
contrarious moods of men

804
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,962
recoil away...

805
00:44:28,962 --> 00:44:30,964
and isolate
pure spirits...

806
00:44:30,964 --> 00:44:35,469
and permit a place to stand and love in for a day,

807
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:38,472
with darkness and the death-hour rounding it.

808
00:44:40,974 --> 00:44:42,976
I give you my hand.

809
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:48,482
I give you my love,
more precious than money.

810
00:44:50,484 --> 00:44:53,487
I give you myself before preaching or law.

811
00:44:54,988 --> 00:44:56,990
Will you give me
yourself?

812
00:44:58,992 --> 00:45:00,994
Will you
come travel with me?

813
00:45:02,496 --> 00:45:04,498
Shall we stick
by each other

814
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:05,999
as long as we live?

815
00:45:12,037 --> 00:45:13,538
I, oliver barrett...

816
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:15,540
take you,
jennifer cavilleri,

817
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:20,045
to be my wedded wife
from this day forward...

818
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:26,051
to love and to cherish
till death do us part.

819
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:29,054
I, jennifer
cavilleri,

820
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:31,056
take you,
oliver barrett,

821
00:45:31,556 --> 00:45:33,058
as my wedded husband

822
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:34,559
from this day
forward,

823
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,561
to love
and to cherish

824
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:39,064
till death
do us part.

825
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:54,079
By the authority
vested in me

826
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,580
by the commonwealth
of massachusetts,

827
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:58,083
i pronounce you
man and wife.

828
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:05,590
[Oliver] so i'm being kept by a woman.

829
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,092
[Jenny]
you won't like it.

830
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:08,593
I already do.

831
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:10,095
Oliver,
the shady lane school

832
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:12,597
is only paying me
three thou a year.

833
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:14,099
Why?

834
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:16,101
Because my goddamn name
is mrs. Barrett.

835
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:18,103
Well, couldn't you
be miss cavilleri?

836
00:46:18,103 --> 00:46:20,071
If i was miss cavilleri,

837
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:22,107
i'd be the queen
of paris.

838
00:46:22,107 --> 00:46:24,109
I tell you,
it's a great bargain.

839
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:26,611
Oliver, 4 rooms
for $82.50 a month

840
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:28,613
is impossible
this side of mongolia.

841
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:32,117
Ah, but this is the mongolian section of cambridge.

842
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,625
[Jenny]
gee.

843
00:46:40,925 --> 00:46:43,128
I have to admit
that it's...

844
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:45,630
even worse
than i expected.

845
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,132
Ha ha!

846
00:46:47,132 --> 00:46:48,633
Yeah, but it's home.

847
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,135
Yeah.

848
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:51,636
Well?

849
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,138
Well what?

850
00:46:53,138 --> 00:46:55,640
There's the threshold.
Carry me over it.

851
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,143
You don't believe in that nonsense,
do you?

852
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:00,145
Carry me.
I'll tell you later.

853
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:02,147
We're almost
at the top floor.

854
00:47:02,147 --> 00:47:04,649
O.k., i'll be a young
and beautiful divorcee.

855
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:08,153
Hey, what is this,
barrett?

856
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:09,654
Oh, what is this?

857
00:47:09,654 --> 00:47:12,123
I'll tell you after we cross
the threshold.

858
00:47:12,123 --> 00:47:13,658
Ha ha ha!

859
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:17,662
O.k.?

860
00:47:17,662 --> 00:47:19,164
This is not
a threshold.

861
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:21,166
Well, i see our name
by the bell.

862
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:23,668
Look, it's not an official
goddamn threshold.

863
00:47:23,668 --> 00:47:25,170
Now, upstairs,
you preppie.

864
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:31,676
Why are you
so heavy?

865
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:34,179
Did you ever think
i might be pregnant?

866
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:35,680
Are you?

867
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,182
Ha ha! Scared you,
didn't i?

868
00:47:37,182 --> 00:47:38,683
No, i--

869
00:47:38,683 --> 00:47:39,684
don't bullshit me.

870
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:42,187
Well, yeah,
for a second, i clutched.

871
00:47:42,187 --> 00:47:44,189
Now, is this the official threshold?

872
00:47:44,189 --> 00:47:45,690
What do you think,
huh?

873
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,193
I think if you don't
say yes, i'll--

874
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:50,695
yes! Yes!
Ha ha ha!

875
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:55,260
[Jenny] is there a barrett in the house?

876
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,261
Hey, where are
the kids?

877
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,263
Asleep, thank god!

878
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:01,266
It's siesta time.
I've got 45 minutes.

879
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:03,768
That's more
than they give me.

880
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:05,770
[Boat whistle]

881
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:14,779
[clanking]

882
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,781
oh, damn it.

883
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:19,751
I don't know what's wrong
with this engine.

884
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:21,669
You're
a harvard magna.

885
00:49:21,669 --> 00:49:22,787
Not in mechanics.

886
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:24,789
Welcome to the world,
preppie.

887
00:49:25,206 --> 00:49:26,291
Listen, cavilleri--

888
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:27,792
the name's barrett,
barrett.

889
00:49:28,293 --> 00:49:31,296
Sometimes you are
really a bitch.

890
00:49:38,803 --> 00:49:40,305
How are they
treating you?

891
00:49:40,471 --> 00:49:42,774
Fine, except for
the rittenhouse brat.

892
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:45,310
I swear he'll be breaking and entering before he's ten.

893
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,811
Oh, yeah? What now?

894
00:49:46,811 --> 00:49:48,279
He tried to pinch me.

895
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:50,315
Ha ha!
I don't blame him.

896
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:53,284
Next time he does,
i'm going to wallop him.

897
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:55,820
Jesus, no!
Not until you get his parents' tip.

898
00:49:56,237 --> 00:49:57,822

903
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:09,334
What a thing to say
to your husband.

904
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:11,836
Wash, and you can
touch me afterwards.

905
00:50:11,836 --> 00:50:13,338

906

with miss
anne miller whitman.

908

I hope you laid it on
thick this time.

909
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:23,848
I told her how proud
i was to be a member

910
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:25,850
of the faculty of
the shady lane school.

911
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,852
I said, "you know,
miss whitman,

912
00:50:27,852 --> 00:50:30,355
even barretts
have to pay their rent."

913
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:31,856
To which
she retorted?

914
00:50:31,856 --> 00:50:33,358
"Ho ho ho."

915
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:35,360
Uh,

Uh-uh.
I waited for you.

a growing boy.

Did you check the mail?

932
00:51:54,439 --> 00:51:55,940
Just one second,
jenny.

933
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,442
This is a crucial
precedent.

934
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:07,452
Did you check
the mail?

935
00:52:07,452 --> 00:52:09,454
No, i didn't.
Anything vital?

944
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:30,475
Oliver, i think
it's about time.

945
00:52:30,475 --> 00:52:31,476
For what?

946
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:32,977
You know
very well what.

947

Does he have to
crawl here?

948
00:52:34,979 --> 00:52:36,481
Negative.

949
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:37,982
He's reaching out
to you.

950
00:52:37,982 --> 00:52:39,484
My mother
addressed it.

952

he'll be around

when you're
finally ready

954
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:45,490
for
a reconciliation.

955
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,991
There won'tbe
a reconciliation.

956
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:48,493
Someday when
you're being bugged

he won't be
oliver v!

959
00:52:51,496 --> 00:52:52,997
He can be
bozo the clown,

960
00:52:52,997 --> 00:52:54,499
and he'll still
resent you

961
00:52:54,499 --> 00:52:56,000
because you were
a harvard jock!

962
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,503
You'll probably be
on the supreme court.

963

too, oliver,

you'll love bozo,

968

so proud and competitive

969
00:53:08,012 --> 00:53:10,014

through your whole life

970

each other.

for you!

979

don't think i could.

01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,293
Did you get us
a tree?

1080
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,796
Ah.

1081
01:04:01,163 --> 01:04:02,798
We'll get one
on the way home.

1082
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:09,304
What are you doing
new year's eve?

1083
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,808
Sleeping.

1084
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,315
I thought you wanted
to spend it with me.

1085
01:04:20,515 --> 01:04:22,818
What are you
doing?

1086
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,821
Sleeping.

1087
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:33,328
Someday we're
going to look back

1088
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:35,831
on these days.

1089
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:38,333
The sooner
the better.

1090
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:45,340
[Jenny]
keep running!

1091
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:48,343
Go! Really run!
Come on!

1092
01:04:48,627 --> 01:04:49,845
Keep going!

1093
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,847
Come on! Come on!

1094
01:04:52,214 --> 01:04:53,849
Come on, dan.
Come on.

1095
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:55,350
Hey, jennifer,
come here!

1096
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,352
I'm with children.
Can't it wait?

1097
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:00,355
Jennifer, i said
come here.

1098
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:02,858
What?
Come on!

1099
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,860
Start it over
again.

1100
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,862
What the hell
is it?

1101
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,363
I've got
something important

1102
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:09,865
i want
to tell you.

1103
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:11,366
Couldn't you
tell me over there?

1104
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,368
No. I want to be
alone with you.

1105
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:14,870
O.k.

1106
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,371
fantastic news.
Here. Read.

1107
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,874
Harvard law school?

1108
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:20,876
You got kicked out.

1109
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:22,377
Read it,
will you please?

1110
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:23,879
It's great news.

1111
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:26,381
You were first
in the class?

1112
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,883
Uh, not quite.

1113
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,384
Third.

1114
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:31,887
Only third, huh?

1115
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:33,388
Hey,
but that means

1116
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,890
i make
the law review.

1117
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:39,895
Well, say something,
will you, please?

1118
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:43,899
Not until i've met
numbers one and two.

1119
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:49,905
[Applause]

1120
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:02,417
and the william dejersey
memorial award

1121
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:06,922
for the finest senior essay
to oliver barrett iv.

1122
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:23,939
The family of mark howells,
a.b. '07, l.l.b. '10--

1123
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:25,440
on your feet.

1124
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,891
How much?

1125
01:06:26,891 --> 01:06:28,944
500 big ones.

1126
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:30,445
Holy sh--

1127
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,947
get up.

1128
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,449
Shhh! Quiet!

1129
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:36,451
Come on.
Come on.

1130
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:42,958
The jennifer barrett
maternity award.

1131
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,475
Well, it was
a good apartment

1132
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:01,977
for 80 bucks.

1133
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:03,979
Now our garage
will cost that much.

1134
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:05,981
I don't see why
you'll need your car

1135
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:07,482
in new york.

1136
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:08,984
House calls, jenny.

1137
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:11,486
Fancy lawyers
for jonas and marsh

1138
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:12,988
don't make house calls.

1139
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:14,489
They do
to the houses

1140
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,991
of mr. Jonas
and mr. Marsh.

1141
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:18,493
They are both
close enough to walk.

1142
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:19,995
Jenny,
rich people ride.

1143
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:21,496
Nouveau riche
people.

1144
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:22,998
That's us.

1145
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:24,499
Hey, jenny,
you won't laugh.

1146
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,500
What?

1147
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,002
I'm actually
getting to like

1148
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:28,503
the name bozo.

1149
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:30,005
For what?

1150
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:31,506
For our kid,
damn it--

1151
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:34,509
our huge and bruising
all-ivy tackle.

1152
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:36,011
Bozo barrett?

1153
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:38,513
It's the name of a real harvard superjock.

1154
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,015
You would
actually call

1155
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:42,517
our soon-to-be-conceived
offspring "bozo?"

1156
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:44,519
Only if he's a boy.

1157
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:59,534
We have finally crossed the poverty line.

1158
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,036
Not quite.

1159
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:02,537
Not till you carry me

1160
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,039
over the goddamn
threshold.

1161
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:06,041
I thought we had
run that gamut.

1162
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,542
But you weren't
a lawyer,

1163
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,044
so it wasn't legal.

1164
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:10,545
We live
on the 10th floor.

1165
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,547
You can carry me
in the elevator.

1166
01:08:13,048 --> 01:08:14,049
Thank god for that.

1167
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,052
Can i help you folks?

1168
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:18,553
We've got bags
in the car.

1169
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:20,055
Is the lady
all right?

1170
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:22,057
I will be
when he carries me

1171
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:23,058
over the threshold.

1172
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:24,559
Newlyweds, huh?

1173
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,561
Eternally.

1174
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,563
Move your ass,
preppie.

1175
01:08:39,074 --> 01:08:41,076
You've got it made,
you bastard.

1176
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:43,578
Made in the shade.

1177
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:48,583
Snug as a bug
in a rug.

1178
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,085
Cut the crap
and play.

1179
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:52,087
Working for
jonas and marsh,

1180
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:53,588
pulling in
the coin.

1181
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:55,090
Play, damn it.

1182
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,591
I can't help it.

1183
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:03,098
Married to
foul-mouth angel-face.

1184
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:05,600
Pay attention,
will you?

1185
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,602
Why should you
have all the luck?

1186
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:09,604
Hey, man, it was
a long, hard drag.

1187
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:11,106
This is
the first week

1188
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,607
in our
entire marriage

1189
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,609
that jenny
hasn't had to work.

1190
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,611
So, what's she
going to do?

1191
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,114
I want her to study
at julliard,

1192
01:09:19,114 --> 01:09:21,616
and she wants
to have a baby,

1193
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:23,118
so we're
making babies.

1194
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,123
Do you need
any help, old buddy?

1195
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:31,126
I'll call you
if i need you.

1196
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:52,147
[Horn honks]

1197
01:10:00,104 --> 01:10:02,657
do you know
whose fault it is?

1198
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:06,661
I wouldn't use
the word fault, oliver.

1199
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:09,664
O.k., we'll put it
your way.

1200
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:12,167
Two 24-year-olds

1201
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:13,668
can't seem
to make a baby.

1202
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:15,670
Obviously, one of us
is malfunctioning.

1203
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,172
Who?

1204
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:18,673
Jenny.

1205
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:24,679
All right, then,
we'll adopt kids.

1206
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:27,682
Oliver, the problem's
more serious than that.

1207
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,184
Jenny is very sick.

1208
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:33,688
Define very sick.

1209
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:37,692
She's dying.

1210
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,701
That's impossible.

1211
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:49,204
I'm sorry to
have to tell you this.

1212
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:53,708
That's impossible.

1213
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:57,712
Well,
it's a mistake.

1214
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,214
It has to be.

1215
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:02,217
We've repeated her
blood test three times.

1216
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:05,220
There's no question
about the diagnosis.

1217
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:08,223
She'll have to be
told soon.

1218
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:11,226
We can withhold treatment
for a little while,

1219
01:11:11,226 --> 01:11:14,229
but not for long.

1220
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:16,231
We'll have to
begin therapy

1221
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:19,234
sometime during
the next few weeks.

1222
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:21,236
She's only 24.

1223
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,242
Will it be painful?

1224
01:11:27,692 --> 01:11:28,743
Hopefully not.

1225
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,245
You'll of course
want to speak

1226
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:31,746
to a hematologist.

1227
01:11:32,196 --> 01:11:34,749
I can refer you
to dr. Addison.

1228
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,253
Yeah.

1229
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,257
What do i do?

1230
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:44,259
What can i do
for jenny?

1231
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:48,263
Act as normal
as possible...

1232
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:50,265
for as long
as possible.

1233
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,768
That's really
the best thing.

1234
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,273
Normal.

1235
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:00,775
Normal.

1236
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:04,729
O.k., i'll be
as normal as hell.

1237
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:07,782
[Horn honking]

1238
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:33,868
jen?

1239
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:39,374
Jenny, i'm home.

1240
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:41,376
[Jenny] hey,
i need a lawyer.

1241
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:42,377
I'm a lawyer.

1242
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,379
I need you.

1243
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:45,880
I need you, too.

1244
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:47,382
Why?

1245
01:13:47,749 --> 01:13:48,883
I'm not
a lawyer.

1246
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,885
No, but you're
a nut,

1247
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:54,389
and i happen
to need a nut.

1248
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:55,890
You look lovely,
jenny.

1249
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,892
Bullshit.

1250
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:59,394
O.k., o.k.
you look terrible.

1251
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:00,895
No, i do not
look terrible.

1252
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:02,397
I never look
terrible.

1253
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:03,898
I look o.k.

1254
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:05,400
for thursday
evening, o.k.?

1255
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,402
There's no poetry
in o.k.

1256
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:08,903
screw poetry,
oliver.

1257
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:10,905
Just tell me
what you see.

1258
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:12,407
I see you.

1259
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:14,909
That's poetry.

1260
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,411
Hey,
dr. Shapeley

1261
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:17,912
said we both
checked out.

1262
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,914
That's what he told you, too, right?

1263
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,416
Yeah.

1264
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:24,419
So we just have to
keep trying, right?

1265
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,423
Yeah.
Let's try now.

1266
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:30,925
Right this
very minute?

1267
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,427
Even sooner.

1268
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,642
[Alarm clock ringing]

1269
01:14:50,644 --> 01:14:52,145
[turns off alarm]

1270
01:14:54,147 --> 01:14:56,149
jenny?

1271
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:58,652
Jenny! Jenny!

1272
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:00,654
Get up,
you lazy preppie,

1273
01:15:00,654 --> 01:15:02,572
and get out
and support me

1274
01:15:02,572 --> 01:15:04,157
in the manner
to which

1275
01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:05,659
i plan to become
accustomed.

1276
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:07,661
Come on. Get up.

1277
01:15:10,163 --> 01:15:11,665
[Jenny] you meeting stratton today?

1278
01:15:11,665 --> 01:15:13,166
Who?

1279
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,669
Ray stratton,
your best friend.

1280
01:15:15,669 --> 01:15:18,171
Your roommate
before me.

1281
01:15:19,172 --> 01:15:21,174
[Oliver] yeah.
We're supposed to play,

1282
01:15:21,174 --> 01:15:23,176
but i think
i'll cancel it.

1283
01:15:23,176 --> 01:15:24,678
The hell you will.

1284
01:15:24,678 --> 01:15:26,179
Why not?

1285
01:15:26,179 --> 01:15:27,681
I don't want
a flabby husband.

1286
01:15:27,681 --> 01:15:29,182
Stay in shape,
please.

1287
01:15:29,182 --> 01:15:30,684
All right,

1288
01:15:30,684 --> 01:15:32,185
but i'll take you
to dinner.

1289
01:15:32,185 --> 01:15:33,687
Why?

1290
01:15:33,687 --> 01:15:35,188
Can't i take
my goddamn wife

1291
01:15:35,188 --> 01:15:37,190
out to dinner
if i want to?

1292
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:38,692
O.k., barrett.
Who is she?

1293
01:15:38,692 --> 01:15:40,193
What's her name?

1294
01:15:40,193 --> 01:15:42,195
If you take
your wife to dinner

1295
01:15:42,195 --> 01:15:43,697
in the middle
of the week,

1296
01:15:43,697 --> 01:15:45,699
you must be
screwing somebody.

1297
01:16:03,216 --> 01:16:04,718
[Ray] hey,
what's the matter, ollie?

1298
01:16:05,101 --> 01:16:06,219
Off day.
That's all.

1299
01:16:06,219 --> 01:16:08,722
You've been having
an off day

1300
01:16:08,722 --> 01:16:10,724
for two weeks now.

1301
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:12,726
Old man jonas
wanted me to go

1302
01:16:12,726 --> 01:16:14,227
to chicago
on a big case.

1303
01:16:14,728 --> 01:16:15,729
Oh, yeah?

1304
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:17,230
You know
that newscaster

1305
01:16:17,731 --> 01:16:19,232
that got beat up
by the cops?

1306
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:20,734
You on
the other side

1307
01:16:21,234 --> 01:16:22,736
of a punch-out
rap.

1308
01:16:22,736 --> 01:16:24,237
I turned him down.

1309
01:16:24,237 --> 01:16:25,739
Why?

1310
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:27,240
I don't know.

1311
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,743
I just couldn't see
living in some hotel.

1312
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,746
Boy, you're
really married.

1313
01:16:35,248 --> 01:16:36,750
Your time
will come.

1314
01:17:36,893 --> 01:17:38,311
[Oliver]
hey, mrs. Barrett.

1315
01:17:38,812 --> 01:17:40,814
I'm in the kitchen,
where i belong.

1316
01:17:41,314 --> 01:17:42,816
Get the hell
in here, preppie.

1317
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:44,818
Mrs. Barrett,
guess what.

1318
01:17:44,818 --> 01:17:46,319
You got fired.

1319
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:48,822
I got fired up,
and guess where to.

1320
01:17:49,322 --> 01:17:50,323
Reno, nevada.
Paris, france.

1321
01:17:50,824 --> 01:17:52,325
We'll be there
christmas day.

1322
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:57,330
No. That's not the way
we'll do it.

1323
01:17:57,463 --> 01:17:59,833
Do what?

1324
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:01,334
I don't want paris.

1325
01:18:01,584 --> 01:18:04,337
I don't need paris.
I just want you.

1326
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:07,340
Well, that
you've got, baby.

1327
01:18:09,342 --> 01:18:13,847
And i want time,
which you can't give me.

1328
01:18:18,852 --> 01:18:20,353
You saw
dr. Shapeley?

1329
01:18:20,603 --> 01:18:22,355
Mm-hmm.

1330
01:18:22,355 --> 01:18:25,859
And his buddy, too.
He's a very nice guy.

1331
01:18:28,862 --> 01:18:30,363
Who?

1332
01:18:30,446 --> 01:18:31,865
Dr. Addison.

1333
01:18:31,865 --> 01:18:34,367
He's a yalie--
college and med school,

1334
01:18:34,868 --> 01:18:36,369
but i said
you wouldn't mind.

1335
01:18:37,871 --> 01:18:40,874
No, not if he's
a nice guy.

1336
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:44,377
He didn't bullshit me,
and that's what i wanted.

1337
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:50,850
O.k., then, for
the yalie doctor.

1338
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,353
O.k.

1339
01:19:05,398 --> 01:19:08,401
i'm counting on you
to be strong,

1340
01:19:08,401 --> 01:19:10,904
you goddamn
hockey jock.

1341
01:19:11,404 --> 01:19:14,407
I will, baby.
I will.

1342
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,912
No. I mean for phil.

1343
01:19:18,912 --> 01:19:21,915
It's going to be
hardest on him.

1344
01:19:22,415 --> 01:19:23,416
You, after all,

1345
01:19:23,917 --> 01:19:25,919
you're going to be
the merry widower.

1346
01:19:29,422 --> 01:19:31,424
I won't be merry.

1347
01:19:31,424 --> 01:19:32,926
Yes, you will be.

1348
01:19:32,926 --> 01:19:34,928
I want you
to be merry.

1349
01:19:34,928 --> 01:19:36,930
You'll be merry,
o.k.?

1350
01:19:39,933 --> 01:19:41,434
O.k.

1351
01:19:42,936 --> 01:19:44,437
o.k.

1352
01:21:15,528 --> 01:21:17,030
enough?

1353
01:21:17,113 --> 01:21:18,531
Not for me.

1354
01:21:18,531 --> 01:21:20,533
I love watching you
dodge and weave.

1355
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,535
The old hockey
fake-out.

1356
01:21:22,668 --> 01:21:24,537
That's you
all right--

1357
01:21:24,537 --> 01:21:26,539
the old hockey
fake-out.

1358
01:21:26,706 --> 01:21:28,541
Can we get a cup
of hot chocolate?

1359
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:30,543
Sure.
I'll even pay.

1360
01:21:30,676 --> 01:21:32,045
Very gracious of you.

1361
01:21:32,545 --> 01:21:35,048
I told you
i liked it best

1362
01:21:35,048 --> 01:21:36,549
when i
supported you.

1363
01:21:36,966 --> 01:21:38,051
You always
supported me.

1364
01:21:38,551 --> 01:21:40,553
I mean, after all,
what's money?

1365
01:21:42,055 --> 01:21:43,556
I don't know.

1366
01:21:51,064 --> 01:21:53,066
Hey, could we
afford a taxi?

1367
01:21:53,066 --> 01:21:54,567
Sure.

1368
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:57,570
Where do you
want to go?

1369
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:59,572
The hospital.

1370
01:23:29,162 --> 01:23:31,164
She's getting white cells and platelets,

1371
01:23:31,164 --> 01:23:32,665
which,
at the moment,

1372
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:34,667
is the most important thing she needs.

1373
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:37,170
She doesn't want antimetabolites at all.

1374
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,671
What does that mean?

1375
01:23:38,671 --> 01:23:40,173
That's a treatment

1376
01:23:40,173 --> 01:23:41,674
that slows
cell destruction,

1377
01:23:41,674 --> 01:23:44,677
but there are unpleasant side effects.

1378
01:23:44,677 --> 01:23:47,680
Jenny's the boss.
Whatever she wants.

1379
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,682
You fellows do
everything you can

1380
01:23:49,682 --> 01:23:51,684
to make sure
it doesn't hurt.

1381
01:23:51,684 --> 01:23:53,686
You can be sure
of that.

1382
01:23:54,187 --> 01:23:56,689
I don't care
what it costs.

1383
01:23:56,822 --> 01:23:58,191
It could take
weeks and months.

1384
01:23:58,191 --> 01:23:59,692
Screw the cost.

1385
01:23:59,942 --> 01:24:01,694
There's no way
of knowing

1386
01:24:01,694 --> 01:24:03,196
how long
she'll linger.

1387
01:24:03,196 --> 01:24:06,699
I want her to have
the very best.

1388
01:24:06,699 --> 01:24:08,701
I'm wealthy.

1389
01:24:09,202 --> 01:24:11,204
I'm rich, really.

1390
01:24:11,204 --> 01:24:13,706
Really, i'm like
a millionaire.

1391
01:24:51,744 --> 01:24:53,746
How have you been,
oliver?

1392
01:24:53,746 --> 01:24:55,248
Fine, sir.

1393
01:24:55,248 --> 01:24:56,749
And how is jennifer?

1394
01:24:56,749 --> 01:24:58,751
She's fine, sir.

1395
01:25:03,756 --> 01:25:05,758
[Oliver] i need to borrow $5,000

1396
01:25:05,758 --> 01:25:07,760
for a very good
reason.

1397
01:25:12,265 --> 01:25:13,766
Well?

1398
01:25:16,269 --> 01:25:17,270
S-sir?

1399
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,273
May i know
the reason?

1400
01:25:20,273 --> 01:25:21,774
I can't tell you.

1401
01:25:21,774 --> 01:25:23,776
Just lend me
the money, please.

1402
01:25:25,278 --> 01:25:27,280
Don't they pay you
at jonas and marsh?

1403
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,748
Yes, sir.

1404
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:30,283
And doesn't she
teach?

1405
01:25:30,783 --> 01:25:32,752
Don't call her
"she."

1406
01:25:32,752 --> 01:25:34,787
Doesn't jennifer
teach?

1407
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:36,289
Leave her
out of this.

1408
01:25:36,289 --> 01:25:37,790
Just write out
a check.

1409
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:38,791
It's a personal
matter--

1410
01:25:39,292 --> 01:25:41,294
a very important
personal matter.

1411
01:25:42,795 --> 01:25:44,297
You got some girl
in trouble?

1412
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,303
Yeah. Yeah.
That's it.

1413
01:25:55,308 --> 01:25:57,810
Please lend me
the money.

1414
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:07,320
[Mr. Barrett writing]

1415
01:26:41,354 --> 01:26:42,855
thank you, father.

1416
01:26:45,858 --> 01:26:47,360
[Door closes]

1417
01:27:50,423 --> 01:27:51,924
how is she?

1418
01:27:51,924 --> 01:27:54,927
She wants the troops
home for christmas.

1419
01:27:54,927 --> 01:27:56,429
Always running
the show.

1420
01:27:56,429 --> 01:27:59,432
She may succeed.

1421
01:27:59,432 --> 01:28:00,933
That fast?

1422
01:28:01,434 --> 01:28:02,435
Yes.

1423
01:28:20,953 --> 01:28:23,456
Hello, baby.

1424
01:28:23,456 --> 01:28:24,957
Phil.

1425
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:26,959
How's it going,
mrs. B?

1426
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:29,462
It's going, preppie.

1427
01:28:29,962 --> 01:28:32,465
The troops will be
home for christmas.

1428
01:28:32,465 --> 01:28:33,966
That's
a little trite.

1429
01:28:33,966 --> 01:28:35,468
It's
the goddamn truth.

1430
01:28:35,551 --> 01:28:36,969
Hey, watch your language.

1431
01:28:36,969 --> 01:28:39,472
There's
a grownup present.

1432
01:28:40,973 --> 01:28:42,475
I hope so.

1433
01:28:42,607 --> 01:28:45,109
I mean, phil made
a few promises.

1434
01:28:45,109 --> 01:28:46,611
Don't worry, jenny.

1435
01:28:49,614 --> 01:28:53,117
Maybe i ought to
let you guys--

1436
01:28:53,117 --> 01:28:55,119
i'll be nearby.

1437
01:29:04,128 --> 01:29:06,130
It doesn't hurt,
ollie.

1438
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:07,632
Really, it doesn't.

1439
01:29:09,634 --> 01:29:11,636
It's like
falling off a cliff

1440
01:29:12,136 --> 01:29:13,137
in slow motion,
you know?

1441
01:29:13,638 --> 01:29:14,639
Only after a while,

1442
01:29:15,139 --> 01:29:17,642
you wish you'd hit
the ground, you know?

1443
01:29:19,644 --> 01:29:21,145
Yeah.

1444
01:29:21,312 --> 01:29:23,147
Bullshit. You never
fell off a cliff

1445
01:29:23,147 --> 01:29:24,649
in your whole life.

1446
01:29:24,932 --> 01:29:27,652
Yes, i did--

1447
01:29:27,652 --> 01:29:29,153
when i met you.

1448
01:29:31,656 --> 01:29:33,157
Yeah.

1449
01:29:33,157 --> 01:29:35,660
"What a falling off
was there."

1450
01:29:37,161 --> 01:29:38,663
Who said that?

1451
01:29:38,863 --> 01:29:40,665
I don't know--
shakespeare.

1452
01:29:40,665 --> 01:29:42,667
Yeah, but who?

1453
01:29:44,669 --> 01:29:47,672
I mean, what play?
I went to radcliffe.

1454
01:29:48,172 --> 01:29:50,174
I'm supposed to
remember those things.

1455
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:58,683
I once knew all
the mozart kochel listings.

1456
01:30:00,184 --> 01:30:01,686
Big deal.

1457
01:30:02,053 --> 01:30:04,188
You bet it was.

1458
01:30:06,190 --> 01:30:09,694
What-what number
is the a-major concerto?

1459
01:30:11,195 --> 01:30:13,147
I don't know.
I'll look it up.

1460
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:15,199
But i used to know
all those things.

1461
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,201
I used to know
allthose things.

1462
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:21,205
You want to talk music?

1463
01:30:21,489 --> 01:30:24,158
What do you want
to talk, funerals?

1464
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,214
No, i don't.

1465
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:38,222
Ollie?

1466
01:30:39,724 --> 01:30:42,226
I told phil
you could have

1467
01:30:42,226 --> 01:30:44,228
a catholic service

1468
01:30:44,228 --> 01:30:46,230
and you'd say o.k.

1469
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:48,232
o.k.?

1470
01:30:50,518 --> 01:30:52,236
It will really
help him a lot.

1471
01:30:52,236 --> 01:30:53,738
You know?

1472
01:30:56,741 --> 01:30:58,743
O.k.

1473
01:31:00,745 --> 01:31:03,247
now you got to
stop being sick.

1474
01:31:03,247 --> 01:31:05,750
Me?

1475
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:08,753
That guilty look
on your face--

1476
01:31:08,753 --> 01:31:10,254
it's sick.

1477
01:31:18,262 --> 01:31:19,764
Would you stop
blaming yourself,

1478
01:31:20,264 --> 01:31:21,265
you goddamn
stupid preppie?

1479
01:31:21,766 --> 01:31:22,767
It's nobody's fault.

1480
01:31:29,273 --> 01:31:31,275
It's not your fault.

1481
01:31:36,781 --> 01:31:38,282
That's
the only thing

1482
01:31:38,282 --> 01:31:39,784
i'm going to
ask you.

1483
01:31:39,784 --> 01:31:41,285
Otherwise, i know
you'll be o.k.

1484
01:31:59,303 --> 01:32:01,806
screw paris.

1485
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:06,310
What?

1486
01:32:07,812 --> 01:32:09,313
Screw paris
and music

1487
01:32:09,313 --> 01:32:10,815
and all that stuff

1488
01:32:10,815 --> 01:32:12,316
you thought
you stole from me.

1489
01:32:12,516 --> 01:32:13,818
I don't care.

1490
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:15,820
Don't you
believe that?

1491
01:32:26,831 --> 01:32:28,833
Then get the hell
out of here.

1492
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:30,835
I don't want you at
my goddamn deathbed.

1493
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:39,343
I believe you.

1494
01:32:39,343 --> 01:32:41,846
I really do.

1495
01:32:44,348 --> 01:32:45,349
That's better.

1496
01:32:49,854 --> 01:32:52,857
Would you please do
something for me, ollie?

1497
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:02,366
Would you please
hold me?

1498
01:33:14,378 --> 01:33:16,380
No. I mean
really hold me--

1499
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:18,883
next to me.

1500
01:34:30,955 --> 01:34:32,456
Philip.

1501
01:34:45,469 --> 01:34:46,470
I wish...

1502
01:34:51,976 --> 01:34:54,478
i wish i hadn't
promised jenny--

1503
01:35:00,985 --> 01:35:02,987
i wish i hadn't
promised jenny

1504
01:35:02,987 --> 01:35:04,989
to be strong for you.

1505
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:41,525
[No audible dialogue]

1506
01:35:48,532 --> 01:35:50,534
oliver.

1507
01:35:51,035 --> 01:35:52,536
Why didn't you
tell me?

1508
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:54,538
I made a couple
of calls,

1509
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:57,041
and as soon
as i found out,

1510
01:35:57,541 --> 01:35:58,542
i jumped right
in the car.

1511
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:00,044
Oliver,
i want to help.

1512
01:36:02,546 --> 01:36:04,048
Jenny's dead.

1513
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:08,052
I'm sorry--

1514
01:36:08,168 --> 01:36:09,053
love--

1515
01:36:11,422 --> 01:36:15,059
love means never
having to say you're sorry.
