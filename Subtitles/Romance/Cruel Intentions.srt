1
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,159
Sebastian...
Let's try and focus.

2
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,029
What can I say?
I'm a fool.

3
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,594
- You're not a fool.
- I am. A poor little rich boy.

4
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,470
It's not your fault.
Adolescence is a difficult time.

5
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,189
Without great parenting,
things can go awry.

6
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,912
But you have to rise above
their mistakes. Here.

7
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,193
- An autographed copy. For me?
- It's yours.

8
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,154
Stop being so hard on yourself.
What's in the past is over.

9
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,436
You're right.

10
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,072
It's hard to believe there was a
time when I only thought about sex.

11
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,312
It's no way to go through life.

12
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,517
Take yourself, for example.

13
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,798
You're a very attractive woman.
You have killer legs.

14
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,795
I'd love to photograph them...
That was the old me.

15
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,399
I'm cured now.
Same time next week?

16
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,473
I'm going on my book tour.
I'll be back in a month.

17
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,315
- Why?
- Other people need my help, too.

18
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,598
- You'll do just fine.
- I hope so.

19
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,070
If you need anything, just call.

20
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,596
I could use a hug.

21
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,231
All right... There you go.

22
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,588
<i>- Your daughter on 1.
- Tell her to hold.</i>

23
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:34,473
- Is this her? She seems nice.
- She's great. Straight-A student.

24
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,350
She's attending Princeton this fall.

25
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,796
She's the type of girl
I should be with.

26
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,475
She's a little out of your league.

27
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,479
- Take care of yourself, Sebastian.
- Thank you... for everything.

28
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,270
Shmuck.

29
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,988
<i>- Yes?
- Your daughter's still holding.</i>

30
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,439
<i>- Hi, honey.
- You kept me on hold.</i>

31
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,674
He told me he loved me,
and I believed him.

32
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,391
<i>- I'm so stupid.
- It's all right.</i>

33
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,950
Take a deep breath,
step out of the circle.

34
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,830
Cut the psycho-babble bullshit, Mom!

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,037
There's pictures of me
on the Internet.

36
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,718
<i>- What kind of pictures?
- Nudie pictures! What do you think?</i>

37
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,756
- How could you be so stupid?
- He was just so charming.

38
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,276
He said I had killer legs, -

39
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,113
<i>- and he wanted to photograph them.</i>

40
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,990
Things just got
completely out of hand.

41
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,433
Mom... Are you there?

42
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,391
<i>Mom? Mother!</i>

43
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,349
Sebastian!

44
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,876
You're going to pay for this,
you little shit!

45
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,115
- You sicko! Pervert!
- What's her problem?

46
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,829
Someone's in need of therapy.

47
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,629
You won't get away with this.
Get away!

48
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,594
- What's your name?
- Clorissa.

49
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,912
- Clorissa? God, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

50
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,595
- I'm going to take you to lunch.
- Okay.

51
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,518
There's no parking here, sir.

52
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,749
We're so happy that Cecile will be
attending Manchester with you.

53
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,957
You've been an inspiration to us.

54
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,238
We hope she can rise to the
high standards you've set for her.

55
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,392
I'll do my best.

56
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,229
- What was that?
- "Thanks. " Isn't Vietnamese lovely?

57
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:52,230
Kathryn is very popular at school.
Listen to her and you'll go far.

58
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,554
- Where do you get your strength?
- It sounds corny, but...

59
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,995
When I'm tempted by peer pressure,
I turn to God. He helps me.

60
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,518
- That's beautiful.
- What are the boys like?

61
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,549
Cecile...
Is that all you can think of?

62
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,472
Forgive her. She's never been in
a co-educational atmosphere before.

63
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,351
It's understandable. Most boys
at Manchester are very upstanding.

64
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,149
But there are a few bad apples.

65
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,031
Like your stepbrother Sebastian.
What he did to the school nurse...

66
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,670
I hear she's recovering quite well.

67
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,799
Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.

68
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,229
- You remember my daughter Cecile?
- My, what an adorable shirt.

69
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,551
My father took me to Australia.

70
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,191
How are things down under?
Blossoming, I hope.

71
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,158
What?

72
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,593
- I'm so sorry...
- Well, thank you for your help.

73
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,311
- I'll call about your curriculum.
- Okay, thanks.

74
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,199
It was nice meeting you.

75
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,148
Let's go. Keep your legs together.
This isn't Jamaica.

76
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,077
I didn't know it was Asshole Day.

77
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,950
I'm just taking the poor girl
under my wing.

78
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,914
The parental units called.

79
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,958
How's your whore of a mother
enjoying Bali?

80
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,717
She suspects that your impotent,
alcoholic dad is diddling the maid.

81
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,791
- Therapy not going well?
- It was fine.

82
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,519
Clorissa. "Call me. "

83
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,834
I'm sick of sleeping with these
insipid Manhattan debutantes.

84
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,115
- Nothing shocks them anymore.
- Relax. I have a mission for you.

85
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:16,072
- Remember Court Reynolds?
- The Nazi who dumped you July 4th?

86
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,554
<i>I went to great lengths to please
Court. I made huge sacrifices.</i>

87
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,919
My feelings were hurt when I learned
Court had fallen for someone else.

88
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,039
- You don't mean?
- None other than Cecile Caldwell.

89
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,317
So that's what this is all about.

90
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,074
"Keep your enemies close. "

91
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,830
When I'm done with Cecile, she'll
be the premier tramp of New York.

92
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,673
Court's princess
will be damaged goods.

93
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:53,428
- Why not just attack Court?
- That could be traced back to me.

94
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,594
That won't do. Everyone loves me,
and I intend to keep it that way.

95
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,799
I see your point.

96
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,197
- Why should I care?
- You have to seduce young Cecile.

97
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,592
She's quite cute, you know.

98
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,070
Young, supple breasts.

99
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,789
A tight, firm ass.

100
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,552
Uncharted booty.

101
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,838
Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
Boldly go...

102
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,470
...where no man has gone before.

103
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,319
I can't.

104
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,792
- Why not?
- Come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.

105
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,476
Get one of your moron friends to
do it. I've a reputation to uphold.

106
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,792
- Diddling the therapist's daughter?
- She was overcharging.

107
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,434
<i>This is a challenge.</i>

108
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,595
- I know all about menstrual cramps.
- Shut up and turn to page 64.

109
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,319
"Why I plan to wait",
by Annette Hargrove, Kansas City.

110
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,950
- Jesus Christ, is she for real?
- She's Daddy's little angel.

111
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,588
A paradigm of chastity.

112
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,791
Let's see.
Boring, boring, boring...

113
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,236
"I love my parents. "

114
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,393
"Making a mature decision... "
Here!

115
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,757
She has a boyfriend named Trevor.

116
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,152
Going out for a year.
Trevor understands.

117
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,995
Trevor's a fag.
Too bad she lives in Kansas.

118
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,871
<i>Au contraire. The virgin's father
is the new headmaster at our school.</i>

119
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,669
She's staying with my aunt
while her parents sell the house.

120
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,594
Can you imagine what this will do
for my reputation?

121
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,833
Screwing the new headmaster's
daughter before school starts.

122
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,678
- She'll be my greatest victory.
- You don't stand a chance.

123
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,399
- Care to make a wager?
- I'll think about it.

124
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,509
Duty calls. Dr. Greenbaum and her
daughter will be an exciting entry.

125
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,990
Your journal...
Could you be more queer?

126
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,358
Could you be more desperate
to read it?

127
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,871
Sebastian...

128
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,999
Could you come here for a second?

129
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,237
About that little wager of yours...
Count me in.

130
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,030
What are the terms?

131
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,714
If I win...

132
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,398
- Your hot little car is mine.
- And if I win?

133
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,556
You'll get something you've wanted
since our parents got married.

134
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,599
Be more specific.

135
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,436
In English...
I'll fuck your brains out.

136
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,435
What makes you think I'll go for it?
That's a 1956 Jaguar Roadster.

137
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,354
Because I'm the only person
you can't have, and it kills you.

138
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,868
No way.

139
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,112
You can put it anywhere.

140
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,431
You got yourself a bet, baby.

141
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,595
Happy hunting, Sebastian.

142
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,469
Your home is beautiful,
Mrs. Rosemond.

143
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,996
It's been in my family
for over 100 years.

144
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,871
- Does your family ride much?
- My grandpa used to break horses.

145
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,838
- What was that?
- Sebastian must be home.

146
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,958
Pull!

147
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,710
- Sebastian!
- Fuck me...

148
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,793
Aunt Helen!
God, I've missed you!

149
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,669
I've been looking all over for you.

150
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,789
I want you to meet Annette.
Annette Hargrove, this is Sebastian.

151
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,909
- She'll be staying for a few weeks.
- I guess that makes two of us.

152
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,594
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

153
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,471
Aunt Helen, why don't you whip up
some of that ice tea of yours?

154
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,633
- Don't get into any trouble.
- We won't.

155
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,711
Come on.

156
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,469
Quickly, lots to see.

157
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,431
I read your manifesto. I must say,
I found it rather appalling.

158
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,316
- Most people praise me for it.
- Most people are sheep.

159
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,438
You criticize something
you've never experienced.

160
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,516
<i>I just believe people shouldn't
make love before they are in love.</i>

161
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,434
People our age aren't mature enough
to know those emotions.

162
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,639
- Are you a lesbian?
- No.

163
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,588
I just picked up on
a little of that lesbian vibe.

164
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,355
<i>I wouldn't expect you
to understand my beliefs.</i>

165
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,709
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I know of your reputation.

166
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,871
What have you heard?

167
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,397
That you promise girls the world
to get them in bed with you.

168
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,075
- Who told you this?
- A friend wrote me.

169
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,472
- That's a little tacky.
- It's the truth, isn't it?

170
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,474
If you say so.

171
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,592
That's good.
Let's try the G-major scale.

172
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,158
Once again.
Remember, the third note is sharp.

173
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,953
I suck!

174
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,874
Relax. Take a deep breath.

175
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,068
You're concentrating too much
on your bowing. Let me help you.

176
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,391
Close your eyes.

177
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,917
Mai-lee, be careful!
We've had this discussion.

178
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,710
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Your playing was beautiful.

179
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,668
This is Ronald Clifford.
He'll be teaching me this summer.

180
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,515
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

181
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,559
Ronald is attending pre-Juilliard.
He's composing his first opera.

182
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,875
- It's based on Martin Luther King.
- Dr. King is my favorite.

183
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,635
I guess our hour's up.
Same time tomorrow?

184
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,312
Bye.

185
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,437
Unbelievable.
Some fag, no offence, -

186
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,991
- wrote a letter to this chick
describing my tactics.

187
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,359
- Any idea who it could be?
- If I did, the person would suffer.

188
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:47,272
- Where is the little girl from?
- Kansas. Who do I know in Kansas?

189
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,796
- Greg McConnell.
- The football stud?

190
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,078
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was your rat.

191
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,031
He hates me. I fingered his
girlfriend at Homecoming last year.

192
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,955
- I don't think that bothered him.
- What do you mean?

193
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,594
<i>Greg likes to tackle tight ends
on and off the field.</i>

194
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,639
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not.

195
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,031
He used to sneak into my dorm drunk.

196
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,590
As soon as he'd come
he'd freak out:

197
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,278
"What are you doing? I'm not a fag.
If you tell, I'll kick your ass!"

198
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,993
I only put up with it because
the man has a mouth like a Hoover.

199
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,678
- Too bad he's in Kansas.
- Not anymore.

200
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,435
The football team started practice
last week.

201
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,479
- We've already had a session.
- Good for you.

202
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,070
Could you arrange a get-together
with him tonight?

203
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,757
"Spartacus" is on TV tonight.

204
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,198
- Outstanding.
- But it'll cost you.

205
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,194
Just make sure
your front door is unlocked.

206
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,239
Shall we say the stroke of midnight,
no pun intended?

207
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,996
The stroke of midnight it is.

208
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,913
I take out my dick
and I shove it right in her face.

209
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,629
I'm like, "Suck it, you dumb bitch. "

210
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,351
- The Gregster.
- Yes, the Gregster.

211
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,948
- Gregory?
- Hi, Blaine.

212
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,433
I hear you went on a date with
Court Reynolds. I hear he's nice.

213
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,392
He kept talking about this bulimic
headcase he dumped on July 4th.

214
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,873
- Bulimic headcase?
- What a loser she must be.

215
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,675
Sorry.

216
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,312
Court's invited me to the Hamptons
for Labor Day weekend.

217
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,552
- That's great.
- You think so?

218
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,350
- I guess I'm just scared.
- Of what?

219
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,229
Boys. I've never even got
to first base with a guy.

220
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,154
Haven't you practiced
on a girlfriend?

221
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,077
- No, that's gross.
- How do you think girls learn?

222
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,199
Close your eyes and wet your lips.

223
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,148
- Are you for real?
- Do you want to learn?

224
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,959
I guess.

225
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,950
- That wasn't so scary.
- It was nothing.

226
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,229
Let's try it again. This time I'll
stick my tongue in your mouth.

227
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,839
Massage my tongue with yours.
That's what first base is.

228
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,917
- Okay.
- Eyes closed.

229
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,991
- Not bad.
- That was cool.

230
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,151
Maybe you should try it
on your friend Ronald sometime.

231
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,114
- What are you saying?
- It's obvious he's crazy about you.

232
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,591
He sends me love letters.

233
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,276
- How romantic. Have you responded?
- No.

234
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,436
- Don't you like him?
- I think about him all the time.

235
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,956
If my mom found out she'd kill me.

236
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,877
- You did hide the letters, right?
- In an antique doll's house.

237
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,319
- Bring me copies of the letters.
- Why?

238
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,472
I'm great at love letters.

239
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,076
I'll have him eating
out of the palm of your hand.

240
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,995
- Maybe you can meet at my house.
- You'd do that for me?

241
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,790
- Of course. We're friends, right?
- Best friends.

242
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,317
Do you want to have a sleepover?

243
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,312
Hello?

244
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,514
Excuse me...

245
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,514
- Excuse me...
- What a pleasant surprise.

246
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,112
- The music's playing in every room.
- It's not, just yours.

247
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,513
I thought you'd be pleased.

248
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,670
- What are you doing in your room?
- Reading.

249
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,709
- Anything interesting?
- Yes, it's quite intriguing.

250
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,629
For you.

251
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,555
Something to start
the new school year with.

252
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,193
- You didn't have to do this.
- You hate it.

253
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,478
- You just didn't have to do it.
- Can you join me for a swim?

254
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,316
It is ten o'clock,
but we are reasonably young.

255
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,429
Your proposal's only mildly
insulting, so I'll consider it.

256
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,152
Give me a minute.

257
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,472
<i>- Fuck her yet?
- I'm working on it.</i>

258
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,598
Call me later.

259
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,436
Sebastian?

260
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,594
Would you mind turning around
so I can put on my bathing suit?

261
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,911
This is so embarrassing...

262
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,191
It amazes me someone as charming
as you can be so manipulative.

263
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,318
You're not going to start again?

264
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,109
What was my favorite part?

265
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,197
"He has never uttered a single word
without some dishonorable intent. "

266
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,276
"Every woman he has pursued has
regretted it. Stay away from him. "

267
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:54,437
You could at least have the decency
to tell me who's bad-mouthing me.

268
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,797
Not a chance.

269
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:08,355
You're right...
about what you said today.

270
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,830
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

271
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,436
- I'm not giving you a hard time.
- It's okay.

272
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,277
Look at you,
with all your morals and values...

273
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:29,279
You seem to be happy in your
choices. I envy you. No bullshit.

274
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,912
Seriously.
You've got everything going for you.

275
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,074
You're smart,
you're beautiful, you're determined.

276
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,630
You're everything I want
in a girlfriend.

277
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,799
You know I'm seeing someone?

278
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,399
Yes, the infamous Trevor. It's funny
how you haven't mentioned him.

279
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,518
He's backpacking through Europe.

280
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,912
He's great. I really miss him.

281
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,313
- I care.
- I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

282
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,471
Honestly?

283
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,873
"You're smart,
you're beautiful... determined. "

284
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,759
That won't get you anywhere.

285
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,155
The best you can hope for
is my friendship.

286
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,192
Good night, sweet pea.

287
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,629
- Oh, baby...
- "Baby"?

288
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,434
Right on time.

289
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:09,033
- Shit! Give me my underwear.
- Don't get so huffy.

290
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,435
What do we have here?

291
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,276
Look, Valmont, it's the first time
I've ever done anything like this.

292
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,831
- I was just...
- Really drunk and blah-blah-blah.

293
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,516
Please don't tell anyone.
This could ruin my whole career.

294
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,070
Your career?
Greg, what about your family?

295
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,434
Wouldn't your dad be humiliated to
find out his son's a fudge-packer?

296
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,755
I'll do anything. Let's just
forget about this whole thing, okay?

297
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,190
No. I can't help you there. You're
bad-mouthing me to Annette Hargrove.

298
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,033
What are you talking about?

299
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,311
You're the only one who knows her.

300
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,109
I never said a word to her
about you.

301
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,670
He's probably telling you the truth.

302
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,516
The man can barely write out
a grocery list, let alone a letter.

303
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,355
All right... I believe you.

304
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,869
Your secret's safe with me.

305
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,636
Actually, there is something
you can do for me.

306
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,629
- What else do you know about him?
- Well, he's smart as hell.

307
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,909
He's dedicated to achieving his
goals. He always gives 110 percent.

308
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,429
He's always watched my back.

309
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,639
He's got a bad rep,
but it's mostly bullshit.

310
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,110
I've heard awful things about him.

311
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,559
- From who?
- I'm sworn to secrecy.

312
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,158
- How long have we known each other?
- Forever.

313
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,030
It's my job to look out for you.
You're like a sister to me.

314
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,354
Do I look like a gossip queen?
It's me. Greg.

315
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,553
The Gregster.
I'm serious.

316
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,834
- You swear not to tell anybody?
- I swear on my momma's life.

317
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,832
That nosy bitch. Are you sure?

318
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,154
She said "Mrs. Caldwell".
They met at orientation.

319
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,717
- Did you do what I asked you to?
- Yeah.

320
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,394
- She bought it?
- I'm pretty sure.

321
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,155
- Pretty sure, or sure-sure?
- She bought it.

322
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,312
<i>She tried to outdo me, -</i>

323
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,237
<i>- even though I told her
that I could do this.</i>

324
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,552
<i>My best friends Sue, Kelly
and Frances knew I could do it.</i>

325
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,153
<i>- You okay?
- Yeah.</i>

326
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,756
You would not believe...

327
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,156
<i>- It's my mom.
- I should get going.</i>

328
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,756
<i>- See you tomorrow?
- Absolutely.</i>

329
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,429
<i>- Goodbye.
- Peace out.</i>

330
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,433
"Peace out"? Moron.

331
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,674
- Okay, what's wrong with you?
- Are you ready for this?

332
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:50,389
I've discovered that Mrs. Caldwell
urged Annette to stay away from me.

333
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,313
- Interesting.
- Yes, it is.

334
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,235
I now plan to devote all my energy
to destroying the douchebag.

335
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,758
The plot thickens. Cecile
has fallen for her music teacher.

336
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,514
Mrs. Caldwell will love that.

337
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,395
But Don Juan moves with the speed
of a Special Olympic hurdler.

338
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,632
What's your plan of attack?

339
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,352
I rat Cecile out to Mommy, who goes
ballistic and ends the relationship.

340
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,757
But who will they turn to for help?

341
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,274
Cecile is going away with Court
next week.

342
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,558
I need you to speed up
her sexual awakening.

343
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,599
- I'm at your service.
- Thank you.

344
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,833
- That feels good.
- Sis, you're so tense.

345
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,594
I know...

346
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,350
I hate it
when things don't go my way.

347
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,798
It makes me so horny.

348
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,270
I hate it, too.

349
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,399
It seems like things
are looking up for you.

350
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,834
It appears so.

351
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:36,075
- Any luck with your girl?
- Moving along quite well.

352
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,958
- Have you succeeded in your task?
- Any day now.

353
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,109
Well, let me know when you do.
Until then...

354
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,433
Down, boy!

355
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,358
Come on!

356
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,515
Hi, it's Sebastian.
I didn't wake you, did I?

357
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,194
No, not at all.

358
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:33,754
- Did I leave my glasses there?
- No, I don't think so.

359
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,190
All right.
I guess I'll see you around.

360
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,195
- Is that really why you called?
- No.

361
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,638
- I miss talking to you.
- A moment of honesty.

362
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,669
<i>- Well, I'm not liking it too much.
- What are you doing tomorrow?</i>

363
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,752
<i>I'm going out with you.</i>

364
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,833
I came as quick as I could.
What's wrong?

365
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,354
It's Cecile.

366
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,919
- You promise not to say anything?
- Yes. It isn't drugs, is it?

367
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,592
It's worse.

368
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,831
I think there's something between
Cecile and her music teacher.

369
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,430
- Ronald? That's crazy.
- Yes, she's so young, he's so...

370
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,878
Black!
Brown sugar... no sugar.

371
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,508
He's sent her love letters,
they're under her doll's house.

372
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,879
Something like this could destroy
her reputation at Manchester.

373
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,430
I hope I was right to tell you. I'd
hate to see her ruin it with Court.

374
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,751
- I can't thank you enough.
- You will be discreet?

375
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,595
Absolutely.

376
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,719
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Excuse me?

377
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,189
I'm not paying you
to pervert my child.

378
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,273
I think you're
misunderstanding something.

379
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,557
Care to explain this, then?

380
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,477
- Where did you find those?
- Margarita did, when cleaning.

381
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,235
Go to your room... Now!

382
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:00,199
How dare you disrespect me?
I got you off the streets.

383
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,636
The streets?
I live at 59th and Park.

384
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,032
Whatever. You are never to set foot
in this house again, -

385
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,115
<i>- and you are never to see
my daughter again. Understood?</i>

386
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,636
First of all,
I never touched your daughter.

387
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,715
Second, I'd like to think
you could look beyond racial lines.

388
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,715
Don't give me that racist crap.
We gave money to Colin Powell.

389
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,949
I guess that puts me in my place.
Thank you for your hospitality.

390
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,749
It was a true awakening.

391
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,077
The black man is gone!

392
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,277
Praise Jesus,
the black man is gone!

393
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,150
- I never knew she felt this way.
- You're a lucky guy.

394
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,438
- What do I do?
- Tell her you love her.

395
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,309
Mrs. Caldwell will have me shot
if I go near her.

396
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,359
I don't even know
her e-mail address.

397
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,311
E- mail is for geeks and paedophiles.
Be romantic, write another letter.

398
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,155
- How will it get to her?
- We'll make sure she gets it.

399
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,396
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because...

400
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,872
We want to see Cecile happy.

401
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,355
We know that you'd make her happy.
You'd make any girl happy.

402
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,158
You mind if I have some privacy?

403
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,633
My room's across the hall.
Make yourself at home.

404
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,958
- Who are you calling?
- Cecile.

405
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:22,070
- What are you doing?
- You know the damage we'll cause?

406
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,910
I'm aware.

407
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,716
Are you really? We've done
some fucked-up shit, but this is...

408
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,034
We're destroying an innocent girl.

409
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,033
Court Reynolds is going down. If you
won't help me, someone else will.

410
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,751
- You amaze me.
- Eat me, Sebastian.

411
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,712
You guys can fuck everyone, but I
get dumped for twits like Cecile.

412
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,668
God forbid I exude confidence
and enjoy sex.

413
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:06,870
I must act like Mary Sunshine 24-7
so I can be considered a lady.

414
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,273
I'm the Marcia Brady of the
East Side and I want to kill myself.

415
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,637
There's your psychoanalysis,
Dr. Freud.

416
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,954
Now tell me,
are you in, or are you out?

417
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,677
Call her.

418
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,957
It's Kathryn.
Okay, stop crying.

419
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,033
Stop crying.
Hold on for Sebastian.

420
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,874
Cecile?

421
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,079
Stop crying.
Listen to me very carefully.

422
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,155
I have a letter from Ronald.
He asked me to give it to you.

423
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,952
I can't bring it to your house, your
mother despises me, so listen...

424
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,835
Finished.

425
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,429
- This doesn't taste like ice tea.
- It's from Long Island.

426
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,519
- How's the letter?
- It's excellent.

427
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,069
- Do you think he'll like it?
- He'll love it. Are you kidding?

428
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,189
- What are you doing?
- Just taking a photo.

429
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,514
- You know, you could be a model.
- Really?

430
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,719
Too bad you're not sexy.

431
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,273
- I can be sexy.
- All right, show me sexy.

432
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,833
Wow, that's very sexy.
Make yourself more comfortable.

433
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,438
No, no. Come here.

434
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,314
<i>Now that's sexy.</i>

435
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,872
Cecile, you know
what would be super-duper sexy?

436
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,555
If you lost all the clothes.

437
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,036
- I don't think so.
- Sorry, that was out of line.

438
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,909
- I think I should go home now.
- I'll have your mom pick you up.

439
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,355
You can't call my mom.

440
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:34,712
Wow, she doesn't know you're here.
In fact, you're probably grounded.

441
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,398
- I think I should call her anyway.
- I'll do anything. Don't call!

442
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,997
Cecile...
All I want to do is give you a kiss.

443
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,271
Just a kiss?

444
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,319
I swear.

445
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,114
- What are you doing?
- You promised to let me kiss you.

446
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,592
- But then why...
- I don't want to kiss you here.

447
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,352
I want to kiss you there.

448
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,236
- A promise is a promise, Cecile.
- A promise is a promise...

449
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,079
It tickles.

450
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,678
Cecile, are you up yet?
You're going to be late for the...

451
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,799
<i>- Cecile?
- I need a hug.</i>

452
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,475
- Cecile?
- Yeah.

453
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,792
- Jesus, where have you been?
- Shopping.

454
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,159
Hurry up. You're supposed to be
at Mrs. Rosemond's before brunch.

455
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:53,111
She's very important at the school,
and I want you to look your best.

456
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,789
- Afternoon, ladies.
- I didn't know you'd be here.

457
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,556
Why waste such a lovely day
in the city?

458
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,599
- Good point.
- Anyone for tennis?

459
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,630
Excuse me.

460
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,951
That was rude.

461
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,351
She's very strange.

462
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,798
- What am I going to do?
- Is something wrong?

463
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,919
Mrs. Collins is short of volunteers
at the retirement home.

464
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,959
- But I have theatre tickets.
- That's terrible.

465
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,477
I have a thought.
Why don't you two fill in for me?

466
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,110
- I'd love to.
- You two are the best.

467
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:55,470
- Thank you. It's so sweet of you.
- I can't help it.

468
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,151
Isn't he beautiful? It's wonderful
when you young people help out.

469
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,950
Most of our patients
have no family nearby.

470
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,669
Mr. Gottlieb,
we have a visitor for you.

471
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,115
No, I've got somebody special
for you, baby.

472
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,868
Did I ever tell you the time
when my late husband...

473
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,751
Yes, Mrs. Sugerman, you did.
Right after we played backgammon.

474
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,756
- We played backgammon?
- You beat me three times.

475
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,629
- Then I fucked your daughter.
- Excuse me?

476
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:45,909
- I said, "Care for some water?"
- No, thank you.

477
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,356
- Come in.
- How's it going in here?

478
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:00,152
We played backgammon,
and I won three times.

479
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,952
- That's the way to go!
- Isn't it wonderful?

480
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,237
I told you she was special.

481
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,712
That was fun.

482
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,395
I actually feel good about myself.
Mrs. Sugerman is cool.

483
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:27,476
Come on.
Mrs. Sugerman is cool?

484
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,871
- You must think I'm an idiot.
- No.

485
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:38,355
- You had a good time with her?
- I did. We played backgammon.

486
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,553
All right, I was bored out of
my mind. I hate doing charity.

487
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,635
It's okay.
That doesn't make you a bad person.

488
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,839
- I can't win with you.
- It's not about winning, Sebastian.

489
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,038
Your problem is,
you take yourself too seriously.

490
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,591
- I do not.
- Yes, you do. Try to lighten up.

491
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:10,551
I am.
Can we drop this?

492
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,634
What are you doing?

493
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,990
Stop it. It's distracting.

494
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,119
Cut it out.
Stop it.

495
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,671
- Are you smiling?
- No.

496
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,792
Will you stop!

497
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,236
You can relax.
I promise I won't tell anybody.

498
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,069
- Who is it?
- It's Kathryn.

499
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,995
- Are you okay?
- No!

500
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,396
What's wrong?

501
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:23,078
- Something bad happened last night.
- What do you mean?

502
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:29,839
- I don't think you want to know.
- Cecile, you have to tell me.

503
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,593
It involves your brother.
He... He took advantage of me.

504
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,548
- Why didn't you do something?
- I don't know.

505
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:46,511
You came to our house late at night,
and he forced intercourse on you.

506
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,830
Not exactly.

507
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,552
- He made you give him a blowjob?
- No...

508
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,076
What, then?

509
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:06,674
He took down my panties and
wrote the alphabet with his tongue.

510
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,709
- He went down on you?
- If that's what you call it.

511
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,952
- Well, did you like it?
- No.

512
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:21,558
I don't know, it was weird.
At first it felt icky, -

513
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,951
- and then it was sort of okay.

514
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:33,038
Then I started getting really hot,
and then I started shaking...

515
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,713
It was weird,
it just felt like an explosion...

516
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,432
- But a good one.
- Cecile, you had an orgasm.

517
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:53,230
- I did?
- You're becoming a woman.

518
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,632
- I am?
- Cecile!

519
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:07,238
Now that you're on your way,
it would be stupid of you to stop.

520
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,598
Think of Sebastian as a tutor.
Let him instruct you.

521
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,595
But I don't love him.
I love Ronald.

522
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:22,995
Don't you want to make Ronald happy?
Practice makes perfect, Cecile.

523
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,917
My advice is to sleep with
as many people as possible.

524
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,356
That would make me a slut...
Wouldn't it?

525
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:38,709
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
that nobody talks about it.

526
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:46,350
- Like a secret society?
- That's one way of looking at it.

527
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,036
- Fucking idiot...
- Cool.

528
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,912
Secret society, secret society...

529
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:13,674
- Am I supposed to feel this sore?
- Just the first time. It'll pass.

530
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,471
I like it better when I'm on top.

531
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,392
Cecile...

532
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:39,195
This is what I call "quiet time",
when we reflect on what we've done.

533
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,352
Sorry.

534
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,797
- Something's the matter?
- You think?

535
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,909
- Is it me?
- No, you were fine.

536
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:59,074
It's that Annette girl.
You love her, don't you?

537
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:05,679
It's okay. I don't love you, either.
I love Ronald.

538
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,992
- Where are you going?
- I'm taking a shower.

539
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,754
- Want company?
- No.

540
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,629
- Want a blowjob?
- Good night, Cecile.

541
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,437
Prude...

542
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,797
Who are you spying on?

543
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,509
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

544
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,231
She's crying. Little baby's upset
by the big bad book.

545
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,756
- Shut up.
- What's up your ass?

546
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,753
Nothing.

547
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,516
- She's getting to you, isn't she?
- If you must know, yes.

548
00:55:53,680 --> 00:56:00,597
I can't stand her holy bullshit,
yet I'm totally infatuated with her.

549
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,198
She made me laugh.

550
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,590
That's why you're losing our bet?

551
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,594
No. It's just taking longer
than I expected.

552
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,750
Do you mind if I take
my new car for a ride?

553
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:30,517
Kathryn... The only thing
you're going to be riding is me.

554
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,479
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

555
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,918
<i>- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
- Bonjour, monsieur Valmont.</i>

556
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:19,239
- I'm sorry about that.
- I am too.

557
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,471
- You know what? I'm not sorry.
- I thought we'd just be friends.

558
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,792
I can't keep my feelings
all bottled up like you.

559
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,635
Do you honestly feel nothing for me?

560
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,676
- I have feelings for you.
- Then what's wrong?

561
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:44,550
It's not like you have a husband,
unless you're married to Jesus.

562
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,919
- Why can't we be together?
- Do you really want to know why?

563
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,199
It's because
I don't trust myself with you.

564
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,677
Come in.

565
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,317
- I just came to say goodbye.
- Where are you going?

566
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,759
Back to the city. Maybe to France
for the end of the summer.

567
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,754
- I can't take your games anymore.
- What games?

568
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,515
Come off it. You're hot one minute,
cold the next...

569
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:59,268
- You make me feel inadequate.
- Then I guess it's best you leave.

570
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,195
Sebastian... I don't want us
to part on bad terms.

571
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,069
I'm afraid you don't have a choice
in the matter.

572
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,597
- I don't associate with hypocrites.
- How am I a hypocrite?

573
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,719
You spend all your time preaching
about waiting for love.

574
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,672
Now you're turning your back on it.
So I guess we're just fucked.

575
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:31,474
I'll move on, but you'll always know
that you turned your back on love.

576
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,758
That makes you a hypocrite.

577
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,716
Have a nice life.

578
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,358
Wait...

579
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,274
I'm sorry, I can't.

580
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,794
Get it together, you pussy.

581
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,276
- Morning.
- Morning.

582
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,468
- So, how did it go last night?
- With who?

583
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,359
Not Cecile, I know all about that.

584
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,599
No, I didn't nail her.

585
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,992
- She shot you down?
- Exactly the opposite.

586
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,879
What went wrong?

587
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,713
I don't know.

588
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:15,798
She was lying on the bed,
ready to do it, and I was...

589
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:24,432
- I just didn't feel right about it.
- You had your chance, and didn't?

590
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,349
- She's not in her room.
- Where is she?

591
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:41,071
She left 30 minutes ago.

592
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,959
Where did she go?

593
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:51,435
She told your aunt
she was going to stay with friends.

594
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,673
You blew it.
That girl's come to her senses.

595
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,152
She'll never go near you again.

596
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,952
Stupid, stupid...
"Judy". I'll save that one.

597
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,278
It's Valmont. Is she with you?

598
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,558
No, I don't know where she is.
Why don't you leave her alone?

599
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:20,919
- Where is she?
- She's staying with the Mihallaks.

600
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:26,074
<i>She caught a train into Penn Station
about 20 minutes ago.</i>

601
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:34,990
- I'm impressed.
- I'm in love.

602
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,439
Are you okay?

603
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,713
Just a minute.

604
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,955
Come in.

605
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,314
- Bad time?
- Kind of.

606
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:23,433
You invited me in so I could witness
your little adventure.

607
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:28,071
Who is our friend
who gives you such pleasure?

608
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,428
Where could he be?

609
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,636
- Fucked-up shit in this house...
- Call me.

610
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:55,233
You don't get to have all the fun.

611
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,792
I assume you've come here
to make arrangements.

612
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,674
Some other time.

613
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,310
- Excuse me?
- I'm not in the mood.

614
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,439
- I want to fuck.
- And I don't.

615
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,469
Good afternoon, Kathryn.

616
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,355
Sounds great.
I love you, too.

617
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,115
"I love you, too... "

618
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,789
You're completely pussy-whipped.

619
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,475
- Stop it.
- What happened to us?

620
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,393
- Nothing has changed.
- Yes, it has.

621
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:54,714
- You don't love me anymore.
- Come on, it's just a bet.

622
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:16,158
<i>- This is ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous, dear brother.</i>

623
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:23,032
Look what you've been reduced to.
What'll happen when school starts?

624
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:28,558
You're dating Miss Seventeen
Magazine, the headmaster's daughter.

625
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:33,316
Before you know it, you'll be
giving campus tours with her.

626
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,270
Her father doesn't know
about your past, does he?

627
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:43,833
I doubt he'd let his little princess
be seen with you.

628
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,232
It's disappointing to see Annette's
manifesto was a total sham.

629
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:54,396
As student body president,
I feel it's my duty to tell him.

630
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,511
- Put the phone down.
- This won't take a second.

631
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,474
Quite the predicament you're in.

632
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:16,831
I was planning on telling her
everything this afternoon.

633
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,438
<i>That's right, I forgot.
You're so in love.</i>

634
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:28,470
You honestly believe you've changed
in the few days you've known her?

635
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,509
Let me tell you something.
People don't change overnight.

636
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:38,356
You and I are two of a kind.
I'm not afraid to admit it.

637
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,952
You were going to leave school
a legend, now you'll leave a joke.

638
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,035
- I'm willing to take my chances.
- Don't do it, Sebastian.

639
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:56,878
You won't only ruin your reputation,
you'll destroy hers.

640
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,474
This is my room.

641
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,148
Can we be quiet?

642
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,356
- I have something to tell you.
- Tell me.

643
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:25,594
- This isn't working out for me.
- Yeah, me neither.

644
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:35,995
- What's wrong?
- It's me. I'm completely fucked up.

645
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,754
What are you saying?

646
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,790
I thought I was in love with you,
but it was just a lie.

647
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,350
I wanted it to work,
but unfortunately I feel nothing.

648
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:01,116
- Why are you doing this?
- I wanted to get you into bed.

649
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,512
You don't mean that.

650
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:10,071
You know nothing.
You don't even know me.

651
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,516
The fact is,
there is someone I love.

652
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:18,708
- You don't even compare to her.
- I don't believe you.

653
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:25,433
I don't know how to make it clearer.
You mean nothing to me.

654
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,116
You were just...
You were just a conquest.

655
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,317
You're such a coward.
Look, you're shaking.

656
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:40,158
- Is that what you came to tell me?
- I'm sorry. I'm completely...

657
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,993
You're completely fucked up.

658
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,510
Get out.

659
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,034
Get out!

660
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,198
Don't touch me...
Don't touch me.

661
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,198
Don't fucking touch me, Sebastian!

662
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,953
Just leave.

663
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,917
Jesus...
A bit melodramatic, don't you think?

664
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,278
I thought you'd like to know
what happened with Annette.

665
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,358
It's over.

666
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,591
- Really?
- You were right.

667
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,548
I can't change.
You and I are two of a kind.

668
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:29,912
- I thought we should celebrate.
- Sorry. I'm expecting some company.

669
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:37,636
- Who? Ronald?
- Not that it concerns you, but yes.

670
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,236
From Ronald.
I haven't had a chance to read it, -

671
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:47,838
- but I'm pretty sure
it goes something like:

672
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,677
"You mean a lot to me,
I hope we can be friends, etc. "

673
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:03,275
I expected this shit, so I took the
liberty of getting them together.

674
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:08,594
You were right. You do get dumped
for the innocent little twits.

675
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,788
- Well done.
- Thank you.

676
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:17,669
Now... Where were we?

677
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,391
Oh yes, the celebration.

678
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,838
- What shall we toast to?
- To my triumph.

679
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:39,352
Not my choice, but it's your call.
To your triumph over Annette.

680
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:47,275
- What's so funny?
- Silly boy...

681
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,830
My triumph isn't over her.

682
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,278
- It's over you.
- Again?

683
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:04,675
You were very much in love with her.
And you're still in love with her.

684
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:08,719
But it amused me
to make you ashamed of it.

685
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:14,750
You gave up your first love because
I threatened your reputation.

686
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:21,634
Don't you get it?
You're just a toy, Sebastian.

687
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,952
A little toy I like to play with.

688
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:29,032
And now you've blown it with her.

689
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:34,558
I think it's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

690
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:39,077
Cheers.

691
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,430
It tastes good.

692
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:59,035
You came to make arrangements,
but I don't fuck losers.

693
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,995
Goodbye, Sebastian.

694
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,793
<i>- It's imperative I talk to her.
- She's not here.</i>

695
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,511
<i>- Will you please tell her I called?
- Of course I will.</i>

696
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,593
- Yes?
- I need to speak to Annette.

697
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,878
She's not here.
I'm entertaining some guests...

698
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,596
I already told you she is not here.

699
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,877
- Will you see she gets this?
- Yes.

700
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,873
- It's really important.
- I understand.

701
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:37,513
I'm terribly sorry. You never know
who's going to show up here.

702
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,872
<i>"Dear Annette, what can I say to
rectify the harm I've caused you?"</i>

703
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,556
<i>"Being with you was the only time
I've ever been happy. "</i>

704
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,508
<i>"My whole life has been a joke. "</i>

705
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:12,116
<i>"I prided myself on taking joy
in others' misery. "</i>

706
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:16,831
<i>"Well, it finally backfired. "</i>

707
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,675
<i>"I succeeded in hurting
the first person I loved. "</i>

708
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,031
<i>"Enclosed is my most
prized possession. My journal. "</i>

709
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:33,592
<i>"I considered it my trophy.
A collection of my conquests. "</i>

710
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:40,237
<i>"If you want to know the truth,
please read it. No more lies. "</i>

711
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:57,753
<i>"Please give me another chance.
I'm a wreck without you. "</i>

712
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:30,037
<i>- Ronald? It's Kathryn.
- What's up?</i>

713
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,919
<i>- Is everything okay?
- No.</i>

714
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,471
It's Sebastian.
He's out of his mind.

715
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:45,033
He hit me, then he took off.
I'm afraid to be alone.

716
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,192
<i>- Ronald, I really need you.
- Settle down.</i>

717
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:54,151
<i>There's more.
It involves Cecile.</i>

718
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,108
<i>Stay there. I'll be right over.</i>

719
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,476
Son of a bitch...

720
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,434
- Valmont!
- Hey, Ronald.

721
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:25,913
- We have some talking to do.
- Later. I've had a real bad night.

722
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,392
- What's your problem?
- Why did you hit Kathryn?

723
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,236
She got to you, too...
You don't know what you're saying.

724
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,359
She also said you fucked Cecile.

725
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,798
- It's true, isn't it?
- Ronald, I'm sorry...

726
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,788
Sebastian?

727
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,674
Sebastian!

728
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,075
Stop it!

729
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,915
Annette!

730
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,991
Sebastian...

731
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:42,118
- I love you, Annette.
- I love you, too.

732
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,794
Just hold on...

733
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:07,078
As the new headmaster
of Manchester Prep -

734
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:12,394
- it saddens me to start our
new year with such a mournful tone.

735
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:39,074
- I didn't know anyone was in here.
- I'm sorry.

736
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:42,550
- Annette Hargrove.
- Kathryn Merteuil.

737
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,838
- Have we met?
- I don't think so.

738
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,949
- Your father's the new headmaster?
- That's right.

739
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:56,193
I'm sorry to hear
about your brother. Are you okay?

740
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:01,593
I'll be fine.
Did you know Sebastian?

741
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,593
You might say that.

742
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,389
Such a tragedy, isn't it?

743
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:13,990
Yes, it is.
I'll leave you alone now.

744
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,279
I'm here if you need a friend.

745
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,591
That's great.

746
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,594
Sometimes when I feel
I can't go on, -

747
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,276
- I turn to Jesus,
and He helps me through it.

748
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:39,151
- Thank you.
- I'll see you around campus.

749
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,632
Looking forward to it...

750
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,394
...freak.

751
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,428
Here we go.

752
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:00,070
However dark the cloud,
there's always a silver lining.

753
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:05,394
It might be hard to see,
but what we should learn from this -

754
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:09,792
- is to be true to ourselves
and to resist peer pressure.

755
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:16,513
As student body president I've tried
to set an example in myself.

756
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:23,028
Unfortunately, I couldn't reach out
to my stepbrother in time.

757
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:28,228
I know he's looking down
on us today and...

758
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:34,994
I know he'd want me to say...

759
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,677
He'd want me to say, "Kathryn... "

760
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:47,755
He'd want me to say,
"Kathryn, I'm sorry. "

761
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,754
What is going on?
Don't you have any respect?

762
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:29,436
