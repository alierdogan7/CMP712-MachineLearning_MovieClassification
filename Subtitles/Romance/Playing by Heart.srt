Really terrific. And I go
and hear him jam every month or so.

3
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:27,796
And he plays this piece I love:
an old Chet Baker song.

4
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:32,174
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

And we had drinks one night--
when I used to drink--

00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,784

how that song made me feel...

his head, and he said...

00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:27,516
You know me, Mom. I've never been
one to have a lot of friends.

172
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:31,580
Besides, I seem to be
the last of my small crowd.

173
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,716
What about your roommate Jack?

174
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:40,260
He wasn't my roommate, Mother,
and he died a year ago.

175
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:47,106
Hey, how's the commercial going?

176
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,107
It's on hold for a week.

177
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:53,737
The geniuses at Pacific Motors
have now decided to spotlight the car...

178
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:55,747
and dumb down the concept.

179
00:13:55,815 --> 00:14:00,479
- No Fellini?
- Who? Most definitely no Fellini.

180
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:03,215
But my play's not falling apart.

181
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,314
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

182
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:07,484
Bosco, where do you keep
Theater Week?

183
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,587
Top shelf. Between Psychology Today
and Martha Stewart Living.

184
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,234
Uh-oh!
Whoa!

185
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,396
Jesus! Meredith?

186
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:22,464
Jimmy, grab that side! Grab that side.
Okay. Everyone. All right, fellas.

187
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:26,137
On three. One--
Oh. Okay. All right.

188
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,874
- Can we say "lawsuit"?
- Uh, are you okay?

189
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,974
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.
I landed on a stack of George.

190
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:35,145
- Plenty of padding.
- Meet the architect.

191
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:39,351
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

192
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:42,917
- If I can just find one,
Theater Week is on me.
- And dinner is on me.

193
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:46,954
- No, no. Not necessary. Truly.
- Please. I insist.
It's the least I can do. I mean--

194
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,400
- Look, I'm not gonna sue you, okay?
- I didn't think you were gonna sue me.

195
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:55,636
Not that I couldn't, mind you.
But something tells me...

196
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,973
that you'd be able to convince
the jury that this was my fault.

197
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:03,846
You know I'm not just asking you
to dinner as a preemptive strike
against litigation.

198
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,407
- I'm asking because--
- I'll have dinner with you.

199
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:11,318
- What changed your mind?
- Anybody who can say
"preemptive strike...

200
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,484
against litigation" with a straight face
deserves a dinner companion.

201
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,393
- [Chuckles]
- Thank you.

202
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:20,088
This is last week's.

203
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:23,930
I'm thinking of putting
the show on hiatus.

204
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,597
And I'm thinking
you'll do no such thing.

205
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:32,008
- But, Paul--
- No. I don't want anything
to be any different.

206
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,809
- Things are different.
- I don't want to have a fight with you.

207
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:39,078
I don't want a fight. I just--
I just want to talk and make--

208
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:43,485
Look. What about what I want?
You've always controlled everything:

209
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:45,547
your shows, the kids.

210
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,355
Stop trying to control me.

211
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,418
I'm not trying
to control anybody.

212
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,294
- I just think maybe--
- Don't think.

213
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:57,166
Let us just proceed as if
nothing has changed. All right?

214
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:05,435
- I don't know if I can do that.
- You have no choice.

215
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:10,611
I may have just enough time left
to become an alcoholic.

216
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:17,255
% [Techno]

217
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:32,262
%

218
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,045
I don't care who had her first. I poke
around her stool looking for worms.

219
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,179
I feed the fucking thing.
I take her to the vet.

220
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:52,383
All you do is pet her twice a day.

221
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,359
Which is a hell of a lot more
than you've been doing to me lately.

222
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,589
Okay, let's discuss this calmly.

223
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:01,429
We're adults.
We've been together a long time.

224
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,866
Well, not a long time,
but an adequate four months.

225
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:07,804
Adequate until you fuckin' cheated on me
with that skag from Bloomingdale's!

226
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,807
You fu--
Harry?

227
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,538
Don't you dare hang up.
Harry! Harry?

228
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:17,305
Shit! Shit.

229
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:27,251
Hi. You got a quarter?

230
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:33,798
Thank you.

231
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:41,205
The fucking cat is mine.

232
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,173
No, no.
On this I'm not negotiable, Harry.

233
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:48,179
Harry. Hey! Hey!
Don't be a fuckin' infant, okay?

234
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:52,206
You can take anything that came
from IKEA. I want the cat,
and I want Pottery Barn.

235
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,718
It--
One more time.

236
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:57,688
You hang up one more time and l--
[Slams Down Receiver]

237
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:59,691
Damn it.

238
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:05,923
- It's my last one.
- Negotiations are almost over.

239
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,901
Thank you.

240
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,473
All right. Okay, scumbag.
You're robbing me blind...

241
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:21,343
but I will give up Pottery Barn
if I can just have the cat.

242
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:26,215
No! No. Pottery Barn does not
include Williams Sonoma.

243
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:29,482
They're two separate
establishments, Harry.

244
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,989
Oh, Christ on crutches!
Okay, you know what, Harry?

245
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:36,016
I want to get rid of you as much as l
want to get rid of that junk from IKEA.

246
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,529
So here's the thing.

247
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:42,590
You can walk away with Pottery Barn,
Williams Sonoma, IKEA.

248
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:47,537
And just to show you that I'm
a grown-up, I will throw in all
the crap from Hold Everything!

249
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,404
Yeah! Yeah, that includes
the hanging shoe sorter.

250
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:54,344
That's right.
Do we have a deal? Great.

251
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:57,507
So here's the thing.
I will be home in two hours.

252
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,916
You and all your junk
from the catalogs will be gone...

253
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:03,614
and the cat will be there waiting
for me, purring contentedly.

254
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:11,756
Well, the least I can do
after taking your last quarter
is let you buy me a drink.

255
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,636
I work in the Twin Towers.
Entertainment law.

256
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:32,148
- And you?
- Me?

257
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:34,345
I'm not very good company.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

258
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,656
No problem.

259
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:45,322
- I'm not gonna bother you.
- Uh, don't go. l-l-I'm sorry.

260
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:48,332
- No, I'm sorry. Really.
- Again, I'm sorry.

261
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:53,902
- You've had a bad day.
- A killer.

262
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:58,239
You know, yesterday I would have
said that things couldn't
possibly get any worse.

263
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,744
They sure as hell
got worse today.

264
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:06,148
I'm, uh--
I work in the, uh, Twin Towers too.

265
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:09,710
I'm a development executive
over at ABC.

266
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:13,554
I'm responsible for all those shit shows
that you don't watch on Thursday night.

267
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:15,992
You're to blame for those?

268
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:18,427
- Afraid so.
- [Laughs]

269
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:20,431
Everybody blames me.

270
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:24,458
My boss, my wife, my secretary.

271
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,471
Hell, even my kids.
They watch NBC.

272
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,270
And I work like a dog...

273
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:34,039
trying to find some way to fix
the Thursday night schedule.

274
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,680
Well, I don't find a way to fix
the Thursday night schedule...

275
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,880
and my boss,
today he tells me...

276
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:46,857
that coming into the office
tomorrow isn't necessary.

277
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:51,659
Or coming in ever again,
for that matter.

278
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:56,991
[Sighs] I wish you could
spend the night.

279
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,003
You know I can't.

280
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,566
- Is this all you want from us?
- Roger...

281
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:06,168
and I mean this really sweetly,
there isn't any us.

282
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:10,045
- Mmm. There's only this.
- Well, this could be different.

283
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:12,242
Well, anything
can be different.

284
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:14,479
But I don't want this to be.

285
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:19,422
I want it to be what it is:
two very sexually compatible
people enjoying each other...

286
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:22,892
with no obligations,
no complications...

287
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:25,260
no individual history,
no mutual history...

288
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,765
[Slaps Roger]
and no guilt.

289
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,324
- That's awfully cold.
- It's awfully realistic.

290
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:33,428
- I know you don't love your husband.
- Oh, but I know...

291
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:36,133
that you do love your wife.

292
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:43,480
I'll have a vodka martini,
very dry and straight up...

293
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:48,577
- with three olives,
and my sullen friend here will have--
- A Coke.

294
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:52,283
The poster boy for designated drivers
will have a Coke.

295
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,222
- The guy on the phone?
- Harry.

296
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,787
Harry, right.
We were together for five months.

297
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:02,425
- I thought it was four.
- You were paying attention.

298
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,765
Everyone in this club
was paying attention.

299
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:07,271
We were together for five months.
But I knew it wasn't gonna work out...

300
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:10,900
'cause the first time he comes over
I find out that he sits down to pee.

301
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:14,434
- You don't do that, do you?
- No.

302
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:16,481
So fuckin' lazy.
And in my experience...

303
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:20,177
it extends to other aspects
of an individual's personality.

304
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:25,087
Last time I saw him, Harry was wearing a
blue sweater and an idiotic expression.

305
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:27,557
The sweater was new.

306
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,787
Here's to good riddance Harry.

307
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:32,797
Good riddance Harry.

308
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:44,974
Hey, again please.

309
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:48,207
And drier this time,
and three olives, not two.

310
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,714
Three.
Nutritional value.

311
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,774
Now, where were we?
Oh, so Harry.

312
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:55,183
Right.

313
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:57,313
The sex part wasn't bad.

314
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:59,323
You know, for a while.

315
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:04,488
And then his consummate laziness
and lack of imagination
became tediously self-evident.

316
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:09,557
Every time, everything was
exactly the same as the time previous.

317
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:13,935
It was as if he had followed
some step-by-step instructional video.

318
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:17,498
And about two weeks ago,
guess what I found in the apartment.

319
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:22,570
- A step-by-step instructional video.
- Right! Here's the topper.

320
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:25,708
I timed his performance
one night. Right?

321
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:29,151
And then I checked the running time
on the video. And guess what.

322
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,815
- To the minute.
- Right down to it.

323
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,824
Twenty-three minutes, to be exact.

324
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,826
Including credits.

325
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:40,456
Anyway, he's history.

326
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:43,626
- But I still have Blanche.
- Who would be the cat.

327
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,193
Oh, a great cat.
Very feline.

328
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:48,364
The best cats are.

329
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,001
Blanche can look at you with a gaze
of unflappable superiority...

330
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:56,480
that seems to spring from near total
detachment and disinterest.

331
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,680
Not unlike
how you're looking at me now.

332
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,824
Thank you.

333
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:11,491
You don't say very much, do you?

334
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:15,499
- Does anyone, when they're with you?
- Don't get mean.

335
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:21,597
We don't know each other well enough
yet. When we do, then you can get mean.

336
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,774
So we should do this again sometime.

337
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:30,303
- We're not doing anything.
- Okay. Then let's not do this.

338
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:33,010
Let's do something else.

339
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,383
I'll even let you be the man.
You can decide where we go on our date.

340
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:40,456
I don't date.

341
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:44,292
Well. Gee, I don't have
a witty comeback for that one.

342
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:46,627
I mean, I'm used to
any number of brush-offs...

343
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:49,166
but that's, uh, that's a new one.

344
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:52,203
Doesn't date.

345
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:55,729
I'll admit I've seen you around. You're
always-- You're always dancing alone.

346
00:24:57,576 --> 00:25:00,409
- That's the way I like it.
- Why is that?

347
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:05,011
I don't want to be
rude or unkind...

348
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,517
or... mean.

349
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:13,087
But I just don't come out with my entire
life story over martinis and a Coke.

350
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,229
I'm sorry, really.

351
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:21,823
Your cat's lucky to have you.

352
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:33,344
My wife had moved them out.

353
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:36,210
Moved everything out.
Left a note.

354
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:38,613
Very thoughtful.
Didn't realize she felt that way.

355
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:40,515
What way?

356
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:46,791
That I was a failure.

357
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:50,659
Not only professionally,
but personally as well.

358
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:54,563
Just like ABC no longer required
my services. She let me know...

359
00:25:54,633 --> 00:26:00,071
that she and the kids no longer
required my services or my presence.

360
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:04,234
It turns out she's been
seeing some guy for a year...

361
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,437
for a fucking year,
and I never suspected a thing.

362
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:09,810
- And you know what the worst of it is?
- What?

363
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:12,680
The guy that she left me for?
The fucker works for NBC!

364
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:16,187
He's got my wife and my kids,
my cat and my dog...

365
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:20,021
and he doesn't have to lose
any sleep over the Thursday
night fucking schedule!

366
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,630
Honey?

367
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:34,570
You should come to bed.
What are you working on so late?

368
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,972
I was just checking on
your TV residuals.

369
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,442
They're still robbing us blind.

370
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:42,605
I happen to know you're
a tremendous hit on WWFU.

371
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,376
Which is where?

372
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:46,610
Intercourse, Pennsylvania.

373
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:49,210
Oh, Intercourse.

374
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:51,756
And they can't get enough
of you in Intercourse.

375
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:53,757
And I know exactly
how they feel.

376
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:58,424
- Bed.
- [Imitates Dog Panting]

377
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,595
- Come on, Molly. Come on, Crackers.
- [Dog Whimpers]

378
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:14,169
[Waiter]
There you are, sir. Okay?

379
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:18,478
- Cheers.
- I've been meaning to ask you
about your wedding ring.

380
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:24,955
It's really just force
of habit. l, uh...

381
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:29,255
divorced...
four chilling years ago.

382
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:33,059
- Acrimonious?
- No.

383
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:36,328
Oh, wait, that means
hostile and bitter. Yes.

384
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:40,269
In the divorce papers she referred to me
as the "architect of her misfortune."

385
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:45,002
- Ouch.
- Yeah. No kids, luckily.

386
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:49,673
I wanted them,
but she didn't.

387
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:51,682
- You know, if this makes you
uncomfortable--
- No.

388
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,082
- I can take it off, the ring.
It's not a problem.
- No, no. Stop.

389
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:58,612
Don't be silly.
That would be two of us being silly.

390
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,717
I really only wear it to keep
the construction guys from harassing me.

391
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:06,692
- Does it work?
- [Chuckles]

392
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:09,825
Depends on what I'm wearing.
[Chuckles]

393
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:16,432
[Sighs] I think you can tell
that I'm not very good at this.

394
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:22,342
- You're charming.
- [Laughs]

395
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:27,313
- And real.
- [Laughing]

396
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,854
Lovely.

397
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:32,219
What did I say?

398
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,349
Nothing.

399
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,417
No, no. Nothing.

400
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:39,589
I just, um--

401
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:44,795
Before I came here tonight,
I was discussing you with my sister.

402
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,362
We were coming up with
a psychological profile.

403
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,374
Several, actually.

404
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:54,310
- And which did I fit into?
- Oh, none.

405
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:57,576
I think I'm gonna have to
revise the filing system.

406
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,608
Put you in
the "too good to be true" category.

407
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:05,622
Mmm.
But not to worry.

408
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,523
I just know you'll turn out
to be involved with somebody else...

409
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:12,120
or... gay or crazy.

410
00:29:13,432 --> 00:29:16,333
[Sighs]

411
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:19,370
Well, it's a definite possibility.

412
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,074
Crazy, huh?

413
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:27,177
Certifiable.

414
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,179
- [Sighs]
- [TV, Indistinct]

415
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:32,983
Mom.

416
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:36,979
I know you've spoken to my doctor.

417
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:40,183
I know. I know he told you
I don't have long...

418
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:42,726
so let's not pretend
that I do, okay?

419
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:46,797
Want to watch another movie?

420
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:49,425
No. God, no.

421
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,861
I tell you what I would like,
is I'd like to play a game.

422
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,071
- Should I get a deck of cards?
- No. Not that kind of game.

423
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:03,979
- What?
- I want each of us to take some time...

424
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:08,247
and think of something that we have
always wanted to tell the other.

425
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:12,017
Something private, some secret...

426
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,490
some feeling or memory.

427
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,120
It could be anything.
Just as long as it's truthful.

428
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:21,495
Uh, I don't know
if I'd be good at that kind of game.

429
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,466
Will you try for me?

430
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:29,937
[Sighs]

431
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:31,942
Um--

432
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:45,487
I'm waiting.

433
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:50,594
I never loved your father.

434
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:52,596
Not for a minute.

435
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:57,264
Wow. You're good at this.

436
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,267
- Why did you marry him?
- Oh.

437
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:06,367
I was pushing 30.

438
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:10,312
Back then we called that
a last chance for happiness.

439
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:13,874
He had a good business.
I remember my mother saying, "Marry him.

440
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:16,045
He's an undertaker
and will never be out of work.

441
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,021
People will always--"

442
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,959
People will always die.

443
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:27,631
People will always die.

444
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:38,934
I hope it's okay for me
to say this, but...

445
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,377
you strike me
as someone who's been...

446
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:44,847
burned romantically.

447
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,611
Scalded.

448
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:51,383
Repeatedly.

449
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:54,687
- Married?
- [Sighs]

450
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,024
- Divorced?
- Yes.

451
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,223
But that was a long time ago...

452
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:02,562
and, believe it or not,
one of my better experiences.

453
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,568
[Chuckles]
Let me guess.

454
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:07,799
Uh, he was either involved
with somebody else...

455
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:09,999
or gay...

456
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,009
or crazy.

457
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:14,011
Actually, yes.

458
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:18,409
Involved with someone else?

459
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:22,214
- Crazy?
- No. He was gay.

460
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:24,551
- Wow. Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,353
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- No.

462
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:29,620
- I mean, I'm not sorry. I mean, uh--
- [Laughs]

463
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:34,021
- Save me.
- It's okay.

464
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,659
He was a great guy.

465
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:40,694
I married the boy next door.
Literally. We were 19.

466
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,741
It didn't last very long.
Couldn't, of course.

467
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:49,174
I haven't seen him in a long time,
but, uh, but we're still friends.

468
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:53,547
Which is more than I can say for the
parade of total losers that followed.

469
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:58,214
Are there any, uh,
recent or current losers?

470
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,281
No.

471
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:04,385
I've been in a holding pattern
where romance is concerned.

472
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:07,989
- Well, things can change quickly.
- Yeah.

473
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,664
I'm sorry.

474
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,801
This is, uh, going
a little too quickly for me.

475
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,680
I can go slow.

476
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,783
Look, Trent,
you're a nice guy. l--

477
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:30,947
- Aw! Aw. That's-- You know?
- What?

478
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,456
- I'm swimming ashore.
You can call the Coast Guard.
- Oh, come on.

479
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,925
"Nice guy"? That's--

480
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:40,363
I haven't been dismissed
with that since high school.

481
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:42,923
Does that mean no second date?

482
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:45,333
I have a hard time trusting men.

483
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:49,237
I'm not men.
I'm not a group. Just me.

484
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,875
Who probably has
a lot of women after him.

485
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:56,141
- So?
- So--

486
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:58,808
Look, you know,
you seem to want honesty...

487
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,817
so I'll be honest with you.

488
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,046
I don't really have
a problem getting dates.

489
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:06,648
But I'm 38 years old.
I don't just want dates anymore.

490
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:09,193
I'll tell you what I don't want.

491
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,627
I don't want all of
this calculated artificiality.

492
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:17,794
This isn't me, Trent--
this dress, the stupid little bows
in my hair. And look at you.

493
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,862
I mean, I don't imagine you sit around
your house in an Armani suit. Do you?

494
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,341
No. My house is black-tie.

495
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,344
[Giggles]

496
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:34,341
- Look, I'm sorry, but--
- I know, you have to go.

497
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:37,786
- I'm already-- Jesus-- two hours late.
- You're leavin' me too.

498
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,654
It's okay. Really.
Just go. Go.

499
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:44,889
- Until the day I die,
I'll remember that story.
- Yeah, listen. Listen.

500
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:49,059
You have been swell,
listening to me like this.

501
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:53,662
Bet you'll think twice about striking up
a conversation in this bar again, huh?

502
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:56,104
[Chuckles]
Take care. All right?

503
00:34:56,174 --> 00:34:58,642
- For once I really, really mean that.
- Yeah.

504
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,076
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

505
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:08,819
Taxi money.

506
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:11,355
Don't even think of allowing
that guy to drive.

507
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:14,119
I'm a lawyer.
I'll hunt you down.

508
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,963
Look, Trent...

509
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:26,333
if by some miracle,
after this explosion of neuroses...

510
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,804
you still want to see me,
we can start from the top.

511
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:31,307
You can cook dinner
for me Tuesday.

512
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,978
- Okay.
- Good.

513
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:38,615
- Tuesday.
- Yeah.

514
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:41,846
- You can come to my apartment.
- Okay.

515
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,083
Meet my better half.

516
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:49,559
- Better half?
- Yeah. My dog. Barley.

517
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,357
Your dog Barley? That'd be great.
I'd love to meet Barley.

518
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,364
- Good.
- I'll bring the wine.

519
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:56,559
- Great.
- Good.

520
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:59,228
- Tuesday night.
- Absolutely.

521
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:03,070
You know, Meredith,
those stupid little bows?

522
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:06,076
I think they're adorable.

523
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:23,920
[Sighs]

524
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:26,957
Why did you stay with him?

525
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:30,290
Well, you.

526
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:34,525
I guess I was the last generation
of women who actually did that.

527
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:38,365
It never even occurred to me
to get a divorce.

528
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:42,463
[Sighs]
I was so relieved when he died.

529
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,876
- Don't hold anything back, Mom.
- [Chuckles] Mmm.

530
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:51,905
Ah, I like this
new spirit of frankness.

531
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:54,543
It's oddly cleansing.

532
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:08,058
I want to know
what you're like away from me here.

533
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:12,296
That can't happen. The fact that you and
I aren't involved beyond this room...

534
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,702
is what-- ahh-- appeals to me.

535
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:18,765
You know how to play
your role damn well.

536
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,539
[Laughs]
Guilty as charged.

537
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:26,383
[Moans]

538
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:34,554
- Roger, what do you want?
- I don't want much.

539
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:37,754
I just want more of you.

540
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,731
I can't give you that.

541
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:47,964
Roger.
Don't be an anger ball.

542
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,973
"An anger ball"?

543
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:54,977
Don't you see?
What's great about you and me...

544
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:59,881
right here, this very moment,
is that we don't come through
that door with a lot of baggage.

545
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:03,717
We don't come through that door
with any baggage at all.

546
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:07,747
And aren't we lucky?
We don't bring anything in...

547
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:11,124
and we don't take anything out.

You're not the only one
who can dance alone.

551
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:33,483

- I said you look like
a man in need of a Coke.

Uh, my friend here will have a Coke,
and I'll have a--

555
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:50,261
Vodka martini,
very dry, three olives.

556
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,268
Good memory.

557
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:55,499
My mind has an endless capacity
for useless information.

558
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:00,671
I've had a terrible day.

559
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:04,112
I know we were talking about you for
a moment there, but my day was so bad.

560
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,650
"How bad was it?" you might ask.

561
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:09,744
-l might if you gave me the opportunity.
-l was saving you the effort...

562
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,756
so that after I tell you my tale of woe
we can move on to happier topics.

563
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:16,590
Perhaps one of your choosing. Anyway,
I'm an actress. Did I tell you that?

564
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:21,030
- No. But I'm not surprised.
- I had this monologue in class today.

565
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:24,762
And I was prepared.
You know, I mean, like really prepared.

566
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:27,168
You know Suddenly Last Summer
by Tennessee Williams?

567
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:30,867
- No.
- Oh, it's one of my favorites.
Great story.

568
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:33,638
It's about this girl, Katherine-- moi--

569
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:37,442
who is slated for a lobotomy
because the mother of her cousin
wants to keep her mouth shut...

570
00:40:37,515 --> 00:40:40,916
about certain goings-on involving
the old lady's son Sebastian.

571
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:45,115
You see, the women sort of pimp
for Cousin Sebastian.
Are you following this?

572
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:46,986
- Amazingly, yes.
- Anyway, it turns out...

573
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:51,154
on their travels together Cousin
Sebastian liked to troll the beaches...

574
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:55,689
looking for young native boys
in order to satisfy his base instincts.

575
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:58,497
One hot afternoon in Cartagena...

576
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:02,232
the boys decide they have had quite
enough of Sebastian's shenanigans...

577
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:05,742
and they--
well, they eat him.

578
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,337
- You mean metaphorically.
- No. They really eat him.

579
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:14,077
They devour him.
In short, he's lunch.

580
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:17,019
And Katherine witnesses
every course...

581
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:19,420
from soup to nuts.

582
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,720
If you'll pardon the expression.

583
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:25,320
Anyway, I'm about to do
this killer monologue. I'm up next--

584
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:28,957
If one more actor saunters
into this class...

585
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:33,834
and recites Katherine's "native boys
ate my cousin Sebastian" speech...

586
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:36,100
from Suddenly Last Summer...

587
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:39,041
I am going to puke.

588
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,477
Now, who is up next?

589
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:47,808
- Um... Joan! You're on.
- [Moans]

590
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:52,950
The teacher didn't lose
his lunch. I did.

591
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:56,789
- I'm sorry.
- So am l.

592
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:03,828
Now, on to happier topics, I promise.
How about a movie?

593
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:05,732
- I told you.
- I know.

594
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:08,636
I know. You don't date.
Is it a religious thing?

595
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:12,767
- No.
- Well, you like movies, don't you?

596
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:14,778
- They're okay.
- How about tomorrow night?

597
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:17,644
It doesn't have to be a date.
We'll meet at the theater.

598
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,979
- I don't know.
- Look. I'll make it easy.
Okay, blue boy?

599
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:26,888
Tomorrow night I'm going to the
late show of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre
at the Sunset Five.

If you decide you would like to
join the human race, meet me there.

601
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:39,700
Uh, now, in other news, they found
a cure for cancer. Okay. Uh, moving on.

602
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,898
-No, they--
-[Hannah] Do you ever hear from Wendy?

- What on Earth made you think of Wendy?

604

- Oh, I don't know.
Just thinking about the old days.
- Yes.

605
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,715
Very old. Ancient.

00:42:55,353 --> 00:43:00,154
Well, do you?
Do you ever hear from her?

Any reason I should?

00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:05,753
Any reason you should keep
her picture in your desk?

- [TV Volume Increases]
- None that you should
concern yourself with.

611
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:21,510

talking about. Are you on it yet?

612
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:23,740
Just the men.
Okay, uh, well...

613
00:43:23,814 --> 00:43:26,044
it's so successful,
you know, of course--

614
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:38,361
- Hey. I made it.
- Hi.

615
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:42,559
- Uh, casually attired.
- Wow.

616
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:45,067
Yeah, I know. The flowers are
a little much, and I'm late.

617
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:47,263
But only because I had second thoughts
about the flowers...

618
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:50,364
and I threw them away halfway down the
block, and then I had third thoughts...

619
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:52,466
and went back and got them.

620
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,807
Well, I'm glad you did.

621
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:57,177

- I do.

- Wow! That's a--

- Barley.
- That's some dog! That's, uh--

- Barley, get down, sweetie.
Come on. Come on.
- Whoa.

That's certainly impressive.

a little inadequate. That's--

631

I, uh-- It's almost ready.
I, uh--

632
00:44:26,677 --> 00:44:31,341
Sorry that took me so long. I was
on the phone with one of my sisters.

633
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,177
- The married one.
- The one who's having an affair?

634
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:38,483
Yeah, well, the one
who's always having an affair.

635
00:44:38,556 --> 00:44:40,820
Her husband doesn't
suspect anything?

636
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:44,520
Her husband is sweet,
but he's a bit dim.

637
00:44:46,063 --> 00:44:48,657
He doesn't have
much of an imagination.

638
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:51,668
Chandler girls like their men
with imagination?

639
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:54,034
Yeah. It helps.

640
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:59,639
You know, I'm told
I have a good imagination.

641
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:03,840
I don't want
to have sex tonight.

642
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:10,884
- Okay.
- I mean if that's why you thought
I invited you over here--

643
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:13,082
- I invited myself over here.
- Well, whatever.

644
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:16,149
- I mean, I know that
must be kind of unusual.
- It's not unusual. l--

645
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:18,161
I mean, I'm sure that most women
don't turn you down. [Muttering]

646
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:20,629
Meredith, can we talk about
something else?

647
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:23,326
Honestly, sex is the last thing
on my mind right now.

648
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:25,631
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

649
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:28,866
Okay. Okay.

Want a taste? I mean, l-I'm sorry
if I ruined your plans. That's all.

651
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:35,511
I didn't have any plans!
I just think--

652
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,013
You know, you've got
a few too many rules working for you...

653
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:41,051
and way too many rules
workin' against me!

654
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:44,315
- [Drops Spoon]
- I really like you, but--

655
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,982
This kind of thing
is pissing me off.

656
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:53,158
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

657
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:59,395
I can't understand why you haven't had
a relationship lately.

658
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:06,103
Really?
Well, that doesn't take long, does it?

659
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:08,407
- What doesn't?

- Oh, don't.

826
00:56:08,909 --> 00:56:11,002
- I didn't.
- Don't.

827
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:14,707
I just loved her...

828
00:56:14,782 --> 00:56:16,716
differently.

829
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:18,718
Differently.

830
00:56:18,786 --> 00:56:20,720
Mm-hmm.

831
00:56:23,023 --> 00:56:25,651
And you really didn't
sleep with her?

832
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:27,660
No.

833
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:31,793
[Sighs]
Of course not.

834
00:56:31,865 --> 00:56:35,130
And you didn't want
to sleep with her?

835
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:37,796
Oh, good God, yes, I did.

836
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:44,705
You bastard.
You bastard!

- [Muttering]
- What--

838
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,144
- Hey!
- Just don't touch me! Just--

839
00:56:49,216 --> 00:56:51,810
I've had it!

840
00:56:51,885 --> 00:56:53,944
- Well, you did ask.
- [Huffs]

841
00:56:57,224 --> 00:56:59,158
Oh, boy.

842
00:57:10,738 --> 00:57:14,265
A couple times during the movie
I thought you ducked out on me.

843
00:57:14,341 --> 00:57:16,275
I had to use the bathroom.

844
00:57:16,343 --> 00:57:19,608
Well, at crucial times like
these, you should inform a girl
about having a small bladder.

845
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,444
It saves her
from abandonment fantasies.

846
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:25,952
Would it help at all
if I told you I didn't sit down to pee?

847
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:28,613
In this theater,
I don't sit down to pee.

848
00:57:36,196 --> 00:57:38,130
Going dancing?

849
00:57:38,198 --> 00:57:40,291
Maybe.

850
00:57:40,367 --> 00:57:42,631
I'm not asking
to go with you, you know.

851
00:57:42,703 --> 00:57:45,137
We can take this slowly.

852
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:48,299
Joan, this isn't anything.

853
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:51,970
It's not anything now,
and it won't be anything ever.

854

Wow. Message received.
End of date.

855
00:57:57,384 --> 00:57:59,648
- I'll walk you to your car.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

856

That is so sweet.
He never wants to see her again...

857
00:58:01,722 --> 00:58:04,316
but he doesn't want her to be
dismembered in the underground parking.

858
00:58:04,391 --> 00:58:08,327
- Where are you parked?
- On the "Artist formerly
known as Prince" level.

00:58:16,537 --> 00:58:19,267
Which one is yours?

860
00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:21,933

861
00:58:22,009 --> 00:58:25,445
Uh, there's nothing in space 23.

I cannot believe this!

867
00:58:41,795 --> 00:58:43,729
Maybe you remembered wrong. Maybe
you're on the Rolling Stones level.

868
00:58:43,797 --> 00:58:46,231
- No!
- The Madonna level?

869
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,396
- I wouldn't be caught dead
on the Madonna level.
- We'll call the police.

870
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:54,463
- I'm sure they'll be able to find it.
- I can't fucking believe this!

871
00:58:56,043 --> 00:58:58,511
My parents bought me that car.

- That's the ugliest cat I've ever seen.

- She's an angel.
- She only has one eye.

Yeah, but it's her good one. Come on,
Blanche. That mean man won't hurt you.

Um, I should--
I should be going.

885

- I don't drink coffee.

Go ahead.

- Wow.

You should write
these kiss-offs down.

They'd be perfect for a chapter
called, "Piercing the heart
in exactly ten words."

But I'm not right for you." Yep.

01:06:20,487 --> 01:06:22,455
Good. We must go and give
your mother the good news.

996
01:06:22,522 --> 01:06:24,922
And I'll go count my money.

997

[Crowd Chatting]

999
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:45,769
- We're a hit.
- Yeah, well, let's see
what the critics have to say.

1000
01:06:45,845 --> 01:06:47,904
Hey, who cares
what the critics have to say?

1001
01:06:47,981 --> 01:06:49,915
- I do.
- I do.

1002
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,917
- Okay.
- I'm sure they'll love it.

1003
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:57,481
It was a good play.

1004
01:06:57,557 --> 01:07:00,321
You mean before
I deconstructed it?

1005
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:02,486
Uh, before and after.

1006
01:07:02,562 --> 01:07:05,531
I'd say it was the perfect blend
of Moliere and Meredith.

1007
01:07:05,598 --> 01:07:08,158
I'm glad you came.

1008
01:07:08,234 --> 01:07:12,034
-Last time we saw each other was a bit--
-Yeah, I know.

1009
01:07:12,105 --> 01:07:14,266
It didn't quite go
as I had hoped.

1010
01:07:14,341 --> 01:07:16,434
You don't have to apologize.

1011
01:07:16,509 --> 01:07:18,602
I'm not...
apologizing.

1012
01:07:18,678 --> 01:07:21,078
I didn't do anything wrong.

1013
01:07:22,182 --> 01:07:24,946
- Oh, and I did, I suppose.
- Uh-huh.

1014
01:07:25,018 --> 01:07:28,545
But I've decided
not to let you get away with it.

1015
01:07:28,621 --> 01:07:31,112
So, I'm inviting you
to dinner...

1016
01:07:31,191 --> 01:07:33,125
at my house.

1017
01:07:33,193 --> 01:07:36,287
Tomorrow night, 8:00 sharp.

1018
01:07:39,866 --> 01:07:41,800
Don't bring your dog.

1019
01:07:46,172 --> 01:07:48,970
You really want
to kiss me, don't you?

1020
01:07:49,042 --> 01:07:51,169
- Boy, do l.
- Tell me how much.

1021
01:07:51,244 --> 01:07:54,077
- Tell me.
- [Paul] What's on?

1022
01:07:54,147 --> 01:07:56,081
Psycho's going on in ten minutes.

1023
01:07:56,149 --> 01:07:59,243
If you're about to say,
"That's the one where the guy
dresses up in his mother's clothes...

1024
01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:01,253
and kills people,"
don't bother.

1025
01:08:01,321 --> 01:08:03,812
I've already seen this one.
Alone.

1026
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:07,986
I was just wondering when you were
planning on speaking to me again.

1027
01:08:08,061 --> 01:08:10,655
I mean, about something
other than Psycho.

1028
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:14,029
It's almost been 24 hours
since we traded barbs.

1029
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,900
We don't want to get rusty, do we?

1030
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:22,601
I mean, just how much longer
do I have to wait...

1031
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:24,700
for my next dose of vitriol?

1032
01:08:24,778 --> 01:08:26,712
How long have you got?

1033
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:31,046
[Chuckles]
A good question.

1034
01:08:31,117 --> 01:08:35,110
[TV Audio, Low]

1035
01:08:35,188 --> 01:08:37,713
Oh, damn.

1036
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:41,283
On the first date
my husband asked me:

1037
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:45,457
"Gracie... do you dream?"

1038
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:49,293
And I said, "Yes."

1039
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:54,534
From the time I get up in the morning
until I go to bed at night.

1040
01:08:54,607 --> 01:08:58,065
You know how they say
the first time is never any good?

1041
01:08:59,712 --> 01:09:02,977
Well, with us, it was wonderful.

1042
01:09:06,886 --> 01:09:09,821
I never felt so awake.

1043
01:09:11,558 --> 01:09:16,154
I had to reassure him that crying
was just my standard reaction...

1044
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:18,663
to tremendous pleasure.

1045
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:25,337
He held me, and he said
that he wanted to make me cry...

1046
01:09:25,405 --> 01:09:28,670
for the rest of our lives.

1047
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:32,343
Flash forward 15 years...

1048
01:09:32,412 --> 01:09:37,679
and somehow the two of us
became one... and one.

1049
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,354
And now I find myself living with
a roommate instead of a husband.

1050
01:09:44,424 --> 01:09:46,517
And I have dogs instead of children...

1051
01:09:46,593 --> 01:09:50,029
because I can have dogs,
but I can't have children.

1052
01:09:50,096 --> 01:09:53,031
And--

1053
01:09:53,099 --> 01:09:57,229
Oh, I've forgotten
who blames who for that.

1054
01:10:01,274 --> 01:10:03,708
And I haven't cried
in a very long time.

1055
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:19,317
My breaking point
happened this afternoon...

1056
01:10:19,392 --> 01:10:22,793
when I picked up my kids
from day care.

1057
01:10:24,898 --> 01:10:26,832
With you...

1058
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,836
I was spontaneous for the first time
in my entire life.

1059
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:35,264
And I discovered
I'm not very good at spontaneity.

1060
01:10:37,577 --> 01:10:41,513
Is there something that you can see
your husband doing...

1061
01:10:41,581 --> 01:10:44,175
or saying that would
make a difference?

1062
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:47,845
Sometimes I think it could be as simple
as his asking me to go for a walk.

1063
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:49,855
Um...

1064
01:10:51,758 --> 01:10:55,023
anything, so long as it felt
like a start.

1065
01:10:55,094 --> 01:10:57,528
Maybe this was your start.

1066
01:10:57,597 --> 01:11:00,657
[Sighs, Whispers]
You're a fucking optimist.

1067
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:03,463
That's my job.

1068
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:18,977
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday, does it?

1069
01:11:19,052 --> 01:11:22,988
This doesn't change anything
about Saturday.

1070
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:29,193
[Joan] So, let me take a stab
at Keenan's story.

1071
01:11:30,396 --> 01:11:32,330
You had a great love.

1072
01:11:32,398 --> 01:11:34,332
The romance of your lifetime.

1073
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,631
Totally cosmic, out-of-this-world bond
with little Miss X...

1074
01:11:38,738 --> 01:11:40,672
and she left you.

1075
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:43,334
You're not far off.

1076
01:11:43,409 --> 01:11:45,536
People get over these things, Keenan.

1077
01:11:45,612 --> 01:11:48,274
Hell, I'm getting over these things...
all the time.

1078
01:11:48,348 --> 01:11:50,509
Well, it can only be once for me.

1079
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:53,450
You're sweet to believe things
so absolutely...

1080
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:56,010
but you're also full of shit.

1081
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:59,090
You can love again.

1082
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:03,094
I can't.
Any more than you--

1083
01:12:03,162 --> 01:12:05,687
- Any more than I can what?
- I don't know.

1084
01:12:05,765 --> 01:12:07,824
A-Any more than you
can stop drinking.

1085
01:12:16,209 --> 01:12:18,200
- Can I get you another one?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

1086
01:12:18,277 --> 01:12:21,508
- It was a gin martini, right?
- Vodka, but, really, I've had enough.

1087
01:12:21,581 --> 01:12:24,311
- [Waiter] I insist, please.
- Look, pal--

1088
01:12:24,384 --> 01:12:27,512
And I mean this affectionately,
all right? Scram.

1089
01:12:29,222 --> 01:12:31,986
Where were we?
Oh, yes, I've just given up alcohol...

1090
01:12:32,058 --> 01:12:34,526
and you're going to tell me
about the great love of your life.

1091
01:12:34,594 --> 01:12:38,325
- Her name was Sarah.
- And she was your first?

1092
01:12:38,398 --> 01:12:40,332
Yes.

1093
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,166
[Sighs] Look... it's natural
to elevate our first love...

1094
01:12:44,237 --> 01:12:47,331
to some sort of
mythic emotional plateau.

1095
01:12:47,407 --> 01:12:49,841
But you fell in love, she left you...

1096
01:12:49,909 --> 01:12:52,173
and now you're dealing with
love's most common byproduct:

1097
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:54,213
suicidal manic depression.

1098
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,077
Right?

1099
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:59,346
- Do you feel better?
- No.

1100
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:04,519
It-- It's hard to talk about.

1101
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,423
I have a friend,
a jazz musician, trumpet player.

1102
01:13:07,493 --> 01:13:10,519
Really terrific.
I go and hear him jam every month or so.

1103
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:13,793
He plays this piece I love:
an old Chet Baker song.

1104
01:13:13,866 --> 01:13:17,597
And he blows the same notes every time,
but every time it sounds different.

1105
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:21,970
And we had drinks one night--
when I used to drink--

1106
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:23,975
and I tried to tell him
how that song made me feel...

1107
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:27,809
how his playing made me feel,
how the music... made me feel.

1108
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,974
And he just kept shaking
his head and he said...

1109
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,984
"Joan, you can't talk about music.

1110
01:13:33,052 --> 01:13:36,317
Talking about music is like
dancing about architecture."

1111
01:13:37,223 --> 01:13:39,157
I said, "Well, okay, fine.

1112
01:13:39,225 --> 01:13:41,887
Gonna get all philosophical on me.
It's as pointless as talking
about a lot of things.

1113
01:13:41,961 --> 01:13:43,895
Love, for instance."

1114
01:13:43,963 --> 01:13:46,488
And my friend laughed,
and he said...

1115
01:13:46,566 --> 01:13:48,500
"Definitely. Most definitely.

1116
01:13:48,568 --> 01:13:51,765
Talking about love is like
dancing about architecture."

1117
01:13:51,838 --> 01:13:54,170
So, I don't know.
He might be right.

1118
01:13:55,575 --> 01:13:58,738
But it ain't gonna
stop me from trying.

1119
01:13:58,811 --> 01:14:00,870
[Laughs]

1120
01:14:00,947 --> 01:14:04,883
I wish you'd do that
more often: smile.

1121
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:07,511
So do l.

1122
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:14,117
So let me guess. You and Wonder Woman
were together a year?

1123
01:14:14,193 --> 01:14:16,787
A year and a half.

1124
01:14:16,863 --> 01:14:18,888
And you were faithful to her?

1125
01:14:18,965 --> 01:14:21,229
Completely.

1126
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,030
And you shared everything.

1127
01:14:30,176 --> 01:14:34,010
We-- We shared everything.

1128
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:37,474
That must be nice.

1129
01:14:38,885 --> 01:14:41,479
It was...

1130
01:14:41,554 --> 01:14:43,488
but...

1131
01:14:45,391 --> 01:14:50,158
in addition to sharing
all of those things...

1132
01:14:50,229 --> 01:14:54,325
it turns out I was also sharing her...

1133
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,028
with a variety of other people.

1134
01:14:58,404 --> 01:15:00,338
I hate to say this...

1135
01:15:00,406 --> 01:15:02,966
because l-l don't want
to diminish your feelings...

1136
01:15:03,042 --> 01:15:06,671
but, sadly, that happens every day.

1137
01:15:06,746 --> 01:15:09,271
Those other people shared needles.

1138
01:15:15,087 --> 01:15:17,112
% [Jazz Trumpet]

1139
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:20,785
[Sighs] She died last year.

1140
01:15:23,362 --> 01:15:27,458
But not before sharing...

1141
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:31,094
one final thing with me.

1142
01:16:19,352 --> 01:16:22,412
Can I buy you a drink, Valery?

1143
01:16:22,488 --> 01:16:25,218
- You seem to be so good at this.
- [Scoffs]

1144
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:28,454
Oh, I'm fine in scene class,
on stage.

1145
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:32,463
It's just this improvisational--
I can't do it.

1146
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:34,465
- Hmm.
- At least not like this.

1147
01:16:35,868 --> 01:16:38,928
Maybe I'm just better
at pretending I'm someone else.

1148
01:16:40,873 --> 01:16:44,809
Well, I gotta go. Um... I'll see you
in class tomorrow for the reports.

1149
01:16:44,877 --> 01:16:47,471
God knows what I'll say.

1150
01:16:47,546 --> 01:16:51,141
- I won't be there.
- Why?

1151
01:16:51,217 --> 01:16:55,278
I, uh-- I like this too much.

1152
01:16:55,354 --> 01:16:59,484
- I'm too good at it.
- I don't understand.

1153
01:16:59,558 --> 01:17:02,994
I'm better at all these lies
that I've manufactured...

1154
01:17:03,062 --> 01:17:05,656
than I am at the lies I'm living.

1155
01:17:09,068 --> 01:17:11,696
I have a wife.
Did you know that?

1156
01:17:14,307 --> 01:17:16,605
I don't think that
we like each other very much.

1157
01:17:18,711 --> 01:17:21,236
Is that something
to smile about?

1158
01:17:23,683 --> 01:17:26,777
Well, it's just that my wife--
She, um...

1159
01:17:26,852 --> 01:17:29,844
doesn't think that I have
much of an imagination.

[Trent] Ah, flowers.

1331
01:30:31,002 --> 01:30:33,835
How thoughtful.

1332
01:30:33,905 --> 01:30:36,999
Whoo. We like the same merlot.

1333
01:30:37,075 --> 01:30:40,010
It's actually the very same bottle
that you brought to my house.

1334
01:30:40,078 --> 01:30:42,569
[Laughs] Excellent.

1335
01:30:42,647 --> 01:30:44,672
Come on in.

1336
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,684
Wow.

1337
01:30:51,923 --> 01:30:55,518
- You're wondering where dinner is.
- Uh, I must say.

1338
01:30:55,594 --> 01:30:57,858
I have a little confession to make.

1339
01:30:57,929 --> 01:31:01,194
I invited you to dinner at my house,
but I can't cook.

All right.

1343
01:31:07,606 --> 01:31:09,870
Chinese food is my specialty.

What are we making?

1345
01:31:22,053 --> 01:31:24,146
Some hemlock.

1346
01:31:24,222 --> 01:31:26,747
Oh, please, don't deprive
the kids of their mother.

1347
01:31:26,825 --> 01:31:31,159
- Oh, I'm not making it for me.
- Ah, that's the Hannah that I know.

1348
01:31:31,229 --> 01:31:35,097
Well, you seem to know me
a lot better than I know you.

1349
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:37,499
You know that's not true.

1350
01:31:37,569 --> 01:31:42,871
Do you remember what you told
the kids about falling in love?

1351
01:31:44,242 --> 01:31:46,676
- No.
- Well, I do.

1352
01:31:46,745 --> 01:31:50,181
You said that the wonderful thing
about falling in love...

1353
01:31:50,248 --> 01:31:56,016
is that you learn everything
about that person, and so quickly.

1354
01:31:56,087 --> 01:31:58,021
And if it's true love...

1355
01:31:58,089 --> 01:32:01,525
then you start to see yourself
through their eyes...

1356
01:32:01,593 --> 01:32:03,527
and it brings out
the best in you...

1357
01:32:03,595 --> 01:32:08,032
and it's almost as if you're
falling in love with yourself.

1358
01:32:08,099 --> 01:32:11,364
- I said that?
- Mm-hmm.

1359
01:32:11,436 --> 01:32:15,736
Well, 25 years ago,
I needed to feel that again.

1360
01:32:15,807 --> 01:32:19,140
Feel that I was worth loving.

1361
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:21,645
Because somehow I knew...

1362
01:32:21,713 --> 01:32:26,047
that would be my last time
to have that particular feeling.

1363
01:32:27,886 --> 01:32:31,481
- You couldn't have it with me?
- Oh, I did have it with you...

1364
01:32:31,556 --> 01:32:33,649
but I'd forgotten it.

1365
01:32:33,725 --> 01:32:36,489
I hadn't forgotten
why I loved you...

1366
01:32:36,561 --> 01:32:39,394
but I'd forgotten
why you loved me.

1367
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:43,333
[Laughs]

1368
01:32:43,401 --> 01:32:46,165
And Wendy made me remember...

1369
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:49,833
that I was a pretty terrific fellow.

1370
01:32:49,908 --> 01:32:52,342
Bully for Wendy.

1371
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:56,346
But I knew that
I couldn't sleep with her.

1372
01:32:56,414 --> 01:32:58,041
Why?

1373
01:32:58,116 --> 01:33:02,280
Because I would have left you...
and the kids.

1374
01:33:12,931 --> 01:33:15,798
What are we thinking?

1375
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:18,461
Hot liquid and facial burns.

1376
01:33:18,536 --> 01:33:20,800
Oh.

1377
01:33:20,872 --> 01:33:25,969
Remember the day
Wendy left the company...

1378
01:33:26,044 --> 01:33:28,979
- and went to Seattle?
- Yes.

1379
01:33:29,047 --> 01:33:31,140
I thought for a while
you might go with her.

1380
01:33:31,216 --> 01:33:34,151
Me too, but I didn't.

1381
01:33:37,889 --> 01:33:40,483
When I came home that day...

1382
01:33:40,558 --> 01:33:44,654
I realized that I was
more in love with you...

1383
01:33:44,729 --> 01:33:46,993
than ever before.

1384
01:33:48,733 --> 01:33:52,169
How did that thunderbolt strike you?

1385
01:33:52,237 --> 01:33:55,331
Because I'd made a choice.

1386
01:33:56,574 --> 01:34:00,010
I took one look at you...

1387
01:34:00,078 --> 01:34:04,674
and I knew I'd made
the right choice.

1388
01:34:04,749 --> 01:34:07,013
I know that sounds daft...

1389
01:34:07,085 --> 01:34:10,851
but my love for somebody else...

1390
01:34:10,922 --> 01:34:13,789
made me love you more...

1391
01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:18,124
because I sought...

1392
01:34:18,196 --> 01:34:20,130
to reclaim myself.

1393
01:34:21,866 --> 01:34:24,130
And, Hannah...

1394
01:34:24,202 --> 01:34:27,137
you're still the right choice.

1395
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:33,143
We made a child that day.

1396
