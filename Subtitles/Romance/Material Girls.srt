-Thanks.

178

There's no new product.
The truth is, without Victor Marchetta,

179
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,130
there is no Marchetta Cosmetics.

180

you're going to inherit

Yeah, sure. Yes, yes, of course.
Of course I am,

But there is another option.

tomorrow where I expect them,

and still have a unit for each of you.

It was lower than we hoped for,
but in light of present circumstances...

Sixty cents on the dollar
for all our private stock.

1000
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:26,317
but all that's about to change.
I want your company.

1001
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:29,118
I want you to make the deal.

You want to be a chemist? Be my chemist.

1004

You want to travel?

1005

The ancient ruins of Pompeii.

The bronzed island boys
of Mustique await you.

Do it on my dime.

1008
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:50,110
I want you girls
to be the face of my new line.

1009
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:52,507
A line we create together.

1010
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:56,678
But our reputations
have been completely ruined.

1011
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:59,014
Oh, I'll clear his name.

1012
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:02,092
I'll make your father a hero again.

1013

Listen up.

1014
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:08,924
My father, Morris Farbrinsky,
pulled himself up by his bootstraps

1015
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:11,900
to become mattress king of Atlantic City.

1016
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,027
Everybody called him a crook.

1017
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:16,766
But his memory means everything to me.

1018
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:20,266
-I know what you're going through.
-Thank you.

1019
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:24,072
Oh, Tran, Bob. Hurrah.

1020
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,877
Why don't you give the girls foot rubs?

1021
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:38,661
Tran? Better yet,
why don't you massage Ava's temples?

1022
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:52,069
Remember, girls. I can give you
everything you ever wanted.

-Ava!
-What?

1026
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:00,943
I cannot believe you.

1027
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,315
I mean, one temple rub and you...

1028
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,444
Wait.

1029
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:07,353
How psychic was she
about how much you liked those?

1030
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,392
So she did her homework.

1031
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:13,191
But that doesn't just mean
we're gonna give up and sell, right?

1032

JK.

1033
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:17,796
Well, you're gonna help me
go through these lists, right?

1034
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,631
Yes. But if Dad did it, we sell.

1035
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,296
And if he didn't, we fight!

1036

Okay.

153 people had adverse reactions.

-So I divided up all the phone numbers.
-Okay.

1039
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:34,842

1046

about our Everdew Night Cream.

-Tanzie, wake up. 92 through 103.

Okay, great. Thank you.

-That was the last one.

she had nothing but a rash.

-It's the carniceria,

-Yeah? They weren't back then.

wouldn't have given me the time of day.

I don't know about beautiful.

I gained two pounds since I've been poor.

1159
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:36,891
I used to make fun of regular people
with their eye bags

1160
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,369
and their love handles,
but worrying about money is really tiring.

1161

Preparation H for that.
