1
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,630
This is the story of a man,
marked by an image from his childhood.

2
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:41,130
The violent scene that upsets him,
and whose meaning he was to grasp only years later,

3
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,810
happened on the main jetty at Orly,
the Paris airport,

4
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,740
sometime before the outbreak of World War III.

5
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,620
Orly, Sunday. Parents used to take their children there
to watch the departing planes.

6
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,120
On this particular Sunday,
the child whose story we are telling

7
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,420
was bound to remember the frozen sun,
the setting at the end of the jetty,

8
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,130
and a woman's face.

9
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,970
Nothing sorts out memories
from ordinary moments.

10
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,500
Later on they do claim remembrance
when they show their scars.

11
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,070
That face he had seen was
to be the only peacetime image to survive the war.

12
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,330
Had he really seen it?

13
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,480
Or had he invented that tender moment
to prop up the madness to come?

14
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,370
The sudden roar,
the woman's gesture,

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,890
the crumpling body, and the cries of the crowd
on the jetty blurred by fear.

16
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,680
Later, he knew he had seen a man die.

17
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,210
And sometime after came the destruction of Paris.

18
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,370
Many died.

19
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,280
Some believed themselves to be victors.

20
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,840
Others were taken prisoner.

21
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,310
The survivors settled beneath Chaillot,
in an underground network of galleries.

22
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,550
Above ground, Paris,
as most of the world,

23
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,430
was uninhabitable,
riddled with radioactivity.

24
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,160
The victors stood guard
over an empire of rats.

25
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,080
The prisoners were subjected to experiments,

26
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,680
apparently of great concern
to those who conducted them.

27
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,990
The outcome was a disappointment for some
- death for others -

28
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,070
and for others yet, madness.

29
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,120
One day they came to select
a new guinea pig from among the prisoners.

30
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,620
He was the man whose story we are telling.

31
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,030
He was frightened.

32
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,390
He had heard about the Head Experimenter.

33
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,110
He was prepared to meet
Dr. Frankenstein, or the Mad Scientist.

34
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,070
Instead, he met a reasonable man
who explained calmly

35
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,290
that the human race was doomed.

36
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,880
Space was off-limits.

37
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,780
The only hope for survival lay in Time.

38
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,680
A loophole in Time,
and then maybe it would be possible to reach food,

39
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,190
medicine, sources of energy.

40
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,440
This was the aim of the experiments:
to send emissaries into Time,

41
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,440
to summon the Past
and Future to the aid of the Present.

42
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,000
But the human mind balked at the idea.

43
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,930
To wake up in another age
meant to be born again as an adult.

44
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,270
The shock would be too great.

45
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,600
Having only sent lifeless or insentient bodies
through different zones of Time,

46
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,970
the inventors where now concentrating on men
given to very strong mental images.

47
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,870
If they were able to conceive
or dream another time,

48
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,200
perhaps they would be able to live in it.

49
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,120
The camp police spied even on dreams.

50
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,830
This man was selected
from among a thousand for his obsession

51
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,220
with an image from the past.

52
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,590
Nothing else, at first,
put stripping out the present, and its racks.

53
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,950
They begin again.

54
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,990
The man doesn't die, nor does he go mad.

55
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,700
He suffers.

56
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,400
They continue.

57
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,090
On the tenth day,
images begin to ooze, like confessions.

58
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,620
A peacetime morning.

59
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,620
A peacetime bedroom. 

60
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,820
A real bedroom.

61
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,880
Real children.

62
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,390
Real birds.

63
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,620
Real cats.

64
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,390
Real graves.

65
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,320
On the sixteenth day
he is on the jetty at Orly.

66
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,570
Empty.

67
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,970
Sometimes he recaptures a day of happiness,
though different.

68
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,180
A face of happiness, though different.

69
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,080
Ruins.

70
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,050
A girl who could be the one he seeks.

71
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,720
He passes her on the jetty.

72
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,860
She smiles at him from an automobile.

73
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,550
Other images appear, merge,

74
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,930
in that museum,

75
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,410
which is perhaps that of his memory.

76
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,980
On the thirtieth day,
the meeting takes place.

77
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,060
Now he is sure he recognizes her.

78
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,900
In fact, it is the only thing he is sure of,

79
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,060
in the middle of this dateless world
that at first stuns him with its affluence.

80
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,140
Around him, only fabulous materials:
glass, plastic, terry cloth.

81
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,990
When he recovers from his trance,
the woman has gone.

82
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,210
The experimenters tighten their control.

83
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,070
They send him back out on the trail.

84
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,500
Time rolls back again,
the moment returns.

85
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,720
This time he is close to her,
he speaks to her.

86
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,180
She welcomes him without surprise.

87
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,140
They are without memories,
without plans.

88
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,810
Time builds itself painlessly around them.

89
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,100
Their only landmarks
are the flavor of the moment they are living

90
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,580
and the markings on the walls.

91
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,660
Later on, they are in a garden.

92
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,680
He remembers there were gardens.

93
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,020
She asks him about his necklace,

94
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,740
the combat necklace he wore at the start of the war
that is yet to come.

95
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,300
He invents an explanation.

96
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,790
They look at the trunk of a redwood tree
covered with historical dates.

97
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,240
She pronounces an English name
he doesn't understand.

98
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,410
As in a dream, he shows her a point beyond the tree,
hears himself say,

99
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,590
"This is where I come from ..."

100
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,800
and falls back, exhausted.

101
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,570
Then another wave of Time washes over him.

102
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,900
The result of another injection perhaps.

103
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,540
Now she is asleep in the sun.

104
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,670
He knows that in this world
to which he has just returned for a while,

105
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,680
only to be sent back to her, she is dead.

106
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,440
She wakes up.

107
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,260
He speaks again.

108
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,850
Of a truth too fantastic
to be believed he retains the essential:

109
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,860
an unreachable country, a long way to go.

110
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,700
She listens.
She doesn't laugh.

111
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,090
Is it the same day?
He doesn't know.

112
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,520
They shall go on like this,
on countless walks in which an unspoken trust,

113
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,950
an unadulterated trust will grow between them,
without memories or plans.

114
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,400
Up to the moment where he feels
- ahead of them - a barrier.

115
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,140
And this was the end of the first experiment.

116
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,670
It was the starting point for a whole series of tests,

117
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,850
in which he would meet her at different times.

118
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,130
Sometimes he finds her in front of their markings.

119
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,260
She welcomes him in a simple way.

120
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,660
She calls him her Ghost.

121
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,800
One day she seems frightened.

122
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,120
One day she leans toward him.

123
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,660
As for him, he never knows
whether he moves toward her,

124
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,630
whether he is driven,

125
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,090
whether he has made it up,

126
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,320
or whether he is only dreaming.

127
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:59,000
Around the fiftieth day,
they meet in a museum filled with timeless animals.

128
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,400
Now the aim is perfectly adjusted.

129
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,040
Thrown at the right moment,
he may stay there and move without effort.

130
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,270
She too seems tamed.

131
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,060
She accepts as a natural phenomenon
the ways of this visitor who comes and goes,

132
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,500
who exists, talks, laughs with her, stops talking,

133
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,810
listens to her, then disappears.

134
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,280
Once back in the experiment room,
he knew something was different.

135
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,310
The camp leader was there.

136
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,860
From the conversation around him,

137
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,000
he gathered that after the brilliant
results of the tests in the Past,

138
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,530
they now meant to ship him into the Future.

139
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,490
His excitement made him forget for a moment
that the meeting at the museum

140
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,260
had been the last.

141
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,000
The Future was better protected than the Past.

142
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,270
After more, painful tries,

143
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,950
he eventually caught some waves
of the world to come.

144
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,950
He went through a brand new planet,

145
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,090
Paris rebuilt,
ten thousand incomprehensible avenues.

146
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,020
Others were waiting for him.

147
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,660
It was a brief encounter.

148
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,750
Obviously, they rejected
these scoriae of another time.

149
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,280
He recited his lesson:
because humanity had survived,

150
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,900
it could not refuse to
its own past the means of its survival.

151
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This sophism was taken for Fate in disguise.

152
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,000
They gave him a power unit strong enough

153
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,800
to put all human industry back into motion,

154
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,170
and again the gates of the Future were closed.

155
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,740
Sometime after his return,

156
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,400
he was transferred
to another part of the camp.

157
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,120
He knew that his jailers would not spare him.

158
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,120
He had been a tool in their hands,

159
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,000
his childhood image had been used
as bait to condition him,

160
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,390
he had lived up to their expectations,
he had played his part.

161
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,870
Now he only waited to be liquidated with,
somewhere inside him,

162
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,180
the memory of a twice-lived fragment of time.

163
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And deep in this limbo,

164
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,300
he received a message
from the people of the world to come.

165
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,600
They too travelled through Time,
and more easily.

166
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,000
Now they were there,
ready to accept him as one of their own.

167
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,000
But he had a different request:
rather than this pacified future,

168
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,600
he wanted to be returned
to the world of his childhood,

169
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,440
and to this woman
who was perhaps waiting for him.

170
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,030
Once again the main jetty at Orly,

171
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,000
in the middle of this warm pre-war Sunday afternoon
where he could not stay,

172
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,280
he though in a confused way

173
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,150
that the child he had been was due to be there too,

174
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,410
watching the planes.

175
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,290
But first of all he looked for the woman's face

176
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,540
at the end of the jetty.

177
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,400
He ran toward her.

178
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,500
And when he recognized the man
who had trailed him since the underground camp,

179
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,900
he understood
there was no way to escape Time,

180
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,520
and that this moment
he had been granted to watch as a child,

181
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,230
which had never ceased to obsess him,

182
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,120
was the moment of his own death.
