I think so. I don't know.

862
01:24:59,885 --> 01:25:03,377
Don't scratch yourself around here. You're gonna get an infection.

863
01:25:15,293 --> 01:25:17,784
-I wanna tell you something. -I don't wanna hear it.

864
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:19,887
Hey, this is hard for me.

865
01:25:19,963 --> 01:25:23,455
When we get to El Paso, I think I should take off.

866
01:25:31,936 --> 01:25:34,336
Hey, listen to me.

867
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:41,442
I want you to stick with me.

868
01:25:46,044 --> 01:25:48,444
No more about Benyon.

869
01:25:50,547 --> 01:25:53,948
You and me. What do you say?

870
01:26:00,753 --> 01:26:04,655
[Sighing] Can't get much worse than this, Doc.

871
01:26:04,755 --> 01:26:07,553
I don't see how it could.

872
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,424
Got us a car.

873
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:18,625
Got a couple of tires. We're in business.

874
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:26,267
Yep.

875
01:26:26,334 --> 01:26:30,065
Hey, we get to Mexico, we're gonna have a new life. Right?

876
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:32,365
That's all I want.

877
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:51,941
[Dialing Touch Tone Phone]

878
01:26:51,983 --> 01:26:55,385
-[Telephone Rings] -Yeah, Tom here.

879
01:26:55,385 --> 01:26:58,650
Tell Jim Deer Rudy and some girl just drove up.

880
01:26:58,987 --> 01:27:02,286
Looks like they're headin' into the hotel.

881
01:27:05,591 --> 01:27:07,491
[Meows]

882
01:27:07,592 --> 01:27:11,084
[Man] Howdy, folks. Welcome to the rustic Border Hotel.

883
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:15,896
-You must be Gollie. -[Laughing] By golly, I am Gollie.

884
01:27:15,896 --> 01:27:19,161
This here's my wife Carmen. I call her Tootsie.

885
01:27:19,465 --> 01:27:21,899
That's our three-year-old daughter. Her name's Anna.

886
01:27:21,967 --> 01:27:24,902
That's my son Jim. He's 17, and he's my jackrabbit.

887
01:27:24,969 --> 01:27:26,970
-We need a room for three. -Three?

888
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:29,495
-[Kitty Meows] -Oh, you got a cat. No problem.

889
01:27:29,905 --> 01:27:32,203
You need a room, you come to the right place.

890
01:27:32,306 --> 01:27:34,570
We got lots of rooms. Room 309.

891
01:27:34,608 --> 01:27:37,600
Hot out there, ain't it? It must be 114 degrees.

892
01:27:37,709 --> 01:27:40,576
Y'all come in for the races, I'll bet.

893
01:27:40,611 --> 01:27:43,307
Y-Y'all watch your step. Watch your step please, ma'am.

894
01:27:43,413 --> 01:27:46,314
A horse'll run a good second faster out there...

895
01:27:46,415 --> 01:27:48,315
than any other track in the country.

896
01:27:48,416 --> 01:27:50,111
It's just somethin'.

897
01:27:50,183 --> 01:27:52,818
Now, if one thing does hold true to form, it's the speed horse.

898
01:27:52,818 --> 01:27:56,879
A speed horse, he's runnin' just as hard as he can for as long as he can.

899
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,580
What they try to do is to rate those things. That's a whole 'nother story.

900
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:04,217
This here... This here's your livin' room.

901
01:28:04,325 --> 01:28:09,126
Bathroom, shower, toilet, bedroom, bed.

902
01:28:09,227 --> 01:28:11,627
Over in the top drawer you got the Gideon Bible.

903
01:28:11,696 --> 01:28:13,527
Right out here you got a veranda.

904
01:28:13,597 --> 01:28:15,531
Oh, it's just a beautiful sunset there, lady.

905
01:28:15,598 --> 01:28:18,226
Now... here you go.

906
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:22,326
-What's in there? -That'd be your closet there. It's...

907
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:26,132
Oh! God! What're ya... Oh!

908
01:28:26,237 --> 01:28:29,138
Open up your mouth. Say "Ahhh."

909
01:28:29,205 --> 01:28:31,435
Ahhh! Ahhh! [Groans]

910
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:34,805
You got two choices here, pal: You can live or you can die.

911
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:37,037
-What's it gonna be? -I don't wanna die.

912
01:28:37,143 --> 01:28:40,044
You do the right thing, you might even make a little bit of money.

913
01:28:40,145 --> 01:28:41,806
Huh?

914
01:29:00,123 --> 01:29:03,286
I'll tell you what. I'll go check us into the hotel.

915
01:29:03,392 --> 01:29:06,589
You go find someplace around here and get us some new clothes.

916
01:29:07,794 --> 01:29:11,355
Here you go, Doc. Passport.

917

[Chuckles] Credit card, driver's license.

918
01:29:15,299 --> 01:29:18,097
All cherry stuff. Never been reported.

919
01:29:18,201 --> 01:29:20,396
That stuff's so good, you can go anywhere you want to,

920
01:29:20,469 --> 01:29:23,004
no matter how hot you may be.

921
01:29:23,004 --> 01:29:25,996
Here's the key to your room, 234.

922
01:29:26,305 --> 01:29:29,974
Nobody else on that floor but you. All you gotta do is lay low a while.

923
01:29:29,974 --> 01:29:32,909
Then we'll get you on out of here, okay?

924
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:35,805
Carol went to get us some fresh clothes.

925
01:29:35,877 --> 01:29:38,573
We're both hungry. Send up some food as soon as you can.

926
01:29:38,612 --> 01:29:41,012
-How about some sandwiches? -That'll be fine.

927
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,015
It's gonna be an hour, maybe more.

928
01:29:43,015 --> 01:29:46,507
When my wife comes back, have that kid take care of anything she might need.

929
01:29:46,884 --> 01:29:49,114
-I gave him the day off. -Then you do it.

930
01:29:49,219 --> 01:29:54,623
I can't. I-I've gotta watch the front desk. You know how it goes.

931
01:29:58,724 --> 01:30:03,093
Doc, look, I'll work on the food, okay? Doc!

932
01:30:03,127 --> 01:30:05,118
This ain't the Hilton.

933
01:30:25,639 --> 01:30:28,233
-Can I come in? -Sure.

01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:14,002

936
01:32:14,068 --> 01:32:17,799
and I'll kill your little kitty too. [Chuckles]

01:32:52,324 --> 01:32:54,349
Hang it up.

01:33:03,464 --> 01:33:06,433
-Good flight, Jim? -They still in there?

950
01:33:06,465 --> 01:33:10,629
Yeah, both of 'em. McCoy and his wife showed up a little while ago.

951
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,966
Mm-hmm. That's nice.

952
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:16,870
Fire up the grill, boys. It's barbecue time.

Get dressed. We're leavin' right now.

It's Gollie.

959
01:33:58,096 --> 01:34:01,190
Somethin' bothering me about him.

960
01:34:01,264 --> 01:34:03,562
He's always got his family around.

961
01:34:03,598 --> 01:34:06,066
That wife and kid of his always stick close...

962
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:09,365
to make sure he stays away from the horses and the booze.

963

So what?

964
01:34:11,503 --> 01:34:14,165
If they're not here, then there's somethin' wrong.

965
01:34:14,205 --> 01:34:16,173
Maybe they took the day off.

What's the plan?

967
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:25,606
