00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:57,203
Get back to work.

00:03:57,663 --> 00:04:00,281
No. I've been here

4
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,783
I'm not scrubbing
one more corpse

5
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:04,352
until you tell me
why I'm oing it.

6
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:06,287
You will know why.

7
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:10,592

8
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,093

00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:21,302
You trie alreay.

13
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:22,770
I in't even know

Who are you?

15
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,874
No one.

16
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,394
Get back to work.

17
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:30,895

Was that true or a lie?

33
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:35,093

40
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,807
<i>Westeros.</i>

00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,930
My family home is Winterfell.

42
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:31,566
I'm the youngest aughter
of a great lor,

43
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
Ear Stark.

44

He ie in battle.

45
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,105
A lie.

46
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:40,208
After he was execute,
I fle the capital.

47
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,444
Ha to kill a stable boy.

48
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:45,279
rove my swor through his back.

49
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,416
A lie.

50
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,368
I stabbe him in the gut.

51
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:52,937
<i>I trie to fin</i>
<i>my mother an brother,</i>

52

<i>They were murere</i>

An outlaw kinappe me,

55
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:06,134
A man calle the Houn.
Sanor Clegane.

56
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:08,269
He trie to sell me,
but was woune in a fight.

57
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,304
He begge me to kill him,
but I wouln't.

58
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,440
I left him
in the mountains to ie.

I wante him to suffer.
I hate him.

60
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,529
I hate him.

61
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,984
That's not a lie!

62
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:25,987
A girl lies to me,

63
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,490
to the Many-Face Go,
to herself.

64
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,676
oes she truly
want to be no one?

65
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,911
Yes.

66
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,919
I'm not playing
this stupi game anymore!

67
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,138
We never stop playing.

68
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:10,031
So, those villages
we were suppose to fin?

69
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:11,916
We can't live on
berries an roots.

70
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,669
I can.

71
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,504
You're not hungry?

72
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,790
Of course I'm hungry.

73
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,375
You're an awful travelling
companion, o you know that?

74
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,628
Possibly the least
charming man I've ever met.

75
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,313
I'm not your travelling
companion.

76
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:28,633
We are travelling together in
each other's company, therefore...

77
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,551
o you ever shut up?

78
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:33,721
I saile from King's Laning
to Pentos in a crate

79
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:36,224
<i>without ever saying a wor.</i>

80
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:37,975
Why?

81
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,065
It never occurre to you
to ask why until now?

82
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,369
You never wonere
why Tyrion Lannister

83
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,072
ecie to visit
a brothel in Volantis?

84
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:54,075
I'm sure you visite many
brothels in many cities.

85
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:57,912
I kille my father.

86
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:03,801
He wante to execute me
for a crime I in't commit.

87
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,673
An he was fucking
the woman I love.

88
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:20,868
As miserable
as you are, Mormont,

89
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:22,436
at least your father
was a goo man.

90
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:24,272
What o you know
about my father?

91
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:27,859
I met him.
I visite the Wall.

92
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,828
When I aske him about his men,

93
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,104
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

94
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:36,701
He actually care about the
people uner his comman.

95
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,121
How o they put it in the Watch?

96
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,924
"We shall never see
his like again."

97
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,103
Oh, you in't know.

98
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,478
I'm sorry.
I am.

99
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,316
How?

100
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,652
I only know what I hear.

101
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:12,870
How?

102
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:15,489
<i>He was leaing an
expeition beyon the Wall.</i>

103
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,076
There was a mutiny.

104
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:21,395
He was murere by his own men.

105
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,259
We better keep moving.

106
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,277
Valar morghulis.

107
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:28,412
Valar ohaeris.

108
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:32,149
I have nowhere else to go.

109
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:35,853
I've taken her to every
healer in Braavos.

110
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:38,889
I've spent every penny I ha.

111
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:47,031
She suffers every ay
of her life.

112
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:50,051
I just want it to en.

113
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,613
It hurts.

114
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:22,033
I know.

115
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:26,620
on't be afrai.

116
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:30,074
I use to be like you.

117
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:32,243
I was sick.

118
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:35,513
I was ying.

119
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:42,053
But my father
never gave up on me.

120
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,258
He love me

121
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,893
more than anything in the worl,

122
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:51,679
just like your father loves you.

123
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:54,965
So he brought me here.

124
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,651
My father praye
to the Many-Face Go.

125
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:01,989
An I rank the water
from his fountain.

126
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,059
It heale me.

127
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,257
I've evote my life to him now.

128
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:23,938
You on't want to hurt anymore?

129
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:27,731
rink.

130
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:14,014
<i>Is a girl reay?</i>

131
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,569
To give up her ears,
her nose, her tongue?

132
00:16:20,155 --> 00:16:23,023
<i>Her hopes an reams,</i>
<i>her loves an hates?</i>

133
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:25,859
All that makes a girl
who she is?

134
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,163
Forever?

135
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,702
No.

136
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:37,871
A girl is not reay
to become no one.

137
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:46,030
But she is reay
to become someone else.

138
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,363
Why aenerys? Why is
she worth all this?

139
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,201
As I recall, the Mormonts
fought against the Targaryens

140
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,119
uring Robert's Rebellion.

141
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,288
o you believe in anything?

142
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,990
I believe in lots of things.

143
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,958
In something greater
than ourselves, I mean.

144
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,077
The gos, estiny.

145
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:20,331
o you believe there's
a plan for this worl?

146
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,833
No.

147
00:17:22,884 --> 00:17:24,134
Neither i I.

148
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,553
I was a cynic just like you.

149
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,723
Then I saw a girl
step into a great fire

150
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,642
with three stone eggs.

151
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,478
When the fire burne out, I thought
I' fin her blackene bones.

152
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:38,599
Instea, I saw her, aenerys,

153
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,653
alive an unhurt,
holing her baby ragons.

154
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:47,775
Have you ever hear
baby ragons singing?

155
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:49,526
No.

156
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:52,029
It's har to be
a cynic after that.

157
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,200
oesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

158
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:58,118
<i>No, it oesn't.</i>

159
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,454
The Targaryens
are famously insane.

160
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:03,374
What if she conquers the worl?
Then what?

161
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:05,676
1,000 years of peace
an prosperity?

162
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,711
First we have
to conquer the worl.

163
00:18:07,762 --> 00:18:09,630
We?

164
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:11,849
All right, let's assume
your reams come true.

165
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:15,219
<i>She's ecstatic when you</i>
<i>bring her this enemy warf.</i>

166
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,439
<i>She hacks off my hea</i>
<i>an restores your position.</i>

167
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,774
You comman her army,
sail to Westeros,

168
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,727
efeat all your enemies an
watch her climb those steps

169
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:25,229
an sit on the Iron Throne.

170
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,531
Hurrah. Long live the queen.
Then what?

171
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,149
Then she rules.

172
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,369
So a woman who has not spent a
single ay of her ault life

173
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:35,122
in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

174
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,708
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

175
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,578
Because her father, who burne living
men for amusement, was the king?

176
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:47,251
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchore?

177
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:49,086
They probably
came ashore for...

178
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:51,588
<i>Water.</i>

179
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,935
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

180
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,245
Salt mines?

181
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,582
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

182
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,501
<i>He looks strong enough.</i>

183
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:23,337
What about the warf?

184
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,672
Worthless.

185
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,292
Cut his throat.

186
00:19:28,343 --> 00:19:30,344
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Let's iscuss this.

187
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,796
An then chop off his cock.

188
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,047
We'll sell it for a fortune.

189
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:36,216
A warf's cock has magic powers.

190
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:38,635
Wait! Wait!

191
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,053
Wait, wait, wait!

192
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,689
You can't just han
a ry cock to a merchant

193
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,224
an expect him to pay for it.

194
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,226
He has to know
it came from a warf.

195
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:49,580
An how coul he know
unless he sees the warf?

196
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:51,365
It will be
a warf-size cock.

197
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,400
Guess again.

198
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,325
The warf lives until we
fin a cock merchant.

199
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,503
Queen aenerys
has outlawe slavery.

200
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:15,589
We're boun for Volantis,
not Slaver's Bay.

201
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:19,309
Besies, she reopene
the fighting pits.

202
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,012
I've never hear of free men
fighting in the pits.

203
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:24,264
<i>The fighting pits in Meereen?</i>

204
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,267
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

205
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,238
You are looking at one of the great
warriors in the Seven Kingoms.

206
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,525
Him.

207
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:38,495
Him? He's got to
be 60 years ol.

208
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,248
Sure, he's a bit
long in the tooth,

209
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,084
a bit withere,
been in the sun too long.

210
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,588
We can all see that. But he
is a veteran of 100 battles.

211
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,923
They wrote songs about him.

212
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:57,848
That true?

213
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,023
He won the tournament
at Lannisport.

214
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:08,692
Unseating Ser Jaime
Lannister himself.

215
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:12,980
The Kingslayer.

216
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:16,400
Jousting. You're talking
about jousting.

217
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,785
A fancy game for fancy las.

218
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,572
The men who fight in the pits of
Meereen will swallow him whole.

219
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:24,663
I kille a othraki
bloorier in single combat.

220
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,587
Liar.

221
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:39,306
It's no lie.
His name was Qotho.

222
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,225
He was bloorier to Khal rogo.

223
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,229
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a swor in my han,

224
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,898
I'll prove my worth.

225
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,829
For my chilren.
Money.

226
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,502
Lor Baelish.

227
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,671
Yes?

228
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:14,041
Lancel Lannister.

229
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,178
Brother Lancel.

230
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,796
We abanon our family names.

231
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:21,632
Quite a family to abanon.

232
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:24,851
The city has change
since you were here last.

233
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,770
We flooe the gutters
with wine,

234
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,272
smashe the false iols,

235
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,808
an set the goless on the run.

236
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,360
Well one.

237
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,035
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

238
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,038
Shoul I sen wor
that I'll be elaye?

239
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:50,460
Step carefully, Lor Baelish.

240
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,913
You'll fin there's little
tolerance for flesh pelers

241
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:54,498
in the new King's Laning.

242
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:57,384
We both pele fantasies,
Brother Lancel.

243
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,920
Mine just happen
to be entertaining.

244
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,566
o you think it's wise,
Your Grace,

245
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,401
arresting the heir
to Highgaren?

246
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,270
The Faith arreste
the heir to Highgaren.

247
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:20,433
Of course, an the Faith
were arme on your orers.

248
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,242
The king's orers.

249
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,361
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras's perversion?

250
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,313
House Tyrell won't
tolerate this insult.

251
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:29,449
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

252
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,451
I'm the insulte party,
Lor Baelish.

253
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:33,320
Ser Loras was promise to me.

254
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:35,338
Instea he chose
the company of boys.

255
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,693
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

256
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:41,962
Most curious.

257
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,299
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

258
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,335
Thoroughly repellant woman.

259
00:23:49,737 --> 00:23:51,688
Forgive me.

260
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,690
I know you're still in mourning.

261
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:57,110
Lysa was a goo woman.

262
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,445
A kin woman.

263
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,448
<i>She was neither of those things.
We both know it.</i>

264
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,483
Still, I pity her son.

265
00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:05,786
How fortunate the young
Lor of the Vale

266
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,121
<i>has a new father to counsel him.</i>

267
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,157
I know how har it can be

268
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,993
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

269
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:15,995
If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights
of the Vale fight for their king?

270
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,416
Young Lor Robin
hees my avice.

271
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:23,370
An I have always counsele
loyalty to the throne.

272
00:24:23,404 --> 00:24:25,205
Goo.

273
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,394
If there's nothing else.

274
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,347
There is another matter,
Your Grace.

275
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:37,100
Something so urgent I couln't
trust the wors to a raven.

276
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:40,036
You once charge me
with fining Arya Stark.

277
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:42,989
To my shame, I faile you.

278
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,325
But I have foun Sansa Stark.

279
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:50,247
Alive an well an home again

280
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,748
living at Winterfell.

281
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,034
That's not possible.

282
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:56,419
My sources are well place.

283
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:59,623
They tell me Roose Bolton

284
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:02,125
plans to marry her
to his son Ramsay,

285
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:04,845
a bastar recently
legitimize by King Tommen.

286
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,849
Roose Bolton is Waren of the
North by the grace of my father.

287
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,853
Inee, his rewar for stabbing
his own king in the heart.

288
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,273
We were fools
to trust a turncloak.

289
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,725
Marrying his son
to the last of the Starks

290
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,644
gives him more legitimacy
in the North

291
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:22,612
than an alliance with
a hate southern house.

292
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:26,032
I will skin him an his bastar

293
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,901
like that wretch
on their blooy sigil.

294
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,736
I woul counsel
patience, Your Grace.

295
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,621
Patience?

296
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,206
Sansa helpe murer my son.

297
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,791
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

298
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,793
Stannis Baratheon
is also a traitor,

299
00:25:36,878 --> 00:25:38,445
marching with his army
on Winterfell.

300
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:40,964
Let Stannis an Roose battle.

301
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,633
Let the enemies of the
throne slaughter each other.

302
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:47,037
An when they're one, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

303
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:49,556
Winterfell is 1,000 miles
away from here.

304
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,758
The weather has alreay
begun to turn.

305
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,694
That is why it is critical
to strike soon

306
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:57,147
while the victor
still licks his wouns.

307
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,234
Surely your Uncle Kevan
coul muster a force.

308
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:04,604
My Uncle Kevan has all the
courage of a kitchen mouse.

309
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:06,223
Ser Jaime, then.

310
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:08,859
<i>Jaime's away on a sensitive
iplomatic mission.</i>

311
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:11,611
I have no iea
when he'll be back.

312
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:14,114
<i>Perhaps I can help.</i>

313
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:17,284
The Knights of the Vale are some
of the best fighters in Westeros,

314
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:19,553
traine to battle
in the ice an the snow.

315
00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:22,455
Forgive me, Lor Baelish,

316
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:24,708
you have a reputation
as a moneylener

317
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:27,294
an a brothel keeper,
not a military man.

318
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:29,479
You wouln't risk
a single Lannister solier

319
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:32,933
or a single coin
from the royal treasury.

320
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,684
What o you have to lose?

321
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,586
A brothel keeper?

322
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:38,138
An if you succee?

323
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,307
Name me Waren of the North.

324
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:48,198
I'll speak to the king
this evening,

325
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,400
have him issue a royal ecree.

326
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:53,286
I'll not rest until the
lion flies over Winterfell.

327
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,605
An I'll know
you're a man of your wor

328
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,658
when I see Sansa Stark's
hea on a spike.

329
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,794
As I sai...

330
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,779
I live to serve.

331
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,421
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

332
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,724
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

333
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,177
We've waite long enough.

334
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:19,429
I want you to be my wife.

335
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,514
Now.

336
00:27:22,817 --> 00:27:24,434
What is it?

337
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:27,404
o you want to marry me because
our families arrange it?

338
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,322
Or o you...

339
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:39,366
We can't.
Not yet.

340
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:40,583
Why not?

341
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,669
You know why not.
Someone will see.

342
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,038
You are going to be my wife.

343
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:49,125
I am going to be your husban.

344
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:52,712
We're allowe to walk through
the garens together.

345
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:55,382
How many other girls have you
walke through these garens?

346
00:27:57,351 --> 00:28:00,020
I like the way your eyes go
squinty when you're jealous.

347
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:03,606
They o not go squinty an you
in't answer the question.

348
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,076
They make a lovely couple.

349
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,279
A Lannister an a Martell.

350
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,732
<i>They have no iea</i>
<i>how angerous that is.</i>

351
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,968
We must protect them.

352
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:16,970
Yes, my prince.

353
00:28:18,606 --> 00:28:21,708
You haven't ha to use that
axe of yours in a long time.

354
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,045
I hope you remember how.

355
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,747
I remember how.

356
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:33,963
<i>* The ornishman's
wife was as fair as the sun *</i>

357
00:28:33,997 --> 00:28:39,085
* An her kisses
were warmer than spring *

358
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,037
* The ornishman's blae *

359
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,372
* It was mae of black steel *

360
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:47,877
* An its kiss
was a terrible thing *

361
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:52,131
* The ornishman's wife
woul sing as she bathe *

362
00:28:52,182 --> 00:28:56,219
- * In a voice that was sweet as a peach... *
- All right, that's enough.

363
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,387
I'm coming to the best part.

364
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:00,389
We're trying to blen in.

365
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,475
on't want everyone in
orne to hear your accent.

366
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:04,310
This song really is
all about the ening.

367
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:06,696
It can wait.
There.

368
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:11,901
That's the Water Garens.

369
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:14,453
<i>An once we've got
the princess, then what?</i>

370
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:19,625
I like to improvise.

371
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,011
That explains the golen han.

372
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:45,902
Unbowe. Unbent.
Unbroken.

373
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:48,437
For Oberyn.

374
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:50,439
For Oberyn.

375
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,264
Well, she's mae
herself at home.

376
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:40,206
Myrcella.

377
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:44,627
Uncle Jaime?

378
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:46,662
I...

379
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:48,914
I on't unerstan.
What are you oing here?

380
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:51,167
Let's speak in private.

381
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:54,003
- I am Trystane Martell.
- Trystane is my intene.

382
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:56,973
Excellent.
Goo to meet you.

383
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,975
We weren't expecting you,
Lor Jaime.

384
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:01,761
Why on't you let them
have some time alone, son?

385
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,434
Let's not o something stupi.

386
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,740
That was something stupi.

387
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:16,325
We have to go, Myrcella, now.

388
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,444
- You hurt him!
- He'll be fine, I promise.

389
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:20,196
But we have to...

390
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:26,085
Oh, for fuck's sake.

391
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:09,161
Take her!

392
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:13,549
- You're coming with me.
- I on't want to.

393
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,784
I wasn't asking, princess.

394
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:25,177
- Ah!
- rop your weapons!

395
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,688
<i>I am Obara San.</i>

396
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:38,107
aughter of Oberyn Martell.

397
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:41,444
I fight for orne.
Who o you fight for?

398
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:43,446
rop your weapons.

399
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:04,800
When you were whole, it woul
have been a goo fight.

400
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:17,313
You fight pretty goo
for a little girl.

401
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:46,225
Halt!

402
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:52,431
Oh, you can smell the shit
from five miles away.

403
00:33:52,482 --> 00:33:54,650
Well, why have we stoppe?
Go on.

404
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,990
Rumors an gossip,
that's all they've got.

405
00:34:01,024 --> 00:34:03,159
It's theater, nothing more.

406
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:06,328
If they arreste all the pillow
biters in King's Laning,

407
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:09,365
there' be no room left in the
ungeons for anyone else.

408
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,283
Everyone knew
about him an Renly.

409
00:34:11,334 --> 00:34:14,870
Renly Baratheon shagge half the
stable boys in the Seven Kingoms.

410
00:34:14,872 --> 00:34:16,755
Everyone knew, no one care.

411
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,374
But he was the king's brother.

412
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,209
An Loras
is the queen's brother.

413
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:22,678
No, no, no, no.
This is unacceptable.

414
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:24,792
- Cersei's behin it.
- Yeah, of course she is.

415
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:27,216
She wants to rag our
name through the irt,

416
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:29,101
put us in our place.

417
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:31,220
Get some rest, ear.
You look appalling.

418
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:33,439
Let me eal
with Cersei Lannister.

419
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:42,948
Your Grace, I have
travelle a long way.

420
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:45,451
You must be exhauste.

421
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:50,623
Put the pen own, ear. We both
know you're not writing anything.

422
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:53,993
Ah, yes. The famously
tart-tongue Queen of Thorns.

423
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,046
An the famous tart
Queen Cersei.

424
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,334
I beg your paron?

425
00:35:02,385 --> 00:35:05,971
I know you're behin this absur
incarceration of my granson.

426
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,841
If you apologize for that
comment, perhaps I'll...

427
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:11,760
You'll get your apology
when I get Loras.

428
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:14,847
I was as shocke as anyone

429
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:17,516
when the Faith
arreste Ser Loras.

430
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,152
I have no love
for these fanatics,

431
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:22,788
but what can a Queen Mother o?

432
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:26,025
Has the crown
suenly stoppe neeing

433
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:29,328
the troops, gol, an
wheat my house supplies?

434
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:31,413
I can assure you,

435
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:33,449
our alliance with
House Tyrell remains...

436
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,117
o you expect
the alliance to continue

437
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:37,870
after you've thrown
our future into prison?

438
00:35:37,954 --> 00:35:40,256
As I sai,

439
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,741
I in't imprison anyone.

440
00:35:42,776 --> 00:35:44,176
As for your
veile threats...

441
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,661
What veil?

442
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:52,518
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought
peace to a war-torn country.

443
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:55,804
o you really want to see the Seven
Kingoms slie back into warfare?

444
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:00,476
I in't trust your father.

445
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:03,145
<i>I in't particularly like him.</i>

446
00:36:03,147 --> 00:36:06,699
<i>But I respecte him.</i>
<i>He was no fool.</i>

447
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:10,452
He unerstoo that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

448
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:12,037
rather than estroy them.

449
00:36:12,072 --> 00:36:14,290
House Lannister has no rival.

450
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,195
The High Septon has calle
for an inquest, not a trial.

451
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,914
Just a small hearing
to etermine

452
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:24,800
whether the charges
against Loras have merit,

453
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,852
which I'm sure they on't.

454
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:30,372
Loras will be free, our happy
alliance will continue...

455
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:35,010
an we'll forget this unfortunate
conversation ever happene.

456
00:36:36,813 --> 00:36:38,347
Goo ay, Lay Olenna.

457
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:00,753
You are aware of the rumors
concerning you an Renly?

458
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:04,456
I on't pay attention to rumors.

459
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:07,826
<i>You were sai to be
esponent when he ie.</i>

460
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:11,397
Witnesses state that you
refuse to leave his besie

461
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:13,966
even as Stannis's army
close in.

462
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:17,853
He was my frien.
He was my king.

463
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:20,305
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

464
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:23,359
<i>He was anointe</i>
<i>by the Seven, not Renly.</i>

465
00:37:23,393 --> 00:37:27,946
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

466
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:31,533
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

467
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:34,036
I fought for him at the
Battle of Blackwater.

468
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,740
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

469
00:37:37,742 --> 00:37:40,125
Why oes it matter what I wore?

470
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,795
o you eny all
the charges against you?

471
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:44,880
Fornication.

472
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:47,082
<i>Buggery.</i>
<i>Blasphemy.</i>

473
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:48,717
Of course I eny them.

474
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:50,803
You never lay
with Renly Baratheon?

475
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:52,788
Never.

476
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:54,973
<i>Nor any other man?</i>

477
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:56,625
Never.

478
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:01,597
That will be all, Ser Loras.

479
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:11,490
Well, I think that's
quite enough of that.

480
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:14,109
The Faith calls
Queen Margaery forwar.

481
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,111
You call me forwar?

482
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:18,497
Yes, we have some
questions for you.

483
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:22,634
- I am the queen.
- You are.

484
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:25,104
An accoring
to the law of the Seven,

485
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,539
neither kings
nor queens are exempt

486
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,459
from testimony
at a holy inquest.

487
00:38:48,478 --> 00:38:52,147
How o you respon to these
charges against your brother?

488
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:53,916
They are lies.

489
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,617
- All of them?
- All of them.

490
00:38:55,652 --> 00:38:58,604
<i>Queen Margaery,</i>

493
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:04,326
of these charges against him

494
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:05,994
to the best of your knowlege?

495
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:08,080
Yes, I swear it.

496
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:11,583
Thank you, Your Grace.

497
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,861

00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:50,539
<i>I squire for him.</i>

502
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:52,374
He took a liking to me.

503
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:55,586
He summone me to his chamber
the first ay we met.

504
00:39:56,629 --> 00:40:00,382
An what occurre
in his chamber?

505
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:04,887
We engage
in intimate relations.

506
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:06,722
You lay with him?

507
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:08,307
That night an many others.

508
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:10,809
Liar.
He's a liar.

509
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:14,229
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

510
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:16,532
Yes.

511
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:19,451
Yes, Queen Margaery.

512
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:22,871
<i>She walke in on us once</i>
<i>not long ago.</i>

513

She in't seem surprise.

514
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:29,545
This testimony is an insult
to a great house.

515
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:32,748
Why shoul the Faith or anyone
else take the wor of a squire

516
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,416
over the heir to Highgaren?

517
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:36,468
<i>He has a birthmark, Your Grace.</i>

518
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:39,421
<i>Quite high on his thigh.</i>

What are you oing?
Let us pass.

522
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:53,268
