When Finlay died,
I was scared.

Dear Mr Lomax,

1097
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:40,820
I was a member of
the Imperial Japanese Army.

1098
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:49,620
We treated you and your
countrymen very, very badly.

I want you to come with me.

If you'd been here,

1113

you'd have caused quite a stir.
