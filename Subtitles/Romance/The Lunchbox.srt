Yes, I'll come after lunch.

May I come in, sir?

719

Come in.

720
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,560
I just had a meeting with
the Accounts Department.

721
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:54,234
And it was the most embarrassing
meeting of my life.

722
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,670
You know what they said?

723
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:03,676
They said, "it's as if our Claims
Department does not exist."

724
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,436
All the pay orders are wrong.

725

all over the place.

to have this man replace you.

01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:21,820
I need you to review this.

01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,622
Stay up all night if
necessary, but fix it.

729
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,490
And as for you, Shaikh, just
get out of my sight. Please.

730
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,466
It's my mistake, sir.

731
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,440
I made the pay orders.

732
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,806
I asked his initials
because we work together.

733
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,802
It's my mistake.

734
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:42,237
Fernandes,

735
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,851
- you don't have to defend him.
- I'm not defending anyone, sir.

736
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,749
Thirty-five years of service.

737
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:53,653
And you have not made
one single mistake.

738
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:56,962
You know I would not
defend anyone, sir.

739
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,365
Anyway,

740
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:05,126
I'll handle the
Accounts Department.

741
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:08,308
- Okay?
- It's okay, sir, no problem.

742
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:17,516
One more thing. Why do these
files all smell of vegetables?

743
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:23,144
- Onions, potatoes, even garlic.
- Really?

744
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:25,825
Smell it. Smell it.

745
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,554
I don't...

746
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,409
(IN HINDI)
Sorry, sir, you saved me today.

747
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,814
Thank you, sir, you saved me.

748
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:03,428
Don't you ever cut your bloody
vegetables on the office files.

749
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,397
(IN ENGLISH) Sorry, sir.

750
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,524
(IN HINDI) Next time,

751
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:13,099
I'll put a plastic bag over the files.
And then cut the vegetables.

752
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,464
(IN ENGLISH) I'm sorry, sir.

753
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:19,367
(IN HINDI) I'm sorry, sir,
no vegetables. Nothing.

754

(IN ENGLISH) I'm sorry, sir.

755
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:25,807
(IN HINDI) This isn't some
cheap restaurant in Saudi!

756
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,408
These are government files!

757
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:28,849
(IN ENGLISH) Do you understand?

758
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,688
(IN HINDI)
If you cannot do this, get lost!

759
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:40,459
(IN HINDI) Why should I get lost?

760
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,563
You will teach me.

761
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,933
I am sorry, sir, but
you will teach me!

762
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:56,438
Did your mother also tell you
to forge a degree to get a job?

763
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:03,222
She must have gotten confused.

764
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:07,489
(IN ENGLISH) What kind of a
person you are, Mr. Shaikh?

765
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:08,990
Huh?

766
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,591
Why don't you come
over for dinner, sir?

767
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:18,393

768

770
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:32,147
Unbelievable, Mr. Shaikh.

771
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,250
Unbelievable.

772
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:41,455
(IN HINDI) Pasanda, he says.

773
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:47,495
(IN HINDI) You'll come, right?

778
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,502
"Don't marry him, he'll
chain you to the stove."

779
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:02,804
Her father is a very dangerous man.

782
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:09,110
was during the 1984 World Cup.

783
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,917
Just a little bit.

Sir, what does your wife do?

787
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:24,665
Be quiet.

788
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,361
I'm sorry, sir, she doesn't know.

789
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:28,870
(IN HINDI) It's okay.

790
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:34,237
My wife has passed away.

791
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,559
But I have a girlfriend.

792
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,223
You?

793
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:52,588
Yes.

794
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,770
MEHERUNISSA: What is her name?

795
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,516

01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,481
I knew it, sir!

The lunchbox, the notes...

799
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,920
When did you get married?

01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:30,900
SHAIKH: Marriage, sir...
Sometimes it feels like 35 years.

801
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:35,329
Sometimes 25, or 10, and sometimes
it feels like it was yesterday.

01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:43,144
Sir, you're not eating,
have some more.

804
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:44,672
It's my recipe, sir.

805
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,607
(IN ENGLISH)
I really don't want it.

806
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:48,446
You're not eating at all.

807
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,659
Sir, I wanted to ask you something.

808
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,655
(IN HINDI) Go ahead.

809
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,331
You asked just now
when we got married.

810
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,962
Actually,

811
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,040
her father said no.

812
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:15,037
He said: "The boy is an orphan,
short and dark-skinned."

813
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,682
So Meherunissa ran away from home.

814
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:32,162
But she doesn't want to get married
without her father's blessing.

815
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:35,890
I won't tell anyone.

816
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,695
No. It's not that.

817
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,331
Her father has agreed now.

818
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:43,572
We are getting married soon.

819
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:52,373
There'll be an army from
her side at the wedding.

820
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:55,714
Brothers and sisters,
their husbands, children,

821
01:16:56,178 --> 01:17:00,224
uncles, aunts, everyone
will be there.

822
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:03,896
And there is no one from my side.

823
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,723
I'm alone.

824
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,096
I wanted to ask, if
you wouldn't mind,

825
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:16,301
being the witness from my side.

826
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:17,900
My "guardian."

827
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,603
Me?

828
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,716
Yes, and if Madam
Ila can come too...

829
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,012

830
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:34,548

- Welcome.

01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,660
Thank you so much, sir.

01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,866
(IN HINDI) Her father insists
on giving me a scooter.

833

834
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,834

01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:48,931

of not taking early retirement.

01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,634
Uh...

838
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:57,510

make you my assistant.

I mean, great news!

842
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:14,588
Don't mention it to my father-in-law,
he'll take the scooter back.

01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,860
- Ha, ha.
- (IN ENGLISH) Sir, please.

844

wanted to talk to me.

It was about pay orders.

What about the pay orders?

859
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,213

01:40:48,675 --> 01:40:50,320
<i>And after that...</i>

1059
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:54,518
<i>After that, we'll see.</i>

1060
01:40:55,616 --> 01:40:59,452
<i>By the time Yashvi comes home
from school, I'll have packed.</i>

1061
01:40:59,453 --> 01:41:01,792
<i>And we'll take the afternoon train.</i>

1062
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:05,124
<i>Maybe I'll send you this letter</i>

1063
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:07,828
<i>and your new postman
will deliver it.</i>

1064
01:41:08,362 --> 01:41:11,566
<i>Or maybe I should
keep it for myself.</i>

1065
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:14,609
<i>And read it again years from now.</i>

1066
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,045
<i>I read somewhere</i>

1067
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:23,151
<i>that sometimes the wrong train
will get you to the right station.</i>

1068
01:41:24,044 --> 01:41:25,621
<i>Let's see.</i>
