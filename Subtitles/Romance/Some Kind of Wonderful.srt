You're trying to
jerk off the impossible.

How many times
do I have to listen
to myself tell you this?

I don't know. How many times?

to a crimson stain on the wall.

360
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,988
Hardy's a jerk.

361
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,290
He... He screws around on her,
he treats her like dirt,

362
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,792
he has no respect for her.
He's just...

363
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,461
And obviously
she gets off on it.

364

You're losing it.

365
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,465

366
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,667
all you are is a loser.

367
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,202
You obviously have
no idea how I feel,

368
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,472
so, why don't you just
butt out of this, please.

So, I've just never seen a girl

391
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,595

kind of a threat?

that I was smiling,

then I can stop.

smiled much lately.

for Christ's sake.

easy on the eyes.

525
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,031
Well, where are you going?

526
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:49,168
I'd like to give Amanda
a ride home.

527

Hey, by the way,
congratulations, dude.

528
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,338
Man, she's smoking, you know.
All right.

529
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,406
Thanks.

530
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,443
Is that... Is that okay?

531
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,378
I'd appreciate
a couple bucks for gas.

532
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,851
Well, sure.
Guess I'll come back
in about an hour?

533
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,719
It's just time.
Not like it means anything.

534
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,189
Thanks.

535
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,126

around an hour?

we could do to
each other in an hour?

538
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,303
It's kind of
a revolting thought, actually.

539
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,905
Really?
What's "revolting" mean?

540
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,540
Oh, my God.

541
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:31,910
Get your hands off me, man.
Does that mean
you want to come over?

542
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,745

Are you out of your mind?

Uh, well, I was just
hoping we could talk.

00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,141
Why don't you call me?

555

Yeah.

556
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,312
Okay.

557
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:07,746
Oh. Why don't you go with him?

558
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,819
Okay. I'm... I'm sorry.
Uh, where's your car?

559

What?

562
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,431
Well, you made me
look really stupid.

563
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:26,898
I did not make you
look really stupid.

564
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,034
He's giving you
the perfect opportunity
to back out.

565
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,269
He wants to talk.
So, tell him.

566
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,403
Tell him you're back with Hardy.

567
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:33,038
I'm not back with Hardy.

568
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,306
Okay, then fine.
Tell him the truth.

569
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,541
Tell him that you used him.

570
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,643
I didn't use him.
Oh, really?

571
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,745
You didn't use him
to get away from Hardy?

572
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,314
It wasn't deliberate.
I was mad and he stepped in.

573
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:44,049
It was just bad circumstances,
okay?

574
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,851
Okay.

you wait to kill it,
the worse it's gonna be.

about it. But...

00:58:38,616 --> 00:58:40,150
Well, it depends.

1044
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,719
No, it doesn't depend.

1045
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:43,053

1046
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:44,855

I know. I'm sorry.

1051
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,939
All right.
Just grow up a little.

1052
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:05,843
She'll probably do this.

1053
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,745
How do you know?

1054
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:10,314

1055

I don't want to.

1140
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:53,330
Will you listen to me for once?

1141
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:54,363
I'm listening.

1142
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,533

It's not what I wanted.

1145
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:03,974
It's what you wanted!
I never wanted it!

1146
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,542
I just didn't have
the guts to tell you!

1147
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,644
You're only 18 years old
for Christ's sake.

1148
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,246
Then I'm 19 and I'm 20!

When does my life belong to me?

1150
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,719
Dad, listen.

1151
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:18,622
I'm going out
with a girl tonight.
And she is beautiful.

1152
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:21,095
And everybody's
in love with her
and she's going out with me.

1153
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,161
Get it?

1154
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,475
See,
in the eyes of most people
around here, I'm a nothing.

1155
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:29,799
And, so I don't
start agreeing with them,

1156
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,368
I'm gonna go through
with this date.

1157
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:37,274
I just... I wanna show
this girl that
I'm as good as anybody else.

1158
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,810
So, what, are you gonna
impress her with money?

1159
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:43,147
Think that's the solution,
Keith?

1160
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,315
Dad, didn't you ever
have guys at your school

1161
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:46,350
that didn't fit in?

1162
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:48,885
Yeah, of course.

1163
01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:50,220
Yeah?

1164
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,590
Well, I'm one of those guys.

1165
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,994
I thought things
were going okay for you.

1166
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:00,965
Yeah. Well, I like art.
I work in a gas station.

1167
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:02,967
My best friend is a tomboy.

1168
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,835
These things
don't fly too well
in the American high school.

1169
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:07,437
I didn't know about this.

1170
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,573
Well,
how could you know about it?
You're my father.

1171
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:13,010
Jesus, Keith, how could you
blow all that money?

1172
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:15,012
Believe me,
there's a good reason
behind all this.

1173
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:17,381
You just got to trust me.

1174
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,883
Trust you?
There's a limit, Keith.

1175
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,651
How can you put
a limit on trust?

1176
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:26,923
Do you know any father
who would let his kid
do something like this?

1177
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,026
No.

1178
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,699
So why should I
have to go along with it?

1179
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,131
Because you believe in me.

1180
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:44,141
Listen,
I'm gonna replace the money.

1181
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,811
Think about it,
you know I will.
I'm not stupid.

1182
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:50,580
I didn't work all this time
just to throw everything away

1183
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:51,681
without thinking about it.

1184
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:54,384
I know what I'm doing.

1185
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,021
You sure?

1186
01:05:57,921 --> 01:05:59,123
Yeah.

1187
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,959
Okay.

1188
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:09,933
But I'm still gonna
ride your ass
about college, Keith,

1189
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,668
I'm not giving up on that.

1190
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:12,736
All right.

1191
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:16,140
I've said my piece.

1192
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,948
Do me a favor, will you?

1193
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,516
Sure.

1194
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,717
Stop calling me Clifford.

1195
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:31,055
No problem.

1196
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,525
Hi.

1197
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:37,594
Stop sneaking around
listening at people's doors.

1198
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,897
Me?
Yeah, you.

1199
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,333
Dad, I just came up
to tell Keith

1200
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:45,007
that Watts is downstairs
waiting for him.

1201
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,604
Well, don't get in his way.

1202
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:51,841
Did he go apeshit?
No.

1203
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,210
Really?

1204
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,678
Laura, I'm really
in kind of hurry now.

1205
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:57,681
Keith, I just came up
to wish you luck tonight.

1206
01:06:57,714 --> 01:07:00,350
Okay, I have all my friends
crossing their fingers
for you.

1207
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:03,019
Thank you.

1208
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,356
He really didn't go apeshit?

1209
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:09,559
He's probably saving it for me.

1210
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,396
You want me to lock up for you?

1211
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:14,030
Please. Thanks.

1212
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:42,792
Give me a break.

1213
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,428

1388
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:45,594
Nobody can stand being alone.

1389
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:47,831
The minute you stop thinking
there's someone
out there for you

1390
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:49,165
it's over, isn't it?

1391
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:53,202
Isn't it?
I don't know.

1392
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:58,407
Listen, I've been waiting
a long time,

1393
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:01,878
and I still don't have it,
but I will.

1394
01:18:03,146 --> 01:18:05,048
What?
What are you talking about?

1395
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,217
You know what I'm talking about.

1396
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:11,287
No, I don't.

1397
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,822
Yes, you do.
It's not funny.

1398
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:14,257
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

1399
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:16,025
I... I don't.
This.

1400
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,029
Tonight was a joke.
I was set up.

1401
01:18:20,764 --> 01:18:22,098
You used me, right?

1402
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:24,968
You think I used you?

1403
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,170
Didn't you?

1404
01:18:29,806 --> 01:18:32,008
I don't know. In a way.
In a way?

1405
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,543
Amanda, there's only one way
you use someone.

1406
01:18:34,577 --> 01:18:36,813
You either do or you don't.

1407
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:38,047
And you didn't use me?

1408
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,184
God, you hypocrite.

1409
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,021
What's hanging
in that museum, huh?

1410
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,390
My soul? No, it's my face.

1411
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,094
You're using me
to pay back every guy

1412
01:18:51,127 --> 01:18:53,196
with more money
and more power than you.

1413
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,199
Paint it any color you want.

1414
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,169
It's still you using me.

1415
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:07,043
You're right.

1416
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:11,014
I did use you.

1417
01:19:12,015 --> 01:19:13,850
For all those reasons.

1418
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,352
I'm sorry.

1419
01:19:20,824 --> 01:19:22,391
Can we call it even?

1420
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:28,097
We're even.

1421
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:42,578
This is for you.

1422
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,047
What is it?

1423
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,182
It's my future.

1424
01:19:48,985 --> 01:19:50,820
In this box is my future,

1425
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,256
every cent I've ever earned.

1426
01:19:54,557 --> 01:19:55,925
It's for you.

1427
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:14,310
I can't take these.

1428
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:16,645
You have to.

1429
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:19,348
I know you liked them.
I saw you wearing Shayne's,
remember?

1430
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:23,286
This is insane.
It doesn't make any sense.

1431
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,254
You shouldn't have
to borrow anything.

1432
01:20:26,222 --> 01:20:27,891
You're too good for that.

1433
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:36,299
Why are you crying?

1434
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:40,136
I feel so terrible
for what I've been doing.

1435
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:45,975
I hate, I hate feeling ashamed.

1436
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:48,945
I hate where I'm from.

1437
01:20:53,116 --> 01:20:55,851
I hate watching my friends
get everything
their hearts desire.

1438

(SIGHING)

1439
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:05,328
I gave in to that hatred
and I turned on
what I believed in.

1440
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,366
I didn't have to.

1441
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:12,501
You didn't.

1442
01:21:15,638 --> 01:21:17,373
So you won't do it again.

1443
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,009
You don't have to.

1444
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,611
Ever.

1445
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:10,426
What now?

1446
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,261
Hardy's house.

1447
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:16,365
Have you forgotten something?
He wants to beat
the crap out of you.

1448
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:18,034
It's for real, Keith.
I know.

1449
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:21,582
Well, if you wanna do that,
drive yourself.

1450
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:25,141
I have to face him
sooner or later.

1451
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:26,809
It's not just Hardy.
It's his friends.

1452
01:22:26,842 --> 01:22:28,011
I can handle it.

1453
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:32,248
I could beat
the crap out of you.

1454
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,882
You won't last six seconds.

1455
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:35,851
I know what I'm doing.

1456
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,320
Don't go overboard, studly.

1457
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:40,656
Let's go.

1458
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,045
WATTS: You don't have to
do this, you know.

1459
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,313
Yeah, I do.

1460
01:23:05,548 --> 01:23:08,017
Okay. I'll be here.

1461
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:10,553
Thanks.

I'm glad you could come by.
It's getting late,

I was worried you were
gonna disappoint us.

1470
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:17,453
So did you have a good time?

1471
01:24:17,486 --> 01:24:18,521
Yeah.

1472
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:20,389
Yeah.

She's deceptively innocent,
isn't she?

1474
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:26,595
Clean and nice on the outside.

1475
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:30,099
Did she do you?

that I'm glad about

1478
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:42,678
is that you get her used.

You're just a fool.

and kick the shit out of him.

What?

I don't play that way.

I am the host here.
I have guests.

Why don't you just
deal with me, huh?

She is dying for you.

1559
01:28:17,192 --> 01:28:19,294
(LAUGHING)

1560
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:20,929
Remind me never to
get you mad at me.

1561
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,767
Did you see
the look on his face?

1562
01:28:26,402 --> 01:28:28,604
* SO LONELY *

1563
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,001
Nice move.
I saw it from out here.

1564
01:29:00,235 --> 01:29:02,671
Well, uh,

1565
01:29:02,705 --> 01:29:04,640
why don't you guys run along?
I'm gonna walk.

1566
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,542
My butt's asleep
from sitting all night.

1567
01:29:11,414 --> 01:29:13,449
I'm sorry if I misjudged you.

1568
01:29:15,418 --> 01:29:16,752
That's okay.

1569
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:23,592
Keys are in the car.

1570
01:29:29,432 --> 01:29:32,868
Remember how I said
I'd rather be with someone
for the wrong reasons

1571
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:34,937
than alone for the right ones?

1572
01:29:37,606 --> 01:29:38,974
I'd rather be right.

1573
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:45,879
It's gonna feel good
to stand on my own.

1574
01:29:48,684 --> 01:29:49,852
Here.

1575
01:29:57,693 --> 01:29:59,853
In your heart
you wanted to give these
to somebody else.

1576
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:03,799
Go.

1577
01:30:05,701 --> 01:30:06,735
Go on.

1578
01:30:19,314 --> 01:30:20,516
Watts!

1579
01:30:29,858 --> 01:30:30,926
Watts!

1580
01:30:32,194 --> 01:30:33,462
Watts.

1581
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:38,634
Watts.

1582
01:31:04,326 --> 01:31:06,829
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1583
01:31:08,096 --> 01:31:10,065
Yeah, well, you're stupid.

1584
01:31:10,098 --> 01:31:11,667
I always knew you were stupid.

1585
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,202
Why didn't you tell me?

1586
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:16,672
You never asked.

1587
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:20,576
(CHUCKLES)

1588
01:31:23,546 --> 01:31:24,913
I wanted these.

1589
01:31:25,614 --> 01:31:26,915
I really wanted them.

1590
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:29,552
They're yours.

1591
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:33,055
You knew
you were gonna get these.

1592
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:34,623
No, I didn't.

1593
01:31:34,657 --> 01:31:37,092
I hoped, but I didn't know.

1594
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,127
You knew.

1595
01:31:40,529 --> 01:31:41,964
I had a feeling.

1596
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,569
Well, how do they look?

1597
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:52,107
You look good wearing my future.

1598
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,077
*(LICK THE TINS PLAYING
CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE)

1599
01:32:05,554 --> 01:32:07,590
* Wise men say

1600
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,926
* Only fools rush in

1601
01:32:12,127 --> 01:32:14,863
* But I can't help

1602
01:32:14,897 --> 01:32:17,933
* Falling in love with you

1603
01:32:19,602 --> 01:32:22,370
* Shall I stay

1604
01:32:22,404 --> 01:32:25,808
* Would it be a sin

1605
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:28,911
* If I can't help

1606
01:32:28,944 --> 01:32:31,546
* Falling in love with you

1607
01:32:33,816 --> 01:32:36,318
* Like a river flows

1608
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:39,755
* Surely to the sea

1609
01:32:41,156 --> 01:32:44,192
* Darling so it goes

1610
01:32:44,226 --> 01:32:46,762
* Some things were meant to be *

1611
01:32:48,096 --> 01:32:50,733
* Take my hand

1612
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:53,636
* Take my whole life too

1613
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:57,472
* 'Cause I can't help

1614
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:00,909

1615
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:19,161
