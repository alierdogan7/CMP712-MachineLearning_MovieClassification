So did they.

190
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:02,540
It's amazing.

191
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:04,138
Just like that.

192
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:05,477
Blackout.

193
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:07,337
&|| My love &||

194
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:10,779
&|| My darlin'&||

195
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:13,215
&|| I've hungered for... &||

196
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:14,751
What are you doing?

197
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:17,784
I couldn't sleep.

198
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:20,791
&|| A long &||

199
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:22,986
&|| Lonely time &||

200
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:24,995
I must
have passed out.

201
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,258
What time is it?

202
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:28,765
It's 2 a.m.

203
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,394
&|| And time &||

204
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,236
&|| Goes by &||

205
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:39,674
&|| So slowly &||

206
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:42,645
&|| And time &||

207
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:46,650
&|| Can do so much &||

208
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:50,620
&|| Are you &||

209
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,918
&|| Still mine &||

210
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,004
Oh, no.

211
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:57,162
I hope it wasn't
a masterpiece.

212
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,866
It's not now.

213
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:02,208
Can I help?

214
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:03,370
Yeah.

215
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:06,380
Put your hands here
and get them wet.

216
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,653
Just let the clay
slide between your fingers.

217
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:16,418
&|| Godspeed your love &||

218
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:21,828
&|| To me &||

219
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:30,395
&|| Lonely rivers flow &||

220
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:32,337
&|| To the sea &||

221
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:34,603
&|| To the sea &||

222
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:37,703
&|| To the open arms &||

223
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,975
&|| Of the sea &||

224
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,914
&|| Yeah &||

225
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:45,078
&|| Lonely rivers sigh &||

226
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,781
&|| Wait for me &||

227
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,153
&|| Wait for me &||

228
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:52,250
&|| I'll be comin'home &||

229
00:13:52,328 --> 00:13:56,492
&|| Wait for me &||

230
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:58,965
&|| Oh &||

231
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:03,733
&|| My love &||

232
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:07,367
&|| My darlin'&||

233
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:09,502
&|| I've hungered &||

234
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:14,777
&|| Hungered for your touch &||

235
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,819
&|| A long &||

236
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:21,686
&|| Lonely time &||

237
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:29,256
&|| And time &||

238
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:32,823
&|| Goes by &||

239
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:36,667
&|| So slowly &||

240
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,707
&|| And time &||

241
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:43,268
&|| Can do so much &||

242
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:47,145
&|| Are you &||

243
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:53,416
&|| Still mine &||

244
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,392
&|| I need &||

245
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,987
&|| Your love &||

246
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:05,227
&|| I &||

247
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,066
&|| I need your love &||

248
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:13,006
&|| Godspeed your love &||

249
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:19,480
&|| To me &||&||

250
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:06,994
Oh, no.

251
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,963
What's the matter?

252
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,966
A glitch.
What's up?

253
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,970
The Greenberg and White accounts...
I can't get in.

254
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:17,300
The Mac code
isn't working.

255
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:18,634
Oh, I changed it.

256
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:19,639
Why?

257
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,336
Nothing. I want to
nose around a bit.

258
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:23,844
Is something wrong?

259
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,709
Can you keep a secret?

260
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:30,379
Yeah, sure.

261
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:31,714
What's up?

262
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:34,221
There's too much money
in these accounts.

263
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,280
Too much money?
That's impossible.

264
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:44,861
Sam, this is going
to take you hours.

265
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,366
Let me do this.

266
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:47,868
It's already
taken me hours.

267
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:49,369
Let me figure it out.

268
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:50,871
No, that's OK.

269
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:52,873
It's like
a vendetta now.

270
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:54,875
Thanks, though.
I appreciate it.

271
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:56,035
OK.

272
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:59,046
If you start to go blind,
give a shout.

273
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:01,639
OK. Adios.

274
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:05,050
Listen, what are you
and Moll doing tonight?

275
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,055
We're going to the theater
to see Macbeth.

276
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:10,182
She likes
the guys in tights.

277
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,692
You want to go?

278
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,852
No, thanks.

279
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:14,555
I want a full
report, though.

280
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,722
Later.

281
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:16,889
Yeah.

282
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:23,837
Well, I loved it.

283
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:26,340
I was spellbound
the whole time.

284
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:27,841
I could tell.

285
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,343
So could
everyone else

286
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:32,039
with that resonating
snore of yours.

287
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,519
Did I tell you
what Melissa said?

288
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,021
Yeah, about six times.

289
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,522
It wasn't six times.

290
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:45,025
Quit being
so blase about this.

291
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:46,526
This is really
important.

292
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:49,029
I'll have two pieces
in her gallery.

293
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:53,033
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

294
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,534
Molly,
The New York Times

295
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:56,537
is just some
frustrated little critic

296
00:17:56,605 --> 00:18:00,041
with pimples on his ass
who flunked art school.

297
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:01,473
Who cares what they think?

298
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:03,977
About eight million
readers, that's who.

299
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:07,880
Nah, they're just
reading the sports page.

300
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,884
Your work
is really beautiful.

301
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,385
It really is.

302
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:12,545
Thanks.

303
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:15,055
It shouldn't matter
what anyone else thinks,

304
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:16,556
just what I think.

305
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,997
I want
to marry you, Sam.

306
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,328
What?

307
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,732
What?

308
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,361
Yep.

309
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,770
I've been
thinking about it.

310
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,274
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

311
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:37,540
and I think we
should just do it.

312
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,376
You're serious.

313
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:40,938
Yeah.

314
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,383
What's that look for?

315
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:54,345
You never wanted
to talk about it.

316
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:06,053
Do you love me, Sam?

317
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:09,217
Well, what do you think?

318
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:11,227
Why don't you
ever say it?

319
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:14,731
What do you mean?
I say it all the time.

320
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:16,231
No, you say "ditto,"

321
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,461
and that's
not the same.

322
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:23,072
People say I love you
all the time,

323
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,506
and it doesn't
mean anything.

324
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:31,105
You know, sometimes
you need to hear it.

325
00:19:32,283 --> 00:19:34,274
I need to hear it.

326
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,011
Let's go.

327
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:46,995
What should we do?

328
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,497
Let me handle it.

329
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:49,998
What do you want?

330
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,001
Your wallet...
give it to me!

331
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:55,197
Sam, just give it to him.

332
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:59,837
OK, just take the money.
Just leave...

333
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,639
No, Sam...

334
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:03,646
You son of a bitch!

335
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,646
Sam, don't!

336
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:10,385
Somebody help us!

337
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:12,581
Jesus Christ, Sam!

338
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,383
Just get off him.

339
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:17,256
Somebody!

340
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:19,193
Somebody help us!

341
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:21,026
Sam, just let...

342
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:24,064
Sam, stop it.

343
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,567
Stop it, Sam!

344
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:27,365
[Gunshot]

345
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:47,051
Molly?

346
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:51,026
Molly, he got...

347
00:20:57,668 --> 00:20:58,999
Sam...

348
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,738
Baby, hold on.

349
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,777
You're going
to be OK.

350
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:11,244
Somebody?

351
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:13,078
Somebody?

352
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,015
Somebody help us!

353
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:16,416
Oh, Sam.

354
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:19,822
Oh, my God.

355
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,824
Oh, Sam, come on.

356
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:23,416
Hold on, baby.

357
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:25,894
Someone's going to come.

358
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,557
You're going to be OK.

359
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,104
Somebody!

360
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:42,839
Somebody help me!

361
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:44,972
Please, anybody!

362
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:47,073
Help me. Please help me.

363
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:49,142
Take it easy, all right?

364
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:52,087
We'll help you, OK?

365
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:54,750
Molly? Molly?

366
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:55,985
Molly?

367
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:00,324
OK.

368
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:01,762
All right.
All right.

369
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:03,094
Molly?

370
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,600
What should we do?

371
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:05,760
Aah!

372
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,037
Aah!

373
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:12,371
Aah!

374
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:15,811
What's happening?

375
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:18,472

&|| 99 bottles of beer &||

743
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:38,522
&|| Take one down
Pass it around... &||&||

744
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:40,355
Don't sing, all right?

745
00:47:40,427 --> 00:47:41,359
[Molly]
Hello?

746
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:42,861
Molly...

747
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,362
Shh! She can't hear you.

748
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:45,864
Hi, I'm Oda Mae.

749
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:48,867
I called you about
your friend Sam Wheat?

750
00:47:48,935 --> 00:47:49,867
[Click]

751
00:47:49,936 --> 00:47:51,836
I told you.

752
00:47:58,578 --> 00:48:00,876
Hey, Molly!
Molly Jensen.

753
00:48:00,947 --> 00:48:03,814
I know you're up there.
I know you hear me.

754
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:06,318
I'm down here.
Sam wants to talk to you.

755
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,377
This is for real.

756
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:10,389
Remember the starfish
in Montego Bay?

757
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:13,722
How would I know that
if he wasn't here?

758
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:16,227
Hey, Molly, I know
about the green underwear

759
00:48:16,296 --> 00:48:18,230
that you wrote
your name on.

760
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:21,495
I'd never get over that,
I tell you that.

761
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:24,503
I know about
the picture in Reno.

762
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,095
Hey, Molly!

763
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:29,609
Ask her about the sweater
she knitted in the closet

764
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:31,109
that's too big.

765
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:35,615
He asked me to remind you
of the sweater in the closet

766
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:37,513
that you knitted
that's too big.

767
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:39,745
Four sizes.

768
00:48:41,154 --> 00:48:43,588
Hey, you hear me
talking to you?

769
00:48:43,657 --> 00:48:45,090
I hear you.

770
00:48:45,158 --> 00:48:46,853
Shut up. Nobody's
talking to you.

771
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:48,360
Ever hear of a phone?

772
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:50,157
Want to kiss my butt?

773
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,664
I'm not staying
down here all day.

774
00:48:52,732 --> 00:48:53,664
Thank God.

775
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:55,166
Aw, man, shut up.

776
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:57,669
Molly! I'm going
to count to 3,

777
00:48:57,737 --> 00:49:00,137
and I'm out of here.

778
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:01,572
1, 2, 3.

779
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:04,909
No, Oda, wait.

780
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:05,910
No.

781
00:49:05,979 --> 00:49:07,310
It's Molly.

782
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:15,548
Molly?

783
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:20,549
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

784
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:26,462
I don't know you or Sam,

785
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:28,967
but let me tell you
what he did.

786
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:30,969
He kept me up all night

787
00:49:31,037 --> 00:49:32,800
singing I'm Henry
The Eighth, I Am.

788
00:49:32,872 --> 00:49:36,501
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

789
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:37,873
Look, I'm sorry.

790
00:49:37,944 --> 00:49:39,878
I just...
I just don't believe

791
00:49:39,946 --> 00:49:43,109
in this life
after death stuff.

792
00:49:43,183 --> 00:49:44,616
Well, tell her
she's wrong.

793
00:49:44,684 --> 00:49:47,152
He says
you're wrong.

794
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,154
You're talking to him
right now?

795
00:49:49,222 --> 00:49:52,521
He just asked me to tell you
that you're wrong.

796
00:49:52,592 --> 00:49:54,025
So where is he?

797
00:49:54,094 --> 00:49:57,586
I can't see him.
I can only hear him.

798
00:49:57,664 --> 00:50:00,064
I'm right here.

799
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:02,397
That doesn't help,
Sam.

800
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:05,529
I'm holding
her hand.

801
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:07,800
He says he's
holding your hand.

802
00:50:17,784 --> 00:50:19,217
What are you doing?

803
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:23,017
What do you think
you're doing to me?

804
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:26,456
If you think I'm here for
my health, you're crazy.

805
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:29,427
Sam's dead, OK?
He's dead.

806
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:31,430
Tell her
I love her.

807
00:50:31,498 --> 00:50:33,466
He says
he loves you.

808
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:37,561
Sam would
never say that.

809
00:50:37,637 --> 00:50:38,569
Say ditto.

810
00:50:38,638 --> 00:50:40,071
What the hell
is ditto?

811
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,368
Ditto!

812
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,368
To tell you
the truth,

813
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:14,875
I don't know how
I'm doing this.

814
00:51:14,944 --> 00:51:16,377
Confidentially,
nothing like this

815
00:51:16,445 --> 00:51:18,379
has ever happened
to me before.

816
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:19,880
I mean, nothing.

817
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:21,883
Now I can't
turn it off.

818
00:51:24,086 --> 00:51:26,213
Is this him?
Is this you?

819
00:51:26,288 --> 00:51:27,220
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

820
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:29,052
Huh. Cute.

821
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,820
White,
but cute.

822
00:51:30,893 --> 00:51:33,259
What I don't
understand is,

823
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,058
why did he come back?

824
00:51:35,131 --> 00:51:36,564
I don't know.

825
00:51:36,632 --> 00:51:38,065
Why is he
still here?

826
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:40,068
He's stuck,
that's what it is.

827
00:51:40,136 --> 00:51:41,569
He's in between
worlds.

828
00:51:41,637 --> 00:51:43,104
You know,
it happens sometimes

829
00:51:43,172 --> 00:51:45,606
that the spirit gets
yanked out so quick

830
00:51:45,674 --> 00:51:47,107
that the essence
still feels

831
00:51:47,176 --> 00:51:48,609
it has work to do.

832
00:51:48,677 --> 00:51:50,008
Would you stop rambling?

833
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,512
I'm just answering
her question.

834
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,013
He's got
an attitude now.

835
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:55,141
I don't have an attitude.

836
00:51:55,217 --> 00:51:57,151
Yes, you do
have an attitude.

837
00:51:57,219 --> 00:51:58,618
We're having
a little discussion.

838
00:51:58,687 --> 00:52:00,621
If you didn't have
a attitude,

839
00:52:00,689 --> 00:52:02,486
you wouldn't have
raised your voice.

840
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:03,991
God damn it,
Oda Mae...

841
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,493
Don't you god damn me.

842
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:07,859
Don't you take
the Lord's name in vain.

843
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,192
Would you relax?

844
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:11,199
You relax.
You're the dead guy.

845
00:52:11,267 --> 00:52:13,201
Want me to help?
You apologize.

846
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:14,201
Jesus Christ!

847
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,396
I'm leaving.

848
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:17,871
Nobody talks to me like that,
you understand?

849
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,373
Now, you better
apologize.

850
00:52:19,442 --> 00:52:20,875
I'm sorry.

851
00:52:20,943 --> 00:52:21,875
I apologize.

852
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:23,434
OK?

853
00:52:23,512 --> 00:52:26,276
Now, would you
sit down?

854
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:27,280
Please?

855
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:29,579
He's apologized.

856
00:52:30,753 --> 00:52:33,688
I need you to tell
Molly what I'm saying,

857
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:36,691
but you have to tell her
word for word.

858
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:40,195
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying

859
00:52:40,262 --> 00:52:42,492
word for word.

860
00:52:47,303 --> 00:52:48,736
Molly, you're in danger.

861
00:52:48,804 --> 00:52:51,739
You can't just
blurt it out like that.

862
00:52:51,807 --> 00:52:53,502
And quit moving around,
will you?

863
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:55,009
You're making me dizzy.

864
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:57,602
I'll just tell her
in my own way.

865
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,309
Molly, you in danger,
girl.

866
00:53:01,383 --> 00:53:03,317
What are you
talking about?

867
00:53:03,385 --> 00:53:05,546
I know the man
who killed me.

868
00:53:05,621 --> 00:53:07,088
He knows
who killed him.

869
00:53:07,156 --> 00:53:09,886
His name's Willy Lopez.
I know where he lives.

870
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:11,893
He's a Puerto Rican,
Willy Lopez.

871
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:13,326
He knows
where he lives.

872
00:53:13,395 --> 00:53:14,327
Write it down.

873
00:53:14,396 --> 00:53:15,829
You write it down.

874
00:53:15,898 --> 00:53:17,331
I ain't no
damn secretary.

875
00:53:17,399 --> 00:53:18,366
Just do it!

876
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:19,867
Argh!

877
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:22,301
He's so testy.

878
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:25,363
What is it you
want me to write?

879
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:28,239
It's 303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

880
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,743
303 Prospect Place?

881
00:53:29,812 --> 00:53:30,744
Yeah.

882
00:53:30,813 --> 00:53:32,906
That's my
neighborhood.

883
00:53:32,982 --> 00:53:34,916
Molly, he's got
my wallet,

884
00:53:34,984 --> 00:53:36,417
he's got my key,

885
00:53:36,485 --> 00:53:37,918
and he was
in here.

886
00:53:37,987 --> 00:53:41,252
He's got his wallet
and key and was here.

887
00:53:41,323 --> 00:53:43,257
Yesterday after your
walk with Carl,

888
00:53:43,325 --> 00:53:45,759
you talked to Floyd,
took off your clothes...

889
00:53:45,828 --> 00:53:47,261
All right,
all right.

890
00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:49,627
When you came in
after your walk with Carl,

891
00:53:49,698 --> 00:53:51,666
he saw
everything.

892
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:54,168
Go to the police.
It was a setup.

893
00:53:54,236 --> 00:53:56,204
I was murdered.

894
00:53:56,272 --> 00:53:59,264
He says go to the police.
He was murdered.

895
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:00,808
There's somebody
else involved...

896
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:03,709
I don't want no more
to do with this.

897
00:54:03,779 --> 00:54:05,212
Where are you going?

898
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:08,216
I'm leaving, I did everything
I said I'd do.

899
00:54:08,284 --> 00:54:10,411
And don't be
following me.

900
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:12,386
I'm finished.
I mean it.

901
00:54:12,454 --> 00:54:14,888
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death.

902
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:15,981
Goodbye.

903
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:21,052
Molly, there is no one
on earth besides you

904
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,327
who wants this
to be true more than me,

905
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,766
but you got to be
rational about this.

906
00:54:26,835 --> 00:54:29,963
Sam is no more
in this room than...

907
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:35,636
Look, I understand the
need to hang on to him,

908
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:38,680
I really do,
but this is absurd.

909
00:54:38,747 --> 00:54:42,808
I know this seems absurd,
but it had to be real.

910
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:44,819
You believed some
fortune-teller from Brooklyn

911
00:54:44,887 --> 00:54:46,912
who shows up
at your door?

912
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:49,924
I watched her have
a conversation with him.

913
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:52,153
I don't buy it, Moll,
not for a minute.

914
00:54:52,228 --> 00:54:54,526
What about the things
she knew?

915
00:54:54,597 --> 00:54:56,155
What things?

916
00:54:56,232 --> 00:55:00,168
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

917
00:55:00,236 --> 00:55:01,999
Carl, we were alone.

918
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:05,472
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

919
00:55:08,677 --> 00:55:11,202
She said Sam knew
who killed him.

920
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,647
Yeah, that he
was set up.

921
00:55:14,717 --> 00:55:16,685
This is getting
deranged.

922
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:18,185
We're off
the deep end.

923
00:55:18,254 --> 00:55:20,484
She had a name
and an address...

924
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:21,488
Willy Lopez.

925
00:55:21,557 --> 00:55:23,991
303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

926
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:26,794
This is sick.

927
00:55:26,862 --> 00:55:28,352
Oh, Carl.

928
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,398
This is really sick.

929
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,524
Oh, God.

930
00:55:32,601 --> 00:55:34,034
Molly, I don't
understand

931
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:36,037
how you could...
you could...

932
00:55:38,607 --> 00:55:40,541
swallow this crap.
I mean...

933
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:43,043
this guy
may not even exist.

934
00:55:43,112 --> 00:55:46,047
Maybe she's just
trying to use you

935
00:55:46,115 --> 00:55:48,709
to set someone up.

936
00:55:48,784 --> 00:55:50,809
You're right.

937
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:52,319
You're absolutely right.

938
00:55:52,388 --> 00:55:55,323
That's what
I got to find out.

939
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,825
What do you mean,
find out?

940
00:55:57,893 --> 00:56:01,226
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

941
00:56:01,297 --> 00:56:03,731
Sam wants you to
go to the police?

942
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:06,563
Jesus, Moll. Are you
out of your mind?

943
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:09,069
What are you going
to tell the police?

944
00:56:09,138 --> 00:56:10,571
That some
storefront psychic

945
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,073
has been communing
with the dead?

946
00:56:13,142 --> 00:56:15,576
Do you know what
that sounds like?

947
00:56:15,644 --> 00:56:18,078
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

948
00:56:19,748 --> 00:56:20,680
I'm sorry.

949
00:56:20,749 --> 00:56:23,513
This stuff just really
gets to me,

950
00:56:23,585 --> 00:56:24,517
you know?

951
00:56:24,586 --> 00:56:27,020
It's OK if you
don't believe me.

952
00:56:27,089 --> 00:56:28,522
I'm trying to, Molly.

953
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:33,719
Look...

954
00:56:33,796 --> 00:56:36,731
if it'll make you
feel any better,

955
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:41,031
I'll go check
this out, OK?

956
00:56:41,103 --> 00:56:44,038
I want you to try
and get some sleep.

957
00:56:44,106 --> 00:56:45,038
OK?

958
00:56:45,107 --> 00:56:46,972
All right.

959
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,044
I'll call you
in the morning.

960
00:56:50,112 --> 00:56:51,044
OK.

What the hell
are you doing here?

965
00:57:39,366 --> 00:57:41,300
Who you been
talking to, Willy?

966
00:57:41,368 --> 00:57:43,802
"Talking to"?
What the hell do you mean?

967
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:46,135
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

968

Where's she
getting it from?

969
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,642
I haven't said
a word to anybody.

970
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:53,145
She knows your name
and where you live.

971
00:57:53,213 --> 00:57:55,613
A lot of women
know where I live.

972
00:57:55,683 --> 00:57:57,617
This is not a joke.

973
00:57:57,685 --> 00:57:59,619
She knows
about the murder.

974
00:57:59,687 --> 00:58:02,247
I want you
to find this bitch,

975
00:58:02,323 --> 00:58:03,756

Just get rid
of her, OK?

00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,567
I've got $4 million stuck
in a god damn computer.

those codes,

What the hell
is wrong with you?

987
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,311
Is everything a joke?

988
00:58:35,389 --> 00:58:37,084
You killed a man.

989
00:58:37,157 --> 00:58:38,249
You were supposed
to steal his wallet.

990
00:58:38,325 --> 00:58:40,691
- Was that a joke?
- I did you a favor.

991
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:42,194
That was a freebie.

Look, these are

993
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,034

for me.

I've risked my job.
I could go to jail.

let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

I'll get the address book
myself, OK?

Why? You were
my friend!

I had a life!

Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

1005

But she was real.

any new information

1009
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:08,714
that I should come.

saying it,

1013
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:20,292
and I want
to cringe.

1014
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,329

she couldn't have known.

1015

only said to me.

to get undressed again.

important things to do.

is Willy Lopez.

is check it out.

got a record, all right?

on Willy Lopez?

There isn't one.

some old boyfriend

to get even with.

private things.

have known all that?

1098
01:06:33,571 --> 01:06:35,505
[Knock Knock Knock]

1099
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:42,544
Who is it?

1100
01:06:42,613 --> 01:06:44,046
It's Carl, Molly.

1101
01:06:44,114 --> 01:06:45,138
No.

1102
01:06:45,216 --> 01:06:46,649
Don't open it,
Molly.

1103
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:48,150
He's a murderer.

1104
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:49,151
Hi.

1105
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,152
Hey.

1106
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:51,654
I know it's late.

1107
01:06:51,722 --> 01:06:53,485
I'm sorry
to disturb you.

1108
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:56,082
I've been thinking
about you all day,

1109
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,527
and I feel really lousy
about what happened last night.

1110
01:06:59,597 --> 01:07:01,030
This supernatural
thing just...

1111
01:07:01,098 --> 01:07:03,225
Don't worry about it.
It's OK.

1112
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,528
No, it's not.

1113
01:07:04,602 --> 01:07:07,537
You needed me to hear you,
and I didn't.

1114
01:07:07,605 --> 01:07:10,540
I wasn't there for you,
and that was...

1115
01:07:10,608 --> 01:07:12,235
that was wrong.

1116
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:13,742
It's just, I...

1117
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:16,712
I just...

1118
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,772
I want you to know
that I'm your friend.

1119
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:21,317
Thanks, Carl.

1120
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:23,216
You were never
our friend.

1121
01:07:23,287 --> 01:07:25,721
That really means
a lot to me.

1122
01:07:25,789 --> 01:07:28,451
Me, too. I brought you
some Japanese apple pears.

1123
01:07:28,526 --> 01:07:29,959
I know you like them.

1124
01:07:31,795 --> 01:07:32,727
Thanks.

1125
01:07:32,796 --> 01:07:34,229
That's very sweet.

1126
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:36,562
Could I come in
for a second?

1127
01:07:36,634 --> 01:07:39,000
It's just been
one of those days.

1128
01:07:39,069 --> 01:07:40,331
Maybe some coffee?

1129
01:07:40,404 --> 01:07:41,735
Yeah. Come on in.

1130
01:07:41,805 --> 01:07:43,466
No, Molly.

1131
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:45,475
You seem a little tense.

1132
01:07:45,543 --> 01:07:47,010
Are you OK?

1133
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:48,510
No. I'm fine.

1134
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:51,514
It's just...
What can I tell you?

1135
01:07:51,582 --> 01:07:53,015
It's been tough.

1136
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:55,381
It just still hurts
so much.

1137
01:07:55,452 --> 01:07:56,885
You lying snake.

1138
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:59,889
And on top of it,
it's stuff at work.

1139
01:07:59,957 --> 01:08:02,187
They've given me
my own accounts,

1140
01:08:02,259 --> 01:08:03,692
which is good,

1141
01:08:03,761 --> 01:08:07,197
but I just haven't really
had time to adjust,

1142
01:08:07,264 --> 01:08:09,061
kind of absorb
everything.

1143
01:08:13,304 --> 01:08:14,737
It's no big deal.

1144
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:18,573
Yeah.

1145
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:27,918
Can I have just
a little more cream?

1146
01:08:28,986 --> 01:08:30,078
Yeah.

1147
01:08:31,488 --> 01:08:32,614
Oh, shit.

1148
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,124
Jesus. I can't believe
I did that.

1149
01:08:35,192 --> 01:08:36,489
Are you all right?

1150
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,494
Yeah, I'm fine.

1151
01:08:38,562 --> 01:08:39,494
Oh, God.

1152
01:08:39,563 --> 01:08:41,929
Let me throw that
in the washer.

1153
01:08:41,999 --> 01:08:44,797
Don't worry about it.
It's OK. It's just...

1154
01:08:44,868 --> 01:08:46,301
You want
another shirt?

1155
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,930
No. It'll dry.
It'll just take a minute.

1156
01:08:49,006 --> 01:08:50,439
There you go.

1157
01:08:53,644 --> 01:08:55,009
Where were you today?

1158
01:08:55,079 --> 01:08:58,173
I thought you were going
to come into the bank

1159
01:08:58,248 --> 01:08:59,772
and sign those papers?

1160
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:02,580
I was supposed to,
but I didn't have time.

1161
01:09:02,653 --> 01:09:05,645
I went to the police.

1162
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:13,087
You did?

1163
01:09:13,163 --> 01:09:15,097
Wow. What
did you tell them?

1164
01:09:15,165 --> 01:09:16,598
What did they say?

1165
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,100
It was awful.

1166
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,304
I felt really stupid.

1167
01:09:21,372 --> 01:09:24,773
They brought out a file
on this woman and...

1168
01:09:24,842 --> 01:09:26,776
At least
10 inches thick.

1169
01:09:27,911 --> 01:09:29,469
A ripoff artist, huh?

1170
01:09:29,546 --> 01:09:30,672
No, Molly.

1171
01:09:32,383 --> 01:09:34,317
You know,
the sad thing...

1172
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:37,987
is that
I believed her.

1173
01:09:38,055 --> 01:09:39,488
Molly...

1174
01:09:41,492 --> 01:09:43,653
sometimes
we need to believe.

1175
01:09:45,095 --> 01:09:46,528
Why? What's the point?

1176
01:09:46,597 --> 01:09:50,328
Molly, it's not easy to face
the realities of life sometimes.

1177
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:52,494
You got to
give yourself that.

1178
01:09:52,569 --> 01:09:57,268
What you've got to remember
is the love that you guys felt.

1179
01:09:57,341 --> 01:09:59,775
You got to remember
how good Sam was.

1180
01:09:59,843 --> 01:10:02,277
You were everything
to him, Molly.

1181
01:10:02,346 --> 01:10:03,779
You were his life.

1182
01:10:18,462 --> 01:10:19,895
I feel so alone.

1183
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:29,869
You're not alone.

1184
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:30,870
OK?

1185
01:10:32,073 --> 01:10:34,598
You got your work.
You're incredibly talented.

1186
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:35,643
You're young.

1187
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:38,008
You're fantastically
gorgeous.

1188
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:42,048
I don't know
what's real anymore.

1189
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:45,712
I don't know
what to think.

1190
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:50,652
Just think about Sam.

1191
01:10:53,194 --> 01:10:56,061
Think about the time
you guys had together.

1192
01:10:57,299 --> 01:10:59,130
How wonderful that was.

1193
01:11:00,502 --> 01:11:01,730
Yeah.

1194
01:11:02,904 --> 01:11:05,896
Let your feelings out,
Moll. It's OK.

1195
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:08,374
Life turns on a dime.

1196
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:10,935
You know?

1197
01:11:12,547 --> 01:11:13,571
I mean...

1198
01:11:14,716 --> 01:11:16,240
people think that...

1199
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:19,412
they're there forever, that there's
always going to be tomorrow,

1200
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:20,920
but that's bullshit.

1201
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:22,980
Sam taught us that.

1202
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:26,760
You have to
live for now.

1203
01:11:29,297 --> 01:11:30,491
For today.

1204
01:11:50,518 --> 01:11:51,450
I can't.

1205
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:52,451
I'm sorry.

1206
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,452
It's OK.

1207
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:56,183
L... l... I can't.
It's just too soon.

1208
01:11:56,257 --> 01:11:57,189
It's OK.

1209
01:11:57,258 --> 01:11:59,158
You've been great,
Carl.

1210
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:04,264
But I need you
to leave.

1211
01:12:04,332 --> 01:12:05,731
I understand totally.

1212
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,732
Please.

1213
01:12:12,307 --> 01:12:15,606
Could we just have dinner
tomorrow night? Just talk?

1214
01:12:15,677 --> 01:12:18,111
Can I interest you
in that?

1215
01:12:19,347 --> 01:12:20,405
Yeah.

1216
01:12:20,482 --> 01:12:21,414
Sure.

1217
01:12:21,483 --> 01:12:22,415
Great.

1218
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:31,651
Hey.

1219
01:13:36,257 --> 01:13:38,691
Get off my train!

1220
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,692
No.

1221
01:13:39,761 --> 01:13:41,524
Get off!

1222
01:13:41,596 --> 01:13:42,654
Get off!

1223
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:43,527
Get off!

1224
01:13:43,598 --> 01:13:44,997
Get off!

1225
01:13:45,066 --> 01:13:46,328
Get off!

1226
01:13:46,401 --> 01:13:47,629
Get out of here!

1227
01:13:47,702 --> 01:13:48,794
Get off!

1228
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,802
No.

1229
01:13:49,871 --> 01:13:51,805
Show me
how you do that.

1230
01:13:51,873 --> 01:13:54,205
I'm not leaving
till you teach me.

1231
01:13:54,275 --> 01:13:55,299
Get off!

1232
01:13:55,376 --> 01:13:56,468
No.

1233
01:13:56,544 --> 01:13:57,476
Get off!

1234
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:07,212
You stubborn asshole.

1235
01:14:07,288 --> 01:14:08,721
Ha ha ha.

1236
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,223
What are you doing?

1237
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:12,225
What the hell
are you doing?

1238
01:14:12,293 --> 01:14:13,726
What am I doing?

1239
01:14:13,795 --> 01:14:16,229
You're trying to move it
with your finger.

1240
01:14:16,297 --> 01:14:18,527
You can't push it.
You're dead.

1241
01:14:27,075 --> 01:14:29,009
It's all in your mind.

1242
01:14:29,077 --> 01:14:32,513
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

1243
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,514
You think you're
wearing those clothes?

1244
01:14:34,582 --> 01:14:36,914
You think you're crouched
on that floor?

1245
01:14:36,985 --> 01:14:37,917
Bullshit!

1246
01:14:37,986 --> 01:14:40,420
You ain't got a body
no more, son!

1247
01:14:40,488 --> 01:14:41,921
It's all up here!

1248
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,423
You want
to move something,

1249
01:14:43,491 --> 01:14:45,925
you got to move it
with your mind!

1250
01:14:45,994 --> 01:14:47,427
You got to focus!

1251
01:14:47,495 --> 01:14:49,429
How? How do you focus?

1252
01:14:49,497 --> 01:14:52,022
I don't know
how you focus.

1253
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,567
You just focus.

1254
01:14:56,871 --> 01:14:58,600
How did you do that?

1255
01:14:58,673 --> 01:15:01,107
You got to take
all your emotions,

1256
01:15:01,176 --> 01:15:03,872
all your anger, all your love,
all your hate,

1257
01:15:03,945 --> 01:15:05,378
and push it way down

1258
01:15:05,446 --> 01:15:07,209
into the pit
of your stomach

1259
01:15:07,282 --> 01:15:09,716
and let it explode
like a reactor. Pow!

1260
01:15:11,986 --> 01:15:12,918
OK.

1261
01:15:12,987 --> 01:15:13,919
OK.

1262
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,452
Don't laugh.

1263
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:46,744
Way to go, kid.

1264
01:15:46,821 --> 01:15:48,254
I did it.

1265
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:51,448
I did it.

1266
01:15:51,526 --> 01:15:52,959
Way to go.

1267
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:02,903
From your gut,
like I told you.

1268
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,775
Give it time.
What else have you got?

1269
01:16:16,351 --> 01:16:18,785
How long
have you been here?

1270
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:23,219
Since they pushed me.

1271
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,724
Someone pushed you?

1272
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:26,123
Yeah, someone pushed me.

1273
01:16:26,194 --> 01:16:27,525
Who?

1274
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:29,028
You don't believe me?

1275
01:16:29,097 --> 01:16:31,964
You think I fell?
You think I jumped?

1276
01:16:32,033 --> 01:16:33,466
Well, fuck you!

1277
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:35,229
It wasn't my time!

1278
01:16:35,303 --> 01:16:37,237
I wasn't supposed to go!

1279
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:39,739
I'm not supposed
to be here!

1280
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:43,971
Oh.

1281
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,472
Oh.

1282
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:53,005
Oh, I'd give anything
for a drag.

1283
01:16:53,138 --> 01:16:55,402
Just one drag.

1284
01:16:55,474 --> 01:16:57,237
Are you all right?

1285
01:16:57,309 --> 01:17:00,073
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

1286
01:17:00,145 --> 01:17:02,170
Who sent you?

1287
01:17:04,182 --> 01:17:05,979
Who sent you?

1288
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,644
Leave me alone.

1289
01:17:09,721 --> 01:17:11,154
Leave me alone!

1290
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:13,453
Leave me alone!

1291
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:57,791
Yes!

1292
01:18:13,285 --> 01:18:14,718
You need
to concentrate,

1293
01:18:14,786 --> 01:18:16,219
'cause if
you concentrate,

1294
01:18:16,288 --> 01:18:17,721
you'll probably
rouse him.

1295
01:18:17,789 --> 01:18:19,222
What's his name
again?

1296
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:20,223
Orlando.

1297
01:18:20,292 --> 01:18:21,350
Orlando.

1298
01:18:21,426 --> 01:18:24,259
Orlando. Orlando.
Is there an Orlando here?

1299
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:25,261
I'm here.

1300
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,262
He's here.

1301
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,593
Oda Mae, l...

1302
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:28,598
Sam.

1303
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,100
Excuse me.
I'm Orlando.

1304
01:18:30,168 --> 01:18:31,601
The line's
over there.

1305
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,604
Where did these ghosts
come from?

1306
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:35,105
You can hear them, too?

1307
01:18:35,173 --> 01:18:38,108
I hear them in the morning
and the evening.

1308
01:18:38,176 --> 01:18:39,803
They're coming
into the shower.

1309
01:18:39,878 --> 01:18:42,904
Did you tell every spook
you met about me?

1310
01:18:42,981 --> 01:18:45,643
I got spooks from Jersey
coming in here.

1311
01:18:45,717 --> 01:18:48,481
There's stuff going on
you wouldn't believe.

1312
01:18:48,553 --> 01:18:50,521
It's amazing.
You're really doing it.

1313
01:18:50,589 --> 01:18:51,521
I know.

1314
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,421
Can you
hurry this up?

1315
01:18:53,492 --> 01:18:55,619
Oh, chill out.
Chill out.

1316
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:57,127
I need your help.

1317
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:59,163
There's something
we need to do.

1318
01:18:59,231 --> 01:19:01,665
I'm not doing anything
else with you, Sam.

1319
01:19:01,733 --> 01:19:03,667
You're holding on
to a life

1320
01:19:03,735 --> 01:19:05,225
that doesn't
want you anymore.

1321
01:19:05,303 --> 01:19:07,533
It doesn't want you.
Give up the ghost.

1322
01:19:07,606 --> 01:19:09,540
Are you speaking
to me?

1323
01:19:09,608 --> 01:19:11,542
Does it look like it?

1324
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:14,238
You're supposed to be
concentrating, aren't you?

1325
01:19:14,312 --> 01:19:15,745
You going to try it?

1326
01:19:15,814 --> 01:19:17,076
Thank you very much.

1327
01:19:17,149 --> 01:19:19,583
Sam, are you going
to get out of here?

1328
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:20,583
Uh-uh.

1329
01:19:20,652 --> 01:19:22,085
Fine, then stay there.

1330
01:19:22,154 --> 01:19:23,086
Excuse me.

1331
01:19:23,155 --> 01:19:24,087
Excuse me.

1332
01:19:24,156 --> 01:19:25,521
You ready now?

1333
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,023
Let's do it.

1334
01:19:27,092 --> 01:19:29,526
I got to talk
to you now.

1335
01:19:29,594 --> 01:19:31,027
I've got a plan.

1336
01:19:31,096 --> 01:19:34,691
All we got to do
is we can...

1337
01:19:34,766 --> 01:19:35,960
Oda Mae?

1338
01:19:42,808 --> 01:19:44,207
Oda Mae.

1339
01:19:46,778 --> 01:19:47,836
Ortisha?

1340
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,215
Orlando. Is that you?

1341
01:19:51,283 --> 01:19:54,252
Ortisha, where you at?
I can't hardly see.

1342
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:55,217
Here.
Sh-She's here.

1343
01:19:55,287 --> 01:19:58,688
In front of you.
I'm right here.

1344
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:05,593
Damn, baby, what did
you do to your hair?

1345
01:20:07,632 --> 01:20:09,224
Orlando, you like it?

1346
01:20:09,301 --> 01:20:11,792
It's autumn sunrise.

1347
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:17,742
Get out of me,
you son of a bitch.

1348
01:20:20,812 --> 01:20:23,576
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

1349
01:20:23,648 --> 01:20:24,842
Orlando?

1350
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:26,383
Ugh!

1351
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:28,885
I can barely move.

1352
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:30,751
You should know
better than that.

1353
01:20:30,822 --> 01:20:32,949
Jumping into bodies
wipes you out.

1354
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,956
Everybody out.

1355
01:20:34,025 --> 01:20:35,458
What happened
to Orlando?

1356
01:20:35,527 --> 01:20:38,018
Where's
the insurance policy?

1357
01:20:38,096 --> 01:20:39,529
Are you deaf?

1358
01:20:39,598 --> 01:20:41,896
I said everybody out!

1359
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,229
Everybody out!

1360
01:20:43,301 --> 01:20:44,734
Get out! Get out!

1361
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:46,236
Everybody get out!

1362
01:20:58,083 --> 01:20:59,778
Get out.

1363
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:01,318
You the fortune-teller?

1364
01:21:01,386 --> 01:21:02,819
Who are you?

1365
01:21:02,888 --> 01:21:04,321
That's an interesting
question.

1366
01:21:05,524 --> 01:21:07,151
Why don't you tell me?

1367
01:21:07,225 --> 01:21:08,317
Willy.

1368
01:21:08,393 --> 01:21:09,724
Willy?

1369
01:21:09,794 --> 01:21:11,557
Prospect Place Willy?

1370
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:13,564
Get out of here fast.

1371
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:27,573
Oda Mae!
Sister! Sister!

1372
01:21:29,214 --> 01:21:31,648
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1373
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:36,343
We're in trouble,
so you got to help.

1374
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:39,356
What do you mean we?
You're already dead.

1375
01:21:39,424 --> 01:21:41,756
These people
are trying to kill me.

1376
01:21:41,826 --> 01:21:43,259
And they'll be back.

1377
01:21:43,328 --> 01:21:46,263
Why don't you just find
a house to haunt?

1378
01:21:46,331 --> 01:21:48,765
Get some chains and
rattle them or something.

1379
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:51,097
I have a plan,
and it will work,

1380
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:53,000
but get some
of your fake I.D.s.

1381
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:54,368
Forget it.

1382
01:21:54,439 --> 01:21:57,806
If you do this, they'll
never bother you again.

1383
01:22:02,914 --> 01:22:04,074
Scout's honor.

1384
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:06,883
All right.

1385
01:22:06,952 --> 01:22:08,715
What do I have to do?

1386
01:22:08,787 --> 01:22:10,778
What exactly
do I have to do?

1387
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:14,525
You got a nice dress?

1388
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:20,071
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

1389
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:23,579
Sorry. I made a joke.
I love your shoes.

1390
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:26,080
I don't know anything
about banking.

1391
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,583
Oda Mae, would
you just relax?

1392
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:30,084
Listen, I'm nervous.

1393
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:32,087
I'll get you
through it.

1394
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:34,623
Your fake driver's
license is great.

1395
01:22:34,691 --> 01:22:38,149
Oh, Sam. I don't think
I should do this.

1396
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:41,162
Straight ahead.
A stairway that says new accounts.

1397
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,164
I ain't giving
them money.

1398
01:22:43,232 --> 01:22:45,223
Do what I say.
Don't talk.

1399
01:22:46,235 --> 01:22:47,668
Tell her you're here

1400
01:22:47,737 --> 01:22:51,173
to fill out a signature
card for a new account.

1401
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,609
I'm here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

1402
01:22:55,678 --> 01:22:57,612
Do you know
your account number?

1403
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,204
926-31043.

1404
01:22:59,282 --> 01:23:00,214
926...

1405
01:23:00,283 --> 01:23:01,215
31043.

1406
01:23:01,284 --> 01:23:03,013
31043.

1407
01:23:04,687 --> 01:23:05,619
Rita Miller.

1408
01:23:05,688 --> 01:23:06,620
Who?

1409
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:07,621
Rita Miller.

1410
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:08,657
Rita Miller.

1411
01:23:08,725 --> 01:23:10,158
Didn't you sign a card

1412
01:23:10,226 --> 01:23:11,625
when you opened
the account?

1413
01:23:11,694 --> 01:23:14,162
Carl Bruner opened it
for you by phone

1414
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:16,130
and asked you
to come in today.

1415
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,963
Carl Bruner opened it
for me by phone.

1416
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:21,230
Now he's asked me
to come in today.

1417
01:23:22,538 --> 01:23:23,800
Is that right?

1418
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:25,465
Yeah.

1419
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:31,411
All right. Just sign this
card on the bottom line, please.

1420
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:34,416
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

1421
01:23:39,722 --> 01:23:41,656
No, no, no!
Rita Miller.

1422
01:23:41,724 --> 01:23:43,954
I'm so sorry.

1423
01:23:44,027 --> 01:23:45,494
You know, I...

1424
01:23:45,561 --> 01:23:48,428
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

1425
01:23:53,269 --> 01:23:56,636
Make sure it goes up to
the third floor file

1426
01:23:56,706 --> 01:23:59,140
because you have
a transaction to make.

1427
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:02,143
Make sure this goes
to the third floor file.

1428
01:24:02,211 --> 01:24:04,679
I have a transfusion
to make.

1429
01:24:04,747 --> 01:24:05,679
A what?

1430
01:24:05,748 --> 01:24:07,215
Let's go.

1431
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:10,650
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

1432
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,745
Uh... uh,
yes, sure.

1433
01:24:12,822 --> 01:24:14,517
Thank you so much.

1434
01:24:15,591 --> 01:24:18,526
Bye-bye. I just
love these pens.

1435
01:24:18,594 --> 01:24:22,052
What do you want to
keep the pen for?

1436
01:24:22,131 --> 01:24:23,063
[Ring]

1437
01:24:23,132 --> 01:24:24,565
Carl Bruner speaking.

1438
01:24:24,634 --> 01:24:26,067
Hi, Carl.

1439
01:24:26,135 --> 01:24:27,067
Mr. Balistrari.

1440
01:24:27,136 --> 01:24:30,071
Balistrari? Carl,
it's me, John.

1441
01:24:30,139 --> 01:24:34,576
John. John, sorry, um,
what... what... what... what's up?

1442
01:24:34,644 --> 01:24:37,078
I've got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

1443
01:24:37,146 --> 01:24:38,078
Oh, right.

1444
01:24:38,147 --> 01:24:40,581
I'll pick it up
later, all right?

1445
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,345
I'll be here
till 6:00.

1446
01:24:47,246 --> 01:24:51,046
I don't suppose I can
talk you into losing the hat.

1447
01:24:51,117 --> 01:24:52,550
You keep
messing with me,

1448
01:24:52,618 --> 01:24:54,051
you'll be here
by yourself.

1449
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:59,490
Shh. Now tell the guard
you're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

1450
01:24:59,558 --> 01:25:02,493
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

1451
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:04,495
Do you have
an appointment?

1452
01:25:04,563 --> 01:25:06,497
No, I'm here
for my health.

1453
01:25:06,565 --> 01:25:08,499
Tell him Rita
Miller's here.

1454
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:11,001
You... You just tell him
Rita Miller's here.

1455
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:12,002
One moment.

1456
01:25:12,071 --> 01:25:13,003
Don't embellish.

1457
01:25:13,072 --> 01:25:14,630
Jawohl.

1458
01:25:14,707 --> 01:25:16,072
Excuse me?

1459
01:25:19,779 --> 01:25:22,213
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.

1460
01:25:22,281 --> 01:25:24,215
I've known him
for five years,

1461
01:25:24,283 --> 01:25:26,217
and he still
thinks my name's...

1462
01:25:26,285 --> 01:25:27,718
Why are you
whispering?

1463
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:29,880
Just be quiet
and listen.

1464
01:25:29,955 --> 01:25:31,388
He's a social moron.

1465
01:25:31,457 --> 01:25:34,153
Just tell the guard
Ferguson knows you.

1466
01:25:34,226 --> 01:25:37,161
You spent time with him
and his wife Shirley

1467
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:40,164
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year. Got it?

1468
01:25:40,232 --> 01:25:42,325
What is this
in regards to?

1469
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:44,335
What? He doesn't
remember me?

1470
01:25:44,403 --> 01:25:46,337
Oh, we spent
all that time

1471
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:49,738
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year.

1472
01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:51,242
It was beautiful.

1473
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:54,279
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere.

1474
01:25:54,346 --> 01:25:55,278
It...

1475
01:25:57,183 --> 01:25:58,707
Gas.

1476
01:25:59,785 --> 01:26:02,720
I get a little gas
from time to time.

1477
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:04,221
That's all. Gas.

1478
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:06,690
Quit poking me!

1479
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:08,192
Well,
don't overdo it.

1480
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,194
Now, listen.
This'll be easy.

1481
01:26:10,262 --> 01:26:13,425
Ferguson was so drunk,
he could've had a conversation

1482
01:26:13,499 --> 01:26:15,831
with Tina Turner
and not remember.

1483
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:21,870
I don't know, Sam.

1484
01:26:21,941 --> 01:26:23,374
Here we go.

1485
01:26:26,779 --> 01:26:27,711
Hello. Hello.

1486
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,042
Uh, yes.

1487
01:26:30,716 --> 01:26:32,149
Of course, yes.

1488
01:26:32,218 --> 01:26:34,846
Well, uh, it's been
a... a long time.

1489
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:35,852
Long time.

1490
01:26:35,921 --> 01:26:38,355
Ask how Bobby
and Snooky are doing.

1491
01:26:38,424 --> 01:26:40,358
How are Bobby
and Snooky doing?

1492
01:26:40,426 --> 01:26:42,951
Fine. Fine.
Thank you.

1493
01:26:43,028 --> 01:26:44,461
Thank you
for asking.

1494
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:49,399
Uh, and how is
your, uh, family?

1495
01:26:49,468 --> 01:26:51,629
Oh, couldn't
be better.

1496
01:26:51,704 --> 01:26:53,228
Well... wonderful.

1497
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:55,239
Tell him you've
been wondering

1498
01:26:55,307 --> 01:26:57,741
how they did on the
Gibraltar securities.

1499
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:59,243
I was just wondering,

1500
01:26:59,311 --> 01:27:02,246
how did you do on
the Gibraltar securities?

1501
01:27:02,314 --> 01:27:03,679
The Gibraltar
securities?

1502
01:27:03,749 --> 01:27:07,583
Well, it looks like we topped out
on that one, huh?

1503
01:27:07,653 --> 01:27:08,585
Sure did.

1504
01:27:08,654 --> 01:27:09,586
Sure did.

1505
01:27:09,655 --> 01:27:11,418
That was
a useful tip.

1506
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:12,718
Good old Randy.

1507
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:15,692
Good old Randy. Got a
good old head on his shoulders.

1508
01:27:15,761 --> 01:27:16,955
Her shoulders.

1509
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:18,496
Her shoulders.

1510
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:19,588
Randy.

1511
01:27:19,665 --> 01:27:22,065
So, what, um...

1512
01:27:22,134 --> 01:27:23,692
what brings you
here today?

1513
01:27:23,769 --> 01:27:25,202
You're closing
an account.

1514
01:27:25,271 --> 01:27:26,738
I'm closing an account.

1515
01:27:26,805 --> 01:27:29,501
Do you have
your account number?

1516
01:27:29,575 --> 01:27:30,507
Yes?

1517
01:27:30,576 --> 01:27:31,508
Yes.

1518
01:27:31,577 --> 01:27:32,509
Yes.

1519
01:27:32,578 --> 01:27:33,510
926-31043.

1520
01:27:33,579 --> 01:27:36,343
926-31043.
Is that right?

1521
01:27:36,415 --> 01:27:37,347
Yeah.

1522
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:38,713
Good.

1523
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:50,228
Well, Rita, it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

1524
01:27:50,296 --> 01:27:52,560
$4 million
from us today.

1525
01:27:52,631 --> 01:27:54,064
$4 million!

1526
01:27:54,133 --> 01:27:56,033
Say yes. Say yes!

1527
01:27:56,101 --> 01:27:57,033
Is that correct?

1528
01:27:57,102 --> 01:27:58,034
Yes.

1529
01:27:58,103 --> 01:28:00,594
Yes.
Yes, uh, yes!

1530
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:02,470
Yes, that's correct.

1531
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:04,133
Easy, easy.

1532
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:09,375
Yes. Well, how
would you like that?

1533
01:28:09,448 --> 01:28:11,473
10s and 20s.

1534
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:12,482
Pardon?

1535
01:28:12,551 --> 01:28:14,143
Tell him
a cashier's check.

1536
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,654
I think better
a cashier's check.

1537
01:28:16,722 --> 01:28:18,553
A cashier's check.
Fine.

1538
01:28:18,624 --> 01:28:20,558
Well, of course,
uh, you know,

1539
01:28:20,626 --> 01:28:22,560
we require identification
from everyone.

1540
01:28:22,628 --> 01:28:24,061
Oh, I see.

1541
01:28:24,129 --> 01:28:25,562
It's just
procedural.

1542
01:28:25,631 --> 01:28:27,292
Yes. I...

1543
01:28:37,076 --> 01:28:38,008
Thank you.

1544
01:28:38,077 --> 01:28:40,705
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll be right back.

1545
01:28:42,414 --> 01:28:43,813
$4 million!

1546
01:28:43,882 --> 01:28:44,814
Shh!

1547
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:52,724
Yeah, get me the
First Island Bank of Nassau.

1548
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:54,156
It's on the Rolodex.

1549
01:29:03,736 --> 01:29:08,173
Well, we have some, uh,
things for you to sign here.

1550
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,175
This officially
closes the account.

1551
01:29:11,243 --> 01:29:13,177
And, uh,
here you are.

1552
01:29:13,245 --> 01:29:14,678
Now sign Rita Miller.

1553
01:29:14,747 --> 01:29:15,907
Mm-hmm.

1554
01:29:17,249 --> 01:29:20,810
Rita Miller.
That's my name.

1555
01:29:20,886 --> 01:29:24,720
My name. Rita Miller.
My name.

1556
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:27,122
That's my name.

1557
01:29:27,192 --> 01:29:28,124
Molly, hi.

1558
01:29:28,193 --> 01:29:29,125
Hi.

1559
01:29:29,194 --> 01:29:32,425
Oda Mae,
I'll be right back.

1560
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:33,863
Just anywhere?

1561
01:29:33,932 --> 01:29:34,864
Right here.

1562
01:29:34,933 --> 01:29:35,865
Right.

1563
01:29:40,773 --> 01:29:41,933
Fine.

1564
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:44,373
The, uh, check.

1565
01:29:45,778 --> 01:29:47,712
This, uh...

1566
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,543
Here you are.

1567
01:29:49,615 --> 01:29:53,551
The person you need
is right down on the end.

1568
01:29:56,722 --> 01:30:00,658
Mama took the money that
she made in the oil wells,

1569
01:30:00,726 --> 01:30:03,160
and she sunk it
into gas pumps.

1570
01:30:03,228 --> 01:30:06,664
You know, how they have
at the gas station?

1571
01:30:06,732 --> 01:30:08,165
It's very,
very lucrative.

1572
01:30:08,233 --> 01:30:09,165
Oda Mae...

1573
01:30:09,234 --> 01:30:10,667
it really adds up.

1574
01:30:10,736 --> 01:30:12,260
Say goodbye.

1575
01:30:12,338 --> 01:30:14,772
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1576
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,536
Now, may I keep the pen?

1577
01:30:17,609 --> 01:30:20,703
Say good night to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

1578
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:21,711
Bye-bye.

1579
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,714
Why are you
rushing me?

1580
01:30:28,087 --> 01:30:29,918
What is wrong?

1581
01:30:31,256 --> 01:30:32,450
Oh.

1582
01:30:39,264 --> 01:30:40,697
Excuse me. Lyle?

1583
01:30:40,766 --> 01:30:42,165
Oh, yes. Uh...

1584
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:43,166
Molly.

1585
01:30:43,235 --> 01:30:44,964
Molly.

1586
01:30:45,037 --> 01:30:47,198
Jensen. The woman you were
just doing business with...

1587
01:30:47,272 --> 01:30:48,204
Yeah?

1588
01:30:48,273 --> 01:30:49,706
What did she want?

1589
01:30:49,775 --> 01:30:52,209
Did it have anything
to do with Sam?

1590
01:30:52,277 --> 01:30:54,575
Sam? Why, no. No.

1591
01:30:54,646 --> 01:30:57,080
That was Oda Mae Brown,
right?

1592
01:30:57,149 --> 01:30:59,083
No. Her name
was Rita Miller.

1593
01:30:59,151 --> 01:31:00,982
She was closing
an account.

1594
01:31:01,053 --> 01:31:02,350
Is there a problem?

1595
01:31:03,722 --> 01:31:07,180
No, I guess not.
Thank you.

1596
01:31:36,655 --> 01:31:39,180
Carl,
is something wrong?

1597
01:31:39,258 --> 01:31:41,692
Is somebody playing
with the computers?

1598
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,692
What?

1599
01:31:42,761 --> 01:31:44,695
One of my accounts
is closed.

1600
01:31:44,763 --> 01:31:46,196
Which account?
What's wrong?

1601
01:31:46,265 --> 01:31:48,699
You want me
to call someone?

1602
01:31:48,767 --> 01:31:50,200
No, it's OK.

1603
01:31:50,269 --> 01:31:52,294
I can do it.
I got it.

1604
01:31:55,507 --> 01:31:56,940
$4 million!

1605
01:31:57,009 --> 01:32:00,206
What am I going to
do with this money?

1606
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:02,213
I'm going
to buy the block.

1607
01:32:02,281 --> 01:32:06,217
I'm going to make my sister
go to a fat farm.

1608
01:32:06,285 --> 01:32:08,719
I'm going to
buy the building.

1609
01:32:08,787 --> 01:32:10,220
I've got an idea.

1610
01:32:10,289 --> 01:32:11,221
Please donate.

1611
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:14,014
Take the check
out of your purse.

1612
01:32:14,147 --> 01:32:17,514
Right. I should put it
where nobody can get it.

1613
01:32:17,584 --> 01:32:19,017
No. No. Endorse it.

1614
01:32:19,085 --> 01:32:22,020
If I endorse it,
then if I drop it,

1615
01:32:22,088 --> 01:32:23,521
somebody will get it.

1616
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:26,616
I never said you were
going to get the money.

1617
01:32:26,693 --> 01:32:29,526
It's blood money.
I was killed for this money.

1618
01:32:29,596 --> 01:32:31,029
Now,
endorse the check.

1619
01:32:31,097 --> 01:32:33,657
What are you going
to do with it?

1620
01:32:35,235 --> 01:32:36,702
Look over there.

1621
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:39,330
To your left.

1622
01:32:41,574 --> 01:32:44,873
You don't think
I'm giving this $4 million

1623
01:32:44,945 --> 01:32:46,879
to a bunch of nuns.

1624
01:32:46,947 --> 01:32:49,381
If you don't,
they'll track you down.

1625
01:32:49,449 --> 01:32:50,882
Get rid of it.

1626
01:32:50,951 --> 01:32:52,509
Sam,
you're killing me!

1627
01:32:52,585 --> 01:32:54,018
It's $4 million!

1628
01:32:54,087 --> 01:32:55,452
You'll go to heaven.

1629
01:32:55,522 --> 01:32:57,956
I don't want
to go to heaven.

1630
01:32:58,024 --> 01:33:00,356
I want to

Oda Mae. Oda Mae,
tell her...

1809
01:45:19,584 --> 01:45:24,021
tell her she's wearing the shirt
that I spilled the margarita on

1810
01:45:24,088 --> 01:45:27,023
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

1811
01:45:27,091 --> 01:45:30,527
Sam says you're wearing the shirt
he spilled the margarita on

1812
01:45:30,595 --> 01:45:33,530
and the earrings he
gave you for Christmas.

1813
01:45:39,203 --> 01:45:40,636
Don't you see?

1814
01:45:40,705 --> 01:45:43,139
I'm not a fake.
Not about this.

1815
01:45:48,012 --> 01:45:49,445
Give me a penny.

1816
01:45:49,514 --> 01:45:50,446
What?

1817
01:45:50,515 --> 01:45:53,109
Push a penny
under the door.

1818
01:45:53,184 --> 01:45:55,084
Push a penny
under the door?

1819
01:45:55,152 --> 01:45:56,084
Do it.

1820
01:46:33,891 --> 01:46:35,518
Tell her it's for luck.

1821
01:46:35,593 --> 01:46:37,527
Sam says
it's for luck.

1822
01:47:12,730 --> 01:47:15,665
We're between Green
and Mercer on Prince.

1823
01:47:15,733 --> 01:47:18,668
The gray building across
from the post office.

1824
01:47:18,736 --> 01:47:19,668
Thanks, Sergeant.

1825
01:47:19,737 --> 01:47:21,170
Please hurry.

1826
01:47:21,238 --> 01:47:22,671
We'll be waiting.

1827
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:25,174
All right. They're
on their way.

1828
01:47:25,242 --> 01:47:26,174
Good.

1829
01:47:27,745 --> 01:47:30,179
So, what do we
do now?

1830
01:47:30,247 --> 01:47:31,509
Just wait.

1831
01:47:41,592 --> 01:47:43,116
Is Sam here?

1832
01:47:44,929 --> 01:47:45,953
Sam?

1833
01:47:47,598 --> 01:47:49,088
I'm sitting
beside her.

1834
01:47:51,068 --> 01:47:52,626
He's sitting
right beside you.

1835
01:48:03,114 --> 01:48:05,048
Sam, can you feel me?

1836
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,217
With all my heart.

1837
01:48:09,487 --> 01:48:11,421
Says with all his heart.

1838
01:48:23,501 --> 01:48:24,934
I'd give anything

1839
01:48:25,002 --> 01:48:27,562
if I could just
touch you once more.

1840
01:48:30,641 --> 01:48:33,075
He says he wishes
he was alive again

1841
01:48:33,144 --> 01:48:35,112
so he could
touch you.

1842
01:48:38,749 --> 01:48:39,681
Me, too.

1843
01:48:56,767 --> 01:48:59,065
OK. OK. Look.

1844
01:48:59,136 --> 01:49:00,569
You can use me.

1845
01:49:02,106 --> 01:49:03,038
Use you?

1846
01:49:03,107 --> 01:49:04,904
You can use
my body.

1847
01:49:04,975 --> 01:49:06,499
Use your body?

1848
01:49:06,577 --> 01:49:09,171
Just do it quick
before I change my mind.

It's Carl.

1878

Fire escape.

You're just a liar.

Listen to me.
This woman's a thief.

1894

She's a con artist.

Why are you
doing this?

doing this?
