00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:57,456
High Septon: <i>May the Warrior</i>
<i>grant him courage</i>

6
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:03,229
May the Smith him
grant him strengths times.

7
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:05,130
that he might bear
this heavy burden

8
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:07,366
And may the Crone,

9
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,735
she that knows
the fate of all men,

10
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:12,371
show him the path
he must walk

11
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:15,841
and guide him through the dark places
that lie ahead.

12
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:19,178
In the light of the Seven,
I now proclaim Tommen

13
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:22,047
of the House Baratheon
First of His Name

14
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:24,850
King of the Andals
and the First Men

15
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:27,720
and Lord of
the Seven Kingdoms.

16
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:32,691
Long may he reign!

17
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,727
All:
Long may he reign!

18
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:37,429
( cheering )

19
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:46,472
Special day.

20
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:56,815
( crowd chatting )

21
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:07,159
Your Grace.

22
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:10,996
Your Grace.

23
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:37,122
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

24
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:54,740
Your Grace.

25
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:59,745
There he is.

26
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,981
Long may he reign.

27
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,816
Long may he reign.

28
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:10,089
He sits the throne
like he was born to it.

29
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:13,792
Yes. He wasn't,
though, was he?

30
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:16,362
No, he wasn't.

31
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,269
You still mourn
for Joffrey?

32
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:26,505
He was my husband.
My king.

33
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,674
He would have been
your nightmare.

34
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:34,913
Your Grace, I feel--

35
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:37,082
You knew exactly
what he was.

36
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:39,718
I did, too.

37
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:41,186
You never love
anything in the world

38
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:43,622
the way you love
your first child.

39
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,826
Doesn't matter
what they do.

40
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:53,265
And what he did,
it shocked me.

41
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:57,836
Do you think
I'm easily shocked?

42
00:04:57,904 --> 00:04:59,271
No.

43
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:02,708
The things he did
shocked me.

44
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:11,016
He's only a boy.

45
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,552
A good boy.
A decent boy.

46
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,454
He always has been.

47
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:18,657
<i>Who was the last</i>
<i>decent king, I wonder?</i>

48
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,612
He could be the first man
who sits on that throne

49
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:23,362
in 50 years
to actually deserve it.

50
00:05:24,798 --> 00:05:27,499
It would be some
consolation, wouldn't it?

51
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:30,569
For all the horror
that put him there.

52
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:37,810
He will need help...

53
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,180
if he's going
to rule well.

54
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:43,182
He has you.

55
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:45,818
A mother is not enough.

56
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:50,389
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

57
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:52,224
Oh.

58
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,326
After all
that's happened--

59
00:05:56,963 --> 00:06:00,432
it sounds strange,
I know, but I am--

60
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,868
I haven't even given
any thought to it,

61
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:04,670
what comes next.

62
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:07,906
It would be a great
honor, of course.

63
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:11,043
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

64
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:15,414
Yes, speak to
your father.

65
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:18,350
I'll speak to mine.

66
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:26,492
We may be faced with
an alarming number of weddings soon.

67
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:28,227
( chuckles )

68
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:30,295
I won't even know
what to call you.

69
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:33,098
Sister?

70
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:37,035
Or Mother?

71
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,571
Hmm.

72
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:43,142
King Joffrey Baratheon
is dead.

73
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,612
Murdered at his
own wedding.

74
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:50,015
Barristan: <i>And we have taken</i>
<i>the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.</i>

75
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:52,251
The Second Sons took
the Meereenese navy.

76
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:54,286
Who told you
to take the navy?

77
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,455
No one.

78
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:58,957
So why did you do it?

79
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,026
I heard
you liked ships.

80
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,632
How many ships?

81
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,933
93, Your Grace.

82
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,301
How many men
can they carry?

83
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:12,237
9,300,
not counting sailors.

84
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:14,206
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

85
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,074
The Lannisters have more.

86
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:18,477
Barristan: <i>They've been fighting</i>
<i>Joffrey's wars for years.</i>

87
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:20,345
They're tired,
dispersed.

88
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,648
<i>And now their king</i>
<i>is dead.</i>

89
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:26,285
8,000 Unsullied,
2,000 Second Sons

90
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,821
<i>sailing into</i>
<i>Blackwater Bay</i>

91
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:31,623
<i>and storming the gates</i>
<i>without warning.</i>

92
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:37,262
It's hard to say.
It could be enough.

93
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:40,833
But we're not fighting
to make you queen of King's Landing.

94
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,836
10,000 men
can't conquer Westeros.

95
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,537
The old houses
will flock to our queen

96
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,139
when she crosses
the Narrow Sea.

97
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,975
The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

98
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,110
as they always have.

99
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:56,415
There's other news.

100
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,217
From Yunkai.

101
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:01,620
Without the Unsullied
to enforce your rule,

102
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:04,523
<i>the Wise Masters have</i>
<i>retaken control of the city.</i>

103
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:07,593
<i>They've reenslaved</i>
<i>the freedmen who stayed behind</i>

104
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,761
and sworn to take
revenge against you.

105
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:13,165
And in Astapor,

106
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,934
the council you installed
to rule over the city

107
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:19,071
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

108
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:22,441
<i>who's declared himself</i>
<i>"His Imperial Majesty."</i>

109
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:26,378
Please leave me.

110
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,685
Not you, Jorah.

111
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,667
It appears my liberation
of Slaver's Bay

112
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,702
isn't going
quite as planned.

113
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:54,640
You could sail for Westeros

114
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:56,675
and leave it all behind.

115
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,377
A boy sits on
the Iron Throne.

116
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:01,613
A boy many believe
to be a bastard with no right to it.

117
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:04,483
They've never been
more vulnerable.

118
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:07,920
You counseled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

119
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:10,555
I didn't listen.

120
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,724
That all worked out well.

121
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,893
( chuckles )

122
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:22,367
How can I rule
seven kingdoms

123
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:25,103
if I can't control
Slaver's Bay?

124
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:29,174
Why should anyone
trust me?

125
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:31,810
Why should anyone
follow me?

126
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:33,312
<i>You're a Targaryen.</i>

127
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:35,380
You're the Mother
of Dragons.

128
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:39,785
I need to be
more than that.

129
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:50,963
I will not let those
I have freed slide back into chains.

130
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:53,966
I will not sail
for Westeros.

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,001
What, then?

132
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:59,905
I will do
what queens do.

133
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:05,143
I will rule.

134
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,547
Pull up your hood.

135
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:46,885
A memorable shade.

136
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,755
But how would
they know?

137
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:53,258
You know what kind
of stories poor men enjoy the most?

138
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,228
Ones about rich girls
they'll never meet.

139
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,101
Is this the only way
into the Eyrie?

140
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:05,303
The mountains
are impassable.

141
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:06,905
If you want to get
to the Eyrie,

142
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:08,807
you need to go through
the Bloody Gate.

143
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:12,310
It doesn't matter how
large your army is,

144
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:15,013
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

145
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:17,015
three men abreast

146
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,618
and get slaughtered
like goats.

147
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:22,621
The first Lords of the Vale
didn't have much,

148
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:24,222
but they had
these mountains

149
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:26,191
and they knew
how to use them.

150
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:28,960
And the fortress they built here has
never been overcome.

151
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:31,763
Not once in 1,000 years.

152
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:34,533
Know your strengths,
use them wisely,

153
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:37,969
and one man
can be worth 10,000.

154
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,910
Knight: Who would pass
the Bloody Gate?

155
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:48,213
Lord Petyr Baelish
and his niece Alayne.

156
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:53,952
Stand to.

157
00:11:53,986 --> 00:11:56,621
- Stand to!
- Stand to!

158
00:11:58,057 --> 00:11:59,424
Welcome back,
Lord Baelish.

159
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,929
<i>( gate clanking )</i>

160
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:30,021
<i>( door opens )</i>

161
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:31,857
Uncle Petyr!

162
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,361
Littlefinger:
<i>My lord.</i>

163
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:44,069
Oh.

164
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:48,340
I have brought you
a gift.

165
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:54,513
Lord Baelish.

166
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:55,243
My lady.

167
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:56,796
Look what Uncle Petyr
brought me.

168
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,918
A beautiful gift
for a beautiful boy.

169
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:02,654
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

170
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:04,189
My name is Al--

171
00:13:04,223 --> 00:13:06,691
Oh, do take down
that hood, child.

172
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,793
Don't you think know
who you are?

173
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:11,663
<i>You think</i>
<i>I'd let my intended</i>

174
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:13,665
leave the Eyrie
on urgent business

175
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:16,301
without knowing
what that business was?

176
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:21,640
I let him go so he could
bring you here to me.

177
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:27,679
My flesh and blood.

178
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,616
It's wonderful
to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

179
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:33,919
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

180
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:35,086
Of course.
I understand.

181
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,721
No one can know
you're here.

182
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,857
It would put us in a very
precarious position.

183
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:40,492
I would never
say a thing.

184
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:43,061
The Lannisters
want to destroy us.

185
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:45,030
They've been
trying for years.

186
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:47,098
<i>Now they know</i>
<i>what it feels like.</i>

187
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:48,505
Mummy said they killed
your mother

188
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,461
and they chopped
off your brother's head.

189
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:56,174
They did,
and my father's.

190
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,777
They killed my father, too,
with poison.

191
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:02,914
I wanted to make the little
Lannister baby man fly,

192
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:05,150
but Mother
said I couldn't.

193
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:06,985
Make him fly?

194
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,054
Through the Moon Door.

195
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:13,358
( giggles )

196
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:15,860
Lysa: <i>And on top of</i>
<i>everything else,</i>

197
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:18,430
they made you marry
that filthy troll.

198
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:20,665
They did.
They made us both.

199
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,067
Lord Tyrion
didn't want to.

200
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:24,002
Lysa: <i>I don't believe that</i>
<i>for a moment.</i>

201
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:26,071
Did he force himself
on you?

202
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:27,806
No.

203
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,374
- We never--
- Lysa: <i>Good.</i>

204
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:32,777
Robin, this is
your cousin Sansa.

205
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:35,013
But you're not to call
her Sansa in front of anyone

206
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:36,848
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

207
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:39,284
Sansa, this is
my son Robin.

208
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,454
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Robin.

209
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:44,856
Robin, show Sansa
to her chamber.

210
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,058
Take the back stairs.

211
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:51,997
Go.
We'll speak soon.

212
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,874
What took you so long?

213
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,877
Arranging for the ascension of
King Tommen I,

214
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:09,514
extricating Sansa,
getting her here alive.

215
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:10,397
She's here.

216
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:12,697
We've spent more than enough
time on her for one evening.

217
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:17,589
Let's get married tonight.

218
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:19,924
Ought we not...

219
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:23,028
inform the Lords of the Vale
about the ceremony?

220
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:24,963
There's only one
Lord of the Vale.

221
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:26,831
The others can all hang.

222
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,301
Lurking and simpering
on the stairs like buzzards

223
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:32,771
the moment my husband
died, trying to get their claws in me.

224
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,306
I do think that
we could wait until--

225
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,675
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

226
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:39,077
We had our wedding night
many years ago.

227
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,179
Or don't you remember?

228
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:44,182
Like it was yesterday.

229
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:48,386
What wife would do for you
the things I've done for you?

230
00:15:48,421 --> 00:15:51,289
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

231
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:54,159
When you gave me
those drops

232
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:56,594
and told me to pour
them into Jon's wine,

233
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:58,096
my husband's wine--

234
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,299
when you told me
to write a letter to Cat

235
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:03,668
telling her it was
the Lannisters--

236
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:06,504
( moans )

237
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,882
The deed is done.

238
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,585
Faded into nothing.

239
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:23,588
Only speaking of it
can make it real.

240
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,626
Tonight it is, then.

241
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:30,829
( laughs )

242
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:35,066
Let me bathe and dress
for the occasion.

243
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:38,536
Once I'm presentable,
I'll call on the septon immediately.

244
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:47,479
I'm warning you.

245
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:51,583
I'm going to scream
when my husband makes love to me.

246
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:54,819
I'm going
to scream so loud,

247
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:57,922
they'll hear me clear
across the Narrow Sea.

248
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:03,094
<i>( Lysa screaming )</i>

249
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:07,665
<i>( grunting, moaning )</i>

250
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:11,836
<i>( screaming )</i>

251
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:17,108
<i>( moaning, screaming</i>
<i>continues )</i>

252
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:26,217
When will the wedding
take place in your mind?

253
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:27,952
As soon as
decency permits.

254
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:31,990
After we've allowed Tommen th
 appropriate time to mourn his brother

255
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,759
and Margaery
to mourn her husband.

256
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:37,262
- A fortnight?
- That seems reasonable.

257
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:40,298
No jugglers,
no jousting dwarves,

258
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:43,635
no 77-course meals.

259
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:48,072
And your wedding
to Loras?

260
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,708
Shortly after Tommen's.

261
00:17:50,743 --> 00:17:53,111
- Shortly?
- A fortnight.

262
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,414
I know
you don't like them.

263
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,850
I didn't like
your husband.

264
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:01,085
Used to pat me
on the back a lot.

265
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
I didn't trust him.

266
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:04,756
We had that in common.

267
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,393
You don't need to make
formal alliances with people you trust.

268
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:11,062
Then whom can we trust?

269
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:14,866
Ourselves alone.

270
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:19,370
The Tyrells

271
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:22,040
are our only
true rivals

272
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:23,775
in terms of resources

273
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:27,045
and we need them
on our side.

274
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,481
Robert wasn't
particularly rich.

275
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:32,750
Robert had me
funding him.

276
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:36,020
Wars swallow gold
like a pit in the earth.

277
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:39,424
I suppose that explains
why we did so well in the last one.

278
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:43,495
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

279
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:44,662
Haven't a clue.

280
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:46,397
Go on, your best guess.

281
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:49,200
Pounds, tons, ounces?

282
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:51,703
Doesn't matter.
The answer is the same.

283
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,405
That can't be.

284
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,475
Our last working mine
ran dry three years ago.

285
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,612
Then how do we
pay for anything?

286
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:03,047
The crown owes
the Iron Bank of Braavos

287
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,716
a tremendous amount
of money.

288
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,351
How much?

289
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:09,521
A tremendous amount.

290
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,725
There must be someone
at the Iron Bank

291
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,194
you can speak to,
come to some arrangement.

292
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:17,996
The Iron Bank
is the Iron Bank.

293
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,631
There is no someone.

294
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:22,267
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

295
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:24,369
And a temple
is comprised of stones.

296
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:27,338
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

297
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:32,010
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

298
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:35,647
That's what the Iron Bank is--
a temple.

299
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:38,883
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

300
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,453
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

301
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:45,189
You can't sway them
with excuses.

302
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:48,860
If you owe them money
and you don't want to crumble yourself,

303
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:51,329
you pay it back.

304
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:53,164
Vesting the Tyrells
in the own

305
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:54,999
will help a great deal
in this respect.

306
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:58,836
It's for the good of the family,
I understand that.

307
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:04,509
I'm not sure
my brothers do.

308
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,849
I know you're building
a strong case against Tyrion.

309
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:15,053
<i>And as a mother,</i>
<i>that is your right.</i>

310
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:19,591
But as a judge, I cannot discuss
the trial with you.

311
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,759
I respect that.

312
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:26,431
We don't need
to discuss it.

313
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:32,403
The Lannister legacy
is the only thing that matters.

314
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:35,607
You've started wars
to protect this family.

315
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:37,976
Turned your back
on Jaime

316
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,045
for refusing
to contribute to its future.

317
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,315
What does Tyrion deserve

318
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,918
for lighting
that future on fire?

319
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:58,863
Arya:
<i>Joffrey.</i>

320
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:01,065
Cersei.

321
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,067
Walder Frey.

322
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:05,336
Meryn Trant.

323
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:08,172
<i>Tywin Lannister.</i>

324
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:10,308
The Red Woman.

325
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:12,710
Beric Dondarrion.

326
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:15,813
<i>Thoros of Myr.</i>

327
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:17,782
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

328
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:19,651
The Mountain.

329
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:21,619
Would you shut up?

330
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:25,056
I can't sleep
until I say the names.

331
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,726
The names of every
fucking person in Westeros?

332
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:31,596
Only the ones
I'm going to kill.

333
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,431
( chuckles )

334
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:36,034
Hate's as good a thing
as any to keep a person going.

335
00:21:36,068 --> 00:21:38,603
Better than most.

336
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:42,140
We come across my brother,

337
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:45,643
maybe we can both cross
a name off our list.

338
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:51,449
If he were here right now,
what would you do?

339
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:01,359
I'd tell him
to shut the fuck up

340
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:03,561
so I can get some sleep.

341
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,500
Go on,
get it over with,

342
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:12,136
your list of doomed men.

343
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:16,274
I'm almost done.

344
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:18,443
Only one name left.

345
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:21,179
Go on.

346
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:31,055
The Hound.

347
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,363
Thank you.

348
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:41,466
Your mother always
had a sweet tooth, you know?

349
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,034
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

350
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:46,270
At suppertime, she would go straight
for honey cakes,

351
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:47,972
candied almonds,
custard.

352
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:49,674
Anything sweet.

353
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,242
Eventually,
your grandfather

354
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:53,845
had to assign a septa
to watch her at meals.

355
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:56,447
Cat was the firstborn
daughter after all.

356
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:58,449
It was important
that she remain desirable

357
00:22:58,484 --> 00:23:00,118
so Father could arrange
a good match for her

358
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:02,820
and she was starting
to get fat.

359
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:06,290
My mother fat?

360
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:10,495
She never let me
have my pudding

361
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:12,296
until I'd finished
all my proper food.

362
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:15,700
This is before she married your father
and moved to the North.

363
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:19,337
By the time you were born,
your father's austerity had become hers.

364
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:22,406
Marriage changes people.

365
00:23:25,077 --> 00:23:27,145
I didn't mean
for you to stop.

366
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,946
Go on, enjoy them.

367
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:35,153
How do you like them?

368
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:37,188
They're delicious.

369
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:42,560
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

370
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:44,228
Oh, gods, no.

371
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:47,398
Petyr had three crates
brought all the way from King's Landing.

372
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:49,333
He knew you liked
lemon cakes.

373
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:51,135
He's so kind.

374
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,171
He really
cares for you.

375
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:56,107
Think where you'd
be without him.

376
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:58,476
In their clutches
and tried for murder.

377
00:23:59,678 --> 00:24:02,547
Yes.
I'm very lucky.

378
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:04,182
He feels
responsible for you.

379
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:05,783
Oh, I know he does.
I'm so grateful.

380
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:07,685
Why?

381
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:10,488
Why does he feel
responsible for you?

382
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:13,424
Well, I'm half Tully.

383
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,027
- He loved your family so much.
- Loved your mother.

384
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:18,029
- No.
- That's what you wanted to say.

385
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:19,463
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
He's married to you.

386
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:21,599
Your mother never
loved him. Never.

387
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:24,569
Cat always went straight
for the sweetest thing.

388
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:27,638
The most obvious thing.
Your Uncle Brandon.

389
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:30,641
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

390
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:33,211
He almost killed Petyr
in a duel.

391
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:35,446
And your mother
loved him anyway.

392
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,116
And now Petyr is risking
his life to save you,

393
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:41,853
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him

394
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:44,922
no more than those
whores in his brothels.

395
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:47,892
- Has he told you about them?
- No.

396
00:24:47,926 --> 00:24:50,728
He hasn't told you about the vile things
they do with their bodies?

397
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:52,930
The vile things they let
him do with their bodies?

398
00:24:52,965 --> 00:24:55,166
- <i>No, never.</i>
- Are you pregnant?

399
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:59,604
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never--

400
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:01,505
I wasn't asking
about Tyrion.

401
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,608
What have you let Petyr
do with your body?

402
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:06,177
- Aunt Lysa, no, I--
- Your young, pretty body.

403
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:08,880
- Nothing. I'm a virgin.
- Don't lie to me.

404
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:12,216
You're hurting me.

405
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:13,751
I'll know if you lie.

406
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:16,587
I'm a virgin,
I swear it.

407
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:18,389
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

408
00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:20,424
All he says
is that I'm stupid.

409
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:22,426
I'm a stupid little girl
with stupid dreams

410
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:24,328
who never learns
and I'm a terrible liar,

411
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:25,684
so I should always
tell the truth.

412
00:25:25,697 --> 00:25:27,965
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

413
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,468
- Not once, not ever.
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

414
00:25:32,104 --> 00:25:34,105
It's all right.

415
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:36,240
It will all
be all right.

416
00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:37,575
You'll be a widow soon.

417
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:40,011
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

418
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:42,280
and you'll be free
to marry Robin.

419
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:44,415
You'll be the Lady
of the Vale.

420
00:25:44,449 --> 00:25:46,851
Hmm.

421
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:54,892
( horse whinnies )

422
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:02,033
( grunting )

423
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,142
Didn't they teach you
how to ride a horse?

424
00:26:11,176 --> 00:26:14,679
Yes, my lady,
when I was young.

425
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:16,714
There wasn't much call for it with
Lord Tyrion, though.

426
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:19,350
He preferred litters.

427
00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:22,086
Perhaps you should
have stayed with him.

428
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:30,394
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

429
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:33,864
It could take weeks to get to the Wall,
depending on the weather.

430
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,566
That's a long way off.

431
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,569
Well, Lady Sansa's
brother's at Castle Black.

432
00:26:38,603 --> 00:26:41,172
If I were her,
that's where I'd go.

433
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:43,741
Feel free to stop
at any point.

434
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:46,677
Never, my lady.
I'm your squire.

435
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:49,246
I've made it this far in
the world without a squire.

436
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:50,715
I don't see why
I need one now.

437
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:52,483
All knights have
squires, my lady.

438
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:53,851
<i>I'm not a knight.</i>

439
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:57,021
And I'm not a slaver, either.
I don't own you.

440
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:59,156
I swore an oath,
my lady.

441
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:01,726
I am releasing you
from that oath.

442
00:27:04,763 --> 00:27:06,964
That means
you could leave.

443
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,766
I know.

444
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,302
What do you think
will happen if you leave?

445
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:15,172
They'll say I wasn't
a very good squire.

446
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:18,175
( horse nickers )

447
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,344
( whinnies )

448
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:13,030
- The hell you doing?
- Practicing.

449
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:16,300
- What, ways to die?
- No one's going to kill me.

450
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:18,269
They will if you nance
around like that.

451
00:28:18,303 --> 00:28:20,771
That's no way to fight.

452
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:23,774
It's not fighting.
It's water dancing.

453
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,876
Dancing?

454
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:28,145
Maybe you ought
to put on a dress.

455
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:31,949
Who taught you
that shite?

456
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:34,552
The greatest swordsman
who ever lived.

457
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:40,458
Syrio Forel, the First Sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

458
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:41,892
Braavos.
( scoffs )

459
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:43,761
Greasy-haired little
bastard, I bet.

460
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:45,162
They all are.

461
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:46,764
What do you know
about anything?

462
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:48,966
I bet his hair is greasier
than Joffrey's cunt.

463
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,001
- It was not.
- Was? He dead?

464
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:51,969
- Yes.
- How?

465
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:53,871
- He was killed.
- Who by?

466
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:55,706
Meryn Trant.
That's why Ser Meryn--

467
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,475
Meryn Trant?

468
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:00,678
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

469
00:29:00,712 --> 00:29:02,680
- He was outnumbered.
- Any boy whore with a sword

470
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:04,615
could beat three
Meryn Trants.

471
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:07,084
Syrio didn't have a sword.
Or armor. Just a stick.

472
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,286
The greatest swordsman
who ever lived didn't have a sword?

473
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:11,789
( laughs )

474
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:13,624
All right.
You have a sword.

475
00:29:13,658 --> 00:29:15,092
Let's see
what he taught you.

476
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:17,995
Go on, do it for
your Braavosi friend.

477
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:21,232
Dead like all the rest
of your friends.

478
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,668
( grunts )

479
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:35,980
Your friend's dead
and Meryn Trant's not

480
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:37,748
'cause Trant had armor

481
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:40,117
and a big fucking sword.

482
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:44,655
( scoffs )

483
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:56,734
<i>( bird calling )</i>

484
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:12,283
Your Grace.

485
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:14,985
Prince Oberyn.
Writing letters?

486
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,788
A poem, actually.

487
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:21,058
May I show you
the gardens?

488
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:24,161
I couldn't very well
refuse a royal escort.

489
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:26,363
No, you couldn't.

490
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,868
I didn't realize
you were a poet.

491
00:30:30,902 --> 00:30:33,537
Not a very good one.

492
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:35,639
For your paramour?

493
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:38,008
For one of my daughters.

494
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:40,477
You have several,
don't you?

495
00:30:40,512 --> 00:30:41,845
Eight.

496
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,581
Eight?

497
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:45,849
Eight daughters?

498
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:47,751
The fifth is difficult.

499
00:30:47,786 --> 00:30:50,387
I named her after
my sister Elia.

500
00:30:50,422 --> 00:30:52,056
Beautiful name.

501
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,991
Yes.

502
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:57,094
But I can't say it
without turning sad.

503
00:30:57,128 --> 00:31:00,030
And after I turn sad,

504
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,233
I grow angry.

505
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:05,002
Perhaps that's why
she's difficult.

506
00:31:05,036 --> 00:31:08,138
The gods love
their stupid jokes, don't they?

507
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:10,441
Which joke is that?

508
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:12,843
You're a prince of Dorne.

509
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:15,079
A legendary fighter.

510
00:31:15,146 --> 00:31:17,314
A brilliant man feared
throughout Westeros.

511
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:20,284
But you could not
save your sister.

512
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:23,721
I'm a Lannister.
Queen for 19 years.

513
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:25,889
Daughter of the most
powerful man alive.

514
00:31:25,924 --> 00:31:28,592
But I could not
save my son.

515
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:31,061
What good is power

516
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:34,098
if you cannot protect
the ones you love?

517
00:31:34,132 --> 00:31:35,933
We can avenge them.

518
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:38,435
Yes, we can avenge them.

519
00:31:40,171 --> 00:31:42,673
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

520
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:45,909
I know he did.

521
00:31:47,646 --> 00:31:50,414
We will have a trial and we will
learn the truth.

522
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:52,816
We'll have a trial,
anyway.

523
00:31:56,988 --> 00:32:00,457
I haven't seen
my daughter in over a year.

524
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:02,459
The last time I saw her,

525
00:32:02,494 --> 00:32:05,796
she was swimming with two of my girls
in the Water Gardens.

526
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,632
Laughing in the sun.

527
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:12,636
I want to believe that.

528
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:15,506
I want to believe
she's happy.

529
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,108
You have my word.

530
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:21,011
We don't hurt
little girls in Dorne.

531
00:32:22,414 --> 00:32:25,449
Everywhere in the world,
they hurt little girls.

532
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:36,627
Would you bring her
a gift for me?

533
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,297
<i>I wasn't there</i>
<i>for her name day.</i>

534
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:42,666
I don't know when
I'll see her again.

535
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:45,135
Anything at all.

536
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:48,439
The best shipwrights
in King's Landing

537
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:50,607
have been working
on it for months.

538
00:32:50,642 --> 00:32:54,078
Myrcella loves
the open water.

539
00:32:54,112 --> 00:32:58,248
Oberyn: <i>I will have it sailed</i>
<i>down to Sunspear for her.</i>

540
00:32:59,718 --> 00:33:01,618
Please tell her...

541
00:33:04,022 --> 00:33:06,390
her mother misses her
very much.

542
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:17,835
Podrick:
Oh, no, no, no.

543
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:19,803
No, no, no, no.

544
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:22,272
Hells.

545
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:27,444
Gods.

546
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,416
Did you remove the skin?

547
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:35,986
No, my lady.

548
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,988
Have you ever cooked
a rabbit before?

549
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:40,391
No, my lady.

550
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:44,194
Did you ever cook
anything for Lord Tyrion?

551
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:47,164
No, my lady.

552
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:48,932
That was the cooks.

553
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:51,802
( groans )

554
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:07,651
What are you doing?

555
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,920
I'm helping you
with your armor.

556
00:34:09,954 --> 00:34:11,807
I've been removing my own armor
for quite some time,

557
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:12,956
thank you very much.

558
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:33,644
What exactly did you do
for Lord Tyrion?

559
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:35,152
I brought him his meals

560
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:37,156
and cleared his table
when he was finished.

561
00:34:37,248 --> 00:34:39,550
I kept his clothing
and linens clean.

562
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:42,519
Carried his messages
and returned the replies.

563
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:46,023
Mostly I poured wine.

564
00:34:46,057 --> 00:34:48,058
Oh.

565
00:34:48,092 --> 00:34:49,960
Whilst in
Lord Tyrion's service,

566
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:53,363
did you ever do anything
remotely related to combat?

567
00:34:57,235 --> 00:34:59,903
I killed a man.

568
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,108
Who?

569
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:07,177
A Kingsguard.

570
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:14,451
He tried to kill
Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

571
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:20,290
How did you
kill a Kingsguard?

572
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,862
I pushed a spear
through the back of his head.

573
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,809
Bloody ridiculous.

574
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:44,147
Help me with
these straps.

575
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:57,427
- ( woman whimpering )
- ( Rast laughing )

576
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:05,135
Rast: Hey.

577
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:07,170
Hey, get up.

578
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:11,141
- Get up.
- ( sobbing )

579
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:19,049
Man: <i>That's it lad,</i>
<i>put it inside.</i>

580
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:21,051
<i>Get the fire going again.</i>
<i>We're all freezing.</i>

581
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:23,520
Aye. What we need
is a girl there.

582
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:25,722
I've got to
have a piss.

583
00:36:32,163 --> 00:36:34,531
<i>( pigs grunting )</i>

584
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:37,167
<i>( women whimpering )</i>

585
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,604
Now keep quiet.

586
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:53,183
( rattles )

587
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:07,264
( lantern squeaking )

588
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:21,378
( coughs )

589
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:23,413
You need water.

590
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:25,148
It doesn't matter.

591
00:37:25,183 --> 00:37:28,185
Of course it matters.

592
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:33,457
You mustn't let
anything stop you.

593
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:38,095
They already have
stopped me.

594
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:40,731
No.

595
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,302
You're not here.

596
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:53,276
You're far from here.

597
00:37:55,213 --> 00:37:57,481
What does that mean?

598
00:37:57,515 --> 00:38:00,250
<i>( crows cawing )</i>

599
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:05,555
At the hill.

600
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,225
A great weirwood tree.

601
00:38:09,761 --> 00:38:13,196
You've seen it, too.

602
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:17,401
Meera and I,
even Hodor,

603
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:20,070
we're only here
to guide you.

604
00:38:23,174 --> 00:38:25,642
He's waiting for you.

605
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,746
We have to find it.

606
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:33,417
You have to make it.

607
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:35,052
We will.

608
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,589
This-- this isn't
the end.

609
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,859
Not for you.

610
00:38:42,894 --> 00:38:45,729
Not yet.

611
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:48,231
Meera:
<i>How...</i>

612
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:50,967
will we know
the end?

613
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,115
You'll know.

614
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:10,487
<i>( footsteps )</i>

615
00:39:17,595 --> 00:39:20,063
Locke:
<i>Brothers.</i>

616
00:39:20,098 --> 00:39:22,799
You do move quiet.

617
00:39:24,936 --> 00:39:27,170
- How many?
- 11 men.

618
00:39:27,205 --> 00:39:29,072
Most of them
already drunk.

619
00:39:29,107 --> 00:39:30,505
No guards posted.

620
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,487
They don't seem to have
a care in the world.

621
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,046
We'll carve them up
like walnut pie.

622
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,548
Karl was a top paid
cutthroat in Flea Bottom.

623
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,784
I've seen what
he can do with a knife.

624
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:42,586
Have you seen what
I can do with a knife?

625
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,122
( chuckles )
Not yet.

626
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:49,353
There's a hut on
the west side of the keep.

627
00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:50,861
We should steer clear of it.

628
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:52,062
Why?

629
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:55,198
They've got some hounds
chained up inside.

630
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:58,335
Closer we can get without
the dogs sniffing us, the better.

631
00:39:59,871 --> 00:40:02,172
New moon tonight.

632
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,543
( sighs )
Get some rest.

633
00:40:06,577 --> 00:40:09,212
We move at sundown.

634
00:40:11,215 --> 00:40:13,483
I've always liked
a girl with curls.

635
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:15,652
A touch of class.

636
00:40:15,686 --> 00:40:18,188
You take
whatever's left.

637
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,793
Get her up.

638
00:40:24,996 --> 00:40:26,163
Bran:
<i>Stop.</i>

639
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:27,831
<i>Stop.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

640
00:40:27,865 --> 00:40:30,100
Hodor:
<i>Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.</i>

641
00:40:30,134 --> 00:40:32,936
Stop.
Stop!

642
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:37,340
- Hodor: <i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>
- Bran: <i>Stop!</i>

643
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:39,943
- Please.
- <i>Hodor.</i>

644
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:43,213
- Please, get off her!
- Hodor. Hodor.

645
00:40:43,247 --> 00:40:45,582
Please!
Please, leave her alone!

646
00:40:48,352 --> 00:40:50,520
Bran:
<i>Please, stop. Stop.</i>

647
00:40:50,555 --> 00:40:52,488
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Leave her alone!</i>

648
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:53,857
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

649
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:55,358
- <i>No!</i>
- Shh.

650
00:40:55,393 --> 00:40:58,428
- Shh, shh, shh.
- ( gasping )

651
00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:01,231
- Shh.
- ( whimpering )

652
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:07,237
You've got pretty hair,
don't you?

653
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,242
Now what is a pretty little
highborn girl like you

654
00:41:12,276 --> 00:41:15,212
doing out here in
the deep, dark woods, eh?

655
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:20,650
You left your daddy's
castle looking for trouble, didn't you?

656
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:22,919
No dresses for you.

657
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:26,423
You like it rough,
don't you?

658
00:41:26,457 --> 00:41:29,793
You like it in
the gutter, don't you?

659
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:33,163
If you let my sister go,
I can help you.

660
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:36,533
You can help me?

661
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:38,969
I can.

662
00:41:40,271 --> 00:41:42,606
And how you
gonna do that?

663
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:49,212
I have the sight.
I can see things.

664
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:51,147
That's very helpful.

665
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:53,383
Things that haven't
happened yet.

666
00:41:57,288 --> 00:41:59,256
What a fine thing.

667
00:42:02,827 --> 00:42:04,194
A fine thing.

668
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,032
Have you seen
what I'm gonna do to your sister?

669
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:15,572
Have you seen what they're going
to do to your sister?

670
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:19,776
No.

671
00:42:21,712 --> 00:42:24,414
Don't close your eyes.

672
00:42:29,387 --> 00:42:32,355
I saw you die tonight.

673
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:36,693
I saw your body burn.

674
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:41,164
I saw the snow fall
and bury your bones.

675
00:42:44,268 --> 00:42:46,603
Man:
<i>To arms!</i>

676
00:42:46,637 --> 00:42:49,706
They're here,
the Night's Watch.

677
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,075
( men shouting )

678
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:59,649
( woman screaming )

679
00:43:13,664 --> 00:43:15,365
( screams )

680
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,204
Rescue party
is here, lads.

681
00:43:21,238 --> 00:43:22,772
Lady.

682
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,442
- Is Jon with you?
- Aye.

683
00:43:25,476 --> 00:43:28,111
I'll take you to him.

684
00:43:30,548 --> 00:43:33,183
You're Brandon Stark?

685
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:39,956
- ( gasps )
- Hodor. Hodor.

686
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:42,659
The little crippled lord.
We're going for a ride, boy.

687
00:43:42,693 --> 00:43:44,494
Jon! Jon!

688
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:48,932
Keep talking and I'll cut your
friends' throats.

689
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:51,835
Starting with the idiot.
Do you hear?

690
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:54,004
Do you hear?

691
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,651
Hodor:
<i>Hodor! Hodor!</i>

692
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:12,489
Hodor. Hodor.

693
00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:14,257
Hodor. Hodor.

694
00:44:16,927 --> 00:44:19,496
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>
<i>Hodor.</i>

695
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:28,805
( grunting )

696
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:50,960
( choking )

697
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:59,235
( neck cracks )

698
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,307
Hodor.

699
00:45:05,476 --> 00:45:09,045
<i>Hodor, get his knife.</i>
<i>Cut me loose.</i>

700
00:45:10,114 --> 00:45:13,249
- <i>Hodor, get his knife.</i>
- Hodor.

701
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:16,753
Cut me loose, Hodor.

702
00:45:22,726 --> 00:45:25,895
Jojen and Meera,
free them.

703
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,630
<i>Go!</i>

704
00:45:27,665 --> 00:45:30,366
- <i>( swords clanking )</i>
- <i>( men shouting )</i>

705
00:45:30,401 --> 00:45:32,102
Jon.

706
00:45:41,912 --> 00:45:43,847
Jon!

707
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:47,484
If he sees you,
he won't let you go north.

708
00:45:47,518 --> 00:45:50,553
- He's my brother.
- And wants to protect you.

709
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:53,423
<i>He'll take you back</i>
<i>to Castle Black.</i>

710
00:45:54,992 --> 00:45:57,060
<i>You have to decide.</i>

711
00:45:57,094 --> 00:45:59,095
Do you want to find
the three-eyed raven?

712
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:15,411
- Bran: Hodor.
- Hodor: Hodor.

713
00:46:15,446 --> 00:46:17,647
We need to free Summer.

714
00:46:17,681 --> 00:46:20,316
And we need to go.

715
00:46:25,322 --> 00:46:27,590
- ( shouts )
- ( groans )

716
00:46:34,865 --> 00:46:36,866
Lord Snow.

717
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:39,469
Are you bringing me
back for trial?

718
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:44,240
We had
a good thing here.

719
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:47,143
We were free men.

720
00:46:47,178 --> 00:46:49,312
You'll never be free.

721
00:46:49,346 --> 00:46:51,748
You'll never know
what that's like.

722
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:15,738
You learn how to fight
in a castle?

723
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:21,077
( groans )

724
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:23,046
Some old man
teach you how to stand,

725
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,447
how to parry?

726
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:26,249
( groans )

727
00:47:28,652 --> 00:47:30,687
How to fight
with honor?

728
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:45,568
You know what's
wrong with honor?

729
00:47:45,603 --> 00:47:47,570
( spits )

730
00:47:51,642 --> 00:47:54,244
( grunts )

731
00:47:56,247 --> 00:47:58,081
You.

732
00:48:07,558 --> 00:48:09,759
( gurgling )

733
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:21,804
( panting )

734
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,048
Are you all right?

735
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:36,586
Come with me.

736
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,755
Come on.

737
00:48:42,893 --> 00:48:45,595
( grunts )

738
00:48:55,439 --> 00:48:57,640
We lost
four brothers?

739
00:48:57,675 --> 00:48:59,676
Five.

740
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:05,481
What the seven hells
could do that to a man?

741
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:09,952
I count 10
dead mutineers.

742
00:49:09,987 --> 00:49:13,222
Locke said there
were 11 of them.

743
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,125
Where's Rast?

744
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,761
<i>( wind howling )</i>

745
00:49:21,832 --> 00:49:24,801
( panting )

746
00:49:41,685 --> 00:49:44,487
<i>( crows cawing )</i>

747
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:53,830
- ( roaring )
- ( Rast screams )

748
00:50:00,504 --> 00:50:02,739
- Here's another.
- Jon.

749
00:50:05,743 --> 00:50:07,677
Jon:
<i>Where in seven hells?</i>

750
00:50:08,879 --> 00:50:10,213
Come here.

751
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,785
( whining )

752
00:50:17,488 --> 00:50:19,756
I missed you, boy.

753
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,528
What should we do
with this lot?

754
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:32,702
It's not safe for you
here on your own.

755
00:50:32,736 --> 00:50:35,338
Mance Rayder has an army
heading this way

756
00:50:35,372 --> 00:50:37,407
and there's worse out
there than Mance.

757
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,378
Come with us
to Castle Black.

758
00:50:42,413 --> 00:50:45,815
We can find you work.
Keep you safe.

759
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:48,084
Meaning all respect,
Ser Crow,

760
00:50:48,118 --> 00:50:51,687
Craster beat us
and worse.

761
00:50:51,722 --> 00:50:55,191
Your brother crows
beat us and worse.

762
00:50:55,225 --> 00:50:57,393
We'll find our own way.

763
00:50:57,428 --> 00:50:58,995
You want to stay here

764
00:50:59,029 --> 00:51:01,164
in Craster's Keep?

765
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:05,334
( spits )

766
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:07,336
Burn it to the ground

767
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:10,273
and all the dead with it.
