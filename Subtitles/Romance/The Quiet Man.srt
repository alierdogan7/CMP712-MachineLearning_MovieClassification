1
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:57,715
Well, then... Urrmm, now.

2
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,549
I'll begin at the beginnin'.

3
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:03,753
A fine, soft day in the spring it was

4
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:07,792
when the train pulled into Castletown,
three hours late as usual,

5
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,163
and himself got out.

6
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:14,267
He didn't have the look
of an American tourist at all about him,

7
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:18,473
not a camera on him and, what was worst,
not even a fishing-rod.

8
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:22,078
Castletown?

9
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:32,123
- Castletown?
- Could you tell me the way to Inisfree?

10
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:36,029
Inisfree? Aw, five miles and maybe a half more.

11
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:38,330
- Do you see that road over there?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:43,171
Don't take that one, it'll do you no good.
Now, the best road to Inisfree, and many...

13
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:48,078
Oh, Inisfree you want. Be savin' your breath,
let me direct the gentleman.

14
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:49,777
Happen to know the way to Knoghenor?

15
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:53,883
If you knew the way there,
would he be asking the way to Inisfree?

16
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,620
There's many knows Knoghenor
that doesn't know Inisfree.

17
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,092
If you'd take the time to study
your country's history, Mr Maloney...

18
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,196
- ... you'd be the first to admit it.
- Don't send the poor man there.

19
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:08,603
The fishing is finished there entirely.
Tell me, Yank, what is it that you're after?

20
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:12,405
- Is it trout or salmon?
- All I want is to get to Inisfree.

21
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:15,743
Ah, now you're talking sense.
The best fishing in the country.

22
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:19,449
- True.
- Trout as long as your arm.

23
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:24,255
And salmon! The last one I got,
I expected Jonah to pop out of his mouth.

24
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:27,125
Ah, Inisfree. I'd bring you there myself,

25
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:29,295
only I got to drive the train.

26
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:33,400
Hey, was I tellin' you about that trout
I got two summers before last?

27
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:36,269
- At Inisfree?
- Not at all!

28
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:38,539
At Ballygar, over the other end of the country.

29
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,379
My sister's third young one is living at Inisfree,

30
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,184
and she'd be only too happy
to show you the road.

31
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:51,422
- No, no, if she was here.
- It's Inisfree the man wants to go to.

32
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:55,962
- You see that signpost over there?
- What do you know...

33
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:13,249
Inisfree, this way.

34
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:41,852
I wonder, now, why a man would go to Inisfree.

35
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:10,022
- Six foot six?
- Four and a half.

36
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:31,181
- Cincinnati?
- No, Pittsburgh.

37
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,551
Pi..Pitss...

38
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:54,009
Don't you remember, Seaneen, and how it was.

39
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:59,885
The road led up past the chapel,
and it wound, and it wound,

40
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:04,454
and there was the field where
Dan Tobin's bull chased you.

41
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:09,862
It was a lovely little house, Seaneen,
and the roses.!

42
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:15,836
Your father used to tease me about them,
but he was that proud of them, too.

43
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:22,145
That's nothin' but a wee humble cottage.

44
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:43,738
That little place across the brook,
that humble cottage. Who owns it now?

45
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:46,442
The widow Tillane. Not that she lives there.

46
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:48,842
- You think she'd sell it?
- I doubt it.

47
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,746
Don't bet on it 'cause I'm buyin' it.

48
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,386
Why... why would a Yankee from Pittsburgh
want to buy it?

49
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,658
I'll tell you why, Michaleen Oge Flynn,
young small Michael Flynn,

50
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:03,229
who used to wipe my runny nose
when I was kid.

51
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:07,802
Because I'm Sean Thornton,
and I was born in that little cottage.

52
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:12,175
And I've come home, and home I'm gonna stay.

53
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:16,444
Does that answer your questions
once and for all, you nosy little man?

54
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:20,917
Seaneen Thornton... The...

55
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:23,454
And look at you now.

56
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:26,892
What do they feed you,
all you men who are in Pittsburgh?

57
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:33,166
Steel, and pig-iron furnaces so hot
a man forgets his fear of hell.

58
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:37,904
When you're hard enough,
tough enough... other things.

59
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:42,377
Other things, Michaleen.

60
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:04,605
Now then, here comes myself,
that's me there, walking.

61
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:11,347
That tall, saintly-looking man.
Peter Lonergan, parish priest.

62
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:15,118
Good day, Father. Sean, this is Father Lonergan.

63
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:20,159
Father, would you believe it?
This is Sean Thornton,

64
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:23,564
born right here in Inisfree, home from America.

65
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:26,699
- Hello, Father.
- Ah, yes.

66
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,502
I knew your people, Sean.

67
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:35,845
Your grandfather...
He died in Australia, in a penal colony.

68
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:39,482
And your father, he was a good man too.

69
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:43,221
Bad accident, that. And your mother?

70
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:46,392
She's dead. America, when I was twelve.

71
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:52,498
I'll remember her in the mass tomorrow.
You'll be there, seven o'clock.

72
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,600
- Sure, I will.
- Good.

73
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,906
Sean, I'd like to have a little word
with Michaleen here.

74
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:00,742
- Sure thing, Father.
- It'll only take a minute.

75
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:04,147
- It's a little matter...
- Take your time. I'll be up ahead.

76
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,762
(MICHALEEN): Sean!

77
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:21,744
Hey, is that real?. She couldn't be.

78
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:27,416
Uh, nonsense, man. It's only a mirage
brought on by your terrible thirst.

79
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:30,353
Come up, Napoleon.

80
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:27,926
Over here we pronounce it "Co-han".

81
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:39,715
Good morning.

82
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:06,115
None of that now.
It's a bold, sinful man you are, Sean Thornton.

83
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:09,921
Who told you to playing patty fingers
in the Holy Water?

84
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,324
- Just being polite, that's all.
- What is this?

85
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,492
Maybe you don't know
it's a privilege only for courting couples,

86
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:18,129
and then only when the banns have been read.

87
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:23,103
And Mary Kate Danaher
dippin' her fingers in as neat as you please.

88
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,742
- What did you say her name was?
- Mary Kate Danaher.

89
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,012
And don't be getting any notions in your head.

90
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:33,784
- Mary Kate...
- Forget it, Sean, forget it.

91
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:36,787
- Put it out of your mind.
- Why? What's the matter?

92
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:40,123
- She isn't married or anything?
- Married? That one?

93
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:43,628
Not likely. And her
with her freckles and her temper.

94
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:47,433
Oh, that red head of hers is no lie.

95
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:51,271
Still, a man might put up with that
but not with her lack of a fortune.

96
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:07,391
The wealthiest woman in Inisfree
was the widow Tillane.

97
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:10,028
She had neither chick nor child, poor soul,

98
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:14,067
but she was well-respected
and good to the poor.

99
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:17,805
- So you were born there, is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:21,209
All Thorntons were born there,
seven generations.

101
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,880
I see. And what is your thought, Mr Thornton,

102
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,151
are you planning to turn
White O' Mornin' into a national shrine?

103
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:32,723
Perhaps charge tuppence a visit
for a guided tour

104
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:38,197
through the cottage where the Thorntons
were born. Are you a man of such eminence?

105
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,132
No, not exactly.

106
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:46,241
My own family has been in Ireland since
the Normans came hundreds of years ago,

107
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:51,112
but we've seen no reason to establish
monuments or memorials...

108
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:55,451
Look, Mrs Tillane, I'm not talking about
memorials or monuments.

109
00:14:55,652 --> 00:15:00,625
Ever since I was a kid
living in a shack near the slag heaps,

110
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:04,964
my mother has told me about
Inisfree and White O' Mornin'.

111
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:09,437
Inisfree has become
another word for heaven to me.

112
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:14,341
When I quit the... When I decided to come here,
it was with one thought in mind.

113
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:17,378
Inisfree is far from being a heaven, Mr Thornton.

114
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:21,351
Ma'am, Mr Red Will Danaher
wishes to be announced,

115
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,455
I mean, Squire Danaher.

116
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,624
Watch your muddy boots!

117
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,402
- Mrs Tillane.
- Mr Thornton, from America.

118
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,569
- Aw!
- Boo.

119
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,308
It's him I'm here about, Mrs Tillane.

120
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,079
- (WILL): Is it true?
- Is what true?

121
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,785
That behind me back, he's trying to steal
White O' Mornin' right from under me nose?

122
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,989
And what concern of yours is this, Will Danaher?

123
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:55,561
Concern? Concern enough.

124
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:58,965
Haven't I made you a fair offer
for that same piece of land?

125
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:03,636
- And mine, lying right next to yours?
- You may keep your offers.

126
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:08,876
- Oh, so it's true. You sold it!
- No, I have not.

127
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:17,154
Oh, I knew it was a dirty lie
the very minute I heard it!

128
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,891
Sure, I said to him,

129
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:24,064
"Paggy McFarland, I won't believe
that Sarah'd be selling White O' Mornin'."

130
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,134
(WILL): Why, it would be like building a fence
between your land and mine.

131
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:33,975
"And for a stranger to move in", says I.
"What would she be doing that for?"

132
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,879
And us so close to an understanding,
you might say.

133
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,116
- So you told him all that?
- That I did.

134
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,854
Down at the pub, I suppose,
in front of all those big ears,

135
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:47,593
with pints in their fists
and pipes in their mouths.

136
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:51,062
You may have the land, Mr Thornton,
for 600 pounds.

137
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:54,299
- Done!
- No, you can't. 610!

138
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:57,404
As I remember, you said 700 pounds.

139
00:16:57,605 --> 00:17:01,675
See here, little man... 710!

140
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,381
- How about an even thousand?
- A thousand and...

141
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:11,255
And... and I'll be saying good day to you,
Mrs Tillane, and all here but one.

142
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:14,424
And I've got you down in my book.

143
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,965
My dad remembers his dad well.

144
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,537
Mike Thornton.
He had shoulders on him like an ox.

145
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:29,778
I saw him meself this mornin'. A tall,
handsome man, as I was passin' that chapel.

146
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:35,820
If you'd pass the pub as fast as you pass
the chapel, you'd be better off, little squint.

147
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:57,714
Just look at them!
Eating me out of house and home.

148
00:17:57,914 --> 00:18:01,851
Get back to the fields! There's work to be done.

149
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:15,601
Isn't it a bit early in the day
for the bottle... even for you?

150
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:18,740
Feeney, get your book out.

151
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:25,215
Set down the name, the one Sean Thornton.

152
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:29,819
Oh, look at me clean floor! You dirty little...

153
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:33,958
- Shut your gob.
- Aw, shut you, little man! Here.

154
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:37,496
Clean it up yourself,
or there will be no dinner tonight!

155
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:44,973
There now! Look now,
you mustn't mind himself this day.

156
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,711
That's all the work you're good for,
you little tattletail.

157
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:54,149
- Feeney, have you written the name I gave you?
- I have.

158
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,924
Well, strike a line through it.
That's for him. Sean Thornton...

159
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:05,364
So... He bought White O' Mornin'
in spite of you.

160
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:12,308
Good for widow Tillane.

161
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,678
Pay no attention to her at all! Take no notice.

162
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:19,915
You do, and there'll be a fine wake
in this house tonight.

163
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,654
After all, he's got more right to that land
than you have!

164
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:37,472
He'll regret it to his dying day,
if ever he lives that long.

165
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:45,447
- Will it be all right if I leave my bags in here?
- I imagine they'll be safe enough.

166
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:51,588
If you see a little guy, Michaleen Flynn,
tell him I'm waiting for him in the bar.

167
00:19:51,788 --> 00:19:55,894
- It'll be a pleasure, especially for Michaleen.
- Thanks.

168
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,398
Is there anything you should like now, Yank?

169
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:04,704
If I think of anything, I'll let you know.

170
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:13,049
(BAR IS QUIET)

171
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,486
Evening.

172
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,227
Pleasant night.

173
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:29,234
- I'll try one of those black beers.
- Oh, the porter. Yes, sir.

174
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:39,314
Sir, will you join me? Matter of fact,
I'd like to buy everybody a drink.

175
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:43,887
I do not believe I heard your name, tall man.

176
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:46,625
Thornton. Sean Thornton.

177
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:51,061
And... your father's name?

178
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:56,335
Mike. Michael Thornton.
He used to live here, by the Mornin'.

179
00:20:56,535 --> 00:21:00,508
I just bought the place back.
That's why I'm here.

180
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:06,248
Then your grandfather
would be Ol' Sean Thornton.

181
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:10,054
- Right.
- Bless his memory.

182
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:12,624
So it's himself you're named after.

183
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:18,897
Well, now. That being the case, it is
a pleasant evening and we will have a drink.

184
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:26,106
* There was a wild colonial boy

185
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:30,278
# Jack Duggan was his name

186
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:36,220
# He was born and bred in Ireland

187
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:40,757
# In a town called Castlemaine

188
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,762
- Good evening, Father.
- Is the rest of the committee here?

189
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:46,699
- They're waiting.
- Sorry we're late.

190
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:52,005
- The fishing was bad, was it?
- Fine lot of time we had for that!

191
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,510
- Oh, Michaleen...
- Commandant Forbes.

192
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:59,683
You can forget about the Commandant.
We're at peace now.

193
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,751
Sure, but I haven't given up hope.

194
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:07,624
- Your Yankee friend is waitin' in the bar.
- Oh, he's here already...

195
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,295
Wait a minute. Who is he anyway?

196
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:16,269
He's a nice, quiet, peacelovin' man
come home to Ireland to forget his troubles.

197
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,943
- Troubles?
- Yes, he's a millionaire like all the Yanks.

198
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:24,514
But he is eccentric. Wait till I show you.

199
00:22:26,648 --> 00:22:31,287
- What is it?
- A bag to sleep in. A sleeper bag they call it.

200
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:36,228
I'm tellin' you. The sleeper bag...
Wait till I show you how it operates.

201
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:39,097
- Where does it open?
- Hurry up, I have an important appointment.

202
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:41,401
- Well, open it up!
- Here.

203
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:46,141
# At the early age of sixteen years

204
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:50,411
# He left his native home

205
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:55,484
# And to Australia's sunny shores

206
00:22:55,685 --> 00:23:00,091
# He was inclined to roam

207
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:04,830
# He robbed a wealthy squireen

208
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:09,537
# All arms he did destroy

209
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:14,240
# A terror to Australia was

210
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:19,247
# This wild colonial boy

211
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:26,824
Sean Thornton, the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home.

212
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:28,960
Thank you.

213
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:34,001
"And the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home."

214
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:38,237
- What's wrong with that little speech?
- Oh, you'd be knowin' what.

215
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:49,419
I'm a man from Inisfree, and the best man.

216
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,556
And I bid no welcome to a man fool enough

217
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,063
to pay 1000 pounds for a bit of land
that isn't worth 200!

218
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:58,866
True for you, squire.

219
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:05,304
(MAN): Didn't I hear of someone
named Danaher bid 810?

220
00:24:07,741 --> 00:24:13,182
Get your book out.
Put his name down: Dermot Fahy.

221
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:17,487
F-A-H-Y. No e's, Squireen Danaher.

222
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:19,390
If you were half the man you think you are,

223
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,896
you wouldn't begrudge a Thornton
the right to his birthplace.

224
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:26,764
- What right has he to a land he's never worked?
- It's Thornton land, isn't it?

225
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:30,303
- You've too much of your own as it is.
- Quiet, if you please.

226
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:34,575
Parliamentary procedure.
Squire Danaher has the floor.

227
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:37,747
If I had the floor...

228
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,918
- ... I'd hit that big ape with it.
- Hold on.

229
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:45,190
I don't blame Mr Danaher for gettin' on his ear.

230
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,694
Who's on his ear? Why, you and ten like you
couldn't put a Danaher on his ear.

231
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:52,897
- It's just a way of speaking...
- Mind your ways, then.

232
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:58,572
The point is, it's already done. I own
the property now, and since we're neighbours...

233
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,142
Neighbours? Neighbours...

234
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:03,845
Never!

235
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:08,451
And if I so much as catch you putting
one foot on my property, I... I...

236
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:12,891
And, oh, another thing.
You keep away from my sister Mary Kate.

237
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,191
She's not for the likes of you.

238
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:19,598
Where I come from, we don't talk
about our womenfolk in saloons.

239
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,903
You sort of make a habit of it.
This morning it was widow Tillane.

240
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:27,274
- What's that?
- That's true. It's ashamed you should be.

241
00:25:27,474 --> 00:25:31,714
Hey, look, I'm not accusing Mary Kate.
It's him.

242
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:35,520
Why, this very moment,
let him deny it if he can.

243
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,055
At the back of the chapel,
he took liberties that he shouldn't have.

244
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,460
- I said "good morning" to her.
- Good morning?

245
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,764
- It was "good night" you had on your mind.
- That's a lie.

246
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:47,801
(MUSIC STOPS)

247
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:51,438
- That's a what?
- I said "that's a lie".

248
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,513
That's a word I take from no man!
Put up your fists.

249
00:25:57,714 --> 00:26:00,084
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- But I'm gonna...

250
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:04,587
Thank you.

251
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:10,261
(FATHER): Danaher!
What's the matter with you?

252
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:13,432
(FORBES): He's drunk!
Feeney, take him home, will you.

253
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:16,269
(FEENEY): Don't soil your knuckles on the man.

254
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,107
- Come on, what do you say?
- Never.

255
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:21,944
Take the man's hand, or I'll read your name
on a mass on Sunday.

256
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:25,215
- (FEENEY): Take it.
- I'd join the Church of Ireland first.

257
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:29,785
As if they'd have you.
Shake his hand like I tell you.

258
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:33,124
- (FEENEY): Come on, come on.
- Shake hands?

259
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:45,473
It's a good grip you have.
I always hated a flappy handshake myself.

260
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,187
Father Paul!

261
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:01,959
Michaleen, introduce me to this quiet,
peacelovin' man of yours.

262
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,531
I have a strange notion
we're going to be friends, Yank.

263
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:09,370
Give me a minute.
Just let some blood run back into this.

264
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:16,277
Sean Thornton... His grandfather,
a grand man he was, was hung in Australia.

265
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:21,918
I could tell you blood-curdlin' stories about him,
but me throat...

266
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,755
(SEAN): All right, come on.

267
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:30,896
# He was born and bred in Ireland

268
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:35,636
# In a town called Castlemaine

269
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:40,774
# He was his father's only son

270
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:45,614
# His mother's pride and joy

271
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:50,754
# And dearly did his parents love

272
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,858
# This wild colonial boy

273
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:49,362
Are you sure you won't change your mind,
and come around home with me?

274
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:53,298
Don't worry about it.
I've got my sleeping bag, haven't I.

275
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,271
Well, it's a nice, soft night.

276
00:28:57,471 --> 00:29:02,176
So, I think I'll join my comrades,
and talk a little treason.

277
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:05,548
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Michaleen.

278
00:29:06,216 --> 00:29:07,484

281
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:11,890
So bold one you are.
Who gave you leave to be kissin' me?

282
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:15,525
- So you can talk?
- Yes, I can, I will, and I do.

283
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:18,296
It's more than talk you'll be gettin'
if you step closer.

284
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:22,035
- Don't worry. You've got a wallop.
- You'll get over it, I'm thinkin'.

285
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:26,406
Some things a man doesn't get over so easily.

286
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,211
Like what supposin'?

287
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:34,652
Like the sight of a girl coming through the fields,
with the sun on her hair.

288
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:40,824
- Kneeling in church, with a face like a saint.
- Saint, indeed.

289
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:44,863
And now, coming to a man's house
to clean it for him.

290
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:48,368
But... that was just my way
of bein' a good Christian act.

291
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:52,606
I know it was, Mary Kate Danaher,
and it was nice of you.

Not at all.

293
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:15,409
- Hello.
- Good morning, Mr Thornton.

294
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:18,880
- How are you, Fa..Doctor...
- No, no. Mr.

295
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:22,819
And on formal occasions,
the Reverend Mr Playfair.

296
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:24,755
And this is Mrs Playfair.

297
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:29,461
(MRS PLAYFAIR): Well, Mr Thornton.
You are a wonder.

298
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:35,803
It looks the way all the Irish cottages
should... and so seldom do.

299
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:40,573
And only an American
would have thought of emerald green.

300
00:33:40,774 --> 00:33:45,948
- Red is more durable.
- And the roses! How nice.

301
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:52,089
You'll need lots of horse manure.
Fertiliser, I mean. Horse is the best.

302
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:58,531
Oh, I brought you a plant.
You know, "a primrose by a river's brink".

303
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:02,968
"Brim", not "brink".
The next line ends in "hymn".

304
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:07,808
Poets are so silly, aren't they?
Oh, I hope you're not one, Mr Thornton.

305
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:11,179
- Oh no, ma'am, I...
- Thornton.

306
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:14,517
There's a familiar ring to it.

307
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:20,425
Ring to it... Thornton...

308
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,332
It's a common name.
Thank you for the plant, Mrs Playfair,

309
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:28,934
this is damn... darn... awfully nice of you.

310
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,139
Oh?

311
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:50,494
It's a bed. Excuse me.

312
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:57,236
- Morning.
- (MAN): That's a fine big bed, Mr Thornton.

313

Biggest one I could find.

314
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:17,695
Is that a bed or a parade ground?

315
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:21,935
Oh, a man'd have to be a sprinter
to catch his wife in a bed like that.

Whoa!

318
00:35:57,147 --> 00:36:03,053
Mr Flynn... And what are you
all dressed up for, Michaleen Oge?

319
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:08,325
I ha...

320
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:17,571
- I have come...
- Oh, I can see that.

321
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:21,310
- But from whose pub was it?
- P... pub?

322
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:27,549
You've a tongue like an adder.
I go about me own business,

323
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:32,088
and tell Thorn Seanton
he's well off without you.

324
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:35,861
Wait a minute. What was that?

325
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:41,334
Well, if you listened
and not be interruptin' the matchmaker.

326
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:48,077
I have come...

327
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:53,114
- ... at the request of Thorn Seanton...
- Sean Thornton.

328
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:54,983
Shut up.

329
00:36:56,052 --> 00:37:00,658
... bachelor, and party of the first part...

330
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:09,504
... to ask of you, strictly and formally, here...

331
00:37:10,304 --> 00:37:14,577
... Mary Kate Danaher, spinster...

332
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:17,778
... and party to the second part...

333
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:25,022
Well?. Go on, you were sayin'?

334
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:31,531
Me mouth is like a dry crust,
and the sun is that hot, and me pate...

335
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:34,234
Would you be steppin' into the parlour?

336
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:40,039
The house may belong to my brother,
but what's in the parlour belongs to me.

337
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:45,614
I will then, and I hope there's a bottle there,
whoever it belongs to.

338
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:47,617
It could be.

339
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:59,867
You have a fine, steady hand.

340
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,687
To good bargaining.

341
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:24,264
To resume:

342
00:38:24,497 --> 00:38:26,634
- The party of the first part...
- That's him.

343
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:33,140
... has instructed me to enquire
before enterin' into formal negotiations...

344
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:36,545
- ... whether the party to the second part...
- That's me.

345
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:43,186
... thinks kindly of the general idea,
or in his own words... American, eh...

346
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:48,227
- ... eh, yes, he wants to know if you go for it.
- Go for it?

347
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:53,431
- And if you do, he'll speak to your brother.
- That won't be easy.

348
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:55,668
Oh, as well I know it.

349
00:38:55,868 --> 00:39:00,975
He'd as soon put his fist into my teeth
as bid me the time of the day.

350
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:06,882
What did Sean... the party of the first part,
say about my fortune?

351
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:09,754
He says he doesn't give it...

352
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,727
He says it's a matter of
complete indifference to him.

353
00:39:14,927 --> 00:39:19,231
- He did?
- He says he doesn't give a sh...

354
00:39:19,464 --> 00:39:25,706
He says it's all one to him if you come
in the clothes on your back, or without them.

355
00:39:30,212 --> 00:39:33,483
Oh, he did, did he? Well.

356
00:39:33,684 --> 00:39:38,490
A fine opinion he must have of me, if he thinks
I'd go to any man without a proper fortune.

357
00:39:38,691 --> 00:39:41,959
And this you may tell
your Mr Party of the first part:

358
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,632
When I wed, whatever's my own, goes with me.

359
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,435
Get up, little man.

360
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:58,815
And all this furniture is mine.

361
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:02,987
And I have that china, and linen,
and 50 pounds in gold my father left me,

362
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:08,526
and my mother's rings, brooches,
my grandmother's veil, her silver comb...

363
00:40:09,294 --> 00:40:15,968
Thirty pounds odd in notes and silver
I've earned these past 15 years, that's all.

364
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:22,945
You're a well propertied woman.
I wouldn't mind marryin' you meself.

365
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:29,685
Eh, where'd you leave the bottle?

366
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:38,230
And I'd have you tell him, that I'm no pauper
to be going to him in my shift.

367
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:55,183
# Lo, young May moon is beamin' love

368
00:40:55,383 --> 00:41:00,925
# The glow of one's lamp is gleamin' love

369
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:07,065
# How sweet to row through Mourner's Grove

370
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:14,877
# While the drowsy world is dreamin'...

371
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:17,811
- You know "The Peter And The Ghost".?
- I do not.

372
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:22,618
- Neither do I.
- Could you use a little water in your whiskey?

373
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:29,060
When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey,
and when I drink water, I drink water.

374
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,097
Back to business now.

375
00:41:32,298 --> 00:41:36,837
What answer will I give Sean Thornton,
Mary Kate Danaher?

376
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:40,506
Well, you can tell him from me that...

377
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:46,748
... that I go for it.

378
00:41:46,948 --> 00:41:52,589
# Here's to steal a few hours from the night

379
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:57,129
# My dear

380
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:14,217
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

381
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,647
- Hey, what do I say?
- I'll do all the talkin'.

382
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:43,252
- And I'm suppose to stand here like a dummy?
- Shh, now.

383
00:42:49,294 --> 00:42:54,165
- Will, there's someone coming to call.
- Who?

384
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:56,603
It's... well...

385
00:42:56,836 --> 00:43:01,041
It's Michaleen Oge Flynn,
and there's a gentleman with him.

386
00:43:03,577 --> 00:43:06,314
Here, Will, put on your coat.

387
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,654
Will Danaher, they're comin' to the front door.

388
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,992
Since when has the back door
been not good enough?

389
00:43:23,135 --> 00:43:25,806
- (MICHALEEN): God bless all in this house.
- (SEAN): Good evening.

390
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,210
(MICHALEEN): Miss Danaher,
we'd like a word with your brother.

391
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:33,983
Come on in so, and welcome.

392
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:37,455
Easy now!

393
00:43:43,193 --> 00:43:49,902
Mr Sean Thornton, bachelor,
meet Miss Mary Kate Danaher, spinster.

394
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:57,179
Miss Danaher, meet Mr Thornton
from Pittsburgh, Massachusetts, USA.

395
00:43:57,746 --> 00:44:00,717
- Good evening, Miss Danaher.
- This...

396
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,653
This way, please.

397
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:16,903
- Eh, this is my brother...
- Leave the room.

398
00:44:17,103 --> 00:44:20,241
- But...
- I said, leave the room.

399
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:24,680
- Yes, Will.
- Sit down, that's what chairs are for.

400
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:30,485
- If you've come for supper, you're late.
- Gracious invitation, but thank you, no.

401
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,958
I don't suppose there's a drop in the house.

402
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:40,231
- Help yourself to the buttermilk.
- Buttermilk? The Borgias would do better.

403
00:44:40,432 --> 00:44:46,374
We'll come with your permission
to the object of this visit.

404
00:44:46,607 --> 00:44:53,381
You've noticed, I presume,
that I'm wearin' my official black coat.

405
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:56,920
I have. For your dead friend here.

406
00:44:58,121 --> 00:45:00,524
(WILL): I need no trouble
to arrange any marriages for me.

407
00:45:00,724 --> 00:45:06,731
I see. You've been making fine progress
with widow Tillane in the last ten years.

408
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:09,303
- Is that what you've come to talk about?
- I have not.

409
00:45:09,536 --> 00:45:13,208
- I've come to talk about your sister and him.
- Aw, get out.

410
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:17,111
If he was the last man
on the face of the earth, I'd still say no.

411
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:21,083
- Now just a minute.
- If it's a question of the girl's fortune...

412
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:25,555
Why, if it'd be a shilling piece
he wanted with her...

413
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:29,193
- ... I'd still say no.
- Come on, Michaleen. I told you so.

414
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,966
- I'll explain it to her myself.
- Hey, Yank, I'll count three.

415
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:36,270
If you're not out of the house by then,
I'll loose the dogs on you.

416
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:41,841
If you say three,
you'll never hear the man count ten.

417
00:45:53,924 --> 00:45:59,399
- Oh, Mary Kate, we tried.
- We'll see him again some other time.

418
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,107
I thank you anyway,
Sean Thornton, for the asking.

419
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:12,447
You don't think this changes anything?
It's what you say that counts, not him.

420
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:15,018
Now, now, Sean.
You've gone too far, that's enough.

421
00:46:15,218 --> 00:46:19,824
Say, what is this?
We're gonna get married, aren't we?

422
00:46:30,202 --> 00:46:33,874
- I don't get it.
- This is Ireland, Sean, not America.

423
00:46:34,107 --> 00:46:40,248
Without her brother's consent she couldn't,
and wouldn't. I'm sorry for both of you.

424
00:47:13,926 --> 00:47:20,031
Those were the bad days. Sean with a face
as dark as the black hunter he rode.

425
00:47:20,231 --> 00:47:22,501
A fine, ill-tempered pair they were.

426
00:47:22,735 --> 00:47:25,438
It was only a matter of time
before one or the other broke his neck.

427
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:27,941
We knew things couldn't go on this way.

428
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,156
Easy, Sean!

429
00:47:48,901 --> 00:47:51,971
Hello, Mary Kate... Danaher.

430
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:56,378
Good morning, Sean Thornton.

431
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:07,557
So, we formed a little conspiracy.

432
00:48:07,757 --> 00:48:14,434
The Reverend Mr and Mrs Playfair,
Michaleen Oge and, saints forgive us, myself.

433
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:20,775
And on the day of the Inisfree Races,
we sprung the trap on Red Will Danaher.

434
00:48:57,887 --> 00:49:00,658
Remember, you make your speed
when you hit the water.

435
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:04,094
- Yes, father.
- And ride carefully, my son.

436
00:49:04,296 --> 00:49:05,697
Yes, mum.

437
00:49:05,897 --> 00:49:07,900
Thornton, no silks.

438
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,570
- Your colours, Thornton.
- Thank you.

439
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,099
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

440
00:49:41,107 --> 00:49:46,081
Ladies, gentlemen, your attention, please!

441
00:49:46,314 --> 00:49:49,385
Will all the lovely ladies,

442
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:54,257
who are putting up their bonnets
for the Inisfree Cup,

443
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:58,697
please place their bonnets on the finishing line.

444
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,737
Ladies, your bonnets, please!

445
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:07,507
- Will you not be putting up your bonnet?
- Indeed, I will not.

446
00:50:07,707 --> 00:50:09,944
- No?
- No!

447
00:50:19,957 --> 00:50:22,827
Okay, Michaleen, the widow's bonnet.

448
00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:29,334
Will all the gentlemen riders
please go to the starting line.

449
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:32,673
All riders, please.

450
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:41,114
Crown at 20 to 1 on the Yank.
I'm given 20 to 1 on the Yank...

451
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:47,556
- I'm given 30 to 1... 40 to 1 on Danaher.
- Flynn!

452
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:54,130
If you've done any matchmaking between
Thornton and my widow, I'll put you in me pocket.

453
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:59,904
- Ah, so you've heard?
- Father, what sort of a scoundrel is this Yank?

454
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:03,108
One minute it's me sister,
and the next it's herself.

455
00:51:03,308 --> 00:51:05,277
Well, blame no one but yourself.

456
00:51:05,477 --> 00:51:09,817
If you'd saved me as your matchmaker,
you would've been married long since.

457
00:51:10,051 --> 00:51:13,956
- True, Will, true.
- I'm not saying it's too late yet.

458
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:19,761
- What do you mean?
- Why has the widow stood you up so long?

459
00:51:19,961 --> 00:51:22,232
- You're a fine looking man.
- I am.

460
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:25,870
- A rich, propertied man.
- And well she knows it.

461
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:30,309
- Father, will I tell him?
- Go ahead, Michaleen.

462
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:34,081
What woman would come into a house
with another woman in it?

463
00:51:34,282 --> 00:51:38,887
If you got rid of Mary Kate,
the widow would be in like a shot.

464
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:43,191
- No.
- Yes. You had your chance and you flubbed it.

465
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:47,030
You refused Seaneen Thornton,
and he reneged on you.

466
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:53,037
Now, I doubt if he'd take your sister
if you put 1000 pounds on her.

467
00:51:53,237 --> 00:51:57,643
- Father Lonergan?
- I can't say it's true, and I won't say it's not.

468
00:51:57,844 --> 00:52:01,516
- But there's been talk.
- Oh, a lot of talk.

469
00:52:01,716 --> 00:52:03,616
A lot of talk, eh?

470
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:07,387
Two women in the house,
and one of them a redhead.

471
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:12,161
Two women.

472
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:21,740
Three Our Fathers, and three Hail Marys.

473
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:31,518

01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:22,759
(MARY KATE): I'll wear your ring,
I'll cook, and I'll wash.

636
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:26,231
I'll keep the land, but that is all!

637
01:19:26,431 --> 01:19:30,303
Until I've got my dowry safe about me,
I'm no married woman.

638
01:19:30,536 --> 01:19:34,842
I'm the servant I've always been,
without anything of my own.

639
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:38,014
That's ridiculous! You're my wife, and fortune...

640
01:19:40,216 --> 01:19:43,319
- What is this?
- Haven't I been trying to tell you?

641
01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:48,325
Not until you have my dowry, you haven't got any bit of me.
Me, myself!

642
01:19:48,525 --> 01:19:52,830
I'd still be dreaming amongst the things that aren't my own...

643
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:55,201
... as if I had never met you.

644
01:19:57,037 --> 01:20:02,811
There's 300 years of happy dreamin
in those things of mine, and...

645
01:20:03,612 --> 01:20:09,251
... I want them. I want my dream.
I'll have it and I know it!

646
01:20:10,886 --> 01:20:15,059
- I'll say no other word to you.
- All right.

647
01:20:15,259 --> 01:20:20,733
You'll have your dowry, or daughter of fortune,
or whatever you call it.

648
01:20:20,933 --> 01:20:23,135
Well, get it then.

649
01:20:53,908 --> 01:21:00,248
There will be no locks or bolts between us,
except those in your own mercenary little heart.

650
01:21:36,494 --> 01:21:40,132
(LAUGHTER AND MUSIC FROM OUTSIDE)

651
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:00,024
- Sean.
- How'd you sleep?

652
01:22:01,493 --> 01:22:04,730
Don't be shamin' me, please, in front of your friends.

653
01:22:04,931 --> 01:22:08,567
What... ? Oh, okay.

654
01:22:12,038 --> 01:22:15,709
# (MEN).: There that I learned all me courtin'

655
01:22:15,909 --> 01:22:19,582
# Many lessons I took in the art

# The Cupid, the blagger, while sportin'

659
01:22:32,997 --> 01:22:38,271
# So I lathered him with me shillelagh

660

01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:51,221
# I lathered him with me shillelagh

663
01:22:51,422 --> 01:22:57,428
# For, he trod on the tail of me coat

664
01:23:04,036 --> 01:23:07,008
Hello, the house! Anyone up?

665
01:23:09,544 --> 01:23:12,749
- Good mornin'!
- Good mornin'.

666
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:19,823
I... I suppose it's a bit early to be callin'.

667
01:23:20,056 --> 01:23:26,598
After you left last night, Mary Kate,
a couple of us persuaded Danaher to change his mind.

668
01:23:26,798 --> 01:23:31,572
It's a... what might be called a sort of
a belated wedding present.

669
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:38,948
My things... My furniture!

670
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:45,321
We'd brought them over last night,
but due to the circumstances...

671
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:48,158
Thanks, thanks.

672
01:23:51,095 --> 01:23:54,801
- Okay, easy now.
- God bless all here.

673
01:23:55,335 --> 01:24:00,241
That's right. Oh, be careful. Over there by the wall.

674
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:08,517
No, no, no. Turn it around, so that
the light shines on the music.

675
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:17,362
- That's grand. That's grand now.
- Where do you want this?

676
01:24:22,034 --> 01:24:25,106
- Mighty handy.
- It...

677
01:24:25,339 --> 01:24:28,476
It was my mother's, and my mother's mother's before.

678
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:34,482
- Where do I put it?
- Where do you suppose?

679
01:24:34,682 --> 01:24:37,454
(MICHALEEN): Where do you suppose...

680
01:24:41,058 --> 01:24:46,031
- We're sorry about the dowry, Mary Kate.
- We couldn't get him to change his mind.

681
01:24:46,264 --> 01:24:49,803
- Not even Father Lonergan could do it.
- (SEAN): Let him keep it.

682
01:24:50,003 --> 01:24:53,608
- Keep my fortune?
- You've got your tables and chairs.

683
01:24:53,808 --> 01:24:56,043
- What do we care about his money?
- My money.

684
01:24:56,243 --> 01:24:59,380
Let him have it if it means that much to him.

685
01:25:03,686 --> 01:25:09,293
- What manner of man is it that I've married?
- A better one, I think, that you know.

686
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:30,087
Impetuous! Homeric!

# Bromwell Creek

695
01:27:12,548 --> 01:27:17,588
Now I know why you have so many rock walls in this country.

696
01:27:19,355 --> 01:27:22,558
(MARY KATE): Roses! Are you plantin' roses?

697
01:27:22,759 --> 01:27:25,263
- Yeah.
- A fine farmer you are.

698
01:27:25,463 --> 01:27:28,701
- Not a turnip, or a potato in the field.
- Or children.

699
01:27:28,901 --> 01:27:31,371
(ROOSTER CROWS)

700
01:27:39,848 --> 01:27:42,185
Sorry.

701
01:27:45,988 --> 01:27:51,395
Well, I... I suppose they'll make a very fine
display around the cottage.

702
01:27:53,532 --> 01:27:57,003
- It is a pretty cottage, isn't it?
- I think so.

703
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:12,990
Let's see now.

704
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:17,930
We need a plough, and a cultivator,
and seed for planting.

705
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:21,567
About a horse for the ploughing...
We could sell that hunter of yours.

706
01:28:21,767 --> 01:28:26,307
I'll buy another horse for the ploughing.
Why not a tractor?

707
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:32,279
Oh, a tractor... Nasty, smelly things.
Besides, they're an awful price.

708
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:37,420
- With a horse, you get other advantages.
- Yeah. For the roses.

709
01:28:38,488 --> 01:28:40,256
Roses, again.

710
01:28:41,793 --> 01:28:44,229
You...

711
01:28:47,933 --> 01:28:51,171
We could do our shopping in Castletown,

712
01:28:51,371 --> 01:28:54,908
and if we put a good foot under us,
we'd be back by suppertime.

713
01:28:55,142 --> 01:28:57,577
- Five miles!
- Well, that's just a...

714
01:28:57,778 --> 01:29:00,516
Good stretch of the legs, huh?

715
01:29:02,718 --> 01:29:06,023
All right, get on your walking shoes.

716
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:13,566

So, you're not a woman to be honked at, ha?

720
01:29:42,868 --> 01:29:46,405
Why, it's beautiful! Did you ever see...

721
01:29:46,605 --> 01:29:50,845
- It looks like it could fly.
- Only one horsepower, but it's all yours.

722
01:29:51,645 --> 01:29:54,717
- Mine?
- Sure. Think you can drive it?

723
01:29:54,951 --> 01:29:57,286
Hold on to your hat!

724
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:06,805
(RED WILL): You take care of that, Feeney.

725
01:31:12,846 --> 01:31:17,987
- Let's have another pint. I'm buying this one.
- High time.

- What's that?
- I said, that's fine, squire.

727

Good health to you all.

728
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:30,501
- Look, he sold the crossbreds.
- The what?

729
01:31:30,601 --> 01:31:32,571
- The sheep he's been planning on.
- Oh.

730
01:31:32,704 --> 01:31:36,308
Hurry, now is a good time to ask him. Well, go on.

731
01:31:36,476 --> 01:31:39,613
- Ask him what?
- About my money.

732
01:31:39,713 --> 01:31:41,682
He can't say that he hasn't got it with him now.

733
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:45,719
Can't you understand that
I didn't marry you for your fortune?

734
01:31:45,919 --> 01:31:51,594
- I don't give... a hang about the money.
- But he does! That's the whole point of it.

735
01:31:51,894 --> 01:31:56,434
- Now will you go and ask him?
- No. Why shame ourselves?

736
01:31:56,567 --> 01:32:02,509
Shame? The shame's on you, not on me.
Or on me too, if I married a coward.

737
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:05,980
Is that what you think of me?

738
01:32:06,113 --> 01:32:08,581
What else if you let him rob you out of my money?

739
01:32:08,682 --> 01:32:14,623
Money! I'm sick of the talk of it.
Is that all you Danahers think about? Money?

- This is very important...
- Oh, salmon! He's winking at me.

742
01:33:55,783 --> 01:33:58,019
I've been trying to catch this one for ten years.

743
01:33:58,219 --> 01:34:02,225

744

- Keep his head up. Keep a tight line.

01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:46,986
But he's only just come... oh. Very well.
Good night, Mr Thornton.

797
01:39:47,186 --> 01:39:49,156
- Good night.
- Good night, Cyril.

798
01:39:49,356 --> 01:39:53,194
Good night, Elizabeth. Pleasant dreams.

799
01:39:55,499 --> 01:39:58,669
- Are you sure...
- Good night, Elizabeth.

800
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:04,143
You're the only one I can level with.
I gotta talk to somebody, or I'll blow my top.

801
01:40:04,343 --> 01:40:07,580
- Danaher, of course?
- Yeah.

802
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:12,519
Since you know who I am... or was,
you know why I don't want any fighting.

803
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:16,257
Yes, I was reading about it again this evening.

804
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:23,166
Some men collect butterflies, some stamps.
My hobby's always been sporting events.

805
01:40:23,366 --> 01:40:25,402
There it is.

806
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:27,706
"Trooper Thorn quits ring"

807
01:40:27,906 --> 01:40:31,810
"Heavyweight challenger hangs up gloves
after fatal knockout"

808
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:34,112
"Vows he will never fight again"

809
01:40:36,414 --> 01:40:38,852
It's a very understandable reaction.

810
01:40:39,086 --> 01:40:44,261
The papers all say it was an accident.
Just one of those things.

811
01:40:44,494 --> 01:40:50,301
It's just one of those things in a scrapbook,
but when you carry it around in here...

812
01:40:52,203 --> 01:40:55,940
Tony Gardello was a good egg.

813
01:40:56,140 --> 01:41:02,081
Nice little wife and a home, a couple of kids.
A clean fighter.

814
01:41:02,949 --> 01:41:07,789
I didn't go in there to outbox him.
I went there to beat his brains out.

815
01:41:07,989 --> 01:41:12,561
To drive him into the canvas, to murder him.
That's what I did.

816
01:41:13,195 --> 01:41:18,036
For what? Purse, a piece of the gate.

817
01:41:19,736 --> 01:41:21,772
Lousy money.

818
01:41:21,972 --> 01:41:25,476
And now money is behind your trouble with Danaher.

819
01:41:25,677 --> 01:41:31,117
They think I'm afraid of fighting.
All the friends I've made, even my wife.

820
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:35,690
- Well, aren't you in a way?
- Did you ever kill a man?

821
01:41:37,259 --> 01:41:42,364
Well, I have, and all this talk about her big fortune...

822
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:45,702
It's not that important.

823
01:41:46,936 --> 01:41:49,173
Perhaps it is to her.

824
01:41:50,375 --> 01:41:54,981
It must be strange to you from America,

825
01:41:55,182 --> 01:41:59,653
but it's an old, old custom here, and believe me,
it's a good custom.

826
01:41:59,853 --> 01:42:02,725
The fortune means more to her than just the money.

827
01:42:02,925 --> 01:42:06,828
Not to me, it isn't. Not worth fighting for.

828
01:42:07,028 --> 01:42:10,733
- Is your wife's love worth fighting for?
- I don't know.

829
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:19,412
All I know is that... I won't fight,
unless I'm mad enough to kill,

830
01:42:19,612 --> 01:42:23,316
and if that means losin' her... I don't know.

831
01:42:24,183 --> 01:42:28,490
- Maybe she doesn't love me enough.
- It's a difficult situation.

832
01:42:29,892 --> 01:42:33,395
I think you'll find the right answer in God's good time.

833
01:42:33,628 --> 01:42:37,066
And when that time comes, I hope I'm still here.

834
01:42:37,266 --> 01:42:41,171
- You're not leaving, are you?
- It's a possibility.

835
01:42:41,371 --> 01:42:45,077
My bishop is coming tomorrow on his annual visit,

836
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:50,618
and I've got such a small congregation,
just 2-3 people at the service.

837
01:42:50,818 --> 01:42:55,923
- He may transfer me.
- The place wouldn't be the same without you.

838
01:42:56,857 --> 01:43:02,498
Elizabeth and I just love this place.
We were born here too, you know.

839
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:06,937
The bishop's a good egg, maybe it'll be all right.

840
01:43:07,138 --> 01:43:11,810
Oh, by the way. Don't underestimate Danaher.

841
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:16,316
He may be clumsy, but he's got
a tremendous right and a jaw of granite.

842
01:43:19,152 --> 01:43:22,689
I did a little bit of boxing in my time.

843
01:43:32,271 --> 01:43:34,672
You won't be laughin' now, will you?

844
01:43:37,376 --> 01:43:39,579
It was at Trinity.

845
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:43,016
"Lightweight champion, 19... "

846
01:43:43,216 --> 01:43:47,186
The year doesn't matter. It was long, long ago.

847
01:43:50,025 --> 01:43:52,761
All right.

848
01:43:53,361 --> 01:43:56,100
By the way, would you join me in a glass of...

849
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,269
Oh, no.

850
01:44:00,605 --> 01:44:04,543
No. You'll be in training now, of course.

851
01:45:14,631 --> 01:45:18,801
- (MARY KATE): Did you have any supper?
- No.

852
01:45:19,002 --> 01:45:21,138
(SEAN): I'm not hungry.

853
01:45:21,338 --> 01:45:26,345
- The drink sometimes does that to a man.
- I haven't had anything to drink.

854
01:45:26,578 --> 01:45:31,585
(SEAN): If you wanna know, I was talking to the vicar.

855
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:36,992
- Mr Playfair.
- That's strange.

856
01:45:44,101 --> 01:45:46,402
I had a long talk with Father Lonergan.

857
01:46:49,149 --> 01:46:52,520
Woman of the house! Where's me tea?

858
01:46:56,325 --> 01:46:57,825
Mary Kate?

859
01:46:58,025 --> 01:47:04,267
(MICHALEEN): Save your breath, boy.
She's gone from you, and small wonder.

860
01:47:04,467 --> 01:47:10,008
- What are you talking about? Where is she?
- She came tappin' at me door.

861
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:13,480
- "Will you join me to the train", says she.
- Why?

862
01:47:13,714 --> 01:47:18,986
The very question. "Why", says I.
"Because I love him", says she.

863
01:47:19,186 --> 01:47:22,723
"I love him too much to go on livin'
with a man I'm ashamed of."

864
01:47:24,425 --> 01:47:29,131
- What time was this?
- Time for the Dublin train.

865
01:47:42,116 --> 01:47:44,418
Saddle up my horse, will you, please.

866
01:47:45,551 --> 01:47:47,553
Saddle his horse?

867
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:53,529
I'll have no part in helpin'
you to put more shame on her.

868
01:47:55,232 --> 01:47:57,467
Saddle his horse...

869
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:04,009
Dam da dam da, diddle de da...

870
01:48:32,944 --> 01:48:34,512
Well, we're off!

871
01:48:34,713 --> 01:48:39,419
Then, might I suggest that the train already
is four and a half hours late.

872
01:48:39,619 --> 01:48:42,390
Now, is it my fault?

873
01:48:42,623 --> 01:48:46,829
There's a match at Ballygar, and the champions of all Ireland...

874
01:48:47,029 --> 01:48:51,635
If you knew your country's history as well as
you claim to know it,

875
01:48:51,836 --> 01:48:57,441
you'd know that they haven't been beaten
west of the Shannon for the last 22 years.

876
01:48:57,641 --> 01:49:00,846
- True!
- It's a lie!

877
01:50:10,264 --> 01:50:12,900
If this means what I hope it means...

878
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:17,173
Danaher versus the Yank.
It'll be weeks on the green this time.

879
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:27,254
Morning.

880
01:50:36,596 --> 01:50:38,099
Good day to you, sir.

881
01:50:51,751 --> 01:50:55,186
Five minutes, did you say? Right!

882
01:50:56,556 --> 01:51:02,797
- He's walkin' her back, the whole long way!
- It's Homeric, that's what it is, Homeric.

883
01:51:02,997 --> 01:51:06,635
- Post a lookout. They may go home first.
- Where's your pistol?.

884
01:51:06,835 --> 01:51:09,807
- In the same place.
- Excuse me, general.

885
01:51:11,074 --> 01:51:16,081
One by land, two by sea, and I'll follow the lot.

886
01:51:16,281 --> 01:51:17,883
What a day for Inisfree!

887
01:51:18,083 --> 01:51:23,388
On a day like this I can say only one thing.
Gentlemen, the drinks are on the house!

888
01:51:26,459 --> 01:51:28,429
Well, they are.

889
01:51:59,401 --> 01:52:03,540
(WOMAN): Darling, here is your shoe!

890
01:52:07,677 --> 01:52:09,581
Why, you...

891
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:18,090
It's only five miles. Just a good stretch of the legs.

892
01:52:23,164 --> 01:52:26,803
- You lost your shoe.
- Thank you very kindly, sir.

893
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:58,608
(WOMAN): Mr... Mr Sean! Here's
a good stick to beat the lovely lady.

894
01:53:00,142 --> 01:53:02,079
Thanks!

895
01:53:04,349 --> 01:53:06,217
(GUNSHOTS FROM OUTSIDE)

896
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:07,627
I think your in-laws are comin'
to visit you, Squire Danaher.

897
01:54:44,642 --> 01:54:49,981
Danaher, you owe me 350 pounds. Let's have it.

898
01:54:59,125 --> 01:55:01,461
So, the IRA is in this, too, eh?

899
01:55:01,662 --> 01:55:07,136
If it were, Will Danaher, not
a stone of your fine house'd be standin'.

900
01:55:07,369 --> 01:55:10,073
A beautiful sentiment.

901
01:55:14,178 --> 01:55:16,381
I'll pay you... never.

902
01:55:16,581 --> 01:55:19,818
That breaks all bargains.

903
01:55:21,154 --> 01:55:25,391
(SEAN): You can take your sister back.
It's your custom, not mine.

904
01:55:25,592 --> 01:55:29,129
(SEAN): No fortune, no marriage. We call it quits.

905
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:38,075
You'd do this to me, your own wife?

906
01:55:38,276 --> 01:55:41,145
- After what...
- (SEAN): It's done.

907
01:55:49,922 --> 01:55:53,059
There's your dirty money. Take it.

908
01:55:53,293 --> 01:55:56,598
Count it, you spawn, and look.

909
01:55:56,799 --> 01:56:00,937
If ever I see that face of yours again,
I'll push that through it.

910
01:56:18,458 --> 01:56:20,561
Charge it!

911
01:56:24,198 --> 01:56:28,271
I'll be goin' on home now.
I'll have the supper ready for you.

912
01:57:07,419 --> 01:57:09,624
All right, Will, you asked for it.

913
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:25,842
Three to one given on Danaher. Three to one...

914
01:57:26,042 --> 01:57:31,016
- I'll have some of that. Ten on Thornton.
- Done! Anyone else?

915
01:58:25,384 --> 01:58:29,589
(MICHALEEN): Gentlemen, if you please.
This is a private fight.

916
01:58:29,789 --> 01:58:34,061
The Marquis of Queensbury rules
will be observed on all occasions.

917
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:36,897
Mind your nose, squire.

918
01:58:37,598 --> 01:58:40,335
Okay with me, Michaleen!

919
01:58:44,308 --> 01:58:45,577
Thanks.

920
01:58:45,777 --> 01:58:49,814
Non-belligerents will kindly remain neutral.

921
01:58:50,014 --> 01:58:53,853
Now, shake hands and come out fighting. I thank you.

922
01:58:54,054 --> 01:58:57,524
Did you hear that, everybody?
The Marquis of Queensbury rules.

923
01:58:57,757 --> 01:58:59,959
- The Marquis of Queensbury rules.
- Mar..

924
01:59:05,333 --> 01:59:08,404
Come on, get up, Marquis of Queensbury.

925
01:59:08,605 --> 01:59:13,043
- I hope that Thornton beats him senseless.
- He's a married man, Sarah.

926
01:59:13,244 --> 01:59:17,115
Who cares about him? It's that big bully concerns me.

927
01:59:17,315 --> 01:59:20,418
"I'm the best man in Inisfree."
As if I didn't know that.

928
01:59:25,191 --> 01:59:29,196
Call them and tell them to send reinforcements.
There's a riot here.

929
01:59:45,150 --> 01:59:47,351
Five to one on the big chap, Snuffy.

930
01:59:47,552 --> 01:59:50,990
- Given or taken?
- Given.

931
02:00:04,508 --> 02:00:07,243
- You've had enough?
- No.

932
02:00:12,282 --> 02:00:15,087
Well, give a man a hand, then.

933
02:00:22,597 --> 02:00:24,900
Yes, inspector. Thank you, sir.

934
02:00:25,133 --> 02:00:28,238
- What did he say?
- To put five pounds on Danaher's nose.

935
02:00:29,239 --> 02:00:33,010
- Another ten on Thornton!
- Another.

936
02:00:34,444 --> 02:00:39,618
- A pound on Danaher.
- Two pounds on Danaher, please.

937
02:00:39,818 --> 02:00:42,388
Two pounds?

938
02:00:42,788 --> 02:00:46,560
"... hands of a hundred battles,
eye on a thousand besides... "

939
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:50,031
"... stood alone on the victorious field,
his buckler bent... "

940
02:00:50,232 --> 02:00:53,235
"... his broken sword clutched in his mighty hand... "

941
02:00:53,435 --> 02:00:59,441
"... the blood of a thousand wounds
oozing from his open veins... "

942
02:00:59,641 --> 02:01:02,011
(NOISE OUTSIDE)

943
02:01:26,243 --> 02:01:29,913
- Father! Father Lonergan!
- Shh, shhh.

944
02:01:30,148 --> 02:01:33,653
- A big fight in the town!
- And in this fish right here.

945
02:01:33,853 --> 02:01:37,457
- I'd put a stop to it but...
- You do that. It's your duty.

946
02:01:37,657 --> 02:01:40,761
But you see, it was Danaher and Sean Thornton!

947
02:01:40,961 --> 02:01:43,731
- Who?
- Danaher and Sean Thornton.

948
02:01:43,931 --> 02:01:46,434
Why the devil didn't you tell me?

949
02:02:03,824 --> 02:02:07,293
- Shouldn't we put a stop to it?
- We should, lad, we should.

950
02:02:07,493 --> 02:02:10,730
It's our duty, yes, it's our duty.

951
02:02:18,308 --> 02:02:21,012
Come on, come on!

952
02:02:27,987 --> 02:02:31,858
- How's that bettin' going?
- Even money, but don't ruin it.

953
02:02:33,794 --> 02:02:37,931
Well, Danaher, you're a good fight,
I'll say that for you.

954
02:02:38,133 --> 02:02:42,438
When it comes to that, it's been a pleasure beatin' you.

955
02:02:49,947 --> 02:02:51,517
Thanks.

956
02:02:53,018 --> 02:02:56,923
- Will you take another 20 on Thornton?
- No, the book's closed.

957
02:02:58,690 --> 02:03:03,097
- A pound on Thornton against the squire.
- Go away!

958
02:03:05,332 --> 02:03:08,571
- How about a drink?
- The drink will be on the house.

959
02:03:08,806 --> 02:03:13,777
That's a good idea. The people of Ballyglon are comin'
over by bus, thousands of them.

960
02:03:13,977 --> 02:03:17,816
That's a good idea, not that I'm tired.
I'm as fresh as a daisy.

961
02:03:18,017 --> 02:03:21,287
You look more like a black-eyed Susan to me. Let's go.

962
02:03:21,754 --> 02:03:25,624
- Is that a public house?
- Yes, your lordship.

963
02:03:25,825 --> 02:03:27,828
- Are they going in?
- Yes, your lordship.

964
02:03:28,028 --> 02:03:33,203
- Does that mean that the fight's over?
- No, that's just the end of round one.

965
02:03:35,904 --> 02:03:37,874
Come, keep away, keep away!

966
02:03:45,583 --> 02:03:51,424
Whiskey? No, that'll be too warm,
it'll get your blood up. Porter is the very thing.

967
02:03:51,657 --> 02:03:55,997
- Ah, it's peaceful and quiet in here, isn't it?
- Yeah.

968
02:03:56,197 --> 02:03:57,900
You know...

969
02:04:00,668 --> 02:04:03,139
This has been a fight I'd come a long way to see.

970
02:04:03,339 --> 02:04:05,942
I hope you can stick around for the finish.

971
02:04:07,342 --> 02:04:09,980
Don't worry about that!

972
02:04:13,217 --> 02:04:18,891
- You know, Yank. I've taken quite a likin' to you.
- I'm gettin' real fond of you, too.

973
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:24,064
Your widow, me sister... She could've done a lot worse.

974
02:04:24,264 --> 02:04:26,234
- True, true.
- Poor woman.

975
02:04:26,469 --> 02:04:30,138
- Thanks, fill them up again.
- You buy me no drinks.

976
02:04:30,338 --> 02:04:34,810
- The drinks are on the house, sir.
- I'm takin' no drinks from you, squint.

977
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:39,050
- I'm buyin' the drinks.
- You can buy me a drink at your wake.

978
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:41,219
And not before.

979
02:04:43,355 --> 02:04:45,059
I'm buyin'!

980
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:51,900
Bar towel!

981
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:58,407
- What time is it?
- Half past five, sir.

982
02:05:05,082 --> 02:05:06,351
Lord, he beat you!

983
02:05:16,497 --> 02:05:22,770
Why... I hope you won't be vexed with me,
but I've lost three pounds to Mrs Delany.

984
02:05:23,004 --> 02:05:25,574
I know I shouldn't have bet but...

985
02:05:25,808 --> 02:05:28,578
There you are, Stuffy, 15 pounds.

986
02:05:31,248 --> 02:05:35,020
- Hello there, Elizabeth.
- Your lordship.

987
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:40,227
- And what have you been doing all day?
- If you'll excuse me, I'll...

988
02:05:40,427 --> 02:05:43,262
I'll get your tea, Snuffy.

989
02:05:45,633 --> 02:05:49,704
# There was a wild colonial boy

990
02:05:49,904 --> 02:05:53,109
# Jack Duggan was his name

991
02:05:53,309 --> 02:05:57,449
# He was born and bred in Ireland

992
02:05:57,649 --> 02:06:01,420
# In a place called Castlemaine

993
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:05,558
# He was his father's only son

994
02:06:05,758 --> 02:06:09,263
# His mother's pride and joy

995
02:06:09,463 --> 02:06:13,467
# And dearly did his parents love

996
02:06:13,667 --> 02:06:18,040
# This wild colonial boy

997
02:06:29,488 --> 02:06:33,593
Woman of the house! I brought the brother home to supper.

998
02:06:34,894 --> 02:06:37,597
He's kindly welcome.

999
02:06:38,833 --> 02:06:40,802
God bless all in this house.

1000
02:06:41,002 --> 02:06:42,871
- Wipe your feet.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1001
02:06:43,071 --> 02:06:46,677
Sit down, sit down. That's what chairs are for.

1002
02:06:51,883 --> 02:06:54,185
Hurry it up!

1003
02:07:01,327 --> 02:07:06,835
Well, then. So peace and quiet came once again to Inisfree,

1004
02:07:07,035 --> 02:07:10,407
and we were... Good heavens, what's that woman up to now.?

1005
02:07:10,607 --> 02:07:14,010
Make way, she'll be runnin'you down with that.!

1006
02:07:24,122 --> 02:07:27,660
When the Reverend Mr Playfair comes down,

1007
02:07:27,861 --> 02:07:31,466
I want us all to cheer like Protestants. Now, spread out!

1008
02:07:45,183 --> 02:07:47,084
(CROWD CHEERS)

1009
02:07:47,284 --> 02:07:51,490
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

1010
02:08:06,043 --> 02:08:12,081
No patty fingers, if you please.
The proprieties at all times.

1011
02:08:13,951 --> 02:08:16,354
Hold on to your hats. Come on.
