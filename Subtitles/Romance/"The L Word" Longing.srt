1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The L Word - ep104 - Longing

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:07,423
I told you, don't move.

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,267
Let your, um, let your
arms fall by your sides.

4
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:23,686
That's beautiful.

5
00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:15,974
Oh, god damn it.

6
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:17,825
What?

7
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:19,325
I thought you set the alarm.

8
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:21,804
I did, you snoozed it.

9
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,208
I'm late for my fucking dumb-ass job.

10
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,814
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:28,772
Fuck.

12
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,173
Do you want me to make us coffee?

13
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:32,449
No, thanks, I'll get some on the way.

14
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:36,476
So are we gonna get
together later or what?

15
00:02:37,228 --> 00:02:38,928
I have a screening with Joanie.

16
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:41,965
But I'll call you.

17
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,010
Bye...

18
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,347
Ho tanto da fare oggi.
(I'm really busy today)

19
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,300
Hey.

20
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:41,848
Can I speak to you please?

21
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,346
Sure. I'll be right there. Wait a minute?

22
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:48,016
Due bicchieri d'acqua per la tre.
(Two glasses of water for table 3)

23
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:51,662
Do you want some coffee?

24
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,809
No. Thank you.

25
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:06,259
Finally, "The Flagellation" by Dalmas Howe
deals with the dichotomy between

26
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,240
man as divine and man as creature.

27
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:13,358
The painting, which is large in
scale and classical in its execution

28
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:18,804
attempts to record the artist's experiences
through juxtaposition in narrative.

29
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:23,445
Richard Morrisey has called
this piece "a revelation."

30
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:30,646
"Provocations" is intended
to do just that: Provoke.

31
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:34,944
It is daring, it is intense, and it is
the edge we have been looking for.

32
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:39,242
And with a little finessing, it will
be the C.A.C.'s spring exhibition.

33
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:42,543
Isn't that our slot for the impressionists?

34
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:47,487
Yes, but we've show "Impressions in Winter"
for the last 5 years in a row.

35
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:50,352
I thought this year we would
wow them with something different.

36
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:54,631
We can't move the impressionists.
Everybody loves the impressionists.

37
00:04:55,861 --> 00:05:01,161
Well, the impressionists notwithstanding, you
hired me to create a new profile for the C.A.C.

38
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:05,957
Now, the "Provocations" exhibit will put us
on the map. It premieres at Mona in New York,

39
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,157
then after the C.A.C. it moves on to the
Walker and then to London's Tate Modern.

40
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:15,612
Okay, well just assuming for a moment that we
were willing to forego "Impressions in Winter",

41
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,899
despite the fact that it's our most
popular exhibit bar none, uh, for this,

42
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,167
cause celebre out of New York. What makes
you think you can procure it for the C.A.C.?

43
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:31,187
Well, I've set up a meeting with Gina Ferrara, who
is the curator of the Peggy Peabody collection.

44
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:35,885
I know that both MOCA and LACMA are after it,
but I'm completely confident that I can talk -

45
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:41,086
Bette, it is obvious that you have gone to a great
deal of trouble to prepare for this presentation.

46
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,690
But, it isn't worth the risk.

47
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,144
"Impressions in Winter" is ...
is too important to us.

48
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,390
With all due respect, Franklin...

49
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:59,849
if I'm not the one selecting the shows,
then I don't understand what I'm here for.

50
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,730
To do what's best for the C.A.C.
I would think that would be fairly obvious.

51
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:09,547
Now what I need you to do is to follow up with
Sheldon Tomlin over at Hoyt and iron out the details.

52
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,280
We wouldn't want one of our
rivals running off with "Impressions"

53
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:13,883
because we were a little slow
on the uptake, now would we?

54
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:16,648
Wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry. Follow up?

55
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,580
Yeah.

56
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,559
You've booked it already?

57
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,629
I, uh, happened to have lunch with Shelly last
week and I... I thought I'd save you the time.

58
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:29,162
Well, everyone, thanks, and uh, how 'bout,
uh, thanking Miss Porter for all her hard work.

59
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:30,774
Great job!

60
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:41,996
Do you want to go to my office?

61
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,720
No. This is just gonna take a minute.

62
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,542
Hey! How are ya?

63
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:46,958
Hey!

64
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,495
Hey Jenny!

65
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:50,683
Can we go into your office, please?

66
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:51,451
Yeah, sure.

67
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,722
Thank you. Okay. Shane.

68
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:53,975
Hey, Jenny, how are you?

69
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,400
Whatever. Can we have our table?

70
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:00,996
Did you see that?

71
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,319
You can't tell me, right?

72
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:07,107
Right, Al, I can't tell you.

73
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,966
What's on your mind, Jenny?

74
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:21,384
I can't be around you. Anymore. It's
confusing to me and it makes me feel insane.

75
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:27,987
You know, Tim has been so wonderful to me.

76
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:37,679
And I think this is the very first time
in my life... that I've actually felt safe.

77
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,447
Do you want to be safe?

78
00:07:58,475 --> 00:07:59,975
I'm gonna marry Tim.

79
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:05,189
I can't imagine my life without him.

80
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:09,664
I don't want to imagine my life without him.

81
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,119
Is that what you want?

82
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:18,178
Yes. That is what I want.

83
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,286
Then I wish you well.

84
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:38,081
I'm gonna get another, you okay?

85
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:41,548
Hey Gabby, you're so fine,
you're so fine you blow my mind...

86
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,952
Easy with the 80s pop
this early in the morning.

87
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:46,423
Hey Gabby, hey Gabby.

88
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:51,458
Tell me you didn't.

89
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,706
Okay. Think what you will, she's amazing.

90
00:08:56,605 --> 00:09:00,305
She's amazing-looking, she's
amazingly smart, she's amazing in bed.

91
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,478
She treats you like shit.

92
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,906
No, she doesn't.

93
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:04,108
She does.

94
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,825
No, not this time. Totally changed.

95
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:11,301
I don't know, Alice, she still seems
pretty cold in the streets to me.

96
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:14,824
Cold in the streets, hot in the sheets.

97
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:20,303
She's happier! She's writing her lesbian
cops screenplay. She's a whole new Gabby.

98
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:21,853
What?

99
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:23,969
Nothing, nothing.

100
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,937
No, no, no, not saying
"nothing" with that face.

101
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:33,386
Allright, let - let's say hypothetically that ...

102
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:37,853
I saw Gabby all over Nadia
Miertschin ... on Thursday night.

103
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,533
Where?

104
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:40,965
Milk.

105
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:42,883
What were they doing?

106
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:48,097
I... I'd prefer not to give
you the details this time.

107
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,444
Hey...

108
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:13,264
Hey!

109
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,630
Oh, my god! Oh - oh, my god, I'm sorry, I -

110
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:17,677
It's okay.

111
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:18,807
Ah, Jesus, you're disfigured!

112
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:19,535
I'm not disfigured.

113
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,907
But I could've killed you!
When you were... you know...

114
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:22,951
It happens all the time.

115
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:23,817
Well, should we call a doctor -

116
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:25,196
Dana!

117
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:28,611
Second-degree burn from the béchamel sauce.

118
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,686
Run-away shish-kabob.

119
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:36,483
An attack from a particularly hostile
live lobster, and, um, electric can-opener.

120
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:38,813
Is there anything I can do?

121
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:42,487
You could kiss it and make it better.

122
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:50,753
I was wondering if maybe some -

123
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:52,059
I would love to.

124
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,238
Really?

125
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,319
Okay.

126
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:59,054
Okay! Is Thursday night okay?

127
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,101
Thursday night is great.

128
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:02,642
Where do you wanna go?

129
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:03,635
Anywhere you're going.

130
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:05,198
Yeah, but you're a food person.

131
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,506
So, I want to take you someplace
really good. Like L'Orangerie.

132
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:10,134
No, no, no, that's way too expensive.

133
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,949
I know. I'll take care of it.

134
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,627
We're not starting out that way.

135
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,659
There's - there's this little place in Koreatown
that I've been dying to check out.

136
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:21,316
Do I need to make a reservation?

137
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:24,823
How about if I take care of that
part, and you just pick me up at 8?

138
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,879
Okay.

139
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:27,171
Okay.

140
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:28,737
Okay.

141
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:29,812
Okay.

142
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,207
Okay, bye.

143
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,816
Hey!

144
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,269
Yeah?

145
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,148
Thanks for asking me out.

146
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:39,908
Oh yeah, no problem.

147
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,442
Yeah, Gina Ferrara please, it's Bette Porter.

148
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:48,973
We're having drinks.

149
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:54,588
No, can you just let her know that I got
her message and the Four Seasons is fine?

150
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:57,847
You brought dinner.

151
00:11:58,832 --> 00:11:59,832
You going out?

152
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:01,563
I have a drinks meeting.

153
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,271
The board didn't go for it.

154
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:05,343
What?

155
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:09,198
Hello, is Greg Massey in? Yeah,
it's Bette Porter from the C.A.C.

156
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:11,954
Yes, I'll hold.

157
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:16,629
No - can you just, uh, have him
call me back, please. Thanks.

158
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,358
I hate them all.

159
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,309
They didn't go for "Provocations"?

160
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,260
Yah, and then to pour salt on the wound,

161
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:28,576
Franklin went behind my back
and booked "Impressions in Winter."

162
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:30,357
So, who're you having drinks with?

163
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:33,238
Gina Ferrara, the curator of
the Peggy Peabody collection.

164
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:36,959
I thought you said they didn't go for it?

165
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,459
I'm not rolling over.

166
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:42,435
Right after the meeting, I called Sheldon Tomlin,
and I unbooked the impressionists show,

167
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:45,375
and now I'm gonna go prostrate
myself to a woman who hates my guts.

168
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:47,313
Why does Gina Ferrara hate you?

169
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:51,475
We had a run-in over an artist,
Megan Friedman, when we were both gallerists.

170
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:53,133
That sculptor you slept with?

171
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:56,325
And she's hated me ever since.

172
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:58,432
So Gina Ferrara is a lesbian.

173
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:06,830
No... she wanted the show, I got it, and now
she hates me. But, I am gonna kiss her ass.

174
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:13,027
She's lucky.

175
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:30,058
Hey Jen. Hey, it's me, listen.
I had a really shitty day.

176
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,881
Uh, my 200 yard free relay team ate some
bad sushi, they were up all night puking.

177
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:39,099
Trish is now officially on academic
probation, so, if you get the message,

178
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,978
I'm at The Planet, I miss you,
I hope you join me. Bye.

179
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,728
Anyone else?

180
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:58,765
C'mon.

181
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:00,437
No.

182
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:02,532
Come on.

183
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:05,416
No, I'm obviously no match for you.

184
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,601
Well, you never know until you try.

185
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:38,518
Hey!

186
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:40,118
Hi!

187
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:43,034
How are ya?

188
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,105
You know Nadia.

189
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:45,761
Yeah, hey!

190
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:46,481
Hey.

191
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:48,482
Oh, my god. Have you seen this?

192
00:14:57,587 --> 00:15:01,187
Lacey. Looks like Shane finally
tangled with the wrong crazy bitch.

193
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:03,506
There's like a whole stack
of them over by the door.

194
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Gabby? Gabby.

195
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:12,068
I was kind of hoping we could be alone.

196
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,254
We can be alone with we're dead.

197
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:20,627
Is that Fiona over there? I can't believe
she'd even show her face in here.

198
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,310
Tim. Tim! Your phone is ringing.

199
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:31,844
Can you get it?

200
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:36,781
Hello?

201
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:37,782
Tim?

202
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:41,457
Who is this?

203
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,300
Hi Jenny. It's Marina.

204
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,412
Where's Tim?

205
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:49,098
Yeah, Tim is playing pool, he
asked me to answer the phone.

206
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:53,762
I don't think she's happy.

207
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,135
Jenny?

208
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,441
She got cut off.

209
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,620
I guess she'll call back.

210
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:09,877
Yesss!

211
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:11,339
Did you just hustle me?

212
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:12,712
Yesss!

213
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:49,656
Jen!

214
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:50,949
Hey!

215
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:53,904
You okay?

216
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,981
Jenny?

217
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,508
Jenny, what's going on?

218
00:17:04,142 --> 00:17:05,842
Jenny, can you hear me?

219
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:08,848
Jenny, baby, can you hear me?

220
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:12,204
Can you hear what I'm saying?
Everybody, get back, give her some air.

221
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,235
She's coming around. I gotta
get her something for her head.

222
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:21,931
Jen. Hey. It's okay. It's allright.

223
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:26,719
It's okay.

224
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:48,164
What happened to her?

225
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:50,628
She passed out.

226
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:52,381
Was she drinking or something?

227
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:53,408
I don't know.

228
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:56,164
But somebody else was.

229
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,530
You're kidding.

230
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,041
Why didn't you stop her?

231
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:07,993
It's not my place.

232
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:09,771
How was your meeting?

233
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:13,835
There was an accident on La Cienega,
I got there 15 minutes late, she'd left already.

234
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:15,585
Oh, babe. I'm sorry.

235
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,085
We're going to reschedule tomorrow.

236
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:20,153
C'mon. Let's get you something to eat.

237
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:34,155
Well, we're definitely getting
you in to a doctor tomorrow.

238
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:37,054
It's low blood sugar.

239
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:38,849
You scared me, you know.

240
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,067
Well, you know, you fucked everything up
because you decided to go to The Planet

241
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:45,163
while I was making you dinner,
and go and flirt with Marina.

242
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:47,931
Don't be ridiculous.

243
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:49,618
Well, what were you doing, Tim?

244
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:50,497
Playing pool.

245
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:52,107
With your arms around each other.

246
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:53,626
You know, that's exactly right.

247
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:57,737
We were making out right there in the middle
of The Planet while everyone was watching.

248
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,807
You need to get some sleep.

249
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,240
Bette Porter's office.

250
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:26,371
Hi James, it's me. Can you just, uh,
forward my calls to my cell? Thanks.

251
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:27,665
Hey guys, check this out.

252
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,234
Oh, my god, it's the Unabomber.

253
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,311
What's going on?

254
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:35,033
Lacey is on some sort of rampage.
She's putting these all over town.

255
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:38,143
You guys, you guys, there's a
giant billboard of Shane on Sunset.

256
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:40,573
Just kidding.

257
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:44,394
So how's your lady friend?

258
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,721
Good. I have my date tonight!

259
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:49,194
Oh, my god, Dana's got a date.

260
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,382
What are you wearing?

261
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:54,021
Well, I was thinking of wearing
that - that blue sundress, you know

262
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:55,450
Nooo.

263
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,147
No.

264
00:19:57,148 --> 00:19:57,775
What!

265
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,147
How many times do I have
to tell you no sundresses?

266
00:20:00,937 --> 00:20:03,537
But I'm going to a nice play,
y'know, somebody might see me.

267
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:06,881
One guy recognizes you, and all of
a sudden you're like Tiger Woods.

268
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,827
Bite my head off, god...

269
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:12,619
Jesus, Al, it's not Dana's fault
Gabby's macking on Nadia Miertschin.

270
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,696
Oh, god, Nadia Miertschin, I hate that girl.

271
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:19,564
I've been introduced to her, like, 24 times
and she never remembers my name.

272
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:23,503
Didn't she... try to hit up on
you once, Nadia Miertschin?

273
00:20:23,711 --> 00:20:25,511
She was drunk. Still...

274
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,340
It has to end.

275
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:32,918
But seriously, Alice, you can't let
Gabby continue to treat you this way.

276
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:36,331
You guys don't know her. I know it
looks like she's treating me like shit, but...

277
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,312
it's - she's just, y'know -

278
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:39,747
Treating you like shit, Al.

279
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,908
Maybe. It's just -

280
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:45,451
No. It's just you deserve better.

281
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:46,951
I do?

282
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,968
Allright, I do. But...

283
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:53,023
I just feel like at times, y'know,
she's, like, so right there,

284
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:57,024
and I feel like we connect and then, all
of a sudden, she acts like I don't even exist.

285
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:59,390
That's because she's an emotional cripple.

286
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,437
Yeah. Emotional cripple slash
narcissistic personality disorder.

287
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:07,349
And the next time she calls
you? You have to end it.

288
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,043
I know. It's just -

289
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:11,238
It's just nothing.

290
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:14,069
What are you gonna do?

291
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,783
Well, I was gonna ask her -

292
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:16,496
No asking.

293
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:17,890
What are you gonna tell her?

294
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:20,558
You're gonna say, "Gabby, I really
enjoy the time we've spent together,

295
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,498
but it is obvious to me that we
are in different places in our lives

296
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,583
and we want different
things out of a relationship,

297
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,208
and I respect myself too much to let
you continue to treat me this way."

298
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:31,835
"It's clear to me now that
you are an emotional cripple

299
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:34,827
without any kind of capacity
to understand true love."

300
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,649
"And I'm no longer willing to
waste my valuable time on you."

301
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,298
"So step off, bitch!"

302
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:42,673
You can do it!

303
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:45,209
Hello?

304
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:48,753
Gina! Hey! I am so sorry about last night.

305
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:51,255
I hope you got the message,
there was this terrible accident...

306
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:55,338
Yeah. I'm really looking forward to talking to
you about "Provocations," I think that the...

307
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:03,291
Oh really?

308
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:10,252
Well, is there any way that I could get you to
reconsider because I think that the C.A.C. ...

309
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,001
Okay.

310
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:18,412
Allright.

311
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:21,311
No, no, no, no, thank you.

312
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:23,725
Bye.

313
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:25,855
What happened?

314
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:30,254
"Provocations" went to MOCA.

315
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:34,006
That's where Gina was last night while I was
sitting alone at the bar at The Four Seasons.

316
00:22:34,615 --> 00:22:36,815
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

317
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:39,328
I knew Gina would screw me.

318
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:42,522
I am so fucked.

319
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:45,752
Is there anyone who can overrule her?

320
00:22:45,753 --> 00:22:49,121
Just Peggy Peabody,
the billionairess raving lunatic.

321
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:51,495
Peggy Peabody? Unified Steel heiress?

322
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,511
Yeah.

323
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:55,746
She's in town, y'know. She's staying
at the Las Alemendros, Santa Barbara.

324
00:22:55,747 --> 00:23:00,642
She's on some crazy art-buying spree.
Spent like $6.3 million bucks yesterday.

325
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:01,732
How do you know all of this?

326
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:04,931
I was eavesdropping at L.A. Magazine.

327
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:10,092
Do you guys know they want me to do
a story on the 45-minute orgasm? As if?

328
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,289
I mean, by definition, there's
short and intense, right?

329
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,237
Bette Porter's office.

330
00:23:14,238 --> 00:23:19,615
Hi, James? Can you, uh, get me directions
for the Los Alamendros in Santa Barbara?

331
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:21,824
Franklin found out you passed
on "Impressions in Winter".

332
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:22,859
What else?

333
00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:27,421
Well, he's in a rage that you
left the office in a time of crisis.

334
00:23:27,422 --> 00:23:28,900
Tell him to bite me.

335
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:30,092
I don't think I can say that.

336
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:32,472
You know, tell him that all great
art is a response to small-minded,

337
00:23:32,473 --> 00:23:36,207
corporate fascists trying to impose
their ignorance on the sheep-like masses.

338
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,120
Why don't I just tell him you
have a dentist appointment?

339
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:42,533
Just tell him it's not over until it's over. Okay,
call me back with the directions. Thanks.

340
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,543
You're going to Santa Barbara?

341
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:51,432
Good luck.

342
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,920
Hi, how are you?

343
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,420
Hey, how ya doing?

344
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,191
Hey, word to the wise,
watch out for that woman.

345
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:13,869
Ma'am, how're you doing, keep an
eye on your daughter, you never know.

346
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:17,285
Hi. Heads up.

347
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:27,135
So what do you think? I learned Photoshop.

348
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:32,152
Lace, what are you doing?

349
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,133
Whatever I feel like. Isn't that what you do?

350
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Allright. Enough. C'mon.

351
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,321
I think we have a big misunderstanding.

352
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:46,080
I mean, you and me had a
really great time together, but -

353
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:48,441
I know, that's why I don't
understand what happened.

354
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,562
Babe, nothing happened.

355
00:24:51,677 --> 00:24:54,377
Okay? It's just about having a good
time and enjoying each other's company.

356
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:56,026
I know, but then you
went off with the other girl.

357
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,035
Yeah.

358
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:00,612
I don't see what the problem is with that.

359
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:05,818
Look, Lace, you're beautiful.

360
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:07,973
And I like you a lot.

361
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:09,984
But...

362
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:11,848
I like a lot of people.

363
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,979
What does she have that I don't have?

364
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,995
Nothing. It's not about having
something or not having something.

365
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,437
Did you like fucking her better?

366
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:28,003
No.

367
00:25:31,303 --> 00:25:33,203
Because I really liked fucking you.

368
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,319
Yeah, I liked fucking you, too, Lace.

369
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:40,385
So then, what's the problem?

370
00:25:43,552 --> 00:25:45,652
I don't do relationships.

371
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:50,745
I'm not asking for a relationship.

372
00:25:57,128 --> 00:26:00,128
W - wait - don't... hey, don't cry.

373
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,670
I am not crying.

374
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:04,426
Yes, you are...

375
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:07,493
I hate it when girls cry, allright? C'mere.

376
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,714
C'mere.

377
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:13,219
I just really like you, is all.

378
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:16,444
Yeah, I like you, too. I do.

379
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,091
I guess I got carried away with the
posters and fliers and... the banner.

380
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:26,851
You, you mean - you made banners?

381
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Just one. But they wouldn't
let me hang it at Girl Bar.

382
00:26:32,844 --> 00:26:34,444
Honey, you have a lot of feelings.

383
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:36,365
I know, but then you
went off with the other girl!

384
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:39,044
No, no, no, shhh... don't,
don't, please, don't, don't...

385
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,575
Forget about it, okay,
don't even think about that.

386
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:46,201
I don't want a relationship with you,
I just want to be with you all the time.

387
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:57,819
Oh, hey, oh... Oh, I am so
dumb. I am always doing this.

388
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,067
I just want to know why
everybody always abandons me.

389
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:04,025
Wait, no one's abandoning you.

390
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:07,806
Everybody leaves.

391
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:11,636
My father left when I was 5.

392
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:13,811
My mom died.

393
00:27:16,116 --> 00:27:17,416
My sister...

394
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:20,654
What happened with your sister?

395
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:22,516
She moved to West Covina.

396
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,400
I'm not going anywhere, okay?
I'm not going anywhere.

397
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:34,074
Okay?

398
00:27:34,075 --> 00:27:34,600
Okay.

399
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:35,928
Yeah?

400
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:37,243
Yeah.

401
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:38,812
Allright?

402
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:27,762
Al, it's Dana. Al. Alice!
Don't worry, I'm wearing pants.

403
00:28:28,535 --> 00:28:32,735
No, they're not patterned.
Look, I'll call you after, okay?

404
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,561
I'm not gonna have - hold on. Just hold on.

405
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:47,968
I'll be right down.

406
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:49,574
Okay, look, she's coming, I gotta go.

407
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:56,695
No, I'm not going to have sex with her tonight,
it's our first date, god! I'll call you later, bye.

408
00:28:58,859 --> 00:28:59,859
Hi.

409
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:02,648
I overdressed.

410
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:05,511
No, no...

411
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:07,131
Oh, god, I feel like such a geek.

412
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:09,815
No, no, I... my friends made me wear this.

413
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:11,064
What?

414
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:16,268
My friends said that they thought that you would
think I was a geek if, you know, if I wore a dress.

415
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:17,897
So, I am a geek.

416
00:29:17,898 --> 00:29:21,497
No, I'm a geek. For letting my
friends tell me what to wear.

417
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:26,292
Well, I could go change...
so you don't feel so geeky.

418
00:29:26,568 --> 00:29:28,468
No, you look beautiful.

419
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:35,676
Oh, god, see? That was
totally... I'm just a total geek.

420
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:37,777
I'm just -

421
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:41,591
Shall we go?

422
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,500
Yeah.

423
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,328
Thank you Sir.

424
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:54,904
Hello, and welcome to
Los Alamendros. How may I help you?

425
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:57,100
Yes, I'm here to see Mrs. Peabody.

426
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:58,358
The code word?

427
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:02,121
You need a secret code
to see Peggy Peabody?

428
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,530
That's correct.

429
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:05,668
Shazam...

430
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:09,857
Perhaps you'd like to leave a note?

431
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:15,248
That's her, isn't it? Right?

432
00:30:15,462 --> 00:30:16,662
Mrs. Peabody?

433
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,861
Mrs. Peabody? Hi...

434
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:28,177
Well. My driver was late. That's my
excuse, and it's going to have to stand.

435
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:31,852
You have so much traffic in this infernal
city, I don't know how you stand it.

436
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,345
Well, you get used to it, actually.

437
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:35,518
Absurd. Penthouse.

438
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:39,404
C'mere. Hold him for me, would you?

439
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:47,593
Go away! Don't come back!

440
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,321
I let José off.

441
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:53,504
José?

442
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:57,710
Well, he's my helper. He's in love with
this girl who works for the Weintraubs.

443
00:30:57,711 --> 00:31:03,204
Or is it the Fleischmans, I'm
not certain. Mad, obsessive love!

444
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:08,584
I told him, "Go! Be in love! Take
the night, show her the sea."

445
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:11,061
I think people in love should see the sea.

446
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:11,996
Mrs. Peabody, I'm -

447
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:17,032
Oh, call me Peggy. I don't like "Mrs.",
it's so frumpy. Like I'm an old mare.

448
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:18,738
Peggy...

449
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:20,989
You're here about the Kandinsky.

450
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,031
Kandinsky?

451
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:22,863
What're you drinking?

452
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:24,406
Um, nothing, I'm fine.

453
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:27,762
Nonsense. I had this
ridiculous drink the other night.

454
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:33,731
José made it for me. Mango juice
and vodka, I think. Just ridiculous.

455
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:34,925
José!

456
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,200
I think José is out. At the sea.

457
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:39,293
Of course.

458
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:40,338
He's in love.

459
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:41,174
Right!

460
00:31:41,174 --> 00:31:46,774
Now. This drink has a very salutary effect.

461
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,010
It's called "Roadkill." See if you like it.

462
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:57,709
Yum.

463
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:01,387
Mm! Delicious!

464
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:04,104
So, when can I see it?

465
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:05,329
See what?

466
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,900
The Kandinsky. You have a reputation for
driving a very hard bargain, Miss Reynolds.

467
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:13,152
I think you have me confused with someone -

468
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:14,310
But I will have it.

469
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:15,878
I - I'm afraid that you
have me confused with -

470
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:19,362
How does this damned thing
work. Oh! Nasty little machine.

471
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:23,585
This is Miss Peabody's room.
Leave a message at the tone.

472
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,284
Hi Peggy. This is Abby Reynolds.

473
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:31,086
I'm so sorry, but I'm going to have to
cancel on our appointment this evening.

474
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:33,322
Let's reschedule the talk about the Kandinsky.

475
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:41,566
Who the hell are you?

476
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:45,111
I've been trying to tell you I'm...

477
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:51,208
I'm Bette Porter, and I am the
director of the California Arts Center.

478
00:32:55,041 --> 00:33:00,641
California... oh. Oh, yes, that
little museum in Bergamot Station.

479
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:02,168
Right.

480
00:33:02,317 --> 00:33:03,517
Obscure.

481
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,790
And that will all change, soon.

482
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:11,589
Especially if you, in your... infinite wisdom, decide
that the "Provocations" exhibit should go -

483
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,036
You're the lesbian!

484
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:15,516
Excuse me?

485
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,640
The lesbian museum director.

486
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:19,115
I'm sorry...

487
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:21,469
I was a lesbian in 1974.

488
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:24,594
Just 1974?

489
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,810
Just 1974.

490
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:29,895
That was all I needed.

491
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,800
Well, you know, that is what
we refer to as a... "has-bian."

492
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:44,283
A "has-bian".

493
00:33:46,321 --> 00:33:50,821
That's hilarious! I must tell Joanne that one.

494
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:58,017
Are you hungry? I'm just famished!
Why don't you order us something...

495
00:33:58,146 --> 00:33:59,646
... from the menu here.

496
00:34:00,678 --> 00:34:02,078
Thank you.

497
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,280
Hey, stranger!

498
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:20,682
You ran out the other night.

499
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,285
Yeah, uh, well, twelve's a crowd.

500
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:28,331
I know, and I'm so sorry, it was just that
I missed Clarissa's birthday the other night,

501
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,470
and then Nadia called, and then before
I knew it, it was like a whole, big, you know -

502
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:33,371
I know about you and Nadia.

503
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:35,145
There's nothing to know.

504
00:34:35,513 --> 00:34:37,613
Half of Hollywood saw
you guys making out.

505
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:42,211
That was nothing. Alice,
it meant nothing to me.

506
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,273
Ok, here's you... and here's
the lies you're telling me

507
00:34:47,523 --> 00:34:51,223
Okay. I won't see her anymore. Swear.

508
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,159
It's just, I -

509
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,383
You and me are really good together. We're
both writers, we're on an intellectual par...

510
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:02,539
I can't have the same kind of conversations
with Nadia that I have with you.

511
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:08,205
Gabby...

512
00:35:09,778 --> 00:35:12,178
I've really enjoyed the
time we've spent together.

513
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:15,539
But, it's obvious you and I
are on two different levels,

514
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:18,746
and we really want two different
things out of a relationship.

515
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:23,483
I respect myself too much
to let you treat me like this.

516
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:25,554
Are you serious?

517
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:29,496
And it's pretty clear you're... like
some sort of an emotional cripple...

518
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:32,443
... without the capacity to
understand true love, and...

519
00:35:33,082 --> 00:35:40,782
I, uh... I... I'm not gonna let you...
waste my valuable time, and, uh...

520
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,539
Step off, bitch.

521
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:48,935
Emotional cripple, where'd
you get that? "Dr. Phil"?

522
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:50,853
Why don't you get out of my house.

523
00:35:50,854 --> 00:35:53,154
What ev'! Suit yourself.

524
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:56,429
But I think you should know, Alice, this
is not a good move for someone like you.

525
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:58,768
Everyone knows you're desperate.

526
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:00,651
I'm not gonna bounce back from this.

527
00:36:40,711 --> 00:36:41,211
Oh, hey!

528
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:42,712
Hey.

529
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:44,320
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

530
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:46,564
Good, good, good.

531
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:49,120
Are you working? I don't want
to bother you if you're working.

532
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:54,370
No, no. I haven't really, uh...
I haven't been able to focus.

533
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:56,349
But I'm - I'm doing good.

534
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:58,543
No more dizziness?

535
00:36:58,544 --> 00:37:00,481
Mm-mm, no.

536
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:04,911
I don't know what happened, I was just
sort of... standing there, watching Tim, and...

537
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:06,182
Marina.

538
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:08,857
Marina.

539
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,641
Y'know, Jenny, I know it's
none of my business, but,

540
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:19,501
I wanted to tell you that if you wanted
to talk to someone... about anything...

541
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:21,656
you can talk to me if you want to.

542
00:37:22,303 --> 00:37:27,703
I know, um... how... intense this can... be.

543
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:30,059
Keeping it pent-up can make it worse.

544
00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:33,076
It's no wonder you passed out.

545
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:35,809
I don't know what you're talking about.

546
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,570
Okay.

547
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,730
I'm sorry.

548
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:51,105
Hey... Did uh...

549
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,586
Did... did Marina say something to you?

550
00:37:54,587 --> 00:37:56,940
No. She didn't.

551
00:37:58,665 --> 00:38:04,965
Look, I know it doesn't seem this way, but
this can be a small town. Sometimes it's...

552
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:08,439
Okay. Because, you know,
whatever you heard, it's just...

553
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:12,238
it's a lie, you know. It's just a rumor.

554
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,992
The lesbian community... can just
be a hotbed of rumor and innuendo.

555
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:24,021
I mean, you could look at someone and
25 people would know about it within an hour.

556
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:25,021
Okay.

557
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:30,261
If Marina... confided in
someone, I'm sure it was just...

558
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:33,715
as simple as saying she
was attracted to you, and...

559
00:38:35,483 --> 00:38:38,083
I just can't believe she did that, you know...

560
00:38:38,637 --> 00:38:40,937
I... I didn't say she did. I...

561
00:38:40,938 --> 00:38:41,651
Thank you.

562
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,568
... just saying... word travels.

563
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:48,421
Thank you very much.

564
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:08,230
Photography is my new passion. I bought a
Salvador Dali etching this week, and a Duchamp.

565
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:14,049
But my favorite purchase, by far,
is my new Carla Marie Freed.

566
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:20,250
Oh, god, she was brilliant.
She was completely brilliant.

567
00:39:20,822 --> 00:39:23,122
Poor, wretched addict.

568
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:31,496
What is your favorite
Carla Marie Freed photograph?

569
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:33,858
That's, just, that's so difficult, I...

570
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:40,132
Oh, please, don't be such a pussy. Favorite
Carla Marie Freed photograph, post haste!

571
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:51,346
I - I would ha - I would have to say,
it - it's "The Last Time I and You"

572
00:39:54,503 --> 00:39:58,203
I've never seen the original. I mean,
she destroyed all of her negs, you know.

573
00:39:58,627 --> 00:40:01,427
Even the reproductions are just...

574
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:09,310
I mean, she photographed
the same woman for 12 years.

575
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:11,963
Can you imagine that?

576
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:19,078
I mean, you - can you
imagine that act of... looking.

577
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,080
Looking, and seeing, and re-seeing.

578
00:40:23,826 --> 00:40:26,626
Just to try to get to the truth of someone.

579
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:35,338
Y'know, I mean, there is incredible mystery,
and - and passion in that work. You know?

580
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:42,691
I met her just before she died.

581
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:48,327
Yeah, it was in some little bistro in
New York. She was high as a kite.

582
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:55,646
And, you know, I was introduced to her,
and... uh... she told me to go fuck myself.

583
00:40:57,507 --> 00:40:59,107
I totally loved her.

584
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:00,130
Oh, that's funny.

585
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:02,199
Just loved her.

586
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:04,416
Loved her.

587
00:41:13,128 --> 00:41:15,228
C'mere. Follow me.

588
00:41:19,837 --> 00:41:21,137
Close your eyes.

589
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,381
Keep them closed!

590
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:30,349
Open 'em.

591
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,100
I'm so happy.

592
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,330
Where you going?

593
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:55,933
You promised.

594
00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:01,629
Allright.

595
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:03,396
See ya.

596
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:08,123
Be good, okay?

597
00:43:31,395 --> 00:43:35,495
You can't imagine how
jealous I am of you right now.

598
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:40,445
You've been waiting to burst into tears
and make a complete fool of yourself?

599
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,393
You - you know Stendahl?

600
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:43,543
The French art critic.

601
00:43:43,544 --> 00:43:47,292
He went to Florence. He saw the Caravaggio.

602
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:50,256
And then he burst into tears, and then he fainted.

603
00:43:50,257 --> 00:43:54,324
The work of art was so beautiful and
moving, he couldn't withstand the impact.

604
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,451
The "Stendahl Syndrome".

605
00:43:56,452 --> 00:44:00,513
"My head thrown back, I let
my gaze dwell on the ceiling.

606
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:05,613
I underwent the profoundest experience
of ecstacy I had ever encountered."

607
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:15,207
"I had obtained... that supreme degree of
sensibility where the divine intimations of art

608
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:21,760
merge with the impassioned
sensuality... of emotion."

609
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:35,018
You have utterly exhausted me.

610
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:36,797
I have to go to sleep.

611
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:39,348
Mrs. Peabody - Peggy...

612
00:44:42,023 --> 00:44:46,923
"Provocations" - is there any
way that I could persuade you to...

613
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:51,166
I hired Gina Ferrara to do that job.

614
00:44:52,113 --> 00:44:56,013
I know you would hate it if your
employers interfered with your autonomy,

615
00:44:56,014 --> 00:44:58,068
running your little museum.

616
00:45:36,398 --> 00:45:37,398
Why would...

617
00:45:39,886 --> 00:45:42,086
Why would you do that?

618
00:45:44,414 --> 00:45:46,414
Are you trying to hurt me?

619
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:50,739
How did I hurt you, Jenny?

620
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:54,295
Because you told someone.

621
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,816
Everybody knows.

622
00:46:00,082 --> 00:46:03,082
Some people guessed from
the way you were behaving.

623
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:10,439
Listen.

624
00:46:10,862 --> 00:46:13,862
I can't hurt Tim. Okay?

625
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:16,407
I understand.

626
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:18,858
I don't know what to do.

627
00:46:27,029 --> 00:46:29,429
Everytime I look at you, I...

628
00:46:30,775 --> 00:46:34,075
I feel so completely dismantled.

629
00:48:04,204 --> 00:48:09,204
