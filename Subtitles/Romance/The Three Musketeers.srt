00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,167
To my horse.

183
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,172
You've hurt her feelings.

184
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,135
And if I don't?

185
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,346
I shall have to kill you.

(CHUCKLING)

187
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,192
You shot me!

188
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,736
Most observant of you, young man.

189
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,739
But the real question is,
why are you not dead?

190
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,701
Flesh wound.

191
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,079
Sight must be off.
Who takes care of my pistols?

192
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,872

00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,919
Whoa, whoa, steady.

195
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,046
Wouldn't want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood.

197
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,757
So, boy,

198
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,718
consider this a lesson.

199
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,885
Your last.

MILADY: No.

201
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,561
He's too pretty for that.

202
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,064
As you wish, Milady.

203
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,943

204
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,070
We're expected in Paris.

208
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,869
I think you've had enough.

209

Where's my tankard?

210

211
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,879
You think you're better than me?

- Sorry! I'm sorry!
- Are you blind?

217
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,225
Look, I'm chasing after a man
who insulted my horse

218
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,518
and tried to kill me, so let me go!

219
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,229
That's not good enough.
You spilled my drink and ruined my shirt.

220
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,814
I'm in a hurry.

- Here.
- 1 0 sous?

223

- Who do you think you're talking to?
- The town drunk, from the smell of you.

Now that, my boy, is fighting talk.

225

- Blind and deaf.

I'm somewhat of a doctor.

I just can't decide.

232
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,723
Well, if I might point out,
this does make you look very dignified,

233
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,101
whereas the blue one
brings out your dashing side.

234
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,811
Equally important.

235
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,315
Dignified. Dashing.

236
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,110
In the words of King
Solomon, I'll take both!

237

I don't know how I shall ever repay you.

- Watch yourself!
- My apologies.

Matter of life and death. Won't happen
again. Believe you dropped this.

243

This isn't mine.

244
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,712
I saw the lady hand this to you,
I'm not blind.

245
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,673
Are you implying that
I take money from this woman?

246
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,301
Are you saying that I cannot afford to pay
for my own wardrobe?

247
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,845
Do you know who I am?

248
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,055
No!

249

Then we're even.

You're in luck, boy.

spot, but this is a brand-new jacket.

- Lottery!
- There you go.

- Who's the opponent?

a sufficient challenge.

286

So evil.

287
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,460

Of course it should be green.

- Arrived this morning.
- You have been busy.

00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,631
Lt was an off day.

535
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,758
(CHUCKLING)

536
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,343
That's my Musketeers for you.

537
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,179
By the time they write songs about them,
it'll be 4,000.

538
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,764
I hope you won't be too harsh with them.

539
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,059
After all, boys will be boys.

540
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,107
You must be D'Artagnan.

541
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:26,446
My lady in waiting has told me about
how brave and dashing you were yesterday.

542
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,324
But you must try not to be so reckless.

543
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,784
Can't help myself, Your Majesty.

544
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,286
- Your Majesty, the culprits.
- Ah! Yes, yes.

545
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,915
Well, stand up, then.

546
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,215
Athos.

547
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,300
Porthos.

548
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,302
Aramis.

549
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:56,810
Forgive me for saying this, D'Artagnan,
but you do look a little underdressed.

550
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,397
My father is a poor man, Your Majesty.

551
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,191
A former Musketeer as well.

552
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,027
These are the only clothes I have.

553
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,155
LOUIS XIII: Oh, Lord.
We shall have to rectify that.

554
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,660
Can't have my Musketeers,
or the son of one, looking like tramps.

555
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,455
New suits all around, I think.

556
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,917
Yes. You'll see to that, Cardinal?

557
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:25,630
And, yes, I think a purse of gold for each
as a reward for your courage.

558
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,257
You'll see to that as well, Cardinal.

559
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,259
And, yes, before I forget,

560
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,137
no more fighting
with His Eminence's guards.

561
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,596
Hmm?

562
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,351
Or there'll be none of them left.

563
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,853
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)

564
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,856
Your Majesty, might I suggest a more...

565
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,858
Forgive my impudence, Cardinal,

566
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,402
but I doubt the King
requires your advice in this matter.

567
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,654
After all, they are his Musketeers.

568
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,197
Good day, gentlemen.

569
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,581
LOUIS XIII: Well, now,
off with you rascals.

570
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:05,003
But be there for the parade tomorrow.
New suits and all.

571
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,923
RICHELIEU: I tire of these royal children.

572
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,218
Lt's time to make our move.

573
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,181
We shall use Buckingham's arrival
to our advantage.

574
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,266
During his visit, we will reveal

575
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,811
that he arranged a secret rendezvous
with the Queen.

576
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,398
May I inquire how Your Eminence
has uncovered this scandalous affair?

577
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:30,111
By reading Buckingham's letters
to the Queen, found in her possession.

578
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,198
Written in Buckingham's hand,
then authenticated by his seal?

579
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,076
A woman of your talents
should have no trouble procuring either.

580
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,746
Hmm. Your Eminence is too kind.

581
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,081
However, I doubt that the King
will accept such letters

582
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,627
as definitive proof of
his wife's indiscretion.

583
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,048
Then we shall provide him
with something a bit more substantial.

584
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:54,886
A piece of the Queen's jewelry given
to Buckingham as a token of affection.

585
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,096
Buckingham will be humiliated.

586
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,640
The King will be outraged.

587
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,267
The Queen will be executed.

588
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,687
France will have no
choice but to go to war.

589
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:10,068
And in times like these, France will
naturally turn to a stronger leader.

590
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:16,324
Someone better equipped to rule a nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge.

591
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,159
Hmm.

592
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,914
Someone like Your Eminence.

593
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,136
CAPTAIN: About face!

594
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,657
Well, where is he, then?
Lt's just appalling manners.

595
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,094
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

596
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,640
MAN: Drop anchor!

597
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,100
Anchor aweigh!

598
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,366
Damn his impudence!

599
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,203
What is that thing called
anyway, Richelieu?

600
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,873
An airship, Your Majesty.

601
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,799
- Why don't I have one of those?
- An oversight on our part.

602
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,136
Right, right. Well, build me one.

603
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,069
MAN: Secure the lines!

604
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,987
All lines secured!

605
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,964
Buckingham.

606
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,510
Blue.

607
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,012
Oh.

608
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,644
Your Majesty.

609
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,271
Love the outfit.

610
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,023
Very retro.

611
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,525
We were all wearing those in London,

612
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,862
when was it, last year or the year before?

613
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:05,034
Lord Buckingham, I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

614
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,953
Not at all. No.

615
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,287
On the contrary.

616
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:12,333
Handles like a dream and keeps me
one step closer to heaven.

617
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,627
Cardinal.

618
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:23,970
Of course, being a servant of God,
you have no need for such crude devices.

619
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,263
(CHUCKLES)

620
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,307
King James is most eager
to hear your peace proposal.

621
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,143
- Lord Buckingham.
- Anne.

622
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,728
Your Majesty.

623
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,315
I must say your beauty is far more radiant
than I remember.

624
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,942
You've met before?

625
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,527
A long time ago.

626
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,572
An evening I shall cherish forever.

627
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,159
Right. Well, shall we?

628
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,915
Now this is a pleasant surprise.

629
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,793
Another acquaintance of yours, I see.

630
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,670
We've met, yes.

631
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,758
As I recall, last I saw you,
you were on your knees as well.

632
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,552
Most unfortunate habit.

633
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,346
Lt's a habit I shall have to break
during our next encounter.

634
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,850
I look forward to it.

635
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,020
In the meantime, shall we talk peace?

636
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,190
(SIGHING)

637
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,904
You must pass me the name
of your interior decorator.

638
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,572
Wine?

639
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,199
I don't drink.

640
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,994
What about that rather nice bottle of
Bordeaux in your middle left-hand drawer?

641
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,831
You must pass me the name
of your spy in the palace.

642
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,334
And yours in mine.

643
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,672
England cannot afford a war on two fronts.

644
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,383
Both our nations
are stretched to breaking point.

645
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,554
A peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage.

646
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,015
Whose advantage? Yours?

647
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,099
Ours.

648
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:58,231
I have a feeling my new war machines
will readdress the balance.

649
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,401
Very impressive.

650
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:08,491

This is the Queen's wing.
You can't be up here.

656
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,673
Oh, thank goodness.

657
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:28,135
I got so lost. I took a wrong turn
and then a door slammed behind me.

658
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,682
I've been trapped up here, in the sun,
in this heat.

659

- It's going to be all right.
- Oh, I'm gonna faint.

What are you doing here?

672
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,704
His Majesty wants a word with me.
Imagine that.

673
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,206
Yes, lovely. Now, excuse me.

I was thinking, after I'm finished
with His Majesty, maybe we could talk?

00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,881
I can't. I have plans.

00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,091
I have a lot of plans.

- Well, I...
- Look, D'Artagnan.

You may have a new set of clothes
and the King's favor,

681
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,223
but you still act like
a clumsy country boy.

Please, think nothing of it.

You're a good fellow, D'Artagnan.

So, how are the ladies
treating you these days?

- Can't complain.
- Yes, indeed.

Well, same here, of course. Thing is...

694

I've got this friend.

Just a regular chap, like you and me.

696
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,536
He got married very young.

697

Political alliance, arranged marriage,
you know the sort of thing.

698
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,374
Hardly knew the girl.

00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,460
- But he likes her?
- Oh, yes.

00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,670
Mmm-hmm.

00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:08,754
Very much.

00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,881
Well, does she like him?

703
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,719
Well, funny you should say that.
That's the problem.

(SIGHING)

706
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,308
Well, he just feels like a fool
when he's around her.

707
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,937
He's always saying the wrong thing.
His palms are sweating.

708
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,899
His heart's pumping so loud
he's afraid she might hear it.

709
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,693
Lt's torture just to look at her.

710
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,530
- Have you ever felt this way?
- Not until recently.

711
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,494
So, what do we do?
I mean, my friend. What does he do?

712
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,832
He should speak his heart.

713
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,878
Be someone who cares for her
and isn't afraid to show it.

714
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,007
Be himself.

715
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,176
Well, that's what I told him.

716
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,094
Well, then he's doubly lucky.

717
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,972
After all, he does have
Your Majesty as a friend.

718
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,893
Yes. Yes. lt's good to have friends.

719
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,315
Will you excuse me just for one moment?

720
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,650
I don't believe it.

721
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,360
(CLEARING THROAT)

722
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,867
How are you?

723
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,786
Very well.

724
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,831
I'm wearing blue.

725
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,000
And you look very handsome in it.

726
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,460
(CHUCKLES SELF-CONSCIOUSLY)

727
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:34,090
Thank you. Yes, I...
You're looking just very lovely.

728
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:38,094
In fact, I was only just remarking
to D'Artagnan how...

729
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,555
How beautiful you are.

730
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,558
Thank you, My Lord.

731
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,323
(SPRAYING)

732
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,738
RICHELIEU: How did it go?
MILADY: Clockwork.

733
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,281
RICHELIEU: Good.

734
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,535
You'll go back to London
with Buckingham and the diamonds.

735
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,329
MILADY: And what should I do with them?

736
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:32,249
Put them in his personal vault,
the most secure location in all of England.

737
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,293
- The Tower of London.
- Yup.

738
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,464
When the scandal breaks,
he'll deny everything.

739
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,133
But once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession...

740
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,011
He would have led England to war
through his indiscretion.

741
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,891
And what of the future of France?

742
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,645
I am France.

743
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,989
One last thing.

744
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:10,162
I suppose it's quite easy,
perhaps even tempting,

745
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,332
for a double agent to play both sides.

746
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,795
Have I given Your Eminence
any reason to doubt my loyalty?

747
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,463
Spare me the rhetoric.

748
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,550
I know who you are. I know what you are.

749
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:28,597
You have a gift for corruption
and a penchant for betrayal.

750
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,516
I admire such skills.

751
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,936
But I'll destroy you the moment I suspect

752
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,438
you might be using them against me.

753
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,317
Do we understand one another?

754
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,696
There

755
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,074
is another side to that coin.

756
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:51,912
Lt's quite easy for an employer
to sever all ties with his operative,

757
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,874
in the event that they are compromised,
leaving them to

758
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,961
rot in jail or on the gallows.

759
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,965
Your point being?

760
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:08,178
I require a guarantee
that I shall not suffer a similar fate.

761
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,558
An insurance policy, if you will.

762
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,644
- My word should suffice.
- (SCOFFS)

763
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,690
I'm afraid I'll need something a bit more

764
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,568
substantial.

765
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,991
(RICHELIEU'S VOICE) "It is by my order
and for the good of the State

766
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:33,162
"that the bearer of this
has done what has been done."

767
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,122
Satisfied?

768
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,623
Immensely.

769
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,381
Your Majesty.

770
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,841
Purple?

771
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,304
Fashion favors the bold.

772
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,681
Here.

773
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,600
Try this for size.

774
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,144
Oh, well.

775
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,937
Do give my regards to the Queen.

776
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:03,317
I will convey your diplomatic proposal
to King James immediately.

777
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,320
Cardinal Richelieu, a pleasure.

778
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,280
All mine.

779
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,829
Your Eminence.

780
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
LOUIS XIII: Richelieu!

781
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,768
Richelieu!

782
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,687
There has been
the most distressing development.

783
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,147
Certain letters,

784
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,234
love letters, were discovered
in the Queen's possession.

785
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,568
Letters from him.

786
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,238
Buckingham, of course! Who else?

787
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,407
Have you spoken to the Queen
about these letters?

788
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,827
No. Of course I haven't.
She'll just deny the whole thing!

789
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,203
Hmm.

790
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,997
I can see Your Majesty's dilemma.

791
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,252
Is there any mention
of a specific encounter? A detail?

792
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,755
- A token of affection, perhaps?
- Yes.

793
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,298
Yes, there is.

794
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,553
A necklace. The one I gave her
for our anniversary. Here.

795
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,432
"I shall always cherish
the 1 2 studded diamonds you gave me,

796
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,268
"the proof of our consummated love."

797
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,355
Does "consummated" mean
what I think it means?

798
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,274
Yes, I'm afraid it does.

799
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,569
Oh, my God!

800
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:32,239
All Your Majesty has to do is throw a ball.

801
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,867
What? How would that help?

802
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,454
Lt would give Your Majesty the pretext
to suggest to the Queen

803
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,746
that she wear your gift.

804
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,877
Oh, Richelieu, that's very clever.
That's very clever.

805
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,504
So, if she has the diamonds...

806
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,381
Your Majesty can rest easy.

807
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,634
And if she doesn't?

808
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,055
He wants to have a celebration ball,
five days from now.

809
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,892
Send my diamonds to the jeweler's
to be polished.

810
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,936
I want the King's undivided attention
that evening.

811
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,416
I hope I am not interrupting.

812
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,336
Hardly, Your Majesty. To what do I owe...

813
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,420
I know.

814
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:32,299
Perhaps Your Majesty
would care to be a bit more specific?

815
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,134
I know.

816
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:35,844
Yeah.

817
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,805
I assume this is the part
where I'm supposed to laugh maniacally

818
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,893
and regale Your Majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot.

819
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,104
However, I regret to inform Your Majesty

820
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,815
that I have no idea of
what you're talking about.

821
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,526
I thought you'd say that.

822
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:54,154
Then why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit?

823
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,281
To look into your eyes when you said it.

824
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,251
- Your Majesty.
- (SOBBING)

825
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,631
All may not be lost yet.

826
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,011
(BANGING ON DOOR)

827
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,013
PLANCHET: Coming, coming!
Hold your horses!

828
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,558
Lt's not a matter of
life or death, you know?

829
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,476
Actually, it is.

830
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,478
You want me to go to England,

831
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,313
retrieve the diamonds,
which the Queen suspects

832
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,315
might be in Buckingham's possession,

833
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,734
which will naturally involve breaking into
some heavily fortified,

834
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,070
highly impregnable facility?

835
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,280
The Tower of London.

836
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,241
Since the Cardinal's spies
are trying to implicate the Duke,

837
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,617
it is the most logical choice.

838
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:45,163
Then return to Paris
with every soldier, assassin,

839
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,208
mercenary, bounty hunter,

840
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,045
on both sides of the Channel
out to stop me from doing so.

841
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,839
Did I miss anything?

842
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,507
All in five days.

843
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,801
A minor detail. Anything else?

844
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,011
No.

845
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,097
Well, I really only have
one question for you.

846
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,142
Why in the world would I do that?

847
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,943
England it is.

848
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,198
D'ARTAGNAN: Diamonds, Buckingham,
Tower of London, five days,

849
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,659
Queen's reputation
and the fate of France as we know it.

850
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:24,745
Who's with me?

851
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,628
Well, I should imagine
the Queen would be quite generous.

852
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:37,716
Count Porthos. Hmm? What do you think?
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

853
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,346
Besides, I hear the English women are a
lot like a frosted bottle of champagne.

854
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,182
Ice on the outside,
but once you warm them up...

855
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:49,978
This isn't a great cause,
but it'll have to do.

856
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,444
Buckingham's there, so is she.

857
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,904
Who?

858
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,906
Countess de Winter.

859
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,532
Charlotte Backson.

860
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,160
Anne de Breuil. Lady Clarick.

861
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,412
Milady.

862
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,081
Milady?

863
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,626
I know her. I saw her with Rochefort.

864
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,544
PORTHOS: She's switched sides again.

865
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,588
She's working for the Cardinal, no doubt.

866
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,131
What are you going to do if you catch her?

867
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:23,428
ROCHEFORT: Musketeers, open up
and surrender by order of the Cardinal!

868
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,597
- You were followed.
- It's Rochefort.

869
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:30,769
Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan,

870
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,147
surrender your weapons
and no harm will come to you.

871
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,901
The moment they step out,

872
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:39,986
kill them.

873
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,615
Light the torches!

874
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,410
I'll count to five, then
we'll burn you out!

875
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,208
One!

876
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:54,751
Two!

877
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,294
Three!

878
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,380
Oh! Sorry! Didn't see you there.

879
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,673
- JUSSAC: Damn you!
- (LAUGHS)

880
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:04,970
JUSSAC: Fire!

881
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,361
RICHELIEU: Let me guess.

882
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,739
You've come to tell me
that the Musketeers are dead,

883
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,575
our plan is proceeding on schedule,

884
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,536
and I have absolutely, positively,
nothing to worry about.

885
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,831
We were taken by surprise, Your Eminence.

886
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,542
Somehow I was laboring
under the assumption

887
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:38,587
that the plan was for you
to take them by surprise.

888
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,257
- Was it not?
- Eminence...

889
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,009
Yes, you are quite fond of that word,
aren't you?

890
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:47,095
Sadly, repeating it
doesn't get you into my good graces.

891
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,723
Alert Milady. Watch the ports.

892
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,601
No one is to leave for England
without my official permission.

893
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,686
Post a bounty on their heads.

894
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,605
The bigger, the better.

895
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,523
Yes, Your Eminence.

896
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,066
Rochefort.

897
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,322
Do not fail me again.

898
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:19,503
ARAMIS: Jussac and a lot of help.
There's no way past.

899
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,546
How the hell did he get here so fast?

900
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,719
D'ARTAGNAN: Now what?
ATHOS: We need a distraction.

901
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,346
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

902
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,680
I could go.

903
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,390
Probably not.

904
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:33,517
Wrong.

905
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,394
Wrong on all counts.
You'll need every sword where you're going.

906
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,105
I can't help you there, but I can help.

907
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,399
Right here, right now.

908
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,734
- If they catch you...
- They won't.

909
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,445
- If they catch you...
- I'm the Queen's lady-in-waiting.

910
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,614
You, on the other hand,
are a wanted fugitive,

911
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,742
and about to steal
from the most powerful man in England.

912
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,411
Which one of us should be worried?

913
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:54,955
Go.

914
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,207
Go so that you can come back.

915
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,428
Now give me that hat.

916
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,104
D'Artagnan!

917
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,313
Get after him!

918
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:37,956
Wait!

919
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,461
ATHOS: The diamonds will be
in Buckingham's personal vault,

920
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:47,132
located in the lowest, most secure level
of the Tower, next to the crown jewels.

921
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,259
The lock is state of the art.

922
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,137
Lt requires a key that Buckingham
carries on his person at all times.

923
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,805
Corridor leading up to it is booby-trapped.

924
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,390
Oh, I'm glad that's straightforward.

925
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:58,727
Tempt anyone
with some bread and cheese, if you...

926
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,229
You hadn't finished the briefing, actually.
I'm so sorry.

927
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,023
Please don't tell me off.

928
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,984
ATHOS: Then it gets worse, a lot worse.

929
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,945
We have to cross three stone walls
and a moat.

930
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,072
And there's just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers

931
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,657
with a predilection for not being robbed.

932
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,494
Although, since Buckingham undoubtedly
knows we're coming, thanks to Milady,

933
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,079
that number is likely to be greater.

934
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,999
D'ARTAGNAN: And why can't we just tell
Buckingham Milady is plotting against him?

935
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:25,170
ATHOS: Because he wouldn't believe us.
Why should he? We're his sworn enemies.

936
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,757
Besides, Milady would have made sure.

937
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,760
Athos is coming.

938
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,429
Tell me.

939
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,016
What do you suppose he's after?

940
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,893
What does it matter?

941
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:45,607
Whatever it is, it's merely an excuse.
He wants revenge for Venice.

942
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,735
He wants me.

943
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,446
And he wants you.

944
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,409
We shall have to be ready for him.

945
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:58,870
Won't we?

946
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:03,875
We can't outshoot them,
but we can outsmart them.

947
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:06,795
He'll naturally favor
misdirection and deception.

948
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,799
He knows we're expecting him,
but that just ups the ante.

949
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,884
She knows us.

950
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,388
What we look like, how we move,
how we think.

951
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,890
He'll divide his forces, independent teams,

952
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,102
each with their own point of entry
to maximize their chances.

953
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,270
There are four of us. So we use...

954
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,190
Well, there's five of
us, actually, if you...

955
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,196
He's a skilled diver. He'll take the
aquatic route, through the Traitor's Gate.

956
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,412
Aramis will undoubtedly rely
on agility and stealth.

957
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,873
Check every tower, every rooftop.

958
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:50,422
Porthos, on the other hand,
will employ brute strength.

959
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,259
One of his preferred methods
is getting captured by the opposition.

960
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,475
All the more reason
to take none of them alive.

961
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,187
One more thing.

962
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,527
They may try and drive a wedge between us.

963
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,529
Claim to have secret information

964
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:17,240
about some plot to get us
to turn against one another,

965
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:21,661
like, say, I'm a double agent
working for the Cardinal

966
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:25,248
or you're looking to get rid of me.

967
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:32,630
I assure you,
nothing could be further from the truth.

968
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,259
- (GASPS)
- Although,

969
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:42,015
I suppose I should

970
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,603
search you for concealed weapons.

971
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,899
That's how it's done.

972
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,903
And that's exactly what she'll expect.

973
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:58,406
So we do the unexpected.

974
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,952
We go in broad daylight.
One man, hiding in plain sight.

975
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:06,539
With all the extra security, there'll be
a lot of new faces, that's their weakness.

976
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,834
And you, D'Artagnan, you're the wild card.

977
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,463
We are the decoys.

978
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:17,300
Now we'll try and create a distraction,
keep them occupied,

979
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,260
keep them away from you
as much as possible,

980
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,554
but, ultimately, it's down to you.

981
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,808
You wanted to be a Musketeer?

982
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,601
You want to serve France?

983
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,645
This is your chance.

984
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,489
COMMANDER: Left, right, left, right, left!

985
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:40,949
I thought you saw the signal!

986
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:44,119
- I saw you waving like an idiot!
- Well, that was the bloody signal!

987
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,954
I'm trying to see things
from your point of view,

988
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:48,498
but, unfortunately,
I can't get my head that far up my ass!

989
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,041
- Up your ass? I'll tell you what...
- Yes!

990
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,417
SERGEANT: That's enough of that!

991
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,421
PORTHOS: Finally, good,
at last, a peace officer!

992
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,466
Now listen, Sergeant,
I would like you to arrest this man!

993
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,551
Arrest me?

994
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:00,927
You can't arrest me!

995
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:03,388
Don't you tell me that!
I've lost my prized bantam!

996
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,432
- Bantams? They are rotten!
- They are not rotten!

997
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,501
Sir! The first of the Musketeers
has been arrested!

998
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,920
The game is afoot.

999
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:40,091
Bring him to me and double the guards.
Double the troops.

1000
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,011
Double everything.

1001
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,679
Sir!

1002
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,515
They'll come to us.

1003
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,768
Well, then.

1004
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,646
I think Your Lordship
has everything under control.

1005
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:57,108
You won't mind if I don't stay
to see how it all turns out?

1006
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,613
- Do you think I might lose?
- On the contrary.

1007
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:04,449
I have no issues with you killing Athos,

1008
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,951
but, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not watch him die.

1009
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,416
Tell me, what's your favorite color?

1010
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:20,965
Red.

1011
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,051
Why?

1012
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,262
I wanted to see
if you were capable of telling the truth.

1013
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:28,973
Hmm.

1014
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,693
As far from here as possible.

1015
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,334
Well, well, well.

1016
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,798
Look at what the cat dragged in.

1017
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:05,551
So, how's the old Athos, eh?

1018
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:10,515
Still his surly,
insufferable self, I'm sure.

1019
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:14,143
Sending a boy to do a man's job.

1020
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,938
I should feel insulted.

1021
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,110
Well, what were you after anyway, eh?

1022
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:27,573
Secrets, spies, it's all a game, really.

1023
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:31,411
Although the price of loss,
as you'll come to discover,

1024
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,663
is a little bit higher.

1025
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:36,833
What?

1026
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,502
No last words?

1027
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:41,838
No insults?

1028
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,674
- Pleas for mercy or...
- What time is it?

1029
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:51,848
About 2:00, I'd say.
Why? Are you in a hurry?

1030
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,686
Look out of the window.

1031
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:06,863
They weren't the decoys. I was.

1032
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,270
Ahhh!

1033
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,942
(GUNFIRE CONTINUING)

1035
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:13,471
Permission to come aboard?

1036
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:14,639
Granted.

1040
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,158
Athos!

1041
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:56,013
The wonderful thing about fighting
an imaginary opponent, Captain Rochefort,

1042
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,684
is that he's always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated.

1043
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,102
Eminence.

1044
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,481
The pride of victory
without the risk of loss.

1045
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,152
I trust you didn't come here to impress me
with your swordsmanship.

1046
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:12,321
No, Your Eminence. I have some good news.

1047
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:14,449
Such as?

1048
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:33,176
So what about the diamonds?
Doesn't Buckingham still have them?

1049
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:34,302
Nope.

1050
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,679
Milady likes hedging her bets.

1051
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,722
She'd never have taken the chance

1052
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,390
we'd actually succeed
in breaking into the vault.

1053
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,852
D'ARTAGNAN: So where are they now?

1054
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,688
ATHOS: With the only person she trusts.

1055
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,488
Which means we've lost her
and all this has been for nothing.

1056
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,114
I wouldn't say that.

1057
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,789
You were the decoy, we were the extraction,

1058
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,335
but the real linchpin of the plan, well,

1059
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,171
that was someone else entirely.

1060
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,968
Someone even Milady would never suspect.

1061
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,267
Driver! What the hell is going on?

1062
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,479
Just following your instructions, ma'am.
"As far away from here as possible."

1063
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:27,939
(LAUGHING)

1064
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,885
PLANCHET: Whoo-hoo!

1065
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,818
Planchet. Never thought
I'd hear myself say this, but

1066
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:15,528
well done.

1067
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,154
Thank you, sir.

1068
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,824
That means a lot,
especially coming from you.

1069
01:16:19,866 --> 01:16:20,950
Shut up, Planchet.

1070
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:22,159
Yes, sir.

1071
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:30,668
- Don't.
- (CLICKS)

1072
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,299
We took the precaution
of removing the gunpowder.

1073
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:44,515
What now?

1074
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,144
You give me the diamonds
or I take them off your corpse.

1075
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,520
Dealer's choice.

1076
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,443
- Anything else you'd like me to take off?
- Outside.

1077
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,665
Boys.

1078
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,917
Been a while.

1079
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:17,048
This must be the young Gascon.

1080
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:19,550
We've met before.

1081
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,178
Ah, yes.

1082
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:24,805
Small world.

1083
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,851
I didn't let Rochefort kill you.

1084
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,438
You do remember that, don't you?

1085
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:35,733
(GUN COCKING)

1086
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,406
- Did you kill Buckingham?
- No.

1087
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,451
- But you will kill me?
- ATHOS: Yes.

1088
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,247
You would spare him, but kill me?

1089
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:53,167
Yes. I don't hate Buckingham.

1090
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,552
Here.

1091
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:05,971
You may find use for this.

1092
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:10,476
Move.

1093
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:45,469
Athos.

1094
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:08,159
At least she died the way she lived,
on her own terms.

1095
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:13,205
She did it for me.

1096
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:19,462
I wouldn't have been able to live
with myself had I pulled the trigger.

1097
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,674
Come on, let's go home.

1098
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,773
LADY: But I can't get it.

1099
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:40,858
LADY 2: How marvelous!

1100
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,196
Oh! So great!

1101
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:54,705
- (CLEARING THROAT)
- Oh!

1102
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,875
Your Majesty.

1103
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,543
My dear.

1104
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,712
You look troubled.

1105
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,840
Hardly. Your Majesty just startled me.

1106
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,092
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1107
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:10,054
I just wanted to drop by

1108
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,972
and tell you how much
I was looking forward to tonight.

1109
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:17,561
Should be quite spectacular, you know.
Costumes, fireworks and such.

1110
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,772
But you,

1111
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:23,859
you shall be
the most spectacular sight of all.

1112
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:27,446
And especially since
you'll wear the diamonds.

1113
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,949
You will wear them, won't you?

1114
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:33,994
Well, it's very important
to me that you do.

1115
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:38,374
Then I shall wear them, Your Majesty.

1116
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,126
Until tonight, then.

1117
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,763
She promised she'll wear them.

1118
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:56,267
You do think she'll wear them,
don't you, Richelieu?

1119
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,395
I'm sure she will, Your Majesty.

1120
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,105
I'm sure she will.

1121
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:27,423
(RETCHING)

1122
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,135
I hate air travel!

1123

(PLANCHET GROANING)

1124
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:47,443
Damn!

1125
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:19,683
HELMSMAN: Hard to starboard!

1126
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:35,407
Well, now that we have their attention,

1127
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:37,701
let's see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner.

1128
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,745
More or less.

1129
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:43,624
Ah, Gascon!

1130
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,211
So you've traded up
when it comes to transport.

1131
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,171
But, once again, you're outmatched.

1132
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:51,382
You can thank Milady for that.

1133
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:54,343
She passed on Buckingham's plans
a long time ago.

1134
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:57,012
As you can see,
we made some improvements.

1135
01:22:57,889 --> 01:22:58,931
(CHUCKLES)

1136
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:00,224
Isn't she a beauty?

1137
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,684
What do you want?

1138
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,020
The diamonds.

1139
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:07,398
- Come and take them.
- ROCHEFORT: Gladly!

1140
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:11,360
You see, I can blast you out of the sky
with total impunity.

1141
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:12,778
If you fire on me, on the other hand,

1142
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:14,989
you'll be killing
Miss Oh-so-young-and-pretty.

1143
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,411
You have 60 seconds.

1144
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:24,206
He'll shoot us down
the moment he has the diamonds.

1145
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,290
We can't outrun them.

1146
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:26,917
And we can't fight them, damn it! We can't.

1147
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,253
- Oh, D'Artagnan.
- What?

1148
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,381
Do you think
you have the monopoly on loss?

1149
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:33,716
What if she dies?

1150
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,300
The life of one woman
or the future of France,

1151
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,302
what would you do
if you were in my position?

1152
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:42,266
ATHOS: I've made a lot of sacrifices,
a lot of hard choices.

1153
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:45,436
For honor, for King, for country.
You wanna know what I've learned, boy?

1154
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:48,605
Hard choices and sacrifices
do not keep you warm at night.

1155
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:53,068
Life is too damn short and too damn long
to go through without someone at your side.

1156
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,778
Don't end up like me.

1157
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:58,949
Choose the woman.
Fight for love, D'Artagnan.

1158
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:01,785
France will take care of itself.

1159
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:04,955
ROCHEFORT: Time's up!

1160
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:09,626
An exchange.

1161
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:14,048
I go aboard your ship with the diamonds,
the girl comes aboard ours.

1162
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,258
Once I know she's safe,

1163
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:18,802
I give them to you.

1164
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:22,806
Fine. But I want to see the diamonds first.

1165
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:24,725

1166
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:28,812

HELMSMAN: Deploy the gangway!

Finish them off!

1176
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,265
We can't outrun them
and we can't outgun them.

1177
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:31,226
We could try asking them to surrender,
but somehow I don't think it would work.

1178
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,103
We hide. In there.
