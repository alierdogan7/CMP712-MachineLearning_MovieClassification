to pay for something like that?

1221
01:27:29,114 --> 01:27:33,312
I'm sorry,
I am very disappointed in you.

1222
01:27:39,314 --> 01:27:43,307
She'll be all right.
Why don't you put in a little yard work?

Joel...

1225
01:28:40,634 --> 01:28:42,704
...do you have something to tell me?

1226
01:28:46,234 --> 01:28:47,906
No...

1227
01:28:48,154 --> 01:28:49,906
...I don't think so.

1228
01:28:50,274 --> 01:28:53,505
I just got off the telephone
with Bill Rutherford.

1229
01:28:56,074 --> 01:29:00,545
Apparently, uh,
you two had quite a meeting.

1230
01:29:03,514 --> 01:29:06,711
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel"?

1231
01:29:07,794 --> 01:29:08,783
What?

1232
01:29:08,954 --> 01:29:12,663
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

1233
01:29:12,834 --> 01:29:14,984
His exact words.

1234
01:29:16,274 --> 01:29:17,673
That's unbelievable.

1235
01:29:17,834 --> 01:29:19,950
You're as good as in.

1236
01:29:20,114 --> 01:29:21,672
I knew you could do it.

1237
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:25,144
Haven't I been telling you,
once in a while, say, "What the heck"...

1238
01:29:25,354 --> 01:29:26,753
...and take some chances?

1239
01:29:26,914 --> 01:29:28,427
You were so right.

1240
01:29:28,594 --> 01:29:30,824
You've made me very proud.

I was just thinking...

1242
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:41,434
...where we might be
1 0 years from now, you know?

1244

You know what I think?

1245
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:48,069
I think we're both gonna make it big.

1246
01:29:48,234 --> 01:29:50,748
I am very optimistic.

1247
01:29:50,914 --> 01:29:52,506
I mean it.

1248
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:56,505
Can I ask you something?

1249
01:30:01,114 --> 01:30:03,787
Was our night together...

1250
01:30:05,514 --> 01:30:06,503
...just a setup...

1251
01:30:08,114 --> 01:30:10,708
...for Vicki and Guido?

1252
01:30:18,714 --> 01:30:19,988
No.

Guess we won't see each other
for a while.

1263
01:31:00,314 --> 01:31:01,906
I know.

1264
01:31:03,114 --> 01:31:05,070
So you going straight home now?

1265
01:31:05,234 --> 01:31:06,747
I don't know. Why?

1266
01:31:06,914 --> 01:31:11,146
I just thought it might be nice if,
uh, we spent the evening together.

1267

I'd really like that.

Because I don't have that much here.

How about I write you a check?

I'd accept a check from you?
