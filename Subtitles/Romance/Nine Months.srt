00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,319
Right.

187
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,823
And there's no way
you could have had it

188
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,283
and just not noticed?

189
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,161
Sorry. Ridiculous.
That was stupid. Stupid.

190
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,664
Could you be a little
more positive about this,

191
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,666
more supportive?

192
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,418
I'm trying to
be positive.

193
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,338
Killing us in a head-on
collision is not positive.

194
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,174
It must have been shock.

195
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,759
Out of the blue,
you sayyou're pregnant.

196
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,304
It was just
a little bit unexpected

197
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,806
was probably the reason
for the crash.

198
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,309
I thought you were
using birth control.

199
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,310
I was.

200
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,520
Your car's ready now,
sir.

201
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:09,813
Great.

202
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,819
Oh...

203
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,821
you don't believe me!

204
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,156
No?

205
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,201
You think I got pregnant
behind your back.

206
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,620
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

207
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,163
Do you think
I planned this?

208
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,166
I'm as flipped out
as you are.

209
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,667
I suppose
I just thought

210
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,169
that birth control

211
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:35,506
had a little teeny element
of control about it.

212
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,509
Thought it was supposed
to be foolproof .

213
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,677
Nothing is foolproof .
It's only 97% effective.

214
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,221
It says so on the box.

215
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,181
Yeah. Right.
97% effective.

216
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,683
So 3% completely
bloody ineffective.

217
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,895
They should put that
on the box.

218
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,396
Here you are.

219
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,481
[Man]
Thanks.

220
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,607
We're off.

221
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,785
Hey. Hey.

222
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,370
Sean.

223
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,122
Who's the blonde?

224
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,666
No idea.

225
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,627
Oh, my God.
Jesus.

226
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,629
Hey,
how are you?

227
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,630
Hi.

228
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,632
Hey,
this is Bobbie.

229
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,633
Hi.

230
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,635
This is Rebecca
and Sam.

231
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,636
Hi.

232
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,639
I was getting worried
about you guys.

233
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,641
What happened
to this car?

234
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,142
Oh, long story.

235
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,144
[Quietly]
What happened to Christine?

236
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,980
A long story.

237
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:40,153
So this is where
you two are going to stay.

238
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,154
Yeah, lovely.

239
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,157
So, what do you
think of  her?

240
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,159
What,
you mean the blonde?

241
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,661
She's attractive.
Very attractive.

242
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,663
She's 25 years old.

243
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,167
Her skin
is like ribbon candy.

244
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,128
Breasts
like sponge cake.

245
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,130
Her calves
are like calzone.

246
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,090
I mean,
highly edible.

247
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,592
Highly edible.

248
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,635
She's crazy
about sex.

249
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,137
This is somebody

250
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,639
to get me over
the rough spots.

251
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,101
Mmm. What do you mean?
What rough spots?

252
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,145
Oh, Christine
left me.

253
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,149
Oh, shit.

254
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,609
When?

255
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,611
Oh, uh...
a week ago.

256
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,112
What happened?

257
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,780
Well...

258
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,658
she wanted
a child.

259
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,160
[Glass Hits Floor]

260
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,620
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,121
Are you O.K.?

262
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,290
Yep. Yep.
What an idiot.

263
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,791
Leave that.

264
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,293
Got it.

265
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,003
She said she wanted--

266
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,797
She, uh...
Christine wanted a baby.

267
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,799
She was hungry
for seed,

268
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,302
so I closed
the iron door,

269
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:47,179
denied her
my essence.

270
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,349
You know,
I'm not ready

271
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,142
to be biologically
extraneous.

272
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,186
She would have
devoured me

273
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,021
from the head down,

274
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,481
chewed up
my manhood,

275
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,484
swallowed myyouth,
and gobbled me up

276
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,194
like some
praying mantis.

277
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,695
Not for me.

278
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,156
What do you mean,
praying mantis?

279
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,658
The female mantis,

280
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,118
after she has sex
with her mate,

281
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,620
she eats him.

282
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,121
Oh, yeah.

283
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,624
But Christine
wasn't pregnant

284
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,960
or anything
like that?

285
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,506
No. What do you mean?
Like on the sly?

286
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,007
On the sly,

287
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:27,010
or, you know,
in the run of things.

288
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,263
On the s-- No.

289
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,641
I mean, Christine
has her faults,

290
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:36,186
but I don't know
who would do that.

291
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,689
That's a knife
in the back.

292
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,690
Yeah.

293
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,900
You know, that's--
No, of course not.

294
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,402
That's
some voodoo woman

295
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,404
who puts pins
in her diaphragm.

296
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,405
Ha ha.

297
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,406
Spooky, Sam.

298
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,199
That's a she-snake.

299
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,784
That's like
the most hateful,

300
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,494
cruel, sneaky,

301
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,496
horrible thing
you can do.

302
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,998
Who would do that?

303
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,384
No! No!

304
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,094
Aah!

305
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,554
Aah!

306

They eat the father!
They eat the father!

307

They eat him!

Honey. Honey, what?
Honey, what?

309
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,605
Who eats fathers?

310
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,608
No one.
Sorry. Sorry.

311
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,610
Just a bad,
bad dream.

312
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,111
Silly, silly dream.

313
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,113
O.K.
You worry too much.

314
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,615
Just relax.

315
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,575
Lie down, O.K.
Lie down.

316
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,619
It's O.K., baby.

Whatever happens,
we can work it out.

318
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,626
I know.

319

I love you.

00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,629
I've loved you

321
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,632
since the first moment
I saw you.

322
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,133
You're the only one

323
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:51,637
I want to be the father
of  my children,

it's now or later.

325

00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,281
I love it
when you do that.

329
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,783
Do what?

330
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,284
Ha ha ha!

331
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,287
That thing you're doing
with my knee.

332
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,789
That is so good.

333
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:20,290
Oh, Samuel.

334
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,292
Stop it.
I love it.

335
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,127
Go on.

336
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,629
But, Samuel?

337
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,130
What? Yeah?

338
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,133
I'm not doing anything
with your knee.

339
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:33,971
Huh?

340
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,307
Aah! What is it?

341

Aah!

Come here, kiddo.

I'm sorry, folks.

a hiding phase.

It's for attention.

Hey, honey,
you'll get it dirty,

351
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,083
and God knows
what's on there.

it's the beach people.

This is great. Don't worry.
We didn't bring a kite.

How about another one
of them kisses?

What's going on?

for her for an hour.

to call of fthe search.

Sounds great.
Good to see you.

tell me either.

They always
show up uninvited.

370

I hope they don't
spoil your weekend.

Oh, no.

We'll be fine.
The kids seem adorable.

Oh,
they're monsters.

374
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,060
They're monsters.

375
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,938
See, this is why
I don't want kids.

376
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,400
[Sean]
It's nonsense.

377
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,791
No, what I'm saying is

378
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,294
I think it's such baloney
and such a cliche

379
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:32,297
that the artist
has to be messed up

380
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,883
and have a life
of deprivation,

381
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,928

or deprived in some way.

I think
you're great.

Oh, God.
I am so sorry about that.

She's been reading
Harlequin Romance novels,

obsessed with it.

[Marty]
It's kind of cute.

406

Isn't it cute?
Lovely.

00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,501
All right, everybody.
I've got an announcement.

412
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:54,630
Gail and I
are going to have a new baby.

413
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,927
[Under His Breath]
Oh, shit. Not another one.

414
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,474
So I'd like to
make a toast.

415
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:12,523
To my wife, the most beautiful
pregnant woman in the world.

416

Hear, hear!

418
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,236
You could be
the toughest guy,

419

but when your child
looks into your eyes

420
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,782
and that child knows
you're their dad...

421
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,283
suddenly
it smiles.

422
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,786
It's like...
I cannot explain it.

00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,287
It's like magic.

Is it magic when they do
that little dribble of vomit

00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,466
I'm sorry
if we're boring you, pal.

Let's just deal
with this accusation.

about my wife and I
having another baby.

440
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,785
Is being excited a reason

441
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,787
to exclude eight people
from conversation?

00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,289
I didn't realize

exciting moment.

doesn't mean

00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:39,079
Hey, guys,
what the hell?

727
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,790
Good to see you!
How you doing?

728
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:42,791
Hi.

729
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,293
When
are you due?

730
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:45,794
Oh, I'm not
pregnant.

731
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:47,796
You're not pregnant?
Yeah, right.

732
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,797
Huh?

733
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:50,549
What are you
doing

734
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,467
on the maternity
floor?

735
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,970
Are we on
the maternity floor?

736
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,805
Good grief.
We're completely lost.

737
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,182
Poor old Beck.

738
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,641
She had
some bad Chinese.

739
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:02,394
We're here to see
the gastrointestinal specialist.

740
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,645
What's his name?

741
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,189
His name?

742
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:06,523
Yeah.

743
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,525
I can probably
tell you

744
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,027
what floor he's on.

745
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,362
She volunteers here. I've sold
cars to almost every doctor.

746
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,864
Beck, what's his name?

747
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,866
It's Dr. something,
isn't it?

748
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,326
It's Doctor...

749
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:18,827
Ridiculous.

750
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,329
Excuse me.

751
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:21,830
Oh, gosh.
Thanks.

752
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:24,333
I didn't realize
I'd left it.

753
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,834
thank you
very much.

754
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:27,920
You have
a small pussy.

755
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,004
What?

756
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:32,090
I found the little hairs
on the bag.

757
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,091
What?

758
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,635
You know, the...meow...

759
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,470
Oh, cat!

760
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:38,931
Yes, we have a cat.

761
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:41,975
Well, you must
get rid of  it.

762
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:42,976
What?

763
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,436
Cats spread the disease.

764
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,939
Oh, yeah. Where
the small worms...

765
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,440
Yes.
Small worms.

766
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,025
In the poop.

767
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,193
Toxoplasmosis.

768
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:52,694
Toxoplasmosis.
thank you.

769
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:54,696
thank you both
very much,

770
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,157
but Skippy
is old and clean

771
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,159
and won't cause
any problem.

772
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,620
O.K. Well,
it is your choice--

773
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:04,665
the cat or the baby.

774
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:07,167
Sorry to bring you
that news.

775
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,004
Baby.

776
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,506
Oh, congratulations,
guys.

777
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,049
I'm so excited!

778
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,551
Congratulations,
you guys.

779
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:16,552
Congratulations.

780
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:19,054
Wow. That's great.
Oh, your first.

781
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,055
Thanks.

782
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,014
Sorry about--

783
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,516
That's all right.

784
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,518
I've been
lied to before.

785
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,019
You're good at it.

786
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:28,897
We could use you
at the car lot.

787
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,440
[Gail]
It's so exciting!

788
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,568
[Marty]
We're happy for you.

789
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,069
How are you feeling?

790
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:36,071
I'm O.K.
A little tired.

791
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:37,573
Everybody
gets tired,

792
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:40,075
but the whole
thing is just

793
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,577
a life-changing
event.

794
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,579
I'll give
you my number.

795
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:45,581
We can go
baby shopping.

796
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,083
You've got to
get that book,

797
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,586
What To Expect
When You're Expecting.

798
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:54,047
And we've got videos of
all her births.

799
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:56,508
You've got to
film your first.

800
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,011
That's the best.
It's the bloodiest--

801
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,013
blood everywhere,
things shooting out,

802
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:04,016
people screaming, stuff getting
torn and sewed together.

803
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:07,269
It's like a good
World War I I movie.

804
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,021
Will you keep
the car?

805
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:10,522
Yeah. It's fine now.

806
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,774
Cost a bit of  money.

807
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:15,360
But it only seats
two people.

808
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:16,904
It always did.

809
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,364
But you're going to
have a baby.

810
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:22,868
You could never fit
a car seat in there.

811
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,370
Listen, stop down
by the lot.

812
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,915
I'll make you
a good deal.

813
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:29,500
All right?

814
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,210
Great.

815
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,587
Honey, we got to go.
Bad Chinese...

816
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,047
Buddy!

817
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,049
Come on, baby.
Let's roll.

818
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,550
See you guys.

819
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:39,927
O.K.

820
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,429
I hate him.
I loathe him.

821
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:44,723
He tried to
sell me a new car.

822
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:47,726
Can you believe that?
Tacky or what?

823
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,228
Yeah,
but he's right.

824
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,730
We're going to need
something bigger.

825
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:54,566
But you know how much
I love my car.

826
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,443
I've worked
hard for it.

827
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:57,945
What do you
suggest?

828
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:01,448
Tie the baby
to the hood like a deer?

829
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:04,743
Well, no, but maybe
you could get a car.

830
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:06,745
On my salary?
Come on.

831
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,747
Well, put it this way.

832
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,667
I'm not getting rid
of the car.

833
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,418
What about the cat?

834
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:15,003
Huh?

835
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:18,006
What, you believe
Dr. Zhivago in there?

836
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,800
The monkey doctor?

837
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:22,261
He's right.
I've read about it.

838
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:25,138
Cats can be dangerous
for a baby.

839
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:28,141
They can suffocate
the baby, claw the baby.

840
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,144
Skippy is 16.
He can barely move.

841
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,646
He's half-blind.

842
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,898
He's too weak
to suffocate anyone.

843
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,401
What about hygiene
in the kitchen?

844
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:40,737
You get cat hair
and cat saliva.

845
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,532
You said that this baby
wouldn't change our lives.

846
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:47,703
Now I have to sell my car
and get rid of  my cat.

847
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,705
This is the second month,

848
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:52,207
and our lives
are practically unrecognizable!

849
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,436
I really appreciate
your asking us along.

850
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,439
I'm hoping this
will get Samuel excited

851
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:16,940
about having a baby.

852
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,442
Oh, yeah. Sure.

853
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:19,943
Yeah, 'cause, um,

854
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,445
ifthings
don't change,

855
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,947
I'm thinking
about leaving him.

856
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,949
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Sure you are.

857
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,952
I thought about leaving
Marty all the time,

858
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,455
but this
is his first time.

859
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:34,458
You've got to
give him a chance.

860
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,959
He's completely
uninvolved.

861
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,962
This whole baby thing
really scares him.

862
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,465
He's probably having
trouble facing it.

863
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,467
if you have a baby,

864
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,470
that means
he's got to grow up.

865
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:49,473
The baby's the fun part.
That's fun.

866
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:52,684
You know.
Look at all this stuff.

867
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,186
Ah, yeah! Whoo!

868
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,188
He's going to
love this.

869
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:59,483
You know you're
having a boy, right?

870
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,151
Yeah.

871
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:06,156
Gail took one of those
amnio tests, I suppose.

872
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,157
No.

873
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,659
How do you know?

874
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:11,161
I can tell
it's a boy

875
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:14,665
by the way she's
carrying it all in front.

876
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:17,668
They don't of ten
carry them at the back.

877
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,169
If it's a boy,

878
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,672
they carry them low
like this.

879
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,675
If it's a girl,
it's up like this.

880
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,677
Plus, there are
special ways

881
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,680
to ensure that it
will be a boy.

882
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,182
What do you mean,
special ways?

883
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,184
Well,
when we made love...

884
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:35,686
Yeah?

885
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,521
we used
special positions.

886
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,022
Oh, please.

887
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:42,025
That's an old wives' tale,
that stuff.

888
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,360
You'll see.

889
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:47,614
Sometimes I'm not sure
I want this baby.

890
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,117
Oh, Missy,
of course you do.

891
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,119
It's just
such a privilege.

892
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:53,620
There's hundreds
of women

893
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:56,540
who spend thousands
of dollars every day

894
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:58,959
trying to
get pregnant.

895
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:01,336
It's like our prof ound
biological right.

896
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:03,589
It's something men
can never experience.

897
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:06,508
It has to be
at the right time for you,

898
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,843
but really,
it's a miracle.

899
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:10,345
And then
when the baby comes,

900
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:14,516
there's moments
of sheer happiness.

901
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,644
Even if you're alone?

902
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:22,983
I know it's fashionable,
PC, all that,

903
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,986
to be a strong,

British etiquette?

1107

The latest nightmare
is that the baby is deformed--

1108
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:24,441
It's missing an arm,

1109
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:26,443
or it's got
cauliflower ears

1110
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:28,403
with an eye
on its forehead.

1111
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:30,906

the baby?

[Rings Doorbell]

1266
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:13,554
Marty, hi.

1267
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,013
Is she here?

1268
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,765
She never wants
to see you again.

1269
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:19,434
Let me talk to her
for two seconds.

1270
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:22,604
If I let you,
I'll be in the doghouse.

1271
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:24,273
I'll have to
live with you.

1272
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:26,066
You're a great
kisser, but--

1273
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,401
[Gail]
Who is it?

1274
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:29,194
It's my mom, honey.

1275
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:31,196
But your mother's dead!

1276
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:32,739
Yeah,
it's really weird!

1277
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:35,075
Marty, please!
Just tell her one--

1278
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:36,451
Just--

1279
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,401
What do you
think of this?

1280
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:11,403
Take a look at this.

1281
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:19,411
You're aiming
specifically

1282
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:22,414
at the hotel-room
market now, huh?

1283
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:27,419
You're right.
It's a hotel-room painting.

1284
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:29,338
That's what it is.
It's terrible.

1285
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:30,839
Look at that.

1286
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:32,508
What happened
to the nudes?

1287
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:33,842
Oh, they
weren't selling.

1288
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:36,345
It's cheaper for guys
to buy Playboy.

1289
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:38,514
This is terrible.
Bon voyage.

1290
01:00:38,597 --> 01:00:40,098
I deep-six it.

1291
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:41,850
Sleep
with the fishes.

1292
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:43,352
You're
absolutely right.

1293
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,438
I can smell the room service
on that painting.

1294
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,357
But, you know,
it's you.

1295
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,360
You're around.
That's why I'm painting this way.

1296
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:52,861
You're very unhappy.

1297
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:54,863
You're like the antidote
to exhilaration.

1298
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:57,366
If I take
any more of this in,

1299
01:00:57,449 --> 01:00:59,368
I'll be painting
cats and clowns.

1300
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:00,828
Is it Rebecca?

1301
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:02,871
You haven't
heard from her?

1302
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:04,873
No, I haven't
heard from her.

1303
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:06,375
I have told you

1304
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:07,709
so many times,

1305
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:09,378
she refuses to see me.

1306
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:10,879
No. She won't

1307
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:12,881
answer my calls,

1308
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:14,883
reply to my letters.

1309
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:16,885
It's a total...

1310
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,387
shutoff.

1311
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,389
I've thrown away...
thrown away

1312
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:23,308
the most important
thing in my life

1313
01:01:23,392 --> 01:01:25,561
just like that.

1314
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:28,856
You need
a new outlook.

1315
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:32,359
No, no, no.
Don't scoff.

1316
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:33,819
Listen--
Forget about Rebecca.

1317
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:35,320
How could you

1318
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:36,864
say that to me?

1319
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:38,365
You reminded me

1320
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:39,867
she's the most important

1321
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:41,660
thing in my life

1322
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:43,328
just weeks ago.

1323
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:45,330
I never said that.

1324
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,374
I never--
I never said that.

1325
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:48,876
You said it

1326
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,377
at the tennis court.

1327
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,172
Oh, yeah.

1328
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:54,840
So what if I did?

1329
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:56,884
That was then,
but it's over,

1330
01:01:56,925 --> 01:01:59,386
and you've got to get
on with your life.

1331
01:01:59,428 --> 01:02:00,888
Listen to this--

1332
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:02,389
Buy some
new clothes.

1333
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:04,099
I'm telling you,

1334
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:05,851
we'll learn
a new sport,

1335
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:07,394
I'll throw a party,

1336
01:02:07,436 --> 01:02:09,897
and you'll meet
some new people.

1337
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:12,900
Come on.
We'll have some fun!

1338
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:14,776
I don't think so,
Sean.

1339
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,361
Start with a smile.

1340
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:18,030
Smile,
for heaven sakes.

1341
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,034

you're incredibly

her shopping,

1435

and they're
exercising.

1436
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:51,822
Then I make them
dinner every night.

1437
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:53,323
Right.
And she's O.K.?

1438
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,826
Yeah. The first month,
she cried a lot,

1439
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:58,328
but she hasn't
mentioned you in two weeks.

1440
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,330
I think she's
getting over you.

1441
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:03,834
This is
the car for you.

1442
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:06,378
Listen, Marty,
I need to see her.

1443
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,338
She doesn't
want to see you.

1444
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:11,008
I really have to
speak to her, O.K.?

1445
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:12,634
I want her back.

1446
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:14,970
That's going to take
a lot of convincing.

1447
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:16,513
Do something for me.

1448
01:08:16,597 --> 01:08:19,016
Just, um...organize
a chance meeting.

1449
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,059
Bring her
to a grocery store

1450
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:23,145
or a restaurant,
and I'm there.

1451
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:25,314
I don't know.

1452
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:28,025
Ask Gail if I could
baby-sit your kids Saturday.

1453
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,068
You want to baby-sit
my kids?

1454
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,320
Yes! It's brilliant.

1455
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:33,530
It will convince Rebecca
that I like children.

1456
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:36,325
That will get me
in trouble with Gail,

1457
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:39,369
and you know
how mad she gets.

1458
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:41,872
Marty, please
do this for me!

1459
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:43,832
O.K., O.K.,
I will.

1460
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:46,001
Thanks! Excellent!

1461
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:47,002
Excellent!

1462
01:08:47,044 --> 01:08:48,420
Excellent.

1463
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:04,520
Oh! There we go.

1464
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:06,522
This is fun,
isn't it?

1465
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:07,689
Yeah!

1466
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:09,858
Isn't this jolly,
Molly? Ha ha!

1467
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,360
Listen to this.

1468
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:13,862
" I removed
the victims' brains

1469
01:09:13,904 --> 01:09:16,114
with an ice-cream
scooper."

1470
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:17,366
Awesome, huh?

1471
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:19,034
Shannon, the other
children here

1472
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:21,370
don't want to hear
that beastly stuff,

1473
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:22,871
sojust
read quietly.

1474
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:24,122
Higher!

1475
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:25,374
Yes. Higher.

1476
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:28,210
Now, Patsy, no.
That's not funny, my love.

1477
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:29,962
Don't strangle
the little boy.

1478
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:31,463
But he likes it!

1479
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:33,090
Say uncle!

1480
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:34,466
Just...
Yes, that's it.

1481
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,385
Hey, Sam! Sam!

1482
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:37,719
Oof !.

1483
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:40,973
Shit.
Sam, are you O.K.?

1484
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:42,724
Great. Fine.

1485
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:44,309
Are you all right?

1486
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:45,644
Yeah, yeah. Good.

1487
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:47,479
We're getting on
well here.

1488
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:48,939
Is Rebecca coming?

1489
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:50,315
No.

1490
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,901
No? Marty,
we had an agreement.

1491
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:54,611
She's
in the hospital, Sam.

1492
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:55,988
The hospital?

1493
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:57,990
Why? What's wrong?

1494
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:00,659
There might be a problem
with the pregnancy.

1495
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:02,327
What are you
talking about?

1496
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:05,330
The doctors don't know,
but she's with them.

1497
01:10:05,414 --> 01:10:06,498
Jesus Christ.

1498
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,542
Be careful, Sam!

1499
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:17,176
Hi. Which room is
Rebecca Taylor in, please?

1500
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:18,343
61 5.

1501
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:19,511
Where's that?

1502
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:20,846
Just around
the corner.

1503
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:25,517
Gail!

1504
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:26,727
So?

1505
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,270
Will she be
all right?

1506
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:29,855
Yeah, she's
going to be fine.

1507
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:31,315
Oh!

1508
01:10:31,356 --> 01:10:34,109
Shejust started
having some contractions,

1509
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:35,652
and she started dilating.

1510
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:37,654
They'll keep her overnight,
restrict her movement.

1511
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:40,782
It just sometimes happens
in the seventh month.

1512
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,493
And the baby's O.K.?

1513
01:10:42,576 --> 01:10:44,828
Yeah. Baby's great.

1514
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:50,250
So...can I see her?

1515
01:10:51,877 --> 01:10:53,629
Don't upset her.

1516
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:55,339
I won't.

1517
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,840
Promise?

1518
01:10:56,882 --> 01:10:58,133
Yep. Promise.

1519
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:01,345
O.K.

1520
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:02,888
Thanks.

1521
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:13,649
Hi.

1522
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,025
Hi.

1523
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:22,199
What are you
doing here?

1524
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:25,369
Well, you know I was
worried about...

1525
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,704
about you
and the baby.

1526
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:31,834
We're going to be fine.

1527
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:33,961
Yeah. That's
what Gail said.

1528
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:40,509
[Beeping]

1529
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:44,680
Is this...
is this noise--

1530
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,308
Is that the baby's
heartbeat?

1531
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:50,519
Yeah.

1532
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:52,354
Strong.

1533
01:11:52,437 --> 01:11:53,814
Yeah.

1534
01:11:58,902 --> 01:12:00,779
Beck, I'm sorry.

1535
01:12:02,406 --> 01:12:04,616
I'm so sorry.

1536
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:09,454
I was, um...
a disgrace.

1537
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:12,332
I mean,
I know now exactly

1538
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,334
what a bastard
I was.

1539
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:16,336
I was...I was...
completely selfish,

1540
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,838
and you had
absolutely

1541
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,339
every right

1542
01:12:19,423 --> 01:12:21,341
to walk out on me.

1543
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:25,804
But I just want
you to reconsider.

1544
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:28,265
Sam, please, no--

1545
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:29,808
Let mejust explain.

1546
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,310
I think--

1547
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,228
I know
that I've changed.

1548
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,772
You don't believe
in change.

1549
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:37,774
I do now.
Change is great.

1550
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:39,818
Change is what
it's all about.

1551
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,279
Anyone who doesn't believe
in change is a coward,

1552
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:44,114
which is what I was.

1553
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:47,159
I was scared.
I was scared of ...

1554
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:48,785
of  losing control

1555
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:50,829
and of  losing,
you know,

1556
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:53,790
you or what
we had together

1557
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:56,293
and losing myyouth.

1558
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:58,921
Aren't you now?

1559
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:01,465
No. No, especially
not myyouth.

1560
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:03,091
My youth is here,

1561
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:05,302
doing well.

1562
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:07,805
I'd really love
to believe this.

1563
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:09,306
Listen, I've seen

1564
01:13:09,389 --> 01:13:10,849
the second
ultrasound--

1565
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:13,310
The one you left
at Dr. Thatcher's

1566
01:13:13,393 --> 01:13:15,312
the day I was late.

1567
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:17,815
The point is,
I don't care

1568
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:20,359
what I think or
don't think anymore.

1569
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,820
I don't give
a damn about me.

1570
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:26,615
I'm in love
with my child.

1571
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:28,700
You are?

1572
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:34,081
And I'm completely in love
with you for having it.

1573
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:38,293
Samuel, you almost
ruined everything, and--

1574
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:40,337
Shh. Please.

1575
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,297
It's
the seventh month.

1576
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,341
The baby
can hearyou.

1577
01:13:44,383 --> 01:13:46,969
How do you know that?

1578
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,804
I've been
reading up--

1579
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:50,305
Dr. Brazelton,

1580
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:52,307
What To Expect When
You're Expecting.

1581
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:54,309
I've been
to a Lamaze class.

1582
01:13:54,351 --> 01:13:56,770
I was the only
single father there.

1583
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:57,980
Really?

1584
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:59,648
And I sold
the Porsche.

1585
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:01,441
Oh, I don't believe that.

1586
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:03,819
Yep. Marty gave me
a terrible deal

1587
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:05,654
on a big family car.

1588
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:06,822
He did?

1589
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:08,323
Yes.
It's parked outside.

1590
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:10,325
Car seat,
family extras.

1591
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:13,829
It just needs
a family.

1592
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,418
And, um...

1593
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:23,797
there's this.

1594
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:35,476
Open it.

1595
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:48,864
Would you be my wife?

1596
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:52,701
Yes.

1597
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:03,337
Yes!

1598
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:08,467
On one condition.

1599
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,677
O.K.

1600
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:12,429
Lose the earring.

01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,152
thank you.

1621
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:09,653
I've always wanted

1622
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:11,655
to be carried
over a threshold.

1623
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:12,823
Unh.

1624
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:14,324
Are you all right?

1625
01:16:14,408 --> 01:16:16,827
Yeah. I've got
something to show you.

1626
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:17,995
Yeah?

1627
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:29,006
Oh, Samuel.

1628
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,803
It's...

1629
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:37,264
It's beautiful.

1630
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:40,309
You did this
all byyourself?

1631
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:42,478
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

1632
01:16:44,354 --> 01:16:45,814
thank you.

1633
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:51,320
It's perfect.

1634
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:07,836
How are you feeling,
love?

1635
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,338
Oh, O.K.

1636
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:11,340
My feet are
really swollen.

1637
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:13,342
My back's killing me.

1638
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:14,843
Well, look.

1639
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:16,345
Leave this to me.

1640
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:18,680
I'm going to pull
a few strings.

1641
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:19,848
All right.

1642
01:17:22,893 --> 01:17:25,270
Hi. Look, I'm sorry
to bother you.

1643
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,981
My wife's pregnant,
she's due in two weeks,

1644
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:29,775
and I was wondering...

1645
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:31,109
Lili.

1646
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:34,613
Samuel. Oh.

1647
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:36,281
Hi. What a coincidence.

1648
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:37,950
How-- How long-- How long--

1649
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:40,285
How long have you
been working here?

1650
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:41,787
Three weeks.

1651
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,789
Three weeks.

1652
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:45,290
How are things?

1653
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:48,210
Busy.

1654
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:53,298
Obviously.

1655
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:54,800
So listen, Lili,

1656
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:58,303
how long is the wait
for a table going to be?

1657
01:17:58,387 --> 01:17:59,972
Give me
a few minutes.

1658
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:01,765
I'll seat you
right away.

1659
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:03,308
O.K. Great.

1660
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:04,476
Great.

1661
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:08,814
Well, succes.

1662
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:10,983
She's just setting
the table now.

1663
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:12,317
You know her?

1664
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:13,527
Who?

1665
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:14,945
The hostess.

1666
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:16,822
The hostess?

1667
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:19,575
I've never seen her
before in my life.

1668
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:20,617
Samuel!

1669
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:27,916
She called you Samuel.

1670
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,251
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1671
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:30,794
That's my name.

1672
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:33,297
Yeah, but you're
on a first-name basis

1673
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:35,549
with a woman you've
never seen before?

1674
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:37,926
Well, she took
my first name. See?

1675
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:39,761
Some places take
the first name.

1676
01:18:39,845 --> 01:18:41,680
Some places,
they use last names.

1677
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:43,432
Here, they use
first names.

1678
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:44,475
Oh.

1679
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:45,601
You're silly.

1680
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:46,768
You're paranoid.

1681
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:47,936
Oh.

1682
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,188
Go on.

1683
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:54,818
Aah!

1684
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,069
What is it?

1685
01:18:56,153 --> 01:18:58,322
Aah...shit!

1686
01:18:58,405 --> 01:18:59,615
What? What?

1687
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:01,158
I cut my hand.

1688
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,284
Wow, that's bad.

1689
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:03,452
Samuel--

1690
01:19:03,535 --> 01:19:05,496
Hang on.
This is quite serious.

1691
01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:06,788
That needs stitches.

1692
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:08,290
Samuel,
my water broke.

1693
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:09,625
We'll get you another.

1694
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,168
No. My water broke.

1695
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:13,170
This water broke?

1696
01:19:13,212 --> 01:19:14,296
Yeah.

1697
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:15,756
That means it's time.

1698
01:19:15,839 --> 01:19:16,965
That's right.

1699
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:19,301
We got to go
to the hospital.

1700
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:20,552
Well, go! Go!

1701
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:22,846
Wait! Wait for me!

1702
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:25,474
[Screaming]

1703
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:27,059
[Honking]

1704
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:29,478
I got the doctor's
machine again.

1705
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,938
Where could he be,

1706
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:32,815
at some bloody
doctor's party?

1707
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:34,775
Come on.
Please go faster.

1708
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:36,819
When did you sell
the Porsche?

1709
01:19:39,196 --> 01:19:41,031
I knew it.

1710
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:42,032
What, hon?

1711
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:44,117
You slept with her,
didn't you,

1712
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:46,286
while we were apart?

1713
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:47,788
It was completely
innocent.

1714
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:49,289
Nothing happened.

1715
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:51,291
I was completely
faithful to you.

1716
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:52,960
Lili, wasn't I
completely faithful?

1717
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:54,461
Completely faithful.

1718
01:19:54,545 --> 01:19:55,963
I don't believe you.

1719
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:57,297
If it was innocent,

1720
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:59,466
why did you lie
about knowing her?

1721
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:03,262
Because you were
in a fragile state.

1722
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:05,597
I'm in a more
fragile state now.

1723
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:08,308
I swear on the life
of  my child

1724
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:10,269
I did not sleep
with her.

1725
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:15,274
Samuel, stop!

1726
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:16,441
Jeez!

What?

1736
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:39,756
George,
are you all right?

1737
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,758
I'm having
chest pains.

1738
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:43,635
I'll call an ambulance.

1739
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:46,555
Look, I'm on the way
to the hospital,

1740
01:20:46,597 --> 01:20:48,098

01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:03,947
Get of fthe phone

Limey scumbag!

1745

01:21:09,536 --> 01:21:11,455
Sorry. Where is
Dr. Green?

1748
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:13,207
You tried
his home number?

Yes.

1750
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:15,209
His beeper?

1751

Yes. No!

1752
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:17,961
You have that number?

1753
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:19,630
Yeah. It's around
here somewhere.

1754
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:28,263
Oh, where is that
bloody number?

01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,298
I'll get the doctor.

1804
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:27,466
Come on. Move!

1805
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:28,926
Hey! Don't push me.

1806
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:30,219
I'll get the doctor.

1807
01:23:30,302 --> 01:23:31,470
How are you?

1808
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:32,721
The baby's ready.

1809
01:23:32,805 --> 01:23:34,389
What do you mean,
ready?

1810
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:35,724
To come out!

1811
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,267
Jesus Christ almighty,

1812
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:38,977
where is
the bloody doctor?

1813
01:23:39,061 --> 01:23:40,938
Here I am.

1814
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:42,231
- Aah!
- Aah!

1815
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:43,690
Please don't do that.

1816
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:45,234
No. No.

1817
01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:46,777
Hi. Where's Dr. Green?

1818
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:48,487
Where's our doctor?

1819
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:49,780
Miami.

1820
01:23:49,822 --> 01:23:52,574
He's on vacation.
You are two weeks early.

1821
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:55,244
You're not the replacement
doctor, are you?

1822
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:56,453
Yes, I am.

1823
01:23:56,537 --> 01:23:58,664
No. No.

1824
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:00,207
I want
someone else.

1825
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:01,625
There is nobody else.

1826
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:03,919
There must be!
Find me another doctor!

1827
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:06,338
There's no one else!
All right?

1828
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:07,923
It is a full moon.

1829
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:10,384
Everybody has gone into labor.
Look around!

1830
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:13,095
There are not enough
doctors and nurses.

1831
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:15,055
There are not
enough delivery rooms.

1832
01:24:15,139 --> 01:24:17,766
Unless you want to deliver
this baby yourself,

1833
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:19,560
follow me!

1834
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:21,228
Ow!

1835
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:23,272
Oh, God! I'm O.K.

1836
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:25,315
I'm a little nervous,
O.K.?

1837
01:24:25,357 --> 01:24:27,317
It's my first delivery.

1838
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:31,405
Ifthere aren't
any rooms,

1839
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:33,407
where is she
having the baby?

1840
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:35,409
I'll put her
with another patient.

1841
01:24:35,492 --> 01:24:36,743
We're sharing a room?

1842
01:24:36,827 --> 01:24:39,454
I'm sorry. We're a little
overbooked, O.K.?

1843
01:24:39,538 --> 01:24:40,789
Let's go. Let's go.

1844
01:24:40,873 --> 01:24:42,082
Get this woman

1845
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:43,750
on the delivery table
immediately,

1846
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:44,960
if not later.

1847
01:24:45,043 --> 01:24:46,253
Come on. Let's go.

1848
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:47,963
Where are you taking me?

1849
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:50,132
You're looking good.

1850
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:51,925
You're dilated
to 7 centimeters.

1851
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:53,343
How much is that?

1852
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:54,845
O.K.? Got it?

1853
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:56,597
She's very good, O.K.?

1854
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,056
You look uncomfortable.

1855
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:00,100
I'm going
to raise you down.

1856
01:25:00,184 --> 01:25:01,852
No! Don't touch
anything!

1857
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:03,937
All right.
Get somebody over here!

1858
01:25:04,021 --> 01:25:05,105
Hey, buddy.

1859
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:06,273
No!

1860
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:07,941
What are you doing here?

1861
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:09,276
I'm cruising
for chicks.

1862
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:10,819
I'm having a baby!

1863
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:12,696
Hi. Hi!

1864
01:25:12,738 --> 01:25:14,781
How you feeling?

1865
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:16,950
Isn't this terrible,
just terrible?

1866
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:18,285
Sounds very good.

1867
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:19,620
Where's my husband?

1868
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:21,663
It's a full moon!

1869
01:25:21,747 --> 01:25:23,332
Women are
spouting them out!

1870
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:24,791
Good.
Everybody's old friends.

1871
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,126
Back to work!

1872
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,336
Smile, Doc.

1873
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:28,545
How's she doing?

1874
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,297
Great.
God bless America, O.K.?

1875
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:31,757
Ooh...

1876
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:33,258
Honey, smile for me.

1877
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,886
I love you. Smile.
You're so beautiful.

1878
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:38,680
It's not bad, is it?
It doesn't hurt.

1879
01:25:38,764 --> 01:25:40,724
I want something
for the pain.

1880
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:42,768
O.K. I'll get you
something.

1881
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,269
Knock me out!

1882
01:25:44,311 --> 01:25:47,898
Knock me ow-ow-ow...

1883
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:49,900
Give her something
for the pain!

1884
01:25:49,983 --> 01:25:51,735
You don't want
natural childbirth?

1885
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:52,986
No!

1886
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,072
O.K.
You want Anastasia?

1887
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:56,073
What?

1888
01:25:56,156 --> 01:25:57,241
Drugs, yes?

1889
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:58,242
Yes!

1890
01:25:58,325 --> 01:26:00,202
Give me a moment.
I'm thinking.

1891
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:01,912
You mean
you don't know?

1892
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:02,955
Kind of .

1893
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:04,456
Think,
you Commie bastard!

1894
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:06,250
Shut up,
you Limey prick!

1895
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:07,584
Sorry.

1896
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:09,253
I can't take
the pressure.

1897
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:10,671
Don't yell at me.

1898
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:12,756
Yes. Yes. It's fine.

1899
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,924
Oh...

1900
01:26:14,007 --> 01:26:15,467
Valium.

1901
01:26:15,509 --> 01:26:17,177
Valium's
no good for her!

1902
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:18,428
No, for me!

1903
01:26:18,512 --> 01:26:19,429
No!

1904
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:20,597
I've got it!

1905
01:26:20,681 --> 01:26:21,932
Oh, thank God!

1906
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:24,309
Nurse,
call the anesthesiologist.

1907
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:26,270
This woman needs an enema.

1908
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:27,271
An enema?

1909
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:28,355
- Enema?
- Enema?

1910
01:26:28,438 --> 01:26:30,816
No. Uh...
she needs a pedicure!

1911
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:32,860
This ain't
no beauty parlor.

1912
01:26:32,943 --> 01:26:34,069
Epitaph.

1913
01:26:34,153 --> 01:26:36,238
She's not dead,
you moron!

1914
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,115
Epidermis?
What is it, Epilady?

1915
01:26:38,157 --> 01:26:39,867
Epidural, asshole!

1916
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:42,619
That's right! Yes!
That's what I mean.

1917
01:26:42,703 --> 01:26:44,788
Epidural.
Epidural.

1918
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:46,415
I always
get those confused--

1919
01:26:46,498 --> 01:26:47,916
enema, pedicure, epidermal.

1920
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,793
I should buy myself
a clitoris.

1921
01:26:49,877 --> 01:26:51,086
A thesaurus.

1922
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,297
You don't know
what a clitoris is.

1923
01:26:53,338 --> 01:26:55,924
What are you doing?
Go away from here.

1924
01:26:56,008 --> 01:26:58,135
I'm proud of you.
I love you.

1925
01:26:58,177 --> 01:27:00,137
I hate you!

1926
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:02,764
You did this to me,

1927
01:27:02,848 --> 01:27:05,767
you miserable piece of
dick-brained horseshit

1928
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:09,938
slime-sucking
son of a whore bitch!

1929
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:11,440
That's perfect,
sweetheart.

1930
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:14,109
The kids will love it.
I'll put it--

1931
01:27:14,193 --> 01:27:15,277
Ooh!

1932
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:18,280
Get out! Get out!
You're the one!

1933
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:19,615
You are the one!

1934
01:27:19,698 --> 01:27:21,283
Hi, everyone.
I'm Dr. Newsoe.

1935
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:23,285
I'm here to administer
the epidural.

1936
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:25,287
[Rebecca]
Oh, yes! Thank God!

1937
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:27,789
You inject that thing
into my wife?

1938
01:27:27,873 --> 01:27:30,501
Mm-hmm.
Right into her spine.

1939
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:33,045
Mm-hmm. Good. Excellent.

1940
01:27:33,086 --> 01:27:35,214
[Rebecca]
Whoa...hey!

1941
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:37,257
[Dr. Kosevich]
Look, you see?

1942
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:39,718
That is why women
have the babies--

1943
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:42,513
because men
can't handle the pa-aa--

1944
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:44,389
Hey, you guys!

1945
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:45,724
Get some smelling salts

1946
01:27:45,808 --> 01:27:48,393
and get these men up
of fthe floor!

1947
01:27:48,477 --> 01:27:50,729
[Rebecca]
Help me! Help me!

1948
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:55,234
I need some help.
I need some help.

1949
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:56,735
Oh!

1950
01:27:56,819 --> 01:27:58,237
- Aah!
- Aah!

1951
01:27:58,278 --> 01:27:59,863
No time
for an epidural.

1952
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:00,948
Why?

1953
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:02,241
No time, Doctor.

1954
01:28:02,324 --> 01:28:05,035
I checked her cervix.
She's dilated to 10.

1955
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:08,580
Doctor, this woman
is also dilated to 10.

1956
01:28:08,664 --> 01:28:09,957
Hi, everybody.
Smile big!

1957
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,583
Give me a smile.

1958
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:13,043
What are you doing?

1959
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:15,671
I'm making you a souvenir.
Isn't it great?

1960
01:28:15,754 --> 01:28:17,631
Get that thing
off her face!

1961
01:28:17,714 --> 01:28:19,258
Give it to me!

1962
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:22,302
No! I got a great shot
of the head!

1963
01:28:22,386 --> 01:28:24,346
Asshole.

1964
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:26,014
You broke my camera.

1965
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:27,724
Ooh!

1966
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:29,560
Oh, Sam, I'm sorry.

1967
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:31,061
I got carried away.

1968
01:28:32,437 --> 01:28:34,189
Bastard!

1969
01:28:34,273 --> 01:28:35,274
Be right back.

1970
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:42,156
It's too late
for the medication!

1971
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:43,574
Hold on! I'm coming!

1972
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:46,243
Whoa! Oh!

1973
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:47,828
Keep breathing.

1974
01:28:47,911 --> 01:28:48,829
Breathe. Breathe.

1975
01:28:48,912 --> 01:28:49,830
[Bonk]

1976
01:28:55,085 --> 01:28:56,044
Oh!

1977
01:28:57,629 --> 01:29:01,758
I cannot believe
you're fighting now!

1978
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,260
This is my moment.

1979
01:29:03,302 --> 01:29:04,428
Your moment.

1980
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:05,804
This is my miracle.
