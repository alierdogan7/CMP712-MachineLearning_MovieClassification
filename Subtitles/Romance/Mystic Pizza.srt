1
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,351
Oh, God.

2
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,798
Be seated.

3
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,438
We're gathered here to witness and bless

4
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:26,029
the joining together for ever of William
and Josephina in Christian marriage.

5
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,315
The firm covenant of marriage
is permanent in this lifetime,

6
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,119
because it was established by God.

7
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,919
And once entered into,
it may never be broken

8
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,152
without risk of eternal damnation.

9
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,835
So I ask you now, in the presence
of God, family and friends,

10
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,517
to declare your intentions to enter
a permanent union with one another

11
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,469
for as long as you both
shall draw breath on this earth.

12
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,196
- Josephina.
- Jo!

13
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,396
Jesus Christ. Jojo!

14
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,831
- Hey, look out.
- Think I got eyes in my butt?

15
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,388
That's where your brains are.

16
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,869
- Daisy!
- Yeah.

17
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,791
Think we might get that pizza served
while it's still hot?

18
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,075
I think maybe.

19
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,911
Mr Lopes left his teeth again.

20
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,155
I need a coffee cup, Manny.

21
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,836
Jesus Christ! These shoes are killing me.

22
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,911
Corns at 20. Can you believe it?

23
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,991
Come on. Do you have to talk that way?

24
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,477
- Yeah, Dais. Watch your mouth.
- Oh, excuse me, Holy Mother.

25
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,155
What I meant to say was,
these fucking shoes are killing me.

26
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,708
Put a lid on it, Daisy.

27
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,791
Thank you.

28
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,311
Tourists!

29
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,031
Excuse me. May I have my coffee now?

30
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,115
Jo, what are you doing here?

31
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,077
I am getting out of that house.

32
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,234
My father just put himself 5,000 bucks in
the hole to watch his daughter pass out.

33
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,471
- He is just a little pissed off.
- I thought it was pretty funny.

34
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,994
- Daisy...! Hey, Jo.
- Hi.

35
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,674
Well, it was a first for St Mary's, anyway.

36
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,830
I saw myself ten years from now.

37
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,276
Fat and ugly, and all these kids
swarming around me,

38
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,238
and then I was picking
fish scales out of Bill's boot.

39
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,833
Sounds about on target.

40
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,992
- But I did do the right thing, didn't l?
- Sure.

41
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,311
Jo, the only reason to get married
is to get the hell out of Mystic.

42
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,551
- How's Bill taking it?
- He's still not talking to me.

43
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,791
- Get ready to talk, Jo.
- Hey, check it out.

44
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,995
- Only kidding, man.
- Shut up, you asshole!

45
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,753
Come on, Bill.
Let's go outside and talk, OK?

46
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,631
Please. Bill, please.

47
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,792
I wanna talk to you. Let's just go outside.

48
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,836
Dirtbag.

49
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,951
- So what happened, Jo?
- I don't know.

50
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,429
I just, you know...

51
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,035
I just... When I actually
got up there to do it,

52
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,714
I just couldn't, Bill. I just couldn't.

53
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,317
Bill, it's not that I don't love you.

54
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,959
Because I do, Bill.
I really, really, really do.

55
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,269
You know, I walk into this place,
and everybody stares at me.

56
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,954
Let 'em stare.

57
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,990
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

58
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,355
- And everything's better now?
- Yeah.

59
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,758
So how does November 21st sound?

60
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,508
I don't know. Let's just talk about it later.

61
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,718
- Kiss Mom for me.
- No. I'll be late for my interview.

62
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,793
- Well, then you better hurry.
- I've been three times this week already.

63
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,759
Well, Kat... four, and you go to heaven.

64
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,955
"Kat's such a good girl."

65
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,713
"Where did we go wrong
with her sister Daisy?"

66
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,517
Honey, you'd do just fine
if you just used your head a little more.

67
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,511
Yeah, well, don't worry about me.

68
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,275
I'm not gonna be slingin' pizza
for the rest of my life.

69
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,271
The best pizza.

70
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,750
Hey, Ma. Sausage today.

71
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,595
Oh, great! Ladies, we're gonna eat
soon as we finish this tote.

72
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,989
Hey, Kat. Come on, sit down. Have some.

73
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,594
No, I gotta go.
I got an interview out on Shore Road.

74
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,989
- Another job?
- Yeah, baby-sitting.

75
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,992
You do too much.
Kat's got four jobs already.

76
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,789
- I need the money.
- Kat's been accepted to Yale University.

77
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,599
She got a scholarship
and she's startin' in February.

78
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,750
A part-scholarship.

79
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,831
So you got a boyfriend yet?

80
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,310
Got no time for boys.

81
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,311
Kat, I got a great idea.

82
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,392
Hey, Silvio! You got a job
for my smart kid?

83
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,398
- Terrific, Ma. Bye.
- Bye, honey. Thanks for the pizza.

84
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,792
Where does she get her energy?
All those jobs, and a straight-A student...

85
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,593
- Hello?
- Come on in.

86
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,029
- Katherine?
- Kat.

87
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,196
Hi. Tim Travers.

88
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,271
My daughter did the decorating.

89
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,675
Phoebe, come on down, sweetheart.

90
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,433
Oh, wow! An old Van Cort.

91
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,318
Oh, yeah. I guess it came with the house.

92
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,359
- Are you into stargazing?
- Actually, this is a nautical telescope.

93
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,113
But it's a lot better
than the one I have at home.

94
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,590
- I'm going to take astronomy at college.
- Yeah? What college?

95
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,875
Yale. I start second semester.

96
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,794
Yale, huh? Me, too. Class of '79.

97
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,515
And this beautiful redhead is Phoebe.

98
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,790
Phoebe, this is Kat.

99
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,634
Hi, Phoebe.

100
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,631
How old are you, Phoebe?

101
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,751
- Come on. You know how old you are.
- Six.

102
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,755
Four. Forgive her. She's had a hard week.
Her mother left for England yesterday.

103
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,229
What I'm looking for
is someone to help me out.

104
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,880
Not full time, just until my wife gets back.

105
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,151
Excuse me.

106
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,271
OK, come on, sweetheart.

107
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,634
Hello?

108
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,711
Yeah. Hi, Mrs Farley.

109
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,635
Oh, we got off
to a good start this morning.

110
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,872
Yeah, we knocked down
that wall heading into the...

111
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,235
Glass brick?

112
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,074
Yeah, well...

113
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,392
I like glass brick too, Mrs Farley,
but it doesn't go with your house.

114
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,748
But...

115
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,593
But we've had long talks about staying in
the tradition of the Connecticut house.

116
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,559
- Of course I'll talk to your decorator.
- Do you want to read this with me?

117
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,154
It's time to turn the page, though.

118
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,231
Do you want to turn the page here?

119
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,991
OK. Here we go.

120
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,516
"She was quite the loveliest fairy
in the whole world."

121
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,559
"Her dress was like golden dewdrops,
and there were flowers in her hair."

122
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,677
"And her face was like
the most perfect flower of all."

123
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,514
"She came close to the little rabbit
and kissed him on his velvet nose..."

124
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,876
Well, you certainly
seem to have the touch.

125
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,554
I've been baby-sitting since I was nine.

126
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,313
- I'm nine.
- No, you're not. Do you drive, Kat?

127
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,311
Yeah.

128
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,834
Is there a history of insanity in the family?

129
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,956
They say it skips a generation.

130
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,713
- When can you start?
- Anytime.

131
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,870
Read.

132
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,431
Read.

133
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,678
"'Little rabbit, don't you know who I am?"'

134
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,238
I smell like a couple of buckets of fish.
What you got in there?

135
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,675
- A couple of buckets of fish.
- Terrific.

136
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,433
It's Romeo and Juli-e-et!

137
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,671
- Those boys talkin' to me?
- No, I don't think they is.

138
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,751
- Oh, boy. Uh-oh.
- What?

139
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,278
Come on, Bill. Let's just drink,
and beat 'em up later.

140
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,436
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Daisy.

141
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,511
- Who's buyin'?
- I'll buy.

142
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,591
- Winning any?
- No.

143
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,875
- Got a smoke for me, Jo?
- Yeah.

144
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,240
- OK, what do you want to drink?
- White wine?

145
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,632
I'll have white wine too, please.

146
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,756
- George?
- Lite.

147
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,673
Can I get two white wines,
two beers, and one of 'em lite?

148
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,472
Dais?

149
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,551
Oh, he is cute.

150
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,955
Yeah, if you like white bread.

151
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,631
Rich white bread.

152
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,831
Ladies? Here you go.

153
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,999
For you.

154
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,117
Look at that punk. I would look
good in a coat like that, huh?

155
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,189
OK, let's get some action goin', huh?

156
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,192
Ten bucks says
I get three bull's-eyes in a row.

157
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,075
Make it fifty.

158
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,879
And, between throws, off a shot of tequila.

159
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,675
- Three tequilas.
- This guy's nuts.

160
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,751
Yeah.

161
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,915
He said that he could hit three
in the bull's-eye. Can you do that?

162
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,468
I can do the three shots of tequila.

163
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,551
George.

164
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,554
Three in a row.

165
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,631
Starting now.

166
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,629
No way.

167
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,157
All right, I'll take that fifty.

168
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,991
Yes, sir! Thank you.

169
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,550
Let's play some pool.

170
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,710
It's not that I don't like playing pool.

171
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,598
- But why can't we do it at my house?
- Lorna?

172
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,671
No! I'm the worst. Really.

173
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,675
Excuse me.

174
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,830
Do you play?

175
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,675
Sure.

176
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,910
OK. Why don't you break 'em?

177
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,191
Sorry, partner.

178
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,919
OK. It's our turn, sweetheart.

179
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,311
Right, here's what we want.

180
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,916
Right down here, honey.
The one with the orange stripe.

181
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,959
Right on the orange, nice and easy.
Just send it right down there.

182
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,391
Darn.

183
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,712
Well, take it easy, honey. That's why
we play boy-girl. To even things out.

184
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,231
Excuse me.

185
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,109
I think we got a ringer here.

186
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,788
She is really good at this.

187
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,508
I know what you are. A hustler.

188
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,750
Lorna!

189
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,908
Isn't that the right word, Charlie?
Like in that pool-hall movie.

190
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,436
Fast game.

191
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,511
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

192
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,075
- Quite a game.
- Anytime.

193
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,234
Can we get out of here? Please?

194
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,631
Shit.

195
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,874
- Daisy?
- Hi, Mom.

196
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,678
You going to 11 o'clock mass?

197
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,750
No. I went last night.

198
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,555
I got to get lunch ready. Uncle Vic
and Aunt Rosalie are coming' over.

199
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,915
Daisy? You help me with lunch.

200
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,594
- Kat will.
- Thanks a lot.

201
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,996
She gone?

202
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,519
Do you like it?

203
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,390
160 bucks? Are you out of your mind?

204
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,471
I'm going to return it

205
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,351
after I've worn it...

206
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,951
somewhere.

207
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,511
Daisy?

208
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,955
Wait up, Phoebe.

209
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,951
- Daddy!
- Hi, sweetheart.

210
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,278
- How was the story hour?
- I got a library card.

211
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,797
- That's great. What'd you get?
- I got The Yellow House

212
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,316
and Barbra's Little Girl.

213
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,832
- She picked them herself.
- I'll bet. Are you hungry, Phoebes?

214
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,989
- Yes.
- OK.

215
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,279
One baloney and cheese on white,
no crust, coming right up.

216
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,278
OK. Now, why don't you take your books
and your sandwich out on the porch?

217
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,557
- And you know the rule, right?
- Don't get off the porch.

218
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,710
I'll be right out.

219
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,351
Later, alligator.

220
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,029
This should keep us up to date, Kat.

221
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,513
- There you go.
- Thank you.

222
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,520
I always wondered what
the inside looked like.

223
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,751
It's going to look a hell of a lot
better than this, I promise you.

224
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,071
- I'm impressed already.
- You want to see the best part?

225
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,913
- Yeah.
- OK. Phoebe?

226
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,956
- What?
- I'm going' upstairs, OK?

227
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,031
- OK.
- Don't go out the porch.

228
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,791
- Wow! This place is huge.
- Not bad for a summer cottage.

229
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,633
Actually, the original house
was built in 1880

230
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,918
by a wealthy merchant named Elias
Montrose for his English bride, Elizabeth.

231
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,991
Watch your step.

232
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,516
They were married in London
after a whirlwind romance.

233
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,595
It's gorgeous.

234
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,551
What a view!
Oh, I'd put a telescope right out here.

235
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,989
This is where Elias would watch his ships
come in and unload their treasures.

236
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,959
- Like what?
- Teas and spices from Ceylon.

237
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,952
Silks, pearls, sapphires from India.

238
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,555
I thought the only things that came
through Mystic were lobster and cod.

239
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,155
The story has a sad ending.
Elias returned to Mystic

240
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,357
and Elizabeth stayed in London
to settle her affairs.

241
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,193
On her way here, her ship was lost at sea.

242
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,592
And old Elias spent all the rest
of the days of his life

243
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,148
watching for her ship.

244
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,553
They say you can still hear his ghost
walking on this balcony on stormy nights.

245
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,634
Of course, it could be this squeaky board.

246
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,075
Are you going to fix it?

247
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,396
Wouldn't dare.

248
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,831
There she is. That was going to be
my wedding present from Bill.

249
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,795
It used to be called the Rose,
after his mom.

250
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,394
The man is a prince, Jo.

251
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,829
Miller Late. I take it back - the man's a god.

252
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,559
Dais, he keeps that there
for him and the guys.

253
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,428
- Dais, he's not going to like that.
- Juju, relax! Trust me.

254
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,229
You're going to wiggle your sweet ass,
and he's going to forget all about it.

255
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,029
- St Katherine with a beer?
- I drink when I want.

256
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,759
You're a real lush.
You screw ten guys a weekend, too.

257
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,798
- No, that's your department.
- You're damn straight it is.

258
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,236
This is very pleasant, OK?
Let's have some fun tonight, OK?

259
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,750
Gosh, you know what I wish? I wish
Bill did not have such a gorgeous body.

260
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,831
- Yeah, right!
- No, I mean it.

261
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,630
It would make things so much easier.
I wouldn't think about him all the time.

262
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,511
Gosh, you know something? I get really
turned on just looking at his wrists.

263
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,511
- His wrists?
- Yes. They're so thick and strong.

264
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,558
- Maybe something's the matter with me.
- I think so.

265
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,915
- I think it's called being in love.
- Oh, no.

266
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,913
- Are you saying I should married him?
- No, she's not.

267
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,514
Kat, look. There's a comet. Right there.

268
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,277
- No, that's just a shooting star.
- It's thrilling.

269
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,190
A comet looks like a tadpole. It's got
a round head and a long blazing tail.

270
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,078
I know what one looks like.

271
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,109
A sperm. A big sperm.
She's got one on the ceiling.

272
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,558
She goes to sleep every night
with a giant sperm flying over her head.

273
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,839
You know what? Ten years from now,
she's going to be a famous astrologer.

274
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,151
- Who are you going to be, Daisy?
- It's "astronomer".

275
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,270
How the hell do I know where I'll be?
I could be dead for all I know.

276
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,794
Daisy! That's bad luck.

277
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,709
- Look, Jo, you've got Bill.
- Right.

278
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,519
You've apparently got brains.

279
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,036
All I've got is this, and these.

280
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,234
- So to hell with both of you.
- No. I don't think so.

281
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,669
- Come back here, Daisy.
- Daisy! Wait up.

282
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,636
I really like old houses
like this, Mrs. Abuja.

283
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,031
I'm sorry.

284
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,514
My family lives in an old house, too.

285
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,156
The water pipes, they burst just about
every winter. My dad gets really pissed.

286
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,599
Well, he gets very upset.

287
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,873
Oh, there you are. You didn't tell me
you were going' out for dinner.

288
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,790
- I didn't know I was.
- Well, you could stay here for dinner.

289
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,713
- I got some nice lost...
- No, thanks, Ma.

290
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,520
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Abuja.

291
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,273
You don't have to come home so late.

292
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,749
I know how long it takes to have dinner.

293
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,196
Daisy

294
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,077
Abuja...

295
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,039
You are a very difficult woman to find.

296
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,873
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

297
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,996
Charlie...?

298
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,437
Charles Gordon Windsor. Junior.

299
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,275
Figures.

300
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,673
- Can I get you something?
- No, thanks.

301
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,149
But I think your mother could use a drink.

302
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,351
Shut up.

303
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,596
Sit.

304
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,508
I'll be right with you.

305
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,880
So, get out the spare.

306
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,556
That...

307
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,311
That was the spare.

308
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,071
Yes, that's going to do it.

309
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,271
OK, I got the idea.

310
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,071
Yes!

311
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,878
So tell me, Junior, how come
you're not at your lvy League school,

312
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,352
picking ivy, or whatever you do there?

313
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,352
Why do that,
when I could be here with you?

314
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,313
I needed a little vacation from law school.

315
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,516
Oh.

316
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,319
In other words, you're being a bum.

317
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,354
Exactly.

318
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,874
I got nothing' against bums.

319
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,637
Excuse me, Mr. Windsor.

320
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,480
I hope you and the young lady
enjoyed your dinners.

321
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,551
It was wonderful.

322
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,311
Thank you, sir.

323
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,355
Which one is yours?

324
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,319
My dad's is the 62-foot
two-misted schooner there.

325
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,631
Not bad.

326
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,151
Abuja.

327
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,112
The stars have been,
and still are, used by sailors

328
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,634
to help them determine
their positions at sea.

329
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,314
Remember now, there are
no roads or signposts

330
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,914
or gas stations
where you can ask for directions.

331
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,910
Hi, Kat.

332
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,598
Now we'll show what it's like
to toss around at sea

333
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,353
with the stars your only hope
of getting back home.

334
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,351
How would you find your way?

335
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,069
If you had made a study of the skies,
as ancient seafarers did,

336
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,799
you would realize that
at a given date and time,

337
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,269
each star marks a particular point in the...

338
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,711
A particular...

339
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,236
A particular point in the sky.

340
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,835
So what you would do is measure
each point, each star, with a sextant.

341
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,914
- Hi.
- Hi. You were great.

342
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,992
- I kind of flubbed it today.
- No, no. We both loved it.

343
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,197
- Didn't we, Phoebe?
- Mommy, can we please go home?

344
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,351
It's nap time.

345
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,990
Can you change me, Kat?

346
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,310
Totallin' up?

347
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,516
We're gonna have to do better than this.

348
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,795
Oh, come on, Leona. It'll pick up.

349
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,509
Yeah, in June, with the tourists.
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em.

350
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,955
Absolutely.

351
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,270
Hey, Leona, your boyfriend's on.

352
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,750
Hector Pleshette here
with this week's gastronomic report.

353
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,317
In New Haven, a place called Nubby's.

354
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,675
"Grubby's" would be a better name for it.

355
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,514
I had to ask three times
before I received a clean fork.

356
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,798
Black angel hair pasta
with Dalmatian sauce.

357
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,077
Don't ask me what it is. Just don't try it.

358
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,551
A culinary disaster.
Overpriced and pretentious.

359
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,192
We should get him to come here. A good
review would bring in tons of people.

360
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,511
- I wouldn't let that moron in the door.
- Why not?

361
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,989
I bet if we had designer pizza...

362
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,152
- lt'd taste like that magazine there.
- Oh, come on, Leona.

363
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,552
A little dry white wine, some
smoked clams, sun-dried tomatoes...

364
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,632
- I think we should do it, Leona.
- Listen, young ladies.

365
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,315
We have the real thing right here.
The Mystic Pizza.

366
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,994
Spices from the Algarve back in Portugal.

367
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,870
My grandfather taught my father
how to make it. And my father taught me.

368
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,589
And one of these days, when I retire,
I just might teach one of you.

369
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,193
It's tradition. And you

370
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,475
don't monkey with tradition!

371
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,358
- Amen.
- Leona?

372
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,829
Will you please tell us what's in the pizza?

373
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,393
Please, Leona.

374
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,516
..goat cheese popovers I would kill for.

375
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,716
It ain't goat cheese, I'll tell you that.

376
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,991
There you go. Hop into bed.

377
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,354
Mommy brushes my hair.

378
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,431
Hold still.

379
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,476
- Mommy lives in England now.
- Oh, no, she doesn't.

380
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,358
She's just there working.
She'll be home in a few weeks.

381
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,431
I know.

382
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,231
We're not getting a divorce.

383
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,199
- Well, of course not.
- OK.

384
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,829
Time for bed.

385
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,911
Good night.

386
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,676
All righty. Scootch in.
I'll read you to sleep.

387
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,354
God knows where
she picks these things up.

388
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,433
- Read!
- All righty. I hear and obey, master.

389
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,276
What story do you want?

390
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,716
- Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night, Kat.

391
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,080
All righty, sweetheart.
What have we here?

392
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,151
Go ahead. Turn the page.

393
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,471
"Uncle Wiggly Learns to Dance."

394
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,396
Kat?

395
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,831
Here.

396
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,832
Better take this. It's gotten chilly out.

397
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,273
- Daddy!
- Be right there.

398
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,871
I'd better go.

399
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,508
Coming, master.

400
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,152
Each room is more
breathtaking than the next.

401
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,598
The dining room table seats 45,
and weighs a whopping 4,000 pounds.

402
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,319
It's the world's only
marble-top extension table.

403
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,358
It took 15 craftsmen a year to build.

404
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,434
If you're wondering if this is the ultimate
fairy-tale home, check out the bedroom...

405
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,397
Hi, Kat.

406
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,674
Mrs Post's daughter,
the privileged princess,

407
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,957
awoke to flowers on the walls,
on the silver door hinges,

408
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,031
even on the four-poster bed.

409
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,270
"Lifestyles " is proud to bring you

410
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,319
this once-in-a-lifetime look
at America 's number one home.

411
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,279
- I can relate.
- Over lunch on the patio...

412
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,631
Nice sweater.

413
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,791
- Kat?
- Good night.

414
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,873
- Whose sweater?
- Tim's.

415
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,389
Tim's?

416
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,435
- So it's "Tim" now?
- Shut up.

417
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,112
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

418
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,078
Daisy, I'm his baby-sitter,
and it got chilly tonight.

419
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,674
And he's married.

420
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,036
If he weren't married,
he wouldn't need a baby-sitter.

421
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,078
Looks to me like
he's puttin' the moves on you.

422
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,515
- You're disgusting.
- OK.

423
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,395
I'm disgusting. But just in case...

424
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,070
The guy wears 'em.

425
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,232
Daisy...!

426
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,916
Jojo!

427
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,432
Where is she? Kat, have you seen Jojo?

428
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,477
Just a minute.

429
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,551
Hi.

430
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,991
Hi.

431
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,031
Sorry, Leona.

432
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,990
Hey, Kat. Table six wants dessert.

433
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,395
Ah, I'd love to stay and chat.

434
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,439
- Here you go.
- Miss, this pizza is unbelievable.

435
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,193
- Thank you.
- What is in that sauce?

436
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,350
Oh, I'm sorry. That's top secret.

437
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,995
She won't even tell us what's in it.

438
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,879
Here you go.

439
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,520
Hey, Jo, can you switch days off with me?

440
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,115
- I guess so. Why? What's up?
- Tim needs me on Friday.

441
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,795
Don't do it, Jo. You'll be contributing
to the downfall of a saint.

442
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,919
Butt out, will you? Let's talk
about the preppy with the Porsche.

443
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,630
Holy shit!

444
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,711
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

445
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,751
Come on. Let's go.

446
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,836
Daisy.

447
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,271
Make yourself comfortable.

448
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,550
What's the matter?
Can't afford to pay your light bill?

449
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,916
My father turns off all the power
when nobody's here.

450
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,195
- You're here.
- Yeah...

451
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,510
But he doesn't wanna be reminded.

452
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,195
Is it OK to sit on the sofa?

453
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,430
You can do anything you want on it.

454
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,150
It must get kinda lonely here.

455
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,275
I kinda like it this time of year.

456
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,430
No one's around.

457
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,715
It's nice and quiet.

458
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,708
Is this a habit with you?

459
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,032
Picking up townies and luring them
to your big, fancy house?

460
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,149
You're the first.

461
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,910
So how is it?

462
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,629
So far... it's pretty nice.

463
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,071
And for you?

464
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,315
Dais?

465
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,879
Charlie? Follow the breadcrumbs.

466
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,755
This is my parents' room.

467
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,831
I figured.

468
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,030
Is that my father's shirt?

469
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,111
D'you think he'll miss it?

470
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,551
No.

471
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,669
Hey, Junior.

472
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,797
Yeah... Arujo?

473
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,991
Dais.

474
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,315
I told you I was taking'
a vacation from law school.

475
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,634
Yeah?

476
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,915
I was thrown out.

477
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,276
I cheated on a final.

478
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,475
Why?

479
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,551
I panicked.

480
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,359
I was flunking a course, and I panicked.

481
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,799
People flunk courses.
It happens all the time.

482
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,871
But not to me.

483
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,191
Not to Chuck Windsor's son.

484
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,031
You shouldn't have lied.

485
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,515
But I'm glad you told me.

486
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,318
Don't do it again.

487
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,674
Which? Cheat or lie?

488
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,076
Either.

489
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,718
- Hi, Kat.
- How was the poker game?

490
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,189
Great. I won a buck more than I owe you.

491
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,235
- I just checked on Phoebe.
- How is she?

492
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,153
Fine. I hope you don't mind
my using the telescope.

493
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,993
No, no. I'm delighted
to have someone use the thing.

494
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,231
You want a soda or some juice?

495
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,069
I'll have some wine.

496
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,756
- What's up there, anyway?
- Well, have a look.

497
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,992
I see kind of a... fuzzy clump.

498
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,233
That's Pleiades, the Seven Sisters.

499
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,118
Do you see six bright stars
and one very faint one?

500
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,675
Yeah.

501
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,752
That's actually a cluster
of several hundred stars.

502
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,038
Only those few are visible from here.
They're over 400 light years from Earth.

503
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,111
They're a sign of fall.

504
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,996
Am I babbling?

505
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,196
Yeah.

506
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,838
No...

507
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,911
I mean, I like it.

508
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,310
OK, then, I'll tell you one more thing.

509
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,470
It's a great night to spot comets.

510
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,233
New moon, dark skies...

511
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,311
May I propose a toast?

512
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,635
- Sure.
- To new moons, dark skies... and comets.

513
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,311
Fuzzy clump.

514
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,830
- Let me take this off.
- OK.

515
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,676
Be careful, Bill. It's expensive.

516
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,191
Here we go.

517
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,510
I can't do this with him starin' at me.

518
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,237
- Let's just go to my room.
- Are you crazy? Your parents are home.

519
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,311
No, no. They're asleep.

520
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,595
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

521
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,114
- I'm goin' home.
- What?

522
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,590
Bill!

523
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,558
No, please. Please, Bill. Please don't.

524
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,710
Jo...

525
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,633
- I gotta go.
- Just one more kiss.

526
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,196
- What are you doin'?
- Poor little thing.

527
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,635
All it needs is a little bit of fresh air.

528
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,196
- Jo!
- What?

529
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,919
I'm tellin' you, I love you.

530
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,554
- I think we should make a commitment.
- OK.

531
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,516
But... first things first, though.

532
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,675
- Cut it out!
- What?

533
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,239
Jo!

534
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,393
Come on. I'm tellin' ya,
I think we ought to get married.

535
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,359
Bill, if you say that word one more time
to me, I'm gonna scream.

536
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,756
Married.

537
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,632
Holy shit!

538
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,629
- No, Pops!
- Listen, Mr Barboza. Nothing happened.

539
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,996
Listen, I promise you...

540
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,791
It's not what you think.
Good night, Mrs Barboza.

541
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,269
Get the hell outta here!

542
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,310
- Thank you, Mr Barboza!
- Run, Bill, run!

543
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,995
- Josephina!
- Son of a bitch!

544
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,915
So there's Pops, all 130 pounds of him,
tryin' to knock the shit out of Bill.

545
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,596
Bill's just standin' there tryin' to be polite
and pullin' his pants up at the same time.

546
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,593
- I nearly peed in my pants.
- So close to a clean getaway.

547
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,149
Where's the prince of prep school
this weekend?

548
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,119
In Greenwich visiting his grandmother.
She's 90 and drives her own Rolls.

549
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,634
- Big deal.
- He'll be back Sunday night.

550
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,233
Hey, Jo!

551
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,915
Whaddaya think?

552
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,310
That isn't funny!
Whose side are you guys on?

553
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,830
You know something, Bill?
You are a real asshole!

554
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,230
- What?
- Thank God I didn't marry him.

555
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,074
What, you think this is
gonna make me marry you? Do you?

556
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,630
Well, it's not, cos I don't have to
marry an asshole. It's the '80s.

557
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,076
- Why would I marry an asshole?
- Jo, come on.

558
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,311
You can't force me to do something
I'm not ready to do, Bill.

559
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,839
- Come on! I was joking.
- And until I am, if I ever am,

560
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,229
the answer is no.

561
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,153
- But it's just a joke.
- No!

562
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,351
Man!

563
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,150
Asshole.

564
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,353
There is no way in the world... He's sayin'
he brings in more than we do. No way.

565
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,155
Jojo, would you hurry up?
He's gonna see us.

566
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,870
- Hey, Bill! Get your dumb butt out here.
- Shut up. We shouldn't be doing this.

567
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,077
What has he got back here?
I mean, God, what a stink.

568
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,875
I told you he had a spare key.

569
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,794
Come on, let's go.
Wait, Kat. I can't drive. I'm too plastered.

570
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,793
There you go. This is so great.
This is just too great.

571
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,871
"Nympho", my ass.

572
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,991
Get a horse, you asshole.

573
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,109
Ooh your kisses
sweeter than honey

574
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,317
But guess what? So is my money

575
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,470
All I want you to do for me

576
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,028
Is give it to me

577
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,236
Respect, just a little bit

578
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,878
Just a little bit

579
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,748
R-E-S-P-E-C-T,
find out what it means to me

580
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,435
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, take care, TCB

581
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,399
Sock it to me sock it to me

582
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,871
Hey, you guys. Where are we going?

583
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,030
- The country club.
- Yes!

584
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,995
- Come on. It's gonna be great.
- No, you guys. No.

585
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,599
- Why?
- Come on, live a little.

586
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,274
Kitty-cat Kat?

587
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,591
Shit.

588
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,191
We made it.

589
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,990
- Oh, boy.
- Can I have a smoke?

590
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,071
Yes.

591
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,118
Thanks.

592
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,998
- This is really the life, huh?
- Absolutely.

593
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,073
Hey, Dais? You wanna do the jitterbug?

594
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,197
Do I wanna do the jitterbug?! I lead.

595
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,589
Hold this for me, Kat.

596
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,235
Come on, you guys. Let's get goin'.

597
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,515
- Why?
- Cos it's boring.

598
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,114
It isn't boring, this is fun.

599
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,430
You gotta relax and enjoy yourself.

600
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,591
"Outta town".

601
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,391
Son of a bitch!

602
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,031
I'm gonna kill him! I'm so stupid!

603
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:40,398
It's OK, Dais. Please?

604
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,916
- Gimme the keys.
- No, Dais, I'll drive.

605
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,197
Gimme the keys, Kat.
Gimme the goddamn key!

606
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,755
Kat... Daisy, you don't need the key.

607
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,718
What are you going to do with the car?

608
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,271
Jo, we gotta stop her.

609
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,828
- Daisy, no!
- Daisy, what are you doing?

610
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,429
- My car!
- It's beautiful.

611
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,477
- What are you doing?
- Greenwich, my ass!

612
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,951
Daisy, look.
Daisy, this is Serena Windsor, my sister.

613
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,591
Serena, this is Daisy Arujo.

614
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,631
Daisy.

615
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,191
Hi.

616
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,392
Hi.

617
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,038
How was I to know? You said
you were at your grandmother's.

618
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,671
My grandmother had a migraine. I called
you when I came back. You were out.

619
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,308
- I fucked up.
- Yeah, but you gave it 100% effort.

620
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,789
- You're weird.
- I'm weird?

621
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,113
Think you can give us a lift?

622
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,711
- Bill.
- Hey.

623
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,993
I'm sorry for taking the truck.

624
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,550
That's OK. I'm sorry, too.

625
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,279
I took it off.

626
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,639
Guess what. My sister and her husband
are going to Marblehead for three days.

627
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,554
- Yeah?
- What do you mean, "yeah"?

628
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,791
Bill, we have the apartment
for three days and three nights.

629
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,350
- Yeah, well, I don't think so, Jo.
- What, are you crazy, Bill?

630
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,874
- Three whole nights.
- Yeah, I heard ya.

631
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,991
I don't want to.

632
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,159
Bill, I said I was sorry.

633
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,553
Your parents' place, my parents' place,

634
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,599
your sister's apartment,
the damn john at the pizza parlour.

635
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,791
What, Jake?

636
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,197
I'm tellin' ya, Jo, that I love you.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

637
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,556
When people love each other,
they should make a commitment.

638
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,108
They should have a wedding, in a church,

639
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,510
with the blessings of God, for chrissakes!

640
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,196
Don't you get it, Jo?
I'm telling you that I love you.

641
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,469
And all you love is my dick.

642
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,313
Do you know how that makes me feel?

643
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,630
I...

644
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,390
I'm sorry.

645
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,038
Come on, let's go.

646
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,635
I'm finished, Jo. I can't do this any more.

647
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,230
Let's go!

648
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,271
Hi, Manny.

649
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,151
Hi, how's it goin'?

650
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,470
What? What are you guys looking at?

651
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,915
You're three hours early.

652
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,231
- Yeah. So?
- Yeah, so you look kinda weird.

653
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,392
- What's up?
- Nothing. Nothing much.

654
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,319
You pregnant, Jojo?

655
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,391
Bite your tongue, Leona.

656
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,231
Somethin's goin' on.

657
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,919
It's just... It's just that
I broke up with Bill this morning.

658
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,918
- Oh, shit!
- No. It's no big deal. Really.

659
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,039
I mean, Bill and I haven't been
getting along at all, and...

660
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,271
I just couldn't do it any more,
so I told him, and...

661
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,670
You know, he got real upset
and started to cry.

662
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,751
But I had to do it, you know?

663
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,157
Hey, it's OK. I mean, it had to happen.

664
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,028
I'm fine. In fact, I don't know,
I feel kinda good.

665
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,992
I mean, if you think about it,
Bill and I are so different.

666
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,472
Everything he wants, I don't.
The marriage, the kids, all that stuff.

667
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:44,997
I mean, I really want that stuff.
Real bad. I just don't want it now.

668
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,996
He doesn't understand.
If he really loved me, he'd wait.

669
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,668
But I guess if I really loved him,
I'd marry him.

670
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,751
Maybe I don't love Bill.

671
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,595
But I really do love Bill, though.
He really... He understands me so well.

672
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,754
No, no. You guys are right.

673
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,590
I don't need Bill.
I've got a lot of things going.

674
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,550
- Leona?
- What is it, honey?

675
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,030
One of these days you're gonna tell me
what you put in that pizza.

676
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,111
When you retire, right?

677
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,668
Absolutely. When I retire.

678
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,836
OK. So I could run this place, and...
I don't need Bill to do that.

679
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,310
And, Kat, you're not the only one
with brains. I could go to college.

680
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,676
I could take that course.
What is it? Economics.

681
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,476
OK. Thanks, you guys.
You guys are great.

682
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:49,475
You know, helping me out, supporting
me, telling me I made the right decision.

683
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,113
I think I have to go to the bathroom.

684
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,031
Men!

685
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:21,755
- Hi. I'm home.
- Hi. How's Mrs Farley today?

686
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,913
Oh, fine. She only called four times,
but it looks like we'll wrap it up on time.

687
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,877
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Hi.

688
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,030
Did you catch anything?

689
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,429
- She sure is in a good mood.
- She's excited about Mom coming home.

690
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,750
Yeah. Just a little while longer.

691
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,829
- What's she like?
- Who?

692
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,911
- Mrs Travers.
- Nikki?

693
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,874
- What do you wanna know?
- Where'd you meet her?

694
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,951
- At school.
- Yale?

695
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,591
Freshman year. It's funny to think
you have all that in front of you.

696
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,955
I look at the way you examine everything,

697
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,077
and I remember exactly how I felt
when I started Yale.

698
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,469
- How did you feel?
- Scared shitless.

699
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,436
But great. I mean, it was so exciting.

700
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,115
I felt like I was really gonna... Iive.

701
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,549
And you did, didn't you?

702
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,631
Yeah, sure. Here I am.

703
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,630
Aw, Kat. Stuff happens.

704
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,156
What can I say?

705
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,632
Hey, aren't they gonna kill you
at that pizza place?

706
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,950
No, they'll cover for me.

707
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,474
Hey, rascal. Come here.

708
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,311
Gotcha! And I'm gonna
squeeze you like a ball.

709
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,595
- Fly me.
- You wanna fly? OK.

710
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:05,679
Shit! Where the hell is Kat? She was
supposed to be here half an hour ago.

711
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,832
- Easy!
- Oh, yeah. She called.

712
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,117
They needed her baby-sitting.
She said you'd cover for her.

713
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,113
I'm supposed to have dinner with
Charlie's parents tonight. She knows that.

714
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,031
Shit!

715
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,111
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Take it easy. You're not missin' much.

716
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,555
My dad is not exactly a load of laughs.

717
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,792
- Your mom's gonna think I blew her off.
- My mother doesn't think. Don't worry.

718
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,040
- We'll do it another time.
- All right.

719
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,156
- I'll call ya.
- OK.

720
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,953
That's what you're drivin' these days?

721
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,589
Well, it smells a hell of a lot
better than the Porsche.

722
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,551
Right.

723
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,831
Hi, Dais.

724
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,551
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't show up.

725
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,513
I said I'm sorry. Why are you
being such a bitch about it?

726
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,478
Right. I'm a bitch and you're an angel,
no matter what.

727
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,438
Should have been stamped
on our birth certificates.

728
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,717
What the hell's the big deal?
You unload shifts on me.

729
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,839
Well, you knew I was supposed to meet
Charlie's parents tonight.

730
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,269
- Dais, I'm sorry. I forgot.
- Tim needed you, right?

731
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,989
Just what the hell do you two do
together? That's what I'd like to know.

732
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,958
- To you, it would sound stupid.
- It would sound pathetic.

733
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,795
Daddy boffing the baby-sitter is a really
old story. It happens all the time.

734
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,517
We talk, we read,
we listen to Mozart sometimes...

735
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,674
You really believe this 30-year-old guy
is gonna leave his wife for you?

736
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,433
You're livin' in
a fuckin' romance novel, Kat.

737
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,830
Oh, yeah. Boffing, fucking, screwing.

738
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,429
The great Daisy. Nobody's fool.

739
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,310
Why don't you start taking cash for
your services? It would be more honest.

740
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,231
Wipe your conscience.

741
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,791
Shit!

742
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,395
- Jojo. Pick up.
- OK, I'm coming.

743
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,471
OK, two lite beers.

744
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,591
This is my table.

745
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,517
Can we change that sausage
to pepperoni?

746
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,591
Sure. Why not?

747
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,068
Hey, Jo. Do me a favour.
Sit for Phoebe tomorrow?

748
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,470
Yeah, right.
Baby-sittin' for the baby-sitter?

749
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:09,395
I think I'm gonna puke.
Yeah, I'll do it, Kit-Kat.

750
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,515
- You know, I feel a little ridiculous.
- You're not scared, are you?

751
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,512
- Stormy nights?
- Kat, it's just a story.

752
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,430
We'll see.

753
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,954
Hope old Elias like pizza.

754
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,951
Come on, let's eat.

755
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,993
It'll be a shame
when they finish this place.

756
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,953
Yeah. We all wish
we could stop time, don't we?

757
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,356
Well, I'm afraid it won't work.
Soon you'll be at school.

758
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,710
Contractor'll take over from here.

759
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,631
Nikki comes home.

760
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,716
What was that?

761
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,590
- Elias Montrose!
- I told you so.

762
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,195
Wait here.

763
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,436
Run, run, run.

764
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,390
Oh, there they are.

765
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:51,189
How's your mother, Kat?
Did you get her the medicine in time?

766
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,717
Nikki.

767
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,878
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

768
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,110
I was lucky. I caught that morning plane.

769
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,033
- Well, you look great.
- Yeah, so do you.

770
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,396
Hi. I'm Nikki Travers. You must be Kat.

771
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,194
Oh, I hope your mother's feeling better.

772
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,556
Well, thank you for everything
that you've done for Phoebe.

773
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,313
You're all she talks about on the phone.

774
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,595
She's a wonderful little girl.

775
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,839
Kat, we should really get goin'.
Cos your mom must want us back.

776
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,993
Nice meeting you, Mr Travers.
Nice meeting you, Mrs Travers.

777
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,799
Tim, aren't you forgetting something?

778
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,158
- Jojo, how much do we owe you?
- Oh, no. That's OK.

779
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,231
I don't need any money.

780
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,999
Thanks. Come on, Kat.

781
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,799
Kat, I didn't know what to say.
The doorbell rang, I thought it was you,

782
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,236
and there was this person
just standing there. I almost...

783
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,311
I almost peed in my pants.

784
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,911
I don't think she knows.

785
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,478
OK, all right, so he had his arm
around you. So what, right?

786
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,755
I mean, what if your mother had died?

787
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,832
He was just being nice.
People do that, you know.

788
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:41,439
She might know, though.
She looks really smart.

789
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:48,189
Holy shit, Kat. You don't think
she'd come after you or anything, do you?

790
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:52,239
No, she wouldn't do that.
I don't think she would do that.

791
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:57,155
Oh, God, Kat. Well, at least it isn't
your fault, you know. It's not your fault.

792
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,279
Oh, God. Kat, this is
really heavy-duty stuff here.

793
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,998
God, I thought I had problems,
but I mean, I do...

794
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,355
At least with Bill,
what you see is what you get.

795
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,193
But that gutless wonder back there -

796
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,192
he makes Bill look like
the catch of all time.

797
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,231
Don't wear my boots again, OK?

798
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,396
They're nice boots, Kat.
I'd like to keep it that way.

799
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,071
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't use
my comb, either. It's full of scuzz.

800
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,555
Kat, are you alive?

801
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,308
What's the matter?

802
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,675
What happened?

803
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,593
- She came back tonight.
- Shit.

804
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,557
He just stood there.
He didn't even say a word to me.

805
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,871
It's all right.

806
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,117
It's gonna be tough,
but you're gonna be all right.

807
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,951
I just feel so stupid.

808
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,914
Why does it hurt so much?

809
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,392
- Let me get you a cup of tea.
- No, please. Please, just stay with me.

810
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,551
Kat! Order up.

811
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,596
Oh, 'scuse me. Sorry.

812
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,314
- Excuse me. This isn't cooked.
- Sorry.

813
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:47,639
- Hi. Ready to order?
- Yes, I believe I am.

814
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,719
The... Mystic Pizza.
I assume that's the house special.

815
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,392
Yes, sir. That's the special.
There's nothing like it.

816
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:03,871
And bring me
a fresh glass of water, please.

817
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,598
- Sure. Do you want some ice in it?
- No. No ice.

818
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,913
Leona, I need the best Mystic Pizza
you've ever made.

819
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,878
- Why?
- The Fireside Gourmet. He's here.

820
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,712
Look.

821
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,431
- So what?
- Leona!

822
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,874
- Take your pick.
- This.

823
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,195
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

824
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,359
Anything else, sir? A side of clams?
We have a wonderful small house salad.

825
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,193
No, thank you. Just the check, please.

826
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,874
The check? You're through?

827
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,951
Yes.

828
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,278
Here you go. I'll get a box
so you can take the rest home.

829
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,874
No, thank you.

830
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,951
Excuse me.

831
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,555
Somebody ought to ram
fried goat cheese up his ass.

832
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,597
Lobster for breakfast,
lobster for lunch...

833
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,231
Fuckin' lotta lobsters here.

834
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,677
Ma? I'm not gonna be able to
take you to the potluck tomorrow.

835
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,230
Charlie invited me to dinner
to meet his family.

836
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,279
- What do you think about that?
- Guess I could get a ride with Louisa.

837
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,148
- I mean about Charlie.
- He's not a Catholic.

838
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,674
Or a Portuguese, or poor.
He's not a lot of things.

839
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,116
- He's not gonna marry you, either.
- Are you kidding?

840
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,272
Marriage? I'm talking about
dinner with his parents.

841
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,477
Sure. What do I know, anyway?

842
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,790
You think I always looked like this?

843
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,839
When I was your age, you think
they weren't sniffin' around after me?

844
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,354
Different clothes, same line.

845
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,000
- Only I had sense.
- Thank you very much.

846
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,596
Well, I didn't go jump in the back seat
of every sports car that came along.

847
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,910
- You're really good at this, Ma.
- At what?

848
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,072
Making me feel like shit.

849
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,435
I cursed.
Another mark against Daisy, right?

850
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,750
I curse, I'm stupid, I'm a slut.

851
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,957
All I want is for you
to make something of yourself!

852
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:22,990
Yeah? Well, I'm not gonna go to Yale.
You're just gonna have to deal with that.

853
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,189
I don't expect you to go to Yale.

854
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,834
I'm just so worried about you.

855
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,310
Yeah.

856
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,789
Me too.

857
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,511
Thank you.

858
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,277
Oh, it looks marvellous, Elaine.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Teresa.

859
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,396
Dig in, everybody.

860
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,469
Out of this world, Polly. It's so tender.

861
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,760
Mom, do you want my green stuff?

862
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,952
That's called the tomalley, Steamer.
It's the best part.

863
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,998
It's the shit, Steam. Don't eat it.

864
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,874
- Do you want a beer?
- No, thanks.

865
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,679
Anybody else?

866
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,276
- Daisy.
- Teresa. You work here?

867
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,031
I help out Mrs Windsor once in a while.

868
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,512
- You still waitressin' at the Pizza?
- Teresa?

869
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,034
- Yes, sir?
- How's your lobster?

870
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,588
It's really delicious.

871
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,559
Charlie didn't tell us that
you were in the pizza business, Daisy.

872
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:01,076
Mrs Windsor and I consider ourselves
pizza connoisseurs.

873
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,671
- Really?
- I worked in a pizza place one summer.

874
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,751
Up at the Cape. Remember, Mom?

875
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,308
There's nothing wrong
with being a waitress.

876
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:14,358
A noble profession, right?

877
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,950
Certainly a profession, at any rate.

878
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,631
- As opposed to what I do.
- Just what is it you do?

879
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,870
- Chuck...
- It's all right, Polly.

880
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,674
I so rarely get to meet a man of leisure.

881
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,876
Much less a close relative.

882
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,951
Well, I owe it all to you, Dad.

883
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,874
You gave me all the advantages
that you never had.

884
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,310
When Dad was my age,
he was a steampipe fitter.

885
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,278
- Show her the calluses.
- Cut it out, Charlie.

886
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,434
Who would like more
sour cream on their potato?

887
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,476
Oh, I do, please.

888
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,596
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right, Teresa.

889
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,797
These Portuguese girls
are very hard to train.

890
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,838
I had one once who barely spoke...

891
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,313
- English?
- I didn't mean your friend.

892
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,630
- So what did you mean?
- Charles.

893
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,790
I'm just clearin' the air, Dad.

894
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,518
Aunt Tweedy...

895
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,956
You can't even train
your own husband to sleep at home.

896
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,316
And Dad's big frustration in life
is that he can't train me.

897
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,391
- lsn't that right, Dad?
- Charlie!

898
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:31,029
- Everyone knows I can't cut the mustard.
- You listen to me...

899
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,315
If you can't train a golden boy like me,

900
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,437
there's no way you're gonna train
a dumb Portuguese.

901
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:39,910
- I said that's enough!
- OK. So I guess dinner is over.

902
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,114
- Dammit, Charlie.
- Daisy?

903
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,357
Charles? Charles, you come back here!

904
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:56,035
Dais? Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But they deserved it.

905
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:00,238
- I couldn't let 'em do that to you.
- Me? You did that for yourself.

906
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,914
They were bein' real jerks!

907
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,596
The only jerk at that table was you.
They were just being themselves.

908
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:12,470
Bring home your poor Portuguese girlfriend
for dinner, shake up the family a little.

909
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,189
- That's not true.
- I'm poor, and I hate it. I admit it.

910
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:22,271
I even thought I was desperate,
but I'm not half as desperate as you are.

911
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,352
I would never use you
to get at somebody.

912
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:31,639
Your father didn't cheat his way out of
law school. You did that all on your own.

913
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,711
Deal with it, Junior.

914
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,274
You're not even good enough for me.

915
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,479
Teresa? Can you give me a ride?

916
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,954
I wanna go home.

917
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,591
Kat...

918
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,111
Oh, my God.

919
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,355
Hi.

920
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,397
Hi, Phoebe.

921
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,194
Phoebe wanted to say goodbye.

922
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:31,316
- Goodbye, Phoebe.
- Bye.

923
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,630
- Keep going to the library, OK?
- OK.

924
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,151
Take care.

925
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,271
This is for you.

926
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,351
It's for Yale.

927
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,395
All those stars and comets
don't come cheap.

928
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,471
Thank you.

929
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,949
Goodbye, Tim.

930
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:08,592
Yeah. Well, I guess... we better go.

931
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,989
Bye, Kat.

932
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,831
Kat?

933
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,275
Are you out of your mind?

934
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,794
If you initial this, you can still cash it.

935
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,791
She doesn't need the money that bad.

936
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,553
Oh, yeah? How is she gonna pay for Yale?

937
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,231
She'll find a way.

938
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,673
What now?

939
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,399
..a hole in the wall
called the Mystic Pizza.

940
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,278
- Moron.
- The atmosphere was rustic,

941
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,635
the service was oversolicitous.

942
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,872
- Is that good?
- Now, I am not a pizza person.

943
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,236
I am not particularly
fond of cheesy cuisine,

944
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,231
and this pizza is...

945
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,153
How shall I say this? In a word...

946
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,072
superb.

947
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,395
I ordered the house speciality,
the Mystic Pizza. Mystic indeed.

948
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:00,758
Exactly the right blend
of cheese and tomatoes and spices

949
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,956
that I can't quite identify.

950
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:06,153
You bet your ass you can't.

951
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,710
That's the Mystic Pizza,
in Mystic, Connecticut.

952
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,360
I have to give them my highest rating.

953
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,715
Four stars.

954
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,030
And you thought the man was a moron.

955
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,196
Hello, Mystic Pizza.

956
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,911
I beg your pardon?

957
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,119
No, no. No reservations are necessary.

958
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,596
Reservations!

959
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,671
Yes. Yes, Main Street.

960
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:39,035
This is Hector Pleshette wishing you...

961
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,829
Bill, this is important.

962
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:53,994
I don't want you to get the wrong idea,
but I gotta maintain my own identity.

963
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,514
Maintain your own identity.

964
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,478
Right. I mean,
I understand about commitment,

965
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,710
and I love you more than anything.

966
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,360
But you gotta know exactly where I stand,

967
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,193
because absolutely nothing has changed.

968
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,431
Except your name.

969
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,231
Except my name.

970
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,909
Who you wanna dance with, me or Kat?

971
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,991
Not you.

972
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,752
It's for Yale.

973
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,831
You'll pay me back.

974
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,233
- No, l...
- No, Vic and I talked about this.

975
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,516
We don't have any kids of our own.

976
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,595
Daisy, Jojo... you.

977
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,110
You're my kids. So...

978
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,834
Thanks, Leona.

979
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,911
Hey! You're messin' up my dress.

980
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:30,833
Karen, you wanna take this out?

981
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,191
It's a great party.

982
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,631
What do you want, Charlie?

983
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,391
Listen.

984
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,992
What you said about me and my father...

985
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,080
You were right.

986
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,913
- So?
- I owe you an apology.

987
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,351
OK.

988
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,871
So...

989
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:23,035
So?

990
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,838
So you like chocolate ice cream?

991
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,159
It's my favourite.

992
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,356
Well, this must be your lucky night.

993
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,271
Keep it up.

994
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,071
Thought I'd find you out here.

995
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,190
I see you had some company in there.

996
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,631
Who knows?

997
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:37,029
God, next Thursday's Thanksgiving.

998
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,471
Soon I'll be at college.

999
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,152
- Do me a favour?
- What's that?

1000
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:48,996
Next time you take on a Yalie,
pick one your own age?

1001
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,914
- Who knows?
- Hey, you guys.

1002
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,232
You're not gonna believe what Bill's mom
just said to me. You're gonna die.

1003
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:01,269
She came up to me and she said "So,
when am I gonna hear some good news?"

1004
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:05,831
I mean, I've been married two hours
and she wants me knocked up already!

1005
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,317
I really love you guys.

1006
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,798
- You know what I wonder?
- What?

1007
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,389
What the hell do you think
Leona really puts in that pizza?

1008
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,990
