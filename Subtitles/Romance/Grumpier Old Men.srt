191

192
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:16,664
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING NOW, JOHNNY.

193
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:20,134
LAST THURSDAY,
I TURNED 95 YEARS OLD.

194
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:21,536
YEAH.

195
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:25,606
AND I NEVER EXERCISED
A DAY OF MY LIFE.

196
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,908
EVERY MORNING,
I WAKE UP,

197
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:29,977
AND I SMOKE
A CIGARETTE,

198
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:34,046
AND THEN I EAT
5 STRIPS OF BACON.

199
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,884
AND FOR LUNCH, I EAT
A BACON SANDWICH,

200
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,285
AND FOR
A MIDDAY SNACK...

201
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,720
BACON?

202
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,255
BACON! A WHOLE
DAMN PLATE,

203
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,258
AND I USUALLY
DRINK MY DINNER.

204
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,795
NOW, ACCORDING TO ALL OF
THEM FLAB-BELLY EXPERTS,

205
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:54,131
I SHOULD HAVE TOOK
A DIRT NAP,

206
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,733
LIKE, 30 YEARS AGO,

207
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,968

COMES AND GOES,

208

212
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:09,277

ABOUT ME.

213
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:12,447

214
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,916

YOU EAT BACON,

219
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,291
AND YOU SMOKE

220
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,794
AND YOU OUTLIVE
MOST OF THE EXPERTS.

221

YEAH?

222
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,764
I THOUGHT MAYBE
THERE'S A MORAL.

223
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:32,932
NO, THERE AIN'T
NO MORAL.

224

967
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,766

1003
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:21,083
YOU SAID I SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO HER.

1004
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:23,686
APOLOGIZE, YES--
NOT SLEEP WITH HER.

1005

1009
00:44:31,226 --> 00:44:33,226
