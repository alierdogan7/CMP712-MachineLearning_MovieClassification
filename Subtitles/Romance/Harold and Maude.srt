371
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,512
Uh. My boy. Excuse me.

372
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,277
One moment. Please.

373
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:30,616
Who was that old lady
waving to you earlier?

374
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:33,623
Hello. Harold.
can I give you a lift?

375
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,124
There you are. Madam.

376
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:38,593
Were you not the lady
who drove my car off yesterday?

377
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:41,631
With the St. Christopher medal
on the dashboard?

378
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:42,791
Yes.

379
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,891
It was me.
Get in. Harold.

380
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:48,131
Were you also the one
who painted the saint?

381
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:50,639
Oh. Yes. How did
you like that?

382
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,141
Well. I didn't.

383
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:53,642
Don't be
too discouraged.

384
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:57,203
For aesthetic appreciation.
always a little time.

385
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:08,290
What a delight. Harold.
to bump into you again.

386
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:11,293
I knew we were going
to be good friends.

387
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:13,852
You go to funerals
often. Don't you?

388
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:14,863
Uh. Yeah.

389
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:16,024
So do I.

390
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,965
They're such fun.
aren't they?

391
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:19,969
It's all change.

392
00:24:20,037 --> 00:24:22,733

393
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:25,070
the great circle of life.

394
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:30,646
Hey. This old thing
handles well.

395
00:24:30,714 --> 00:24:32,147
Ever drive
a hearse. Harold?

396
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:33,148
Yeah.

397
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:36,152
Well. It's a new
experience for me.

398
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:40,055
Good on curves.

399
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:42,558
Shall I take you
home. Harold?

400
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,992
Uh. This is my car.

401
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:46,529
Your hearse?

402
00:24:46,597 --> 00:24:47,529
Yearse.

403
00:24:47,598 --> 00:24:49,862
Ohhh!

404
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:56,668
Then you shall
take me home.

405
00:25:10,354 --> 00:25:13,289
So just before he left
for the monastery in Tibet.

406
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:15,450
big Sweeney
gave me his keys.

407
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:17,960
'Course I made additions
for the new models.

408
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:20,292
but not as many
as you might think.

409
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:22,298
Once you have
your basic set.

410
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:24,960
it's then only
a question of variation.

411
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:28,801
You hop in any car you want
and just drive off?

412
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:31,306
Not any car.
I like to keep a variety.

413
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,310
I'm always looking
for the new experience.

414
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:35,310
Maybe.

415
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:39,648
Nevertheless. I think
you're upsetting people.

416
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:42,048
I don't know
if that's right.

417
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,314
Well. If some people
get upset

418
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:47,152
because they feel they have
a hold on some things.

419
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:49,454
I'm acting as
a gentle reminder...

420
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:50,823
here today.
gone tomorrow.

421
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:53,328
so don't get
attached to things.

422
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:55,331
Now. With that
in mind.

423
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:58,061
I'm not against
collecting stuff.

424
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:01,935
I've collected quite
a lot of stuff in my time.

425
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,436
Yeah. This is all memorabilia.
but it's incidental.

426
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:10,446
not integral.
if you know what I mean.

427
00:26:10,514 --> 00:26:11,947
Oh... the birds.

428
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:12,947
Wow.

429
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:15,280
Oh. I love them so much.

430
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:19,118
They're the only wildlife
I get to see anymore.

431
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:21,987
Ah. Me. Free as a bird.

432
00:26:24,194 --> 00:26:28,824
At one time I broke into pet shops
to liberate the canaries.

433
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:32,335
but I decided that was an idea
way before its time.

434
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:36,429
Zoos are full.
prisons are overflowing...

435
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:43,435
Ah. My. How the world
still dearly loves a cage.

436
00:26:43,513 --> 00:26:45,447
Uh. Please sit down.
Harold.

437
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,312
I'll put the kettle on.

438
00:26:47,384 --> 00:26:49,818
We'll have a nice
hot cup of tea.

439
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:51,650
Thanks. But
I have to go.

440
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:53,485
But it's oat straw tea.

441
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:55,650
You've never had
oat straw tea. Have you?

442
00:26:55,726 --> 00:26:56,658
No.

443
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:57,819
Well. Then.

444
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:00,625
But I have to go.
I have an appointment.

445
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:02,631
I really can't miss it.

446
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:04,929
Oh. At the dentist?

447
00:27:06,336 --> 00:27:07,598
Kind of.

448
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:12,364
Well. Then you'll just
have to come back and visit.

449
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:13,409
All right.

450
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:15,604
My door's always open.

451
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,771
All right.

452
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:19,008
- Promise?
- I promise.

453
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:23,842
Harold.

454
00:27:26,023 --> 00:27:27,012
Harold?

455
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:31,961
I asked. Do you
have any friends?

456
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:32,961
No.

457
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,294
None at all?

458
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:37,128
No.

459
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,360
Maybe one.

460
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:41,302
Would you care to talk
about this friend?

461
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:42,963
No.

462
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,804
I find you a very
interesting case. Harold.

463
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:47,969
but this reluctance
on your part

464
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:50,013
is detrimental to
the psychoanalytical process.

465
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,139
Do you understand?

466
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:56,818
Very well.

467
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:58,821
Your mother tells me.
Harold.

468
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:01,756
that she's arranging
several dates for you

469
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:03,816
with some young ladies.

470
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:06,590
How do you
feel about that?

471
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:08,722
[Snoring]

472
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:13,769
Hello. I'm Candy Gulf.

473
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:16,772
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Chasen. Do come in.

474
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,603
Harold is
out in the garden.

475
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:20,768
He'll be here
in a moment.

476
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:22,778
Shall we sit down?

477
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:24,939
Oh. There's Harold.

478
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:25,947
Hello.

479
00:28:30,454 --> 00:28:31,785
[Giggling]

480
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:33,789
Oh. He seems very nice.

481
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:35,290
Oh. Thank you.

482
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:39,689
- You are at the university?
- Yes. I am.

483
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:41,560
And what
are you studying?

484
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:43,531
Poli sci. Minoring
in Home Ec.

485
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,728
- Poli Sci?
- Political Science.

486
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:49,067
- Oh.
- It's all about what's going on.

487
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:52,074
Is Harold interested
in what's going on?

488
00:28:52,142 --> 00:28:55,305
I just think it's such
a super thing to study.

489
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:58,815
Of course. I can always
fall back on my Home Ec.

490
00:28:58,882 --> 00:29:00,247
Now that's good planning.

491
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:01,511
Yes.

492
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:04,748
Tell me. Are you a regular
with this computer club?

493
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:07,619
Oh. Heavens. No! I don't have
to worry about dates.

494
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:09,124
Oh.

495
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:12,753
But some of the other girls
in my sorority

496
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:14,763
decided somebody
ought to try it.

497
00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:17,732
so we drew straws.
and I lost.

498
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:21,202
Oh... but l... I'm looking
forward to meeting Harold.

499
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:23,762
Well. I think
I should mention. Candy.

500
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,502
Harold does have his
little eccentric moments.

501
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:28,009
That's all right.

502
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:31,514
I have a brother
who's a real cutup. Too.

503
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:34,243
Oh. I will never
forget the time

504
00:29:34,317 --> 00:29:37,480
we had this old television set
with no parts in it.

505
00:29:37,554 --> 00:29:39,988
Tommy stuck his head
behind it

506
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:42,491
and started giving
a whole newscast

507
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,254
before the entire family.

508
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:46,261
Must have been
very funny.

509
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:48,160
[Explosion]

510
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:50,222
Aah! Harold!

511
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,232
Oh!

512
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:54,236
Oh. Yes. Dear.
Here is Harold now.

513
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,737
Harold.
this is Candy.

514
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:59,640
Candy's just been telling
such a funny little story about...

515
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:00,641
Oh!

516
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,972
Walter
Cronkite.

517
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:03,012
Oh!

518
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:08,662
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

519
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:17,268
# I used to walk alone #

520
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:19,577
# Every step
seemed the same #

521
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,144
# This world
was not my home #

522
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:28,156
# So there was nothing
much to the game #

523
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,554
# Look up and
see the clouds #

524
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,964
# Look down and
see the cold fog #

525
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,999
# Until you came
into my life. Girl #

526
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:45,063
# I saw nothing.
nothing more ##

527
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:51,545
Oh.

528
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:54,674
- Excuse me.
- Mmm?

529
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,809
I beg your pardon.

530
00:30:57,887 --> 00:30:59,514
Well. What do you want?

531
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:02,456
I'm sorry.
I was looking for Maude.

532
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:03,457
Harold?

533
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:10,890
Maude.

534
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:15,536
How about
some ginger pie?

535
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:17,038
Fine. Thank you.

536
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:18,630
I'll heat some up.

537
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,879
My. Harold. I'm glad
to see you again.

538
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:27,245
Do you often
model for Glaucus?

539
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:30,217
Oh. Heavens. No.

to live it fully.

903
00:54:56,623 --> 00:54:58,147
I haven't lived.

904
00:55:01,962 --> 00:55:04,226
I've died a few times.

905
00:55:04,298 --> 00:55:05,788
What was that?

906
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:08,559
Well...

907
00:55:08,635 --> 00:55:10,865
uh...

908
00:55:10,937 --> 00:55:15,567
the first time was when
I was at boarding school.

909
00:55:15,642 --> 00:55:17,041
in the chemistry lab.

910
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,044
I was in there
cleaning it up.

911
00:55:19,112 --> 00:55:23,048
so I decided I'd do
a little experimenting.

912
00:55:23,116 --> 00:55:24,140
you know.

913
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:27,812
So I get all this stuff out
and begin mixing it up.

914
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:28,912
Very scientific.

915
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:34,219
There was this
massive explosion.

916
00:55:34,294 --> 00:55:35,727
It knocked me down.

917
00:55:35,796 --> 00:55:38,390
blew out a huge hole
in the floor.

918
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:40,763
There was boards
and bricks

919
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:42,597
and flames
leaping up.

920
00:55:42,669 --> 00:55:47,265
I figured. You know.
time to leave.

921
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:50,310
My career in school
was over.

922
00:55:50,377 --> 00:55:52,743
So. Uh...

923
00:55:52,813 --> 00:55:54,440
I went home.

924
00:55:54,514 --> 00:55:56,607
My mother
was giving a party.

925
00:55:56,683 --> 00:56:00,278
so I went up the back stairs
into my room.

926
00:56:00,354 --> 00:56:01,651
turned out the light.

927
00:56:01,722 --> 00:56:05,317
and. Uh. I got
this funny feeling.

928
00:56:05,392 --> 00:56:07,383
The doorbell rang.

929
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:09,520
I went out
into the banister.

930
00:56:09,596 --> 00:56:11,860
and these two
policemen came in.

931
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:14,765
found my mother.

932
00:56:14,835 --> 00:56:18,271
and. Uh... told her

933
00:56:18,338 --> 00:56:23,002
that I was killed
in the fire.

934
00:56:23,076 --> 00:56:26,068
She put one hand
up to her forehead.

935
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:28,580
With the other one.
she reached out.

936
00:56:28,648 --> 00:56:30,343
as if groping
for support.

937
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:33,909
and with
this long sigh.

938
00:56:33,987 --> 00:56:37,582
she collapsed
in their arms.

939
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:56,475
[Crying]

940
00:57:06,153 --> 00:57:08,587
I decided right then

941
00:57:08,655 --> 00:57:12,489
that I'd enjoy
being dead.

942
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,493
I understand.

943
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:17,155
A lot of people
enjoy being dead.

944
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,664
but they're not dead.
really.

945
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:24,102
They're just
backing away from life.

946
00:57:24,171 --> 00:57:27,265
Reach out.
Take a chance.

947
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,308
Get hurt. Even.

948
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:32,903
But play
as well as you can.

949
00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:35,607
Go. Team. Go!

950
00:57:35,682 --> 00:57:37,343
Gimme an "L."
Gimme an "I."

951
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:39,180
Gimme a "V."
Gimme an "E."

952
00:57:39,252 --> 00:57:42,187
L-l-V-E. Live!

953
00:57:43,657 --> 00:57:47,593
Otherwise you got nothing
to talk about in the locker room.

954
00:57:57,904 --> 00:57:59,337
I like you. Maude.

955
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:00,873
Hmm.

956
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:04,900
I like you. Harold.

00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:41,307
Harold is down
at the garage.

959
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:43,645
He's been tuning up
his new car.

960
00:58:43,717 --> 00:58:44,979
He's very mechanical.

961
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:46,985
What kind of car
is it?

962
00:58:47,053 --> 00:58:48,850
It's a little Jaguar.

963
00:58:48,922 --> 00:58:49,854
Oh.

964
00:58:51,992 --> 00:58:53,584
Looks like a hearse.

965
00:58:54,794 --> 00:58:57,126
Very nice.
You know... compact.

to meet my son Harold.

969
00:59:04,404 --> 00:59:06,395
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

970
00:59:06,473 --> 00:59:08,907
I think you should
wash up. Dear.

971
00:59:08,975 --> 00:59:11,876
and join us
in the drawing room.

972
00:59:11,945 --> 00:59:14,379
And what do you do.
my dear?

973

exactly that you do?

I'm in charge of all the invoices
for the southwest.

977
00:59:23,957 --> 00:59:24,889
How interesting.

980
00:59:28,962 --> 00:59:30,224

981
00:59:30,297 --> 00:59:31,628
Yes.

982
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:35,860

Well. Not exactly
the whole southwest.

a large business.

In view of your
recent actions.

999
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:39,356
I find you have left me
with no recourse

1000
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:42,333
but to listen to the solution
proposed by your uncle.

1001
01:00:42,402 --> 01:00:45,496
Consequently. I have
instructed him forthwith

1002
01:00:45,572 --> 01:00:47,665
to induct you
into the service.

1003
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:49,504
and. For your own good.

1004
01:00:49,576 --> 01:00:54,104
to take up active duty
with the United States Army.

more luck with you than I.

going to draft me.

1007
01:01:03,857 --> 01:01:05,757
Well. Don't go.

1008
01:01:05,825 --> 01:01:07,759
They'll put me in jail.

1009
01:01:07,827 --> 01:01:10,853
Well. Historically.
you'd be in very good company.

1010
01:01:16,403 --> 01:01:18,030
Maude. Can you help me?

1011
01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:21,840
With your skill
and my experience.

1012
01:01:21,908 --> 01:01:24,433
I think we can
come up with something.

1013
01:01:25,612 --> 01:01:28,513
Harold. Iook at me
like your father in this.

1014
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:31,482
I know you have no desire
to join the army.

1015
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:33,985
but once you're in.
you'll love it.

1019

Oh. It has its drawbacks
like anything else. I suppose.

1020
01:01:44,431 --> 01:01:46,695
But the army
takes care of you.

1021
01:01:46,766 --> 01:01:49,997
and you've got
a buddy for life.

Good idea.
coming out here. Harold.

1024

It's a lovely spot.

1025
01:01:55,608 --> 01:01:56,870
Thank you. Uncle.

1026
01:01:56,943 --> 01:01:58,205
Call me sir. Harold.

1027
01:01:58,278 --> 01:02:01,042
It's the first thing
you learn in the army...

1028
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:02,877
an officer
deserves your respect.

1029
01:02:02,949 --> 01:02:04,824
Yes. Sir.

1030
01:02:05,858 --> 01:02:08,725
Now let's examine
the facts on it.

1031
01:02:08,795 --> 01:02:11,389
I say this country's
been too harsh

1032
01:02:11,464 --> 01:02:14,058
in its outright
condemnation of war.

1033
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:16,897
You can point to the many
material advantages

1034
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,905
brought about by a crisis
in conflict policy.

1035
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:24,069
Why. Hell. World War II
gave us the ballpoint pen.

1036
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:27,010
During wartime. The national
suicide rate goes down.

1037
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,342
Is that a fact?

1038
01:02:28,414 --> 01:02:31,850
Why in hell did we
give up on the Germans?

1039
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:33,852
Because the damn politicians
in Washington

1040
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,854
chalked them up
on our side.

1041
01:02:35,922 --> 01:02:39,187
The wars ever since have
been a national disgrace.

1042
01:02:39,258 --> 01:02:40,520
Hell. Iook at history.

1043
01:02:40,593 --> 01:02:43,027
The two best wars
this country ever fought

1044
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:44,358
were against the jerries.

1045
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:47,524
Get the krauts across
the fence where they belong.

1046
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,160
Let's get back to the kind
of enemy worth killing

1047
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:53,034
and the kind of war
this country can support.

1048
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:56,542
Wow. That's pretty
strong stuff. Sir.

1049
01:02:56,609 --> 01:03:00,545
Well. I've always been a man
that speaks his piece.

1050
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:02,046
Always hurt me.

1051
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:06,176
I'm not liked in Washington.
I know that.

in high places.

1056

Tat-tat-tat-tat!

1057
01:03:19,365 --> 01:03:22,300
Only one thing kept
going through my mind...

1058
01:03:22,368 --> 01:03:24,393
Kill! Kill!

1059
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,906
For Joe and Mac
and the rest of the guys!

1060
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:29,066
Kill!

1061
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:31,702
And then there was
a blinding flash!

1062
01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:38,077
And I woke up
on a stretcher.

1063
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:44,590
"Did we hold?"
I asked the medic.

1064
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:47,215
"Yes. Sir!" he said.

1065
01:03:51,431 --> 01:03:55,697
And I slipped
into unconsciousness.

1066
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:58,236
Boy.

1067
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:01,705
Wow. That's
a terrific story. Sir.

1068
01:04:02,942 --> 01:04:04,910
Well...

1069
01:04:04,977 --> 01:04:07,844
you'll have stories like that
to tell of your own someday.

1070
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:09,347
Do you think so. Sir?

1071
01:04:09,415 --> 01:04:10,643
Sure. You will.

1072
01:04:10,716 --> 01:04:14,152
Gee. I never dreamed
it could be that exciting.

1073
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,984
It's the most exciting thing
in the world. Harold.

1074
01:04:17,056 --> 01:04:20,548
To pit your own life
against another.

1075
01:04:20,626 --> 01:04:21,615
Yes.

1076
01:04:21,694 --> 01:04:23,491
To kill.

in your mouth.

It wasn't very scary.
