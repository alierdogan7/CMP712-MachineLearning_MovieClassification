So, Wallace, I'd like to get
your opinion on something.

338
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,410
- Uh, yeah?
- Europe.

339
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,037

- It is.

343
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,752
He is from that continent,
he should know.

344
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,420
Okay, look at a map, any map,

345
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,964
Europe's not a separate continent,
it's clearly part of Asia.

346
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:32,053
Right. But, wait, so if Europe isn't
a continent, then why is it a continent?

347
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,972
Because Europeans were the ones
who decided what the continents are,

348
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:39,101
and they didn't want to get lumped
in with all the, you know, Asians.

ends your friendship.

Even if she goes for it, she'll
resent you for getting her to cheat.

She'll break up with him, but she won't
go out with you because you're...

- Sleazy.
- Yeah.

Option two, be the guy
she goes to for advice.

The downside is you have to
listen to her talk about Ben.

The upside is you can slant your

to them and they break up,

of not being unethical,

- Yeah.

Did I miss a memo?
Because if I recall,

892

your feelings forever.

baby has massive hands.

1661
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:56,189
[BABY FARTING]

1662
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:59,860
- Oh. What's going on here? Hoo-hoo.
- Oh, Jesus.

1663
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:04,948
Oh, it smells bad. Wait, can you write
us a prescription or not? Oh, God.

1664
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,408
There goes my husband.

1665
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:08,368
I can't believe you have a husband.

1666
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:11,417
- It's crazy.
- You're weirding me out.

1667
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:13,749
- WALLACE: Hey. Oh.
- CHANTRY: So...

1668
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,292
WALLACE: Careful. Give me your hand.

1669
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:20,797
- You're up here alone, like a total loser.
- Yeah, but who's the bigger loser?

1670
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:23,341
Me for escaping up here,
or you for agreeing to marry me?

1671
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:25,809
- No, that's me.
- Heh-heh.

1672
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:30,807
If I fell, do you think I'd die,
or just become massively paralyzed?

1673
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,100
Probably just paralyzed.

1674
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,645
CHANTRY: You'd be so screwed.
You'd have to stay married to me.

1675
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:37,355
If you didn't, people would be like,

1676
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:41,651
"He divorced his wife after she became
paralyzed from the waist down."

1677
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,236
- From the waist down?
- Yeah.

1678
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,614
So everything would still work
down there, though, right?

1679
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:48,200
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't be
able to feel anything, but...

1680
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,452
I really don't even need
you to feel anything now.

1681
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:51,912
I don't want the sex to be too good

1682
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,121
- right away.
- Mm-hm.

1683
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,665
I'm intentionally being much
worse in bed than I actually am

1684
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,751
so that it can just keep
getting better forever.

1685
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:00,629
But, like, very slowly,
over many, many decades

1686
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,547
so that we hit our
sexual peak in our 90s.

1687
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,591
Yeah. That's the plan, actually,

1688
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:10,847
is if the last time we have sex is also
the best and that it actually kills you.

1689
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:13,145
That wouldn't be such
a bad way to go.

1690
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,362
- We should head back soon, right?
- Yes.

1691
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:22,609
Or we could stay here
for another minute.

1692
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:26,616
Or maybe like forever.
