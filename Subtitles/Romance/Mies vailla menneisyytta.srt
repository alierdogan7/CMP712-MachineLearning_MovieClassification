THE MAN WITHOUT A PAST

4
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,674
Written, directed and produced b y
AKI KAURISMÄKI

5
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,117
Bingo!

6
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,114
Lajunen, from the gents.

7
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,468
We have a dead man here.

8
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,439
His pulse is fading.
We're losing him.

9
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,356
Perhaps it's better this way
than a life as a vegetable.

10
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,236
5.12 a.m.

11
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,110
What is the deceased's name?
- We don't know.

12
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,952
Notify the morgue.
I'm needed at the maternity ward.

13
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,437
Is he dead?

14
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,276
No, he's moving.

15
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,434
See you outside?
- In a minute.

16
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,956
What should we do?
Take him to the hospital?

17
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,515
I don't know.

18
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,799
He's run away from
the prison mental hospital.

19
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,635
We'll ask him when he's better.

20
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,592
Until then, we'll let him rest.
- You're the boss.

21
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,357
Yes.

22
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,716
Get some eggs and milk.

23
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,470
Don't stay out all evening.

24
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,870
Thank you.

25
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,232
So he can talk. - Sure.

26
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,555
I just haven't had
anything to say be fore.

27
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,790
You're kind.
- I don't know about that.

28
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,471
We've been luck y... this place
and a job for Nieminen.

29
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,278
What does he do? -He's a night-
watchman at the coal yard.

30
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,869
Just a couple of nights
a week, but still.

31
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,919
We can soon apply for
a council flat.

32
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,239
They'll be taking in new
applications in a year or two.

33
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,159
That is fine. - What are you?

34
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,237
I don't know. - You don't know?

35
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,990
My head's damaged somehow.
I don't even remember who I am.

36
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,510
My, that's bad.

37
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,950
Care for a cup of coffee?

38
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,196
No thank s.

39
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,191
It's Friday.
Let's go out for dinner.

40
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,196
Oh what joy!
I have found a friend

41
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,878
My s ins are w as he d aw ay

42
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,996
I'm always blessed by my friend

43
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,797
He brings sweet peace
To my soul

44
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,671
He comforts me
When the road is rough

45
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,790
My Saviour walks close to me

46
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,671
I'm free d from misery and sorrow

47
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,516
As long as Jesus I follow

48
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,273
He's a faithful friend

49
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,192
Will you have a beer
if I buy you one?

50
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,313
I'll take offence and turn mean
if you refuse.

51
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,798
Or are you an anti-alcoholic?

52
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,551
Don't think so. As far as I know.

53
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,639
I got paid today.
Not much but enough -

54
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,160
for us to have two beers
without Kaisa noticing.

55
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,870
Perhaps.

56
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,436
Two beers.

57
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,750
I'm paying.

58
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,597
A seagull.

59
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,358
An ashtray.

60
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,512
A stub.

61
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,276
A Taunus.

62
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,796
Eight times eight?

63
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,476
Sixty-one.
- Seventy-two.

64
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,318
A woman.
- You make jokes, that's good.

65
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,912
Never give up, even if
you've lost your memory.

66
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,195
Life goes on, not back wards.
You'd be in trouble if it did.

67
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,516
Ho w much do you remember?

68
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,394
I was on a train.

69
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,995
It was dark outside.
- And be fore that?

70
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,156
It's all b lack. - Your childhood?

71
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,429
Not a sound, just a gloomy night.
- Your name? Your age?

72
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,833
Forget it.
I was on a train, that's all.

73
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,432
What about Helsinki?
Are you from here?

74
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,590
Don't think so.
The city seems strange to me.

75
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,631
Another round?
Maybe there's a blood clot -

76
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,070
in the part of your head
where the memory is.

77
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,753
Alcohol will dissolve it.
- You have one. Bring me water.

78
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,597
I used to do a lot of drinking when
I was younger, be fore my marriage.

79
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,879
I could drink for two day s in a row.

80
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,074
But you're young only once.

81
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,914
Workman's hands.
You've done something.

82
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,433
Something simple, you don't
look like a reading man.

83
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,912
Thank s. - You're welcome.

84
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,593
I'll get that beer.

85
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,795
Hey, mate!

86
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,757
Missed.

87
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,034
Just a thought.
I saw a film as a child -

88
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,072
where a man got his memory back -

89
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,237
when struck again in the same spot.

90
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,511
I see. - Yes.

91
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,597
Thank s for the beer.
I'll tak e a walk no w.

92
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,833
You're welcome. It gave me
the excuse to drink eight.

93
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,998
I may get a whipping
at home, though.

94
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,033
Stand up for yourself. See you.

95
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,594
She won't hit in front of the kids.

96
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,753
Ciao.

97
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,108
This is the man.
This here's Anttila.

98
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,358
The Whip of God. To my friends.
What sort of a man are you?

99
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,950
He doesn't know.
Found on the beach -

100
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,516
some sort of driftwood.
- Let the man speak for himself.

101
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,078
This is a private beach
but if you have a cigarette -

102
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,517
I can let it go. For once.

103
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,917
All I have is roll-ups.
- Then it means prison.

104
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,597
Your interests may be mutual.
He needs a place to stay.

105
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,388
That'd make a difference.
If you lived here -

106
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,349
I naturally wouldn't arrest you.
- Got one?

107
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,149
What? -A place to rent?

108
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,793
Does a bird have wings,
does a wolf cry out his loneliness?

109
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,436
Erik son's container's empty.
- Where is he?

110
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,228
Froze to death last winter.

111
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,193
All this is unofficial, of course.

112
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,356
If the authorities ask anything -

113
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,639
I shall deny you thrice like Peter
denied Christ at the coal fire.

114
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,754
As it happens I don't
even know who I am.

115
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,390
Then we must do an oral
agreement. A hundred.

116
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,154
A month? -A week.

117
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,314
Paid in advance each Monday.

118
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,837
It's not cheap.
- I must make a living, too.

119
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,038
Many people would pay triple
for a sea vie w.

120
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,358
And you don't look like
you'd last the winter.

121
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,990
You seem to be quite plump yourself.

122
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,677
Keep my metabolism out of this.

123
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,388
What about the electricity?
- Included in the rent.

124
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,598
There's the power company pylon.
I can lend you a screwdriver.

125
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,354
When can I move in?
- As soon as I turn my back.

126
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,036
And the keys?
- You see a lock any where?

127
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,638
No. - Don't go splitting hairs
then or I'll take the door, too.

128
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,118
A month's rent, in advance.
- Tomorrow, God willing.

129
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,878
He moves in mysterious ways.
If you don't pay up -

130
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,829
I'll send my killer dog
to bite your nose off.

131
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,635
It only causes trouble any way,
shadows the way wherever I go.

132
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,038
It's no more smoking
in the shower for you. Bye.

133
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,318
May I take this? -Go ahead.

134
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,555
Thanks.

135
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,509
What do I owe you?
- If you see me -

136
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,872
face down in the gutter,
turn me onto my back.

137
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,355
Kaisa promised you a mattress.
We've an extra one.

138
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,876
A jukebox.

139
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,154
Won't work.

140
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,471
These were left over.
It should work now.

141
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,829
The soup had too little salt in it.

142
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,549
Perhaps the rain watered it down.

143
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,314
There was cabbage
and potatoes, any way.

144
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,234
What more do you want?
Meat? -Never.

145
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,472
Good it was. What's your name?

146
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,797
Angling for another plateful?
No chance.

147
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,277
You look lousy, by the way.

148
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,434
I've had misfortunes but I'll
overcome them in a couple of days.

149
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,637
Visit us. You need new clothes.

150
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,678
Looking like that, no one'll take
you seriously. - So I've noticed.

151
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,718
And try to pull yourself together.

152
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,833
Bye now, I must hurry.

153
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,953
I was told to pull my self together.

154
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,794
Know how to do the washing?

155
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,149
Never bothered to learn,
Kaisa's always seen to it.

156
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,518
So far.

157
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,794
Nor do we have a washing machine
as I don't have any credit.

158
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,910
But the neighbour has one
'cause he's wealthy.

159
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,473
Come in!

160
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,713
I'd make some coffee
but I ain't got none.

161
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,958
Thanks, but I'm in a hurry.
How are you?

162
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,996
If the garbage collectors'
strike continues -

163
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,675
I must go on a diet or move away.

164
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,715
Where's this village's Employment
Agency? -See that church tower?

165
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,393
Follow its shadow and you're there.
- Excellent!

166
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,638
Isn't it? No w, if you'll allow me.

167
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,517
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

168
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,869
Surely you know how
to write your name? -Yes.

169
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,031
But these questions...
- I'll help you. It's not difficult.

170
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,198
Your surname, both given names -

171
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,235
date and place of birth,
social security number.

172
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,189
Can I help?

173
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,236
Wait here.

174
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,108
Are you making fun of us?
Surely you have a name?

175
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,434
Course I do. I was hit on the head,
several times in fact.

176
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,790
That's why I can't...
remember everything.

177
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,271
Why don't you ask your
mother or your friends?

178
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,070
Every one around here has
friends. - I've got one too.

179
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,270
But he doesn't know either.
- Did he hit his head too?

180
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,434
The Drama School's
round the corner -

181
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,151
they might have some use for you.
Don't waste our time again!

182
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,919
Some people want to work.
- What about social assistance?

183
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,716
They want a name, too.
Now get out of my sight.

184
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,310
Drugs you can find on the streets.

185
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,829
Do you charge for it?
- Not for the water.

186
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,440
Go ahead.

187
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,150
Leftovers from lunch.

188
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,757
You look hungry.
- I've got no money.

189
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,715
Doesn't matter.
It goes to waste otherwise.

190
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,429
Do you drink milk?

191
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,428
You came for the clothes.

192
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,314
I came because
you gave me the address.

193
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,713
But it's no use, I can't buy
anything. I'm an outcast.

194
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,037
That's no news to us.

195
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,834
You pay back when you're
back on your feet again.

196
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,119
All these are donations. You won't
get ahead looking like that.

197
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,556
God's mercy reigns in heaven -

198
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,718
but here on the Earth
one must help oneself.

199
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,991
The fitting-room's in the corner.

200
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,308
You'll go far yet.

201
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,834
You don't look like a drunk.

202
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,351
Like to tell me what
happened to you?

203
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,519
If you tell me your name.
I asked it once already -

204
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,791
and in my present situation
I'm afraid to talk to strangers.

205
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,675
It's Irma.

206
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,911
Wait in there.

207
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,988
There's a wretched man out there.

208
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,477
I think we should help him.

209
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,350
All right. Ask him in.

210
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,675
These need to be sorted
and carried inside.

211
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,674
Jokinen will help you to start.

212
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,597
Jokinen.

213
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,348
Looks cosy. Perhaps
I should raise the rent.

214
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,878
That's what I wanted to talk about.
I can't pay until Friday.

215
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,557
Attack!

216
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,195
You were luck y.
Usually people end up dead.

217
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,200
Start to pack.

218
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,679
The money will be there.
As certainly as death.

219
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,356
That's what gets you
if you fail to pay.

220
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,710
I've become so ft.

221
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,030
I'll drive my self
out of the business.

222
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,909
I'll be in Tallinn for a week.
The dog stay s here, watching you.

223
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,395
He only eats raw meat.
- I'll take care of him.

224
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,672
He takes care of himself.
Don't try to pet him -

225
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,793
or you've thrown your last dart.

226
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,514
Does he have a name?

227
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,396
Hannibal.

228
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,278
As our work is based on charity
we cannot pay you -

229
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,515
the kind of salary private
employers do. - I understand.

230
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,315
Sign here.

231
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,234
Will a cross do?

232
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,198
Do you live some where?
- I've got a home, in a dormitory.

233
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,274
May I escort you there?
The streets are not safe these days.

234
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,912
It's not far, I can manage.
- I'm sure you can.

235
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,676
I was thinking of myself.
I'm afraid of the dark.

236
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,357
It's not proper, with a stranger.
- But we are colleagues.

237
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,548
All right, let's go.

238
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,511
Is this where you live? -Yes.

239
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,390
Thank you for escorting me.

240
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,230
I wasn't afraid for a moment.
- That's fine.

241
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,311
Look out! -What?

242
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,673
There's something in your eye.

243
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,915
I can't feel anything.
- It's just going in there.

244
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,555
Let me have a look.

245
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,638
You stole a kiss. - Forgive me.

246
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,988
I'm not a gentleman.

247
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,999
Will we see each other tomorrow?

248
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,512
Without doubt, if you come to work.

249
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,950
Good night.

250
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,634
Satisfactory.

251
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,077
Hannibal. Here, boy.

252
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,075
He's a girl. - The man
who sold it said he's a male.

253
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,955
He'd better return the money.
No wonder he's no good.

254
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,831
Ho w was the trip to Estonia?
- I achieved my goals.

255
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,437
Can I borrow your car
for Saturday night?

256
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,394
I've never lent any one
anything in my life.

257
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,399
Twenty per hour, plus petrol.

258
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,436
Greed is a mortal sin.

259
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,309
I run a business.
The State protects business.

260
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,677
The State does not sin. Quo vadis.

261
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,510
Reservation fee's fifty.

262
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,276
Are you sure I can't help?
- I think it's ruined already.

263
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,672
Any way, it's ready.

264
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,558
Do you cook often?

265
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,795
Not very often.

266
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,271
The peas were fine.
- I went to the moon yesterday.

267
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,068
I see. Ho w was it? -Peaceful.

268
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,591
Meet any one?
- Not really, it was a Sunday.

269
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,039
Is that why you came back?
- Yes. And for other reasons, too.

270
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,389
Are you pretending -

271
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,035
or don't you really
remember anything?

272
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,828
I do remember something...

273
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,957
A factory hall -

274
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,352
by a long straight stretch
of a highway.

275
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,875
I did something.

276
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,112
A bright flame, it's hot...

277
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,598
It may be a dream.

278
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,515
I've started having them again.
- That's a good sign.

279
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,358
Perhaps.

280
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,991
The thought of a grave
with no name...

281
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,358
Shall we sit on the couch
and listen to some music?

282
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,314
The spring of God
Is never dry

283
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,752
You can drink and
slake your thirst

284
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,392
It's filled with
The Water of Life

285
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,628
Always cool,
clear and bright

286
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,112
My spring of Life
never seems to dry

287
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,877
It's never touched
by the droughts of Time

288
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,631
My soul, oh...

289
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,875
With all due respect, guys.

290
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,113
Haven't you ever thought of
expanding your repertoire -

291
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,312
into rhythm music? -Why?

292
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,676
This is what we always play.

293
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,509
I've got records at home.
bues, R&B, rock'n'roll.

294
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,872
Come and listen, if you want.

295
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,395
Why not-in our free time.

296
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,433
Around here the music
code is pretty strict.

297
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,108
I can have a word upstairs.

298
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,910
Regeneration would be fine.
We've heard about rock.

299
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,350
By widening your repertoire -

300
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,473
you may reach new target
groups who then -

301
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,470
with time may find
the movement interesting.

302
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,758
And I do believe -

303
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,555
that while the guy s' new sty le
is in part worldly -

304
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,993
it might be beneficial
to the movement.

305
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,758
So far, music hasn't killed any one.

306
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,756
We could give it a try.

307
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,749
I used to do some singing
my self when I was younger.

308
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,678
Let's go.

309
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,917
Because tomorrow is Midsummer -

310
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,595
although originally a pagan feast -

311
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,197
our choir will now make
an exception -

312
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,954
and perform a song
about the human heart.

313
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,238
In its lyrics, however,
we discover thoughts -

314
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,720
of the futility of our worldly
life without Christ.

315
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,389
So small is the heart of man

316
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,510
So vast, uncharted land

317
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,949
Within it you find
The grandest dreams

318
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,638
The worlds of hate and love

319
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,033
The wealth of all joy,
The sum of all sorrows

320
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,359
Glorious love and
Pain's poisonous arrows

321
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,475
All can be found
In the smallest of hearts

322
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,715
Happiness, joy, oh!

323
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,518
Shallow thoughts
And noble ideals

324
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,839
Burning emotions
And frozen feelings

325
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,949
All those can be found
In the smallest of hearts

326
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,115
All that fate brings by

327
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,834
I wonder if this was
a wise thing to do.

328
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,873
God knows, but let them dance.

329
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,196
Will you come out with me
on Saturday?

330
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,756
We are out now.

331
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,589
I've got a car, too.

332
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,479
I can't set up shady meetings
during working hours.

333
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,599
But it's all right.

334
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,037
So s mall is the he art of man

335
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,395
So vast, uncharted land

336
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,350
Within it you find
The grandest dreams...

337
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,114
Where do you want to go?
- Into the woods.

338
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,470
I have a basket for mushrooms.

339
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,716
Let's take Hannibal, too,
shall we? -Of course.

340
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,833
She'll protect us from the wolves.

341
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,156
Well?

342
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,035
Are these eatable?

343
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,511
Some are.

344
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,190
This one, though,
is lethally poisonous.

345
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,957
Indeed.

346
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,230
It was a good catch, wasn't it?

347
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,270
It'll make a meal.

348
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,276
Now what? -We'll go and
check the guys out.

349
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,995
I got them a gig.

350
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,195
I've been thinking about
becoming a rock'n'roll manager.

351
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,960
You're very energetic nowadays.

352
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,954
You've regained your joy of life.

353
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,353
I feel strong because
you inspire me.

354
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,150
It's all mercy.

355
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,793
I'm haunted by the devil,
Down the corner, every street

356
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,835
Wherever I may ramble,
He is always there to greet

357
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,113
He's staring at me calmly
In the bottom of my glass

358
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,712
He's smiling at me wicked
With the lips of an unknown lass

359
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,678
I'm haunted by the devil,
Every day and every night

360
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,959
Wherever I may ramble,
He is always by my side

361
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,239
Just when I think
I don't have to worry any more

362
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,473
If he's not behind me,
He's knocking on the door

363
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,989
Go d, please help me,
Keep me in the line

364
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,353
Through the straight and narrow
Would you always kindly sign

365
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,758
God, please help me,
would you be my guide

366
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,672
Please, don't let me be tempted,
keep me aw ay from the darker side

367
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,072
The shadow's always covering
the warm side of the sun

368
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,359
Waiting for the night to spoil
The dreams of every one

369
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,519
If I show a happy face
And even s mile to day

370
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,794
The luck is changing,
Game is different almost everyday

371
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,199
Tickets.

372
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,314
What do you mean?
- You haven't paid.

373
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,194
But I organised this.

374
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,837
That's what you think.
- Is that so?

375
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,872
Yes. - Fancy that.

376
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,553
That's outrageous!
- It is, isn't it?

377
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,510
May I give it a try, too?
- Go ahead.

378
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,517
We've got work for you.
Report in the office -

379
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,754
and start next Monday at seven.

380
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,155
I don't care if you say
your name's -

381
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,989
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
and say you were born -

382
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,590
in the deserts of Egypt
as long as I get -

383
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,229
what I need for the taxes
and pension payments.

384
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,433
That's all the state cares
about, and I even less.

385
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,430
Every other worker comes
from Kirghizia now -

386
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,475
and changes e very two week s.
But you need a bank account.

387
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,515
Can't you pay me in cash,
like in the old days?

388
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,031
And how do you suppose
the banks would survive?

389
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,472
No one could control the way
you spend your money.

390
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,839
You'd be like a pig in
a barley field, with no control.

391
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,631
But I have this name problem.

392
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,195
We'll find a name for you.

393
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,473
Don't be so helpless!
Open a numbered account -

394
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,150
in Switzerland and come back.

395
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,915
Good day. How are you?

396
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,834
Not too good. How can I help?

397
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,720
I want to open an account.

398
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,152
Fill this in.

399
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,150
You don't understand.
They ask my name.

400
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,830
I mean a numbered account -

401
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,156
like they have in Switzerland.

402
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,193
This one'll have a number too,
but you need a name any way.

403
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,193
Switzerland's more liberal,
but here in Finland...

404
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,273
Where's e very one?

405
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,273
This is a small bank,
there's no one else.

406
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,509
I'd like to take out 247,000
from this account.

407
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,950
The money is there -

408
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,750
but the account is frozen. - I know.

409
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,631
What's that?

410
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,673
A security camera, but...

411
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,830
It doesn't work.

412
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:19,309
Not any more, any way.
Start counting the money.

413
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,557
I haven't got that much here,
I must get it from the vault.

414
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,713
You come with us.

415
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,836
Be careful, I don't want too much.

416
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,919
Don't worry, I know my work.

417
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,276
There will be no extra money.

418
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,239
I'd have to pay it back my self.

419
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:52,308
I must close the door to give
me a head start. I'm sorry.

420
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,190
Perfectly understandable
in your position.

421
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,033
It's good you understand.

422
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,037
Now stay there.

423
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,315
It didn't work out then.

424
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,670
What? -Opening the account.

425
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,156
Wouldn't have made
any difference.

426
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,352
This is the last day
we're open. - Why?

427
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,030
The whole bank was
sold to North Korea.

428
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,079
What did the bank manager say?
- Nothing.

429
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,238
He decided on a personal solution -

430
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,916
being fired after 38 years' service.

431
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,708
One year be fore retirement age.

432
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,759
I see. - Yes.

433
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,353
We're running out of oxygen.

434
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,389
The air conditioning was cut off
for financial reasons.

435
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,872
Luckily the police will come
immediately after the alarm.

436
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,153
What alarm?

437
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,757
So we'll die here.

438
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,159
We can always just breathe out.

439
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,512
Do you mind if I smoke?

440
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,748
Does a tree mourn for a fallen leaf?

441
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,749
You're not making much sense.

442
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,514
It was nice meeting you.
- The pleasure was all mine.

443
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:02,957
This won't take long.
We just need some in formation.

444
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,718
Besides refusing to reveal
his identity -

445
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,835
the questioned had
no identity papers.

446
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,790
Under the circumstances,
the records of the hearing -

447
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,948
have not been signed by him,
despite repeated requests.

448
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,598
There fore we have decided
to arrest him until his identity -

449
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:32,068
and possible involvement
in the crime has been solved.

450
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,435
Got your memory back yet?
- Not yet.

451
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,598
We don't suspect you
of participation in the crime.

452
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,231
The bank clerk's story
was quite straightforward.

453
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,590
Then I can go, can't I?

454
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,950
The Vagrancy Act
has been revoked -

455
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,237
but we have rules and
regulations to keep you here.

456
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,473
You could be a foreigner.
- But I speak Finnish.

457
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,913
You people learn fast.
You don't look Finnish.

458
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,550
How did you get into the country?

459
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,158
Just a moment.

460
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:37,155
I believe I've got a right
to make one phone call.

461
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,914
You've been watching too many films.

462
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,829
Who'd you call, any way?
- My girlfriend.

463
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,039
You've been bus y, haven't you?

464
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,431
I guess she has a name?
- Not for you.

465
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,399
Inkeri speaking.

466
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,032
Irma!

467
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,679
It's for you.

468
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,357
Hallo?

469
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,877
Criminal Law, chapter 16, section 4:

470
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,670
A person commits
insubordination by re fusing -

471
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,516
to give the police
particulars stated in -

472
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,316
subsection 10 of the Police Act.

473
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,713
If the law does not require
a harsher punishment -

474
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,674
he must be sentenced to a fine -

475
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,072
or to a maximum of
three months in prison -

476
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,313
for insubordination.
What do you say to that?

477
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,993
He say s nothing. I am his lawyer -

478
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,074
and will represent
the suspect from no w on.

479
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,591
That section of the law -

480
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,675
only applies if you
can prove that my client -

481
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:19,079
did it deliberately
and with premeditation.

482
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,035
This is not the case, however,
because it was due to -

483
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,518
a probably temporary loss of
memory caused by violence.

484
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,234
The 1920 Supreme Court ruling -

485
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:38,272
number 116 states that
by holding him in custody -

486
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,389
for more than 48 hours the police -

487
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,518
are not only guilty of misconduct -

488
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,878
but also of deprivation of freedom.

489
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,431
Following my advice
my client has, however -

490
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,228
refrained from filing a suit -

491
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,358
if set free immediately -

492
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:02,355
and no other action
against him will be taken -

493
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,116
because of this incident.

494
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:20,114
Chapter 8, paragraph 2
of the Mental Health Act -

495
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,757
enables an involuntary committal
to a psychiatric hospital -

496
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:29,437
due to an obvious need caused by
a serious mental disturbance -

497
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,072
failure of which action would
radically worsen his condition.

498
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:40,517
Subsection 3 makes that
clearly applicable only if -

499
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:47,149
no other mental health services
are usable in his case.

500
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,996
To be able to apply the law -

501
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,916
you should have within
48 hours procured -

502
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,274
a doctor's referral for observation.
May I see one?

503
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,473
Please leave us for a moment.
You can wait in the corridor.

504
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,588
That's it then. For now.

505
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:23,869
Stay away from further trouble,
especially from the law.

506
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,789
Here's a cigar for you.

507
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,590
Who sent you?
- The Salvation Army.

508
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,350
It's you.

509
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:07,955
I followed you from
the police station. - Why?

510
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:14,037
To apologise. I got you in trouble.

511
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,231
I was in trouble already.

512
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:26,314
I thought you might
do me a favour, for a fee.

513
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,276
I had an earthmoving firm.
I bought two new machines -

514
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:37,031
and then everything
collapsed, you remember.

515
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,279
The bank called in my loan -

516
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,633
getting rid of "unreliable clients".

517
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,714
The machines were sold
to the bank below cost.

518
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,150
Three week s later the bank -

519
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,119
sold them for three
times that much.

520
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,597
You understand what I'm saying?
- More or less.

521
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,718
When my account
was suddenly frozen -

522
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,469
I could not pay the salaries -

523
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,429
for men who'd already
done their job.

524
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,633
I had to let them go -

525
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:18,636
and still owed them money.

526
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,596
Can a man stand that? -No.

527
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,912
No.

528
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,395
I agree.

529
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,193
So I did what I did.

530
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,637
The money was mine any way.

531
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,520
Will you do me the favour?
- What is it?

532
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,439
Too many people here.

533
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,430
Let's talk in some other place.

534
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:07,916
The sums and the names
are on the envelopes -

535
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,153
and the in formation
where you can find them.

536
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,433
I come from the North,
and we pay our debts.

537
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,109
Here.

538
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,639
And this is for you.

539
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,272
Why don't you do it yourself?
- Too risky.

540
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,871
The police know who did the robbery.

541
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,596
In that case this is not
the safest place for you.

542
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,514
Doesn't matter, any more.

543
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,031
Will you do it? -Yes.

544
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,479
Tell the boys I'm sorry
for what happened -

545
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,671
but there it is.

546
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,276
You'd better go no w.

547
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,836
WHO IS THIS MAN?

548
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,630
BANK ROBBER REFUSES
TO REVEAL HIS NAME

549
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,268
Rather small potatoes.

550
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,717
The weather was bad.
But they'll make a soup.

551
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,715
When did you plan to make it?
- Why so interested?

552
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,834
I have an onion.
You need it for the soup.

553
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,272
I've got eight potatoes.

554
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,875
I must save three for the winter -

555
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,549
and at least two as seed potatoes.

556
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,913
We farmers must think
of the coming years, too.

557
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,198
We only eat what is left over.

558
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,509
There's not enough for three,
I want to invite Irma to dinner.

559
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,350
So none for me? -Right.

560
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,749
You're selfish. - I'm a realist.

561
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,272
You city people are
children of the moment.

562
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,873
You might be a city man yourself.
- With a harvest like this? Never.

563
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,839
Give me half a potato, for scurvy.

564
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,835
I won't survive without teeth.

565
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,357
Must go.

566
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,069
We've discovered your identity.
- Really?

567
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:53,390
We leaked your photo to the press
and your wife contacted us today.

568
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,598
My wife... - Yes.

569
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,390
Your name is Jaakko Antero Lujanen.

570
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,514
Does it sound familiar?

571
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,236
Are you sure? -Yes.

572
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,677
You are a metal worker from Nurmes.

573
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,149
What did you say about a wife?
- She's absolutely certain.

574
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,273
The local police
showed her your photo.

575
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,077
I don't know why your
disappearance wasn't reported.

576
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,192
If you do have a wife...
some where there -

577
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,634
you must return home.

578
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,873
I don't want to.

579
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,112
Marriage is sacred.
I brought the train schedules.

580
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,756
Will you stay a moment longer?

581
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,679
It wouldn't be proper -

582
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,790
especially now
that you're married.

583
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,912
You could help me to pack.

584
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,758
But you have nothing.
- That's why.

585
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:35,393
Let's just sit, quiet.

586
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,519
I made you sandwiches.

587
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,193
Your home is so far away.

588
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,037
You won't forget...

589
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,949
The child of sorrow?

590
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,112
How could I?

591
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,233
You were my first love.

592
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:19,394
That was beautifully said. - Yes.

593
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,392
Go now.

594
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,836
It's time.

595
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,788
Hi.

596
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,959
Hi.

597
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,908
Is your mother home?

598
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,712
You always were
lousy at flattery.

599
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,874
Did you wait for me? -For years.

600
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,674
Forgive me for asking but...

601
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,639
Did we fight a lot?

602
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,031
You really don't remember
much, do you?

603
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,035
Not a thing.

604
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,996
We did. More and more.

605
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,430
It led to a divorce.

606
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,596
I don't understand.

607
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,591
Did I drink too much?
- No, not at all.

608
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,232
You never touched a drink.
- I didn't?

609
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,189
Instead you gambled.

610
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,275
Fruit machines, pin-ball machines,
poker, anything.

611
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,589
You lost all your LPs
playing blackjack.

612
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:49,390
Then what happened?
- We carried on for a time.

613
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,277
Your guilt complexes
made you speechless.

614
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,552
I wasn't much better my self.

615
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:04,159
Finally we slept in separate rooms.

616
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,992
Go on.

617
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,955
We filed for divorce.

618
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,828
You went south after a job -

619
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,718
and I never heard from you.
Until I saw you in the paper.

620
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,359
Suddenly you were famous.

621
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,479
A photo and all.

622
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,636
Now what?

623
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,950
The divorce came through in June.

624
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,436
I would've sent you the papers -

625
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,393
but you left me no address.

626
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,148
When you never called -

627
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:52,718
I thought you didn't care.
- I'm sorry.

628
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,676
I got beaten up.

629
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,954
I'd have written if
I'd known about you.

630
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,438
I'm Ovaskainen.

631
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,993
Lujanen.

632
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,995
Shall we fight, then? -Why?

633
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,033
I love that woman. - That's good.

634
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,074
She seems to like you, too.

635
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,952
What do you mean? -Nothing.

636
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,872
Nothing? -Yes.

637
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,680
So no demands?
- Why should I have?

638
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,832
Love each other as
you would love yourself.

639
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,473
Talk properly.

640
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,798
We are divorced.

641
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,271
Seems like things weren't
too good earlier, either.

642
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:12,236
So we don't need to fight?
- I don't see any reason for it.

643
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,832
I guess you're a better man
than what I've heard.

644
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,230
I'll let that one pass.

645
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,750
Just one request.

646
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,917
Be good to her. - OK. Sure.

647
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,910
Want a ride to the station?
- Yes, please.

648
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,311
Now that all's been settled -

649
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,394
you can say goodbye
to her, if you want.

650
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,758
Your sake, sir.

651
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,198
Thank you.

652
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:48,708
I thought we already
killed that one once.

653
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,829
So you decided to come back.

654
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,316
Obviously.

655
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,237
What's this?

656
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,519
They get what they deserve.

657
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,917
They've beaten up many of us.

658
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,391
Us? -Yes.

659
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,589
I'll call for an ambulance,
but not too soon -

660
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,071
if you don't mind.
Shall we go?

661
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:59,317
Where to? -Where were you going?

662
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,070
Home.

663
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,110
There's a social evening
in the canteen.

664
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:35,593
I remember the prettiest of parks

665
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:43,311
The wonderful Monrepos

666
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:51,118
My dr ams often take me back

667
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:58,719
To that leafy fairy land

668
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:06,592
The prettiest arched bridges

669
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:14,238
The loveliest moonlit nights

670
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:22,397
I have seen in the park

671
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:31,355
of Monrepos

672
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:38,470
Back to the by gone times

673
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:46,112
My thoughts again they fly

674
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,429
The days of the past

675
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,270
The wondrous tales that last

676
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:02,074
Still come alive in my mind

677
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:09,595
I remember the beautiful park

678
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:17,353
The wonderful Monrepos

679
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:25,713
Forever I've hidden
In my he art the park

680
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:33,397
Of Monrepos

681
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,478
My thoughts again return...

682
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:47,119
You did not stay away
for long. - No.

683
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:51,597
For a moment I was afraid.
- For no reason.
