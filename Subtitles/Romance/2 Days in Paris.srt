1
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:38,085
Can you turn the radio down?
We've been on a train for 12 hours.

2
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:39,396
We're exhausted.

3
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,683
Twelve? Where from?

4
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:42,916
Venice.

5
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:47,123
Hate the place!
Took both my wives there.

6
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:51,920
The program about battered wives!
I want to listen to this.

7
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:53,356
Why?

8
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,643
I had two wives
and I beat them both.

9
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:56,683
That's horrible!

10
00:04:57,447 --> 00:04:59,244
Yeah, I was wrong...

11
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:30,121
So I gave her a good hiding myself.

12
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,799
What's he taking pictures of?

13
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:53,163
Everything. Absolutely everything.

14
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,163
Another terrorist attack...

15
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:57,556
Listen to that!

16
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:59,644
Another fast-food joint
going up in smoke.

17
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:02,560
Last week it was two sports stores,

18
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,683
and last month a supermarket.

19
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,963
He's an "anti-globalization
protester".

20
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:10,164
He burns fast food?
I heard there's shit in their meat!

21
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,396
It's right here.

22
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,926
Didn't your train get in at nine?

23
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:32,239
Yeah, but with traffic, strikes...
France, what a mess!

24
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:36,161
What? Can't the poor
exploited nurses go on strike?

25
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:38,283
This isn't America!

26
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:42,599
You still have that huge suitcase.
You'll break your back!

27
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,758
You never listen, anyway.
If it's not...

28
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,082
Marion.

29
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:59,246
Mom, Marion's stuck again!

30
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,359
Mom, is Marion a retard?

31
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,797
We've got two willies!

32
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:32,558
Move it!

33
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:05,282
You've always done exactly
what you wanted.

34
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:08,036
And we had to fall in line.
Really, l...

35
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:10,122
Hello, madam.

36
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,043
Are you OK?

37
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:28,486
Give me the pussycat...
Here, your phone!

38
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:40,078
Come down for lunch at one.
Don't be late. Your dad hates that!

39
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:42,918
- How's Jean-Luc?
- Sleeping.

40
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,520
Am I disturbing you?

41
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,237
Don't come in,
we're getting changed.

42
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:06,564
I came to see
if you’ve got any clothes to wash.

43
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:09,844
- We'll bring it down later.
- OK, I'll wait.

44
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,565
- You'll wait downstairs?
- Yes.

45
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:13,319
Thanks.

46
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:15,160
Thanks, bye.

47
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:42,157
Dad?

48
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,847
- Oh, God!
- I'm going to start on the rabbit.

49
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,117
I have to chop it up.

50
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,316
All right?

51
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:58,401
All the sparrows in the garden
have been scared off by Jean-Luc.

52
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:01,115
Of course.
He'd gobble them up.

53
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,960
You think so? But he's so sweet.

54
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,526
Are you kidding?

55
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:08,964
It's only because we're bigger
and we feed him

56
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,924
that he doesn't eat us alive.

57
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,679
You're so negative!

58
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:13,922
Hasn't he put on weight?

59
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:18,717
I had some cans of foie gras
getting past their sell-by date...

60
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:20,766
You fed him foie gras?

61
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:22,804
You know he only eats dry cat food.

62
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:26,562
I've had him ten years
and that's all he eats.

63
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:28,160
Fat is bad for animals!

64
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:29,880
He's enormous!

65
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:31,275
He's like dad.

66
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:35,440
You get your hands on someone
and turn them into a fat lump.

67
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:38,758
They won't let me keep him
with me in the cabin.

68
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:41,680
That's why I have
to keep him under 5 kilos.

69
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:44,759
They'll put him in the luggage
compartment, drug him and...

70
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:47,566
Lots of animals die
during the flight.

71
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:50,878
How can you say that? I've taken care
of him for two weeks.

72
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:52,321
I love this cat

73
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:56,446
but your dad hates him,
he calls him "eat-shit-sleep".

74
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,167
He wanted to kick him out
and now you tell me...

75
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:00,806
Calm down.

76
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,435
- They'll put him in a cage!
- You're scaring him.

77
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,165
They're going to kill him!

78
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,278
What's going on?

79
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:22,165
We couldn't go on vacation
because of that spoiled doormat!

80
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:26,361
You say Paris is great in summer,
with all the filthy cars gone away.

81
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,757
If you upset your mother,
you'll be in trouble.

82
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:32,397
He's fat. He had them chopped off.
Like me!

83
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:33,443
That's why I got fat!

84
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:35,918
I had them chopped off
by your mother!

85
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:39,157
Bastard!

86
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:07,395
Your other cat!
He hasn't had them chopped off, huh?

87
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:10,079
Does he understand?

88
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:15,721
It's very hot. Watch out.

89
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:20,443
Lapin.

90
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:21,917
What's lapin?

91
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,562
Very good.

92
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:46,920
A thigh.

93
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:49,323
Plate.

94
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:55,365
A small piece.
I'm used to small ones!

95
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:58,162
- Marion?
- Some back.

96
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:00,846
Oh, the head!

97
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:02,962
For real men!

98
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:06,120
Real men eat the head.

99
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:33,883
Anna, pass your plate.

100
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:37,279
What a pain in the butt!

101
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:40,166
Got enough, dad? Is that your diet?

102
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,443
Rabbit is lean meat.

103
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:45,201
But look how much you're eating!

104
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,363
And look at your fat ass!

105
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,085
This guy is sick in the head!

106
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:53,444
I've got a fat ass because
I stopped smoking 18 months ago.

107
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:57,885
Jean not, that's enough!
Will you stop bugging her?

108
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:02,882
She's the one bugging us!
She came from New York especially!

109
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:04,397
Shut up, asshole!

110
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,080
Let's be civilized.

111
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:08,715
He came all this way to meet you.
Talk to him!

112
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,844
We'll talk to Jack, then.

113
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:15,963
We'll talk about
American literature.

114
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:45,243
Dad, don't start!

115
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:00,557
Rimbaud.

116
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:03,956
Rambo?

117
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:07,639
That's how they say it in English.

118
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:12,676
What a bunch of idiots!

119
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:13,877
Please!

120
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:30,516
Not bad!

121
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:31,996
See!

122
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,878
He's not like the morons
you usually bring home.

123
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:50,116
Thanks a lot!

124
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,716
With such a weird face
he better be smart!

125
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:57,126
It's Rose.

126
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:00,637
Hi.

127
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,240
It stinks in here!

128
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:05,285
Sorry, we didn't have time
to deodorize!

129
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:07,199
- Hi, dad.
- You're early.

130
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:08,766
I got out of work early.

131
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:17,885
- As attractive as in the photos!
- As nice as ever!

132
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:21,084
- Isn’t there any coffee?
- Yes, in the coffeepot.

133
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:23,886
- See to it, huh?
- As usual!

134
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:26,800
- She's getting worse.
- I pity the kids she takes care of.

135
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,036
I can hear you!

136
00:23:43,127 --> 00:23:47,484
The catacombs and a cemetery?
A lot of fun, isn't he?

137
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:08,960
Mom, do you ever use your computer?

138
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:11,436
No. We asked Rose to teach us but...

139
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:13,086
I haven't had time.

140
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:16,444
You didn't show them at all?
Or fid someone else to do it?

141
00:24:16,607 --> 00:24:20,600
You show up, hand out your presents,
and leave the rest to me.

142
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:23,486
But you help people
with learning disabilities.

143
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:27,242
Once and for all, I help children
with psychological problems,

144
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:28,806
not retards!

145
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,878
Hey, you two brats!

146
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:35,359
Just because you can send e-miles
doesn't make you superior.

147
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:40,360
You can put so many photos
on this thing!

148
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:41,960
Yes, it's digital.

149
00:24:51,887 --> 00:24:54,321
Rose? Why did you say that?

150
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:57,126
It's just a joke. He didn't get it.

151
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:05,805
- You're a real pain!
- I didn't do anything!

152
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:08,485
Stop it, dad.

153
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:11,241
No, dad, please don't!

154
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:14,161
What a pain!
Please don't do this!

155
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:19,040
Nice weenie with balloons!

156
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:25,761
- You're unbelievable!
- I'm sorry.

157
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:27,839
Nice weenie!

158
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:29,201
Mom!

159
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,559
- Really, Anna!
- You're pains, all of you!

160
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:38,883
Stop being overprotective.

161
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:50,202
Drop by your dad's art gallery.
There's an opening.

162
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:57,802
Homosexuals! It's just not right.

163
00:25:58,407 --> 00:25:59,283
It's disgusting!

164
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,962
Huh, Kiki? You wouldn't do that.

165
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:24,516
Are you all right, miss?

166
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:20,517
Manu!

167
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:22,439
- Marion? Amazing!
- OK?

168
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:24,518
I was talking about you...

169
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,246
- Only today.
- Really?

170
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:28,599
So what's new?

171
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:32,277
- Well, my book's just come out...
- Great! A novel?

172
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:35,007
No, short stories. But... linked.

173
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:36,436
Great!

174
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:38,518
This is Jack. Manu.

175
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,800
So that's it? You've settled
in the States for good?

176
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:51,086
For now, yeah.
I'm with Jack and it's going well.

177
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:55,799
What?

178
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,840
Are you going to Vanessa's tonight?

179
00:28:59,007 --> 00:29:01,567
- Yes, for sure.
- Me too.

180
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,602
You haven't changed, it's amazing.

181
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,997
It's like time has stood still.

182
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:11,362
- Stop it!
- You decided not to age...

183
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:14,678
Cut the bullshit.
We spent all night on a train...

184
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:17,202
- You look gorgeous.
- Stop it.

185
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:19,676
- I swear.
- Stop it, stop it!

186
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:22,965
Well, we'd better go.
My dad has an opening later.

187
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:26,517
- Jeannot. Say hello for me.
- Yeah. See you later.

188
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:24,921
Are you American?

189
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:27,718
He is, I'm French.
We live in New York.

190
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:29,725
Cool! I love New York.

191
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:33,482
I went last year.
I loved downtown, Soho...

192
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:39,762
- Are you married?
- No.

193
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:41,605
- Do you have children?
- No.

194
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:43,241
Really? How old are you?

195
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,042
We're all friends here, right?

196
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,405
Yeah. I'm 35.

197
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:50,797
Don't wait too long.
Won't he give you one?

198
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,395
No, it's me.

199
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,762
No, no... I don't believe that.

200
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:58,238
All women want children.
It's in their nature.

201
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,477
If he doesn't want to,

202
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:02,717
I can help!
It's up to you, of course.

203
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:05,845
I make beautiful kids.
So if you want a Brad Pitt

204
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:07,486
or a George Clooney.
It's up to you.

205
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:09,275
You know who to call.

206
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:17,326
I'm just saying because...
you're not bad.

207
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:19,000
You look like
that American actress...

208
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,397
She's married to that guy
from Fatal Attraction. Douglas!

209
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:26,040
That's the one!

210
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,476
But I'm blonde
and I don't look like her.

211
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:35,322
But you've got exactly
the same face, sparkling eyes...

212
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,603
You're like twin sisters.

213
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:40,361
Except you're more beautiful,
of course.

214
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:11,358
'68, at the barricades!

215
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:48,201
Marion, "migraine"?
What's he saying?

216
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:51,403
Speak French, goddammit!

217
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:53,444
Are you nuts?
You'll scare him.

218
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:57,162
Red wine gives him migraines.

219
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:59,921
- The exhibition's fabulous, dad.
- Really, you like it?

220
00:38:06,887 --> 00:38:09,765
Dad, show him my favorites.

221
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,401
I'll leave you with Jack.
You take care of him.

222
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:16,401
But we can't understand each other.

223
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,725
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

224
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:46,115
Yeah, fine.

225
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,559
Goodbye, Jack. See you soon.

226
00:42:32,607 --> 00:42:36,919
Elves came to help me one day
when I was looking for something

227
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,281
and they found it for me.

228
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:40,597
- Bullshit!
- I swear it's true!

229
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:51,085
I saw you from over there.

230
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:53,715
You're doing an exhibition?
Photos?

231
00:43:53,887 --> 00:43:55,878
A bit more conceptual.

232
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:57,878
Sort of Bill Viola,

233
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:01,079
but more sexual!
You'd like it.

234
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:02,522
Manu!

235
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:34,637
D - C E I T

236
00:47:20,527 --> 00:47:23,837
I really like this salad.
Are there mussels in it?

237
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:27,078
I can't take it.
We fight all the time.

238
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:46,564
I was talking to Jack.
Nice guy.

239
00:48:46,727 --> 00:48:47,637
Yeah, nice.

240
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:50,765
Not uptight, not too American.
No broom up his ass.

241
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:54,198
Tattoos all over,
but I guess you must like that.

242
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:56,803
Well, he's been in jail so...

243
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:00,796
- A financial thing? Enron...
- No, he did eight years.

244
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:03,356
Homicide. First-degree murder.

245
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:06,035
This guy was staying
with him and his girlfriend.

246
00:49:06,207 --> 00:49:07,606
Jack was 19 and he...

247
00:49:08,887 --> 00:49:11,162
He has anger-management issues.

248
00:49:11,327 --> 00:49:14,205
He invited me to stay
a few days in August but...

249
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:16,722
I wasn't sure I'd be able
to make it.

250
00:49:16,927 --> 00:49:17,837
That sucks!

251
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:20,038
I'm going to get another drink.

252
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:34,444
All these off-the wall projects,
I couldn't do them here.

253
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:36,325
I had to, I had to...

254
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:39,559
These old perverts wanted me
to blow them. Disgusting!

255
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,797
That's disgusting.

256
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:44,527
You didn't have to blow anyone
to make it?

257
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:49,397
- In art you don't have to blow?
- No, you don't have to blow, but...

258
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:53,124
- You have to lick a bit!
- Yeah, that's it!

259
00:49:55,687 --> 00:49:58,360
She's totally empty now.

260
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:00,482
Shit!

261
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:02,638
My contact lens.

262
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:08,157
There it is.

263
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:15,766
- You got it?
- Yeah.

264
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:16,643
Great!

265
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:20,155
I'll put it back in.

266
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:24,045
Hey, are you OK?
Don't fall.

267
00:51:10,527 --> 00:51:11,755
The mussels.

268
00:51:12,407 --> 00:51:14,967
I've just remembered, I'm allergic.

269
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:16,276
I ate mussels, didn't l?

270
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:28,482
I'm allergic to French mussels.

271
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:35,045
I don't have a pulse!

272
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:44,685
You had a dizzy spell!

273
00:51:44,847 --> 00:51:46,519
- I had no pulse!
- Breathe deeply.

274
00:51:47,047 --> 00:51:51,040
I had something stuck in my throat,
something hairy.

275
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:55,919
I'm allergic to French mussels,
you have to give me an injection!

276
00:51:56,087 --> 00:51:57,998
You ate too much, that's all.

277
00:51:58,167 --> 00:52:00,203
- Drink some water...
- I'm scared, doctor!

278
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,517
Get some fresh air, you'll be fine.

279
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:04,519
Your blood pressure's perfect.

280
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:27,718
Another Arab. The last one I took
jumped out without paying.

281
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:29,525
The other day I had some Germans.

282
00:52:30,007 --> 00:52:31,281
Never again!

283
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:33,961
They had sausages in their bags.
It still stinks!

284
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:36,676
Nothing but Romanian scum!

285
00:52:56,367 --> 00:52:59,006
Where's your friend from?
He doesn't speak French.

286
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:00,726
He's American.

287
00:53:01,007 --> 00:53:02,486
American?

288
00:53:02,807 --> 00:53:05,560
- You don't speak English.
- No, I don't.

289
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:08,764
- You don't speak many languages.
- What?

290
00:53:09,327 --> 00:53:10,919
I speak French, that's enough, OK?

291
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:15,683
You don't want us in your taxi
because we're not speaking French?

292
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:20,037
Who do you pick up in your taxi?
You don't like Germans...

293
00:53:20,887 --> 00:53:22,878
Arabs? No, you don't like Arabs.

294
00:53:23,207 --> 00:53:26,244
The Romanians?
Send them home with their whores!

295
00:53:26,407 --> 00:53:27,556
And gas the Jews!

296
00:53:27,727 --> 00:53:29,206
Hey, I never said that!

297
00:53:29,367 --> 00:53:32,518
Gas chambers were an invention
to get our money!

298
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:35,441
Are you sick in the head?
Listen to yourself!

299
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:38,883
Hey, dumb blonde,
who do you think you're talking to?

300
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:41,283
You're the fucking dumb blond!

301
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,880
We're getting out here.

302
00:54:02,047 --> 00:54:06,757
Before you get out you pay me,
or we go straight to the cops.

303
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:10,283
We'll pay you, asshole!
We're rich, we're Americans!

304
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,007
You shut your mouth!

305
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,601
- I'll kick your ass!
- Whose ass you gonna kick?

306
00:54:15,927 --> 00:54:18,566
You with the beard, shut up!

307
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:23,041
I'm just gonna find a spot to park,

308
00:54:23,207 --> 00:54:27,325
and then we'll have a talk...
little woman.

309
00:54:27,607 --> 00:54:29,120
We're gonna talk
about your little woman?

310
00:54:29,287 --> 00:54:32,996
- No, I said you, little woman!
- I thought you meant your wife.

311
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:35,317
Because I heard
your wife's fucking an Arab.

312
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:40,716
Thank you so much.
That was very educational.

313
00:54:40,887 --> 00:54:41,956
Thank you.

314
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:44,804
- Goodnight.
- Fuck you!

315
00:54:46,727 --> 00:54:48,718
Bitch! Go get fucked
by your Yank!

316
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:51,445
Jeannot, there's water everywhere!

317
00:57:57,287 --> 00:58:01,565
- Look at the carpet!
- Call the fire department!

318
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:04,241
- What is it?
- A pipe burst.

319
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:06,477
I'll cut the electricity.

320
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:08,766
They're on their way.

321
00:58:08,927 --> 00:58:12,602
They told me to turn off the water.
Where's the main inlet?

322
00:58:12,767 --> 00:58:16,362
I've no idea!
Go ask Mrs. Schindling.

323
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:17,801
- She knows?
- Yes!

324
00:58:32,327 --> 00:58:34,602
- Mom, do you need help?
- Shit!

325
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:36,076
OK.

326
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,843
Sorry, we're firemen, not plumbers.

327
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:42,526
Shit, shit!

328
00:58:43,207 --> 00:58:44,959
Sorry about my mom.

329
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:46,726
You live upstairs?

330
00:58:47,007 --> 00:58:49,441
Yes, upstairs.
But I live in New York.

331
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:52,915
They have awesome fire trucks!

332
00:58:53,607 --> 00:58:54,562
Fucking shit!

333
00:58:54,727 --> 00:58:57,036
Those are great sweaters.
Can you buy them anywhere?

334
00:58:57,487 --> 00:58:59,557
It's our uniform, given to us.

335
00:58:59,727 --> 00:59:02,639
I think you can find them
on the internet now.

336
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:09,121
- It's nice wool.
- Touch it.

337
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:11,118
- It's great wool.
- No, it's OK.

338
00:59:11,287 --> 00:59:12,561
Yeah, go on!

339
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,036
Not bad, huh?

340
00:59:15,207 --> 00:59:16,356
Good quality!

341
00:59:17,407 --> 00:59:18,522
Scottish wool!

342
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:24,918
What are they still doing here?

343
00:59:25,087 --> 00:59:27,362
Help me instead of flirting!

344
00:59:27,527 --> 00:59:29,563
We'd better go. Thanks.

345
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:36,401
Next time we'll call a plumber,
not the firemen. Thanks.

346
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:39,001
- Have a nice day.
- You too. Goodbye.

347
01:00:01,207 --> 01:00:02,765
Something wrong with that guy!

348
01:00:16,807 --> 01:00:17,683
Coming.

349
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,959
Bring your American to the market,
to see some real food!

350
01:00:21,127 --> 01:00:22,879
I'll have a shower first.

351
01:00:47,447 --> 01:00:48,516
Chaute.

352
01:00:49,487 --> 01:00:51,796
- Chaud.
- Yes, it's hot.

353
01:01:08,047 --> 01:01:11,562
- So why did he go to see his grave?
- It's a tourist thing.

354
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:16,324
- Does he know?
- No, I haven't told him.

355
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:18,921
I'll take this opportunity
to tell you.

356
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:22,363
The next time you go on vacation,

357
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:25,564
- leave your cat somewhere else.
- What do you mean?

358
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:26,921
What's the problem?

359
01:01:27,087 --> 01:01:31,160
Every day at 5 am
he wants to get in the bathroom.

360
01:01:31,327 --> 01:01:35,878
I told you he likes running water.

361
01:01:37,047 --> 01:01:38,844
That cat is low maintenance.

362
01:01:40,287 --> 01:01:41,163
Worse than a kid.

363
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:44,837
- Are you going to have one?
- Don't bug me.

364
01:01:45,007 --> 01:01:46,884
Look how this one's parked!

365
01:01:58,447 --> 01:02:00,244
Look at that one!

366
01:02:07,607 --> 01:02:10,804
Dad, stop it!
Do it at night if you have to.

367
01:02:10,967 --> 01:02:13,720
You're making Jack uncomfortable.
He doesn't like it.

368
01:02:31,527 --> 01:02:32,596
Cornflowers.

369
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:36,522
Yes, cornflowers.
I'll come back for them later.

370
01:02:36,687 --> 01:02:40,077
I won't pay you with my body today,
my daughter's with me!

371
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:51,478
"Sleep" not "slip"!
He doesn't sleep in a nighty!

372
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:56,600
Pig.

373
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,200
He was suckling last night.

374
01:03:06,607 --> 01:03:08,279
- What's that tongue?
- Calf.

375
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,164
I'm sick.

376
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:55,042
- He has a bit of a cold.
- A hangover?

377
01:04:07,967 --> 01:04:10,117
- He's sick?
- Just a cold.

378
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:13,165
Let's go
to the organic vegetables stall.

379
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:23,803
1 new message

380
01:04:51,807 --> 01:04:54,924
You make me as hard as wood!
Mathieu

381
01:05:01,287 --> 01:05:02,640
Hello, madam.

382
01:05:02,807 --> 01:05:04,638
Sorry, I thought
you were at the market.

383
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:10,596
I washed your shirts.
You don't mind?

384
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:11,802
Thanks very much.

385
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,281
I had a short affair with him.

386
01:05:46,727 --> 01:05:48,524
No Aids, no death...

387
01:06:01,727 --> 01:06:03,718
Abortion movement...

388
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,682
The 343 Bitches movement...

389
01:06:10,807 --> 01:06:12,638
I was one of the bitches!

390
01:06:40,207 --> 01:06:42,198
Lovely flowers, miss!

391
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:46,243
Stop hitting
on every girl, dad, please!

392
01:06:46,407 --> 01:06:49,126
- Hitting on them?
- Anything that moves!

393
01:06:49,447 --> 01:06:51,244
I only hit on pretty girls!

394
01:06:53,647 --> 01:06:56,844
You loved it, you hussy
Having me lick your pussy...

395
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:07,165
I'm your salami for life

396
01:07:18,447 --> 01:07:21,484
- What music would you like?
- What do you have?

397
01:07:21,647 --> 01:07:23,160
Brel, Ferre, Trenet,

398
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:24,803
Barbara.

399
01:07:25,527 --> 01:07:28,644
- Whatever you prefer.
- I'll put something on for you.

400
01:08:09,527 --> 01:08:11,199
And tons of cake servers

401
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:13,278
A 10-speed blender

402
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:16,242
Just for your vinaigrettes

403
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:19,122
A beautiful air-purifier

404
01:08:20,087 --> 01:08:21,839
That eats all smells

405
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:26,005
Heated blankets
Waffle irons

406
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:27,720
An airplane for two

407
01:08:28,767 --> 01:08:29,995
And we'll be happy!

408
01:08:44,327 --> 01:08:45,362
Hi.

409
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,287
Still writing
for that right-wing rag?

410
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:01,277
OK, Edouard?

411
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:05,001
At least you're faithful
to your friends.

412
01:09:05,287 --> 01:09:06,402
Shall we go?

413
01:09:07,487 --> 01:09:08,522
Have you decided?

414
01:09:13,407 --> 01:09:14,840
A beer, please.

415
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:16,396
An omelet.

416
01:09:22,687 --> 01:09:24,917
How was your trip
to the Philippines?

417
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:27,957
Gael.

418
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:29,644
Edouard.

419
01:09:36,327 --> 01:09:38,363
The trip you dumped me for,
to be "free".

420
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:40,281
Let's go.

421
01:09:41,127 --> 01:09:43,800
Ex-pats never get over
those exotic countries.

422
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:45,839
It's like former colonials.

423
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:47,998
Life's so good there.
The women are...

424
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:50,681
so gentle, so young.

425
01:09:50,847 --> 01:09:51,597
Finished?

426
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:52,724
It speaks!

427
01:09:52,887 --> 01:09:54,639
You've grown some balls.

428
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:55,842
Interesting!

429
01:09:56,007 --> 01:09:57,440
You couldn't handle me
dumping you.

430
01:09:57,607 --> 01:09:59,723
What I couldn't handle
was something else!

431
01:09:59,887 --> 01:10:01,240
But I better not say.

432
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:12,644
You're not that dull.
I found that out later on.

433
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:14,639
You weren't my type, period.

434
01:10:14,847 --> 01:10:16,644
Wanna know what his type is?

435
01:10:16,807 --> 01:10:17,922
Shut up!

436
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:25,242
No, I'm not his type.
He worked for an NGO in Thailand,

437
01:10:25,407 --> 01:10:26,886
and screwed 12-year-olds!

438
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:31,598
A 30-year-old is less sexy
than a "woman" of 12!

439
01:10:31,767 --> 01:10:33,758
You're crazy,
it's all in your head.

440
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:35,440
Oh, yes, I forgot.

441
01:10:35,967 --> 01:10:36,956
He explained to me.

442
01:10:37,127 --> 01:10:39,925
We judge it with our Western minds.
We shouldn't.

443
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:42,519
It's different over there.

444
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:46,043
It's normal for women
and children to be prostitutes.

445
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:50,086
It's their culture. You shouldn't
feel guilty about screwing them.

446
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:51,236
It's true.

447
01:10:51,407 --> 01:10:55,195
You pretend to help the Third World
but screw them like everyone else!

448
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:57,278
Just because I ditched you!

449
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:00,886
All I wanted was a chick
who can shut up.

450
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:02,844
A 12-year-old
knows how to do that.

451
01:11:03,007 --> 01:11:04,201
But I don't!

452
01:11:04,367 --> 01:11:07,359
Edouard, he screwed
the love of your life

453
01:11:07,527 --> 01:11:08,755
on vacation.

454
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:12,964
Oh, darn it!

455
01:11:13,127 --> 01:11:15,436
He didn't... You never told him?

456
01:11:15,607 --> 01:11:17,325
Oh, I'm sorry, really!

457
01:11:17,727 --> 01:11:18,398
Shut up,

458
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:19,636
cunt!

459
01:11:27,727 --> 01:11:28,796
She's insane!

460
01:11:30,927 --> 01:11:32,440
I'm calm now.

461
01:11:39,487 --> 01:11:40,363
That's enough!

462
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:46,196
- We didn't break anything.
- Go on, get outta here!

463
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,839
This shows France in a great light!

464
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:52,756
Tourists!

465
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:47,840
What means "lick pussy"?

466
01:14:48,007 --> 01:14:49,281
You sicko!

467
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:01,119
Sir, I don't speak English.

468
01:17:18,487 --> 01:17:22,844
Sir, there's the salad menu,
the veggie menu and the double menu.

469
01:17:23,007 --> 01:17:24,645
Just choose one of them.

470
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,956
It's simple.

471
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:39,681
That'll be 5 euros 30.

472
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:50,436
Thank you, goodbye.

473
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,719
Hi, Mathieu, it's Marion.

474
01:19:11,927 --> 01:19:16,318
It's weird that you called.
I just took it out of my workshop,

475
01:19:16,727 --> 01:19:18,797
and I'm just finishing it off.

476
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,326
And there it is!

477
01:19:23,327 --> 01:19:25,636
But... what is it? Who is it?

478
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:27,206
It's you.

479
01:19:29,967 --> 01:19:31,446
Not bad, eh?

480
01:19:33,527 --> 01:19:37,156
It's beautiful.
Your style's really developed.

481
01:19:37,327 --> 01:19:38,760
Yeah, you're right.

482
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:46,399
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

483
01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:49,681
It's you. It's incredible.

484
01:22:16,527 --> 01:22:19,041
The restroom's full of smoke.
Someone locked the door.

485
01:22:33,567 --> 01:22:35,762
I'll explain about the messages.

486
01:22:35,927 --> 01:22:38,157
What will you tell him?

487
01:22:38,447 --> 01:22:42,645
That it was a joke,
that I don't give a shit,

488
01:22:42,807 --> 01:22:44,798
and that I obviously don't love you!

489
01:22:47,447 --> 01:22:50,598
Nobody wants me.
I can't take it anymore!

490
01:22:51,527 --> 01:22:53,279
That's not tr...

491
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:55,563
Come on out of there.

492
01:22:56,407 --> 01:22:59,444
What are you doing?
Don't break or dirty anything.

493
01:23:00,967 --> 01:23:02,082
I'll call your sister.

494
01:23:21,407 --> 01:23:23,125
Outta my way, jerk!

495
01:23:25,647 --> 01:23:28,286
My bag, my bag! It's him!

496
01:23:29,007 --> 01:23:31,567
My bag! Thief! Thief!

497
01:23:35,087 --> 01:23:37,840
American, my ass! Filthy Arab!

498
01:23:38,007 --> 01:23:39,235
My bag!

499
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:41,280
Police!

500
01:23:54,287 --> 01:23:57,120
Marion, just come out, OK?

501
01:23:57,287 --> 01:24:00,962
Mathieu doesn't want to touch me.
I repulse men! I'm a fat tuna!

502
01:24:01,127 --> 01:24:02,401
What's all this?

503
01:24:02,567 --> 01:24:06,321
No, I tried to kiss her, but
she keeps sobbing, it's impossible.

504
01:24:06,487 --> 01:24:10,400
Of course. She's in love
with her boyfriend. No psychology!

505
01:24:10,927 --> 01:24:14,636
Marion, what got into you,
wanting to screw this idiot?

506
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:16,566
I'll leave you to it.

507
01:24:17,247 --> 01:24:20,444
Sorry, sir, we made a mistake.
We're really sorry.

508
01:24:22,447 --> 01:24:25,359
- Are you sure it's not him?
- Yes, we're sure.

509
01:24:32,847 --> 01:24:33,802
A cup of tea.

510
01:24:34,007 --> 01:24:35,963
Sorry about your soap holder.

511
01:24:36,127 --> 01:24:37,401
I'm sorry too.

512
01:24:37,807 --> 01:24:39,126
What did you do?

513
01:24:39,847 --> 01:24:43,362
- I dropped it by accident.
- You broke it?

514
01:24:44,927 --> 01:24:47,919
- The poor guy. You show up...
- I'm horrible, I know.

515
01:24:48,087 --> 01:24:49,998
The old fill-in guy!

516
01:24:50,727 --> 01:24:54,925
We get all wound up with jealousy
and shit, and we've got everything!

517
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:59,046
We're shallow with
bourgeois problems, as mom says.

518
01:24:59,207 --> 01:25:01,801
And there are people dying in wars.

519
01:25:02,247 --> 01:25:04,078
Marion, don't start again.

520
01:25:04,247 --> 01:25:07,205
The other day
I read this article that said...

521
01:25:08,087 --> 01:25:08,758
What?

522
01:25:08,927 --> 01:25:12,920
We use more toilet paper than men
because we wipe when we pee.

523
01:25:13,087 --> 01:25:15,282
Each time I wipe now
I think about it.

524
01:25:15,647 --> 01:25:18,320
- About what?
- All that we destroy.

525
01:25:29,127 --> 01:25:32,597
I love you, sister.
You're a pain, but I adore you.

526
01:25:32,767 --> 01:25:33,882
Is it your little bunny?

527
01:25:34,247 --> 01:25:35,236
No, it's you.

528
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:37,045
I'm talking to you.

529
01:25:37,207 --> 01:25:39,277
- Thank you, sister.
- You're so dumb!

530
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:41,882
I'd better go.

531
01:25:42,047 --> 01:25:44,561
- And see your guy?
- I don't know.
