Feel its rhythm.

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,441
We have to be
close enough to touch.

7
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,320
We must know where the <i>abviq</i>
will surface before it does.

8
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,447
Can you tell me?

00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,204
Concentrate!
Come on, concentrate.

Barrow, Alaska October, 1988

13
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,364
The avocado,

14
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,889
a native fruit of Mexico and the key
ingredient used in making guacamole.

15
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,043
Now, nothing grows
in this brutal climate.

16
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,569
So, how did the avocado end up 300
miles north of the Arctic Circle?

17
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,849
Well, this little guy and pretty
much everything else in town

18
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,763
has to take
four separate plane rides

19
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,128
to arrive up here
in chilly Barrow, Alaska.

20
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,527
As you can imagine, the folks
here at Amigos restaurant,

21
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,968
the northern-most Mexican
restaurant in the world,

22
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,168
well, they can't get enough
of this special treat.

23
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,529
Hey, guys, how's the food?

24
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,568
<i>Holy guacamole, that's good.</i>

25
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,011

No, no.

36

Speech! Speech! Speech!

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,004
All right.
Let me think.

38
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,804
I think it was Mark Twain

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,605
who said that the coldest
winter he ever spent

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,330
was a summer in San Francisco.

41
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,204
Let me tell you this is the coldest
summer I've spent anywhere.

42
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,881
But with the warmest people,
and I really mean that.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,685
Thank you all
for your hospitality.

44
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,000
Appreciate it.

45
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,531
When are you leaving?

46
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,405
Thursday.

47
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,249
Wait, you said that you
were gonna do a story

48
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,408
on my cousin and
his snowmobile tricks.

49
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,521
You promised.

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,489
I promised?

51
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,244
I think I said, if I had time.
I'm really sorry.

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,361
Come on.

53
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,601
I don't think
I'm gonna have time.

54
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,886
Please, it won't take long.
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,286
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,563
He'll blow your mind.

58

Keep it up!

59
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,406
Cool! Very cool!

Get this one.
This one, this one.

Awesome, Arnold!

62
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,090
This is pretty amazing, huh?

63

You're being serious?

64
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,730
Yeah.
This is it?

65
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,687
He's only warming up

66
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,888
Arnold, do the Donuts!

67

Do something, Arnold.

68
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,490

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,400
MAN: Boys.

Now, now.
Come on, Rob.

73
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,324
We don't know who's going
to get the drilling rights

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,441
until we hear the bids.

75
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,090
I think that's the
way it works, right?

76
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,525
I'm surprised to see you here.

77
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,361
I thought you would be down on
the ranch roping some R and R.

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,363
Well, I figure, what's the
fun in buying a new car

79
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,164
if you can't be there
to take delivery?

80
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,921
MAN: Good morning.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,048
If everyone
will please take a seat,

82
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,724
we will go ahead
and get started.

83
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,647
As you all know, the bids for the
oil drilling rights to Bristol Bay

84
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,564
have all been submitted to the
US Department of the Interior

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,682
and have been kept secret.

86
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,890
Until now.

87
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,244
The highest bid is,

88
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,565
and the contract
for Bristol Bay goes to

89
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,082
J.W. McGraw and
Alaska Northern Oil.

90
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,650
Yes!

103
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,361
<i>It's their favorite.</i>

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,841
Wait, I'm not done.

105
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,967
I'm not finished.

106
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,087
Yes, you are.

Are you... Really?

109
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,730
Okay, fine.
I'll read the bids myself.

110
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,763
Steller sea lions!

111
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,806
Hello, guys.

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,650
Hey.

113
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,890
Malik, Pat.
Hi.

114
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,086
You got to see this.

115
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,651
And here comes number two.

116
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,044
Female.

117
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,727
First one was a male,
young but grown.

118
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,643
Oh! It's a baby,
maybe eight months old.

119
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,846
Can they get free?

120
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,646
No. This solid ice goes for
five miles from the...

121
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,962
This is solid ice, Adam.

122
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,525
It goes for five miles

123
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,843
from here to the waterways
that lead to the open ocean.

124
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,689
These gray heads are too soft
to go through thick ice,

125
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,843
but they know they have to keep the
hole open so they don't drown.

126
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,805
What do you think?
A couple of days?

127
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,361
Two, maybe three days,
then this freezes over and...

128
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,287
<i>Cuts and bruises are now visible
each time the whales surface.</i>

129
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,681

there is no choice.</i>

Adam, how are things
up there in the icebox?

135
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,969
Going pretty well. Just preparing
for my move to Chickaloon.

136
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,203
Yeah. That's good, because it
seems like your material up there

137
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,721
is running pretty thin.

138
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,567
Well, you know what? I think Barrow
might have one more story left in her.

139
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,405
<i>Oh, really?
What do you got?</i>

140
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,051
Ten more great uses
for seal blubber?

141
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,168
<i>No, whales, actually.</i>

142
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,481
I got three California grays
trapped in the ice.

143
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,722
I got a great report
and a ton of footage.

144
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,881
Whales, huh?

145
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,644
Everybody loves whales.

146
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,529
Yeah, I guess.

147
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,162
Well, shoot it on
down to me on the satellite.

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,169
You have whales in trouble up
there and you didn't call me?

177
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,481
I didn't call you because
there's nothing you can do.

178
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,643
<i>Well, there's always
something you can do.</i>

179
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,964
You didn't call me
because I'm me.

180
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,645
Yes, that's also true.

181
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,807
Because when we broke up,

182
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,571
you said not to call you
or speak to you ever again.

183
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,401
But this is different.
There are whales in trouble.

184
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,330
Rachel, if I called you every time a
dung beetle or a fungus was in trouble,

185
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,642
we'd never get off the phone.

186
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,291
<i>Adam.</i>

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,002
Okay, how long can they last?

188
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,127
<i>ADAM:
I don't know.</i>

189
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,850
<i>Pat says a couple of days.</i>

190
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,530
<i>The ice is getting thicker.</i>

191
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,880
<i>That's not
your only problem, though.</i>

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,445
<i>The Inupiats
want to harvest them.</i>

193
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,962
But they don't eat grays,
they eat bowhead.

194
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,122
I know, but they haven't
filled their quota this year.

195
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,965
So, on Sunday night the whaling captains
are meeting to get their permit.

196
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,003
Not if I can help it.

197
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,970
<i>MAN: And a big thank you
to Governor Haskell.</i>

198
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,800
Governor Haskell.

199
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,564
Miss Kramer,
nice to see you again.

200
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,722
How's everything in nature?

201
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,485
Fine. Listen, I don't
mean to disrupt you...

202
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,130
I don't think you
know any other way.

203
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,962
Governor, three gray whales are
trapped off the coast of Barrow

204
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,327
and we were wondering
if you could help us.

205
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,845
What kind of help?

206
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,609
Mobilize the National
Guard up to Barrow

207
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,650
with a ship that can
break through the ice.

208
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,446
Are you serious?

209
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,241
You want me to mobilize the National
Guard to save a few whales?

210
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,331
Excuse me.

211
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,522
Because whales
can't vote, right?

212
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,285
And they can't give
big campaign contributions,

213
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,324
so, who cares about a bunch
of stupid whales, right?

214
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,526
Please.

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,082
In Alaska,
there are no simple rescues.

216
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,248
If I get
the National Guard involved,

217
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,362
I'm putting
their lives at risk,

218
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,807
and when a whale dies,
Miss Kramer,

219
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,884
you don't have to tell
its wife and children.

220
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,727
NBC Studios, New York

221
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,042
PRODUCER: All right, people, let's
go over this one more time.

222
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,728
We do the Bush-Dukakis debates,
followed by voter reaction.

223
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,771
Do the budget deficit piece,
the S&L indictments and what?

224
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,881
The Anti-Drug bill, right?

225
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,248
That leaves us a minute
and 40 seconds to fill.

226
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,088
Well, did anything new
come in on the feeds?

227
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,441
Yeah, you got
Chrysler laying off 5,000.

228
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,400
A train off the tracks
in India, 60 dead.

229
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,880
And a bunch of whales stuck
in the ice in the North Pole.

230
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,324
Whales.

231
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,240
Brokaw's a sucker
for those stories.

232
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,324
Wait, wait, wait, but
show me how you got that.

233
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,526
It's easy.

234
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,968
If 26 is less or
equal to three-x plus one,

235
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,445
I just use the additive...

236
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,766
Adam, listening?

237
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,160
Yep.

238
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,607
<i>It also means
hot dogs.</i>

239
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,291
<i>Specifically, Deener's Weiners.</i>

240
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,721
<i>A MacArthur Park institution
for over 50 years.</i>

241
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,847
You like her.

242
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,127
What? No, I don't.

243
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,527
Well, I like her.
She's hot.

244
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,841
Okay, don't you have to go?

245
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,167
No.

246
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,401
Yes, I think you do.

247
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,164
I think you're supposed to
be at a dance thing.

248
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,480
It's so boring.

249
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,647
It's also tradition

250
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,161
and your grandfather's going to
kill me if you miss it, so...

251
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,806
So? It's not like I'm gonna
be here when I grow up.

252
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,365
I don't want to be here.

253
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,841
I want to be out there,
like you.

254
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,010
Can you believe that she was
in a tiny little news station

255
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,361
in Lawrence, Kansas,
like, four years ago?

256
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,524
Yeah, you like her.
Holy crap!

257
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,922
Whoa! What did I say about the language?
Holy crap!

258
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,446
<i>In Northern Alaska,
winter comes very early,</i>

259
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,841
<i>and for three
California gray whales,</i>

260
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,803

too early this year.</i>

<i>Adam Carlson reports from the most
northern point of the United States.</i>

262
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,041
<i>I'm standing out on
this frozen landscape</i>

263
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,522
<i>where we recently discovered a
tragedy unfolding here in Barrow.</i>

264
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,166
<i>Ice is freezing
the Beaufort Sea,</i>

265
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,402
<i>more quickly than usual
for this time of year.</i>

266
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,403
<i>And three gray whales,</i>

267
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,323
<i>two adults and their baby,</i>

268
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,166
<i>are now trapped within a wall
of ice, six inches thick.</i>

269
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,210
<i>According to Pat Lafayette
of Alaska Wildlife Management,</i>

270
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,928
<i>these gray whales were to have already
begun their annual migration south.</i>

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,528
<i>It's a 5, 000-mile journey that takes
them down the coast of North America</i>

272
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,122
<i>to a lagoon in Baja, Mexico,
where they breed.</i>

273
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,646
<i>These three whales
were certainly not expecting</i>

274
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,690
<i>to be imprisoned
in an Arctic dungeon.</i>

275
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,684
<i>A gray whale's head, unlike
the stout bowhead whale,</i>

276
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,808
<i>is too soft to
break through the ice</i>

277
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,087
<i>and it's beginning
to take its toll.</i>

278
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,403
<i>Cuts and bruises are now visible
each time the whales surface.</i>

279
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,126
<i>But for these three,
there is no choice.</i>

280
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,842
<i>It's either continue fighting to
keep the hole open, or drown.</i>

281
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,447
<i>Both experts here give the whales
a slim chance of survival.</i>

282
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,725
Good morning, Greenpeace.

283
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,644
Dave, those whales are dead if I don't
get some help. Okay?

284
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,881
Greenpeace Headquarters,
Anchorage

285
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,201
There's the quote for your paper.
I gotta go.

286
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,127
Hello.

287
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,204
<i>RUTH: I know how you
can free those whales.</i>

288
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,925
Who is this?

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,883
<i>I'm a friend of the whales.</i>

290
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,443
<i>In Prudhoe Bay,

291
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,131
<i>that belongs
to Alaska Northern Oil.</i>

292
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,288
<i>It was built to
break through the ice,</i>

293
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,041
<i>and trust me,
it's exactly what you need.</i>

294
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,647
<i>You just have to get the National
Guard to supply a helicopter</i>

295
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,200
<i>to tow it
from Prudhoe to Barrow.</i>

296
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,248
How do you know all of this?

297
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,923
I have very good connections.

298
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,924
PORTER:
Where the hell are we?

299
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,088
Brokaw and his damn whales!

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,886
"All raw whale and seal meat

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,971
"must be stored in leak-proof

302
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,000
You know, I think they got a
sign like that in Disneyland.

303
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,167
Did you find the bathroom?

304
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,930
Yeah. Two Porta-Johns.

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,369
One with a broken door.
One with a frozen lid.

306
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,209
Oh, God!

307
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,845
Boulder, Colorado

308
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,689
RUTH: She called you?
Interesting.

309
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,131
I'll tell you something, Ruth.

310
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,202
That woman has got
a hell of a big pair

311
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,766
thinking that
she can ask me for help

312
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,161
after the way she
embarrassed me like that.

313
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,130
I mean, she's nuts if she thinks
I'm going to let some hippies

314
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,204
use my barge to
save a bunch of whales!

315
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,606
Thank you.

316
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,366
Is Barrow near that Arctic wildlife
reserve you're always going on about?

317
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,323
That place
you want to drill so bad?

318
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,730
That's a whole other fight.

319
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,162
She's got her tree-hugger buddies in
Washington killing me on that one, too.

320
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,290
You know, I spent a fortune and I still
can't get the votes I need to drill.

321
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,165
Can you imagine what those people would
think if you saved those whales?

322
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,730
Yeah, right.

323
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,848
If we started
hugging trees, too.

324
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,285
I'll tell you what it would do.

325
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,525
It would make it a whole lot harder to make
me look like the bad guy all the time.

326
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,080
Honey, how much could it cost
to move one silly little barge?

327
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,362
Well, I'll tell you. Twenty
or thirty grand, probably.

328
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,963
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Sorry.

329
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,769
Yeah, Bobby,
I just changed my mind.

330
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,565
Tell the witch
she can use my barge.

331
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,284
Right. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Listen, have
the girls put out a press release

332
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,371
saying that we're even going to spring
for the gas for the helicopters.

333
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,090
All right?

334
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,129
NATHAN: You did that story on
Hurricane Gilbert last month.

335
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,241
STU: Yeah.

336
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,731
Adam and I watched
every second of that.

337
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,881
Really?

338
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,566
Yeah, we got all the
feeds at the TV station.

339
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,086
Hey, how did they get
that killer facility

340
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,810
all the way out to
a place like this?

341
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,126
Welcome to Barrow.

342
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,369
You have a $400-million high
school next to a $400 house.

343
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,601
Did you get the tapes?

344
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,761
Oh, no.

345
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,406
I don't know how you do it.

346
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,807
I'm not from here.
I'm down in Anchorage.

347
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,570
I would love to get to
the lower 48, though.

348
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,642
It involves El Niño,
if you can believe that.

349
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,603
That's amazing.

350
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,806
With the whale story
heating up,

351
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,651
maybe you guys could take
a look at my reel, or...

352
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,207
I don't think he's going to recommend
anybody who can steal his job.

353
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,128
What the hell?

354
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,763
Yeah, those things are like
twigs out in this temperature.

355
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,247
I keep some
extras in the trunk.

356
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,606
NATHAN: I'll get them.

357
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,007
Cw!

358
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,807
Ow.

359
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,330
Could you get me some coffee?

360
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,169
Maybe some hot coffee.

361
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,283
<i>Time and hope appear
to be running out...</i>

362
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,407
It's on! It's on!

363
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,289
<i>for three California gray
whales that have been trapped</i>

364
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,330
<i>for more than a week in the
thickening ice of the Arctic Ocean.</i>

365
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,289
Hey, what's happening?

366
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,282
<i>PORTER:
They are pathetic creatures.</i>

367
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,086
<i>One can hear the sound of panic
as they surface to breathe.</i>

368
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,766
<i>Temperatures
are well below zero.</i>

369
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,844
<i>The hole has gotten smaller,
the ice has gotten thicker.</i>

370
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,964
<i>The three whales
have nowhere to go.</i>

371
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,050
<i>It's five miles
from here to open water.</i>

372
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,687
<i>And they can't swim that far
underwater without breathing.</i>

373
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,044
<i>Groups like Greenpeace are scrambling
to figure out how to save the whales,</i>

374
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,166
<i>but the local Inupiat tribe is
considering an alternative plan.</i>

375
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,082
<i>Harvesting the whales for food.</i>

376
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,407
KABC Studios, Los Angeles

377
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,046
Okay. One last thing. This
whale story is heating up.

378
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,844
I need to send someone.

379
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,445
Don't everybody jump at once.

380
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,567
I'll go.

381
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,931
I've spoken to a marine
biologist about the situation

382
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,367
and I've already been in contact
with the mayor's office in Barrow.

383
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,207
Uh-huh. It's yours
if you want it, Wes.

384
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,443
Oh, it's a cat-in-a-tree.

385
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,081
I think I'll stick around here
and do the stories that matter.

386
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,044
Really, and what is it that
makes a story matter, Wes?

387
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,081
What makes a story matter
is that I cover it.

388
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,929
Now, if those whales go on a
killing spree, or run for office,

389
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,280
give me a call.

390
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,725
We've secured the hover barge

391
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,645
and now all we need is the
cooperation of the National Guard.

392
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,644
<i>But that has to come down
from the governor, and so far,</i>

393
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,451
<i>the governor has basically
turned his back on the whales.</i>

394
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,925
<i>Next question.</i>

395
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,407
I hate her so much.

396
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,327
And we will do everything we can
to help these poor creatures.

397
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,767
Yeah.

398
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,487
Nine. Ten.

399
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,607
Eagle River, Alaska

400
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,410
Eleven.

401
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,084
You got it.
Finish it, Boyer!

402
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,250
Colonel Boyer.

403
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,085
Yes, General.

404
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,044
Now, the ice-breaking
hover barge

405
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,442
is up in my Prudhoe Bay
drilling complex.

406
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,966
So, all you have to do
is hook a line to it,

407
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,482
take your chopper and pull
it across the ice here,

408
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,648
all the way up to Barrow.

409
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,489
It's 270 miles as a crow flies.

410
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,601
Right.

411
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,125
Are these whales
posing a threat to anyone?

412
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,440
How many lives are in danger?

413
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,602
None. Just the whales.

414
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,530
Are they at least
killer whales, sir?

415
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,965
Relax, Scotty.

416
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,804
This is purely
a PR thing on our end.

417
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,484
Right, yeah.
More like that.

418
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,728
Come on back here for a sec.

419
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,203
The pull
will take two days, max.

420
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,011
Maybe another day in Barrow,
breaking the ice.

421
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,122
You'll be home
before the weekend.

422
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,961
So, who am I taking my
orders from then, General?

423
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,165
We're all in this
together, Scotty.

424
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,891
Yeah. Look, Colonel,
hell, if it was up to me,

425
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,850
I'd drop a bunch of bombs
to break up the ice.

426
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,646
But the experts say that would kill
pretty much every other critter up there.

427
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,200
So, it's the hover barge.

428
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,164
The good news is that the pull
should be a piece of cake.

429
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,209
With all due respect,
Mr. McGraw,

430
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,526
nothing is that simple
in the Arctic.

431
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,563
That's why you're paying
high-school dropouts

432
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,722
$200,000 a year
to work your rigs up there.

433
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,687
Colonel, if J.W. says
it's doable, it's doable.

434
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,845
Yes, sir.

435
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,685
Good.

436
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,171
This is insane.

437
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,887
Hey, Pat.

438
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,047
Hi, Rachel.

439
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,167
Hi, Adam.

440
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,287
Hey.

441
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,964
I brought you something.

442
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,087
Oh...

443
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,771
It's a birthday present,

444
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,451
but you dumped me before I had
the chance to give it to you.

445
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,921
Well, that's not really what
happened, but thank you.

446
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,201
It's a robe.

447
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,805
Surprise!

448
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,281
I figured you could use something
up here to keep you warm.

449
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,447
Absolutely.

450
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,564
No. Thank you, this is
really sweet of you. Thanks.

451
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,564
So, what's your plan?

452
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,211
Stop the Inupiats.

453
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,327
Mmm-hmm.

454
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,325
Use the media to show the world
what heartless hunters they are.

455
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,085
Adam?
What?

456
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,730
Are you even listening to me?

457
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,161
Yes. Yes, I definitely am.

458
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,924
You know, the Inupiats
are very good people.

459
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,126
They're killers, Adam.

460
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,929
And I'm the only thing standing between
those whales and their harpoons.

461
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,081
But when I'm done,

462
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,607
the press is gonna want to
hang them from the rafters.

463
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,242
$0, happy birthday.

464
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,125
Five hundred a night?

465
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,281
Yep.
For this?

466
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,601
Yes.

467
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,523
Okay, I'll be with you
in one minute.

468
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,204
Excuse me,
are there any other hotels?

469
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,965
Nope.
Take it or leave it

470
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,807
Sorry, no credit cards.
Cash only.

471
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,283
Okay, can I help
whoever is next?

472
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,044
Right here.
I have cash.

473
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,531
This machine was built in 1970.

474
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,687
Prudhoe Bay, Alaska

475
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,881
The next year it enters
the record books,

476
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,531
making an ascent
straight up to 36,000 feet

477
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,687
in under six minutes.

478
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,486
That's a faster climb rate
than an F-14 Tomcat.

479
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,005
So, my old girl here
and her sister

480
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,361
will be pulling 75,000
pounds of hover barge

481
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,802
from here all the way to those three
whales stuck off Point Barrow.

482
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,451
Now, the hover barge
is 40 by 60 feet.

483
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,363
We have jet-fueled turbines.

484
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,041
These massive engines create
a cushion of air right here,

485
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,571
underneath the barge.

486
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,324
And this causes the hover barge

487
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,528
to liftoff
the ground four feet,

488
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,042
enabling us to move at will,
pulverizing any ice in our path.

489
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,207
How long do you...

490
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,527
I'm sorry, we're going to get back
to work now, if you don't mind.

491
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,880
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

492
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,490
Thanks, Colonel.
Thank you.

493
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,365
Thank you.

494
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,571
If you went back 10,000
years, our ancestors would be

495
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,048
mending their umiak frame

496
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,527
right here, just like this.

497
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,004
You know they have motor
boats now, right, Grandpa?

498
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,889
ADAM: Oh, boy.

499
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,809
Look what I got,
fresh off the cargo plane.

500
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,609
What?
What are they?

501
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,603
The next phase in your training.
Awesome.

502
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,048
<i>Def Leppard, Hysteria.
Rattle and Hum by U2.</i>

503
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,931
<i>And Guns N' Roses,
Appetite for Destruction.</i>

504
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,724
Wow! Thank you so much.

505
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,881
And for your Walkman.

506
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,201
Batteries. Yes.

507
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,522
I gotta go. I got batteries.
I'll be right back.

508
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,200
If we all got that excited
about batteries, right?

509
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,042
Hey, so you going to this Whaling
Captains meeting tonight?

510
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,931
Seems like there's a lot
riding on the outcome.

511
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,610
I put Roy in charge.

512
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,846
Roy?

513
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,890
Roy and Rachel,
that's going to get ugly.

514
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,201
Malik, you know there's a
lot of press here now.

515
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,760
And they don't
understand your people,

516
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,245
or what it takes
for you to survive.

517
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,562
We don't need them
to understand us.

518
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,404
You may need them
more than you think.

519
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,088
I have work to finish.

520
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,925
Okay.

521
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,971
Why won't you give us
a chance to get them out?

522
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,129
I have a barge
that's just days away,

523
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,562
but instead
you want to kill a family?

524
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,325
A baby, for God's sake!
For sport!

525
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,329
Hold on.
It's what I feed my family.

526
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,330
And it's what
we feed our babies.

527
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,001
The whale chooses the whaler
and they have chosen us.

528
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,009
The whale told you this?

529
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,360
Did it write you a letter?

530
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,321
"Dear Roy, I'd be honored if you
would drag me up to the beach,

531
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,885
"harpoon me
and slice me up."

532
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,166
Hold on, here.
Hold on.

533
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,327
"Best wishes, the whale."

534
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,521
No, no.

535
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,086
What you're saying
is ridiculous.

536
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,243
You're a white girl from out of town.
You don't belong here!

537
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,561
This is Inupiat country.

538
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,051
Roy, every Inupiat
gets a huge stipend

539
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,361
for the drilling rights
to the oil for their land.

540
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,005
You can buy all the
food that you want.

541
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,128
Rachel, we have to hunt!

542
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,964
One day,
that oil's going to run out,

543
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,369
and when it does,
the money will stop coming.

544
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,971
If we don't teach our children
how to feed themselves,

545
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,201
they're going to starve.

546
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,848
And who's going
to feed them then?

547
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,001
Are you?

548
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,367
Let's take
a five-minute break.

549
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,682
Hey, guys. Hey, guys.

550
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,286
Guys. Listen to
what I have to say.

551
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,807
You know the world has
gotten bigger for us.

552
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,930
And the outsiders
have taken away so much.

553
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,730
They move to our land.

554
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,167
They've even
changed our way of life.

555
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,641
But we still survive, right?

556
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,841
Right.

557
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,924
But if we give them pictures
of us killing those whales,

558
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,649
they could take away
our rights to hunt.

559
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,484
And that would be our end.

560
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,562
But maybe that's why
we need to fight them.

561
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,089
Make them understand that we
respect and honor whales.

562
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,806
That the ocean is our garden.

563
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,407
And that the whales
keep us alive.

564
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,726
All they will see is blood.

565
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,246
MALIK: May I have your
attention, please.

566
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,723
Attention, please.

567
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,288
The Whaling Captains
of Barrow have decided

568
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,930
we're going to help
free the whales!

569
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,165
Cardboard!
Get your cardboard!

570
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,689
Is this seat taken?

571
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,091
Oh, man. What am I going
to have this morning?

572
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,965
I usually do the Eight-Egg Breakfast
Burrito, which is fantastic,

573
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,046
but the Pile-o-Pancakes with a
side of ham steak is tempting.

574
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,041
What do you think I should get?

575
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,407
The name of
a good cardiologist.

576
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,521
Nice.

577
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,801
I'm Adam Carlson, by the way.

578
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,645
I've been working up here
for a few months and...

579
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,051
I broke the whale story.

580
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,520
So, you're the reason
we're all here.

581
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,125
Guilty as charged.

582
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,440
I'm Jill Jerard.

583
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,244
KABC, Los Angeles.
KABC, Los Angeles.

584
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,845
And before that, KPHX, Phoenix.

585
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,922
Yeah, how did you know...

586
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,769
I like to watch a lot of
feeds from around the world.

587
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,611
It's sort of a thing
that I do.

588
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,445
By the way, I loved that story
you had on the Olympian.

589
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,807
The javelin thrower
from Watts. Great!

590
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,961
Hey, Dana.

591
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,087
Do you know what you want?
You better hurry

592
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,969
because we're running
out of everything.

593
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,601
Yeah, what are you going to have?
That's it?

594
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,365
No, you gotta eat. We're gonna
have two number threes.

595
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,965
Thank you.

596
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,530
No, I'm on a very strict diet.

597
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,203
Fat ladies with oily skin don't
report the news in Los Angeles.

598
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,522
If you don't have
10,000 calories today,

599
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,965
you won't last
five minutes out there.

600
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,884
I won't eat 10,000
calories in a year.

601
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,286
And I don't have the cash.

602
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,084
It's fine. It's on me.

603
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,450
What was your name again?

604
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,764
JILL: And thank you again, Adam.

605
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,606
Yeah, absolutely.
Go get them today.

606
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,331
Yikes! What am I, your coach?

607
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,243
Just have a good day.
Okay.

608
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,767
Ride, 60 bucks!
Rides!

609
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,842
BOY: Cardboard!
Get your cardboard!

610
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,967
It's the best I could do.

611
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,087
It's okay. Thanks.

612
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,765
Let's find a ride.

613
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,246
Cardboard!
Get your cardboard!

614
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,366
Hey! You want to
buy some cardboard?

615
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,487
What?

616
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,846
Cardboard for sale.

617
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,206
Why would I need cardboard?

618
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,203
To stand on the ice.
$20.

619
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,361
20 bucks?

620
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,680
Yeah.

621
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,491
No, thanks, kid. This
is not my first rodeo.

622
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,289
Okay.

623
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,600
JILL: Adam?

624
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,681
Adam! Wait up!

625
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,681
Adam?

626
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,091
Hi.
Hey.

627
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,366
Do you have room for two more?

628
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,044
Yeah, we're good, right, Pat?
Sure.

629
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,565
Thank you.
Terry, load it in.

630
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,687
RACHEL:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

631
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,048
Press have to find
their own way out there.

632
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,770
Never heard that one before.
Did you just make that up?

633
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,810
No.
Everybody is doing it.

634
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,362
Come on, lady, help me out.
Do it for the whales.

635
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,723
You don't care about the whales.
You care about ratings.

636
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,929
Yeah, the ratings are what's
going to keep the rescue going

637
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,651
which is going to
save the whales.

638
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,165
She's right.

639
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,010
Rachel, I'd like
you to meet Fred.

640
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,331
Hi, Fred.

641
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,050
And Wilma.

642
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,165
Good morning, Wilma.

643
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,090
You're beautiful.

644
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,527
And this is Bamm-Bamm.

645
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,363
Hi, Bamm-Bamm.

646
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,811
Wait, isn't Pebbles
Fred and Wilma's kid?

647
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,884
Yeah, but Pebbles
was also a girl. So...

648
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,530
He looks hurt.

649
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,565
They've been taking
a beating out here.

650
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,405
Be careful!

651
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,167
Rachel...

652
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,123
Rachel... Rachel!

653
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,089
These guys have volunteered
to be out here

654
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,690
in conditions that no
one else would survive,

655
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,569
so just go easy.

656
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,804
Malik, you remember
Rachel Kramer.

657
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,120
Greenpeace.

658
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,440
Mmm-hmm.

659
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,125
How's it going?

660
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,641
They seem to be used
to the sound of the saw,

661
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,805
but the little one is having
trouble navigating now.

662
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,644
Sometimes hitting the side.

663
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,008
Well, has anyone
been down there yet?

664
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,923
No, and no one is
going to go down there.

665
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,047
Why not?

666
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,169
Because grays can take out
10,000-pound killer whales

667
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,561
with one swipe of their fluke
if they feel threatened.

668
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,766
It would be suicide.

669
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,844
Well, Pat, we have
a big, big problem.

670
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,203
<i>PORTER: Stretching for miles
and dropping like a wall</i>

671
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,443
<i>straight to the bottom of
the ocean, this massive ice</i>

672
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,127
<i>blocks any path the whales
might take to freedom.</i>

673
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,806
<i>An ice-blasting hover
barge is on the way,</i>

674
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,406
<i>but who knows
if it will get here in time</i>

675
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,201
<i>as this icy barrier,
known as a pressure ridge,</i>

676
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,770
<i>thickens by the hour.</i>

677
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,804
<i>Anticipating its arrival,</i>

678
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,680
Eskimo scouting teams are
anxiously looking for a weak spot

679
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,129
along this seemingly
impenetrable wall of ice.

680
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,805
Kelly Meyers.

681
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,323
Yes. I'll be right in.

682
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,881
Your whale story is
just reminding voters

683
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,247
that we've got a lousy
environmental record.

684
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,164
It's killing the Vice President
on the campaign trail.

685
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,686
Then helping these whales
might be our last best chance

686
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,569
to change
that perception around.

687
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,928
My job is to help
the VP get elected

688
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,529
while buffing our legacy to a mirror
shine before we leave office.

689
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,687
Right?

690
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,808
Do you really think that we can
get involved in this rescue,

691
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,609
make it a success
that we can sell,

692
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,331
and not do anything to
embarrass the President?

693
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,928
Yes, I do.

694
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,322
All right,
then get to it, Meyers.

695
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,926
Okay. All right.

696
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,171
What?
Colonel!

697
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,730
They need you inside!

698
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,126
The White House
is on the phone!

699
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,530
Tell them I'll call them back!

700
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,931
Sir?

701
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,249
Kid, I've got two helos about to pull
something bigger than my own house

702
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,091
that, if not done correctly,
sends me and the other chopper

703
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,090
spiraling to the ground
in stereophonic explosions.

704
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,965
Unless that's the President
himself, I got bigger fish to fry!

705
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,486
Take a number,
I'll call them back!

706
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,289
You ready to do this?

707
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,483
You were kidding about the
stereophonic explosion thing, right?

708
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,370
I'd say there's about a 60-40
chance that won't happen.

709
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,046
You want to find out?
Time to rock and roll.

710
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,926
MALE REPORTER:
It was predicted

711
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,527
the whales would not last
more than two days.

712
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,649
FEMALE REPORTER: The Eskimos have
set up a protective triangle

713
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,529
around the trapped whales.

714
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,206
At the ready with
their high-powered rifles

715
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,965
in case polar bears
decide to get too close.

716
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,163
Today, the rescue
continues in earnest,

717
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,086
amidst 20-below temperatures and...

718
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,844
Cut, cut.
God, my feet are numb.

719
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,284
These boots are useless.

720
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,410
Hey, kid?
Yeah?

721
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,925
You still got that cardboard?

722
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,850
I sold it to that guy.

723
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,003
But I can still get more.

724
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,605
All right.
Come here.

725
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,605
It's 40 now.

726
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,727
You're kidding.

727
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,326
Shipping and handling.

728
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,851
Shipping and...

729
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,603
And it's not
my first rodeo either.

730
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,726
I made another sale.

731
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,966
Nice one.

732
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,121
All right. Hot coffee.
Got to drink quick, though.

733
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,284
Thank you.
All right.

734
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,280
What are those guys doing?

735
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,485
Excuse me.

736
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,725
What are you doing?

737
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,404
You're not going down there.
You heard Pat.

738
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,527
It's too dangerous.

739
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,444
She's getting in.
Follow me.

740
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,885
Rachel...

741
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,922
You don't get a say
in what I do anymore.

742
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,206
Oh, that's very mature.

743
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,323
JILL: All right.
Is she in frame?

744
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,081
I'm just going to...
No, I'm not.

745
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,207
Great.

746
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,241
What's she doing?

747
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,401
Her job.

748
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,482
I like her makeup.

749
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,329
I'm pretty sure
it was tested on animals.

750
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,687
Okay, okay.
Will you just stop?

751
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,250
You don't even
have a safety diver.

752
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,243
Then I'm only
risking my own life.

753
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,606
There's a big surprise.

754
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,170
You don't listen to
what anybody else thinks.

755
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,004
You just do whatever
you want to do, right?

756
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,047
Yeah.

757
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,563
And you wonder why
we're not dating anymore.

758
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,526
Would you just wait a second?

759
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,841
Rachel? Rachel!

760
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,371
Damn it.

761
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,082
I knew something was wrong
with Bamm-Bamm.

762
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,606
And I told you not
to go in the water.

763
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,446
That was caught
around Bamm-Bamm's fluke.

764
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,602
It's probably
why Fred and Wilma

765
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,967
had to keep helping it
to the surface.

766
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,168
But netting from where?

767
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,523
Could have come
in from anywhere.

768
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,366
Those oceans are so polluted, I'm
shocked I didn't find an old tire

769
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,602
wrapped around one of its fins.

770
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,446
Maybe cutting him loose will
help him bounce back a little.

771
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,691
You're totally welcome,
by the way.

772
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,046
That's it.

773
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,727
Damn, this thing's a beast.

774
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,050
Believe me...

775
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,683
No, wait. Hold a second.
All right, ready?

776
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,048
Believe me, if the oil
were above the ground,

777
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,209
it'd make my life a whole
lot easier, but it's not.

778
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,443
But that does not mean we don't
care about God's creatures

779
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,881
just as much as anybody.

780
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,168
Yeah, that's good.
All right.

781
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,084
Hey, you make sure you
get lots of good footage

782
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,844
with me and those big fish.

783
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,890
I just bought us
a load of Super Bowl ads.

784
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,725
When the public sees
the Alaska Northern logo,

785
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,327
I want them thinking, "Friend
of the Environment," all right?

786
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,610
Last chance, cardboard?

787
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,489
No? Have a nice day.

788
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,726
Half price, only $10.

789
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,847
No, I'm okay.

790
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,967
Okay.

791
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,409
You look like you need a...
Mmm-mmm.

792
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,766
Okay.

793
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,008
I only sold a couple
of pieces, Grandpa.

794
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,246
And the people
are asking for them.

795
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,367
So, what's the big deal?

796
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,681
Come with me for a minute.
Okay?

797
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,847
Kneel down, right there.

798
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,007
What?

799
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,447
Kneel down right there.
Come on.

800
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,921
Put your ear on the ice.

801
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,365
Come on, listen.

802
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,450
You hear them?

803
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,970
The mother is speaking
to the little one.

804
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,845
Her calls are calm, gentle.

805
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,483
Soothing.

806
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,246
Do you hear her?

807
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,367
Mmm-hmm.

808
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,689
What do you think she is
trying to tell her baby?

809
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,370
What you said.

810
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,001
Excuse me!

811
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,243
I seem to have lost
three whales around here.

812
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,367
Anybody see them?

813
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,641
Anybody?

814
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,323
All right. Let's take
a look at these critters.

815
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,529
Hello, down there!

816
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,045
Anybody home?

817
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,203
Did you see that?

818
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,125
Do it again, I dare you!

819
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,887
And the plight of these whales
represents so much more

820
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,361
than them being
trapped in the ice.

821
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,651
Soon, the water itself is going
to be a threat to us all.

822
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,843
In 15 years, the biggest
business in the US

823
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,968
is going to be bottled water

824
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,725
because we're not going to
want to touch the tap stuff.

825
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,848
And enjoy your fish now

826
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,127
because soon
the mercury content

827
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,487
will make it
too dangerous to eat.

828
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,566
So, if you want tremors and
babies born with terrible...

829
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,127
What?

830
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,402
Congratulations, 10 million
people just changed the channel.

831
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,807
Well...

832
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,881
Come on, Rachel.

833
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,004
Nobody on the earth cares more
about these whales than you do.

834
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,641
So, tell people about it.
You were down there.

835
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,240
What's Bamm-Bamm like?

836
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,006
Or, to be honest, why do we care
about whales this much at all?

837
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,845
I mean, what if they were
deer or lizards or something?

838
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,323
Because even though they are
strong and big, and powerful,

839
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,767
they're vulnerable, too.

840
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,526
And it just makes you wish
that you were Superman,

841
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,850
and you could just scoop them up
and bring them somewhere safe.

842
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,770
And what's heartbreaking

843
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,527
is they know what's going on.

844
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,361
They know they're in trouble
and they're scared.

845
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,650
And we ache for them because
they're so much like us.

846
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,690
We get scared
and we're vulnerable,

847
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,849
and we need help
sometimes, too.

848
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,727
Better?

849
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,520
Much.

850
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,961
<i>Those three
California gray whales</i>

851
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,565
<i>trapped in
the Arctic ice off Alaska</i>

852
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,364
<i>are no nearer
to freedom tonight.</i>

853
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,641
I don't understand.

854
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,405
Can't you just patch me
through to the helicopter?

855
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,325
Okay, when he returns,
please have him call.

856
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,165
Thank you.

857
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,927
<i>The whales' only
real hope of escape</i>

858
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,641
<i>is the unusual hover barge
en route from Prudhoe Bay.</i>

859
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,923
<i>The size of a hockey rink,</i>

860
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,568
<i>the barge uses tons of compressed
air to push down the ice,</i>

861
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,921
<i>cracking, then demolishing it.</i>

862
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,250
<i>The hover barge is expected
to arrive in 48 hours.</i>

863
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,165
Colonel?

864
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,007
These are from the White House.
They need a progress report.

865
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,161
Great.

866
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,450
Now all I need is some
actual progress to report.

867
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,601
Kelly Meyers.

868
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,451
<i>Yes, ma'am, this is Colonel Scott
Boyer of the Alaska National Guard.</i>

869
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,085
<i>I'm told you called
a few times.</i>

870
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,440
Yeah, just a few.

871
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,201
Colonel, we'd like to set up a call
for you with the President tomorrow.

872
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,520
Yes, ma'am. The President?

873
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,366
It'll take just a couple of minutes.
He'll thank you for your work.

874
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,091
He'll reiterate the
administration's support, and...

875
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,810
I can't really
commit to a time.

876
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,486
You can't find five minutes for the
President of the United States?

877
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,409
I'm trying to crack
a pretty tough nut up here.

878
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,326
If I can nail down a time, I'll let
you know before 0900 Alaska Standard.

879
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,325
Okay.

880
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,321
Colonel Boyer.

881
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,487
<i>Are you always so formal?</i>

882
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,809
Do you know how to speak
like a normal person?

883
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,925
Like, when your mother asks you if
you liked the cookies that she sent,

884
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,331
do you say "Roger that"?

885
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,849
Damn, no, I'm sorry. I...

886
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,321
<i>It's okay to lighten
up a little bit.</i>

887
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,688
Here, why don't
we just start over?

888
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,006
Yes, ma 'am.

889
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,684
Hi, I'm Kelly.

890
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,490
Hi, I'm Colonel...

891
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,526
I'm Scott.

892
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,007
And I'm exhausted.

893
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,529
<i>The saga of the three whales
trapped by Arctic ice</i>

894
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,161
<i>and the heroic efforts of rescuers to
save them grew more desperate today.</i>

895
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,443
<i>FEMALE REPORTER: The whales are
fatigued by their efforts to survive,</i>

896
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,602
<i>and one of them,
the baby of the family,</i>

897
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,682
<i>affectionately
known as Bamm-Bamm,</i>

898
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,127
<i>may be seriously ill.</i>

899
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,371
You hear that?
It's not good.

900
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,848
Sounds like an old man.

901
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,565
Sounds like pneumonia.

902
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,650
Where is that damn barge?

903
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,641
Yes, I'm ready for the call.
Patch him through.

904
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,324
Your controls.

905
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,084
My controls.

906
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,408
Yes. Hello, Mr. President.

907
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,171
Yes, sir, it's going
very well, sir. Very well.

908
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,402
We're making steady progress.

909
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,526
Thank you, sir.

910
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,491
Just happy to be part of such
an important operation, sir.

911
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,931
Yes, sir.

912
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,766
Okay. Goodbye, Mr. President.

913
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,441
I just spoke
to President Reagan.

914
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,927
I noticed you didn't mention we've only
moved this freaking barge 20 feet.

915
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,284
My controls.

916
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,044
Your controls.

917
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,691
<i>MALE NEWSCASTER:
Today the whales' plight</i>

918
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,366
<i>officially became
a national affair.</i>

919
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,965
PRESIDENT REAGAN: We're
very proud of all of you

920
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,287
<i>and what you're doing up there.</i>

921
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,409
Nice job, Meyers.

922
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,968
<i>NEWSCASTER: Meanwhile,
the whales' situation</i>

923
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,890
<i>becomes more dire
with each passing day.</i>

924
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,769
<i>With weather conditions
deteriorating,</i>

925
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,563
<i>a brutal cold front could easily
seal their fate in a matter of days.</i>

926
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,486
<i>In Northern Alaska,
ice is always the enemy.</i>

927
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,210
It's a great idea.

928
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,482
No, it's not.
It's stupid.

929
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,564
Well, the people in
Barrow don't think so.

930
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,880
Minneapolis, Minnesota

931
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,962
Oh! You spoke with the
people in Barrow, did you?

932
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,082
Yes, I did, and they're
waiting for us.

933
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,487
This is ridiculous.

934
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,329
I don't even know why we're
having this conversation.

935
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,448
Why shouldn't we go?

936
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,487
Because

937
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,090
we got to pay
my father back the money

938
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,650
he loaned us
to build these things.

939
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,086
If I take off time from work to
go up to Alaska for some whales,

940
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,241
that ain't going to happen!

941
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,482
This whale thing could be the
publicity we've been looking for.

942
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,007
You know how well those things
worked up at Moose Lake.

943
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,321
They thawed Ed Maura's
party boat right out!

944
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,083
Give me a break, all right?
That's down here.

945
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,083
It's not up at the North
Pole, for Pete's sake.

946
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,164
Ice is ice, Dean.
This is our moment.

947
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,608
One day, I'm telling you, there is going
to be a plaque right up on that wall

948
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,684
reminding everyone that this
was the day we took our shot

949
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,201
and we showed the world what
the Hootkin 450 could do!

950
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,484
Hi! Are you the brave men
going up to save the whales?

951
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,805
Yes. Yes, we are.

952
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,130
That's not going to be enough.

953
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,440
Yikes.

954
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,121
I really have you up on the ropes,
and you come out with "soil."

955
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,282
I have to get
back out on the ice.

956
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,880
But first, I'm going
to clean your clock.

957
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,241
I got a news flash
for you, Cocky McGee.

958
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,641
I've been working on my
two-letter words, okay?

959
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,801
I'm dangerous.

960
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,524
Okay, I hate to do
it to you, but...

961
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,801
Oof!

962
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,321
"Zipper."

963
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,244
Triple-letter
and 38 points.

964
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,728
Oh, man!
You got to go.

965
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,251
Okay, hold on.

966
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,045
I got something for you.

967
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,167
What's this?

968
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,244
<i>Guns N' Roses, Sweet Child 0' Mine.
Play it for Bamm-Bamm.</i>

969
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,843
It sounds just like his mom, because
Axl Rose sings like a whale.

970
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,126
You know how he's like...

971
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,801
It's so high.

972
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,645
That's pretty true
to life, actually.

973
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,330
Thank you.

974
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,650
You really care about
those whales, don't you?

975
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,445
No, it's my grandfather
who worships them.

976
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,121
He has a whole bunch of prayers about
them and everything. It's weird.

977
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,651
So, what do you say?

978
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,368
Thirty bucks and I'll lend you the
magic of Guns N' Roses for 24 hours.

979
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,365
Okay, Gordon Gekko, we get it.
Nice try, though.

980
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,807
Do you know that when you don't
show up for your grandmother

981
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,001
I get in trouble?

982
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,485
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know that, right?

983
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,125
This woman has
a knife collection that...

984
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,401
I'll see you guys tomorrow?

985
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,720
ADAM:
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

986
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,961
Okay, bye

987
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,491
He really looks up to you.

988
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,805
Are you surprised?

989
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,481
He just needed a friend,
I think.

990
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,605
Plus, he's pretty cool.

991
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,284
And I'm pretty cool, so maybe
I just needed a friend.

992
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,328
You shouldn't let them
take advantage of you.

993
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,806
Who's that?

994
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,002
The reporters
you're sucking up to.

995
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,010
Well, I'm not...
Not sucking up.

996
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,367
Hey, you know what?

997
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,767
I'm not one of your endangered
critters that needs saving.

998
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,444
So, thanks, anyway.

999
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,727
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

1000
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,684
The temperature is dropping
so fast out there.

1001
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,321
You know what?

1002
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,889
My head just isn't in this, and
I should get back onto the ice.

1003
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,924
I thought you said everything
was taken care of!

1004
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,800
How was I supposed to know there is
only one place in this town to stay?

1005
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,487
I don't know, Karl, maybe pick
up a phone and call ahead, huh?

1006
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,727
The Greenpeace lady
from the TV!

1007
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,763
Come on, grab your
stuff there, Dean-o.

1008
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,968
You'll see everything's
going to be okay. Come on!

1009
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,646
All right, hold on, now.
Wait for me!

1010
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,006
Hey, lady!

1011
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,286
Hey!

1012
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,443
Hey, miss!
Greenpeace lady, miss!

1013
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,966
Wait, please, miss.

1014
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,929
I'm Karl. This is my
brother-in-law, Dean.

1015
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,170
We're up from the Twin Cities and
we brought the amazing De-lcers!

1016
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,807
What?

1017
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,281
It keeps the ice off your
boat when it's in dock.

1018
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,129
So, we figured you could

1019
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,043
use them to keep those whale
holes from freezing over.

1020
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,122
Yeah, you just give us the word
and we'll head out to the whales.

1021
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,326
You bet.

1022
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,244
Look, I'm sure that you think
your idea can help.

1023
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,482
By now, we've heard everything,

1024
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,642
but we've got it under control.

1025
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,491
Hold on a second, lady!

1026
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,642
So, you didn't know
we were coming?

1027
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,164
Sorry, no.

1028
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,323
Oh, my God.

1029
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,926
Malik!

1030
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,444
You need to see this!

1031
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,524
Festive.

1032
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,531
No, no, no.

1033
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,922
I am doing a really good job
and I'm not leaving

1034
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,123
just because now this is a
lead story, and you want it!

1035
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,208
You want to play in
the big leagues, Jill?

1036
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,123
Sometimes you have to
sit on the bench,

1037
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,720
and let the heavy hitters
bring it on home.

1038
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,643
There's a ticket waiting
for you at the airport.

1039
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,928
I'll be keeping
your cameraman with me.

1040
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,571
Good luck with
your "cat in a tree," Wes!

1041
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,641
Are you Mexican?

1042
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,569
Only at work.

1043
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,607
Son of a...

1044
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,121
I hope you fall into the
whale hole, you jackass.

1045
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,765
Pat, I'm just headed back now.

1046
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,843
I needed to see if you
needed anything from town.

1047
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,007
Over.

1048
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,970
No. We are in big trouble
out here, Rach.

1049
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,770
The temperature has dropped
through the floor.

1050
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,081
The guys can't keep
the hole open.

1051
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,606
<i>We can't keep up with the ice.
I think this is it.</i>

1052
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,841
What?

1053
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,965
You going to eat that
ja-lapeno?

1054
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,526
It's "jalapeño."

1055
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,369
You don't pronounce the

1056
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,851
Are you going to eat it?

1057
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,285
Why can't you admit
that you're a jerk?

1058
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,850
I'm a jerk? Why?

1059
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,001
Because!

1060
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,761
Hey.

1061
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,921
Do those things that you
brought here really work?

1062
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,041
Yeah.

1063
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,208
The Hootkin 450 will turn a
hockey rink into a swimming pool

1064
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,203
faster than you can say
"Minnesota North Stars!"

1065
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,691
Says so right on the box.

1066
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,001
Well, you guys
better not be lying.

1067
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,805
Come on!

1068
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,006
Hi.

1069
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,921
That's it?

1070
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,003
RACHEL:
That's our Hail Mary?

1071
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,082
It's a table fan and a box top!

1072
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,605
This table fan is your...

1073
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,723
Jeez, look at that.
Look at that whale.

1074
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,520
Don't worry about it, okay? These
things are going to work great!

1075
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,090
I hope.

1076
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,247
It's frozen.

1077
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:42,888
Thirty seconds on the ice
and it's already seized up!

1078
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,803
It's not a big deal. There are
plenty of great stories in LA.

1079
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,048
We don't do great stories!

1080
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,361
No one does.

1081
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,131
And no one would
watch them even if we did.

1082
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:03,081
Do you know that there are
at least 30 wars going on

1083
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,770
around the world, as we speak?

1084
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,325
Yeah.
Of course you don't.

1085
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,402
Because there are no reporters
there to tell you about them

1086
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,246
because they're all here
covering three stupid whales!

1087
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,003
Look at what
they've done to me.

1088
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:21,130
I'm just a smelly, drunk,

1089
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,330
depressed Barbie.

1090
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,329
No, no,
of course not. You...

1091
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,487
Do you know what?

1092
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,768
Maybe this is
my wake-up call.

1093
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,921
Okay.

1094
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,846
If this is what
reporting is all about,

1095
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,531
I don't want any part of it.

1096
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,285
What would you do?

1097
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,926
I don't know.
Maybe be a teacher.

1098
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,809
<i>Adam, it's Rachel. Come in.</i>

1099
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,371
Hey, Rachel,
can you give me a second?

1100
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,845
I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

1101
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,685
<i>Adam, we need a generator!</i>

1102
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,366
<i>There's got to be
one at your station.</i>

1103
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,887
<i>If we don't get it in the next few
minutes, the whales are dead.</i>

1104
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,883
<i>Now, start it up inside</i>

1105
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,204
<i>and keep it running until
you get to the SAR hangar.</i>

1106
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,725
<i>Adam, do you roger that?</i>

1107
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,450
Yeah, I got it.

1108
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,363
I'm just saying, grab a
camera and some equipment

1109
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,521
while you're in there.

1110
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,449
It'll take two seconds. I
need you to be my cameraman.

1111
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,050
Jill, this is about the whales.

1112
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,565
And, by the way, what happened
to your wake-up call?

1113
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,722
Five minutes ago, you were
going to be a school teacher.

1114
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,962
Since things have
slowed with the rescue...

1115
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,405
You're no different than I am.

1116
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,727
You want to move
up just as badly.

1117
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,564
This story is our chance, Adam.

1118
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,565
It fell into your lap, but it
landed you on national television!

1119
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,881
What's happening out there
on the ice right now, Adam,

1120
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,166
that's our story.

1121
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,004
No, it's everyone's story.

1122
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,721
Do you think that if they had the
scoop, they would give it to you?

1123
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,565
We are being handed the ticket
to where we both want to go.

1124
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,728
Don't throw it away.

1125
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,326
The people will spend the next
two months in total darkness.

1126
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,562
What happened?
What the hell?

1127
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,446
Okay.

1128
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,925
No way! There's about a million
FAA regs against that.

1129
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,286
Shut it off, or we don't go.

1130
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,289
It'll freeze.
This is the only way.

1131
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,609
Pat! We'll all be unconscious
in five minutes.

1132
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,210
That's not what you
want from your pilot.

1133
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,922
What if we just leave all the doors
open and let all the air out?

1134
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,765
You're joking, right?

1135
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,927
Fine!

1136
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,527
But there's a pretty good chance
we're going to freeze to death.

1137
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,087
Seventy below?
That can't be right.

1138
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,006
Feels pretty right.

1139
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,645
But wait,
if we're going 100 knots,

1140
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,643
then that makes our
wind chill at about...

1141
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,766
Are you all right?

1142
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,322
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

1143
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,082
My eye is frozen shut!

1144
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,084
What?
I can't see out of my eye!

1145
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,924
What do I do?

1146
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,368
I have a pocket knife. I could
cut it open, like in <i>Rocky.</i>

1147
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,925
No! No cutting
or ripping!

1148
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,288
Okay, okay, Okay

1149
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:36,525
Okay, you know what?
Just keep her steady.

1150
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,365
What are you doing?

1151
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,441
I'm going to lick your eye!

1152
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,849
Nobody's licking my eye!

1153
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,047
Listen to me!
No!

1154
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,207
Stay calm!
No!

1155
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,601
You're not going
to lick my eye!

1156
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,646
Yeah?
Yeah.

1157
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,801
Yeah?
Yeah!

1158
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,166
All right!

1159
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,289
Now whatever you do,
you don't blink!

1160
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,891
Yeah!

1161
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,649
That got a little weird!

1162
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,846
Whoo!

1163
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,166
Oh, God.

1164
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,685
RACHEL: You got it?

1165
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,567
Let's go to the other
side of the ice.

1166
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,728
Get the shot looking back.

1167
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,041
Right here.

1168
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,683
In three, two...

1169
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,886
Okay.

1170
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,760
The temperature, minus 50.
The situation, critical.

1171
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,771
The three mighty leviathans,
a family on the brink.

1172
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,770
With ice,
aggressive and merciless,

1173
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,930
easily outpacing the heroic
rescuers struggling to clear it,

1174
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,886
their only hope now,
one last ditch effort

1175
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,606
by two mystery men
from Minnesota

1176
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,882
and their homemade
de-icing machines.

1177
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,041
You ready?

1178
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,201
Yeah!

1179
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,567
It's safe, right? They're not
going to get electrocuted?

1180
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,406
Good question.

1181
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,807
Okay.

1182
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,530
Yeah.

1183
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,325
Is this going to work?

1184
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,802
Hell if I know, Rachel.

1185
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,084
I'll take
the Breakfast Burrito.

1186
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,084
All right. That will come with
a side of reindeer sausage.

1187
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,241
Mine won't.

1188
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,401
Okay.

1189
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,000
<i>J I LL:
From panicked to playful.</i>

1190
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,488
<i>The hum of motors
inside these strange boxes</i>

1191
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,689
<i>is the sound of salvation.</i>

1192
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,689
<i>For, in dramatic fashion,</i>

1193
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,610
<i>these odd machines have
turned what might have been</i>

1194
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:25,969
<i>a dark, watery Arctic grave
into a bubbling Jacuzzi.</i>

1195
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,362
How the hell did
they get that story?

1196
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,644
<i>This is Jill Jerard with Adam
Carlson, Barrow, Alaska.</i>

1197
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:37,882
Well, I was just doing my job, but
I'm glad that you enjoyed it, Ed.

1198
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,802
Peter Jennings said that?

1199
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,047
It's going national.

1200
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,281
Yes, sir.

1201
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,727
He is. He's right here.

1202
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,685
My producer
wants to talk to you.

1203
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,725
Adam Carlson.

1204
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,885
Thank you, sir.

1205
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,531
Well, we were...

1206
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,965
I've actually been
in Alaska for four years, now.

1207
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,530
Before that, I...

1208
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,401
Yes.

1209
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,682
I would absolutely
love to send you my reel.

1210
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,411
Thank you, sir.

1211
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,046
Yeah.

1212
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,325
Thank“.

1213
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,921
Oh, my God.

1214
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,411
We make a pretty good team.

1215
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,086
I think we do.
I think we do.

1216
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,763
My absolute favorite whale
is the mommy, Wilma,

1217
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,090
because she's a gentle mommy that loves
and cares for her cute little baby.

1218
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,771
And that must mean
she has a big heart.

1219
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,084
She also has big lungs.

1220
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,931
I mean, look how long
she can stay underwater.

1221
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,889
And she's huge!

1222
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,601
I hope they make it to freedom.

1223
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,926
Thank you, Shayna,

1224
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,850
for the seventh report
about the whales today.

1225
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,446
Who would like to talk about
something else?

1226
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,361
All right.

1227
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,442
Who wants to do the next
report on the whales?

1228
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,403
<i>Who will win in Alaska,
the ice or the whales?</i>

1229
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,444
<i>Experts now fear
for Bamm-Bamm...</i>

1230
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,801
You have a phone call,
Mr. McGraw.

1231
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,126
Here we go.

1232
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,730
Thank you.

1233
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,641
Hey.

1234
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,886
McGraw.

1235
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,563
Hello, Colonel.
How are you doing?

1236
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,246
We're all waiting
for you up here.

1237
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,130
It What?

1238
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,165
<i>GARY SHEPPARD:
We have just received news</i>

1239
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,931
<i>that the hover barge will
not be arriving in Barrow.</i>

1240
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,650
<i>Not now, not ever.</i>

1241
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,644
<i>The massive craft careened
into an Arctic pothole,</i>

1242
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,928
<i>even bigger
than the barge itself,</i>

1243
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,482
<i>nearly causing a midair collision
between the two sky cranes</i>

1244
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,846
<i>tasked with pulling it.</i>

1245
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,405
Colonel, why didn't
you tell the President

1246
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,006
how badly the rescue was
going when he called?

1247
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,844
Did you deliberately mislead
your Commander in Chief?

1248
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,849
Ma'am, we took on
a monumental challenge

1249
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,450
in a difficult
work environment.

1250
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,170
Our immediate goal was the
delivery of the barge

1251
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,004
and now it's obvious
that we lost that battle.

1252
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,849
But there's still
a mission to complete.

1253
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:10,367
The National Guard isn't going to stop
fighting until those whales are free.

1254
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,606
Thank you.

1255
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,041
We all tried our hardest.
I'm proud of you guys.

1256
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,764
I want you to clear out.

1257
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,320
Go find yourself some chow.
Thank you, gentlemen.

1258
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,522
Those guys set me up.

1259
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,486
This is the worst day
of my life!

1260
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,886
You know, they can take
that out of your pay.

1261
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,041
Kelly?

1262
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,571
I was in the neighborhood.

1263
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,880
If I'd known
you were this pretty,

1264
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,846
I would have returned that first
phone call of yours right away.

1265
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:01,081
So, does my Commander in Chief
have a Plan B, by any chance?

1266
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,721
I was hoping
you'd have one for us.

1267
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,247
MALIK: We need to make a
path out to the open water.

1268
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,761
Otherwise, the whales
will die here waiting.

1269
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,326
Let's start cutting
holes every 60 feet.

1270
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,085
ROY: But what makes you think
they're going to follow our path?

1271
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,845
MALIK: We have no choice
but to try.

1272
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,451
<i>JILL: The struggle to save three
gray whales took an unexpected turn</i>

1273
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,211
<i>as local Eskimos
began the daunting task</i>

1274
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,205
<i>of cutting a path of breathing
holes, five miles long.</i>

1275
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,887
<i>Their hope, to lure
the whales to open water.</i>

1276
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,645
<i>There appears to be no other
option for the trapped whales</i>

1277
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,924
<i>and to many, the Eskimos'
audacious plan seems insane.</i>

1278
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,408
But with a few chainsaws
and a prayer,

1279
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:10,042
hopefully, these three unfortunate
giants will be free again soon.

1280
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,487
Mr. President, I was
assured by Alaska Northern

1281
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,329
that the barge
was a viable option.

1282
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,886
We're doing all we can to minimize
your exposure on this thing.

1283
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,086
Uh-huh.

1284
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,323
Sir, the press has been all over
us about some Soviet icebreaker.

1285
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,487
We told them
it's a no-go.

1286
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,489
No, maybe we should
consider it.

1287
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,843
Gorbachev's been telling us to
trust him on this glasnost thing.

1288
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,325
This might be
a good first step.

1289
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,004
Well, I like
Mr. Gorbachev

1290
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,010
but I am not ready to
play the trust card.

1291
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,326
Not for this.

1292
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,410
Gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me, please.

1293
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,691
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1294
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,326
<i>the President
of the United States.</i>

1295
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,806
USSR Admiral Arsenyev,
Bering Sea

1296
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,763
<i>The only available icebreaker
within navigable distance</i>

1297
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,444
<i>belongs to the Soviets.</i>

1298
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,921
<i>The Presidential candidates
are weighing an opinion.</i>

1299
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,128
<i>The Dukakis camp is giving indications
that this is a perfect...</i>

1300
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,368
How much you want to bet
they'll call?

1301
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:05,681
How much?

1302
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,521
Fifty rubles.

1303
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,881
A hundred...

1304
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,691
and bubble gum.

1305
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,201
Bubble gum it is.

1306
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,406
Why aren't they moving?

1307
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,727
MALIK: They can't leave
until the baby's better.

1308
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,846
The US Government
is not going to let

1309
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,321
a Russian icebreaker
come and save the day.

1310
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,481
Neither am I.

1311
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,085
Who knows
if they would even come?

1312
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:02,322
Please, they'd all come for the same
reasons that you're doing this.

1313
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,765
Good PR.

1314
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,684
Excuse me, young lady,
but this is no PR stunt.

1315
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,321
I'm in for $2 million
for gas and equipment.

1316
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,046
And I care about those whales,
just as much as you do.

1317
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,445
Maybe even more so.

1318
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,010
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

1319
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,208
It means that J.W.
is spending his money,

1320
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,520
while you're making it
hand over fist.

1321
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,125
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.

1322
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,762
Don't act like you're not
piling up on the donations.

1323
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,531
Well, we're going to
need every penny

1324
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,045
to fight what you and your boss

1325
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,885
have done to the environment
over the last eight years.

1326
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,450
Excuse me, I couldn't hear you

1327
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,201
over the sound of the booming
economy and massive job creation.

1328
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,930
At the expense
of everything else.

1329
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,441
Okay. All right.

1330
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,971
RACHEL: And that's why
you're here, right?

1331
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,969
To erase the embarrassing parts

1332
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,721
of your record that's not playing
out too well on the campaign trail.

1333
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,044
No, she's here to represent the
President of the United States

1334
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,121
and so am I.

1335
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,881
And if Washington puts a little extra
funding in your budget as a thank you...

1336
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,486
I'd be careful
if I were you, miss.

1337
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,961
Guys? Guys, the whales. Let's
get back to the whales.

1338
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,889
That's why we're here.

1339
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,571
It sounds like the only viable
option is to call in the Soviets.

1340
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,721
No. No, it's not!

1341
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,565
I cannot recommend
that to the President.

1342
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,721
J.W.:
It's not going to work.

1343
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,491
You think I like
calling the Soviets?

1344
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,683
They're some of the worst
whalers in the world.

1345
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,161
And now they're
going to come in here

1346
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,089
and look like
environmental heroes.

1347
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,606
But, as much as we hate it,

1348
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,001
Greenpeace is willing to shut
our mouths and let them.

1349
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,167
Well, I'm not.

1350
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:35,449
I'll be damned if I'm going to let those
Reds come in here and save the day.

1351
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,601
It's not going to happen!

1352
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,125
KELLY; That's right.

1353
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,488
Then those whales
are going to die.

1354
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,286
Right there in
front of the cameras.

1355
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,931
And when
the weeping schoolchildren

1356
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,369
and the heartsick men and women of this
country look for someone to blame...

1357
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,802
And they always do, right?

1358
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,522
They're going to ask the nice,
trustworthy lady at Greenpeace.

1359
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,050
And I'm going to tell them that

1360
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,043
Ronald Reagan
killed those whales.

1361
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,365
Goodbye legacy.

1362
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,369
Goodbye George Bush election.

1363
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,206
Goodbye to everything that
you three came here to do.

1364
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,888
Can you recommend
that to the President?

1365
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,251
Gorby, it's Ronny.

1366
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,887
Capitan.

1367
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,560
Vladivostok Base to
icebreaker Admiral Arsenyev.

1368
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,842
Stand by to receive
transmission of new orders...

1369
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,685
Steer course to 160.

1370
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,929
You know this could end
very badly.

1371
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,763
The sea is freezing over.
If we don't act fast...

1372
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,925
we're going to be trapped
with those whales.

1373
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,771
<i>A theme that dominated today's
episode of the trapped whales</i>

1374
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,291
<i>was
"The Russians are coming."</i>

1375
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,528
<i>And now the Soviet Union
has actively joined the effort</i>

1376
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,126
<i>to save the whales still
trapped in the ice off Alaska.</i>

1377
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,208
<i>Tonight, there's a new twist
to this drama.</i>

1378
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,363
<i>The Soviet Navy is now sending
reinforcements to help the Americans...</i>

1379
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:20,445
<i>The stage now is set for a climax
to this long suspense story.</i>

1380
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,121
<i>Everyone involved seems to be
planning for one final push</i>

1381
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,446
<i>no matter what it costs.</i>

1382
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,206
<i>PORTER: The Soviet
Icebreaker hopes to vanquish</i>

1383
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:31,045
<i>the massive pressure ridge
at the ocean's edge.</i>

1384
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,441
<i>The ship can't go any further</i>

1385
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,888
<i>as the shallow depths would
cause it to run aground.</i>

1386
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,281
<i>The burden of getting
the whales to the ridge</i>

1387
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,570
<i>falls to a cock-eyed coalition of
whale hunters and whale lovers</i>

1388
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,041
<i>who must carve
a path in record-time</i>

1389
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,600
<i>and pray
the whales follow their lead.</i>

1390
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:55,567
I think it's very courageous of the
Gipper to extend his hand to the Soviets

1391
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,650
and let them
help out like this.

1392
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,721
That's all.

1393
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:04,001
Anyway, we got five miles of holes
to cut, so we can't waste any time.

1394
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,565
By God, we can do it.

1395
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,324
It's do or die!

1396
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,250
It's bottom
of the ninth!

1397
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,163
It's fourth and goal! Right?

1398
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,682
It's down by two and one
second on the clock!

1399
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,529
That's what it is. It's like,
you know, one minute...

1400
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,525
Just give him a cheer
so we can get on with it.

1401
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,364
Exactly. Exactly.

1402
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,687
Guardsmen, we're on the move!

1403
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,524
J.W.:
Come on! Let's go!

1404
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,210
Come on! That's it.

1405
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,369
It's going to be okay,
Bamm-Bamm.

1406
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,970
The ice-smashing
cold war comrades

1407
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,726
will arrive within a day,
but won't stay long

1408
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,650
as the brutal
Beaufort Sea's frozen waters

1409
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,848
will soon become impassable.

1410
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:18,490
The Red rescuers will have
just one Hail Mary shot

1411
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,369
at breaking through
the pressure ridge.

1412
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,364
Wait. What's happening?

1413
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,601
What are they upset about?

1414
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,087
I think they're
getting ready to move.

1415
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,927
They are moving.

1416
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,127
Okay.

1417
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,605
Dean, Karl, de-icers! Let's go!
As quickly as possible!

1418
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,360
Ease back, everybody.
Do not crowd the holes!

1419
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,090
J.W.:
Which one is it?

1420
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,086
Bamm-Bamm?
Where's Bamm-Bamm?

1421
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,089
He's not coming up.

1422
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,765
Where is he?

1423
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,409
He's just a baby and he's confused.
He'll come up.

1424
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,448
Pat, I don't see him.

1425
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,169
Just give him a minute.

1426
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,122
I don't see him.
He's always right here.

1427
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,328
He's down here.
Where is he?

1428
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,804
He's gone.

1429
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,646
What?

1430
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,485
The other two
were protecting him,

1431
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:16,324
but he could no longer hold on.

1432
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,201
Bamm-Bamm is dead.

1433
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,367
No.

1434
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,685
Come on. Come on, surface.

1435
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,323
Come on, Bamm-Bamm.

1436
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,924
No, he's going to come up.

1437
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,530
Oh, my God.

1438
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,530
Oh, my God.

1439
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,721
On me in three, two, one.
Adam, where you going?

1440
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,644
He's going to come up.

1441
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,564
Come on, Bamm-Bamm, surface.

1442
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,490
It's our job
to report the story,

1443
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,721
not become
emotionally involved.

1444
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,888
Pick up the camera, let's go!

1445
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,687
Come on, Bamm-Bamm.
Surface.

1446
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,407
We can't let him die.
We can't!

1447
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,090
We should have started earlier.

1448
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,202
We didn't do enough.
No, no, no.

1449
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,208
This is nobody's fault.

1450
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:21,644
Listen, there are going
to be things that happen

1451
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,570
that neither you or anyone
else can do anything about.

1452
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,810
You got to stop.

1453
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,607
Just stop fighting.

1454
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,402
That baby is gone.

1455
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,088
And you can't change that.

1456
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,090
Amen.

1457
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,605
ALL: Amen.

1458
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,003
<i>One of three whales trapped in
the ice near Barrow, Alaska,</i>

1459
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,003
<i>has not surfaced
since yesterday.</i>

1460
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,523
<i>SHEPPARD: The whale, nicknamed
Bamm-Bamm, is now presumed dead.</i>

1461
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,047
<i>Rescuers say Bamm-Bamm's
mother and father</i>

1462
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,165
<i>refused to leave their baby's
side, until the very end.</i>

1463
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,646
To the little one.

1464
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,605
Whoa, whoa!

1465
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,570
Miss Kramer?
Excuse me.

1466
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,402
Ma'am, I know how much you
wanted to save that baby.

1467
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,325
And him dying, I'd be lying if I
told you it didn't hurt like hell.

1468
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,250
But I just want you to know

1469
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:21,450
that we all give you the lion's
share of credit around here.

1470
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,761
Because if it weren't for you,

1471
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,764
all three of those whales
would be dead now.

1472
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,648
And I promise you we're going
to save the other two,

1473
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,683
no matter what it takes.

1474
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,841
You're not as easy
to hate as I thought.

1475
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,530
Neither are you.

1476
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,245
Still doesn't change
the way I feel

1477
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,450
about you trying to open up the
Arctic Wildlife Refuge for drilling.

1478
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,281
Young lady, it doesn't change
how I feel about it, either.

1479
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,004
The clock continues
to tick down

1480
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:20,402
as crews furiously work to cut
a path to the open ocean.

1481
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,484
A herculean task...

1482
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,923
Cut. Arnold, you have to
hold the camera straight.

1483
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,571
The camera's facing the ground.
You got to keep it up.

1484
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,250
I'm sorry.
Let's go again.

1485
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,766
<i>MALE NEWSCASTER: If the whales or the
Soviets don't arrive at the exact...</i>

1486
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,366
<i>The town of
Barrow has shut down</i>

1487
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,682
<i>as schoolchildren
and shopkeepers alike</i>

1488
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,686
<i>answer the call to help out on
the ice in any way they can.</i>

1489
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,001
<i>Those not cutting holes are
providing hot food and coffee.</i>

1490
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,168
with the Soviets
racing across the sea...

1491
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,887
the whales are now
within a mile of the ridge.

1492
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,729
This is hole 425!

1493
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,929
That's over 30 holes an
hour, in one solid day.

1494
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,530
It's incredible!

1495
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,726
We really did it.

1496
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,524
They could've told us
it was so big.

1497
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,322
Maybe this wasn't
such a great idea.

1498
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,809
Slow ahead 10 knots.

1499
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,281
Very well.

1500
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,960
That's big.

1501
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,205
It hardly made a dent.

1502
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,403
Let's go again.

1503
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,681
Stand by.

1504
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,841
Attention.

1505
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:40,322
<i>Attention. This is
Icebreaker Admiral Arsenyev.</i>

1506
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,801
<i>The ship is going
to hit the ice again.</i>

1507
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,247
<i>Everybody move away
from the ridge.</i>

1508
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,647
<i>Please move back, everyone.</i>

1509
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,200
Fall back, men.
Fall back!

1510
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,767
Stop engine.

1511
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,449
They're swimming away!

1512
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,645
It's the vibration!

1513
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,125
Oh, no. No!

1514
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,487
Stop!

1515
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,289
No, no, no!

1516
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,050
There's nowhere
left for them to go!

1517
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,645
The old holes are frozen over!

1518
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,130
Come back!

1519
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,801
We could have
structural damage.

1520
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:09,961
We go again.

1521
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,087
No. It's too dangerous.

1522
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:18,609
They've been under
there too long, Rachel.

1523
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,805
We did enough.

1524
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,401
30 knots.

1525
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:26,847
Full ahead.

1526
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,004
Oh, my Lord.
That Ruskie's crazy.

1527
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,569
J.W.:
Careful. Careful.

1528
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,010
Do you see them?

1529
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,931
Come on, you bastards, surface!

1530
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,167
Fred.

1531
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,368
You know what?
I'm going to miss them.

1532
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,451
<i>NATHAN:
After the rescue,</i>

1533
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,444
<i>everyone from the outside left
our little edge of the world</i>

1534
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,727
<i>and went on with their lives.</i>

1535
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,888
<i>Mr. McGraw used his
new eco-friendly reputation</i>

1536
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,800
<i>to land one of the biggest
contracts in Alaskan history</i>

1537
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,962
<i>cleaning up all that crude oil</i>

1538

<i>spilled by the Exxon Valdez.</i>

1539
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:10,563
To the Valdez,
the gift that keeps on giving.

1540
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,769
Two out of three...
...Arctic whales agree.

1541
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,046
Nothing could be nicer...

1542
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,685
than a Hootkin brand
De-lcer.

1543
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,843
<i>Karl and Dean became local
celebrities back in Minnesota</i>

1544
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,127
<i>and their de-icer business
took off.</i>

1545
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,248
It's Arctic-proven,
don't you know?

1546
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,849
<i>Colonel Boyer and Kelly
Meyers fell in love.</i>

1547
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,969
<i>They got married
on August 12th, 1989.</i>

1548
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,965
<i>And they spent their entire
honeymoon down in Baja,</i>

1549
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,088
<i>watching the whales.</i>

1550
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,044
<i>It only took
three more stations,</i>

1551
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:42,329
<i>but Jill Jerard finally made
it to a national news network.</i>

1552
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,046
<i>So, Joey,
you've denied the affair.</i>

1553
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:48,529
<i>You say Amy Fisher
was just obsessed with you.</i>

1554
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:52,446
<i>Mary Jo, are there doubts in
your mind about Joey's claim?</i>

1555
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,648
<i>NATHAN: Thanks to Fred,
Wilma and Bamm-Bamm,</i>

1556

<i>Greenpeace membership
increased by over 400%.</i>

1557
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,524
Go easy on the copy
machine because,

1558
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,728
after all, it's being
held up by duct tape.

1559
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,401
Is everything okay?

1560
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,527
Yeah.

1561
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,762
I thought you were supposed to be
at a job interview in Pittsburgh.

1562
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,083
I canceled it. I had
something else I had to do.

1563
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,325
I don't like the robe.

1564
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:21,967
Okay.

1565
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,201
See, I knew I was going
to hurt your feelings.

1566
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,647
No, honesty is important.

1567
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,807
Good, because honestly,

1568
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,084
you drive me crazy.

1569
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,321
And...

1570
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,809
I can't imagine
my life without you.

1571
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,246
<i>NATHAN: Adam got offers
from all over the lower 48,</i>

1572
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,243
<i>but he turned them down

1573
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,606
<i>He told me,</i>

01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,564
<i>"The biggest stories happen
in the least likely places."</i>

1575

<i>Not just Iditarod

1577
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,646
<i>Right. There was some good
college basketball today.</i>

1578
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,131
<i>I'm going to
show you highlights,</i>

1579
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,611

all about that, next.</i>

1580
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,205
<i>Stay right there.</i>

1581
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,170
MALIK'S WIFE: Nathan?
Yeah.

1582
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,444
<i>Me and my grandfather spend
a lot of time together now.</i>

1583

<i>He and the rest of my people</i>

01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:20,364
<i>never stopped laughing at the huge
fuss the crazy outsiders made.</i>

1585
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:23,923
<i>But sometimes,
I think about the whales</i>

1586
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:26,771
<i>and that hole in the ice
where we first found them,</i>

1587
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:29,571
<i>and how it kept
getting bigger and bigger</i>

1588
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:32,041
<i>until it let
the whole world in.</i>

1589
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,087
<i>It happens every so often,
an animal's dilemma</i>

1590
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,084
<i>captures the public imagination
and continues to hold onto it.</i>

1591

<i>Those three
California gray whales</i>

1592
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:59,849
<i>trapped in
the Arctic ice off Alaska...</i>

<i>We bid the value of all the
wildlife you're putting at risk.</i>

1594

<i>And since you've
refused to read them,</i>

1595
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,330
<i>we'll go ahead and
read them for you.</i>

<i>MALE REPORTER: What is it

<i>to do all of this work?</i>

1598
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,163
<i>I think it's the same
as with most people</i>

1599

1600

can open that hole up for them."</i>

1601
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:24,727
<i>Well, the purpose was
to keep the water open</i>

1602
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,411
<i>and it almost looks like we've
got something else going here.</i>

1603
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,562

to really like them.</i>

1604

<i>That must make you
feel very good.</i>

1605
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,851
<i>Yes, it does.</i>

1606
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:39,685

is a real long shot, you know.</i>

1607

1614
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,202
