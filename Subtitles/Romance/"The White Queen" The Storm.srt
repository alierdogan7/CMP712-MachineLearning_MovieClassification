1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,080
'I here present unto you, Queen
Elizabeth, your undoubted queen.'

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,320
We'll have no truck with a queen
who thought to rule her husband

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,640
and rule England through him.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,600
My Lords! Our one-time king, Henry,
and now, our prisoner.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,640
Your father is asking
King Edward for the royal dukes,

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,040
his brothers, to be given
in marriage to the two of you.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,200
Give him something. But not this.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,160
Warwick has betrayed me!
And so has George!

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,640
For now I hear he has married
Isabel against my clear command!

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,200
My wedding was never for me at all.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,000
It was a sign from Father that men
should rise against the King.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,280
You will be
King Henry Tudor of England.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Ignore what your mother just
said, Henry, for it is treason

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
and she would surely lose
her head for it.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,640
Our father...and John...
they're dead.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,400
There was no charge,
only the word of Warwick.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,120
He's done it. Father has the King!

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick.
I curse you.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,000
By my will, you shall die.

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,120
There is no word?

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,360
Anthony and Richard have ridden
north to test support for Warwick.

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,760
They may just be captured and meet
the same fate as John and Father.

23
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,640
Please, Elizabeth, don't even
say that! How can I help it?

24
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,760
Mad King Henry
is safe and in comfort

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,240
but what are they doing to Edward?

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,920
What are they doing to him,
right now, Mother, as I stand here?

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,600
I need him back with me.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,240
(Sssh...sssh... I know.)

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,560
"Advise me", Warwick?!

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,720
Not lock me up or take away
my throne,

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,800
but, no, you would "advise me"?!
Edward, the council feels...

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,760
No, it doesn't!

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,720
The council feels nothing
but what you tell it,

34
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,760
and you will turn them against me!

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,360
Edward, all we ask is that you
take back your old advisors

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,040
and dismiss the Rivers family.
Which you know I will never do!

37
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,960
So, the game is that you make
demands on me

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,960
you know I cannot agree to, and use
that as your excuse to keep me here

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,080
while George rules in my place!

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,080
But really, you rule through him.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
Edward! The loyalty
that we had to...

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,240
No! I am "Your Grace" to you,
cousin!

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,400
The Lord's anointed king
and ruler of this kingdom!

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,600
And Your Grace needs to understand
that this is a betrayal

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,680
and that the Queen's family...
Are loyal to me!

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,360
Which is more than can
be said for you and George.

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,120
Now, where is the Queen

48
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,160
because if you have harmed
a single hair upon her head...

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,600
She would have likely sent
the Devil down upon me!

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,080
But she is barricaded in the Tower.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,160
Now that, dear cousin,

52
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,840
is treason!

53
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,400
HE SIGHS

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
As is this.

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,560
But, if I must hold court
at Warwick Castle,

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,800
then you may bring me some venison
and some small ale

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,680
so I may eat at your expense
as I run my kingdom!

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
Is that clear to you?

59
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,040
DOG YELPS
Ssh...

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,160
Yes, and bring me brother George
as I have words to say to him.

61
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,600
DOG BARKS AND YELPS

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,120
Ah! Brother George's
new wife, Isabel,

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,120
married without my consent.
(Would you get them in there?)

64
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,280
I do hope you're not expecting
loyalty from him!

65
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,400
Will you get them in there! Go, go!
EDWARD LAUGHS

66
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,920
She's not bled yet?

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,640
She's with child.

68
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,880
A wedding night child
shows we have God's blessing.

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,560
Is it a boy?
I... How would I know, Father?

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,320
I have called a Parliament at York

71
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,640
where we will proclaim George
the king and Isabel his queen.

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,640
But, Father! I cannot! Be quiet,
Isabel! It may as well be over with.

73
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,440
He knows full well what we're doing.
You cannot turn back now.

74
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,400
You must stay your course
come hell or glory.

75
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,840
But Parliament will never agree!
They must!

76
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,200
The Rivers woman is so hated.

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
She has pushed aside your father

78
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,480
and every other noble advisor
England ever had.

79
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,360
And in their place, put scum. You
will not question me. Now get out!

80
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,440
(You may question him when you
are queen... You may do then!)

81
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,160
Husband?

82
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,440
I have word from Jasper Tudor!

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,880
Jasper says that Parliament
is sitting at York

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,200
and they will decide what
to do with Edward!

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,640
They should just cut his head off.

86
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,200
Is that what you'd do, Margaret?
Take a man's life so readily? Hmm?

87
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,560
He has gone against his rightful
king and God. My Lord. Thank you.

88
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,360
I would do it myself
if I were a man.

89
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,320
I would do it myself anyway,
as Joan of Arc would have done.

90
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Perhaps we should be grateful that
it's not your choice to make.

91
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,040
It is not I who choose it,
but the Lord.

92
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,240
He tells me of his will
and I carry out his work.

93
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,520
He has ruled Edward
should lose the throne,

94
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240
and soon, he will reveal
the way my son shall come upon it.

95
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,640
Or rather, you will decree

96
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,160
whatever action that you take
to be God's will!

97
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,440
Jasper understands all of this.
I did not imagine that you would!

98
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,160
Ah, yes, Jasper Tudor.

99
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Does he share your blood-lust too,
Margaret?

100
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,240
Would he lop off the head of
a king ordained by God?

101
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,120
Jasper and I are one in all things.

102
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,360
No, not all, Margaret.
You're not married to Jasper Tudor.

103
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,600
You are married to me.

104
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
George!

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,640
You coward! Come and face
me like a man!

106
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,960
Don't hide behind our cousin,
George!

107
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,640
Does our mother know about this?!
Damn you, Edward!

108
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,920
I'll not allow that witch
upon the throne,

109
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,360
and you've been no king since you
first dipped your wick in her!

110
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,080
George?
Off to Parliament, Warwick,

111
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,640
to try and force the crown
on George's head?!

112
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,680
Issy!
Look what they have sent for you!

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
It is her coronation furs.
Elizabeth's!

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,760
They have taken them
from the Palace of Westminster!

115
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,920
They still smell of her perfume.

116
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,720
Only kings and queens
may wear this fur!

117
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,440
You shall be queen, Issy.

118
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,400
Aren't you happy?!

119
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,040
Father has done this for you,
Isabel.

120
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,800
If he had done it for me,
I'd be the happiest girl in England.

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,320
There are two queens already, Annie.

122
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,000
One is in exile the other
is cowering in the Tower

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,600
with a price upon her head.
I would be the third queen.

124
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,640
So, what if Father turns against us
as he's done both the others?!

125
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,560
He will not turn against you.

126
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,640
You are carrying the prince,
his grandson.

127
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,200
There is no-one else for Father now.

128
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,640
We all said that Edward
was the rightful king.

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,240
We said that he
was the Flower of York

130
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,680
and we would walk in the sweet
garden of England with him.

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,600
We danced at her coronation.
We said that we loved her.

132
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,720
You and I never said that, Issy,

133
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,320
we did not like her.

134
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,160
Not ever.

135
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,320
Father says we must think of her
as our enemy and so we must.

136
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,160
Look how beautiful this is.

137
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,840
Remember when we used
to play at being queen?

138
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,800
Well, you can be queen in real life.
I don't want to be queen, Annie.

139
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,880
I thought that this marriage
was for me. But it's not.

140
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
It's all for them.

141
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,040
We are their pieces
on a board, Annie.

142
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,880
And marriage is a wretched thing.

143
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
It's not like it is for her.

144
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,280
We'll never be who she is.

145
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,040
We'll never have what she has.

146
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,080
My Lords!
Parliament is called to order.

147
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,680
MUSIC DROWNS SPEECH

148
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,880
INDISTINCT MURMURING

149
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,600
..I shall be a strong leader.
The whole country behind me...

150
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,960
INAUDIBLE

151
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,680
INAUDIBLE

152
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,360
INDISTINCT

153
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,280
..To turn against your own brother.
The throne has the rightful king.

154
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,320
No crown, George?

155
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
You clearly couldn't
command Parliament.

156
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,040
So, you must let me go,
or you must kill me.

157
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,800
Because there is no other
end to this.

158
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
George... George!

159
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,360
BOTH BREATHE HEAVILY

160
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,480
Take it off!

161
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,200
I SAID, "TAKE IT OFF"!

162
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,280
George will not be king.
Parliament would not agree.

163
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,080
Your father has risked everything,
and he has lost.

164
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,360
He has lost.

165
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,320
SHE GASPS

166
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,840
DOOR OPENS

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,640
(Elizabeth!)

168
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,720
Welcome home. King Edward!
King Edward!

169
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,880
They lost their nerve.

170
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,080
George said he would behead me,
but of course, he would not dare.

171
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,240
Not even Warwick has
the stomach for that!

172
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
He thought I was still that boy
that he could control.

173
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,960
He tried to make me give you up
but I told him

174
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,680
that I would happily stay
in his house for ever,

175
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,040
but never would
I give up my wife nor who I am.

176
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,200
They are fools to think it.
So, he just released you?

177
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,960
Parliament wouldn't declare
for George and make him king,

178
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,760
so if Edward wouldn't abdicate
and they wouldn't kill him...

179
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,200
Warwick let me out for exercise,
so he could save his pride.

180
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
But really, he just let him go.

181
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,960
And now he will be sorry.

182
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,800
You know about my brother John,
and Father?

183
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,880
So, they will pay for it.

184
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,640
You won't like it, but they won't.

185
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,800
We must have peace, Elizabeth.

186
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,920
And I was a fool not to see
that I had shut Lord Warwick out.

187
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,720
But he knows that he has lost

188
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,960
and he will beg for my forgiveness
as will George.

189
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,120
You must not give it! I will.

190
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,920
They are my brother and my cousin.

191
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,040
And this country cannot
stand another war,

192
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
especially one within this family.

193
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,920
And I will make Warwick's nephew
Duke of Bedford.

194
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,280
My first husband's title?

195
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,280
He's Warwick's heir and I must give
him some stake in staying loyal.

196
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,200
He is a traitor.

197
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,640
I don't care what his nephew gets,
as long as you execute Warwick!

198
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,560
I can't, my love. And I won't.

199
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,480
And what is more, I will
give our daughter, Elizabeth,

200
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,280
to young Bedford in marriage
to make that alliance firm.

201
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,880
Over my dead body!

202
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,600
We must. For then even Warwick
will have a chance of his blood

203
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,520
being on the throne one day and
he will not come against me again.

204
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,880
I swear to you that she will never
marry Warwick's nephew.

205
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Then forgive me for being worried
out of my wits about you

206
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,400
and trying to keep you safe!

207
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,920
But they would have murdered YOU.

208
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,960
So while I am King of England,
I shall give my daughter in marriage

209
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,200
to anybody I please, and no-one,
including you, shall stop me!

210
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,200
(Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

211
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,960
(Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven...)

212
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,480
I am no longer the King's Sheriff.

213
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,120
And I've been passed over
for my family title by him.

214
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,560
Yes, that's right, the King is free.

215
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,200
And he regrets to inform me

216
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,560
that you and Jasper Tudor wrote
to his brother George

217
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,400
and offered your support.

218
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,920
So my younger brother John
becomes the Earl of Wiltshire

219
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,760
which should have come to me.

220
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,880
For all your hopes of greatness,
you have hurt only yourself

221
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,280
and you will only ever be
Lady Stafford.

222
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,600
I hope that you're happy.

223
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,960
You will write no more letters.

224
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,880
You will write to no-one at all.
Especially Jasper Tudor.

225
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,880
And if I find that you have
I shall take away your books,

226
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,920
your freedoms and your visits to
your son. Is that clear, Margaret?

227
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,160

She will still hate us.
Because of Father.

Maybe with them close to us

and my brother who were innocent
of any crime in all their lives

It was NOT war.

This was no honourable death
on a battlefield.

253
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,920
It was murder.

254
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,160
And it was treason
in the eyes of God and man.

to be butchered by your axe.

Another one of us returned to court!

281
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,800
My dear son, George, invited me,

282
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,400
to share his joy
that he is soon to have an heir.

283
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,520
Seems the force that had me
exiled from the court

284
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,480
has lost its power
and Edward is a man again.

285
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,800
He has always been a man.

286
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,360
But it seems that that is not enough

287
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
to win the loyalty of those
who are supposed to love him.

288
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,200
Sister.

00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,080

make you sick.

or his son, Edward,

295
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,680
or my brother, George.

296
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,160
Or, God forbid, Margaret
Beaufort's son, Henry Tudor,

297
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,320

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,000
..will never betray me again.

348
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,920
BELLS TOLL IN DISTANCE

349
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,920
CHILDREN CHATTER CLOSE BY

350
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,400
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

351
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,880
My Lady?

352
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,080
What do you mean,
"another uprising"?

353
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,320
In favour of witless old Henry.

354
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,520
With a leader
who will not announce his name.

355
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,880
A leader with no name? I do not see.

356
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,840
He may be a herald
to Margaret of Anjou,

357
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,280
testing how much support she can
raise before she lands her troops

358
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,640
to free her husband,
so I will make quick work of him.

359
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,160
Can someone else not lead the army?

360
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,440
No, it is my crown.
I must defend it.

361
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,640
I must put my neck on the line
with the men who love me.

362
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,160
Edward, please, don't go.

363
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm with child again.

364
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,000
And this time I'm SURE it's a boy.

365
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,160
BOTH CHUCKLE

366
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,360
Oh, I knew it! That's the best news
you could give me!

367
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,960
How are you so sure it's a boy?

368
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,280
Would you pry into
a woman's mysteries?

369
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,280
No, I would not.

370
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,240
Then, please, stay.
This time, to protect us both?

371
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,040
It is all the more reason
I must defend my crown

372
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,600
for my son to inherit.

373
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,240
My prince...

374
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,120
we will call Edward.

375
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,640
Edward.
SHE CHUCKLES

376
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,240
What about your faithful cousin
Warwick and loyal George?

377
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,720
Will they ride with you?

378
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,560
Hah! My little queen of mistrust,

379
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,200
Warwick is in the north
raising men for me as we speak.

380
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,440
And George will be by my side.
In body perhaps, but not in spirit.

381
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,760
They have promised me their loyalty,
Elizabeth. Truly you must trust me.

382
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,120
I will be home with you by
May Day morning

383
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,880
with peaches and salt cod,
for you and my prince, Edward.

384
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,200
Annie, feel! He's excited.

385
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,640
He is strong! Or she is.

386
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,520
Father, what is it?
A rebellion. Against the King.

387
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,160
BELLS TOLL

388
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,840
Jasper! Jasper!

389
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,680
My Lady Margaret.

390
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,000
You haven't written.

391
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,400
My husband has forbidden me.
What is it?

392
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,520
There is an uprising.
Our time has come at last!

393
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,160
BOTH LAUGH

394
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,400
Queen Margaret is sailing?

395
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,480
She is in Calais and will sail once
Edward is engaged in battle.

396
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,560
Oxford brings 10,000 men from
the south, and I have half of Wales.

397
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,280
So, you must arm your tenants
and go. The tide is turning.

398
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,080
It is our moment.

399
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,280
I won't ride out.

400
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,040
And I shall send no-one. What?

401
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,600
These wars have taken too
many men already.

402
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,880
I've lost a brother
and a father to this cause,

403
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,520
and still, it is not won.
I, too, have lost my kinsmen...

404
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,440
and that is exactly
why we must fight on,

405
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,400
so that their sacrifice
is not for nothing.

406
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,640
If we rise up now as one,
we can unseat this York usurper

407
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,760
and return the throne to Lancaster!

408
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,240
Until the next time.
And the next time.

409
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,000
Does King Henry even know that
this war is being fought?!

410
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,080
He barely even knows his name.

411
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,040
And Edward is the better king.

412
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,760
The roads are safe, the nobles'
private armies are disbanded

413
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,120
and brigands have been brought
to justice.
Perhaps that is what matters.

414
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,480
What matters is God's rightful
king upon the throne!

415
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,240
Or do you abandon the Lord
as well as your House?

416
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,880
Oh, no!
Edward is also anointed by God.

417
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,320
So, how should we know which one
to pick?!

418
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,560
Perhaps God is confused
and doesn't know himself?

419
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,080
And now you blaspheme and blame
almighty God for your own shame!?

420
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,320
You are a coward and you fear
for your own neck like a child!

421
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,440
And I ask God, every day, why
I must be married to such a man!

422
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,400
Enough, Margaret! Enough!
No. No, it is not enough!

423
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,360
It is not!

424
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,880
How can I live
with such bitter shame?

425
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,400
I am sorry for you.

426
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,720
He has no backbone and no loyalty.

427
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,120
We will defeat them without him.

428
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,440
I only wish I could ride
with you and fight myself.

429
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,840
You have the courage of any man.

430
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,080
You're a soldier.

431
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,720
Margaret.

432
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,680
The uprising is not called
by Margaret of Anjou.

433
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,600
It is stirred by Warwick
and George, Duke of Clarence.

434
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
What do you mean?

435
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,720
George has written that he will
return your son his title,

436
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,640
if we bring men to the field
to fight Edward.

437
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,440
It's a trick to lure Edward
into battle. Once he is engaged,

438
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,000
Warwick and George will turn
their armies on him and kill him.

439
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
They need us there
to work the deception.

440
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,280
That's why I need Stafford's men.
They'll put George on the throne?!

441
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,840
Yes, but George is weak and greedy

442
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,920
and men will quickly tire of him.

443
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,640
When they do, they will turn
to Lancaster.

444
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,440
Then we'll make
a chance for your boy.

445
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,480
I will go to my brother, Welles, and
ask him to raise an army for you.

446
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,920
He will do it
if he thinks it is for Lancaster.

447
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,680
Jasper, take this...

448
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,760
..and know that...I'm with you.

449
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,160
Oh, no, Mother, no!
SHE SOBS

450
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,200
I don't want to be the queen!

451
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,360
I only want my baby!

452
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,160
Why must Father do it?

453
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,080
I do not know why he must.
He is possessed with it.

454
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,240
He risks his life and fortune
and the safety of all four of us.

455
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,480
He says that Edward is not
a king for England.

456
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,040
He's only for the Rivers family.
Oh, Mother! No!

457
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,160
He says that he did not fight
this long

458
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,920
to put Edward's cat's-paw
of a wife upon the throne.
SHE SOBS

459
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,320
Stop bleating, Isabel! Be quiet.

460
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,560
We must support him.

461
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,880
We must, all of us, stand with him

462
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,360
and just pray to God
he is successful in this venture.

463
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
God help us all if he is not.

464
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,600
My Lord.

465
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,960
I owe you an apology.

466
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,920
I spoke to you very wrongly today.
I beg your forgiveness.

467
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,320
What did you give Jasper Tudor?

468
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,200
A necklace.

469
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,680
He gave it to me when
I left Pembroke.

470
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,040
I should not have kept
a trinket from another man.

471
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,200
God has given me a sign that I must
be a good and loyal wife to you.

472
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,400
I wish to make amends.

473
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
And to my mother, also.

474
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,600
Will you take me to see my mother?

475
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,840
So I may show contrition?

476
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,600
Very well.

477
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,600
HORSES APPROACHING

478
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,760
To what do I owe SUCH an honour?

479
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,120
Mwah.

480
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,280
Welles!

481
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,920
Margaret. Lord Stafford.

482
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,680
Richard, will you pray with me?

483
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,680
Richard, I have something
to tell you.

484
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,240
Something wonderful.

485
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,760
God has commanded the nobles
of England to fight his holy war,

486
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,240
to strike down this pretender,
Edward,

487
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,120
who took the throne from his
own righteous king, Henry.

488
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,240
Richard, God has spoken to me...

489
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,680
..of you!

490
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,480
Yes, Richard, you are special,
and you are to do God's work.

491
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,280
What would he have me do?
You are to lead his blessed crusade.

492
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,880
You are to summon the army

493
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,200
that will cast this wicked Edward
from God's throne.

494
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,200
But I have...not ever...
fought in battle!

495
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,840
I do not even know...

496
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,520
Sssh...sssh...sssh...sssh...

497
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,120
All you must do is bring the army.
God will do the rest.

498
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,600
When he does, he will place a new
Lancastrian king upon the throne,

499
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,200
and where do you think
he will look for that king,

500
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,160
if you have led his House
of Lancaster to victory?

501
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,480
Dear God,

502
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,360
please, watch over Edward
in this battle that is coming.

503
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,960
Strike down Edward's enemies

504
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,560
and keep him safe in your love.

505
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,880
Lord, we pray for our father,
for success in his endeavours.

506
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,400
And that he knows what he is doing
and it is your will.

507
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,760
I pray for my husband.

508
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,240
That he comes home safe to me

509
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,800
and for the safety of my baby.

510
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,840
Bring my Lord Warwick
success against his enemies.

511
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,080
Almighty God, strike down Edward
of York in this battle.

512
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,600
Strike down this wicked usurper who
has taken the rightful king's crown.

513
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,880
Bring victory to my brother
and to Jasper Tudor,

514
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,960
who fight for you on the side
of Lancaster.

515
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,200
Please, God, let Edward win.

516
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,720
Let him live.

517
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,480
Please, God, let Edward lose.

518
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,240
Let him die.

519
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,120
Let us hope it is as easy
as they promise.

520
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,600
"Easy"?

521
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,480
Warwick and the Duke of Clarence
will turn on Edward

522
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,040
and kill him in the battle.

523
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,400
We are just here to lure him
to the field.

524
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,720
But... My sister said...

525
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,720
But why would Warwick and the Duke
of Clarence be on our side?

526
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,000
Oh, believe me, they're not!

527
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,640
They will make George the king
if all this goes well.

528
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,240
But... And if it does not...

529
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,240
..then we will all die
a traitor's death

530
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,520
and have our guts spread
outside Westminster.

531
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,200
But... I thought this was God's holy
war to return Lancaster to victory?

532
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,520
Get some sleep.

533
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,960
Your part's nearly over.

534
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,160
God is not to save me?

535
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,320
'God is not to save me?
Is not to save me...'

536
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,920
HE PANTS

537
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,600
SWORDS SCRAPE
In the King's name, stop! Guards!

538
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,880
I need to see the King!

539
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,040
Please!

540
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,520
Edward! There is a plot to kill you.

541
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,840
It is Warwick
and the Duke of Clarence!

542
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,760
They mean to turn on you
in the battle.

543
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,720
Please, Edward...

544
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,280
HE GRUNTS, WET DRIPPING

545
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,040
Traitor...

546
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,320
WET GURGLING

547
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,560
HE GASPS

548
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,360
SCREAMING CLOSE BY

549
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,680
No! No!

550
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,360
No! No, not my boy!

551
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,920
SHE WAILS

552
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,600
My boy is dead! Lady Beauchamp?
My boy is dead!

553
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Lady Beauchamp, I'm so sorry...
Why did he go?! Why did he go?!

554
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,000
Why did he do it? My boy is dead...
SHE SOBS

555
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,840
They failed, then?
Edward is not dead?

556
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,800
Go inside.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

557
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,120
How could God allow this?

558
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,760
Why...why...why did he...
SOBBING

559
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,040
Edward is safe, but it was
all a trap as I feared!

560
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,000
Warwick and George have fled and
Edward is in pursuit.

561
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,520
He knows they would
have murdered him in cold blood!

562
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,440
He murdered Welles who'd only come
to tell him of a plot against him.

563
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,040
He is no longer the Golden Boy of
York. No-one will trust him again.

564
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,600
What should he care? He should care,

565
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,040
because now the Beaufort family
is in mourning

566
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,760
for their kinsman, Welles. Edward
has given his enemies a new cause.

567
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,280
Oh, Richard! My darling boy...

568
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,520
He was a traitor. He betrayed his
House of Lancaster to Edward.

569
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,320
For goodness' sake, Margaret,
the boy is dead.

570
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,040
She does not care, she has no heart!
And she is cursed!

571
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,560
It seems to me it is YOU
who is cursed, Mother,

572
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,200
for you gave birth to a traitor.
Enough, Margaret! That is enough.

573
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,760
HOOFBEATS APPROACH

574
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,080
Jasper! Jasper's fled!

575
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,560
The King will hunt him down and kill
him, so he's fled to France.

576
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,840
We have to fetch Henry!

577
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,120
As soon as it is safe to do so.

578
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,560
No, no...
Jasper bids me fetch him now.

579
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,000
Jasper's judgment is not the best,

580
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,960
as perhaps you can now see,
since his cause is lost.

581
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,680
He's running for his life to France,
leaving little Henry
with no guardian.

582
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,480
He has no choice! He chose to fight
the King. This is the outcome.

583
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,000
I will fetch the boy.

584
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,600
I will come too.
He is my son. I am not afraid.

585
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,400
I will do as you say
if there are soldiers on the road.

586
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,000
I beg you. I beg you. Please.

587
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,600
Very well, Margaret.

588
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Perhaps now you'll understand
your mother's grief.

589
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,680
SHE GASPS AND PANTS

590
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,600
I have a pain.

591
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,560
Every time he moves or turns.

592
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,440
I cannot breathe.

593
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,960
Issy!

594
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,080
Father?!

595
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,040
We failed!

596
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,360
We did not "fail", we retreated!

597
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,760
Our error was to trust in Lancaster,
the Beaufort boy betrayed us.

598
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,240
The rightful king is George of York!

599
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,840
And we shall see him anointed
on the throne! God save King George!

600
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,000
King George!

601
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,360
Now, we'll sail to Calais
and raise an army.

602
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,320
We are at war with so-called
"King Edward".

603
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,560
Father, I cannot sail!

604
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,000
I am in my confinement...

605
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,360
Father?!

606
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,600
Warwick and George
are sailing for Calais

607
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,160
and they will bring
the English Garrison against us!

608
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,800
Anthony has ridden to try and stop
them but he may not be in time.

609
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,080
We must act, Mother. Elizabeth.

610
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,280
They killed your husband and your
son. And they have gone unpunished!

611
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,760
WIND HOWLS

612

We were discovered!

619
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,200
Anthony Rivers rode like a madman

620
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,120
and captured
our fleet at Southampton.

621
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,760
I'll have his head for that!
We sail for Calais! Now!

Midnight knows
there's something wrong.

624
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,400
Don't be silly, Issy.
He's just being naughty.

625
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,120
He doesn't want to go.

626
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,680
Edward is after us! Get on board!
Issy is afraid, Father.

627
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,200
Come on!

628
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,520
See... He's on board now.

629
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,680
You can sleep and we'll be there
in no time, you'll see.

There's a storm brewing.

The wind's picking up.

639
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,520

Father says we will run
for the French shore

658
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,680
and take the shelter of the coast.

659
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,440

What are you doing down here?
Has my son been born?

668
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,640
We need linen, rags! Anything!

669
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,520
And a spoon for Issy to bite on.
In the galley.

670
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,160
And give her this.
God knows she'll need it.

Once the magic is out,
you cannot call it back,

Where is my Uncle Jasper?
He is with you?

I'm Lady Margaret.

I've come to take you home.
I'm safe, thank you, my Lady.

I'm waiting for my Uncle Jasper,
so I cannot leave.

He's seeing to it, so you,
you may stay inside. You...you...

692
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,640
He does not want to come.

693
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,280
He does not know me.

694
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,480
He is Jasper's boy
through and through.

695
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,640
And now, you'll make him yours.

696
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,160
SHE GROANS

697
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,360
Lady Mother, what is happening?
Why doesn't the baby come?

698
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,320
It's stuck inside her.
She needs a midwife to turn it.

699
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,800
Go ask your father how long
before we reach Calais!

700
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,200
SHE GRUNTS

701
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,160
SHE YELLS

702
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,560
Father? Isabel needs a midwife.

703
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,320
Mother asks how soon we shall be in
Calais? We're sailing into her now.

704
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,680
Isabel shall see the best
physician in France.

705
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,960
METALLIC CLANKING
What's that noise?

706
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,160
They've raised the harbour chain!
They've stayed loyal to Edward!

707
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,960
Turn the wheel!

708
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,000
Raise the sail! Now! Do it!

709
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,560
WHISTLING

710
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,920
SPLASHING, SPLINTERING WOOD

711
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,200
WHISTLING

712
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,200
BOOMING SPLASHES, ISABEL SCREAMS

713
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,960
Lady Mother, they are firing at us!

714
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,000
You will have to turn it. Annie!
You have the smallest hands. No...

715
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,160
You have to put them inside her
and try and turn the baby.

716
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,840
No, Mother, please! I cannot!

717
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,080
The child is stuck. If you love
your sister, you will do it!

718
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,960
Annie... Please, Lady Mother!
I don't want to die!

719
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,600
Annie! Ann...

720
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,760
(Jasper!)

721
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,440
Jasper!

722
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,680
I'm sorry!

723
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,280
No! No, no... It's me.

724
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm so sorry.
My brother betrayed you.

725
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,120
Margaret,

726
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,800
I have to go.

727
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,120
There is a price upon my head
and they're searching for me.

728
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,080
I will go to France,

729
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,560
but I will be back and with an army.

730
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,520
I couldn't tell our boy that
I was here in case he spoke of it,

731
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,720
but I was hiding there
in the hills, waiting for you.

732
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,920
You wanted to be sure my boy
was safe before you sailed.

733
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,280
How will I live without you?

734
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,720
May we come and watch you go?

735
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,520
It will be good for the boy
to see you safely off.

736
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,280
He is close to you.

737
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,840
BIRDSONG

738
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,720
WET DRIPPING, QUIET CREAKING

739
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,800
It was a boy.

740
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,160
A baby boy.

741
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,000
SHE SOBS

742
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,480
SHE SOBS PITIFULLY

743
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,400
I have to go away. You must live
with your mother now, boy.

744
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,280
You must keep her safe for me.
All right?

745
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,960
Like a Tudor, eh, Henry?

746
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,840
Like a Tudor, sir!

747
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,240
Come here, boy.

748
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,720
HE SIGHS

749
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,200
Henry, would you like to
pray with me?

750
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,280
We could pray for your Uncle Jasper
together? No, thank you, my Lady.

751
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,120
It's "Mother", Henry.
I'm your La...Lady Mother...

752
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,080
Edward!

753
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,560
Come.

754
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,760
You remembered!

755
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,200
Peaches and salt cod.
Back for May Day as promised.

756
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,480
And now we have our York prince,
Edward, we shall be safe.

757
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,400
SEAGULLS CRY, SEA GENTLY LAPS

758
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,440
I'm sorry for your loss.

759
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,480
OUR loss.

760
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,280
There will be others.

761
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,400
If we had stayed at Warwick Castle,
my baby would have lived.

762
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,760
It is your fault.
Queen Elizabeth is with child again.

763
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,320
We must have a son before she does.

764
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,160
This is NOT the end, Isabel.

765
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,480
But it is the end of my baby...

766
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,520
It is the end of him.
