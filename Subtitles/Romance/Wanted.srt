1
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:42,037
1 ! 2! 3!

2
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:53,510
Hello.

3
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,382
Okay.

4
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:57,047
Shaina from Mumbai.
Let her hold.

5
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,120
Kill her.

6
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:07,531
Yes! Give me.

7
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:12,399
Don Gani..
Yes, Shaina, tell me.

8
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:15,407
Don Gani, l was trying to
contact you. - Yes, go ahead.

9
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:19,803
Golden has been murdered and there
is a blood bath happening here.

10
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:22,409
You guys don't do anything.

11
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:23,608
l'm coming to Mumbai
the day after tomorrow.

12
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:43,493
Tony here. Gani is coming to
Mumbai the day after tomorrow.

13
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,832
Confirmed?

14
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:46,496
Hundred per cent.

15
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:23,473
'To rein in the crime in Mumbai..'

16
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:25,477
'..the government has roped
in the lG of Punjab police..'

17
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,479
'..Mr. Ashraf Taufiq
Khan and appointed him..'

18
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:28,809
'..the new police
commissioner of Mumbai.'

19
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:32,212
'He will hold a meeting with
top police officials today.'

20
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:38,485
Who is this Golden?

21
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,617
He's a big name in
Mumbai underworld.

22
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,752
Two third of Mumbai is
controlled by Golden and his gang.

23
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:46,764
Kidnapping, contract killing,
extortion, land grabbing.

24
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,498
This is what the gang does.

25
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:53,165
This gang is run by a
person called Gani, not Golden.

26
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,503
He operates this
gang from outside lndia.

27
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:57,099
Don Gani.
Yes, tell me.

28
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:58,505
Yourjob will be done.

29
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:01,104
We got information from
the intelligence report..

30
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,513
..that in the terrorist
attack on Mumbai last week..

31
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,515
..Gani used his local gang
to help the terrorists..

32
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:09,521
..come via the sea route.

33
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:12,050
He never stays in the
country for too long.

34
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:14,059
That's why he has not
been caught till now.

35
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:15,585
And who is Datta Pawale?

36
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,524
Datta Pawale used
to be work for Gani.

37
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:20,259
Tie him to a rock and throw him in.

38
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,795
He built his own gang.

39
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:24,132
He does the same kind of
work as Golden's gang.

40
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,794
But on a smaller scale.

41
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,531
His right hand's name is Shiva.

42
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:30,201
He operates in the
area around Versova.

43
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,005
Every other day there's
a gang war between them.

44
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,543
Some from the police department
are hand-in-glove with them.

45
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,743
And both gangs have
political support.

46
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,549
We arrest them in the morning.
But they get released by evening.

47
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:44,089
Come on. Get in.

48
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:48,550
Unless we finish the Mumbai
underworld and these local gangs..

49
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:52,564
..this city can't be safe
from foreign terrorists.

50
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:56,225
'The moment Ashraf
Khan took charge..'

51
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,896
'..he started
operations against the mafia.'

52
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,572
'ln the past 48 hours more than
200 goons have been arrested..'

53
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:06,305
'..and eight dangerous
goons have been shot dead.'

54
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:10,577
'Because of Commissioner
Ashraf's tough stand..'

55
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,053
'..against the Mumbai underworld,
the gangsters are really frightened.'

56
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:20,918
'Ashraf Khan says it's his
dream to make Mumbai crime free.'

57
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:23,594
'And to do this, he
will not worry about..'

58
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:26,257
'..political or
bureaucratic pressure.'

59
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,273
We have to take care of a man.
Who?

60
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,678
Genghis.
The one from Ghatkopar? - Yes.

61
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,607
We have to beat him
up in his locality.

62
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:46,343
Money.

63
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,013
Which one of you will beat him up?

64
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,081
Radhe.

65
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,620
He's wanted.

66
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:56,820
ls he any good?

67
00:06:58,698 --> 00:06:59,824
He's more ruthless than Rambo.

68
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:00,957
More destructive than Terminator.

69
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:03,292
Smarter than Rocky and
Quicker than Bruce Lee.

70
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:04,830
He's the last action hero.

71
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,033
Stop!

72
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:13,640
Nab him!

73
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:17,240
Nab him!

74
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,782
You scoundrel! Stop there!
Stop!

75
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,219
He's wanted.

76
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:04,221
The stuff is here brother.

77
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:07,232
They are just too many.
Go get some more money.

78
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,697
Okay. Excuse me.

79
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,094
Move aside.

80
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:14,371
Hey! Who are you?

81
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:15,969
You won't get beaten up
without knowing my name?

82
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,700
So you've taken the
contract to beat me up?

83
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:22,780
Once l take a contract,
l don't listen to myself even.

84
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:30,115
You fool. Can't you see
how many men are with me?

85
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,381
Pigs always hunt in groups.

86
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:35,384
And a tiger hunts alone.

87
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,723
Shankar, pull down the shutters.

88
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,931
Brother.. Keep it slightly open.

89
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,261
He might find it
useful while escaping.

90
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:42,729
Stop!

91
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:43,994
Move aside!

92
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,273
You'll die today.

93
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,274
You've made a big mistake
by throwing away the key.

94
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,148
Hey, what will you do? What?

95
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:01,411
l swear on your mother.

96
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:05,082
Today, you won't be able to crawl
out of here, let alone walk out.

97
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:06,952
You're swearing on my mother?

98
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:09,756
Now that l've sworn on her..
You swore on my mother..

99
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:11,421
l'll keep it.
You..

100
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:49,519
Brother.

101
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,859
l'll break the lock
as well as yourjaw.

102
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:56,326

Break it down.

108
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,585

Hello, tell me..

Hey, stupid. Why did you disturb me?

170
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:52,629
Prabhudheva and Govinda had
joined me in celebrations.

171
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:53,756
Blasted them.

172
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:56,662

She lives in the neighbourhood.

177
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:10,003
She's throwing me glances.

178
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:13,809
What kind of a girl
will be interested in you.

179
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:15,875
She's a cat.
Really?

180
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:18,814
Someone like me won't get a
Miss World or Miss Universe.

181
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:21,089
l have only one principle.

182
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:23,091
Try to woo the least
beautiful girl in the group.

183
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,621
She gets enticed quickly.

184
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:27,019
And she won't betray you in love.

185
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:30,628
You fool. lf you
run after the girl..

186
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:32,895
..the girl will take
your money and run.

187
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:36,829
lf you chase money,
the girl will chase you.

188
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:38,364
Excuse me!

189
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:41,633
l don't agree with you.

190
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:45,043
Don't look at my face.
Look in my eyes.

191
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:51,248
There's so much truth in them.

192
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:56,722
Your eyes express what
your heart wants to say.

193
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:57,851
Right.

194
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:04,660

195
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:06,926

Really?

198
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:11,934
You love me, too, don't you?

199
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:15,405
Then, why don't you express it?

200
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:16,870
l'm scared.

201
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:20,348
You're in love. Don't get scared.

202
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,685
When you're in
love why get scared?

203
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:26,221
When you're in
love why get scared?

204
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:27,686
You've loved, it's no..

205
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:28,815
That was superb!

206
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:30,689
'Thank you. lf you
record a video like this ..

207
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,694
.. and give it to your boyfriend..'

208
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:33,956
'..he'll be crazy about you.'

209
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,088
What l was saying is..

210
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:39,092
lt will be done.

211
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:40,692
Brother!
Yes.

212
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:42,699
Who was the girl on TV?

213
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,034
She's a customer.
Oh, Really?

214
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:46,041
Yes, sir. Her
handycam was not working.

215
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:47,903
The cassette got stuck. So
we were just checking it out.

216
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:51,112
Okay. Go on. - Hello. Yes.
You'll get it by 4 o'clock.

217

We are in love and not thieves.

222

Thank you.

223
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:28,279
Why to sigh in solitude?

225

You we-re going to
meet your cousin, right?

Then go on.

00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:44,823
lf she has two more cousins,
then take them along.

230
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,443
Dad, money..

Where were you all these days?

233
00:18:58,514 --> 00:18:59,981
No phone call. No message.

234
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,240
Do you think this is a guesthouse?

235
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:04,919
You come and leave
whenever you feel like. Get up!

236
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:13,321
Don't look at girls. Okay?
Absolutely.

237
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:32,010
When you're in
love why get scared?

238
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:35,812
When you're in
love why get scared?

239

We're in love and are not thieves.

240
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:42,286
Why to sigh in solitude?

241
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:46,351
When you're in
love why get scared?

242

And you're ruining your
life with your loafer friends.

244
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:54,894
Excuse me, sir.
Yes.

245
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:56,495
Some boys are peeping
in through the window.

247

253
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,864
Take away these goons.

You'll get me in trouble.
Let's go. Come on.

He is too much. You

Girls like these, do
things like this for us.

258
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,278
Check if he has gone.

259
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:47,884
He's gone.

260
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,552

lt's my first day on duty, sir.

266
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:13,245
Why do you want to be a policeman?

267
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:16,981
For money? - No, sir. l
want to serve my country.

268
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:20,111
l want to work as a policeman
and get a medal from the president.

00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:28,121

All right. then l'll shoot you.

276
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:46,010
Fine. Shoot this.

l don't know, sir.

281

The rifle we are given
during training is brand new.

282
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:06,160
The barrel is straight and
so is the body, isn't it?

283
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,970
And the service weapon that we get..

284
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:11,972
..is like some old used junk.

285
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:14,232
The barrel is not straight
and the body is quite loose.

286
00:22:15,177 --> 00:22:17,975
The bullet is released,
but we miss the target.

287
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:19,105
Do you understand?

288
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:22,173
lf you know how to shoot
at point blank range..

289
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:24,982

00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:26,646

00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:45,733
He tells me to either give him
protection money or stop the work.

million or else l'll finish him.

302
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,279
You're behaving like a beggar.

303
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:04,021
Tell him to pay up Rs.2.5
million or else you'll finish him.

304
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:05,151
All right, boss.

Hi!

Had he not been our landlord,
l wouldn't have taken him in.

310

Aunt!

311
00:23:25,581 --> 00:23:26,639
What are you doing?

312
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:29,377
Aunt, l'm fed up of
the girls of this colony.

313
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:32,046
Look, another girl has sent
me a love letter. Read it.

314

'Hi, dude. You don't

320
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:55,736
'The way you walk.

321
00:23:56,345 --> 00:24:01,146
'And your cute muscles

322
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,079
Read it quickly.

323
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:06,417
'All the girls in the colony are
crazy about you, let alone me.'

324
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:11,749
'For God's sake, don't lose
your heart to anyone else but me.'

325
00:24:13,229 --> 00:24:15,094
'l can't sleep at night..'
Enough!

326
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:18,758
Just imagine, if you're
ashamed to hear all this..

327
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:22,361

handsome guy go through?

Do you know how old the girl is?

329
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,103
Only 16.

330
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:30,306
lf she were of Jahnvi's age,
l would have considered it.

331
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:32,103
Janu. Janu!

Okay. l apologise to you on

You smiled and now you're trapped.

340
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:08,882

You want to meet Radhe?
Yes.

355
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:40,306
l'm Radhe.

356
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:44,644
Let go off my collar.

357
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,382
What did you say?
Oh God.

358
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:48,514
What did you say?

359
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:50,252
Come on.
Come with us.

360
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:52,260
Come on, brother.
Come on.

361
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,769
Sit down.
Why Did he ask him To sit?

362
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:15,815
People are scared
even to look at my men.

363
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:17,408
But you beat them up.
Hang on.

364
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:21,347
Yes, Brother.

365
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,822
They don't steal
footwear from a mosque.

366
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:26,588
The one who needs
them takes them away.

367
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:30,288
lt's your footwear that's been
stolen, not the Kohinoor diamond.

368
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:31,965
Go buy another pair from the market.

369
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,433
Do you know why you're still alive?

370
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,707
What? You couldn't get pilaf?

371
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:43,244
Do one thing. Get
chicken from the market.

372
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:46,975
Bring some rice. Add water in
a pan and prepare the pilaf.

373
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:48,374
Cool.

374
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,380
Will you work for me?

375
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:57,653
No. l only work for Gandhi.

376
00:26:57,793 --> 00:27:01,991
Gandhi? Who is this don?
Shut up. He's talking about money.

377
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,328
Stop doing odd jobs from today.

378
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:07,927
You got to follow two rules
if you want to work with me.

379
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,329
First. Don't mess with the police.

380
00:27:10,406 --> 00:27:12,772
And second. Never
be afraid of death.

381
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,002
The one who talks about the
police is actually afraid of them.

382
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,313
This is your right hand man?

383
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:22,007
Hey!
Stop!

384
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,323
l punched your goon in your own den.

385
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:30,825
This was in reply to
your second requirement.

386
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:35,292
Don't grab me by my collar again.

387
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:40,496
l'll do any job that you want.

388
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:42,436
But l should get half the share.

389
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:47,572
Hey, hero. You have a great style.

390
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:50,612
Sister, are you here to
make them your brothers?

391
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,712
Don't worry. l won't
make you my brother.

392
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:02,387
My name is Shayana.

393
00:28:12,668 --> 00:28:15,398
You play well with the weapon.

394
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:17,531
l'm a good at shooting also.

395
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,408
He's a resourceful man,
but he's too smart.

396
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:35,489
it's just your mouth
that's bleeding right now.

397
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:37,047
Just imagine what will happen later.

398
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:49,836
Hey stop, stop.
Stop! Stop you, idiot.

399
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:52,631
Wait here.

400
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,811
You loafers, your father
is getting married? Move on.

401
00:28:58,881 --> 00:28:59,939
Don't you have a college to go to?

402
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:01,876
Oops! Sorry.

403
00:29:03,786 --> 00:29:04,844
Where are you going?

404
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,978

Fitness centre.

415

Hey, take me to the guest house,
not the police station.

423
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:17,458

The queue is pretty long sir.
lt will take too much time.

00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:56,387
You please start the treatment.
What if there's a long queue?

521
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:58,523
Don't you understand?
This is the hospital rule.

00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,858
lt's mandatory.

523
00:35:59,935 --> 00:36:01,197

fill the form, pay the fees.

530
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,450
And then get treated.

531
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:27,552
l'm bleeding pretty badly.
What can l do?

532
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:29,391
You've laid down these rules.

533
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:31,832
First come the rules
and then the treatment.

534
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,032
First the treatment
and then comes the rules.

535
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:36,561
Hold this.

536
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:38,003
Come on, Son.
Where are You taking him?

537
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,836
We will treat him first sir.
Forms can be filled in later.

538
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:40,966
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

539
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:48,340
Thanks.

540
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:53,517
Why did you have to get
violent to get me treated?

541
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,055
The results are in front of you.

542
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,255
Why did that man try to kill you?

543
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:00,891
l must have beaten him up.
He was only taking revenge.

544
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:02,925
What do you do anyway?

545
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:06,124
She's asking such a direct question.

546
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:08,593
What do you think?

547
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:14,534
l think you're a hoo..
a hooligan?

548
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:18,003
Correct.

549
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,005
Why don't you work
somewhere to earn money?

550
00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:23,949
Mother Teresa, who
says l don't earn money?

551
00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:25,953
l can do anything for money.

552
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:27,279
What do you mean?

553
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:29,949
l beat up the doctor, didn't l?
Yes.

554
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:32,022
l take money for such things.

555
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,618
But why?

556
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:35,122
That's my talent.

557
00:37:35,196 --> 00:37:36,629
People get scared of me.

558
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:38,257
Self-employment.

559
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:40,125
Self..

560
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,634
You're wondering whether l'm
a good person or a bad one.

561
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,235
No. no.
No?

562
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:49,301
Gabbar Singh.

563
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,502
Shall we go, Sambha?
Yes!

564
00:37:56,117 --> 00:37:57,175
Where do you want to go, sir?

565
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,577
Let's go.

566
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:02,582
How did you call the taxi?
l whistled. Why?

567
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,989
How?
Don't you know how to whistle?

568
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,318
No.

569
00:38:06,528 --> 00:38:07,995
Bring out your tongue a little.

570
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:12,657
Bring it out. Come on.

571
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:16,395
A little more.

572
00:38:18,206 --> 00:38:19,571
Now bend it like Beckham.

573
00:38:36,591 --> 00:38:37,649
Great whistle!

574
00:39:14,662 --> 00:39:18,428
Oh, my darling, l can do
anything for your love.

575
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:25,137
Oh, my darling, l can do
anything for your love.

576
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:28,733
l can fight the world for you.

577
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,605
How do l believe you'll
do everything for me?

578
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,615
Who knows? You'll dump me anytime.

579
00:39:35,683 --> 00:39:39,676

582
00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:53,763
Take away my heart. Baby,

583
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:55,535
ln return, give me your heart.

584
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,400
Listen to me, baby.

585
00:39:57,472 --> 00:39:59,201
Listen to me, baby.

586
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:00,707
You're young.

587
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:03,369
Come on, baby. Come on,
baby. Listen to me.

588
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:04,605
Let's go party.

589

590
00:40:15,256 --> 00:40:18,589
l'll run on the path of love.

591
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,187
Go away. Don't boast so much.

592
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:25,255
Don't teach me about love.

593
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,664
All day..
Go away.

594
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:28,725
l'll chase you..
Go away.

595
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:32,068
l'll drag you to court.

596
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:36,241
ln your love, l can
sing the melody backwards.

597
00:40:43,251 --> 00:40:46,516
ln your love, l can
sing the melody backwards.

598
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:50,080
l'll perform fire
rituals to win you over.

599
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:53,685
How do l believe you'll
do everything for me?

600
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:57,094
Who knows? You'll dump me anytime.

601
00:40:57,165 --> 00:41:01,158

00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:32,700
Darling, don't make
me suffer so much.

605
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:36,259
You have my head,
you may behead me.

606
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:39,804
Don't talk so much about love.

607
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:43,275
Go away. Stop chasing me.
Finish the matter.

608
00:41:43,344 --> 00:41:44,743
Why do you break my heart?
Go away.

609
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:46,643
Why are you upset?
Go away.

610
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:49,808
Why do you want to
fall in love with me?

611
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:53,710
lf l make a mistake,
l'll accept any punishment.

612
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:04,323
lf l make a mistake,
l'll do the sit-ups.

613
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:07,766
l'll accept the punishment
and then steal your heart.

614
00:42:07,835 --> 00:42:11,669
How do l believe you'll
do everything for me?

615
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:14,640
Who knows? You'll dump me anytime.

616
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:18,668
l love you, darling. l can
give my life for you as well.

617
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:25,350
l love you, darling. l can

618
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,914
l love you, darling. l can

619
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,524
Come on.

620
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:46,205
Hey, get up!

621
00:42:48,743 --> 00:42:50,210
Search the house.
Yes, sir.

622
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:54,844
What's going on?

623
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,608
Raid.

624
00:42:57,752 --> 00:42:58,810
Raid.

625
00:43:05,426 --> 00:43:08,953
We've got information that
this is a house of ill repute.

626
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,358
Do you understand?

627
00:43:17,572 --> 00:43:19,267
What are you doing?
This is my house.

628
00:43:19,674 --> 00:43:21,699
You've been mistaken. This..

629
00:43:23,845 --> 00:43:24,971
l've been mistaken?

630
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:26,971
l?

631
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:30,642
Hey, come here.

632
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,312
Who is she?
my sister.

633
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,448
Who all live here?

634
00:43:36,524 --> 00:43:38,389
Me, my mother and my sister.

635
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:39,517
And your father?

636
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:41,294
My father is no more.

637
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:43,529
Who comes here everyday?
No one.

638
00:43:43,798 --> 00:43:45,857
Then who is that peeping tom?

639
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:47,560
He is the landlord.

640
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:50,297
Whenever he comes here, he
troubles us. Just like you.

641
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:56,332
Come to the other room.
l want to talk to you.

642
00:44:18,633 --> 00:44:20,464
l'm saddened by your condition.

643
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:23,360
lt must have been
difficult to raise the kids, right?

644
00:44:23,438 --> 00:44:24,496
How do you run the house?

645
00:44:24,572 --> 00:44:26,301
My daughter goes to work.

646
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:27,699
Where is she?

647
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,833
She hasn't returned yet.

648
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:31,936
She works the nights?

649
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:35,974
No. No.

650
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:39,719
Hey, don't cry. Please.

651
00:44:41,656 --> 00:44:43,317
l can understand your feelings.

652
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:46,554
You have a young daughter.

653
00:44:47,395 --> 00:44:49,329
You must be worried thinking
how you'd get her married.

654
00:44:50,865 --> 00:44:51,923
Don't worry.

655
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:54,392
l'll keep her.

656
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,028
She's amazing.

657
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:58,463
Hey, please.

658
00:44:58,673 --> 00:44:59,970
l'll take care of you too.

659
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:02,771
You're fine even at your age.

660
00:45:04,879 --> 00:45:06,938
The ruin says it was beautiful once.

661
00:45:10,485 --> 00:45:11,543
Think about it, Laxmi.

662
00:45:12,687 --> 00:45:14,348
lf there's a
policeman in the house..

663
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:16,754
..will anyone dare
misbehave with you?

664
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:21,417
Or else the same drug
case or a prostitution case.

665
00:45:22,563 --> 00:45:25,964
Can your family
endure so much bad name?

666
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,994
l know you'll take
the right decision.

667
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:42,808
Great escape.

668
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:44,075
Thank you.

669
00:45:46,654 --> 00:45:47,882
Are you the uncle who lives here?

670
00:45:48,022 --> 00:45:52,118
l'm not your uncle. l'm
Sonu Gates. Software Engineer.

671
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:55,895
You're Jahnvi's watchman from today.

672
00:45:56,397 --> 00:45:58,388
Call me and inform me about..

673
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:00,957
..who comes here,
who meets her, etc.

674
00:46:01,736 --> 00:46:03,397
Do you understand?
l understand, sir.

675
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:05,530

676
00:46:10,077 --> 00:46:11,476
Hey, come here!

677
00:46:11,746 --> 00:46:13,475
Why are you gossiping over there?

678
00:46:13,548 --> 00:46:15,482
Take the order quickly, or
else l'll cut your wages.

679
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,008
Go on!

680
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:18,142
Who is Ganesh?

681
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:19,612
That's me. Why?

682
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:21,546
And who is she?

683
00:46:22,757 --> 00:46:23,815
Who is she?

684
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,023
As soon as you got married,
you abandoned your mother?

685
00:46:29,096 --> 00:46:30,688
Mother! Mother!

686
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,834
lf you do this again,
l'll break yourjaw.

687
00:46:40,775 --> 00:46:43,505
Radhe, my father. My father.

688
00:46:44,779 --> 00:46:45,837
What's going on?

689
00:46:46,113 --> 00:46:47,171
And what are you doing here?

690
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:49,574
l had come to meet my friend.

691
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,810
They are your friends?

692
00:46:55,723 --> 00:46:57,520
They are my friends.

693
00:46:59,627 --> 00:47:01,527
So, Ganesh, take
care of your mother.

694
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:02,654
We'll move.

695
00:47:04,465 --> 00:47:05,591
Did you understand?

696
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,802
Why were they beating you up?

697
00:47:15,142 --> 00:47:16,666
They are my childhood friends.

698
00:47:16,811 --> 00:47:19,837
They beat me up
every time they meet me.

699
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:21,640
Yes, l saw that.

700
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:23,707
l saw who was beating whom.

701
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:25,651
Serve a cold drink
to this gentleman.

702
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:34,494
Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Sweetheart!

703
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:38,756
Yes!

704
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,528
Talk to your dad. He
appears out of thin air.

705
00:47:43,704 --> 00:47:46,571
With age everything..
Rots.

706
00:47:46,641 --> 00:47:47,835
But your dad is troubling us.

707
00:47:59,587 --> 00:48:00,645
Hi.

708
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,183
Shopping?

709
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:08,192
You?
Warning.

710
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:11,656
Warning?

711
00:48:11,866 --> 00:48:13,527
Sweetheart!
Mister! What?

712
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:15,862
l wanted to return your Rs.10000.

713
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,799
Rs.10000? When did l give it to you?

714
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:20,664
You're not Mr. Naren.
You're not? Sorry.

715
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:24,602
Sweetheart!

716
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:28,877
Do anything you can. The
lift should stop. - Okay.

717
00:48:31,686 --> 00:48:34,621
The job's done?
lt's done.

718
00:48:35,756 --> 00:48:37,018
Sweetheart! Open the door.

719
00:48:38,225 --> 00:48:40,284
What happened?
Hold on.

720
00:48:41,162 --> 00:48:42,288
Why did the lift stop?

721
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:43,688
lt will take 10 to 15 minutes.

722
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:45,632
Have fun, man.

723
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,027
What? An hour?

724
00:48:48,102 --> 00:48:49,160
One hour?

725
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:50,294
lt will take an hour?

726
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:52,200
l got it.

727
00:48:52,273 --> 00:48:53,797
lt will take an hour now.

728
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,100
What happened?
Listen.

729
00:48:56,911 --> 00:48:58,208
l hope you've had food.
Yes.

730
00:48:58,646 --> 00:48:59,704
Have you been to the washroom?

731
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:01,205
Why?

732
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:03,640
Because you'll get none of it here.

733
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:04,976
lt will take an hour.

734
00:49:06,253 --> 00:49:07,311
An hour?

735
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:10,287
We can die of
suffocation in an hour.

736
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:13,320
lt's a good thing
that you'll die young.

737
00:49:14,662 --> 00:49:15,993
Or else afterwards..

738
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:22,200
..old age, overweight, grey hair.

739
00:49:22,937 --> 00:49:25,132
Artificial dentures, wrinkles.

740
00:49:25,206 --> 00:49:29,165
And this heavy make-up
to hide those wrinkles.

741
00:49:29,243 --> 00:49:32,679
Hello. Apart from lipstick,
l don't use anything else.

742
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,008
What's this?

743
00:49:38,953 --> 00:49:40,750
Mechanic, the lift is
not working. Come, quickly.

744
00:49:40,821 --> 00:49:41,879
Give him to me.

745
00:49:42,223 --> 00:49:45,124
Come quickly. But the lift
shouldn't start soon. - Yes.

746
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,297
Can l ask you a question?

747
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:59,172
Shoot. - What's the
name of your girlfriend?

748
00:50:00,374 --> 00:50:01,705
l don't have a girlfriend.

749
00:50:03,244 --> 00:50:04,711
Do you have a boyfriend?

750
00:50:05,713 --> 00:50:09,114
Haven't found someone who
l could call my boyfriend.

751
00:50:10,184 --> 00:50:11,845
What do you want in a boyfriend?

752
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:15,113
The guy should be well-educated.

753
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:18,714
He should have a greatjob.

754
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:22,724
He should be a good human being.

755
00:50:23,998 --> 00:50:27,161
Handsome.. l won't mind if he's not.

756
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,728
That's the only quality l have.
And there is no requirement for it.

757
00:50:32,807 --> 00:50:34,741
Did you say something?
Best of luck.

758
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,738
Check what the problem is.

759
00:50:43,117 --> 00:50:44,744
What kind of a girl do you like?

760
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:47,686
l could do with any kind of girl.
Wow!

761
00:50:48,022 --> 00:50:51,287
But they have their own long lists.
And l don't fit any of them.

762
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:53,758
l hate girls.

763
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:56,923
Sometimes l feel l
should have a boyfriend.

764
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:01,701
ldiot, as soon as you repair it..

765
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:03,396
..the lift should
go two floors below.

766
00:51:13,247 --> 00:51:14,305
What is that?

767
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:18,048
My cell phone is on vibration mode.

768
00:51:23,324 --> 00:51:26,122
l am not sure whether
it will work or not.

769
00:51:28,062 --> 00:51:29,393
Now you may land.

770
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:37,133
Okay?
Yes. Now. do it Now.

771
00:51:37,204 --> 00:51:38,796
Do it quickly.

772
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:46,274
Okay?
Okay.

773
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:50,912
Okay.
Okay.

774
00:51:52,386 --> 00:51:54,081
l'm feeling very hot.

775
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:57,215
Me too.

776
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:04,923
Vicco Vajradanti?
Yes.

777
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:08,159
Me too.

778
00:52:09,236 --> 00:52:10,294
Should l show you?

779
00:52:14,408 --> 00:52:16,933
For me.
Okay.

780
00:52:21,182 --> 00:52:23,844
Now this lift will
stop on the ground floor.

781
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:40,433
When you're in
love why get scared?

782
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:47,233
We are in love and we are not
thieves. Why to sigh in solitude.

783
00:52:47,308 --> 00:52:50,334
When you're in
love why get scared?

784
00:53:00,421 --> 00:53:01,888
Oh, thank God.
Excuse me.

785
00:53:02,389 --> 00:53:05,119
Sweetheart! , where is he?
Where is that hooligan? Where..

786
00:53:05,826 --> 00:53:08,226
He escaped. Come, Sweetheart!.

787
00:53:09,997 --> 00:53:12,557
l've already paid Don Gani's man.

788
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,061
Who is this Don Gani?
l don't know any Gani.

789
00:53:15,202 --> 00:53:16,965
What did he say? He
doesn't know Don Gani?

790
00:53:17,438 --> 00:53:21,568
l want Rs.2.5 million.
Right now or else..

791
00:53:22,843 --> 00:53:24,367
Hello.
Golden.

792
00:53:24,845 --> 00:53:25,903
Why did you call?

793
00:53:26,013 --> 00:53:28,208
l want a meeting with you.
Why?

794
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:30,912
Call Radhe for the meeting.

795
00:53:47,468 --> 00:53:49,459
Your men crossed into my area.

796
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:52,972
Let me take a look at him carefully.

797
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:57,501
Why are you staring at me?

798
00:53:57,611 --> 00:53:59,078
Do you want to marry
off your sister with me?

799
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:02,410
l paid you to beat up Genghis.

800
00:54:03,017 --> 00:54:05,076
And now you've
joined hands with them?

801
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:06,982
l work only for money.

802
00:54:07,154 --> 00:54:09,952
You pay me handsomely.
l'll kill him.

803
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:14,992
Scoundrel, you're very cunning.

804
00:54:17,498 --> 00:54:19,432
l have two
conditions for the compromise.

805
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:21,626
First, your men will
not operate in my area.

806
00:54:21,902 --> 00:54:23,893
And second, l want Shiva.

807
00:54:25,906 --> 00:54:28,238
Golden, will you kill me?

808
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:29,433
You want to kill me?

809
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:30,568
His photograph got
published in the papers.

810
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:32,009
Does that make him a hero?

811
00:54:32,112 --> 00:54:34,512
He extorts money in my area and
says he doesn't know Don Gani.

812
00:54:34,648 --> 00:54:37,947
l'm a hero. And l'll
say it in front of you.

813
00:54:38,052 --> 00:54:39,212
Who is this Don Gani?

814
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,117
You..
Golden!

815
00:54:41,522 --> 00:54:45,356
Why are you getting angry?
Sit down. Relax. Just sit down.

816
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:48,456
Why are you getting angry at him?

817
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:50,425
He says what l tell him.

818
00:54:51,398 --> 00:54:54,367
Even l don't know your Don Gani.

819
00:54:57,538 --> 00:55:00,063
You've come to meet him
and he has set you up.

820
00:55:04,478 --> 00:55:06,343
Let's finish them all and go.

821
00:55:08,182 --> 00:55:10,548
What did you say?
Look at me and say it.

822
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:13,215
Hey, tell him what kind
of a man is Datta Pawale.

823
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,086
Stupid! ldiot! Have
you lost it? He's crazy.

824
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:19,056
You'll kill us? ln our area?

825
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:20,217
Let go of his collar.

826
00:55:20,327 --> 00:55:22,022
l won't. What will you do?
What will you do?

827
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:25,995
Don't worry about this
loud mouth. Just say yes.

828
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:28,361
Who is he to say anything?
What will you do if he says yes?

829
00:55:28,435 --> 00:55:29,493
What will you do?

830
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:32,035
l have decided.
Who are You To decide anything?

831
00:55:32,106 --> 00:55:33,630
Hey, you're just a new kid.

832
00:55:33,707 --> 00:55:35,072
l've been in this
business for 20 years.

833
00:55:35,142 --> 00:55:36,575
l've killed more than 50.

834
00:55:36,643 --> 00:55:38,702
Why are you looking at him?
tell me quickly. Say Yes.

835
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:42,148
What can he say? l
say yes. Look here..

836
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:08,199
Kill him!

837
00:56:16,683 --> 00:56:18,048
No! No!

838
00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:38,032
He says he doesn't know Don Gani.

839
00:56:38,105 --> 00:56:39,470
He doesn't know Don Gani!
He doesn't know Don Gani!

840
00:56:39,573 --> 00:56:41,040
Let him go. He has got know.

841
00:56:41,175 --> 00:56:44,633
You fool! Because of you,
all of us would have been dead.

842
00:56:44,778 --> 00:56:46,040
Do you need him?

843
00:56:46,313 --> 00:56:49,146
Will you kill him?
Will you kill him?

844
00:56:51,118 --> 00:56:53,780
Hey, come on. Get going.
Darn you.

845
00:56:54,088 --> 00:56:56,318
When will the Mumbai police wake up?

846
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,448
Sir, so many people
are being killed..

847
00:56:57,524 --> 00:56:58,786
..and you're giving
such routine answers?

848
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:00,458
You can't stay silent like this.

849
00:57:00,527 --> 00:57:03,553
lf the media can reach the
gangsters, why can't the police?

850
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,621
The police don't know
anything but to take bribe.

851
00:57:13,073 --> 00:57:14,131
She has come.

852
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,442
Hi.
Hi.

853
00:57:21,615 --> 00:57:23,276
You're going home?
Yes.

854
00:57:27,254 --> 00:57:28,312
What's in the box?

855
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:30,147
Pasta.

856
00:57:30,357 --> 00:57:32,086
Let me have it.
lt's empty.

857
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:40,157
Are you annoyed with me?

858
00:57:41,101 --> 00:57:42,227
l tried to call you several times.

859
00:57:42,302 --> 00:57:44,463
Sometimes it's
switched off and other times..

860
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:46,605
Which number did you dial?

861
00:57:47,107 --> 00:57:49,268
9821066660

862
00:57:49,543 --> 00:57:52,478
That's not my number. 9894536993.

863
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:57,508
Three.

864
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:03,146
l tried your number
several times as well.

865
00:58:06,126 --> 00:58:07,184
lf you want my number.

866
00:58:07,294 --> 00:58:10,161
Just ask for it. l'll give
you a missed call. Feed it in.

867
00:58:13,734 --> 00:58:16,328
They are my friends.
Hello. - Hi.

868
00:58:20,174 --> 00:58:21,505
Oh, sorry.

869
00:58:27,181 --> 00:58:29,240
These Mumbai trains are so shaky.

870
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,278
Yes.

871
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:43,320
Excuse me.
Yes.

872
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,589
He is sitting here already.
Who?

873
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:47,591
My husband.

874
00:58:47,768 --> 00:58:48,894
He has gone to the toilet.

875
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:53,171
There's no toilet in a local train.

876
00:58:53,373 --> 00:58:54,806
Please get up.
Why?

877
00:58:54,908 --> 00:58:56,239
Get up!
What?

878
00:58:56,343 --> 00:59:01,212
ldiot, don't bug me. Get out
of here or else l'll punch you.

879
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:02,339
She's such a bully!

880
00:59:03,217 --> 00:59:04,912
Don't panic. Please be seated.

881
00:59:08,355 --> 00:59:11,722
The train on platform number 7 is..

882
00:59:24,438 --> 00:59:25,564
Sister is at home.

883
00:59:27,341 --> 00:59:30,333
Son, don't push like that.

884
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:34,378
We are men. lt might
hurt our delicate parts.

885
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:41,379
There must have been pasta
in this lunch-box. - Correct

886
00:59:45,325 --> 00:59:47,225
You are of no use to me, Brother.

887
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,354
Brother? l see. You
mean brother-in-law.

888
00:59:52,432 --> 00:59:53,763
My sister is great, isn't she?

889
00:59:55,435 --> 00:59:57,232
But tell her to call me.

890
00:59:57,304 --> 00:59:59,329
All right.
But only on one condition. - What?

891
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,435
How did you build such a physique?

892
01:00:05,279 --> 01:00:06,337
Are you trying to make fun of me?

893
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,608
No. l'm serious. Give me some tips.

894
01:00:10,317 --> 01:00:15,983
Eat less and go the
toilet many times.

895
01:00:16,323 --> 01:00:18,917
Yes, that's what my sister does.
What?

896
01:00:18,992 --> 01:00:20,892
Yes.
Oh no!

897
01:00:23,263 --> 01:00:24,355
Which song were you playing?

898
01:00:24,464 --> 01:00:26,762
Pasta, pasta, l've fallen in love.

899
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:28,926
Pasta, pasta, l've fallen in love.

900
01:00:32,673 --> 01:00:36,507
Hi, Laxmi. How are you?
ls your health all right?

901
01:00:36,843 --> 01:00:38,333
Did you talk to Jahnvi about me?

902
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:39,707
What is it? Why are you silent?

903
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,578
Why are you troubling us like this?

904
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:43,809
Should l come tonight?

905
01:01:18,385 --> 01:01:19,443
Poor guy.

906
01:01:20,987 --> 01:01:22,045
What..

907
01:01:30,464 --> 01:01:34,332
Sir! Sir, Dilip Topi was
troubling Mr. Gulati, the builder..

908
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:35,766
..for Rs.2.5 million.

909
01:01:36,336 --> 01:01:38,429
He has been killed in an
encounter near Haji Ali.

But sir, one of our constables
Lakshman Dongre also got killed.

Sir, can you send some
people here? Thank you, sir.

912
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,466
You can keep the Rs.2.5 million.

913
01:02:10,103 --> 01:02:12,367
Do you think l'm a
corrupt policeman?

914
01:02:12,773 --> 01:02:14,434
Sorry. Sorry, sir.

915
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:16,099
l've never taken a bribe till now.

916
01:02:17,043 --> 01:02:18,101
Got it?

917
01:02:18,745 --> 01:02:19,837

Sir, it is worth Rs.25 million.

921
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:32,448
Will you take 25
million to your grave?

922
01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:34,690
What name should l register it to?

923
01:02:35,896 --> 01:02:37,830
Mrs. Nandini Talpade.

924
01:02:41,835 --> 01:02:44,030
Your sister has a
long life. Look. Look.

925
01:02:45,605 --> 01:02:47,402
Hello, Nandini. Yes.

Don't tell them anything.
But What should l not tell them?

931
01:03:09,529 --> 01:03:11,019
Don't tell them anything.
But..

932
01:03:11,097 --> 01:03:12,496
Don't tell them anything.

933
01:03:12,632 --> 01:03:13,690
Follow me.

Follow him.
Okay, follow..

936
01:03:21,508 --> 01:03:23,442
Where are you going?
Alright, then..

937
01:03:24,544 --> 01:03:26,478
He's a thief.
Yes, he looked like one.

938
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:29,581
The police are chasing him.
Yes, he told me.

939
01:03:30,784 --> 01:03:32,809
l saw him whisper
something into your ear from there.

940
01:03:32,886 --> 01:03:33,944
What did he tell you?

941
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:37,180
He told me not to tell you anything.

942
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:42,457
Look, l'm an inspector. You
shouldn't lie to the police.-No.

943
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:43,887
Tell me what he told you.

944
01:03:44,498 --> 01:03:46,898
He just told me not
to tell you anything.

945
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:52,199
l've been telling you to tell
the truth. What did he tell you?

946
01:03:52,472 --> 01:03:55,737
Sir, l swear he told me
not to tell you anything.

947
01:03:55,842 --> 01:03:57,639
Darn you! The same thing again.

and nothing but the truth

951
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:10,212
Sir, he told me not
to tell you anything.

952
01:04:17,764 --> 01:04:21,222
Hey, l'm taking a rest.
Okay.

953
01:04:21,635 --> 01:04:22,693
Okay.

Did you tell him anything?
Beep! Beep!

957
01:04:45,525 --> 01:04:46,787
He said something to you again.

958
01:04:47,527 --> 01:04:48,585
He did.

959
01:04:48,695 --> 01:04:49,753
What?

960
01:04:49,863 --> 01:04:50,921
No, sir.

961
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:53,192
You..
No, l'll tell you. l'll tell you.

962
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:54,528
Give me your ear.

963
01:04:55,535 --> 01:04:58,527
Beep! Beep!

01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:12,209
From there!

966
01:05:16,556 --> 01:05:18,751
Hello.
This is your watchman speaking.

01:05:19,225 --> 01:05:20,920
Hurry up!

968
01:05:23,563 --> 01:05:24,621
Sir! Sir!

the guy who meets Jahnvi.

970
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,631
He is right here.
Which one? Throw! Throw!

971
01:05:28,735 --> 01:05:30,225
The one who looks
like a hero. That's him.

972
01:05:30,303 --> 01:05:32,567
Pass. Pass. Yes. Yes. Radhe,

973
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:37,900
Everybody move back.

l have to search this guy.

975
01:05:41,247 --> 01:05:43,147
Didn't you hear me? Move back!

976
01:05:52,192 --> 01:05:55,252
You're the guy who found a
gun in the lane, aren't you?

977
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:56,590
You gave it back.

978
01:05:56,696 --> 01:05:59,324
Now that you found
the girl, you kept her?

979
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:16,205
What's this? What is this?

980
01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:19,713
You sell drugs?

981
01:06:21,721 --> 01:06:23,154
You're a drug dealer?

982
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:26,882
come to the police station with me.

983
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:30,185
For what?
For this.

984
01:06:32,132 --> 01:06:35,226
Where did it go?

985
01:06:35,301 --> 01:06:36,928
Stop. Stop.

986
01:06:40,006 --> 01:06:41,997
'You're wanted.''

987
01:06:42,642 --> 01:06:44,075
You're a drug dealer?

988
01:06:44,911 --> 01:06:45,969
'You're wanted.''

989
01:06:46,046 --> 01:06:49,709
You sell drugs?
lt's gone.

990
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,646
The headmaster of the school
where you learnt all these tricks..

991
01:06:56,723 --> 01:06:58,657
..comes to learn from me even today.

992
01:06:58,725 --> 01:07:02,821
She's mine. Only mine.
Do you understand?

993
01:07:03,663 --> 01:07:05,756
Yours? She's yours?

994
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,758
She's yours?

995
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:14,396
The gun l found that night was mine.

996
01:07:15,809 --> 01:07:18,073
Look, l still have the bullets.

997
01:07:20,046 --> 01:07:22,071
Are you threatening me?

998
01:07:22,248 --> 01:07:24,216
You have to
account for every bullet.

999
01:07:25,418 --> 01:07:29,115
l may shoot as many as l want.
l don't have to give any account.

1000
01:07:30,724 --> 01:07:32,692
l'll kill you in a
police encounter one day.

1001
01:07:33,827 --> 01:07:36,295
Do you think l'm the
constable from your police station?

1002
01:07:36,429 --> 01:07:37,794
Should l tell you
how you killed him?

1003
01:07:45,171 --> 01:07:48,436
A 2000 sq. ft. shop has been
registered in your wife's name.

1004
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:50,369
l don't want to argue with you.

1005
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:53,276
The construction is on fast track.
Go away.

1006
01:07:53,346 --> 01:07:54,973
Air conditioned.
Centrally air conditioned.

1007
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,279
Don't follow me. l warn you.

1008
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:58,917
You're using ltalian marble,
aren't you?

1009
01:08:00,019 --> 01:08:01,816
Nandini will be very
happy with you. - Go away.

1010
01:08:01,921 --> 01:08:03,718
l'll take care of you.
l won't spare you.

1011
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:05,052
l won't spare you.

1012
01:08:05,158 --> 01:08:06,819
You're messing up
with the wrong guy.

1013
01:08:07,093 --> 01:08:08,151
Let's go.
l'll take care of you.

1014
01:08:08,228 --> 01:08:11,459
Scoundrel!
Let's go. Come on.

1015
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:12,923
Oh, God!

1016
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:16,099
Jahnvi is mine. Only mine.

1017
01:08:16,236 --> 01:08:17,999
And l can do anything for her.

1018
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:34,277
Three. Four. Five.
Six. Seven. Eight. One..

1019
01:08:34,754 --> 01:08:35,812
Oh God!

1020
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:42,291
What's going on?
Hey, shut up! Shut up!

1021
01:08:45,765 --> 01:08:46,823
Who is that boyfriend of yours?

1022
01:08:47,801 --> 01:08:48,859
you want a real man?

1023
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:50,495
Am l not good enough?

1024
01:08:51,437 --> 01:08:53,200
Did your mom talk to you about me?

1025
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,871
You are mine.

1026
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:01,879
He says, ''Jahnvi is mine and
l can do anything for her.''

1027
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:08,083
lf you meet him again,
l'll kill you.

1028
01:09:15,328 --> 01:09:19,526
Jahnvi is mine and l
can do anything for her.

1029
01:09:26,806 --> 01:09:30,537
Sister, what you're
saying is fine, but..

1030
01:09:30,844 --> 01:09:32,038
He's a goon, isn't he?

1031
01:09:33,146 --> 01:09:34,443
But he's good at heart.

1032
01:09:35,348 --> 01:09:36,906
l'm sure l can change him.

1033
01:09:37,116 --> 01:09:38,549
Do you love him so much?

1034
01:09:42,822 --> 01:09:43,880
Yes.

1035
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:46,550
All right. But he will have to
bring chocolates for me everyday.

1036
01:09:51,831 --> 01:09:52,889
Hello?

1037
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:55,365

Hi, would-be mother. How are you.

1039
01:09:57,937 --> 01:10:00,929
This is Jahnvi's friend,
Madhuri, speaking.

1040
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,941
And this is Radhe's friend,
and your husband, Nene, speaking.

1041
01:10:06,913 --> 01:10:10,007
Sorry, this is Jahnvi speaking.

Why?

1044
01:10:28,268 --> 01:10:33,604
Actually, l wanted
to meet you because..

1045
01:10:34,374 --> 01:10:36,239
Don't beat around the bush.

1046
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:46,483
l wanted to say
something personal to you.

1047
01:10:47,987 --> 01:10:53,425
So, can we.. can we..

1048

Love me, love me, love me.

1049
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:15,479
Your mama says you love me.

1050
01:11:15,581 --> 01:11:17,572
Papa says you love me.

1051
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,584
Then love me, baby. Love me.

1052
01:11:19,652 --> 01:11:21,916
Love me, love me, love me.

1053

..that you don't have
any qualities that l like.

1111

Still, l don't know why l
think of you all the time.

1112
01:15:30,836 --> 01:15:35,239
Whenever l asked my
heart who's my Mr. Right..

But l haven't said
it to you until now..

1119
01:16:02,802 --> 01:16:04,633
..because l'm not worthy of you.

1120
01:16:05,204 --> 01:16:06,262
Why?

1121
01:16:07,506 --> 01:16:10,634

how big a scoundrel l am.

1122

But l like you very much.

1123
01:16:13,212 --> 01:16:14,270
Think again.

1124
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:18,940
Once l commit something, l
don't listen to myself even.

1125
01:16:33,599 --> 01:16:34,964
Close your eyes.

1126
01:16:38,337 --> 01:16:39,964

They must have
finished Radhe by now.

1132
01:19:06,786 --> 01:19:07,844
Take the call, rascal!

1133

l'm a murderer.

1137
01:20:40,546 --> 01:20:42,537
Would you still

'..12 dead bodies have been found.'

1144
01:21:42,237 --> 01:21:47,231
'Police are trying to find out
which gang they belonged to.'

1145
01:21:47,509 --> 01:21:50,501

Why?
They started it. l finished it.

1153

01:22:21,676 --> 01:22:24,201
Datta Pawale has killed Golden.

1155

1166

You have been disgraced.

1303
01:36:10,905 --> 01:36:12,099
Who will marry her now?

1304
01:36:15,709 --> 01:36:16,767
Don't worry.

A thorn pricked me.

1318
01:37:34,455 --> 01:37:36,446
A thorn pricked me.

1319
01:37:45,466 --> 01:37:46,524
Hey! Who is it?

1320
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:02,480
Who is it? Who was it?

1321
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:04,482
Stop.
Scoundrel!

1322
01:38:12,893 --> 01:38:16,158
Who is it? Who was it?

1323
01:38:25,839 --> 01:38:27,238
Who is it? Who was it?

1324
01:38:27,975 --> 01:38:29,033
Who is it?

1325
01:38:32,913 --> 01:38:34,778
Hello.
Scoundrel!

1326
01:38:35,516 --> 01:38:38,178
l just suspected it, so l
shed some of your blood.

1327
01:38:38,986 --> 01:38:40,510
The day it is confirmed..

1328
01:38:41,522 --> 01:38:43,513
..there'll be no
blood left in your body.

1329
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,648
Who are you?

1330
01:38:44,858 --> 01:38:45,916
Who are you?

1331
01:38:46,527 --> 01:38:47,585
Who are you?

1332
01:38:55,869 --> 01:38:56,927
Radhe.

1333
01:39:13,554 --> 01:39:14,612
Radhe.

1334
01:39:21,028 --> 01:39:22,620
Everyone is praising you.

1335
01:39:23,697 --> 01:39:24,891
Except him.

1336
01:39:26,033 --> 01:39:28,558
l hear you carry out dangerous
jobs with the snap of your fingers.

1337
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:31,299
You look like a romantic hero.

1338
01:39:31,905 --> 01:39:34,567
And you look like a
villain in a B-grade Hindi movie.

1339
01:39:37,978 --> 01:39:39,707
You have no idea how
villainous l can be.

1340
01:39:40,981 --> 01:39:42,642
What will you drink?
Nothing.

1341
01:39:43,717 --> 01:39:44,979
Don't be scared. Have it.

1342
01:39:45,052 --> 01:39:48,112
Liquor and blood. l
take it when l want it.

1343
01:39:48,589 --> 01:39:49,647
No holds barred.

1344
01:39:51,592 --> 01:39:53,253
He is exactly as you had told me.

1345
01:39:53,594 --> 01:39:56,290
Are you hurt? Then smile.
Don't shout.

1346
01:39:57,064 --> 01:39:58,656
lf you'd like to be a goon.

1347
01:40:00,267 --> 01:40:02,599
So, you're a rough guy.

1348
01:40:02,736 --> 01:40:03,794
And crazy as well.

1349
01:40:04,872 --> 01:40:06,806
You'll take
Golden's place from today.

1350
01:40:08,342 --> 01:40:11,334
You have to eliminate central
minister. This is your firstjob.

1351
01:40:12,279 --> 01:40:14,611
On 14th November, Children's day..

1352
01:40:14,681 --> 01:40:16,342
..the minister is
coming as a chief guest.

1353
01:40:17,017 --> 01:40:18,143
Blow him away with a bomb.

1354
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,678
And the kids?

1355
01:40:21,021 --> 01:40:22,079
What kids?

1356
01:40:22,356 --> 01:40:24,950
Those who will be
around the minister.

1357
01:40:26,627 --> 01:40:28,356
Kill them. This is my style.

1358
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:31,359
l don't kill women and kids.

1359
01:40:32,232 --> 01:40:33,290
Why?

1360
01:40:34,701 --> 01:40:35,759
That's my style.

1361
01:40:36,236 --> 01:40:37,897
lf you don't do it,
Genghis will do it.

1362
01:40:38,105 --> 01:40:42,098
Even if he were Genghis Khan,
l wouldn't allow him to do it.

1363
01:40:42,176 --> 01:40:43,234
Hey!

1364
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:47,838
Arrogance.

1365
01:40:47,981 --> 01:40:49,039
Such ego.

1366
01:40:49,316 --> 01:40:50,374
l like it.

1367
01:40:51,185 --> 01:40:53,380
Bring it down.
You'll be very successful.

1368
01:40:54,188 --> 01:40:55,712
Or else you'll go up there.

1369
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:57,652
Think about it.

1370
01:40:57,724 --> 01:41:02,320
Once l commit to something, l
don't listen to myself even.

1371
01:41:04,198 --> 01:41:06,063
Pour ke lo se (Spanish).

We should be
oblivious of the world.

There's a secret in the
intoxication of the night.

01:44:39,546 --> 01:44:43,277
There's opportunity.
There's excitement. Have fun.

1421

Come.

1431
01:45:43,276 --> 01:45:44,937
Ashraf Khan, you've made the
biggest mistake of your life..

1432
01:45:45,011 --> 01:45:47,411
..by arresting me.

1433
01:45:47,481 --> 01:45:48,539
lt's not a mistake.

1434
01:45:48,949 --> 01:45:52,009
lt's my life's
ambition to punish you.

1435
01:45:53,954 --> 01:45:57,082
You don't want to punish me.
You want something else.

1436
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:00,490
You want to cut a deal with me?

1437
01:46:01,228 --> 01:46:02,286
l'm giving you an opportunity.

1438
01:46:03,497 --> 01:46:05,431
You offer namaz five
times a day, don't you?

1439
01:46:06,433 --> 01:46:09,027
l kill five people
at that same time.

1440
01:46:10,036 --> 01:46:11,094
Look at my hand.

1441
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,971
lt is very charitable.

1442
01:46:16,243 --> 01:46:18,973
With this hand,
l've made millionaires..

1443
01:46:19,045 --> 01:46:20,239
..out of honest policemen.

1444
01:46:21,581 --> 01:46:24,516
Shake hands with me.
l'll make you filthy rich.

1445
01:46:26,653 --> 01:46:29,645
You've not faced a
strict police officer yet.

1446
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:32,982
The moment you come across
an honest police officer..

1447
01:46:33,994 --> 01:46:37,054
..you'll wet your pants.

1448
01:46:38,732 --> 01:46:39,994
lt's not wet.

1449
01:46:42,002 --> 01:46:43,401
ls it wet?. Then?

1450
01:46:46,006 --> 01:46:47,064
Listen, you fool.

1451
01:46:48,675 --> 01:46:50,666
You're only a police
commissioner of Mumbai.

1452
01:46:51,144 --> 01:46:53,009
l'm an international don.

1453
01:46:54,214 --> 01:46:57,149
Higher ranking
officers than you salute me.

1454
01:46:57,551 --> 01:47:03,012
l salute only the lndian Tricolour,
not a scoundrel like you.

1455
01:47:04,024 --> 01:47:06,686
You'll salute this
scoundrel one day.

1456
01:47:10,096 --> 01:47:12,030
l will. l'll surely salute you.

1457
01:47:13,033 --> 01:47:14,694
Listen, he's a big don.

1458
01:47:14,768 --> 01:47:16,702
See to it that he
is served properly.

1459
01:47:17,304 --> 01:47:20,034
Fulfil every wish of his,
but don't let him sleep.

1460
01:47:20,574 --> 01:47:23,042
Break his bones if
he tries to sleep.

1461
01:47:31,451 --> 01:47:32,577
l won't sleep.

1462
01:47:33,186 --> 01:47:34,448
l won't sleep.

1463
01:47:34,588 --> 01:47:37,580
My eyes will be open even if l die.

1464
01:47:44,064 --> 01:47:46,396
Sir.
Have You arrested Don Gani?

1465
01:47:46,466 --> 01:47:49,196
No, sir. How can l arrest Gani?

1466
01:47:49,269 --> 01:47:50,668
Not even lnterpol can do it.
Quiet!

1467
01:47:51,071 --> 01:47:54,734
l won't rest till l arrest him.

1468
01:47:55,275 --> 01:47:58,073
As soon as l arrest him,
l'll inform you.

1469
01:47:58,345 --> 01:47:59,403
Sir.

1470
01:48:01,081 --> 01:48:02,605
He said he didn't.
What?

1471
01:48:03,216 --> 01:48:05,810
He..
The minister had called.

1472
01:48:06,553 --> 01:48:08,282
Nobody should know that he's here.

1473
01:48:08,488 --> 01:48:09,614
Okay?
sir.

1474
01:48:11,091 --> 01:48:13,218
Hello.
Hello. Yes, This is Gani speaking.

1475
01:48:13,293 --> 01:48:14,487

Keep an eye on him. Understand?
Okay, sir.

1478
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:25,101
What's this nonsense?

1479
01:48:25,171 --> 01:48:26,763
Commissioner didn't
put Gani behind bars.

1480
01:48:27,374 --> 01:48:29,638
These high level tricks
are hard to understand.

1481
01:48:33,113 --> 01:48:35,240
Brother, do you want the
friend or the girl? - girl.

1482
01:48:57,137 --> 01:48:58,729
Yes, tell me.
Where are you?

1483
01:48:59,472 --> 01:49:01,133
Outside Andheri post office.

1484
01:49:01,408 --> 01:49:02,875
No. You're nearby.

1485
01:49:11,818 --> 01:49:13,809
l feel you're looking at me.

1486
01:49:21,895 --> 01:49:23,157
l'm at the post office.

1487
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:26,627
lf l truly love you,
then you're here.

1488
01:49:31,638 --> 01:49:33,629
Brother, what are you eating? Pilaf?

1489
01:49:34,307 --> 01:49:36,298
No, tobacco. Want some?

1490
01:49:36,843 --> 01:49:39,368
Find one more friend. He'll be
helpful while carrying your coffin.

1491
01:49:39,846 --> 01:49:40,904
You can have it then.

1492
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:47,243
So this is Andheri post office?

1493
01:49:48,321 --> 01:49:50,186
Go straight and take a right.
lt's near the railway station.

1494
01:49:50,924 --> 01:49:52,789
You said you're not here.

1495
01:49:55,929 --> 01:49:58,193
How would someone who
only knows to kill..

1496
01:49:58,264 --> 01:50:00,198
..understand someone's feelings?

1497
01:50:01,401 --> 01:50:04,598
lf you really love me,
you'd understand this.

1498
01:50:05,405 --> 01:50:06,599
Do you love someone?

1499
01:50:07,741 --> 01:50:09,606
l did till now. But now l don't.

1500
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:12,674
You are getting angry on a joke.

1501
01:50:13,613 --> 01:50:16,741
Would l dream that you are around?

1502
01:50:17,283 --> 01:50:19,217
This is why l hate you.

1503
01:50:19,886 --> 01:50:20,944
l hate you.

1504
01:50:21,354 --> 01:50:22,753
Why are you harassing me?

1505
01:50:23,556 --> 01:50:25,217
Go on. lt's time for
your aerobics class.

1506
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:26,683
Vent your anger over there.

1507
01:50:31,965 --> 01:50:33,227
Aslam.
Yes.

1508
01:50:33,433 --> 01:50:35,230
ls your girl like her?
How?

1509
01:50:35,301 --> 01:50:36,359
Emotional.

1510
01:50:36,703 --> 01:50:38,227
Having a girlfriend is a bad thing.

1511
01:50:38,438 --> 01:50:39,496
Waste of time.

1512
01:50:39,839 --> 01:50:42,239
You'd better have a
pet than a girlfriend.

1513
01:50:47,514 --> 01:50:48,708
l'll do just what you said.

1514
01:50:48,982 --> 01:50:50,643
l'll never meet you again.

1515
01:50:51,718 --> 01:50:52,844
Tell her to go.

1516
01:50:52,919 --> 01:50:55,251
She keeps appearing
like advertisements on TV.

1517
01:50:55,789 --> 01:50:57,780
Tell her.
she already left.

1518
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:02,525
She didn't leave. She is fuming.

1519
01:51:22,816 --> 01:51:26,274
Scoundrel! Why did you
come back to Mumbai?

1520
01:51:27,287 --> 01:51:28,345
What's your plan?

1521
01:51:28,822 --> 01:51:30,289
Speak! Answer me!

1522
01:51:31,491 --> 01:51:34,756
The plan is in my head.
Let go of my hair.

1523
01:51:35,562 --> 01:51:37,359
You may be a big don for the world..

1524
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:39,694
..but you're nothing for me.

1525
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:43,292
l can kill you like this.
Then do it.

1526
01:51:43,503 --> 01:51:44,561
Kill me. Why don't you?

1527
01:51:45,305 --> 01:51:46,704
l'll tell you what you can do.

1528
01:51:47,907 --> 01:51:51,308
At the most you can
present me in court. That's it.

1529
01:51:51,377 --> 01:51:52,435
Nothing else.

1530
01:51:53,446 --> 01:51:55,038
You know what l'll say in court?

1531
01:51:56,382 --> 01:52:00,785
l'll tell the court that Amitabh
Bachchan is a good friend of mine.

1532
01:52:02,322 --> 01:52:04,313
And Shah Rukh Khan is
my business partner.

1533
01:52:04,724 --> 01:52:07,318
We had met at a wedding in London.
l have video evidence.

1534
01:52:08,595 --> 01:52:11,393
lt's different that l
have no relations with them.

1535
01:52:11,731 --> 01:52:16,668
But it will take ten
years to prove this in court.

1536
01:52:17,003 --> 01:52:18,061
Yes.

1537
01:52:24,811 --> 01:52:25,869
What are you thinking?

1538
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:27,537
lt's not too late.

1539
01:52:27,747 --> 01:52:30,477
Cut a deal.
Scoundrel!

1540
01:52:31,084 --> 01:52:33,348
You talk of striking
a deal all the time.

1541
01:52:34,087 --> 01:52:37,545
Did you strike a deal with
your mother to bring you out?

1542
01:52:40,693 --> 01:52:42,354
l was too small. l don't remember.

1543
01:52:49,435 --> 01:52:51,369
l think he's very angry with me.

1544
01:52:51,905 --> 01:52:54,032
lt is Churchgate local..

1545
01:52:54,107 --> 01:52:55,369
Hey let's go!

1546
01:52:55,975 --> 01:52:57,033
Where are you going?

1547
01:52:57,110 --> 01:52:58,441
lt will stop on all the stations.

1548
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:06,041
Oh you missed the catch.

1549
01:53:13,393 --> 01:53:17,386
Hot tea! Hot tea!

1550
01:53:17,463 --> 01:53:21,399
Hot tea! Hot tea!

1551
01:53:21,467 --> 01:53:22,525
Sir, would you like some hot tea?

1552
01:53:23,069 --> 01:53:25,537
Chhotu, give me a cup of tea.
Yes.

1553
01:53:26,873 --> 01:53:27,931
Go away!

1554
01:53:28,007 --> 01:53:29,065
Don't sell tea here.

1555
01:53:29,676 --> 01:53:31,405
Hot tea. Hot tea.

1556
01:53:31,477 --> 01:53:32,535
l've been sitting
here since a while.

1557
01:53:34,881 --> 01:53:37,406
The train has been delayed.
ls it my fault?

1558
01:53:39,419 --> 01:53:40,818
Why are you doing this to me?

1559
01:53:41,621 --> 01:53:43,020
Why don't you give it all up?

1560
01:53:43,756 --> 01:53:46,418
Why don't you leave
your loafer friends?

1561
01:53:47,493 --> 01:53:48,551
They are my friends.

1562
01:53:49,429 --> 01:53:52,489
They are not like cigarettes that
you throw after you're done smoking.

1563
01:53:53,967 --> 01:53:56,959
l'm not a balloon that you let
go after filling it with air.

1564
01:53:57,704 --> 01:54:00,696
Balloon?
l mean l'm not a chewing gum..

1565
01:54:00,773 --> 01:54:02,035
..that you open it,
chew it and spit it out.

1566
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:09,111
When did l open it?
When did l chew it?

1567
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:11,576
You talk about spitting it?

1568
01:54:12,785 --> 01:54:14,446
What have you done for me till now?

1569
01:54:15,455 --> 01:54:18,447
Pasta. Pasta. The whole
family lives on pasta.

1570
01:54:18,725 --> 01:54:22,923
Have you ever asked me?
Listen, have some pasta.

1571
01:54:23,463 --> 01:54:24,521
No.

1572
01:54:26,065 --> 01:54:27,589
You want to spend your life with me?

1573
01:54:28,468 --> 01:54:29,662
Do you know how l live?

Then eat. Eat me. Eat me!

1588

lf you don't release Gani..

1606
01:58:29,308 --> 01:58:32,835
..the whole world will see this
CD on TV, internet and cell phone.

1607
01:58:32,979 --> 01:58:34,037

1608
01:58:40,853 --> 01:58:43,913
Scoundrel! Don't spare him.

1609

The commissioner will not sleep

..we'll kill you daughter.

1618
01:59:27,433 --> 01:59:29,765
Being a woman, you don't
respect another woman.

1619
01:59:30,503 --> 01:59:31,765
What kind of a woman are you?

1620

Don't touch me.

You had come to our
house and troubled my sister.

Fatso, what will you do?

Why are you hitting me?

1649
02:01:21,547 --> 02:01:22,878
You will stop us?

1650
02:01:23,215 --> 02:01:25,877

Sweetheart, Radhe is the
right guy for you, not me.

02:04:04,643 --> 02:04:06,042
Forget me if you can.

1661

1751
02:09:30,502 --> 02:09:31,764
Who is your son?

1752
02:09:32,971 --> 02:09:35,769
Answer me! Who is your son?

1753
02:09:35,908 --> 02:09:37,637
Rajveer Shekhawat!

1754
02:09:38,043 --> 02:09:44,039
lPS! lndian Police Service!

1755
02:09:44,383 --> 02:09:46,442
Batch No. 57!

1756
02:09:52,524 --> 02:09:56,051
Cadet No.32567!

1757
02:09:58,664 --> 02:10:00,393
Trained at Dehradun!

1758
02:10:06,672 --> 02:10:08,003
Topper of the batch!

1759
02:10:10,809 --> 02:10:14,074
Got it? Rajveer Shekhawat! lPS.

1760
02:10:14,146 --> 02:10:16,410
Son of Shrikant Shekhwat!

1761
02:10:16,615 --> 02:10:18,810
l vow on God..

1762
02:10:18,884 --> 02:10:22,877
..that l'll be honest
towards the law of the country.

1763
02:10:23,088 --> 02:10:24,419
He is my son.

1764
02:10:24,690 --> 02:10:25,748
My son.

1765
02:10:33,165 --> 02:10:34,632
l'm proud of him!

1766
02:10:34,967 --> 02:10:38,835
What more would a
father want from his son?

1767
02:10:39,504 --> 02:10:42,962
Only a police officer
can feel this happiness.

1768
02:10:43,175 --> 02:10:45,439
Not a scoundrel like you.

1769
02:10:46,445 --> 02:10:47,503
Ain't l right?

1770
02:10:47,846 --> 02:10:48,972
Absolutely right.

1771
02:10:50,182 --> 02:10:51,444
Where is he at the moment?

1772
02:10:51,650 --> 02:10:55,586
He is undercover.
24 hours. 365 days.

1773
02:10:56,588 --> 02:10:57,646
Don't..

1774
02:10:58,590 --> 02:11:01,457
Where is he now? What is he doing?

1775
02:11:04,596 --> 02:11:05,654
He is on a mission.

1776
02:11:07,532 --> 02:11:10,797
To free this nation
of viruses like you.

1777
02:11:12,070 --> 02:11:14,470
Criminals like you are violating..

1778
02:11:14,539 --> 02:11:19,135
..the courts, law, order
and justice of this nation.

1779
02:11:19,745 --> 02:11:20,803
He is finishing them off.

1780
02:11:24,616 --> 02:11:25,878
What has he done?

1781
02:11:26,485 --> 02:11:27,816
He couldn't touch me.

1782
02:11:27,953 --> 02:11:29,477
Here l am in lndia.

1783
02:11:31,089 --> 02:11:32,556
You didn't come on
your own free will.

1784
02:11:33,558 --> 02:11:34,616
You were forced to come here.

1785
02:11:36,028 --> 02:11:39,828
My son killed your right hand.

1786
02:11:49,508 --> 02:11:52,170
So that you're
forced to come to lndia.

1787
02:11:55,847 --> 02:11:56,905
Master plan.

1788
02:11:58,517 --> 02:11:59,575
Yes?

1789
02:12:17,936 --> 02:12:22,066
So either of us will live?

1790
02:12:25,210 --> 02:12:27,940
One patriot is in front of me.

1791
02:12:29,548 --> 02:12:30,810
Where's the other one?

1792
02:12:31,283 --> 02:12:34,878
You'll kill me if l tell you.

1793
02:12:35,821 --> 02:12:39,222
And you'll kill me even if l don't.

1794
02:12:41,226 --> 02:12:42,887
But don't worry.

1795
02:12:44,296 --> 02:12:47,697
You'll die in front of his eyes.

1796
02:12:48,166 --> 02:12:49,565
He will kill you.

1797
02:12:50,702 --> 02:12:55,571
He will stand in front of you.
He will look you in the eye.

1798
02:12:56,908 --> 02:13:00,708
So, you're scared of death,
aren't you?

1799
02:13:02,781 --> 02:13:07,582
Remember one thing,
the moment you kill me..

1800
02:13:07,652 --> 02:13:13,591
.. the countdown to
your death will begin.

1801
02:13:15,127 --> 02:13:16,788
None of you will live.

1802
02:13:18,130 --> 02:13:19,256
He'll kill all of you.

1803
02:13:21,133 --> 02:13:22,862
lt's 12th November today.

1804
02:13:24,603 --> 02:13:25,865
The day l die.

1805
02:13:27,806 --> 02:13:32,607
Tomorrow, it will be 13th November.
The day you die.

1806
02:13:38,150 --> 02:13:40,015
Nice meeting you,
Mr. Shrikant Shekhawat.

1807
02:13:41,353 --> 02:13:42,615
Nice meeting you.

1808
02:13:45,357 --> 02:13:46,619
All right, tell me something.

1809
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:50,628
Will your son come to
cry over your dead body?

1810
02:13:51,963 --> 02:13:54,158
Or he will hide away out of fear?

1811
02:13:54,966 --> 02:13:57,230
He's a real man. He'll surely come.

1812
02:14:17,389 --> 02:14:19,323
Tell me.
there are policemen everywhere.

1813
02:14:19,391 --> 02:14:20,653
How do we kill him?

1814
02:14:21,193 --> 02:14:23,252
Don't even attempt
to do such a thing.

1815
02:14:23,328 --> 02:14:24,386
Did you find out who he is?

1816
02:14:24,863 --> 02:14:25,921
No.

1817
02:14:39,744 --> 02:14:40,802
Oh, my God!

1818
02:14:43,014 --> 02:14:44,072
Him?

1819
02:14:44,416 --> 02:14:45,678
Move! Move!

1820
02:15:36,334 --> 02:15:43,740
O Lord.

1821
02:15:46,411 --> 02:15:53,749
O Lord.

1822
02:15:56,755 --> 02:15:58,746
O Lord.

1823
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:12,762
O Lord.

1824
02:16:17,042 --> 02:16:19,772
O Lord.

1825
02:16:49,808 --> 02:16:51,867
'A person lives on his own terms.'

1826
02:16:51,943 --> 02:16:55,401
'Fight courageously
while performing your duty.'

1827
02:16:56,348 --> 02:16:57,542
'This is the right path.'

1828
02:16:57,816 --> 02:17:00,808
'l'll be proud to call
you a good police officer..

1829
02:17:00,885 --> 02:17:02,819
..rather than a good son.'

1830
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:06,821
'To annihilate crime
should be your life's ambition.'

1831
02:17:06,891 --> 02:17:09,086
'Alone, you're equal to an army.'

1832
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:10,821
'You're a one man army.'

1833
02:17:11,096 --> 02:17:13,564
'Serve the people.
Die for your country.'

1834
02:17:13,832 --> 02:17:15,026
'Live like a legend.'

1835
02:17:20,839 --> 02:17:21,897
'Hail lndia.'

1836
02:17:35,854 --> 02:17:38,846
He is still here. As soon as
he leaves here, l'll call you.

1837
02:17:39,190 --> 02:17:40,248
Okay.

1838
02:17:40,458 --> 02:17:44,451
Gani deserves to die.

1839
02:17:46,064 --> 02:17:49,864
He should suffer so
much while dying..

1840
02:17:49,934 --> 02:17:52,528
..that even death gets afraid.

1841
02:17:52,604 --> 02:17:54,868
Scoundrel! l didn't
know he's an lPS officer.

1842
02:17:54,939 --> 02:17:56,065
And l told him everything.

1843
02:17:56,274 --> 02:18:00,335
Sir, he'll change his plan.
Because he told me about it.

1844
02:18:00,545 --> 02:18:02,137
Yes, he'll think along these lines.

1845
02:18:02,213 --> 02:18:03,874
But l'll not change the plan.

1846
02:18:03,948 --> 02:18:07,611
November 14th. He'll get
this job done by someone else.

1847
02:18:07,886 --> 02:18:10,013
November 14th is my day.

1848
02:18:10,088 --> 02:18:12,022
Everything will go as per my plan.

1849
02:18:12,157 --> 02:18:14,887
He knows the plan. So only the
location will change, not the plan.

1850
02:18:15,293 --> 02:18:16,885
Move! Move! Move, everyone!

1851
02:18:18,096 --> 02:18:23,898
He still has my daughter.

1852
02:18:24,235 --> 02:18:25,293
l'll go there, sir.

1853
02:18:26,237 --> 02:18:27,898
Nothing will
happen to your daughter.

1854
02:18:34,913 --> 02:18:38,508
l'll kill or get killed.

1855
02:18:41,653 --> 02:18:43,587
Think of me being a
criminal for one more day.

1856
02:19:02,273 --> 02:19:03,934
Me?
Yes, you.

1857
02:19:06,945 --> 02:19:08,003
Yes, sir?

1858
02:19:12,951 --> 02:19:14,543
Sir.. sir everyone is watching.

1859
02:19:20,425 --> 02:19:21,483
Yes, sir?

1860
02:19:21,559 --> 02:19:26,292
Will you perform your duty
or should l free you of it?

1861
02:19:26,698 --> 02:19:29,428
l didn't get you.

1862
02:19:33,972 --> 02:19:35,371
Where is he?
Who?

1863
02:19:37,642 --> 02:19:39,576
Gani. Your boss.

1864
02:19:39,978 --> 02:19:41,036
l..

1865
02:19:43,581 --> 02:19:44,639
l..

1866
02:19:53,992 --> 02:19:55,983
Ask him where he is.

1867
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:57,584
Boss..

1868
02:19:59,531 --> 02:20:01,055
Ask him where he is.

1869
02:20:01,733 --> 02:20:04,201
Hello, Talpade.
Hello, Don Gani.

1870
02:20:04,469 --> 02:20:05,993
Yes, tell me. Did he leave?

1871
02:20:06,070 --> 02:20:08,402
No. No. l'll inform
you when he leaves.

1872
02:20:08,473 --> 02:20:13,001
Are you safe? Don't enter the city.

1873
02:20:13,077 --> 02:20:15,204
Don't teach me. l'm safe.

1874
02:20:15,613 --> 02:20:17,478
ln which safe place are you?

1875
02:20:18,016 --> 02:20:21,417
Binny Mills. - Okay. l'll
call you later. - Move! Move!

1876
02:20:21,486 --> 02:20:22,544
Yes. Yes.

1877
02:20:35,033 --> 02:20:36,432
Hello, Don Gani.
Yes, tell me.

1878
02:20:36,501 --> 02:20:38,025
He.. he has come.

1879
02:20:38,369 --> 02:20:39,495
Where?
Binny Mills.

1880
02:20:40,038 --> 02:20:42,029
Who told him l'm here?
l did.

1881
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:44,037
ldiot! Fool!

1882
02:20:44,108 --> 02:20:45,166
Why did you tell him?

1883
02:20:45,243 --> 02:20:47,438
When you called, he was with
me and his gun at my temple.

1884
02:20:47,645 --> 02:20:48,703
What could l have done?

1885
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:50,042
Where is he now?

1886
02:20:51,049 --> 02:20:52,107
He has entered the mill.

1887
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:54,514
He is here. Come on! Move!

1888
02:20:55,386 --> 02:20:56,717
Come on! Move!

1889
02:21:35,627 --> 02:21:37,356
Boss, he is right in front of me.
Kill! Kill him!

1890
02:21:37,562 --> 02:21:39,553
How much will you pay to kill him?
have you eve counted 10 million?

1891
02:21:40,098 --> 02:21:41,622
l'll pay you Rs.50 million.
Kill him.

1892
02:24:11,249 --> 02:24:14,241
Boss! Over there!

1893
02:24:32,270 --> 02:24:34,261
Come on, kill! Kill him!

1894
02:24:37,742 --> 02:24:38,800
No!

1895
02:24:38,876 --> 02:24:39,934
No!

1896
02:24:40,478 --> 02:24:41,877
Darn it! Scoundrel!

1897
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:50,678
You..

1898
02:24:51,823 --> 02:24:54,291
Kill him! Kill him!

1899
02:24:59,964 --> 02:25:01,022
Go!

1900
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:43,602
Kill him! Kill him!

1901
02:26:50,675 --> 02:26:54,406
'The moment you come across
a honest police officer..'

1902
02:26:54,478 --> 02:26:57,675
'..you'll wet your pants.'

1903
02:27:07,024 --> 02:27:09,015
Darn you! You killed everyone?

1904
02:27:10,828 --> 02:27:11,886
You killed everyone.

1905
02:27:12,897 --> 02:27:14,888
Can't you differentiate
between animals and humans?

1906
02:27:16,701 --> 02:27:20,432
They're criminals. Such
men are so rare to find.

1907
02:27:21,038 --> 02:27:22,437
l've nurtured them for years.

1908
02:27:23,441 --> 02:27:25,705
l searched and picked
each one from the streets.

1909
02:27:28,579 --> 02:27:30,444
Anyone can become a policeman.

1910
02:27:31,449 --> 02:27:32,507
l can make hundreds of
policemen like you ..

1911
02:27:32,583 --> 02:27:34,107
..stand in front of
me tomorrow morning.

1912
02:27:34,185 --> 02:27:35,447
Where will l get them?

1913
02:27:39,123 --> 02:27:40,181
Darn you!

1914
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:04,672
Stop it, man. Stop it.

1915
02:28:04,815 --> 02:28:06,476
You're overdoing it. Stop it.

1916
02:28:07,218 --> 02:28:09,482
You're too much.

1917
02:28:10,755 --> 02:28:12,484
Why are you killing a murderer?

1918
02:28:13,491 --> 02:28:14,549
Who are you?

1919
02:28:18,162 --> 02:28:19,561
What do you want?

1920
02:28:20,498 --> 02:28:23,490
l'll give you whatever you want.
Justjoin hands with me.

1921
02:28:24,635 --> 02:28:27,502
How much will you
get in a police job?

1922
02:28:28,105 --> 02:28:29,504
lf you die on duty..

1923
02:28:29,573 --> 02:28:32,508
..the government will give
Rs.50000 to your family.

1924
02:28:32,576 --> 02:28:33,634
That's it.

1925
02:28:34,045 --> 02:28:36,513
