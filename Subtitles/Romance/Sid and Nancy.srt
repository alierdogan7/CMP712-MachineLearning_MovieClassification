Oh, god, if you were earning half
of what you were worth,

524
00:34:37,729 --> 00:34:40,188
you'd buy your mom
a fucking army.

525
00:34:40,189 --> 00:34:42,733
Well, why don't you shut
your fucking mouth?

526
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:45,235
If it weren't
for me mum's kindness,

527
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:47,738
we'd be on
the fucking streets!

528
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:50,198
Yeah? And if it weren't
for your own stupidity,

529
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,243
we'd be living in our own
apartment in Paris, France.

530
00:34:53,244 --> 00:34:55,704
Get off the fucking bed!
No!

531
00:34:55,705 --> 00:34:57,748
Look at this shit!
Can you believe this?

532
00:34:57,749 --> 00:34:59,708
[Whooping]
Okay, look. Stop it now.

533
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:02,252
Come on, we've both had fun now.
Take that off. It's my mummy's.

534
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:05,505
Look, it will tear.
Oh, I thought it was yours. Ow!

535
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:09,259
Fuck you! Just piss off when
the going gets tough?

536
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,261
Fuck you!
Insult me only fucking mother!

537
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:13,680
Fuck you both.
You love her more than me!

538
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,682
Yeah, I fucking do and all!

539
00:35:15,683 --> 00:35:18,685
You mama's boy,
you asshole!

540
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:21,688
You...
[screams] [Laughing]

541
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:23,732
Sid! Sid!
What?

542
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:28,737
Look at me! I look like fucking
Stevie Nicks in hippie clothes.

543
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:31,781
No, you look nice.
You look nice. [Shouting]

544
00:35:31,782 --> 00:35:35,785
No, yuck!
Ew! Help me!

545
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:39,164
[Nancy screaming]

546
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:44,209
[Sniffing]

547
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:58,725
[Linda] hello, John. What are you doing
up so early in the afternoon?

548
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:01,227
I've come to see my best mate.

549
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:06,232
He's in his boudoir.
Is he out of it?

550
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,234
Hey, Linda.

551
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:11,279
You know you've got a man
hangin' from your ceiling?

552
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,240
Don't mind him. He's one of
my customers, Edward.

553
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:18,745
Just abuse him now and again,
and he'll be as good as gold.

554
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:21,747
Don't hurt me,
for god's sake. Don't hurt me.

555
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:25,751
I'll do anything you want,
but I implore you not to hurt me, please.

556
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:28,254
- [Gasps]
- [Laughing]

557
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:31,799
Sidney, wakey, wakey.

558
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,762
Sid, wake up, dear.

559
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:39,265
Sidney, wake up.

560
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:41,767
Fuck off, John.

561
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:45,271
Oh, I'm sorry I kicked you,
Sidney. It was an accident.

562
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:50,276
[Nancy]
Leave us alone.

563
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:55,281
Look, I've got two tickets
for rock head at the rainbow.

564
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:57,283
It'll do you good
to go and see him.

565
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:59,785
I hear he's
cleaned up his act.

566
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:03,289
He don't do any drugs
or drink... hardly.

567
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,292
And he's all
the better for it.

568
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:09,753
I know rock head.
I bet you do.

569
00:37:09,754 --> 00:37:13,299
Rock head's
got the best drugs.

570
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,760
Let's go see rock head.

571
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:18,762
Hey, John, mate,

572
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:20,806
make us a cup of tea.

573
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:22,766
[Laughing]

574
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:28,270
You're funny.
[Laughing]

575
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:31,817
I don't even want to be here.
[Pistols firing]

576
00:37:31,818 --> 00:37:38,240
[Whooping]
[Yelling]

577
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:40,242
Yes, madam.

578
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:43,287
The Sex Pistols
for mr. Head.

579
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:45,747
What a fuckin' palace.

580
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:50,294
I wish I lived here.
Mr. Head's room, please.

581
00:37:50,295 --> 00:37:52,796
[Classical piano]

582
00:37:52,797 --> 00:37:55,340
[Nancy]
Rock.

583
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:58,301
Rock, you big head.

584
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:00,303
Hi, uh...

585
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:03,724
Peggy, ain't it?
Nancy.

586
00:38:03,725 --> 00:38:07,728
And this is Sid Vicious
and Johnny .

587
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:10,313
They're
from the Sex Pistols.

588
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:12,774
Impress them with your drugs.
[Glass breaking]

589
00:38:12,775 --> 00:38:15,819
Drugs?
Do we have any drugs, boys?

590
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,280
Rock head
does not do drugs.

591
00:38:18,281 --> 00:38:22,784
Right.
Don't be so fucking stingy.

592
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:26,288
Pull out the drawer.
We'll have a bible reading.

593
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:28,790
Give me five pounds.
Fuck off.

594
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:30,792
Uh, look,
you want some water?

595
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:32,794
I got some
with bubbles in it.

596
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:36,798
How about some room service, Mr. Head?
Fuck off.

597
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:39,759
Uh, Jennifer,
ring for the cart.

598
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,347
Fuck him, Sidney. His drugs were
garbage anyway. They were not.

599
00:38:44,348 --> 00:38:48,351
Lend us five pounds.
Hello, room service.

600
00:38:48,352 --> 00:38:53,731
[Continues]

601
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:57,277
[Pistol fires]

602
00:38:57,278 --> 00:39:02,282
So, it appears
we are related.

603
00:39:02,283 --> 00:39:04,284
[Burping]
Eh?

604
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:06,327
The press, they're calling me
the big daddy of punk.

605
00:39:06,328 --> 00:39:09,789
Your role model.

606
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,834
[Chuckling]
Lovely couple.

607
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:16,254
Fuck you, rock head.

608
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:18,840
What the fuck are you doing here anyway?
[Pistol fires]

609
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:21,843
I'm gonna fucking puke.
[Burps]

610
00:39:21,844 --> 00:39:23,803
[Glass breaking]

611
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:27,849
[Paul] For christ's sake, malcolm.
I know we're not great shakes,

612
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,268
but the bass player
has to keep the beat.

613
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:32,270
We have to turn his amp off
half the time.

614
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:34,272
He'll be playing one thing,
we'll be playing a-fucking-nother.

615
00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:37,316
Lads, I sympathize.

616
00:39:37,317 --> 00:39:39,360
But Sidney's more than
a mere bass player.

617
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:41,821
He's a fabulous disaster.

618
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:44,323
He's a symbol,
a metaphor.

619
00:39:44,324 --> 00:39:48,828
[Ringing] He embodies the dementia
of a nihilistic generation.

620
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:50,788
He's a fucking star.

621
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,832
[Continues ringing]
[John] He's a fucking head case.

622
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:56,335
Shut up.
[Malcom] Phoebe!

623
00:39:56,336 --> 00:39:58,379
[John]
You know, I've talked some shit.

624
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,798
[Malcom muttering]

625
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:03,801
Yeah.
Sidney's not the problem.

626
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:07,388
The problem, as you are all aware...
it's "spunkin."

627
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:10,307
She wants you
to book them a suite at...

628
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:13,310
Uh, where?
[Paul] I want a suite as well.

629
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,854
Rock Head's hotel.

630
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:17,856
They can't stay here
much longer.

631
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:21,568
The police were
around here yesterday.

632
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:25,322
Arrests were made,
substances confiscated.

633
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:28,325
They've even been hanging
out of the windows! What rubbish.

634
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:32,329
This is a respectable hotel, madam.
Lillie Langtry has stayed here.

635
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,873
[Punk]
[Nancy] Baby!

636
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:37,334
Hi!
[Laughs]

637
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,838
Sid. Sid,
we've got company.

638
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,798
We gotta go.

639
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:47,803
Let me up. Whoa!

640
00:40:47,804 --> 00:40:50,847
Sid! Nancy!

641
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:55,309
Sid!

642
00:40:56,813 --> 00:41:00,357
[Grunts]

643
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,903
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are. I'm loaded.

644
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:06,863
[Both giggling]

645
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:11,910
Are you all right, Nancy?
Oh, yeah. We're just having fun.

646
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:14,871
It's lurch.
You want a cup of tea?

647
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,375
Get us a cup of tea!
[Sid] More sugar, if you can.

648
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,877
We have no roof service.

649
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,171
You're dead.
Look, we ain't got time for tea.

650
00:41:23,172 --> 00:41:25,382
He's got to practice.
He's got a tour coming up.

651
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,342
No.
No, I don't wanna go.

652
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:34,389
I wanna stay here and have really good
screwing bye-byes. Sid. Sid.

653
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,352
Four words...

654
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:40,855
no women on the tour.

655
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:43,441
That's five words.

656
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:45,652
No way, Malcolm.

657
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:49,823
No fucking way.

658
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,866
Yeah, right.

659
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:53,868
There's no way.

660
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:57,831
[Phoebe] Look, it's purely financial.
We can't afford... an entourage.

661
00:41:57,832 --> 00:42:00,291
I'm not an entourage.

662
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:03,836
I know what you're feeling.
I know how important your relationship is.

663
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:05,838
But if you two
wanna stay together,

664
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,882
we'll just have to find
another bass player.

665
00:42:07,883 --> 00:42:11,886
Sid Vicious is the Sex Pistols.

666
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:13,846
Bollocks.

667
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:16,349
Oh, yeah,
that's right.

668
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,893
You can't leave me behind.

669
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:21,145
Paul wouldn't stand for it.

670
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:23,356
We're the rhythm section.

671
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:28,359
Paul.

672
00:42:30,364 --> 00:42:32,824
Look, it's only a month.

673
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:34,867
You can live that long
without each other, can't you?

674
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:39,372
[Chuckling]
And if you do survive,

675
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:42,875
I have been talking
to the record company.

676
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:46,420
They're going to buy you
a little house.

677
00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:48,381
Oh.

678
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:51,384
How lovely for you.

679
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:54,428
You think I'm an asshole,
don't you? Yes, I do.

680
00:42:54,429 --> 00:43:00,393
You really think
you can buy Sid off of me?

681
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:04,854
Fuck you.

682
00:43:04,855 --> 00:43:06,856
Take him.

683
00:43:06,857 --> 00:43:09,859
I only want
what's best for Sidney.

684
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,405
I don't wanna go
on your fucking tour anyhow.

685
00:43:14,406 --> 00:43:19,827
I got my own stuff to do.

686
00:43:19,828 --> 00:43:21,871
Paul.

687
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:24,123
[Burps]

688
00:43:24,124 --> 00:43:28,834
Paul.

689
00:43:33,258 --> 00:43:38,761
[Sid coughing]

690
00:43:38,805 --> 00:43:40,848
[Moaning]

691
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:43,267
Sid.

692
00:43:43,268 --> 00:43:45,853
What are you doing?

693
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:48,772
Sid.

00:54:52,598 --> 00:54:54,599
[Phoebe]
Well, it's a bit late for that, isn't it?

869
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,186
Malcolm's in London.
Paul and Steve are flying to Rio.

870
00:54:58,187 --> 00:55:01,606
- John's in New York.
- Yeah, great. What am I gonna do?

871
00:55:01,607 --> 00:55:07,610
Anything you like.
You're a free agent now.

872
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:10,114
I'm going...

873
00:55:10,115 --> 00:55:12,116
to see Nancy.

874
00:55:12,117 --> 00:55:15,119
Yeah, we'll do that.

875
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,079
Master kung fu.

876
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,625
Well, try and get off
of heroin, eh?

877
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:23,085
Come on, promise.
Okay.

878
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:29,091
And cut down on the drinking as well.
All right, I promise.

879
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:33,594
Cross me heart
and hope to die.

880
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:36,140
[Blues]

881
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:40,686
Your double brandy, sir.
That evil, big-city doctor

882
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:47,650
when he walked by
I get the burn

883
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:54,617
yeah, that evil
big-city doctor

884
00:55:54,618 --> 00:56:00,663
he give me the burn

885
00:56:02,918 --> 00:56:05,961
[Mman on TV] Pop star Sid Vicious landed
unexpectedly today at la guardia airport...

886
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,922
and was rushed
to a nearby hospital.

887
00:56:07,923 --> 00:56:11,258
A spokesman
for his record company said...

888
00:56:11,259 --> 00:56:14,470
Vicious was suffering
from nervous exhaustion.

889
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:20,432
[Indistinct]

890
00:56:29,944 --> 00:56:34,905
[Screaming]

891
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:48,920
A hippie! Sid,
it's a french hippie.

892
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:52,424
[Sid's voice] Dear mum, guess where
your Simon's turned up?

893
00:56:52,425 --> 00:56:54,426
- Since you can't guess, I will tell you.
-  Personal life, man.

894
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:57,429
[Nancy's voice]
Paris, in the spring. Oh, and the Eiffel Tower!

895
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,473
Sid's recording here,
and he's brilliant.

896
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:01,892
We go shopping every day.

897
00:57:01,893 --> 00:57:07,939
Sid bought me lots of underwear,
and it's all French. You'd love it here.

898
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,943
Lots of love, from Nancy and Sid.
Nancy! Sid!

899
00:57:11,944 --> 00:57:14,988
Sidney, long time no see.
Hugh Kares. [Coughing]

900
00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:17,449
We met at trumps.
You remember. Huh?

901
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,451
No, he doesn't.
Sid...

902
00:57:19,452 --> 00:57:21,953
this is
my girlfriend, Nancy.

903
00:57:21,954 --> 00:57:24,456
Hi, Nancy.
Let's go.

904
00:57:24,457 --> 00:57:27,417
Let's take lunch,
you know, go to...

905
00:57:27,418 --> 00:57:29,419
get yourself a chair
and sit down, shut up.

906
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:33,923
Everything's crazy for me right now, but
I've always got time for you, babe.

907
00:57:33,924 --> 00:57:37,385
Oh! Ooh! Oh, Jesus Christ. Get it out.

908
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:40,930
Get it out, Sidney.
That's all right. That's all right.

909
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:43,975
Oh, dude! Get it all out.
Come on. Oh, Jeez. [Sid coughing]

910
00:57:43,976 --> 00:57:46,936
When you're feeling better...
he's feeling fine.

911
00:57:46,937 --> 00:57:49,981
You're making him sick.
Sid, let's go. When you're feeling better...

912
00:57:49,982 --> 00:57:52,442
fuck him. We'll leave him
with the check.

913
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:58,947
You're gonna make somebody
a lot of money, Sidney! [Horn honking]

914
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:08,414
[Orchestral ballad]

915
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:12,420
And now

916
00:58:12,421 --> 00:58:15,173
the end is near

917
00:58:15,174 --> 00:58:17,925
and so I face

918
00:58:17,926 --> 00:58:21,929
the final curtain
[laughs]

919
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,931
You cunt

920
00:58:23,932 --> 00:58:26,976
I'm not a queer

921
00:58:26,977 --> 00:58:30,229
I'll state my case

922
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,441
of which I'm certain

923
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:35,943
I've lived

924
00:58:35,944 --> 00:58:39,447
a life that's full

925
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:41,949
and each

926
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,952
and every highway

927
00:58:44,953 --> 00:58:47,455
and more

928
00:58:47,456 --> 00:58:51,709
much more than this

929
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:57,423
I did it my way

930
00:58:57,424 --> 00:59:01,926
[punk]

931
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:04,430
Regrets

932
00:59:04,431 --> 00:59:06,932
I've had a few

933
00:59:06,933 --> 00:59:09,727
but then again

934
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:12,938
too few to mention

935
00:59:12,939 --> 00:59:14,440
I did

936
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:17,192
what I had to do

937
00:59:17,193 --> 00:59:20,112
I saw it through

938
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:22,990
without exemption

939
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:24,950
I planned

940
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:27,953
each charted course

941
00:59:27,954 --> 00:59:30,456
each careful step

942
00:59:30,457 --> 00:59:33,500
along the highway

943
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:35,461
and more

944
00:59:35,462 --> 00:59:39,256
much more than this

945
00:59:39,257 --> 00:59:43,969
I did it my way

946
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,471
there were times

947
00:59:46,472 --> 00:59:48,473
I'm sure you knew

948
00:59:48,474 --> 00:59:51,268
when there was fuck?

949
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:53,979
Fuck, fuck-all else to do

950
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,523
but through it all

951
00:59:56,524 --> 00:59:58,984
when there was doubt

952
00:59:58,985 --> 01:00:01,278
I shot it up

953
01:00:01,279 --> 01:00:03,989
or kicked it out

954
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:06,241
I faced 'em all

955
01:00:06,242 --> 01:00:09,494
and the world

956
01:00:09,495 --> 01:00:15,500
and did it my way

957
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:17,419
[continues]
I've loved

958
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,963
and then a snide

959
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:22,007
I've had my fill
[grunts]

960
01:00:22,008 --> 01:00:26,011
My share of losing

961
01:00:26,012 --> 01:00:27,971
and now

962
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:30,765
the tears subside

963
01:00:30,766 --> 01:00:33,393
I find it all

964
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:35,979
so amusing

965
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,481
to think
[audience screaming]

966
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:40,984
I killed a cat

967
01:00:40,985 --> 01:00:43,945
[gunfire continues]
And may I say

968
01:00:43,946 --> 01:00:46,948
out in the driveway

969
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:48,908
and no

970
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:52,954
no, no, not me

971
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:59,459
I did it my way

972
01:01:34,705 --> 01:01:40,208
it seems like
all my friends are dead.

973
01:01:45,549 --> 01:01:51,427
When I'm dead,
will you be sad?

974
01:01:53,265 --> 01:01:58,184
I couldn't live
without you.

975
01:01:59,146 --> 01:02:03,607
- You couldn't?
- No.

976
01:02:03,608 --> 01:02:09,028
We better
go together then.

977
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:14,992
How should we do it?

978
01:02:15,453 --> 01:02:18,497
We could...

979
01:02:18,498 --> 01:02:23,085
jump off a building.

980
01:02:23,086 --> 01:02:27,548
Throw ourselves
under a subway.

981
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:32,009
O.d.

982
01:02:34,973 --> 01:02:39,977
If I asked you to kill me,

983
01:02:39,978 --> 01:02:44,480
would you?

984
01:02:44,524 --> 01:02:50,527
What...
what would i do?

985
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:56,033
I couldn't live
without you.

986
01:02:56,035 --> 01:02:58,578
You'd kill yourself
too, then?

987
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:00,539
Yeah.

988
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:06,043
Yeah. Yeah.

989
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:20,892
Shit.

990
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:24,813
I hate this fucking life.
[Crying]

991
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:29,693
No, this is...
this is just a rough patch.

992
01:03:29,694 --> 01:03:33,113
Things will be much better when
we get to America, I promise.

993
01:03:33,114 --> 01:03:36,992
We're in America.

994
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:39,953
What?

995
01:03:39,954 --> 01:03:41,955
We've been here
a week.

996
01:03:41,956 --> 01:03:46,960
New York is in America,
you fuck.

997
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:48,962
What? Couldn't be.

998
01:03:48,963 --> 01:03:51,506
A week?
Yeah.

999
01:03:51,507 --> 01:03:54,384
What day is it?

1000
01:03:54,385 --> 01:03:57,387
Oh, shit.
Is it tuesday or wednesday?

1001
01:03:57,388 --> 01:04:00,932
We're supposed to be at grandma
and grandpa's on wednesday.

1002
01:04:00,933 --> 01:04:03,434
Where's my fuckin' book?
[Papers rustling]

1003
01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:07,937
Shit.

1004
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:14,402
God.

1005
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:20,451
[Siren wailing]

1006
01:04:20,452 --> 01:04:25,371
[Horns honking]

1007
01:04:29,294 --> 01:04:34,797
[Sirens, horns continue]

1008
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:49,272
No! Look!
There's the rollerama!

1009
01:04:49,273 --> 01:04:53,317
Sid, I won a roller skating trophy there
when I was six years old.

1010
01:04:53,318 --> 01:04:55,861
Nancy, don't fib.
Fuck you, grandma.

1011
01:04:55,862 --> 01:04:58,322
- Oh, no!
- [Horns honking]

1012
01:04:58,323 --> 01:05:04,827
[Sid laughing]
This place is a fucking paradise.

1013
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:09,834
You guys gotta come see us in New York
when I get Sid some gigs.

1014
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:13,337
Can't he cut his own meat?
They really want him at Max's.

1015
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:16,799
They're too fuckin' cheap.
They only wanna pay him three grand.

1016
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,343
I mean,
he's worth five at least.

1017
01:05:19,344 --> 01:05:24,348
Sid's a really big star
in New York. We both are.

1018
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:26,308
[Chuckling]
Yeah, yeah.

1019
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:28,811
God, we barely have
any time to ourselves.

1020
01:05:28,812 --> 01:05:31,355
We don't even have time
to get to the methadone clinic.

1021
01:05:31,356 --> 01:05:33,315
We've only got enough
for two days.

1022
01:05:33,316 --> 01:05:38,320
Grandma, can I borrow the car?
I wanna teach Sid how to drive American.

1023
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:41,365
Mom, how come Nancy gets to
borrow grandma's car and I don't?

1024
01:05:41,366 --> 01:05:43,325
She's the one who got fucked up
and wrecked it.

1025
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:45,828
Shut up.
What do you know, crater face?

1026
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:48,872
Fuckin' twerp. Too bad
about your brothers, Mary Jane.

1027
01:05:48,873 --> 01:05:53,834
Still taking idiot lessons?

1028
01:05:54,838 --> 01:06:01,343
So, are you gonna make an honest
woman out of our Nancy, Sid?

1029
01:06:01,344 --> 01:06:04,388
Well, she's always
been honest to me.

1030
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:06,348
Grandpa, sir.

1031
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:08,850
She's never lied to me.

1032
01:06:08,851 --> 01:06:13,355
But what are your,
uh, intentions?

1033
01:06:13,356 --> 01:06:15,357
Well, first off,

1034
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,403
we're gonna go down to
the methadone clinic on monday,

1035
01:06:19,404 --> 01:06:22,864
and then Nancy's
gonna get me some gigs.

1036
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:25,909
And then we're gonna go off
and, like, live in Paris...

1037
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:30,872
and just sort of go out
in a blaze of glory.

1038
01:06:30,873 --> 01:06:36,376
But don't worry.
You'll be proud of us.

1039
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,925
So why don't we go down
to the rec room?

1040
01:06:41,926 --> 01:06:44,844
Fuck this and fuck that

1041
01:06:44,845 --> 01:06:47,639
fuck it all, you fuckin'
fuckin' brat

1042
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,767
I don't want a baby
who looks like that

1043
01:06:50,768 --> 01:06:53,895
she don't want a baby
that looks like that

1044
01:06:53,896 --> 01:06:55,855
fucking

1045
01:06:55,856 --> 01:06:58,149
a fucking animal

1046
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,360
[coughing]

1047
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:05,363
Oh, that's...
that's an old one.

1048
01:07:05,366 --> 01:07:07,408
So, what else
should we do, huh?

1049
01:07:07,409 --> 01:07:09,661
Oh, no more.
I'm tired.

1050
01:07:09,662 --> 01:07:13,373
I wanna go noddy-blinkums.

1051
01:07:13,374 --> 01:07:16,834
Whose bedroom
are we sleepin' in?

1052
01:07:16,835 --> 01:07:19,379
Actually, dear,
you're not staying here.

1053
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,383
We thought it would be more fun for you to
stay downtown at the Sunshine Inn.

1054
01:07:23,384 --> 01:07:26,678
No. What about
French toast and blintzes?

1055
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:29,889
You don't want to
come back here for breakfast.

1056
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:33,851
Your bus leaves at 9: 17.

1057
01:07:33,852 --> 01:07:37,855
I thought we're staying
another day.

1058
01:07:37,856 --> 01:07:40,316
Grandpa and I
must have misunderstood.

1059
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:43,903
See, we're, uh...
we're going out of town tomorrow.

1060
01:07:43,904 --> 01:07:46,864
The whole family
is going out of town.

1061
01:07:46,865 --> 01:07:51,868
I didn't know we were going anywhere.
[Grandma] be quiet.

1062
01:07:52,371 --> 01:07:55,414
That's all right.
Can we come?

1063
01:07:55,415 --> 01:07:59,877
No, Nancy,
you just can't.

1064
01:07:59,878 --> 01:08:04,882
- Well, will you at least drive us
to the motel? - Of course.

1065
01:08:04,883 --> 01:08:07,426
And we'll give you money for
a taxi for tomorrow morning.

1066
01:08:07,427 --> 01:08:09,387
You'll get to the bus
in plenty of time.

1067
01:08:09,388 --> 01:08:13,933
Here. Darling, it was lovely
to see you. Here.

1068
01:08:13,934 --> 01:08:17,394
Here, take it.
Sid.

1069
01:08:17,395 --> 01:08:20,397
What? I can't just
leave him there.

1070
01:08:20,398 --> 01:08:23,901
[Sid's voice]
These people, they're really lovely.

1071
01:08:23,902 --> 01:08:28,864
Best fuckin' food
I ever ate. [Tv, indistinct]

1072
01:08:28,865 --> 01:08:33,826
So why'd
they throw us out?

1073
01:08:37,874 --> 01:08:42,877
'Cause they know me.

1074
01:08:46,841 --> 01:08:53,345
[Kiss]
[Sirens blaring]

1075
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:09,361
Can you move your foot?

1076
01:09:23,378 --> 01:09:27,339
Know about the golden triangle?
Yeah.

1077
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:31,343
That's where
the heroin comes from.

1078
01:09:31,344 --> 01:09:34,387
Heard about it
when I was in the 'nam.

1079
01:09:34,388 --> 01:09:37,432
You heard of vietnam, right?
Yup.

1080
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:39,392
Yeah, uh-huh.

1081
01:09:39,393 --> 01:09:42,437
Yeah, and while us guys
was fightin', dyin'...

1082
01:09:42,438 --> 01:09:44,898
and gettin' all fucked up,

1083
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:48,443
the CIA was flyin' the shit
out of there and into here...

1084
01:09:48,444 --> 01:09:52,405
with our planes.

1085
01:09:52,406 --> 01:09:55,909
You know who
paid for that shit?

1086
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,411
We did.

1087
01:09:58,412 --> 01:10:01,873
That is, the government.

1088
01:10:01,874 --> 01:10:04,375
You know why?

1089
01:10:04,376 --> 01:10:10,338
'Cause smack
is the great controller.

1090
01:10:12,384 --> 01:10:14,427
Keeps the people stupid...

1091
01:10:14,428 --> 01:10:17,889
when they could be smart.

1092
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:22,352
What's he on about?
Some bullshit politics.

1093
01:10:22,353 --> 01:10:25,355
You guys got no right
to be strung out on that stuff.

1094
01:10:25,356 --> 01:10:28,858
You could be selling
healthy anarchy.

1095
01:10:28,859 --> 01:10:31,402
But long as you're addicts,

1096
01:10:31,403 --> 01:10:36,322
you'll be full of shit.

1097
01:10:50,255 --> 01:10:52,131
[Woman]
Come on, Vito. Don't be such a jerk.

1098
01:10:52,132 --> 01:10:55,593
I just don't know how many people want
to see Vicious on his own.

1099
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:59,639
Are you kidding? Sid Vicious is a major...
he's not gonna be on his own.

1100
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,643
He's gonna have a great fuckin'
backup band behind him. Yeah. Yeah?

1101
01:11:03,644 --> 01:11:07,647
Who? "Who?"
Iggy, Dee Dee, Chrissie, Debbie.

1102
01:11:07,648 --> 01:11:10,107
Debbie harry singing backup.

1103
01:11:10,108 --> 01:11:13,611
It's true!
Johnny  Thunders, Joe Strummer...

1104
01:11:13,612 --> 01:11:17,114
I love you, Nancy. You're a fuckin' nutcase.
Stiv Bators, Jerry nolan.

1105
01:11:17,115 --> 01:11:20,576
I'm running a business here.
You really think he can pull this off?

1106
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:22,536
Yes!
Can he play?

1107
01:11:22,537 --> 01:11:27,082
He can! Shit, he practices
all the time, right?

1108
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:32,545
Vito, come on, please.
Give us a gig.

1109
01:11:33,048 --> 01:11:36,050
You want me to fuck you?
[Scoffs]

1110
01:11:36,051 --> 01:11:41,096
No. And you shouldn't offer.
It's not professional.

1111
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:46,559
[Phone ringing]

1112
01:11:48,563 --> 01:11:51,565
[Ringing continues]

1113
01:11:51,566 --> 01:11:54,568
[Dial tone]

1114
01:11:54,569 --> 01:11:56,570
All right. I'll give you
three grand for three gigs.

1115
01:11:56,571 --> 01:11:58,572
All right! Okay.

1116
01:11:58,573 --> 01:12:00,574
Deal.
Deal.

1117
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:04,953
[Strumming guitars]

1118
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:06,955
Sid! Sid!

1119
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:09,208
Hey, Max. Sid!

1120
01:12:09,209 --> 01:12:11,460
Sid, guess what!

1121
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:15,964
Sid, i did it!
I got you three gigs at Max's!

1122
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:18,967
At least three, maybe more!
Are you excited? Yeah.

1123
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:21,928
What? Sid?

1124
01:12:21,929 --> 01:12:24,931
What?
What's goin' on?

1125
01:12:24,932 --> 01:12:28,935
We were just jamming,
you know? And watching trigger.

1126
01:12:28,936 --> 01:12:31,938
What is...
what is this?

1127
01:12:31,939 --> 01:12:34,941
Sid!
Did you give him this?

1128
01:12:34,942 --> 01:12:36,943
Fuckin', come on.
No way. - Sid.

1129
01:12:36,944 --> 01:12:40,489
I just came here to jam, all right?
Just be cool.

1130
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:43,950
Don't tell me to be cool.
Sid! Sid, we had a deal.

1131
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:46,995
We said we weren't gonna
do any more smack until after the gig,

1132
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:49,956
you asshole,
you fucking jerk!

1133
01:12:49,957 --> 01:12:53,960
Shit! I can't fucking decide
where to fucking throw you!

1134
01:12:53,961 --> 01:12:58,465
We had a deal. We said we weren't
gonna do any smack till after the gig!

1135
01:12:58,466 --> 01:13:01,968
And you don't even save me any,
you fuckhead!

1136
01:13:01,969 --> 01:13:05,013
Shit, you asshole,
motherfucking jerk...

1137
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:09,474
Ow! Sid!

1138
01:13:09,477 --> 01:13:12,020
[Grunts]

1139
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:16,940
[Sniffling]

1140
01:13:16,984 --> 01:13:22,987
Sid, you're the fuckhead!

1141
01:13:25,951 --> 01:13:28,036
Hey, what the fuck
is going on?

1142
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:30,496
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?

1143
01:13:30,497 --> 01:13:34,000
No, he's a fucking
asshole junkie.

1144
01:13:34,001 --> 01:13:36,002
Fuckhead.
Don't kick him.

1145
01:13:36,003 --> 01:13:39,047
You're really gonnalove this place.
A lot of great artists stay here.

1146
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,049
I want you
to stay a long time.

1147
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,510
Let's take him to my room.

1148
01:13:44,511 --> 01:13:47,513
It's a couple of my
foreign exchange students.

1149
01:13:47,514 --> 01:13:53,017
Why don't we just get to the elevator?
We'll take the elevator.

1150
01:13:54,521 --> 01:13:56,480
[Sid]
This next number...

1151
01:13:56,481 --> 01:14:00,526
is for all you sensitive
people out there,

1152
01:14:00,527 --> 01:14:02,987
all you young lovers.

1153
01:14:02,988 --> 01:14:06,532
Ein, zwei.
Ein, zwei, drei.

1154
01:14:06,533 --> 01:14:11,994
[Crowd cheering]

1155
01:14:12,456 --> 01:14:16,500
Look a-here
here she comes

1156
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:19,003
there comes that girl again?

1157
01:14:19,004 --> 01:14:21,547
One of the cutest
since I don't know when

1158
01:14:21,548 --> 01:14:24,508
but she don't notice me
when I pass

1159
01:14:24,509 --> 01:14:27,553
she goes with all the guys
from outta my class

1160
01:14:27,554 --> 01:14:30,556
but that didn't stop me
from a-thinkin' to myself

1161
01:14:30,557 --> 01:14:36,018
she's sure fine-looking, man
she's somethin' else

1162
01:14:39,524 --> 01:14:42,818
look a-here
across the street

1163
01:14:42,819 --> 01:14:45,696
there's a car
built just for me

1164
01:14:45,697 --> 01:14:48,657
to own that car
would be a luxury

1165
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:51,535
but right now
I can't afford the gas

1166
01:14:51,536 --> 01:14:54,538
a brand-new convertible
is outta my class

1167
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:57,833
but that can't stop me
from a-thinkin' to myself

1168
01:14:57,834 --> 01:15:01,086
that car's fine-lookin', man
that's somethin' else

1169
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:05,547
all right!
Whoo!

1170
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:10,053
Look a-here
just wait and see

1171
01:15:10,054 --> 01:15:12,598
[Man]
Hey, Nancy! What?

1172
01:15:12,599 --> 01:15:15,058
You want a kitty?

1173
01:15:15,059 --> 01:15:18,562
She is the girl
we go ridin' around

1174
01:15:18,563 --> 01:15:21,565
we're lookin' real good
with the white top down

1175
01:15:21,566 --> 01:15:24,568
I keep around a-creepin'
and i'm thinkin' to myself

1176
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:27,571
whenever it comes through, ma
wow, that's somethin' else

1177
01:15:27,572 --> 01:15:33,075
ah-ooh!
[Meows]

1178
01:15:33,578 --> 01:15:36,580
He likes me.

1179
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:40,083
Never thought
I'd do this before

1180
01:15:40,084 --> 01:15:42,544
but here I am
a-knocking on her door

1181
01:15:42,545 --> 01:15:45,088
the car's out front
and it's all mine

1182
01:15:45,089 --> 01:15:48,550
it was a '41 job
not a '59

1183
01:15:48,551 --> 01:15:51,553
I got that girl
and i'm thinkin' to myself

1184
01:15:51,554 --> 01:15:54,598
she's sure fine-lookin', man
wow, she's somethin' else

1185
01:15:54,599 --> 01:15:59,559
[crowd cheering]

1186
01:16:05,568 --> 01:16:09,070
[Stops]
[Applause, cheering]

1187
01:16:09,071 --> 01:16:11,573
You like that one?

1188
01:16:11,574 --> 01:16:15,076
You wanna hear "my way,"
assholes?

1189
01:16:15,077 --> 01:16:17,078
I forgot it.

1190
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:20,582
[Nancy]
You were fucking great, Sid.

1191
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,126
You were so fucking good.
[Sid] I don't know about that.

1192
01:16:23,127 --> 01:16:25,628
Most of the people there
were screaming for John,

1193
01:16:25,629 --> 01:16:28,089
throwing drugs
and shit at me.

1194
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:30,383
That's 'cause they love you.
They're your fans.

1195
01:16:30,384 --> 01:16:32,594
Yeah, we'd sound a lot better
if we rehearsed.

1196
01:16:32,595 --> 01:16:34,596
[Nancy] Sid doesn't need to rehearse.
He's a natural.

1197
01:16:34,597 --> 01:16:38,641
[Sid] yeah a natural fuckup.
If you'd get it together, sid.
You gotta learn the words.

1198
01:16:38,642 --> 01:16:40,601
Words.
It's not words.

1199
01:16:40,602 --> 01:16:44,647
It's just those bridge and tunnel geeks
don't appreciate his style.

1200
01:16:44,648 --> 01:16:48,109
"My way." Hey, Sid, don't go
gettin' down on yourself.

1201
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:51,154
If we just worked a little harder, you know.
What do you know?

1202
01:16:51,155 --> 01:16:54,407
Hey, Nancy, be cool.
I'm just trying to help Sid out.

1203
01:16:54,408 --> 01:16:57,618
Everybody likes Sid.
Nobody likes the shit you do.

1204
01:16:57,619 --> 01:17:00,121
Nancy, be cool.
Don't worry about it.

1205
01:17:00,122 --> 01:17:02,623
People'll be into my stuff
around '85, '86. Yeah?

1206
01:17:02,624 --> 01:17:05,126
Well, you're lucky
to be in Sid's band. You all are.

1207
01:17:05,127 --> 01:17:08,671
Nancy, be cool.
Fuck you!

1208
01:17:08,672 --> 01:17:12,133
Shut the fuck up! Everything
was fine. It was going really well.

1209
01:17:12,134 --> 01:17:16,637
We don't fucking
deserve this, asshole!

1210
01:17:16,638 --> 01:17:19,598
I'll see you
at rehearsal, gang.

1211
01:17:19,599 --> 01:17:23,102
Hey, Sid. We saw
your show at Max's.

1212
01:17:23,103 --> 01:17:25,104
All right.
What'd you think of it?

1213
01:17:25,105 --> 01:17:27,606
You suck!

1214
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:31,152
Sid, those guys are full of shit.
What do they know?

1215
01:17:31,153 --> 01:17:34,613
I know what's best for you.
That's why I'm your manager.

1216
01:17:34,614 --> 01:17:38,117
"Learn the fucking words."
You don't need the fucking words.

1217
01:17:38,118 --> 01:17:45,124
He doesn't need words. Just make 'em
up like you did on "my way." Huh?

1218
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:48,168
I wish we had some more coke.
[Indistinct]

Haunted by the ghost

1220

I want to be haunted by the ghost

1221
01:17:52,632 --> 01:17:55,634
I want to be haunted by the ghost

1222
01:17:55,635 --> 01:17:57,678
I want to be haunted
by the ghost

1223
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:02,141
of your precious love

1224
01:18:02,142 --> 01:18:07,146
of your precious love

[meows]

1226
01:18:11,109 --> 01:18:14,111
Sid.

1227
01:18:14,112 --> 01:18:18,615
Sid.
Hmm?

1228
01:18:18,616 --> 01:18:23,036
I must have
been dreaming.

1229
01:18:23,037 --> 01:18:26,957
I thought we had
this little dog.

1230
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:29,960
It was really little,

1231
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:32,337
and we loved it.

1232
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:35,757
But then it got sick,

1233
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:39,511
and it was dead.

1234
01:18:39,512 --> 01:18:44,474
[Mumbles]
Yeah, it was dead,

1235
01:18:44,475 --> 01:18:47,352
and we loved it.

1236
01:18:47,353 --> 01:18:53,275
We didn't know whether
to bury it in New York...

1237
01:18:53,276 --> 01:18:56,486
or to keep it,

1238
01:18:56,487 --> 01:19:00,073
so we ate it.

1239
01:19:00,074 --> 01:19:02,492

[Man]
Hey, Sid!

1242
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:10,917
Sid, get up, man. We got a gig.
Come on, let's go.

1243
01:19:10,918 --> 01:19:15,338
You're seriously fuckin' up, man.
Come on, get up!

1244
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:18,883
[Knocking continues]
Sid Vicious, get your ass up! Come on!

1245
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:21,886
Sid, get your ass up, man.
We got an important gig.

1246
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:24,848
Let's go! Sid!

1247
01:19:24,849 --> 01:19:28,351
Sid, get your ass up.
Come on!

1248
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:30,854
Vicious!

1249

Vicious, let's go!

[Continues]

1252
01:19:48,247 --> 01:19:54,751
Now I'm gonna be
face-to-face

1253
01:19:55,754 --> 01:20:01,758
I lie right down
in my favorite place

1254
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:06,264
now I wanna be a joke

1255
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:08,224
and now I wanna

1256
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:12,186
be a joke

[fades, stops]

1258
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:39,171
[Man on TV] Is public image, Ltd.
A company or is it a band?

1259
01:20:39,172 --> 01:20:42,716
They're all empty. [John on TV]
It's not a band. It's a company.

1260
01:20:42,717 --> 01:20:45,678
Just little paper squares.

1261
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,681
Fuck.

1262
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:52,726
Where are you going?
To get some more.

1263
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:56,730
How do you facilitate
this communication, Johnny ?

1264
01:20:56,731 --> 01:21:00,234
By whatever we think
is relevant at the time.

1265
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:02,736
And what is relevant
to you right now?

1266
01:21:02,737 --> 01:21:05,197
Not very much really,
Snydie.

1267
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:08,200
Gretchen, girl.
What? Hey.

1268
01:21:08,201 --> 01:21:11,203
It's under that building.
That building?

[Children shouting]
[Man] Yeah? Fuck you, you asshole!

Where is the money?
Give us the money!

1272

I want that money, kid.
I want it. Oi.

1273
01:21:23,758 --> 01:21:25,717
Cut it out.
Let him go.

1274
01:21:25,718 --> 01:21:29,263
He owes us three bucks, man!
I don't care. Leave him alone.

1275
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:35,726

do you think you are? Sid Vicious.

I can't remember.

You miss it?

1281
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:15,098
We can if you want to.

1282
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,561
No.

1283
01:22:18,562 --> 01:22:23,565

of my business, man,

complaining.

She's all right.
She don't mean it.

1304

She ought to have
more respect for you.

1305
01:25:40,442 --> 01:25:45,988
If I had a girlfriend, she'd show me
some respect. Believe it.

1306
01:25:45,989 --> 01:25:49,449
What are you talkin' about,
respect? You don't know her.

Did I leave a lot of money
around here?

I thought I might have left it here.

of this for later?

has stayed here before you?

Thomas Wolfe.
Arthur Miller. Tennessee Williams.

1326
01:28:47,585 --> 01:28:50,629
This is not a place where
people set fire to their rooms.

I want shopping!
The Chelsea Hotel is a landmark.

1328

It's a historic part of the
city of New York. I want shopping!

1329

Do you know who has stayed here before?
I want shopping!

It's on the first floor.

01:29:09,065 --> 01:29:11,566
You won't even have to
wait for the elevator. You'll like it.

Look at that.
The door's open. [Chuckling]

1335

Wait a second. Wait a second.
Excuse me.

1336
01:29:17,115 --> 01:29:19,616
Where are you going
with that lamp? This is our lamp.

1337
01:29:19,617 --> 01:29:21,576
You cannot move furniture
from room to room.

1338
01:29:21,577 --> 01:29:25,163
I forget where the fixtures are.
This is our lamp. We bought it.

Where's the tv?
There's no tv?

1340

There's no tv!

1341
01:29:32,088 --> 01:29:37,092
Would you do me a favor? Go up to your
old room, take the television, bring it down.

He wants you
to like this room.

1343
01:29:47,103 --> 01:29:52,606
Bob Dylan was born here.

1344
01:29:56,112 --> 01:29:59,614
I haven't got anything.
Just my wake-up shot.

1345
01:29:59,615 --> 01:30:03,118
Nobody's holding downtown.

1346
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:06,579
Bowery said he'd
meet us here.

1347
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:09,123
Are you still
buying off bowery?

1348
01:30:09,124 --> 01:30:12,168
I heard he sold someone a paper
and, like, died.

1349
01:30:12,169 --> 01:30:16,130
That's fucking bullshit.

1350
01:30:16,131 --> 01:30:18,633
Are you guys
still fighting, Nance?

1351
01:30:18,634 --> 01:30:21,135
He's real depressed.

1352
01:30:21,136 --> 01:30:25,139
Yeah. Jimmy's
real depressed too.

1353
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:27,100
He broke three of my ribs.

[Banging on window]

1355
01:30:29,103 --> 01:30:31,604
We're being so stupid.
We should just leave 'em.

1356
01:30:31,605 --> 01:30:35,108
Yeah, sure. Love kills.

1357
01:30:35,109 --> 01:30:39,570
See ya.

1358
01:30:39,571 --> 01:30:42,073
Hey, Sid.
Hey, man. How are you doing?

1359
01:30:42,074 --> 01:30:45,076
Got any beer for me?
I got some tickets to see Bruce Springsteen.

1360
01:30:45,077 --> 01:30:47,620
Fuck your tickets for fucking
Bruce Springsteen!  Man!

1361
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:49,580
Fuck off
and get me some smack.

1362
01:30:49,581 --> 01:30:52,083
Just for that,
you ain't goin'! Sid.

1363
01:30:52,084 --> 01:30:54,043
Shit.
Sid.

1364
01:30:54,044 --> 01:30:56,087
Sid, look at these.

1365
01:30:56,088 --> 01:30:58,547
We need these.

1366
01:30:58,548 --> 01:31:03,552
But I don't have any money.

1367
01:31:03,553 --> 01:31:05,554
[Nancy]
Sid, where did you put it?

1368
01:31:05,555 --> 01:31:09,100
I can't remember.

1369
01:31:09,101 --> 01:31:11,102
You did it without me.
Oh, come on.

1370
01:31:11,103 --> 01:31:14,563
If I had only enough
for one of us, I'd give it all to you.

1371
01:31:14,564 --> 01:31:16,565
Liar!

1372
01:31:16,566 --> 01:31:19,568
Aah!

01:31:23,114 --> 01:31:26,075
You hate me.

1375
01:31:26,076 --> 01:31:28,077
I don't.

1376
01:31:28,078 --> 01:31:31,622
I don't.

1377
01:31:31,623 --> 01:31:36,125
[Groans]

1378
01:31:37,087 --> 01:31:41,090
Oh, god.

1379
01:31:41,091 --> 01:31:44,635
I wish I was fuckin' dead.

1380
01:31:44,636 --> 01:31:50,057
Oh, shut up, please.
Quit goin' on about it. [Sniffling]

1381
01:31:50,058 --> 01:31:52,601
I've got more reasons
to be depressed than you.

1382
01:31:52,602 --> 01:31:57,064
You're much better off
than I am.

1383
01:31:57,065 --> 01:31:59,107
Why?

1384
01:31:59,108 --> 01:32:04,571
At least youused
to be something.

1385
01:32:04,572 --> 01:32:08,575
I've never been anything.

1386
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:11,119
[Footsteps approaching]

1387
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:16,081
[Keys jingling]

1388
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:26,635
Is that bowery?

1389
01:32:26,636 --> 01:32:30,639
No.
It's that Dwarf.

1390
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,682
He's not a Dwarf, Sid.

1391
01:32:32,683 --> 01:32:34,643
He's a little boy.

1392
01:32:34,644 --> 01:32:37,687
What would you know?
Little kids don't dress like that.

1393
01:32:37,688 --> 01:32:42,108
Oh, fuck you.
Oh, fuck you too!

1394
01:32:42,109 --> 01:32:45,111
Sid.

1395
01:32:45,112 --> 01:32:50,615
[Crying]

1396
01:32:54,121 --> 01:32:58,166
I'm sorry.

1397
01:32:58,167 --> 01:33:00,168
I'm sorry.

1398
01:33:00,169 --> 01:33:04,631
I wish we had something
to hit as well.

1399
01:33:04,632 --> 01:33:11,179
[Meowing]
I wish we could get out of here.

1400
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:14,641
Sid, Nance,
pull up your pants!

1401
01:33:14,642 --> 01:33:17,143
Yo!
[Nancy] Bowery.

1402
01:33:17,144 --> 01:33:20,104
[Sid]
What've you got? Not much.

1403
01:33:20,105 --> 01:33:22,106
You guys got
any soda around here?

1404
01:33:22,107 --> 01:33:25,151
[Nancy] Come on. Don't fuck around.
We got the cash.

1405
01:33:25,152 --> 01:33:27,737
Everybody's got the cash,
but nobody's holding.

1406
01:33:27,738 --> 01:33:30,114
I've been up and down
this island twice today.

1407
01:33:30,115 --> 01:33:33,701
Been all the way to Brooklyn.
Hate that fuckin' town.

1408
01:33:33,702 --> 01:33:37,121
I've been reading this book.
Have you ever seen it?

1409
01:33:37,122 --> 01:33:40,166
[Nancy] Aw, come on. Just get us
straight, you shithole!

1410
01:33:40,167 --> 01:33:42,710
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
What is it you're saying?

1411
01:33:42,711 --> 01:33:44,629
I said you were
a fuckin' slime hole!

1412
01:33:44,630 --> 01:33:47,632
Don't fuckin' talk to me,
you stupid little slut! [Shouting]

1413
01:33:47,633 --> 01:33:51,636
I don't need to hear your fucking crap!
Give us what you've got or piss off!

1414
01:33:51,637 --> 01:33:53,971
Hey, all right.
Easy, easy. Fucking books!

1415
01:33:53,972 --> 01:33:56,641
You wanna know what I got?
Hold on. Yeah.

1416
01:33:56,642 --> 01:33:59,185
Here we go. Something for you.
You fucking toad!

1417
01:33:59,186 --> 01:34:01,646
Don't get up.
I was just leaving. Wait!

1418
01:34:01,647 --> 01:34:04,190
Fuck you, Nancy!

1419
01:34:04,191 --> 01:34:06,192
You people are rude!

1420
01:34:06,193 --> 01:34:10,655
[Nancy]
I'm sorry. What's that?

1421
01:34:10,656 --> 01:34:15,158
I'm sorry.

1422
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,661
Better.

1423
01:34:17,662 --> 01:34:23,666
You two gotta watch your step, you know.
The buzz is out on you.

1424
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:27,213
What's this?
Tuinals?

1425
01:34:27,214 --> 01:34:29,715
Yeah, what's this?
Speed.

1426
01:34:29,716 --> 01:34:31,717
Sulfate? You want some of this?
You want this?

1427
01:34:31,718 --> 01:34:37,638
Yeah. I never touch that stuff.
I'm too paranoid.

1428
01:34:41,186 --> 01:34:43,187
You guys are outside, man.

1429
01:34:43,188 --> 01:34:45,689
You shoot that stuff,
it's gonna make you sick.

1430
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:49,693
What about the dilaudid?
Tried. I couldn't get ahold of the guy.

1431
01:34:49,694 --> 01:34:51,695
You got a phone?
I'll try again.

1432
01:34:51,696 --> 01:34:54,031
Yeah.
It's in the lobby.

1433
01:34:54,032 --> 01:34:56,241
The phone is in the lobby.

1434
01:34:56,242 --> 01:34:59,244
Right.
[Sighs]

1435
01:34:59,245 --> 01:35:01,663
No promises.

1436
01:35:01,664 --> 01:35:05,250
But for
my famous friends...

1437
01:35:05,251 --> 01:35:09,671
I go the extra mile.

1438
01:35:09,672 --> 01:35:13,175
You guys aren't going anywhere, are you?
[Chuckles]

1439
01:35:13,176 --> 01:35:18,679
[Tv, indistinct]

1440
01:35:27,732 --> 01:35:30,734
My eyes hurt.

1441
01:35:30,735 --> 01:35:36,697
The TV's so bright
it hurts my eyes.

1442
01:35:40,703 --> 01:35:45,205
[Amplifier off]

1443
01:35:47,251 --> 01:35:51,753
Oh, fuck it.

1444
01:36:03,726 --> 01:36:11,147
Just broke, sort of blinking
at them, you know.

1445
01:36:12,943 --> 01:36:15,528
A dolly, I suppose.
It's something I can't remember.

1446
01:36:15,529 --> 01:36:18,865
Shut up.

1447
01:36:18,866 --> 01:36:23,368
Listen.

1448
01:36:38,093 --> 01:36:41,929
What?

1449
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:46,809
I can't hear nothing.
No.

1450
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:51,271
Listen to me.

1451
01:36:52,649 --> 01:36:56,068
I don't want to.

1452
01:36:56,069 --> 01:37:00,571
Why not?

1453
01:37:02,075 --> 01:37:06,537
I don't know.
I just don't.

1454
01:37:06,538 --> 01:37:11,499
What are you
waiting for?

1455
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:20,509
Bowery?

1456
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:26,013
[Chuckles]
Bowery doesn't fucking matter.

1457
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:34,981
What does?

1458
01:37:36,485 --> 01:37:40,986
You.

1459
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:46,992
And?

1460
01:37:49,956 --> 01:37:54,458
You.

1461
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,172
[Sid]
I'm just not going to, okay?

1462
01:37:58,173 --> 01:38:00,466
[Nancy]
You have to. You promised.

1463
01:38:00,467 --> 01:38:02,885
Yeah, well,
I changed me mind.

1464
01:38:02,886 --> 01:38:05,429
You can't!
You can't change your mind.

1465
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:08,891
We said we'd go out together. You
can't change your mind. Of course I can.

1466
01:38:08,892 --> 01:38:11,393
I just did. I did.
No!

1467
01:38:11,394 --> 01:38:13,937
Blaze of glory!

1468
01:38:13,938 --> 01:38:16,940
You promised!
You promised!

1469
01:38:16,941 --> 01:38:20,944
I'm getting out of this place.
I'm going back to England. No! Why?

1470
01:38:20,945 --> 01:38:22,905
'Cause I wanna get straight,
you know?

1471
01:38:22,906 --> 01:38:26,408
I'm sick and tired of all these
fucking people that kiss ass! Fuck you!

1472
01:38:26,409 --> 01:38:29,411
I want to get back with my friends
and people who care. Okay. Okay.

1473
01:38:29,412 --> 01:38:32,372
Go on!
Just leave me!

1474
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:35,208
You're always putting fucking words
in my mouth! Friends?

1475
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:37,961
They don't even care about you!
I am fucking leaving!

1476
01:38:37,962 --> 01:38:40,380
I'm your best friend, Sid.

1477
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:44,926
So you keep fucking telling me!
And you'll never get straight.

1478
01:38:44,927 --> 01:38:47,471
You'll never
get straight, Sid.

1479
01:38:47,472 --> 01:38:50,432
You say that
every fucking day.

1480
01:38:50,433 --> 01:38:52,434
It's the same.

1481
01:38:52,435 --> 01:38:56,938
I can't get up tomorrow
to the same thing.

1482
01:38:56,939 --> 01:38:59,482
I can't do it anymore.

1483
01:38:59,483 --> 01:39:01,985
Oh, god, please help me.

1484
01:39:01,986 --> 01:39:04,904
Please, you promised.

1485
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:07,949
You're so full of shit.
You're so fuckin' blind!

1486
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:10,952
No, I'm not.
I'm not blind.

1487
01:39:10,953 --> 01:39:13,413
I see everything.

1488
01:39:13,414 --> 01:39:16,958
Where are you going?
No! Going out for...

1489
01:39:16,959 --> 01:39:21,463
no, it's 5:00 in the morning. There's
nothing out there! Get out of my fucking way!

1490
01:39:21,464 --> 01:39:23,965
Fuck you, sid.
You're so stupid!

1491
01:39:23,966 --> 01:39:28,011
Get out of the fucking way!
You're so fucking weak!

1492
01:39:28,012 --> 01:39:32,015
Help me! Please, you're
so fucking weak and stupid.

1493
01:39:32,016 --> 01:39:34,726
Help me. Help me.
Ow.

1494
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:37,937
Fuck off! Fuck off!

1495
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:40,690
Fucking hell!
Will you get off?

1496
01:39:40,691 --> 01:39:43,609
- You wanna fucking die?
- Yeah!

1497
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:46,487
Then fucking die!
[Screams]

1498
01:39:46,488 --> 01:39:48,948
Fuck you!
[Grunts]

1499
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:53,953
[Sobbing]

1500
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:59,415
[Coughing]

1501
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,503
[Sobbing continues]
[Coughing continues]

1502
01:40:02,504 --> 01:40:06,966
Oh, shit.
[Panting]

1503
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:11,469
Oh, Sid.

1504
01:40:18,437 --> 01:40:23,940
Help me.

1505
01:40:46,923 --> 01:40:51,425
Oh, Sid.

1506
01:40:51,928 --> 01:40:57,431
I don't feel so good.

1507
01:41:09,446 --> 01:41:14,907
[Clattering]

1508
01:41:35,972 --> 01:41:40,474
[Grunts]

1509
01:41:40,518 --> 01:41:42,519
Sid.

1510
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:47,022
Sid!

1511
01:41:53,948 --> 01:41:58,450
[Whimpers]

1512
01:42:19,724 --> 01:42:26,770
You guys awake? I got something
here for you. Check it out.

1513
01:42:32,194 --> 01:42:35,697
Oh, Sid, this is
a serious fuckup, man.

1514
01:42:35,698 --> 01:42:37,699
Sid.

1515
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:41,703
[No audio]
I gotta take off.

1516
01:42:41,704 --> 01:42:47,665
It's a bad scene.
Whoa. [Departing footsteps]

1517
01:42:54,174 --> 01:42:58,676
Who called 911?

1518
01:42:59,722 --> 01:43:04,223
Did you call 911?

1519
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:12,692
- Sid Vicious, can I have a picture?
- Fuck off!

1520
01:43:12,693 --> 01:43:15,736
I'll smash your fucking cameras!
[All clamoring]

1521
01:43:15,737 --> 01:43:17,697
There he is!

1522
01:43:17,698 --> 01:43:21,242
Why'd you do it?
Get the punker!

1523
01:43:21,243 --> 01:43:23,703
One word:
Did you do it?

1524
01:43:23,704 --> 01:43:29,123
Oh, god!
[Gasping, grunting]

1525
01:43:29,126 --> 01:43:34,170
[Panting, coughing]

1526
01:43:42,139 --> 01:43:45,683
[Door opens]

1527
01:43:45,684 --> 01:43:47,685
[Guard]
Is that him?

1528
01:43:47,686 --> 01:43:51,730
[Guard #2] Yeah, that's him.
Sid Vicious.

1529
01:43:51,731 --> 01:43:56,192
[Chuckles]

1530
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:00,197
[Officer]
One candy bar.

1531
01:44:00,198 --> 01:44:03,242
One pack of cigarettes.
Look, kid, you're out on bail, right?

1532
01:44:03,243 --> 01:44:05,661
One safety pin.
Why don't you give yourself a break?

1533
01:44:05,662 --> 01:44:10,666
One stick of gum. I know you think
you're kinda tough, Ritchie.

1534
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:14,253
There's a lot of guys out there
a lot tougher. One leather-studded arm band.

1535
01:44:14,254 --> 01:44:17,673
You can walk out that door,
and you can stay out for good,

1536
01:44:17,674 --> 01:44:21,260
sixty-seven cents. Or you can turn around
and walk back in here again.

1537
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:26,722
Five hundred
forty dollars cash.

1538
01:44:28,726 --> 01:44:33,689
Sign here, please.
It's all up to you, Ritchie.

1539
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:38,233
I don't see any braces
on your legs.

1540
01:44:48,162 --> 01:44:50,205
Oh, yeah.
One more thing.

1541
01:44:50,206 --> 01:44:52,207
Sure, kid.
What is it?

1542
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:54,167

Yo, Sid, you want

[Rock]

1568
01:48:10,363 --> 01:48:12,113
Walking out of England

1569
01:48:12,114 --> 01:48:13,823
thinking you were the king

1570
01:48:13,824 --> 01:48:18,245
taking on this world

1571
01:48:18,246 --> 01:48:20,246
on that bus that goes
through Mexico

1572
01:48:20,247 --> 01:48:22,248
where killer love finds

1573
01:48:22,249 --> 01:48:26,044
a sweet Mexican girl

1574
01:48:26,045 --> 01:48:28,421
but in Mississippi

1575
01:48:28,422 --> 01:48:30,465

1576
01:48:30,466 --> 01:48:34,926

1577
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:36,429

1579
01:48:42,937 --> 01:48:44,395
down in Alabama

1580
01:48:44,396 --> 01:48:46,981

1581
01:48:46,982 --> 01:48:50,902

1586
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:05,041

1587
01:49:05,042 --> 01:49:07,293
giving me the chills

1588
01:49:07,294 --> 01:49:08,795
but if my hands

1589
01:49:08,796 --> 01:49:11,255

1590
01:49:11,256 --> 01:49:14,842

1598
01:49:47,793 --> 01:49:51,337
we were Riker's Island
on a population board

1599
01:49:51,338 --> 01:49:55,341
