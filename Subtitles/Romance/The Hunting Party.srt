00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,925
[Man chanting]

177
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:40,392

178
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:41,454

[Man laughing]

182
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,963
[Group laughing]

183
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:55,439
Look what the cat dragged in.

184
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:56,811
[All]
Duck!

185
00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:00,281
He has actually graced us with his presence.

186
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,013
And his expense account.
Drinks on the network.

187
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:04,521
No, it's not.
Don't listen to anything he says.

188
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:05,579
Hey, man.

189
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:07,148
Back in the trenches
with the commoners, huh?

190
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:09,353
- Oh, Brady, you look great.
- Good to see you, man.

191
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,589
- You look like shit, mate.
- So does your mama.

192
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:13,598
It's all that money and pussy.
It's fucking destroyed him.

193
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:15,156
Two Sarajevskas, please.

194
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,065
Excuse me if I can afford a bar of soap.

195
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,626
All y'all look like y'all need a bath.

196
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,797
[All]
Duck!

197
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:24,673
- We have a very special guest this evening.
- What?

198
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,507
- And she's a virgin.
[Men] - No.

199
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,809
We gonna get her fucked up!

200
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,816
Your first time,
and you're traveling with Duck?

201
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,441
I hope you brought your flak jacket.

202
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:34,383
Last newbie who traveled with him
lost one of his balls.

203
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,579
It's true.

204
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,419
That's why they sent the Duck
back to New York.

205
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,082
He attracts mortar fire like shit attracts flies.

206
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:42,217
- Jubilee, buddy.
- Jubilee.

207
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:45,025
[Duck]
It's good to see you.

208
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:48,067
It's insane. NATO has 20,000
peace-keeping troops

209
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,069
in a country half the size of Kentucky,

210
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:52,127
and they can't find
any of these fucking war criminals.

211
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:54,638
There's no way this country is going
to get its economy back up

212
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,766
until it starts catching
some of these assholes.

213
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,504
Until they catch the Fox.

214
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:00,875
[Duck]
Now that would be a great story.

215
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,539
Yeah? Who's the Fox?

216
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:06,949
[Men chuckle]

217
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,613
Where's that Bosnian war book
you've been reading?

218
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:10,848
Uh-oh.

219
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,152
It never gets old.

220
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,283
It's not pretty.

221
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,349
Thank you.

222
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:17,054
[Men chuckle]

223
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,792
Doctor Dragoslav Boghanovic,
the Fox,

224
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:23,597
is the most wanted war criminal in Bosnia.

225
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,831
During the war,
he ordered the rape and murder

226
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:29,069
of thousands of innocent Muslims.

227
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,647
There's a $5 million bounty
on his little arrogant head.

228
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,676
Oh.

229
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,048
Yeah.

230
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:42,112
You got everyone from the UN,

231
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,556
CIA, and NATO,

232
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:46,956
and every bounty hunter
from here to Chuck Norris

233
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,119
looking for him.

234
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:51,096
[Journalist]
I think that poor boy needs
some slivovice quick.

235
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,798
It's good.

236
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:54,960
It's brandy.

237
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,832
Yeah? How good?

238
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:59,167
Let's put it this way.
There's an old Bosnian saying

239
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,470
that when a bottle of this stuff
is on the table,

240
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,375
the devil's sitting in the corner laughing.

241
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,774
[Benjamin]
You know what I was just thinking of?

242
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,013
If every day is a holiday
at the Holiday Inn...

243
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:14,076
- That's not your room.
- I know.

244
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,180
Then what do they do...

245
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:18,919
What do they do about Christmas time?

246
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,790
Look, man,
if I don't see you at breakfast,

247
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:22,489
I'm going to have NATO send a task force

248
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:23,689
to search for you.

249
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:25,699
Okay.

250
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,667
Good night, Duck.

251
00:13:27,736 --> 00:13:28,964
Hey, hey, hey!

252
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:30,060
Duck!

253
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,264
Oh, God.

254
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,568
Oh, God.

255
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,335
[Door closes]

256
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:45,086
- Hello, Duckie.
- Oh, fuck!

257
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:49,650
Simon.

258
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,894
Surprise.

259
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:56,228
How the hell are you?

260
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,667
Get over here.

261
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,002
Been good.

262
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,506
Been good.
Been around.

263
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,873
Amazing how many
crappy wars you'll find

264
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:11,037
if you go looking for 'em.

265
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:14,514
- But you're okay?
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

266
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,107
I've been getting through.

267
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,583
I hope you don't mind.
I raided your honor bar over there.

268
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:24,990
Purloined a few
of your little bottles of vodka.

269
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,652
So what else is new?

270
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:30,027
I watched you guys today
doing your report up on a bridge.

271
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:32,090
Franklin's not looking half bad.

272
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,193
He have some work done?

273
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,170
- Eyelift.
- Oh.

274
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,208
- But you were watching us, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,800
Yeah, I was...

276
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,335
I was hoping maybe I could convince you

277
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:47,406
to shoot my stand-up report
tomorrow at the ceremony.

278
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:49,747
You know, old times' sake.

279
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,287
Yeah, sure.

280
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:54,050
You know,
I could save a little money

281
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:58,116
if I didn't have to hire
a cameraman, so...

282
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:02,358
I'm going to sell it
to the Germans or Jamaicans.

283
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,200
Yeah.

284
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,038
Fuck, Simon.

285
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,479
You know, I meant to try
and track you down.

286
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:26,952
Don't worry about it.

287
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:36,157
Don't worry, Duck.

288
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:47,141
I heard rumors.

289
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,611
They're all true.

290
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,246
I got something, Duck.

291
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,146
Not just the anniversary,
I got a real story.

292
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,454
Something that could put me
right back on the map.

293
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:07,628
I thought you might be interested. Huh?

294
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,771
It's not like I don't want to.

295
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,864
I just...

296
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,640
You know, I'd do anything for you.

297
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:24,204
But I'm meeting this girl in Greece
the day after tomorrow,

298
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:27,774
and it's just not something
I can cancel, you know?

299
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,217
Just shitty timing.

300
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:33,417
I got this three-week vacation and all.

301
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,118
Look, but I'll still do
your stand-up tomorrow.

302
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,719
Look, l... I got to get out of here.

303
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,191
What, already?

304
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:43,761
Simon!

305
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,804
- Great to see you, Duck.
- Simon!

306
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,803
[Applause]

307
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:55,334
## [March]

308
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:02,384
The white doves released
to denote peace around the world.

309
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:06,720
Peace especially in Sarajevo
and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

310
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,926
Simon Hunt.

311
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,268
I thought you were dead.

312
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,532
Franklin.

313
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,302
You look good.

314
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,774
Very taut.

315
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,606
Duck said you were coming by here.

316
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,945
That's fine with me
if you wanna piggyback with us.

317
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,509
- I got no hard feelings.
- Oh, thank you.

318
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,555
Thank you, Franklin.
Magnanimous as always.

319
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,853
I promise I won't try to steal Duckie back.

320
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,122
Oh, you can't afford him.
Hell, I could hardly afford him.

321
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,596
Benjamin, meet Simon Hunt,
a former star with our network.

322
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,997
Simon, Benjamin Strauss.

323
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,094
Benjamin, you look young enough
to be someone important's son.

324
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,969
Yeah. The network vice-president's.

325
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,943
You know, I thought you were dead, too.

326
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,999
[Duck laughs]

327
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,546
What?

328
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,707
[Franklin]
Simon used to be our best correspondent

329
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:07,242
till he flamed out on national television.

330
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,446
Yeah. No, I remember.

331
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,048
I mean, we studied it
in journalism school.

332
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:22,562
Reporting from
the five-year anniversary ceremony

333
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,595
for Jamaican television,
this is Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

334
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,335
Reporting for Peruvian state television,

335
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,074
I'm Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

336
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,879
Reporting for
the Polish television news network,

337
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,216
I'm Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

338
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,416
I hope one of these bastards buys this.

339
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,516
Hope so.

340
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:49,585
Check the atlas.
I don't think you got any countries left.

341
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,324
Yeah, well,

342
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,956
considering what I got up my sleeve,

343
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,398
it won't matter much.

344
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,508
Hey, get this back to the hotel.
I'll meet you there later.

345
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:06,468
All right, daddy, what's the story?

346
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,714
[Simon]
You make the call?

347
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:11,911
[Duck]
What call?

348
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,454
To your little Greek souvlaki.

349
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,622
'Cause this story's too big to waste

350
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:22,459
if you're just going to get on a plane
like Facelift Franklin.

351
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,635
You're getting soft, Duckie.

352
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:32,469
You've gotten real soft
around the edges.

353
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,531
You're like a racehorse
that's been put out to pasture.

354
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,338
Yeah, and you can fuck off, Simon.

355
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,971
But when I know that you're ready
to do serious journalism,

356
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:42,140
instead of that anchorman fluff
they've reduced you to,

357
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:43,478
I'll fill you in, okay?

358
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,046
What's the story, you motherfucker?

359
00:19:52,494 --> 00:19:53,518
It's good.

360
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,958
It's really good.

361
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,524
What?

362
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:06,738
What?

363
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:16,717
You know the Fox?

364
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:20,454
Pompous bastard who's responsible
for all of this?

365
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,099
Yeah.

366
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,031
I know where he's hiding.

367
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:55,081
[Duck]
So this great source of yours
knows where he's hiding,

368
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:56,716
just like that?

369
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:57,953
Yeah. Correct.

370
00:20:58,026 --> 00:21:00,722
And we're going to find him
and score an interview.

371
00:21:00,797 --> 00:21:01,786
Correct.

372
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:03,456
Go where no bounty hunter

373
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,592
or U.S. Marine has ever gone before.

374
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:06,828
Correct.

375
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,337
You are out of your fucking mind.

376
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:19,513
Okay. What about the bodyguards
that he travels with, Simon?

377
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,140
Have you thought about that?

378
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:23,947
Yeah. Word is he's got 20
armed guards with him at all times.

379
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:25,749
Yeah? Well, I heard it's 50.

380
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:27,949
- Fifty?
- Fifty.

381
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:29,959
Maybe.

382
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:32,358
Actually, some people
believe he has none.

383
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:33,793
Stupid people.

384
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:35,229
Doesn't matter.

385
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:38,029
He's expecting NATO troops,
not two jerks in a car.

386
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,500
We can get right up to him.

387
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,627
I know the town.

388
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:42,365
- I have directions.
- You got directions?

389
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:44,998
What, somebody said
"Make a left at the first Quickie-Mart"?

390
00:21:45,075 --> 00:21:47,168
I don't think they have
Quickie-Marts in Bosnia, Duckie.

391
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:52,372
Okay, Simon.
This great source of yours...

392
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:55,212
How do you even know
that you can trust him?

393
00:21:58,722 --> 00:21:59,950
It's real.

394
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:05,761
He says he's hiding
up in the mountains of Celibici,

395
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:08,297
right by the border of Montenegro.

396
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,526
You go one step over the border,
NATO can't catch you.

397
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:11,863
No, no, no.

398
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:15,427
- They've been printing that gossip...
- He's there. He's in the mountains.

399
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,133
He's there! He...

400
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,141
He's an hour and a half
up an unpaved road.

401
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,939
He's surrounded
by sympathetic Bosnian Serbs

402
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:24,139
who will protect him...

403
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,682
at all costs.

404
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:31,587
That's just fucking great.

405
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:33,452
We're leaving first thing in the morning.

406
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:41,326
If you could see me in this bikini, Duck,
you wouldn't be doing this.

407
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,996
Come on. Come on, baby.

408
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:46,833
Look, it's... I promise it's just going
to be two more days, okay?

409
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,938
Oh, well, I can wait.

410
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:52,067
But I don't know for how long.

411
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:54,338
You're torturing me.

412
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:55,777
<i>And you're torturing me.</i>

413
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:57,075
So we're even.

414
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:01,343
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

415
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:07,685
I must be a complete fucking idiot.

416
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,785
Hey, look, I know I'm new
and green and a joke to you,

417
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:12,727
but I just graduated
from Harvard, okay?

418
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:15,425
And I know something's up.

419
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,799
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

420
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:20,201
Oh, come on.
You and Simon, you're onto a story.

421
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:22,736
Me and Simon are just hanging out.

422
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:25,299
I saw your girlfriend when she
came by the office two weeks ago.

423
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:26,640
She is hotter than hot.

424
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,805
You don't leave her in Greece to hang out.

425
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:32,783
You been listening to my conversations?

426
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:33,977
No.

427
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,486
No, it was, um...

428
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:37,613
No, the official term
is eavesdropping, all right?

429
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:40,146
Little shit.

430
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:43,928
Look, I know something's up, all right?

431
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:44,985
I want in on it.

432
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,530
Forget it. There's no story.

433
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,657
I went to Harvard, okay?
I know there's a story.

434
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:51,134
What is up with this Harvard shit?

435
00:23:51,203 --> 00:23:52,932
You know, I dated a girl
from Harvard once,

436
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:54,802
and she wasn't so fucking bright.

437
00:23:57,143 --> 00:23:59,635
Look, my father is a cold,
mean son of a bitch,

438
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:01,680
and he thinks I'm soft and weak

439
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:03,578
and not quite cut out for this type of work.

440
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:05,584
And there's no way on God's green earth
I'm going to prove that to him

441
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:08,313
by letting you get
a great story without me.

442
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:10,515
How do you know it's so great?

443
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,057
You're hanging out with a guy

444
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:13,752
who had a fucking meltdown
on national television

445
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:15,226
and is a punch line in the business.

446
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:17,422
If it wasn't good, you wouldn't be doing it.

447
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:26,234
Look at you.

448
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:28,364
Little Mike-fucking-Wallace.

449
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,538
Okay.

450
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:35,474
But Simon ain't going to like this.

451
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,213
Yeah?

452
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:40,185
Well, I ain't going to like Simon.

453
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:50,954
[Duck]
You see, his main bodyguard

454
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,262
is this psychopathic little fuck
named Srdjan.

455
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:56,268
He had a real fondness

456
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:59,464
for raping and mutilating
these very young Muslim girls

457
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,565
as he was ethnically cleansing the villages.

458
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:05,805
- Jesus.
- Oh, that ain't the good part.

459
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,746
Shit, the good part,
Benjamin, is this Srdjan,

460
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:10,874
the guy in charge of protecting the Fox,

461
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:14,682
he's got this tattoo on his forehead
that reads in Cyrillic,

462
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:17,189
"I was dead the day I was born."

463
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,720
They teach that evil shit at Harvard?

464
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:27,400
Now, we are headed right into the heart
of this Balkan madness,

465
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:28,958
into Serb territory.

466
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:30,560
Republica Srpska.

467
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:31,900
It's a backward land

468
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:34,771
where they will kill you
for trying to hurt Boghanovic

469
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:36,741
as easily as somebody kills a mosquito.

470
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:39,670
The Fox is their god.

471
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:42,809
People protect their god.

472
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:47,715
Now, if you're still interested...

473
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:49,585
we leave in 20 minutes.

474
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:15,543
Let's go find us some war criminals.

475
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,840
# 20, 24 hours ago #

476
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:46,642
# I wanna... I wanna be #

477
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:49,115
# I wanna be sedated #

478
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:51,949
Hey, Benjamin, you know what that is
that we're passing?

479
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,285
Yeah, it looks like, uh, a ski lift.

480
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:57,723
[Duck]
'84 Winter Olympics
was held right here in Sarajevo.

481
00:26:57,794 --> 00:27:02,356
Eight years later, the Fox used this area
as a staging ground for his snipers.

482
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,696
Won the gold medal, triple lutz.

483
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,428
Best all around scumbag.

484
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,026
Are you going to be playing that damn thing
all the way to Montenegro?

485
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,834
Yep. Simon never liked
my guitar playing.

486
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,272
Really?

487
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:14,810
Can't say I do, either.

488
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:17,842
So it's going to be like that, huh?

489
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:22,149
# 20, 20, 24 hours a day #

490
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:25,517
- All right. Very funny.
- # I want to play the damn thing #

491
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:28,289
[Benjamin]
So what is your master plan?

492
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:30,087
You have a contact when we get to this town?

493
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,593
Nope. Never been up there before.

494
00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:35,358
I'm just going to start knocking on doors.

495
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:38,195
[Duck]
You see that? Signs are in Cyrillic now.

496
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:41,361
We've entered Republica Srpska.

497
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:42,530
That quickly?

498
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:44,301
[Duck]
Ten minutes outside of Sarajevo,

499
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:47,366
and we're in the land
of milk and honey and rape and pillage.

500
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,776
- Are we going to be okay here?
[Simon] - Who the hell knows?

501
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:53,613
But $5 million is $5 million,
and I'm not stopping.

502
00:27:55,218 --> 00:27:57,015
$5 million?

503
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:58,850
Reward.

504
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,047
3 is for me.

505
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:02,115
The rest is for you guys
to split as you please.

506
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:04,284
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Reward?

507
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,352
You're not actually thinking
of capturing him, are you?

508
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:09,160
He may be thinking it,
but it ain't going to happen.

509
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:12,066
- Don't be so sure.
- Don't be so stupid.

510
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:15,731
After this interview's finished,
everything's in play, my friends.

511
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,706
Whoa. Hold on.
Duck, this is nuts.

512
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:19,333
You're not really supporting this, are you?

513
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,173
One time in Rwanda,

514
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:24,339
Simon decided he was going
to assassinate the leader of the Hutus

515
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:25,643
and end the war.

516
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:27,513
Three days later, he was in Morocco

517
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:29,552
getting a massage
from a hooker named Gladys.

518
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,648
Simon has his whims,
but this one I am not supporting.

519
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:35,055
This isn't a whim.

520
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,855
You know what this means to me.

521
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:39,897
Okay, we are journalists.
We can't do this.

522
00:28:39,963 --> 00:28:42,523
It's... It's unethical and... and insane.

523
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,329
It would be a pleasure
to personally catch him.

524
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:47,597
By ourselves. By ourselves.
We don't even have any weapons.

525
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:49,663
If I gave you a gun,
would you know how to use it?

526
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:50,729
No.

527
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,605
Then what the fuck
are you complaining about?

528
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,114
I told you.

529
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:01,550
The moment you start drinking
that Bosnian brandy,

530
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:04,382
the devil's sitting in the corner
just laughing.

531
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:08,389
[Gunshot]

532
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,264
[Gunshot]

533
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:49,399
[Benjamin]
Do we know any actual facts at all, guys?

534
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:50,901
<i>[Duck]
My buddy at Newsweek says</i>

535
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,665
he's so afraid of getting caught

536
00:29:52,738 --> 00:29:56,139
that he's grown his hair out
and has a full Orthodox beard.

537
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,767
Funny. 'Cause I heard
he actually shaved his head.

538
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:00,277
He's bald as a turd.

539
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,946
[Simon]
Now, what we do know is that the Fox
drives in a convoy of orange cars.

540
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,077
All right?
So we should keep a lookout for them.

541
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,349
That's funny, Simon.
I heard he's traveling around

542
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:12,447
in a stolen UN de-mining vehicle.

543
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:14,857
Well then, we should keep
an eye out for that, too.

544
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:15,916
[Benjamin]
Yeah, that's great.

545
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:18,156
There's only a thousand
UN de-mining trucks in this country.

546
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,493
Why don't we stop each one?

547
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:22,160
"Hey, knock, knock.
Is the Fox in there? No?"

548
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,760
Okay, well, we should be done in,
what, say, 9 to 12 years.

549
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:27,639
One second he's pissing himself

550
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:29,572
'cause he's afraid we might
actually run into the Fox,

551
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:32,440
the next he's complaining
'cause we probably won't.

552
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:35,002
No, I'm not... I'm not complaining.

553
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,276
I'm mocking.

554
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:42,620
[Speaking Serbian]

555
00:30:42,689 --> 00:30:43,678
Wow.

556
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:46,986
The Doctor is not bald.

557
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:52,356
He is not desperate.

558
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:54,297
And he is not in Celibici.

559
00:30:58,438 --> 00:31:01,066
He is everywhere.

560
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:03,371
He know everything.

561
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,810
He listens to everything you say.

562
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,644
And if you get close to the Fox,

563
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,514
if you corner him,

564
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:16,245
then even God can't help you.

565
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:26,324
[Benjamin]
What the fuck was that about?

566
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,661
A little warning.

567
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:29,293
Yeah? It seemed more like a threat.

568
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:33,773
Yeah. Beware of the nosy waiter
with Serbian pride.

569
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,706
Actually, it was the first time that I thought

570
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:38,040
that maybe Simon wasn't
jerking our chain.

571
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,237
Yeah? Why is that?

572
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:42,475
Because the guy in there said
that he's not in Celebici,

573
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,246
which means maybe
he actually is in Celebici.

574
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,412
Right.
Unless he's really not in Celebici.

575
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,890
Well, that's a possibility, too.

576
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,563
- Jeez!
- Holy shit!

577
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,195
Get down!

578
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:06,295
[Gunshot]
Hold on.

579
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,721
What in the fuck was that about, man?

580
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,622
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

581
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,750
We're going to die.

582
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:27,760
Every single person out here
knows exactly what we're doing.

583
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,887
Keep your panties dry, Benjamin.

584
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:32,592
- It had nothing to do with the Fox.
- What the hell do you mean?

585
00:32:32,668 --> 00:32:34,795
It's just a little local tradition
to shoot at every customer?

586
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:40,807
Wait a minute.
Is that my money?

587
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,436
You mean the money I left on the table?
That's mine?

588
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:45,912
- Simon!
- Times are tight.

589
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:48,211
- Things happen. Sue me.
- Wait, wait, wait.

590
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:50,251
You stole the money
that was left for the bill?

591
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,254
- I needed it more.
- Okay, you got us shot at for 20 bucks.

592
00:32:53,322 --> 00:32:55,688
I didn't know he was going
to shoot at us.

593
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:03,695
Unbelievable!

594
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:09,129
Much gunplay when you and Franklin

595
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:11,832
do your stories about
the president's new tax code?

596
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,772
- Fuck off.
- Come on, Duckie.

597
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:16,310
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

598
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:18,847
A little taste of what you left behind?

599
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,782
Don't say you didn't.

600
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:27,016
<i># It's a bad situation in a beautiful place #</i>

601
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:30,924
<i># It's a bad situation in a beautiful place #</i>

602
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:36,864
<i># It's a bad situation #</i>

603
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,778
[Simon]
That pile of rubble used to be a mosque.

604
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:56,614
Now the town's
a hundred percent Bosnian Serb.

605
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,415
No Muslims left.

606
00:33:58,488 --> 00:34:01,458
Ethnically cleansed for your protection.

607
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:02,822
Nice vibe, right?

608
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:07,489
[Simon]
There's a reason they say
the river runs red in Foca...

609
00:34:07,563 --> 00:34:09,759
and it ain't because of the wine.

610
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,528
[Benjamin]
What does the Cyrillic say?

611
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,069
It says, "Don't touch him."

612
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,779
- Wait. Where are you going?
- The police.

613
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:24,973
Need a good laugh.

614
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:27,449
[Man]
War criminals?

615
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:29,383
Believe it or not,
we don't even have a copy

616
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:31,353
of the complete indictment list.

617
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:33,322
[Duck] - You don't?
- No.

618
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,415
Do you have a copy?
I could always Xerox it.

619
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,859
Miriam, is the copier working again?

620
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:43,924
Word has it there's a bunch of them
living right here in Foca.

621
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,697
Could be.

622
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:49,637
Unfortunately, we're here
to reform the police force,

623
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,231
not hunt for war criminals.

624
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:52,741
[Duck]
But it wouldn't be much hunting.

625
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:55,301
I mean, most of them are listed
right in the phone book.

626
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,646
As I said, we're not authorized
to arrest war criminals.

627
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:02,652
- You are the international police, right?
- Yes.

628
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,414
Under the flag of the United Nations.

629
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:06,821
I thought the UN was looking
for war criminals.

630
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:09,552
We are. Aggressively.

631
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:12,117
There's a $5 million reward, you know?

632
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,925
But you said you don't have
an indictment list.

633
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:15,522
We don't.

634
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,589
Donut?

635
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:21,061
Donut.

636
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:23,039
Flown in from Bonn.

637
00:35:23,107 --> 00:35:24,097
Very black market.

638
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:27,542
I particularly like the chocolate ones
with the rainbow sprinkles.

639
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:33,111
You see, it's the UN that are looking
for war criminals,

640
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:35,277
not the UN police task force.

641
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:38,016
No, not the ones
who could actually catch them.

642
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:40,785
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

643
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,055
Sounds like the usual UN jerk-off to me.

644
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:44,289
You got any milk?

645
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:47,364
[Duck]
Look, we're headed up to Celibici now.

646
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:50,401
We just figured we'd stop in
and register with you

647
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:53,164
just in case we got killed
or something like that.

648
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,605
Well, consider yourselves registered.

649
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:59,269
Miriam, uh, be a love and get me a tea.

650
00:35:59,344 --> 00:36:01,039
Four sugars.

651
00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:03,308
Oh, and a glass of milk.

652
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,148
[Duck]
Is there any word

653
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:08,515
on what's going up there now?

654
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:10,986
Well, something.

655
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:13,650
It's third time this year
we've been ordered to stay away.

656
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:17,987
From Celibici?

657
00:36:18,797 --> 00:36:20,287
[Policeman]
Suspicious, no?

658
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:22,231
Yeah.

659
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:24,462
Who ordered you?

660
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,004
UN command.

661
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:29,097
Told us to stay away
for four or five days.

662
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:30,836
Jesus fucking Christ.

663
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,470
They tell the police
not to go up to Celebici.

664
00:36:33,546 --> 00:36:35,605
I mean, he's actually up there.
I can't fucking believe this.

665
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,547
Why would they tell them
not to go up there?

666
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:39,048
Tell them not to go up there

667
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,313
because I don't want them
walking into a shootout.

668
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:43,947
Now, really...

669
00:36:44,024 --> 00:36:45,422
tell me the truth.

670
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,551
Who the fuck are you guys?

671
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:52,120
I told you, we are journalists.

672
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,291
Journalists?

673
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:55,162
Yeah. You have our press credentials.

674
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:56,224
Yes.

675
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,231
Very professionally done.

676
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,842
So, uh, you are journalists who believe

677
00:37:05,912 --> 00:37:09,439
that they can get close to someone
that no one else can.

678
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:13,111
Yeah. What's the problem?

679
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:14,517
I understand.

680
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:15,577
I understand.

681
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:18,089
You are journalists on a story.

682
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:21,789
What, you think we're just posing
as journalists?

683
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:30,325
Do you like beer?
I like beer. Do you like beer?

684
00:37:30,403 --> 00:37:31,768
Let's get a beer.

685
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:36,102
## [Singing in foreign language]

686
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:40,440
For a group of UN guards to go,
it's too dangerous.

687
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:42,914
For you guys? Sure, why not?

688
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:44,382
Go to Celibici.

689
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:46,044
Do the world a favor.

690
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,056
I'm sorry, are you still insinuating
we're a CIA hit squad or something?

691
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:52,455
I'm sorry, are you still insinuating
you're journalists?

692
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:56,753
Look, um...

693
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,493
I know things.

694
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:02,195
I know how things operate.

695
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,794
I've been waiting for you.

696
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:09,608
Certain things need to be taken
care of professionally, right?

697
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:11,338
- Took me months...
- Shh.

698
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:16,706
Took me months to gain the trust
of certain people

699
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:19,048
who normally would be protecting
the Fox.

700
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:22,453
That's how I know you didn't just stumble on
the fact he's up in Celibici.

701
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:24,787
Well, it's been printed in the press.

702
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:27,692
So has the horoscopes.
Do you believe them?

703
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,891
- You're not making any sense now.
- I know.

704
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,160
I'm the United Nations.

705
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:45,246
And fact is, the United Nations...

706
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:47,544
Oh, fuck.
The French specifically,

707
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:49,640
they have no interest
in catching the Fox.

708
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:51,845
They would be happy
if he killed all the Muslims.

709
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,320
Save them all this money and energy.

710
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:56,619
John Major and the British
backed the Fox,

711
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:59,354
even though they would never
publicly admit it.

712
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:02,022
And the Americans...
Yeah, they brokered the peace agreement,

713
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:04,895
but some would suggest
they made a secret deal with the Fox

714
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,866
that if he stepped down from power,

715
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:09,096
they would not arrest him for war crimes.

716
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:14,407
Who knows what's true, what isn't?
The whole fucking thing is dirty.

717
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:17,206
But in dirty times...

718
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,111
dirty deeds need to be done, right?

719
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:24,678
One arm of the government said
it would do something, does nothing.

720
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:25,948
That would be us.

721
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:27,387
The other hand...

722
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:29,823
CIA...

723
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:31,655
whoever...

724
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:33,695
does something else.

725
00:39:33,763 --> 00:39:35,355
I mean, look at you guys.

726
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:38,524
Do you really think you're fooling anyone?

727
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:43,963
[Duck]
He thinks we're a hit squad.

728
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,770
- He thinks we're a fucking hit squad!
[Benjamin] - Yeah, this can't be good.

729
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,641
Isn't it illegal, impersonating a CIA officer?

730
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:51,009
[Duck]
Yeah, but we denied it.

731
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,138
[Benjamin]
Yeah, he didn't believe it.

732
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:55,013
It's true.
It's like the more we fucking denied it,

733
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,517
the more he didn't believe it.

734
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:59,351
Yeah, the problem is,
if you were CIA you would deny it.

735
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:02,323
And if you weren't,
you would also deny it.

736
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:04,223
Actually he's not that far
off the mark, you know?

737
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:05,555
I mean, we're not CIA,

738
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:07,529
but we can do a lot more

739
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:11,227
than just interview the Fox.

740
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,893
Wait. Hold up.

741
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:15,598
- Simon.
- What?

742
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,765
Now, you're not still
on this capturing jag?

743
00:40:18,842 --> 00:40:21,276
It's not a jag.

744
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:24,507
Not a jag, not a whim.
Especially now.

745
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:27,778
Especially since Boris basically confirmed
that he's hiding out up there.

746
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,113
Okay. Now, now, Simon,

747
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:31,279
I was willing to come along with you

748
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:34,324
and try to even get close enough
to this psychopathic fuck

749
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:37,326
to try and get an interview.

750
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,555
But we are not capturing him.

751
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,222
I mean, look at us.

752
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:44,095
That's not what we do.

753
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:46,295
I'm checking into that hotel

754
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,564
down the road.

755
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:50,300
I'm taking a shower,
a shit, and a Seconal.

756
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:51,603
Tomorrow morning I'm getting up,

757
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:53,336
I'm driving up that mountain to Celibici,

758
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,537
and I am finding the Fox.

759
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:57,512
Now, you're welcome to join me, Duckie,

760
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,640
or you're welcome to fuck off.

761
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:01,206
Your choice.

762
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,560
[Benjamin]
You think this is crazy too, huh?

763
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,032
I mean, just trying
to get an interview is crazy.

764
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,899
But we're not mercenaries.

765
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,600
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to be
on fucking vacation.

766
00:41:23,674 --> 00:41:25,666
And it makes sense why he had
a meltdown on air.

767
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:26,834
He's a goddamn nut job.

768
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,910
Yeah, Simon is a goddamn nut job,

769
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:34,247
but his meltdown wasn't for nothing.

770
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,947
We'd seen some horrible stuff that day.

771
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:39,251
Yeah, reporters see horrible things
all the time.

772
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:42,921
That's what they do.

773
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,529
Yeah.

774
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,659
Look, I saw the tape, okay?
He was drunk, high.

775
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,635
He just fucking lost it.

776
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:55,195
He lost it then,
and he's losing it now.

777
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:04,514
There was these two girls, right?

778
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:07,881
Named Marda and Una.

779
00:42:07,953 --> 00:42:10,887
They said they were cousins but...

780
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:13,583
We used to hang out together
from time to time.

781
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,889
Who the hell knows why they were there.

782
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:17,258
It was war.

783
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,320
People was broke.

784
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:21,832
People did things.

785
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:24,096
All I know is...

786
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,137
we had a good time.

787
00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:28,138
They were our friends.

788
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,170
Somewhere along the line,

789
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:35,304
maybe the second
or third year into the war,

790
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:37,941
Simon and Marda,
they had a little thing.

791
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:44,451
Hell, it was more than a little thing.

792
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:48,050
Simon, he liked her.

793
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:51,491
He did things for her.

794
00:42:51,565 --> 00:42:54,796
Whatever little money he had, he gave her.

795
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:56,425
They didn't spend that much time together.

796
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:59,165
But it was war, how can you?

797
00:42:59,238 --> 00:43:03,972
But Simon,
in his own little crazy way,

798
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:05,840
he loved her.

799
00:43:08,747 --> 00:43:12,047
Now, you fast-forward six months.

800
00:43:12,118 --> 00:43:15,245
Sarajevo's under siege worse than ever.

801
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:19,155
And we haven't heard from Marda
or her cousin for months now.

802
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:20,920
And only thing we knew

803
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:23,121
was that Marda had gone back to Polje

804
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:24,663
to help out her mother.

805
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:30,802
And then one day we hear
about a serious incident in Polje,

806
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,930
and we go there to cover it.

807
00:43:35,176 --> 00:43:39,111
The horrors we saw.

808
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:40,806
Fucking inhuman.

809
00:43:43,183 --> 00:43:45,515
Neither Simon nor I said anything,

810
00:43:45,586 --> 00:43:47,281
you know, although we both knew

811
00:43:47,354 --> 00:43:49,755
that Marda was from this town.

812
00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:52,587
We just got ready to do our job,

813
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,218
cover our story.

814
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:58,922
Inez,

815
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,934
Jasmine,

816
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:02,196
Amar,

817
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:03,895
Amin.

818
00:44:03,971 --> 00:44:04,960
No?

819
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:06,768
How about Aidan?

820
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:10,641
Or how about Simon Junior?

821
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:16,543
[Duck]
And then there she was.

822
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:19,450
Twenty minutes before
we went on the air.

823
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:25,722
They had shot her in her stomach five times.

824
00:44:28,195 --> 00:44:32,063
So don't believe everything
that you learn in journalism school,

825
00:44:32,134 --> 00:44:35,934
'cause in war...

826
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:37,868
what you see

827
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:39,167
and what really happened

828
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,573
are sometimes two very different things.

829
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:49,515
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

830
00:45:35,864 --> 00:45:40,665
[Men laughing]

831
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:13,628
Simon!

832
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,001
Simon, no! No! No!

833
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:17,562
Okay? Okay? Come on.

834
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,335
- It's all right.
- You okay?

835
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:23,243
Wait! Simon, no! Wait!

836
00:46:23,312 --> 00:46:25,780
- Let go!
- No! Simon! Come on!

837
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:28,807
You fucking shit!

838
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:31,320
No! No! No!

839
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,821
No! Please, Simon.

840
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,289
Please.

841
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:36,348
It's okay.

842
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:47,493
[Sobbing, incoherent]

843
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:50,463
Fuck.

844
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,037
Oh, fuck, man.

845
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,669
I know.

846
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:41,957
Watch the land mines.

847
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,220
Okay, shut up.

848
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:13,919
You see that?

849
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,695
What was that? A lookout?

850
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:19,627
My God, Duck.
I think he's really up there.

851
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:22,929
They're watching every car
that goes up this mountain.

852
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:28,066
Hold on, boys.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

853
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:42,947
Wait, hold on.

854
00:48:43,022 --> 00:48:44,148
Wait, wait, wait.

855
00:48:45,157 --> 00:48:46,988
Back, back, back, back, back.

856
00:48:48,294 --> 00:48:50,057
You are out of your mind.

857
00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:51,926
Correct.

858
00:49:52,994 --> 00:49:55,655
Where's the welcoming committee?

859
00:49:55,729 --> 00:49:59,665
Be thankful that there aren't
50 Kalashnikovs pointed at our heads.

860
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:02,224
So what are you going to do?

861
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,133
I'm going to do what
any good journalist would do

862
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:05,900
when he gets to a new place.

863
00:50:05,973 --> 00:50:08,134
Yeah? What's that?

864
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:09,971
I'm going to find a bar.

865
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:55,579
Doesn't exactly look like they get
many newcomers in here.

866
00:50:55,657 --> 00:50:58,125
Just keep smiling. You'll be fine.

867
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:06,891
What did he say?

868
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:10,164
He said you're about skinny enough
to be used as bait.

869
00:51:10,238 --> 00:51:13,536
- Yeah. It's a fishing joke.
- Yeah, no. I get it.

870
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:19,809
Duck, I hope you have money.

871
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:21,940
What happened to the 20
I gave you yesterday?

872
00:51:26,822 --> 00:51:29,290
[Speaking Serbian]

873
00:51:31,393 --> 00:51:32,485
Simon, save some for me.

874
00:51:32,562 --> 00:51:33,960
[Speaking Serbian]

875
00:51:57,787 --> 00:52:00,312
What is he saying?

876
00:52:00,388 --> 00:52:02,823
He just sold you and me out.

877
00:52:02,892 --> 00:52:04,484
- Thank you, Simon.
- Great.

878
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,548
You're welcome.

879
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:26,743
Do you really think we would
sell out leader of our people

880
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:29,341
for a simple glass of cheap brandy?

881
00:52:29,419 --> 00:52:33,651
Do you really think the people
of Republica Srpska are that weak?

882
00:52:35,258 --> 00:52:37,921
We don't go University like you people do.

883
00:52:37,994 --> 00:52:42,728
But we are not dumb,
and we don't like to be made fun of.

884
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:44,356
We are not making fun of you.

885
00:52:44,434 --> 00:52:46,664
Bullshit! You continue even now.

886
00:52:46,736 --> 00:52:49,001
Don't insult me by acting otherwise.

887
00:52:51,108 --> 00:52:52,803
Okay, we don't want any trouble.

888
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:54,536
You know how I got
these animals on wall?

889
00:52:58,115 --> 00:53:01,049
- I shoot them.
- All right.

890
00:53:01,118 --> 00:53:03,086
We're going to be leaving now.

891
00:53:03,153 --> 00:53:04,450
Yes, I think so.

892
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,455
[Speaking Serbian]

893
00:53:06,523 --> 00:53:08,286
- One question before we go.
- Simon...

894
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:10,588
Did you ever go hunting with him?

895
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:25,867
I mean, uh, he got his nickname
because he loved to hunt foxes.

896
00:53:25,943 --> 00:53:27,605
You obviously love to hunt foxes.

897
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:29,441
I was just wondering.

898
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,507
In a war, I kill people like you.

899
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:37,584
The war is over.

900
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:40,418
Yes, yes, it is.

901
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:43,654
Wait.

902
00:53:46,164 --> 00:53:47,426
Did you hunt with him?

903
00:53:47,498 --> 00:53:50,261
- For fuck's sake, Simon.
- You are one brave motherfucker.

904
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:54,466
Hey. Duck.

905
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:55,938
Duck, look.

906
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:59,374
You're just like those stupid
United Nations people

907
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,880
that poke around,
seeing if one of us will talk.

908
00:54:02,947 --> 00:54:06,383
You tell your friends
that we know nothing here.

909
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,181
Tell them that we lost loved ones
in the war, too.

910
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:10,448
Not just the Muslims.

911
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:12,318
You tell them that.

912
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,484
I make sure you get back down the road
without dying.

913
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:20,523
Or at least I do my best.

914
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:22,666
What do you mean, you saw his cars?

915
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:25,898
While you were back there
being a complete fucking asshole,

916
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,097
Benjamin saw them out the door.

917
00:54:28,172 --> 00:54:29,503
Jesus. Which way did they go?

918
00:54:29,575 --> 00:54:31,065
- Back down the mountain.
- Go!

919
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,575
Get in the car!

920
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,339
Shit! Fuck!

921
00:54:42,254 --> 00:54:44,154
What are we going to do,
run 'em off the road?

922
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:47,124
- I don't know.
- These men are killers, Simon!

923
00:54:47,192 --> 00:54:49,183
- Fuck these roads!
- Simon.

924
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:51,092
Kid's got a point.

925
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,460
So does my dick.

926
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:54,624
What exactly are you planning on doing?

927
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,361
You got three cars that's full of them!

928
00:54:56,435 --> 00:54:58,926
Yeah, I'm going to call
the UN or NATO or someone.

929
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,029
- No fucking calls.
- What the hell?

930
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:03,006
- You madman! That was my phone!
- No calls!

931
00:55:03,075 --> 00:55:05,066
No NATO! No UN! Nothing!

932
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:06,873
I don't trust anybody!

933
00:55:06,945 --> 00:55:09,004
- Holy shit.
- Fuck.

934
00:55:16,088 --> 00:55:20,422
Simon, I swear to God, if you do
something stupid, I'll kill you myself.

935
00:55:24,463 --> 00:55:26,432
- Hi.
- Hi. Get out of the car.

936
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:28,591
No, we're just tourists
on our way to Montenegro.

937
00:55:28,668 --> 00:55:30,498
Yeah, get out of the fucking car now!

938
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,162
Oh, my God.
We're going to fucking die.

939
00:55:32,238 --> 00:55:33,796
- Stay calm.
- Out!

940
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,706
You're making a mistake here
because we're just passing...

941
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:38,107
On the ground!

942
00:55:39,112 --> 00:55:41,012
- Get the fuck on the ground!
- Just don't panic.

943
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:43,072
- Shut the fuck up.
- What are you waiting for? Come on.

944
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:45,777
- No, nothing. Okay. Okay.
- Come on. Come on.

945
00:55:45,851 --> 00:55:48,514
Out. Out. You, too. Out.
Come on. Come on.

946
00:55:48,588 --> 00:55:50,920
- This was all a misunderstanding.
- Shut the fuck up!

947
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,720
On the ground now! Get down.

948
00:55:53,793 --> 00:55:56,284
- On the ground now.
- Okay, okay, okay.

949
00:55:57,864 --> 00:55:59,695
You don't have to worry about us.
We're just journalists!

950
00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:01,063
- You do not have...
- Shut up!

951
00:56:08,242 --> 00:56:09,299
Simon?

952
00:56:15,448 --> 00:56:16,973
Goran? Fucking hell!

953
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,644
Shit. Fucking Simon Hunt!

954
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:21,244
You know this motherfucker?

955
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:23,813
Sascha! [speaking Serbian]
Simon Hunt!

956
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:30,127
Goran, you crazy, thick-necked
Croatian son of a bitch!

957
00:56:30,197 --> 00:56:33,290
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

958
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,130
- We almost kill you, man.
- Yeah, no shit.

959
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:37,170
Listen, never drive on our road.

960
00:56:37,238 --> 00:56:39,763
But if you do, call first us, okay?

961
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,467
Okay. All right. I promise. I promise.

962
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:46,577
Laugh at all their jokes.

963
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:48,478
Whatever you do, don't stare at the midget.

964
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:49,642
What midget?

965
00:56:49,717 --> 00:56:51,480
They're black marketeers.

966
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:54,851
- They run stuff that comes in through Croatia.
- Okay.

967
00:56:54,922 --> 00:56:57,186
- Simon!
- Sascha!

968
00:56:57,259 --> 00:57:00,694
- Oh, shit, I'm staring at the midget.
- Well, stop.

969
00:57:06,902 --> 00:57:09,199
Where the fuck my money?

970
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,933
Beautiful guitar, it's yours.
Go ahead.

971
00:57:12,006 --> 00:57:14,134
[Sascha speaking Serbian]

972
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,369
Un-fucking-believable.

973
00:57:16,444 --> 00:57:18,208
Yeah, it's, like, twice his size.

974
00:57:21,082 --> 00:57:23,346
Fucking greedy midget.

975
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,846
What?

976
00:57:28,957 --> 00:57:30,356
I'll pay you back.

977
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:32,393
I'll pay you both back.

978
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:42,599
<i>## [rap]</i>

979
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,706
<i>- Duck?
- Hey, baby.</i>

980
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:48,208
Wait, I can hardly hear you.

981
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:51,178
Costas, can you turn down
the stereo, please?

982
00:57:51,246 --> 00:57:53,373
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm fine.</i>

983
00:57:53,448 --> 00:57:56,042
No. Baby, I said where are you?

984
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:59,918
<i>Oh, oh, yeah. I'm on Gaspar's boat.</i>

985
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:01,080
Who is Gaspar?

986
00:58:01,157 --> 00:58:03,989
Costas and Lola's friend.
No, no more champagne.

987
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,995
No, talk to me!
Who is Costas and Lola?

988
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:09,793
Look baby, I can hardly hear you.

989
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:11,094
The connection's horrible.

990
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:12,327
When are you coming?

991
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,425
<i>I'm going to be there tomorrow morning.</i>

992
00:58:14,504 --> 00:58:15,562
First flight out.

993
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:17,538
<i>Okay. But you better hurryl</i>

994
00:58:17,607 --> 00:58:19,438
Georgio, no! I'm ticklish!

995
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:22,307
Wait a minute! Who is Georgio?

996
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:26,007
<i>- You can't slap my butt like that.
- What? Nol Put Georgio on the phonel</i>

997
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:27,913
<i>I want to talk to Georgiol</i>

998
00:58:27,984 --> 00:58:30,214
Hello?

999
00:58:46,836 --> 00:58:48,827
Oh, my God.

1000
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:58,109
So you ran into the midget.

1001
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,342
It's better than running over the midget.

1002
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,747
And how'd you know?

1003
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:03,718
Look. We cannot talk here.

1004
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:06,778
I didn't know we were talking.

1005
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:08,188
We're not talking.

1006
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:09,850
Well, it looks like we're talking.

1007
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:13,828
Visegrad. Dobran Tunnel,
tonight at 9.

1008
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:15,159
Things are heating up.

1009
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:43,883
Why do you keep breaking into my room?

1010
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:46,122
[Simon]
Look, I'm between places right now.

1011
00:59:46,197 --> 00:59:47,356
I needed a bath.

1012
01:00:01,245 --> 01:00:03,873
So what the hell are you going to do, Simon?

1013
01:00:05,216 --> 01:00:07,047
You're broke.

1014
01:00:07,118 --> 01:00:08,312
You owe midgets.

1015
01:00:12,824 --> 01:00:14,724
I dream about him, Duck.

1016
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:16,487
I dream about catching him.

1017
01:00:20,565 --> 01:00:23,193
Wiping that arrogant smile off his face.

1018
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:26,326
My whole fucking situation,

1019
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:29,464
every bad thing that's ever happened
to me, stems from that bastard.

1020
01:00:32,777 --> 01:00:34,608
I was flying high before that war.

1021
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:38,148
I know.

1022
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:43,044
We were a fucking great team.

1023
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:45,248
The best.

1024
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:58,332
And then it all went to shit.

1025
01:01:00,606 --> 01:01:04,406
Finding him would've been
so fucking brilliant.

1026
01:01:07,112 --> 01:01:10,741
Maybe you should call your source again.

1027
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,949
What?

1028
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:20,119
What?

1029
01:01:20,192 --> 01:01:21,716
There is no source.

1030
01:01:21,794 --> 01:01:24,558
I made up the whole story.

1031
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,895
You are un-fucking-believable.

1032
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:29,366
I heard rumors that
the Fox was up in Celebici.

1033
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:33,303
I thought if I had a source,
it'd push you over to joining me, so...

1034
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:36,102
You know, I must be a fucking idiot.

1035
01:01:36,176 --> 01:01:37,837
No, I'm an asshole.

1036
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:41,005
No, all this time, you've been
making fun of my life in New York.

1037
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:44,278
Joking about how
I'm not the man that I used to be?

1038
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:48,150
Let me share something with you, Simon.
You're not the man you used to be, either.

1039
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,586
You are far fucking from it.

1040
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:55,892
Dry your dick off
and get the fuck outta my room.

1041
01:01:57,864 --> 01:01:59,161
Lady, do you...

1042
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:00,893
Look, I'm just trying to change my...

1043
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,901
[speaking Serbian]

1044
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,536
Hello? Hello?

1045
01:02:09,844 --> 01:02:11,811
Yes, I made it up.

1046
01:02:11,878 --> 01:02:14,472
- Shit, Simon.
- We weren't wrong, you know?

1047
01:02:14,548 --> 01:02:16,742
Boris, the UN guy, he thought
we were right on his trail.

1048
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,013
- Yeah, well, he still does.
- What do you mean?

1049
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:21,611
I just saw him in the lobby,

1050
01:02:21,688 --> 01:02:24,852
and he wants to meet
his favorite CIA hit squad

1051
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:27,051
at that burnt-out tunnel in Visegrad tonight.

1052
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:29,721
- He said, "Things are heating up."
- He did?

1053
01:02:29,797 --> 01:02:31,992
Yes. The whole damn thing
is fucking ridiculous.

1054
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:35,228
Why the hell didn't you tell me?
We got to get going!

1055
01:02:48,716 --> 01:02:51,150
So at what point do we get
jumped and killed?

1056
01:03:12,174 --> 01:03:13,971
I'm not doing what I'm doing.

1057
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,236
I mean, clearly I'm doing this,
but I'm not doing this,

1058
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:19,609
because if I was doing this, I could
get into a lot of trouble for doing it.

1059
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:22,644
What the fuck, Boris?

1060
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:24,378
Yeah.

1061
01:03:31,526 --> 01:03:33,687
She might seem
young and beautiful to you,

1062
01:03:33,762 --> 01:03:36,663
but she would cut your balls off
and sell them as trinkets

1063
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:39,700
if she thinks you're fucking
with her. Okay?

1064
01:03:40,702 --> 01:03:42,101
Boris?

1065
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,867
Who are you talking about?

1066
01:03:46,941 --> 01:03:49,843
The person I spoke to about your mission.

1067
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:51,003
Mirjana.

1068
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:54,378
She is going to lead you to the Fox.

1069
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,041
Come.

1070
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:29,147
Sit down.

1071
01:04:39,762 --> 01:04:41,059
Sit.

1072
01:04:56,045 --> 01:04:58,913
I'm no friend of the Muslims.

1073
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:02,042
Right at the start of the war,
they got some girls from my school.

1074
01:05:02,118 --> 01:05:04,610
Look, it was shitty on all sides, okay?

1075
01:05:06,022 --> 01:05:09,857
You don't know shitty until you've been
gang-raped for seven hours.

1076
01:05:15,765 --> 01:05:19,827
- Where's Boris?
- This is not about justice.

1077
01:05:19,902 --> 01:05:22,370
I am and always will be a proud Serb.

1078
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:23,804
This is about money.

1079
01:05:23,874 --> 01:05:27,969
My father had a system.
Made us money.

1080
01:05:28,045 --> 01:05:30,411
Then Boghanovic's men took over.

1081
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,471
Wanted what we had.

1082
01:05:33,617 --> 01:05:37,212
Now they run the petrol and cigarettes
coming in from Serbia.

1083
01:05:37,287 --> 01:05:40,654
Use that money to protect him.

1084
01:05:40,724 --> 01:05:44,717
But they killed my father.

1085
01:05:44,795 --> 01:05:46,490
And now we have nothing.

1086
01:05:48,632 --> 01:05:50,725
I hate nothing.

1087
01:05:50,802 --> 01:05:53,634
You stop them,
I get my family business back.

1088
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:55,365
What do we get?

1089
01:05:55,439 --> 01:05:58,534
What you came to Bosnia to get.

1090
01:06:02,946 --> 01:06:05,005
And how do we do that?

1091
01:06:05,082 --> 01:06:09,315
My old boyfriend, he is one of his guards.

1092
01:06:09,387 --> 01:06:11,446
Midac.

1093
01:06:11,522 --> 01:06:15,014
He is in love with me, calls me every day.

1094
01:06:15,093 --> 01:06:18,221
I have no interest in him anymore,
but I still talk to him

1095
01:06:18,296 --> 01:06:21,197
because I know one day
the CIA will come to my home.

1096
01:06:24,936 --> 01:06:27,200
- How many guards?
- Ten.

1097
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,604
- We're just three.
- Three of you is thirty of them.

1098
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:35,578
They are fat and lazy and bored
out of their minds in the countryside.

1099
01:06:35,646 --> 01:06:37,581
And you know exactly where he is?

1100
01:06:37,648 --> 01:06:40,709
I can.

1101
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:43,516
Now you give me thousand marks.

1102
01:06:43,588 --> 01:06:46,887
A thou... Are you out or your fucking mind?

1103
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,790
No. I want goodwill gesture.

1104
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,227
My goodwill has disappeared, lady.

1105
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:55,595
I risk everything talking to you.

1106
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,760
We just can't.

1107
01:06:58,771 --> 01:07:01,261
I need assurance
you don't take advantage of me.

1108
01:07:08,847 --> 01:07:11,576
If you guys are not serious, forget it.

1109
01:07:16,455 --> 01:07:18,480
The Agency has strict rules.

1110
01:07:19,892 --> 01:07:21,382
We're not authorized for payments.

1111
01:07:26,465 --> 01:07:29,662
Others in the company are, but not us.

1112
01:07:29,735 --> 01:07:31,999
Weaker divisions are.
Smaller divisions.

1113
01:07:33,138 --> 01:07:35,368
You know what we do.

1114
01:07:36,608 --> 01:07:38,473
You know who we are.

1115
01:07:38,545 --> 01:07:42,173
You know our reputations and our accuracy
in achieving our goals around the world.

1116
01:07:43,682 --> 01:07:45,673
A single bullet from us can end wars...

1117
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:48,049
or start them.

1118
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,678
Now, you're worried about others killing you,

1119
01:07:49,756 --> 01:07:52,849
but what you should most be worried about
are the three people in this room

1120
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:54,894
and the reputations
that they bring with them.

1121
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,428
We will do what we need to do
to achieve our goals.

1122
01:07:57,497 --> 01:08:00,226
Right now, you're standing in the way
of us achieving those goals.

1123
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:04,464
You can help us, and you'll no longer
be hindering our operation.

1124
01:08:04,537 --> 01:08:08,337
You can ignore us,
and I cannot guarantee your safety.

1125
01:08:10,642 --> 01:08:13,874
The Agency is, I'm afraid to say,
completely humorless about these issues.

1126
01:08:28,261 --> 01:08:29,559
Okay.

1127
01:08:32,632 --> 01:08:37,195
Tomorrow, when he call, I will find out
what we all need to know.

1128
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,568
Good.

1129
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,470
Un-fucking-believable, Benji!

1130
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:43,736
I didn't think you had it in you!

1131
01:08:43,811 --> 01:08:47,644
That's the ballsiest fucking thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1132
01:08:47,715 --> 01:08:49,307
You're a madman.

1133
01:08:49,383 --> 01:08:51,783
I think she's just full of shit
and trying to play us,

1134
01:08:51,852 --> 01:08:53,513
but it's better to find out for sure.

1135
01:08:53,586 --> 01:08:55,646
I don't know what we got
into here, gentlemen,

1136
01:08:55,722 --> 01:08:57,714
but I fucking love it.

1137
01:08:58,826 --> 01:09:02,728
You know, when you think about it,
the whole thing is fucking ridiculous.

1138
01:09:02,796 --> 01:09:04,058
Why?

1139
01:09:04,131 --> 01:09:06,065
I could very well be CIA.

1140
01:09:06,133 --> 01:09:07,725
You can't even spell CIA.

1141
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:11,464
Every fucking CIA guy I know
looks exactly like me.

1142
01:09:11,539 --> 01:09:13,268
Yeah, only better-looking.

1143
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,274
They certainly do not look like me.

1144
01:09:15,342 --> 01:09:17,105
And that is the genius of it.

1145
01:09:17,178 --> 01:09:20,011
The CIA would have someone
who doesn't look CIA.

1146
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,071
That's...

1147
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:25,676
That's exactly what they would do.

1148
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:30,216
- What?
- I think we're being followed.

1149
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,590
- What?
- What do you mean?

1150
01:09:32,661 --> 01:09:35,629
What part of "I think we're being followed"
do you not understand?

1151
01:09:40,535 --> 01:09:41,694
Jesus Christ.

1152
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,468
He's right with me every turn.

1153
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:47,632
Who could it be?

1154
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:55,281
- Jesus fucking hell!
- We can't stop.

1155
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,942
We got to get back to Sarajevo.

1156
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:58,212
Yeah, no shit.

1157
01:09:58,286 --> 01:09:59,548
We got one problem.

1158
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,316
That right turn I made back there?

1159
01:10:01,389 --> 01:10:03,084
We're not heading toward Sarajevo.

1160
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:05,649
- We're heading toward Pale.
- Oh, God damn it!

1161
01:10:05,727 --> 01:10:07,661
Why? What's Pale?

1162
01:10:07,729 --> 01:10:09,128
Just the worst place we possibly could go.

1163
01:10:09,197 --> 01:10:10,994
It's where the Fox lived during the war.

1164
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:13,501
- It's just Serb country.
- Fucking peachy.

1165
01:10:14,503 --> 01:10:16,994
- Fucking hell!
- Jesus!

1166
01:10:17,072 --> 01:10:18,403
- [Horn honks]
- What's your fucking problem!

1167
01:10:18,473 --> 01:10:21,306
- Shit!
- Okay, okay.

1168
01:10:21,376 --> 01:10:22,775
Fucking shit!

1169
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:25,673
Speed up! Speed up! Speed up!

1170
01:10:35,358 --> 01:10:37,588
Hold tight! Hold on!

1171
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:53,806
How come every time I'm with you, Simon,
I put my life in danger?

1172
01:10:56,078 --> 01:10:58,979
Because, my old friend,

1173
01:10:59,048 --> 01:11:03,576
putting your life in danger
is actual living.

1174
01:11:03,653 --> 01:11:05,814
The rest is television.

1175
01:11:05,888 --> 01:11:08,551
You need me to remind you of that.

1176
01:11:18,434 --> 01:11:19,799
We got to be extra careful.

1177
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:21,496
Don't talk to anyone in the hotel.

1178
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:24,061
- Don't talk on a cell phone.
- That won't be a problem.

1179
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:26,074
Trust me, guys, trust me.

1180
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:28,475
We have stepped into something here.

1181
01:11:28,544 --> 01:11:31,309
People are worried.
People are watching.

1182
01:11:32,448 --> 01:11:35,543
Who the fuck is this guy?
Who the fuck is that guy listening to us?

1183
01:11:35,619 --> 01:11:36,745
Nobody's listening to us!

1184
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,220
What, we got to be afraid
of the hotel help now?

1185
01:11:40,557 --> 01:11:42,422
Trust nobody.

1186
01:11:46,763 --> 01:11:48,822
The only person I don't trust is you.

1187
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,204
Are you sleeping in my room?

1188
01:12:01,278 --> 01:12:04,111
- Yes.
- Well, you kids have fun.

1189
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:05,580
Look, Simon.

1190
01:12:05,649 --> 01:12:09,676
I mean, I would be lying if I wasn't secretly
hoping all this stuff is true.

1191
01:12:09,754 --> 01:12:12,847
But we're no closer to finding
the Fox than anybody else.

1192
01:12:12,923 --> 01:12:14,892
I mean, Boris is a nut.

1193
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:16,824
Mirjana's a con artist.

1194
01:12:16,893 --> 01:12:19,260
And that guy following us on the road
is just some drunk

1195
01:12:19,329 --> 01:12:21,423
or your little midget friend
wanting to wrestle.

1196
01:12:24,102 --> 01:12:25,535
You were saying?

1197
01:12:28,539 --> 01:12:30,234
[Whispering]
We got to get outta here.

1198
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:40,375
- Fucking don't move.
- Okay, okay, okay!

1199
01:12:40,451 --> 01:12:42,851
You wanted to find Fox?

1200
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,945
Well, now Fox want to find you.

1201
01:13:09,047 --> 01:13:10,479
[Chains clanking]

1202
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:21,913
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're saying, okay?

1203
01:14:21,988 --> 01:14:23,512
I'm sorry, I don't understand!
I don't speak your language!

1204
01:14:25,658 --> 01:14:28,650
I don't know what you're saying!
I don't know what you're saying!

1205
01:14:28,728 --> 01:14:29,752
[Speaking Serbian]

1206
01:14:29,829 --> 01:14:31,854
Duck! Duck!
I don't know what he's saying!

1207
01:14:31,931 --> 01:14:33,558
I don't know what he's saying!

1208
01:14:33,633 --> 01:14:36,067
[Speaking Serbian]

1209
01:14:36,135 --> 01:14:37,602
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1210
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,262
We are not CIA.

1211
01:14:44,744 --> 01:14:46,406
I'm sorry. I don't understand
what you're saying.

1212
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:48,037
We are not CIA!
We are journalists!

1213
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:50,173

The Americans, yeah,
they brokered the peace agreement,

1319
01:23:01,316 --> 01:23:04,480
but some would suggest they
made a secret deal with the Fox,

1320
01:23:04,552 --> 01:23:08,249
that if he stepped down from power
they would not arrest him for war crimes.

trying to catch the Fox.

1384
01:29:33,883 --> 01:29:39,253
I'll have myself surgically attached to you.

1385
01:29:55,004 --> 01:29:56,835
This was Marda's town.

1386
01:29:56,907 --> 01:29:59,431
It's one of the few places
Muslims came back to.

1387
01:30:02,978 --> 01:30:06,573
They'll know best what to do with him.

1388
01:31:27,164 --> 01:31:28,324
Let me borrow 50 bucks.

1389
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:31,301
What? We just left $5 million
tied to the side of the road.

1390
01:31:31,369 --> 01:31:32,893
You want to borrow 50 bucks?

1391
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:34,904
Actually, make it a hundred.

1392
01:31:34,972 --> 01:31:36,405
You know, when all this hits,

1393
01:31:36,474 --> 01:31:39,569
it's going to be a shit-storm of
international denial and cover-ups.

1394
01:31:39,644 --> 01:31:42,409
Maybe you could talk to your father,
get me that gig to report it.

1395
01:31:42,481 --> 01:31:44,176
Then I can pay you back.

1396
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:45,511
All right.

1397
01:31:47,653 --> 01:31:51,487
[Chanting]

1398
01:31:51,557 --> 01:31:53,421
So what are you going to do?

1399
01:31:53,492 --> 01:31:55,289
You going to stay and cover it?

1400
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,224
Are you?

1401
01:31:57,296 --> 01:32:00,493
I got the cushy gig in New York.

1402
01:32:00,566 --> 01:32:02,659
The girl in Greece.

1403
01:32:02,734 --> 01:32:04,064
The story...

1404
01:32:04,136 --> 01:32:07,970
The story's going to be right here.

1405
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:12,801
Just play something decent on this, will you?

1406
01:32:12,878 --> 01:32:14,470
For once?

1407
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:19,042
Simon, you're the only man I know
who would borrow money

1408
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:22,609
to repay a debt that you took to repay a debt.

1409
01:32:22,688 --> 01:32:26,125
And that's why you love me.

1410
01:32:28,193 --> 01:32:30,525
That's why I love you.

1411
01:32:39,705 --> 01:32:41,230
