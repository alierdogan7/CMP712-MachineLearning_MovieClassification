356
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,314
He's got a job packing shelves
in Quinnsworth on Saturdays.

357
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,955
You're not giving that up
for any band, d'you hear me?

358
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,481
Yeah.

359
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,479
What about Mondays
and Wednesdays after school?

360
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,870
That's fine.

361
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,879
Sounds good.

362
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,435
Now all we need is other musicians.

363
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,716
Do yous know any?

364
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,559
- No.
- Eamon?

365
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,195
He usually just plays on his own.

366
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,277
Don't you, love?

367
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,036
Right, well,
we can't get any peace in here.

368
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,517
Let's continue this meeting outside.

369
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,195
No smoking now.

370
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,312
Ma, how many times do I have to tell you?

371
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,716
I don't smoke.

372
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,076
There's a black guy in 3B.

373
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,601
So?

374
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,633
- Be cool if he was in the band.
- Why?

375
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,479
He's probably the one black guy
in the whole school.

376
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,240
Probably in Dublin.

377
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,273
Having a golliwog in the band
give us a real edge.

378
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,471
You can't say "golliwog."

379
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,796
Why not?

380
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,321
Trust me, you just can't.

381
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,080
And anyway,
what if he can't play anything?

382
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,318
He'll be able
to play something; he's black.

- Can I help you?

385
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,278
Is this the house
where the colored lad lives?

386
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,471
Four doors down.

387
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,001
What do you think?

388
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,880
How many black people do you think
that lives on this shitty estate?

389
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,078
- Do you know Ngig?
- What's that?

390
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,477
Ngig. My son.

391
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,957
We're putting a band together.
Does he play any instruments?

392
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,913
Why don't you ask him yourself?

393
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,351
(SLOWLY): We are putting

394
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,236
a band together.

395
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,001
I am the manager.

396
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,874
What the hell is wrong with him?

397
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,552
Oh, you, um,
sound different from your mam.

398
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,115
Course I do; been here
half me bleedin' life.

399
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,391
What'd you think?

400
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,558
Would you have any interest
in playing in a band?

401
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,160
What kind of music are yous playing?

402
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,994
We're not a hundred percent sure yet,
but do you play any instruments?

403
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,031
Maybe.

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,474

Let's go.

413
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,398
So what are we called, then?

414
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,154
All right, what about...

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,601

416
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,553
What's the story with you and rabbits?

417
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,479
I don't know, I just love them.

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,076
What's that mean?

420
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,840
It's French for "The Life."

421
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,471
What's French for, uh, "That's not
gonna be the name of the band"?

422
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,718
C'est nes pas le nom du groupe.

425
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,711
Do you actually not get that like?

426
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,195

- No.

Yeah, the girl, yeah.

else's art to get her? Are you kidding?

Did the Sex Pistols know how to play?

463
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,354
You don't need to know
how to play. Who are you?

464
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,440
Steely Dan? You need to learn
how not to play, Conor.

465
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,718
That's the trick. That's rock and roll.

made it in the music industry or not

to write a song for someone else.

475
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,518
Rock and roll is a risk.

476
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,156
You risk being ridiculed.

477
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,601

- Yeah.

531
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,961
Do you, do you have a hoover?

532
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,316
Check out this effect.

533
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,114
It's like "Video Killed the Radio Star."

534
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,880
Go.

535
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,961
# Standing in the corner #

536
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,516
# Like an angel in disguise... #

537
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,439
CONOR: Hey.

538
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,437
How's it going?

539
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,836
Uh, here's the tape.

540
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,634
What's this?

541
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,957
Oh, that's the song;
I mentioned it to you.

542
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,721
Oh, you're the kid in the band.

543
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,159
Yeah, you should probably
learn the lyrics.

544
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,113
So you can lip-sync to them properly.

545
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,153
We're shooting at the lane
at the back of Quinnsworth.

546
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,914
- You know Quinnsworth?
- Yeah.

547
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,077
This Saturday at 12:00.

548
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,471
Cool. Well, I'll try and make it.

549
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,637
What would I wear?

550
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,956
I don't know.

551
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,475
It's kind of like a Chinese theme.

552
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,274
So, like, a kimono?

553
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,597
Well, it's more like a riff than a song.

554
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,599
(HUMMING)

555
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,873
More of an Eastern bit in the song.

556
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,470
It's called "The Riddle of the Model."

557
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,396
That's really sweet.

558
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,557
(CHUCKLES): Oh.

559
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,394
No, it's not about you.

560
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,000
It's about another model I know.

561
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,555
Oh.

562
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:28,878
Right, well, I'll give it a listen, but I'm,
like, really, really busy at the moment.

563
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,560
You know, so I'll try.

564
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,435
Yeah, you should.
It's a, it's a good song.

565
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,121
We've got a great team.

566
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,193
It's a really good opportunity.

567
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,550
Cool.

568
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,160
So this Saturday at 12:00, then?

569
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,511
12:00. Sounds good.

570
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,791
- Thanks.
- Cool.

571
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,719
Bye.

572
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,594
(CHUCKLES)

573
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,275
Looks like loads of gear
back home, doesn't it?

574
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,439
And yet, strangely,
it just looks like shit here.

575
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,598
- (SPUTTERS)
- Yeah.

576
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,712
Ah, hey, where is this chick?

577
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,600
I don't know.

578
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,190
Who the hell brought a cowboy costume?

579
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,756
Me. It's all I could find.

580
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,998
No one wears a cowboy costume in a band.

581
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,396
There's a cowboy in the Village People.

582
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,477
And Adam Ant.

583
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,319
Adam Ant is a highwayman.

584
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,559
So we can have a highwayman,
but we can't have a cowboy?

585
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,672
Are you mentally ill?

586
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,952
I got fangs in the joke shop.

587
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,760
- What are you gonna do with them?
- (GROWLING)

588
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,958
- It's a music video, not a bleedin' horror film.
- Spanner.

589
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,311
So what did yous bring?

590
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,757
(LAUGHTER)

591
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,315
It's me da's show band outfit.

592
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,591
So it's a gay band?

593
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,711
Okay.

594
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,321
Coming from the one who wants
to look like the Village People.

595
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,835
What's gay about the Village People?

596
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,361
Hello, all. Sorry I'm late.

597
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,035
I was out last night.

598
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,312
At a nightclub.

599
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,671
Jesus Christ, what are you all wearing?

600
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,792
Yeah, we're just working that out.

601
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,400
Um, maybe you can help.

602
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,035
Well, who's your costume person?

603
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,273
We don't really have a costume person.

604
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,312
Well, who's your cameraman?

605
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,671
Maybe he can make some of this work.

606
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,440
Well, we don't really have...

607
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,631
I'm the cameraman.

608
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,956
Thought you were the producer.

609
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,310
And the cameraman.

610
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,080
Saving money at all costs, yeah.

611
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,555
What'd you think of the song?

612
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,796
I really liked it.

613
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,560
It's the only reason I'm here.

614
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,831
Did you write it?

615
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,395
Eamon wrote most of the music.

616
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,875
So you wrote the lyrics?

617
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,116
Cool.

618
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,275
You've got really good cheekbones.

619
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,721
- What?
- Yeah.

620
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,561
Yeah, you should let me do your makeup.

621
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,798
- Really?
- Yeah. Now this light's gonna be

622
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,991
really harsh on camera.

623
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,561
It'll take the edge off.

624
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,240
I'm actually wearing some right now.

625
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,235
In fact, you should all be wearing makeup.

626
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,715
DARREN: Yeah, I'm not wearing any makeup.

627
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,634
RAPHINA:
Relax, you're not even in the band.

628
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,240
Yeah, thank God.

629
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,560
I'm in the band, and I will not
be wearing any makeup. Thank you.

630
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,075
Why? You've got great lips.

631
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,521
No, piss off. I'm not wearing makeup.

632
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,274
Whatever.

633
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,199
Those of you who actually
care about the band

634
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,995
and want to do this half
properly, queue over there.

635
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,875
Okay, so we're playing over here,

636
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,594
and Raphina's standing
over there against the wall.

637
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,280
I go up to you and start singing to you.

638
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,760
Make sure to pan up to her eyes when I
sing the line, "She's got dangerous eyes."

639
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,395
I think a zoom would be better.

640
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,080
Okay, a zoom, whatever.

641
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,275
Do you think I should have, lightning
flashes on my eyelids when I close 'em?

642
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,391
Can you do that?

643
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,636
I can do anything.

644
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,195
Cool.

645
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,711
So then for the chorus,
you walk off and I follow,

646
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,511
circling you like when he's
following her in the "Thriller" video.

647
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,519
- Have you seen the "Thriller" video?
- Yeah.

648
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,473
Cool. So then I follow you up the laneway,

649
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,281
keeping behind you, and then we'll swing
around and get the angle in front.

650
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,199
- Let's shoot it.
- DARREN: Right, let's shoot.

651
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,119
It's just some kids filming something.

652
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,800
What are yous filming, lads?

653
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,641
A video for a band.

654
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,876
Hi, Barry.

655
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,480
Are these in your school, Barry?

656
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,718
Yeah, they are, yeah.

657
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,400
But they're wearing bleedin' makeup.

658
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,716
BARRY: I know.

659
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,070
Oh, yous making a movie, lads, is it?

660
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,555
Nah, it's just a video for a band.

661
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,035
You should get in a band, Barry.

662
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,033
Put on lipstick, dance around and all.

663
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,158
- You'd be bleedin' great.
- Piss off.

664
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,398
- What did you say?
- Nothin'.

665
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,041
See yous, lads.

666
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,561
See yous at the Oscars.

667
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,231
DARREN:
Right, lads, lots of energy in this.

668
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,478
And, Ngig, I want to see you
really pressing those keys.

669
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,997
Here's some playback.

00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,956
An older guy.

887
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,834
Ah.

888
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,635
All the complicated boys and girls.

889
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,161
(KNOCKING)

890
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,238
Good work.

891
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,513
Brother Baxter would like
to see, uh, Conor Lawlor.

892
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,075
Okay. Conor.

893
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,635
(LAUGHTER)

894
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,161
BOY: Conor Lawlor.

895
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,237
What's going on?

896
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,590
With what?

897
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,836
This.

898
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,634
Oh, well.

899
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,394
I checked the rule book...

900
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,035
the-the one you mentioned
about brown shoes...

901
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,236
and I couldn't find anything about
makeup or altering hair color.

902
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,318
Oh, and look.

903
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,071
I painted these
with paint from the art room.

904
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,790
Head down to the toilet
and remove the makeup right now.

905
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,072
- Why?
- Because I told you to.

906
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,476
But I'm in a band.

907
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,954
It's a school band, and I think
it's important that we have a look.

908
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,834
You're a man. Men don't wear makeup.

909
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,361
But why not?

910
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,598
People in the 18th century wore makeup.

911
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,677
That means people like Mozart
wore makeup, and he was a man.

912
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,191
So you're Mozart now, are you?

913
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,432
That makes me Salieri, is it?

914
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,915
Who's Salieri?

915
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,351
You've a fine face.

916
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,633
Pretty enough without makeup.

917
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,593
Take it off.

918
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,031
You can use my bathroom, if you like.

919
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,394
Come on in here.

920
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,557

921
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,593
I'm gonna go to class now.

922

924
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,516
You can't do this!

925
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,439
Do you want to bet?

926
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,757

928
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,120
I'll get you clean, don't worry.

929
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,595
Clean you all up.

930
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,991
Get all that shite off you.

931
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,671
Take pride in your God-given features.

932
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,521

933
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,120

937
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,991
- Hey, Cosmo.
- Who?

938
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,681
Cosmo. That's what I'm calling you now.

939
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,475
You're gonna need a catchy name
if you're gonna be in a band.

940
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,671
Right.

941
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,280
What happened?

942
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,676
Nothing.

943
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,076
Come on.

944
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,114
I really liked your song.

945
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,800
It made me cry.

946
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,797
Oh.

947
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,799
I'm really sorry.

948
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,476
No, that's a good thing.

949
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,398
So who's the guy with the car?

950
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,841
Evan?

951
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,395
Yeah.

952
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,161
Is he your boyfriend?

953
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,840
We're on and off.

954
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,793
It's complicated.

955
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,277
We're actually on
a little break at the moment.

956
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,040
Yeah.

957
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,834
Good idea.

958
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,759
Take a break for a year or so.

959
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,521
Get some perspective.

960
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,918
He's actually a really nice guy.

961
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,555
Yeah.

962
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,957
Shit taste in music, though.

963
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,799
We're going to London soon.

964
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,436
I'm too young to go on my own,
so he's organized everything.

965
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,032
What's in it for Evan?

966
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,515
Are you jealous, Cosmo?

967
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,916
Why would I be jealous?

968
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,361
Exactly.

969
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,271
Will you write me a happy song sometime?

970
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,676
I need a laugh.

971
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,155
But what if I don't feel happy?

972
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:13,071
Your problem is that you're
not happy being sad.

973
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,000
But that's what love is, Cosmo.

974
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,680
Happy-sad.

975
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,034
Shit, I've got to go soon.

976
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,751
We only have a half hour
dinner window in our house.

977
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,872
So, what's the house like, where you live?

978
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,441
It's nice.

979
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:36,440
Nicer than some of the dumps
I've lived in.

980
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,679
So where are your parents?

981
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:40,911
My dad's brown bread.

982
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,317
He got hit by a car.

983
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,512
Oh, my God. Sorry.

984
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,638
Really don't be.

985
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,559
He was a drunk. He deserved it.

986
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,560
And me ma's in and out of hospital.

987
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,081
Why?

988
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,476
She's a nurse.

989
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,115
Oh, right.

990
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,551
No, she's manic-depressive.

991
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,118
So, like, happy-sad.

992
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,676
You're funny, I like that.

993
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:14,401
Well, let me know if you need me
for any more videos before I go.

994
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,596
When are you going?

995
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,354
Soon.

996
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,559
CONOR (VOICE-OVER):
What did she mean by that?

997
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,159
Well, I think what she means is that
you need to reach a place in your life

998
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,795
where you're okay with your sadness.

999
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,196
It's pretty high concept stuff.

1000
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,590
How old d'you say she was again?

1001
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,632
Sixteen.

1002
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,081
It's monastic.

1003
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,231
She's like a monk.

1004
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,432
She sounds really pretentious.

1005
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,996
Why, 'cause she wants to leave
school and follow her vocation?

1006
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,721
You call wanting to be a model a vocation?

1007
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,514
Anything can be a vocation, Ann.

1008
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,759
Being a taxi driver,
being a bin man, being a poet,

1009
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,992
being a singer, being an artist.

1010
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,397
Brendan, I never wanted to be an artist.

1011
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,437
We couldn't get the brush out of your hand
when you were a kid.

1012
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,791
What is wrong with being an architect?

1013
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,150
It's not a vocation.

1014
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,591
I thought everything was a vocation.

1015
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,439
Don't be playing word games with me, Ann.

1016
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,991
I don't do "words," all right?

1017
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,317
Come on, Conor.

1018
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,519
Turn out the lights
before you go to bed, Ann.

1019
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,360
So her dad's dead
and her mam is a lunatic.

1020
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,835
And you thought you had problems.

1021
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:32,432
I see now what the older
boyfriend thing is about.

1022
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,439
Daddy issues.

1023
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,075
I used to know chicks like this.

1024
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,352
They're tricky, and they need
a lot of protecting.

1025
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,710
Are you up to that, Conor?

1026
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,117
I don't know.

1027
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,153
So what's it all about?

1028
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,513
I think she's just an amazing human being.

1029
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,759
I've never seen anyone like her.

1030
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,237
The way she talks and looks.

1031
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,391
(VOICE-OVER): She wears these sunglasses,
and when she takes them off, her eyes

So how do you mean you're "happy-sad"?

Yeah, how am I supposed to market that?

1041
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,640
It means we're not pop anymore.

1042
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,081
We were pop?

1043
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,351
Listen, I'm happy being anything.

1044
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,915
I just want to play music.

Well, I don't know who I am.

1048
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,270
Maybe I'm happy-sad, too.

1049
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,795
I don't know.

1050
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,321
What does happy-sad even mean?

1051
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,319
How can we be both things?
It makes no sense.

1052
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,080
It means that I'm stuck in this shithole

and I'm gonna deal with it, okay?

It's just how life is.

1055
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,552
I'm gonna try and accept it
and get on with it

to go out with my friends,

then he'd make me stay in.

1152
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:07,555
And afterwards, he'd say,

1153
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,838
"I love you too much, is all."

1154
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:14,038

much better-looking than I am,

why he'd bother with me.
