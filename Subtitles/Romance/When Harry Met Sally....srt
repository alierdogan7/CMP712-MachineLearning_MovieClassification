1
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,200
I was sitting with my friend
Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.

2
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,500
It was a Horn & Hardart cafeteria.

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,100
And this beautiful girl walked in,
and I turned to Arthur

4
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,300
and I said "Arthur, you see that girl?
I'm going to marry her."

5
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,300
And two weeks later we were married.

6
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
And it's over 50 years later,

7
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
and we're still married.

8
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
~ It's very clear

9
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,800
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - 1977

10
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,100
~ Our love is here to stay

11
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,600
- I love you.
- I love you.

12
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,400
~ Not for a year

13
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,500
~ But ever and a day

14
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,400
~ Oh, the radio and the telephone

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,200
~ And the movies that we know

16
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,200
~ May just be passing fancies...

17
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,200
Hi, Sally. Sally, this is Harry Burns.

18
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,600
- Harry, this is Sally Albright.
- Nice to meet you.

19
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,200
- Wanna drive the first shift?
- You're there already. You start.

20
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Back's open.

21
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,200
- Call me.
- I'll call you as soon as I get there.

22
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,300
- Call me from the road.
- I'll call you before that.

23
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,600
- I love you.
- I love you.

24
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,000
Sorry.

25
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,900
- I miss you already. I miss you already.
- I miss you.

26
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,300
- Bye.
- Bye.

27
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,000
~ In time, the Rockies may crumble

28
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,000
~ Gibraltar may tumble

29
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
~ They only made of clay

30
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
~ But

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,800
~ Our love is here to stay

32
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,000
I have it all figured out. It's an 18-hour trip,
which becomes six shifts of three hours.

33
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,900
Or, alternatively,
we could break it down by mileage.

34
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,700
There's a... There's a map on the visor

35
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,800
that I've marked to show the locations
where we can change shifts.

36
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,900
Grape?

37
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,500
No. I don't like to eat between meals.

38
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,400
I'll roll down the window.

39
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,000
Why don't you tell me
the story of your life?

40
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,100
- The story of my life?
- We got 18 hours to kill before New York.

41
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,100
That won't even get us out of Chicago.
Nothing's happened to me yet.

42
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,900
- So I'm going to New York.
- So something'll happen?

43
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,500
- Yes.
- Like what?

44
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,100
Like I'm going to journalism school.

45
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,000
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

46
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,100
- That's one way to look at it.
- Suppose nothing happens.

47
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Suppose you never meet anybody,
you never become anything,

48
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,600
then you die and nobody notices for two
weeks until the smell drifts into the hall.

49
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
- Amanda said you had a dark side.
- That's what drew her to me.

50
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,900
- Your dark side?
- Sure. Why, don't you have a dark side?

51
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,700
I know, you probably
dot your "i"s with little hearts.

52
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,600
I have just as much of a
dark side as the next person.

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,200
Oh, really? When I buy a new book,
I always read the last page first.

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,200
That way, if I die before I finish
I know how it ends.

55
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,800
That, my friend, is a dark side.

56
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,400
That doesn't mean you're deep.
I mean, yes, basically I'm a happy person.

57
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,100
- So am I.
- I don't see anything wrong with that.

58
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,500
No, you're too busy being happy.
Ever think about death?

59
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,900
- Yes.
- Sure you do. A fleeting thought

60
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,300
that drifts in and out of the transom
of your mind. I spend days.

61
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,600
And this makes you a better person?

62
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,400
Look, when the shit comes down,
I'm gonna be prepared and you're not.

63
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,800
In the meantime, you're gonna
ruin your whole life waiting for it.

64
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,200
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong. He wants her to leave.

65
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,500
- That's why he puts her on the plane.
- She doesn't want to stay!

66
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,700
Of course she wants to stay! Wouldn't you
rather be with Bogart than the other guy?

67
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't wanna spend my life in Casablanca
married to a man who runs a bar.

68
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,800
That probably sounds snobbish
to you, but I don't.

69
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,200
- You'd rather be in a loveless marriage...
- And First Lady of Czechoslovakia.

70
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,500
..than with the man you had
the greatest sex of your life with,

71
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,300
just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

72
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

73
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,400
And so would any woman in
her right mind. Women are practical,

74
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,400
even Ingrid Bergman, which is why she
gets on the plane at the end of the movie.

75
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
I understand.

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,200
- What? What?
- Nothing.

77
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,700
- What?
- Forget about it.

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,300
- Forget about what?
- It's not important.

79
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,500
No, just tell me.

80
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,900
Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.

81
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,400
- Two, please.
- Right over there.

82
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

83
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,300
It just so happens that
I have had plenty of good sex.

84
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,100
With whom?

85
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,800
- What?
- With whom did you have this great sex?

86
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,100
I'm not gonna tell you that!

87
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,100
Fine. Don't tell me.

88
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,300
- Shel Gordon.
- Shel. Sheldon?

89
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,800
No. No, you did not have
great sex with Sheldon.

90
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,700
- I did, too.
- No, you didn't.

91
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,100
A Sheldon can do your taxes. If you
need a root canal, Sheldon's your man.

92
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,500
But humpin' is not Sheldon's strong suit.
It's the name.

93
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,100
"Do it to me, Sheldon." "You're an animal,
Sheldon." "Ride me, big Sheldon."

94
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,400
- It doesn't work.
- Hi.

95
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,100
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a number three.

96
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,200
The chef's salad with the oil and vinegar
on the side. And the apple pie á la mode.

97
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,800
Chef and apple á la mode.

98
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,500
But I'd like the pie heated
and I want the ice cream on the side.

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,300
I'd like strawberry, if you have it. If not,
then whipped cream, but only if it's real.

100
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
If it's out of a can, nothing.

101
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,200
- Not even the pie?
- No, just the pie, but then not heated.

102
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,600
- What?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

103
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,200
- How come you broke up with Sheldon?
- How do you know we broke up?

104
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,400
If you didn't, you wouldn't be with me.
You'd be with Shel the Wonder Schlong.

105
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,200
First of all, I am not with you.

106
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,800
And second of all, it is none
of your business why we broke up.

107
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,500
You're right, you're right.
I don't wanna know.

108
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,700
Well, it was because he was jealous and
I had these days-of-the-week underpants.

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,200
Sorry, I need a judge's ruling on this.

110
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,900
- Days-of-the-week underpants?
- Yes.

111
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
They had days of the week on them
and I thought they were funny.

112
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Then one day Sheldon says to me
"You never wear Sunday."

113
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,200
He's all suspicious.
Where had I left Sunday?

114
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
And I told him and he didn't believe me.

115
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,800
- What?
- They don't make Sunday.

116
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,300
- Why not?
- Because of God.

117
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,800
OK, so 15 % of my share is 90.

118
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,900
$6.90.

119
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's leave seven.

120
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,900
What?

121
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,400
Do I have something on my face?

122
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
You're a very attractive person.

123
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,200
Thank you.

124
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Amanda never said
how attractive you were.

125
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,200
Maybe she doesn't think I'm attractive.

126
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,900
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.
Empirically, you are attractive.

127
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,500
Amanda is my friend.

128
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,200
So?

129
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,000
- So you're going with her.
- So?

130
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
So you're coming on to me!

131
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,500
No, I wasn't.

132
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
What?

133
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,000
Can't a man say a woman is attractive
without it being a come-on?

134
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,700
All right, all right.

135
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,200
Let's just say, just for the sake
of argument, that it was a come-on.

136
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,400
What d'you want me to do about it?
I take it back, OK? I take it back.

137
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,100
You can't take it back.

138
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,900
- Why not?
- Because it's already out there.

139
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,400
What are we supposed to do?
Call the cops, it's already out there!

140
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,600
Just let it lie.

141
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,300
- OK?
- Great! "Let it lie." That's my policy.

142
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,700
That's what I always say: "Let it lie."

143
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,700
Wanna spend the night in a motel?

144
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,800
- See? I didn't let it lie.
- Harry.

145
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,000
I said I would, then I didn't.

146
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,800
- Harry!
- What?

147
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,300
We are just going to be friends, OK?

148
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,000
Great! Friends! It's the best thing.

149
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,200
You realise
that we could never be friends.

150
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,100
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,

151
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,200
and this is not a come-on
in any way, shape or form,

152
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,100
is that men and women can't be friends,
cos the sex part always gets in the way.

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's not true. I have a number of
men friends and there is no sex involved.

154
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
- You don't.
- I do.

155
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,800
- You don't.
- I do!

156
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,100
You only think you do.

157
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,400
I have sex with them
without my knowledge?

158
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,800
No, they all wanna have sex with you.

159
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,700
- They do not.
- Do, too.

160
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,800
- They do not.
- Do, too.

161
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,000
How do you know?

162
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

163
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,000
He always wants to have sex with her.

164
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,100
So you're saying a man can be friends
with a woman he finds unattractive.

165
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,400
No, you pretty much
wanna nail them, too.

166
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
What if they don't wanna have sex?

167
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,500
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

168
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,400
- I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

169
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,500
That's too bad.

170
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,500
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

171
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,300
~ You say ee-ther, I say either

172
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,200
~ You say nee-ther and I say neither

173
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
~ Ee-ther, either

174
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,100
~ And nee-ther, neither

175
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,400
~ Let's call the whole thing off

176
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,800
~ Yes, you like potato and I like pot-ahto

177
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,800
~ You like tomato, I like tom-ahto

178
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
~ Potato, pot-ahto

179
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,100
~ Tomato, tom-ahto

180
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,200
~ Let's call the whole thing off

181
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,000
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah. It was interesting.

182
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,300
- It was nice knowing you.
- Yeah.

183
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,100
- Well, have a nice life.
- You, too.

184
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,000
~ You like potato and I like pot-ahto

185
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,000
~ You like tomato, I like tom-ahto

186
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,100
~ Potato, pot-ahto

187
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
~ Tomato, tom-ahto

188
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,300
~ Let's call the whole thing off

189
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,800
- We fell in love in high school.
- Yeah, we were high-school sweethearts.

190
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,200
But then after our junior year
his parents moved away.

191
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,400
- But I never forgot her.
- He never forgot me.

192
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
No, her face was burned on my brain.

193
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,700
And it was 34 years later
that I was walking down Broadway

194
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
and I saw her come out of Toffenetti's.

195
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,100
We both looked at each other,

196
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,300
and it was just as though
not a single day had gone by.

197
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,500
She was just as beautiful
as she was at sixteen.

198
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He was just the same.

199
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
He looked exactly the same.

200
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,600
FIVE YEARS LATER

201
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,800
Joe! I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

202
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,000
- Harry Burns.
- Harry. How ya doin'?

203
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,100
- Good. How you doin'?
- Fine. I'm doin' fine.

204
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,700
I was just walking by
and I thought it was you.

205
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Yeah, it was.

206
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,400
- You still with the DA's office?
- No, I switched to the other side. You?

207
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,900
I work with a small firm. We do
political consulting. Yeah, it's great.

208
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Harry, this is Sally Albright. Harry Burns.

209
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,100
Harry and I, we used to...
We lived in the same building.

210
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,600
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch.
It was good to see you, Joe. Bye.

211
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,300
Thank God he couldn't place me. I drove
to New York with him five years ago

212
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,400
and it was the longest night of my life.

213
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,000
- What happened?
- He made a pass at me. When I said no:

214
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,100
he was going with a girlfriend of mine...

215
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,100
Oh, God. I can't remember her name.

216
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,200
Don't get involved with me. I am 26
and can't remember the name of the girl

217
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,100
I was such good friends with
I wouldn't get involved with her boyfriend.

218
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,400
- So what happened?
- When?

219
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,700
When he made a pass, you said no...

220
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,500
I said we could just be friends.

221
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,800
And this part I remember. He said men
and women could never really be friends.

222
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,400
Do you think that's true?

223
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,600
No.

224
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,400
Do you have any women friends,
just friends?

225
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,700
No.

226
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,700
But I will get one if it's important to you.

227
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,800
Amanda Reese!

228
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,200
That was her name. Thank God.

229
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,900
I will miss you. I love you.

230
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,900
- You do?
- Yes.

231
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,300
I love you.

232
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,300
- What would you like to drink?
- Nothing, thanks.

233
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,500
- D'you have any Bloody Mary mix?
- Yes.

234
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,400
No, wait. Here's what I want. Regular
tomato juice, fill it up three quarters,

235
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,300
then add a splash of Bloody Mary mix -
just a splash - and some lime on the side.

236
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
The University of Chicago, right?

237
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,600
- Yes.
- Did you look this good at university?

238
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,200
- No.
- Did we ever...?

239
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,400
No. No!

240
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,000
We drove from Chicago to New York
together after graduation.

241
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,900
- Would you two like to sit together?
- Great! Thank you.

242
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,300
You were a good friend of...

243
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
Amanda's. I can't believe
you can't remember her name.

244
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,300
What do you mean?
I can remember. Amanda Rice.

245
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,100
- Reese.
- Reese, right. What happened to her?

246
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,900
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?!

247
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,500
You were friends. We didn't make it
because you were such good friends.

248
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,800
- You went with her!
- Was it worth it?

249
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,300
The sacrifice, for a friend
you no longer see?

250
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Harry, you might not believe this,

251
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,700
but I never considered
not sleeping with you a sacrifice.

252
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,900
Fair enough. Fair enough.

253
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
- You wanted to be a gymnast.
- Journalist.

254
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,000
- That's what I said. And?
- I am a journalist. I work at The News.

255
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,500
Great. And you're with Joe.

256
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,400
Well, that's great. Great.

257
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,400
You're together, what, three weeks?

258
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,400
- A month. How did you know?
- You take someone to the airport,

259
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,100
it's the beginning of a relationship. That
is why I never do that at the beginning.

260
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,200
- Why?
- Because eventually things move on

261
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,500
and you don't take someone.
I never wanted anyone to say

262
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,200
"How come you never take me
to the airport any more?"

263
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,200
It's amazing. You look normal,
but actually you are the Angel of Death.

264
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Are you gonna marry him?

265
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,200
We have known each other a month and
neither of us wants to marry right now.

266
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,400
I'm getting married.

267
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
You are?

268
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
- You are?
- Yeah.

269
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,800
- Who is she?
- Helen Hillson. She's keeping her name.

270
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,600
- You're getting married.
- Yeah.

271
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,500
What's so funny about that?

272
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,100
It's just... It's just
so optimistic of you, Harry.

273
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,100
You'd be amazed what
falling madly in love can do for you.

274
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,600
Well, it's wonderful.
It's nice to see you embracing life.

275
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,800
Yeah. Plus, you get to a certain point
where you get tired of the whole thing.

276
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
- What whole thing?
- The whole "life of a single guy" thing.

277
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,700
You meet someone, you have the safe
lunch, you decide to move on to dinner.

278
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,200
You go dancing,
you do the white man's overbite,

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,700
go back to her place, have sex, and then
you know what goes through your mind?

280
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,600
"How long do I have to lie here
and hold her before I can go home?"

281
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,800
"Is 30 seconds enough?"

282
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,800
That's what you're thinking? Is that true?

283
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,300
Sure. All men think that.

284
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
How long do you like to be
held afterwards? All night, right?

285
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,100
That's the problem. Somewhere between
30 seconds and all night is your problem.

286
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,800
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do.

287
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,400
- Staying over?
- Yes.

288
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,000
Would you like to have dinner?
Just friends.

289
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,800
You don't believe
men and women can be friends.

290
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,200
- When did I say that?
- On the ride to New York.

291
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,500
No, no, no, no, I never said that.

292
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,800
Yes, that's right. They can't be friends.

293
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,500
Unless both are involved with someone.
Then they can. I amend the earlier rule.

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,900
If two people are in relationships, the
pressure of possible involvement is lifted.

295
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,400
That doesn't work either.
The person you're with can't see

296
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,100
why you need to be friends
with the person,

297
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
like it means something
is missing from the relationship.

298
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,500
Then when you say "No, nothing
is missing", the person you're with

299
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,600
accuses you of being attracted
to the person you're just friends with,

300
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,500
which you probably are.
I mean, let's face it.

301
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,200
So we're back to the rule
before the amendment:

302
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,000
men and women can't be friends.
Where's it leave us?

303
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,600
- Harry.
- What?

304
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,700
Goodbye.

305
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,700
OK.

306
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,400
I'll just stop walking. I'll let you go ahead.

307
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,500
We were married 40 years ago.

308
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,300
We were married three years,
we got a divorce. Then I married Marjorie.

309
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,000
- First you lived with Barbara.
- Right, Barbara.

310
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,700
But I didn't marry Barbara.
I married Marjorie.

311
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,900
- Then you got a divorce.
- Right. Then I married Katie.

312
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,900
Another divorce.

313
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,700
Then a couple of years later at
Eddie Collecio's funeral, I ran into her.

314
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,700
I was with some girl
I don't even remember.

315
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,600
- Roberta.
- Right. Roberta.

316
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,100
But I couldn't take my eyes off you.

317
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,500
I remember I snuck over to her
and I said...

318
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,800
- What did I say?
- You said "What are you doin' after?"

319
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,400
Right. So I ditch Roberta, we go
for coffee, a month later we're married.

320
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,600
35 years to the day
after our first marriage.

321
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,100
- I went through his pockets.
- Marie, why?

322
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,400
FIVE YEARS LATER

323
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,000
- You know what I found?
- No, what?

324
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,100
They just bought a dining-room table.
His wife just spent $1 ,600 on a table.

325
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,200
- Where?
- The point isn't where, Alice.

326
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,500
The point is he's never gonna leave her.

327
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,200
What else is new?
You've known this for two years.

328
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,800
You're right. I know you're right.

329
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,900
Can't you find someone single? When I
was single I knew lots of nice single men.

330
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,900
There must be someone.
Sally found someone.

331
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,300
Sally got the last good one.

332
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,300
- Joe and I broke up.
- What?

333
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,000
- When?
- Monday.

334
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
- You waited three days?
- Joe's available?

335
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,500
For God's sake, Marie, don't you
have feelings? She's obviously upset.

336
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,700
I'm not that upset.
We'd been growing apart for a while.

337
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,500
But you were a couple.

338
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,200
You had someone to go places with.
You had a date on national holidays!

339
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,900
I said to myself "You deserve
more than this. You're 31 ..."

340
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,400
- And the clock is ticking.
- No, it doesn't start to tick until you're 36.

341
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,000
God, you're in such great shape.

342
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,200
Well, I've had a few days
to get used to it, and I feel OK.

343
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Good. Then you're ready.

344
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,200
- Really, Marie!
- Well, how else do you think you do it?

345
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,000
I've got the perfect guy.
I don't find him attractive, but you might.

346
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
She doesn't have a problem with chins.

347
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,000
- Marie, I'm not ready yet.
- But you just said you were over him.

348
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,700
I am over him,
but I'm in a mourning period.

349
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,700
- Who is it?
- Alex Anderson.

350
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,800
You fixed me up with him six years ago.

351
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,400
Sorry. God.

352
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,000
All right, wait. Here. Here we go.

353
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,600
- Ken Darman.
- He's been married for over a year.

354
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Really?

355
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,300
Married.

356
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,500
- Wait. Wait, I got one.
- Look,

357
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,900
there is no point going out with someone
I might like if I met him at the right time,

358
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,900
but who right now would
just be a transitional man.

359
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,500
OK, but don't wait too long. Remember
what happened with David Warsaw?

360
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,400
His wife left him and everyone said "Give
him some time. Don't move in too fast."

361
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
Six months later he was dead.

362
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,900
Are you saying I should marry quickly
in case he's about to die?

363
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,600
At least you could say you were married.

364
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,900
I'm saying that the right man is out there.
If you don't grab him, someone else will,

365
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,700
and you'll spend your life knowing that
someone else is married to your husband.

366
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,500
Ten! Hut!

367
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,700
- When did this happen?
- Friday. Helen comes home from work

368
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,300
and she says "I don't know
if I wanna be married any more."

369
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,800
Like it's the institution. Nothing personal,
just something she's been thinking about.

370
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,700
I'm calm. I say "Why don't we take time to
think about it? Don't rush into anything."

371
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
- Yeah, right.
- Next day she says she's thought about it.

372
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,500
She wants a trial separation.
She just wants to try it.

373
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But we can still date -
like this is supposed to cushion the blow.

374
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,300
I got married so I could stop dating,
so still dating is not a big incentive

375
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,000
since the last thing you wanna do
is date your wife, who should love you.

376
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,900
Which is what I'm saying to her,
when it occurs to me maybe she doesn't.

377
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,800
So I say to her
"Don't you love me any more?"

378
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,400
D'you know what she says?
"I don't know if I've ever loved you."

379
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,500
That's harsh. You don't
bounce back from that right away.

380
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,700
- Thanks, Jess.
- No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.

381
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
That's particularly harsh.

382
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Then she says someone in her office
is going to South America

383
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,500
and she can sublet his apartment.
I can't believe this. And the doorbell rings.

384
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,100
"I can sublet his apartment" - the words
still hang in the air like in a balloon...

385
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,100
- Like a cartoon.
- Right.

386
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,800
So I go to the door and there are moving
men there. Now I start to get suspicious.

387
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,800
I say "Helen, when did you call
these movers?" She doesn't say anything.

388
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,900
So I ask the movers
"When did this woman book you?"

389
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,900
And they're three huge guys. One with
a T-shirt saying "Don't fuck with Mr Zero."

390
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,600
So I said "Helen, when did you make this
arrangement?" She says "A week ago."

391
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,000
I said "You've known for a week
and you didn't tell me?"

392
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,500
And she says
"I didn't wanna ruin your birthday."

393
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,100
Mr Zero knew you were getting
a divorce a week before you?

394
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,200
- Mr Zero knew.
- I can't believe this!

395
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,500
- I haven't told you the bad part yet.
- What's worse than Mr Zero knowing?

396
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,900
It's all a lie.

397
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,500
She's in love with somebody else.
Some tax attorney.

398
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,600
- She moved in with him.
- How did you find out?

399
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,100
I followed her. Stood outside the building.

400
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,000
- That's so humiliating!
- Tell me about it.

401
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,500
And, you know, I knew. I knew that even
though we were happy, it was an illusion.

402
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,200
And that one day
she'd kick the shit outta me.

403
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,600
Marriages don't break up due to infidelity.
It's a symptom something else is wrong.

404
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, really?
Well, that symptom is fucking my wife!

405
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,700
So I just happened to see
his American Express bill.

406
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
What do you mean
"just happened" to see it?

407
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, he was shaving,
and there it was in his briefcase.

408
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,900
What if he came out and saw you?

409
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,800
You're missing the point.
I'm telling you what I found.

410
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,900
He just spent $1 20
on a new nightgown for his wife.

411
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,900
- I don't think he's ever gonna leave her.
- No one thinks he's ever gonna leave her.

412
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,600
You're right, you're right.
I know you're right.

413
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,100
Someone is staring at you
in Personal Growth.

414
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,300
I know him. You'd like him. He's married.

415
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,100
- Who is he?
- Harry Burns. He's a political consultant.

416
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,200
He's cute.

417
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,500
- You think he's cute?
- How do you know he's married?

418
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,900
Last time I saw him
he was getting married.

419
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,100
- When was that?
- Six years ago.

420
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,100
So he might not be married any more.

421
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,300
Also, he's obnoxious.

422
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,500
It's like in The Lady Vanishes, when she
says "You're the most obnoxious man",...

423
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,900
- "The most contemptible".
- ..then they fall madly in love.

424
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,600
- Also, he never remembers me.
- Sally Albright.

425
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,700
- Hi, Harry.
- I thought it was you.

426
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,400
It is. This is Marie.

427
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,700
Was Marie.

428
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,900
- How are you?
- Fine.

429
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,700
- How's Joe?
- Fine.

430
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,100
I hear he's fine.

431
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,600
- You're not with Joe any more?
- We just broke up.

432
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
I'm sorry. That's too bad.

433
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,700
Yeah. Well, you know.

434
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,300
Yeah.

435
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,400
So...

436
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,600
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

437
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,800
How's married life?

438
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm getting a divorce.

439
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,800
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

440
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,400
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?

441
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,200
What happened with you guys?

442
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,400
When Joe and I started seeing each other
we wanted the same thing.

443
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,700
We didn't wanna get married because
every time anyone we knew got married

444
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,900
it ruined their relationship.
They practically never had sex again.

445
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,800
It's true. That's one of the secrets
that no one ever tells you.

446
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,400
I would sit with my girlfriends who have
kids... my one girlfriend with kids, Alice,

447
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,700
and she would complain about
how she and Gary never did it any more.

448
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,400
She didn't even complain about it.
She said it matter-of-factly.

449
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,000
She said they were up all night,
they were both exhausted,

450
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,900
the kids took every sexual impulse
they had out of them.

451
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,200
Joe and I would say "We're so lucky.
We have this wonderful relationship."

452
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,600
"We can have sex on the kitchen floor
and not worry about the kids walking in."

453
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,500
"We can fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

454
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,900
Then one day I was taking
Alice's girl for the afternoon

455
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,500
cos I promised to take her to the circus.
We were in the cab playing I-spy.

456
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,600
"I spy a mailbox", "I spy a lamppost".

457
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,700
And she looked out the window
and she saw this man and woman

458
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,100
with these two little kids, and the man
had one of the kids on his shoulders.

459
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
And she said "I spy a family."

460
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,300
And I started to cry.
You know, I just started crying.

461
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,500
And I went home
and I said "The thing is, Joe,

462
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,700
we never do fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

463
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,800
And the kitchen floor...?

464
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,900
Not once. It's this very cold,
hard, Mexican ceramic tile.

465
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
Anyway,

466
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:40,300
we talked about it for a long time. I said
"This is what I want" and he said "I don't".

467
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,800
And I said "Well, I guess it's over."
And he left.

468
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,600
And the thing is, I... I feel really fine.

469
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,100
I am over him.
I mean, I really am over him.

470
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,400
That was it for him.
That was the most that he could give.

471
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,500
And every time I think about it, I am more
and more convinced I did the right thing.

472
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,100
Boy, you sound really healthy.

473
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,900
Yeah.

474
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,600
- At least I got the apartment.
- That's what everybody says to me.

475
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,500
But really, what's so hard about finding an
apartment? You read the obituary column.

476
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,300
You find out who died, go to the building,
and then you tip the doorman.

477
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,500
It'd be easier if they combined
obituaries with the real-estate section.

478
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Then you have "Mr Klein died,
leaving a wife, two children

479
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,900
and a spacious three-bedroom
apartment with a wood-burning fireplace."

480
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,300
The first time we met
I really didn't like you that much.

481
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,400
- I didn't like you.
- Yeah, you did.

482
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,900
You were just so uptight then.
You're much softer now.

483
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,900
I hate that kind of remark. It sounds
like a compliment, but it's an insult.

484
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
OK, you're still as hard as nails.

485
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,000
I didn't wanna sleep with you
so you wrote it off as a character flaw,

486
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,400
instead of dealing with the possibility
it might have something to do with you.

487
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,100
What's the statute of limitations
on apologies?

488
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,000
- Ten years.
- I can just get it in under the wire.

489
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,400
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

490
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,400
Are we becoming friends now?

491
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,800
Well...

492
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,300
Yeah.

493
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,500
Great! A woman friend.

494
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,500
You may be the first attractive woman I've
not wanted to sleep with in my entire life.

495
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,200
That's wonderful, Harry.

496
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,600
- We were born in the same hospital,...
- ln 1921 .

497
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,400
- ..seven days apart.
- ln the same hospital.

498
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,600
- We both grew up one block apart.
- We lived in tenements.

499
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,500
- On the Lower East Side.
- On Delancey Street.

500
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,800
- I moved to the Bronx when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

501
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,800
- She moved when she was 1 1 .
- I lived on 183rd Street.

502
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,000
- She worked on the 1 5th floor as a nurse.
- I worked for a prominent neurologist,...

503
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,400
- I had a practice on the 14th floor.
- ..Dr Permelman.

504
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,000
- We never met.
- Never met.

505
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,700
- Can you imagine that?
- D'you know where we met? An elevator.

506
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,700
- I was visiting family.
- ln the Ambassador Hotel.

507
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,500
He was on the third floor,
I was on the 1 2th.

508
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,200
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

509
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,800
Nine extra floors.

510
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,700
- Hello.
- You sleeping?

511
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,600
- No, I was watching "Casablanca".
- Channel?

512
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,400
- Eleven.
- Thank you. Got it.

513
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,500
So you'd be happier with Victor Laszlo
than with Humphrey Bogart?

514
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
- When did I say that?
- When we drove to New York.

515
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,200
- I never said that. I'd never say that.
- All right, fine. Have it your way.

516
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
- Have you been sleeping?
- Why?

517
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,300
Cos I haven't been sleeping.
I really miss Helen.

518
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,900
Maybe I'm coming down with something. I
watched "Leave It to Beaver" in Spanish.

519
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,000
"Buenos días, Seòor Cleaver.
?Dónde están Wallace y Theodore?"

520
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm not well.

521
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,400
I went to bed at 7.30.
I haven't done that since third grade.

522
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,600
That's the good thing
about depression - you rest.

523
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,900
- I'm not depressed.
- OK. Fine.

524
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,900
Do you still sleep
on the same side ofthe bed?

525
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,600
I did for a while,
but now I'm using the whole bed.

526
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,500
God, that's great. I feel weird
when just my leg wanders over.

527
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
I miss her.

528
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,300
- I don't miss him. I really don't.
- Not even a little?

529
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,600
You know what I miss?

530
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,000
I miss the idea ofhim.

531
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,100
Maybe I only miss the idea ofHelen.

532
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,400
No, I miss the whole Helen.

533
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,300
Last scene.

534
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,400
Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

535
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,400
lngrid Bergman. She's low maintenance.

536
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,100
- Low maintenance?
- There are two kinds of women.

537
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,400
- High maintenance and low maintenance.
- And lngrid is low maintenance?

538
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,600
An LM, definitely.

539
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,700
- Which one am I?
- The worst kind.

540
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,600
You're high maintenance,
but you think you're low.

541
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,900
- I don't see that.
- You don't see that?

542
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,100
"Waiter, a house salad,
but not the regular dressing."

543
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,700
"I'll have balsamic vinegar - on the side."

544
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,200
"Then salmon with mustard sauce,
but I want the sauce on the side."

545
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,100
- "On the side" is a big thing for you.
- I just want it the way I want it.

546
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,400
I know. High maintenance.

547
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,600
.. 10,000F should pay our expenses.

548
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,800
Our expenses?

549
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

550
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Best last line of a movie ever.

551
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,300
I'm definitely coming down with
something. Probably a 24-hour tumour.

552
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,700
- You don't have a tumour.
- How do you know?

553
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,700
- If you're so worried, go see a doctor.
- No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.

554
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,500
- Will you be able to sleep?
- If not, I'll be OK.

555
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,800
- What'll you do?
- I'll stay up and moan.

556
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,900
Maybe I should practise now.

557
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,900
Good night, Harry.

558
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,100
Good night.

559
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,600
I had my dream again - where I'm making
love and Olympic judges are watching?

560
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,600
I'd nailed the compulsories,
so this is it: the finals.

561
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,300
I got a 9.8 from the Canadian,
a perfect 10 from the American,

562
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,900
and my mother, disguised as
an East German judge, gave me a 5.6.

563
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,500
Must've been the dismount.

564
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,700
Basically it's the same one
I've had since I was 1 2.

565
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,600
- What happens?
- No, it's... It's too embarrassing.

566
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,200
- Don't tell me.
- OK, there's this guy.

567
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,800
- What's he look like?
- I don't know. He's just kinda faceless.

568
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,300
A faceless guy. OK. Then what happens?

569
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,500
He rips off my clothes.

570
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,600
- Then what happens?
- That's it.

571
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,400
That's it? A faceless guy
rips off your clothes.

572
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,700
And that's the sex fantasy you've had
since you were 12. Exactly the same?

573
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,700
Well, sometimes I vary it a little.

574
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,300
- Which part?
- What I'm wearing.

575
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,700
- What?
- Nothing.

576
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,200
I have decided that for today

577
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,000
we are going to talk like this.

578
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,400
- Like this?
- No. To repeat after me.

579
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

580
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,800
- Pepper.
- Pepper!

581
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,900
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

582
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,600
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

583
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,600
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

584
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,700
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

585
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,300
But I would be proud
to partake of your pecan pie.

586
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,200
Oh, no!

587
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,400
- But I would be proud.
- But I would be proud.

588
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,700
- To partake.
- To partake.

589
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,700
- Of your pecan pie.
- Of your pecan pie.

590
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,500
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie.

591
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,100
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie!

592
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,800
- Would you like to go to the movies?
- Would you like to go...

593
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,700
Not to repeat. Please, to answer. Would
you like to go to the movies tonight?

594
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,300
Well, I'd love to, Harry, but I can't.

595
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,400
What do you have? A hot date?

596
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,100
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

597
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,300
Yeah. I was gonna tell you,
but, I don't know, I felt strange about it.

598
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,100
- Why?
- Cos we've spent so much time together.

599
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,900
I think it's great that you have a date.

600
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,100
- You do?
- Yeah.

601
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,500
- Is that what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

602
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,800
Well, I don't know. Why?

603
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,800
I think you should wear skirts more.
You look really good in skirts.

604
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,600
- I do?
- Yeah.

605
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,000
I think hieroglyphics are really a comic
strip about a character named Sphinxy.

606
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,900
- Harry, you should get out there, too.
- I'm not ready.

607
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,500
- You should.
- I would not be good for anybody now.

608
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,500
It's time.

609
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,900
It was the most
uncomfortable night of my life.

610
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,200
See, no, it has to go this way.

611
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,100
The first date back
is always the toughest, Harry.

612
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,300
You only had one date.

613
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,700
- How do you know it won't get worse?
- How much worse can it get

614
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,300
than finishing dinner, having him pull
a hair out of my head and floss with it?

615
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,400
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

616
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,100
It started out fine.
She's a very nice person.

617
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,800
And we're talking in this Ethiopian
restaurant she wanted to go to.

618
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,500
I was making jokes, like
"I didn't know they had food in Ethiopia."

619
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,300
"This'll be a quick meal. I'll order
two empty plates and we can leave."

620
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,900
Yeah! Nothing from her, not even a smile.

621
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,100
I downshift into small talk
and ask where she went to school.

622
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
She says Michigan State.
And this reminds me of Helen.

623
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,900
All of a sudden I'm in the middle
of an anxiety attack -

624
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,100
my heart's beatin' fast
and I start sweatin' like a pig.

625
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,100
- Helen went to Michigan State?
- No, Northwestern.

626
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,500
But they're both Big Ten schools.

627
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,600
I got so upset
I had to leave the restaurant.

628
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,200
Harry, I think this takes a long time.

629
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,400
It might be months before we're able
to enjoy going out with someone new.

630
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,800
Yeah.

631
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Maybe longer before we're able
to go to bed with someone new.

632
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,600
I went to bed with her.

633
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,700
- You went to bed with her?!
- Sure.

634
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,700
- I don't understand this relationship.
- What d'ya mean?

635
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,600
- Enjoy being with her?
- Yeah.

636
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,800
- You find her attractive?
- Yeah.

637
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
- And you're not sleeping with her?
- No.

638
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,400
You're afraid to let yourself be happy.

639
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,900
Why can't you gimme credit for this?
This is a big thing for me.

640
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,900
I never had a relationship with a woman
that didn't involve sex. I'm growing.

641
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,600
- Are you finished?
- I got a stack o' quarters. I was here first.

642
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,800
- Were not.
- Was too.

643
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,800
- Were not!
- Was too!

644
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,500
- Big jerk.
- Little creep.

645
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,600
- Where was I?
- You were growing.

646
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,300
Yeah.

647
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,600
It's very freeing. I can say anything to her.

648
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Are you saying you can say things to her
you can't say to me?

649
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,400
No, it's just a different perspective.
I get the woman's point of view on things.

650
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,300
She tells me about the men she sees,
and I talk to her about the women I see.

651
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
- You tell her about other women?
- Yeah.

652
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,400
Like the other night, I made love
to this woman and it was incredible.

653
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,300
I took her to a place that wasn't human.
She actually meowed.

654
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,900
- You made a woman meow?
- Yeah, and I can say these things to her.

655
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,400
And the great thing is, I don't have to lie
because I don't wanna get her into bed.

656
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,600
- I can just be myself.
- You made a woman meow?

657
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,700
What do you do with these women?
Just get up and leave?

658
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,300
- Sure.
- Explain how you do it. What do you say?

659
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,100
I say I have an early meeting,
early squash game.

660
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,400
- You don't play squash.
- They don't know that. They just met me.

661
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,400
- That's disgusting.
- I know. I feel terrible.

662
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,900
I'm so glad I never got involved with you.

663
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,800
I just would've been some woman you
had to get outta bed and leave at 3am

664
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,200
and go clean your andirons.
You don't even have a fireplace.

665
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,200
- Not that I would know this.
- Why are you upset? This isn't about you.

666
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,400
Yes, it is! You are a human affront
to all women, and I am a woman.

667
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,500
Hey, I don't hear anyone complaining.

668
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,600
Of course not.
You're out the door too fast.

669
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,000
- I think they have an OK time.
- How do you know?

670
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,000
What d'ya mean how do I know? I know.

671
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,800
- Because they...
- Yes, because they...

672
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,500
- How do you know that they're really...
- What're you saying? They fake orgasm?

673
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,500
- It's possible.
- Get outta here!

674
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,600
Why? Most women
at one time or another have faked it.

675
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,000
- They haven't faked it with me.
- How do you know?

676
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
Because I know.

677
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,700
Right. That's right.

678
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,100
I forgot. You're a man.

679
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,500
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

680
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,200
All men are sure it never happened
to them and most women have done it,

681
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,500
so you do the math.

682
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,100
You don't think I could tell the difference?

683
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,000
- No.
- Get outta here.

684
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,200
Are you OK?

685
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,200
Oh, God.

686
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,700
Oh, God.

687
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,100
Oh, God.

688
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh, yeah, right there.

689
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,700
Oh, God.

690
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,800
Yes! Yes! Yes!

691
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,800
Yes! Yes!

692
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,900
Yes!

693
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,200
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

694
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,700
Yes! Yes! Yes!

695
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,200
Yes! Yes! Yes!

696
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,200
Oh, God.

697
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,900
I'll have what she's having.

698
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,900
~ Sleigh bells ring

699
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,000
~ Are you listening?

700
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,200
~ ln the lane snow is glistening

701
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
~ A beautiful sight

702
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,500
~ We're happy tonight

703
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,600
~ Walking in a winter wonderland

704
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,500
~ Gone away is the bluebird

705
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,400
~ Here to stay is a new bird

706
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,400
~ He sings a love song as we go along

707
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,200
~ Walking in a winter wonderland

708
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,200
~ ln the meadow we can build a snowman

709
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,800
~ And pretend that he is Parson Brown

710
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,300
~ He'll say "Are you married?"

711
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,700
~ We'll say "No, man"

712
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,600
~ "But you can do thejob
when you're in town, brother"

713
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,800
~ Later on we'll conspire

714
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,500
~ As we dream by the fire

715
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,300
~ To face unafraid the plans that we made

716
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,300
~ Walking in a winter wonderland

717
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,100
~ lfthey asked me

718
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,900
~ I could write a book

719
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,800
~ About the way you walk and whisper...

720
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,700
- I like you with no beard. I see your face.
- It is my face!

721
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,300
Whoa! Dipping you.

722
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,400
- Thank you for taking me out tonight.
- Don't be silly.

723
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,300
The next New Year's Eve, if neither
of us is with anybody, you got a date.

724
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,500
Deal.

725
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,500
See? Now we can dance cheek to cheek.

726
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,000
~ lsjust to tell them

727
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,200
~ That I love you a lot

728
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,300
~ Then the world discovers

729
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,400
~ As my book ends

730
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,700
~ How to make two lovers

731
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,100
~ Of friends

732
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,800
Hey, everybody!
Ten seconds to New Year!

733
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,300
- Ten,...
- Wanna get some air?

734
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,500
- Yeah.
- ..seven, six, five, four,

735
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,000
three, two, one!

736
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,100
Happy New Year!

737
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,700
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

738
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:32,300
He was a head counsellor at boys' camp,
I was a head counsellor at girls' camp,

739
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,400
and they had a social one night,
and he walked across the room.

740
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,700
I thought he was coming
to talk to my friend Maxine,

741
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,500
cos people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

742
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,500
But he was coming to talk to me,
and he said

743
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,700
"I'm Ben Small
of the Coney lsland Smalls."

744
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,100
At that moment I knew. I knew
the way you know about a good melon.

745
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,900
You sent flowers to yourself.

746
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,700
$60 I spent on this big arrangement
of flowers, and I wrote a card

747
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,000
that I planned to leave on the table
where Arthur would just happen to see it.

748
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,500
What did the card say?

749
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,200
"Please say yes. Love Jonathan."

750
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
- Did it work?
- He never even came over.

751
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,600
He forgot a charity thing his wife is
chairman of. He's never gonna leave her!

752
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,200
- Of course he isn't.
- You're right. I know you're right.

753
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,900
- Where is this place?
- Somewhere on the next block.

754
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,000
I can't believe I'm doing this.

755
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,500
Harry is one of my best friends
and you are one of my best friends.

756
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,000
And if you two hit it off, we could still
be friends, instead of drifting apart

757
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,200
like you do when you date someone
who doesn't know your friends.

758
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,400
You and I haven't drifted apart
since I started seeing Arthur.

759
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,100
If Arthur ever left his wife
and I actually met him,

760
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,800
I am sure that you and I would drift apart.

761
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,100
He's never gonna leave her.

762
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,300
Of course he isn't.

763
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
You're right. I know you're right.

764
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,400
- I dunno about this.
- It's just a dinner.

765
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:05,400
I've finally gotten to a place where I'm
comfortable with just me and my work.

766
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,400
- If she's so great why don't you date her?
- I told you. We're just friends.

767
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,500
- So she's not attractive?
- No, she is attractive.

768
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,000
- You said she had a good personality.
- She has a good personality.

769
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,300
What?

770
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,600
When someone's not attractive, they're
described as having a good personality.

771
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,500
If you'd asked about looks and
I'd said "She has a good personality",

772
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,600
she's not attractive.

773
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,100
But because I mentioned she has
a good personality, she can be either.

774
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,000
Attractive with a good personality,
or not attractive with a good personality.

775
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,300
- So which one is she?
- Attractive.

776
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,700
But not beautiful, right?

777
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:50,200
It's like, whenever I read Jimmy Breslin,
it's as if he's leaving a wake-up call

778
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,600
- for the City of New York.
- What d'you mean by a "wake-up call"?

779
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,900
He's saying that we've got people
in the city who are on welfare...

780
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,600
Would I have seen any of your windows?

781
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,000
A couple of weeks ago
I did a thing with hostages.

782
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,100
- The people in blindfolds.
- Yeah.

783
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,700
I thought it was like late '80s.

784
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,900
That's interesting.

785
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,900
Let's just say I'm not
a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

786
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,500
Well, he's the reason I became a writer,
but that's not important.

787
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,000
Harry, you and Marie
are both from New Jersey.

788
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,800
- Really?
- Where?

789
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,500
- South Orange.
- Haddonfield.

790
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,400
- So, what are we gonna order?
- I'm gonna start with the grilled radicchio.

791
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,000
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.
Not only does she pick the best,

792
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,700
but she orders it in a way even the chef
didn't know how good it could be.

793
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,100
- Restaurants have become too important.
- I agree.

794
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,400
"Restaurants are to people in the '80s
what theatre was to people in the '60s."

795
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,100
I read that in a magazine.

796
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,300
I wrote that.

797
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,100
- Get outta here.
- No, I did! I wrote that.

798
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,500
I've never quoted anything
from a magazine. That's amazing.

799
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,200
Don't you think that's amazing?
And you wrote it?

800
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,900
I also wrote
"Pesto is the quiche of the '80s."

801
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,800
- Get over yourself!
- I did!

802
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,600
- Where did I read that?
- New York Magazine.

803
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,100
Sally writes for New York Magazine.

804
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,400
You know, that piece had a real impact
on me. I don't know much about writing...

805
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
It spoke to you, and that pleases me.

806
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,500
I mean, you have to admire people
who can be that articulate.

807
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,200
Nobody has ever quoted
me back to me before.

808
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,500
I've been looking for a red suede pump.

809
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,000
What do you think of Jess?

810
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,300
- Well...
- Do you think you could go out with him?

811
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,900
- I don't know...
- Cos I feel really comfortable with him.

812
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,300
- You wanna go out with Jess.
- If it would be all right with you.

813
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,500
Sure. Sure. I'm just worried about Harry.

814
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,600
He's sensitive, he's going through a rough
period, and I don't want you to reject him.

815
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,200
I wouldn't. I totally understand.

816
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,800
If you don't think you're gonna call Marie,
do you mind if I call her?

817
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,700
- No, no.
- Good. Good.

818
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,800
But for tonight you shouldn't.
I mean, Sally's very vulnerable right now.

819
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,000
You can call Marie, but wait a week or so.
Don't make any moves tonight.

820
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,700
Fine. No problem.
I wasn't even thinking about tonight.

821
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,000
Well, I don't feel like walking any more.
I think I'll get a cab.

822
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,200
- I'll go with you.
- Great! Taxi!

823
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:12,300
A man came to me and said
"I found nice girl for you."

824
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,700
"She lives in the next village

825
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:20,200
and she is ready for marriage."

826
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,600
We were not supposed to meet
until the wedding,

827
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
but I wanted to make sure.

828
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,200
So I sneak into her village,
hid behind a tree,

829
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,300
watch her washing the clothes.

830
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:41,700
I think if I don't like the way she looks,
I don't marry her.

831
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,800
But she looked very nice to me.

832
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,000
So I said "OK" to the man.

833
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,700
We get married.

834
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,700
We married for 55 years.

835
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,700
FOUR MONTHS LATER

836
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,200
- I have to get this.
- Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

837
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,100
- We'll find something. Great stuff.
- Should have gone to the plant store.

838
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,500
- Here. Perfect for them.
- What's that?

839
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,300
Battery-operated pith helmet, with fan.

840
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,500
- Why is this necessary in life?
- I don't know.

841
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,500
Look at this. Also makes great fries.

842
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,700
Good. Call off the dogs. The hunt is over.

843
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,800
Sally, this is the greatest.

844
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,200
Sally, please report to me.

845
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,100
Look. This is the greatest.
You're gonna love this.

846
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,200
This is a singing machine. Look, you sing
the lead and this has the backup.

847
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,700
- This is from Oklahoma!
- "Surrey with the Fringe on Top".

848
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,300
Yes, perfect.

849
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,200
~ Chicks and ducks and geese
better scurry

850
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,200
~ When I take you out in my surrey

851
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,500
~ When I take you out in my surrey
with the fringe on top

852
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,000
Now you!

853
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,600
~ Watch that fringe and see how it flutters

854
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,400
~ When I drive those
high-steppin' strutters

855
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,700
~ Nosey pokes'll
peek through the shutters

856
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,200
~ And their eyes will pop!

857
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,500
~ The wheels are yellow,
the upholstery's brown

858
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,900
~ The dashboard's genuine leather

859
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,700
~ With isinglass curtains that will ro...

860
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,000
What?

861
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,000
It's my voice, isn't it? You hate my voice.

862
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,700
- I know, it's terrible. Joe hated it...
- It's Helen.

863
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,800
Helen?

864
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,400
She's coming right towards me.

865
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,500
- How are you, Harry?
- Fine. I'm fine.

866
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,300
This is Ira Stone. Harry Burns.

867
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,300
Harry.

868
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,600
I'm sorry. This is Sally Albright.
Helen Hillson

869
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,800
and Ira.

870
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,800
Sally.

871
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,000
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

872
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,200
Well...

873
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,200
- See you.
- Yeah. Bye.

874
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,000
Nice to meet you, Ira.

875
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,300
You OK?

876
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,100
Yeah, I'm perfect.

877
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,500
She looked weird, didn't she?
She looked really weird.

878
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,300
- I've never seen her before.
- Trust me. Her legs looked heavy.

879
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,500
- Must be retaining water.
- Harry!

880
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,200
Believe me, the woman saved everything.

881
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,500
Sure you're OK?

882
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,500
I'm fine.
Look, it had to happen at some point.

883
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,600
In a city of eight million, you're bound
to run into your ex-wife. So it happened.

884
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,000
And now I'm fine.

885
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,700
I like it. It works. It says "home" to me.

886
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,600
All right. All right.
We'll let Harry and Sally be the judge.

887
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,900
What do you think?

888
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,900
- It's nice.
- Case closed.

889
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,400
Of course he likes it - he's a guy.

890
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,600
Sally?

891
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,700
What's so awful about it?

892
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,800
It's so awful, there's no way to begin
to explain what's so awful about it.

893
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,300
Honey, I don't object to your things.

894
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,000
If we had room, you could put
your things in it, like your bar stools...

895
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,000
Honey, wait, wait. Honey, wait.
You don't like my bar stools?

896
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,600
Harry, come on,
someone has to be on my side.

897
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,500
I'm on your side.
I just want you to have good taste.

898
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,900
I have good taste!

899
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,900
Everybody thinks they have good taste,
but they couldn't all have good taste.

900
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,900
You know, it's funny.
We started out like this, Helen and I.

901
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,500
We hung things, we picked out tiles
together. Then you know what happens?

902
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Six years later you're singing "Surrey
with the Fringe on Top" in front of lra!

903
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:03,100
- Do we have to talk about this right now?
- Yes. Right now is the perfect time,

904
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,300
because I want our friends to benefit
from the wisdom of my experience.

905
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,900
Right now everything is great. Everyone
is happy and in love, and that's wonderful.

906
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,400
But sooner or later, you'll be screaming
at each other about who'll get this dish.

907
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:22,600
This $8 dish will cost $1 ,000 in calls to the
legal firm of "That's mine, this is yours".

908
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,900
- Harry!
- Please.

909
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,200
Jess, Marie,
do me a favour for your own good.

910
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,500
Put your name in your books right now
before you don't know whose is whose,

911
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,700
because some day you'll go 1 5 rounds
over who's gonna get this coffee table.

912
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:43,500
This stupid, wagon-wheel,
Roy-Rogers, garage-sale coffee table!

913
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,000
- I thought you liked it.
- I was being nice!

914
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,600
He just bumped into Helen.

915
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,100
I want you to know

916
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,100
that I will never want
that wagon-wheel coffee table.

917
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,100
I know, I know, I shouldn't have done it.

918
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:26,900
Harry, you have to try to find a way of
not expressing every feeling you have,

919
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,300
every moment that you have them.

920
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,900
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

921
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,700
There are times and places for things.

922
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:40,500
Well, the next time you're giving a lecture
on social graces, tell me cos I'll sign up.

923
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,300
Hey! You don't have
to take your anger out on me.

924
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,700
I'm entitled to throw anger your way.

925
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,800
Especially when I'm being told how
to live my life by Miss Hospital Corners!

926
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,500
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing bothers you!

927
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,300
- You never get upset about anything!
- Don't be ridiculous!

928
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,000
What?

929
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,200
You never get upset about Joe. I never
see it back up on you. How is it possible?

930
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,700
- Don't you experience feelings of loss?
- I don't have to take this crap.

931
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,400
- If you're over Joe, why not see people?
- I see people!

932
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,000
See people! Have you slept
with one person since Joe?

933
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,000
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

934
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,000
That will prove I'm over Joe
because I fuck somebody?!

935
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,100
You have to move back to New Jersey cos
you've slept with everyone in New York.

936
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,700
I don't see that turning Helen
into a faint memory for you.

937
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,900
Besides, I will make love
when it is making love.

938
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,300
Not the way you do it,
like you're out for revenge or something.

939
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,300
Are you finished now?

940
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,000
Yes.

941
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,500
Can I say something?

942
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,300
Yes.

943
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

944
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,900
Don't say a word!

945
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,600
It's a monkey, a monkey.
Monkey see, monkey do.

946
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,100
- It's an ape. Going ape.
- It's a baby!

947
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,600
- Planet ofthe Apes!
- She said baby! Try Planet ofthe Dopes.

948
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,500
- It doesn't look like a baby.
- Big mouth. Jagger as a baby.

949
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,300
- Baby ape!
- Stop with the apes.

950
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,700
- Baby's breath.
- Rosemary's Baby's mouth?

951
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,300
- "Won't You Come Home, Bill Baby?"
- Kiss the baby!

952
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,800
- "Melancholy Baby's Mouth"!
- Baby fish... Baby-fish mouth!

953
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,900
- 1 5 seconds.
- A big mouth.

954
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,000
- Baby boom!
- Baby...

955
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,700
Draw something resembling anything!

956
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,300
- Crying baby. Kiss the baby.
- Baby spitting up... Exorcist Baby!

957
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,300
- "Yes Sir, That's My Baby".
- "No sir, don't mean maybe."

958
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,300
- That's it. Time's up.
- Baby talk.

959
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,900
Baby talk? What's that?
That's not a saying.

960
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:03,000
But "baby-fish mouth" is sweeping
the nation! I hear them talking!

961
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,700
Final score. Our team: 1 10.

962
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,900
You guys: 60.

963
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,100
- Ouch. Fix! Definitely a fix.
- Pathetic.

964
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,400
- I can't draw.
- That's a baby, and it's clearly talking.

965
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,600
You're wonderful.

966
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,500
- Who wants coffee?
- I do, and I love you.

967
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,500
- D'you have tea?
- lndustrial strength.

968
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,000
- I'll help you. Decaf?
- Yeah.

969
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,000
- Three.
- Yes, please.

970
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,500
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door, down the hall.

971
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,000
Never looked like a baby to me.

972
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,700
- Which part?
- All of it.

973
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
- You were gonna show me a book cover.
- Yeah, it's in the den.

974
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,400
Julian, help yourself.
Have some more wine, whatever, OK?

975
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,000
I like saying den. Got a nice ring to it.

976
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,300
Emily's a little young for Harry,
don't you think?

977
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,200
Well, she's young,
but look what she's done.

978
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,700
What has she done? She makes desserts.

979
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,100
- Does Julian seem a little stuffy to you?
- He's a good guy. You should talk to him.

980
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,800
He's too tall to talk to.

981
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,900
She makes 3,500
chocolate-mousse pies a week.

982
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,700
Emily is "Aunt Emily"?

983
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,300
He took us to a Met game last week.
It was great.

984
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,700
- You all went to a Met game together?
- Yeah, but it was a last-minute thing.

985
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,600
But Sally hates baseball.

986
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,800
Harry doesn't even like sweets.

987
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,500
Julian is great.

988
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,700
I know. He's a grown-up.

989
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,100
- Emily is terrific.
- Yeah. But when I asked where she was

990
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,700
when Kennedy was shot,
she said "Ted Kennedy was shot?"

991
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,900
- Hello?
- Are you alone?

992
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,200
Yeah. I was just finishing a book.

993
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,000
- Could you come over?
- What's the matter?

994
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,200
- He's getting married.
- Who?

995
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,500
Joe!

996
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,000
I'll be right there.

997
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,800
- Hi.
- Are you all right?

998
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,700
Come on in.

999
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,400
- I'm sorry to call you so late.
- It's all right.

1000
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,000
- I need a Kleenex!
- OK.

1001
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,700
OK. OK.

1002
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,000
He just called me up,
"Wanted to see how you were",

1003
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,600
"Fine. How are you?" "Fine."

1004
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,200
His secretary's on vacation,
everything's all backed up.

1005
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,100
He's got a big case in Newark,
blah, blah, blah.

1006
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,500
And I'm sitting on the phone thinking
"I am over him, I really am over him,

1007
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,800
I can't believe I was ever
remotely interested in any of this."

1008
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,200
And then he said "I have some news."

1009
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,200
She works in his office. She's a paralegal.
Her name is Kimberly.

1010
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,300
He just met her!

1011
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:14,600
She's supposed to be his
transitional person, not "the one"!

1012
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:24,900
All this time, I've been saying
that he didn't wanna get married.

1013
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,800
But the truth is,

1014
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,600
he didn't wanna marry me.

1015
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,000
He didn't love me.

1016
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,600
If you could take him back
right now, would you?

1017
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,600
No!

1018
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,500
But why didn't he wanna marry me?

1019
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,200
- What's the matter with me?
- Nothing.

1020
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,600
- I'm difficult.
- You're challenging.

1021
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,200
- I'm too structured. I'm closed off.
- But in a good way.

1022
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,700
No, no, no. I drove him away.

1023
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,200
And I'm gonna be 40!

1024
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,000
When?

1025
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,400
- Some day.
- ln eight years.

1026
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:19,900
But it's there! It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

1027
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:26,400
And it's not the same for men. Charlie
Chaplin had babies when he was 73.

1028
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,000
Yeah, but he was too old to pick 'em up.

1029
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,500
Come here. Come here.

1030
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,500
It's gonna be OK.

1031
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,900
It's gonna be fine, you'll see.

1032
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,100
Go ahead. It's not one
of my favourites anyway.

1033
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,500
It's gonna be OK. Hm?

1034
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,700
Hm? OK?

1035
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,700
OK.

1036
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,400
- I'll make some tea.
- Harry, could you hold me a little longer?

1037
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,500
Oh, sure.

1038
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,900
OK? Hm?

1039
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,900
Are you comfortable?

1040
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,800
Sure.

1041
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,500
- D'you want something to drink?
- No, I'm OK.

1042
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,500
I'm going to get up for some water,
so it's really no trouble.

1043
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,800
OK. Water.

1044
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:09,700
You have all your video tapes
alphabetised and on index cards.

1045
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,500
Thank you.

1046
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:15,100
- D'you wanna watch something?
- No. Not unless you do.

1047
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,900
No. That's OK.

1048
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:35,400
- D'you wanna go to sleep?
- OK.

1049
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,200
Where are you going?

1050
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,800
I gotta go.

1051
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,200
Gotta go home, change my clothes
and go to work. And so do you.

1052
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:23,000
But after work I'd like to take you
out to dinner, if you're free. You free?

1053
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,800
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

1054
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,700
- Fine.
- Fine.

1055
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,900
- Yours!
- Hello.

1056
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,300
- Sorry to call so early.
- Are you all right?

1057
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,800
No one I know would call at this hour.

1058
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,100
- No one I know would call.
- It's awful.

1059
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,100
- I need to talk.
- What happened?

1060
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,100
- Harry came over.
- I went to Sally's.

1061
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,000
- I was upset Joe was marrying.
- One thing led to another.

1062
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,300
- Before I knew it we were kissing. Then...
- ..we did it.

1063
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,900
They did it!

1064
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,000
- That's great!
- We prayed for it.

1065
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,800
- You shoulda done it before.
- We said you should do it.

1066
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,500
- You belong together.
- You killed two birds with one stone.

1067
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,200
- Two wrongs make a right.
- How was it?

1068
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,000
- During part was good,...
- Good,...

1069
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,200
- ..then I felt suffocated.
- ..then it wasn't.

1070
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,500
- Sorry.
- The worst.

1071
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,000
- I had to go.
- He left.

1072
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,900
- I feel bad.
- I'm embarrassed.

1073
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,300
I don't blame you.

1074
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,300
- I feel ill.
- I'm catching a cold.

1075
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,200
Look, it didn't work out.

1076
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,600
Never sleep with anyone
when you find out your ex is marrying.

1077
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,700
- Who's talking?
- Is that Jess?

1078
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,400
- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.
- It's Bryant Gumbel.

1079
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,200
Wanna have breakfast?

1080
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,300
- No, I'm not up to it.
- I feel too awful.

1081
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,400
- Good.
- I mean, it's so early.

1082
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,000
- But call me later.
- I'll call you later.

1083
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,400
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

1084
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,500
- Bye.
- Bye.

1085
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,400
- God!
- I know.

1086
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,600
Tell me I'll never have to be
out there again.

1087
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,800
You will never have to be out there again.

1088
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,500
I'll just say we made a mistake.

1089
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,100
Sally, it was a mistake.

1090
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,900
I just hope I get to say it first.

1091
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,400
I hope she says it before I do.

1092
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:33,200
- It was a mistake.
- I am so relieved that you think so, too.

1093
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,700
I'm not saying last night wasn't great.

1094
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,800
- It was!
- Yes, it was!

1095
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:45,400
- We just never should have done it.
- I couldn't agree more.

1096
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
- I am so relieved!
- Great.

1097
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,200
Yeah.

1098
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,500
Two mixed green salads.

1099
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:29,700
It is so nice when you can sit
with someone and not have to talk. Hm?

1100
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,400
Most of the time,
you go to bed with someone,

1101
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,400
then she tells you all her stories,
you tell her all your stories.

1102
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:44,400
But with Sally and me,
we'd already heard each other's stories.

1103
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,600
So once we went to bed, we didn't know
what we were supposed to do. You know?

1104
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Sure, Harry.

1105
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,500
I don't know.

1106
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:58,800
Maybe you get to a point in a relationship
where it's too late to have sex. You know?

1107
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,100
Is Harry bringing anyone to the wedding?

1108
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,300
I don't think so.

1109
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:20,000
- Is he seeing anyone?
- He was seeing this anthropologist, but...

1110
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,200
- What does she look like?
- Thin, pretty, big tits.

1111
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,100
Your basic nightmare.

1112
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,000
What d'ya think?

1113
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,300
Marie...

1114
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,900
Tell the truth.

1115
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,800
It's just beautiful.

1116
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,900
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Marie and Jess.

1117
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,100
And to consecrate
their vows of matrimony.

1118
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,700
The vows they will take join their lives.

1119
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,800
The wine they will share
binds all their hopes together.

1120
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,500
And by the rings they will wear,

1121
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:41,400
they will be known to all
as husband and wife.

1122
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,500
I've never seen her so happy.
She's a different person.

1123
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,300
Oh, yeah, she is. It's great,
but what're we gonna do about you?

1124
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,100
- Me?
- Hon, you wanna dance?

1125
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,600
- Oh, yeah! Yeah, I do.
- Excuse us.

1126
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,800
- Hi.
- Hello.

1127
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,500
- Nice ceremony.
- Beautiful.

1128
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:26,200
Boy, the holidays are rough! Every year I
try to get from Thanksgiving to New Year.

1129
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,900
A lot of suicides.

1130
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,000
- Would you like a pea pod with shrimp?
- Thank you.

1131
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,100
- How've you been?
- Fine.

1132
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,900
- Seeing anybody?
- Harry.

1133
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,100
- What?
- I don't wanna talk about this.

1134
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:44,600
- Why not?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1135
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:49,000
Why can't we get past this? Are we
gonna carry this thing around for ever?

1136
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:53,600
- Forever? It just happened!
- It happened three weeks ago.

1137
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,700
You know how a year to a person
is like seven years to a dog?

1138
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,800
Yes!

1139
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,800
Is one of us supposed to be a dog
in this scenario?

1140
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,600
- Yes.
- Who is the dog?

1141
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
- You are.
- I am! I am the dog!

1142
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,500
I am the dog! I...

1143
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:24,500
I don't see that. You are the dog. You act
like what happened didn't mean anything.

1144
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,900
No, I don't, but why
does it have to mean everything?

1145
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:33,300
Because it does! You know it better than
anyone, cos after it happens you walk out!

1146
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,600
- I didn't walk out.
- Sprinted is more like it.

1147
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,100
- We both agreed it was a mistake.
- The worst mistake I ever made!

1148
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,000
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing!

1149
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:49,800
Fine! But let's just get one thing straight. I
did not go over there to make love to you.

1150
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,100
But you looked at me with these weepy
eyes: "Don't go home. Hold me, Harry."

1151
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:58,100
- What was I supposed to do?
- Are you saying you took pity on me?

1152
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,000
- No! I was...
- Fuck you!

1153
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:07,600
Everybody, could I have
your attention, please?

1154
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,900
I'd like to propose a toast,
to Harry and Sally.

1155
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,100
To Harry and Sally.

1156
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,500
If Marie or I had found either of them
remotely attractive,

1157
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,900
we would not be here today.

1158
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,200
~ Have yourselfa merry little Christmas

1159
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,400
~ Let yourselfbe light

1160
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:46,500
~ From now on
our troubles will be out ofsight

1161
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:55,500
~ Have yourself a merry little Christmas

1162
01:21:56,700 --> 01:22:00,000
~ Make the yuletide gay

1163
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,500
~ From now on
our troubles will be miles away

1164
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,900
Hi, it's me. It's the holiday season,

1165
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,500
and I thought I'd remind you
that it's the season of forgiveness.

1166
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,300
And, although it's not widely known,
it is also the season of grovelling.

1167
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,000
So, if you felt like calling me back,

1168
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:26,300
I'd be more than happy to do
the traditional Christmas grovelling.

1169
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,400
Give me a call.

1170
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,200
Hi, I'm not home. I'll call you right back.

1171
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,400
If you're there, please pick up.
I really wanna talk to you.

1172
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:58,500
The fact you're not answering leads me
to believe you're either, A: not at home,

1173
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:02,100
B: home, but don't wanna talk to me, or C:

1174
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,700
home, desperately wanna talk to me,
but trapped under something heavy.

1175
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,000
If it's either A or C, please call me back.

1176
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,600
Obviously she doesn't wanna talk to me.
What do I have to do, be hit on the head?

1177
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,400
If she wants to call, she'll call.
I'm through actin' like a schmuck.

1178
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:24,200
~ If you're feeling sad and lonely

1179
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,400
~ There's a service I can render

1180
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,600
~ Tell the one who digs you only

1181
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:34,000
~ I can be so warm and tender

1182
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,800
~ Call me

1183
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,300
~ Maybe it's late tojust call me

1184
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,900
~ Don't be afraid to just phone moi

1185
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:47,000
~ Call me and I'll be around

1186
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,800
Give me a call.

1187
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,400
- Hi, Harry.
- Hello. Hi! Hi!

1188
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,200
I didn't know that you would...
That you were there.

1189
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,200
- What're you doing?
- I was just on my way out.

1190
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,900
Where you going?

1191
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,600
- What do you want, Harry?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1192
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:06,100
I... I just called to say I'm sorry.

1193
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,800
OK.

1194
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,200
- I gotta go.
- Wait a second. Wait... wait a second.

1195
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,700
What're you doin' for New Year's? Going
to the Tylers' party? I don't have a date.

1196
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:30,800
If you don't have a date, we always said
we could be together for New Year's and...

1197
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,000
I can't do this any more.
I am not your consolation prize.

1198
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,300
Goodbye.

1199
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:50,800
And here we are once again. The 16th
annual "New Year's Rockin' Eve",

1200
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,000
coming to you live...

1201
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,000
What's so bad about this?
You got Dick Clark - tradition.

1202
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,000
You got Mallomars,
the greatest cookie of all time.

1203
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,600
And you're about to give the Knicks
their first championship since 1973.

1204
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,000
I don't know why I let you drag me to this.

1205
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:33,600
This is much better. Fresh air,
I have the streets all to myself.

1206
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,500
Who needs to be at a big, crowded party,
pretending to have a good time?

1207
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,400
Plus, this is the perfect time
to catch up on my window-shopping.

1208
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,400
This is good.

1209
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,300
So the guy says "Read the card."

1210
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,400
- I'm going home.
- You'll never get a taxi.

1211
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,700
Oh, God!

1212
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,000
You realise that
we could never be friends.

1213
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,500
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,

1214
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,200
men and women can't be friends,
cos the sex part always gets in the way.

1215
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,900
That's not true!

1216
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,600
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

1217
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,600
- He always wants to have sex with her.
- What if they don't wanna have sex?

1218
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,400
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

1219
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,200
And that is the end ofthe story.

1220
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,100
- I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

1221
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,000
That's too bad.

1222
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,000
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

1223
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,700
~ It had to be you

1224
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:29,100
~ It had to be you

1225
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,300
~ I wandered around

1226
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,300
~ And I finally found

1227
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:44,200
~ The somebody who

1228
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:53,100
~ Could make me be true

1229
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:58,200
~ And could make me be blue...

1230
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,800
- I'm going.
- It's almost midnight!

1231
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,900
- The thought of not kissing somebody...
- I'll kiss you.

1232
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,700
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

1233
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,800
Taxi!

1234
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,700
Shit.

1235
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,000
- Come on, stay. Please.
- Thanks, Jess. I just... I have to go.

1236
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,000
- Wait two minutes.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

1237
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:28,100
~ Might never be mean

1238
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,300
~ Might never be cross

1239
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,500
~ Or try to be boss

1240
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,000
~ But they wouldn't do

1241
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,300
~ For nobody else

1242
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,000
~ Gave me a thrill

1243
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,700
~ With all your faults

1244
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,900
~ I love you still

1245
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,700
~ It had to be you...

1246
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,600
I've been doin' a lot of thinkin',
and the thing is, I love you.

1247
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,700
- What?
- I love you.

1248
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:14,200
- How d'you expect me to respond to this?
- How about you love me, too?

1249
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,800
- How about I'm leaving?
- Doesn't what I said mean anything?

1250
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,900
Sorry, Harry. I know it's New Year's Eve,
I know you're feeling lonely,

1251
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:28,200
but you just can't show up, say you love
me and expect that to make it all right.

1252
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:32,000
- It doesn't work this way.
- Well, how does it work?

1253
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,900
- I don't know, but not this way.
- Then how about this way?

1254
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,600
I love that you get cold when it's 71° out.

1255
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:41,500
I love that it takes you 1 1/2 hours
to order a sandwich.

1256
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:45,000
I love that you get a crinkle here
when you look at me like I'm nuts.

1257
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,900
I love that after I spend a day with you
I smell your perfume on my clothes.

1258
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:53,700
And I love that you are the last person I
wanna talk to before I go to sleep at night.

1259
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:57,600
And it's not because I'm lonely
or because it's New Year's Eve.

1260
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,900
I came cos when you realise you wanna
spend the rest of your life with someone

1261
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,500
you want the rest of your life
to start as soon as possible.

1262
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,000
You see?

1263
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,900
That is just like you, Harry.

1264
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,300
You say things like that and you make it
impossible for me to hate you!

1265
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,400
And I hate you, Harry.

1266
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,700
I really hate you.

1267
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,500
I hate you.

1268
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,900
What does this song mean?
My whole life, I don't know.

1269
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,600
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot" -
should we forget old acquaintances?

1270
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,200
Or if we forget them,
should we remember them?

1271
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,100
Which is not possible
cos we already forgot 'em!

1272
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:05,700
Maybe it just means we should remember
that we forgot them, or something.

1273
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,300
Anyway, it's about old friends.

1274
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,700
The first time we met
we hated each other.

1275
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,500
No, I hated you. The second time we met,
you didn't even remember me.

1276
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,100
I did, too! I remembered you.

1277
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,800
The third time we met
we became friends.

1278
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:34,300
- We were friends for a long time.
- And then we weren't.

1279
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,800
And then we fell in love.

1280
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,700
- Three months later we got married.
- It only took three months.

1281
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,800
12 years and three months.

1282
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:47,300
- We had a really wonderful wedding.
- It really was a beautiful wedding.

1283
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,700
- We had this enormous coconut cake.
- Huge coconut cake with the tiers.

1284
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,000
And there was this very rich
chocolate sauce on the side.

1285
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,600
Right. Cos not everybody likes it
on the cake cos it makes it soggy.

1286
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:03,200
Particularly, the coconut soaks up a lot,
so it's important to keep it on the side.

1287
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
~ It had to be you

1288
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,100
~ It had to be you

1289
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,900
~ I wandered around and finally found

1290
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,300
~ The somebody who

1291
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,900
~ Could make me be true

1292
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,600
~ Could make me be blue

1293
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,400
~ And even be gladjust to be sad

1294
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:25,000
~ Thinking of you

1295
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,500
~ But you say ee-ther, and I say either

1296
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,000
~ You say nee-ther, I say neither

1297
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,600
~ Ee-ther, either Nee-ther, neither

1298
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:36,400

01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,000
~ Let's call the whole thing off

1303
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:51,800
~ Oh, if we call the whole thing off,
then we must part

1304
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:57,400
~ And though if we ever part,
that would break my heart

1305
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,100
~ You say laughter, I say larf-ter

1306
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,600
~ You say after, I say arf-ter

1307
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,800
~ Before we know we need each other

1308
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,900
~ So we'd better call, call it off, oh!

1309

~ Sugar, why don't we

1313
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:21,900
~ Let's, let's call the whole thing

1314
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:09,300
~ They're writing songs oflove,
but not for me

1315
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:14,300
~ A lucky star's above, but not for me

1316
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:19,600
~ With love to lead the way,
I've found more clouds ofgrey

1317
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:25,000
~ Than any Russian play could guarantee

1318
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:30,200
~ I was a fool to fall and get that way

1319
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:32,400
~ Hi-ho alas

1320
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:35,700
~ And also lackaday

1321
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,100
~ Although I can't dismiss
the memory ofher kiss

1322
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:44,600
~ I guess she's not

1323
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,300
~ For

1324
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,900
~ Me

1325
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
~ It had to be you

1326
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,200
~ It had to be you

1327
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,000
~ For nobody else gave me a thrill

1328
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,700
~ With all your faults, I love you still

1329
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,400
