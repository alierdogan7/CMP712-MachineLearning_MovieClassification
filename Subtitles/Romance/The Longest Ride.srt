1080
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,927
He ate in it.

1081
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,286
He slept in it.

1082
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,602

to his head so it
wouldn't come off!

He broke his arm riding
a calf when he was seven.

1086
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,250
I found him sneaking into
the barn at night to practice...

1087
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,687
hanging on with his
non-cast arm.

1088
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,320

to stop riding
when he shouldn't.

1094
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,290
Great rider, too.

1095
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,888
Even if you stop now,
you'd still have a
better career than he had.

1097
