1
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,640
Well, that was awkward.

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:05,718
What?

3
00:00:05,743 --> 00:00:09,044
Did you not notice Steve leering
at me through the whole meeting?

4
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:11,421
I didn't see any leering.

5
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:12,664
Oh, yeah, he was leering.

6
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:14,389
He was eating cookies at me.

7
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:17,460
How do you eat a cookie “at” someone?

8
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,773
I'd show you, but it'd freak you out.

9
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:22,484
Bonnie, I'm not gonna
tell you I told you so,

10
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:24,265
but maybe someone could say it for me.

11
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:26,429
She did tell you not to sleep...

12
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,064
Yeah, I heard her, Wendy.

13
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:31,687
But what am I supposed to do,
go back in time and un-bang him?

14
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:36,531
If I could go back in time, I'd
totally un-bang Barry Slotnick.

15
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:39,492
For me, it would be Brad Hoisington.

16
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:41,484
Oh, and his brother Dale.

17
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:43,523
The drum roadie for ZZ Top.

18
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:45,890
And not un-bang, re-bang.

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,884
Okay, we're all sluts. Moving on.

20
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:50,352
Wait, I didn't go.

21
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:53,421
The Korean guy who told
me he was Joe Montana.

22
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:57,595
How do you mistake a
Korean guy for Joe Montana?

23
00:00:57,707 --> 00:01:01,078
I was drunk, and he kept the
helmet on till we were done.

24
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,436
Okay, you win.

25
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,828
The point is Steve is still hung up on me,

26
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:06,152
and I can't go back to that meeting.

27
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:08,478
I need to find one where I can feel safe.

28
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:10,835
Hmm, that's a toughie.

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,411
Is there an A.A. meeting
in Northern California

30
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:14,054
where you haven't slept with someone?

31
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:16,011
What are you insinuating?

32
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:17,734
I think it's pretty clear.

33
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:20,115
You guys all get it, right?

34
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:22,684
Why don't you go to a gay meeting?

35
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:24,319
Well, don't you have to be gay?

36
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:25,921
No, you just have to be a drunk.

37
00:01:25,923 --> 00:01:28,539
Anything else you put in
your mouth is your business.

38
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:31,539
Actually, that sounds like it might be fun.

39
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,804
You all saw that, right?

40
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:44,726
No one eats a cookie like that.

00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:10,505
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

43
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,664
Thank you.

44
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,806
I'm Milo.

45
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:14,264
Bonnie. Christy.

46
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:15,507
So glad you're here.

47
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:16,609
Are you new?

48
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:19,484
No, we're here 'cause
this one slept her way

49
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:20,648
out of our regular meeting.

50
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,679
Oh, honey.

51
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:24,271
Been there.

52
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:26,398
Yeah, we're usually at South
street on Tuesday nights.

53
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:27,756
Marjorie's meeting.

54
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,813
I love her.

55
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,138
Helped me get sober.

56
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:31,861
How is that hag doing?

57
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:34,901
Still rocking a pant suit?

58
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:36,531
She is.

59
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,468
She's got a serious boyfriend now.

60
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:41,327
Shut up. I thought there was
police tape over that thing.

61
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:43,171
I like him.

62
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,070
Well, come on in. Snack table's over there.

63
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:46,210
It is sushi night,

64
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:48,578
so grab a spicy tuna roll and settle in.

65
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,421
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

66
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:52,790
Well, this is perfect.

67
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:54,481
Good-looking,
well-dressed people,

68
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:56,265
and I haven't slept with any of them.

69
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,743
Bonnie?

70
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,858
Jeanine?

71
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:03,070
Oh, my God, Aunt Jeanine!

72
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:05,729
Christy crackerjack, is that you?!

73
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,801
Look at you, you're all grown up!

74
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:10,563
Oh. Oh.

75
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:14,524
I can't believe it's you.

76
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:15,892
Mom, look, Aunt Jeanine!

77
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:17,027
Yeah, I see her.

78
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:20,096
Kiddo, you realize I
wasn't really your aunt.

79
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:21,835
Yeah, I know.

80
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,101
My Mom sat me down and explained
it to me when I turned 36.

81
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:27,871
Hey, look at that, you have
slept with somebody here.

82
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:33,109
How you doing, Jeanine?

83
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:34,444
I'm good.

84
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,413
I beat cancer, I beat Hep C.

85
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:39,449
I had two angioplasties
and a hip replacement.

86
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:41,384
I'm like the Bionic Lesbian.

87
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,220
So how long you been sober?

88
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:47,190
Ooh, six months.

89
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:48,898
This time.

90
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,660
Well, good for you.

91
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,228
I'm going on 28 years.

92
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,830
Wow. What's your secret?

93
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:56,218
I haven't had a drink in 28 years.

94
00:03:57,726 --> 00:04:00,236
But I have thought about you a lot.

95
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:01,504
Yeah, me, too.

96
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:02,538
About you.

97
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:04,507
Okay, listen, good to see you.

98
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,876
Maybe, uh, after the
meeting, we can catch up.

99
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:08,144
Yeah, I'd like that.

100
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:11,180
Okay. Excuse me, I got to
go get this party started.

101
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:12,215
Paul.

102
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,750
Play me in.

103
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:22,024
How great is it to see Jeanine?

104
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:23,993
Yeah, terrific. Let's go.

105
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:26,229
Hold on, hold on! Sashimi!

106
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:32,368
So let me get this straight.
You lived with this woman?

107
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,636
For about a year.

108
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:37,210
And during this time, did
you do gay things with her?

109
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,539
Gay things were done.

110
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:43,375
What kind of gay things?

111
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:45,748
What difference does it make?

112
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,734
I'm having trouble picturing it.

113
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:49,757
Then stop.

114
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,253
Were you in love?

115
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:52,922
It's complicated.

116
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:56,625
When we met, I was experiencing
financial difficulties.

117
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:58,515
We were living in our car.

118
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:01,500
Which was parked in a lovely neighborhood.

119
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,400
Anyway, I met Jeanine, she was a blast.

120
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:06,302
I knew she liked me, she loved Christy.

121
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:08,070
So I decided, “what the hell?”

122
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:09,687
I've faked it with a man,
I can fake it with a woman.

123
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:11,673
So bottom line,

124
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:13,642
you pretended to be in love with this woman

125
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:15,244
in order to keep a roof over your heads.

126
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:17,212
Yes, Marjorie, just as at other times,

127
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:19,615
I've pretended to be a nun, Geena Davis,

128
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:21,463
and a USDA meat inspector.

129
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:26,119
Oh, yeah, we did eat well that summer.

130
00:05:26,957 --> 00:05:28,724
So how did it end with you two?

131
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:30,692
I realized Jeanine was
getting kind of serious,

132
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:32,728
so I did the decent thing.
I packed up Christy,

133
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,330
and we snuck out in
the middle of the night.

134
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:36,832
I was told we were going to Sea World.

135
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:39,627
I told you were going
to “see the world.”

136
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,403
and we did.

137
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:43,905
Sounds like you owe this woman an amends.

138
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:46,541
Oh, for God's sake, Marjorie,
I can't possibly make amends

139
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:48,643
to every single person I've screwed over.

140
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:49,644
Why not?

141
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:50,612
Well, for starters,

142
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,690
when am I gonna be in Japan again?

143
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,485
Thanks again for seeing me.

144
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,815
Hey, I was happy to get the call.

145
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,492
So you still in real estate?

146
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,682
Number one salesperson in my firm.

147
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,264
Ever since they legalized gay marriage,

148
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,900
there's a queer tidal wave
headed for the suburbs.

149
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,269
Nice.

150
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,539
Yeah, me and restoration
hardware... Big winners.

151
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,142
Who's this?

152
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:22,143
That's Lenore.

153
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:23,678
She came along after you.

154
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,712
Oh, that's nice.

155
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:25,947
Is she around? I'd love to meet her.

156
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,182
Yeah, right on the mantle.

157
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,198
Bonnie, Lenore. Lenore, Bonnie.

158
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:35,258
I'm so sorry. How did she die?

159
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:37,892
Doing what she loved
most, mountain climbing.

160
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:40,561
Well, in this case, Mountain falling.

161
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:43,531
Uh, I'm sorry.

162
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:46,041
Don't be. She would have loved that joke.

163
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:49,504
You gonna tell me why you're here?

164
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,839
Why do you think?

165
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,853
I need to make amends.

166
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:56,811
You were so good to me and Christy,

167
00:06:56,813 --> 00:07:00,057
and I just... treated you horribly.

168
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:02,917
I accept your amends.

169
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:03,918
Really?

170
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,353
It's that easy?

171
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:06,988
Well, in all fairness,

172
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,651
I did my best to keep you
loaded so you'd stick around.

173
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,361
So I guess I owe you an amends, too.

174
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:14,895
Wait, I'm confused.

175
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:16,831
All these years, I thought I was the one

176
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,965
who took advantage of you.

177
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,400
Now you're saying I was the victim?

178
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:21,101
Some victim.

179
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:22,703
I kept a well-stocked bar,

180
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:24,738
I tossed you a couple of Quaalude’s,

181
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,608
and you lived with me
for two years rent-free.

182
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,869
Two years?

183
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:34,014
Time flies when you put
bourbon on your pancakes.

184
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,283
Huh.

185
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,185
Okay, well, mm-hmm.

186
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:40,120
What do you say we just call it even?

187
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:41,288
Works for me.

188
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:42,476
You hungry?

189
00:07:43,018 --> 00:07:44,158
I guess I could eat.

190
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:46,660
Come on, I'll throw a
couple steaks on the grill.

191
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:48,634
- Sounds good.
- All right.

192
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:50,464
I'm really glad we could reconnect.

193
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:51,398
Me, too.

194
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,733
I would have laid even money

195
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:54,501
you'd be dead or in jail by now.

196
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:56,770
Technically, I've been both.

197
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:02,612
This is always a hard day for me.

198
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,078
Four years ago,

199
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:09,307
I finally found the courage
to come out to my father.

200
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:15,276
He hasn't spoken to me since!

201
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,291
- It's just so hard...
- A piano player?

202
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:19,292
Sushi?

203
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:21,573
I swear, it was all here.

204
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,133
Why aren't we using the dishwasher?

205
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,468
I like it better this way.

206
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,536
It's soothing.

207
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,038
Although you still cannot dry a dish.

208
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:33,974
What?! Look at it.

209
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:35,442
It's wetter than when I handed it to you.

210
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:36,776
Well, then give me a better towel.

211
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,078
Really?

212
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,179
You're blaming the towel?

213
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:40,880
You'd rather I blame you

214
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:42,415
for not using the friggin' dishwasher?

215
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:45,830
Same old Bonnie.

216
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:47,020
Hey.

217
00:08:47,022 --> 00:08:48,822
Can I ask you something?

218
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:50,290
Sure. Anything.

219
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:52,926
You know what? Never mind.

220
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:54,961
Ugh, I always hated when you did that.

221
00:08:54,963 --> 00:08:56,429
Ask me.

222
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,020
Okay.

223
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:00,416
Back when we were a couple,

224
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:02,385
were you just going through the motions,

225
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,119
or, did you have any 
feelings for me at all?

226
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,275
Of course I had feelings for you.

227
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:15,104
I mean, as much as I was capable
of having feelings for anybody.

228
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:18,057
You know, I was devastated when you left.

229
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:20,291
I know.

230
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:23,700
When I saw you walk into that meeting,

231
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:26,492
I thought my heart was
gonna jump out of my chest.

232
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:29,462
Yeah, I got a little jolt, too.

233
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:30,463
Ooh. Oh, geez.

234
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:32,298
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

235
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,066
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

236
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:57,940
Hi.

237
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,088
Hey.

238
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:01,596
How'd it go with Aunt Jeanine?

239
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,982
Would you please stop
calling her Aunt Jeanine?

240
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,190
Fine.

241
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:08,573
How'd it go with your former lesbian lover?

242
00:10:10,758 --> 00:10:12,358
It went great.

243
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,761
I made my amends, we
talked about old times,

244
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:15,928
had a couple steaks.

245
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:17,196
That's it?

246
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,400
No dipping your toe back in the lady pond?

247
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,702
Don't be silly.

248
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,485
So...

249
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:26,776
All parties remained dry.

250
00:10:27,237 --> 00:10:28,174
Hey.

251
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:30,376
I am your mother. Show a little respect.

252
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:31,944
Oh, please, we're way past that.

253
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,002
Good night.

254
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:35,794
Night.

255
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:42,166
Okay. I dipped my toe, I dipped
my face. Everything got dipped.

256
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:43,912
What?

257
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:44,752
It just happened.

258
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,807
One thing led to another.
You know how it is.

259
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:48,131
No, I don't.

260
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:50,223
I'm team penis, always have been.

261
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,968
So what does this mean?

262
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:55,403
Now you're gay?

263
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,538
No.

264
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,190
I mean, for an hour
and a half, yes, but no.

265
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,543
An hour and a half?

266
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:04,879
We're women... There was lots of cuddling.

267
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,247
I don't understand.

268
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,049
How can you flip-flop like that?

269
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:09,017
I don't know.

270
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,518
I dropped a plate, we bumped heads.

271
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,387
I might have had a concussion.

272
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,096
So what happens now?

273
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:18,393
Does Christy have two mommies?

274
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,630
Nothing happens.

275
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,898
It was a fluke.

276
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,300
It was sex with the ex, a one-time thing.

277
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,235
Does Jeanine know that?

278
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,204
Of course she knows. We're
mature, sober women now.

279
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,606
We understand what this was about.

280
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,276
Ah, damn it.

281
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,277
What?

282
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,041
She sent me a poem.

283
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,618
Wow, something smells good.

284
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,752
It should.

285
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:46,053
It's your favorite.

286
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,421
Oh, hi there.

287
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,589
Mm, hi.

288
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:50,858
Dinner will be ready in 20,

289
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,060
so why don't you go wash up.

290
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,395
Uh, okay.

291
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:55,763
Did we have plans?

292
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,205
No. I thought I'd surprise you.

293
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,002
Well, mission accomplished.

294
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,636
How'd you get in?

295
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:04,305
Christy Crackerjack let me in.

296
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,639
Ah, sure.

297
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,508
Where is that fun-size treat?

298
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,842
Doing her homework.

299
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:10,277
Just like old times, huh?

300
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,278
You bet.

301
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,313
Excuse me.

302
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,647
Love that tool belt.

303
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,282
Very sexy.

304
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,151
Okay.

305
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,056
Hi, Mom number one.

306
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:25,626
Why didn't you call me, text me, anything?

307
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:26,794
Oh, I don't know.

308
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,428
'Cause I'm a little stinker.

309
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:29,996
Want some Bruschetta?

310
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:31,682
No, I don't want any Bruschetta.

311
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:33,433
Your loss. Jeanine grows her own basil.

312
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:34,835
Yeah, I know. She showed me her garden.

313
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,003
I bet she did.

314
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:38,705
Hey, Bonnie, you still hate mushrooms?

315
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:39,973
Actually, no.

316
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,928
Hmm, look at you, trying new things.

317
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,715
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

318
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:52,135
and say that you two gals
are not on the same page.

319
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,721
Now I remember why I ran out on her.

320
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:55,956
She's crazy.

321
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:57,813
Interesting.

322
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:59,681
Couple of days ago, Steve was crazy.

323
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:00,805
He was.

324
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:03,274
Last week, I was crazy, Marjorie was crazy,

325
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:04,721
the guy at the gas station was crazy.

326
00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:06,330
So you see what I'm up against.

327
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:12,830
God, I am so full.

328
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,369
I hope you left room for blueberry pie

329
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,794
with fresh whipped cream.

330
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,193
Oh, no, Jeanine, no more food.

331
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,658
I'm gonna have to take my pants off.

332
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,158
Now you see how it happens.

333
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:28,620
If you don't mind, I think I'm
gonna have my dessert later.

334
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:29,644
You sure?

335
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:32,003
Yeah, I've got to finish my homework,

336
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,495
and I bet you two want some alone time.

337
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,353
No need. We're fine.

338
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:37,677
It's okay, mom.

339
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:39,435
I know you're sexually active.

340
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,385
Thank you so much for dinner.

341
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,876
It's great to have you back.

342
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:45,668
Likewise, crackerjack.

343
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:53,940
Honey, you want coffee with your dessert?

344
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:55,498
No, I'm good.

345
00:13:55,523 --> 00:13:56,989
You're better than good.

346
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:58,313
You're great.

347
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,776
Jeanine, please sit.

348
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:05,800
L-let's talk.

349
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,745
Is everything okay?

350
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:11,975
No, not really.

351
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:17,405
Listen, I'm... really grateful
you accepted my amends.

352
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:21,862
But, what happened after,
the kissing and...

353
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:24,416
... stuff...

354
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:27,593
Was maybe ill-advised.

355
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,050
How so?

356
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,323
The thing is...

357
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:34,396
... I'm not really into women.

358
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,651
Really? You could have fooled me.

359
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:40,791
Hey, when I'm doing something,
I like to do it well.

360
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:44,018
Look, don't get hung
up on the labels, okay?

361
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,676
Gay, straight.

362
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:48,869
The point is you and I have
feelings for each other.

363
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,838
We had 'em a long time ago,

364
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:52,002
and we have 'em right now.

365
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:54,728
Well, of course we have
feelings for each other.

366
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:58,090
But?

367
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:01,157
You and I back together, uh...

368
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:03,854
It's not gonna work.

369
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:07,408
Okay.

370
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:08,683
I get it.

371
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:10,119
I'm really sorry.

372
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:11,677
I never meant to hurt you.

373
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:13,570
At least this time,

374
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,229
you didn't run out in
the middle of the night.

375
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:17,979
Again, I'm really sorry.

376
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,796
You know what, it's okay.

377
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:22,588
I'll just pack up my pots
and pans and get out of here.

378
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,646
Oh, come on. You don't have to leave.

379
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,704
We're both adults.

380
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:26,795
We can have some coffee.

381
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,330
I can sit here and enjoy your pie.

382
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:30,388
Yeah, yeah, I heard it, too.

383
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:37,474
So, Bonnie, did you ever
make amends to that woman?

384
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:40,133
As a matter of fact, I did.

385
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:42,103
For an hour and a half.

386
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:46,168
Well, good for you.

387
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,955
The healing starts when we
clean up the messes we made.

388
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,393
Unless you're making new ones.

389
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:53,783
Big, sloppy new ones.

390
00:15:56,979 --> 00:16:00,276
Did you know my mom's amends
come with a happy ending?

391
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:03,479
Wait, more gay stuff was done?

392
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,026
Bonnie, can I talk to you?

393
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,484
Sure, I guess.

394
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,549
Ooh.

395
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,494
More mama drama.

396
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:13,268
What's up?

397
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:14,892
Okay, well, I noticed

398
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:16,584
that you haven't been
coming to this meeting,

399
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,744
and I'm guessing it's because
I made it uncomfortable for you.

400
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,136
A little bit, but...
Let me... let me finish.

401
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,948
I get why you wanted to keep
our relationship on the down-low.

402
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:26,619
You weren't that into me.

403
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,190
And you know what?

404
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:29,447
That's okay.

405
00:16:29,682 --> 00:16:31,449
I just hope we can go
back to being friends.

406
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:35,096
Does that mean you're done
with the weird cookie thing?

407
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:37,154
Yeah, sorry about that.

408
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:39,113
I was trying to be sexy.

409
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,422
Bonnie.

410
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:41,737
Oh, boy.

411
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:46,033
What happened between us the
other night can't be a mistake.

412
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:48,140
We belong together.

413
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,041
Okay. Hold that thought.

414
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,806
Now do you get it?

415
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:56,883
Oh, please.

416
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:58,408
You call that a kiss?

417
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,815
Now I can picture it!

418
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:07,588
Okay, that was pretty good.

419
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:10,604
I wasn't ready. I want to go again.

420
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,932
This is exactly what happened in Japan!

421
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:28,991
Hola, mi nombre es Soledad,
y soy una alcohólica.

422
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,916
Hola, Soledad.

423
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:34,473
You get how ridiculous it is

424
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:35,963
that we have to go to this meeting

425
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,955
- to avoid people you've slept with.
- Oh, come on.

426
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,658
Where's your sense of adventure?

427
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,970
How am I supposed to get anything out of it

428
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:43,190
if I can't understand what they're saying?

429
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:44,971
Fine, I'll translate.

430
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,932
“I drank.”

431
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:53,713
“I ruined my life.”

432
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:58,572
“It's all better now.”

433
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:00,722
Thanks, that helps.

434
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:02,423
Shh.

435
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,072
Dios mio.

436
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:05,330
Bonnie Plunkett?

437
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:07,963
Andale.

438
