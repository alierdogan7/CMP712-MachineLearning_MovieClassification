1
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,138  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's an old joke.

2
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:53,183  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
Two elderly women are
at a Catskill mountain resort.

3
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:56,516  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
One says, "The food at this place
is really terrible."

4
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:59,579  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
The other says,
"l know, and such small portions."

5
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:02,626  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's essentially
how l feel about life:

6
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:06,424  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
full of loneliness, misery,
suffering and unhappiness...

7
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:09,660  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:334 Y2:409
and it's all over
much too quickly.

8
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:12,498  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:374 Y2:410
The other important joke for me...

9
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,266  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
is one usually attributed
to Groucho Marx...

10
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:19,207  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
but it appears originally in Freud's
Wit and lts Relation to the Unconscious.

11
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:21,507  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt goes like this, l'm paraphrasing:

12
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:25,948  X1:100 X2:621 Y1:334 Y2:409
l never want to belong to any club that
would have someone like me for a member.

13
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:30,886  X1:111 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's the key joke of my adult life
in terms of my relationships with women.

14
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:34,152  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
Lately the strangest things
have been going through my mind...

15
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:37,854  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
because l turned 40, and l guess
l'm going through a life crisis.

16
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:40,659  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm not worried about aging.
l'm not one of those characters.

17
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:44,326  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
But l'm balding slightly on top. That's
about the worst you can say about me.

18
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:47,735  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think l'm going to get better
as l get older.

19
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:50,774  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think l'm going to be
the balding, virile type...

20
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:54,675  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:374 Y2:410
as opposed to the distinguished gray.

21
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:56,736  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:374 Y2:410
Unless l'm neither of those two.

22
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:59,305  X1:122 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
Unless l'm one of those guys with saliva
dribbling out of his mouth...

23
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:04,013  X1:107 X2:614 Y1:334 Y2:409
who wanders into a cafeteria with a
shopping bag, screaming about socialism.

24
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:08,652  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
Annie and l broke up, and l still
can't get my mind around that.

25
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:12,287  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
l keep sifting the pieces
of the relationship through my mind...

26
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:17,232  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
examining my life and trying to
figure out where did the screwup come.

27
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:20,236  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
A year ago we were in love.

28
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:25,502  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's funny. l'm not a morose type.
l'm not a depressive character.

29
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:29,311  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was a reasonably happy kid.

30
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,406  X1:191 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was brought up in Brooklyn
during World War ll.

31
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,913  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
He's been depressed.

32
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:38,421  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Suddenly he can't do anything.
- Why are you depressed, Alvy?

33
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,516  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
Tell Dr. Flicker.
lt's something he read.

34
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:44,584  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:374 Y2:410
Something he read, huh?

35
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:48,928  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
- The universe is expanding.
- The universe is expanding?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,798  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
The universe is everything,
and if it's expanding...

37
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:55,737  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
someday it will break apart,
and that will be the end of everything.

38
00:02:55,806 --> 00:03:00,209  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is that your business?
He stopped doing his homework!

39
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:03,770  X1:124 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What's the point?
- What's the universe got to do with it?

40
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:07,215  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're here in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is not expanding!

41
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:11,278  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt won't be expanding
for billions of years!

42
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:16,292  X1:137 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
We've got to try and enjoy ourselves
while we're here! Huh?

43
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,431  X1:179 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
My analyst says l exaggerate
my childhood memories...

44
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,970  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
but l swear l was brought up
underneath the roller coaster...

45
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:29,233  X1:198 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
in the Coney lsland section
of Brooklyn.

46
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:33,607  X1:109 X2:612 Y1:334 Y2:409
Maybe that accounts for my personality,
which is a little nervous.

47
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:38,411  X1:132 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have a hyperactive imagination.
My mind tends to jump around a little.

48
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:41,940  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have some trouble
between fantasy and reality.

49
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:45,253  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
My father ran
the bumper-car concession.

50
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:48,019  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
There he is, and there l am.

51
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:51,550  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
l used to get my aggression out
through those cars.

52
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:56,424  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
l remember the staff
at our public school.

53
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,833  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
We had a saying,
"Those who can't do, teach...

54
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:03,169  X1:194 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
and those who can't teach,
teach gym."

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,643  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
And those who couldn't do anything,
l think, were assigned to our school.

56
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:13,076  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
l must say, l always thought
my schoolmates were idiots.

57
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,085  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
Melvyn Greenglass
and his fat little face.

58
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:19,316  X1:206 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
And Henrietta Farrell,
Miss Perfect all the time.

59
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,985  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
And lvan Ackerman,
always the wrong answer. Always!

60
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,994  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seven and three is nine.

61
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,298  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:334 Y2:409
Even then l knew
they were just jerks.

62
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:31,858  X1:112 X2:610 Y1:374 Y2:410
ln 1942 l had already discovered women.

63
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:37,397  X1:279 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
He kissed me!

64
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,943  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's the second time this month!
Step up here.

65
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,001  X1:267 X2:455 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What did l do?
- Step up here.

66
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,673  X1:136 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What did l do?
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

67
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:47,684  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why? l was just expressing
a healthy sexual curiosity.

68
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:51,210  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
Six-year-old boys
don't have girls on their minds.

69
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:52,448  X1:333 X2:388 Y1:374 Y2:410
l did.

70
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:56,425  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
For God sakes, Alvy, even Freud
speaks of a latency period!

71
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:59,657  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
l never had a latency period.
l can't help it.

72
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,062  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why couldn't you
have been more like Donald?

73
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,499  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:374 Y2:410
There was a model boy.

74
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:06,934  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Tell the folks
where you are today, Donald.

75
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:10,531  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:374 Y2:410
l run a profitable dress company.

76
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:14,339  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sometimes l wonder where
my classmates are today.

77
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:18,280  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm president
of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

78
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,116  X1:285 X2:436 Y1:374 Y2:410
l sell talliths.

79
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:26,020  X1:188 X2:533 Y1:334 Y2:409
l used to be a heroin addict,
now l'm a methadone addict.

80
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:29,389  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm into leather.

81
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:34,053  X1:112 X2:609 Y1:334 Y2:409
l lost track of most of my old
schoolmates, but l wound up a comedian.

82
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:37,157  X1:162 X2:560 Y1:374 Y2:410
They did not take me in the army.

83
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:39,896  X1:300 X2:422 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was 4-P.

84
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,565  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:334 Y2:409
ln the event of war,
l'm a hostage.

85
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:48,578  X1:171 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
You always only saw the worst
in people.

86
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:51,706  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
You never could get along
with anyone in school.

87
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:54,182  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
You were always out of step
with the world.

88
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:57,186  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Even when you got famous,
you still distrusted the world.

89
00:05:57,254 --> 00:06:00,917  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
l distinctly heard it.
He muttered under his breath, "Jew."

90
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,925  X1:271 X2:451 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're crazy.
- No, l'm not.

91
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:06,156  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
We were walking off the tennis court.
He was there and me and his wife.

92
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,255  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
He looked her,
then they both looked at me...

93
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:10,493  X1:236 X2:486 Y1:334 Y2:409
and under his breath
he said, "Jew."

94
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:12,536  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're a total paranoid.

95
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:15,504  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
How am l a paranoid?
l pick up on those kind of things.

96
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:20,203  X1:124 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was having lunch with guys from NBC,
so l said, "Did you eat yet?"

97
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:24,907  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
Tom Christie said, "No. Jew?"
Not "Did you?"

98
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:28,247  X1:156 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
Not "Did you eat?" but "Jew eat?"
You get it?

99
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,947  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Max--
- Stop calling me Max.

100
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:34,752  X1:118 X2:604 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why? lt's a good name for you.
Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

101
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:37,350  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l don't. l was in a record store.
Listen to this.

102
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:43,025  X1:122 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's this tall, blond crew-cutted guy
and he's looking at me in a funny way.

103
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,001  X1:162 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's saying, "Yes, we have a sale
this week on Wagner."

104
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,335  X1:159 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wagner, Max.
l know what he's trying to tell me.

105
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:51,897  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
Very significantly, Wagner.

106
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:55,537  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:374 Y2:410
Right, Max. California, Max.

107
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:58,673  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Get the hell out of this crazy city.
- Forget it.

108
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:01,741  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
We move to sunny L.A.
All of show business is out there.

109
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:04,652  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
You keep bringing it up,
but l don't want to live in a city...

110
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:08,852  X1:115 X2:607 Y1:334 Y2:409
where the only cultural advantage is you
can make a right turn on a red light.

111
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,918  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
All right, forget it. Aren't you
going to be late for meeting Annie?

112
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:14,794  X1:117 X2:604 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm meeting her in front of the Beekman.
l have a few minutes left, right?

113
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:33,840  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are you on television?

114
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:40,116  X1:244 X2:477 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah, occasionally.

115
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,885  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's your name?

116
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,893  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
You wouldn't know it.
lt doesn't matter.

117
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,988  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're on Johnny Carson, right?

118
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,796  X1:269 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
Once in a while.

119
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:53,393  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's your name?

120
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,837  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm Robert Redford.
- Come on!

121
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:01,105  X1:156 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy Singer.
Thanks very much for everything.

122
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:06,239  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:374 Y2:410
This is Alvy Singer!

123
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:11,546  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
This guy's on television.
Alvy Singer, right? Am l right?

124
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:13,954  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Give me a break.
- This guy's on television.

125
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:15,958  X1:194 X2:527 Y1:374 Y2:410
l need the large polo mallet.

126
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:19,359  X1:130 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
-Who's on television?
-This guy, on the Johnny Carson Show.

127
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,025  X1:136 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
- ls this a meeting of the teamsters?
- What program?

128
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,068  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Can l have your autograph?
- You don't want my autograph.

129
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:28,070  X1:208 X2:514 Y1:374 Y2:410
l do! lt's for my girlfriend.

130
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:30,163  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:374 Y2:410
Make it out to Ralph.

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,835  X1:158 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?
- lt's for my brother.

132
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:39,808  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're really Alvy Singer,
the TV star?

133
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,877  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Alvy Singer over here!
- lt's all right, fellas.

134
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:47,651  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
Jesus, what did you do?
Come by way of the Panama Canal?

135
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:50,956  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
-l'm in a bad mood.
-l'm here with the Godfather cast.

136
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:55,158  X1:108 X2:613 Y1:334 Y2:409
-Learn to deal with it.
-l'm dealing with two guys named Cheech.

137
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:57,826  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:374 Y2:410
Please, l have a headache.

138
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,961  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
You are in a bad mood.
You must be getting your period.

139
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:03,029  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm not getting my period! Jesus!

140
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:06,167  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
Every time anything out of the ordinary
happens, you think l have my period.

141
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:08,973  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
A little louder. l think one
of them may have missed it.

142
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:12,243  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Has the picture started?
- Two minutes ago.

143
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:14,511  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's it. Forget it.
l can't go in.

144
00:09:14,585 --> 00:09:17,486  X1:212 X2:510 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Two minutes.
- We've blown it already.

145
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:19,954  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:374 Y2:410
l can't go in, in the middle.

146
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:22,959  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
ln the middle? We've only missed
the titles. They're in Swedish.

147
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,961  X1:120 X2:601 Y1:374 Y2:410
You want to get coffee for two hours?

148
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,294  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Two hours? No. l'm going in.
- Go ahead. Good-bye.

149
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:31,095  X1:242 X2:480 Y1:334 Y2:409
While we're talking,
we could be inside.

150
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:35,070  X1:111 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
Can we not argue in front of everybody?
l get embarrassed.

151
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:39,803  X1:130 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
- All right. So what do you want to do?
- l don't know. Go to another movie?

152
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:42,141  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
-Let's see The Sorrow and the Pity.
-We've seen it.

153
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:45,306  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm not in the mood to see
a four hour documentary on Nazis.

154
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:47,407  X1:304 X2:418 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm sorry.

155
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:52,421  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've got to see a picture exactly
from start to finish, 'cause l'm anal.

156
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:54,457  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's a polite word
for what you are.

157
00:09:56,694 --> 00:10:00,926  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.
lt is not one of his best.

158
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:03,057  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt lacks a cohesive structure.

159
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:07,001  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
You get the feeling he's not absolutely
sure what it is he wants to say.

160
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:12,008  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've always felt he was essentially
a technical filmmaker.

161
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:15,170  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:374 Y2:410
Granted La Strada was a great film.

162
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:18,373  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
Great in its use of negative imagery
more than anything else.

163
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,714  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm going to have a stroke.
- Stop listening to him.

164
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:25,119  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:374 Y2:410
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

165
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:28,625  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
All that Juliet of the Spirits
or Satyricon.

166
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:31,889  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
l found it incredibly indulgent.

167
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:35,159  X1:154 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
He really is one of
the most indulgent of filmmakers.

168
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:37,530  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:374 Y2:410
Key word here is "indulgent."

169
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:42,834  X1:156 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What are you depressed about?
- l missed my therapy. l overslept.

170
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:44,999  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:374 Y2:410
How can you possibly oversleep?

171
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:46,770  X1:262 X2:460 Y1:374 Y2:410
The alarm clock.

172
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:48,869  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what a hostile gesture
that is to me?

173
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:51,938  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know. Because of our
sexual problem, right?

174
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:55,974  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Everybody in line has to know
our rate of intercourse?

175
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:57,884  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's like Samuel Beckett.

176
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:01,789  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
l admire the technique,
but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.

177
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:04,623  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'd like to hit him on a gut level.
- Stop it.

178
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:08,688  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's spitting on my neck
when he talks.

179
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,929  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know something else?
You're so egocentric that...

180
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:15,529  X1:133 X2:588 Y1:334 Y2:409
if l miss my therapy you can only think
of it in terms of how it affects you!

181
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,005  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:374 Y2:410
They're probably on their first date.

182
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:23,740  X1:158 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
Probably met by answering an ad
in the New York Review of Books.

183
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:25,748  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
"Thirtyish academic
wishes to meet woman...

184
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:29,752  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
who's interested in Mozart,
James Joyce and sodomy."

185
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,754  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean
"our sexual problem"?

186
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:34,347  X1:192 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm comparatively normal
for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

187
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:38,485  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm sorry. My sexual problem.
Okay? My sexual problem!

188
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:42,726  X1:111 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
l never read that. That was Henry James'
sequel to Turn of the Screw?

189
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,325  X1:178 X2:544 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's the influence of television.

190
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:51,170  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
Marshall McLuhan deals with it
in terms of it being a high intensity.

191
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,334  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you understand?
A hot medium.

192
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,642  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
What l wouldn't give for a large sock
with horse manure in it.

193
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:01,514  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you do when you get stuck
on a movie line with a guy like this?

194
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:04,679  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wait. Why can't l give my opinion?
lt's a free country!

195
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:07,246  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
He can.
Do you have to give it so loud?

196
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:09,758  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
Aren't you ashamed
to pontificate like that?

197
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:14,127  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
The funny part is, you don't know
anything about Marshall McLuhan.

198
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:18,760  X1:134 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
l happen to teach a class at Columbia
called "TV, Media and Culture."

199
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:22,636  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think my insights into Mr. McLuhan
have a great deal of validity.

200
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:27,473  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you? That's funny, because l happen
to have Mr. McLuhan right here.

201
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:31,105  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just let me--
Come over here. Tell him.

202
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,172  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:374 Y2:410
l heard what you were saying.

203
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,744  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know nothing of my work.
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

204
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:41,086  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
How you ever got to teach a course
in anything is totally amazing!

205
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:43,786  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:374 Y2:410
lf life were only like this.

206
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:51,397  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:070 Y2:145
June 14, 1940.
The German army occupies Paris.

207
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:55,564  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:070 Y2:145
All over the country,
people are desperate for food.

208
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,234  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
Those guys in the French Resistance
were really brave.

209
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:02,107  X1:152 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
To have to listen
to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

210
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:06,047  X1:173 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know. Sometimes l ask myself
how l'd stand up under torture.

211
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,107  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:374 Y2:410
You? You kidding?

212
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:12,178  X1:099 X2:622 Y1:334 Y2:409
The Gestapo would take away your charge
card, and you'd tell 'em everything.

213
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,281  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:374 Y2:410
That movie makes me feel guilty.

214
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,485  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's supposed to.

215
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:20,559  X1:304 X2:417 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Alvy, l--
- What?

216
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:22,929  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's the matter?

217
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,868  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's not natural.
We're sleeping in a bed together.

218
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:28,871  X1:237 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's been a long time!

219
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:31,407  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's just, l mean--

220
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:34,137  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've got to sing tomorrow night,
so l have to rest my voice.

221
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:37,476  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's always some kind of an excuse.
You used to think l was very sexy.

222
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:40,277  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
When we first started going out,
we had sex constantly.

223
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,978  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
We're probably listed in
The Guiness Book of World Records.

224
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:46,921  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt'll pass. l'm going
through a phase, that's all.

225
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,481  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
You've been married before.
You know how things can get.

226
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,278  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:334 Y2:409
You were very hot
for Allison at first.

227
00:13:56,216 --> 00:14:00,482  X1:120 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know that you're on right
after Chris Brown, in about 20 minutes.

228
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,544  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:334 Y2:409
Excuse me.
When do l go on?

229
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,613  X1:277 X2:445 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who are you?

230
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:07,125  X1:287 X2:434 Y1:374 Y2:410
Alvy Singer.

231
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:09,855  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm the comedian.
- Oh, comedian.

232
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,762  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, you're on next.

233
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,959  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:374 Y2:410
What do you mean "next"?

234
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,161  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're on right after this act.

235
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:19,967  X1:156 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt can't be, because he's a comic.
- Yes.

236
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,475  X1:117 X2:605 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're putting on two comics in a row?
- Why not?

237
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:26,910  X1:152 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l'm sorry. l'm not going to go on
after another comedian.

238
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,349  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's okay.
- No. They're laughing. l'd rather not.

239
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,885  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
Will you relax, please?
They're going to love you.

240
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:37,013  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know. l prefer not to.
Look, they're laughing at him.

241
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,354  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
What are you telling me?
They'll laugh at him a few minutes.

242
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:42,485  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then l've got to get laughs, too.
How much can they laugh?

243
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:45,326  X1:227 X2:495 Y1:334 Y2:409
- They're laughed out.
- Do you feel all right?

244
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:47,525  X1:321 X2:400 Y1:374 Y2:410
Jesus.

245
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:51,537  X1:234 X2:487 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What's your name?
- Allison.

246
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:54,072  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah? Allison what?

247
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,233  X1:298 X2:423 Y1:374 Y2:410
Portchnik.

248
00:14:56,609 --> 00:15:00,340  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Portchnik? That's nice.
- Thank you.

249
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:07,308  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
So, you work for Stevenson
all the time?

250
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:11,483  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
- No. l'm doing my thesis.
- On what?

251
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:14,721  X1:199 X2:523 Y1:334 Y2:409
Political commitment
in 20th-century literature.

252
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:18,161  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're like New York Jewish,
left-wing, intellectual...

253
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,496  X1:118 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
Central Park West, Brandeis University,
socialist summer camps...

254
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:24,731  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
and the father
with the Ben Shahn drawings...

255
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:27,932  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:374 Y2:410
really strike-oriented--

256
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:30,373  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
Stop me before l make
a complete imbecile of myself.

257
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:34,880  X1:112 X2:610 Y1:334 Y2:409
That was wonderful! l love being reduced
to a cultural stereotype.

258
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:38,440  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:334 Y2:409
Right. l'm a bigot,
but for the left.

259
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:44,547  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have to go out there.
Say something encouraging, quickly.

260
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:48,287  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l think you're cute.
- Yeah? Do you?

261
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:50,556  X1:299 X2:422 Y1:374 Y2:410
Go ahead.

262
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:04,308  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know why they would have me
at this kind of rally...

263
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:08,074  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
'cause l'm not essentially
a political comedian.

264
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:12,811  X1:146 X2:576 Y1:374 Y2:410
l interestingly had dated a woman...

265
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:15,979  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
in the Eisenhower administration,
briefly.

266
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,819  X1:240 X2:481 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt was ironic to me...

267
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:22,890  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:374 Y2:410
'cause l was trying to do to her...

268
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:26,090  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
what Eisenhower's been doing
to the country for the last eight years.

269
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:32,330  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm sorry.
l can't go through with this.

270
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:35,863  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't get it off my mind!
lt's obsessing me!

271
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:38,911  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm getting tired of it.
l need your attention.

272
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:43,108  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
But it doesn't make any sense.
He drove past the book depository...

273
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:46,413  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
and the police said conclusively
that it was an exit wound.

274
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:50,855  X1:120 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
So how is it possible for Oswald
to have fired from two angles at once?

275
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:52,982  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt doesn't make sense!

276
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,718  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll tell you this.
He was not marksman enough...

277
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:00,288  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:374 Y2:410
to hit a moving target at that range.

278
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:04,860  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:374 Y2:410
But if there was a second assassin--

279
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:07,497  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
- That's it!
- We've been through this.

280
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:10,133  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
They recovered the shells
from that rifle.

281
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,234  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:374 Y2:410
What are you saying now?

282
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:16,771  X1:098 X2:623 Y1:334 Y2:409
That everybody on the Warren Commission
is in on this conspiracy, right?

283
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,510  X1:302 X2:419 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why not?

284
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:22,748  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Earl Warren?
- Honey, l don't know Earl Warren.

285
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:24,790  X1:256 X2:466 Y1:374 Y2:410
Lyndon Johnson?

286
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:27,223  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!

287
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:31,889  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know the ethics those guys have.
lt's a notch underneath child molester.

288
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:34,398  X1:127 X2:594 Y1:374 Y2:410
Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.

289
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:39,803  X1:117 X2:605 Y1:334 Y2:409
The FBl and the ClA and J. Edgar Hoover,
the oil companies...

290
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:43,205  X1:110 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
the Pentagon, the men's-room attendant
at the White House?

291
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:46,439  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
l would leave out
the men's-room attendant.

292
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:51,882  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're using this conspiracy theory
as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

293
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:55,284  X1:289 X2:432 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, my God!
She's right.

294
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,549  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why did l turn off Allison Portchnik?

295
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:01,582  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
She was beautiful. She was willing.
She was real intelligent.

296
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:04,528  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:374 Y2:410
ls it the old Groucho Marx joke...

297
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:08,556  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
that l don't want to belong to any club
that would have me for a member?

298
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:12,193  X1:249 X2:473 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Alvy, don't panic!
- lt's a mistake...

299
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,205  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:374 Y2:410
to bring a live thing in the house.

300
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:16,264  X1:278 X2:444 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't do that.

301
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:19,869  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
Maybe we should call the police.
Dial 911. lt's the lobster squad.

302
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:22,471  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
They're only baby ones.
For God sakes.

303
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:25,676  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lf they're babies, you pick them up.
- All right! All right!

304
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:28,653  X1:240 X2:482 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Here you go!
- Don't give it to me.

305
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:32,020  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look! One crawled
behind the refrigerator.

306
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:35,925  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt'll turn up in our bed at night.
Get out of here with that thing!

307
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:40,122  X1:239 X2:482 Y1:334 Y2:409
Talk to him.
You speak shellfish.

308
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:43,032  X1:236 X2:485 Y1:374 Y2:410
Hey, put it in the pot.

309
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:46,629  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't. l can't put a live thing
in hot water.

310
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:48,970  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
What d'you think we were going to do,
take him to the movies?

311
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,134  X1:238 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
Good. Oh, thank you.

312
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,202  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
Okay, it's in.
lt's definitely in the pot.

313
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,044  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
Annie, there's a big lobster
behind the refrigerator.

314
00:18:57,116 --> 00:19:00,051  X1:249 X2:473 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't get it out.
This thing's heavy.

315
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,021  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
Maybe if l put a dish of butter sauce
here, it'll run out the other side.

316
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,024  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm going to get my camera.

317
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:08,686  X1:237 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
l think if l could pry--

318
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:12,253  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
We should have gotten steaks, 'cause
they don't have legs and run around.

319
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:19,067  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please.
- You're going to take pictures now?

320
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:22,835  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, it'll be wonderful.
Oh, lovely!

321
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:26,606  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's disgusting.
- One more, please? One more.

322
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:28,112  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
Good!

323
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:31,639  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Here's what l want to know.
Am l your first, big romance?

324
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:38,246  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Who was?
- There was Dennis from high school.

325
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:43,125  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
Local kid who'd meet you in front
of the movie house on Saturday night?

326
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:48,133  X1:128 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You should've seen how l looked then.
- l can imagine. An astronaut's wife.

327
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:51,170  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Then there was Jerry, the actor.
- Look at you.

328
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,171  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're such a clown.

329
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:56,766  X1:127 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l look pretty.
- You always do. But that guy with you!

330
00:19:56,843 --> 00:20:01,371  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Acting is like an exploration
of the soul. lt's very religious.

331
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:04,974  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
Like a kind of
liberating consciousness.

332
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:07,315  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's like a visual poem.

333
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:09,445  X1:188 X2:533 Y1:374 Y2:410
ls he kidding with that crap?

334
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:11,854  X1:304 X2:417 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, right!

335
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:15,382  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
Right. l think l know exactly what
you mean when you say "religious."

336
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:18,191  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You do?
- Come on. l was younger.

337
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:20,198  X1:242 X2:480 Y1:374 Y2:410
That was last year!

338
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:23,235  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's like when l think of dying.
You know how l'd like to die?

339
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:24,735  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
How?

340
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:27,898  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'd like to get torn apart
by wild animals.

341
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:31,740  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
- He was a terrific actor.

342
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:35,144  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's neat looking
and he was emotional.

343
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:37,444  X1:244 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think you like
emotion too much.

344
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:40,349  X1:173 X2:549 Y1:374 Y2:410
Touch my heart with your foot.

345
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:42,250  X1:268 X2:454 Y1:374 Y2:410
l may throw up.

346
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:44,846  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:334 Y2:409
- He was creepy.
- Yeah!

347
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:50,260  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're pretty lucky l came along.
- Oh, really? La-de-dah!

348
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:54,163  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf anyone ever told me
that l'd be taking out a girl...

349
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,292  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
who used expressions
like "la-de-dah"--

350
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:59,600  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's right. You really like
those New York girls.

351
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:03,073  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Not just. Not only.
- l'd say so. You married two of them.

352
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:03,709  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's Henry Drucker.

353
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,734  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's Henry Drucker.

354
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:07,938  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
He has a Chair in History
at Princeton.

355
00:21:08,014 --> 00:21:12,212  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky.
He has a Chair in Philosophy at Cornell.

356
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:14,219  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Two more chairs,
they got a dining room set.

357
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:17,723  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Why are you so hostile?
- l want to watch the Knicks on TV.

358
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,054  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:374 Y2:410
ls that Paul Goodman? No.

359
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:23,220  X1:163 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
Be nice to the host,
because he's publishing my book.

360
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:26,424  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:334 Y2:409
Hi, Doug.
Douglas Wyeth...

361
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:29,161  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
The Foul Rag-and-Bone Shop
of the Heart.

362
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:30,930  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm so tired
of spending evenings...

363
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:33,028  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
making fake insights
with people who work for Dysentery.

364
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:34,538  X1:276 X2:445 Y1:374 Y2:410
Commentary.

365
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:38,600  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
l heard Commentary and Dissent
had merged and formed Dysentery.

366
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:41,738  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
No jokes.
These are friends. Okay?

367
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:45,272  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Cleveland Cavaliers losing
to the New York Knicks.

368
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:49,549  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:334 Y2:409
Here you are.
There's people out there.

369
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:52,420  X1:163 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
Two minutes ago,
the Knicks are ahead 14 points...

370
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:54,982  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:374 Y2:410
and now they're ahead two points.

371
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,923  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:374 Y2:410
Alvy, what is so fascinating...

372
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:03,867  X1:133 X2:588 Y1:334 Y2:409
about a group of pituitary cases
trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?

373
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:06,063  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is fascinating
is that it's physical.

374
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,072  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's one thing about intellectuals:

375
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,769  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
They've proved you can be brilliant
and have no idea what's going on.

376
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:16,679  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
But, on the other hand,
the body doesn't lie as we now know.

377
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:19,575  X1:263 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
Stop acting out.

378
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:22,780  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt'll be great, because all those
Ph.D.s are in there discussing...

379
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:26,723  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
modes of alienation,
and we'll be in here quietly humping.

380
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:31,354  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't. You're using sex
to express hostility.

381
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:36,265  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
"Why do you always reduce my animal
urges to psychoanalytic categories,"...

382
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:39,361  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:374 Y2:410
he said as he removed her brassier.

383
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:45,439  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
There are people out there
from the New Yorker magazine!

384
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:48,537  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
My God!
What would they think?

385
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:58,256  X1:255 X2:467 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Damn siren!
- Don't get upset.

386
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:00,189  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:374 Y2:410
Damn it! l was so close!

387
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,955  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
Last night it was a guy
honking his car horn.

388
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:06,021  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:374 Y2:410
The city can't close down.

389
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:09,625  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
You want them to close the airport
so we can have sex?

390
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:12,364  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm too tense.
l need a Valium.

391
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:15,430  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
My analyst says l should live
in the country and not in New York.

392
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:19,035  X1:112 X2:609 Y1:334 Y2:409
We can't have this discussion all
the time. The country makes me nervous.

393
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:22,979  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
You've got crickets. lt's quiet.
There's no place to walk after dinner.

394
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,075  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's the screens
with the dead moths behind them.

395
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:29,144  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
You got the Manson family, possibly.
You got Dick and Perry.

396
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:34,215  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
Okay! My analyst just thinks l'm too
tense! Where's the goddamn Valium?

397
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,693  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Okay, it's quiet now.
We can get started again.

398
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,526  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:374 Y2:410
l can't! My head is throbbing.

399
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,725  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You got a headache?
- l have a headache!

400
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,668  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Bad?
- Like Oswald in Ghosts.

401
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:47,137  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Jesus.
- Where are you going?

402
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:50,607  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm going to take another in a series
of cold showers.

403
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:53,041  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
Max, my serve is going to send you
to the showers early.

404
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:55,103  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Right. To get back to what
we were discussing.

405
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:58,617  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
The failure of the country to get behind
New York City is anti-Semitism.

406
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:00,584  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
Max, the city is terribly run.

407
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:04,020  X1:179 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm not discussing politics
or economics. This is foreskin.

408
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,186  X1:104 X2:617 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's a convenient out. When some group
disagrees with you, it's anti-Semitism.

409
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,785  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:334 Y2:409
The rest of the country
looks upon New York...

410
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:14,765  X1:117 X2:605 Y1:334 Y2:409
like we're left-wing, communist, Jewish,
homosexual pornographers.

411
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:17,428  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think of us that way sometimes,
and l live here.

412
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:22,031  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
Max, if we lived in California, we could
play outdoors every day in the sun.

413
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:25,271  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sun is bad for you. Everything
our parents said was good is bad.

414
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,938  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
Sun, milk, red meat, college.

415
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,650  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
Egad, here he comes.

416
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:37,686  X1:263 X2:459 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know Alvy?
This is Janet.

417
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:41,351  X1:250 X2:472 Y1:334 Y2:409
- This is Annie Hall.
- This is Alvy.

418
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:45,022  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Who's playing with who here?
- You and me against them?

419
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:47,190  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
- That's not fair.
- l can't play too good.

420
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:48,733  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
l've had four lessons.

421
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,715  X1:325 X2:396 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well...

422
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:15,282  X1:335 X2:387 Y1:374 Y2:410
bye.

423
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:22,065  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You play very well.
- Oh, yeah? So do you!

424
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:25,194  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:374 Y2:410
God, what a dumb thing to say.

425
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:30,140  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
You say "You play well," and right away
l have to say, "You play well."

426
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,370  X1:269 X2:452 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, God, Annie.

427
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:35,572  X1:279 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well. Oh, well!

428
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:38,082  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
La-de-dah.

429
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,019  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:374 Y2:410
You want a lift?

430
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:45,614  X1:270 X2:452 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, why?
You got a car?

431
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:48,489  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
No, l was going to take a cab.

432
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:51,052  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, no. l have a car.

433
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:54,031  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:374 Y2:410
You have a car?

434
00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:58,026  X1:250 X2:471 Y1:374 Y2:410
lf you have a car...

435
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:01,561  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
then why did you say, "Do you have
a car" like you wanted a lift?

436
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:06,637  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
Geez, l don't know.
l wasn't--

437
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:11,749  X1:221 X2:501 Y1:374 Y2:410
l got this VW out there.

438
00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:13,372  X1:285 X2:436 Y1:374 Y2:410
What a jerk.

439
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:16,339  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:374 Y2:410
Would you like a lift?

440
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:20,573  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Sure. Which way are you going?
- Me? Oh, downtown.

441
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,614  X1:255 X2:467 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm going uptown.

442
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,116  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, l'm going uptown, too.

443
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,813  X1:136 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You said you were going downtown.
- Yeah, well--

444
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:31,322  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can go uptown, too.
l live uptown.

445
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,292  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
What the hell? lt would be nice
having company. l hate driving alone.

446
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,763  X1:178 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
How long do you know Janet?
Where do you know her from?

447
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,459  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm in her acting class.
- You're an actress!

448
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,729  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well, l do commercials, sort of.

449
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:47,239  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
You want to watch the road?
You're not from New York, right?

450
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:50,298  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Chippewa Falls.
- Right.

451
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,435  X1:288 X2:433 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Where?
- Wisconsin.

452
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:56,242  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're driving a tad rapidly.
- Don't worry. l'm a very good driver.

453
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:00,584  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You want some gum?
- No, thanks.

454
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:04,145  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Where is it?
- Don't do that. No, no, watch the road.

455
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,054  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll get it.
Concentrate, will ya?

456
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,923  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'll get you a piece.
- Listen. You drive?

457
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:12,089  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do l drive?
No, l got a problem with driving.

458
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,223  X1:302 X2:419 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You do?
- Yeah.

459
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,326  X1:188 X2:533 Y1:334 Y2:409
l got a license,
but l have too much hostility.

460
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,936  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nice car.
You keep it nice.

461
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:24,636  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Can l ask you, is this a sandwich?
- Oh, yeah.

462
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:33,682  X1:165 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
l live over here. Oh, my God, look!
There's a parking space.

463
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:41,860  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's okay,
we can walk to the curb from here.

464
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,725  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
You want your tennis stuff?
You want your gear?

465
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:48,699  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah. That's good. Thanks.
Thanks a lot. Well.

466
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,201  X1:331 X2:390 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well.

467
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,072  X1:288 X2:434 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

468
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,973  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're a wonderful tennis player...

469
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,568  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
and you're the worst driver
l've ever seen in my life.

470
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:03,411  X1:154 X2:568 Y1:374 Y2:410
Anyplace. Europe. Anyplace. Asia.

471
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,848  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l love what you're wearing.
- You do? Yeah.

472
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:10,287  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:374 Y2:410
This tie is a present from Grammy Hall.

473
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,847  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who? Grammy Hall?

474
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,620  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah, my grammy.

475
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,857  X1:099 X2:622 Y1:334 Y2:409
What did you do, grow up in a
Norman Rockwell painting? Your grammy?

476
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,230  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's pretty silly, isn't it?
- My grammy never gave gifts.

477
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:25,236  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
She was too busy getting raped
by Cossacks.

478
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,534  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well, thank you again.

479
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,164  X1:305 X2:417 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, yeah.

480
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:33,109  X1:120 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
Listen. You want to come upstairs
and have a glass of wine or something?

481
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,637  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l mean you don't have to.
You're probably late and everything.

482
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,048  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, that would be fine.
l wouldn't mind. Sure.

483
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:43,748  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
l got time. l got nothing
until my analyst appointment.

484
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:45,882  X1:237 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
You see an analyst?

485
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:49,689  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Just for 15 years.
- 15 years?

486
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:52,287  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm going to give him one more year,
and then l'm going to Lourdes.

487
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:55,356  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:374 Y2:410
15? Nah, come on! Yeah? Really?

488
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:58,901  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sylvia Plath. lnteresting poetess
whose tragic suicide...

489
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,771  X1:163 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
was misinterpreted as romantic
by the college-girl mentality.

490
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:07,472  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
Right. l don't know.
l mean, some of her poems seem neat.

491
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:10,879  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:374 Y2:410
Neat? l hate to tell you this is 1975.

492
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,350  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
"Neat" went out
at the turn of the century.

493
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,717  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who are those photos on the wall?

494
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,484  X1:282 X2:439 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, you see...

495
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:22,653  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
that's my dad, that's Father,
and that's my brother, Duane.

496
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:25,629  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah, right.
And over there's Grammy Hall.

497
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:28,633  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:334 Y2:409
- And that's Sadie.
- Who's Sadie?

498
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:34,401  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, Sadie met Grammy
through Grammy's brother, George.

499
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,805  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
George was real sweet.
He had that thing.

500
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:42,314  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is that thing where you fall asleep
in the middle of a sentence?

501
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,315  X1:279 X2:443 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Narcolepsy.
- Right.

502
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:49,184  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
So anyway, George went to the union
to get his free turkey...

503
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:52,918  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
because the union always gave George
this free turkey at Christmastime...

504
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:56,519  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
because he was shell-shocked
in the first World War.

505
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:00,588  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:374 Y2:410
Anyway, so George is standing in line...

506
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,066  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:374 Y2:410
getting his free turkey...

507
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:08,198  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
but the thing is he falls asleep,
and he never wakes up.

508
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:10,970  X1:281 X2:440 Y1:374 Y2:410
So he's dead.

509
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,341  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:374 Y2:410
He's dead. Yeah.

510
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,936  X1:305 X2:416 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, dear.

511
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:17,778  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, terrible, huh?
Wouldn't you say?

512
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,579  X1:278 X2:444 Y1:374 Y2:410
Pretty awful.

513
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:22,985  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a great story, though.
lt really made my day.

514
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,149  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think l should get out of here,
'cause l think l'm imposing.

515
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:29,353  X1:261 X2:461 Y1:374 Y2:410
Really? Maybe--

516
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:33,728  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You don't have to.
- But l'm all perspired and everything.

517
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,393  X1:136 X2:586 Y1:374 Y2:410
Didn't you take a shower at the club?

518
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:39,028  X1:228 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, no. l never shower
in a public place.

519
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,537  X1:302 X2:419 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why not?

520
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:44,736  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't like to get naked in front
of another man.

521
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,243  X1:329 X2:392 Y1:374 Y2:410
l see.

522
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:49,770  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't like to show my body
to a man of my gender.

523
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,477  X1:108 X2:614 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l see, l guess.
- You never know what's going to happen.

524
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:55,884  X1:260 X2:461 Y1:334 Y2:409
- 15 years, huh?
- 15 years, yeah.

525
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:58,022  X1:298 X2:424 Y1:374 Y2:410
God bless.

526
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,728  X1:292 X2:429 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well! Well--

527
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,929  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're what Grammy Hall
would call "a real Jew."

528
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,003  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thank you.

529
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:17,438  X1:159 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
She hates Jews.
She thinks they just make money.

530
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:20,603  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
But she's the one, is she ever.
l'm telling you.

531
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,145  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
So, did you do
those photographs in there?

532
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:33,348  X1:148 X2:574 Y1:070 Y2:457
l dabble? Listen to me. What a jerk.
Yeah, l sort of dabble around,
you know.

533
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:37,656  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:070 Y2:457
You are a great-looking girl.
They're wonderful.
They have a quality.

534
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,928  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:070 Y2:457
He probably thinks l'm a yo-yo.
Well, l would like to take
a serious photography course.

535
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,969  X1:136 X2:585 Y1:374 Y2:410
Photography's interesting because...

536
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:48,370  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:070 Y2:457
l wonder what she looks like naked.
it's a new art form. A set of aesthetic
criteria have not emerged yet.

537
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,240  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:070 Y2:457
l'm not smart enough for him.
Hang in there.
You mean whether
it's a good photo or not?

538
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:57,271  X1:146 X2:576 Y1:070 Y2:457
l don't know what l'm saying.
She senses l'm shallow.
The medium enters in as a condition
of the art form itself.

539
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:02,320  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:070 Y2:457
God, l hope he doesn't turn out
to be a schmuck like the others.
Well, to me-- l mean--
lt's all instinctive.

540
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:07,325  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
l just try to feel it, to get a sense
of it and not think about it so much.

541
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:12,922  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:070 Y2:457
Christ, l sound like FM radio. Relax.
Still, you need aesthetic guidelines
to put it in social perspective.

542
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,759  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know. l mean,
l guess you must be sort of late.

543
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:22,535  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know, l've got to get there
and begin whining soon.

544
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,599  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are you busy Friday night?

545
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:27,874  X1:291 X2:430 Y1:374 Y2:410
Me? Oh, no.

546
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:31,178  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, l'm sorry, l have something.
What about Saturday night?

547
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,286  X1:267 X2:455 Y1:374 Y2:410
Nothing. No, no.

548
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:38,585  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're very popular, l can see.

549
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,591  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l know.
- You have plague?

550
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,184  X1:238 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
l meet a lot of jerks.

551
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,253  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:374 Y2:410
l meet a lot of jerks, too.

552
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:48,459  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm thinking about
getting some cats.

553
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:52,265  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wait a second! No, no!
Oh, shoot!

554
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:56,798  X1:163 X2:558 Y1:374 Y2:410
Saturday night, l'm going to sing.

555
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,366  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're going to sing? You sing?
No kidding!

556
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:02,437  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:334 Y2:409
- This is my first time.
- Really? Where?

557
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,778  X1:269 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'd like to come.

558
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,580  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm interested.
- No, no. l'm just a--

559
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:11,680  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm auditioning at this club.
lt's my first time.

560
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,225  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's okay, 'cause l know exactly
what that's like.

561
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:17,126  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're going to like nightclubs.
They're really a lot of fun.

562
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,094  X1:268 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt had to be you

563
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:34,874  X1:268 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt had to be you

564
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:41,318  X1:247 X2:475 Y1:334 Y2:409
l wandered around
And finally found

565
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:47,883  X1:242 X2:480 Y1:374 Y2:410
This somebody who

566
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:54,523  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:374 Y2:410
Could make me be true

567
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,765  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:374 Y2:410
Could make me be blue

568
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:04,834  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:374 Y2:410
And even be glad

569
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,470  X1:274 X2:447 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just to be sad

570
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:14,650  X1:269 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thinking of you

571
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:18,050  X1:189 X2:533 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was awful! l'm so ashamed!
l can't sing.

572
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:20,216  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:374 Y2:410
So the audience was a tad restless.

573
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:23,591  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean, "a tad restless"?
My God, they hated me!

574
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:26,062  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, they didn't.
You have a wonderful voice.

575
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,122  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm going to quit.
- l'm not going to let you.

576
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,691  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You have a great voice.
- Do you think so, really?

577
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:35,035  X1:154 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Yeah! lt's terrific.
- l never even took a lesson either.

578
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:38,565  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Listen, give me a kiss.
- Really?

579
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:41,306  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why not? Because we're just going
to go home later.

580
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,871  X1:148 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's going to be all that tension.
We've never kissed before.

581
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,042  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll never know when
to make the right move.

582
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:48,882  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
We'll kiss now and get it over with,
and then we'll go eat. Okay?

583
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,320  X1:189 X2:533 Y1:374 Y2:410
We'll digest our food better.

584
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:56,265  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:374 Y2:410
Okay? Now we can digest our food.

585
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,560  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
Corned beef, please.

586
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:01,762  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm having pastrami on white bread...

587
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,807  X1:116 X2:605 Y1:374 Y2:410
with mayonnaise, tomatoes and lettuce.

588
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,670  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
So, your second wife left you.

589
00:35:10,746 --> 00:35:13,408  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:374 Y2:410
Were you depressed about that?

590
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:17,112  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins
couldn't cure.

591
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:21,054  X1:210 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Your first wife, Allison.
- She was nice.

592
00:35:21,123 --> 00:35:23,614  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:334 Y2:409
That was my fault.
l was too crazy.

593
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,193  X1:255 X2:466 Y1:334 Y2:409
That was so nice!
That was nice.

594
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:35,135  X1:192 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
As Balzac said,
"There goes another novel."

595
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,968  X1:261 X2:461 Y1:374 Y2:410
You were great.

596
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,600  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

597
00:35:40,676 --> 00:35:44,840  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Yeah, l'm wrecked.
- You're wrecked.

598
00:35:44,914 --> 00:35:49,442  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
l mean it.
l'll never play the piano again.

599
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,647  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was, l don't know.
You really thought it was good?

600
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:58,183  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
Good? Yes. No, that was the most fun
l've had without laughing.

601
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:00,126  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:374 Y2:410
Here, you want some?

602
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:05,691  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l don't use
any major hallucinogenics.

603
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:10,228  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
l took a puff about five years ago
at a party...

604
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:13,207  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
and tried to take my pants off
over my head.

605
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:21,077  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't do it very often.
lt just sort of relaxes me.

606
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:26,478  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You won't believe this, but--
- What?

607
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:32,794  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm going to buy you these books...

608
00:36:32,862 --> 00:36:36,161  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
because l think you should read them
instead of that cat book.

609
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:38,996  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's pretty serious stuff.

610
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:41,502  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm obsessed with death, l think.

611
00:36:41,571 --> 00:36:44,597  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a big subject with me.
l have a pessimistic view of life.

612
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:47,040  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
You should know this about me
if we're going to go out.

613
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:50,306  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
l feel that life is divided up
into the horrible and the miserable.

614
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:52,370  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
Those are the two categories.

615
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:57,215  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
The horrible would be like terminal
cases and blind people, cripples.

616
00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:59,754  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know how they get through life.
lt's amazing to me.

617
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:02,620  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:374 Y2:410
And the miserable is everyone else.

618
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:05,126  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
So when you go through life,
be thankful that you're miserable.

619
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:07,890  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're very lucky to be miserable.

620
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:14,300  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look at that guy.
There's Mr. Miami Beach in the pink.

621
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,134  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's just come back
from the gin rummy finals.

622
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:19,037  X1:266 X2:456 Y1:374 Y2:410
He placed third.

623
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:22,134  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look at these guys. That's hilarious.
They're back from Fire lsland.

624
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:25,078  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
They're sort of giving it
a chance romantically.

625
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:28,048  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
- ltalian, right?
- Him? He's the Mafia.

626
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:31,450  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
Linen supply business
or cement and contracting.

627
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,115  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, gee,
mess up my moustache wax.

628
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:37,989  X1:108 X2:613 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's the winner of the Truman Capote
look-alike contest.

629
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:42,861  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
You are unbelievably sexy.
Yes, you are.

630
00:37:42,932 --> 00:37:46,800  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what you are?
You're polymorphously perverse.

631
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:49,394  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
What does that mean?
l don't know what that is.

632
00:37:49,472 --> 00:37:52,407  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're exceptional in bed...

633
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:55,467  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
because you get pleasure in every part
of your body when l touch it.

634
00:37:55,544 --> 00:37:59,378  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
Like the tip of your nose, and if
l stroke your teeth or your knee caps...

635
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,609  X1:206 X2:515 Y1:374 Y2:410
you certainly get excited.

636
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:06,018  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what?
l like you, l really do.

637
00:38:06,088 --> 00:38:09,023  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
But do you love me?
That's the key question.

638
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:11,423  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know you've only known me
a short while.

639
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:15,453  X1:228 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think that's sort of--
Yeah, yeah.

640
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:17,465  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
Do you love me?

641
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:22,994  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
Love is too weak a word for what--
l "lurve" you.

642
00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:27,372  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
l "loave" you.
l "luff" you, with two "f"s.

643
00:38:27,443 --> 00:38:29,604  X1:240 X2:482 Y1:334 Y2:409
Of course l do.
Don't you think l do?

644
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,772  X1:285 X2:436 Y1:374 Y2:410
l don't know.

645
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:36,516  X1:112 X2:609 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean? You're not going
to give up your own apartment, are you?

646
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:38,519  X1:288 X2:434 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Of course.
- But why?

647
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:40,851  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm moving in with you, that's why.

648
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:43,983  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
- But you have a nice apartment.
- l have a tiny apartment.

649
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,086  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l know it's small.
- And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.

650
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:52,066  X1:126 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
Granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs.
You say that like it's a negative.

651
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:54,329  X1:295 X2:427 Y1:374 Y2:410
Bugs are--

652
00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:58,271  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Entomology is a rapidly growing field.
- You don't want me to live with you.

653
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,299  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l don't? Whose idea was it?
- Mine.

654
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:04,710  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt was yours, actually.

655
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,112  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:374 Y2:410
But l approved it immediately.

656
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:09,117  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
You think l talked you
into something.

657
00:39:09,185 --> 00:39:13,747  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
No. We live together,
we sleep together, we eat together.

658
00:39:13,823 --> 00:39:16,121  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Jesus, you don't want it to be
like we're married, do you?

659
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:20,151  X1:112 X2:609 Y1:334 Y2:409
- How is it any different?
- Because you keep your own apartment.

660
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:22,754  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's there. We don't have to go to it,
deal with it...

661
00:39:22,832 --> 00:39:27,929  X1:132 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
but it's like a free-floating life raft
that we know that we're not married.

662
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:30,494  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
That little apartment
is $400 a month, Alvy.

663
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:33,701  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
- That place is $400 a month?
- Yes, it is.

664
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:36,870  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's got bad plumbing and bugs.
Jesus.

665
00:39:36,946 --> 00:39:40,939  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
My accountant will write it off
as a tax deduction. l'll pay for it.

666
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:43,644  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
You don't think l'm smart enough
to be serious about.

667
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,380  X1:247 X2:475 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't be ridiculous.

668
00:39:45,454 --> 00:39:49,720  X1:117 X2:605 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then why are you always pushing me
to take college courses like l was dumb?

669
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:51,953  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:374 Y2:410
Adult education is a wonderful thing!

670
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:55,292  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
You meet a lot of interesting
professors. lt's stimulating.

671
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:12,210  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
Does this sound like a good course:
"Modern American Poetry"?

672
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:15,250  X1:278 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
Or, let's see...

673
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:19,413  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
maybe l should take
"lntroduction to the Novel."

674
00:40:19,488 --> 00:40:22,116  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just don't take any course
where they make you read Beowulf.

675
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:24,250  X1:318 X2:403 Y1:374 Y2:410
What?

676
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:28,729  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you think? Should we go
to that party in South Hampton?

677
00:40:28,798 --> 00:40:32,256  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, don't be silly.
What do we need other people for?

678
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:37,203  X1:123 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
We should just turn out the lights
and play hide the "salam" or something.

679
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:40,242  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, l'm going to get a cigarette,
okay?

680
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:45,542  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
Grass, right? The illusion that it makes
a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

681
00:40:45,614 --> 00:40:48,777  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Have you ever made love high?
- Me? No.

682
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:52,514  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf l have grass or alcohol,
l get unbearably wonderful.

683
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:55,580  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
l get too wonderful for words.

684
00:40:55,658 --> 00:40:59,594  X1:137 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know why you have to get high
every time we make love.

685
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:01,527  X1:278 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt relaxes me.

686
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:04,157  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
You have to be artificially relaxed
before we can go to bed?

687
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:06,394  X1:162 X2:560 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's the difference, anyway?

688
00:41:06,468 --> 00:41:09,096  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll give you a shot of Sodium
Pentothal. You can sleep through it.

689
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:12,538  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look who's talking! You've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

690
00:41:12,608 --> 00:41:16,169  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
You should smoke some of this.
You'd be off the couch in no time.

691
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:18,475  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Come on, you don't need that.
- What are you doing?

692
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:22,244  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
- No, Alvy, please?
- You can live without it once.

693
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,313  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:374 Y2:410
Wait, l got a great idea.

694
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:32,254  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
Hang in there for a second.
l got a little erotic artifact...

695
00:41:32,328 --> 00:41:36,424  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
that l brought up from the city,
which l think is going to be perfect.

696
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:40,332  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
There. Create a little
old New Orleans essence.

697
00:41:40,402 --> 00:41:43,599  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:374 Y2:410
Now we can go about our business...

698
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:46,573  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
and even develop photographs
if we want to.

699
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:56,513  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
- ls something wrong?
- No, why?

700
00:41:56,585 --> 00:41:59,520  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know.
lt's like you're removed.

701
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:01,556  X1:290 X2:431 Y1:374 Y2:410
No, l'm fine.

702
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:03,615  X1:314 X2:407 Y1:374 Y2:410
Really?

703
00:42:03,692 --> 00:42:06,320  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know.
You seem sort of distant.

704
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:08,454  X1:212 X2:510 Y1:374 Y2:410
Let's just do it, all right?

705
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,988  X1:163 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
Was it my imagination or are you
just going through the motions?

706
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:14,365  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, do you remember
where l put my drawing pad?

707
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,405  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because while you two are doing that,
l'm going to do some drawing.

708
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:19,737  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's what l call removed!

709
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:22,800  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:374 Y2:410
You have my body.

710
00:42:22,878 --> 00:42:25,176  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:374 Y2:410
But l want the whole thing!

711
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:27,181  X1:283 X2:438 Y1:374 Y2:410
l need grass.

712
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:30,184  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt ruins it for me if you have grass.

713
00:42:30,252 --> 00:42:33,585  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm like a comedian, so if l get a laugh
from a person who's high...

714
00:42:33,656 --> 00:42:36,489  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
it doesn't count,
'cause they're always laughing.

715
00:42:36,558 --> 00:42:38,492  X1:210 X2:511 Y1:374 Y2:410
Were you always funny?

716
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,222  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
ls this an interview?
We're supposed to be making love.

717
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:44,662  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
This guy is naturally funny.
l think he can write for you.

718
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:47,600  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid,
he tells me you're really good.

719
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:50,070  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Let me explain how l work.
You can tell off the bat...

720
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:53,040  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
that l don't look like a funny guy
like some of the guys.

721
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:55,474  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know they're going to tell you their
stories, you're going to fall down.

722
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:58,308  X1:120 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
But l gotta be really talented.
Material's got to be sensational for me.

723
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,316  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
l work-- l'm kind of classy.
Know what l mean?

724
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:04,716  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Let me explain.
l'll open with an opening song.

725
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:06,778  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:374 Y2:410
The music will start.

726
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:09,653  X1:159 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
l walk out.
Place looks wonderful from here

727
00:43:09,725 --> 00:43:12,455  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:374 Y2:410
You folks look wonderful from here

728
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:15,122  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
And seeing you there
With a smile on your face

729
00:43:15,197 --> 00:43:17,563  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
Makes me shout
This must be the place

730
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:20,727  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
l stop, and then l open with some jokes.
That's where l need you.

731
00:43:20,803 --> 00:43:24,534  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll say, "l just got back from Canada.
They speak a lot of French.

732
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:28,599  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
The only word to know is 'John Dark.' lt
means the light's out in the bathroom.

733
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:33,046  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l met a big lumberjack."
- Jesus, this guy's pathetic.

734
00:43:33,115 --> 00:43:36,778  X1:191 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look at him mincing around.
Boy, thinks he's real cute.

735
00:43:36,852 --> 00:43:39,150  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:374 Y2:410
You want to throw up.

736
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:42,213  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf only l had the nerve
to do my own jokes.

737
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:47,224  X1:119 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know how much longer l can keep
this smile frozen on my face.

738
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:49,264  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm in the wrong business.
l know it.

739
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:53,233  X1:281 X2:441 Y1:374 Y2:410
"But, cherie...

740
00:43:53,302 --> 00:43:55,964  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
what will l do with this, eh?"

741
00:43:56,038 --> 00:44:00,031  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
He says, "Oh, Marie,
sometime you make me so mad!"

742
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:02,134  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
They scream at that.
Write me something like that, will you?

743
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:04,904  X1:210 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
Kind of a French number.
Can you do it?

744
00:44:11,144 --> 00:44:13,237  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:334 Y2:409
Where am l?
l have to reorient myself.

745
00:44:13,313 --> 00:44:15,304  X1:235 X2:487 Y1:334 Y2:409
This is the University
of Wisconsin, right?

746
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:20,045  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because l'm always tense
when l'm playing a college.

747
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,520  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have a bad history with colleges.
l went to New York University.

748
00:44:22,622 --> 00:44:26,581  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
And l was thrown out of NYU
my freshman year...

749
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:29,958  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:374 Y2:410
for cheating on my metaphysics final.

750
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:34,363  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
l looked within the soul
of the boy sitting next to me.

751
00:44:34,434 --> 00:44:38,632  X1:115 X2:607 Y1:334 Y2:409
My mother, an emotionally high-strung
woman, locked herself in the bathroom...

752
00:44:38,705 --> 00:44:41,799  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
and took an overdose
of mah-jongg tiles.

753
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:48,879  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was depressed at that time.
l was in analysis.

754
00:44:48,948 --> 00:44:52,748  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was suicidal, as a matter of fact,
and would have killed myself...

755
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:55,481  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:334 Y2:409
but l was in analysis
with a strict Freudian.

756
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:59,218  X1:132 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
And if you kill yourself, they make you
pay for the sessions you miss.

757
00:45:03,062 --> 00:45:07,158  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, you were just great.
l'm not kidding.

758
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:10,031  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
College audiences are wonderful.

759
00:45:10,103 --> 00:45:13,231  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what? l think l'm starting
to get more of the references, too.

760
00:45:13,306 --> 00:45:17,436  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you? The 12:00 show
is completely different than the 9:00.

761
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:21,776  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm looking forward to tomorrow. lt'll
be nice. You'll meet Mother and Father.

762
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:23,975  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:374 Y2:410
They'll hate me immediately.

763
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:28,520  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l don't think they're going
to hate you at all. Contrary.

764
00:45:28,588 --> 00:45:33,048  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's Easter. We'll sit down and eat.
l think they'll really like you.

765
00:45:42,235 --> 00:45:43,964  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's a nice ham this year, Mom.

766
00:45:46,206 --> 00:45:49,198  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:374 Y2:410
Grammy always does such a good job.

767
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:51,072  X1:281 X2:441 Y1:374 Y2:410
Great sauce.

768
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:53,612  X1:250 X2:472 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt is.
lt's dynamite ham.

769
00:45:59,185 --> 00:46:02,086  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
We went to the swap meet.

770
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:05,249  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
Annie, Gram and l.
Got some nice picture frames.

771
00:46:05,325 --> 00:46:08,817  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:374 Y2:410
We really had a good time.

772
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:13,264  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
Ann tells us you've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

773
00:46:14,434 --> 00:46:16,425  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yes. l'm making excellent progress.

774
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:19,801  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
Soon, when l lie down on his couch,
l won't have to wear the lobster bib.

775
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:25,738  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Duane and l went to the boat basin.
- We caulked hulls all day.

776
00:46:25,812 --> 00:46:28,804  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:374 Y2:410
And Randolph Hunt was drunk as usual.

777
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:33,409  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
That Randolph Hunt!
You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.

778
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:36,250  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
- He was in the choir with you.
- Oh, yes.

779
00:46:36,322 --> 00:46:38,847  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:374 Y2:410
l can't believe this family.

780
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:41,792  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
Annie's mother is really beautiful.

781
00:46:41,861 --> 00:46:45,558  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
And they're talking swap meets
and boat basins.

782
00:46:45,632 --> 00:46:50,399  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
The old lady at the end of the table
is a classic Jew-hater.

783
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:55,100  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
They really look American, healthy,
like they never get sick or anything.

784
00:46:55,174 --> 00:46:58,371  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nothing like my family.
The two are like oil and water.

785
00:46:58,745 --> 00:47:01,646  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
Ah, let him drop dead.
Who needs his business?

786
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:07,346  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
- His wife has diabetes.
- Diabetes? ls that an excuse?

787
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,823  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
The man is 50 years old
and doesn't have a substantial job.

788
00:47:11,891 --> 00:47:13,620  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:334 Y2:409
ls that a reason to steal
from your partner?

789
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:16,161  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:334 Y2:409
You don't know what
you're talking about.

790
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:17,890  X1:288 X2:433 Y1:374 Y2:410
Defend him!

791
00:47:17,964 --> 00:47:20,626  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:374 Y2:410
Pass the brisket.

792
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,260  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
Mo Moskowitz.
He had a coronary.

793
00:47:23,336 --> 00:47:25,270  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:374 Y2:410
You don't say!

794
00:47:26,272 --> 00:47:28,502  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
How do you plan to spend the holidays,
Mrs. Singer?

795
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:30,633  X1:299 X2:423 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We fast.
- Fast?

796
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:33,975  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
No food.
You know, to atone for our sins.

797
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:36,140  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
What sins?
l don't understand.

798
00:47:36,215 --> 00:47:38,080  X1:272 X2:449 Y1:374 Y2:410
Neither do we.

799
00:47:40,153 --> 00:47:42,917  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:374 Y2:410
Hi, Duane. How's it going?

800
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:47,016  X1:219 X2:503 Y1:334 Y2:409
- This is my room.
- Oh, yeah? lt's terrific.

801
00:47:47,093 --> 00:47:49,084  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:374 Y2:410
Can l confess something?

802
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:57,832  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
l tell you this, because, as an artist,
l think you'll understand.

803
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:03,799  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
Sometimes when l'm driving...

804
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:05,844  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
on the road at night...

805
00:48:05,912 --> 00:48:09,370  X1:210 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
l see two headlights
coming toward me, fast.

806
00:48:09,449 --> 00:48:11,849  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have this impulse
to turn the wheel quickly...

807
00:48:11,918 --> 00:48:14,182  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:374 Y2:410
head-on into the oncoming car.

808
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:17,516  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
l can anticipate the explosion.

809
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:21,754  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
The sound of shattering glass.

810
00:48:21,828 --> 00:48:26,231  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
The flames rising out
of the flowing gasoline.

811
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:30,368  X1:324 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
Right.

812
00:48:31,738 --> 00:48:37,472  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have to go now, Duane, because
l'm due back on the planet Earth.

813
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:39,477  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't let it be so long now.

814
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:43,174  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Look up Uncle Billy, promise.
- He is adorable.

815
00:48:43,249 --> 00:48:45,717  X1:132 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You'll take them to the airport now?
- No. Duane can.

816
00:48:45,785 --> 00:48:48,549  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l haven't finished my drink.
- Yes, Duane is. l'll be right--

817
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:10,538  X1:256 X2:466 Y1:334 Y2:409
You followed me.
l can't believe it!

818
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,578  X1:244 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l didn't follow you.
- You followed me!

819
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:16,172  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because l was walking a block behind
staring at you? That's not following.

820
00:49:16,249 --> 00:49:19,912  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What's your definition of "following"?
- Following is different. l was spying.

821
00:49:19,986 --> 00:49:21,476  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you realize
how paranoid you are?

822
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:24,614  X1:120 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
Paranoid? l'm looking at you, and you've
got your arms around another guy.

823
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,681  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:374 Y2:410
That is the worst kind of paranoid!

824
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:30,126  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
l didn't start out spying. l thought l'd
surprise you, pick you up after school.

825
00:49:30,196 --> 00:49:34,064  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
You wanted to keep the relationship
flexible, remember? lt's your phrase.

826
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:36,192  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're having an affair
with your college professor!

827
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:40,933  X1:112 X2:610 Y1:334 Y2:409
That jerk that teaches that crap course,
"Contemporary Crisis in Western Man."

828
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:43,771  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
"Existential Motifs in Russian
Literature." You're really close.

829
00:49:43,843 --> 00:49:46,107  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's the difference?
lt's all mental masturbation.

830
00:49:46,179 --> 00:49:48,807  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Now we're getting to a subject
you know something about.

831
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:51,850  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't knock masturbation.
lt's sex with someone l love.

832
00:49:51,918 --> 00:49:56,651  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
We're not having an affair. He's
married. He happens to think l'm neat.

833
00:49:56,722 --> 00:49:59,816  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you 12 years old? That's one
of your Chippewa Falls expressions.

834
00:49:59,892 --> 00:50:01,655  X1:287 X2:435 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who cares?

835
00:50:01,727 --> 00:50:05,390  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
Next he'll find you're keen and peachy.
Then he'll have his hand on your ass.

836
00:50:05,465 --> 00:50:08,491  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
You've had hostility towards David
ever since l mentioned him.

837
00:50:08,568 --> 00:50:10,729  X1:178 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You call your teacher David?
- lt's his name.

838
00:50:10,803 --> 00:50:14,398  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a Biblical name, right?
Does he call you Bathsheba?

839
00:50:14,474 --> 00:50:18,638  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, you're the one who never wanted
to make a real commitment.

840
00:50:18,711 --> 00:50:21,771  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
You don't think l'm smart enough.
We had that argument last month...

841
00:50:21,848 --> 00:50:24,578  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
or don't you remember that day?

842
00:50:26,052 --> 00:50:28,782  X1:277 X2:445 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm home!
- How'd it go?

843
00:50:28,855 --> 00:50:31,824  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was really weird,
but she's a very nice woman.

844
00:50:31,891 --> 00:50:35,554  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
l didn't have to lie on the couch.
She had me sitting up.

845
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:39,530  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
l told her about the family
and my feelings towards men...

846
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,760  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:374 Y2:410
and my relationship with my brother.

847
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:44,564  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then she mentioned penis envy.
Do you know about that?

848
00:50:44,637 --> 00:50:48,937  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm one of the few males
who suffers from that. Go on.

849
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:53,536  X1:124 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
She said l was guilty about my impulses
towards marriage and children.

850
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:58,209  X1:107 X2:614 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then, l remembered, when l was a kid, l
accidentally saw my parents making love.

851
00:50:58,284 --> 00:51:00,809  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
All this happened the first hour?
That's amazing.

852
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:04,516  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've been going for 15 years.
l don't have nothing like that.

853
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,854  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:334 Y2:409
l told her my dream,
and then l cried.

854
00:51:06,926 --> 00:51:10,453  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
You cried. l've never once cried.
That's fantastic to me.

855
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,691  X1:267 X2:455 Y1:334 Y2:409
l whine.
l sit and l whine.

856
00:51:12,765 --> 00:51:16,633  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
ln my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding
this pillow across my face...

857
00:51:16,702 --> 00:51:18,636  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:374 Y2:410
and l can't breathe.

858
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:20,934  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:374 Y2:410
He's strangling me.

859
00:51:21,007 --> 00:51:23,908  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sure, because he's a singer,
and you're a singer. lt's perfect.

860
00:51:23,976 --> 00:51:26,945  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're trying to suffocate yourself.
lt makes perfect sense.

861
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:29,345  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's a perfect analytic insight.

862
00:51:29,415 --> 00:51:33,010  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:374 Y2:410
She said your name was Alvy Singer.

863
00:51:33,085 --> 00:51:35,076  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What do you mean, me?
- Yeah, you.

864
00:51:35,154 --> 00:51:38,351  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because in the dream,
l break Sinatra's glasses.

865
00:51:38,424 --> 00:51:43,123  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
You never said Sinatra had glasses.
Are you saying l'm suffocating you?

866
00:51:43,195 --> 00:51:46,494  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
God, l did this really terrible thing
to him...

867
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:51,196  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
because then when he sang,
it was in this real high-pitch voice.

868
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,967  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What'd the doctor say?
- l should come five times a week.

869
00:51:55,041 --> 00:52:00,343  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think l mind analysis at all.
The question is, will it change my wife?

870
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:03,075  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Will it change your wife?
- Will it change my life?

871
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:06,641  X1:235 X2:487 Y1:334 Y2:409
- But you said "wife."
- No, l said "life."

872
00:52:06,686 --> 00:52:08,711  X1:236 X2:486 Y1:334 Y2:409
- No, you said "wife."
- "Life!" l said "life."

873
00:52:08,788 --> 00:52:12,554  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
She said "wife." You heard that,
because you were there. l'm not crazy.

874
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:16,527  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then l told her l didn't think
you'd ever take me seriously...

875
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:19,030  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:334 Y2:409
because you don't think
l'm smart enough.

876
00:52:19,098 --> 00:52:23,262  X1:118 X2:604 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why do you bring that up? Because l
encourage you to take adult education?

877
00:52:23,336 --> 00:52:26,931  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a wonderful thing. You meet
wonderful, interesting professors.

878
00:52:27,073 --> 00:52:31,009  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
Adult education is junk. The professors
are phony. How can you do it?

879
00:52:31,077 --> 00:52:33,944  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't care what you say about David.
He's a fine teacher.

880
00:52:34,013 --> 00:52:38,780  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
And why are you following me around?
We should call this relationship quits.

881
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:41,945  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's fine. That's great.
l don't know what l did wrong.

882
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:45,855  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
Somewhere she cooled off to me.
ls it something that l did?

883
00:52:45,925 --> 00:52:49,383  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's never something you do.
That's how people are. Love fades.

884
00:52:49,462 --> 00:52:52,431  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
Love fades.
God, that's a depressing thought.

885
00:52:52,498 --> 00:52:54,762  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have to ask you a question.
Don't go any further.

886
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:58,326  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
With your wife, in bed, does she need
some kind of artificial stimulation...

887
00:52:58,404 --> 00:53:00,565  X1:265 X2:456 Y1:374 Y2:410
like marijuana?

888
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,268  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
We use a large vibrating egg.

889
00:53:03,342 --> 00:53:05,207  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:374 Y2:410
A large vibrating egg.

890
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:09,304  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
l ask a psychopath,
l get that kind of answer. Jesus!

891
00:53:09,382 --> 00:53:12,408  X1:159 X2:563 Y1:374 Y2:410
You look like a very happy couple.

892
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:14,715  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Are you?
- Yeah.

893
00:53:14,787 --> 00:53:17,255  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
How do you account for it?

894
00:53:17,323 --> 00:53:21,259  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm very shallow and empty,
and l have no ideas...

895
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:23,557  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
and nothing interesting to say.

896
00:53:23,629 --> 00:53:26,928  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm exactly the same way.
- l see.

897
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,991  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's interesting. So you've
managed to work out something?

898
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:31,502  X1:324 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
Right.

899
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,368  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thanks for talking to me.

900
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,399  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
Even as a kid, l went for the wrong
women. l think that's my problem.

901
00:53:38,477 --> 00:53:40,638  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
When my mother took me
to see Snow White...

902
00:53:40,713 --> 00:53:45,173  X1:132 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
everyone fell in love with Snow White,
and l fell for the wicked queen.

903
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:48,582  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We never have any fun anymore.
- How can you say that?

904
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:51,179  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why not? You're always
leaning on me to improve myself.

905
00:53:51,257 --> 00:53:53,623  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're upset. You must be
getting your period.

906
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:58,392  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't get a period. l'm a cartoon
character. Can't l be upset sometimes?

907
00:53:58,464 --> 00:54:02,366  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
Max, forget about Annie.
l know lots of women you can date.

908
00:54:02,435 --> 00:54:04,460  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't want to go out
with other women.

909
00:54:04,904 --> 00:54:07,566  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:300 Y2:419
Max, l've got a girl for you.
You are going to love her.
She's a reporter for Rolling Stone.

910
00:54:10,142 --> 00:54:12,133  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
There are more people here
to see the Maharishi...

911
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:14,873  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
than there were
to see the Dylan concert.

912
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:18,144  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
l covered the Dylan concert,
which gave me chills.

913
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:23,587  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
Especially when he sang,
"She takes just like a woman...

914
00:54:23,656 --> 00:54:26,557  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:334 Y2:409
and she makes love
just like a woman.

915
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,593  X1:274 X2:448 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yes, she does.

916
00:54:28,661 --> 00:54:31,960  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:374 Y2:410
And she aches just like a woman...

917
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:35,330  X1:240 X2:482 Y1:334 Y2:409
but she breaks
just like a little girl."

918
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:38,370  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
Up to that, the most
charismatic event l covered...

919
00:54:38,437 --> 00:54:41,065  X1:136 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
was Mick's birthday when the Stones
played Madison Square Garden.

920
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,767  X1:252 X2:469 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's just great.

921
00:54:42,842 --> 00:54:45,003  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:374 Y2:410
You catch Dylan?

922
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:48,376  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l couldn't make it.
My raccoon had hepatitis.

923
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:50,381  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
You have a raccoon?

924
00:54:50,449 --> 00:54:51,882  X1:319 X2:403 Y1:374 Y2:410
A few.

925
00:54:51,951 --> 00:54:54,852  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
The only word for this
is "transplendent."

926
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,686  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's transplendent.
- l can think of another word.

927
00:54:58,758 --> 00:55:01,386  X1:221 X2:501 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's God.
l mean, this man is God.

928
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,190  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's got millions of followers,
who would crawl across the world...

929
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:06,231  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
just to touch
the hem of his garment.

930
00:55:06,298 --> 00:55:08,232  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt must be a tremendous hem.

931
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,167  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm a Rosicrucian myself.
- Are you?

932
00:55:11,237 --> 00:55:15,435  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't get with any religion that
advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look.

933
00:55:15,508 --> 00:55:17,806  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's God coming out
of the men's room.

934
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:20,607  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's unbelievably transplendent!

935
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:23,910  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was at the Stones' concert
when they killed that guy. Remember?

936
00:55:23,983 --> 00:55:27,043  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Were you?
l was at an Alice Cooper thing...

937
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,350  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
where six people were rushed
to the hospital with bad vibes.

938
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,824  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
l hope you don't mind
that l took so long to finish.

939
00:55:33,893 --> 00:55:36,987  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
Me? No. Don't be silly.

940
00:55:38,664 --> 00:55:42,600  X1:168 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm starting to get some feeling
back in my jaw now.

941
00:55:43,736 --> 00:55:47,172  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sex with you is really
a Kafkaesque experience.

942
00:55:48,641 --> 00:55:50,336  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thank you.

943
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:52,877  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:374 Y2:410
l mean that as a compliment.

944
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:57,348  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think there's too much burden
placed on the orgasm...

945
00:55:57,416 --> 00:56:00,715  X1:189 X2:533 Y1:334 Y2:409
to make up for empty areas
in life.

946
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:04,489  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who said that?

947
00:56:07,226 --> 00:56:10,059  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know. l think
it may have been Leopold and Loeb.

948
00:56:15,101 --> 00:56:16,534  X1:328 X2:394 Y1:374 Y2:410
Hello.

949
00:56:21,607 --> 00:56:24,838  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:374 Y2:410
No. What's the matter?

950
00:56:26,445 --> 00:56:29,107  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:374 Y2:410
You sound terrible.

951
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:31,547  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:374 Y2:410
No, what-- Sure, l--

952
00:56:31,617 --> 00:56:33,847  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:374 Y2:410
What kind of emergency?

953
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:37,719  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, stay there.
l'll come over right now.

954
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:40,088  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just stay there.
l'll come right over.

955
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:42,626  X1:262 X2:460 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's me. Open up.
Are you okay?

956
00:56:42,695 --> 00:56:45,289  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

957
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:47,730  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's a spider in the bathroom.

958
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,531  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What?
- There's a big spider in the bathroom.

959
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:57,198  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
You got me here at 3:00 a.m.
'cause a spider's in the bathroom?

960
00:56:57,276 --> 00:57:01,736  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know how l am about insects. l can't
sleep with that thing crawling around.

961
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:04,305  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
Kill it!
What's wrong with you?

962
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:07,443  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't you have Raid in the house?

963
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,389  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
l told you a thousand times
to keep a lot of insect spray.

964
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,824  X1:133 X2:588 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You never know who will crawl over.
- l know.

965
00:57:14,894 --> 00:57:17,021  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:334 Y2:409
And a first aid kit
and fire extinguisher.

966
00:57:17,096 --> 00:57:19,564  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
Give me a magazine,
'cause l'm a little tired.

967
00:57:19,632 --> 00:57:22,863  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
You make fun of me,
but l'm prepared for anything.

968
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:25,665  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
An emergency, a tidal wave,
an earthquake.

969
00:57:26,505 --> 00:57:29,997  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is this?
Did you go to a rock concert?

970
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:31,508  X1:325 X2:396 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah.

971
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:35,240  X1:256 X2:466 Y1:334 Y2:409
Really?
How'd you like it?

972
00:57:35,314 --> 00:57:39,512  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
Was it heavy? Did it achieve
total "heavyosity"?

973
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:41,985  X1:254 X2:468 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt was just great!

974
00:57:42,054 --> 00:57:45,421  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've got an idea. Call the guy
who took you to the rock concert...

975
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:47,925  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:374 Y2:410
and he can come and kill the spider.

976
00:57:47,993 --> 00:57:50,621  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
l called you.
You want to help me or not?

977
00:57:50,696 --> 00:57:54,462  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
Since when do you read the National
Review? What are you turning into?

978
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:57,696  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
l like to get all points of view.

979
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:00,534  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wonderful. Get William F. Buckley
to kill the spider.

980
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:03,632  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're a little hostile,
you know that?

981
00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:06,644  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
Not only that,
you look thin and tired.

982
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:10,011  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's 3:00 in the morning.
You got me out of bed.

983
00:58:10,082 --> 00:58:13,176  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
l ran over. l couldn't get a taxi.
You said it was an emergency.

984
00:58:13,252 --> 00:58:15,311  X1:250 X2:471 Y1:374 Y2:410
l ran up the stairs.

985
00:58:15,387 --> 00:58:18,720  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was more attractive
when the evening began.

986
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:21,760  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you going with
a right-wing rock-and-roll star?

987
00:58:21,827 --> 00:58:24,660  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Would you like
a glass of chocolate milk?

988
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:29,497  X1:119 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What am l, your son? l came over for--
- l've got the good chocolate.

989
00:58:29,568 --> 00:58:32,503  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Where's the spider?
- lt's in the bathroom.

990
00:58:32,571 --> 00:58:36,564  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't squish it. After it's dead,
flush it down the toilet, okay?

991
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:40,078  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've been killing spiders
since l was 30. Okay?

992
00:58:44,617 --> 00:58:48,314  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a very big spider.
A lot of trouble. There's two of 'em.

993
00:58:48,387 --> 00:58:50,821  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
l didn't think it was that big,
but it's a major spider.

994
00:58:50,889 --> 00:58:55,588  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You got a broom or snow shovel?
- l left it at your house. l'm sorry.

995
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:57,595  X1:235 X2:487 Y1:374 Y2:410
What are you doing?

996
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,257  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's a spider in your bathroom
the size of a Buick.

997
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,206  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You got black soap?
- lt's for my complexion.

998
00:59:12,278 --> 00:59:15,406  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are you joining a minstrel show?

999
00:59:23,088 --> 00:59:24,521  X1:285 X2:437 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't worry.

1000
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:36,497  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
l did it. l killed them both.
What's the matter?

1001
00:59:36,568 --> 00:59:41,062  X1:106 X2:616 Y1:334 Y2:409
What are you sad about? Did you want me
to capture and rehabilitate 'em?

1002
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,268  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Don't go, please.
- What do you mean?

1003
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:47,676  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's the matter?
Are you expecting termites?

1004
00:59:47,746 --> 00:59:50,010  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's the matter?

1005
00:59:50,082 --> 00:59:52,778  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:374 Y2:410
l don't know. l miss you.

1006
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:55,649  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:374 Y2:410
Jesus! Really?

1007
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:04,791  X1:310 X2:411 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Alvy?
- What?

1008
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:10,459  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
Was there somebody in your room
when l called you?

1009
01:00:10,536 --> 01:00:14,165  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What do you mean?
- l mean, l thought l heard a voice.

1010
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,266  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
l had the radio on.
l'm sorry, it was the television.

1011
01:00:24,216 --> 01:00:29,017  X1:196 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
Let's never break up again.
l don't want to be apart.

1012
01:00:29,088 --> 01:00:33,752  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think we're both much too mature
for something like that.

1013
01:00:33,826 --> 01:00:36,659  X1:148 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
Living together hasn't been so bad,
has it?

1014
01:00:36,729 --> 01:00:39,926  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
For me it's been terrific.
You know?

1015
01:00:39,998 --> 01:00:42,558  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:374 Y2:410
Better than either of my marriages.

1016
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:47,003  X1:121 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's something different about you.
l don't know what, but it's great.

1017
01:00:47,072 --> 01:00:52,704  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think, if you let me,
l could help you have more fun.

1018
01:00:52,778 --> 01:00:55,872  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
l know it's hard. Yeah.

1019
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:59,611  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:374 Y2:410
What if we go away this weekend?

1020
01:00:59,685 --> 01:01:03,246  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why don't we get Rob, and the three
of us would drive into Brooklyn?

1021
01:01:03,322 --> 01:01:05,984  X1:115 X2:607 Y1:334 Y2:409
We could show you the old neighborhood.
That'd be fun for you.

1022
01:01:06,058 --> 01:01:08,151  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah, l'd love it.

1023
01:01:09,128 --> 01:01:11,392  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:374 Y2:410
God, it's a great day!

1024
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:15,229  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:334 Y2:409
Watch the road!
You'll total the car!

1025
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,427  X1:194 X2:527 Y1:374 Y2:410
l've never been to Brooklyn.

1026
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:20,097  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l can't wait to see the neighborhood.
- The neighborhood will be great.

1027
01:01:20,172 --> 01:01:23,403  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We could show her the schoolyard.
- l was a great athlete. Tell her.

1028
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:26,137  X1:236 X2:486 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was all-schoolyard.

1029
01:01:26,211 --> 01:01:29,374  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
They threw him a football once.
He tried to dribble it.

1030
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:31,040  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:334 Y2:409
l used to lose
my glasses a lot.

1031
01:01:31,116 --> 01:01:34,779  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look! That's my old house.
That's where l used to live.

1032
01:01:34,853 --> 01:01:36,286  X1:303 X2:418 Y1:374 Y2:410
Holy cow!

1033
01:01:37,456 --> 01:01:40,584  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're lucky. Where l used to live
is now a pornographic equipment store.

1034
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:42,889  X1:227 X2:495 Y1:334 Y2:409
l had some very
good memories there.

1035
01:01:42,961 --> 01:01:46,055  X1:150 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
What good memories, your mother
and father fighting all the time?

1036
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:48,691  X1:143 X2:578 Y1:374 Y2:410
And over the most ridiculous things.

1037
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:51,359  X1:163 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You fired the cleaning woman?
- She was stealing!

1038
01:01:51,437 --> 01:01:53,962  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
But she's colored.
The colored have enough trouble!

1039
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:56,564  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
- She was going through my purse.
- They're persecuted enough.

1040
01:01:56,642 --> 01:02:00,635  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Who's persecuting? She stole!
- So? We can afford it.

1041
01:02:00,712 --> 01:02:04,045  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
How can we afford it, on your pay?
What if she steals more?

1042
01:02:04,116 --> 01:02:07,210  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
She's a colored woman from Harlem.
She has no money.

1043
01:02:07,286 --> 01:02:11,222  X1:122 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
She has a right to steal from us.
Who can she steal from if not from us?

1044
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13,918  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're both crazy.
- They can't hear you.

1045
01:02:13,992 --> 01:02:16,688  X1:236 X2:485 Y1:374 Y2:410
Leo, l married a fool!

1046
01:02:16,762 --> 01:02:18,593  X1:279 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's that?

1047
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:24,102  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's the welcome home party, 1945,
for my cousin Herbie.

1048
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:30,275  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look. That over there
is Joey Nichols.

1049
01:02:30,342 --> 01:02:33,004  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
He was my father's friend. He was
always bothering me when l was a kid.

1050
01:02:33,078 --> 01:02:36,013  X1:279 X2:442 Y1:334 Y2:409
Joey Nichols.
See? Nickels.

1051
01:02:36,081 --> 01:02:39,380  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:334 Y2:409
See? Nickels.
You see? Nickels.

1052
01:02:39,451 --> 01:02:44,514  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
You can always remember my name.
Just think of Joey Five-Cents.

1053
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:48,549  X1:258 X2:464 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's me.
Joey Five-Cents.

1054
01:02:48,627 --> 01:02:50,219  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:374 Y2:410
What an asshole.

1055
01:02:50,295 --> 01:02:53,628  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
The one who killed me the most
was my mother's sister, Tessie.

1056
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:56,361  X1:199 X2:523 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was always the sister
with good common sense...

1057
01:02:56,435 --> 01:02:59,097  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
but Tessie was always the one
with personality.

1058
01:02:59,171 --> 01:03:02,163  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
When she was younger,
they all wanted to marry Tessie.

1059
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:05,039  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you believe Tessie
had the personality?

1060
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:08,978  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
- She's the life of the ghetto no doubt.
- She was once a great beauty.

1061
01:03:09,047 --> 01:03:11,948  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
Tessie, they say you were the sister
with personality.

1062
01:03:12,017 --> 01:03:14,611  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was a great beauty!

1063
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:18,713  X1:124 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
- How did this personality come about?
- l was very charming.

1064
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:20,951  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
There were many men
interested in you?

1065
01:03:21,026 --> 01:03:24,826  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was quite a lively dancer.

1066
01:03:24,897 --> 01:03:26,865  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's very hard to believe.

1067
01:03:26,965 --> 01:03:32,198  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
l had a really good day.
lt was a fine way to spend my birthday.

1068
01:03:32,271 --> 01:03:35,434  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Your birthday isn't until tomorrow.
- But it's real close.

1069
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:37,839  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:374 Y2:410
But no presents until midnight.

1070
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:42,980  X1:263 X2:458 Y1:374 Y2:410
Happy birthday.

1071
01:03:43,048 --> 01:03:46,176  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is this? ls this a present?
Are you kidding?

1072
01:03:46,251 --> 01:03:48,981  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah. Why don't you try it on?

1073
01:03:49,054 --> 01:03:53,582  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
- This is more like a present for you.
- lt'll add ten years to our sex life.

1074
01:03:53,659 --> 01:03:55,559  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah. Forget it.

1075
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:58,323  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:374 Y2:410
Here's a real present.

1076
01:03:58,397 --> 01:04:01,389  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What is this anyway?
- Check it out.

1077
01:04:05,771 --> 01:04:09,764  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
You knew l wanted this.
God, it's terrific!

1078
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:13,242  X1:137 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just put on the watch and that thing.
lt'll be perfect.

1079
01:04:23,974 --> 01:04:27,910  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1080
01:04:27,978 --> 01:04:32,608  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1081
01:04:33,984 --> 01:04:37,476  X1:292 X2:430 Y1:374 Y2:410
Having you

1082
01:04:37,555 --> 01:04:40,285  X1:281 X2:441 Y1:374 Y2:410
To walk with

1083
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:43,451  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1084
01:04:46,964 --> 01:04:51,264  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1085
01:04:52,803 --> 01:04:57,103  X1:215 X2:507 Y1:374 Y2:410
Having you to walk with

1086
01:04:58,642 --> 01:05:03,944  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:374 Y2:410
And it's still a thrill

1087
01:05:04,014 --> 01:05:09,316  X1:227 X2:495 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just to have my arms

1088
01:05:09,386 --> 01:05:11,854  X1:288 X2:433 Y1:374 Y2:410
Around you

1089
01:05:15,025 --> 01:05:19,121  X1:281 X2:441 Y1:374 Y2:410
Still the thrill

1090
01:05:19,196 --> 01:05:23,189  X1:240 X2:481 Y1:374 Y2:410
That it was the day

1091
01:05:23,267 --> 01:05:26,759  X1:292 X2:430 Y1:374 Y2:410
l found you

1092
01:05:26,837 --> 01:05:32,469  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1093
01:05:32,543 --> 01:05:37,037  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1094
01:05:40,251 --> 01:05:45,484  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:374 Y2:410
Dinner dates and flowers

1095
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:53,328  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1096
01:05:54,832 --> 01:06:00,168  X1:239 X2:482 Y1:374 Y2:410
Staying up all hours

1097
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:05,470  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:374 Y2:410
Making dreams come true

1098
01:06:06,844 --> 01:06:11,679  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:374 Y2:410
Doing things we used

1099
01:06:12,883 --> 01:06:16,284  X1:324 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
To do

1100
01:06:18,222 --> 01:06:21,453  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1101
01:06:21,525 --> 01:06:25,154  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1102
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,497  X1:299 X2:423 Y1:374 Y2:410
Here with

1103
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,934  X1:334 X2:388 Y1:374 Y2:410
You

1104
01:06:47,618 --> 01:06:49,586  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thank you.

1105
01:06:49,687 --> 01:06:51,882  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:374 Y2:410
You were sensational.

1106
01:06:51,956 --> 01:06:55,357  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
l told you if you stuck to it,
you would be great and--

1107
01:06:55,426 --> 01:06:57,553  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:374 Y2:410
You were sensational.

1108
01:06:57,661 --> 01:07:00,994  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah, they were a terrific audience.

1109
01:07:01,065 --> 01:07:04,660  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt makes it easy for me,
because l can be--

1110
01:07:04,735 --> 01:07:08,171  X1:252 X2:470 Y1:334 Y2:409
Excuse me.
Hi, l'm Tony Lacey.

1111
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:13,040  X1:114 X2:608 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We wanted to say we enjoyed your set.
- Yeah? Really?

1112
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:16,102  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
l thought it was very musical.
l liked it a lot.

1113
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,307  X1:254 X2:468 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's really nice.
Thanks a lot.

1114
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:22,409  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you recording?
Are you with any label?

1115
01:07:22,486 --> 01:07:25,751  X1:252 X2:469 Y1:374 Y2:410
Me? No, not at all.

1116
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:30,055  X1:173 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'd like to talk to you about that
sometime if you get a chance.

1117
01:07:30,127 --> 01:07:33,426  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
Possibly working together.

1118
01:07:33,497 --> 01:07:38,161  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's nice. This is Alvy Singer.
Do you know Alvy?

1119
01:07:38,235 --> 01:07:42,433  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't, but l know your work.
l'm a big fan of yours.

1120
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:46,704  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:374 Y2:410
This is Shawn, Bob and Petronia.

1121
01:07:49,413 --> 01:07:52,314  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:374 Y2:410
We're going back to the Pierre...

1122
01:07:52,383 --> 01:07:55,443  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
and we're going to meet
Jack and Angelica for a drink.

1123
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,682  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf you'd like to come,
we'd love to have you.

1124
01:07:58,756 --> 01:08:02,385  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:334 Y2:409
We can sit and talk.
Not a big deal.

1125
01:08:02,459 --> 01:08:05,360  X1:199 X2:523 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just relax, be very mellow.

1126
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:07,590  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
Remember we had that thing?

1127
01:08:07,665 --> 01:08:09,223  X1:285 X2:437 Y1:374 Y2:410
What thing?

1128
01:08:10,467 --> 01:08:12,867  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:374 Y2:410
Remember we discussed that thing?

1129
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:20,303  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, the thing!
Oh, the thing. Yeah.

1130
01:08:20,377 --> 01:08:24,746  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, if it's inconvenient,
that's fine, too.

1131
01:08:24,815 --> 01:08:29,445  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
We'll do it another time. lf you're on
the coast, we'll get together there.

1132
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,114  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was a wonderful set.
l really enjoyed it.

1133
01:08:32,189 --> 01:08:34,521  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nice to have met you.
Good night.

1134
01:08:40,597 --> 01:08:43,566  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's the matter?
You want to go to that party?

1135
01:08:43,634 --> 01:08:46,296  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know.
l thought it might be fun.

1136
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,565  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt would be nice to meet
some new people.

1137
01:08:50,007 --> 01:08:54,706  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think l could take a mellow
evening. l don't respond well to mellow.

1138
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:58,441  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf l get too mellow,
l ripen and rot.

1139
01:08:58,515 --> 01:09:01,882  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's not good for my--
- All right.

1140
01:09:01,952 --> 01:09:04,512  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
You don't want to go to the party.
What do you want to do?

1141
01:09:12,463 --> 01:09:16,058  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
That day in Brooklyn was the last day
l remember having a good time.

1142
01:09:16,133 --> 01:09:19,967  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We never have any laughs anymore.
- l've been moody and dissatisfied.

1143
01:09:20,037 --> 01:09:23,097  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
- How often do you sleep together?
- Do you have sex often?

1144
01:09:23,173 --> 01:09:25,505  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
Hardly ever.
Maybe three times a week.

1145
01:09:25,576 --> 01:09:29,808  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
Constantly. l'd say three times a week.
Like the other night, Alvy wanted sex.

1146
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,871  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
She would not sleep with me
the other night.

1147
01:09:31,949 --> 01:09:36,318  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know. Six months ago l would
have done it just to please him.

1148
01:09:36,387 --> 01:09:38,321  X1:252 X2:469 Y1:374 Y2:410
l tried everything.

1149
01:09:38,389 --> 01:09:41,881  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:334 Y2:409
l put on soft music
and my red light bulb.

1150
01:09:41,959 --> 01:09:47,261  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
Since our discussions here, l feel
l have a right to my own feelings.

1151
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:50,698  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think you would have been happy,
because l really asserted myself.

1152
01:09:50,768 --> 01:09:53,236  X1:192 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
The incredible thing is,
l'm paying for her analysis...

1153
01:09:53,303 --> 01:09:56,101  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
she's making progress,
and l'm getting screwed.

1154
01:09:56,173 --> 01:10:00,507  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
l feel so guilty,
because Alvy is paying for it.

1155
01:10:00,577 --> 01:10:02,875  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
So l feel guilty
if l don't sleep with him.

1156
01:10:02,946 --> 01:10:06,814  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
But if l do sleep with him, it's like
l'm going against my own feelings.

1157
01:10:06,884 --> 01:10:10,980  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm not making any progress.
- l can't win.

1158
01:10:11,054 --> 01:10:13,215  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sometimes l think
l should live with a woman.

1159
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:17,589  X1:143 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't believe it.
You guys have never snorted coke?

1160
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:21,859  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
l always wanted to try,
but Alvy's very down on it.

1161
01:10:21,932 --> 01:10:25,561  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't put it on me. l don't want to put
a wad of white powder in my nose.

1162
01:10:25,636 --> 01:10:27,570  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's the nasal membrane.

1163
01:10:27,638 --> 01:10:31,233  X1:132 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You never want to try anything new.
- How can you say that?

1164
01:10:31,308 --> 01:10:36,109  X1:114 X2:607 Y1:334 Y2:409
l said you, l and that girl
from acting class should sleep together.

1165
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,149  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
- That's sick.
- l know it's sick, but it's new.

1166
01:10:39,216 --> 01:10:41,912  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You didn't say it couldn't be sick.
- Come on, Alvy.

1167
01:10:43,053 --> 01:10:45,783  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Do your body a favor. Try it.
- lt'll be fun.

1168
01:10:45,856 --> 01:10:50,225  X1:165 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm sure it's fun, 'cause the lncas
did it. They were a million laughs.

1169
01:10:50,294 --> 01:10:52,694  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
For your own experience.
You want to write. Why not?

1170
01:10:52,763 --> 01:10:56,756  X1:158 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's great stuff, Alvy. A friend
just brought it in from California.

1171
01:10:56,834 --> 01:11:00,099  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
l didn't tell you.
We're going to California next week.

1172
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:03,264  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's really a thrill, as you know.

1173
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:07,743  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
On my agent's advice, l sold out
and am going to do a TV appearance.

1174
01:11:07,811 --> 01:11:10,279  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's not it at all.
Alvy's giving an award on TV.

1175
01:11:10,347 --> 01:11:12,781  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
You act like you're violating
a moral issue.

1176
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:16,980  X1:113 X2:608 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's so phony. We have to leave New York
during Christmas. lt kills me.

1177
01:11:17,054 --> 01:11:22,651  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
Listen, while you're in California,
could you score some coke for me?

1178
01:11:22,726 --> 01:11:27,857  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sure, be glad to. l'll just put it
in the hollow heel on my boot.

1179
01:11:27,931 --> 01:11:32,425  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
- How much is this stuff?
- About $2,000 an ounce.

1180
01:11:32,503 --> 01:11:35,063  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Really?
And what is the kick of it?

1181
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:49,985  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've never been so relaxed
as l have been since l moved out here.

1182
01:11:50,053 --> 01:11:54,046  X1:196 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
l want you to see my house.
l live next to Hugh Hefner.

1183
01:11:54,124 --> 01:11:58,288  X1:126 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
And the women are like in Playboy,
but they can move their arms and legs.

1184
01:11:58,362 --> 01:12:02,025  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't get over that
this is really Beverly Hills.

1185
01:12:02,099 --> 01:12:05,125  X1:137 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
The architecture is really consistent.
There's French next to Spanish...

1186
01:12:05,202 --> 01:12:07,762  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:374 Y2:410
next to Tudor next to Japanese.

1187
01:12:07,838 --> 01:12:09,772  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's so clean out here.

1188
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,606  X1:109 X2:612 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because they don't throw garbage away.
They make it into TV shows.

1189
01:12:13,677 --> 01:12:18,239  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Give us a break. lt's Christmas.
- Can you believe this is Christmas?

1190
01:12:18,315 --> 01:12:21,978  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was snowing and really gray
in New York.

1191
01:12:22,052 --> 01:12:24,680  X1:237 X2:484 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nice. Santa Claus
will have sun stroke.

1192
01:12:24,755 --> 01:12:28,088  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
Max, there's no crime,
there's no mugging.

1193
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:30,252  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's no economic crime...

1194
01:12:30,327 --> 01:12:33,490  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
but there's ritual,
religious cult murders.

1195
01:12:33,564 --> 01:12:35,589  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's wheat-germ
killers out here.

1196
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:38,294  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
While you're out here,
l want you to see my TV show.

1197
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,893  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:334 Y2:409
And we're invited
to a big Christmas party.

1198
01:12:52,015 --> 01:12:55,507  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:374 Y2:410
Charlie, give me a good laugh here.

1199
01:12:58,455 --> 01:13:00,480  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:374 Y2:410
A little bigger.

1200
01:13:00,557 --> 01:13:03,185  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you realize how immoral
this all is?

1201
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,387  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
l've got a hit series.

1202
01:13:05,462 --> 01:13:07,453  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:374 Y2:410
But you're adding fake laughs.

1203
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,535  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:374 Y2:410
Give me a tremendous laugh here.

1204
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:14,696  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
We do the show live
in front of an audience.

1205
01:13:14,771 --> 01:13:17,001  X1:168 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
But nobody laughs,
because the jokes aren't funny.

1206
01:13:17,074 --> 01:13:19,634  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's why this machine is dynamite.

1207
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,845  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:374 Y2:410
Give me a medium chuckle here...

1208
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:29,909  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:374 Y2:410
and then a big hand.

1209
01:13:29,987 --> 01:13:32,854  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:374 Y2:410
ls there booing on that?

1210
01:13:32,923 --> 01:13:35,653  X1:266 X2:456 Y1:374 Y2:410
l don't feel well.

1211
01:13:35,726 --> 01:13:39,321  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What's the matter?
- l got very dizzy.

1212
01:13:39,396 --> 01:13:41,694  X1:283 X2:438 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l feel dizzy.
- Sit down.

1213
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:43,198  X1:321 X2:400 Y1:374 Y2:410
Jesus.

1214
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:47,070  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
You all right?
You want to lie down?

1215
01:13:47,137 --> 01:13:50,163  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
No. My stomach felt
queasy all morning.

1216
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,333  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:374 Y2:410
How about a ginger ale?

1217
01:13:52,409 --> 01:13:55,105  X1:206 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
No.
Maybe l'd better lie down.

1218
01:13:55,178 --> 01:13:58,944  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Try to get some of this down.
lt's just plain chicken.

1219
01:14:00,617 --> 01:14:03,586  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l can't eat this.
l'm nauseous.

1220
01:14:05,856 --> 01:14:09,587  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf you could get me something
to get me through the next two hours.

1221
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:13,528  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have to go to Burbank
and give out an award on a TV show.

1222
01:14:13,597 --> 01:14:16,259  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's nothing wrong with you
as far as l can tell.

1223
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:19,530  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
You have no fever,
no symptoms of anything serious.

1224
01:14:19,603 --> 01:14:23,767  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You haven't eaten pork or shellfish.
- Excuse me. l'm sorry, Doctor.

1225
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,833  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, that was the show. Everything
is fine. They found a replacement.

1226
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:30,072  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:374 Y2:410
They're going to tape without you.

1227
01:14:30,147 --> 01:14:32,741  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
Jesus!
Now l don't get to do the TV show?

1228
01:14:34,384 --> 01:14:37,182  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l can't find any reason for this.
- Nothing at all?

1229
01:14:37,254 --> 01:14:41,281  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l could get a lab man up here.
- Hand me the salt, please.

1230
01:14:41,358 --> 01:14:45,419  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
Perhaps it would be better
if we took him to the hospital.

1231
01:14:45,495 --> 01:14:46,928  X1:277 X2:445 Y1:374 Y2:410
The hospital?

1232
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:50,305  X1:123 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
- There's no other way to diagnose him.
- This is not bad, actually.

1233
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:58,844  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't tell me we're going to have
to walk from the car to the house?

1234
01:14:58,914 --> 01:15:01,940  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
My feet haven't touched pavement
since l reached Los Angeles.

1235
01:15:02,017 --> 01:15:05,817  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll take a meeting with you
if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.

1236
01:15:05,888 --> 01:15:08,118  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
l took a meeting with Freddy.
Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.

1237
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:10,886  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You take a meeting with him.
- All the good meetings are taken.

1238
01:15:10,959 --> 01:15:12,893  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
Right now it's only a notion.

1239
01:15:12,961 --> 01:15:17,057  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think l can get money to make it into
a concept, then turn it into an idea.

1240
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:19,863  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
Like this house, Max?

1241
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:22,495  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
Even wrote a road map
to get us to the bathroom.

1242
01:15:22,571 --> 01:15:24,630  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
You should have told me
it was Tony Lacey's party.

1243
01:15:24,706 --> 01:15:26,401  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:374 Y2:410
What difference does that make?

1244
01:15:26,475 --> 01:15:28,409  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
l think he has a thing for Annie.

1245
01:15:28,477 --> 01:15:32,436  X1:130 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
- No. He goes with that girl over there.
- Where?

1246
01:15:32,514 --> 01:15:35,540  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
- The one with the VPL.
- VPL?

1247
01:15:35,617 --> 01:15:38,643  X1:255 X2:467 Y1:334 Y2:409
Visible panty line.
She's gorgeous.

1248
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,917  X1:119 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
She's a ten. That's great for you,
'cause you're used to two's, aren't you?

1249
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:43,582  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
There are no two's.

1250
01:15:43,659 --> 01:15:46,287  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're used to the kind with shopping
bags walking through Central Park...

1251
01:15:46,361 --> 01:15:49,023  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
with the surgical masks on,
muttering.

1252
01:15:49,097 --> 01:15:51,930  X1:124 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
How do you like this couple? They look
like they're from Masters and Johnson.

1253
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,993  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:334 Y2:409
lntensive care ward.
My God!

1254
01:15:56,071 --> 01:16:00,064  X1:126 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l think she's giving me the eye.
- lf she comes over, my brain will mush.

1255
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:04,072  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're Alvy Singer, right?
Didn't we meet at EST?

1256
01:16:04,146 --> 01:16:06,011  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:374 Y2:410
No, l was never to EST.

1257
01:16:06,081 --> 01:16:09,175  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Then how can you criticize it?
- He didn't say anything.

1258
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:13,483  X1:152 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
l came to get some shock therapy,
but there was an energy crisis.

1259
01:16:13,555 --> 01:16:16,353  X1:108 X2:614 Y1:334 Y2:409
- He's my food taster. Have you two met?
- How do you do?

1260
01:16:16,425 --> 01:16:19,519  X1:154 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Do you taste for poisoned food?
- Yeah, he's great.

1261
01:16:19,595 --> 01:16:21,995  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
You guys are wearing white.
lt must be in the stars.

1262
01:16:22,064 --> 01:16:25,966  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Uri Geller must be on the premises.
- We're going to operate together.

1263
01:16:26,034 --> 01:16:31,028  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
ln about six weeks
we could cut the whole album.

1264
01:16:31,106 --> 01:16:33,506  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know.
This is strange to me.

1265
01:16:33,575 --> 01:16:36,601  X1:165 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
You can stay here.
Use the whole wing in this house.

1266
01:16:36,678 --> 01:16:41,308  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Stay here?
- Really. Why are you smiling?

1267
01:16:41,383 --> 01:16:44,875  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
Not only is he a great agent,
but he really gives good leading.

1268
01:16:44,953 --> 01:16:49,413  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
This is a great house: saunas,
Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.

1269
01:16:49,491 --> 01:16:53,757  X1:111 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know who the original owners were?
Nelson Eddy then Legs Diamond.

1270
01:16:53,829 --> 01:16:57,162  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Then you know who lived here?
- Trigger.

1271
01:16:57,232 --> 01:17:00,633  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
Charlie Chaplin,
right before his un-American thing.

1272
01:17:02,137 --> 01:17:06,335  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
- But you guys are still New Yorkers.
- Yeah, l love it there.

1273
01:17:06,408 --> 01:17:11,436  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
l used to live there for years,
but it's so dirty now.

1274
01:17:11,513 --> 01:17:15,779  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm into garbage. lt's my thing.
- This is a nice screening room.

1275
01:17:15,851 --> 01:17:18,046  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's another thing about New York.

1276
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,281  X1:198 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf you want to see a movie,
you have to stand on line.

1277
01:17:20,355 --> 01:17:22,721  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt could be freezing or raining.
And here--

1278
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:25,282  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:374 Y2:410
We saw Grand lllusion here last night.

1279
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,329  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's a great film if you're high.
lt's really funny.

1280
01:17:28,397 --> 01:17:31,662  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
Come and see our bedroom.
We did a fantastic thing up there.

1281
01:17:31,733 --> 01:17:33,826  X1:312 X2:409 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm cool.

1282
01:17:33,902 --> 01:17:36,871  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's wonderful.
They eat and watch movies all day.

1283
01:17:36,938 --> 01:17:41,432  X1:111 X2:610 Y1:334 Y2:409
And gradually you get old and die. lt's
important to make an effort sometimes.

1284
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,842  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Do you think his girlfriend's pretty?
- She's great looking.

1285
01:17:43,912 --> 01:17:47,279  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:374 Y2:410
A little on the androgynous side.

1286
01:17:47,349 --> 01:17:49,283  X1:240 X2:481 Y1:374 Y2:410
l forgot my mantra.

1287
01:18:07,969 --> 01:18:10,233  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:374 Y2:410
That was fun.

1288
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:13,433  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think California
is bad at all.

1289
01:18:13,508 --> 01:18:15,806  X1:211 X2:510 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's a drag coming home.

1290
01:18:15,877 --> 01:18:19,973  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
A lot of beautiful women.
lt was fun to flirt.

1291
01:18:20,048 --> 01:18:22,175  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:374 Y2:410
l have to face facts.

1292
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:26,880  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
l adore Alvy, but our relationship
doesn't seem to work anymore.

1293
01:18:26,955 --> 01:18:30,686  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll have the usual trouble
with Annie in bed tonight.

1294
01:18:30,759 --> 01:18:32,693  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why do l need this?

1295
01:18:32,761 --> 01:18:37,698  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf only l had the nerve to break up,
but it would really hurt him.

1296
01:18:37,766 --> 01:18:41,293  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf only l didn't feel guilty
asking Annie to move out.

1297
01:18:41,369 --> 01:18:44,736  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt'd probably wreck her,
but l should be honest.

1298
01:18:44,806 --> 01:18:47,536  X1:253 X2:468 Y1:374 Y2:410
Alvy, let's face it.

1299
01:18:47,609 --> 01:18:51,340  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think our relationship
is working.

1300
01:18:51,413 --> 01:18:54,439  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know. A relationship
is like a shark:

1301
01:18:54,516 --> 01:18:57,815  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt has to constantly
move forward or it dies.

1302
01:18:57,886 --> 01:19:01,845  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
And l think what we've got
on our hands is a dead shark.

1303
01:19:01,923 --> 01:19:04,687  X1:150 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Whose Catcher in the Rye is this?
- lf it has my name on it...

1304
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,921  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
l guess it's mine.

1305
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:12,763  X1:134 X2:588 Y1:334 Y2:409
You wrote your name in all my books,
'cause you knew this day would come.

1306
01:19:12,834 --> 01:19:16,292  X1:215 X2:507 Y1:334 Y2:409
You wanted to break up
just as much as l do.

1307
01:19:16,371 --> 01:19:20,307  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
No question. l think
we're doing the mature thing.

1308
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:23,708  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look. All the books
on death and dying are yours.

1309
01:19:23,779 --> 01:19:26,213  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:374 Y2:410
And all the poetry books are mine.

1310
01:19:26,281 --> 01:19:29,682  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
Denial of Death.
This is the first book l got you.

1311
01:19:29,751 --> 01:19:31,685  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:374 Y2:410
Remember that day?

1312
01:19:31,753 --> 01:19:34,347  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
l feel like there's
a great weight off my back.

1313
01:19:36,057 --> 01:19:38,025  X1:271 X2:451 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thanks, honey.

1314
01:19:38,093 --> 01:19:43,463  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
l mean, no. l think it's important
for us to explore new relationships.

1315
01:19:43,532 --> 01:19:48,629  X1:116 X2:606 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's no question about that, because
we've given this a more than fair shot.

1316
01:19:48,703 --> 01:19:50,898  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
My analyst thinks this move
is key for me.

1317
01:19:50,972 --> 01:19:55,341  X1:124 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
And l trust her,
because my analyst recommended her.

1318
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:58,504  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why should l put you through
all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

1319
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:02,107  X1:104 X2:617 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what the beauty part is?
We can always come back together again.

1320
01:20:02,184 --> 01:20:04,345  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
- There's no problem.
- Exactly.

1321
01:20:04,419 --> 01:20:09,049  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think many couples could handle
this, break up and remain friends.

1322
01:20:09,124 --> 01:20:11,820  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:334 Y2:409
This button is mine.
Remember?

1323
01:20:11,893 --> 01:20:15,624  X1:118 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
These are yours. "lmpeach Eisenhower."
"lmpeach Nixon."

1324
01:20:15,697 --> 01:20:19,326  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
"lmpeach Lyndon Johnson."
"lmpeach Ronald Reagan."

1325
01:20:20,802 --> 01:20:24,294  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
l miss Annie.
l made a terrible mistake.

1326
01:20:24,372 --> 01:20:27,398  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
She's living in Los Angeles
with Tony Lacey.

1327
01:20:27,475 --> 01:20:31,036  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf she is, then the hell with her. lf
she likes that lifestyle, let her stay.

1328
01:20:31,112 --> 01:20:33,979  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
- He's a jerk for one thing.
- He graduated Harvard.

1329
01:20:34,049 --> 01:20:37,951  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
Harvard makes mistakes, too.
Kissinger taught there.

1330
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,320  X1:188 X2:533 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't tell me you're jealous?

1331
01:20:41,389 --> 01:20:43,516  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah. Jealous? A little bit.
Like Medea.

1332
01:20:43,592 --> 01:20:47,255  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
Can l show you something?
l found this in the apartment.

1333
01:20:47,329 --> 01:20:52,130  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
Black soap. She used to wash her face
800 times a day with black soap.

1334
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,191  X1:252 X2:470 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't ask me why.

1335
01:20:54,269 --> 01:20:56,794  X1:114 X2:607 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why don't you go out with other women?

1336
01:20:56,872 --> 01:21:00,137  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
l tried,
but it's very depressing.

1337
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:03,143  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
This always happens to me.
Quick! Get a broom!

1338
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:06,374  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
What are you making
such a big deal about?

1339
01:21:06,448 --> 01:21:09,144  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
They're only lobsters.

1340
01:21:09,217 --> 01:21:12,516  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
-You're adult. You can pick up lobsters.
-l'm not myself since l quit smoking.

1341
01:21:12,587 --> 01:21:15,852  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
- When did you quit?
- Sixteen years ago.

1342
01:21:15,924 --> 01:21:18,757  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What do you mean?
- Mean?

1343
01:21:19,895 --> 01:21:22,864  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
You stopped smoking 16 years ago.
ls that what you said?

1344
01:21:24,733 --> 01:21:27,065  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:374 Y2:410
l don't understand.

1345
01:21:27,135 --> 01:21:29,763  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are you joking or what?

1346
01:21:41,049 --> 01:21:43,244  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
Central Park's turning green.

1347
01:21:43,318 --> 01:21:48,187  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
l saw that lunatic we used to see
with the pinwheel hat...

1348
01:21:48,256 --> 01:21:50,656  X1:228 X2:494 Y1:374 Y2:410
and the roller-skates.

1349
01:21:50,725 --> 01:21:54,183  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:374 Y2:410
Listen, l want you to come back here.

1350
01:21:54,262 --> 01:21:57,663  X1:134 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, then l'm going to come out there
and get you.

1351
01:22:02,037 --> 01:22:04,335  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean, where am l?
Where do you think l am?

1352
01:22:04,406 --> 01:22:08,604  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm at the Los Angeles airport.
l flew in.

1353
01:22:08,677 --> 01:22:11,510  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:374 Y2:410
l flew in to see you.

1354
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:14,810  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
Can we not debate this
on the telephone...

1355
01:22:14,883 --> 01:22:17,716  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:374 Y2:410
because l've got a temperature...

1356
01:22:17,786 --> 01:22:21,858  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
and l'm getting my chronic
Los Angeles nausea again.

1357
01:22:21,992 --> 01:22:24,426  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wherever you want to meet.
l don't care.

1358
01:22:24,494 --> 01:22:26,462  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll drive in.
l rented a car.

1359
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:29,565  X1:293 X2:429 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm driving.

1360
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:32,568  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
What, is that such a miracle?
l'm driving myself.

1361
01:22:48,852 --> 01:22:51,719  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm going to have the alfalfa sprouts...

1362
01:22:51,788 --> 01:22:55,451  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
and a plate of mashed yeast.

1363
01:23:15,011 --> 01:23:16,672  X1:263 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
You look pretty.

1364
01:23:16,746 --> 01:23:20,375  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l just lost a little weight,
that's all.

1365
01:23:24,788 --> 01:23:27,655  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well, you look nice.

1366
01:23:27,724 --> 01:23:31,558  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
l think we should get married.

1367
01:23:31,628 --> 01:23:33,095  X1:304 X2:417 Y1:374 Y2:410
Come on.

1368
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:39,391  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why, you want to live out here?
lt's like living in Munchkinland.

1369
01:23:39,469 --> 01:23:43,235  X1:196 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean?
lt's perfectly fine out here.

1370
01:23:43,306 --> 01:23:46,707  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:374 Y2:410
Tony's very nice.

1371
01:23:46,776 --> 01:23:49,973  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
l meet people, go to parties
and play tennis.

1372
01:23:50,046 --> 01:23:52,810  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's a very big step for me.

1373
01:23:52,883 --> 01:23:56,011  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm able to enjoy people more.

1374
01:23:56,086 --> 01:23:59,078  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're not going to come back
to New York?

1375
01:23:59,156 --> 01:24:03,058  X1:121 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's so great about New York? lt's a
dying city. You read Death in Venice.

1376
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:06,459  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
You didn't read Death in Venice
until l bought it for you.

1377
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:09,931  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's right. You only gave me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1378
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,366  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:374 Y2:410
Because it's an important issue.

1379
01:24:12,435 --> 01:24:15,427  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're incapable of enjoying life.
You know that?

1380
01:24:15,505 --> 01:24:17,939  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're like New York City.
You're just this person.

1381
01:24:18,008 --> 01:24:20,602  X1:146 X2:576 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're like this island unto yourself.

1382
01:24:20,677 --> 01:24:23,771  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't enjoy anything
unless everybody is.

1383
01:24:23,847 --> 01:24:28,216  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf one guy is starving someplace,
it puts a crimp in my evening.

1384
01:24:30,654 --> 01:24:32,588  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:374 Y2:410
Do you want to get married?

1385
01:24:34,691 --> 01:24:37,854  X1:251 X2:470 Y1:374 Y2:410
No. We're friends.

1386
01:24:37,928 --> 01:24:40,624  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:374 Y2:410
l want to remain friends.

1387
01:24:42,699 --> 01:24:44,132  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:374 Y2:410
Check please.

1388
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:47,193  X1:215 X2:507 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're mad, aren't you?

1389
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:50,137  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yes, of course l'm mad,
because you love me. l know that.

1390
01:24:50,207 --> 01:24:52,732  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't say that that's true
at this point in my life.

1391
01:24:52,809 --> 01:24:55,539  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:374 Y2:410
l really can't say that's true.

1392
01:24:55,612 --> 01:24:58,513  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
You know how wonderful you are.

1393
01:24:58,582 --> 01:25:02,450  X1:123 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're the reason l got out of my room,
that l was able to sing...

1394
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:06,853  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
and get more in touch with my feelings
and all that crap.

1395
01:25:06,923 --> 01:25:09,323  X1:280 X2:442 Y1:374 Y2:410
Listen, listen.

1396
01:25:10,594 --> 01:25:12,323  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:374 Y2:410
So what are you up to?

1397
01:25:14,731 --> 01:25:18,667  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
The usual. l'm trying to write.
l'm working on a play.

1398
01:25:20,503 --> 01:25:23,097  X1:128 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you saying you're not coming back
to New York with me?

1399
01:25:24,407 --> 01:25:29,174  X1:298 X2:424 Y1:334 Y2:409
No. Look.
l gotta go.

1400
01:25:29,246 --> 01:25:32,613  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean?
l flew 3,000 miles to see you.

1401
01:25:32,682 --> 01:25:35,446  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
Air miles. Do you know
what that does to my stomach?

1402
01:25:35,518 --> 01:25:37,509  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf you must know,
it's a hectic time for Tony.

1403
01:25:37,587 --> 01:25:39,578  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
- The Grammys are tonight.
- The what?

1404
01:25:39,656 --> 01:25:41,783  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
The Grammys. He's got a lot
of records up for awards.

1405
01:25:41,858 --> 01:25:44,554  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
They give awards for that music?
l thought just ear plugs.

1406
01:25:44,628 --> 01:25:48,189  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just forget it. Let's just
forget the conversation.

1407
01:25:48,265 --> 01:25:51,359  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
They do nothing but give out awards.
l can't believe it.

1408
01:25:51,434 --> 01:25:54,631  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
Greatest Fascist Dictator:
Adolph Hitler.

1409
01:26:24,868 --> 01:26:27,735  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know what you're going to say.
l'm not a great driver.

1410
01:26:27,804 --> 01:26:30,967  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l have some problems with--
- May l see your license, please?

1411
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:33,635  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just don't get angry.

1412
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:37,578  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have my license here.
lt's a rented car.

1413
01:26:39,549 --> 01:26:42,882  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't give me your life's story.

1414
01:26:42,952 --> 01:26:45,216  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just pick up the license.

1415
01:26:45,288 --> 01:26:49,156  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
You have to ask nicely, because
l've had a rough day. My girlfriend--

1416
01:26:49,225 --> 01:26:51,693  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just give me the license, please.

1417
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:56,261  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
Since you put it that way,
it's hard for me to refuse.

1418
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:59,427  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have a terrific problem
with authority.

1419
01:26:59,502 --> 01:27:01,902  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's not your fault.
Don't take it personal.

1420
01:27:10,113 --> 01:27:12,673  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:334 Y2:409
So long, fellows.
Keep in touch.

1421
01:27:22,192 --> 01:27:26,026  X1:238 X2:484 Y1:334 Y2:409
lmagine my surprise
when l got your call.

1422
01:27:26,096 --> 01:27:29,327  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah. l had the feeling
l got you at a bad moment.

1423
01:27:29,399 --> 01:27:31,697  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
l heard high-pitched squealing.

1424
01:27:31,768 --> 01:27:33,235  X1:290 X2:432 Y1:374 Y2:410
Twins, Max.

1425
01:27:34,137 --> 01:27:36,196  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:374 Y2:410
Sixteen-year-olds.

1426
01:27:37,707 --> 01:27:41,438  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
Can you imagine the mathematical
possibilities of that?

1427
01:27:41,511 --> 01:27:45,003  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're an actor. You should be doing
Shakespeare in the park.

1428
01:27:45,081 --> 01:27:48,414  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
l did Shakespeare in the park.
l got mugged.

1429
01:27:48,485 --> 01:27:51,886  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was playing Richard ll. Two guys
with leather jackets stole my leotard.

1430
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:00,759  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are we driving through plutonium?

1431
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:04,288  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
Keeps out the alpha rays.
You don't get old.

1432
01:28:06,569 --> 01:28:09,902  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're a thinking person.
How can you choose this lifestyle?

1433
01:28:09,973 --> 01:28:12,703  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:374 Y2:410
What is so great about New York?

1434
01:28:12,776 --> 01:28:15,973  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a dying city.
You read Death in Venice.

1435
01:28:16,045 --> 01:28:18,445  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
You didn't read Death in Venice
until l gave it to you.

1436
01:28:18,515 --> 01:28:20,847  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
You only give me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1437
01:28:20,917 --> 01:28:24,819  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's an important issue.
- You're incapable of enjoying life.

1438
01:28:24,888 --> 01:28:27,982  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're like New York.
You're an island.

1439
01:28:28,057 --> 01:28:31,686  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
Okay. lf that's all that we've been
through together means to you...

1440
01:28:31,761 --> 01:28:35,424  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
it's better if we just said good-bye,
once and for all.

1441
01:28:35,498 --> 01:28:37,022  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's funny.

1442
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:39,500  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
After all the serious talks
and passionate moments...

1443
01:28:39,569 --> 01:28:43,096  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
that it ends here, in a health food
restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

1444
01:28:43,873 --> 01:28:46,273  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
Good-bye, Sally.

1445
01:28:46,342 --> 01:28:50,779  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wait.
l'm going to go with you.

1446
01:28:50,847 --> 01:28:52,815  X1:302 X2:420 Y1:374 Y2:410
l love you.

1447
01:28:56,219 --> 01:28:59,120  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you want?
lt was my first play.

1448
01:28:59,189 --> 01:29:02,249  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know how you're always trying to
get things to come out perfect in art...

1449
01:29:02,325 --> 01:29:05,556  X1:168 X2:553 Y1:374 Y2:410
because it's real difficult in life.

1450
01:29:05,628 --> 01:29:10,190  X1:211 X2:510 Y1:334 Y2:409
lnterestingly, however,
l did run into Annie again.

1451
01:29:10,266 --> 01:29:12,325  X1:179 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.

1452
01:29:12,402 --> 01:29:16,133  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
She had moved back to New York.
She was living in Soho with some guy.

1453
01:29:16,206 --> 01:29:20,302  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
When l met her, she was dragging him
in to see The Sorrow and the Pity...

1454
01:29:20,376 --> 01:29:22,970  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
which l counted
as a personal triumph.

1455
01:29:23,046 --> 01:29:25,810  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
Annie and l had lunch
sometime after that...

1456
01:29:25,882 --> 01:29:29,909  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:374 Y2:410
and just kicked around old times.

1457
01:29:29,986 --> 01:29:34,116  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just to have my arms

1458
01:29:36,192 --> 01:29:38,217  X1:291 X2:431 Y1:374 Y2:410
Around you

1459
01:29:41,865 --> 01:29:45,392  X1:283 X2:438 Y1:374 Y2:410
Still the thrill

1460
01:29:46,002 --> 01:29:49,267  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
That it was the day

1461
01:29:49,339 --> 01:29:51,637  X1:294 X2:427 Y1:374 Y2:410
l found you

1462
01:29:52,542 --> 01:29:55,807  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1463
01:29:58,047 --> 01:30:02,814  X1:303 X2:419 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1464
01:30:05,421 --> 01:30:10,825  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:374 Y2:410
Dinner dates and flowers

1465
01:30:13,663 --> 01:30:15,688  X1:303 X2:419 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1466
01:30:17,133 --> 01:30:20,000  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
After that, it got late
and we both had to go.

1467
01:30:20,069 --> 01:30:22,264  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:374 Y2:410
But it was great seeing Annie again.

1468
01:30:22,338 --> 01:30:25,068  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
l realize
what a terrific person she was...

1469
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:28,008  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
and how much fun it was
just knowing her.

1470
01:30:28,077 --> 01:30:31,740  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:374 Y2:410
And l thought of that old joke.

1471
01:30:31,814 --> 01:30:36,649  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
This guy goes to a psychiatrist
and says, "Doc, my brother's crazy.

1472
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:39,313  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:374 Y2:410
He thinks he's a chicken."

1473
01:30:39,389 --> 01:30:41,687  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
The doctor says,
"Why don't you turn him in?"

1474
01:30:41,758 --> 01:30:44,818  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
The guy says,
"l would, but l need the eggs."

1475
01:30:44,894 --> 01:30:49,456  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, l guess that's, now, how l feel
about relationships.

1476
01:30:49,532 --> 01:30:54,560  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
They're totally irrational,
crazy and absurd.

1477
01:30:54,637 --> 01:30:57,629  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:374 Y2:410
But l guess we keep going through it...

1478
01:30:57,707 --> 01:31:00,904  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:374 Y2:410
because most of us need the eggs.
