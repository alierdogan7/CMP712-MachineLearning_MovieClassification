00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:06,034
Aah!

3
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:07,605
Cassie.

4
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:14,757
I'm sorry
about your mom.

5
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:14,695
Thanks.
Have you seen her yet?

6
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:16,030
She got in yesterday.

7
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:17,465
It's ok, Cassie.

8
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:20,034
We're different.
You're different.

9
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:23,421
You're a witch. You're
a full blooded, 100% witch.

10
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,205
There's no such thing
as witches and magic.

11
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:27,207
Are you doing this?

12
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:29,143
We are.

13
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:36,650
With her here, we
have real power now.

14
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:40,438
Each family
has a book,

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,857
a journal that lays down each
family line.

16
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:45,109
A complete circle is 6.

17
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,527
You complete
the circle.

18
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:47,695
Now we're whole.

19
00:00:47,697 --> 00:00:49,163
You are seriously
messed up.

20
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:50,731
She's got the gift.

21
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:53,868
Are you sure you can get
Cassie to do what we need?

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,121
The circle will take care of that
without even knowing it.

23
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:03,761
My sweet Cassie,

24
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,763
I didn't want you
to have this life,

25
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,249
but destiny's not
easy to run from.

26
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:15,773
You have incredible power
inside you.

27
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,593
People will come for it.

28
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:21,762
They will come for you.

29
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:29,537
I hoped that keeping this secret
would keep you safe,

30
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,956
but all I've done
is left you unprotected.

31
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,794
I know how alone
you must feel,

32
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,579
but be careful
who you trust,

33
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,998
even people who
call themselves friends.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,618
Your power is the only thing
that can keep you safe.

35
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,945
Give me light.

36
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,787
Ok.

37
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:23,857
Give me light.

38
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:36,303
Give me light.

You got to go.

42
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:25,758
Come on, my aunt's
a Jesus freak.

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,427
Fine.

44
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,965
Did things work out
with Cassie and you girls?

45
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:35,935
Us girls?
You're a part of this, too.

46
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:39,021
No. We think Faye's monsoon
scared the crap out of her.

47
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:41,858
So are we binding
the circle or not?

48
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,592
I guess not.

49
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:45,361
I mean, Faye says
it's a bad idea anyway.

50
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:47,196
Do you always listen
to Faye?

51
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:50,032
No. Otherwise
I wouldn't be here.

52
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:52,034
And, you know what,
can you keep this quiet, ok?

53
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:54,203
I don't want anyone knowing we
hooked up, so don't go bragging.

54
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:56,572
I'm gonna brag
about you?

55
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,992
You're an ass.

56
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:16,759
Please.

57
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:21,230
Do you own a shirt?

58
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:31,290
Ok, curtains,
you can close now.

59
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:36,529
Close, now!

60
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,258
Hey, want some
breakfast?

61
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,943
No, I'm late.

62
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,278
Everything ok?

63
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,864
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just frazzled.

64
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,649
Cassie, I know
this isn't easy.

65
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:01,901
Losing your mother,
moving away from home.

66
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,986
But I'm here

67
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,773
if you want
to talk about anything.

68
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,711
I really am late.

69
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,995
What's the racket
outside?

70
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:48,581
Sea fair.
It's this weekend.

71
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,749
They're setting up.

72
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:51,834
We're out of steelhead
and mussels.

73
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:54,086
No, we're not.
I already called them in.

74
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,876
So what's going on
between you and Diana's dad?

75
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:02,495
Hmm?

76
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:04,714
You two almost
went to blows.

77
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:07,967
Charles Meade's a punk.
He's always been a punk.

78
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:11,471
Well, that punk is also a lawyer
on the town council, Dad.

79
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:14,140
So it's probably not
the best idea to piss him off.

80
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:16,442
And he's Diana's father.

81
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,396
So, please just try
and make an effort, ok?

82
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,656
Faye, we're late.

83
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:33,259
You don't have to shout.

84
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,693
Is that what
you're wearing?

85
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:35,962
Do you love it?
It's new.

86
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:38,047
Exactly how I don't
want you to dress.

87
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,532
You could stand
to lose a button.

88
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:41,200
I'm the principal.
I have to be buttoned.

89
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:44,086
Well, then live vicariously
through me.

90
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,044
Granddaddy!

91
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:53,513
Hey, there, kitten.

92
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:54,814
What are you
doing here?

93
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:57,099
It's lonely up at the lake
all by myself.

94
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:59,101
Dawn.

95
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:02,221
Henry.

96
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:03,940
How long
you staying?

97
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:05,107
I'm not sure yet.

98
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,559
I have some business
to take care of.

99
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,661
You're retired.

100
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:10,102
And I wanted to see
my granddaughter

101
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:11,527
and daughter-in-law.

102
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,835
Well, I'm happy
to see you.

103
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:18,737
So long.

104
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,907
Is everything ok?

105
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,260
If it's not,
I'll let you know.

106
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:27,547
Well, you're welcome
to stay as long as you'd like.

107
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:31,350
That's gracious of you,
being it's my home.

108
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,067
Hi, there.
I'm Sally Matthews, class President.

109
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:50,036
Oh, hi. Cassie.

110
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:51,153
The new girl.

111
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,738
I just wanted
to welcome you

112
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,156
and see if you
needed anything.

113
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,942
Anything...social,
extracurricular, I'm your girl.

114
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,995
And if you're not
doing anything tomorrow,

115
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:00,496
you should come
to the fair.

116
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:01,881
I'm in charge of
the school raffle,

117
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:03,583
and we really need
new band uniforms.

118
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:05,084
I could really use
the help.

119
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:07,003
It's a great way
to meet people.

120
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,787
- Ok, sure.
- Ok.

121
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,673
She's been here
for 5 minutes,

122
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,174
don't torture
the girl yet.

123
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:13,593
We're talking, Faye.

124
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:15,628
And I'm
interrupting, Sally.

125
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,631
That Sally Matthews
talks more than I can listen.

126
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,600
Look, I want
to apologize

127
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:22,134
for what happened
on the dock with the storm.

128
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:23,486
Things got a little
out of hand.

129
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,471
I wanted to thank
you for stopping it.

130
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:28,024
With you here,
our powers are magnified,

131
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:31,110
and it's awesome, but
we have to practice a little.

132
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,913
Has Diana gotten to you yet
about binding the circle?

133
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,998
- Not yet.
- Just say no.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,584
It is exactly what
we don't want to do.

135
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,002
Why not?

136
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:42,288
It links us together,
all 6 of us.

137
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,206
We won't have
individual power.

138
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,993
It'll become a factious circle with
control freak Diana as dictator.

139
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,796
And I don't want someone telling me
what to eat for lunch,

140
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,632
much less what parade
I can rain on, you know.

141
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,684
No, I don't.
I don't know you,

142
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:57,053
I don't want to know you,
and I don't want any part of this,

143
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:58,721
so you need
to leave me alone.

144
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:00,389
Understand?

145
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,699
Charles Meade.

146
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,951
- Why is Henry in town?
- I don't know.

147
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:13,869
He's your father-in-law,
not mine.

148
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:15,905
Could he be onto us?
I doubt that.

149
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:17,623
We were very careful.
We covered our tracks.

150
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,875
I don't like him here.
I don't trust him at all.

151
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:21,544
You just don't like him.

152
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,028
'Cause he doesn't like me.

153
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,214
He blames me for Tom's death,
like it was my fault.

154
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,216
We all have to blame
someone.

155
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:30,136
Keep your eyes open.

156
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:37,727
So I have two big rules
in my classroom.

157
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:41,847
Rule number one...
do not breathe in the vapors

158
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,716
of these chemicals.

159
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:46,051
Rule number two...
always wear goggles.

160
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,225
Ok, let's get it started.

161
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,694
Got a big day today.

162
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:57,113
First and foremost,
safety goggles on, please.

163
00:09:57,115 --> 00:10:01,567
Afterwards, I want you to pour
300 milliliters of solution "A"

164
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:05,121
and two drops of solution "B"
into your beakers, please.

165
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:09,258
Now, take in mind that many of
these carbonates are very toxic,

166
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,744
which, for those you
who don't know,

167
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:13,579
that means dangerous.

168
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:15,631
Now, remember that
the point of this experiment

169
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:18,134
is to compare the reactivity
of these different metal carbonates...

170
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,857
Fire without flame
bring me heat.

171
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:27,593
- What are you doing?
- Experimenting. Try it.

172
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:29,228
Fire without flame...

173
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,147
Bring me heat.

174
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,233
- Fire without flame...
- Bring me heat.

175
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,953
Ohh.

176
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,741
As you can see, it's a white salt

177
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:43,959
soluble in water,
and it's found in bleach,

178
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:46,078
and it's used as well in the
production of soap and glass.

179
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,330
It's also the primary
component of potash...

180
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:10,102
Ohh!

181
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:23,282
Is anyone hurt?

182
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:33,325
Cassie. Cassie,
wait a minute.

183
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:34,844
I did that.

184
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:36,846
I got mad and that's
what happened.

185
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:39,164
I didn't mean to.

186
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,767
Why is this happening?

187
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:42,968
How do I stop it?

188
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,137
That's the thing,
you can't.

189
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:51,727
But if you let me,
I can help.

190
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,592
Why do you guys
come here?

191
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:03,243
Because
no one else does.

192
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:04,678
Condemned buildings
are like that.

193
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,132
Well, it's important
that no one find out about us.

194
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:10,684
Especially our families.

195
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:16,056
How did you discover...
we're witches?

196
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:18,392
Diana found her mom's
Book of Shadows.

197
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:20,811
That's how we know
about all of us.

198
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:23,530
She's the only one
with a book?

199
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:25,366
Technically each family
has a book,

200
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:27,701
but hers is the only one
we have access to.

201
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,536
Why?

202
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:31,538
Because witchcraft
is forbidden.

203
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,773
It was abolished.

204
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:34,575
Because of what happened
years ago.

205
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:37,878
It's when my mom died.

206
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,080
And Diana's mom.

207
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:42,416
Faye's dad.
Melissa's mom.

208
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:45,753
Nick lost both
of his parents.

209
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:50,874
And my dad.

210
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:55,462
I don't know much
about him.

211
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:58,315
Just that there was
some big accident.

212
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:00,491
Well, the official story
was some teens were

213
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:01,816
partying on an old boat

214
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:04,137
and there was a fire.

215
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,739
Some didn't get out.

216
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,741
A fire.

217
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:10,611
Diana thinks it's because
they didn't bind the circle.

218
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:12,746
I don't understand.

219
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:15,699
Every witch is born
into a circle.

220
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,534
Ours is made up of
our 6 families.

221
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:21,154
The circle has more power
than any one person can handle.

222
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:23,590
Binding it is the only way
we can utilize the power,

223
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:25,092
but keep it controlled.

224
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,261
Faye says that it will
link us together.

225
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:30,163
Yes. It will limit
our individual abilities,

226
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,832
but strengthen us
as a group.

227
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,435
That way no one
can have too much power.

228
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:37,704
It's like living
in a Harry Potter movie.

229
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:40,774
He has a wand.

230
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:43,444
It is not all bad.

231
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:45,512
Just let me show you.

232
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:51,201
He used a Signa spell.

233
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:53,370
I nearly drown on
the floor of my own bar.

234
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:54,822
You were drunk.

235
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,141
I could tell when
you called me last night.

236
00:13:57,143 --> 00:14:01,161
I'd been drinking.
I wasn't drunk.

237
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:02,696
He used magic.

238
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:05,299
He tried to threaten me,
Henry.

239
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:07,084
It's impossible.

240
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:09,536
Everyone in your circle
was stripped of their power.

241
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:13,807
I know.
Believe me, I know.

242
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:16,310
But he's figured out
a way around that.

243
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:18,729
Why would he be
threatening you?

244
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:22,766
I was talking to
Cassie Blake about her mother.

245
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:25,552
He was worried I would
say something stupid.

246
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:26,720
Did you?

247
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:30,407
No.

248
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,526
Of course not.

249
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:38,832
Hey.

250
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,250
Diana,
what happened?

251
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:41,401
Adam took
the blame.

252
00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:42,586
He said he mixed
the chemicals

253
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:43,787
and miscalculated
the chloride.

254
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:45,238
And Mr. Herman
believed him?

255
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,507
He couldn't explain
it any better.

256
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,408
Faye, we got lucky.
No one was hurt.

257
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,544
Now, when are you
gonna get it through your head,

258
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:52,212
we have to bind
the circle.

259
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:53,347
Have fun.

260
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:54,631
Can't you talk
to her?

261
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:56,266
Maybe we should bind it.

262
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,768
I don't like all this stray energy
floating around.

263
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,303
No.

264
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:00,754
Not if it means
we'll be linked.

265
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:02,589
I don't want you to have
a say in what I do.

266
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:04,391
I don't want you
to control me.

267
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:05,726
But we'll have
more strength as a group

268
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:07,394
and can use it
better.

269
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,646
For what, world peace?
Are we gonna save the turtles?

270
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,281
Why can't we just
enjoy it?

271
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,616
Because it's selfish
and dangerous.

272
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,034
Yes, and I'm good
with that.

273
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:16,987
In fact,
I'm great with it.

274
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:39,593
Ok, what's this?

275
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:44,565
Some spells in Diana's book
requires certain herbs

276
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,299
and roots.

277
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:49,903
We've been experimenting.

278
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:08,672
Are you crazy?

279
00:16:08,674 --> 00:16:11,324
It's grounded.
I'm holding it right now.

280
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:14,327
Trust me.

281
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,699
Take my hand.

282
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:43,740
Heh.

283
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,527
Energy is flowing
from the battery,

284
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,131
through you, to me,

285
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,367
to this.

286
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,886
Heh.

287
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,841
Try it by yourself.

288
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:07,981
Just concentrate
on the energy.

289
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:13,520
Feel the flow
inside you.

290
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,889
Focus.

291
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:20,393
Ok. Breathe...

292
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:24,247
Slow, deep breaths.

293
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:25,749
Look at me.

294
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:50,607
This is a bad idea.

295
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:53,193
- I'm...I'm sorry.
- No. It's my fault.

296
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:55,979
I shouldn't have come.

297
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,763
* I'm-a gonna let go *

298
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:30,766
* I'm-a gonna waste some time *

299
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:34,269
* oh, my, my, my, oh *

300
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:35,804
* you-a gonna say so... *

301
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,260
Oh, uh,
there's Sally.

302
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:37,924
Are you gonna be ok
without me?

303
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,538
Of course. Have fun.
I'll see you at home.

304
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,386
- Hey.
- Hi.

305
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,085
I didn't think
you'd come.

306
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:45,532
I figured
Faye turned you against me.

307
00:18:45,534 --> 00:18:47,214
Faye turned me
against Faye.

308
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:50,228
Well, we just became friends
in this moment.

309
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,825
So what do I need to do?

310
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,790
It's super easy.
You just have to sell tickets.

311
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:55,039
Ok. Great.

312
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,954
Easy's exactly
what I need today.

313
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:59,367
* Burned, burned,
burned, oh *

314
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,347
* on and on and on *

315
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,262
* the lights goes
off and on *

316
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:09,057
* on and on and on *

317
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:13,053
* dare you to,
but don't you dare *

318
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:15,883
* when you come down,
I'll be there *

319
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:18,013
* when I come down,
we'll play fair *

320
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,329
* I'm not cold,
I'm just a-shakin'... *

321
00:19:19,331 --> 00:19:20,844
Boo.

322
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:21,992
I win.

323
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,341
He broke
my concentration.

324
00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:25,172
Ok, I'm bored.

325
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:27,004
Let's turn it up
a notch.

326
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:29,168
Follow me, ladies.

327
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,247
* On and on and on *

328
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:36,360
* the light goes off
and on *

329
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:38,608
- Hey, Cassie.
- Oh. Hee hee.

330
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,323
How did you get
roped into volunteering?

331
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:43,968
I'm here for
the distraction.

332
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,816
Adam told me
you guys practiced last night.

333
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:51,760
I'm happy to help
some time if you want.

334
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:54,008
The thing is,
we need you.

335
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,955
We can't be a circle
without you.

336
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:58,719
I'm sorry. You're gonna have
to find someone else.

337
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:00,218
There is
no one else.

338
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,948
You're one of
the 6 families.

339
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,114
I thought you
understood that.

340
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,163
No, I don't understand
any of this.

341
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:06,877
What you're asking
is ludicrous.

342
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,107
I can't just blindly
agree to it.

343
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,373
I know it's a lot
to accept.

344
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,770
It's too much.
I can't.

345
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:14,069
You're scared.

346
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:15,867
Of course I'm scared.
Who wouldn't be?

347
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,948
Look, I...

348
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,595
I have a feeling,
and then things explode.

349
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,610
Which is why we need
to bind the circle.

350
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:25,256
Our energies are flying
everywhere all at once

351
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,921
with no rhyme
or reason.

352
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:30,385
We have to contain it before
someone gets really hurt.

353
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:36,261
I'm sorry. I don't think that
I can help you.

354
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:44,904
Please note that no
black cauldron was used in

355
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:46,445
the making of this potion.

356
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:47,949
Open up.

357
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,196
Mmm.
What's in it?

358
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:51,745
All natural herbs
and spices.

359
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:53,059
Just boiled down to liquid.

360
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:54,275
I tasted them.
And...

361
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:55,774
And you got this
from Diana's book?

362
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,106
Will it work?

363
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:01,600
Are you gonna
try it?

364
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:02,849
No, I'm good.
Thanks.

365
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,846
So what do I tell
Diana, huh?

366
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,511
She won't stop with
the binding ritual crap.

367
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:09,841
You tell her to shove her ritual
up her hoo-ha.

368
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:15,635
Everything's been out of whack
since Cassie got here.

369
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:17,999
You know she busted my window,
completely shattered it.

370
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,464
You know, I think
we should listen to Diana.

371
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:20,879
She's the one with
the rule book.

372
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:22,961
We just need
to practice more.

373
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:26,190
More power requires
more practice.

374
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:28,687
You started a monsoon
and couldn't stop it.

375
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:32,067
Oh. Could we all
just let that go?

376
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:45,103
Mmm.

377
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:01,002
Enjoying yourself,
Henry?

378
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:04,647
Ethan Conant said Charles Meade
threatened him with magic.

379
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,609
He said Charles used
the signa on him

380
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:12,805
when he overheard him talking to
Cassie Blake about her mother.

381
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:14,471
I don't believe it.

382
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:16,402
Ethan isn't exactly
a reliable source.

383
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:17,633
He's an alcoholic.

384
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:20,131
And Charles, he doesn't
have any power.

385
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,480
None of us do.

386
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:23,428
Your circle took care
of that.

387
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,125
I'd be inclined
to agree with you,

388
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:26,757
except I've witnessed it.

389
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,386
Henry, nobody
is practicing.

390
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:31,618
Those days are over.

391
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,548
The children.
I saw them today.

392
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,579
Your own daughter
is one of them.

393
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:38,794
Faye?

394
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:40,375
With the Blake girl
back in town,

395
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,041
they have a complete circle.

396
00:22:42,043 --> 00:22:44,371
They can awaken
to their full potential.

397
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:45,936
We have to stop them.

398
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:47,434
They don't know
anything.

399
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:49,482
We've kept this
from them.

400
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:51,397
I'm gonna take care of it.

401
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:54,310
I swore I would never let what
happened to your circle

402
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:55,558
ever happen again.

403
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,939
Henry, stop.

404
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:00,470
Look, I know we've
had our differences,

405
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:02,584
but I lost my husband.

406
00:23:02,586 --> 00:23:05,931
I'm not about to let something
happen to Faye.

407
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,412
Let me help you.

408
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:13,123
Tell me what I can do.

409
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,785
What were you thinking?

410
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,399
That he wouldn't
say anything?

411
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:20,831
Use your head.

412
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,663
I may have gone
too far,

413
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:25,393
but we can't have Ethan running
his mouth off about Amelia.

414
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:27,657
He could blow it for us.

415
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,822
No, you've already
taken care of that.

416
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:31,603
What are we gonna do
about Henry?

417
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:34,233
You're not gonna do anything
except give me that crystal.

418
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:36,647
That is all the power
we have.

419
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,711
If we use it up,
we have nothing.

420
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:40,310
We can't waste it.

421
00:23:40,312 --> 00:23:41,925
Ok.

422
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:45,670
You made your point.

423
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,714
Look, I get it.

424
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:53,845
It feels good
to do magic again.

425
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:55,743
It's seductive.

426
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:58,907
But we have to be
smart, Charles.

427
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,402
Just think of
the bigger picture.

428
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,181
Hey, Cassie.

429
00:24:31,182 --> 00:24:32,779
Hey.

430
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:34,611
How you doing?

431
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:40,937
Um, the other night you were
telling me about my mom.

432
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,433
You caught me drinking.

433
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:47,513
I'm sorry if I said
anything inappropriate.

434
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:50,493
You said our
families are aligned.

435
00:24:50,495 --> 00:24:51,925
What did you mean?

436
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:56,653
There's this old legend
about our families.

437
00:24:56,655 --> 00:25:00,782
Some astrological lore
about the two of us

438
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:03,495
on some collision course
of destiny.

439
00:25:03,497 --> 00:25:05,360
It's silly.

440
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:07,857
I've never really believed
in astrology.

441
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:09,522
Me either.

442
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:12,819
To be honest,

443
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:17,097
I just know that whenever
I was around your mother

444
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,428
I'd get this feeling.

445
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,056
This attraction to her
that was impossible to ignore.

446
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:27,053
All she had to do
was look at me

447
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:30,916
and smile just right,
and I'd light up inside.

448
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,745
No one else could do that.

449
00:25:37,342 --> 00:25:39,956
Like I said...

450
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,620
It's silly.

451
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:46,615
Uh, no.
Not at all.

452
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:54,873
* I can't believe
I can't let it go *

453
00:25:58,553 --> 00:25:59,767
* difference made... *

454
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:01,133
Hey.

455
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,793
Hey.

456
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,503
So I've been asked to come
over here and convince you

457
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,232
to bind the circle.

458
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:18,663
Yeah. She kind of
struck out.

459
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:19,828
Yeah.

460
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,275
Yeah, so I heard.

461
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:29,018
What did you tell
Diana about last night?

462
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:34,679
That I showed you how to focus
and harness your energy.

463
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:37,975
She's ok with that.

464
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:46,333
Does it always feel
like last night?

465
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:55,823
There's always some
physical reaction.

466
00:26:55,825 --> 00:27:00,867
You know what I mean.

467
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,276
Ok, so if we bind
the circle,

468
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:11,139
then we'll be able
to control it better?

469
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:13,104
Yes.

470
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:16,716
No more exploding
light bulbs or floating water?

471
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:23,459
I don't think so.

472
00:27:35,313 --> 00:27:36,778
Look at them.

473
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,108
They're like little
goldfish stuck together.

474
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,972
Shut up, Faye.

475
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:44,735
Seriously, Diana, you are two
minutes away from losing him.

476
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:46,484
I want to bind
the circle tonight.

477
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:47,682
I'm busy.

478
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:50,013
Faye, use your head.
You know we have to.

479
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:52,793
Oh, I'd prioritize
if I were you.

480
00:27:52,795 --> 00:27:55,840
You've got a bigger problem.

481
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:27,589
Stop groping.
It's not gonna happen.

482
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:29,303
Why are you fighting?
Just go with it.

483
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:32,351
Do you honestly think that
I would get with you?

484
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:33,716
Ha ha.

485
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:45,003
Would you hit that?

486
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:47,450
I'd have to leave
my self-esteem at the door.

487
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,184
Hey, Cassie.
What you doing?

488
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:04,015
I'm looking
for Sally.

489
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:05,264
She's a bore.

490
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:07,378
Hey, what do you say
you and me do a little magic?

491
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,544
I don't think so.

492
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,208
Like start another storm.

493
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,423
This time you start it
and I'll stop it.

494
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:13,971
That's not funny.
You could have killed somebody

495
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:15,137
with that storm.

496
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:16,884
Fine, we'll do
something else then.

497
00:29:16,886 --> 00:29:18,832
You pick.
Think big.

498
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:20,964
Get away from me.

499
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:23,794
You did that.

500
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:26,524
You're a little fire cracker,
aren't you, Cassie?

501
00:29:26,526 --> 00:29:28,522
I don't want to
start this with you.

502
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:33,849
Faye, please, don't.

503
00:29:33,851 --> 00:29:36,812
Come on, it's a total rush
and you know it.

504
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:39,443
- It's too risky.
- Then stop me.

505
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:43,939
Stop it.

506
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:48,000
Stop it!

507
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:51,846
Excuse me,

508
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:53,345
little miss telekinesis.

509
00:29:53,347 --> 00:29:54,877
Hey, what's going on?

510
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:56,791
Not now, Sally.

511
00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:58,289
Yes, now, Faye.

512
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:01,087
I am so sick of your
superiority complex.

513
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:03,117
Ok, Sally, why
don't we just...

514
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,832
Get off, Faye.

515
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,646
No. You go away.

516
00:30:23,962 --> 00:30:25,643
Faye, what did you do?

517
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:31,054
She's not breathing!

518
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,801
Somebody call
an ambulance.

519
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,805
I called already.
They're on their way.

520
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:48,202
Step back.
Ok, ok.

521
00:30:48,204 --> 00:30:50,374
Step back.

522
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,832
It's ok. It's ok.
No, no, no. Don't move.

523
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:31,199
You used
the crystal.

524
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,238
I thought we weren't
gonna waste it.

525
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,863
We don't kill
innocent children.

526
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:41,835
You have a very interesting
set of rules there, Dawn.

527
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:44,307
You'll have to
explain them to me sometime.

528
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:48,181
It was Faye's fault.
She's my daughter.

529
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:51,720
That kind of guilt
would have destroyed her.

530
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:55,779
What would you have done
if it were Diana?

531
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:07,317
The paramedic said
she's gonna be ok.

532
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:15,749
I didn't mean for
anyone to get hurt.

533
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:19,054
I really didn't.

534
00:32:20,826 --> 00:32:23,580
With you here,
we can do more.

535
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:26,836
I just have to will
things and they happen.

536
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:29,458
We can't let our feelings
control us like this.

537
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:32,396
But I like...

538
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:39,159
I don't want this
to go away.

539
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:47,657
We don't have a choice.

540
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:50,096
It's too dangerous.

541
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:53,268
If we can't control
what we feel or what we think,

542
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,506
we're just gonna keep
hurting people.

543
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:58,595
I don't want to be
connected to you

544
00:32:58,597 --> 00:33:00,533
anymore than you
want to be to me.

545
00:33:02,286 --> 00:33:04,239
But no one else
can get hurt.

546
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:06,326
It's wrong.

547
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,334
Diana's right.

548
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:13,890
We have to bind the circle.

549
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:18,899
We'll be at
the beach at midnight.

550
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,180
It was Charles
that threw me.

551
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:38,936
At first I thought he pushed
the children to form a circle

552
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:43,111
and then used their power
to somehow reestablish his.

553
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:47,135
But then I realized
Charles Meade is many things,

554
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:49,840
clever is not
one of them.

555
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:52,545
And then I saw you.

556
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,089
You couldn't have saved that
girl tonight without a crystal.

557
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:01,145
Where'd you get it?
They were all destroyed.

558
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:04,969
It's wrong of you
to strip us of our power.

559
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:07,056
There was a time
for witchcraft.

560
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,927
Time is long gone.

561
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,115
There's no place for it
in this world anymore.

562
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:15,171
You've forgotten
what it feels like.

563
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:18,310
How long has it been
since you practiced, 15 years?

564
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:20,949
This circle
is different.

565
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:25,122
You know what can be unleashed
if they bind together.

566
00:34:25,124 --> 00:34:26,960
I'm going to
the elders tomorrow

567
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:29,447
and tell them what's
going on here.

568
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,451
Give me the crystal.

569
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:48,032
You know, Henry,
I've got a better idea.

570
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:54,661
I think you should go back
to the lake and take it easy.

571
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:01,591
It'd be awful if you had
another heart attack.

572
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:12,144
You might not
survive it this time.

573
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:20,242
You should know...

574
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:26,620
I loved your son.

575
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,736
* I'm still wondering *

576
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:49,456
* After all this time *

577
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:53,631
* turning over leaves *

578
00:35:53,633 --> 00:36:00,610
* that everything falls off,
oh, so easy.. *

579
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,618
I'll get the book,
you drive Cassie to the beach.

580
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,624
Ok.

581
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:12,145
Well, you did it.

582
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:15,451
You convinced her
to bind the circle with us.

583
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:18,373
I don't know what to do expect.
Do you?

584
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,192
No, not really.

585
00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:23,349
So how do we know
it'll work?

586
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:24,785
I don't know, Adam.

587
00:36:24,788 --> 00:36:26,789
I just found
the stupid book.

588
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:30,662
I didn't go looking for it.
I don't know anymore than you

589
00:36:30,664 --> 00:36:32,733
or anyone else.

590
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:37,408
What's going on?

591
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,928
Nothing.

592
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:47,577
I don't know
what I'm doing.

593
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:52,136
I pretend like I do,
but...

594
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:59,734
Do I have anything to worry
about with you and Cassie?

595
00:37:00,737 --> 00:37:02,789
Why would you
ask that?

596
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:06,663
Because I'm insecure.

597
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:10,169
And I love you.

598
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:14,979
Come here.

599
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,440
I love you, too.

600
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:46,904
You're home.

601
00:37:49,578 --> 00:37:52,632
Your grandfather drove back to
the lake tonight.

602
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:55,920
He said to tell you
good-bye.

603
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:58,559
What happened
tonight?

604
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:01,147
Were you drinking?

605
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:09,446
Things got a little
out of hand.

606
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:14,756
I'm the high school
principal in this town.

607
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:17,027
It's how people see me.

608
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:18,930
What do you think runs
through their minds

609
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:20,500
after something
like tonight?

610
00:38:20,502 --> 00:38:24,023
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

611
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:26,594
You embarrassed
yourself.

612
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,446
Come here.

613
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:41,172
That girl could have
been you tonight.

614
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:48,820
Everything's gonna
be ok, mom.

615
00:38:57,704 --> 00:38:59,790
Get in.
I'll take you there.

616
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,626
I'm good.

617
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:04,682
Seriously,
I want to walk.

618
00:39:04,684 --> 00:39:06,502
I like it.

619
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:08,055
It's a nice night.

620
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:09,558
Come on,
we're friends now.

621
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,647
Sure. Friends bound
for eternity.

622
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:14,516
Totally normal.

623
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,738
It's the right thing
to do, you know.

624
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,124
For all of us.

625
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:22,531
I hope so.

626
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:25,838
So, ok, friend thing
settled.

627
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,343
Get in already.

628
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:29,980
The beach
is 2 miles away,

629
00:39:29,982 --> 00:39:33,151
and I promised Diana
I'd bring you.

630
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:02,624
["Victory Dance" by
My Morning Jacket playing]

631
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:14,128
* Should I lift the dirt
and plant the seed *

632
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:17,401
* even though
I've never grown *

633
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:21,575
* should I wet the ground
with the sweat from my brow *

634
00:40:21,577 --> 00:40:24,998
* and believe in
my good work *

635
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,990
* my good work *

636
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:38,006
* my good work *

637
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:43,483
* my good work... *

638
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:48,576
Fire, earth, metal, air, water,
and blood.

639
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:50,797
By these elements,
we bind the circle

640
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:53,218
and follow in the footsteps
of our ancestors

641
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,837
who pledged
themselves to fight

642
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,041
against the forces
of darkness.

643
00:40:57,043 --> 00:41:01,265
When evil assails us,
when fear weakens us,

644
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:04,271
when descent
threatens us,

645
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:07,861
in the circle we will
find out power.

646
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:11,953
We come to this place
alone, but leave bound as one.

647
00:41:11,955 --> 00:41:16,410
With this oath,
our journey begins together.

648
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:19,266
Do you accept the circle?

649
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,188
I accept.
