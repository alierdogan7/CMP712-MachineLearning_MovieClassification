518
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:52,358
And it's just... It's all 
happening really quickly.

519
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,487
I just felt like we were...
we've been together for a long time.

520
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,657
Itjust felt so easy,

521
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,784
and I felt like, um...

522
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,870
I felt like I was me.

523
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,872
I didn't feel like I was...

524
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,960
...trying to be somebody else.

525
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,404
When is your rent coming up
at the motel?

526
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,739
What do you mean?

527
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:47,955
I think you should go and bring 
all your stuff over here.

528
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,916
Sera.

529
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,924
- Sera, you are crazy.
- So?

530
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,761
Don't you think you'll get
a little bored living with a drunk?

531
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:09,476
- That's what I want.
- You haven't seen the worst of it.

532
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,230
These last few days,
I've been very controlled.

533
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:17,985
I knock things over
and throw up all the time.

534
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:25,117
Right now, I feel really good.

535
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:33,375
You're like an antidote that mixes
with the liquor and keeps me in balance.

536
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,295
But that won't last forever.

537
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,716
OK.

538
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,804
All right, you go back 
to your motel.

539
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,183
I'll go back to my glamorous life
of being alone.

540
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,483
The only thing I have to come home to
is a bottle of mouthwash

541
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,027
to take the taste of come
out of my mouth.

542
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,656
I'm tired of being alone.

543
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,408
That's what I'm tired of.

544
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,713
[Toilet flushes]

545
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,516
Don't you like me, Ben?

546
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,103
Sera...

547
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,524
What you don't understand is...
No. See? No.

548
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,442
What?

549
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:48,701
You can never, never

550
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,996
ask me to stop drinking.

551
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,040
Do you understand?

552
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,878
I do.

553
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,339
I really do.

554
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,405
Yes, I'm nuts about you.

555
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,241
OK?

556
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,818
[Man] We didn't know...

557
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,404
He has been here
for about half an hour.

558
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:11,742
- I know that...
- Mickey had seen you two together.

559
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,079
I was not about to open the door.
I don't know who, I don't know where,

560
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,415
I don't know what,
I don't know whatever these days.

561
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,918
- He's my friend.
- I'm sorry.

562
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,420
He must have had
a little too much to drink.

563
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,800
That's why I had him patch the key code.
Because he's not gonna do it.

564
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,761
I'll help him inside.
Thank you so much.

565
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,930
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- No trouble.

566
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,433
You just give me a call
if you need any help.

567
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,394
[Sera] Ben, can you wake up?

568
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,483
Hi.

569
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:48,695
[Sera] We gotta go inside,
but I have some presents for you.

570
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,364
Up we go.

571
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,952
- Here we go.
- This is Mrs. Van Houten.

572
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,578
This is Ben.

573
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,288
Outstanding, sir.

574
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:01,125
All right. Here we go.

575
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,960
- [Man] You're OK?
- [Sera] I'm fine.

576
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,796
- Good.
- I'm so sorry to bother you.

577
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,799
- Thank you for being so nice.
- Sure.

578
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,885
- [Woman] All right.
- Bye-bye.

579
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:17,349
[Ben] Sorry. I was miles away.

580
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,894
The gifts.

581
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,814
Sera.

582
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,816
I love that name.

583
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,986
S-e-r-a.

584
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:33,449
Before we proceed onwards,
there's something I have to say, OK?

585
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,493
OK.

586
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:42,583
I've come this far.
Here I am, in your house.

587
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:48,338
- Let me pay this month's rent.
- No. Why?

588
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,924
Because...

589
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,220
Because it's better
for me that way, OK?

590
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,432
OK.

591
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,314
I'll tell you right now,

592
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,609
I'm in love with you.

593
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:18,243
But, be that as it may,
I am not here

594
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:22,915
to force my twisted soul
into your life.

595
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,500
I know that.

596
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,378
We both know I'm a drunk.

597
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,633
And I know you're a hooker.

598
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,553
I hope you understand
that I'm a person

599
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,223
who is totally at ease with this,

600
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:43,519
which is not to say that
I'm indifferent or I don't care.

601
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,729
I do.

602
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:49,900
It simply means I trust
and accept yourjudgment.

603
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,072
I was really worried
about how that would be,

604
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,991
but now I'm not.

605
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,207
But you should know that included
with the rent around here

606
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,501
is a complimentary blowjob.

607
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,795
Yes.

608
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,757
I suppose sooner or later
we ought to fuck.

609
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,136
Whatever that means.

610
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,392
- Open your presents.
- Presents!

611
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,522
OK. All right.

612
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,651
Open this one first.

613
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,996
Very nice.

614
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,917
This should go very nicely
with my suit,

615
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,169
which, by the way,
is the only item of clothing

616
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,922
I brought over from the 
motel with me.

617
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,509
Oh, right. The suitcase 
was clinking.

618
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,428
What did you do with 
your clothes?

619
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,515
I threw them out,
which was perhaps immoral,

620
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,435
but I wanted to come to you clean,
so to speak.

621
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,605
Thought we'd go shopping
for a pair ofjeans

622
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,775
and 45 pairs of underwear,
and just throw one out each day.

623
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,779
That's nice talk, Ben. 
Keep drinking.

624
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:23,452
Between the 101-proof breath
and the occasional drool,

625
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,371
some interesting words
fall from your mouth.

626
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,652
It looks like I'm with 
the right girl.

627
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,283
I'm very impressed
you would buy this for me.

628
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,582
I'm gonna fill it right now.

629
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,336
Do you want to go 
gambling tonight?

630
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:19,257
I was thinking we could go
and just play for a few hours.

631
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,178
I hadn't planned to gamble,

632
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,514
but if you could keep
the bulk of my money,

633
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:29,976
I could safely blow
a couple hundred bucks.

634
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,522
Giving you money
makes me want to come.

635
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,779
Then come.

636
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,322
I'm sorry.

637
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,326
I love you.

638
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,764
- [Sera] You got a 13.
- [Ben] Hit me.

639
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,601
- [Sera] Wait. She's got a seven.
- [Ben] I don't know. You tell me.

640
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:57,022
- Hit.
- I'm busted. That's all right.

641
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,633
[Ben] You got it. 
You can do it.

642
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,136
Wait a minute! Really? 
Oh, man!

643
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,638
- What?
- He's OK.

644
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,140
Do you want anything?

645
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:37,312
Yeah, maybe a Bloody Mary.
Can you make that?

646
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,231
What?

647
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:42,651
What? No! No!

648
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,570
Fuck you! Fuck! You fucker!

649
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,663
That boy is... 
You can'tjudge me!

650
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,333
You! I am his father!

651
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,918
Get up!

652
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,589
- [Man] Let's go, guys.
- [Ben screaming]

653
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,638
[Sera] Ben?

654
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:13,658
Ben?

655
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,992
- How are you?
- Very well.

656
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:02,624
I never expected
to have to ask this again,

657
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,043
but how did our evening go?

658
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:12,092
I remember getting to the casino.
[Coughs]

659
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:18,390
And I remember kissing you.
That was really nice.

660
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:23,979
And playing blackjack,
and then security came.

661
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:28,274
But after that, everything's a blank.
What happened?

662
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:31,569
They wanted to carry you out
and dump you onto the street,

663
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,739
but I talked them
into letting me walk you out.

664
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,534
That's impressive.

665
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,121
How did you do that?

666
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,459
I told them
that you were an alcoholic...

667
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,630
...and that I would 
take you home...

668
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,260
...and that we would never
go in there ever again.

669
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,308
"We"?

670
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,063
Yes, we.

671
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:16,740
That's amazing.

672
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,783
What are you?

673
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:24,831
Some sort of angel visiting me
from one of my drunk fantasies?

674
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,502
How can you be so good?

675
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,508
I don't know what 
you're saying.

676
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,807
[Sera] I'm just using you.

677
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,351
I need you.

678
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:52,192
Can we not talk about it anymore?
Not a word.

679
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,198
You go back to sleep,

680
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,700
and I'll go out
and get us some breakfast.

681
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:06,039
- Will you be careful?
- Don't worry.

682
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:25,058
Ben, I'm working tonight.

683
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,188
I know.

684
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:51,042
[Woman] I fuckin' talk all the time
because you never fuckin' listen to me!

685
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,878
- So fuck you!
- [Man] Shut the fuck up.

686
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:01,678
I'd like a beer
and a double Kamikaze, please.

687
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:07,058
We mustn't kick the bar.
We lean into the bar.

688
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,519
Just lean into the railing.

689
