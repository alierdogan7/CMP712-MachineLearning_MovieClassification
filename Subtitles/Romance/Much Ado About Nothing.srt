1
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,302
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro

2
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,371
of Arragon comes this day to Messina.

3
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,440
LEONATO'S AIDE:
He is very near by this, not three leagues off.

4
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,775
Have any gentlemen been lost in this action?

5
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:00,812
But few of any sort, and none of name.

6
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,748
A victory is twice itself

7
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,584
when the achiever brings home full numbers.

8
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,819
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor

9
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,422
upon a young Florentine called Claudio.

10
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,457
Much deserved on his part

11
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,726
and equally remembered by Don Pedro,

12
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,595
he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age,

13
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,198
doing, in the figure of a lamb, the feats of a lion.

14
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,299
Rarh!

15
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,572
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto
returned from the wars or no?

16
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,574
LEONATO'S AIDE: I know none
of that name, lady.

17
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,675
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

18
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,376
O, he's returned

19
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,946
and as pleasant as ever he was.

20
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,782
I pray you, how many hath he
killed and eaten in these wars?

21
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,650
But how many hath he killed?

22
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,553
For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.

23
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,456
Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much,

24
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,292
but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.

25
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,596
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.

26
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,432
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it.

27
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,000
He is a very valiant trencherman,

28
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,668
he hath an excellent stomach.

29
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,637
LEONATO'S AIDE:
And a good soldier too, lady.

30
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,973
And a good soldier to a lady.

31
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,409
But what is he to a lord?

32
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,745
A lord to a lord, a man to a man,

33
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,513
stuffed with all honorable virtue.

34
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,282
It is so, indeed,

35
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,951
he is no less than a stuffed man.

36
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,621
You must not, sir, mistake my niece.

37
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,991
There is a kind of merry war
betwixt Signior Benedick and her.

38
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:22,728
They never meet but there's a
skirmish of wit between them.

39
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,465
Who is his companion now?
He hath every month a new sworn brother.

40
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,399
LEONATO'S AIDE:
Is't possible?

41
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,901
Very easily possible.

42
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,437
He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat,

43
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,939
it ever changes with the next block.

44
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,807
(CHUCKLES)

45
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,877
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.

46
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,446
No, and he were, I would burn my study.

47
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:46,018
But, I pray you, who is his companion?

48
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,786
Is there no young squarer now that will

49
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,422
make a voyage with him to the devil?

50
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,892
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.

51
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,929
O, lord, he will hang upon him like a disease.

52
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,798
He is sooner caught than the pestilence,

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,701
and the taker runs presently mad.

54
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,037
O, God help the noble Claudio!

55
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,838
If he have caught the Benedick,

56
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,740
it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured.

57
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:09,574
(ALL LAUGHING)

58
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,054
Good Signior Leonato,

59
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,523
you are come to welcome your trouble.

60
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,691
The fashion of the world is to avoid cost,

61
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,527
and you encounter it.

62
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,731
Never came trouble to my house
in the likeness of your grace.

63
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:10,102
For trouble being gone, comfort should remain.

64
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,905
But when you depart from me sorrow
abides and happiness takes his leave.

65
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,742
DON PEDRO:
Hmm, you embrace your charge too willingly.

66
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,784
I think this is your daughter.

67
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,586
Her mother hath many times told me so.

68
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,488
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?

69
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,857
Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a child.

70
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,526
Truly, truly, the lady fathers herself.

71
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,928
Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.

72
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,131
BENEDICK:
If Signior Leonato be her father,

73
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,166
she would not have his head on
her shoulders for all Messina

74
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,602
as like him as she is.

75
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,737
I wonder that you would still
be talking, Signior Benedick.

76
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,406
Nobody marks you.

77
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,808
What, my dear Lady Disdain!
Are you yet living?

78
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,177
Is it possible disdain should die

79
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:56,081
while she hath such meet food
to feed it as Signior Benedick?

80
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,151
Courtesy itself must convert to
disdain, if you come in her presence.

81
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,920
Then is courtesy a turncoat.

82
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:07,526
But it is certain I am loved of
all ladies, only you excepted,

83
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,896
and I would I could find it in my
heart that I had not a hard heart,

84
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,064
for, truly, I love none.

85
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,567
Dear happiness to women, else would they

86
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,170
have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.

87
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,740
I thank God and my cold blood,
I am of your humor for that.

88
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:25,777
I had rather hear my dog bark at a
crow than a man swear he loves me.

89
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,913
God keep your ladyship still in that mind

90
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:31,149
so some gentleman or other shall
'scape a predestinate scratched face.

91
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,717
Scratching could not make it worse,

92
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,486
an 'twere such a face as yours were.

93
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,822
Well, you are
a rare parrot-teacher.

94
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,824
Um, a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.

95
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,592
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,

96
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,061
and so good a continuer.

97
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,964
But keep in your way, God's name, I have done.

98
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,802
You always end with a jade's trick.

99
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,104
I know you of old.

100
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,177
Signior Benedick, my dear friend
Leonato hath invited you all.

101
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,580
I tell him we shall stay here at the least the month,

102
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,915
and he heartily prays some
occasion may detain us longer.

103

(CAMERA CLICKS)

104
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,553
DON PEDRO: Lady.

105
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,257
Let me bid you welcome, my lord.

106
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,559
Being reconciled with the prince your brother,

107
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,961
I owe you all duty.

108
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,734
I am not of many words, but I thank you.

109
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,172
Please it your grace lead on?

110
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,641
Your hand, Leonato.
We will go together.

111
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,018
Benedick, didst thou note the
daughter of Signior Leonato?

112
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,187
I noted her not, but I looked on her.

113
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,189
Is she not a modest young lady?

114
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,124
Do you question me, as an honest man should do,

115
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,260
for my simple true judgment,

116
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,595
or would you have me speak after my custom,

117
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,831
as being a professed tyrant to their sex?

118
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,901
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.

119
00:08:55,903 --> 00:09:00,272
Why, i' faith, methinks she is too low for a high praise,

120
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,942
too brown for a fair praise,
too little for a great praise.

121
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,677
Only this commendation I can afford her,

122
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,145
that were she other than she is,

123
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,080
she were unhandsome,

124
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,250
and being no other than as she is, I do not like her.

125
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:16,588
Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray
thee tell me truly how thou likest her.

126
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,758
Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?

127
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,326
Can the world buy such a jewel?

128
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,094
Yea, and a case to put it into.

129
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,100
But speak you this with a sad brow?

130
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,037
In mine eye she is the sweetest
lady that ever I looked on.

131
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,776
I can see yet without spectacles
and I see no such matter.

132
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,715
There's her cousin,
an she were not possessed with a fury,

133
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,283
exceeds her as much in beauty

as the first of May doth the last of December.

135
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,858
But I hope you have no intent to turn husband,
have you?

136
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,260
I would scarce trust myself,

137
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,228
though I had sworn the contrary,

138
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,863
if Hero would be my wife.

I would your grace would constrain me to tell.

O, on my allegiance?

On my allegiance he is in love.

is your grace's part.

With Hero, Leonato's short daughter.

153
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,774
Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.

154
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,409
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.

155
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,144
By my troth, I speak my thought.

156
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,413
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.

157
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:51,383
And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.

158
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,951
That I love her I feel.

159
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,953
And that she is worthy, I know.

160
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,788
That I neither feel how she should be loved

161
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,356
nor know how she should be worthy

162
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,692
is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me.

163
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,228
I will die in it at the stake.

164
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,664
Thou wast ever an obstinate
heretic in the despite of beauty.

165
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,199
That a woman conceived me, I give her thanks,

166
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,302
that she brought me up, I likewise
give her most humble thanks.

167
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,805
But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead,

168
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,307
or hang my bugle from an invisible baldrick,

169

all women shall pardon me.

170
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,946
Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any,

171
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,816
I will do myself the right to trust none.

172
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,886
And the fine is, for the which I may go the finer,

173

With anger, with sickness,

175
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,165

but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it,

180
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,978
pluck off the bull's horns and plant them in my forehead

181

O, my lord, when you went onward on this ended action,

195
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,856

196
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,457
than to drive liking to the name of love.

197
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,532
And that war-thoughts
have left their places vacant,

198
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:51,302
in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires,

199
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:56,007
all prompting me how fair young Hero is,

200
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,543
saying, "I liked her
ere I went to wars."

201
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,881
Thou wilt be like a lover presently

202
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:06,317
and tire the hearer with a book of words.

203
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,355
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,

204
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:14,125

her father, and thou shalt have her.

reveling to-night. Hmm.

206

I will assume thy part in some disguise

207
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,237
and tell fair Hero I am Claudio,

208
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,040
and in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart

209
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,343
and take her hearing prisoner with the force

210

00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,061
In every good thing.

348
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,131
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will
leave them at the next turning.

349
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,012
(BREATHING LOUDLY)

350
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,523
Are not you Signior Benedick?

351
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,860
You know me well, I am he.

352
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,763
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love.

353
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,500
He is enamored on Hero.

354
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,502
I pray you, dissuade him from her.

355
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,539
She is no equal for his birth.

356
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,143
You may do the part of an honest man in it.

357
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,647
CLAUDIO:
How know you he loves her?

358
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,818
I heard him swear his affection.

359
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,588
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her to-night.

360
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,161
Come, let us to the banquet.

361
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,960
'Tis certain so, the prince woos for himself.

362
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,237
Friendship is constant in all other things

363
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:10,140
save in the offices and affairs of love,

364
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:14,078
for beauty is a witch against whose
charms faith melteth into blood.

365
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:17,982
Count Claudio?

366
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,650
Yea, the same.

367
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,253
Come, go with me.
The prince hath got your Hero.

368
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,124
I wish him joy of her.

369
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,261
Did you think the prince would have used you thus?

370
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:32,296
I pray you, leave me.

371
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:35,065
Ho! Now you strike
like the blind man.

372
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,801
'Twas the boy that stole your
meat, and you will beat the post.

373
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,770
If it will not be, I'll leave you.

374
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,143
Alas, poor hurt fowl.

375
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,747
Now will he creep into sedges.

376
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,657
But that my Lady Beatrice

377
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,092
should know me, and not know me.

378
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,261
The prince's fool?

379
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,263
(GRUNTS)

380
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:09,867
It may be I go under that title because I am merry.

381
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:13,070
Yea, but so I am apt to do myself
wrong, I am not so reputed.

382
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,243
It is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice

383
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,646
that puts the world into her person and so gives me out.

384
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:25,716
Well, I will be revenged as I may.

385
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,653
(GUITAR STRUMMING)

386
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,180
Now, signior, where's the count?
Did you see him?

387
00:26:56,182 --> 00:27:00,951
Troth, my lord, I found him as
melancholy as a lodge in a warren.

388
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,887
I told him, and I think I told him true,

389
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:08,025
that your grace had got the good
will of this young lady here.

390
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:10,728
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you.

391
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,129
The gentleman that danced with her

392
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,198
told her she is much wronged by you.

393
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,401
O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!

394
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,739
She told me, not thinking I had been myself,

395
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,308
that I was the prince's jester.
(CLICKS FINGERS)

396
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,912
That I was duller than a great thaw,

397
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:32,783
huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance

398
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,052
that I stood like a man at a mark,

399
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,820
with a whole army shooting at me.

400
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,091
She speaks poniards, and every word stabs.

401
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,894
(LAUGHS)

402
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:47,197
If her breath were as terrible as her terminations,

403
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,700
there would be no living near her.

404
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,268
She would infect to the north star.

405
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,139
I would not marry her,

406
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,740
though she were endowed with all that

407
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,442
Adam had left him before he transgressed.

408
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,946
BENEDICK:
Come, talk not of her.

409
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:05,983
(SIGHS)

410
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,889
I would to God some scholar would conjure her.

411
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:15,025
For certainly, while she is here, all disquiet, horror,

412
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,927
and perturbation follows her.

413
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,465
Look, here she comes.

414
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,268
Will your grace command me
any service to the world's end?

415
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,403
I will go on the slightest errand now

416
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,239
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on.

417
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,175
I will fetch
you a tooth-picker

418
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,077
from the furthest inch of Asia,

419
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,113
bring you a hair off the great Cham's beard,

420
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,282
do you any embassage to the Pigmies

421
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,184
rather than hold three words'
conference with this harpy.

422
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,921
BENEDICK:
You have no employment for me?

423
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,225
None, but to desire your good company.

424
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,462
O God, sir, here is a dish I love not.

425
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,230
I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.

426
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,069
Come, lady, come.

427
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,475
You have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.

428
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:07,311
Indeed, my lord,

429
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,780
he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for it,

430
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,517
a double heart for his single one.

431
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,323
Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,

432
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:23,026
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.

433
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:26,130
But you have put him down, lady,
you have put him down.

434
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,832
So I would not he should do me, my lord,

435
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,367
lest I should prove the mother of fools.

436
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,973
I have brought Count Claudio,
whom you sent me to seek.

437
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,111
DON PEDRO: Why, how now, Claudio!
Wherefore are you sad?

438
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,080
Not sad, my lord.
How then? Sick?

439
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,215
Neither, my lord.

440
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:48,519
The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well,

441
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:51,388
but civil count, civil as an orange,

442
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,491
and something of that jealous complexion.

443
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:57,861
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon
to be true, though, I'll be sworn,

444
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,496
if he be so, his conceit is false.

445
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,967
DON PEDRO: Here, Claudio,

446
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:08,138
I have wooed in thy name.
Fair Hero is won.

447
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,440
I have broke with her father, and his good will obtained.

448
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:13,544
Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy!

449
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,516
(GRUNTS)

450
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:25,122
Count, take of me my daughter and with her my fortune.

451
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,925
His grace hath made the match
that all grace say "Amen" to it.

452
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,002
Speak, Count, 'tis your cue.

453
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:46,443
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy.

454
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,846
I were but little happy, if I could say how much.

455
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,952
Lady, as you are mine, I am yours.

456
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:58,021
I give myself for you and dote upon the exchange.

457
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,559
Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot,
stop his mouth with a kiss

458
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,995
and let him not speak neither.

459
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,136
DON PEDRO: In faith, lady,
you have a merry heart.

460
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,005
Yea, my lord.
I thank it, poor fool,

461
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,207
it keeps me on the windy side of care.

462
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,279
My cousin tells him in his ear he is in her heart.

463
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,382
And so she doth, cousin.

464
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,352
BEATRICE: Oh, good Lord,
for alliance!

465
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:32,923
Thus goes every one into the
world but I, and I am sunburnt.

466
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:36,126
I will sit in a corner and cry,
"Heigh-ho for a husband!"

467
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,395
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.

468
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,265
I'd rather have one of your father's getting.

469
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,900
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you?

470
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,534
Your father got excellent husbands,

471
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,970
if a maid could come by them.

472
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,139
Will you have me, lady?

473
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,574
(CHUCKLING)

474
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,343
No, my lord,

475
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:56,313
unless I might have
another for working-days.

476
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:59,549
Your grace is too costly to wear every day.

477
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,019
But, I beseech your grace, pardon me.

478
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,688
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.

479
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,959
Your silence most offends me,
to be merry best becomes you,

480
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:12,029
for, out of question, you were born in a merry hour.

481
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:15,065
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried,

482
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,001
but then a star danced, and under that was I born.

483
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,538
Cousins, God give you joy!

484
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,410
(CHUCKLES)

485
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:34,051
By my troth,
a pleasant-spirited lady.

486
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:37,187
There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord.

487
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:40,557
She is never sad but when she
sleeps, and not ever sad then,

488
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,092
for I have heard my daughter say,

489
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,994
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness

490
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:46,029
and waked herself with laughing.

491
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,531
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

492
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,166
O, by no means.

493
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,500
She mocks all her wooers out of suit.

494
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,537
She were an excellent wife for Benedick.

495
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,539
(GASPS)

496
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,508
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,

497
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,544
they would talk themselves mad.

498
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,182
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?

499
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,284
To-morrow, my lord.

500
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,419
Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.

501
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,122
Not till Monday, dear son,

502
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,490
which is hence
a just seven-night,

503
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,392
and a time too brief, too,

504
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:18,161
to have all things answer my mind.

505
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,631
DON PEDRO: I warrant thee, Claudio,
the time shall not go dully by us.

506
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:25,335
I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labors,

507
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,705
which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice

508
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:32,342
into a mountain of affection, the one with the other.

509
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,479
I would fain have it a match, and
I doubt not but to fashion it,

510
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,016
if you three will minister assistance.

511
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:42,352
My lord, I am for you, though it
cost me 10 nights' watchings.

512
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,121
And I, my lord.

513
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,589
DON PEDRO:
And you too, gentle Hero?

514
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,557
I will do any modest office, my lord,

515
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,260
to help my cousin to a good husband.

516
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,764
Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know.

517
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:57,367
Thus far can I praise him, he is of a noble strain,

00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:02,105
of approved valor and confirmed honesty.

519
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,609
I will teach you how to humor your cousin,

520
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,044
that she shall fall in love with Benedick,

521
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,779
and I,

522
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,815
with your two helps, will so practice on Benedick that,

523
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:15,318
in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach,

524
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,654
he shall fall in love with Beatrice.

Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.

531
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:48,452
Any bar, any cross, any impediment
will be medicinable to me.

532
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:53,457
I am sick in displeasure to him,

533
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:54,825
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection

534
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:57,327
ranges evenly with mine.

00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,833
How canst thou thwart this marriage?

536
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,378
I think I told your lordship a year since,

537
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,714
how much I am in favor of Margaret,

538
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,516
the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

539
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,119

540
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,689
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,

541
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,458
appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.

542
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:33,196
What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?

543
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,632

00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,279
in marrying the renowned Claudio,

547
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,148

550
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,726
What proof shall I make of that?

551
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,664
Proof enough to misuse the prince,

552
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:12,435
to vex Claudio, to undo Hero and kill Leonato.

555
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,904
I do much wonder that one man,

556
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,940
seeing how much another man is a fool

557
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,576
when he dedicates his behaviors to love,

558
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:55,845
will, after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others,

559
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:59,249
become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love.

560
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,219
And such a man is Claudio.

561
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,987
I have known when there was no music

562
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,456
with him but the drum and the fife,

563
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,593
now he had rather hear the tabor and the pipe.

564
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,294
I have known when he would have walked

565
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,530
10 mile a-foot
to see a good armor,

566
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,398
and now will he lie 10 nights awake,

567
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,801
carving the fashion of a new doublet.

568
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:19,803
He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose,

569
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:22,272
like an honest man and a soldier.

570
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:26,409
Now is he turned orthography, his
words a very fantastical banquet,

571
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,511
just so many strange dishes.

572
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,749
May I be so converted and see with these eyes?

573
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,952
I cannot tell, I think not.

574
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:40,457
I will not be sworn, but love
may transform me to an oyster.

575
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,526
But I'll take my oath on it,
till he have made an oyster of me,

576
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,462
he shall never make me such a fool.

577
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:50,300
One woman is fair, yet I am well.

578
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,602
Another is wise, yet I am well.

What was it you
told me of to-day,

597
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:02,339
that your niece Beatrice was
in love with Signior Benedick?

598
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:03,873
I did never think that lady would have loved any man.

No, nor I neither,

600
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:10,347
but most wonderful that she should
so dote on Signior Benedick,

601
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:13,783
whom she hath in all outward
behaviors seemed ever to abhor.

Sits the wind in that corner?

By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it

604
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,961
but that she loves him with an enraged affection.

605
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,529

invincible against all assaults of affection.

I would have sworn it had, my lord,

610
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,042
especially against Benedick.

611
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,111
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?

612

No, and swears she never will, that is her torment.

it, and hear what he will say.

692
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,998
Yea, signior,

693
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,869
just so much as you may take upon a knife's point.

694
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:34,704
(BENEDICK LAUGHS)

695
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:35,772
(PANTS)

696
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,110
You have no stomach, signior.
Fare you well.

697
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,185
(CHUCKLES)

698
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,889
"Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner."

699
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:55,792
There's a double meaning in that.

700
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:57,460
"I took no more pains for those thanks"

701
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:59,195
"than you took
pains to thank me."

702
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,730
That's as much as to say, any pains

703
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:04,000
that I take for you is as good as thanks.

704
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,769
If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain.

705
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,243
If I do not love her, I am a fool.

706
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,047
I will go get her picture.

707
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,723
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.

708
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:29,125
I know her spirits are as coy and wild

709
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:30,193
as haggerds of the rock.

710
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,431
But are you sure Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?

711
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,432
(GASPS)
(THUMPS)

712
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,741
So says the prince
and my new-trothed lord.

713
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,876
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

714
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:50,012
They did entreat me to acquaint
her of it, but I persuaded them,

715
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,380
if they loved Benedick,

716
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:54,417
to wish him restle with affection,

717
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,918
and never to let Beatrice know of it.

718
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,054
Why did you so?

719
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:01,491
Doth not the gentleman
deserve as full a fortunate a bed

720
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:03,860
as ever Beatrice shall couch upon?

721
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,962
HERO: O, god of love!
I know he doth deserve

722
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:08,164
as much as may be yielded to a man.

723
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,833
But nature never framed a woman's heart

724
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:12,301
of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.

725
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,103
(THUDS)

726
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:17,006
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,

727
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:18,841
misprising what they look on,

728
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:21,277
and her wit values itself so highly

729
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:25,148
that to her all matter else seems weak.

730
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:29,051
HERO: She cannot love, nor take no
shape nor project of affection,

731
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,319
she is so self-endeared.

732
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,390
Sure, I think so.

733
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,360
And therefore certainly it were
not good she knew his love,

734
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:39,829
lest she make sport at it.

735
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:43,232
No, rather I will go to Benedick

736
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:46,903
and counsel him to fight against his passion.

737
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:51,307
Truly, I'll devise some honest
slanders to stain my cousin with.

738
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:55,044
One doth not know how much an
ill word may empoison liking.

739
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:58,281
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.

740
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:01,417
She cannot be so much without true judgment.

741
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,086
Having so swift and excellent a wit,

742
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:06,856
as she is prized to have,

743
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:10,493
as to refuse so rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.

744
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,295
He is the only man of Italy.
Mmm.

745
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,164
Always excepted my dear Claudio.

746
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,275
Come, go in.
I'll show thee some attires,

747
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,411
and have thy counsel which is the
best to furnish me to-morrow.

748
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,282
(GASPS)

749
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,285
What fire is in my ears?

750
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,157
Can this be true?

751
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:47,263
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?

752
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,434
Contempt, farewell.

753
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:56,172
And maiden pride, <i>adieu.</i>

754
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:58,574
No glory lives behind the back of such.

755
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,949
And, Benedick,

756
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,220
love on.

757
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,893
I will requite thee,

758
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,331
taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.

759
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,601
If thou dost love,

760
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:28,104
my kindness shall incite thee

761
00:48:30,603 --> 00:48:32,104
