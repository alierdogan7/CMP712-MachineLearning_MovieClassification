Can you not once your pants
Hold during a wedding?

57
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:49,361
Make you a joke. The only reason
That awful dress to hold ...

58
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:52,601
Is that a drunken bruidsjonker
With his teeth to pieces may rupture.

59
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:56,385
What time is it now? Twelve.
I am still about two hours, then ...

60
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:58,905
I call you back.

61
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:28,122
Even more shoes. Wait.

62
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:46,151
I have a hunger.
Have you eaten anything?

63
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:48,969
That looks great.
I have not eaten.

64
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,345
Let me give you an opinion, drink
Never an empty stomach.

00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,752
Have you seen my grandmother?
-- Yes, it looks good.

00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,734
I have fun with her.
-- I think she has fun. -- Yes.

67
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:17,838
What is that thing on your forehead?

68
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,416
Can I do a lot even? I want a girl
Even special thank ...

69
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,679
Who really more than enough
Done.

70
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:26,817
The girl not only hostess
Was at my party ...

71
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:28,595
But also helped me to
Invitations to write.

72
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,794
They went with me to the catering company,
The florist, the bakery trouwtaart ...

73
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,353
And to eight bruidszaken ...

74
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:37,466
Where they opvijzelde my confidence ...

75
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:40,202
As I aanpaste dress after dress, so ...

76
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:43,122
Thanks, Jane.

77
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:44,979
Thanks, Jane.

78
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,055
Is everybody ready?

79
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,799
Quietly, do it quietly.
Move not too many.

80
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,430
Okay, this is a serious injury,
I want you what ice picks, you ...

81
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,283
A bottle of liquor, and something
She can eat.

82
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:33,196
Good. It is good with her people,
Only her head.

83
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:35,046
Go on.

84
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:36,663
Are you a doctor.
-- Yes.

85
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:39,231
Tweedeldy and Tweedeldrunk
Attacked me hard, so ...

86
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,761
Good. Do you know your name?
-- Jane.

87
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:44,045
Jane. I am Kevin.

88
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:49,199
Thank you help me?
-- Sure. Is it?

89
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:52,445
What's up with you?
-- It goes well with me.

90
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:58,847
I let a taxi before you deliver, right?

91
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:00,837
Quietly, slowly.

92
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:13,661
I found your string indeed beautiful.

93
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:17,999
We came together earlier against,
I saw how you another dress attracted.

94
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:20,046
You had to two weddings
On one evening, or not?

95
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,966
This is a bit confusing.
Do not you agree?

96
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:23,849
They were both very good friends
Mine, and ...

97
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,082
And she married both on the same evening.
So what else should I do?

98
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,912
That is not the confusing part.
How can you do that uithouden?

99
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:30,712
Is a wedding is not bad enough?

100
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,303
I love weddings,
I always had it done.

101
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,119
Really? -- Yes.
Which part?

102
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,264
The forced cheerfulness, the terrible
Music or bad food?

103
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,640
Actually, it's people meet
Like you.

104
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:43,189
Love is patient, love is good.

105
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,038
Love means your intellect massacred.
-- What do you point again?

106
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:47,419
I am a writer.
-- Exactly.

107
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:53,412
This is my building.
-- I got it.

108
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:55,656
No, I got it.
-- Certainly? -- Yes.

109
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,553
Honderdveertig, you know what you have done.
Wait, it is so.

110
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:06,905
Do you not think it is a whole ritual
For something. Let's face it.

111
00:10:07,337 --> 00:10:08,856
We have a chance of fifty,
Fifty to step through the port.

112
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:10,953
How refreshing. A man who
Not believe in marriage.

113
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:13,298
I try only the hypocrisy of
The spectacle to demonstrate.

114
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:17,227
That is noble. Tell you also
Small children that Santa Claus does not exist?

115
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:19,434
As someone who rubbish
Has become known.

116
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,944
Let's face it, if you believe in marriage,
That is like believing in Santa Claus.

117
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:25,004
Nope ...

118
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:29,023
I do not know why I
Discuss with a totally strange ...

119
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,896
But yes, the marriage as well and everything
Important, is not easy.

120
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:33,841
Cynicism, on the other hand,
That always.

121
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:38,100
It was very interesting to meet you.
-- See you later. -- Yes.

122
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:42,575
If you come to my wedding next weekend?
-- I have to go.

123
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,686
How many are you actually?

124
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:46,877
Welterusten.

125
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,492
Can you ...
-- Yes.

126
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,463
Forget it.
-- Yes.

127
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,114
This piece, wedding, yes.

128
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,555
Come to mama.

Undertakings
Lifelong Volksfeest

130
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,852
Tido simply walked away. The night.
Have you seen him?

131
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,916
No, I work Saturday night, remember?
Here, of the happy couple.

132
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:31,416
Yes, that's right. You have kokosnootcake
Eaten, and the electric slide '.

133
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:33,772
How is it gone?
-- Once watch ...

134
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,829
The bride wore a dress
Fonkelde that if the groom his eyes.

135
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:39,347
He saw her approaching by rain
Of rose petals.

136
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:41,100
And you have not fucked?

137
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:44,053
'Commitment' is the golden yardstick
For wedding.

138
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,859
Every girl on this planet, tears
The Sunday open, and looks like the first ...

139
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:49,363
Bride. Does a murder to
Into it.

140
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,965
Do you have any idea what you might
Are doing?

141
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,013
You mean two women who
On the point of going to marry?

142
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,633
Yes. They will not call you,
You will not harass, which ...

143
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,712
Will act as if they do not even know you.
Since you can not oppose.

144
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:00,567
Well, it does provide yet
Not much more ...

145
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:03,127
You look at my ticket to the
Ghetto to be my friend.

146
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,397
Stay but dreams.
-- Go away.

147
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,645
I did not want to come to work
In my bruidsmeisjesjurk.

148
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,007
Two days in disgrace walked. Elegant.

149
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:26,155
What happened last night. We were
Just, and when you had already disappeared.

150
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:29,930
Did you meet someone?
-- Come on. No.

151
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:32,373
An absurd question?

152
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:35,379
Good morning, Gina.
-- Hello.

153
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:38,106
Do you have my pocket diary somewhere
? I can not find him.

154
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:40,785
No.
-- No? Okay, I go find him.

155
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:44,229
What do those pages of the catalog
George, he wants to see them right away this morning.

156
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:47,017
No.
-- Do not worry, I get it but of the production.

157
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,234
Let them see who the boss is.
-- I am not the boss.

158
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,483
You are the assistant to the boss.
That is the same.

159
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:55,771
What's the use
If you do not use that power.

160
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:58,017
Go to the accounts.
-- Now you are bossy.

161
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,082
Where did I do that damn thing left.

162
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:09,860
That is a good idea,
For the frontpagina section.

163
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:13,355
How often have I already not you heard?
-- I say you Maureen, it's a great idea.

164
00:14:13,356 --> 00:14:15,161
Really. The same as your last
Great idea?

165
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:18,330
The reveal of price fixing
Bruidstaarten of bakeries? -- Yes.

166
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:19,798
Yes, they put people off.

167
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,461
Flower cost penny per us ...

168
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:23,036
This is a turnover of eight hundred,
That is outrageous.

169
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:25,362
Yes, that's it. Moreover,
No one care.

170
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:27,785
What then about the piece that I wanted
On the exploitation of workers ...

171
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:30,227
In the factories where everything by hand
, Which was a topstuk.

172
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:33,454
Well, that's what people really want
Read in the modesectie.

173
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:37,316
Kevin, this section will pay nearly
For the entire newspaper ...

174
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:39,978
Our advertisers want cosy
Colorful human interest stories ...

175
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,068
Against their products.

176
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,430
So it's not about money?
-- Go out.

177
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:46,656
Okay, that was not good. I get the picture.
But this is.

178
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:49,506
She was seven weddings.
-- And?

179
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:53,448
This year. She was there Saturday
Alone two.

180
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:56,462
It will not only about her,
It will be a penetrating gaze, how ...

181
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,256
Something transformed the wedding industry
, In what should be ...

182
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:02,619
A very important part in nothing more than
A co ِ peratieve marital power.

183
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:07,466
On a fun, cheerful way.

184
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:10,752
Maureen Listen, I go there dead
To those commitments.

185
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:13,700
If I have one thing to write about
The breath of a baby, I always suicide.

186
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:15,757
This is a true story.
This is what I want to do.

187
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:17,431
I want you report of weddings.

188
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:19,453
That is what you are good at, and that
's What I want you do.

189
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:21,896
Maybe even a few stories,
Then I resigned.

190
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:23,759
Good. Not a chance.

191
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,906
If I do not like, you go back to
Commitments for the rest of your life ...

192
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:30,798
With a smile on that handsome face of yours.
-- Deal.

193
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:34,797
Do you think he will find this fun?

194
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:38,213
Yes, I think. I think that these photos
For the autumn catalogue ...

195
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:43,507
George will take you to his office,
And the sweet love with you for hours affiliate.

196
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:46,646
Tell me that this crazy intense love
The reason is that if you work hard ...

197
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,569
Like you now, because it is confusing.
-- Like my job, okay?

198
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,594
No. You think George one day
Wake up and realize ...

199
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:56,425
That he is terribly in love with you, and that
He will be a spectacular gesture of love ...

200
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:58,250
Flowers for Jane Nickels.
-- That's me.

201
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,427
Thank you!

202
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:05,332
Great. I spend two days in bed by
With a boy and you get flowers. Fun.

203
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,098
There is no note.

204
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:10,869
Jane, you think that they are not serious
The boy of your dreams, either?

205
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,097
Gina, can you take me to them
My office with me?

206
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,682
Sure, no problem.
-- Thank you.

207
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,502
Would you please say no more?
Nobody knows.

208
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:21,870
Everyone knows Jane, except George.
-- That is true.

209
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:27,814
Hey, how are things with you?

210
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:30,768
Not kwijlen on the ladies.

211
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:31,673
Hello.

212
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,679
How was it?
-- It was phenomenal return,

213
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,392
In ten hours, my best time ever.

214
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:40,595
Is that not the eighth time
You have surged with Whitney?

215
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:43,136
Yes, you remember how you think, Jane?

216
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:46,345
I do not know. We have just
Inside. What do you think of it?

217
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:48,208
I think they used to.

218
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,954
Yes, I thought that too.
They have not really feel there.

219
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:55,938
Too touristy. There is not no adventure
Danger, it looks far too made.

220
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,181
Yes, like models, I got it.
I talk to marketing.

221
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:00,299
See? That is why I love you
In the area, Jane.

222
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:01,653
Girls who can finish my sentences.

223
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:03,631
Your draft agreement to eleven hours,
...

224
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:07,099
WI Street and'69 'called on
Liefdadigheidsvoorstelling that ...

225
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,108
Will you go?
-- Do I have a speech?

226
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,530
A few words about ecological
Responsible business,

227
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,304
Something light, grappigs. Want to go?
-- Yes, let's do it. Put it on the agenda ...

228
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:18,686
But I should probably
The date opduikelen sure. -- Yes.

229
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:23,153
That is the only one in my life where
Not for me you have to worry, right?

230
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:29,819
My God.
-- Well.

231
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,059
Jane, that you have breakfast in
My office placed?

232
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,642
I thought you might be hungry again.
-- Therefore, I also love you.

233
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:41,938
I also love you.

234
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:47,190
Yes, yes you are right, which I needed.

235
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:53,699
Okay everyone, I hope you
All see tonight on my verlovingsfeest.

236
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:57,074
And Jane, again thank you
Have everything.

237
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:58,900
No problem.

238
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:04,376
Do you want me to forward for the party?
There will be a few boys ...

239
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:06,486
They take account tequila, and bubbelwijn.

240
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,246
Great. I can not, I must
Tess of the airport pick.

241
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:14,684
Would not it be great if you
Had a service that you could hire it ...

242
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:18,713
As yellow cars or shiny
Black Sedan.

243
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:22,460
I would fetch her, it's my
Little sister, and she has my support.

244
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:26,655
Yes, I would not like to?

245
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:42,555
Since when you have so little
Luggage with you?

246
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:48,075
I always meet the nicest people
In aircraft.

247
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,618
Come on, I parked at P9.

248
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:56,861
Of course he said that he naturally with me
It wanted to come to New York ...

249
00:18:56,862 --> 00:19:01,357
But I said that I had space.

250
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:06,894
It is so small and cute.
I think it is great.

251
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:10,959
It is so good to go back home. Six months
Away from home, feels like a very long time.

252
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,634
A walk in the park,
A lifelong journey.

253
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:19,114
Mama was just as old as I am, you know?
Almost on the day.

254
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:22,838
Yes, it was the perfect wedding.

255
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,480
Boothuis, the big band.
Ceremony at sunset.

256
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:32,514
Except for that dress, it is not terrible.

257
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:34,558
I think it was perfect.

258
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,776
They kept it from each other.

259
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:46,772
What are these? Huwelijksaankondigingen?
-- No, sorry. I wanted that reuse.

260
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,919
Sorry, where? Wallpaper?

261
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,466
It's just that man, Malcolm Doyle, I love
Just in him. He writes the best.

262
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:58,288
I just love those stories.
Those crazy bring ...

263
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,652
Verlovingen the ...

264
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,760
Yes, but late. That is not really
Your thing, then ...

265
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:06,389
How long you stay?
-- Approximately two weeks.

266
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,369
The fall fashion shows are therefore ready
I do not have much work.

267
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:13,957
About spoken work. I go with what people
Of the work to a party, if you also bring?

268
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,187
Actually, I drink something with
Some friends from Milan.

269
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:21,206
Even one by one turn, you will prefer
A drink with a few models ...

270
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:23,984
Than with me to go to my
Great party.

271
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:28,377
Weird, huh? But I will try
To come. -- Thanks.

272
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:32,011
Grenivkin is in the freezer
Red Bull on top of the refrigerator, and in the closet ...

273
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:35,657
Ice.

274
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:43,126
St. Martinez.
-- Appears each other.

275
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:55,609
We have champagneglazen, and
A bottle of Crystal.

276
00:20:56,707 --> 00:20:58,776
Would they really believe that it
Afgekomen me?

277
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:00,925
Maybe. We have encapsulated
As if a car drove over it.

278
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,859
Fun. Nice approach.

279
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,045
I go to the bar and get even
A few drinks.

280
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:08,990
Do you still need something. What "liquid
Courage 'or whatever her of the dog for you?

281
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,903
No, thank you.

282
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:17,732
He asked if what you wanted to drink.
You laugh, and you say a vodka soda.

283
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:21,489
If you already have a drink, you throw that away.
Then there is what geflirt, men want sex ...

284
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,743
An accidental pregnancy, a rifle
Stands ready, and a life of bliss.

285
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,462
How many times must we here
Still talking about?

286
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:28,802
I would not think he thinks that I
Am irresponsible.

287
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:30,902
Yes, that's what boys want.
Responsibility.

288
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:33,991
That's your mistake.
George likes me as I am.

289
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:36,608
How can he now appreciate something,
When no one is naked.

290
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:42,846
Besides, have you seen that thing that
I voted this morning at your desk?

291
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:46,884
On my desk?
-- Yes, is that good?

292
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:49,597
Well, it was great.

293
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:54,104
Okay, fine. Because we have not previously
Sun had a relationship,

294
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:56,490
So I can rest assured, that
You will find that good.

295
00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:00,312
Excuse me.

296
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:04,556
He has given me flowers.
He has given me flowers.

297
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,218
Stop it. This is real life,
This is not a fantasy ...

298
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:09,066
You should go and tell him
You how you feel.

299
00:22:09,134 --> 00:22:12,435
It is now or never. So, now.

300
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:14,486
Now! Go now!

301
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:48,427
Jane?

302
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:53,455
Sorry. George, this is my sister Tess.
Tess, this is my George ...

303
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:57,840
No, as I shall not.
-- Jane, my sister. My right hand.

304
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,799
Bofkont.

305
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:05,062
Yes, as a bit of everything I need,
It makes it.

306
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:07,799
As if I have not enough abuse
Make her ...

307
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:10,931
I have my receipt from the dry cleaning on
Filed her desk.

308
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:15,330
It was an emergency, so ...

309
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:17,968
Of course, a fake is not fold
Something to laugh.

310
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:20,303
Certainly not if he goes through to your socks.

311
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:28,831
Would you like a drink?

312
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:31,202
I am come to terms with
My sister to drink.

313
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:37,706
Hello, how is it?
Were the flowers not something too many?

314
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:42,292
They were yours?
You have them?

315
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:45,482
The angry huwelijkshater.

316
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:48,484
That is a good news.

317
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,212
Can you just hold this, please?

318
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:13,261
I am sorry.

319
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:18,694
Congratulations.

320
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:30,770
Sorry, what you also said again.

321
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:34,898
I asked whether you my flowers
Had received, and ...

322
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:40,660
Something for you. Let me give you something,
Please.

323
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:42,789
Thank God.
-- You had it in the taxi leave.

324
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:45,708
It was of the verlovingsfeest tonight,
Or Thursday waxen of bikinilijn.

325
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:48,411
So, I thought that ...
-- You have read it?

326
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:51,343
I tried to read,
But that was very difficult.

327
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:55,125
Your little notes that kriebelige

You know, thank you my calendar
Have reduced. That was very nice.

00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:10,213
It's just a drink, we go
Not here.

333
00:25:10,214 --> 00:25:12,212
It cites the sharp aspects
Cover.

334
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:16,304
A drink?
-- I am not a very ...

335
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:18,179
Good company tonight.

00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:25,389
Maybe I can come on Thursday against?
Or maybe not. I see you still.

338
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:29,692
Who was that? Where can I
Look like one?

339
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:30,640
Is he still back?

340
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:35,782
That was very convincing.
That I would never be able to. -- No, never.

341
00:25:41,804 --> 00:25:45,154
It is already late. You must have been exhausted.
Shall we go?

342
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:49,030
Let's dance.
-- What? George, do not.

343
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:53,596
I go very much. But I must warn you
I am terribly bad in dance. -- Come on.

344
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:56,943
In fact, I have on several occasions,
The doctor must call.

345
00:25:57,701 --> 00:26:00,174
Do you also believe in it, Jane?

346
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:05,687
No, but you go.
Enjoy.

347
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:06,853
Let's go.

348
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:35,547
Sleeping, Jane. Go to sleep.

349
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:38,616
Three hours.

350
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:25,774
Tess Hello, how was your date.

351
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:28,889
Feel not rot. I am an important
Part of his life ...

352
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,512
We make every hour, every day together.

353
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:37,004
Hello.
-- Hello. Still?

354
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:40,478
Yes, I am a bit
Cleaning.

355
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:43,875
Jane, you ...
I had ...

356
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:47,529
The best night of my life.
-- That's great.

357
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,987
I was totally forgotten ...

358
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:53,986
Is that weird for you?
-- Strange? Why should that be surprising?

359
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:57,116
He's my boss. Can my care.
-- Well, as we go to lunch tomorrow. 


360
00:27:57,117 --> 00:27:59,666
That's great.
-- Yes, I think that too.

361
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:02,592
Despite that my creditcart,
Negative.

362
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:05,058
Tell me about George?

363
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:10,035
Well, I ...

364
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,758
He has gone from school early.

365
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,460
And he has every top of the world
Climbed.

366
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:22,132
And when he started with E & A
From his apartment ...

367
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,203
And he has one of the most ecologically
Yours ...

368
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,967
Philanthropic cause of the world
Of it.

369
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:27,567
All before he was thirty.

370
00:28:27,568 --> 00:28:31,385
That is he, briefly summarized.
He is an incredible boss.

371
00:28:31,386 --> 00:28:32,893
Everybody likes him, everybody.

372
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:35,795
And he likes most of his dog Gatsby.

373
00:28:35,796 --> 00:28:37,889
He eats no red meat,
That is cool, and ...

374
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,903
He spends all his time to get outside
Door, then somewhere else.

375
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:42,632
That sounds great.

376
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:48,079
Yes, but he has flaws.
That he really.

377
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,938
He has flaws.
-- What do you mean?

378
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:56,632
He hates cashew nuts.
That is strange.

379
00:28:56,633 --> 00:29:00,629
And sometimes he bears no socks in
His sneakers. I think that is disgusting.

380
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,187
Jane, which are not really bother
An affair to disconnect.

381
00:29:05,314 --> 00:29:07,606
Affaire? What kind of an affair?

382
00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:10,860
I mean, there is nothing between you
Happened tonight?

383
00:29:11,804 --> 00:29:13,508
Well ...

384
00:29:15,918 --> 00:29:18,610
I understand you. Fun.

385
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,701
Hello, dear.
How is it with you?

386
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:40,626
Look at you.

387
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:43,517
Papa, it looks here still
Exactly the same.

388
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:46,359
That is not fair.
I have brand new ornaments.

389
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:49,427
I have already removed the furniture,
All of the woodwork, look ...

390
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:51,562
New cash register. Digital.

391
00:29:51,563 --> 00:29:55,718
Sorry Dad, I do not understand how all those
Remarkable improvements have been able to miss.

392
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,152
Give me that, but let us up.

393
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:02,419
Please.
-- Are we not a bit too old?

394
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,031
No.
-- Well, because I think they make good.

395
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:08,588
How long you stay here?

396
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,046
One or two weeks right?
That said you are.

397
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:16,442
That depends on how one couple
Things go.

398
00:30:16,443 --> 00:30:18,252
What kind of things?

399
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:20,766
What kind of things?

400
00:30:26,735 --> 00:30:31,891
Let me guess. Is there
A new boy behind her?

401
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:34,862
I would not support it
Are called.

402
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,051
Jane? -- What?
-- Is all well with you?

403
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:44,631
Yes, great.
Everything is good.

404
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,873
They call me, that I can assure you. I
A way to ...

405
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:08,551
The ladies to hand me the stabbing.
-- Yes, how?

406
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:21,166
You have one week from my calendar
Met, are you crazy?

407
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,688
Yes, that's a little experiment to see how
You do without any second ...

408
00:31:23,788 --> 00:31:25,875
Vastgepind of your life. Anyway,
Your life is crazy.

409
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,155
What do you do except work, and there
Ensure that people marry?

410
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:30,850
Yes, I really do not see what you are
Face it.

411
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,155
How can you meet that you indeed weddings
Afford?

412
00:31:33,628 --> 00:31:35,509
Such dresses, and air fares
And the wine of the month clubs?

413
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:38,883
People love as a gift. I
An honorary member, and sometimes they give me something for free.

414
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:41,579
That is a great pity that I am sorry
Really very much.

415
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:47,163
I make it well with you, I make a
New appointment. Perhaps today?

416
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:51,849
Yes, of course. I can slide in between, but that
You have already done. Every Saturday of the year.

00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:55,937
Are you? Can you not someone
Otherwise find with you?

00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,905
No, I will tell you something. If you agree
With someone you do not want to go ...

Of the 'big brother program "on the WI.

427
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:35,173
Tess, her sister Jane is a coincidence.

428
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,960
Hello, Pedro.

429
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:44,076
Listen Jane, Tess and I take Pedro
Account to his basketball game.

430
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:47,121
Would you go along?
-- I have so much work. I have to stay here.

431
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:49,912
Take me mislead you, Jane. Your boss is
Indeed still a bastard ...

432
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:52,136
Let's go, I need you
Not to dismiss.

433
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,159
Let me three sugar Pepsi, three chips ...

434
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:05,615
A chili dog, you want a chili dog?

435
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,519
No, unless the dog is a Tofu,
With chili without meat.

436
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:11,781
Sorry, what?
-- Are you a vegetarian?

437
00:33:12,094 --> 00:33:13,638
That is just pass.
-- Is that so?

438
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,928
Because I am also a vegetarian.

439
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,503
I was a vegan, but that
Is a bit too much fuss.

440
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:21,712
I know. Even for a vegetarian
To be a challenge, I mean ...

441
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:24,783
Every time we trekking, I must
Sapjes made my own and bring snacks.

442
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:27,006
You are trekking do?

443
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:30,108
You seem to me not the girl, that
A country walk ...

444
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:32,043
Certainly not with those shoes.

445
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:35,365
Do not so crazy, the best are made
Kid by Neales.

446
00:33:36,462 --> 00:33:39,443
I understand why you think that, but I love
Of all those things in nature ...

447
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:43,276
Such as walking, biking and climbing on things.

448
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,308
I must honestly say that I do not hike,
More have made since my dog is deceased ...

449
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:53,860
Jane and I had that dog when we
Small, Torry, I loved her ...

450
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:58,762
Which was of great hiking,
And climbing adventures ...

451
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:03,114
Not a day goes by that I
Vlooienbaal not to think.

452
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:05,715
The dog, Torry.

453
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:09,138
Why have you never had Torry?

454
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:14,201
I think I have the memory of Toby
Have repressed.

455
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:20,151
Yes, his name was Toby, but I mentioned
Torry him because I slisde.

456
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:22,815
You slisde, and so were your 'B's an R?

457
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:25,350
You know, when I was a child,
Stotterde when I do.

458
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:29,088
Really, we have more in common
Than I thought.

459
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:37,752
I must be "shaken Flies' with Pedro.

460
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:40,545
I am jealous, that sounds fun.

461
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:45,183
What are 'shaking flies'?
What do you mean? -- What?

462
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:47,517
You hate dogs and Tofu, and you hate it
In the natural order of things to do.

463
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:51,074
No, I like a garden, I love
Flowers, I love brown ...

464
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:53,531
That is not exactly the same.
-- And you hated Toby.

465
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:56,931
You hated him, the only animals
Where you gave to ronddraaiden who were killed.

466
00:34:57,243 --> 00:35:00,668
You say that all because George
So attractive.

467
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,277
Or some people think.
-- I hated that dog.

468
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:05,525
I hated it only if he so
On me at the kwijlen.

469
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:08,493
And I would be able to keep buttermilk,
Trekking if I would try.

470
00:35:09,244 --> 00:35:10,396
Maybe.

471
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:14,593
Tess, come here once, and
Try to see how you do that.

472
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,479
Fun, we now 'shaken'.

473
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:23,047
You know how to do this?
-- No, I do not know what I should do.

474
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:44,588
Liefs, George.

475
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,714
That's great.

476
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,784
In sign language this means,
'I love you'.

477
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:55,826
I also love you, Tess.

478
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:21,511
Which is the least awful?
-- This.

479
00:37:22,962 --> 00:37:25,723
Would you like to help again?

480
00:37:25,724 --> 00:37:27,865
I helped my father always.

481
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,373
Is all well with you?
You look a little nervous.

482
00:37:36,368 --> 00:37:39,779
What does it look like?
-- Great.

483
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,653
Please.
-- Thank you.

484
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,524
Will you marry me

485
00:38:22,128 --> 00:38:25,386
Boys, wait a moment.
It is not.

486
00:38:29,637 --> 00:38:33,087
I am sorry, I should have been calling ...

487
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:34,669
But you have forgotten your wallet.

488
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,845
Thanks.

489
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:40,562
Sorry, I am too late.

490
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:48,388
Jane, what's going on?

491
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:09,586
Do you even sit down?

492
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,569
My parents have met when she
Were playing at a friend's ...

493
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:20,607
When they were eight years old, and they are
Married forty-two years ...

494
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:25,488
And I have waited my whole life to the
Feeling that my father to my mother had ...

495
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:29,312
Maybe I am too busy,
With something of myself,

496
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,880
And I missed some of those moments.

497
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:37,616
From the moment that I saw you, I knew
That we would fit well together.

498
00:39:37,617 --> 00:39:40,963
So ...

499
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,570
Tess, do you want to marry me?
-- Yes, of course I would like that.

500
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,119
Does this mean that you back here
Gremo moving?

501
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:07,726
I do not know what I should say,
Jane first give you a job ...

502
00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:10,352
Tess then again to toe,
George you are my hero. That, I believe.

503
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:13,400
Thank you! You have a great couple
Girls.

504
00:40:14,952 --> 00:40:18,578
Wait, I want to retrieve.
Ga go nowhere.

505
00:40:21,772 --> 00:40:24,867
I am so excited that we
Have done today.

506
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,859
I am so happy.

507
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:35,051
Your mother would want you
Gets them.

508
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:37,027
Thank you.

509
00:40:37,028 --> 00:40:39,966
Thank you.

510
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,840
Jane, you think it is not bad?
-- No.

511
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,434
You can use it after me.
-- It is good, that's what mama ...

512
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:48,665
Mum would have wanted.

513
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:54,453
That is my mother.

514
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:59,078
Is that not great.
-- It's beautiful.

515
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:01,483
Papa, I do not know what I should say.

516
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:06,648
I spend a lot to figure out, why
You wanted to agree with me.

517
00:41:06,649 --> 00:41:09,256
You have always avoided me, and
Suddenly ...

518
00:41:09,257 --> 00:41:12,345
My sister is married.
-- Rather than yours.

519
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:14,790
Therefore, I am not upset.
-- What did you or upset.

520
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:17,771
You know Tess not, she likes that I
All ga ...

521
00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:21,867
I will not only her bruidsmeisje,
But I will do everything must go.

522
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:24,886
Why should you say no no.
-- What?

523
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:25,887
Say no.

524
00:41:27,627 --> 00:41:29,435
You have surely no earlier
Against people said?

525
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:31,650
Yes, of course.

526
00:41:31,651 --> 00:41:36,174
Very often, but in such a situation
Never. Not once.

527
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:38,199
But you want to say no.

528
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,370
But I can not.
It is my sister.

529
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:43,597
But you can not say no, because
It is your sister.

530
00:41:43,598 --> 00:41:46,146
You know what we are going to do,
We are going to pursue.

531
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:47,671
We will exercise the power to say no.

532
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:51,187
Do you run to me, we are going
The game play. Put me that pleasure.

533
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:55,302
Jane, give me fifty dollars.
-- No.

534
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:58,521
Jane, it's only fifty dollars.
I pay you back. -- No.

535
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:06,744
Jane, I would like
You give me fifty dollars.

536
00:42:08,535 --> 00:42:10,829
No.

537
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:17,717
Then I take your drink.
-- No.

538
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:20,315
You do it so well.

539
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:22,564
That's terrible.

540
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,223
So you were at the store
And have the thanks ordered.

541
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:29,878
And the invitations.
-- V.

542
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:30,842
This is so much fun.

543
00:42:31,413 --> 00:42:33,746
Have I told you that I have asked Julie
Whether they want one of the bridesmaids?

544
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:37,500
Who?
-- Nicht Julie, the second nicht ...

545
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:40,904
And Mimi, nicht Mimi.

546
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:44,292
Really, who is pregnant,
That is not aesthetic.

547
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:47,892
I am sorry, I know that you
Not Julie.

548
00:42:47,893 --> 00:42:50,103
Why would I not a woman
Keep that asks whether I at ...

549
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:53,172
"Ienieminie tietenclub 'hear, and
That throughout my teens.

550
00:42:53,853 --> 00:42:57,340
Do not listen to her, your breasts came
There. She missed only secondary school.

551
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:00,560
And for the third bruidsmeisje I
Ask your girlfriend, who brutal.

552
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,816
Casey? -- Yes.
-- My Casey?

553
00:43:02,817 --> 00:43:05,410
She is very beautiful, it can be
Strapless.

554
00:43:05,411 --> 00:43:08,611
I do not have many friends. Every one of
Other girls me why not.

555
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:10,334
I do not know why.

556
00:43:10,335 --> 00:43:12,859
Well, I do know why.

557
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:14,935
If you just ask her?

558
00:43:17,564 --> 00:43:18,980
Sure.

559
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:22,630
We can also do a slide show,
Dinner at the trial ...

560
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:25,603
Like photos of George and me together,
We say funny things.

561
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:28,864
You know what, that writer where you
So obsessed are ...

562
00:43:28,865 --> 00:43:31,870
He wants a whole 'commitment column'
Making us' the journal. "

563
00:43:31,873 --> 00:43:35,392
He called me, can you believe that?
-- I can certainly not.

564
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:39,464
I have a lot of thought about what you said,
And I think you certainly have equal.

565
00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:41,213
I think it would be so special,

566
00:43:41,214 --> 00:43:43,312
If I would keep a wedding exactly
Such as that of a mom and dad.

567
00:43:43,313 --> 00:43:47,241
Certainly if I mama's dress wear, then ...

568
00:43:48,181 --> 00:43:50,188
The Boothuis?

569
00:43:52,223 --> 00:43:55,342
When I first called, they said,
That nothing was available ...

570
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:58,160
The first eighteen months. But when I
For the ninth time called ...

571
00:43:58,161 --> 00:43:59,449
They said that someone had cancelled.

572
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,168
Apparently the bride Saturday with the bruidegoms
Father and brother and sister and all those people ...

573
00:44:04,169 --> 00:44:08,130
And when it was cancelled, they were
All destroyed, but ...

574
00:44:08,131 --> 00:44:10,930
Which means that we have three weeks
To marry.

575
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:12,417
Three weeks?

576
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:14,420
Jane, I know that you quickly
For each other.

577
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,162
I would indeed not so long
Wait, then ...

578
00:44:23,296 --> 00:44:25,510
This is a bit of good news for me
Able to find.

579
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:28,446
That's me, it's only ...

580
00:44:28,447 --> 00:44:33,474
That you also mama's dress in the boathouse
Wanted to marry. I know.

581
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:39,458
I did not realize that you wanted,
But if it is ...

582
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:41,929
I just want that you are happy.
That you know.

583
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,417
Can we now have more important things to talk?

584
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:48,114
I think the tablecloths really not fun.

585
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:49,814
And I think we need to hire new,

586
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:51,996
Because they do not fit in the costume
I have chosen.

587
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,306
Those selfish whore.

588
00:44:58,937 --> 00:45:01,639
I can not believe it. There is no one
Who would fall for her.

589
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,337
Even as a goedzak as George.

590
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:06,337
Men are simply gehypnotiseerd
By her voodoo ...

591
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:07,978
And then they lose their common sense.

592
00:45:08,061 --> 00:45:10,882
You can be the wedding of your sister does not regulate
With the man from whom you. That is sick.

593
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:15,310
To be honest, they did not know what I
Felt for him. And he's my boss.

594
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:18,756
I have come to see over there.
I have no choice.

595
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:22,738
And you do not. She wants you
Bruidsmeisje her.

596
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:25,513
You take me in the zeik.

597
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,584
No, I do not.
I am in principle.

598
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:33,835
I say no, I am in principle.
Calculate but not to me.

599
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:35,709
Please, let me not only
With all this.

600
00:45:36,787 --> 00:45:40,625
Well, because you are. But if it for me
Cross it, they get a trap under her ass.

601
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:44,056
And then I give you a trap below
Your ass. Then I take a couple of drinks, and ...

602
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:50,742
There is no sign that says
Not talking.

603
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:58,176
Three weeks? That does not succeed.

604
00:45:58,177 --> 00:46:01,480
That is not enough time for one of
My creations.

605
00:46:02,777 --> 00:46:06,588
Remember you can still, that I Shacktor's
Are you brought?

606
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:09,874
And they ordered that six floors
Heart masterpiece.

607
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:15,388
And of course, that tower of the Adebelgifts,
Fiësta for those outside.

608
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:17,408
You can listen to everything and that we know both.

609
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:20,841
So you make the cake, and you make him
About three weeks, please.

610
00:46:21,563 --> 00:46:24,775
Three weeks? That would be me
A pleasure.

611
00:46:24,776 --> 00:46:26,482
Delicious.

612
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:33,158
What are you doing here?
-- I am Malcolm Doyle.

613
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:36,932
What? I would not believe it until
You here.

614
00:46:36,933 --> 00:46:41,701
This is my fiancé, George.
-- Hi, congratulated both of you.

615
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:48,117
I have to include it. If
A 'tart emergency' is, I am here.

616
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,806
This is Jane, my sister. It
Obsessed with your stories.

617
00:46:51,807 --> 00:46:54,920
It saves them, but if they do
They suggest, but that it does so.

618
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:56,973
It is your greatest fan.

619
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:01,090
But not in a narrow way.

620
00:47:01,374 --> 00:47:04,713
You said that you called Kevin.

621
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:09,119
I use Malcolm in the byline, so
I do not gestalkt by bruidjes mad.

622
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,812
How did you meet George.
-- Klootzak.

623
00:47:12,975 --> 00:47:16,386
He said that he called Kevin, I am
A little confused.

624
00:47:16,387 --> 00:47:19,290
Wait. You know each other.

625
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:21,965
We work both in the trouwcircuit, then ...

626
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,128
Can you give us even excused.
I have very even talk about you.

627
00:47:28,276 --> 00:47:30,270
Why you lied to me?

628
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:34,296
No, I said that I was a writer,
Not what I wrote.

629
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,737
But, you wrote the most beautiful things.

630
00:47:38,738 --> 00:47:41,760
Believe you actually in the marriage, and do
You pretend you are a cynic ...

631
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,556
Or are you really a cynic, who knows how
Nonsense he must sell to girls like me.

632
00:47:46,557 --> 00:47:50,452
I could not follow that at all, but
I think the second, which sell nonsense.

633
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,087
It feels as if I have discovered that
Liefdesliedje my favorite ...

634
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:55,797
On a zeemonster.

635
00:47:57,515 --> 00:47:59,258
Can I address you here for you
George and me to tell?

636
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:01,622
Sure. That is why I am here.

637
00:48:26,175 --> 00:48:28,109
What? Tess is not.

638
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,036
I am for you.
-- Why?

639
00:48:32,071 --> 00:48:35,078
Come on, I have friends with all
And family talk.

640
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:37,931
It takes five minutes, please?

641
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:41,231
For George and Tess?

642
00:48:45,944 --> 00:48:47,442
Thank you.

643
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,347
Can I come inside.
-- Ask me just ask what you want.

644
00:48:50,348 --> 00:48:52,178
Whether you prefer to have
More lie.

645
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,819
I have not lied to you.
I do not know why you always say that.

646
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,407
I might have a few things left out.
-- Can we handle this?

647
00:48:57,716 --> 00:49:01,046
It is bruidsmeisje
A strange young woman.

648
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,556
Vertels agree how you feel about your
Tess its romance.

649
00:49:06,557 --> 00:49:09,556
I could not be happier, it is my
Little sister. I have her learn clock watch ...

650
00:49:09,557 --> 00:49:12,866
I have learned its bicycles, how they
The dishwasher must operate.

651
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,541
I have nearly raised.

652
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:17,360
Pressure to please not go away, that would
My father his death.

653
00:49:20,072 --> 00:49:21,774
Wait. What are they?

654
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,255
Nothing.

655
00:49:25,543 --> 00:49:27,063
Is it ...?
No.

656
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:33,063
Your bridesmaids dresses?
-- These are not your things.

657
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:39,565
Have you kept all. You
A whole closet full. Why?

658
00:49:39,973 --> 00:49:42,301
I have a lot of friends.
And I like to keep them.

659
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:46,013
That I understand completely.
Because they are beautiful.

660
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:48,286
They are not so bad.
-- Not so bad?

661
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,581
I would like to see one,
Which is not so bad.

662
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:56,552
Where have I heard of him?
This.

663
00:49:57,158 --> 00:49:58,213
Seriously.

664
00:49:58,716 --> 00:50:02,005
Vreselijk. Bedoel you that word.
What color is it. Braaksel?

665
00:50:02,454 --> 00:50:06,680
That is olive green, which is very.
And it is very beautiful.

666
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:10,865
No, I tell you that this is a martelinstrument
, You imposed by a bride ...

667
00:50:12,307 --> 00:50:14,299
Who wants to be that you look ugly.
-- No, Janna has chosen ...

668
00:50:14,775 --> 00:50:15,478
Because everyone well.

669
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:18,204
Has lichtelijke waanvoorstelling, and
Believe everything everyone tells her.

670
00:50:18,811 --> 00:50:20,803
That is not true, and I will show you
That you have that wrong.

671
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:38,778
You see, but not that bad.
This side is very beautiful.

672
00:50:39,555 --> 00:50:42,637
Well, you are right about the dress.
That's not so bad, but ...

673
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:44,767
The color, please.

674
00:50:47,013 --> 00:50:50,374
I think it is by your flash
, Which leaves it strange to look ...

675
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,678
In a normal ...
It is not really beautiful.

676
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:55,124
It looks a bit like
A shiny mermaid.

677
00:50:55,901 --> 00:50:58,461
But you, you should feel flattered that they
Not next to a beautiful woman wanted so long ...

678
00:50:58,854 --> 00:51:01,021
And you actually wanted neatly
From show.

679
00:51:04,788 --> 00:51:06,780
It is actually not the worst.
If I should choose one from ...

680
00:51:07,452 --> 00:51:09,036
That would be so.

681
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:16,573
What's that?
-- Bruiloftsthema.

682
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,141
What was the topic?
Humiliation?

683
00:51:20,966 --> 00:51:23,388
People can not go to that kind of weddings.
-- I am there to three.

684
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:34,580
There's still something.

685
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:40,878
This you must still show.
-- Enter here.

686
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:56,947
Very beautiful. Feel you your beautiful?
-- Aanbiddelijk.

687
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,779
Every bride loves
Its accessories.

688
00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:05,036
Men wore dresses,
Women wore suits.

689
00:52:25,452 --> 00:52:27,698
What was the theme there.
-- Wedding in L.A.

690
00:53:03,817 --> 00:53:06,394
Twenty-seven dresses, you take me
In the leg.

691
00:53:06,755 --> 00:53:10,577
I do not understand. You do your thing,
You have the dress, just throw it away.

692
00:53:11,049 --> 00:53:14,289
This is a big closet, you live in
New York you can space if not verkwisten.

693
00:53:14,723 --> 00:53:17,269
How strange that sounds, I
Had a very nice time, in those dresses.

694
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:19,276
So strange as that may be.
-- I think you do not.

695
00:53:19,844 --> 00:53:21,901
It does not matter to me if someone is me
A rare dress wants to contribute.

696
00:53:22,307 --> 00:53:24,300
It is their day, not mine.
-- God bless you.

697
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,075
And if it means to support them
If they marry, that I ...

698
00:53:27,428 --> 00:53:29,277
Snowshoes with the Ridge
Of the Alps should ...

699
00:53:29,948 --> 00:53:31,884
Or with a rod catch swans, then ...

700
00:53:32,365 --> 00:53:36,156
Have you really done?
-- I am a very good angler.

701
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:40,731
Hou of angling.

702
00:53:43,228 --> 00:53:46,411
Seriously how much time you have to
That for other people to do?

703
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:48,890
What has happened to you?
Have you no demands?

704
00:53:49,307 --> 00:53:50,964
No, I did not.
I am Jesus.

705
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:56,299
One day, God will know when,
But at a time ...

706
00:53:57,741 --> 00:53:59,146
It will be my day.

707
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,325
And then all those people
For me, so ...

708
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,914
If I ever ...

709
00:54:44,978 --> 00:54:46,370
I have your aantekeningenlijst needed.

710
00:54:46,724 --> 00:54:48,578
I thought you would wait below.

711
00:54:52,274 --> 00:54:53,234
What's that?

712
00:54:54,106 --> 00:54:55,770
George is in Talleyrand.
Who's inside?

713
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:57,824
Nobody.
Let us in the hall talking.

714
00:55:00,915 --> 00:55:02,330
He was looking for a part time job.

715
00:55:04,185 --> 00:55:05,930
He makes the apartment clean.

716
00:55:07,258 --> 00:55:09,441
Tell it is not for George. It is
A secret between Pedro and me.

717
00:55:14,058 --> 00:55:16,049
What do you do now about
Bridesmaids that story.

718
00:55:17,826 --> 00:55:19,706
It is still unworked, I am
Still doing.

719
00:55:20,144 --> 00:55:22,426
I want to see. -- I am ...
Mail it to me.

720
00:55:23,192 --> 00:55:25,185
It is still not finished.
I am still not ready.

721
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:36,186
Can you please leave.
I have not invited you.

722
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:39,290
Tess did, if I have a wedding's
Reportage make, I have to see every aspect.

723
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,569
Your sister wants so many different
Offers from many different stores ...

724
00:55:43,914 --> 00:55:45,674
That they are not all they physically
Can register.

725
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:47,729
She has little time.
It is a short Engagement.

726
00:55:48,858 --> 00:55:49,967
Great God, another?

727
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:52,666
For you it's just another
Ovenschotel, but Tess ...

728
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:55,107
It is the pan in which it my mothers
Fried meat for Christmas in.

729
00:55:55,556 --> 00:55:56,498
Can Tess cooking?

730
00:55:57,786 --> 00:55:59,563
Well, I am going to cook, but Tess
Will attend.

731
00:56:00,242 --> 00:56:01,803
With George.

732
00:56:02,332 --> 00:56:03,546
This is not just a vase.

733
00:56:03,955 --> 00:56:07,987
This is a vase that will tackle as Tess
George flowers back home.

734
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:11,010
Just as he had done before whim.
-- I understand it.

735
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:15,858
And this is the paraplustandaard with rooster,
George who already have umbrellas bear.

736
00:56:17,714 --> 00:56:19,275
Well, but showed a sukkel.

737
00:56:19,955 --> 00:56:22,162
I just say that it's not just
Stuff.

738
00:56:22,786 --> 00:56:24,354
These are things that one life
Together.

739
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:27,396
This is the worthless junk that
The twenty-seven trillion dollars a year ...

740
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,170
Trouwindustrie it has convinced us
That we need ...

741
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:31,987
Or else we are not happy.

742
00:56:32,474 --> 00:56:35,698
You know what I think? I think that all of your
Statistics and theories a rookscherm.

743
00:56:36,771 --> 00:56:38,625
Seriously, what?
-- Your little secret. 


744
00:56:39,097 --> 00:56:42,385
Whatever it is. Your parents are divorced.
You have not found the right girl ...

745
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,898
You are afraid that you
Never will.

746
00:56:45,354 --> 00:56:46,859
And I think you so much
Of weddings hold because ...

747
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,970
You prefer you prefer to focus on other people
Their 'kodak moments' ...

748
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:51,194
Than memories to themselves.
-- You are right.

749
00:56:51,563 --> 00:56:54,138
Weddings are the perfect place to
Forgetting that you are single.

750
00:56:54,499 --> 00:56:56,642
I think you to a wedding,
Not marriage but a wedding.

751
00:56:57,523 --> 00:56:58,592
What is your problem?

752
00:56:59,203 --> 00:57:01,930
Had you your own special wedding, and
Your wife you sometimes abandoned?

753
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:05,920
Bingo.
-- What?

754
00:57:07,737 --> 00:57:10,706
With my roommate from college
Indeed, so there you get a bingo.

755
00:57:16,723 --> 00:57:18,848
I am sorry, I was only at the gambling.

756
00:57:19,472 --> 00:57:23,113
That was a good one, for a woman who
No insight into himself.

757
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:25,569
Save the nail precisely on its head.

758
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:29,969
Do you lelijkste stuff from the store
, And note that for Tess?

759
00:57:33,913 --> 00:57:35,184
Let us do that.

760
00:57:46,648 --> 00:57:49,007
I said that I still have not finished.
-- No, it's good.

761
00:57:49,794 --> 00:57:51,416
I referred to that the fact
Very reasonable.

762
00:57:52,257 --> 00:57:55,400
I must admit that I was shocked,
It is neatly ...

763
00:57:56,567 --> 00:57:59,577
And funny and amusing as hell.

764
00:58:00,425 --> 00:58:02,177
Thank you.
-- You have to really deal with that girl.

765
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:04,696
We print it, Sunday.
Front page.

766
00:58:07,768 --> 00:58:09,777
Now would you do have to jump up and down
From gratitude.

767
00:58:11,457 --> 00:58:15,599
No, I think that it is not perfect
. I want this really well ...

768
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:19,041
Wait even a week.
-- You are already months to the begging, and now ...

769
00:58:19,368 --> 00:58:21,688
Do you want me to the story retainer, so
You do what you can comment.

770
00:58:22,048 --> 00:58:24,311
That, I do not.
She is more than that eternal bruidsmeisje.

771
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:28,136
There is much more to her.

772
00:58:28,663 --> 00:58:31,911
If I knew you better not, I would say
You like her.

773
00:58:33,704 --> 00:58:35,407
Good. I know that I can do better.

774
00:58:36,032 --> 00:58:37,791
It is good as it is.
-- If you give me a week?

775
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:41,584
One week only.
-- Well, go away.

776
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:51,056
Thank you so quickly could.
-- That is not a problem.

777
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,637
I am glad that I can help.
And I have experience with food ...

778
00:58:54,023 --> 00:58:55,414
Tess then. So you are
In good hands.

779
00:58:55,974 --> 00:58:59,101
We according bruiloftsdiner
According to your exact specifications planned.

780
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,646
I think it's a great piece,
I think that you are very pleased with it.

781
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:19,368
Do you know sometimes where Jane?

782
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,957
What I find fun to Tess,
That there is no nonsense.

783
00:59:23,662 --> 00:59:25,020
She is not afraid to be herself.

784
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,214
About Tess, there is something I want to say ...

785
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:40,718
I am so happy for you that you found
Have before you were looking for.

786
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,501
What is your favorite part in
A wedding?

787
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,358
That's easy.

788
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:49,773
You know, when the music starts, and the bride
Begins its grand entrance,

789
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:52,982
And everyone turned to in order to
Her watch. Then, I look to the bridegroom.

790
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:56,788
To his face, it is pure love there.

791
00:59:58,366 --> 00:59:59,933
Therefore I will also go.

792
01:00:01,422 --> 01:00:02,807
If you get married and you make your
Entree ...

793
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:04,863
Then I have your permission to
To the bridegroom look?

794
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,087
Yes, please do so. And make sure
The poor sukkel intact.

795
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,754
Take me in your leg, a man has
Lucky if you can get it.

796
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,271
And the way that you tomato
Attacked, who would be able to resist.

797
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,718
Very sexy.

798
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:36,960
What are you doing here?
-- The bruiloftsdiner out.

799
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,397
Where's Tess?

800
01:00:41,062 --> 01:00:43,151
She lets her hair done.

801
01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:45,792
I am only helping.

802
01:00:46,512 --> 01:00:49,190
We are going to soon Reinbek for some tablecloths
From antique to fetch.

803
01:00:49,711 --> 01:00:51,902
Yes, we should really go. Tess and I
Go to my parents eat.

804
01:00:52,374 --> 01:00:53,813
Why am I not with you.

805
01:00:54,303 --> 01:00:56,806
No, I make sure, however, that you
Back in time are.

806
01:00:57,255 --> 01:00:59,342
No, if we do not act we go
Outside our booklet.

807
01:00:59,694 --> 01:01:03,118
It is certainly good, I wanted you indeed still
A few questions about that article.

808
01:01:03,677 --> 01:01:05,503
That I will gladly by telephone or
E-mail reply.

809
01:01:05,846 --> 01:01:08,069
If you do not mind find?
That would really help me.

810
01:01:08,408 --> 01:01:10,383
I think it is not at all bad,
I stand on it.

811
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:18,663
It's like a light bulb. As you
The daydream was to the polenta.

812
01:01:19,206 --> 01:01:21,006
Of course you are overstuur. You plant
The marriage of your sister ...

813
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:22,999
With the man where you are in love.

814
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:25,045
You stuck in this narrow love
Triangle ...

815
01:01:25,535 --> 01:01:28,350
And all the time you are not far from road
To get a bullet through your head shots.

816
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,285
That is ridiculous.

817
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:33,541
Of course you can not say that.
You are that nice Jane, sweet Jane.

818
01:01:33,934 --> 01:01:35,966
You do not know what you talking about.
He's my boss ...

819
01:01:36,372 --> 01:01:39,540
She is my sister. I find it amazing
To care for their wedding.

820
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:42,237
Just as I am for everyone,
Where I am at.

821
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:44,813
You can not understand,
Because you ...

822
01:01:45,365 --> 01:01:47,294
Are common, and dark and
Cynical ...

823
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:49,935
That's your problem friend, not
Mine.

824
01:01:50,351 --> 01:01:52,197
Friends? -- Yes.
Hello friend.

825
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:54,404
Friend, you calls me friend.

826
01:01:54,781 --> 01:01:55,949
If you keep your mouth.

827
01:01:58,238 --> 01:02:00,310
I get the picture, you are evil. You are
All afternoon ...

828
01:02:00,853 --> 01:02:03,046
To grieve over someone
You will never have.

829
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:05,269
Keep it there.

830
01:02:08,341 --> 01:02:10,052
Can you what slower driving, so
I can read the signs?

831
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:15,172
My detectieapparaat will not work very well.
Drive something slower.

832
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:16,917
Leave me alone.

833
01:02:19,254 --> 01:02:21,915
Are you crazy, lady.
We still slip soon. Drive slower.

834
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:24,316
We slip.

835
01:02:25,605 --> 01:02:26,837
We slip.

836
01:02:41,781 --> 01:02:43,516
Say nothing.

837
01:02:59,069 --> 01:03:00,434
Did you sign?

838
01:03:06,034 --> 01:03:07,996
I said no. Nothing.

839
01:03:23,523 --> 01:03:24,691
Your phone does not.

840
01:03:25,277 --> 01:03:27,643
Well done, you look like
One of those boys from CSI.

841
01:03:29,356 --> 01:03:30,845
Can we maybe your phone
Even use?

842
01:03:31,437 --> 01:03:33,115
Can I get a Scotch, no ice.

843
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:36,353
What do you mean?
-- It is late, we get no sleepwagen ...

844
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:40,065
We are in the east of York.
I go have a drink.

845
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:46,804
There is no one who can help you now, take a seat
Do quietly and take a drink.

846
01:03:47,762 --> 01:03:49,418
It is a long day.

847
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,627
One only.

848
01:04:01,146 --> 01:04:02,641
Well, on February 12, 2006.

849
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:07,826
The Keller wedding. You wrote a column
I do beroerde to tears.

850
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:10,118
It was simply the best
That I had ever read.

851
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:12,558
That I do not remember.
-- How can you not remember you?

852
01:04:13,064 --> 01:04:15,295
I remember not.
-- How can that, it was the herdenkingdag ...

853
01:04:15,663 --> 01:04:17,206
Of the death of their father. Their brother
Came by plane from Afghanistan ...

854
01:04:17,709 --> 01:04:19,008
As an emotion you can not play.

855
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:21,117
Yes, a good writer can.
-- You are not so good.

856
01:04:26,406 --> 01:04:27,663
Delicious.

857
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:31,541
There must be something about weddings,
That you really love.

858
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,278
Free drink.
-- No.

859
01:04:39,652 --> 01:04:42,231
When the bride arrives, and they
Makes her grand entrance ...

860
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:46,294
I look to the poor who sukkel
Get married.

861
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:51,935
Because even though I think he is an idiot,
Because he voluntarily in recent lawful ...

862
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:53,541
Form of slavery enter ...

863
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:56,936
He still very happy.

864
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:00,069
And for one reason or another ...

865
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:04,221
Why, you look damn
So to me?

866
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:07,820
Take me in your leg? -- What?
That is my favorite part.

867
01:05:10,925 --> 01:05:12,621
We think somewhere the same.

868
01:05:15,805 --> 01:05:17,350
Statistically speaking, had that happen.

869
01:05:18,132 --> 01:05:20,150
I think you just have to admit,
That you are a great watje.

870
01:05:20,652 --> 01:05:22,196
That this whole hassle cynical, but
But an act, so that you ...

871
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:25,785
There may seem mysterious and sexy.

872
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:28,952
What was that last?
-- What?

873
01:05:29,688 --> 01:05:31,762
Did you sexy? -- Wat.
Do you think I am sexy.

874
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:35,536
It is not that bad as you can find.
-- I think this is not.

875
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,056
Am I sexy?
-- No, I think that you will find yourself sexy ...

876
01:05:38,439 --> 01:05:41,238
I mean that.
-- You think that I think that I am sexy?

877
01:05:45,263 --> 01:05:47,110
Great song.
-- I love that song.

878
01:05:55,671 --> 01:05:57,566
Those are the words not.
-- Those are the exact words.

879
01:05:58,344 --> 01:06:00,925
Sorry, 'text of the song police. "
What are the words?

880
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:07,622
'Brullend sound'?

881
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:29,718
I cried like a baby on
The Keller's their wedding.

882
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,446
Good day, sunshine.

883
01:08:13,276 --> 01:08:15,157
Please.
-- Thank you.

884
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:17,356
The sleepwagen is now underway.

885
01:08:21,443 --> 01:08:23,725
I want you know that I
This was never done.

886
01:08:24,298 --> 01:08:26,499
No, really. I never do this.

887
01:08:27,828 --> 01:08:31,987
Seriously, I know. You said last night
Ever again, 'I never do this. "

888
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:37,307
I just wanted that you knew.

889
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,259
Here's your order.

890
01:08:49,868 --> 01:08:51,371
Even something else?
-- No, thank you very much.

891
01:08:53,402 --> 01:08:56,366
That was great.
-- Thanks.

892
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,373
I see you still.

893
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:10,493
I sang 'Benny and the Jets' last night,
Or not?

894
01:09:11,373 --> 01:09:14,236
Very hard. I just want to say
You a little minor sang.

895
01:09:14,773 --> 01:09:18,036
Sorry, I? And what about you, you sang something
That only dogs can hear.

896
01:09:18,478 --> 01:09:19,611
What?
-- Seriously.

897
01:09:25,903 --> 01:09:28,591
You are that girl.
-- I am Benny, he is the Jets.

898
01:09:29,902 --> 01:09:32,168
It's that girl from the newspaper.
-- Which newspaper?

899
01:09:37,055 --> 01:09:39,479
Always, Always. Always a Bruidsmeisje
By Malcolm Doyle?

900
01:09:41,192 --> 01:09:42,463
What is this?

901
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:49,046
Let me explain.

902
01:09:56,684 --> 01:09:58,149
I have my editor said that it
Not had copies.

903
01:09:58,639 --> 01:10:00,335
Who reads that fact?

904
01:10:00,749 --> 01:10:02,430
Would you please ...

905
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,622
What's damn happened?
You said that you would stick.

906
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,880
You make those decisions not,
I do.

907
01:10:24,493 --> 01:10:27,294
I am not even able to tell her,
She was there to attacks.

908
01:10:27,782 --> 01:10:30,142
Let me give you twenty-four inches
In the Sunday.

909
01:10:30,843 --> 01:10:33,163
You would at this time only
'I love you' have to say.

910
01:10:43,715 --> 01:10:44,938
How could you calling me this?

911
01:10:46,114 --> 01:10:49,514
If the prototype of Jane
A gedienstig bruidsmeisje, then ...

912
01:10:49,849 --> 01:10:54,106
Tess is her sister, the model of a
Arrogant pampered bride in play,

913
01:10:54,556 --> 01:11:00,202
If one thing goes wrong deposit Manhattan.
She eats fire and stores aircraft from the air.

914
01:11:01,746 --> 01:11:03,865
I had no idea that an article he
About me to write.

915
01:11:04,241 --> 01:11:07,537
He called me 'bruidzilla "
The New York Journal.

916
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:11,164
I can assure him documents cracks,
Bit for bit.

917
01:11:14,985 --> 01:11:16,867
What?
-- Can I even Jane, please.

918
01:11:18,633 --> 01:11:21,291
The only person you will account
Talk is my lawyer.

919
01:11:21,802 --> 01:11:23,809
And I am not even a lawyer,
But I am sure one.

920
01:11:24,386 --> 01:11:25,514
Klootzak.

921
01:11:30,122 --> 01:11:31,123
I have here.

922
01:11:32,232 --> 01:11:35,265
But you can better the traffic police
Warn, because 'bruidzilla' is Friday.

923
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,536
Kevin, call me no more.

924
01:11:58,184 --> 01:12:01,631
Before you say anything goes,
You can not say anything?

925
01:12:03,311 --> 01:12:06,704
I do not understand where
Have you talking about?

926
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:11,769
It is not important.
It is an article ...

927
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:15,648
On the front with one million photos
Yours.

928
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:18,288
Who's upset?

929
01:12:27,768 --> 01:12:31,376
Let me explain. I had
No idea what he was writing.

930
01:12:31,808 --> 01:12:35,168
That boy was a dick. He made abuse
Yours. Do not worry about it.

931
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:38,353
I know. But I talked to
Need to see, I regret it.

932
01:12:38,799 --> 01:12:42,279
Bid does not ever apologize to you,
I can only inward created ...

933
01:12:42,839 --> 01:12:45,510
For me there to ensure that it
Well with you.

934
01:12:48,432 --> 01:12:50,183
Well, I have felt better.

935
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,287
I try to come through it.

936
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:55,576
I am not concerned about, right?

937
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:58,191
Has anyone here read that piece?
-- No.

938
01:13:04,527 --> 01:13:07,631
So, after we have had, it would
I do not ... Jane, are you?

939
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,790
We are talking about it later.

940
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:15,994
I have thought a lot about that
Failure of an article ...

941
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:18,014
I have decided to forgive you.

942
01:13:18,904 --> 01:13:21,455
You trust someone just too fast, and I
Do not think that it is your fault.

943
01:13:22,086 --> 01:13:23,768
That is very good of you Tess, thank you.

944
01:13:24,216 --> 01:13:26,201
Are you my list to the nalopen?

945
01:13:26,711 --> 01:13:29,741
About the slide show, I know exactly
What I want you to say is, then ...

946
01:13:30,088 --> 01:13:32,552
So that I listed.
And dad says that you have all the family photos ...

947
01:13:33,062 --> 01:13:35,046
So I tell you, George
Also to you.

948
01:13:36,695 --> 01:13:38,798
Here, look here. And just look here
But to.

949
01:13:39,342 --> 01:13:41,454
Then you are not again
Embarrassment.

950
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:45,532
Here it is.

951
01:13:52,181 --> 01:13:53,781
It is beautiful.
-- We must separate buttons.

952
01:13:59,558 --> 01:14:00,750
What do you think about it?

953
01:14:03,781 --> 01:14:05,165
I thought you mama's dress belt?

954
01:14:05,773 --> 01:14:08,756
It's mom's dress.
Well, parts of it.

955
01:14:09,286 --> 01:14:13,117
It was so old-fashioned. So we have
There here and there pieces of what used.

956
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:15,279
Pieces?
-- Yes.

957
01:14:15,828 --> 01:14:17,428
Like this, and this side.

958
01:14:24,636 --> 01:14:26,067
You have in your mother's wedding dress cut?

959
01:14:26,861 --> 01:14:28,678
Technically, Mariella has done.

960
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:32,452
Do not worry, we have
The rest kept for you.

961
01:14:33,076 --> 01:14:36,597
And if you want you can still contribute.
While still in fashion.

962
01:14:38,934 --> 01:14:41,692
I think the only one zoom
Little to be explained.

963
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:49,253
You do not have to contribute.

964
01:14:49,796 --> 01:14:52,252
It may be you do not care. You give
To no one but yourself.

965
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:55,404
There were all excuses because mum died
When you was little, but enough is enough.

966
01:14:56,261 --> 01:14:57,821
I have no idea what you are talking about it.

967
01:14:58,237 --> 01:14:59,668
I can no longer out last what
You have just done.

968
01:15:00,021 --> 01:15:02,026
But I can not hurt George you get things done,
He thinks he knows the truth about you ...

969
01:15:02,405 --> 01:15:04,211
But the only thing he knows,
The lies that you have told him.

970
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:06,740
You have a secret even Pedro
For George to keep.

971
01:15:07,268 --> 01:15:08,852
You tell him the truth now.

972
01:15:09,252 --> 01:15:11,642
He is not one of your 'euro
Nonsense friends' Tess, he's a good man ...

973
01:15:12,173 --> 01:15:14,690
And you can not begin relationship, which
Based on lies.

974
01:15:15,404 --> 01:15:18,827
Really Jane? And you know that, because you
So many have had successful relationships?

975
01:15:20,603 --> 01:15:22,403
You tell him the truth, or
I will do so.

976
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:27,132
No, you do not, you do not fly evil.
And certainly not me, I am your sister.

977
01:15:27,772 --> 01:15:30,924
That was yesterday. Today you just
Trut one who has broken my heart ...

978
01:15:31,284 --> 01:15:33,138
And my mother's wedding dress in pieces
Cut.

979
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,346
It would indeed you still
Inappropriate.

980
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:58,651
Jane, you look good.
Fine for you.

981
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:01,314
Treasury, it must be so difficult to
See ...

982
01:16:01,684 --> 01:16:03,620
That your younger sister earlier
Then you get married.

983
01:16:04,146 --> 01:16:05,874
Yes, that's it.

984
01:16:06,465 --> 01:16:08,418
But then I remind myself,
I can get hot sex ...

985
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:11,267
Random people I encounter, and
Then I feel so much better.

986
01:16:11,872 --> 01:16:13,570
Have fun at the party.

987
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:19,163
You look good, even I
Would you may fall.

988
01:16:20,195 --> 01:16:22,211
It is on top of the table, "Tess and George."

989
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:24,536
Is all well with you?
-- Yes.

990
01:16:26,657 --> 01:16:28,082
This is not water.

991
01:16:36,314 --> 01:16:38,851
Jane, thank you all done
Have. It's great.

992
01:16:40,376 --> 01:16:42,074
Look, if you like this one, Tess?

993
01:16:42,483 --> 01:16:45,451
No, I do not eat that stuff, Jane.

994
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,994
Precisely, I get the picture.

995
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,297
We will change the slideshow.

996
01:17:02,954 --> 01:17:05,026
You will still only say what
I have written down, right?

997
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:08,618
Sure. The perfect bruidsmeisje
Always does what its demands.

998
01:17:17,889 --> 01:17:19,626
You are not afraid, do you?

999
01:17:25,313 --> 01:17:26,226
Hello, everyone.

1000
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:28,979
In case you have not
Have read,

1001
01:17:29,337 --> 01:17:31,520
I have my share of weddings
However.

1002
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:38,203
So to begin, I think you all
Need to know the truth about Tess and George.

1003
01:17:46,385 --> 01:17:50,382
Tess and George are a perfect pair.
No, a superior pair.

1004
01:17:51,194 --> 01:17:53,321
A couple whose love
The elements of a fairy tale.

1005
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,832
They would fit together exactly,
It only can be described ...

1006
01:17:57,382 --> 01:17:59,706
As designed by the gods.

1007
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,753
Since a picture says more than
Thousand words ...

1008
01:18:03,495 --> 01:18:05,776
I have a slide show composed, so
You can see it all themselves.

1009
01:18:10,295 --> 01:18:13,526
From the very beginning, were Tess and George
Destined for each other.

1010
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:22,457
George and Tess have always love
Shared for God's furry creatures.

1011
01:18:26,967 --> 01:18:29,584
When she grew up, she showed the same
Level of dedication and conviction ...

1012
01:18:30,175 --> 01:18:32,150
For their training.

1013
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:40,335
And the same responsibility.

1014
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:47,904
He was interested
In international affairs ...

1015
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:52,303
And that she was, too.

1016
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:57,928
And today share Tess and George
Still the same values.

1017
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:07,542
Their love is based on a great concept
And acceptance ...

1018
01:19:08,262 --> 01:19:10,758
About who that other person
Really is.

1019
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:25,894
The love of two zielsverwanten true,
Tess and George.

1020
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:35,701
So at the perfect couple,
Together by fate.

1021
01:19:36,406 --> 01:19:38,726
I am so proud of you, little sister.

1022
01:19:39,902 --> 01:19:43,085
Well, that was then ...

1023
01:19:48,237 --> 01:19:50,012
For the cheerfulness is to keep ...

1024
01:19:50,581 --> 01:19:54,061
George wants his little brother Pedro,
Even a few words.

1025
01:19:57,677 --> 01:19:59,917
So, you may say,
That you are not a vegetarian.

1026
01:20:00,566 --> 01:20:02,924
Firstly, it is a very long time
Ago.

1027
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,861
Where you actually wore
When your engagement?

1028
01:20:07,598 --> 01:20:09,404
As you all know,
George is my big brother.

1029
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,484
But he is more than that.

1030
01:20:12,302 --> 01:20:13,764
He is my best friend.

1031
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:16,070
And now, George, Tess.

1032
01:20:16,422 --> 01:20:18,277
It's really very cool,

1033
01:20:18,804 --> 01:20:21,852
Because they are my own cleaning business
Helps set up.

1034
01:20:23,412 --> 01:20:25,502
Tess told me that you should not
Tell George, but ...

1035
01:20:25,934 --> 01:20:29,293
I am so excited, I am now
George at his home, but ...

1036
01:20:30,094 --> 01:20:32,477
But anyone who likes something good
Cleaned wants ...

1037
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:35,363
Come to me in the hall.

1038
01:20:35,891 --> 01:20:37,829
Thank you!

1039
01:20:37,892 --> 01:20:39,376
That's great.

1040
01:20:40,011 --> 01:20:41,394
No, it is ...

1041
01:20:43,721 --> 01:20:45,402
George, wait please.

1042
01:20:46,024 --> 01:20:47,392
Let me explain.

1043
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,209
What happened?

1044
01:20:51,688 --> 01:20:53,049
He had to know the truth.

1045
01:20:53,794 --> 01:20:55,675
You had him right
In his face can say.

1046
01:20:56,105 --> 01:20:59,294
I know that my moral compass nor
Points to the north, but ...

1047
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:03,456
If I say that something is not good,
It is not something good.

1048
01:21:05,665 --> 01:21:08,064
You are the one who always says that
I propose myself to be.

1049
01:21:08,616 --> 01:21:10,281
Yes, but that's not what you
Already.

1050
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:14,401
What you did was twenty years of suppressed
Feelings in an evening Release.

1051
01:21:14,728 --> 01:21:16,465
It was entertaining, understand me
Not wrong.

1052
01:21:17,113 --> 01:21:19,344
If that was the right thing to do, then
Now would you feel better.

1053
01:21:20,849 --> 01:21:22,385
Feel you can now better?

1054
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:28,193
The wedding is not, I hope
That you are happy.

1055
01:21:58,385 --> 01:22:00,529
What? Why are you here?

1056
01:22:01,352 --> 01:22:03,009
You have not answered my phone calls.
-- What do you want?

1057
01:22:03,496 --> 01:22:05,303
Do you have a different picture in your newspaper?

1058
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:08,464
Jane, please forgive me.
-- You have used me ...

1059
01:22:08,848 --> 01:22:11,136
To continue with your career,
Be a man and admit it ...

1060
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:15,200
Or do not. But please do
Not if you are an order Thursday.

1061
01:22:15,768 --> 01:22:17,878
Please let me explain.
-- No, it does not matter.

1062
01:22:18,543 --> 01:22:21,318
I have just destroyed my life. And I
Had there not with your help.

1063
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:24,615
Great, finally.

1064
01:22:25,223 --> 01:22:27,231
I saw what you did,
And it was amazing.

1065
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:30,518
It was certainly not absolutely correct,
But you have done something, Jane.

1066
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:33,878
For the first time, you not
The perfect bruidsmeisje.

1067
01:22:34,397 --> 01:22:38,527
I no longer start here with you. I know
Not even why I talk to you.

1068
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:40,855
Listen to me.

1069
01:22:42,103 --> 01:22:44,096
Do you know the real reason why I
I come here tonight?

1070
01:22:44,704 --> 01:22:46,506
Because I knew that this is difficult
For you would be.

1071
01:22:46,873 --> 01:22:49,352
And for the first time in a very long
I wanted time for someone.

1072
01:22:51,536 --> 01:22:53,847
I am ruined, and that I am sorry ...

1073
01:22:54,201 --> 01:22:56,624
And I turn to me, and walk away.
I disappear, and you will see me no more.

1074
01:22:57,144 --> 01:22:59,761
I promise, but I want you know ...

1075
01:23:00,369 --> 01:23:04,608
That you earn more, than anywhere
You now satisfied with.

1076
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,815
I think you deserve that other methods
The change you care to imagine.

1077
01:23:10,383 --> 01:23:11,377
That, I believe.

1078
01:23:23,872 --> 01:23:25,288
I forgot to give you this.

1079
01:23:27,632 --> 01:23:32,094
It is a gift, so you no longer
That crazy agenda from 1978 to having to drag.

1080
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:35,814
This will provide for all the things
You should do ...

1081
01:23:37,896 --> 01:23:39,480
Perfect for starting over.

1082
01:23:45,894 --> 01:23:48,389
Would you please adopt, so
I do not feel as a dick?

1083
01:24:38,358 --> 01:24:40,126
The story has superb reactions
.

1084
01:24:41,828 --> 01:24:43,942
It seems as if you yourself from the commitments'
Have worked.

1085
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,612
That's great.

1086
01:24:48,157 --> 01:24:51,581
Kevin, be happy now, you have
Got what you wanted, right?

1087
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:08,862
I am saying only that you two sisters,
You need that uitpraten.

1088
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,227
That, I know, but I say you do,
That she does not want to talk.

1089
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,998
No, she loves you.
Everything will be good.

1090
01:25:14,429 --> 01:25:16,244
You must ...
-- Papa?

1091
01:25:20,731 --> 01:25:24,347
What does it damn here?
-- Tess, this is between you and her ...

1092
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,205
I am here.

1093
01:25:27,412 --> 01:25:29,331
Have you seen that new herbicide?

1094
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:38,901
I feel terrible.

1095
01:25:41,205 --> 01:25:43,318
I am sorry if what happened.
-- Spijt?

1096
01:25:43,963 --> 01:25:46,826
You humiliated me for everyone
I know ...

1097
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:49,371
And you think you just 'I am sorry'
Can say?

1098
01:25:49,707 --> 01:25:51,970
I know.
-- You were always jealous of me.

1099
01:25:52,475 --> 01:25:54,100
What?
-- Always. On my clothes ...

1100
01:25:54,684 --> 01:25:56,501
On my friends.
-- Keep it there.

1101
01:25:56,869 --> 01:25:59,299
You have just waited on the opportunity,
On me to get down.

1102
01:25:59,725 --> 01:26:02,504
That's it. And you have the only
In my life taken away ...

1103
01:26:02,873 --> 01:26:05,044
That finally came.
-- Please Tess, which is so typical ...

1104
01:26:05,473 --> 01:26:08,305
You take no responsibility
That you have lied against George.

1105
01:26:08,777 --> 01:26:10,658
You have manipulated him.
What do you with the muggenspray?

1106
01:26:14,065 --> 01:26:16,315
Hield you from him, or he
You only useful?

1107
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,353
Please Jane, not just talk
Pretending you know everything better.

1108
01:26:21,761 --> 01:26:24,267
Provides but now that I tegensta you,
Because you always had to do my hair ...

1109
01:26:24,723 --> 01:26:25,702
Halloween and my clothes had to make ...

1110
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:27,634
And my dress for the eindfeest from school
Had to buy.

1111
01:26:27,922 --> 01:26:30,267
No, it has not been all me.
-- Yes, that is true.

1112
01:26:30,698 --> 01:26:32,596
You always thought that my life
So easy.

1113
01:26:32,923 --> 01:26:34,307
That was the case, it is.

1114
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:39,168
You have never had a concern, you are beautiful,
And fun and charming. Your life is perfect.

1115
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,163
Perfect, are you crazy?

1116
01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:45,642
You have no idea. You want the real reason
Know why I wanted to stay in New York?

1117
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:47,769
I am fired.

1118
01:26:49,044 --> 01:26:50,899
And that was the height Rudolfo
Dumped me.

1119
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:52,922
He dumped me.

1120
01:26:53,801 --> 01:26:56,386
And then came George, and he
Was nice to me.

1121
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:58,586
He treated me good, you know?

1122
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:03,586
I just wanted someone,
He would like.

1123
01:27:04,176 --> 01:27:08,059
I tried to be someone he
Earned, someone he respected ...

1124
01:27:09,547 --> 01:27:11,947
I tried to yours.

1125
01:27:13,554 --> 01:27:14,626
Why?

1126
01:27:15,562 --> 01:27:19,570
Why would you want me, as
You yourself can be?

1127
01:27:22,163 --> 01:27:24,138
This is a mess.
-- I know it.

1128
01:27:25,922 --> 01:27:28,611
Jane, you did for me to try to ensure
Since deceased mother.

1129
01:27:29,121 --> 01:27:31,156
That I had to do.
-- No, it was not you.

1130
01:27:32,634 --> 01:27:34,745
But if I did not ...
-- If you did not ... 


1131
01:27:35,315 --> 01:27:38,026
You just had my sister.
And that is what it should be.

1132
01:27:39,217 --> 01:27:41,625
Perhaps when I was young,
You had to help me, but now ...

1133
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:45,466
Now you have to stop to provide me,
With ensuring everyone.

1134
01:28:39,643 --> 01:28:42,748
Yes, that's no problem.
Sure.

1135
01:28:43,253 --> 01:28:44,523
I am true.

1136
01:29:02,058 --> 01:29:03,649
You look great.

1137
01:29:05,677 --> 01:29:09,523
I think it is not me you are David
Liefdadigheidsvoorstelling have to search.

1138
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:11,124
I believe it.

1139
01:29:11,731 --> 01:29:14,428
George, before we go anywhere, let
I apologize for last night ...

1140
01:29:14,834 --> 01:29:16,080
I did not have to do
What I did.

1141
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:17,858
You did me a service.

1142
01:29:18,482 --> 01:29:21,019
It is not your fault that I went marry
With someone I hardly knew.

1143
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:23,459
What I thought really, right?

1144
01:29:25,747 --> 01:29:27,355
What do you think?
Shall we all just forget?

1145
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:30,234
If you know for sure.
-- I am sure.

1146
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:32,602
I do not turn to ask a favor,

1147
01:29:32,978 --> 01:29:34,698
But I have my speech
For printing tonight ...

1148
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,817
And I can not find the file.
-- I grab it.

1149
01:29:38,793 --> 01:29:41,586
Jane, I am so grateful to you that I
Tonight could call.

1150
01:29:42,969 --> 01:29:44,928
I can always count on you, you
Never say no.

1151
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:47,251
Against the love.

1152
01:29:49,771 --> 01:29:50,666
What?

1153
01:29:51,505 --> 01:29:52,834
I referred only ...

1154
01:29:55,043 --> 01:29:56,408
Sorry, I said something wrong?

1155
01:30:01,865 --> 01:30:04,224
George, I assume dismissal.

1156
01:30:06,761 --> 01:30:08,928
I assume dismissal.
-- What do you mean? I take resign?

1157
01:30:09,344 --> 01:30:12,507
When I came from school, I was
Under the impression of this case, and you ...

1158
01:30:12,876 --> 01:30:15,392
I was so busy with the matter, which I
I do not pressure made my own life ...

1159
01:30:15,848 --> 01:30:17,634
I think if I felt on my convenience,
That I do not think it was necessary to leave.

1160
01:30:18,184 --> 01:30:20,625
And then I had to see you here every day,
As terrible as I was in love with you.

1161
01:30:25,096 --> 01:30:27,578
Verschrikkelijk love, idiot.

1162
01:30:30,465 --> 01:30:31,841
It will go well with you, George.

1163
01:30:32,362 --> 01:30:34,080
You get someone for this job, which ...

1164
01:30:34,626 --> 01:30:37,585
Ultimately up to two years continues,
Because that is acceptable and suitable ...

1165
01:30:49,687 --> 01:30:52,544
I am sorry, that was quite
Suddenly ...

1166
01:30:53,103 --> 01:30:56,434
No, it's good. I always like
Know how that would feel.

1167
01:30:58,536 --> 01:30:59,457
And?

1168
01:31:01,034 --> 01:31:02,751
Nothing. I felt nothing.

1169
01:31:04,161 --> 01:31:05,335
That hurts.

1170
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:08,064
Maybe we can still
Try once?

1171
01:31:16,121 --> 01:31:17,990
No, nothing. And you?

1172
01:31:18,633 --> 01:31:19,985
If I am honest?

1173
01:31:20,727 --> 01:31:23,368
Not really.
-- It does not feel like it should feel.

1174
01:31:24,903 --> 01:31:26,814
If the person is where you
Belongs, it would be ...

1175
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:29,904
What's that?

1176
01:31:36,759 --> 01:31:37,791
I must go.

1177
01:31:42,898 --> 01:31:44,888
Today you can
All kinds of problems ...

1178
01:31:45,318 --> 01:31:46,974
Because if we do as four in a row ...

1179
01:31:49,966 --> 01:31:53,400
Sorry, do you know of Malcolm Doyle there?

1180
01:31:54,103 --> 01:31:56,038
He is married to his last beating.

1181
01:31:56,638 --> 01:31:58,830
You are that girl from that article,
You are famous.

1182
01:32:10,605 --> 01:32:11,590
Pier 17.

1183
01:32:16,334 --> 01:32:18,500
Did you ...
-- I have only one dress tonight. So it Ga.

1184
01:32:18,911 --> 01:32:20,572
Come on.
-- Go.

1185
01:32:29,637 --> 01:32:30,605
Success.

1186
01:32:32,428 --> 01:32:33,790
Where's the wedding?
-- Here inside.

1187
01:32:38,189 --> 01:32:39,894
This is a good, I got it.
Thanks a lot.

1188
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:10,598
Is all well with you?
-- Everything is fine with me.

1189
01:33:12,077 --> 01:33:13,876
Everything is fine.

1190
01:33:25,805 --> 01:33:27,140
No, you are that girl from that article.

1191
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:28,875
What are you doing here?

1192
01:33:32,452 --> 01:33:33,859
A long story in a few words.

1193
01:33:34,539 --> 01:33:35,637
There is this man ...

1194
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:38,020
Tell me more.

1195
01:33:48,598 --> 01:33:49,700
Since he is.

1196
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:57,059
You can, say it.

1197
01:33:59,963 --> 01:34:01,866
I just wanted to say that you are right
Had on me.

1198
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,164
Over all, I just wanted to
Not heard.

1199
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:05,947
Certainly not you.

1200
01:34:09,755 --> 01:34:11,180
Can the spotlight?

1201
01:34:14,516 --> 01:34:15,490
There you are.

1202
01:34:18,738 --> 01:34:21,059
Kevin, I have my whole life on
Waiting for the right man ...

1203
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:23,210
And when you came up, and ...

1204
01:34:23,914 --> 01:34:26,546
You are not like me
This man had, you are ...

1205
01:34:26,938 --> 01:34:29,388
Cynical and curious, and ...

1206
01:34:30,042 --> 01:34:31,548
Impossible.

1207
01:34:32,298 --> 01:34:33,859
But the truth is,
That you are fighting ...

1208
01:34:34,714 --> 01:34:36,595
Is the best that I ever
Overcome.

1209
01:34:37,385 --> 01:34:40,188
And I think there is a good chance,
I love your word.

1210
01:34:46,921 --> 01:34:50,161
That's it. That is all
I wanted to say.

1211
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:52,842
I Go.

1212
01:35:05,266 --> 01:35:06,161
Kevin, I wanted ...

1213
01:35:11,786 --> 01:35:12,922
Come here.

1214
01:35:47,136 --> 01:35:49,400
One year later

1215
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:56,106
Tell me again, why is
This wedding special.

1216
01:35:56,688 --> 01:35:57,729
Who are you?

1217
01:35:58,096 --> 01:35:59,571
I am writing the commitment section
'The Journal'.

1218
01:36:00,179 --> 01:36:02,186
Perhaps we can soon
Something to drink?

1219
01:36:02,618 --> 01:36:04,611
Bring it to the bar,
You get something from me to drink.

1220
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:12,361
There is Tess.

1221
01:36:13,057 --> 01:36:15,073
Do you think they would fall on me.
I am now a year older.

1222
01:36:16,305 --> 01:36:18,322
I do not know, I do it
A good word for you, big boy.

1223
01:36:24,706 --> 01:36:26,130
I bruidsmeisje.

1224
01:36:29,259 --> 01:36:30,844
I live in Bloomsburg,
With a roommate ...

1225
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:34,610
And I have just begun designing
My own great handbags.

1226
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,497
And I sit entirely on the ground,
But that's not very ...

1227
01:36:38,273 --> 01:36:42,122
I eat a hamburger a day, and my
Idea of a pet is a stone.

1228
01:36:45,019 --> 01:36:46,114
It is very nice to meet you too.

1229
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:51,851
Wacht maar tot jij de bruid ziet.
She looks beautiful.

1230
01:36:56,673 --> 01:36:57,418
Are you ready?

1231
01:36:59,017 --> 01:36:59,993
Everything is perfect.

1232
01:37:00,434 --> 01:37:03,161
The best with this dress, that you
Shorter can create and then can bear.

1233
01:37:03,634 --> 01:37:04,903
That is absolutely true.

1234
01:37:11,802 --> 01:37:13,090
Are you ready?

1235
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,076
<i> That day I woke up and I went
My twenty-eighth dress. </ I>

1236
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:45,638
<i> I went to a wedding where no one
Asked me for the bouquet to hold. </ I>

1237
01:37:46,176 --> 01:37:49,376
<i> Or to the tafelkaartje to expand, or their dress
Keep up if they were puddles. </ I>

1238
01:37:50,056 --> 01:37:52,674
<i> Everything was perfect, and it might
I do not care. </ I>

1239
01:37:53,961 --> 01:37:55,505
<i> Because there, the only thing made from something ...</ i>

1240
01:37:56,273 --> 01:37:58,847
<i> Was the one on me at the waiting
, At the end of the aisle </ i>.

1241
01:38:00,256 --> 01:38:02,282
<i> And he looked at me as I always
Had hoped. </ I>

1242
01:38:18,246 --> 01:38:19,728
Is it time now where everything
You had hoped?

1243
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:22,342
No.

1244
01:38:24,671 --> 01:38:26,936
It is more, it's much more.

1245
01:38:30,041 --> 01:38:31,673
Beloved present, we
Are here today together ...

1246
01:38:32,103 --> 01:38:35,183
To behold and that Jane Nickols
Kevin Doyle in the marriage act.

1247
01:38:41,278 --> 01:38:42,672
<i> It turned out that I was right about one thing ...</ i>

1248
01:38:44,878 --> 01:38:46,848
<i> I knew it all in one day
I would be </ i>.

1249
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:11,710
Then I declare you now man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

1250
01:39:22,941 --> 01:39:25,230
<i> Everything ... And more </ i>
