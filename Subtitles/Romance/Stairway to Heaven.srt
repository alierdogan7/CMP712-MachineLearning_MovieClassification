<i>This is the universe.</i>

2
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,916
<i>Big, isn't it?</i>

3
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,918
<i>Thousands of suns, millions of stars,...</i>

4
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,435
<i>...separated by immense distances
and by thin floating clouds of gas.</i>

5
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,718
<i>The starlight makes the gas transparent.</i>

6
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,476
<i>Where there are no stars
it appears as dark, obscuring clouds...</i>

7
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,280
<i>...like that great black cone over there.</i>

8
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,598
<i>Hello,...</i>

9
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,636
<i>...there's a nova.</i>

10
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,676
<i>A whole solar system exploded.</i>

11
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,949
<i>Someone must've been messing about
with the uranium atom.</i>

12
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,396
<i>No, it's not our solar system,
I'm glad to say.</i>

13
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,392
<i>Ah, those are called
a globular cluster of stars.</i>

14
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,832
<i>Rather fine.</i>

15
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,348
<i>Down here in the right-hand corner,...</i>

16
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,910
<i>...see that little chap
rather like a boy scout's badge?</i>

17
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,073
<i>It's a mass of gas expanding
at thousands of cubic miles a minute.</i>

18
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
<i>Ah, here we are,
we're getting nearer home.</i>

19
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,036
<i>The moon, our moon,...</i>

20
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,076
<i>...in the first quarter,...</i>

21

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,756
<i>...moving around in its place,...</i>

23
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,196
<i>...part of the pattern, part of the universe.</i>

24
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,036
<i>Reassuring, isn't it?</i>

25
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,589
<i>- (thunder)
- It's night over Europe.</i>

26
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,069
<i>The night of the 2nd May, 1945.</i>

27
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,390
<i>That point of fire is a burning city.</i>

28
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,119
<i>It had a thousand-bomber raid
an hour ago.</i>

29

<i>(explosions)</i>

30
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,199

<i>I hope all our aircraft got home safely.</i>

33
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,429
<i>- Even the big ships sound frightened.
- (Morse code signals)</i>

34
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,398
<i>Listen to all the noises in the air.</i>

Cannot read you.

Request your position.
Can you see our signals?

46
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,992
"Give me my scallop-shell of quiet,
My staff of faith to walk upon,...

Hello, Lancaster. We are sending signals.
Can you see our signals?

53
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,838
Come in, Lancaster. Come in, Lancaster.

54
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,397
But at my back I always hear
Time's wingèd chariot hurrying near.

55
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,155
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity.

56
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,198
Andy Marvell. What a marvel!
What's your name?

57
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,511
Are you receiving me?
Repeat, are you receiving me?

58
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,353
Request your position.
Come in, Lancaster.

59
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,149
I can't give you my position.
Instruments gone, crew gone.

60
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,390
Except Bob, my sparks. He's dead.

61
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,870
The rest bailed out on my orders.
Time 03.35. Get that?

62
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,518
Crew bailed out 03.35

"Station - Warrenden.
Bomber Group - A, G."

64
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,870
Station - Warrenden.
Bomber Group - A, Apple, G, George.

65
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,030
They'll be sorry about Bob.
We liked him.

66
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,591
Hello, G, George. Hello, G, George.
Are you all right?

67
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,478
Are you going to try to land?
Do you want a fix?

68
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,553
Name's not G, George, it's P, Peter.
Peter D Carter. D's for David.

69
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,838
Squadron Leader Peter Carter.
Can't land - undercarriage is gone.

70
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,990
I'm bailing out, I'm bailing out.

71
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,231
- "Take a telegram".
- Received your message.

72
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,073
- We can hear you.
- "Telegram to my mother".

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,755
"Mrs Michael Carter,
88 Hampstead Lane, London Northwest".

74
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,796
88 Hampstead Lane, London.

75
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,516
Tell her that I love her.

76
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,832
You'll have to write this, but I want her
to know I love her very much.

77
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,559
I've never shown it to her, not really,...

78
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,598
...but I've loved her always
right up to the end.

79
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,229
"Give my love to my two sisters, too.
Don't forget them".

80
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,548
Received your message.
We can hear you.

81
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,599
Are you wounded? Repeat, are you
wounded? Are you bailing out?

82
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,591
- What's your name?
- June.

83
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,276
Yes, I'm bailing out, but there's a catch.
I've got no parachute.

84
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,750
H- Hello? Hello, Peter, do not understand.

85
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,629
Hello? Hello, Peter, can you hear me?

86
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,951
"Hello, June, don't be afraid.
It's quite simple".

87
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,600
We've had it and I'd rather jump than fry.

88
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,559
After the first thousand feet
I shan't know anything, anyway.

89
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,200
"I say, I hope I haven't frightened you".

90
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,800
- No, I'm not frightened.
- "Good girl!"

91
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,350
Your sparks, you said he was dead.
Hasn't he got a chute?

92
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,318
Cut to ribbons. Cannon shell.
Are you pretty?

93
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,958
Not bad.

94
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,554
- "Can you hear me well?"
- Yes.

95
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,872
You've got guts. I've known dozens
of girls, been in love with some.

96
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,669
But an American girl I've never seen
and never shall see...

97
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,115
...will hear my last words.

98
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,713
"Rather sweet".

99
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,758
June, if you're around
when they pick me up,...

100
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,478
...turn your head away.

101
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,394
But perhaps we can do something, Peter.
Let me report it.

102
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,189
"No, no-one can help. Only you.
Let me do this in my own way".

103
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,352
"I want to be alone with you.
Where were you born?"

104
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,237
- Boston.
- "Mass?"

105
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,275
Yes.

106
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,433
History was made there. Are you in love
with anybody? No, don't answer.

107
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,636
I could love a man like you, Peter.

108
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,315
<i>I love you, June, you're life.
Do you live on the station?</i>

109
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,790
No, in a big house five miles from here.
Lee Wood House.

110
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,791
- "Old house?"
- Yes, very old.

111
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,668
I'll come and see you as a ghost!
You're not frightened of ghosts?

112
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,512
I'm not frightened.

113
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,637
- "What time will you be home?"
- I'm on duty till 6.

114
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,395
I have breakfast in the mess,
then I have to cycle half an hour.

115
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,436
I often go along the sands.

116
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,476
This is such nonsense!

117
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,597
It's the best sense I ever heard.
I was lucky to get you.

118
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,036
Can't be helped about the parachute.
I'll have wings soon.

119
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,669
Hope they haven't gone modern.
I'd hate to have a prop instead!

120
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,638
- "What's the next world like?"
- Oh, Peter!

121
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,598
"I think it starts
where this one leaves off".

122
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,559
<i>Or where it could if we listened
to Plato, Aristotle and Jesus.</i>

123
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,316
With all our earthly problems solved
but with greater ones worth solving.

124
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,631
I'm signing off now, June.
Goodbye. Goodbye, June.

125
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,234
Hello, G for George. Hello, G, George!

126
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,276
Hello, G, George!

127
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,828
<i>- Hel...

129
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,118
So long, Bob, I'll see you in a minute.

130
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,879
You know what we wear by now -
prop or wings.

131
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,038
<i>(Ghostly voice) A prop... or wings.</i>

132
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,229

<i>(continues in French)</i>

144
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,075

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,036
<i>(# mouth organ... mournful tune)</i>

146
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,876
<i>(# mournful tune plays on)</i>

147
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,236
Name and rank.

148
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,188
<i>(American accent) Come on, fellas,
break it up, spread out.</i>

149
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,952
Room with bath.

150
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,679
- Do you have USO shows here?
- No, we don't.

151
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,275
OK, we'll stay.
Officers' quarters, of course.

152
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,195
- We're all the same here, Captain.
- Excuse me,... brother.

153
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,076
Take over.

154
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,551
- I wish I could make a phone call.
- From here that'd be long distance.

155
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,596
Flying Officer Trubshaw.

156
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,559
You can't wait here. You must be
mistaken about your captain.

157
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,792
- If anyone's mistaken, it's not me.
- Mistakes don't happen here.

158
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,872
<i>- This is the Aircrew Section?
- You should know.</i>

159
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,520
Peter couldn't have got away with it.

160
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,200
Besides, you checked his invoice for me.

161
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,748
Yes, it was against the regulations.

162
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,958
Regulations are made to be broken.
He was due half an hour after me.

163
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,600
This is his section. He hasn't reported.

164
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
He's either AWOL
or there's been a mistake.

165
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,552
There hasn't been a mistake here
for 1,000 years.

166
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,074
<i>Oh? So there have been mistakes?</i>

167
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,799
The girl here before me
was here 640 years.

168
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,438
Holy smoke!

169
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,877
If the records don't balance,
alarm bells ring in the Records Office.

170
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,315
I bet they do. Proper flap, eh?

171
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,753
Yes.

172
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,791
That's only the living records.

173
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,836
Everyone on Earth has a file.

174
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,708
Russian, Chinese, black or white,
Republican or Democrat.

175
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,271
Holy smoke! If anyone had said clerks
worked up here just like on Earth...

176
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,749
Everyone here can start how they like.

177
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,912
Heaven, isn't it?

178
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,392
You see?

179
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,270
There are millions of people on Earth
who'd think it heaven to be a clerk.

180
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,316
And don't say "Holy smoke".

181
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,915
- Why not?
- There's no smoke without fire...

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,356
<i>...and we don't call smoke... holy.</i>

183
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,320
Thanks for the gen,... Section Officer.

184
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,960
Boy, oh, boy, home was nothin' like this!

185
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,438
Mine was.

186
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,278
Sign here.

187
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,750
All right, I don't want to start
those bells ringing!

188
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,796
<i>(bells ring)</i>

189
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,436
I wonder where I report.

190
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,796
<i>(dog howls)</i>

191
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,189
Oh, I always hoped there would be dogs.

192
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,196
<i>(# plaintive flute music )</i>

193
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,356
<i>(# gentle, wistful tune)</i>

194
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,916
<i>(dog barks)</i>

195
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,116
Good morning.

196
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,758
Morning.

197
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,796
Where do I go from here?

198
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,709
- Huh?!
- I'm new, I only just arrived.

199
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,031
- Where do I report?
- You mean the aerodrome?

200
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,076
Aerodrome?

201
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,192
Where am I? This place, what's it called?

202
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,236
- The Burrows.
- Where?

203
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,276
- Lee Wood.
- Lee Wood?

204
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,510
- Yeah.
- Do you know Lee Wood House?

205
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,149
That's it - where the smoke is,
behind those trees.

206
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,074
- Is that the quickest way?
- There's a track. See that bike?

207
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,636
- Who is it?
- Dunno. One of the Yank girls.

208
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,676
They live up at the house.

209
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,840
<i>Here, Jock! (whistles)</i>

210
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,478
Hi!

211
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,358
Hello.

212
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,795
Hello yourself. What's wrong?

213
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,992
You're June.

214
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,992
You're Peter!

215
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,876
How did you get here?

216
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,919
I'm glad you're safe.
What did you do? What happened?

217
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,070
- I just don't know.
- Are you hurt?

218
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,878
My head feels a bit queer.

219
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,270
There's a little cut in your hair.
It's nothing much.

220
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,196
Oh, Peter, it was a cruel joke.

221
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,236
<i>If it was, it was on me.</i>

222
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,118
I've been crying
ever since we said goodbye.

223
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,556
- Don't cry, darling.
- Oh, Peter, darling.

224
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,078
<i>(Recorder) 91,716 invoiced.</i>

225
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,997
91,715 checked in.

226
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,117
- Conductor 71.
- It could've 'appened to anybody.

227
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,758
How did it happen?

228
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,150
Everything was calculated
but for the accursed fog!

229
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,550
The pilot jumped,
he got lost in the fog, I missed him.

230
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,072
Flying Officer Trubshaw.

231
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,199
You've been waiting all day for your pilot.

232
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,795
Yes, ma'am. Over the Channel,
there was a ruddy peasouper!

233
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,915
Ah-ha!

234
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,991
Oh, excuse the language, ma'am.

235
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,789
It was so thick, you could've stepped
out of the kite and walked on it!

236
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,792
- Sacré brouillard!
- And he, the skipper,...

237
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,872
...ordered everybody
to bail out over the coast.

238
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,032
He knew his brolly... chute...
had been written off.

239
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,111
It was hit as he was bandaging me.

240
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,156
But he didn't tell the others.

241
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,800
I only knew because I'd bought it by then.

242
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,314
I mean, I was... dead.

243
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,031
I understand.

244
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,076
I knew he'd be clocking in here.

245
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,233
I thought I'd stooge around and
wait for him. Er, this young lady...

246
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,276
...is not to blame at all.

247
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,436
- I'm sorry if I broke the rules.
- Thank you.

248
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,873
19 hours and 50 minutes have elapsed.

249
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,669
Don't you know that any slip
must be reported immediately?

250
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,513
- I lost my head.
- Not long in the service.

251
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,478
I joined in the so-called
Second Germinal...

252
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,711
...of the so-called
glorious French Revolution.

253
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,756
I see. Natural death.

254
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,836
I lost my head.

255
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,916
The case is not so simple.

256
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,752
- Non?
- No.

257
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,796
He's fallen in love.

258
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,313
Ahhhh!

259
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,594
Oh.

260
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,716
- It complicates things.
- True.

261
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,109
- You must do your best.
- Oui, madame.

262
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,589
- Proceed to Earth immediately.
- Oui.

263
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,558
You'll explain your grave error to Carter...

264
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,359
- ...and ask him to follow you.
- Oui, madame.

265
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,475
Wait!

266
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,552
Your captain is not
an unreasonable man, I hope.

267
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,269
The skipper? Oh, no, ma'am...
unless he's had a few!

268
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,590
Er... pardon? 'Ad a few?

269
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,478
- Beers.
- Oh, la bière!

270
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,518
Scotch being hard to come by, you know.

271
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,511
- Naturellement!
- By the way,...

272
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,636
...would you give Peter a message for me?

273
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,233
Avec plaisir.

274
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,276
Just say, "What ho".

275
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,509
Bon.

276
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,272
One is starved for Technicolor up there.

277
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
What a night for love!

278
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,392
Drink, darling?

279
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,118
Mon ami.

280
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,078
Evening.

281
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,680
I think I keep this for a little.

282
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,955
<i>And how are you, my friend?</i>

283
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,996
Never been better.

284
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,435
- June, wake...
- She cannot wake.

285
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,069
We are talking in space, not in time.

286
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,474
- Are you cracked?
- Look at your watch.

287
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,433
It has not moved since you said
so charmingly "Drink, darling?"

288
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,476
Nor will it move,...

289
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,711
<i>...nor will anything move...</i>

290
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,758
...until we have finished our little talk.

291
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,796
It is only a trick.

292
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,438
Who are you?

293
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,478
We should've met yesterday
at 04.10, mon cher.

294
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,916
Unfortunately I missed you.

295
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,389
You couldn't have because I wasn't here.

296
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,756
I bring you a message from Mr Trubshaw.

297
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,033
Bob?

298
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,554
- Bob's dead.
- Oh, yes, he's dead.

299
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,356
He says... "What ho!"

300
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,671
<i>That sounds like Trubshaw.
But he is dead, isn't he?</i>

301
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,832
- En effet. But how? Why?
- Cannon shell.

302
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,990
And what should happen to a man...

303
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,675
...who jumps from his aircraft
without his parachute?

304
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,318
<i>How do you know?</i>

305
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,994
<i>But it is I who am telling you, my friend.</i>

306
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,638
It is I!

307
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,676
Your time was up,...

308
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,719
...but I missed you because of your
ridiculous English climate.

309
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,358
I am French.

310
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,439
- But what do you want now?
- You, my friend.

311
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,476
- What for?
- To conduct you.

312
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,869
- Where to?
- To the training centre.

313
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,520
- Training for what?
- For another world.

314
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,156
You don't mean...?

315
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,518
But, my dear friend,
that is just what I do mean.

316
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,353
Oh, this is absolutely fantastic!

317
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,874
<i>- June!
- (conductor laughs)</i>

318
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,109
June!

319
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,750
All right, and what if I refuse to go?

320
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,991
But you cannot refuse. Your time was up.

321
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,789
Now, by mistake,
you overstayed by about,...

322
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,030
...speaking in time, of course,...

323
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,678
...20 hours.

324
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,390
The advantage was exclusively yours.
You lost nothing, you only gained.

325
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,232
What about her?

326
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,276
<i>(conductor chuckles)</i>

327
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,152
Exquise.

328
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,118
You will see her again
when her time comes.

329
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,150
She will live to be... ninety-seven.
I looked her up in the files.

330
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,755
- I'm in love with her.
- But, my friend, what is love?

331
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,796
The feeling of the moment,...

332
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,030
...but I represent eternity.

333
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,270
The law of this world and the other.

334
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,590
- Good, but what is law?
- Law is law.

335
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,910
- Law is based on reason.
- That is so.

336
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,390
Now, yesterday I wasn't in love.
Today I am.

337
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,233
But what is love?
How many people are in love?

338
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,629
Soldiers, airmen, how many sailors?

339
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,792
Do they protest when their time is up?
No, they don't.

340
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,519
<i>- They have no right, but I have.
- Why?</i>

341
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,592
<i>Look, I've fallen in love
because of your mistake.</i>

342
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,797
I'm in a different position
from what I was in last night.

343
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,836
I expected to die, I was ready to die.

344
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,354
It wasn't my fault I didn't, it was yours!

345
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,954
- What government do you represent?
- None!

346
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,758
What laws govern the place?

347
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,354
I cannot express any political views.

348
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,908
A respectable place
must have law of appeal.

349
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,798
<i>- Be reasonable! Appeal to whom?
- You find out.</i>

350
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,509
- It has never been done!
- Is that any reason why it can't be done?

351
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,512
You are determined
to get me into... the salad.

352
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,670
<i>What about the salad you got me into?</i>

353
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,275
Now, look here, you don't want me
to use force, do you?

354
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,316
Oh, well, you can always try.

355
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,031
- I think I leave you for a little.
- That's the form.

356
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,669
- I shall report for instructions.
- Now you're talking!

357
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,718
And... do not fall any deeper in love now.

358
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,756
You have been warned.

359
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,796
She is...

360
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,438
...charming.

361
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,909
You know, I think you're not a bad chap.

362
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,796
Do you play chess?

363
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,233
Yes.

364
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,878
So do I.

365
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,916
We could play every day.

366
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,996
Some other time.

367
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,316
Next time, perhaps?

368
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,876
Au revoir, mon ami.

369
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,636
No, thank you, darling.

370
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,995
"No, thank you" what?

371
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,431
You just asked me to have a drink.

372
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,398
Did I?

373
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,836
Yes, I remember I did.

374
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,359
- What's the matter with me?
- What is it? Is it your head again?

375
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,192
Might be, yes.

376
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,958
An odd thing happened
while you were asleep.

377
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,871
I haven't been asleep.

378
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,554
Didn't you hear us talking?

379
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,073
No.

380
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,116
Who was there to talk to?

381
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,556
- They sent somebody.
- They? Who are they?

382
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,796
I don't know.

383
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,476
June, do I look cracked?

384
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,950
Not to me, darling. Are you?

385
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,228
There was a ten-tenths' fog last night.

386
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,198
- That's right, isn't it?
- You know there was.

387
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,829
<i>- I did bail out without a parachute.
- That's your story.</i>

388
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,878
- So how can I be alive?
- I give up.

389
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,509
- I don't know and I don't care.
- My parachute was shot up.

390
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,990
When I came to, I had none.
Anyway, why wasn't I drowned?

391
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,640
No need to prove to me
you ought to be dead.

392
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,154
I ought to be according to this character.

393
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,710
This conductor they sent after me
said he missed me in the fog.

394
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,553
Bad luck for them, good luck for me.

395
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,712
I said I'd appeal.
He's gone to get instructions.

396
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,756
It's not my fault I'm not dead!

397
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,150
It's not my fault I found you
and fell in love with you.

398
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,316
Maybe he wasn't here at all!

399
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,356
Hey, you, Frenchman!

400
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,396
Where are you?!

401
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,798
- What is it?
- Ohh, I've got an awful headache.

402
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,838
June?

403
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,911
June, you're there, aren't you?

404
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,753
Yes, Peter, of course I'm here.

405
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,836
I... thought I'd lost you.

406
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,596
<i>(phone rings)</i>

407
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,676
Dr Reeves's residence.

408
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,716
Oh, good morning, Miss June.

409
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,952
Yes, isn't it? The doctor's up in his thing -
his camera obscura.

410
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,272
He's got his new lens from the shop
today. It makes a lovely picture.

411
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,591
He's taken the big white garden table
to project on.

412
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,514
He'll be glad you're coming over.
He's showing it to the dogs.

413
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,750
<i>(Dr Reeves) Ah, nice day.</i>

414
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,308
Hmm, Mrs Bedwell's ducks out too early.

415
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,198
She'll lose all the eggs if she's not careful.

416
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,353
Ahh, the start of the cycling season.
There's a hefty young girl.

417
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,989
Time Mrs Tucker went to get our rations.
There she is.

418
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,073
Ooh, the Vicar and his sister -
not coming here, I hope. No. Good.

419
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,869
Quite a queue at the butcher's.
Must have some offal.

420
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,318
Wonderful how the kids love playing
in the splash. The same in my day.

421
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,550
That tree ought to come down.

422
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,350
Old Mary looking quite skittish.

423
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,000
Sally Allgood getting herself dated up.

424
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,435
Ah, here's June, here she comes.

425
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,430
She walks in beauty like the night.

426
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,950
Only she's cycling and the sun is out.
Nice girl.

427
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,191
Worth a hatful of ambassadors
in Lee Wood, anyway.

428
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,676
Come on up!

429
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,478
Hello, Doc.

430
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,994
Hello, June. Come in, shut the door.

431
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,516
Surveying your kingdom?

432
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,160
A village doctor has to know everything.

433
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,949
You'd be surprised how many diagnoses
I've formed up here.

434
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,508
I love looking at the village from here.

435
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,556
Looks so different.

436
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,758
That's because you see it all clearly
and at once, as in a poet's eye.

437
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,273
I want to talk to you.

438
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,794
So you said, but it's none of my business.

439
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,189
Dr McEwen says it's right up your street.

440
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,875
This is my street, a village street.
I'm a village doctor.

441
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,916
Only because you like living here.

442
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,754
McEwen says what you don't know
about neurology would fill a peanut.

443
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,193
I'm a good guesser.

444
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,714
Your guesses are in famous magazines...

445
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,633
...like that "Brain" I've seen in your library.

446
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,188
<i>- Dr McEwen says...
- I know what he says.</i>

447
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,158
- I had a talk with him on the phone.
- Oh, did you?

448
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,196
After I'd talked to you.

449
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,512
This is the RAF's business.
Carter should rejoin his station today.

450
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,353
- I know.
- What's it got to do with you?

451
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,396
Oh, I'm just interested.

452
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,833
Oh, I see.

453
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,150
Strictly speaking, he's a RAF case.

454
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,152
He's not a case, he's a person,
a very fine person.

455
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,958
I want you to see him, Frank.

456
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,589
I don't want just anyone mauling him
and asking him questions.

457
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,148
I want you. I'm sure the RAF would say...

458
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,391
I know what they'd say.
I spoke to his CO this morning.

459
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,471
- Oh, Frank!
- And to his Group MO.

460
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,120
- Fortunately, he's heard of me.
- Frank!

461
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,431
If you'd done that earlier,
I'd have told you earlier.

462
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,672
You can't kidnap RAF officers
just cos you like the shape of their nose!

463
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,911
Not his nose, his voice.
I fell for that before I saw him.

464
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,355
He believes he jumped
with no parachute?

465
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,396
- Yes.
- He has hallucinations?

466
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,710
During these bouts, does he go pale?

467
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,678
- Yes, yes, he did.
- He has headaches... here?

468
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,751
I think so. You'd better ask him.

469
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,513
- But he definitely sees things?
- And hears.

470
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,592
All right. Did you tell him
he was talking rubbish?

471
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,033
- No.
- Quite right.

472
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,475
He's not. He's talking very logically.

473
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,516
<i>Then he can't be in love. Bye.</i>

474
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,598
- Frank...
- Yes?

475
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,636
He has a very cute nose, too!

476
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,029
- I'll be over about teatime.
- Right.

477
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,796
It's Dr Reeves. Let's go!

478
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,992
Yippeeeee!

479
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,988
- That's not how to spell Shakespeare.
- Who are you, his agent?

<i>(Prompter) Do no wrong.</i>

484
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,797
...do no wrong,
Come not near our fairy queen.

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,872
You can never bring in a wall.
What say you, Bottom?

486
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,030
- Some guy or other...
- No, no, no!

487
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,590
My dear Private Logan,
Bottom's not a gangster. Watch!

488
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,830
Some man or other must present wall:

489
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,119
and let him have some plaster or some
loam or some rough-cast about him...

490
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,798
...to signify wall;...

491
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,030
...and let him hold his fingers thus...

492
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,795
...and through that cranny
shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.

493
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,235
- Try that, my boy.
- Can I do the business?

494
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,390
- It's as well, yes.
- Oh, brother!

495
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,233
Some man or other must present wall:

496
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,950
and let him have some plaster or some
loam or some rough-cast about him...

497
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,712
...to signify wall.

Check.

503
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,069
Oh, dear, I didn't see that one coming.

504
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,030
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, Frank.

505
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,270
Squadron Leader Carter - Dr Reeves.

506
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,511
- Do I get some tea?
- It's ordered. Ginger cookies.

507
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,909
- Good. Who's winning?
- June's good.

508
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,468
<i>But he's winning. Sit down, everybody.</i>

509
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,038
Thank you.

510
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,916
- I've told Peter.
- What?

511
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,468
Who you are, what you are,
all about you.

512
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,438
- Tall order.
- And I've told you all about him.

513
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,909
- Has she read your poems?
- What poems?

514
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,275
Didn't you know? This is Peter Carter.

515
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,158
- I didn't know.
- We hadn't got around to that.

516
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,198
I haven't got much modern stuff,
but you're there.

517
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,078
- Good.
- I like your viewpoint, your English.

518
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,720
- I hope we shall have some talks.
- So do I.

519
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,677
Let's get down to this thing.

520
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,070
You've never had any visions
or hallucinations before?

521
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,116
- Never.
- What were you before?

522
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,156
I did European History at Oxford.

523
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,118
- Both parents alive?
- My mother.

524
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,395
- Brothers, sisters?
- Two sisters.

525
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,040
What was the cause
of your father's death?

526
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,678
Same as mine.

527
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,512
- Brain?
- No, war.

528
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,192
- When?
- 1917.

529
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,840
- You're... er... 29?
- 27.

530
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,672
- Called up?
- Volunteered.

531
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,194
- Trained in Canada. Ops in '41.
- Bomber?

532
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,840
Coastals, then instructor,
back to bombers.

533
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,036
- Must've done a good many ops?
- 67.

534
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,192
They let you go back
with your experience and seniority?

535
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,430
- New job. Master bomber.
- Tricky?

536
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,875
- Somebody's got to do it.
- Hmm.

537
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,790
Now... about these headaches.

538
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,030
- When did they start?
- Headaches?

539
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,750
I know you get them and you've told
nobody about them, especially your MO.

540
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,310
- What else do you know?
- I know about your eyes.

541
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,960
- You know a good deal.
- Like to know more.

542
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,598
All right.

543
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,599
Now, these headaches,
when did they start?

544
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,238
- Six months ago.
- Bad?

545
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,799
- Not at first.
- Where?

546
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,713
- Here.
- Frontal and temporal.

547
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,792
Did you ever have
a rather nasty bang on the head?

548
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,836
- I don't think so.
- Sure?

549
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,036
The usual one - dropped as a baby.

550
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,350
Has that spoilt everything for you?

551
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,989
- Yes, I'm afraid it does.
- I'll see what I can cook up.

552
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,038
- Do you mind if I try something?
- No, go ahead.

553
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,476
Now... er... just face this way. Don't move.

554
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,112
Now, don't move your eyes,
look straight ahead.

555
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,270
- Check.
- What are you looking at?

556
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,477
- The girl with red hair and legs!
- Right, I've got her.

557
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,869
- Don't take your eyes off her.
- Easy!

558
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,953
Without moving your eyes,
what can you see on the extreme right?

559
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,996
- Fireplace.
- In the centre?

560
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,036
- Girl.
- Extreme left?

561
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,838
Windows?

562
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,672
- Curtains?
- Yes.

563
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,318
- Colour?
- Red.

564
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,992
Right, that'll do.

565
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,799
If you've quite done staring
at that girl's legs...

566
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,836
You've got to do as the doctor says.

567
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,912
Confidentially,
they're rather knock-kneed.

568
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,989
Hmm.

569
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,036
- Any loss of appetite?
- No.

570
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,076
- Nor of thirst?
- No fear.

571
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,197
You've been eating and drinking
more than usual.

572
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,956
- You've just seen my mess bills!
- And you've... seen something.

573
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,156
- Someone.
- Clearly?

574
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,798
As clear as I see you.

575
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,917
- Had such an hallucination before?
- No, thanks.

576
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,755
Do you believe in the survival of
human personality after death?

577
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,149
I thought you said you read my verses.

578
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,037
Do you?

579
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,999
I don't know, I've never thought about it.
Do you?

580
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,878
I don't know.
I've thought about it too much.

581
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,353
- I thought I was asked to tea.
- It isn't time yet.

582
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,590
Past my time. One last question.

583
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,231
It may sound silly,
but have you imagined recently...

584
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,790
...that you've smelt something
that couldn't be there?

585
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,916
What an extraordinary thing!

586
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,752
- What is?
- How did you know?

587
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,398
A long shot. You have?

588
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,153
Yes. It was so silly,
I'd never have told you.

589
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,676
It might explain everything abnormal
you've seen and heard.

590
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,514
But it still can't explain how I can jump
without a parachute and be alive.

591
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,309
No, but there might be a possible
explanation even of that.

592
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,154
Now, this heavenly messenger,
you saw him quite clearly?

593
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,196
I told you, as clear as I see you.

594
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,840
This smell you imagined
was at the same time?

595
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,876
Yes, it was particularly strong.

596
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,678
- A pleasant smell?
- Yes.

597
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,194
- Could you place it?
- Fried onions.

598
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,750
And this messenger,
he hasn't turned up again?

599
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,398
- No, but he will.
- When?

600
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,474
- He picks his own time and stops it.
- Peter's appealed against his call-up.

601
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,314
- That's the spirit. Don't give in.
- I won't.

602
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,119
I'm lucky June knew you.
Thank you for coming.

603
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,634
June has lucky friends. I've got bad news.

604
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,995
- Why the grin?
- You're going with me.

605
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,116
- Where?
- My house. For two reasons.

606
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,350
I want to meet this chap next time...

607
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,556
...and I like a nice girl in the house.

608
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,791
She only comes to borrow a book
and she's a slow reader!

609
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,519
- What about my CO?
- I've fixed it with him.

610
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,592
Besides, until we get this settled,
I'm your CO.

611
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,910
At my house, you get your tea at 4.30.

612
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,594
<i>(man) Tea break!</i>

613
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,636
Here you get it at five.

614
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,318
Sinkers, Doc?

615
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,958
Thank you.

616
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,474
We're shaping, Frank, we're shaping!

617
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,076
<i>(ping-pong game in progress)</i>

618
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,516
<i>(rhythmic batting of the ball)</i>

619
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,596
<i>(Dr Reeves) Ohhh!</i>

620
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,238
<i>(batting stops)</i>

621
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,276
<i>(batting resumes)</i>

622
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,236
Ah-ha! 20-all!

623
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,796
21-20. Sorry.

624
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,348
- You're sorry, my foot! Ready?
- Ready.

625
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,518
- Nearly.
- Nearly doesn't count. 21-all.

626
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,872
- I'll be...
- Count 10.

627
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,916
I wonder if Peter's a good player.

628
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,958
- Ask him when he wakes.
- He's been asleep 21/2 hours.

629
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,996
- He'll wake at 11.
- How do you know?

630
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,230
- I gave him a tablet.
- How can you tell?

631
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,675
<i>- I know the patient.
- Do you know him?</i>

632
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,716
- I think so.
- Tell me about him!

633
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,553
Are we playing table tennis
or are we not?

634
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,631
- All right, your serve.
- Ready?

635
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,676
- Ready.
- Ohh!

636
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,318
Your game.

637
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,790
Now tell me what you think about him.

638
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,599
- I think he's fascinating.
- So do I.

639
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,636
Not biologically. Medically.

640
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,676
- Have a drink?
- Love one.

641
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,956
What do the books say, Doc?

642
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,991
I see a dark stranger in his life.

643
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,950
Do you know what's wrong with him?

644
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,792
Yes, I think I do.

645
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,836
Is he... going to be all right?

646
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,309
He'll be all right. Here's your drink.

647
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,789
Will he have any more hallucinations?

648
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,836
- Yes.
- How do you know?

649
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,878
Because this conductor
promised to come back.

650
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,599
- Will that make him worse?
- Why should it?

651
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,639
I don't know. Seeing things,
arguing about his own life.

652
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,508
<i>- Talking to a non-existent man...
- He does exist for him.</i>

653
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,831
He's not going mad?
His brain isn't being affected?

654
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,911
<i>It is, but not in the way you mean.</i>

655
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,719
That's why I asked him
about his sense of smell.

656
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,552
I saw it was important.

657
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,598
He's having highly organised
hallucinations...

658
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,353
...comparable to an experience
of actual life.

659
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,159
A combination of vision,
hearing and idea.

660
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,199
To a neurologist, it points directly
to the sense of smell or taste.

661
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,034
Once that connection's established,
we know where to look.

662
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,398
I want to find out one thing more
in his history. I'll find it out later.

663
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,833
Now...

664
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,678
- I'm not going to tell you any more.
- Thanks.

665
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,797
- But how did he survive the jump?
- I don't know.

666
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,031
If we could find out and tell him,
it would save him.

667
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,749
It would help, but the main thing
is for him to win his case.

668
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,593
- Are you serious?
- Perfectly serious.

669
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,830
- We must help him to win it.
- How?

670
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,992
It depends on what message
the conductor brings.

671
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,514
But... suppose he loses his case?

672
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,158
Oh, that's absurd!

673
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,312
If we see he's losing
or we think he's going to lose,...

674
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,676
...we'll find out the reason he survived
or we'll invent one.

675
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,716
We'll have a couple of drinks...

676
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,156
...and we'll invent the greatest lie
in medical history.

677
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,629
- Care for another game?
- I don't mind.

678
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,870
- Don't worry. See that bell?
- Yes.

679
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,349
He'll ring it if he gets another visit.

680
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,396
- Fine.
- Come on, your serve.

681
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,836
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

682
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,198
One-love.

683
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,792
<i>(no sound)</i>

684
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,758
<i>(no sound)</i>

685
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,276
Doc, he's here! June!

686
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,233
Doc?

687
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,795
Eh bien, mon cher, comment ça va?

688
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,438
Not too good.

689
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,476
Not too good. Ah.

690
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,911
I would not bother to ring that bell
if I were you. Nothing will happen.

691
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,309
A little trick of mine. You remember?

692
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,958
After all,...

693
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,996
...what is time?

694
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,036
<i>(wind whistles violently)</i>

695
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,792
<i>(thunder)</i>

696
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,556
A mere... tyranny.

697
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,199
Let me know if you're
going to do that again.

698
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,840
- Looks good.
- Very good. Know the author?

699
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,354
No, but I often have a game with Philidor.

700
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,238
- Philidor?
- The greatest chess master ever.

701
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,198
A Frenchman.
Come along and I'll introduce you.

702
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,633
- Good.
- Splendid!

703
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,553
- You've got good news for me.
- How did you guess?

704
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,074
You wouldn't entice me with Philimor...

705
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,311
- Philidor.
- ...if you had the right to conduct me.

706
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,958
- True.
- Well?

707
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,998
Speaking officially,
I have good news for you.

708
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,229
Good!

709
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,198
- You can appeal to the High Court.
- Splendid!

710
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,671
The trial will be très chic. In three days
so you can prepare your case.

711
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,318
Better and better.

712
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,960
- Do not be too pleased.
- Is there a catch?

713
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,996
The prosecuting counsel.

714
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,914
I am not permitted to offer advice
or give a personal opinion but...

715
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,150
- Who is this counsel?
- Be prepared.

716
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,798
- For what?
- A shock.

717
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,236
- Tell me the worst. Who is it?
- Abraham Farlan.

718
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,276
- Come again?
- Abraham Farlan!

719
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,918
- Never heard of him.
- No?

720
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,797
- Never.
- He lives in Boston.

721
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,110
- I've never been.
- Massachusetts.

722
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,751
- I've never been there!
- Abraham Farlan died in Boston in 1775.

723
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,229
Does that date convey anything to you?

724
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,117
Lexington, Concord.

725
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,715
You are good at history.
The American War of Independence.

726
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,473
- Oh, he was killed?
- By a British bullet.

727
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,279
Oh. He might be... prejudiced.

728
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,510
Hmm. He hates your guts.

729
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,672
And he hates the guts
of every Englishman.

730
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,309
And he hates this little affair
with the Boston-born girl.

731
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,072
It's not a little affair.

732
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,232
Ohh, a big affair he will hate even more!

733
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,470
- I'll appeal against him.
- No good!

734
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,632
We had to choose a good man.
Our honour is at stake.

735
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,280
Non, you must choose
a good man for yourself.

736
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,669
- As defending counsel?
- Precisely.

737
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,469
- Can I choose anybody?
- Anybody who's ever lived on earth.

738
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,516
Everybody is at your disposal.

739
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,558
<i>- You can choose me.
- That would suit your book.</i>

740
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,349
Do not waste time. Abraham Farlan
is piling up his case already.

741
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,159
You can choose Socrates, William Pitt,...

742
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,196
...you can choose Henry Vlll.

743
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,236
Oh, Madame Du Barry.

744
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,630
- She knows all about love.
- Rather a one-track mind.

745
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,188
You are a good chess player. Philidor.

746
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,838
I'll think it over.

747
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,070
By the way, I'd like to borrow this.

748
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,515
It's not mine, it belongs to the doctor.

749
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,591
- Oh, doctors.
- What about them?

750
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,478
They give me a great deal
of trouble in my job.

751
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,596
<i>(bell rings)</i>

752
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,676
- He was here! He tricked us!
- Yes, he was... here.

753
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,436
And these were on the floor.

754
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,476
Peter, sit down.

755
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,229
Now...

756
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,878
...look up.

757
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,269
You've been doing some hard talking.

758
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,509
I have.

759
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,750
- You didn't give in to anything?
- No.

760
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,400
- That's the spirit.
- Can I stay overnight?

761
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,278
- Yes, I'll tell Mrs Tucker.
- I don't need much.

762
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,316
Now, let's see.

763
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,519
Hmm. I'll tell Mrs Tucker you're staying.

764
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,149
Dr Reeves, can I stay in here?
I want to be near these books.

765
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,231
Of course. I'll fix up a camp bed.

766
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,478
Great news, darling.

767
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,630
- I'm allowed to appeal.
- Really?

768
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,676
June, I don't want to leave you.

769
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,116
Darling, why should you?
Everything will be all right.

770
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,158
- If I can get a good counsel.
- Of course you will.

771
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,959
It's very important.
I don't want to lose you.

772
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,999
I don't intend to let you go.
No-one can take you. I won't let them.

773
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,833
A judgement against me
would be backed up...

774
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,878
...by all the power of this world
and of the other.

775
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,678
Drink this.

776
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,638
- Peter's got the right to appeal.
- Splendid.

777
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,278
- Smell anything?
- Yes.

778
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,918
- Fried onions?
- Yes.

779
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,956
Good. Drink that up.

780
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,396
- Any headache?
- Mm.

781
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,436
Tell me tomorrow what he said.

782
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,078
No, he said...

783
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,832
- Good heavens!
- What is it?

784
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,071
- He got my Hundred Best Games.
- Alekhese's chess book!

785
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,720
- You sure?
- Certain. He had it in his hand.

786
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,552
- What a nerve!
- A bit cool.

787
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,438
- Now, get to bed.
- I want to talk to you first.

788
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,513
No, have a long sleep.
Tomorrow, you'll feel as fresh as a daisy.

789
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,592
- You don't believe a word I say!
- Of course we do!

790
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,389
My dear friend, here on Earth
I am your defending counsel.

791
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,631
<i>As your counsel,
I believe everything you tell me.</i>

792
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,430
- Dr Gaerlter.
- Hello, Dr Reeves.

793
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,478
You make your rounds the hard way.
Give me a coupe!

794
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,279
- Is Dr McEwen free?
- He's going to operate.

795
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,319
He hasn't started yet.
I imagine he'll see you in the washroom.

796
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,998
- Hello, Frank, what's new?
- Deterioration.

797
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,036
We ought to operate tonight.

798
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,953
Impossible, we're swamped.
Sure of your diagnosis?

799
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,113
Certain. He had slight concussion
two years ago - no aftereffects.

800
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,156
The X-ray's inconclusive.

801
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,472
You know about these hallucinations
coupled with a sense of smell.

802
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,473
It points to arachnoid adhesions
involving the olfactory nerve.

803
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,551
A tricky op. I've never seen one.

804
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,359
I have - at the Hospital de la Pitié in Paris.

805
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,749
I've made some notes for the surgeon.

806
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,400
It'll be Dr Leiser, a fine neurosurgeon.

807
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,278
- Leiser, good man.
- We can't manage tonight.

808
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,396
There's no crisis in such a thing.

809
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,436
- Any day will do.
- No, it won't.

810
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,954
<i>I'll tell you why and why there is a crisis.</i>

811
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,873
I'm afraid his brain
may be permanently affected.

812
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,313
Insanity?

813
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,753
- Yes.
- Why?

814
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,311
Because his trial is on for tonight.
He hasn't found anyone to defend him.

815
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,359
He spends all his time in my library.
He only sleeps when I drug him.

816
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,635
The boy has a fine mind but it's taxed.

817
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,154
That's the trouble, it's too good a mind.

818
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,118
A weak mind isn't strong enough
to hurt itself.

819
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,873
Stupidity has saved many a man
from going mad.

820
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,518
Yes, you're right there.

821
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,990
He's had several talks
with this heavenly messenger.

822
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,436
Hallucinations, but you never saw
such an imagination!

823
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,672
I've been taking tips on the other world -
law, system, architecture.

824
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,639
Interestingly, he never crosses
the limits of his imagination.

825
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,996
- I don't get you.
- Nothing he invents is fantastic.

826
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,640
It's invention, but logical invention.

827
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,713
The keystone to his invention
is that the trial takes place tonight.

828
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,268
He must win or lose his case tonight.

829
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,591
We ought to operate tonight.
No use shaking your head.

830
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,992
<i>We need to find a counsel to save him
losing his case or we may lose him!</i>

831
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,796
What about...

832
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,438
...him?

833
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,318
Lincoln?

834
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,632
<i>No, it's hardly fair to drag him in.
I don't believe he'd be prejudiced.</i>

835
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,758
Plato.

836
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,879
How would you like
to be defended by Plato?

837
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,916
Nobody knew more about reasoning.

838
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,709
He was 81 when he died. He might be
too old to think love important.

839
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,112
Do you think so? Anyhow, Plato had
very elementary ideas about love.

840
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,555
Besides, didn't he quote Sophocles...

841
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,189
...when someone asked him
if he could still appreciate a woman?

842
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,909
- What did the old boy say?
- "I'm glad to be rid of all that".

843
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,037
"It's like escaping from bondage
to a raving madman".

844
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,155
Tut!

845
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,674
These Greeks - cold as their marble.

846
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,151
If he had been French... Richelieu,
for example. Irresistible at 80!

847
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,992
How about Richelieu?

848
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,390
No, I never liked him much
in "The Three Musketeers".

849
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,396
<i>(conductor) Solomon.</i>

850
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,033
Solomon?

851
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,751
Non?

852
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,628
Mais, mon Dieu, who do you want?
You have only a few hours left!

853
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,508
It sounds a grand idea to have
all these great men to choose from,...

854
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,478
...but what do they know
of our problems today?

855
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,312
True. Very little.

856
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,278
Besides,
I think it ought to be an Englishman.

857
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,750
Nobody famous, but somebody
with his head screwed on.

858
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,078
Screwed?

859
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,833
- Now, this Abraham... er...?
- Farlan.

860
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,638
Was he a famous man?

861
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,109
First American killed by a British bullet.

862
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,873
I mean, was he a great philosopher
or statesman?

863
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,713
- He was a schoolteacher.
- There, you see!

864
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,918
Now, Plato would probably talk about
perceptions and causations.

865
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,758
Pardon?

866
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,559
- Over your head, too?
- Definitely.

867
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,596
It's quite simple...

868
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,309
<i>By the way, why are you so interested
in my winning my case?</i>

869
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,753
I?

870
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,592
Yes, you!

871
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,798
And why am I being taken up
this... stairway?

872
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,270
I'm not being taken for a ride, am I?

873
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,557
- What a suggestion!
- Take that bit of barley sugar away.

874
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,599
I don't like it or your suggestions!
I'll go back before it's too late.

875
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,636
Peter! Peter!

876
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,078

Why isn't the ambulance here?
It was due half an hour ago.

898
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,719
Phone Dr McEwen, say we must
operate tonight. It's life or death.

899
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,112
Tell him about the ambulance.
Telegraph his mother and two sisters.

900
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,156
- Yes, Doctor.
- That's all.

901
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,278
Now, Peter...

902
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,079
- Where's June?
- Phoning. Back in a moment.

903
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,798
- He almost got me.
- I know.

904
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,713
Crafty beggar.
I got away by the skin of my teeth.

905
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,758
Don't let anybody fool you
into giving up this case!

906
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,991
You were promised a fair trial.
Don't give in! Promise?

907
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,514
- Got no counsel.
- We'll find the right man.

908
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,388
- They can't start without counsel.
- They may appoint some stooge.

909
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,596
- Nonsense.
- Or let it go by default.

910
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,638
We'll find somebody.
They can't start till then.

911
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,073
Nobody famous!

912
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,515
No, that'd be the worst thing we could do.

913
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,319
- How about a pal of yours?
- Might find somebody.

914
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,197
- Your radio operator?
- Bob?

915
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,032
Yes. Think it over.

916
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,111
- You couldn't get through?
- No.

917
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,760
It's the storm.
They always cut the phone off.

918
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,071
- I'll go on my bike.
- No, you're more valuable here.

919
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,799
If the ambulance comes,
don't wait for me.

920
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,836
And if I meet it, I'll come back.

921
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,229
Go to him, don't allow him to despair.

922

I must talk to him.
I don't think Bob's the right man.

928
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,916
I'll tell him you said so.

He was a fine man.

Yes.

947
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,070
I saw his notes he left for Dr Leiser.

948
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,151
It was a fine piece of diagnosis.

949
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,549
He left notes for the operation, too.

Not up there, either.

01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,915
No.

1012
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,549
<i>- If he gets onto politics, I'm sunk.
- You must have something.</i>

1013
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,315
- Oh, just a little common sense.
- That's rare - it'll do me.

1014
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,549
- Say yes!
- Well...

1015
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,552
- He has no choice.
- What are we talking about, then?

1016
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,596
All right, I need evidence.

1017
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,392
Look at her.

1018
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,232
Holy smoke!

1019
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,073
- What?
- She looks like a nice girl.

1020
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,993
<i>- She is a nice girl.
- Hardly your type, skip.</i>

1021
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,076
I've fallen in love with her.

1022
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,116
Her accent is foreign,...

1023
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,156
...but it sounds sweet to me.

1024
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,959
We were born thousands of miles apart,...

1025
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,270
...but we were made for each other.

1026
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,920
That's an excellent piece of prose.

1027
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,433
Sorry.

1028
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,476
Nothing to be ashamed of.

1029
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,120
May I kiss her? Just in case, you know.

1030
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,589
You may, but she will not know it.

1031
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,432
Doesn't matter.

1032
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:52,109
These English! What is the good of
kissing a girl if she does not feel it?

1033
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,509
Look!

1034
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,795
- What?
- The evidence you wanted.

1035
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,632
Her tears.

1036
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,110
Oh, I wish I could take one with me.

1037
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,509
You are counsel, you can do as you wish.

1038
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,160
Why don't we wrap it up
and take it with us?

1039
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,958
Permit me.

1040
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,758
That's it.

1041
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,149
The only real bit of evidence we have.

1042
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,719
Quick,
we must not keep the court waiting.

1043
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,432
The Court of Appeal
sits to consider the case...

1044
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,636
...of the Department of Records...

1045
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:03,429
...versus Squadron Leader
Peter David Carter of the RAF.

1046
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,433
He claims negligence and superior
rights and responsibilities...

1047
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,511
...arising out of that negligence.

1048
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,752
He is appealing for remission
of the date of his term on Earth...

1049
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,479
...and for a reconsideration of his case.

1050
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,120
It has been decided to allow this appeal.

1051
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,829
It is for the jury to decide
whether it shall be successful.

1052
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,758
Owing to the interest aroused
by the case...

1053
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,400
...there is an unusually large audience.

1054
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:33,075
We can, of course, seat everyone
who wishes to be present.

1055
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,517
The front rows are reserved for those
with a special interest in the case.

1056
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,151
Members of the jury, do not allow
yourselves to be influenced...

1057
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,196
...by anything but the facts...

1058
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,236
...and by your conscience.

1059
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,598
You'll have assistance from the court
to help you arrive at your verdict.

1060
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,230
The counsel for the prosecution
will take his place.

1061
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,072
The counsel for the defence
will take his place.

1062
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,518
I call upon the prosecution
to open the case.

1063
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,753
Your Honour, members of the jury,...

1064
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,796
...this case has three issues.

1065
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,478
Peter D Carter, an Englishman,...

1066
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,394
...should have died
on the second day of May, 1945,...

1067
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,473
...at ten after four of the clock,
British Double Summer Time.

1068
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,118
Due to an oversight,...

1069
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,432
...which I hasten to state is contrary
to the traditions of a great service,...

1070
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,316
...the defendant did not die.

1071
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,198
Therefore, issue No. 1,
who is responsible?

1072
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,078
When summoned to report
20-odd hours later,...

1073
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,516
...the defendant refused to accompany
Conductor 71,...

1074
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,354
...giving as his reason that
in the time which he had borrowed...

1075
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,273
...he had accumulated
new responsibilities...

1076
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,591
...of an allegedly important
and permanent nature.

1077
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,831
He claimed, in fact,
that in these 20 hours...

1078
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,629
...a young lady of good American stock...

1079
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,676
...had fallen in love with him.

1080
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,356
Therefore issue No. 2.

1081
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,590
Are we to believe this?

1082
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,875
Furthermore, he states...

1083
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,951
...in these borrowed 20 hours...

1084
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,679
My lord,
I object to the word "borrowed",...

1085
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,320
...which counsel is using so emphatically.

1086
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,837
To borrow means to get temporary use of
something without being the true owner.

1087
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,550
<i>My client didn't get,
he was given the 20 hours in question.</i>

1088
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,074
He didn't use something he didn't own.

1089
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,116
He was the owner of his own life.

1090
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,238
The next points are,...

1091
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:09,632
...is this young Englishman in love
with this girl of American stock?

1092
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,917
Even more important,
is she in love with him?

1093
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,673
(Dr Reeves)
Why stress their nationalities?

1094
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,955
Very important, sir. Extremely important.

1095
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,429
- Why?
- Because we are talking of love.

1096
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:24,752
<i>(Reeves) It can happen between
an Englishman and an American girl.</i>

1097
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,796
And... er... vice versa.

1098
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,438
Possibly.

1099
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,512
But what are these love affairs,
Dr Reeves?

1100
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,115
Men and women thousands of miles
away from home,...

1101
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,998
...away from the love they left behind.

1102
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,072
Minute sparks
instead of scorching flames,...

1103
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:45,756
...fading, shabby wigs instead of
the rich gold of a woman's hair.

1104
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,638
The love of the moment, Dr Reeves.

1105
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,392
Do I call it love?

1106
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,517
Once in a thousand times, perhaps.

1107
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,398
And how many end in lasting marriage?

1108
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,232
One in ten thousand.

1109
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,752
- My case, sir!
- That, sir, is for you to prove.

1110
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,594
When our men and women came
to your country as your allies,...

1111
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,069
...it was not to become your prisoners.

1112
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:12,039
May I bring you up to date? We're living
in the 20th century, not the 18th.

1113
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,076
<i>May I bring you up to date, sir?</i>

1114
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,796
We are not alive at all.

1115
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,632
Good point.

1116
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,676
<i>And I am up to date, sir.</i>

1117
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,797
I've been watching you English
from upstairs.

1118
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,519
Your wars, your politics, your busyness.

1119
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,672
From the tax on tea in 1766...

1120
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,716
...to a certain report...

1121
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:36,032
...on England by five members
of the United States Senate in 1944.

1122
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:39,510
The defendant has nothing to do
with tea or senators.

1123
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,556
But other Englishmen had, sir.

1124
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,871
Is Peter D Carter
what you'd call a good Englishman?

1125
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,313
Yes, sir.

1126
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,556
Do you see this glass?

1127
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,792
Out of it Benedict Arnold drank
the health of King George lll.

1128
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,789
Does it break because it is faulty
or because it is glass?

1129
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:05,552
Can I tear this paper because it is
defective or because it is paper?

1130
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,915
We are all as God made us, sir,...

1131
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,629
...but our ancestors had a deal to do
in shaping us as well.

1132
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,039
I quite agree.

1133
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,076
The jury will please note that.

1134
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:18,755
My lord, may I ask where
Mr Farlan's grandfather was born?

1135
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,196
- The question is irrelevant.
- Could it have been England?

1136
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,396
You need not answer that question.

1137
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,471
I prefer to answer, Your Honour.

1138
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,916
Grandfather left England, sir,
because he didn't like it.

1139
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,833
Granddad would've liked it
even less today.

1140
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,478
Listen.

1141
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,516
<i>"Well, here we are at Lord's..."</i>

1142
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,160
The voice of England in 1945.

1143
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,268
<i>"And here let me say that the weather...</i>

1144
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,750
<i>...is more like cricket weather -
it's stopped raining".</i>

1145
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,833
<i>"Play has been resumed and
the crowd of about 50,000 people...</i>

and umbrellas...</i>

<i>...and settled down to enjoy the game

1148
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,433
<i>...more truly represents all that's English
than anything else".</i>

1149
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,512
Do you admit that this is
an English voice, sir?

1150

I concede your point.

You've already called Peter Carter.

- He will be if you give him time.

1177
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:20,598
...be slowed to the crawl
of a match of cricket?

1178
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,240
Should her accustomed native comfort...

1179
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:27,199
...perforce conform to England's
warm drinks, cold rooms,...

1180
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,670
...draughty windows, smoky chimneys,
faulty plumbing?

1181
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:34,435
<i>Two million houses have no windows,
frequently no roof or walls.</i>

1182
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,399
This court is concerned with
the life and death of Peter Carter,...

1183
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,199
...not with past history
or present plumbing.

1184
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,795
- Hear, hear!
- Peter Carter's character, sir,...

1185
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,351
...like every other human being was
formed by a chain of circumstances.

1186
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,194
As Benjamin Franklin said,
for want of a nail, the shoe was lost.

1187
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,350
For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.

1188
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,590
For want of a horse, the rider was lost.

1189
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,830
For want of a rider, the message was lost.

1190
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,232
For want of a message, the kingdom
was lost. All for want of a nail!

1191
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,039
You've heard of Benjamin Franklin, sir?

1192
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,076
In George Washington's words,...

1193
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,549
"Labour to keep alive in your breast...

1194
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,155
...that little spark of celestial fire
called conscience".

1195
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,834
That could not have been said
by an Englishman.

1196
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,876
What was George Washington?

1197
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,276
Conscience, Mr Farlan.

1198
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,114
Are you insinuating that something
is wrong with my conscience?

1199
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,872
- I am.
- Your Honour, I protest.

1200
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,635
I am trying to give a full picture
of this case to the jury.

1201
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,870
You are trying to prejudice the jury, sir.

1202
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,351
I see that they've been selected from
many races, creeds and nationalities.

1203
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,796
I cannot believe them interested
in ancient grudges...

1204
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,236
...nor in present grumblings
about draughty windows.

1205
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,276
I don't need to prejudice the jury.

1206
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,318
They're already prejudiced
and with good reason!

1207
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:55,758
You can't pick one that isn't.
Look closely at the members of the jury.

1208
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,235
- The first member is...
- Jean-Marie Barault, French!

1209
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:05,074
Has a century passed without war
between England and France?

1210
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:09,472
- The second member is...
- Gregorius Johannes Bund, sir.

1211
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,109
The Boer War, Dr Reeves.
The third member is...

1212
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,430
- Ivan Berdei, Russki.
- What?

1213
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,272
I am Russian.

1214
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,035
The Crimean War, Dr Reeves.
And you, sir?

1215
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,678
Chang Chi Min, Peking.

1216
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,116
Don't forget England's attack
on China in 1857.

1217
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,510
Occupying unprotected Peking.

1218
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,318
And you, sir?

1219
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,550
Raha Tejpalal from the Punjab.

1220
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,870
Think of India, Dr Reeves.

1221
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,712
Think of India.

1222
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,836
And you, sir, you are...?

1223
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,797
James Monaghan, Irish.

1224
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,679
Choose a new jury anywhere, Dr Reeves.

1225
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,991
It will always be prejudiced
against your country.

1226
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,596
My lord, I wish to take counsel
for the prosecution's advice.

1227
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:58,229
I challenge the jury and request
that a new one be chosen.

1228
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,436
Chosen from where, Dr Reeves?

1229
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,954
- Mr Farlan said anywhere.
- Except England.

1230
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:07,192
Why not? Where else have the rights
of the individual been held so high?

1231
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,114
In America, sir, where these rights
are held to be inalienable!

1232
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,760
I doubt if you have more freedom
than England.

1233
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,991
An Englishman thinks as he likes
in religion and politics.

1234
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:21,232
It isn't what a man thinks and says,
it's when and where and to whom.

1235
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:26,519
A man with a flint and steel striking
sparks over a wet blanket is one thing,...

1236
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,398
...but striking them
over a tinderbox is another!

1237
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:34,508
An American baby sucks in freedom with
the milk of the breast at which he hangs.

1238
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,991
A man can see further, sir,
from the top of Boston State House,...

1239
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:43,835
...and see more worth seeing than from
the pyramids, turrets and steeples...

1240
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,876
...of all the places of the world.

1241
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,916
No smoke, sir,...

1242
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,672
...no fog, sir,...

1243
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,639
...and a clean sweep from
the outer light and the sea beyond...

1244
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,870
...to the New Hampshire mountains!

1245
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,520
Yes, sir, there are great truths...

1246
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,751
...higher than mountains
and broader than seas...

1247
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,912
<i>...that people look for
from the tops of our hills!</i>

1248
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,956
America, sir,...

1249
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:10,157
...is the only place
where man is full grown!

1250
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,196
<i>(applause)</i>

1251
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,320
Then I choose a jury of Americans.

1252
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,959
Of Americans, sir, selected from
every walk of American life.

1253
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,112
If one has fought
in the Wars of Independence,...

1254
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:41,671
...I want one who has fought with us
against our enemies in this century.

1255
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,833
If the third has a mind that can
only think 170 years back,...

1256
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,230
...I want the fourth to be thinking
170 years ahead.

1257
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,470
I cannot deny that I hope,...

1258
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,712
<i>...that I know that this jury will be
prejudiced in favour of my case...</i>

1259
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,998
...for I am pleading for the rights of
the individual against the system.

1260
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,878
But it is also against the law, Dr Reeves,...

1261
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,110
...the eternal law of the universe.

1262
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:09,910
Nothing is stronger than the law.
The whole universe is built upon it.

1263
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,549
This is a court of justice, not of law.

1264
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:17,997
My lord, I ask for a new jury
of American citizens.

1265
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,676
Do you agree, Mr Farlan?

1266
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,069
I'd welcome such a jury, Your Honour.

1267
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,116
The jury will stand.

1268
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:33,077
The jury will retire
and a new jury will take their place.

1269
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,554
Robert Dupont, American citizen.

1270
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,998
Lt Pete Vandereyk, American citizen.

1271
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,760
Alexander Barbanov, American citizen.

1272
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,591
George Wong, American citizen.

1273
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,596
Jefferson Lincoln Brown,...

1274
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,636
...American citizen.

1275
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:21,598
Patrick Aloysius Mahoney,
American citizen.

1276
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,476
The jury will be seated.

1277
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,196
Counsel for the defence.

1278
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,960
Here in this rose is my case.

1279
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:37,032
What is my case?
I entirely agree with Mr Farlan.

1280
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,999
Has Peter Carter fallen in love
during the allotted extra...

1281
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,433
Borrowed.

1282
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,438
...disputed extra 20 hours he had
or hasn't he?

1283
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:49,479
Has someone - the name is unimportant -
fallen in love with him?

1284
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,996
Now, here are two young people
who would never have met...

1285
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,036
...but for a mistake higher up,...

1286
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,874
...penalised for the most natural
and simple thing in the world.

1287
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,518
They fell in love.

1288
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,556
Here in this tear...

1289
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,950
...are love and truth and friendship.

1290
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:09,669
Those qualities alone
can build a new world today...

1291
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,593
<i>...and must build a better one tomorrow.</i>

1292
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,636
That is my case...

1293
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:19,157
...and, upon it, I demand a verdict
that Peter Carter shall live.

1294
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,389
Your Honour, we feel the defendant
and this young girl...

1295
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,869
...should be given a chance to be heard.

1296
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,633
My lord, nothing is impossible.

1297
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,156
The court will adjourn.

1298
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:51,432
No reason to be without the dimension
of time. They will not disturb us.

1299
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,115
It would help establish
a true picture of the conditions.

1300
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,872
Very well.

1301
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,034
- I call Squ...
- My diagnosis was right.

1302
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:09,274
Fine avascular meningeal adhesions
binding the optic nerve to the brain.

1303
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,828
Similar adhesions
between chiasm and brain.

1304
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,196
<i>Did I tell you about my operation?</i>

1305
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,430
Dr Reeves, we are not here...

1306
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:21,149
...to check your diagnosis,
but to question this young man.

1307
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,753
Quite right.

1308
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,673
I call Squadron Leader Peter D Carter.

1309
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,871
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello, Frank. How's the op going?

1310
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,679
- Fine. Leiser's a good man.
- He'd better be!

1311
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,433
Peter Carter,
you are on the witness stand.

1312
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:39,671
- You are under oath, understand?
- Yes, Mr Farlan.

1313
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,274
- You know me, sir?
- No mistaking you.

1314
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,629
Your smile is not unattractive, sir.

1315
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:50,871
Did you use it to enamour
this young American lady?

1316
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,428
- I love her, sir.
- Answer the question.

1317
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,956
Would you repeat the question?
It had "enamoured" in it.

1318
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,996
Never mind the exact question.

1319
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,914
Did you consciously try to influence
the emotions of this American lady?

1320
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,390
- We fell in love before we met.
- You claim you love her.

1321
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,311
- I do.
- Can you prove it?

1322
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,120
Well, give me time, sir. 50 years will do.

1323
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,872
But can you prove it?

1324
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,350
Can a starving man prove he's hungry
except by eating?

1325
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,396
Would you die for her?

1326
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,357
I would!

1327
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,590
But... er... I'd rather live.

1328
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,638
Young devil!

1329
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,598
Your Honour,
I apologise for the expression.

1330
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,035
- Your witness.
- No questions.

1331
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,031
Conductor 71.

1332
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,759
- Monsieur?
- Is the young lady available?

1333
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,717
She sleeps.

1334
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,836
Sleeps? The jury will note that.

1335
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,876
<i>I put her to sleep.</i>

1336
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,518
Indeed? Why?

1337
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,556
To enable you to call her, sir.

1338
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,596
<i>The jury will please note that.</i>

1339
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:49,636
I do call her, Your Honour.

1340
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,429
You are before the High Court
in the case of Peter Carter.

1341
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,830
You have been called as a witness
by the prosecution.

1342
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,356
You will tell the truth.

1343
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,989
This gentleman
is counsel for the prosecution.

1344
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:13,196
Child, where were you born?

1345
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,838
In Boston, sir.

1346
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,992
- Do you know this man?
- I think so.

1347
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,992
<i>- You think so?
- I only met him a few days ago.</i>

1348
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,036
You hardly know him.

1349
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,395
How can you think you love him?

1350
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,436
<i>- But I do love him.
- Nonsense.</i>

1351
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,398
I object.
Counsel will withdraw the expression.

1352
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,517
It's all right, he's right.
There's no sense in love.

1353
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,910
Wisdom still flowers in Boston.

1354
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,279
- Can you prove that you love him?
- How can I?

1355
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,510
Would you be willing to die for him?

1356
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,555
Yes.

1357
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,077
Would you take his place
in the balance sheet?

1358
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,593
- Yes.
- Don't believe her!

1359
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,636
- Stand aside!
- You've no right!

1360
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:56,473
- How dare you address me like that!
- You must obey.

1361
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,391
Of all the dirty tricks!

1362
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,870
- This is contempt of court!
- Don't answer any more questions.

1363
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:05,953
Do you realise you've forfeited
any chance of winning your case?

1364
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,996
You won't get June as well!

1365
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,516
Your Honour, members of the jury...
I'm afraid he really does love her.

1366
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,953
Your witness.

1367
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,160
June, you know me well.
Do you trust me?

1368
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,832
Yes, Frank, I trust you.

1369
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:26,708
It is absolutely necessary you take
Peter's place in the other world.

1370
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,233
Have you gone mad?!

1371
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,790
If you love him, step onto
this staircase and come with us.

1372
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:34,838
- You are mad!
- It is the only way to prove your love.

1373
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,433
- I do love him.
- No!

1374
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,590
- I ask you to restrain him.
- Granted.

1375
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,033
June.

1376
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,756
Take care, Dr Reeves.

1377
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:52,594
In the whole universe
nothing is stronger than the law.

1378
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,513
Goodbye, darling.

1379
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:28,838
Yes, Mr Farlan, nothing is stronger
than the law in the universe,...

1380
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,718
...but on Earth
nothing is stronger than love.

1381
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,799
Members of the jury,
as Sir Walter Scott is always saying,...

1382
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,429
"...In peace, love tunes
the shepherd's reed,...

1383
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,239
...in war,
he mounts the warrior's steed".

1384
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:53,153
"In halls, in gay attire is seen,...

1385
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,834
...in hamlets, dances on the green".

1386
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:59,117
"Love rules the court, the camp,
the grove...

1387
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,350
...and men below and saints above".

1388
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,591
"For love is heaven,
and heaven is love".

1389
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,828
Will you please consider your verdict?

1390
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,109
Case for the defendant, Your Honour.

1391
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,758
Bravo!

1392
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,796
The appeal is granted.

1393
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:19,953
There now remains the new date
on Squadron Leader Carter's file.

1394
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,996
Will both counsel approve it?

1395
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,668
- Does that satisfy you, Dr Reeves?
- Very generous, my lord.

1396
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,716
Do you agree, Mr Farlan?

1397
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:34,836
Isn't that a little too much, Your Honour?
I agree.

1398
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,038
My lord, I hope this will not
establish a precedent.

1399
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,076
<i>- (both) I object!
- Er, you, sir.</i>

1400
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,879
- You, sir.
- The rights of the common man...

1401
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,110
- The uncommon man.
- Exactly!

1402
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:49,749
The rights of the uncommon man
must always be respected.

1403
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,592
<i>(Farlan) Exactly!</i>

1404
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,792
Keep his head firm.

1405
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,079
- Tell the nurse I'll send the notes.
- Yes, sir.

1406
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:10,353
- Congratulations.
- An interesting case.

1407
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,198
Peter,...

1408
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:22,033
...don't forget your book.

1409
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,638
Frank...

1410
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,513
Frank...

1411
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,118
Frank.

1412
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,713
Hello.

1413
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,153
Hello.

1414
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,356
We won.

1415
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,396
I know, darling.

1416
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:35,756
