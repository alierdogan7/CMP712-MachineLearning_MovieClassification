00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,523
in front
of our guests.

345
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,522
Hello?
Phil!

346
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,524
You're still upstate,
aren't you?

347
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,968
Do go on,
Mr Faure.

348
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,123
- Phil, I can't talk.
- Hmm?

349
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,931
- You were up to where you had her parcels.
- Ofzyes

350
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,526
[Whispering]
I'm excited.

351
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,809
<i>I found this
extra parcel.</i>

352
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,848
I knew I had 9,
and now 10.

353
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,400
“What was going on?”
I say to myself.

354
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,609
I open it
and it was...

355
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,967
ah,
ladies' underwears.

356
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,849
Ladies' underwear.

357
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,127
Exactement.

358
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,929
So...

359
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,843
I called Anton,

360
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,969
and he said,
“It must belong to Betty.”

361
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,849
You mean Bronte.

362
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,963
Yes.
Bronte.

363
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,044
But I didn't know
her name.

364
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,282
So, now I did.

365
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,203
<i>That's it.</i>

366
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,601
May I use
your bathroom?

367
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,444
Hmm?

368
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,090
Bathroom?

369
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,083
What for?

370
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,125
Ah, well,
I need to use it.

371
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,123
<i>- Bathroom.
- Oh!</i>

372
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,329
- Please go ahead.
- Where is it?

373
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,051
- What?
- <i>The lavatory.</i>

374
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,805
Could you show me
where it is?

375
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,771
Oh, yes.
Please follow me.

376
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,126
Why am I whispering?

377
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,050
<i>Oh, that's great!
lust great.</i>

378
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,322
Oh, that used
to be the bathroom...

379
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,483
before
the renovations.

380
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,767
Ikeep
forgetting.

381
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,882
This was the broom closet,
but we made it into the bedroom.

382
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,725
And this door
is the bathroom.

383
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,484
Voilà.

384
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,448
Merd e.

385
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,848
Let him move
into my apartment?

386
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,002
I can't believe
you're saying this.

387
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,210
Frankly, I think you have
your priorities all wrong.

388
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,886
<i>You married a man you didn't know
in order to get a greenhouse.</i>

389
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,008
That shocked me.

390
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,481
So I'm old-fashioned
when it comes to marriage.

391
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,325
I think that falling in love
has something to do with it.

392
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,050
You don't?
Fine.

393
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,248
If marrying a stranger
doesn't shock you,

394
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,971
<i>then letting him move in
and sleep on the sofa...</i>

395
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,281
<i>- shouldn't 'z' shock you either'.
- This</i> isn't happening.

396
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,489
They want a second
interview on Monday.

397
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,291
That gives you the weekend to
get your stories straight.

398
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,603
Move in? Can't he
meet me in the park?

399
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,081
This interviews
going to be in depth.

400
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,003
They're gonna question
you separately.

401
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,084
They want to know the colour
of each other's toothbrush.

402
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,447
What's he like to eat?
Does he snore?

403
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,410
You're gonna have to study
each other's habits.

404
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,608
- It's like you're cramming for an exam.
- Oh, God!

405
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,523
- Do I have no alternative?
- Sure.

406
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,365
You can confess now,
he'll be deported,

407
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,923
- you could face charges, and no more
greenhouse. - It's like a police state.

408
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,890
No, it's called
breaking the law.

409
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,486
No matter how trivial
it may have seemed to you,

410
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,847
that's what
you've done.

411
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,130
- You should introduce Georges
to your friends. - My friends?

412
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,043
Let him get
to know them.

413
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,363
- Say he's visiting from Paris.
- I c0uldn't bear that.

414

He's such a slob. <i>I'll</i> do it

- Bronte, please? - Go or I'll
call the police or Immigration.

1224

Always forgetting.

You should have gone
to a hotel, dear!

1241

The board wouldrft
approve of such a thing!

Sleeping in the hallways.
This isn't Africa.

<i>Mrs Bird!</i>

Why did you do that
last night?

1246

- I don't like vegetarians.
- Don't be ridiculous!

1247
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,169
- The way he was bothering you, I
lost control. - Is that an apology?

1248
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,083
- He's not right for you.
- Really?

1249
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,367
He knows more about feelings
than you'll ever know.

1250
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,329
You don't
have feelings!

1251
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,607
- You snore and your manners are atrocious.
- You're a snob!

1252
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,682
You're a slob, overweight,
and disgusting!

1253
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,127
You say you're a rebel, but
you're afraid of your father.

1254
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,089
My father's made
something of his life.

1255
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,128
You live your life
like you got it from a book.

1256
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,680
- You're 40 and sleep in the park.
-And Phil?

1257
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,001
You make a nice love,
like vegetables.

1258
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,289
- You need a fuck. - That's the language
of the gutter where you came from.

1259
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,569
I am the gutter, yes.
But you're like a plant.

Sss!

1261
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,166
I had no opinion of you,
but now I do.

- I really hate you!
- Good, your first feeling.

<i>Oh, God,

<i>[ Bronte] Come on,

You can take the subway,
but you ain't going nowhere.

1270

- The water main broke.
- The park!

falling apart!

<i>[ Bronte 1 We'll get a

- You're sure, huh?
- Yes.

1278
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,523
- Because we can't get lost.
- Of course, I'm sure.

- To the right.
- Where?

1280
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,843
Right.

Come on, come on.
Run for it. Take care.

Your answers will help us

I want you to be brief
and to the point.

1306

I ask you to raise
your right hand.

1307
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,370
Do you swear that the evidence
you're about to give...

1308
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,761

and nothing but the truth?

<i>I do.</i>

- Your name is Bronte Mitchell Faure?

01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,482
Her father
is a writer.

1312
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,801
- His name?
- Sydney, Sydney Parrish.

1313
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,201
He didn't have
a formal education.

1314
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,601
He ran away from home
when he was 12.

1315
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,251
Plants. She loves
all flowers and weeds.

1316
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,163
That's her research.

1317
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,208
He knows
I love salads.

1318
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,363
He likes all fatty
foods, being French.

1319
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,807

01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,320
He's composing.

He hasn't written
in a longtime.

1326
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,730
He says
he's not sensitive,

1327

but that's
not true.

1328

Me, I don't think
that way.

1333
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:26,404
I don't trust people.

1334
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,323
He's had a hard life.

1335
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,880
In a way,
he hasn't learned to give.

1336
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,849
But he's got
so much to give.

1337
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,890
She has peace.

01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,888
I don't have peace.
