and I cut her head off.

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,280
But you hate holidays.

139
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,489
You'll spend your whole time in
your room practicing card tricks,

140
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,602
and you'll never
see the big turtles.

141

And besides, you've always
loved the south of France,

142
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,206
and you could visit
your Aunt Vanessa.

143

But if this woman knows she's being
watched by the great Wei Ling Soo,

she'll make some excuse
not to perform.

resistance in the room...

146

She'll never know
you're Wei Ling Soo.

No one knows who you are
under all that chinoiserie.

as anyone you like.

Well, if she's fooled you,
she must be very good.

But she won't fool me.

gimmickry she's employing,

152

it back in her face.

Don't get angry with me, Olivia.
It won't be for long.

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,766
Oh, okay, go.

158
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,888
You've always had
the measure of me, Olivia.

159
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,122
Ever since our
very first dinner,

160
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,601
when I made your ruby ring
disappear from your finger,

161
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,604
and reappear in
your soft-boiled egg.

162
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,160
(CHUCKLES) If you recall, I quickly
figured out how you did it.

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,884
Yes, you were
very impressive.

164
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,770
Oh, it was simply a matter
of logic and common sense.

165
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,765
I mean, you palmed the ring and
distracted me by spilling the salt.

166
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,684
I believe it was my clear thinking
that attracted you to me.

167
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,808
Yes, your logic and
common sense equal mine,

168
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,247
but you have the added
quality of being beautiful.

169
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,322
Mmm, you've said it
several times, Stanley.

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,368
We're a match
made in heaven.

171
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,931
(♪♪♪)

172
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,801
VANESSA: What a
serendipitous pleasure

173
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,006
to be surprised by my favorite
nephew and Howard Burkan!

174
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,286
Little Howard.

175
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,483
Uh, "Burkan the Great," if you please.
Of course.

176
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,643
Of all my nephews and nieces,
you're the only one, Stanley,

177
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,688
who isn't boring to
the point of perfection.

178
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,728
Oh, I couldn't
agree more.

179
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,007
If only you had a slightly
milder disposition,

180
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,684
you might
actually have friends.

181
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,161
Oh, l am his friend.
Notice I use the singular.

182
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,810
Yes, he means
he can tolerate me.

183
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,803
You may be Burkan the
Great to your public,

184
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,963
but to me, you'll always
be little Howard Burkan,

185
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,840
who took my favorite scarf, cut it
in half with a pair of scissors,

186
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,048
waved his magic wand
over it,

187
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,122
and it didn't
come back together.

188
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,690
I was just
learning the trick.

189
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,205
No, she never got over that.

190
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,681
And to what do I owe
this unannounced visit?

191
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,690
I'm here to expose yet another
fraudulent spiritualist,

192
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,201
and I thought I'd warn you
I'll be dropping by
for black pudding.

193
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,001
Oh, yes, the Catledges are holding
séances up at their place.

194
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,367
They've apparently
met some gifted medium.

195
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,726
It's the talk of
the Côte d'Azur.

196
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,962
She's a little American
called Sophie Baker,

197
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,405
and apparently
she's very sharp,

198
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,891
but Stanley will get
the measure of her.

199
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,530
I can't wait.

200
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,125
(♪♪♪)

201
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,890
Welcome!
Welcome...

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,650
How lovely to see you.
Bienvenue.

203
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,127
George, Caroline, Stanley.
How do you do?

204
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,440
GEORGE: Oh, hello.
Stanley.

205
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,567
(SIGHS)
A great pleasure.

206
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,687
George.
Charmed.

207
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,326
Of course, George and Caroline
are the reason I'm here.

208
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,402
They're a great deal
less gullible

209
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,925
Than Caroline's
mother and brother,

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,570
and had hoped
that I would be able

211
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,364
to reveal
the medium as a fraud.

212
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,726
When she fooled
Howard Burkan,

213
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,131
we knew
we were in trouble.

214
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,491
But then when he said he
was best friends (SIGHS)

215
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,607
with Wei Ling Soo...

216
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,251
We're great admirers. Who isn't?
(CHUCKLES)

217
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,244
I don't know if Howard told
you, her name is Sophie Baker.

218
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,600
Have you heard of her or...

219
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,446
No, I have not, but these sleazy
fraudsters change identity every month.

220
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,763
And I omitted to mention
she's here with her mother.

221
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,683
Ah, now, that says a lot.
Yeah.

222
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,127
I hope you kept your eyes on
her mother during the seance,

223
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,964
or did she dim
the lights too low?

224
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,280
Caroline,
you were next to her.

225
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,523
She held my brother's hand, and
she actually made the table rise.

226
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,523
Well, I looked for the
usual devices, of course.

227
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,171
I thought maybe, wrist lifts,
but they weren't there.

228
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,005
She's promised to try and
make contact with my father,

229
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,206
who died a year ago.

230
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,123
As I was saying,
your mother and your brother

231
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,248
are the victims
of a dishonest ruse,

232
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,004
as your good sense
tells you.

233
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,480
There is, of course, no spirit
world, and even if there were,

234
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,603
you can be sure that some little American
gypsy would not be the one blessed

235
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,484
to unlock its secrets.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

236
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,767
Only a low-grade halfwit
would fall for any of this.

237
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,242
But you're not implying that her
mother and brother are halfwits?

238
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,765
Well, l haven't
met them yet.

239
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,251
But I'm sure
they're like most people,

240
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,448
desperate for a little hope
in a world that has none,

241
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,965
and willing to
believe anything.

242
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,923
Who shall we say
you are?

243
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,408
Introduce me
as Stanley Taplinger.

244
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,528
I'm an old friend
in the import-export business.

245
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,648
Understood. Mr. Taplinger,
up to the house.

246
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,007
Come on, Howard.
(MAN SINGING IN DISTANCE)

247
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,969
STANLEY: What is that
dreadful noise?

248
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,681
My brother. He practices
serenading Sophie.

249
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,161
<i>♪ Both thine
eyes are cute, too</i>

250
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,811
<i>♪ What they do to me</i>

251
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,611
<i>♪ Hear me holler</i>

<i>♪ Thou sweet,

255
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,681
Howard.

256
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,000
HOWARD: Brice,
good to see you again.

257
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,560
Can I introduce you to my
friend Stanley Taplinger,

258
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,880
who's going to be staying. Oh.

259
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,127
Pleasure to meet you. How do you do, Mr.
Taplinger...

260
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,247
Taplinger... Taplinger.
Taplinger.

261
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,520
And, uh, how long will you be
staying with us, Mister...

262
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,608
Oh, not very.
I have business elsewhere.

263
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,284
Ah, have you told him
about Sophie?

264
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,806
Ah, now, is this the girl
that can read minds and such?

265
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,129
Well, she gets these sensory impressions.
And, what are they?

266
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,602
It's hard to explain. She
gets these mental vibrations.

267
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,921
Her head vibrates?

268
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,604
Drink?
Thank you.

269
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,648
Have you got a whiskey, Brice?
I absolutely do.

270
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,687
Now, Sophie looked
into my eyes

271
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,366
and told me things about me
she could never have known.

272
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,568
About old girlfriends
I'd had,

273
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,005
and places
I've traveled to.

274
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,650
Good heavens. You think
she can do it with me?

275
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,802
Oh, of course. Of course.

276
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,044
Whatever questions you have
about life, the hereafter...

277
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,406
Here, cheers.

278
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,608
Perhaps there's
a departed loved one

279
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,091
you wish
to make contact with.

280
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,321
Sophie sees all.

281
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,164
She can predict the future.
In short, she's a visionary.

282
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,561
And, I'm told she's very
pleasant to look at.

283
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,483
She's a visionary and a vision.
(CHUCKLES)

284
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,847
Mother's agreed
to subsidize a foundation

285
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,241
for the serious scientific
study of her work.

286
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,085
Well, after this buildup, I'm
champing at the bit to meet her.

287
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,242
She's doing some psychic readings
over at the Lounsberrys' house,

288
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,765
but she should be here
any minute.

289
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,490
And the Lounsberrys, I take
it, are wealthy marks...

290
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,085
Uh, wealthy friends
of yours

291
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,889
that she was anxious
to meet?

292
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,406
Yes. How did you know?

293
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,329
Mental vibrations.

294
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,324
Excuse me? Telephone call, Mr.
Catledge.

295
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,641
Your business office
in Paris.

296
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,529
Ah, excuse me.

297
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,291
He doesn't make any business
decision at all now

298
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,283
without consulting
Sophie first.

299
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,771
Well, what can
I say, Howard?

300
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,881
He's a moron.

301
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,803
Incidentally, Stanley,

302
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,407
I think, if you could bottle up your
sarcasm a little more skillfully,

303
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,845
it might help us
on our mission.

304
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,491
Howard, we all hope someone will
come along with superpowers,

305
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,889
but the only superpower certain
to show up wears a black robe.

306
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,485
Mmm.

307
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,770
Speak of the devil and superpowers,
I think that's her now.

308
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,968
Yeah, there she is.

309
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,371
(♪♪♪)

310
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,891
HOWARD: Mr. Talmudge.
Hello.

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,126
STANLEY: Taplinger.
Hello.

312
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,486
HOWARD: Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes.

313
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,642
You're every bit as lovely
as you've been described.

314
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,245
Thank you.

315
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,810
Wait.

316
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,406
Don't say anything. I'm
getting a mental impression.

317
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,885
Are you from the Orient?

318
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,325
The Far East?

319
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,369
China?

320
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,286
Have you been there,
or do you visit?

321
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,362
Why do you say China?

322
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,491
I just get that impression.

323
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,451
And what impression
is that?

324
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,127
No.

325
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,881
(EXHALES) Huh.

326
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,968
Never mind.
It's fading, it's fading.

327
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,964
And you are her sister?

328
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,446
Mother.

329
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,681
STANLEY:
Mother, are you?

330
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,363
What lovely cheek bones. The apple
does not fall far from the tree.

331
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,448
And what do you do,
Mr. Taplinger?

332
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,005
I'm...
Wait.

333
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,890
Sophie, what impression
do you have

334
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,725
of Mr. Taplinger's
line of work?

335
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,290
I should say Sophie
has psychic gifts.

336
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,562
STANLEY: Has she?
Hmm.

337
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,727
It's not immediately clear,
although l...

338
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,929
I do get some
vibrations suggesting

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,163
that Mr. Taplinger
travels a lot.

340
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,090
Well, those are
excellent vibrations,

341
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,889
but it's not an unreasonable
assumption, is it?

342
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,889
I mean, plenty of people
travel in their work.

343
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,483
I see Germany.
Have you been to Germany?

344
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,450
Matter of fact, I did have some
business recently in Berlin.

345
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,761
I'd say, that's
pretty damn impressive.

346
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,322
Mr. Burkan, as you
may know, is a magician,

347
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,882
who was brought here to observe
my daughter and find flaws,

348
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,042
but has stayed
to marvel at her.

349
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,043
Well, what have
I stumbled upon?

350
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,088
You never told us what you did, Mr.
Taplinger.

351
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,889
Neither did your daughter.

352
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,684
For some reason, my mental
impressions are cloudy.

353
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,568
Cloudy. When you say your
mental impressions are cloudy,

354
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,723
are they cumulus clouds
or cirrus?

355
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,451
Mr. Taplinger is a businessman.
MRS. BAKER: Ah.

356
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,010
What line of business?

357
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,844
The import-export trade.

358
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,570
I see Chinese letters.

359
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,325
Chinese writing.

360
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,768
Perhaps, you're visualizing
my laundry ticket.

361
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,445
You're making fun of me.

362
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,289
I'm afraid you're in the
wrong part of the world.

363
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,007
I import coffee beans
and cocoa from Brazil.

364
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,410
Wow! Well, I didn't...
Really?

365
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,528
MRS. BAKER: I think it's
time we moved along.

366
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,523
Sophie's had
a strenuous afternoon.

367
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,650
It is rather exhausting communicating
with the unseen world.

368
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,327
Well, I'm sure Mr. Taplinger doesn't
believe in the unseen world.

369
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,164
On the contrary, I always
thought the unseen world

370
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,129
was a good place
to open a restaurant.

371
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,523
Time to go, Sophie.

372
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,569
The spirits have
to eat somewhere.

373
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,241
Mr. Taplinger
is rather obnoxious.

374
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,450
Obnoxious, but he's not
entirely unappealing.

375
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,046
Congratulations, Stanley,

376
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,761
you've managed to alienate the entire
household in a single afternoon.

377
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,683
Oh, she's nothing
I haven't seen before.

378
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,161
Pretty young thing with a stage
mother who handles the promotion,

379
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,931
and who knows what else when the
lights are out at the seance.

380
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,571
I want you
to see her working.

381
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,530
More importantly, I want to be
there when you expose them.

382
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,320
Well, I mean, she's not
even a good actress.

383
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,922
"I... I get the impression
of the Orient. China."

384
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,570
What utter bilge.

385
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,722
HOWARD: Well, I thought
that was quite good,

386
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,683
considering you
are Wei Ling Soo

387
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,529
and you have just
been to Germany.

388
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,364
Yes, it's all
very tantalizing.

389
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,249
Oh, careful,
she's tricky.

390
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,926
And yet,
she's a fraud, Howard.

391
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,570
Because there is
no sixth sense.

392
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,642
There are five senses,
and no spirit world.

393
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,563
But there are coincidences.

394
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,210
Maybe she's made
some lucky guesses,

395
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,648
but we have to be careful not to
build them into something more.

396
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,563
Your daughter is going
to try to make contact

397
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,689
with my dear
departed Harry tonight.

398
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,723
Well, she's been waiting for
the right moment. Uh-huh.

399
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,451
Sophie needs
the proper vibrations.

400
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,560
Now, of course, we need to
purchase or build an establishment

401
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,411
suitable for the operation of
our foundation. Of course.

402
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,006
There will be various
assorted costs,

403
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,402
and naturally, all the
students will pay a fee.

404
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,087
And, I assume, profits will
go into psychic research?

405
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,363
Oh, most of them, uh...

406
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,445
Minus operating
expenses and sundries.

407
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,490
You can count
on my support.

408
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,764
I've always known
there had to be

409
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,842
more to this life
than meets the eye.

410
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,686
How could it be that what we see
is all there is to everything?

411
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,491
And, that's such
a bleak thought.

412
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,201
Why would God
go to so much trouble

413
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,248
if everything
comes to nothing?

414
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,447
Hmm.

415
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,761
Well, Sophie is...

416
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,011
Sophie is living proof that the
world is alive with hidden things.

417
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,562
She's such
an uplifting creature.

418
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,526
No wonder my son, Brice,
is so smitten with her.

You know that
I'm in love with you?

435
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,491
You mustn't give your
heart away so quickly.

436
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,046
You looked into my eyes,
and without even knowing me,

437
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,088
you knew me better
than I know myself.

438
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,970
You knew my dreams
and my ambitions.

439
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,247
Please, don't tell me you're
in love with someone else.

440
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,369
Oh, no, no, of course not.

441
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,205
I never had time
to fall in love.

442
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,365
Mother and I were always
traveling, you know?

443
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,841
Unlike you, we're members
of the working class.

444
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,530
That's over.

445
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,127
I'm gonna take care of you and pamper
you for the rest of your life.

446
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,884
Do you like to travel?

447
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,724
I mean, on yachts?

448
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,647
Do you like to go to parties and buy
jewels and clothes and go dancing?

449
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,609
I'm a very good dancer.

450
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,686
I'm sure I could get used
to yachts and jewels.

451
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,802
GEORGE: I had an interesting chat with Mr.
Taplinger, as he's called.

452
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,160
You did?

453
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,564
Yeah, I'd say he has a classic
neurotic personality disorder.

454
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,247
Yeah, brilliant parents
who didn't get along,

455
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,291
closer to his aunt than his
mother, obsessed with mortality,

456
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,604
believes in nothing, finds
life to have no meaning.

457
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,605
Just a perfect depressive, with
everything sublimated into his art,

458
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,445
and he is quite an artist.

459
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,921
Oh, he began as
an escape artist.

460
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,925
Interesting choice if anyone ever
wanted to escape from reality.

461
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,607
But, like Freud,
he will not permit himself

462
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,251
to be seduced
by childish thoughts

463
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,766
just because
they're more comforting.

464
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,730
Very unhappy man.

465
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,250
I like him.

466
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,530
(♪♪♪)

467
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,402
Ah, Miss Baker.
Hello.

468
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,204
Rested, I presume?

469
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,965
Uh, yes, I had a bath.
I had a little nap.

470
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,520
And now,
you're refreshed.

471
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,491
Well, no, not entirely.
I had an unpleasant dream.

472
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,881
I've had my share.

473
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,170
I dreamt I was being followed
by a sinister Chinese.

474
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,447
You have the Far East
on the brain.

475
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,040
What do you think it means?
I don't know.

476
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,164
Good evening.

477
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,402
I understand you're
holding a séance tonight.

478
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,403
She's been waiting
for the right moment,

479
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,882
and now, she says, "The
planets are in alignment."

480
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,162
And what do they have to
be in alignment with?

481
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,765
Your vertebrae?

482
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,084
Can you do the séance if someone
in the room is a non-believer?

483
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,324
And when you
contact the spirits,

484
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,171
will we be able
to see the souls?

485
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,527
And how are they
different from ghosts?

486
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,761
Or are they ghosts?

487
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,241
I should think souls
are quite different.

488
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,408
Have you ever heard of ectoplasm?
Ectoplasm?

489
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,926
Now, isn't that a milky
substance rather like yogurt?

490
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,048
Oh, you are a joker,
aren't you?

491
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,724
So, you're saying it
might look like yogurt,

492
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,406
but it will be Mrs.
Catledge's former husband.

493
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,570
(BELL RINGING)
MRS. BAKER: Dinner.

494
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,881
MRS. BAKER: Sophie, come to dinner.
Mmm.

495
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,691
Isn't the light perfect,
Mother?

496
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,361
Really, what exactly
happens at a séance?

497
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,283
You know, I don't
believe you're so naive

498
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,169
as you make out
about the occult.

499
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,811
I will admit, my Uncle Charles
once attended a séance

500
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,247
where the medium made a lot
of amazing things happen,

501
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,561
and weeks later, she was
unmasked and sent to prison,

502
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,723
for defrauding people out of
substantial sums of money.

503
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,441
Charles. Uncle Charles.

504
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,361
Death by water.

505
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,488
What did you say?

506
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,850
What? Oh, I was just...

507
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,326
I was receiving some mental impressions.
Excuse me.

508
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,963
Come, Stanley, let's go to...
You look stunned.

509
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,930
I had an uncle who
drowned many years ago.

510
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,047
And when I mentioned him,

511
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,043
she lapsed into
a kind of fugue state

512
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,566
and muttered
"Death by water."

513
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,246
Well, she knew
that my sister married

514
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,688
on March the seventh
to a bank manager.

515
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,001
There's absolutely no way
she could know that unless...

516
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,401
Oh, not you, too,
Howard! No!

517
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,201
I'll make short work of her
tonight during the séance.

518
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,561
I would like us
now to join hands,

519
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,403
as we summon

520
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,081
the unseen world.

521
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,728
Now, we're here tonight
to contact the soul

522
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,322
of the departed husband
of Grace Catledge,

523
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,245
father of Brice
and Caroline.

524
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,045
Now, I will try to achieve

525
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,046
a trance state.

526
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,610
I'm falling deeper,

527
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,645
and deeper,

528
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,686
into a trance.

529
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,286
Harry Catledge,
give me a sign.

530
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,726
Give us a sign!

531
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,287
(THUMP)

532
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,930
(GASPING)

533
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,843
GRACE: Harry?

534
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,406
Is that you, Harry?

535
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,849
SOPHIE: Spirit?

536
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,884
Signal us once for "Yes."

537
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,968
Twice for "No."

538
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,765
GRACE:
Harry, are you okay?

539
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,761
Are you happy?

540
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,121
(THUMPS ONCE)

541
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,201
Ah!

542
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,569
Spirit,
if you can hear me,

543
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,211
give me a sign.

544
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,651
(ALL GASPING)

545
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,007
That's not possible.

546
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,726
I mean, damn it, Stanley,
we've both done levitations.

547
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,600
I once raised a real tiger,
but we both have our tricks.

548
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,321
There was nothing supporting this
candle, no threads, no wires,

549
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,609
it was floating
until I brought it down.

550
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,886
Um...

551
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,766
(STAMMERING) I... I was just telling Mr.
Pepperidge here

552
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,085
how marvelously you made that candle
float with no apparent support.

553
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,766
"Apparent,"
I think, is the key word.

554
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,482
Is it "Pepperidge," or
"Talmudge," or "Taplinger?"

555
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,764
Anyway, it was a wonderful,
wonderful, super trick.

556
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,687
I mean, I grabbed the candle and found
absolutely nothing supporting it.

557
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,967
That's because
there's nothing to find.

558
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,886
My daughter is not some
commercial music hall attraction.

559
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,009
She doesn't do tricks.
She is an adept.

560
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,761
I hope I didn't disappoint
you at your first séance.

561
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,843
Oh, I found it
nothing short of perfection.

562
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,285
Well done, madam.

563
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,522
I can't even remember the last
time I've seen Mother so happy.

564
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,681
Will you join us?

565
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,410
We're all going to hear
some really hot music.

566
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,561
Hot music?

567
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,926
Come on, Sophie, come on.
Yeah, we...

568
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,446
I thought you said "All this
mental work was exhausting?"

569
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,285
Oh, it is,
but I love hot music.

570
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,249
Mmm. Well, I hope you're
not plagued tonight

571
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,324
by the dream of
the sinister Chinese.

572
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,483
You know, I figured out
who you represented.

573
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,483
Really?
Yes.

574
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,528
When I was much younger,
years ago,

575
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,570
I went and saw Wei Ling Soo.

576
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,766
Have you heard of him?

577
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,401
He's a Caucasian who disguised
himself as a Chinese,

578
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,484
and he billed himself as
the Great Oriental Wizard.

579
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,370
I see, and did you
enjoy his performance?

580
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,125
I did, very much.
He was brilliant.

581
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,283
He, um, he vanished
a live elephant.

582
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,441
And it was just...

583
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,330
I mean, it just was
completely shocking,

584
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,641
but of course,
it was mechanical tricks

585
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,285
that one could learn
with enough practice.

586
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,601
I see.
And, your performance?

587
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,160
Oh, I wouldn't call
it a performance.

588
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,531
Well, call it
what you will.

589
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,085
I mean,
it's a type of trickery,

590
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,004
like card magic or
vanishing an elephant.

591
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,290
And I say
you're Mr. Wei Ling Soo.

592
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,605
And I say there is nothing you
can do that I cannot duplicate.

593
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,167
Oh, I don't doubt it.
You're great.

594
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,648
But just because you can
duplicate my miracles,

595
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,520
in no way proves
that mine are not real.

596
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,250
(♪♪♪)

597
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,211
It was quite a display.

598
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,248
(CHUCKLES) I must say,
she impresses me.

599
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,800
CAROLINE: And you saw
no signs of trickery?

600
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,166
Not yet.

601
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,364
Well, let's face it, Stanley,
you came to unmask her,

602
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,608
and she's unmasked you.

603
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,520
On the one side, yes, she's pulling
off these bewildering feats,

604
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,443
and on the other
remains the simple fact

605
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,284
that what
she's claiming to do,

606
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,251
while exquisitely executed,
is simply not possible.

607
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,402
But who's to say
what's possible?

608
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,404
I'm a physician, and new
facts come to light,

609
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,642
new discoveries are
made all the time.

610
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,530
Things we never
dreamed possible.

611
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,364
To cure someone
of blindness

612
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,124
by having her
lie on a couch

613
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,565
and talk about
her childhood.

614
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,051
(CHUCKLES) I mean,
who'd have thought?

615
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,169
Yeah, but don't you see it challenges
our whole concept of reality?

616
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,846
I mean, if there's
an unseen world,

617
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,440
an afterlife,
souls to contact,

618
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,289
mind reading,
foretelling the future...

619
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,603
Yes, it changes everything we've
held to be scientifically accurate.

620
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
CAROLINE: It's true.

621
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,609
If what she claims
was possible,

622
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,411
everything would
surely take on new meaning.

623
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,484
And yes,
very hopeful meaning.

624
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,006
To think, if there
were more to life...

625
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,764
(SHOUTS)
More what?

626
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,683
That life
doesn't end with death?

627
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,489
That the universe
works by design?

628
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,130
That God exists.

629
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,602
All right,
let's not get carried away.

630
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,842
The woman is a charlatan.

631
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,446
Because, depressing as the
facts of existence are,

632
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,887
they are the facts.

633
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,883
There is no
metaphysical world.

634
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,442
What you see out there
is what you get.

635
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,366
I think Mr. Nietzsche has disposed of
the God matter rather convincingly.

638
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,845
Good morning.
Mmm.

639
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,524
May I?
Mmm-hmm.

640
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,921
Did you sleep well,
Mr. Taplinger?

641
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,163
Or should I just call you
by your Chinese name?

642
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,846
You are a very clever
little humbug, Miss Baker.

643
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,047
(SIGHS)

644
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,690
What are you
doing today?

645
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,724
I'm going
bird-watching with Brice.

646
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,006
Do you want to join us?

647
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,730
I can't think of
a more inane activity,

648
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,723
watching little
winged creatures

649
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,962
acting out nature's
pointless busywork.

650
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,207
Why don't you
join me instead?

651
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,731
Where?

652
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,962
I'm driving to Provence
to visit my Aunt Vanessa.

653
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,248
She's a remarkable woman.

654
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,290
We could have lunch. Chat?

655
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,488
Actually, get to know
one another better.

656
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,851
You think you'll trick me into
showing you how I deceive people.

657
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,326
Come on.

658
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,925
I'm sure Brice Catledge
can live

659
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,163
without drooling all over
you for a few hours.

660
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,803
(SIGHS)

661
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,762
I think I'd like
to visit Provence.
I've never been there.

662
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,683
(♪♪♪)

663
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,844
Tell me, doesn't it ever
trouble your conscience

664
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,003
to fool that poor,
empty-headed Mrs. Catledge

665
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,522
into believing
she's communicating
with her departed spouse?

666
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,723
I could just as
easily ask you,

667
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,689
doesn't it ever bother you
to creep around,

668
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,047
dashing people's
dreams and hopes?

669
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,281
Not if their hopes
are false.

670
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,771
Even if their hopes
are false,

671
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,285
if it helps them
get through life?

672
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,771
Then you admit
you're a fraud?

673
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,365
I wonder if you get your
cynicism from your grandfather,

674
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,490
the merchant seaman
with the missing finger.

675
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,044
The missing toe.

676
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,128
Why are you staring at me?

677
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,404
Where are you from?

678
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,244
Kalamazoo.

679
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,165
It's in Michigan.

680
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,890
And, you're from London.

681
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,961

684
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,081
A piano.

685
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,084
Yes, that's all correct
and rather amazing.

686
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,165
But <i>I</i> don't buy it.

687
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,765
'Cause I'm a rational man

688
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,330
who believes in
a rational world.

689
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,602
Any other way, lies madness.

690
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,207
You'd be happier
if I was a fraud,

691
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,482
because then,
your whole fixed worldview

692
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,686
wouldn't be shaken up.

693
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,644
No, it's quite the opposite.

694
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,929
If you knew how much I don't
want you to be a fake...

695
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,442
Oh, but think how embarrassing
it would be for you.

696
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,321
Your whole life, you spent publicly
crusading against spiritualism,

697
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,564
and then, you'd have to come out
with it and say that you were wrong.

698
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,603
But I'm not wrong.

699
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,401
Is that why Jenny
dropped you?

700
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,046
How could you
know about Jenny?

701
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,164
I see long, blonde hair.

702
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,129
A wonderful laugh.

703
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,686
Yes, she had
a lovely laugh.

704
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,842
But who wants
a pessimistic bore

705
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,448
who hides in his room all day
and practices card tricks?

706
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,610
No, I'll tell you
who wants a man

707
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,569
who locks himself in his
room and practices all day,

708
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,926
who's a committed artist.

709
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,241
Olivia, my fiancée.

710
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,560
Mmm!

711
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,367
Yes.

712
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,725
Olivia. Hmm.

713
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,688
I see a match
made in heaven.

714
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,886
(♪♪♪)

715
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,211
How can you eat so much?
We just finished lunch.

716
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,647
I told you
I like to eat a lot.

717
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,007
George's psychoanalyst says
it's because I need love,

718
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,401
but to me, I'm just hungry.

719
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,682
Oh, I mean,
a lot of people need love,

720
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,565
but they don't
eat their way to it.

721
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,763
You want some?
No, thank you.

722
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,888
This is so beautiful.

723
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,724
It's transient.

724
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,848
Oh, Stanley, how nice
of you to drop by.

725
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,969
And you, I take it,
must be Olivia.

726
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,800
Olivia? No, no.

727
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,770
Olivia is a brunette.

728
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,006
And she's a bit taller than
me, and she's in London,

729
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,009
anxious to get
on with her trip,

730
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,082
so, she can get to
work on her book.

731
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,446
I'm Sophie.

732
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,363
Oh, you must be
the American

733
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,090
the Catledges
say is so amazing.

734
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,323
Sophie fancies herself a
telepathic, among other things,

735
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,767
so, be careful what you
think, Aunt Vanessa.

736
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,081
We all know the evil
workings of your mind.

737
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,322
Stanley doesn't
believe in spiritualists.

738
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,482
He thinks
you're all scoundrels.

739
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,360
If so, you're a very
pretty little scoundrel.

740
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,482
If you see all
and know all,

741
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,244
where's my aunt
just been?

742
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,206
Somewhere for her health.

743
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,884
I see baths.

744
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,851
Is it sciatica
or rheumatism?

745
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,766
It's sciatica, and that
is quite remarkable.

746
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,684
How can you know that I've just
come back from a spa in Italy?

747
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,001
However she knows, it's not
through mystical vibrations,

748
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,081
I can assure you.

749
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,121
Oh, he's always been so militantly
scientific, even at six years old.

750
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,885
One of the most kind
and gentle local priests

751
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,486
said that Stanley was the only
child in the neighborhood

752
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,886
destined for Hell.

753
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,405
And why do you
still trek to Italy,

754
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,721
to pay good money to bathe
in plain spring water

755
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,689
that is not
a drop more medicinal

756
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,569
than the water that
flows from your own tub?

757
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,325
I'm not going to get into that
debate with you, Stanley.

758
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,845
It brings out
the beast in you.

759
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,526
And I see you still
buy this stupid nostrum.

760
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,568
It's a health mixture.

761
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,450
Sulfur, molasses
and barley extract.

762
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,727
STANLEY: It's disgusting
and is of no proven value.

763
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,882
Perhaps if I needed
an emetic.

764
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,128
Am I the only sane person
left on this planet?

765
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,249
I love him, but he was always
an incorrigible child.

766
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,526
Can I give you something?

767
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
No, thank you. Just a little
wine, if you have any.

768
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,846
We've just eaten.

769
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,081
Oh, are those
little cakes?

770
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,766
Good heavens, are you seriously
going to have more food?

771
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,966
They're delicious.

772
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,087
Unbelievable!

773
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,209
Now, tell me something about my
Aunt Vanessa's colorful past.

774
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,964
Oh, leave her alone,
Stanley.

775
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,963
She's not
a performing monkey.

776
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,281
Do you have a telephone
I could use?

777
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,165
I'm sorry, it's 3:00, and I was
supposed to meet Brice for drinks,

778
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,366
but I'm never
gonna make it.

779
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,330
Brice Catledge is the young
milksop who's smitten with her,

780
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,482
and ready to lay his
family fortune at her feet

781
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,289
to subsidize
her chicanery.

782
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,328
Can you believe it?
He serenades her.

783
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,765
Well, it sounds
rather romantic to me,

784
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,922
but you wouldn't know
about such things, Stanley.

785
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,008
It would mean
joining the human race.

786
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,084
Here, it's in the study.
Thank you.

787
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,764
Why do you badger her?

788
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,850
She's quite likable,
even if she is a fraud.

789
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,969
You know, one of the
cardinal rules of magic,

790
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,247
is that the magician
must never repeat his trick,

791
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,800
because sooner or later, one
begins to notice the move,

792
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,201
and he's caught.

793
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,891
But the more I watch her... Yes?

794
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,042
The more I'm stumped.

795
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,762
Could she be real?

796
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,160
(QUIET LAUGH)

797
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,322
I'm beginning to question
my own common sense.

798
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,801
I've always questioned
your common sense.

799
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,168
You've always been so certain
about the world, Stanley.

800
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,005
And I've always tried to teach
you that we don't know.

801
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,367
We really don't know.

802
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,206
We're just poor,
limited human beings.

803
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,964
The goldfish
doesn't understand

804
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,610
who changes
the water in his bowl.

805
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,843
If only she was real,

806
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,251
it would lift
the dark cloud

807
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,446
that's followed me
since childhood.

808
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,723
Well, I'm sure your fiancée would
appreciate a sunnier bridegroom.

809
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,441
Olivia likes me as I am. Sophie
agrees we're a match made in heaven.

810
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,249
Has she met her?

811
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,802
No, but there,
she's guessing correctly.

812
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,644
I told Brice I'd be late.

813
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,530
I said I was just sitting down
for some of your blood pudding.

814
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,922
Tell me something
about my aunt.

815
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,802
Do you have
a, uh, handkerchief

816
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,366
or an article
of clothing,

817
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,442
or a piece of jewelry
I could use?

818
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,522
Oh, my pearls.

819
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,487
These are beautiful.

Mmm.

822
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,645
Yes.

823
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,921
Mmm.

824
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,961
I'm receiving a...

825
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,326
It's cloudy.

826
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,765
Cloudy...

827
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,367
Here comes the usual
theatrical fertilizer.

(STANLEY SIGHS)

829
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,165
I see an important Englishman.
(STANLEY SCOFFS)

830
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,484
Perhaps a member
of Parliament.

831
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,010
Go on.

832
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,806
A love affair.

833
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,040
STANLEY:
I don't believe this.

834
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,607
You cannot
possibly know this.

835
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,444
Something's wrong.

836
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,931
STANLEY: What?

837
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,445
He's married.

838
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,851
Aunt Vanessa?

839
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,126
I see a sequence
of trysts.

840
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,366
I've never
told her anything.

841
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,930
He cannot leave
his wife.

842
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,650
No, he did not.

843
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,563
And so,
you're heartbroken.

844
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,766
Sophie, you are a miracle.

845
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,365
And you vow
never to love again.

846
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,646
How does she do it?

847
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,007
You're never to marry.

848
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,242
This is beyond comprehension. I've
never known anything like it...

849
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,368
But this is a symbol.
This is...

850
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,723
The breakup.

851
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,283
He gave me those
on our last evening together.

852
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,164
Sophie.
I'm so sorry.

853
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,288
Sophie, is there
really a spirit world?

854
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,930
Do you really tune in
on it?

855
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,651
Is there more?
Have I not seen it?

856
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,370
Where have you
been all my life?

(♪♪♪)

858
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,566
When did you first realize you
had this extraordinary gift?

859
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,610
Oh, uh, very young.
My... My teens.

860
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,729
Well, and you saw it
as a way to make money?

861
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,282
Well, my father abandoned
us, and we were very poor.

862
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,691
Eh, but it's astounding.

863
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,604
I mean, I've always
believed that the dull,

864
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,490
tragic reality of life
is all there is,

865
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,164
but you are proof
that there's more.

866
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,844
More what?

867
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,005
More mystery, more magic.

868
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,206
(ENGINE GRINDING)

869
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,645
Oh, will you...
Oh.

870
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,006
Oh, dear.

871
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,889
Oh, boy.

872
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,644
You leave this to me.

873
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,529
I did get a little
anxious vibration

874
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,364
when the engine
started smoking back there.

875
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,091
Don't worry, I'm gonna
have a look at this.

876
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,931
I actually have an inkling
as to what this might be.

877
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,446
What are you gonna do?

878
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,682
Yes, not to worry.
I think it's the, um...

879
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,171
I'm actually...

880
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,369
I'm actually rather good at
dealing with anything mechanical.

881
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,761
I don't understand it!

882
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,370
I put the entire
engine back together,

883
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,930
and I still have
these two pieces.

884
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,401
This doesn't
make any sense.

885
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,925
If I can just get
these back into here...

886
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,331
You should hurry.
It's gonna rain.

887
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,811
Don't worry,
it's not going to rain.

888
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,325
No, I think I can
feel it already.

889
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,890
No, the skies
are clear...

890
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,291
We gotta put
the top up.

891
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,361
I have to be
able to do this...

892
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,367
We have to put the top up.

893
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,720
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
It's raining.

894
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,841
No, please just
give me a minute.

895
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,450
Stanley, come on... If I
can only put this in here.

896
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,767
We have to put the top up.
Come here! All right.

897
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,002
You can't put the top up
without taking this off.

898
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,366
What? How are you gonna
do it without the...

899
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,601
The canopy has to come off.
Okay, okay.

900
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,284
Okay, lift! Pull!

901
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,084
It's stuck, it's stuck!
All right.

902
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,924
No, don't do that. You'll
break it, you'll break it...

903
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,644
It's lightning, it's lightning.
We'll be killed.

904
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,569
There must be a catch somewhere.
What do we do?

905
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,926
Get under the car!

906
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,240
God, I don't want
to go under the car!

907
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,970
It's fine. It's on
four rubber wheels!

908
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,565
It can't get
struck by lightning!

909
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,290
Just go under there!
No!

910
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,006
Oh, we're gonna die!

911
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,162
Run! Run!
Run?

912
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,325
Stanley!

913
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,445
Come now, I've got you.

914
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,249
I've got you.
Okay.

915
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,651
Oh, my God.
Oh, God, we're gonna die.

916
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,404
I know this place!
What?

917
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,641
I can...
I know this place!

918
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,051
How?
We can go in there.

919
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,963
Let's run! Go!
Come on.

920
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,804
Will it be open?
Well, it'll be open!

921
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,690
It always
used to be open.

922
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,490
STANLEY: Goodness! I found
that rather exhilarating.

923
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,125
SOPHIE: Did you see that lightning?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

924
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,486
Goodness me.

925
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,880
I can't believe
I found this place.

926
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,411
What is this?
It's an observatory.

927
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,720
I came here as a boy.

928
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,166
Oh, thank God
we found it.

929
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,083
We just got a little wet.
It's water.

930
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,288
Are you kidding? We could've
been struck by lightning.

931
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,091
We could die of pneumonia.

932
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,810
I'm sure your fiancée
wouldn't be too pleased.

933
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,360
Well, this would never have
happened if Olivia was here.

934
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,805
Oh, no?

935
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,370
Um, she's, uh,
too competent.

936
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,050
She'd have fixed the car.

937
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,690
Is she also a mechanic?

938
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,127
Well, she's one of those people
who's good at everything.

939
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,326
How lucky for you.

940
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,845
Yes, yes.
That's...

941
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,649
I suppose so.

942
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,405
What are you staring at?

943
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,489
You have no idea how
miserable you look.

944
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,846
(CHUCKLES)

945
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,288
I'm freezing.
I mean, the...

946
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,567
Can you hold me,
or something?

947
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,290
I can offer you
my waistcoat.

948
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,805
No, you're wetter
than I am.

949
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,121
Just put an arm
around me, or you know...

950
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,282
Body heat, it's...

951
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,771

952
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,845
My aunt used to
bring me here as a boy.

953
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,365
The roof opens up.

954
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,005
Oh, really?

955
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,401
You can see the universe.

956
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,845
It's menacing.

957
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,331
Can you open it?

958
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,641
I hardly think that's the
brightest idea at the moment.

959
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,404
We just ran away from that.
It's still up there.

960
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,204
Oh, right, right.

961
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,611
Just have to wait it out.
Hmm.

962
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,051
What was so menacing
about the universe?

963
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,360
The size.

964
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,886
Of course,
I was much smaller, then.

965
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,881
Poor Howard's car.

966
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,968
Are you a little warmer now?
Mmm-hmm.

967
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,523
Tell me, with all your
powers of prognostication,

968
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,648
could you have
ever predicted,

969
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,563
when you first saw me
vanishing an elephant

970
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,449
onstage in my
Chinese ensemble,

971
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,602
that you and I
would one day

972
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,524
end up in a deserted
celestial observatory

973
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,450
in a rainstorm in
the south of France?

974
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,204
It's highly ironic.

975
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,169
It's morbid.

976
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,091
I feel sleepy. I'm going
to have a little nap.

977
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,481

979
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,281
The rain stopped.

980
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,200
SOPHIE: it stopped a while ago.
I didn't want to wake you.

981
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,926
You looked too
peaceful sleeping.

982
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,085
Yes, it's the first peaceful sleep
I've had in a very long time.

983
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,487
Does this thing
open the roof?

984
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,211
Yes, let me show you.

00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,930
I've never
forgotten this.

00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,046
No.

988
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,525

pretty romantic.

Well, you know
what my thoughts are?

1004

I've already told you
I want to marry you.

1005
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,770
That we'll get married at summer's
end at the Donaldsons' yacht.

1006
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,569
It's enormous,
and it can accommodate

1007
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,324
all the guests
we'd want to have.

1008
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,447
And then
after the wedding,

1009
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,488
we sail it,
with those who wish,

1010
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,210
from Monaco to Greece,

1011
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,123
and then we honeymoon
on the Greek Islands.

1012
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,202
What do you think?

1013
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,087
That's pretty swanky stuff
for a girl from Kalamazoo.

1014
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,764
And then
we'll live in Europe.

You'll run your foundation.
You'll be world-famous.

Then, I won't.

1030
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,404
I really didn't want to.

1031
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,369
It has such
sentimental meaning.

1032
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,363
I'm so glad you
said that, Harry.

1033
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,686
BRICE: Go on.

1034
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,081
Um...

1035
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,325
Harry, I hope this question
doesn't embarrass you,

1036
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,769
but I have to ask it.

1037
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,207
Were you always
faithful to me?

1038
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,641
(THUMPS ONCE)

1039
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,448
I knew it!

1040
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,569
Certain so-called friends of
mine suggested otherwise,

1041
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,167
that you had a long affair
with Sally Summers.

1042
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,291
(THUMPS TWICE)

1043
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,531
No, I really
didn't believe it.

1044
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,331
But I'm ashamed to admit,
I did wonder.

1045
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,448
Oh, Harry...

1046
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,366
I'm so relieved to know
that I was the only one.

1047
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,410
(STAMMERING)

1048
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,082
I... I was the only one,
wasn't I?

1049
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,200
(THUMPS ONCE)

1050
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,325
Oh!

1051
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,041
How wonderful
you make me feel.

1052
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,241
(CHUCKLES)

1053
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,806
SOPHIE: Well, look who's strolling
the grounds this morning!

1054
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,166
Why aren't you in
your room, practicing?

1055
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,242
I'm too excited
to lock myself away.

1056
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,481
What are you
and Brice up to?

1057
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,528
Brice is away for
the week, in Paris.

1058
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,807
Mother and I are going swimming.
Ah!

1059
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,002
I'm sure swimming isn't
your favorite pastime.

1060
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,162
Nonsense.
I accept your invitation.

1061
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,480
Just need to buy
a bathing suit,

1062
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,601
and I'll, uh, meet you
by the pool.

1063
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,966
We're not going
to the pool.

1064
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,445
We prefer to
swim off the rocks.

1065
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,329
The rocks? Even better.

1066
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,971
Live dangerously, I say.
You only live once.

1067
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,371
Or maybe two
or three times,

1068
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,841
depending on your
supply of ectoplasm.

1069
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,800
SOPHIE: You are a much
better swimmer

1070
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,120
than I would
have imagined.

1071
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,009
STANLEY: I'm also
a much better dancer.

1072
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,811
Really? You must take
me dancing sometime.

1073
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,166
Perhaps I shall,

1074
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,285
now that life is no longer weary,
stale, flat and unprofitable.

1075
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,124
Oh, that's from something.

1076
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,202
Is that Dickens?

1077
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,850
Oh, dear, poor thing.

1078
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,049
Madam, your wunderkind has
much catching up to do. Huh?

1079
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,326
Isn't that Dickens?

1080
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,811
That's Dickens.

1081
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,490
(♪♪♪)

1082
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,564
STANLEY: The Seventh is
actually one of my favorites

1083
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,766
of Beethoven's
symphonies,

1084
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,046
but if you
haven't heard them,

1085
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,407
the string
quartets are sublime.

1086
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,962
Especially the late ones,
the 15th and the 16th.

1087
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,691
Of course, they are rather
intellectually demanding,

1088
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,841
but that's the thing
about intelligence.

1089
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,445
You must never despair.

1090
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,329
Yours can be raised.

1091
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,926
You know,
it's extraordinary.

1092
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,243
I have smelled these
flowers 100 times,

1093
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,450
and yet I have never really
smelled them until now.

1094
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,244
What a pity.

1095
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,802
All the rest of the human
race that you consider boobs,

1096
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,087
smelling flowers
and you all left out.

1097
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,049
Now, wait. Yes.

1098
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,249
They... They've enjoyed,
but mindlessly,

1099
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,287
because they never thought.

1100
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,601
They never...
They never stopped

1101
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,321
for a moment to consider what a
rotten deal it all appears to be.

1102
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,449
To be born,
to have committed no crime,

1103
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,522
and yet to be
sentenced to death.

1104
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,601
Ah, but notice I say,
"Appears to be."

1105
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,721
Alvin, hello.
It's Stanley Crawford.

1106
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,404
Yes, Wei Ling Crawford.

1107
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,050
How are you?

1108
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,360
Good, splendid.

1109
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,001
Listen, Alvin, I have the story
of a lifetime for your paper

1110
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,686
and I wanted you
to have it first.

1111
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,240
No... Well, yes,
it is a...

1112
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,129
It's a theatrical piece,
but it's...

1113
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,083
It's much more
than that, much more.

1114
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,924
It's science, it's...

1115
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,129
It's philosophy,
it's religion.

1116
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,727
Brice is coming home
tonight from Paris.

1117
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,280
The week went so fast.

1118
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,284
Have you decided to accept
Brice's marriage proposal?

1119
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,160
Well...
(SIGHS)

1120
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,089
He is pushing me
very hard.

1121
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,322
Well, I'd grab it
if I were you.

1122
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,481
I mean, it'd be logical.

1123
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,641
An uneducated nobody

1124
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,529
from some
ridiculous-sounding city,

1125
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,850
gifted, miraculously, through
no achievement of your own,

1126
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,810
and now you've developed
a taste for high living...

1127
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,121
Yachts, motorcars.

1128
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,168
You know, Stanley,

1129
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,689
I'm not quite as desperate
as you make me out to be.

1130
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,810
There have actually
been a number of,

1131
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,690
I don't know, substantial men who
have fallen in love with me.

1132
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,205
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

1133
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,521
Hmm. Well, you could've
fooled me.

1134
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,364
Although,
with the ability you have,

1135
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,286
one does automatically
become intriguing...

1136
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,044
And you do have
agreeable features,

1137
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,964
but it's your gift,
I'm sure, which is...

1138
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,882
Well, l wouldn't say charming,
but it is impressive.

1139
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,802
I mean, even you just said
I have agreeable features.

1140
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,970
They're more
than agreeable.

1141
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,088
Provided the light
hits you just so.

1142
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,769
Can I ask what time
of day that might be?

1143
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,686
Just in case I ever need to look
my best for a job interview?

1144
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,206
Dusk. You're
prettiest at about 8:20

1145
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,408
in the summer,
when the light is fading.

1146
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,721
Oh, I see,
the light must be fading,

1147
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,802
so that
I'm not too visible.

1148
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,130
Exactly. I'm thinking when I do
the vanishing elephant trick,

1149
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,249
you must be lit precisely
as I light the elephant.

1150
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,481
Oh!

1151
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,649
I don't think
I'll pursue that.

1152
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,762
You coming to the ball,
at the palace?

1153
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,049
Of course I am.

1154
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,646
My whole life I've wanted
to go to a ball like that.

1155
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,086
Do you have a date?

1156
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,764
I do, indeed.

1157
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,844
I'm going with the most charming
woman in the south of France.

1158
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,445
My Aunt Vanessa.

1159
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,170
I like her.

1160
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,924
I am going to dance
and drink

1161
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,288
and enjoy all the things
you have brought to my life.

1162
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,091
Maybe you and I can even
have a dance together.

1163
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,451
(♪♪♪)

1164
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,841
(♪♪♪)

1165
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,600
Didn't you say that we might
have a dance together?

1166
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,651
Ah, your mental vibrations told
you my feet are killing me.

1167
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,881
Please, be my guest.

1168
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,689
She so appreciates
your support.

1169
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,603
Aunt Vanessa?

1170
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,970
(CHUCKLES)

1171
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,368
You know that you're the
only person tonight

1172
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,886
who hasn't made a comment
on my appearance.

1173
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,202
I'm overwhelmed, Sophie.

1174
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,250
I never dreamed you could
look this beautiful.

1175
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,606
That's more like it.

1176
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,044
You must have moved mountains
to achieve this effect.

1177
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,724
Thanks.

1178
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,411
And this is all without the
added benefit of the lighting

1179
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,289
that you give
your elephant.

1180
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,761
You know, tomorrow I'm doing
that press conference about you.

1181
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,841
Mmm-hmm.

1182
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,851
Tell me, um, Stanley.

1183
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,921
Apart from my gift,

1184
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,004
which has changed
your life so...

1185
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,364
Have you not,
in the...

1186
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,165
In the time that
we've spent together,

1187
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,250
had any other

1188
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,891
thoughts about me?

1189
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,881
Well, I've already
told you,

1190
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,564
I'm in awe of you.

1191
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,802
I don't mean
as a mystic.

1192
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,723
I'm...

1193
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,689
I mean as a woman.

1194
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,202
As a woman?

1195
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,645
What an odd question.

1196
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,803
I've never technically
regarded you as a woman.

1197
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,121
You were a charlatan
who turned the tables on me,

1198
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,641
and now I feel both
humbled and proud.

1199
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,563
You're proud of me?

1200
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,004
You? No, I'm proud
of myself

1201
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,963
for being big enough
to admit that I was wrong

1202
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,048
and foolish
all these years.

1203
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,442
I've been rather snobbish
and, uh, and rude.

1204
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,841
Condescending about
other people's faith.

1205
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,129
So you never thought
about me as a female?

1206
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,328
Well, I was always certain
you were not of my sex,

1207
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,084
if that's
what you're asking.

1208
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,844
And quite good
to look at.

1209
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,410
I mean, comparatively.

1210
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,245
I've exposed some
pretty unattractive mediums,

1211
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,243
a number of
horrible-looking creatures.

1212
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,847
You do understand,
I'm seriously considering

1213
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,048
marrying Brice Catledge?

1214
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,049
Well, I think
you'd be insane not to.

1215
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,041
You don't see it as

1216
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,406
a little hasty of me?

1217
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,209
Well, it's you who can
foretell the future,

1218
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,363
and I'm sure your vibrations
are very positive.

1219
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,249
And common sense
would say that this man

1220
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,606
is a tremendous catch
for you.

1221
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,361
Far beyond what you could hope,
given your trivial resume.

1222
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,568
And of course, now that
you're emerging as a...

1223
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,041
As a phenomenon, you'll always
be able to do quite well,

1224
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,522
financially, although nothing
like the Catledge fortune.

1225
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,802
And most of your time
will be spent with your...

01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,690
Your foundation,
where he'll be a great help.

1227
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,851
So the time that
we've spent together,

1228
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,048
has just had

1229
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,964
no impact on you

1230
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,485
whatsoever?

1231
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,168
I say, don't...

1232
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,771
You don't tell me you're experiencing
romantic feelings for me?

1233
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,369
What if I was?

1234
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,726
Well, that's absurd.

1235
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,088
(STAMMERING) You imagined
that you and I...

1236
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,963
Isn't it enough you've opened
my eyes to the joy of living?

1237
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,371
I mean,
you've conquered my mind.

1238
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,011
Do you, do you also need
to conquer my heart?

1239
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,004
I just thought, in the time
that we had spent together

1240
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,691
<i>that you...</i>

1241
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,569
Don't misunderstand me.

1242
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,603
I hold you in the highest
possible esteem,

1243
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,081
and tomorrow, I am prepared
to tell the world as much.

1244
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,841
Excuse me.

1245
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,481
VANESSA:
Ah, there you are, Stanley.

1246
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,770
I don't know about you,
but I danced till dawn.

1247
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,604
Can you believe the little
medium has grown fond of me?

1248
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,808
Well, why shouldn't she?
According to the newspapers,

1249
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,251
you're her
greatest press agent.

1250
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,800
No, no, I mean... I mean, she's
emotionally taken with me.

1251
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,201
I believe she fancies herself
falling in love with me.

1252
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,520
But you're both
spoken for.

1253
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,444
I know.
It defies all reason.

1254
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,330
She's on the verge of
capturing a rich young man,

1255
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,890
dullard that he is.

1256
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,486
And Olivia and I are,
by her own vibrations,

1257
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,130
the acme of congruity.

1258
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,204
Well, it seems you've given
the matter some thought.

1259
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,123
I was rather taken aback.

1260
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,806
She is looking rather
stunning this evening.

1261
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,405
Yes, to be sure.

1262
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,289
She did make a rather

1263
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,448
surprising entrance.

1264
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,763
Come, I've got to
drive back to Provence,

1265
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,162
and you have some journalists
to see in a few hours.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

1268
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,411
How did you first
discover Miss Baker?

1269
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,401
I came to unmask her, as I
have done countless others,

1270
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,050
but after trying
every which way,

1271
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,442
came to the indisputable
conclusion

1272
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,688
that she is
a genuine medium.

1273
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,003
How can you be so certain
she's authentic?

1274
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,162
I know all the tricks.

1275
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,810

my life's passion.

01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,762
What are her
plans for the future?

1278
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,649
She plans to
start a foundation

1279
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,603
and a school for
teaching the occult.

1280
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,724
How does it feel
to be wrong

1281
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,804
all these years
about the occult?

1282
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,571
Well, on the one side,
I'm embarrassed,

1283
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,371
but also thrilled to finally
be able to take a deep breath

1284
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,363
and see new
possibilities in life.

1285
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,408
So, it is fair
to say that you feel

1286
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,563
the world is not as
rational and predictable

1287
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,648
as you've always
so adamantly,

1288
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,485
and sometimes insultingly,
claimed?

1289
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,042
I deserve your criticism,
I know.

1290
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,567
I've always been a rational man
with a great faith in science.

1291
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,802
What can I say?

1292
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,884
But it would appear
that perhaps,

1293
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,885
to say I believe
in the dignity of man

1294
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,724
is simply not enough.

a world-class foundation.

MRS. BAKER: Yes, there'll be
students from all over the world.

01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,251
You have to see her.

1300
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,560
They are very
close friends of mine.

1301
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,880
I came at once,
but she stumped me,

1302
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,088
so l brought in Mr. Wei
Ling Soo under an alias

1303
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,571
to unmask her.

1304
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,404
Now you see the result.

01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,923
wishful thinking,
strictly for primitives,

1370
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,526
all these,
all these hopes about

1371
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,840
a purpose for life,

1372
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,571
a larger meaning.

1373
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,804
That all our suffering
will somehow accrue to some

1374
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,922
greater plan.

1375
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,365
But if what I see
of late is real

1376
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,966
then I don't have
all the answers.

1377
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,651
It's possible,

1378
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,643
even logical, that

1379
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,644
we are here by design,

1380
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,882
to serve
some higher ideal.

1381
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,042
And that you

1382
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,889
could be real.

1383
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:14,488
And although I have no
right to expect anything,

1384
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,961
my aunt,

1385
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,485
whom I love,

1386
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,562
is in mortal danger.

1387
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,762
And so, I ask you...

1388
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,682
l ask you...

1389
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,329
Wait a minute.

1390
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,847
This is the stupidest

1391
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,129
load of twaddle
I have ever heard.

1392
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,211
My common sense tells me,

1393
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:57,808
I'm falling into
a seductive morass

1394
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,604
of sugarcoated claptrap

1395
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,808
because I want
my aunt to be all right.

1396
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,971
That girl

1397
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,008
is a fake.

1398
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,886
(♪♪♪)

1399
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,731
I told you the surgeons
were wonderful.

1400
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,881
Should I not stay?

1401
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,405
Well, there's nothing
for you to do here.

1402
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,720
She's sleeping
comfortably.

1403
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,325
She responded
well to the drugs.

1404
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,640
The surgery
went beautifully.

1405
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,926
She's out of danger.

1406
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,731
You know, after you left,
I began to pray for her.

1407
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,881
Really?

1408
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,123
Then I rejected the entire
notion as pure poppycock.

1409
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,487
And that includes
Miss Sophie Baker.

1410
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,891
Is that right?

1411
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,207
Well, if Sophie is a fraud,

1412
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:39,648
then how does she do
what she does?

1413
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,006
(♪♪♪)

1414
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,726
on, Stanley! (GASPS)

1415
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,086
Oh, we were all so worried.
BRICE: So worried!

1416
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,443
You can imagine how anxious we
were about your Aunt Vanessa.

1417
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,520
Yes!

1418
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,766
Thank God!

1419
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,444
Madam, I can assure you,

1420
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,126
God had nothing
to do with it.

1421
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,645
She had good doctors.

1422
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,089
Yeah, we have all been
on tenterhooks, Stanley.

1423
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,128
Well, couldn't Sophie
have predicted the outcome

1424
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,168
and put all
your minds at ease?

1425
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,049
Me? I didn't even know.

1426
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,088
I was so mobbed
by all the press, I...

1427
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,161
If I had known,

1428
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,969
I would have gone
with you to the hospital.

1429
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,201
Well, it's all over.

1430
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,681
And, "All's well
that ends well."

1431
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,410
That's not Dickens.

1432
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,242
Well, now that
everything's ended well,

1433
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,601
shall we repair
to the garden?

1434
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,808
Brice? Mrs. Baker?
MRS. BAKER: Me? Great idea.

1435
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,531
I'm so excited about the further
details of the foundation.

1436
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,806
I want to talk over...

1437
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,961
MRS. BAKER: Actually, there
are a few financial details...

1438
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,565
Mother, I'm just
gonna stay here.

1439
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,886
And thank you,
by the way.

1440
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,440
GRACE: And I really want to
go into some detail

1441
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,965
about how much...

1442
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,522
Stanley, I can't imagine what has
been going through your mind.

1443
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,967
I mean, Aunt Vanessa's
such a dear woman.

1444
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,122
Yes, well, a man
in a hospital waiting room

1445
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,440
while a loved one
is under the knife

1446
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,965
has many
feverish thoughts.

1447
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,646
I imagined that
if I prayed

1448
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,802
my prayers
might be heard.

1449
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,123
You thought of praying?

1450
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,170
I never imagined
I would hear those words.

1451
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,449
And my ace in the hole,
so to speak, was that...

1452
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,410
Even if the worst had happened and
Aunt Vanessa had sadly passed away,

1453
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,847
you could always put me in touch
with her in the spirit world,

1454
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,967
and that...

1455
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,522
That rather put
a smile on my face.

1456
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,365
Well, in the end,
she pulled through.

1457
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,044
Well, you look exhausted.

1458
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,485
Well, can you blame me?

1459
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,167
What I need now is a good
bath and a nap and...

1460
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,321
So, if you'll excuse me...

1461
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,447
SOPHIE: Yes, of course.

1462
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,249
(LAUGHING)
Stanley...

1463
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,841
Oh, I'm so relieved
about Aunt Vanessa.

1464
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,207
She's such
a marvelous woman.

1465
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,203
Yeah, she's so lovely.

1466
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,009
We should break open
the champagne.

1467
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,287
We should celebrate.

1468
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,203
HOWARD: Aunt Vanessa's
recovered.

1469
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:05,602
Not to mention that I
find this whole thing

1470
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,206
a most rewarding
experience.

1471
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,844
You feel no remorse?

1472
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,644
Why should
I feel remorse?

1473
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,371
Hoodwinking
a lifelong friend.

1474
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,641
Mmm.

1475
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,006
I see it
quite differently.

1476
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,128
Hoodwinking is what we do.

1477
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,162
Now, you've got to understand
that since we were boys,

1478
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,004
I have played
second fiddle

1479
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,048
to that egomaniacal,
self-regarding...

1480
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,201
Genius.

1481
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,805
HOWARD: Yeah, he's a
genius at what he does,

1482
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,451
and I turned out
to be a mere mortal.

1483
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,081
But now, after years
of trailing in his wake,

1484
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,242
and I admit,
some envy and resentment,

1485
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,723
I have finally put one over
the great Wei Ling Soo.

1486
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,964
I have fooled the man
who could not be fooled.

1487
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,725
Not quite, Howard.

1488
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,201
How did...

1489
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,329
STANLEY: You admired this effect
when you saw my show in Berlin.

1490
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,400
I said I'd teach it to you
if you behaved yourself,

1491
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,681
but you have not behaved.

1492
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,129
It's a trick, Sophie.

1493
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,682
I don't really dematerialize
and reassemble my ectoplasm

1494
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,003
any more than you contact
spirits or read minds.

1495
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,605
Stanley, I can explain...

1496
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,126
I watched you so closely.

1497
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,362
Howard watched your mother,

1498
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,569
but who watched Howard?

1499
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,490
You were free
to rap on the table.

1500
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,527
You seized
the floating candle,

1501
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,807
you swore there were no
wires making it float,

1502
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,645
and I took you
at your word.

1503
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,688
You were free to rap
once for yes, twice for no.

1504
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,570
And when Sophie excused
herself at my aunt's

1505
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,008
to make a telephone call,
she called you

1506
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:43,125
and you fed her
information about my aunt.

1507
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,001
At first,
I couldn't believe

1508
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,366
you would betray me
like that.

1509
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,889
But, as you know,

1510
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,042
I am a misanthrope.

1511
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,929
And that people do
unconscionable things

1512
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,209
does not run counter to my
normal view of humanity.

1513
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,966
As boys, we both chose
magic as our calling.

1514
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,761
We both practiced day and
night, I as much as you.

1515
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,161
My skill was
the equal of yours,

1516
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:11,689
and yet, you emerged onto the
world stage as the great artist.

1517
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,840
But it wasn't fair.

1518
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,161
Life's not fair, Howard.

1519
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,842
In fact, as a general
rule, as I've often said,

1520
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,285
it's pretty nasty.

1521
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,925
Because of Sophie,

1522
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,331
I began to succumb
to magical thinking.

1523
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,251
And for a while,
I was actually happy.

1524
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,404
But I was happy
as a fool is happy.

1525
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,245
Happiness is not
the natural human condition.

1526
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,687
And incidentally, you never
practiced as much as I did,

1527
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,489
and your skill
was never equal to mine.

1528
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,005
Stanley, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry...

1529
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,289
I ran into Howard here when he
was sent to expose me, and he...

1530
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,125
He did expose me,
quite easily.

1531
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,202
But we made this private
pact to do this scheme,

1532
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,365
and I only agreed because it
meant so much to Mom and me.

1533
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,805
I view your behavior as

1534
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,282
a great man views
the malicious mischief of...

1535
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,840
What shall we say, pygmy?

1536
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,445
You're a fake.

1537
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,729
As I always should have
known, and did, in my heart.

1538
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,644
I only wish I hadn't wasted
so much time with you.

1539
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,322
Well, now you're just being
a pompous stick in the mud.

1540
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,562
We played an elaborate
joke on you, Stanley.

1541
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,125
No one was harmed.

1542
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,811
My reputation
will suffer,

1543
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,609
and you played me
for a fool.

1544
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,081
Your reputation
is all ego!

1545
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,605
(STAMMERING) I've...

1546
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,523
Yes, yes,
things got out of hand,

1547
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,090
but no awful thing happened.

1548
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,242
I mean, you were...
You were happy.

1549
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,727
And you enjoyed life
for once.

1550
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,610
You saw the world
as optimists see the world.

1551
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,250
And we had some
laughs together,

1552
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,800
so don't say that you wasted
your time with me.

1553
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,530
What would you
have been doing?

1554
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,446
Sitting in your room and shuffling
cards in front of a mirror?

1555
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,602
All my optimism
was an illusion.

1556
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,364
Well, I started
reading that book

1557
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,966
by that German philosopher,
you know, that you gave me?

1558
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,008
I didn't really
understand much of it,

1559
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,129
but he said that we need
our illusions to live.

1560
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,531
You mean lies.

1561
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,087
You were much happier

1562
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,208
when you let some lies
into your life, Stanley.

1563
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,811
HOWARD: Think about it,
Stanley,

1564
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,884
do you really want to ruin the
peace of mind Grace Catledge has,

1565
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,282
secure in the knowledge that she
is her husband's only love?

1566
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,368
We can't go around
deluding ourselves.

1567
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,602
But we must.

1568
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,126
If we're to
get through life.

1569
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,288
I mean, I didn't say it,

1570
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,567
I'm just quoting,
you know, Mister...

1571
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,086
Um...

1572
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,561
Nietzsche.

1573
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:33,008
And, in the end, who really knows
what's real and what's not?

1574
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,970
Well, it's quite clear what's real,
my praying for my aunt was poppycock,

1575
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,644
the doctor's skill
was real.

1576
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,485
No. You will never
know that, because George,

1577
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,370
Caroline's husband,
the psychoanalyst,

1578
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,841
told me that he was praying
for your aunt, too.

1579
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,285
And so we don't know
if maybe

1580
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,488
it was his prayers
that got answered.

1581
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,409
Maybe the angels
like him better.

1582
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,843
I won't dignify this
conversation any longer.

1583
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,445
I'm going to go
and visit my Aunt Vanessa

1584
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,364
until she's on her feet,
and then good-bye.

1585
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,488
And you won't forgive me?

1586
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,369
Well, I can't forgive you.

1587
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,807
Only God can forgive you.

1588
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,848
But you said
there is no God.

1589
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,082
Precisely my point.

1590
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,324

1602
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,450
More robust than ever,
I'll wager.

1603
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,643
"What doesn't kill me
makes me stronger."

1604
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,245
A great man said that.

1605
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,924
Oh, not
the "God is dead" fellow.

1606
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,126
STANLEY: The very same.

1607
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,770
Nevertheless,
I think he was wrong.

1608
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,842
What doesn't kill us often
knocks the hell out of us.

1609
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,242
Well, sometimes a close
call wakes a person up.

1610
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,923
I've had another idea
for our honeymoon.

1611
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,968
What if,
after the Greek Islands,

1612
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,730
we set sail
for the South Seas.

1613
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,848
I've always wanted
to visit Bora Bora.

1614
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,291
Would that interest you?

1615
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,010
I've never...
I've never heard of it,

1616
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,651
but the name
sounds pretty exotic.

1617
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,728
Exotic?
Mmm-hmm.

1618
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,204
BRICE: I love how you pick
always the exact right word.

1619
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,241
(LAUGHS)

1620
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,485
Yes, of course, Olivia.

1621
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,443
I'll be home
in a few days.

1622
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,006
I just have to see that Aunt
Vanessa is up and running,

1623
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,970
and, uh, I have one or two
press interviews I have to do.

1624
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,963
Some things need to be
smoothed over.

1625
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,168
This is where
I could use your tact.

1626
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,607
Yes, of course. Yes.

1627
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,250
Bye, darling.

1628
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,968
I bet you'll be glad
to get back to London

1629
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,769
and put all this
behind you.

1630
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,966
Um...

1631
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,329
You might enjoy
the Galapagos.

1632
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,129
You're a great admirer
of Darwin's.

1633
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,249
Big turtles.
Yes, I suppose so.

1634
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,804
And of course,
you must miss Olivia.

1635
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,961
Um...

1636
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,326
A very fine woman. I can tell
that from her photographs.

1637
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,164
Such elegance and style.

1638
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,846
Absolutely perfect
for a man of your taste.

1639
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,127
Well, yes, it's...
There's no question.

1640
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,680
We're ideally suited.

1641
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,162
A very... And you need
a well-educated woman

1642
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,362
to keep up with you.

1643
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,289
And she's quite
attractive, to boot.

1644
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,648
Yes, yes,
it's very easy to see us

1645
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,326
side by side
through life's journey.

1646
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,529
A very handsome
couple indeed.

1647
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,331
Yes, there's no question.
We're ideally suited.

1648
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,243
As you would say.

1649
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,483
A quite rational choice.

1650
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,404
I mean, it's not
entirely cerebral.

1651
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,482
I mean, I do love her.

1652
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,965
What are you suggesting?

1653
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,209
Suggesting? In the
nuance of your tone?

1654
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,123
Of course I love her.

1655
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,043
Or are you saying

1656
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,122
you think I've come to
love Sophie Baker?

1657
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,567
Me? I never
mentioned Sophie.

1658
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,290
Well, I thought you
were heading there.

1659
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,521
Sophie Baker?

1660
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,886
The little fake who
played you for a dupe?

1661
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,564
Exactly. That wretch.

1662
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,563
Why would I suggest you've
fallen in love with Sophie?

1663
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,085
Well, you might.

1664
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,207
I never know
what goes on

1665
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,566
in that devious mind
of yours.

1666
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:47,441
The very idea of you and that
specious American telepathic.

1667
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,807
Well, I know
it defies all reason.

1668
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:53,407
You, a creature of reason.
A man of intellect.

1669
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,686
To be sure.

1670
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,091
VANESSA: Certainly
not trivial.

1671
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,730
No, to say the least.

1672
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,326
And she's hardly in the
same class as Olivia.

1673
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,207
The comparison
makes me laugh.

1674
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,726
Olivia is a person
of accomplishment and charm.

1675
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,086
Sophie's a street finagler

1676
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,130
who makes her way living off
one bit of hokum to the next.

1677
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,328
Well, I don't see how you
can compare the two.

1678
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,971
Well, don't put ideas
into my head!

1679
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,042
Well, far be it from me.

1680
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,011
Of course, she does come
from dire circumstances.

1681
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,447
I mean, it's very
easy to be judgmental

1682
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,602
about people who are
born into circumstances

1683
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,648
less fortunate
than one's own.

1684
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,125
Life is harsh.

1685
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,487
One must do what one
must to survive.

1686
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,800
STANLEY: Well put.

1687
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,848
And people do sometimes
make the wrong choices,

1688
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,843
which they regret,

1689
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,641
even though no serious
harm was done.

1690
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,326
Which of us has not made
some blunders in life?

1691
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:52,126
And there is a rather appealing
quality about Sophie.

1692
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,168
Despite her
disgusting behavior.

1693
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:58,808
Yes, her smile
is rather winning.

1694
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,325
Of course, it depends
how much value

1695
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,845
you put
on the purely physical.

1696
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,649
STANLEY: Well, no, l...

1697
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,688
I, for one,
esteem the higher virtues.

1698
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,807
Hmm...

1699
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,928
Beauty of the soul.

1700
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:14,882
Although her eyes are rather
pleasant to look into.

1701
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,881
And that she can be amusing,
under the right circumstances.

1702
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,521
Oh, but Olivia is an
educated, cultivated woman.

1703
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,246
One that befits a man
of your artistic genius.

1704
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,051
Yes, now, my genius
must be factored in.

1705
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,009
On paper,
there's really no reason

1706
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,845
to prefer
Sophie to Olivia.

1707
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,763
Well, I would say
the opposite.

1708
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,927
(STAMMERING) And so
your suggestion that I,

1709
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,684
I be honest with Olivia

1710
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,684
and tell her that
irrational as it seems,

1711
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,161
I've fallen in
love with Sophie,

1712
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,766
that's a
preposterous notion.

1713
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,922
It's lunacy.

1714
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,405
Yet I can't help
feeling that...

1715
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,165
That you love Sophie.

1716
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,730
Yes, I understand.

1717
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,609
You're puzzled
and bewildered

1718
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,529
because your foolish logic

1719
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,325
Tells you that
you should love Olivia.

1720
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,686
Foolish logic?

1721
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,240
And yet, how little
that logic means

1722
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,085
when placed
next to Sophie's smile.

1723
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,924
What are you saying?

1724
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,921
That the world may or may
not be without purpose,

1725
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,721
but it's not totally without
some kind of magic.

1726
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,644
I have irrational positive
feelings for Sophie Baker.

1727
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,561
It's like witnessing
a trick I can't figure out.

1728
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,325
I wouldn't try to figure it out.
I'd simply move on it.

1729
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:38,041
Word is, she's already accepted
Brice Catledge's proposal.

1730
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,485
Taken to reading
the great books?

1731
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,725
Yes.

1732
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,922
Well, you once said
not to despair.

1733
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,843
There's hope
for my brain.

1734
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,286
Perhaps I was
a bit caustic.

1735
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,441
But you will
admit you were guilty

1736
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,285
of some rather
sleazy doings.

1737
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,282
Yes, well,
those days are over.

1738
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,601
I no longer
have to worry about

1739
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:25,122
where to sleep
and how to eat.

1740
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,647
I take it Brice Catledge has made
a serious marriage proposal?

1741
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,845
Yes.

1742
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,649
A very tempting one.

1743
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,131
SOPHIE: Wouldn't you agree?

1744
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,487
Yes, I suppose so.

1745
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,006
But I'm here to make you
a more tempting one.

1746
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,365
More tempting than this?

1747
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,325
I came to say

1748
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,004
that for some
inexplicable reason

1749
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,402
that defies common sense
and human understanding,

1750
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,602
that I have, of late,

1751
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,603
experienced some small...

1752
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,445
Quite small,
but discernible

1753
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,171
inner stirrings
regarding your smile.

1754
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,085
How magnanimous of you.

1755
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,924
STANLEY: Yes,
I thought you'd think so.

1756
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,241
And possessing
a soul which is large

1757
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,608
and capable of complexity,
as all great minds are,

1758
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,728
I have decided
to forgive you

1759
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,087
and take you
under my wing.

1760
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,884
Your wing?

1761
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:20,006
It's a saying. Obviously,
I don't have wings.

1762
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,560
I only mean that,

1763
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,005
incredible as it sounds,

1764
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,321
and this is no small gesture,
given the time wasted

1765
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,289
and the public embarrassment
you've caused me,

1766
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,647
that I'm

1767
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,722
willing to
take you back.

1768
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,884
Take me back where?

1769
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,291
Under the moon
in the observatory.

1770
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:42,401
I regretted
what I was doing,

1771
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,323
but I was too inept
to change course,

1772
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:48,200
and I apologize.

1773
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,611
Really.

1774
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,841
And I accept
your forgiveness.

1775
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,002
I understand that
it's very generous of you,

1776
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,684
and I have to be going.

1777
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,366
Going? I haven't said
what I came for.

1778
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,209
Well, then just
say it and go,

1779
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,806
because I have a dinner
to go to with my fiancé.

1780
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,882
I'm here to say

1781
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,327
that in spite of everything,

1782
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,926
l am willing to
consider marrying you.

1783
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,090
What?
Naturally,

1784
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,642
you can't believe your good fortune.
I appreciate that.

1785
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,205
Stanley, brilliant as you
are with a deck of cards,

1786
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,841
you are terrible
at proposing.

1787
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,286
I've never
proposed before.

1788
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,407
SOPHIE: Oh, really?

1789
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,482
Not even
to your fiancée?

1790
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,241
She proposed marriage.

1791
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:34,290
The truth is I've never really
felt the urge to propose before.

1792
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,691
SOPHIE: Use your head!

1793
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,491
We're not a match
made in heaven,

1794
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,848
and as you've said
before many times,

1795
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,844
when the heart rules the
head, disaster follows.

1796
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,767
But the fact is

1797
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,081
I love you.

1798
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,680
And somewhere
in your confused,

1799
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,960
black, little
criminal's heart,

1800
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,525
you care for me.

1801
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,121
I'm marrying
Brice Catledge.

1802
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,929
You advised me to.

1803
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,604
You must never
take my advice.

1804
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:02,680
I'm a major eccentric.

1805
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,131
You know,
Brice adores me,

1806
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,409
and he offers me
a life of travel

1807
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,164
and excitement
and high living.

1808
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,241
No, no,

1809
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,400
he worships you, and you
don't want to be worshiped.

1810
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,680
You'll be bored.

1811
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,683
Oh. Sailing to
the Greek Islands?

1812
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,205
And Bora Bora?

1813
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,320
Well, they're just, they're
just rocks in the ocean!

1814
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,930
It's who you go with!

1815
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,889
Do you want to spend the
rest of your life with a man

1816
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,328
who plays the ukulele
and croons to you?

1817
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,801
You know I like you
very much, Stanley.

1818
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,650
I even began
falling in love with you.

1819
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:38,284
But when you went on to show
me how irrational it was,

1820
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,169
and then you proved it

1821
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,208
with geometrical logic.
No.

1822
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,647
Geometry was never
my strong subject.

1823
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,485
After all,
what can you offer me?

1824
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,130
Grumpy moods?

1825
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,804
Insults?

1826
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,370
Pessimistic grumbling

1827
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,649
about how awful life is
for all of us?

1828
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,484
Well, around you,
I'm not gloomy.

1829
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,523
That's only
because I fooled you

1830
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,444
into thinking that there's more
to life than meets the eye.

1831
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,205
No, no, I have not
lost my pessimism,

1832
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:10,002
but you are like an oasis
in the grim desert.

1833
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,651
And as far as
what I can offer you,

1834
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,724
life with a brilliant
and witty genius.

1835
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,280
I have to go.

1836
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,084
No, this is
your last offer.

1837
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,685
You must not
be an ingrate.

1838
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,841
Good-bye, Stanley.

1839
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,201
I will not stand around
here, cap in hand,

1840
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:28,648
waiting for some halfpenny
con artist to be my bride!

1841
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,771
This is it.
You don't agree now,

1842
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,808
offer's off the table.

1843
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,041
Do you hear me?

1844
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,804
You irritating Lilliputian!

1845
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,804
You're throwing away
your passport to paradise!

1846
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,204
Can you
forgive me, Stanley?

1847
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,248
Oh, I have forgiven you,
Howard,

1848
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,322
as I've forgiven Sophie.

1849
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,205
I agree, I needed
a pie in the face.

1850
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,560
Well, I saw a side of you in
this I've never seen before.

1851
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,841
It was refreshing.

1852
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,242
Even now, Sophie's smile
still penetrates my soul.

1853
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,290
(SCOFFS) Now you believe
we have souls?

1854
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:04,251
No, I believe each of us must find
a reason to truly embrace life,

1855
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,891
and for me,
Sophie is that reason.

1856
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,531
Well, if nothing else,
it's made you certain

1857
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,967
it would've been
a mistake to marry Olivia.

1858
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,202
I spoke to Olivia
on the telephone.

1859
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,567
She's much less upset
than I'd anticipated.

1860
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:20,241
Very calm,
very reasonable.

1861
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,845
She's in the Galapagos.

1862
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,241
She said
she was disappointed,

1863
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,607
but she understood that
these things happen,

1864
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:29,445
and if I was still going to
feel this way when I returned,

1865
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,522
it's much better
we found out now.

1866
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,887
What a lovely,
rational human being.

1867
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,405
I should look her up.

1868
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,370
She's bright, pretty,
she likes magicians.

1869
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,801
(♪♪♪)

1870
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,801
Well, how did it go?

1871
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,247
Can you believe
she turned me down?

1872
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,447
Oh.

1873
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,409
Poor Stanley.

1874
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,331
That scamp
could've had me,

1875
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,051
but instead,
she chose Brice Catledge.

1876
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,488
Well, he is very rich
and good-looking.

1877
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,925
She'd have been
happier with me.

1878
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,731
So in the end,
you lost her.

1879
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,246
It's sad, because

1880
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,561
there really was
something between us.

1881
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:48,048
Some chemistry.
Some magic.

1882
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:51,681
And I say chemistry
or magic because...

1883
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,843
I believe I actually
loved her from the first,

1884
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,888
first moment
I laid eyes on her.

1885
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,203
Well, love at first sight is
a kind of magic, isn't it?

1886
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,203
You need a drink.
What will you have?

1887
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,566
A scotch, please.

1888
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,922
In the end,
she proved to be a fool.

1889
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,089
You mean to choose that handsome
young millionaire over you?

1890
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,401
VANESSA: Well, she may
come to her senses.

1891
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,609
Women do change their mind
about such things.

1892
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,490
Well, it's too late... I've
taken the offer off the table.

1893
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,040
I'll not let myself be
pushed around by big eyes

1894
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,327
and a smile.

1895
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,602
Although she's much more.

1896
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,082
But she had her chance,
and she said no.

1897
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:34,687
You mean if she changed her
mind, you wouldn't accept her?

1898
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,000
It's too late.

1899
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,082
Oh, you can't be
that stubborn.

1900
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:45,249
Well, l suppose if she woke
up and realized how happy

1901
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,685
she'd be with me,

1902
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:49,161
how much more fun
she'd have in life,

1903
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,642
how much
I'd come to love her.

1904
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,244
She gave nothing back.

1905
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,244
She gave you no sign
at all that she cared?

1906
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:03,169
If she'd given me a sign,

1907
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:06,801
I'd have taken her
in my arms, carried her off

1908
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,882
and married her.

1909
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,210
All I was looking for
was one sign.

1910
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,361
(THUMPS ONCE)

1911
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,530
Sophie?

1912
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,361
(THUMPS ONCE)

1913
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,890
Will you marry me?

1914
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,481
(THUMPS ONCE)

1915
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,326
(LAUGHS QUIETLY)

1916
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,890
(♪♪♪)
