1
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:22,941
Taken...

2
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:35,580
Do I?

3
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:42,049
To us.

4
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:47,058
Us.

5
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:52,628
Do you know what
you're gonna name her?

6
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,465
Allie.

7
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:01,064
Her name is Allie.

8
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,077
ERIC: I want you to join me
in the program, Mary.

9
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,980
You're grandfather found this
in Pine Lodge, New Mexico.

10
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,986
Found it at a crash site.

11
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,015
So it's all true.

12
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,788
This is something that shouldn't
go outside the family.

13
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,853
What's this, Allie?

14
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,991
That's my journal.

15
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,830
I write down things I think of and stuff.

16
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,164
We need your help, gentlemen.

17
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,364
You'll stop playing games
and tell us everything you know

18
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,872
about whoever it is who's out there
and what the hell they want.

19
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,670
Mr. Miller has an implant.

20
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,041
We're monitoring it.

21
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,739
The implants broadcast
on a spread spectrum.

22
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,405
We block those frequencies,
the implant doesn't register.

23
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,245
ERIC: Will this work on Allie?

24
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,217
We can block her frequency, too.

25
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,548
And they can't find her.

26
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,178
ERIC: Let's pick her up.

27
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,450
She can manipulate time.

28
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,321
That therapy group her mother's in?
We have someone in that group.

29
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,725
Put your gun away, Ray!

30
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,763
You don't want to do this.
Put the gun away!

31
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,798
You know who's in there, right,
besides the little girl?

32
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,493
Her mother and her father... Charlie.

33
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,501
That means he knows, and that's
two people with a lot of information

34
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,231
that have had some pretty bad
experiences with us over the years.

35
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,208
They have to go.

36
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:15,213
Dr. Penzler, too.

37
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,543
What are you doing, Allie?

38
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,052
Look at me, Dad.

39
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,453
(gasps)

40
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:29,461
Get away!

41
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:36,468
Take the little girl and... it's a trick!

42
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:41,636
Run!

43
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,970
Come on!

44
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:47,979
I'll take care of you. Come on.

45
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,761
CHET: Where did they go?

46
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:10,769
ALLIE: Miss Crawford...

47
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:15,874
I'm ready to go with you now.

48
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,209
ALLIE: <i>I guess I always knew</i>

49
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,975
<i>that there was</i>
<i>something different about me.</i>

50
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,986
<i>But when all of this</i>
<i>began to happen,</i>

51
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:34,893
<i>when I started</i>
<i>to be able to do things,</i>

52
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,191
<i>it was kind of scary</i>...

53
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,758
<i>like in a dream</i>
<i>where you start falling</i>

54
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:48,773
<i>and it feels kind of good,</i>

55
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:53,945
<i>until you begin to wonder</i>
<i>if you'll ever be able to stop.</i>

56
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,782
That was a good trick.

57
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,478
You're a very complicated little girl.

58
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,578
What do you mean?

59
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,592
I mean, with what you can do,

60
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:14,165
you could have walked out
of that building.

61
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:21,599
Why did you let us take you?

62
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:26,611
I wanted you to leave my mom
and all the other people alone.

63
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,144
I was afraid you might hurt someone.

64
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:35,517
I thought if I went with you,
they'd be all right.

65
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:40,525
Allie?

66
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,628
It's 12:17. We've lost two hours.

67
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,822
What?

68
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,866
We've lost two hours.

69
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,425
Are you all right?

70
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:54,997
Look, what I did... I'm sorry.

71
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,067
It's okay. I'm alive. We're all alive.

72
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:04,082
Everyone get out of here.
Don't go home.

73
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,217
Find places where
you're gonna be safe.

74
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:16,227
- Allie?
- Just get out of here! Go!

75
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:24,436
LISA: Allie!

76
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,566
CHARLIE: Go!

77
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,403
LISA: Allie?

78
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:33,844
Allie!

79
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,974
Allie!

80
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,075
Lisa, she's gone. She's not here.

81
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,815
Where did she go?
Where did they take her?

82
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,653
Allie!

83
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,886
Allie!

84
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,155
I've got to find my daughter, please!

85
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:54,359
I know.

86
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,058
Allie did this...

87
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,362
the time... all of it.

88
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,029
Allie gave us missing time?

89
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,074
Y-Y-Yes.

90
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,540
She... she stopped time.

91
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,667
She stopped us,

92
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,075
she stopped us
and let time keep moving.

93
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,942
She wanted to keep us safe,
and she did that.

94
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,845
She needed the missing time

95
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,613
so that she could go with them
without us trying to stop her.

96
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,247
She was trying to keep us safe.

97
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,121
(radio plays)

98
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,558
(knock on door)

99
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,652
I'm coming!

100
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,026
Oh, thank God.
I've been worried sick!

101
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,257
I went by your apartment
four times.

102
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,027
I kept calling. What happened?
Are you all right?

103
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,897
(voice breaking) Allie's gone.

104
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,496
Do you know who I am?

105
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,475
Not exactly.

106
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:42,480
Well... um...

107
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,178
our families go way back...

108
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:52,190
mine and your mom's
and your dad's.

109
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:09,440
I kind of think that you and I
might be the end of all this.

110
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:24,022
We might just be
the beginning.

111
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,819
Your grandfather wasn't
a very happy man.

112
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:32,830
Why are you trying so hard
to be like him?

113
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:38,002
We're almost to the airstrip.
We better get this thing in place.

114
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,382
(moans)

115
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,190
Lisa.

116
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,289
Lisa, it's all right.

117
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,231
Lisa. Baby. Lisa!

118
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,464
Lisa! Lisa!

119
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,597
N-N-N-Nina?

120
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,507
I'm right here.
I'm right in front of you.

121
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,907
I can't see anything!
I can't see anything at all!

122
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,946
NINA: Lisa.

123
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,177
Lisa!

124
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,618
(Lisa moans loudly)

125
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,586
All right? Can you see me now?

126
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,714
What happened to you?

127
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:36,728
I don't know.

128
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,458
I was... somewhere else.

129
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,092
I was somewhere else, and...

130
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,296
wherever it was,

131
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,668
I couldn't see a thing.

132
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,264
She's always been a...

133
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:54,278
she was a real good-Iooking baby
right from the start.

134
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,680
And really smart.

135
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:03,381
At seven months' old, she was
already playing peek-a-boo.

136
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:08,393
I've got a video at home of her
taking her first steps.

137
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,761
You should see that.

138
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,800
I'd like to.

139
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:19,804
We've always had this link,
you know, a connection.

140
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,306
I've always known
exactly where she was,

141
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:24,899
what she was thinking,
how she was feeling.

142
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,280
I'd go to pick her up at school,
I'd stop off to get Tylenol...

143
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,315
she'd walk out the building with
a runny nose and a headache.

144
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,510
Sounds silly, doesn't it?

145
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,054
I mean,
every mother has that.

146
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,714
No, they don't.

147
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,918
Man, I'm really, truly sorry.

148
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,621
This is because Allie's blessed, right?

149
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,856
These people that took her
want to know what she's all about.

150
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,262
Yeah, pretty much.

151
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,893
We'll do whatever we can
to help you get her back.

152
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,962
I've got a couple of shirts
around that'll fit you.

153
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,007
Over the years, a girl winds up
with a souvenir or two.

154
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:01,012
Allie left this in the park

155
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,376
when she ran away
at soccer practice.

156
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,544
12 hours ago, there was
a bullet in my lung.

157
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,557
I should be dead.

158
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:17,519
Why doesn't it surprise me
that you're not?

159
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:21,623
She's just a kid.

160
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,635
She didn't ask for any of this.

161
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:29,640
She shouldn't
have to do any of this.

162
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:34,741
It's not fair! It's not fair at all!

163
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,611
We'll get her back.

164
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,980
How?

165
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,578
ALLIE: <i>When you've done something</i>
<i>that you can't take back,</i>

166
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,249
<i>something that</i>
<i>you don't understand,</i>

167
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:50,261
<i>you start to hold tightly</i>

168
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,430
<i>to the things</i>
<i>you do understand,</i>

169
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,234
<i>and you try to make sense</i>
<i>out of everything you can.</i>

170
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:05,243
<i>Because if you believed</i>
<i>that all you had to do</i>

171
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,853
<i>to make things right</i>
<i>was to find a reason,</i>

172
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,321
<i>but what happens</i>
<i>when you find the reasons</i>

173
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:27,456
<i>and they are not your own?</i>

174
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,400
<i>How do you find any comfort</i>
<i>or any sense in that?</i>

175
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,369
They're on their way.

176
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:37,375
We haven't had a chance to talk.

177
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,572
What do you mean?

178
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,740
About your father.

179
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,513
There's nothing to say.

180
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,784
You did what you had to do
for the project.

181
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:56,794
Ha Ha. "For the project."

182
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,763
When I was a kid,

183
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,999
every time he went out of town,
I used to imagine a car wreck,

184
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,166
something like that,

185
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,733
just how much better our lives
would have been if he were gone.

186
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:17,748
You've been inside a craft.

187
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:24,522
Many times, yeah...

188
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:33,965
that one at Groom Lake.

189
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,862
That was beautiful...

190
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:41,873
wasn't it?

191
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,341
Yeah.

192
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:53,351
That was my family legacy.

193
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:56,854
The craft, the bodies.

194
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,048
My grandfather's legacy.

195
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:03,060
My father squandered all that.

196
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,063
He had it right there in his hand,
and he let it all slip away.

197
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,105
He couldn't stop them.

198
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,267
He could have tried.

199
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:17,741
You don't feel any remorse, do you?

200
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,606
Do you think that
makes me a bad person?

201
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,909
You did what you had to do.

202
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:27,442
I heard about your father.

203
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,352
I'm sorry for your loss.

204
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,687
It was a terribly
unfortunate mistake.

205
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,696
Mistake?

206
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:46,203
You've got the girl?

207
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,145
She's inside.

208
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:01,152
So you really believe

209
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,412
that thing you put on her head
is blocking her signal?

210
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,185
Right now, they're in their ship,
scratching their little gray heads,

211
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,249
going, "Where's our girl?"

212
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:13,264
Then, when we take that shield off,
here they come.

213
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,626
You're confident
we can take them down?

214
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,430
Wherever they come from...

215
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,731
the most distant star,
the furthest reaches of time...

216
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:23,741
the moment they enter
our time and space, our reality,

217
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,171
they're confronted by
the laws of our physics.

218
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,473
You're sure of that?

219
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,505
In 1947,
in Roswell, New Mexico,

220
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:36,179
a ship came down when it collided
with a Mogul spy balloon... a balloon.

221
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,779
Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure.

222
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,915
You done a fine job.
We're indebted to you.

223
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,187
What is this?

224
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:47,198
SOLDIER:
Charlie company, move out!

225
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,732
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of your country

226
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,895
for your contribution to this effort.

227
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,907
You've done your part,
Miss Crawford.

228
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,535
The little girl's a part of
a military operation now.

229
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:05,072
We'll take it from here.

230
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,675
For three generations, my family's
been preparing for this.

231
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:12,690
I've dedicated my career...
my life... to this.

232
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,426
And don't think we don't appreciate it.

233
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,055
In a matter of days,

234
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,691
we may be able to set foot
inside one of their craft,

235
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,291
to meet these beings,

236
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,460
to find out what this
has all been about.

237
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,025
If you think I'm gonna stand by

238
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:30,041
while you take that opportunity away
from me, you're out of your mind.

239
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,835
You don't really have a choice.

240
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:38,645
You've been benched.
Go sit down. Grab some pine.

241
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:42,448
What I'd like you to do now...

242
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,490
I'd like you to clean up
the mess you made in Seattle.

243
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,653
The doctor... she's a liability.
Marginalize her.

244
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,696
And the girl's parents... put them
somewhere until this is over.

245
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:52,957
Don't want them stirring the pot.

246
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:57,525
We have people for that.

247
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,766
You mentioned your father's
death was a mistake.

248
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,003
People spend the rest of their lives
in prison for mistakes like that.

249
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:09,514
Stay out of my way.

250
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:14,518
You can ride with me, doctor.

251
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:21,892
Brief me on the way.

252
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,724
E-E-Excuse me?

253
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,825
We need your expertise.

254
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,198
I'm not giving you
a choice here, doctor.

255
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,703
Come on, let's go. Now.

256
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:37,708
Uh...

257
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:44,148
Milo and I,
we drove everywhere.

258
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,445
We'd ask people in diners
and in gas stations,

259
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,145
and we got guys
from every band we know

260
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,779
doing the same thing.

261
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,845
Nothing.

262
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,253
What about taking this public?

263
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,485
They're not gonna come after you
with the whole world watching.

264
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,824
I called Channel 4 news.

265
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,024
I said my daughter was kidnapped
by a super-secret government agency.

266
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:08,038
They... they said I should
call the police.

267
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,313
I told them I didn't think
it would do any good,

268
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,258
and they gave me another number...

269
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:06,423
for Highline West
Psychiatric Hospital.

270
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:11,435
We put an ad
in the <i>New York Times.</i>

271
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:17,675
That's how Lisa gets
in touch with her uncle.

272
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,147
Tom will be calling us soon.

273
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,957
I'm cold.

274
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:39,964
Shouldn't be much longer.

275
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:48,435
Thank you.

276
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,907
Lisa.

277
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,913
(Allie's voice)
I'm scared, Charlie.

278
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:10,356
I'm very, very scared.

279
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,796
Just how powerful is this
little girl, doctor?

280
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,925
She's demonstrated powers
beyond anything we imagined.

281
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,939
She can manipulate time,

282
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:28,512
she has amazing abilities to screen,

283
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:44,328
to project images from our minds.

284
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,138
Just how powerful is she?

285
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,776
The question
you should be asking is,

286
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:10,754
why is she letting us
take her anywhere at all?

287
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,847
<i>You've reached the voice mail</i>
<i>for Dr. Chet Wakeman.</i>

288
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:17,861
<i>Dr. Wakeman is out of range</i>
<i>of this cellular device.</i>

289
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:24,335
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

290
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:45,055
<i>General Beers' office.</i>

291
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:07,411
This is Mary Crawford.

292
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:21,759
Can you reach
the general for me?

293
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,088
I'm sorry, Miss Crawford.
He's not available.

294
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,029
Tell him I have new information
he'll want to hear about.

295
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:32,035
ALLIE: <i>We had come to the time</i>
<i>I had always known was coming.</i>

296
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,833
<i>I had always had</i>
<i>this feeling that, one day,</i>

297
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,740
<i>I would have to do</i>
<i>something very hard.</i>

298
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,747
<i>I just hoped that I could</i>
<i>find a way to do it</i>

299
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,683
<i>without anyone getting hurt.</i>

300
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:51,882
Sorry, sir. There's been a toxic spill.
You need to turn your vehicle around.

301
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,017
No one's allowed to go through.

302
00:24:55,093 --> 00:25:00,030
Let's get the gate.

303
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,896
How you doin' in there?

304
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,493
I'm all right.

305
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:14,845
Can I ask you something?

306
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,745
I heard that you let them take you,

307
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:24,755
that you came right up to them
and said you'd go with them.

308
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:31,726
Uh-huh.

309
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,162
I also heard that you can do things,

310
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:37,463
kind of like magic or something.

311
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,299
Is that true?

312
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,429
Yes.

313
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,062
So you've got all of that power,
why didn't you just stop them?

314
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,538
I was afraid
they'd hurt other people.

315
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,542
You're one brave little girl.

316
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,306
I don't feel very brave right now.

317
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,245
Hey...

318
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:55,252
maybe later, I could come back
with a book or something.

319
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,657
Did you ever read
<i>Huckleberry Finn?</i>

320
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:09,633
No, I never have.

321
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,554
Well, I've got my copy
in my duffle.

322
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,123
I always carry it with me.

323
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,635
It was my mom's favorite book.

324
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,002
She'd bake us Toll House cookies,

325
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,665
and we'd share the whole plate
of them while she read.

326
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,541
If it wouldn't make you
too sad to remember her...

327
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,738
I'd like to hear the story.

328
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,075
No, it wouldn't make me sad at all.

329
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,775
It would be nice to remember her.

330
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,787
We're calling the operation
"Dropping the Dishes."

331
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,885
The three Humvees
equipped with the missiles

332
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,256
will be here, here, and here,

333
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,261
camo nets above 'em.

334
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:16,266
The target, gentlemen,
will be in the air.

335
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,199
It will be big.

336
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,636
Observation posts here
on the mountains for early warning.

337
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:26,643
Two men to each O.P.

338
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:44,761
We're gonna try to take
this thing down intact, sir?

339
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,417
That's the plan.

340
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,593
Once we get it down, sir,
how do we find these guys?

341
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,597
Y'all have seen the S-2 briefing video.
You know as much as I do.

342
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:32,075
All right, they can do some
pretty incredible things.

343
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:41,318
They've taken people through walls.

344
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:51,428
They can make you see things
that are not there.

345
00:28:56,367 --> 00:29:01,304
But no problem, right? We're the best.

346
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:12,082
Y'all are about to fight an enemy

347
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:33,770
the likes of which
no soldier has ever seen.

348
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:50,840
I can't tell you how it will go,

349
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,679
but I can tell you this...

350
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:57,278
you're about to earn
a place in history.

351
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:02,292
She's completely normal.

352
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:07,931
No fluctuation
in brain-wave pattern,

353
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:25,081
nothing in her blood chemistry.

354
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,856
Her biology is human.

355
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,867
Of course it is.

356
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:49,873
We won't find anything.

357
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:01,745
The part of her that isn't human
is capable of perfect mimicry.

358
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,614
Then what are we looking for?

359
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:09,619
I don't know.

360
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,817
SOLDIER: Any questions?

361
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:22,832
Is there anything we can do to
maximize our cone of fire, sir?

362
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,398
I'd aim for the center
of the damn thing and pray.

363
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,772
Any other questions?

364
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:36,780
Uh, General?

365
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,549
General.

366
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:40,913
I need to talk to you
about the little girl... Allie.

367
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:45,922
Something wrong?

368
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:50,819
Her powers are just
beginning to manifest.

369
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:55,832
We need to protect her
for further study.

370
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,263
So you're uncomfortable with
the notion of using her for bait.

371
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:04,069
Let's not think of this,
then, in terms of fishing.

372
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:09,079
In fishing, you put a worm on a hook,

373
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:16,519
fish bites the worm, takes the hook,
the worm's toast.

374
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:28,625
But this is hunting country,

375
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,667
so think of her
more as a... a salt lick.

376
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:35,672
A buck comes up to the salt,
boom, you shoot the buck.

377
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,299
No harm at all to the salt lick.

378
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,835
General, I, uh...

379
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:47,180
I think there's been
a miscommunication here.

380
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:52,188
A miscommunication. Really?

381
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,116
Yeah. See, um,

382
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,888
my understanding of the plan...

383
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:01,898
and I did design the plan...

384
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,261
an explosion is to be
detonated above the craft.

385
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:11,274
The effect is to bring
the ship down intact.

386
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,479
We're not trying to, uh, bag a buck,

387
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,945
as you so elegantly put it.

388
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:17,912
We're trying to collect
specimens for the zoo.

389
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:22,919
My orders are
to take down their craft

390
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:38,268
and to replace the craft
and the bodies you people lost

391
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:44,934
and, if possible,

392
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:49,946
to take the occupants
of the craft alive,

393
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:18,708
and if not, well, we'll have
more bodies to study.

394
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:31,688
This is an opportunity
to communicate with beings

395
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:41,164
from another world.

396
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,901
We're on the brink of the single
most important moment

397
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:50,634
in human history.

398
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:55,645
As far as I'm concerned,
we're at war.

399
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:02,352
These beings have taken
our citizens against their will,

400
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,713
they've invaded our air space,
our lives, even our gene pool.

401
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,781
These are unparalleled
acts of aggression.

402
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:12,795
We're at war here, fighting an enemy
we don't understand at all,

403
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:22,972
so I'll do whatever I have to do.

404
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:28,645
You guys think
these things will do the job?

405
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,945
You men are outclassed,
out-equipped,

406
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:42,959
and probably outnumbered.

407
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:47,029
Plan A, then, would be for
the missiles to do their job

408
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,397
and take these things
out of the sky.

409
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,665
Plan B would be for you
to stick your head

410
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:58,675
between your legs
and kiss your asses good-bye.

411
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:06,978
There is no plan C, gentlemen.

412
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:11,283
(laughter)

413
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:16,292
You know about
all the things they do?

414
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:20,991
The probes and stuff, man?

415
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:26,002
I hear they show you stuff
that'll rip your brain apart.

416
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:34,277
I heard one of these came down
in Nebraska two years ago...

417
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,876
took a squad

418
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:42,385
and wiped them off
the face of the earth.

419
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:47,049
I think this is some sort
of training exercise

420
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,787
in psychological warfare,

421
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:55,798
to see how we do with
an impossible situation.

422
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:04,338
- You saying there aren't any aliens?
- That's what I'm saying.

423
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,205
You've all seen
the S-2 briefing videos.

424
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,677
I saw the alien autopsy video, too.

425
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,442
Dude, that was awesome.

426
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,607
That looked more real
than any of our stuff.

427
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,672
I met this guy once, special ops,
had to debrief these two marines

428
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,345
that were taken right through
their barracks walls.

429
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,288
Showed up a couple hours later
with scars all over their bodies.

430
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:25,295
They were never right again.

431
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,633
See, it's drug tests.

432
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,672
Chemical warfare,
something like that.

433
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,798
We're not fighting any aliens.
We're like lab rats being tested.

434
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,068
You don't think we're gonna
storm a flying saucer?

435
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,168
Tried to get
my head around it, but, no.

436
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,338
I think this is some very deep,
weird zone of "don't ask."

437
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:48,351
Either way, we're toast.

438
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:51,615
Ah! Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

439
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:56,626
(all chuckle)

440
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:01,731
I've got this thing
about roaches, all right?

441
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:07,270
(laughter)

442
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:13,643
And this is the man
who's going to save the world

443
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,147
from the alien menace.

444
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,739
(laughter)

445
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,344
Back to work.

446
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:28,358
"They judged it was him, anyway.

447
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:54,909
"Said this drowned man
was just his size

448
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:59,149
"and was ragged
and had uncommon long hair,

449
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:02,454
"which was all like pap.

450
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,994
"But they couldn't make nothin'
out of the face,

451
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,088
"because it had been
in the water so long.

452
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,794
"Weren't much like a face at all.

453
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:16,636
"They said he was floating
on his back in the water.

454
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:21,644
"They took him
and buried him on the bank.

455
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,256
"But I weren't comfortable long

456
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:41,264
"because I happened
to think of somethin'.

457
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:50,139
"I knowed mighty well
that a drowned man

458
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,442
"don't float on his back,
but on his face.

459
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,181
So I knowed then
that this weren't pap."

460
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:43,192
This isn't getting too scary, is it?

461
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,160
It's good. I like it.

462
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,703
I remember
I would picture that river.

463
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,830
When I imagined it,

464
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,601
it was all kind of dark and mossy,

465
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,734
trees hanging down and stuff.

466
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,244
Not like those pictures you see
of Tom and Huck fishing.

467
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,645
Oh, I'd get so scared, but I liked it, too.

468
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:05,511
And my mom would
get under the covers with me

469
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,778
and read these parts.

470
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,318
She was nice, your mom.

471
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,616
Yeah, she was.

472
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,418
My mom, too.

473
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,616
My mom's great.

474
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,626
You want me to go on?

475
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:21,427
Yes, please.

476
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:21,964
"We played robber
now and then about a month,

477
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:25,058
"and I resigned.

478
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,501
"All the boys did.

479
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:28,731
"We hadn't robbed nobody,
hadn't killed any people,

480
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,137
"but only just pretended.

481
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,607
"We used to
hop out of the woods

482
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,200
"and go charging down
on hog drovers.

483
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,905
"Women in carts taking
garden stuff to market...

484
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,211
we never hogged any of 'em."

485
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,410
(chuckling)
I appreciate that, Colonel.

486
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:44,511
I thought with the history our families
have shared over the years,

487
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,318
you could give me
an off-the-record location.

488
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,222
Yeah, I understand what
"need-to-know basis" means,

489
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,490
you jackass.

490
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,723
We need your help.

491
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:58,257
Come in.

492
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,097
Please, come in. Sit down.

493
00:43:59,169 --> 00:43:59,726
Close the curtains.

494
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,565
You don't have to worry.
No one's coming here.

495
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,401
What do you mean?

496
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,703
I work for them, Charlie.

497
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,709
I was the one who called them.

498
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:10,304
You told them about Allie.

499
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,440
Lisa...

500
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,451
Just tell me where she is.

501
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,043
Please, Harriet, tell me
where they took Allie.

502
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,486
I don't know. I tried to call them.

503
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:19,021
All the numbers I've been given
are disconnected.

504
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:19,885
I have no way of finding them.

505
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,481
We trusted you,
everyone in the group.

506
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,651
We put our trust in you,
and you betrayed it.

507
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:28,664
They told me I was helping.

508
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:37,807
They told me they had proof
that people who had been taken

509
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:03,799
were in greater danger
than they knew. I thought...

510
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,436
You thought you were helping?!

511
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:18,447
You told them Charlie was here,
you told them Allie was with us,

512
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:25,588
and now they have her!

513
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:38,901
Lisa, I am so sorry.

514
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:45,634
I want you to put me back under.

515
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:50,203
Allie and I, we have this link.

516
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,217
Yes, I believe that's real.

517
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:09,632
In regression,
I've had those moments

518
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:17,807
where I feel Allie,

519
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:54,176
where I get that sense
of knowing where she is.

520
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,696
Yes.

521
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,833
I've been experiencing
things like that again

522
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,879
since they took Allie.

523
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,278
I keep getting this sense of knowing
where she is and what she's doing.

524
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,285
It's very strong. l...

525
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:10,911
I want you to help me find her.

526
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:11,545
We'd have to go pretty deep.

527
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,487
We've gone there before,

528
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,286
but frankly, Lisa,
I'm a little over my head here.

529
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,759
Can you help me get there?

530
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:18,556
We're dealing with something
that I don't fully understand.

531
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:22,622
Even if I am able
to access it...

532
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,894
hypnosis of this sort
can be very dangerous.

533
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,368
Are you sure
you're ready for that?

534
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,496
I'll go wherever I have to
if I can get my daughter back.

535
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,041
You have to do this for me.

536
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,371
You owe me that much.

537
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:37,277
ALLIE: <i>Most of</i>
<i>the fights people have</i>

538
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,315
<i>are about something simple</i>...

539
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,580
<i>you want something</i>
<i>the other person has,</i>

540
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:42,948
<i>or maybe they're afraid</i>
<i>you're going to want it,</i>

541
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,421
<i>and they go after you first.</i>

542
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,583
<i>People always think that if they win,</i>

543
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,650
<i>then that's the end,</i>

544
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,888
<i>everything will be all right</i>
<i>from then on.</i>

545
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,431
<i>But everything changes,</i>

546
00:48:55,499 --> 00:49:00,436
<i>and tomorrow, the thing</i>
<i>you were fighting for</i>

547
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,704
<i>will just be a memory.</i>

548
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,471
<i>Like everything else,</i>
<i>it's already happened.</i>

549
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,034
They're ready to take
the shield off, doctor.

550
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:13,173
What we're going to do
is extremely delicate.

551
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,717
It would be easier for
Lisa and me to find a way in

552
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:19,154
if there wasn't
anyone else in the room.

553
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:24,159
It's all right.

554
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:31,632
And a third deep breath...

555
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,967
Now I want you to go to that place
where you and Allie find each other.

556
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:38,769
Can you find it for me?

557
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:42,334
(inhales deeply)

558
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,539
Yes.

559
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:45,808
SOLDIER: "And so we would lay
in ambuscade,

560
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:50,819
"as he called it,

561
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:57,987
"and kill the lot
and scoop the things.

562
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:02,998
"He said we must
slick up our swords and guns

563
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:22,780
and get ready."

564
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:23,342
Okay, I'm going to take
this thing off your head

565
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:23,977
in just a moment.

566
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,646
Now, it's not very bright in here,

567
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:26,984
but it may hurt your eyes
at first, okay?

568
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,684
Okay.

569
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,694
Okay.

570
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,060
Now what do you see?

571
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:34,597
Darkness.
All I see is darkness.

572
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,359
l... I can make out something.

573
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,630
LISA: There are people watching.

574
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,433
It doesn't feel good.

575
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:45,566
There are all these people.

576
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:46,040
They're waiting
for something to happen.

577
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:46,905
They want something.

578
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,343
They're waiting for something.

579
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,573
Do you know where you are?

580
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,980
It looks like a hospital...

581
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:54,745
but it's not.

582
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,911
It smells kind of moldy...

583
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,579
it's like an attic.

584
00:50:58,655 --> 00:50:58,916
DR PENZLER: Now what do you see?

585
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,457
Ugh!

586
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:06,360
But I don't know if it'll happen.

587
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,024
There's a lot of anger here
and a lot of fear.

588
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,124
Lisa... Lisa.

589
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,761
Charlie?

590
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,327
I don't know if they're
gonna get what they want,

591
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,565
but I know they're
going to keep her.

592
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,868
They're going to keep her
until they get what they want.

593
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,909
So what happens now?

594
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,307
We wait.

595
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:26,315
How long should we wait?

596
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:39,423
I don't know.

597
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,622
You believe they'll come?

598
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,756
Absolutely.

599
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,095
But then again,
I believe a lot of things.

600
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:44,826
He threatens to become
a major pain in the ass.

601
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,233
NINA: If they went for Dr. Penzler,
they'll be coming for you next.

602
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:52,241
I don't care about that.

603
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:56,774
All I care about is finding Allie.

604
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:57,609
Where is she?

605
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:01,208
I was with her in this room. It's...

606
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,080
it's a room.

607
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:02,948
Uh... Bare walls,
peeling wallpaper,

608
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,315
like a... farm.

609
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,723
Why a farm?

610
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,820
The way the room
looks and... feels.

611
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:18,527
(sighs)

612
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,469
Something on the wall...
license plates...

613
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:26,475
old, rusted license plates

614
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,679
and a calendar with a picture
of a tractor on it.

615
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,079
There were all these people.

616
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:38,087
A man I saw the time
they tried to pick me up,

617
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:46,695
but there was someone
in uniform...

618
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,699
You said there were
license plates on the wall?

619
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,671
Yeah, old ones.

620
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,365
What state?

621
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,377
Let me think.

622
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:07,245
North...

623
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:12,254
North...

624
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,754
North Dakota! North Dakota!

625
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,417
That's a start.

626
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,688
North Dakota and a farmhouse

627
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,390
doesn't exactly
narrow it down that much.

628
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,830
Wallington's Feed and Grain.

629
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,837
Wallington's Feed and Grain!

630
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:34,406
The calendar on the wall!
That was the name of the place!

631
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:34,875
North Dakota.
I don't know what city.

632
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:35,741
The listing's for
Wallington's Feed and Grain.

633
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:40,749
You're sure?

634
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,249
Nothing.

635
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:51,260
In the whole state
of North Dakota, there's nothing.

636
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,395
Ask yourselves,

637
00:53:55,465 --> 00:54:00,402
what would Maddie Hayes
and David Addison do?

638
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,885
And they say that watching
five hours of TV a day

639
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,951
for 26 years is a bad thing.

640
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,894
<i>This intelligence is of</i>
<i>an other-than-human form.</i>

641
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:32,901
<i>They let us see what they</i>
<i>want us to see, nothing more.</i>

642
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:41,402
<i>Your govemment knows this.</i>

643
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:45,608
<i>Gulf Breeze, Exeter, Dayton</i>...

644
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:48,981
I love this guy.
He believes in everything.

645
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,316
The scary part is how often
he comes close to the truth.

646
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,789
<i>... our govemment has been</i>
<i>involved in a massive conspiracy</i>

647
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:58,316
<i>to cover this up.</i>

648
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:02,161
<i>Call me and tell me your story.</i>
<i>This is William Jeffries.</i>

649
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,427
<i>Talk to me, and I'll talk to you.</i>

650
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,991
<i>Oh, hi. This is Theresa,</i>
<i>from Pocatello, Idaho,</i>

651
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,469
<i>and I just have to tell you,</i>
<i>I'm so glad you're here,</i>

652
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:11,996
<i>because I was abducted</i>
<i>last September...</i>

653
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:16,910
Snack time.

654
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,211
<i>I tried to talk to everybody about this.</i>
<i>I tried the govemment</i>...

655
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:25,220
I live on bad coffee

656
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:51,613
and stale Oreos
from the vending machine.

657
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:58,287
THERESA: <i>Thank God</i>
<i>you're on the air.</i>

658
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,985
(telephone rings)

659
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:09,998
Yes?

660
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,637
Little girl's light just came back on.

661
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,695
North Dakota, Benson County,
just outside of Brinsmade.

662
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:17,705
- Program worked.
- Thank you.

663
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,469
ALLIE: <i>My mother used</i>
<i>to sing to me a lot,</i>

664
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:23,535
<i>folk songs mostly,</i>

665
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,012
<i>and things she liked</i>
<i>when she was a little girl.</i>

666
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:28,642
<i>There was this one song</i>
<i>called</i> Further Along

667
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:32,085
<i>that always made me</i>
<i>feel better when I was sad.</i>

668
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:37,092
<i>"Further along,</i>
<i>we'll know more about it.</i>

669
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:41,158

<i>We'll understand it all,</i>
<i>by and by."</i>

672
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:43,298
<i>When you get to wondering</i>
<i>too much about things,</i>

673
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,960
<i>a song like that can really help a lot.</i>

674
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,502
When we find her,
she's gonna want that.

675
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,505
She'll be glad you brought it.

676
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,871
Thanks for the book.

677
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:57,003
Well, I figured now that you
had that thing off,

678
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,104
you could read it for yourself
if you wanted.

679
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:03,118
I was kind of hoping you would
keep reading it to me.

680
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:08,080
Sure. I mean, I'd like that.

681
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:13,095
Me, too.

682
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,190
Can I ask you something?

683
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,667
Sure.

684
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:24,673
Are they really
gonna come and get you?

685
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,641
I don't know.

686
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:33,648
Probably something like that.

687
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:45,526
That sure will be something to see.

688
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:50,532
"Well, three or four months
run along,

689
00:57:55,104 --> 00:58:00,041
"and it was well
into the winter now.

690
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:23,656
"I'd been to school

00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:27,430
"and could spell and read
and write just a little

692
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,596
"and could say
the multiplication table...

693
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,501
Just before it gets dark

694
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:30,664
When the light
still hangs in the sky

695
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,605
The day's not quite come

696
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,109
All its promises
still in your own eyes

697
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:35,576
Between the time
your mother calls

698
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,613
Thanks.

699
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,908
And the time
you put the ball away

700
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:39,346
SOLDIER: "But before the cold
weather, I used to slide out...

701
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,349
There's a lifetime to be lived

702
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:46,354
And a world where every dream
is here to stay

703
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:47,180
Just before the night comes

704
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:52,194
And you run back
to the safety of your world

705
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:52,728
You're sure you've never heard of it...
Wallington Feed and Grain?

706
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,763
No, I'm sorry.

707
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,628
Just before it gets time

708
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,360
Are you folks asking about Wallington?

709
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,867
Yeah.

710
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,905
Harry Wallington, he went bust in '75.

711
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:04,769
'75?

712
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,172
Had a place up in Brinsmade.

713
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:11,179
I used to stop in on my way
back from fishing with my boys.

714
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:13,546
Good prices, quality products.

715
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,015
What's a couple of young folks
doing asking about a store

716
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,608
that went under when
you were still in diapers?

717
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,710
Thanks.

718
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,517
Thanks a lot.

719
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,251
Well, nothin' lasts forever

720
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:27,262
But those moments
keep forever far away

721
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:30,792
You didn't mention
that it was an old calendar.

722
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:34,997
Sorry, my super-vision's
a little rusty.

723
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:35,435
We're gonna find her, Lisa.

724
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:35,937
We're going to Brinsmade.

725
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:36,903
Are you from there?

726
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,600
No. We're visiting a sick cousin.

727
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:43,612
Brinsmade's been evacuated.

728
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,482
You'll find your family member
at the high-school gym in Leeds.

729
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,423
Evacuated? Why?

730
00:59:57,493 --> 01:00:02,430
Toxic spill. A truck collided with a train.

731
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,298
What kind of spill?

732
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,767
They don't tell me. They just tell me
to keep the cars out.

733
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,269
You're not afraid you're
standing downwind of something?

734
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:10,329
You folks turn around
and do like I said.

735
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:14,103
You'll find your
family member in Leeds.

736
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:22,908
Move along. Let's go.

737
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:27,923
Hold on tight

738
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,917
And I promise you, baby

739
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,861
It'll all be all right

740
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:38,390
I promise you, baby

741
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:43,405
It'll all be all right

742
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:15,170
Okay, so where are they?

743
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,442
I mean, they took that thing
off the little girl's head last night,

744
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,718
so where are they?

745
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:39,728
When I was in Afghanistan last year.
This was all we did... sit and wait.

746
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:02,951
Come out and kill me already.
I don't care.

747
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:33,915
Don't make me sit here
and think about what might happen.

748
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:43,792
You would have been lost
at the Alamo, my friend.

749
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:57,672
Day one of that siege,

750
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:22,025
I'd have been the first one
over that wall.

751
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,622
So what's the deal
with the little girl, Pierce?

752
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:28,636
I mean, you been with her.

753
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:34,042
She's special.

754
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:39,047
Well, what's so special about her?

755
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:45,453
You have to be in the room with her.

756
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:50,792
You guys are gonna think
this is really weird...

757
01:03:55,731 --> 01:04:00,668
We're in a field waiting for
a flying saucer to land.

758
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:05,536
How weird could anything
you tell us be?

759
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,405
I've told you guys about my mom,

760
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,000
what a good cook she was,
the cookies she used to bake.

761
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:13,538
We have heard the tales.

762
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,948
My mom died in 1998.

763
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,077
And you start to lose 'em
after they die...

764
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:22,090
your loved ones.

765
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,217
I mean, their memories just...

766
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:28,753
start to fade in your head.

767
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:33,029
I don't mean events...
I remember birthdays,

768
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:36,230
picnics, everything like that.

769
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:39,433
I mean, your actual
mental picture of the person.

770
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:44,445
I'm reading to Allie,

771
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,173
just helping her pass the time.

772
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,774
She's just a scared little kid,

773
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,648
and she misses her mom,

774
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:55,657
just like I miss mine.

775
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,577
The book I'm reading,

776
01:06:57,246 --> 01:07:02,183
it's something my mom
used to read to me.

777
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:18,733
It's just like
my mom's there with us,

778
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:28,666
that's all I'm trying to say.

779
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:32,145
And you attribute this
somehow to the little girl?

780
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:37,151
I'm just saying,
you have to be there with her.

781
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:44,625
You can't put it into words,

782
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,762
but if you spend some time
with her, you'll get it.

783
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,899
I can promise you that.

784
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:03,103
Thank you.

785
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,168
Sorry about how
all this worked out.

786
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,770
If you guys want to go
hunting in a couple of weeks,

787
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,907
they should have
the spill cleaned up.

788
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:08,711
There was no toxic spill.
I can tell you that.

789
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:11,116
How the hell you know that?

790
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:16,124
Because I worked
that railroad 19 years.

791
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,530
You know what they haul
on those lines?

792
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:34,065
Lumber and steel.

793
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:39,080
Nothing but lumber and steel.

794
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,148
Now, I'm up there
at Cranberry Lake

795
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:46,347
with Michael and Tony,

796
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:51,359
and I'm trying to explain
a little of my philosophy

797
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,625
of life in the woods.

798
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:59,634
A couple of fellas
up from Grand Forks

799
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:05,035
desperate to kill something
before the weekend is over,

800
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:06,904
and I'm trying to explain that

801
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,377
that's not really what
hunting's all about.

802
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,040
Is this a story
that goes someplace,

803
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:18,052
or is this "Dewey's
Meaning of Life, Part 7"?

804
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:22,384
The point is, the three of us
are sitting around the campfire

805
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:26,656
and I'm explaining my philosophy,

806
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,323
and this Humvee pulls up,
a bunch of soldiers get out

807
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:34,335
and tell us to head on
back to civilization.

808
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,469
On account of the spill.

809
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:42,670
A toxic spill...
if there had been one...

810
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,612
they might have told us
to evacuate the area

811
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,670
and then gone on
about their business.

812
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,273
Not this bunch.

813
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:53,287
They just stood there

814
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:02,096
the whole time
it took us to strike camp,

815
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:17,845
and then they damn near
followed us

816
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:35,463
all the way out of the woods.

817
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:41,068
Excuse me.

818
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:46,941
I'm looking for a Mr. Clayton.

819
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,418
- Over there.
- That's him?

820
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:10,431
Thanks.

821
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:17,905
You're Mr. Clayton?

822
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:22,977
(laughs)

823
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,919
That would be my dad.
I'm Dewey.

824
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:34,785
We'd like to hire your services.

825
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:39,794
Oh, you lookin' for a guide?

826
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,264
We were told
that you're the best.

827
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:55,276
And you two want to go huntin'?

828
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:24,171
In a way, yes.

829
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,298
Well, you're out of luck.
We're shut down.

830
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,637
Damn government's locked us
out of our own woods.

831
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:28,972
We know that.

832
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:30,841
But you've got some reason

833
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,175
you want to go up in there, anyway?

834
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,841
Why don't you step
into my office?

835
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,976
Now what have we got
out in those woods

836
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:41,989
that you two are so anxious
to go huntin' for?

837
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:46,320
Our daughter.

838
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:59,991
She's lost in the woods?

839
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:05,005
No. She...

840
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:37,304
The army has her.

841
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:42,910
Would this have anything to do

842
01:14:55,324 --> 01:15:00,261
with that toxic spill
that didn't happen?

843
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,606
Yeah.

844
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:17,611
And your daughter, you say?

845
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:24,018
That gear back there belongs
to a couple of young killers

846
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:29,623
I had out this morning.

847
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,356
I promised to ship it to 'em
so they could put it in storage.

848
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:35,828
I sure don't think they'll be back.

849
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:39,026
It'll just sit in the garage
with the exercycle

850
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:43,834
and the cross-country skis
and the racquetball rackets.

851
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,703
Might as well put it
to some use before then.

852
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:47,298
It'll get down pretty low tonight,

853
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,504
but you get in them
sleeping bags right away,

854
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:55,516
you'll survive.

855
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,118
There's only one farm
out this way.

856
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:05,125
Nobody's lived there
for 25 years,

857
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,655
so if they're keepin' her
anywhere around here,

858
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,324
that'll be the place.

859
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,337
Now...

860
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:22,003
I take out all kinds of folks...

861
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:27,014
hunters, what have you.

862
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:46,767
There's a lot
of different game up here.

863
01:16:55,978 --> 01:17:00,915
But if I'm lookin' at grouse,

864
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:12,987
then I have to go in
with a whole different set-up

865
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:17,794
than if I'm lookin' at deer or elk.

866
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:22,803
Now, you don't have to be
in a rush to tell me anything,

867
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:31,078
but at some point, you're
gonna have to let me know

868
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:36,684
just exactly what it is
that I'm gonna be lookin' at.

869
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:47,361
Oh...

870
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:53,233
just bend these
and give 'em a shake.

871
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:58,572
Good night.

872
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,902
Good night.

873
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:07,915
I guess we'd better
get in our bags.

874
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:16,724
They're not gonna
do anything to her, Lisa.

875
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:27,668
She's too important to them.

876
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:32,532
Just before it gets dark

877
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:37,544
Before you grow

878
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:38,138
Before you're
too old to pretend

879
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:48,549
Just before it gets dark

880
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:53,686
And you know your dreams
will not come back again

881
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:55,017
Hold on

882
01:19:55,090 --> 01:20:00,027
Hold on tight

883
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,901
And I promise you, baby

884
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:13,907
It'll all be all right

885
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,304
I promise you, baby

886
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:18,244
It'll all be all right

887
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,302
(crying)

888
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:24,318
Williams.

889
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:27,850
Williams, you asleep?

890
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:32,121
Not anymore.

891
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,788
Keel's got the night watch
on the little girl.

892
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:48,342
He's gonna let us in
to take a look. You in?

893
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:56,083
Yeah.

894
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:34,855
All right.

895
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:18,955
Let's go.

896
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:23,964
This is really dumb.
This is a court-martial.

897
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:31,071
We'll be in and out
in ten minutes.

898
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:39,576
- No one's gonna get court-martialed.
- Is that right?

899
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:43,674
This kid's gonna bring these guys
down from outer space.

900
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:46,118
The least we can do
is look her in the eye.

901
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:47,484
Hi.

902
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,682
We were just
kind of wondering...

903
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,589
What the big deal was.

904
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:53,388
Yeah, pretty much.

905
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:57,090
I'm not quite sure.

906
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:58,826
I'm important to the...

907
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,494
do you guys
call them aliens?

908
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:06,029
Yeah, usually.

909
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:06,664
Okay, the aliens.

910
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:08,208
And your general figures
they'll come get me.

911
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:09,470
We kind of know that already.

912
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:14,481
How come <i>you're</i>
so special to them?

913
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:18,047
They're my other family.

914
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:19,984
What do you mean?

915
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:22,319
I'm part them.

916
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:26,986
For real?

917
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,860
But you just look like a little kid.

918
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:30,590
Maybe they're not
as different as you think.

919
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:33,600
ALLIE: Can I ask you something?

920
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:36,000
Sure.

921
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:40,508
Are you mad at them?

922
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:42,338
But you'll fight with them
just the same?

923
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:48,115
That's our job.

924
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:52,919
Grownups are weird.

925
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:54,011
36 hours... nothing from
Cheyenne Mountain,

926
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:59,026
nothing from NORAD,
nothing in the sky.

927
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:06,665
Damn it!

928
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:10,363
I knew this whole thing
was a bust.

929
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:13,703
I'm a four-star general.

930
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,403
I've been serving my country
for 30 years,

931
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:21,415
now I'm sitting in the middle
of Old McDonaldland

932
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:31,084
with a 9-year-old girl?

933
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:36,096
I'll tell you one thing...

934
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:41,124
I'm gonna have that
squirrelly-ass Dr. Wakeman

935
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:44,330
served up on a platter for this.

936
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:49,342
I'm not gonna be
the only one taking this fall.

937
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:59,019
You want to tell me
what the hell went wrong?

938
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:10,363
Oh, you got a theory, don't you?

939
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:16,903
They're up in their craft
worried about this girl,

940
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,803
and as soon as you take
that thing off her head,

941
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:54,808
they're gonna come swooping down.

942
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:58,644
Well, we could have
been mistaken.

943
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:03,650
Well, that's big of you
to admit it.

944
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:11,054
General, we're talking
about aliens here.

945
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:15,494
By definition, their motives,
their behavior,

946
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:20,500
everything about them
would be... alien.

947
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:26,806
So how much longer
do we wait?

948
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:34,915
That's entirely up to you.

949
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:41,855
What's a five-letter word
for "idiot"?

950
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:43,850
This whole culture is built
on a fear of death.

951
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:48,862
No one wants to talk about it,

952
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,892
everyone wants to pretend
it's not gonna happen.

953
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:57,904
That's how come you get
those vegetarians

954
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:03,877
springing up all over the place.

955
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:09,513
"If I don't eat the little darlings,
then they're never gonna die."

956
01:28:09,584 --> 01:28:12,644
Nonsense.

957
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:17,453
Neither one of you has ever
been hunting, am I right?

958
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:19,789
I went out with some guys once
when I was maybe 14.

959
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:22,193
We were living in Wisconsin.

960
01:28:22,263 --> 01:28:27,200
I didn't like it.
It made me feel terrible.

961
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:34,642
Well, you're supposed
to feel terrible.

962
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:37,701
That's a part of it...

963
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:41,044
understanding what it costs
for you to stay alive.

964
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:46,052
Well, we better keep moving.

965
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:53,260
As it is, it'll be dark before
we get to where I think we...

966
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:58,958
(rustling)

967
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:03,970
That little girl of yours
must be something special.

968
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:09,476
- How are you?
- I'm all right, ma'am.

969
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:22,022
What you got up there?

970
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:27,427
Some sort of toxic spill, ma'am.

971
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:35,934
Ah, is that what they told you?

972
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:40,940
Yes, ma'am.

973
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:46,413
You'll have to let me through.
I need to see General Beers.

974
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:52,946
Do you have clearance?

975
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:57,957
Do you have any idea
what spilled up there?

976
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:06,299
No, ma'am, I don't.

977
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:50,043
You need to let me through.

978
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:06,491
I have important information
that General Beers is expecting.

979
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:11,498
You're not gonna
let me through, are you?

980
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:33,948
No, ma'am.

981
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,010
I didn't think so.

982
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:36,920
Next time, I'm just gonna
run through the roadblock,

983
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:41,928
so why don't you arrest me?

984
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:54,863
What?

985
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:59,879
Arrest me and have someone
take me to General Beers.

986
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:07,010
No one goes in.
We detain people here.

987
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:12,025
Okay, well, then detain me

988
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,825
and get General Beers
on the phone and let him know

989
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:19,833
that Mary Crawford has important
new information about the project.

990
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:23,736
I can't do that
without provocation, ma'am.

991
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,730
(sighs) I see.

992
01:32:27,808 --> 01:32:32,745
(clears throat)

993
01:32:41,422 --> 01:32:41,979
How's this?

994
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:43,387
They're not coming, are they?

995
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,785
Maybe they're not
that worried about her,

996
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:46,087
maybe they think she can
fight her own battles.

997
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:46,649
You don't know
when to quit, do you?

998
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:51,664
At the roadblock,

999
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:42,377
you told one of my soldiers
you had information for me.

1000
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:49,088
I lied.

1001
01:33:56,230 --> 01:34:00,098
You son of a bitch.

1002
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:04,866
Did you think I was just going
to let you take the project

1003
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:09,876
away from me,
you and the general here?

1004
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:22,555
You bastard.

1005
01:35:04,598 --> 01:35:06,759
You sold me out
the first chance you got.

1006
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:11,800
Worthless bastard!

1007
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,567
At the roadblock. Trunk.

1008
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:15,006
Put her somewhere
where she can't hurt anyone.

1009
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:17,840
MARY: Creep.

1010
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:22,246
It's a woman thing, right?

1011
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:27,253
They know how to hold a grudge.

1012
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:32,889
My father had this idea that
he could do dangerous things

1013
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,292
because they needed him,
that they'd keep him safe.

1014
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:40,299
Well, they took care of me
more than once.

1015
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:18,604
Because they needed us to, uh...

1016
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:21,599
to get together.

1017
01:36:21,675 --> 01:36:24,109
Because they needed Allie.

1018
01:36:24,178 --> 01:36:29,115
Exactly.

1019
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:30,810
So they're not gonna
let anything happen to her.

1020
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:32,477
We don't know that.
They're not gods, Charlie.

1021
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:37,490
No. We're outclassed enough,
so they can act like gods.

1022
01:36:39,193 --> 01:36:43,892
We don't know what they want
with Allie or why they did this.

1023
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:48,901
The odds are they didn't
go through all this trouble

1024
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:51,466
just so they could hand her
over to these people.

1025
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:56,476
I think she's gonna be all right.

1026
01:36:57,077 --> 01:36:57,566
I'm going to find Allie
and do whatever I can to help her.

1027
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:02,582
I'm not going to rely on them
for anything.

1028
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:17,563
Hey!

1029
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:23,136
Okay.

1030
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:29,165
I need to speak to Miss Crawford.

1031
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:33,907
This is for
Miss Crawford's ears only.

1032
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:38,918
You can wait over there.

1033
01:37:40,788 --> 01:37:42,847
SOLDIER: Yes, sir.

1034
01:37:42,923 --> 01:37:45,949
You peeked, didn't you?

1035
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:46,685
My grandfather
found it at Pine Lodge.

1036
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,226
At the crash site.

1037
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:48,693
I never thought your dad
was all that bright.

1038
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:51,162
It can be very effective
when a stupid person lies to you.

1039
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:53,826
I found some papers
with these images on them

1040
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:58,838
when we moved out
of Groom Lake.

1041
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:05,144
I asked your dad about them,

1042
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:13,252
he gave me nothing.

1043
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:15,680
I stood there with your father
and told him I was wrong

1044
01:38:15,756 --> 01:38:18,919
about the body
from the Roswell wreckage

1045
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:23,327
being the transmitter.
