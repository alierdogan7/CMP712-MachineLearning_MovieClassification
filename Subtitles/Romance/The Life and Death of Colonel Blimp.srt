1
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:44,124
Donhauer's just arrived, Spud.

2
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:46,962
- What's the ruddy idea?
- [Laughing]

3
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,000
Total war, isn't it?
What do you want?

4
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:54,303
- Message from H. Q Where's the C. O?
- In the barn. Follow me.

5
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,887
Message from headquarters, sir.

6
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,014
- Sergeant Hawkins.
- <i>Sir.</i>

7
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:14,453
Read it.

8
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,398
It's in code, sir.
Message begins:

9
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,094
"Exercise invasion
of the London area by regular army.

10
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,103
- Home Guard defending."
- Yeah.

11
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,196
"War starts at midnight."

12
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:27,241
Message ends.

13
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,573
The C.O.'s put in pencil here, sir:
"Make it like the real thing."

14
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,775
Oh, he has, has he?
Section commanders.

15
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:36,783
[Whistles]

16
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,886
Message from H. Q War starts at midnight.
You have your orders. Tell the men.

17
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,656
- Tell them to make it
like the real thing.
- What do you mean the real thing?

18
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,129
<i>Our losses divided by ten and</i>
<i>the enemy's multiplied by 20.</i>

19
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,929
- Yes, sir.
- That's all for now.

20
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,401
- Anything for me, sir?
- No, nothing else.

21
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,371
<i>[Men Shouting Orders]</i>

22
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,806
- The war starts at midnight. We know.
- They know.

23
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,366
- We attack.
- They counter attack.

24
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:06,709
Like the real thing,

25
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:09,011

<i>Sergeant Hawkins.</i>
<i>Section commanders.</i>

28
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:17,420
- So, war starts at midnight, does it?
- Sir.

29
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,722
We attack at 6:00.
Take all the tommy guns and three trucks.

30
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:23,992
Section leaders with tommy guns,
arm the men with bombs, rifles, bayonets.

31
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:27,262
- Tommy. From your section,
Rice, Unsworth...
- The two Owens?

32
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,701
- Yes. Nobby, Toots and Cochrane.
- Not Cochrane, sir.

33
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,330
I'll leave it to you. Stuffy, who are
the biggest toughs in your lot?

34
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:35,204
- Bill Wall, Wimpey, Madpan and Popeye.
- Yours, Robin?

35
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:38,370
- Frank, Skeets, Duggie Stewart, sir.
- Taffy, Geordie, sir.

36
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:40,505
Busty, Porky Simms
and Pat Sullivan, sir.

37
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:43,379
- Di Evans, sir.
- We must have him. All right. Get going.

38
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:46,909
Excuse me, sir. Did you say
we attack before war's declared?

39
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,479
Yes, like Pearl Harbor.
Now get going.

40
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,821
Oh, by the way.
There's just one stop. At the Bull.

41
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,054
I've got a date there
with Mata Hari.

42
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:57,164
- Careless talk?
- Yeah. Now scram.

43
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:58,062
- Careless talk?
- Yeah. Now scram.

44
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:16,246
Five minutes easy, Sergeant.

45
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,023
Five minutes easy, Stuffy.

46
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,692
I wonder what's keeping Spud.

47
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,736
Come on.

48
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:45,038
- Good afternoon, Sergeant Hawkins.
- Good afternoon, miss.

49
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:52,315
- Hey!
- <i>Everybody back on the trucks.</i>

50
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,560
Spud!

51
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:04,697
Spud.

52
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:08,826
Prop him up here.
Spud.

53
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:12,066
- What's the matter?
- Come on, sir, what happened?

54
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,073
- Spud! Who?
- She got me.

55
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:16,871
Mata Hari!
Come on, quick! Oh!

56
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,314
- Any luck?
- Not a hope.
She's halfway to London by now.

57
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:25,341
She's gone to warn the wizard. Come on,
get my tin hat. Come on, after her.

58
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,625
- The barricade's open, sir.
- Good. Damn.

59
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:39,359
You know, sir, you ought to have
one of these field dressings on that.

60
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:43,995
Save it for her. She'll need it
somewhere else when I catch up with her.

61
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:53,542
See that barricade, my boys?
Well, at midnight on the dot
it's going to be closed.

62
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:58,916
And of course the enemy
can't get through before.
Because why? Because...

63
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:02,046
[All Together]
War starts at midnight.

64
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,859
- What's the objective, sir?
- Royal Bathers' Club, Piccadilly.

65
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:10,453
- What about Mata Hari?
- We'll beat her to it.

66
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,761
I know a couple of shortcuts
after Marble Arch.

67
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,736
There she is! Get the other trucks
to close off. See if you can cross her.

68
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:26,846
<i>Blast that taxi!</i>

69
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,010
<i>Steady.</i>
<i>Keep right on his tail.</i>

70
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,311
Don't follow her.
Keep straight on.

71
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,516
Second left.
We've got her.

72
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,635
- Number One Section,
Number Two, Number Three.
- Yes, sir.

73
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,370
You have your orders.
Mr. Graves, Sergeant Hawkins.

74
00:08:57,445 --> 00:09:00,539
Yes, I...

75
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:02,673
- Is General Wynne-Candy in the club?
- No, sir.

76
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,116
The general left an hour ago
with Brigadier General Caldicott...

77
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:07,677
- and Air Vice Marshal Lloyd-Hughes.
- Did he say where he was going?

78
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,689
Excuse me, sir, but what
is your business with the general?

79
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,691
I have a message with him,
an urgent message.

80
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,693
If you give me the message,
I'll see the general gets it.

81
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,891
- Damn it all, man.
Are you in the Home Guard?
- Why, sir?

82
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:20,525
The password
is Veuve Cliquot 1911.

83
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:24,434
The general and his staff
are in the Turkish bath, sir.

84
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:27,804
[Blows Whistle] Sergeant Hawkins,
you're in charge up here. Stay with him.

85
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,105
Don't leave your desk or answer
the telephone. You're a prisoner.

86
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:33,544
- The war doesn't start till midnight.
- That's what you think.

87
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,777
Sergeant, that girl under the desk there.
She's a prisoner too.

88
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:39,081
- Corporal, leave these men with me.
- All right, boys, this is it.

89
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:43,681
- Brute force and ruddy ignorance.
- Come on, after him. Double up.

90
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:47,883
- [Phone Buzzing]
- You're a prisoner.

91
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,362
- Who are you?
- Don't argue. Guard this man.

92
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:54,265
- And answer that damn telephone.
- Yes, miss? Wanted a Wynne-Candy?

93
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:57,771
Can't do that, miss.

94
00:09:57,838 --> 00:10:01,069
Sorry, miss, the general's
a prisoner and so are you.

95
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,667
Oh, not till the war's over.

96
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,746
<i>[Chattering, Clamoring]</i>

97
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,257
Quiet!

98
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:20,384
- Any sign of him?
- No, not here.

99
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:24,056
- Are you the ringleader of this outrage?
- Quiet, please!

100
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:27,294
This is an army exercise. You're all
prisoners. Now stay where you are.

101
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:29,928
- Attendant, come here.
Where's General Wynne-Candy?
- Who, sir?

102
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,872
- You heard.
Come on, show me the way. Go on.
- In the steam room.

103
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,541
This is it.

104
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,957
Sir?

105
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,958
- Sir.
- Go away.

106
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,292
General Wynne-Candy.

107
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,962
Eh?
What? Who is it?

108
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,030
Lieutenant Wilson, sir.
Second Battalion, the Devonshires, sir.

109
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:11,476
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- Well, sir. I'm afraid, sir, we've...

110
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:16,005
Well, say it, man. Say it.
I've no time to waste.

111
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,746
- [Chuckling] Oh, yes, you have, sir.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

112
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,015
You've got all night, sir.

113
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,252
- Attendant!
- I'm afraid he can't come.

114
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,363
- Why?
- He's a prisoner, sir.

115
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,264
What's going on here?

116
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:35,666
- Invasion, sir.
- [Scoffs]

117
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:40,605
But, you damned young idiot,
war starts at midnight.

118
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:44,337
- <i>Haven't you been told?</i>
- Oh, yes, sir. That's why we're here.

119
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:48,006
But may I ask on what authority?

120
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,209
On the authority of these guns
and these men, sir.

121
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:53,515
Authority?
Authority?

122
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,579
How dare you, sir?
How dare you?

123
00:11:56,657 --> 00:12:00,616
Get out of here, sir, you and your gang
of awful militia gangsters!

124
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:03,720
- Get out!
- Popeye, guard this man.

125
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:06,823
Stuffy, go to the cubicles.
Find which is General Wynne-Candy's.

126
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,063
- You'll find a brown
pigskin case there. Bring it.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:14,797
But you can't do that.
The code is in that case.

128
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,435
The whole exercise will be a farce
if you have that code.

129
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:20,071
Oh, no, sir. This is going to be
the real thing, sir.

130
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:25,278
- But war starts at midnight.
- <i>Oh, yes, you say war starts at midnight.</i>

131
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:27,320
How do you know
the enemy says so too?

132
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:31,222
But, my dear fellow,
that was agreed, wasn't it?

133
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,226
<i>Agreed, my foot.</i>

134
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,161
How many agreements have been kept
by the enemy since this war started?

135
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,290
We agree to keep to the rules of the game
and they go on kicking us in the pants.

136
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,630
When I joined the army,
the only agreement I entered into...

137
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:44,000
was to defend my country
by every means at my disposal.

138
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:46,369
Not only by the national
sporting club rules,

139
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,273
- but by every means that have
existed since Cain slugged Abel.
- <i>Stop it.</i>

140
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:51,311
Don't we know that they're counting
on us to keep to the rules?

141
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:54,142
- <i>Stop it. Stop it!</i>
- That they openly boast about it?
That they laugh at us?

142
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:58,315
Lieutenant...

143
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,081
Watson,
or whatever your name is,

144
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:05,319
you are not in Hyde Park
with an audience of loafers.

145
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:08,953
I am Major General Wynne-Candy.

146
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,497
These other gentlemen
have all seen service,

147
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:14,125
<i>distinguished service</i>
<i>with the British Army.</i>

148
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:18,467
All I can say, sir, is when Napoleon
said an army marched on its stomach...

149
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,473
I'd better stop, sir.

150
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,745
You're an extremely
impudent young officer,

151
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:31,718
but let me tell you that in 40 years'
time, you'll be an old gentleman too.

152
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:36,188
And if your belly keeps pace
with your head, you'll have
a bigger one than any of us.

153
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,781
Maybe I shall in 40 years,
but I doubt it.

154
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,327
And I doubt if I'll have time
to grow a mustache like yours, sir.

155
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:46,389
But in 1983, at least I shall
be able to say that 40 years ago
I was a fellow of enterprise.

156
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,796
I'll punch your head for that,
young fellow. You young puppy.

157
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,274
Put 'em up. Take that.
I'll beat you.

158
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,643
Think you can say what you like
to an old one, do you?

159
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,649
Do you know how many wars

Of course, sir.
He's the most awful little rat.

273
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,103
He was spying for us
and spying for the Boers.

274
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,332
He made South Africa
too hot for himself and skipped.

275
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:42,398
Both sides would've shot him
if they'd caught him.

276
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,739

to do about it?

- My dear boy.

- Yes.

Not now.

Yes, one. A student.

my ex-employer. He is a <i>Burschenschafter.</i>

- You know what <i>Burschenschafts</i> are?
- No, Miss Hunter.

344

They are associations of students
professing political principles.

345
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,452
They assert them by drinking beer
and fighting duels.

346
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:56,518
- Dueling is very popular here, I believe.
- Oh, yes.

347
00:25:56,596 --> 00:26:00,498
It's a proud father that has
a scarred son and vice versa.

German girls find scars
very attractive.

349

A book was recently published
on the German colonies
in which it was specifically stated...

350
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,031
that one of the advantages
of possessing dueling scars was...

351
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,079
that the natives of Africa
look with more respect upon
a white man who bears them...

352
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:17,310
- than upon those who do not.
- I feel like Stanley and Livingston.

It is understood that an officer

cannot demand satisfaction
from an opponent who is not
his equal in position and honor.

But since this
Clive Candy is an officer,

Oh, undoubtedly, sir.

545
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:13,008
Surely it's not suggested that Mr. Candy
should fight the whole officer corps.

546

They're drawing lots, sir, to decide
who is to have the honor...

- Yes, sir.

Miss Hunter, sir?
I believe I could.

558

that your reasons for coming
to Berlin were to see her, hmm?

560

- Morning. Slept well?
- Very.

He was still sleeping
when I called for him at the hotel.

- They forgot to wake me.
- Your nerves are all right, my boy.

- How do you do?

Oh.

Why wasn't I allowed any breakfast?

- 'Cause the book says not.
- It would.

Ah, you'll do.

621
00:45:30,302 --> 00:45:33,328
- Do you want this?
- I hope you've read it.

622
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:36,670
Miss Hunter read it. She says
it's a joke, good enough for punch.

623
00:45:36,742 --> 00:45:40,075
- Where is Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff?
- He hasn't shown up yet.

624
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:42,306
I congratulate you
on your pronunciation of the name.

625
00:45:42,381 --> 00:45:44,747
I learned it by heart
so that when my grandchildren say,

626
00:45:44,816 --> 00:45:47,478
"Grandpa, have you ever
cut anybody's ear off?"

627
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:51,318
I shall be able to say,
"Yes, Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff's."

I must of course use

and <i>halt</i> for stop.

- Can you memorize these two words?
- I'll try, sir.

634
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:12,870
Anyhow, at the beginning,
I'll be pretty sure that you mean start,

635
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:15,435
and during the combat,
you're not likely to say "start" again.

636
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:17,812
That is true.

637
00:46:17,883 --> 00:46:19,817

- Oh, I don't know.

- We drew lots for them.
- I hope mine's a nice light one.

Oh, that's splendid.
How is he?

716
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:36,278
He can neither hear nor speak.
It will be very difficult for a day or two
until we take the bandages off.

717
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:39,976
He has a fine cut.
His upper lip is very nearly severed.

718
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:43,748
It is really almost
ten centimeters in length.
A knife could not have done it better.

- Is he in great pain?
- Oh, but certainly.

720
00:54:47,091 --> 00:54:49,582
He is a very lucky man not to have
glass splinters in the wound.

721
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,289
- Glass splinters?
- It is a very common accident
in our winter.

And the little piece of slippery ice
lie in wait for the hurrying foot.

and come back with me.

790
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:57,134
- Great care must be taken of me.
- No doubt.

791
00:59:57,201 --> 00:59:59,465
<i>No answer at all.</i>
<i>Will you or won't you?</i>

792
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:01,471
<i>If you stay on,</i>
<i>you may get anotherjob.</i>

793
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:04,099
We'll see.
Are we going to play cards?

794
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:07,611
I've asked Nurse Erna to fix up a bridge
four. We don't want to get bored.

795
01:00:07,678 --> 01:00:12,115
<i>The head nurse is finding a suitable couple</i>
<i>for you to play with after dinner.</i>

796
01:00:12,183 --> 01:00:15,584
But you must not stay up
after 10:30 at the very latest.

797
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,712
- I promise you, Nurse Erna.
- You do play?

798
01:00:17,788 --> 01:00:21,724
- Only whist.
- It's simple. Let's have
a trial game of double dummy.

799
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:23,817
I will bring a lamp.

800
01:00:23,895 --> 01:00:27,422
<i>You're a good pupil, Edith.</i>
<i>That's 32,000 pounds I owe you.</i>

801
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,728
- <i>I'll toss you double or quits.</i>
- Agreed.

802
01:00:31,102 --> 01:00:34,196
- All right, what is it?
- Heads... No, I mean tails.

803
01:00:34,272 --> 01:00:37,764
Heads it is.
We're quits.

804
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:43,405
Here are cigarettes. But please do
remember that smoking is bad for you.

805
01:00:43,481 --> 01:00:46,882
- <i>Ich liebe Sie,</i> Nurse Erna.
- You are an angel, Nurse Erna.

806
01:00:46,951 --> 01:00:50,284
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- There are our guests.
Would you let them in?

807
01:01:12,343 --> 01:01:15,437
Frau von Kalteneck,
<i>Oberleutnant</i> Kretschmar-Schuldorff.

808
01:01:15,513 --> 01:01:17,447
Miss Hunter, Mr. Candy.

809
01:01:17,515 --> 01:01:19,449
<i>Ich hoffe Sie werden sich</i>
<i>gut unterhalten.</i>

810
01:01:19,517 --> 01:01:21,451
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

811
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:23,783
- Kretschmar-Schuldorff.
- Yes, I know.

812
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:27,483
- [Speaking German]
- <i>Danke sehr.</i>

813
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,049
I'm very glad you've come.

814
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:33,962
I promised Theo
to make a little speech.

815
01:01:34,031 --> 01:01:37,194
- He would like to have made it himself.
- Very much.

816
01:01:37,268 --> 01:01:40,032
Theo knows only
two English expressions:

817
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:42,572
"Very much" and "not very much."

818
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,336
- <i>Stimmt's, Theo?</i>
- Very much.

819
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:48,606
- He would like to have come before.
- Very much.

820
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:52,877
<i>Only he was afraid nobody</i>
<i>could translate to you what he says.</i>

821
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,009
Miss Hunter speaks German.

822
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,020
<i>She</i> sprechen <i>German.</i>

823
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,716
- <i>[Speaking German]</i>
- <i>Nicht sehr gut.</i>

824
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:03,385
<i>Ich finde Sie reden</i>
<i>ausgezeichnet.</i>

825
01:02:03,461 --> 01:02:07,261
Theo has heard that you were took part
in the South Africa campaign.

826
01:02:07,331 --> 01:02:09,765
- <i>Ja, ja.</i>
- And that you have won
a very famous medal.

827
01:02:09,834 --> 01:02:14,032
- <i>Ja,</i> Victoria... Uh. <i>Ja,</i> cross.
- Victoria Cross.

828
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:19,042
He envies you because
a German officer knows about war
only from the newspapers.

829
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,238
- And mostly wrongly.
- And mostly wrongly.

830
01:02:22,313 --> 01:02:25,646
- Let's have a drink, shall we? Sherry?
- I would love a glass of sherry.

831
01:02:25,716 --> 01:02:30,119
- Would you like sherry?
- Not very much.

832
01:02:30,187 --> 01:02:33,281
- Port?
- [Speaking German]

833
01:02:33,357 --> 01:02:35,882
She and I,
we drink "Kirchwater."

834
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,588
[Chuckling]
<i>Kirchwasser.</i>

835
01:02:38,663 --> 01:02:40,927
Yes, that's right. "Kirchwater."
Do you like it?

836
01:02:40,998 --> 01:02:43,125
Very, very much.

837
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,691
Let me help you.

838
01:02:53,678 --> 01:02:55,942
Do you know Berlin, Mr. Candy?

839
01:02:56,013 --> 01:02:59,505
The Hotel Kaiserhof, the British Embassy,
the Café

840
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:04,520
and the gymnasium
of the barracks of the Second Ulans.

841
01:03:04,588 --> 01:03:07,523
<i>I hope we shall be able</i>
<i>to show you more than that.</i>

842
01:03:07,591 --> 01:03:10,116
- <i>Eine Zigarette, Oberleutnant?</i>
- <i>Furchtbar nett. Danke sehr.</i>

843
01:03:10,194 --> 01:03:14,927
- Do you like the opera? Concerts?
- I prefer riding, hunting or polo.

844
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:18,059
I adore hunting,
and I love sports.

845
01:03:19,704 --> 01:03:21,638
<i>Interessieren Sie sich</i>
<i>für Sport, gnaedige Fraeulein?</i>

846
01:03:21,706 --> 01:03:23,765
<i>Nein, ich habe keinerlei Talent</i>
<i>für Sports.</i>

847
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,775
Cut for partners.

848
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,414
- You and I.
- <i>Sie und ich.</i>

849
01:03:31,482 --> 01:03:33,973
[Speaking German]

850
01:03:34,051 --> 01:03:37,145
- What's he say?
- I hope we shall be able
to play every night.

851
01:03:37,221 --> 01:03:40,418
- Oh, yes. Rather.
- Very much.

852
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:05,038
- I say.
- Oh, Babyface, I want you a moment.

853
01:04:05,116 --> 01:04:08,313
- What is it, those nursing home accounts?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

854
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,946
Would you kindly explain
what the deuce this item means?

855
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:13,854
- Forty packs of playing cards?
- Oh, that.

856
01:04:13,924 --> 01:04:15,858
It's enough for the casino
at Monte Carlo.

857
01:04:15,926 --> 01:04:18,554
I spoke to Miss Hunter about it.
But she says the evenings were so long...

858
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:22,656
- there's nothing much to do
at Stolpchensee in the winter.
- Very well.

859
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:25,463
- Don't you ever do any work?
- What?

860
01:04:25,536 --> 01:04:28,994
Oh, these. First time this year.
I draw it mild.

861
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:33,373
Well, don't catch a cold. These nursing
homes are an expensive business.

862
01:04:33,444 --> 01:04:35,742
- Is Miss Hunter returning to England?
- As far as I know.

863
01:04:35,813 --> 01:04:39,544
- Not at our expense, I hope.
- Good heavens, no. She was going anyway.

864
01:04:39,617 --> 01:04:42,643
- So was Candy, for that matter.
- I know.

865
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,984
He had a return ticket.
It's expired.

866
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,546
- Very well. Buy him a new one.
- Righto.

867
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:49,559
And get Candy to give you
that old ticket of his.

868
01:04:49,627 --> 01:04:51,561
We'll claim a refund at Cooks.

869
01:04:51,629 --> 01:04:55,827
Those things belong to Theo.
Put them with the alarm clock.

870
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,995
- How's your own packing going?
- Not fast.

871
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:02,004
Well, you'd better hurry up then.

872
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:04,199
- I'll be all right.
- <i>Don't you be so sure.</i>

873
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,937
<i>We've only got half an hour if we're</i>
<i>going to call at the embassy first.</i>

874
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:10,276
- Stop moving about.
- I'm not moving about!

875
01:05:10,347 --> 01:05:12,281
- <i>Keep your hair on.</i>
- [Sobbing]

876
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:15,182
I say, old girl, what's up?

877
01:05:15,252 --> 01:05:17,550
Edith, I say.
What's the matter?

878
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:20,089
It's not because I didn't call
for you yesterday, is it?

879
01:05:20,157 --> 01:05:23,126
- You know Frau von Kalteneck
left for the south last night.
- Did she?

880
01:05:23,194 --> 01:05:25,424
- You knew she was going?
- I'd forgotten.

881
01:05:25,496 --> 01:05:27,760
It's not my fault
if you don't like horses, is it?

882
01:05:27,832 --> 01:05:30,801
We went to see her riding stables.
She's got some fine beasts.

883
01:05:30,868 --> 01:05:34,929
They're a bit fat though.
I say, old girl. Do stop crying.

884
01:05:35,005 --> 01:05:38,441
- Supposing somebody came in.
- Nobody will come in.

885
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:40,636
<i>Look.</i>

886
01:05:43,013 --> 01:05:45,641
I promise to take you out
the first night we get back to London.

887
01:05:45,716 --> 01:05:47,650
Her Majesty's Theater,
<i>The Last of the Dandies.</i>

888
01:05:47,718 --> 01:05:50,243
They say
it's an awfully good show.

889
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,448
- But the papers say...
- What paper? What do you mean?

890
01:05:52,523 --> 01:05:54,457
Is that's what's making you cry?

891
01:05:54,525 --> 01:06:00,157
The papers say there was a play at
Her Majesty's called <i>Ulysses.</i> [Sobbing]

892

<i>[Door Opens]</i>

- Oh, I must hurry.
- You'd better. I'll meet you in the hall.

What am I to do with them?
I don't read German.
Miss Hunter got them for me.

898
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:24,184
- You can present them to our library.
- Clever, Nurse Erna.

899
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:27,850
But I must write my name in them
so Clive Candy's name...

I feel like a proud father.

01:09:49,126 --> 01:09:52,653
- <i>Do you, Clive? Why?</i>
- I have to give you away, don't I?

951
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,893
- Who told you?
- I told.
- In fluent double German.

952

<i>Das einzige Wort</i>

953
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:01,098
- Fiancé
- Fiancé

954
01:10:01,171 --> 01:10:03,036
A toast.

955
01:10:03,107 --> 01:10:06,508
Here's to the happiness of my fiancé
who was never my fiancé

956
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:10,104
And here's to the man
who tried to kill me
before he was introduced to me.

957
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,114
- <i>Prost.</i>
- <i>Prost.</i>

958
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:17,919
- May I kiss the bride?
- Why ask? I did not ask.

959
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:23,318
- Good-bye, Clive.
- Good-bye, Edith, old girl.

960
01:10:30,634 --> 01:10:33,034
I hope we'll meet again sometime.

961
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:34,866
I'm sure we shall.

962
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:41,535
Now, listen to me,
you son of a gun.

963
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,876
You won't understand a word
of what I'm going to say, but...

964
01:10:43,947 --> 01:10:49,647
<i>I came to Berlin to find a rat, and I found</i>
<i>two of the grandest people I've ever met.</i>

965
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:55,486
I leave to you, you Prussian stiffneck,
you, this girl in trust.

966
01:10:55,559 --> 01:11:00,087
<i>And if you don't take care ofher,</i>
<i>I'll raise the whole of England against you.</i>

967
01:11:00,164 --> 01:11:02,792
The navy will steam up
your stinking Stolpchensee,

968
01:11:02,866 --> 01:11:07,030
and I'll lead the army
down <i>Unter den Linden,</i> and we'll...

969
01:11:08,906 --> 01:11:10,840
Clive,

970
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:15,402
my English
is not very much,

971
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:18,812
but my friendship for you...

972
01:11:20,184 --> 01:11:22,482
is very much.

973
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:30,785
- <i>I hope it's taught you</i>
<i>a damn good lesson, Candy.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

974
01:11:30,861 --> 01:11:34,422
<i>The trouble with you young fellows</i>
<i>is you always want to go</i>
<i>changing everything.</i>

975
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,432
And what's the result?

976
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,936
You spend all your leave
in a nursing home full of foreigners.

977
01:11:40,003 --> 01:11:42,836
You've cost the treasury
a lot of money.

978
01:11:42,906 --> 01:11:45,568
And you make
the foreign office very cross.

979
01:11:45,642 --> 01:11:47,769
Yes, very cross.

980
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,905
And what did you get for it?
Your beauty spoiled.

981
01:11:50,981 --> 01:11:52,915
You weren't any fashion plate before.

982
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:56,441
- I'd be surprised if any woman
would look twice at you now.
- So would I, sir.

983
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,921
When you were here in January,
I told you very clearly
it was not your concern.

984
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:03,289
- It was an embassy job.
- Well, sir, I thought I'd take a chance.

985
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,591
A chance?
A chance?

986
01:12:06,663 --> 01:12:09,632
You can't afford to take a chance
with your career, my boy.

987
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,636
You are in the army as a career,
aren't you? Not for five minutes?

988
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:17,367
You were putting up a pretty good show.
Then you go barging in on this nonsense...

989
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:20,001
and you come very near
to getting yourself kicked out.

990
01:12:20,077 --> 01:12:23,103
- You don't want to get kicked out, do you?
- No, sir.

991
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,114
Well, let me tell you one thing.

992
01:12:25,182 --> 01:12:28,879
Don't bother your head
with things you don't understand
and you won't go far wrong.

993
01:12:28,952 --> 01:12:30,886
Never go off at half cock.

994
01:12:30,954 --> 01:12:35,323
Keep cool, keep your mouth shut,
and avoid politicians like the plague.

995
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:38,919
- That's the way to get on in the army.
- Thank you, sir.

996
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:48,370
Care to dine at my club tonight?

997
01:12:48,438 --> 01:12:51,930
- Sorry, sir. I'm taking someone
to the theater.
- Pretty?

998
01:12:52,009 --> 01:12:54,534
I haven't met her yet, sir.

999
01:12:54,611 --> 01:12:57,444
You're still a bit cracked, my boy.

1000
01:12:57,514 --> 01:12:59,675
Well, I hope you improve
as you get older.

1001
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,344
And cheer up, my boy.

1002
01:13:07,024 --> 01:13:08,958

They're married.
- Hoppy and Sybil?

1038
01:15:27,531 --> 01:15:30,932
Over a month ago. The family
were quite taken by surprise.

1039
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:32,992
It was very
romantic and sudden.

1040
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,004
And they met here
in this very theater.

1041
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,803
I know. I seem to be
a born matchmaker.

1042
01:15:40,277 --> 01:15:40,343
- Hello, Pebble.
- Master Clive.

1043
01:15:40,343 --> 01:15:43,540
- Hello, Pebble.
- Master Clive.

1044
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:52,187
- Your aunt is asleep.
- All right, don't disturb her.

1045
01:15:52,255 --> 01:15:54,621

to the club this evening.

1046
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:57,489
- You're not sick, Master Clive?
- No.

1047
01:15:57,561 --> 01:16:02,396
I say, Pebble. How did you feel
when you buried Mr. Pebble?

1048
01:16:02,466 --> 01:16:05,333
It wasn't so bad at the time, Master Clive.
There was so much to do.

1049
01:16:05,402 --> 01:16:08,428
- It was after that it got bad,
if you understand me.
- Hmm.

1050
01:16:08,505 --> 01:16:12,908
- I hope you haven't
come from a burying, sir.
- No, from the theater.

1051
01:16:12,976 --> 01:16:14,910
But it was
the same thing in a way.

1052
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:18,846
- Was it a sad play?
- On the contrary, it was a musical play.

1053
01:16:18,915 --> 01:16:21,315
- Is the bed in the den made up?
- No, sir.

1054

But it won't take a minute
if you don't mind sleeping in blankets.

has brought you here.
- You're on.

- Debts? A woman?
- No.

1065
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:03,125
- [Chuckles] Not exactly.
- Explain.

1066
01:17:03,193 --> 01:17:05,184
- I went to the theater tonight.
- Alone?

1067
01:17:05,262 --> 01:17:09,221
- With a girl.
- And why, pray, is she "not exactly"?

1068
01:17:09,299 --> 01:17:11,233
Oh, it was nothing to do with her.

1069
01:17:11,301 --> 01:17:14,464
Hmm, perhaps.
See anyone there you knew?

1070
01:17:14,538 --> 01:17:18,668
- I met Hoppy and Sybil Gilpin.
They're married.
- Why not? A very suitable match.

1071
01:17:18,742 --> 01:17:21,973
He has money and she has land
and neither of them has any brains.

1072
01:17:22,045 --> 01:17:24,912
- You surely weren't in love with her?
- With Sybil? Oh, no.

1073
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:29,042
I'm glad of that. She has the muscles of
a prize fighter. She'll hit Hoppy one day.

1074
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:31,952
- Hoppy could give her a couple of stone.
- She'll soon make that up.

1075
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,956
I assure you.

1076
01:17:36,293 --> 01:17:39,126
Who is this girl you took
to the theater tonight?

1077
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:42,256

I met her sister in Berlin.

01:17:42,332 --> 01:17:45,824
- Is she nice?
- Very. I mean the sister.

1079
01:17:45,902 --> 01:17:49,838
- Which sister?
- The one that stayed in Berlin.

1080
01:17:49,906 --> 01:17:54,366
<i>Then the one in London</i>
<i>is not so nice, I take it.</i>

- Floating down the river

1573
01:51:19,647 --> 01:51:21,581
Uh, would you mind,

1574
01:51:21,649 --> 01:51:25,244
<i>You Prussian stiffneck.</i>
<i>The only way to get you is to kidnap you.</i>

1575

Ah. You've worn well, old chap.

01:51:31,993 --> 01:51:35,588
- You've still got my mark,
I see. [Chuckles]
- And you still need a mustache.

1578
01:51:35,663 --> 01:51:37,688
- When were you captured?
- July 16th.

1579

You were lucky.
You missed the worst of it.

- That's what you think.

How about Edith?

1582
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:48,266
What shall I answer first?
Edith is all right, as far as I know.

1583
01:51:48,343 --> 01:51:50,777
And, uh, yes,
we have two children.

1584

- Karl. Yes, he is, isn't he?

we had no children.
- What?

in a beaten country?

1588

- My wife. Oh. Of course.
You don't know I'm married.

- Thank you, sir.

I can't imagine anything more awful
than being a prisoner of war in England.

1630

- Oh, my dear fellow,

their nose into everything.

- Yes, we have.

<i>Yes, I thought so. They started</i>
<i>a campaign to write to prisoners of war.</i>

- Not our chaps, mind you.
- <i>Oh, it wasn't so bad.</i>

We had books, concerts, lectures.

1636

I'm sure your camp was well run.

1637

By the way, what have you done
with old Tiger Bloomfield?

At Victoria. He's in the bar
at the Grosvenor.

1649
01:55:09,377 --> 01:55:13,609
- He was hostage for the <i>oberst.</i>
- Now, where is the sense
of guarding officer prisoners...

1650
01:55:13,681 --> 01:55:17,412
- <i>nearly a year after the fighting's over?</i>
- I imagine it is more to protect us.

- People.

<i>would attack you in that uniform?</i>

<i>My dear fellow, that's rather</i>
<i>a gloomy point of view, isn't it?</i>

<i>of the stick, old man.</i>

- Of course. The war's over.
- Yes. There's nothing to be
a menace about.

02:01:55,616 --> 02:01:58,346
Rather a long time.

1729
02:01:58,419 --> 02:02:00,353
Don't you think so?

1730
02:02:00,421 --> 02:02:04,482
Please, I mean no offense,
but you in England took five years.

1731
02:02:04,558 --> 02:02:06,992
Well, quite right.

1732
02:02:08,028 --> 02:02:09,996
Have you been in England before?

1733
02:02:10,064 --> 02:02:13,864
Yes. I was prisoner of war
in the last war.

1734
02:02:15,636 --> 02:02:20,505
I see you were an officer.
When did you leave the army?

1735
02:02:20,574 --> 02:02:22,735
In 1920.

1736
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:27,076
Eight out of ten officers had to retire
when the German army ceased to exist.

1737
02:02:27,147 --> 02:02:30,310
- <i>As a large army, I mean.</i>
- You prefer the existence of a large army?

1738
02:02:30,384 --> 02:02:33,080
Not anymore.

1739
02:02:33,153 --> 02:02:36,919
In '20 I chose a new profession.
I became a military chemist.

1740
02:02:36,991 --> 02:02:39,425
I worked for 13 years
in a factory in Mannheim.

1741
02:02:39,493 --> 02:02:42,087
Are you married?

1742
02:02:42,162 --> 02:02:44,096
My wife is dead.

1743
02:02:44,164 --> 02:02:46,598
<i>Children?</i>

1744
02:02:46,667 --> 02:02:49,659
Two. I have no connection with them.

1745
02:02:50,671 --> 02:02:52,764
They are good Nazis...

1746
02:02:54,341 --> 02:02:56,502
as far as any Nazi
can be called good.

1747
02:02:56,577 --> 02:02:58,943
I'm afraid, Mr. Kretschmar-Schuldorff,

1748
02:02:59,013 --> 02:03:01,675
that doesn't sound
very much in your favor.

1749
02:03:03,017 --> 02:03:05,508
I've tried to answer correctly.

1750
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:08,779
Personally, I don't doubt
your good faith,

1751
02:03:08,856 --> 02:03:12,019
but I'm here to safeguard
my country's interests.

1752
02:03:12,092 --> 02:03:14,959
You may be an anti-Nazi, you may not.

1753
02:03:15,029 --> 02:03:17,623
In times like these,
one enemy in our midst...

1754
02:03:17,698 --> 02:03:20,531
can do more harm
than ten across the Channel.

1755
02:03:22,202 --> 02:03:25,638
If you were here to work for the enemy,
what would you tell me now?

1756
02:03:25,706 --> 02:03:28,300
Exactly the same.
That you were a friend of England...

1757
02:03:28,375 --> 02:03:30,809
and that our enemy
was your enemy.

1758
02:03:30,878 --> 02:03:33,813
I know this is hard
on those who are really with us,

1759
02:03:33,881 --> 02:03:38,318
but it should be their best assurance
that this time we mean business.

1760
02:03:38,385 --> 02:03:42,913
If you are a friend, our precautions
are your precautions...

1761
02:03:42,990 --> 02:03:45,652
<i>and our interests,</i>
<i>your interests,</i>

1762
02:03:45,726 --> 02:03:49,924
<i>because our victory</i>
<i>will be your victory.</i>

1763
02:03:51,231 --> 02:03:53,722
Is there anything else
you'd like to say?

1764
02:03:56,170 --> 02:03:58,104
If you don't mind, sir...

1765
02:03:58,172 --> 02:04:00,663
No. Go ahead.

1766
02:04:00,741 --> 02:04:02,675
In earlier years,

1767
02:04:02,743 --> 02:04:06,907
the most important principle of my life
used to be "never lie,

1768
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:08,915
<i>always tell the truth."

1769
02:04:08,983 --> 02:04:11,611
Very good principle.
I hope you stick to it.

1770
02:04:11,685 --> 02:04:14,677
Oh, I have not told a lie, but I...

1771
02:04:14,755 --> 02:04:17,622
I also have not told the truth.

1772
02:04:17,691 --> 02:04:22,822
A refugee soon learns that there is
a big difference between the two.

1773
02:04:22,896 --> 02:04:27,526
The truth about me
is that I'm a tired old man...

1774
02:04:27,601 --> 02:04:30,593
who came to this country
because he's homesick.

1775
02:04:33,107 --> 02:04:38,044
Oh, please, don't stare at me like that, sir.
I'm all right in the head.

1776
02:04:38,112 --> 02:04:42,139
You know that after the war
we had very bad years in Germany.

1777
02:04:42,216 --> 02:04:46,550
We got poorer and poorer. Every day,
retired officers and school teachers...

1778
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:48,645
were caught shoplifting.

1779
02:04:48,722 --> 02:04:53,216
Money lost its value.
The price of everything rose...

1780
02:04:53,293 --> 02:04:56,057
except of human beings.

1781
02:04:56,130 --> 02:05:00,066
We read in the papers, of course, that
the after-war years were bad everywhere.

1782
02:05:00,134 --> 02:05:02,659
That crime was increasing
and that the honest citizens...

1783
02:05:02,736 --> 02:05:05,728
were having a hard job
to put the gangsters in jail.

1784
02:05:07,975 --> 02:05:10,910
Well, I needn't tell you, sir,
that in Germany...

1785
02:05:10,978 --> 02:05:15,312
the gangsters finally succeeded
in putting the honest citizens in jail.

1786
02:05:17,551 --> 02:05:20,019
My wife was English.

1787
02:05:20,087 --> 02:05:22,749
She would have loved
to have come back to England.

1788
02:05:22,823 --> 02:05:27,590
But it seemed to me that I would
be letting down my country
in its greatest need.

1789
02:05:27,661 --> 02:05:29,993
And so she stayed at my side.

1790
02:05:31,098 --> 02:05:34,363
When, in summer '33,

1791
02:05:34,435 --> 02:05:39,702
we found that we had lost
our children to the Nazi Party,

1792
02:05:39,773 --> 02:05:42,765
and I was willing to come,

1793
02:05:42,843 --> 02:05:44,834
she died.

1794
02:05:46,013 --> 02:05:48,675
None of my sons came to her funeral.

1795
02:05:51,919 --> 02:05:53,910
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

1796
02:05:56,690 --> 02:06:02,128
And then on January '35, I had to go
to Berlin on a mission for my firm.

1797
02:06:02,196 --> 02:06:06,792
Driving up in my car, I lost my way
on the outskirts of the city...

1798
02:06:06,867 --> 02:06:11,361
and suddenly the landscape
seemed so familiar to me.

1799
02:06:12,706 --> 02:06:16,142
And slowly I recognized...

1800
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:19,475
the road, the lake...

1801
02:06:19,546 --> 02:06:23,482
and a nursing home
where I spent some weeks recovering...

1802
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:27,486
oh, almost 40 years ago.

1803
02:06:27,554 --> 02:06:30,489
I stopped the car and sat still,

1804
02:06:30,557 --> 02:06:33,082
remembering.

1805
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:38,154
And, you see,
in this very nursing home, sir,

1806
02:06:38,232 --> 02:06:41,497
I met my wife
for the first time...

1807
02:06:41,568 --> 02:06:44,537
and I met an Englishman
who became my greatest friend.

1808
02:06:45,839 --> 02:06:50,833
And I remembered the people
at the station in '19,

1809
02:06:50,911 --> 02:06:53,175
when we prisoners were sent home,

1810
02:06:53,247 --> 02:06:56,842
cheering us, treating us like friends.

1811
02:06:56,917 --> 02:07:01,183
The faces of a party
of distinguished men round a table...

1812
02:07:01,255 --> 02:07:03,189
who tried their utmost
to comfort me...

1813
02:07:03,257 --> 02:07:06,420
when the defeat of my country
seemed to me unbearable.

1814
02:07:07,761 --> 02:07:10,195
And...

1815
02:07:10,264 --> 02:07:12,698
very foolishly,

1816
02:07:12,766 --> 02:07:16,202
I remembered
the English countryside.

1817
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:20,366
The gardens, the green lawns,

1818
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:22,704
the weedy rivers and the trees...

1819
02:07:24,278 --> 02:07:26,439
she loved so much.

1820
02:07:29,283 --> 02:07:31,217
And a great desire came over me...

1821
02:07:31,285 --> 02:07:33,776
to come back
to my wife's country.

1822
02:07:37,891 --> 02:07:40,451
And this, sir, is the truth.

1823
02:08:00,314 --> 02:08:03,750
Haven't you got anyone
in this country who knows you well?

1824
02:08:03,817 --> 02:08:05,751
A British, uh, citizen?

1825
02:08:05,819 --> 02:08:07,753
The doorman at the chemical works...

1826
02:08:07,821 --> 02:08:09,914
where I offered my services.

1827
02:08:09,990 --> 02:08:13,255
Police officers at the Aliens Department
at Bow Street.

1828
02:08:13,327 --> 02:08:15,318
Constable.

1829
02:08:16,663 --> 02:08:19,723
Don't you know
Major-General Clive Wynne-Candy?

1830
02:08:21,335 --> 02:08:23,269
<i>Yes, I used to know him.</i>

1831
02:08:23,337 --> 02:08:26,431
Did you ask him to come here
and testify on your behalf?

1832
02:08:26,506 --> 02:08:30,169
Yes, I did send him a letter,
but I suppose he...

1833
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:38,847
Theo! My dear chap.

1834
02:08:38,919 --> 02:08:40,853
Let's have a good look at you.

1835
02:08:40,921 --> 02:08:43,355
By God, you've kept your figure
better than I have.

1836
02:08:43,423 --> 02:08:45,357
I'm a bit of a bay window, what?

1837
02:08:45,425 --> 02:08:48,952
You see, sir, I wouldn't be surprised
if this fellow really disliked us.

1838
02:08:49,029 --> 02:08:50,963
He comes to England
twice in his life.

1839
02:08:51,031 --> 02:08:54,967
The first time he's a prisoner, and
the second time he's just about to be one.

1840
02:08:55,035 --> 02:08:59,301
May I talk to him, sir?
I haven't seen him for 19... No.

1841
02:08:59,373 --> 02:09:01,933
- Twenty.
- Twenty years and a bit.

1842
02:09:02,009 --> 02:09:05,638
Afraid not here, General. We have many
Kretschmar-Schuldorffs waiting.

1843
02:09:05,712 --> 02:09:10,979
Do you mean to say that I've traveled
11 hours from... mustn't say where...

1844
02:09:11,051 --> 02:09:13,815
and you won't allow me to have a word
with a condemned man?

1845
02:09:13,887 --> 02:09:16,651
- You don't have to go back
this minute, do you?
- Tomorrow morning, sir.

1846
02:09:16,723 --> 02:09:20,489
- Infernally early too.
- <i>That's all right. You can talk</i>
<i>to him all day and all night.</i>

1847
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:23,461
<i>Till midnight.</i>
<i>Aliens'curfew, you know.</i>

1848
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:26,829
- And I can take him with me?
- If you say you know him.

1849
02:09:28,902 --> 02:09:33,498
- Do I know him?
- And will stand surety for him.

1850
02:09:33,573 --> 02:09:35,564
With everything I have, sir.

1851
02:09:54,761 --> 02:09:57,252
<i>[Grandfather Clock Chiming]</i>

1852
02:10:01,601 --> 02:10:04,627
- Well, it's time I was going.
- The night's young yet.

1853
02:10:04,705 --> 02:10:07,367
Don't you remember?
Curfew for aliens.

1854
02:10:07,441 --> 02:10:09,671
- <i>Oh, yes.</i>
- I have to be at home by midnight.

1855
02:10:09,743 --> 02:10:12,143
Don't forget, sir.
You have to be up at 6:00.

1856
02:10:12,212 --> 02:10:14,146
- Early parade, eh?
- Aye.

1857
02:10:14,214 --> 02:10:16,842
How lucky you are, Clive.

1858
02:10:16,917 --> 02:10:19,943
<i>Yes. They put me</i>
<i>on the retired list in '35,</i>

1859
02:10:20,020 --> 02:10:21,954
but I knew they'd want me again.

1860
02:10:22,022 --> 02:10:24,456
Back I went on the active list
like a shot.

1861
02:10:27,294 --> 02:10:31,390
I mean, uh, why don't you stay?

1862
02:10:31,465 --> 02:10:33,399
I've 18 rooms.

1863
02:10:33,467 --> 02:10:35,799
- Murdoch, rally round.
- <i>Thank you, Clive.</i>

1864
02:10:35,869 --> 02:10:39,066
I'd better not.
I would need a special permit, anyway.

1865
02:10:40,407 --> 02:10:42,739
<i>All right, Murdoch.</i>
<i>As you were.</i>

1866
02:10:42,809 --> 02:10:46,074
Stay a little longer.
I'll send you home by car.

1867
02:10:46,146 --> 02:10:49,081
Murdoch, tell Miss Cannon
to be here by quarter to 12:00.

1868
02:10:49,149 --> 02:10:51,413
- <i>Very good, sir.</i>
- Who is Miss Cannon?

1869
02:10:51,485 --> 02:10:53,476
Miss Cannon?
My driver, M.T.C.

1870
02:10:56,656 --> 02:10:59,921
Do you remember, Clive,
we used to say...

1871
02:10:59,993 --> 02:11:05,021
"Our armies are fighting for our women,
our children and our homes"?

1872
02:11:05,098 --> 02:11:08,431
Now the women are fighting
beside the men.

1873
02:11:08,502 --> 02:11:11,266
The children are being trained
to shoot.

1874
02:11:11,338 --> 02:11:15,672
What's left is the home,
but what is the home
without women and children?

1875
02:11:17,511 --> 02:11:20,105
You never met my wife.
Would you like to see a picture of her?

1876
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:22,273
<i>Oh, very much.</i>

1877
02:11:22,349 --> 02:11:24,613
[Chuckling]

1878
02:11:24,684 --> 02:11:27,778
Do you remember when that was all
I was able to say in English?

1879
02:11:28,789 --> 02:11:30,450
"Very much."

1880
02:11:32,859 --> 02:11:34,952
You got further with them
than I ever got.

1881
02:11:35,028 --> 02:11:37,622
In what respect?

1882
02:11:37,697 --> 02:11:40,291
Dash it.
Don't tell me you didn't know.

1883
02:11:40,367 --> 02:11:42,858
<i>Knew what?</i>

1884
02:11:42,936 --> 02:11:45,200
[Sputters]
Well, you make me blush.

1885
02:11:45,272 --> 02:11:48,070
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1886
02:11:48,141 --> 02:11:51,941
Well, I thought it was written
all over my face when I left Berlin in '02.

1887
02:11:52,012 --> 02:11:54,446
Don't forget,
I never saw your face after you'd left.

1888
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:58,643
I was in love with her...
your wife.

1889
02:12:01,655 --> 02:12:03,589
She never told me.

1890
02:12:03,657 --> 02:12:05,887
She never knew.

1891
02:12:06,893 --> 02:12:09,157
But I seem to remem...

1892
02:12:09,229 --> 02:12:13,996
Oh, Clive, that last day in Berlin when
I told you, you seemed genuinely happy.

1893
02:12:14,067 --> 02:12:16,831
Dash it. I didn't know then.

1894
02:12:16,903 --> 02:12:19,838
But on the train
I started to miss her.

1895
02:12:19,906 --> 02:12:22,670
On the boat it was worse,
and by the time I got back to London,

1896
02:12:22,742 --> 02:12:24,676
well, I'd got it properly.

1897
02:12:24,744 --> 02:12:26,837
My Aunt Margaret got on
to the scent straight away.

1898
02:12:26,913 --> 02:12:29,677
Women have a nose
for these sort of things.

1899
02:12:29,749 --> 02:12:32,843
Besides, I did a stupid thing.

1900
02:12:32,919 --> 02:12:36,116
First night back,
I took out her sister.

1901
02:12:36,189 --> 02:12:38,453
- Aunt Margaret's?
- Edith's.

1902
02:12:38,525 --> 02:12:40,516
- Oh, Martha?
- Yes.

1903
02:12:40,594 --> 02:12:42,528
What is stupid about that?

1904
02:12:42,596 --> 02:12:44,928
Thinking her sister
would be like she was.

1905
02:12:46,266 --> 02:12:48,530
Like Edith?

1906
02:12:48,602 --> 02:12:50,593
Yes.

1907
02:12:51,605 --> 02:12:54,540
Well, you got over it.

1908
02:12:54,608 --> 02:12:57,042
That's just it.
I never got over it.

1909
02:12:57,110 --> 02:13:00,204
Theo, this may sound
a damn silly thing to say to you,

1910
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:03,443
but... I never got over it.

1911
02:13:06,119 --> 02:13:09,611
You may say
that she was my ideal...

1912
02:13:09,689 --> 02:13:13,557
if you were some sort
of sickening, long-haired poet.

1913
02:13:13,627 --> 02:13:16,721
All my life, I've been looking
for a woman like her.

1914
02:13:17,964 --> 02:13:20,728
So now you know.

1915
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,564
Well, uh, I never thought it
possible...

1916
02:13:23,637 --> 02:13:26,128
that an Englishman
could be so romantic.

1917
02:13:28,575 --> 02:13:30,509
And your wife?

1918
02:13:30,577 --> 02:13:32,568
You don't mind my asking you?

1919
02:13:32,646 --> 02:13:34,637
You loved her?

1920
02:13:34,714 --> 02:13:36,739
Yes. Dreadfully.

1921
02:13:37,817 --> 02:13:39,751
She was exactly like Edith.

1922
02:13:39,819 --> 02:13:41,810
I'll show her to you.

1923
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:55,234
Oh, she's very lovely.

1924
02:13:55,302 --> 02:13:58,499
But isn't she like Edith, eh?
See the resemblance?

1925
02:13:58,572 --> 02:14:00,767
Yes.

1926
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:04,105
There's something very striking.

1927
02:14:04,177 --> 02:14:08,511
But you must not forget,
I saw Edith 31 years later than you.

1928
02:14:08,582 --> 02:14:11,608
<i>We grew old together.</i>

1929
02:14:11,685 --> 02:14:13,619
<i>You understand?</i>

1930
02:14:13,687 --> 02:14:17,680
Ah. Yes, of course.
But she was exactly like her.

1931
02:14:19,326 --> 02:14:21,317
Mm.

1932
02:14:23,964 --> 02:14:27,456
It's a strange place
to hang such a lovely picture.

1933
02:14:27,534 --> 02:14:30,628
She wanted it.
I call this my den, you know?

1934
02:14:30,704 --> 02:14:34,572
She always knew I used to come
back here. We had a joke about it.

1935
02:14:34,641 --> 02:14:36,632
All my stuff's here.

1936
02:14:39,112 --> 02:14:41,603
It would be an awful gap without her.

1937
02:14:43,183 --> 02:14:45,981
Have a peg, what?

1938
02:14:46,052 --> 02:14:50,421
It must be terrible to lose someone
very dear to you in a foreign country.

1939
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:52,981
It wasn't a foreign country.
It was Jamaica.

1940
02:15:03,737 --> 02:15:05,796
Bye, Clive.
Have a nice journey.

1941
02:15:05,872 --> 02:15:08,500
- Don't worry about anything.
Everything's under control.
- That's fine.

1942
02:15:08,575 --> 02:15:10,509
Will you close the door,
sir, please?

1943
02:15:10,577 --> 02:15:13,171
- Oh, shut up, Murdoch.
- Good luck to you, Murdoch.

1944
02:15:13,246 --> 02:15:17,012
Thank you, sir, but the general
isn't taking me. I'm staying
behind to look after things here.

1945
02:15:17,083 --> 02:15:19,347
- You know the way, Angela?
- Yes, sir.

1946
02:15:26,559 --> 02:15:29,187
<i>[Motor Starts]</i>

1947
02:15:29,262 --> 02:15:32,356
- The door, sir. Please!
- What, did you see the warden?

1948
02:15:32,432 --> 02:15:35,026
I'm the warden
of this district, sir.

1949
02:15:35,101 --> 02:15:38,696
Oh, it must be very difficult
to drive in a blackout.

1950
02:15:38,772 --> 02:15:40,933
<i>It's not as bad as it looks, sir.</i>

1951
02:15:42,275 --> 02:15:44,607
I suppose you've done
a lot of night driving.

1952
02:15:44,678 --> 02:15:48,705
No, sir.
I never drove before the war.

1953
02:15:48,782 --> 02:15:52,047
- <i>What made you learn it?</i>
- My boyfriend taught me.

1954
02:15:52,118 --> 02:15:54,450
But not at night.

1955
02:15:54,521 --> 02:15:57,979
- Is he a good driver?
- <i>Oh, first-rate.</i>

1956
02:15:58,058 --> 02:16:00,151
<i>He's one of the Bentley boys...</i>

1957
02:16:00,226 --> 02:16:02,558
just now he walks
on his two flat feet.

1958
02:16:02,629 --> 02:16:04,995
He's a private in training.

1959
02:16:06,199 --> 02:16:08,724
What was your job
before the war, Miss Cannon?

1960
02:16:08,802 --> 02:16:11,794
- <i>Photographic model.</i>
- Oh? Interesting work.

1961
02:16:12,872 --> 02:16:14,965
<i>Not bad.</i>
<i>Bit hard on the feet.</i>

1962
02:16:16,776 --> 02:16:18,801
How did you know my name, sir?

1963
02:16:18,878 --> 02:16:21,244
The general talked about you.

1964
02:16:21,314 --> 02:16:24,249
Oh, did he?

1965
02:16:24,317 --> 02:16:27,411
- Mind if we try and beat the light, sir?
- No, not at all.

1966
02:16:27,487 --> 02:16:30,752
<i>[Motor Rewing]</i>

1967
02:16:30,824 --> 02:16:34,316
Oh. Sorry, sir.
Couldn't make it.

1968
02:16:35,428 --> 02:16:37,760
You like being the general's driver?

1969
02:16:37,831 --> 02:16:40,265
Of course. Who wouldn't?
He's such an old darling.

1970
02:16:40,333 --> 02:16:43,200
I could have done a handstand
when he asked for me.

1971
02:16:43,269 --> 02:16:45,601
You know, he chose me
out of 700 girls, sir.

1972
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:49,070
<i>Some odds, isn't it?</i>
<i>700-to-1.</i>

1973
02:16:49,142 --> 02:16:52,908
For crying out loud. Look at that light.
He ought to be reported.

1974
02:16:56,683 --> 02:16:59,447
Oh, come on.
Don't be all night.

1975
02:17:01,454 --> 02:17:04,514
<i>Ah.</i>

1976
02:17:06,526 --> 02:17:08,619
<i>That's what causes accidents.</i>

1977
02:17:14,367 --> 02:17:16,301
Long odds, weren't they, sir?

1978
02:17:16,369 --> 02:17:19,463
- <i>I beg your pardon?</i>
- Seven hundred-to-one.

1979
02:17:19,539 --> 02:17:22,235
Makes me a bit of an outsider.

1980
02:17:25,378 --> 02:17:27,812
What is your first name, Miss Cannon?

1981
02:17:27,881 --> 02:17:29,815
<i>Angela.</i>

1982
02:17:29,883 --> 02:17:32,044
It's a lovely name.

1983
02:17:32,118 --> 02:17:34,052
Comes from "angel," doesn't it?

1984
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:37,783
I think it stinks.
My friends call meJohnny.

1985
02:17:39,993 --> 02:17:42,655
<i>Is it this crossing</i>
<i>or the next, sir?</i>

1986
02:17:42,729 --> 02:17:45,095
Oh, this will do here.

1987
02:17:50,170 --> 02:17:52,502
- Good night, Angela.
- Good night, sir.

1988
02:17:52,572 --> 02:17:55,302
I'd like to see your boyfriend
one of these days.

1989
02:17:55,375 --> 02:17:57,206
Me too.
Good night, sir.

1990
02:18:08,922 --> 02:18:11,686
[Exhales Deeply]

1991
02:18:11,758 --> 02:18:13,919
[Buzzer]

1992
02:18:17,263 --> 02:18:19,197
He's on his way down now.

1993
02:18:19,265 --> 02:18:21,859
For the love of Gielgud, go and stop him
as he gets out of the lift.

1994
02:18:21,935 --> 02:18:25,371
- If you let him put one whisker
inside the studio, you are-
- Out.

1995
02:18:25,438 --> 02:18:28,373
- <i>Thank you, sir. This way, General.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

1996
02:18:28,441 --> 02:18:31,035
- General Wynne-Candy?
- This way to Studio Five, sir.

1997
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:33,374
- Mr. Herbert Marsh would like to see you.
- Never heard of him.

1998
02:18:33,446 --> 02:18:35,539
- Yes, but he's heard of you, sir.
- Has he? Good.

1999
02:18:35,615 --> 02:18:39,210
- It's this way to Studio Five.
- What time does my broadcast
start, precisely?

2000
02:18:39,285 --> 02:18:41,549
- Well, almost at 1:00, sir.
- At 21:20, sir.

2001
02:18:41,621 --> 02:18:44,954
- Plenty of time.
- Excuse me, miss...
- Oh, shut up.

2002
02:18:47,293 --> 02:18:49,557
- Sorry, old chap.
- A regular warren, eh?

2003
02:18:49,629 --> 02:18:51,961
- [Chuckles] Yes.
- Beehive of industry.

2004
02:18:52,031 --> 02:18:53,965
- Yes, sir.
- Do you like working here?

2005
02:18:54,033 --> 02:18:56,092
Very much.
You meet such interesting people.

2006
02:18:56,169 --> 02:18:58,103
You can tell that from the programs.

2007
02:18:58,171 --> 02:19:00,162
General Wynne-Candy.

2008
02:19:02,308 --> 02:19:03,332
Whew.

2009
02:19:03,409 --> 02:19:05,343
- I don't think I've met you, sir.
- No.

2010
02:19:05,411 --> 02:19:07,902
- Afraid I've not had that pleasure.
Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

2011
02:19:07,981 --> 02:19:09,915
- Cigarette?
- Thank you.

2012
02:19:09,983 --> 02:19:12,247
Pretty snug quarters you've got here.
And deep.

2013
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:14,809
- Yes. We have to be deep these days.
- I quite agree.

2014
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:18,915
Back to the Stone Age, what?
I don't think I'll light this
at the moment, if you don't mind.

2015
02:19:18,992 --> 02:19:20,926
Bad for speaking.
Makes the throat dry.

2016
02:19:20,994 --> 02:19:23,258
Hmm. General, um,

2017
02:19:23,329 --> 02:19:25,763
I'm afraid we've been having
a little trouble about your broadcast.

2018
02:19:25,832 --> 02:19:27,925
Well, I'm used to trouble.
I'm a soldier.

2019
02:19:28,001 --> 02:19:31,767
Yes. The, uh, authorities...

2020
02:19:31,838 --> 02:19:33,772
think that it's a little ill-timed...

2021
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:36,331
and, uh, might
be better postponed.

2022
02:19:37,844 --> 02:19:41,439
Think it's a little ill-timed?

2023
02:19:41,514 --> 02:19:44,039
Who has been saying that?
Why?

2024
02:19:44,117 --> 02:19:46,950
Well, General, you know,
in times of war...

2025
02:19:47,020 --> 02:19:49,784
Don't talk to me about war.

2026
02:19:49,856 --> 02:19:53,622
No. Of course.
That would be, um, grotesque.

2027
02:19:53,693 --> 02:19:56,287
I have been asked to
describe in this broadcast...

2028
02:19:56,362 --> 02:19:59,297
my views on the cause of the retreat
and its aspects for the future.

2029
02:19:59,365 --> 02:20:02,801
There they are. I've been serving
my country for 44 years.

2030
02:20:02,869 --> 02:20:04,962
What was your position
before this one, eh?

2031
02:20:05,038 --> 02:20:06,972
- A lawyer.
- What? A lawyer?

2032
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,974
Well, I was a soldier.

2033
02:20:09,042 --> 02:20:10,976
And before that,
I suppose you were in college.

2034
02:20:11,044 --> 02:20:12,978
And I was a soldier.

2035
02:20:13,046 --> 02:20:15,480
And I was a soldier
when you were a baby.

2036
02:20:15,548 --> 02:20:17,311
And before you were born, sir,

2037
02:20:17,383 --> 02:20:19,817
when you were nothing but a toss-up
between a girl's and a boy's name,

2038
02:20:19,886 --> 02:20:22,047
I was a soldier then.

2039
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:29,824
I'm deeply sorry, sir.

2040
02:20:29,896 --> 02:20:34,663
- I know it's not you.
- No. I'm afraid it isn't.

2041
02:20:34,734 --> 02:20:38,170
I'll make the necessary inquiries
through the War Office.

2042
02:20:38,237 --> 02:20:41,331
- I'll have a light for this cigarette now,
if you please.
- Yes.

2043
02:20:41,407 --> 02:20:44,342
[Man] Malta this morning
had its 25th air raid...

2044
02:20:44,410 --> 02:20:46,844
since Italy entered the war
last Monday.

2045
02:20:46,913 --> 02:20:50,349
It's not known if there was
any damage or casualties.

2046
02:20:50,416 --> 02:20:53,010
- Cigarette, soldier?
- [Newscaster] In yesterday's raids,

2047
02:20:53,086 --> 02:20:56,078
one civilian was killed
and eight were wounded.

2048
02:20:58,424 --> 02:21:01,860
That brings us to the end of the news
and to tonight's postscript,

2049
02:21:01,928 --> 02:21:04,362
which is given by Mr.J. B. Priestly.

2050
02:21:06,499 --> 02:21:08,433
What on earth
could have happened?

2051
02:21:08,501 --> 02:21:11,868
- Murdoch, you think he's had an accident?
- I cannot think, miss.

2052

I was expecting it.

2053
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:16,374
- Why?
- I've read his speech.

- It is a different knowledge

2107

The enemy's different
so you have to be different too.

02:25:04,337 --> 02:25:07,101
- I don't agree.
- You...

2110
02:25:07,173 --> 02:25:12,110
I read your broadcast up to the point
where you described
the collapse of France.

2111
02:25:12,178 --> 02:25:16,342
You commented on Nazi methods...
foul fighting, bombing refugees,

2112
02:25:16,415 --> 02:25:20,112
machine-gunning hospitals, lifeboats,
lightships, bailed-out pilots and so on...

2113
02:25:20,186 --> 02:25:22,620
by saying that you despised them,

2114
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:25,282
that you would be ashamed
to fight on their side...

2115
02:25:25,358 --> 02:25:28,953
and that you'd sooner
accept defeat than victory...

2116
02:25:29,028 --> 02:25:31,462
if it could only be won
by those methods!

2117
02:25:31,530 --> 02:25:33,555
So I would.

2118
02:25:33,633 --> 02:25:38,297
Clive, if you let yourself
be defeated by them...

2119
02:25:38,371 --> 02:25:41,807
just because you are
too fair to hit back...

2120
02:25:41,874 --> 02:25:44,138
the same way they hit at you,

2121
02:25:45,544 --> 02:25:49,002
there won't be any methods
<i>but</i> Nazi methods.

2122
02:25:49,081 --> 02:25:51,641
If you preach
the rules of the game,

2123
02:25:51,717 --> 02:25:55,813
while they use every foul
and filthy trick against you,

2124
02:25:55,888 --> 02:25:58,823
they'll laugh at you.

2125
02:25:58,891 --> 02:26:02,054
They'll think you're weak, decadent.

2126
02:26:04,730 --> 02:26:07,722
I thought so myself in 1919.

2127
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:09,825
I heard all that in the last war.

2128
02:26:09,902 --> 02:26:12,996
They fought foul then,
and who won it?

2129
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:16,333
I don't think you won it.

2130
02:26:16,409 --> 02:26:20,004
We lost it,
but you lost something too.

2131
02:26:20,079 --> 02:26:22,309
You forgot to learn the moral.

2132
02:26:23,983 --> 02:26:26,008
Because victory was yours,

2133
02:26:26,085 --> 02:26:29,077
you failed to learn your lesson
20 years ago,

2134
02:26:29,155 --> 02:26:31,248
and now you have to pay
the school fees again.

2135
02:26:31,324 --> 02:26:34,293
Some of you will learn
quicker than the others.

2136
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:36,294
Some will never learn it,

2137
02:26:36,362 --> 02:26:38,853
because you've been educated
to be a gentleman...

2138
02:26:38,931 --> 02:26:41,525
and a sportsman
in peace and in war.

2139
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:43,625
But, Clive,

2140
02:26:44,937 --> 02:26:47,132
dear old Clive,

2141
02:26:48,841 --> 02:26:52,038
this is not a gentleman's war.

2142
02:26:52,111 --> 02:26:56,707
This time you're fighting
for your very existence...

2143
02:26:56,782 --> 02:27:01,617
against the most devilish idea
ever created by a human brain.

2144
02:27:02,655 --> 02:27:04,850
Nazism.

2145
02:27:04,924 --> 02:27:07,984
And if you lose,

2146
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:11,894
there won't be
a return match next year.

2147
02:27:11,964 --> 02:27:14,626
Perhaps not even for 100 years.

2148
02:27:25,478 --> 02:27:27,810
Well, you...

2149
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:32,340
You mustn't mind me,
an alien, saying all this.

2150

better than one who's been bitten...

lets one down.

2156

Nobody would ever kick you, sir.

2157

You've just got to change over,
that's all.
