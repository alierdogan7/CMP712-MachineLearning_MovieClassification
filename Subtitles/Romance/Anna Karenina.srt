Yes.

00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,917

I'll come back to test you on it.

Well?

00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,255
Stiva wants me to come to Moscow
to persuade Dolly to forgive him.

00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,967
I'm to be deprived of my wife
so that adultery may be forgiven?

Come along.

45
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,543
Alexei, do you think
nine years of marriage and children

46
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,796
should count for nothing
against an infatuation?

47
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,382
No. Very well.

48
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,969
But sin has a price, you may be sure of that.

-I told you, Serozha.

53

She's not well. I must go to see her.

But why, Mama?

Don't make Mama cry.

56
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,360
I'll be back before you know,
and bring you a present.

57

I don't want a present. I want you to stay.

Oh, my little  <i>Kotik.</i>

59
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,700

It's the first time I've left my little boy.

63
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,526
So, you're leaving your son
and I'm returning to mine.

64
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,486
I'm Countess Vronskaya.

65
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,864
I've been in St. Petersburg
for the christening of a granddaughter.

66
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,700
My eldest son married Princess Chirkov.

67
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,708
You're a charming creature.
Why don't I know you?

68
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,585
I've never been in Moscow society, really.

69
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,045
But you know my name.

70
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,631
-I've heard you mentioned.
-Talked about, you mean?

72
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,386
Ah, love.

73
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,264
-Was it love?
-Always.

74
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,558
My sons are ashamed of me.

75
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,269
But I'd rather end up
wishing I hadn't than end up wishing I had.

76
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,603
Wouldn't you?

77
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,689
I don't know.

78
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,762
Some man came
without an appointment, Your Excellency.

79
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,971
Waiting outside.

80
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,183

81
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,310
I'm very anxious to see you.

82
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,937
I need your advice.

83
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,397
Well, come into my room, then.

84
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,859
This is my oldest friend,
Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin.

85
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,153
Someone send word I'll be a few minutes late.

86

That's my office, up there.

87
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,578
Oh, I've been hard at it. Sit down.

88
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,954
Hard at what, exactly?

89
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,040
Well, we're overwhelmed with work.

90
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,124
Paperwork.

91
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,460
Paperwork is the soul of Russia.
Farming is only the stomach.

92
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,380
Now, when am I going to
come and shoot some snipe?

00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,466
(LAUGHS)

94
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,511
Look at you, in Western clothes
you told me you'd never wear again.

95
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,637
Something's up.

96
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,307
Yes, I'm in love. I've come back to propose.

97
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,310
Have you guessed who she is?

98
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,854
I... I have a suspicion.
Why didn't you propose when you were here?

99
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,482
I decided it was impossible.

100
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,985
Kitty is of the heavens, an angel.
And I am of the earth.

101
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,823
But then, I thought and thought,
and there's no life for me without her.

102
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,826
-Do I have a chance?
-Of course you do.

103
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,327
The Shcherbatskys
are giving a soiree this evening.

104
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,870
Get there early, before the crowd.

105
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,539
-And if I may suggest...
-Anything, what?

106
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,791
-New boots.
-Right. Anything else?

107
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,669
We'd better have dinner together.

108
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,379
Come on. We'll meet later at l'Angleterre.

109
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,839
Or do you prefer the Hermitage?

110
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,716
Let's say, 5:30 at l'Angleterre.

111
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,259
I owe them more than the Hermitage,

112
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,802
so it wouldn't be fair to withdraw my custom.

113
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:35,515
Uh, so, new boots, coat, and a proper hat.

Excuse me.

120
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,387
It's so unfair.

121
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,764
You marry for love.

122
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,641
You're a good husband.

123
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,603
Children arrive, years depart.

124
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,942
And all of a sudden,
your wife grows old and tired.

125
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,611
And her hair is thin. And her body...

126
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,822
And you yourself, you still have your vigor!

127
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,159
And then you find yourself
a martyr to distraction by so many women.

128
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,161
Forgive me, but I find that incomprehensible.

129
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,707
As though, I should leave this restaurant
and steal a roll from a baker's shop.

130
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,916
Well, you know, a freshly baked roll.

131
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,920
I'm talking about love,
and you're talking about your appetite.

132
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,631
Easily confused.
Now, do you know, um, Count Vronsky?

133
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,299
Who? No. Why?

134
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,385

Oh, you don't need to worry about him.
He's... He's just...

00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,807
He's a rich, good-looking cavalry officer

138
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,518
who has nothing better to do
than make love to pretty women.

She says her sister Kitty
was always meant to be your wife, and will be.

-You look...
-Stiva told us you were back.

00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:48,104
(GIGGLES)

539
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:51,524
I'm not sure my nerves
can stand another Alexei at this moment.

540
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:52,650
(GIGGLES)

541
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,033
Were you glad to see me or not?

542
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:02,702
So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner.

543
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:07,040
The sauce was said to have
cost a thousand rubles, and it was ghastly.

544
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:16,675
I gave them a sauce
that cost 85 kopeks and it was a triumph.

545
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:18,009
(LAUGHING)

546
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,969
This must stop.

547
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,930
You make me feel
as if I were guilty of something.

548
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:23,223
What do you want me to do?

549
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:26,017
I want you to go to Moscow
and beg Kitty to forgive you.

550
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,560
No, that's not what you want.

551
00:45:27,602 --> 00:45:29,646
Moscow? I can do better than that.

552
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,982
Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent.

553
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:36,236
I can change my mind,
and you'll never see me again.

554
00:45:37,946 --> 00:45:40,407
If you have any thought for me,
you will give me back my peace.

555
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,991
I have no peace to give.

556
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,868
There can be no peace for us.

557
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:46,913
Only misery or the greatest happiness.

558
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:51,042
-BETSY: Your husband is impossible.
-(GASPS)

559
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,168
His opinions are all wrong,

560
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:54,379
but he talks so brilliantly,
he wins every argument.

561
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:55,839
-(CHUCKLES)
-What?

562
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:57,298
I called to take you home.

563
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:59,134
No, I'm staying.

564
00:45:59,759 --> 00:46:01,803
Send the carriage back for me.

565
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:02,971
Of course.

566
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:04,347
(CHUCKLES)

567

(DOOR OPENS)

568
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:26,453
Do you want me to go to Tashkent?

569
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:40,967
So I'll go to Tashkent.

570
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:42,218
No!

571
00:46:45,805 --> 00:46:47,307
I don't want you to go.

572
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:19,172
KARENIN: I stayed up to talk to you.

573
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:26,805
What about?

574
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:29,641
It's late.

575
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:32,268
Where's Annushka?

576
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,690
I sent her off.

577
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:40,777
Well.

578
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,531
If you want to talk, but we should go to bed.

579
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:45,990
I must warn you about something.

580
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:47,117
Warn me?

581
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,162
Oh, it's really rather late.

582
00:47:51,204 --> 00:47:53,248
I wish to warn you that you may, inadvertently

583
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:56,459
by indiscretion and carelessness,

584
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:58,211
give the world occasion to talk about you.

585
00:47:58,253 --> 00:47:59,796
I am not a committee.

586
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:02,507
Please say what you want to tell me.

587
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:08,054
You and Count Vronsky
attracted attention tonight.

588
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:12,517
You don't like it when I don't talk to people,

589
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,893
and you don't like it when I do.

590
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:15,395
I didn't notice anything myself,

591
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:16,688
but I saw everyone else noticed.

592
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:21,818
I consider jealousy
to be insulting to you and degrading to me.

593
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:23,862
I have no right to inquire into your feelings.

594
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:26,281
They concern only your conscience.

595
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:30,035
But it's my duty to remind you
that we are bound together by God,

596
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:33,580
and this bond
can only be broken by a crime against God.

597
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:36,124
I have nothing to say to you.

598
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:38,918
And you have a son.

599
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:40,670
And I'm tired.

600
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:53,892
If I am wrong, I ask your pardon.

601
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:58,938
I don't know what you're talking about,

602
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:00,899
and it's really too late for this.

603
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:05,862
Excuse me, please.

604
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:16,623
(SOFTLY) Too late.

Oh, God! Oh, forgive me!

608
00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:37,370
It's the end of everything.

609
00:50:37,537 --> 00:50:39,873
I've got nothing left now except you,
remember that.

610
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,044
How could I not remember?

611
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,547
You're my happiness.

612
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:54,387
Happiness?

613
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,473
You murdered my happiness.

614
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:58,892
Murderer.

615
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:00,643
Murderer.

617
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,313
Go on.

618
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,731
Yes.

619
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:07,192
Go on. Murderer.

620
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:09,611
Murderer.

if you opened up in Moscow,

626

Oh, you're right, what do you care?

631
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:55,031
You love the country, you've got it.

632
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:57,575
You love agriculturing,
and, Lord knows, you've got that.

633
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:58,952
You love shooting, you've got that.

-You've got everything you want.
-Ha!

635

00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,299
How are the Shcherbatskys?

640
00:52:13,591 --> 00:52:14,634
You mean Kitty.

-Is she engaged now?
-No.

642
00:52:17,637 --> 00:52:20,056
Vronsky went back to St. Petersburg.

643
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:21,766
Huh.

644
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:24,686
Kitty will be seeing
Dolly at Ergoshovo in the summer.

00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,312
You could...

646
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,148
Oh, yes, as if I had time in the summer.

647
00:52:28,189 --> 00:52:30,734
And I've got extra land
at Kashin this year for the haymaking.

648
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:32,736
Kashin? That's on the
Ergoshovo road, isn't it?

649
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:34,320
Couldn't you see Kitty when she's there?

650
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:36,948
Especially, not then. I humiliated myself once.

You love Kitty and you can't forgive her

because, first, you funked it,
and then you bungled it.

654

And then you ran away
from an 18-year-old girl

655
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:49,085
who was made a fool of by a uniform.

656

I don't even think about him, or her.

You're here to be
Master Konstantin Dmitrievich.

901

As it's always been, by the grace of God.

902
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:26,059
My father owned you, Theodore.

903
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:29,145
Owned you like chattels
to be bought and sold.

904
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:30,897
Was that by the grace of God?

905
01:10:32,607 --> 01:10:33,983
It was.

906
01:10:34,567 --> 01:10:36,736
That's my youngest
you were looking at, there.

907
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:41,574
His young life is perilous now since the
freedom came and work must be found.

908
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:44,244
They look happier than I've ever been.

916
01:12:43,029 --> 01:12:44,197
Sorry.

917
01:12:45,281 --> 01:12:46,991
It's my demon. I can't help it.

918

You wrote that you were ill.

-Stop.
-No, it's true.

921
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:52,706
I was told it in a dream.

922
01:12:52,747 --> 01:12:54,040
There. It was only a bad dream.

923
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:55,750
Yes, and I'm only
going to die having your baby.

924

-That's all nonsense.
-Tell me it is.

Your note said your husband would be out.

928
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:09,764
He was late. It serves him right.

930
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:16,563
Why do you call him my husband?

931
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:18,064
He isn't my husband, he's a clock.

932
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:21,067
But it was awkward. My honor.
You made an agreement.

933
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:24,112
Do you think of your honor when you're
sharing whores with your Colonel?

934

935
01:13:27,323 --> 01:13:29,284

Only  <i>Madame, </i> Your Excellency.

I do not wish to know
why a woman wants to see her lover.

I infinitely prefer to my own.

has driven you into the street.

will be sent to live with my eldest sister.

Well, what...

1006
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:18,763
What was the challenge about?

1007
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:20,306
Pryachnikov's wife, naturally.

01:17:20,348 --> 01:17:22,934
PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY: It was a matter
of honor, defending a woman's honor.

1009
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:25,979
Sounds like barbarism to me.
What if the lover had killed the husband?

1010
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:28,648
Would that have preserved
the wife's honor, too?

1011
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:31,234
Still, not many of us can say
our lover died for love.

To admire another man's wife
is a pleasant thing,

1019
01:18:01,723 --> 01:18:04,517
but sensual desire indulged
for its own sake is greed,

1020
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:06,519
a kind of gluttony,

1021
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:09,606
and a misuse of something sacred,
which is given to us

1022
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:13,026
so that we may choose the one person
with whom to fulfill our humanness.

Look at my husband.

1080
01:25:02,477 --> 01:25:03,937
He's a saint.

1081
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:06,481

You look like what you've become.
A laughingstock.

1095
01:26:29,647 --> 01:26:31,691
I fancy you will be asked
to leave the regiment.

1096
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:33,276
I would like you to go,  <i>Maman.</i>

A little affair with a married woman

to a young man's education.

But this morbid, selfish obsession...

1101
01:26:42,285 --> 01:26:43,703
You've publicly humiliated yourself

1102
01:26:43,745 --> 01:26:45,455
and dishonored
a man who has devoted his life to Russia.

1103
01:26:46,623 --> 01:26:49,542
So you'd better come back
to Moscow with me.

We've been talking too much, so I'm going.

1117
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:45,849
Princess Betsy came to tell me...

1118
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:48,935
I don't want to hide anything from you.

1119
01:27:49,227 --> 01:27:52,522
Count Vronsky asked
to come to say goodbye. He's going away.

1120
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:58,153
I've told him that I can't receive him.

1121

(DOOR CLOSES)

1123

I agree with you.

1124
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:29,976
As he is going away,
there's no need for Count Vronsky to come.

1125
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:31,978
I just said so, so there's no need to repeat it.

1126
01:28:32,062 --> 01:28:33,396
But it is for you to decide.

1127
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,690
Yes, and I decided.

1128
01:28:35,774 --> 01:28:36,816
Then I am very glad that...

1129
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:39,694
That we agree,
so perhaps we can stop talking about it.

1130
01:28:39,778 --> 01:28:42,697
Of course. Is there anything I can do for you?

1131
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:47,452
Yes, can you please,
please, please stop cracking your knuckles?

1132
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:54,668
I'm a bad woman.

1133
01:28:57,796 --> 01:28:59,547
But I can't breathe.

1134
01:29:01,424 --> 01:29:03,677
Your kindness, which I can't repay,
and your forgiveness...

1135
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:06,596
You begged me for my forgiveness.

1136
01:29:06,763 --> 01:29:08,431
But I didn't die, and now I have to live with it.

1137
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:11,351
Then what? What do you want?

1138
01:29:11,434 --> 01:29:14,688
Do you know what you want?
Do you want to see Count Vronsky?

1139

I can't hear.

1141
01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:24,698
Not to say goodbye.

1142
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:31,538
You would be lost. Irretrievably lost.

1143
01:29:32,247 --> 01:29:34,207
You would have no position.

1144
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,752
And worse, if we divorce,
you would be the guilty party.

1145
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:40,422
That means you cannot legally remarry.

1146
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:43,925
Your union with Count Vronsky
would be illegitimate,

1147
01:29:44,009 --> 01:29:46,594
as would your daughter,
who now has the protection of my name.

1148
01:29:46,678 --> 01:29:48,680
And this is what you want?

1149
01:29:50,557 --> 01:29:54,060
It would be a sin to help you destroy yourself.

1150
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:55,937
You forget something.

1151
01:29:57,313 --> 01:30:01,026
Count Vronsky and I love each other.

1152
01:30:02,318 --> 01:30:06,406
And this love sanctifies a criminal folly?

1153
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:08,283
All I know is that I sent him away

1154
01:30:08,366 --> 01:30:10,869
and it's as if I'd shot myself through the heart!

1156
01:30:20,545 --> 01:30:22,297
And what of Serozha?

1157
01:30:24,716 --> 01:30:26,593
I would die for him,

1158
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:30,138
but I won't live like this for him.

1159
01:30:31,931 --> 01:30:34,726
When he knows of love, he will forgive me.

1160
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:41,232
Then I must choose the smaller sin.

1161
01:30:42,108 --> 01:30:45,904

and I will give him my coat.

01:41:21,706 --> 01:41:24,626

1252
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,339
As soon as the divorce.

1254
01:41:38,264 --> 01:41:40,684
You're the very first
person to call on me since our return.

1255
01:41:40,767 --> 01:41:43,061
I received a note from Princess Betsy

1256
01:41:43,103 --> 01:41:46,064
asking me to call on her
between 6:30 and 8:00.

1257
01:41:46,106 --> 01:41:47,774
Or was it 7:00?

1258
01:41:48,108 --> 01:41:50,652
But perhaps you'll meet at the opera tonight.

1259

You'll find me there with Princess Myagkaya.

1262
01:41:58,618 --> 01:41:59,786
Will you come, Vronsky?

1263
01:42:04,124 --> 01:42:06,918
-Well...
-I see why Alexei is so fond of you.

1264

You know you can't go to the theater.

-Annushka!
-For heaven's sake.

1266
01:42:17,929 --> 01:42:19,305
A bath! I'll come in and choose a dress.

1267
01:42:19,347 --> 01:42:20,473

1268
01:42:20,515 --> 01:42:22,934

Have you changed towards me?

1273
01:42:31,234 --> 01:42:32,736
It's because I love you and care about you.

1274
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:35,155
If that's the case, then I don't know why
you aren't coming with me.

-That would make it worse.
-You're afraid.

You'll come up to see us afterwards?

1289

I'll talk to Varya.

01:44:23,805 --> 01:44:25,140
Will you call on Anna?

01:46:04,072 --> 01:46:06,032
you see why she must divorce.

1315
01:46:06,991 --> 01:46:10,370
Marriage will solve everything.
When will it be?

1316
01:46:10,412 --> 01:46:12,455
As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife.

As you saw, she isn't.

then to my place in the country.
