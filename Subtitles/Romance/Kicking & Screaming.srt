177
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,853
Yeah.

178
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,049
You might wanna
clean the water
every now and then.

179
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,853
Let's see what you can do.

180
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,290
Hey, Dad,
I didn't know if...

181
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,987
I wanted to
talk to you about Sam.

182
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,290
Sammy's a good boy.

183
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,352
Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,398
Yeah.

185
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,264
He hasn't been
playing much lately
and, I didn't know if--

186
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,326
Stop right there.
I agree with you.

187
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,871
And I got some
great news.

188
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,998
He's gonna get
a lot more
playing time now.

189
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,372
Dad, thanks,
that's--that's exactly
what I wanted to hear.

190
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,933
I traded him
to the Tigers.

191
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,034
[glass shattering]

192
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,101
(Buck)
Ooh, hey!

193
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,645
[sparking]

194
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,182
You traded
your own grandson?

195
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,343
Well, I didn't actually
get anything for him.

196
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,148
You know that cost $400?

197
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,381
I can't believe it.

198
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,980
W-What, you
calling me a liar?
I'll show you the receipt.

199
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,821
No, l-I'm talking
about Sam!

200
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,485
W-Why didn't you
just play him more?

201
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,960
He is going to
play more, Philly--

202
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,496
Yeah, for another team!

203
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,260
You--You--You care
about winning that much?

204
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,326
Look, Phil,
I'm not just
coaching soccer.

205
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,700
I'm building men.

206
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,829
Okay, yeah.

207
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,838
Hey, hey, hey.

208
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,898
It's an impressive shot.
Sure.

209
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,637
But, you know,
I want Sam to have fun.

210
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,973
This isn't the big leagues.

211
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,275
For those who live
between Broadway
and Grandville,

212
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,781
between the ages
of 10 and 12,

213
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,511
who are free
on Sundays and Tuesdays,

214
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,446
this is the big leagues.

215
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,284
But what about Sam?

216
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,252
Sam, you saw him
out there today.
It breaks my heart.

217
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,589
At best,
he's a benchwarmer.

218
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,586
Wow! Oh!

219
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,662
Oh, Killer! Killer!

220
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,065
How did that happen?

221
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,869
[sighs]

222
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,777
Hey, Sam,
you wanna give us a minute?

223
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,080
Need a little adult time.

224
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,381
Uh-huh.

225
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,944
[door closes]

226
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,584
[sighs]

227
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,022
Of all the asinine things
my dad has done,

228
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,357
this is by far
the most asinine.

229
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,762
I mean, I know he's
the most competitive man
in the world.

230
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,801
But this beats them all.
I'm angry.

231
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,571
I'm--I'm spitting angry!

232
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,104
I'm like a tornado of anger,
swirling about!

233
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,411
My heart rate is
dangerously high right now.

234
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,173
I'm glad it happened,
l--

235
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,113
What?
Yeah.

236
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,445
What do you mean?

237
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,248
Where did my wife go?
Are you a robot?

238
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,649
Are you a robot-woman?

239
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,690
I--I am not a robot.

240
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,089
Phil, honey,
I know this is
upsetting, okay,

241
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,890
but you have to try to
find the positive in this.

242
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,023
It was unhealthy
for Sam to play
on your dad's team.

243
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,033
Now he'll play
for the Tigers

244
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,092
[sighs]
and have some fun.

245
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,066
Okay, look,
you're too upset about this.

246
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,231
So, I'll tell him, okay?

247
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,400
No, no, no,
no, no, no, l...

248
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,006
I need to tell him.

249
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,468
[sighs]

250
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,938
[grunts]

251
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,380
Benchwarmer?

252
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,639
[grunts]

253
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,015
[hissing]

254
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,787
Boy, did that hurt my face.

255
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,011
[knocking on door]

256
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,318
Sammy?
Yeah?

257
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,583
Hey.
Hey.

258
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,389
What are you doing?
Nothing.

259
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,157
Internet dating?
No.

260
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,788
Mail-order bride?
No.

261
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,332
Just kidding.

262
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,834
(Phil)
Look, uh, I got
some good news.

263
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,234
I got you put on a new team.

264
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,673
I'm not on the Gladiators
anymore?

265
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,868
No.

266
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,137
You're on the Tigers.

267
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,301
[snarling]

268
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,108
The Tigers?
Yeah.

269
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,080
They're in last place.

270
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,285
Yeah, but you're gonna get
more playing time.

271
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,282
Did Grandpa trade me?

272
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,180
No.

273
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,390
Yes, wait.
I'm happy this is happening.

274
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,519
This is a good thing.

275
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,496
You know, it doesn't seem
like a good thing,

276
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,088
but it's a good thing.
Trust me.

277
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,430
You do not wanna be
the kid

278
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,993
that's on the other end
of the bench.

279
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,936
You do not
want to be that kid.

280
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,530
'Cause I know that kid.

281
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,233
You don't wanna be him.

282
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,435
Okay.

283
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,709
You don't wanna be the kid
who has such suppressed rage

284
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,216
that his heart's about
to burst through his chest.

285
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,650
[panting]

286
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,280
You don't wanna
be the kid that
when he thinks about

287
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,721
what his dad did to him...

288
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,815
[gasps]

289
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,860
I know that kid. I know.

290
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,724
That kid lives right here
in this house!

291
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,820
Mom!

292
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,660
[wheezing]

293
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,198
Oh.

294
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,432
Mom!

295
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,594
He doesn't know what to do.
He doesn't--

296
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,659
Ouch!

297
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,129
Phew.

298
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,969
Okay?
Yes. Good.

299
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,268
Coach Benson will be
good for you.
He knows his stuff.

300
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,369
I bet you this whole thing
is gonna turn out to be

301
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,438
a blessing in disguise.

302
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,778
Hey, the Tigers
may be in last place,

303
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,012
but those guys
look pretty good.

304
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,987
Dad, those
aren't the Tigers.

305
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,454
They're not even
wearing blue.

306
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,888
The Tigers are
over there.

307
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,291
I'm having a baby.
Oh, I'm having a baby.

308
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,589
No hitting the baby.

309
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,097
No, no, don't hit
my precious baby.

310
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,097
[splashing]

311
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,726
Oh, look,
it's gonna come out!
It's gonna come out! Oh!

312
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,769
Cut it out!

313
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,895
Oh, it's gonna come out!

314
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,960
Oh.

315
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,532
Hi, excuse me. Uh,
Coach Benson around?

316
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,168
Yeah, you all know
Phil Weston?

317
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,371
(John)
Oh, yeah.

318
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,243
Hey, welcome to the team,
little fellow.

319
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,545
Why don't you go
join those other kids
over there?

320
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,141
Yeah, go ahead.

321
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,618
There's a moving truck
in front of Benson's house.

322
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,987
Did you hear?
The pressure of
coaching got to him.

323
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,047
He cracked.

324
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,618
How could he crack?
We're only one game
into the season.

325
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,459
All right,
Tigers, it's game time.

326
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,226
Oh, but we're waiting
for our coach.

327
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,926
Well, then one of you
will have to coach.

328
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,196
Yeah, but I had
talked to Coach Benson,
we're brand new--

329
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,464
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
All right.

330
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,802
Find yourself a coach,
or the Tigers forfeit.

331
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,799
Yes?

332
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,173
Where do I know you from?

333
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,007
I've been your neighbor
for seven years.

334
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,171
No, that ain't it.

335
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,976
No, that's definitely it.

336
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,811
I'll figure it out.

337
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,774
So, who's gonna coach?

338
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,980
We got Mark into soccer,
'cause we wanted
to take a break.

339
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,989
I didn't think I'd be
coaching the little bugger.

340
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,491
I just got laid off.
I'm looking for a job

341
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,585
so it's hard enough
to drag myself out of bed.

342
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,259
So, uh, we forfeit.

343
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,325
So, we're forfeiting?

344
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,800
No, no, no, no. Uh,

345
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,940
you know what,
l--I can coach.

346
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,373
Well, that's swell!
Great!

347
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,739
Just for one game.

348
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,041
Right. It's game time.
Get your team on the field.

349
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,375
Who are we playing?

350
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,811
How about

we would just start,
uh, today by going around,

526
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,315
introducing yourselves,
and telling me

527
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,352
your--your strengths
on the soccer field.

528
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,409
All right.

529
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,382
Start with you.

530
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,582
Hey, I'm Hunter.

531
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,626
Hey, Hunter. I'm Phil.

532
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:58,351
Hi, Phil. Uh, l-I'll
eat this worm for $5.

533
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,329
How would that help us?

534
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,726
I'd have an extra $5?

535
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,934
No, you're not going to
eat that, are you?

536
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,799
Ugh!

537
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,368
[clears throat]

538
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,913
Did you just eat that?

539
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,044
Yeah, I ate it.

540
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,409
Now you owe me $5.

541
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,612
I didn't agree to pay you $5.

542
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,881
Forget it.
Pass it to someone else.

543
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,290
I'm Byong Sun.

544
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,126
(Phil)
Hi, Byong Sun.

545
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,458
I am a very kind person.

546
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,400
Oh, that's sweet.
That's very sweet.

547
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,528
Anything that relates
to soccer?

548
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,096
No, sir.

549
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,232
You know, maybe
you and Ambrose
could--could team up.

550
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,642
He's big. You--You might
form one mega-person.

551
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,512
[chuckles]

552
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,150
Okay, forget that
I just said that.

553
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,551
Uh, pass it
to--to someone else.

554
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,047
I'm Mark Avery.

555
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,319
You know, I like to keep
my pimp hands strong.

556
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,020
You dig, cracker?
You feel me?

557
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,926
W-What does that mean?

558
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,157
I really don't know.

559
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,495
I heard it
on a rap video once.

560
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,623
Oh.

561
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,965
But, I'm, like, really funny.
I got like a million jokes.

562
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,403
Great. Okay, yeah.
I'd love to hear one. Shoot.

563
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,770
Remember when
you called us out

564
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,399
onto the field
and you fell over?

565
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,943
Right. Yeah?

566
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,774
[chuckling]

567
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,110
Man! I got you good!

568
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,671
[all laughing]

569
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,082
Somebody call the burn unit.
I got you bad!

570
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,720
How did I get burned?

571
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,916
Apparently,
I don't get it, okay.

572
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:34,981
Doesn't matter.

573
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,994
Uh, you know what?
Let's just do some drills.

574
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,188
Now, this one,

575
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,527
all the great players
have done at one
time or another.

576
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,759
It's called "the snake."

577
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,199
Player in the back
dribbles the ball

578
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,100
in a weaving fashion
around the player

579
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,731
and stops 3 feet
from the first player.

580
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,001
[children yelling]

581
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,407
Hey!

582
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,943
[blowing whistle]

583
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,008
Okay, that's not the snake.

584
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,708
??[Holla by Baha Men playing]

585
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,909
Uh...

586
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,316
? We got the rhythm,
we got the most fun ??

587
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,876
Honey,
it was your first practice.

588
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,216
It'll get better.

589
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,756
No, it's gonna get worse.

590
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,358
You need to give it
some time, Phil.

591
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,087
No. I already know.
It was awful.

592
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,492
The kids were
just running around.

593
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:11,859
They weren't
listening to me.

594
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,057
They were like
4-foot whirling dervishes.

595
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,293
And I don't even know
what a whirling dervish is,

596
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,893
but that's--that's what
they were like.

597
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,598
You know why?
'Cause I'm not a coach.

598
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,971
Okay? I don't know
what I'm doing.

599
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,136
My dad. He's a coach.
He knows the game.

600
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,703
He's confident, he's smart,

601
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,911
witty, dynamic,
vicious, brutal, vindictive.

602
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,316
A monster.

603
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,945
And he will win
through intimidation

604
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,456
and forceful tactics
if need be.

605
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,219
I'm not like that.

606
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,889
In fact, I don't know
anyone like that.

607
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,656
Do you?

608
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,132
So, Paul,
what's on your mind?

609
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,261
Uh, actually, it's Phil.

610
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,462
You mean, it's not Paul?

611
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,598
No, it's Phil.

612
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,609
What's the difference?
Come on. Spit it out.

613
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,666
Uh, here it is.

614
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,643
(Diana)
Mike!

615
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,644
Hold this.

616
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,737
[footsteps approaching]

617
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:07,217
Oh, no. No, no,
we do not allow smoking
in the house.

618
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,754
I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Ditka.

619
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,420
Here, I'll
get rid of it, honey.

620
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,923
Anyway, uh, l-I'm coaching
my son's soccer team.

621
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,925
And--And l--I didn't know
if you might be
willing to help.

622
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:20,965
Soccer?

623
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,092
Actually, uh, l--I want you
to assistant coach.

624
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,934
Your assistant coach?

625
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,100
You really don't know
who I am, do you?

626
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,801
You're right. Silly idea.

627
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,207
I just-- I just
need some help

628
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,505
and you're such
a great coach.

629
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,637
My dad's gonna be
riding me all season,
so I just--

630
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,080
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho,
your dad?

631
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,516
You mean I get to coach
against your dad?

632
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,552
Well, yeah.

633
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,144
(Diana)
Mike, I smell smoke!

634
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,745
Nobody's smokin'!

635
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,154
Mike!
For Pete's sake!

636
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,249
So, like, it's me and you
against your old man?

637
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,588
I mean,
there are other teams.

638
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:50,559
Gotcha!

639
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,688
No smoking means
no smokin'!

640
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,026
Okay, come on, Phil.

641
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,896
I'll throw this out
the window, honey.

642
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,901
Uh, l-I'm sorry, Mrs. D....
I'm sorry.

643
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,493
You should be.

644
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,195
It's a nasty, filthy habit.

645
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,263
Hey.

646
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,901
You can count me in.

647
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:05,874
Really?

648
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,707
Let's bring
your old man down.
Oh, great.

649
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,305
[people chattering]

650
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,575
(boy)
Give me a drink.

651
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,311
It's just a great group.
Okay, uh, Tigers.

652
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,348
[blowing whistle]

653
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,147
Look who's here.

654
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,014
I'll give you a hint.

655
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,687
Hall of Fame?

656
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,491
Chicago Bears?

657
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,428
Sammy Sosa?

658
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,521
No, no, no.
Come on.

659
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,895
No, football.

660
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,524
Coached the 1986--

661
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,533
'85.

662
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,571
Uh, '85 Bears
to a Super Bowl victory?

663
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,798
It's Mike Ditka.

664
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,101
[people applauding]
Yeah.

665
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,605
Do you know Sammy Sosa?

666
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,200
Hey, zip it, kid!

667
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,040
I'm a coach that knows
about winning.

668
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,139
I'm gonna push you guys
like you've never
been pushed before.

669
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,809
Some of you are
gonna wish I was dead.

670
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,909
It's true.

671
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,920
I know it's a weird thought,
but it's true.

672
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,650
I eat quitters for breakfast
and I spit out their bones.

673
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,713
Delicious.

674
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,919
Now this is gonna be
the hardest
most difficult thing

675
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,894
you ever attempted
in your entire life.

676
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,158
You know what
when it's over--
It will get emotional.

677
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,790
When it's over...
When it's over...

678
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,858
...you guys are
gonna be champions.
Champions.

679
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,732
By God, you're
gonna be champions.

680
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,169
All right, everybody up.
Come on.

681
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,331
Come on, hands in.

682
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,465
Come on, everybody.
Let's go out
and kick some butt.

683
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,409
Here we go. On three.
Let's have fun.

684
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,914
(all)
One, two, three.
Let's have fun.

685
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,881
"Let's have fun?"
What's that?

686
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,042
I just made it up.

687
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,287
On the ground,
give me the pushups,
come on.

688
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,982
If you guys
were with the Bears,

689
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,024
I'd fine you each
$10,000 apiece.

690
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,855
This calls for some
drastic measures.

691
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,020
We're gonna make
some changes around here.

692
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,327
Come on, move it.
Move it! Faster! Faster!

693
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,994
(Byong Sun)
Faster. Faster.

694
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,037
Move it! Move it!
Put some pressure
on those legs!

695
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,164
(Byong Sun)
Faster. Faster.

696
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,634
No candy!
Your mother said
you can't have any candy!

697
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,733
Please. Give me it back.

698
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,869
No candy.
Please. No. Please?

699
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,441
Hey! I got eyes
in the back of my head.

700
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,677
[all groaning]
Come on, girls.
You gotta move it.

701
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,813
You gotta move it.
All the way!

702
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,379
Come on, move it. Move it.

703
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,426
But, coach, how is this
gonna help me with soccer?

704
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,523
It's not gonna
help you with soccer,

705
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,895
but I'm gonna get
my trash taken out, okay?

706
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,861
Come on, Beyonce,
let's get that
back end done.

707
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,667
Uh, Coach? Shouldn't we
be going to soccer practice?

708
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,468
I'm not going to
soccer practice
with a dirty car.

709
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:17,797
[whistle blowing]

710
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,037
Here we go, gang.
Let's go, Tigers. Come on.

711
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,408
Let's go get them.

712
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,470
(Ditka)
Come on,
kick butt out there.

713
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,917
You're great.

714
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,076
[whistle blows]

715
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,210
Hey, Sam.

716
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,412
Yeah?

717
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,652
What is it, Dad?
How you doing?

718
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,248
Good.
Good. Good.

719
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,481
Ow!

720
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,585
What was that for? Jeez!

721
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,555
Did you just
kick your son?

722
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,223
Yeah.

723
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,029
[blowing whistle]

724
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,830
[people cheering]

725
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,529
Stop them! Come on.
Stop them!

726
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,403
Stop them! Stop them!

727
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,736
Are you following me?
No.

728
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,398
[groans]

729
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,466
Oh.

730
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,039
[groans]

731
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,012
Oh.

732
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:58,950
(Sam)
Uh.

733
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,075
[whistle blows]
Oh.

734
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,314
Shake it off, Sam.
Get some circulation
back in your skull.

735
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,348
(Ditka)
Go, Jack, go.

736
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:09,719
[whistle blowing]
Yes.

737
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,352
Yeah! Good job, Jack!

738
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,953
[children cheering]

739
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,498
That's a legitimate goal,
right?

740
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,658
That's a real goal.

741
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,962
Okay, then,
that's a real goal.

742
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,696
10 more of those
and we're in business.

743
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,139
Look at me,
I'm the ref. I'm the ref.
I'm the ref.

744
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,279
(referee)
All right. Very funny.

745
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,076
You can't catch me
if you want,
because I'm the ref.

746
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,085
Okay. Very funny.
Very, very funny.
Very funny.

747
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,181
All right. You all had
a laugh? Fine! Play on!

748
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,280
Sorry about that.

749
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,949
How much do you think
those things are?

750
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,015
I have no idea.

751
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,085
Oh.

752
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,054
[grunts]

753
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,565
[people applauding]

754
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,125
[people cheering]

755
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,227
(Connor)
Man!

756
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,362
(all)
2, 4, 6, 8, WHO--

757
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,736
Shut up you little rats!

758
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,604
They're just showing
their appreciation.

759
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,904
Forget the appreciation.

760
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,070
I wanna win a soccer game!

761
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,945
Okay.

762
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,208
Hey, can I have this?

763
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,977
Yeah, go ahead.
All right!

764
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,217
Uh, good game, everyone.

765
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,845
Great effort.
Come on, let's go.

766
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,288
We'll just reconvene
at a later time.

767
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,430
All right, everyone.

768
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,491
Uh, if I could
have your attention.

769
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,469
I got a little something
for the Tigers here

770
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,699
to express my--my gratitude

771
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,434
and, well,
just a big thank you

772
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,702
for all the hard work.

773
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:32,765
(woman)
All right!

774
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,833
So, uh...

775
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,846
So what'd you bring, Phil?

776
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,211
Finches.

777
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,510
Fishes?

778
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,279
No! No, no, no. No.
Finches. Birds.

779
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,546
I'm holding them.

780
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,315
They're tiny birds.

781
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,654
Yeah, so everyone,
come up here
and grab a finch.

782
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,218
Come on. Come on, guys.

783
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,962
You can watch them grow,
right in front of
your, uh, very own eyes.

784
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,531
[birds twittering]

785
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,000
We have to keep them?

786
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,535
You get to keep them.

787
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,662
Why is this fun?

788
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,605
(Buck)
I want to welcome you all
to tonight's

789
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:07,008
Highland Heights
Soccer Organization
parent's dinner.

790
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,476
Every year,
we like to take
a little time

791
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,518
for the coaches
to come up here

792
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,076
to tell us a little
about their team.

793
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,178
(man)
All right.

794
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,951
How about I bring up
someone who's new
to coaching in this league,

795
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,491
but is close to me?

796
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,119
I love him like a son.
Come on up, Phil.

797
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,526
(all)
Come on, Phil.

798
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,894
Come on, Philly. Come on.

799
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,455
Go. Yes.

800
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,362
Good guy. Good guy.

801
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,960
[man whistling]

802
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,603
Good to see you.

803
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,135
Thanks, Dad.

804
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,775
Uh, thanks, Janice.

805
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,376
Hello, uh,

806
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,612
I'm, uh, I'm Phil Weston.

807
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,151
And you got balls!

808
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,208
[audience laughing]

809
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,546
He's got vitamins.

810
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,147
[audience laughing]

811
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,653
That's very funny, Dad.
Hilarious.

812
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,991
So when I took over
for Coach Benson--

813
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,553
I hear he's a woman now.

814
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,894
[audience laughing]

815
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:02,990
Ooh.

816
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:06,002
Actually, uh, truth be told,
no one knows
where he is right now.

817
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,662
A lot of people
are concerned.

818
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,331
[audience laughing]

819
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,068
I don't know
why that's funny.

820
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,776
God, I'm going to be honest,
I--I didn't plan on
speaking tonight.

821
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,444
I--I was-- I was
actually hoping that

822
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,783
my--my assistant coach
would be here,

823
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,655
uh, to kind of...

824
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,520
[audience murmuring]

825
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,423
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce
Mike Ditka.

826
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,628
[audience cheering]

827
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,495
It's Mike Ditka, everyone!

828
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,534
Say a few words.

829
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,799
Thanks, Paul,
thanks, everybody.
It's--It's great to be here

830
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,364
and, uh, gonna have
a lot of fun tonight.

831
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,875
Paul's got the Tigers
on the move.

832
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,036
All right!

833
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,343
You live long enough,
you see everything.

834
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:53,714
Iron Mike and Aluminum Phil
coaching the Tigers.

835
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,309
[audience laughing]

836
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,251
I couldn't really hear you.

837
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,052
My Super Bowl ring
was making too much noise.

838
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,814
Ooh.

839
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,686
You see it, Dad?
Right there, Dad.
That was a great one.

840
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,390
Read it and weep.

841
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,228
[audience applauding]

842
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,701
Ditka is a great coach,
we understand that,
but he's a football coach.

843
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,794
Understand?
Right.

844
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,396
And we are
still losing, Phil.

845
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,941
Okay, I understand
your concern about our record,

846
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,204
but with me
it's not about win-lose.

847
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,769
We are going to win one game
eventually, right?

848
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,212
Well, we've had
a rocky start,

849
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,479
but with
a strong team effort,
we will win some

850
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:29,981
I think.

851
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,252
Remember,
there's no "l" in team.

852
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,255
But there is an "l"
in win.

853
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,383
There is an "l" in win.

854
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,484
Hey, wait.

855
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,583
Uh, parents,
Honey.

856
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,324
I didn't see you step up
when the team was in need.

857
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,490
Okay.
Okay.

858
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,693
Phil is not
the greatest coach
in the world,

859
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,633
I'll give you that,
but at least he's trying.

860
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,829
I can defend myself,
please.

861
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,702
You think he enjoys losing
week after week,

862
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,797
in front of his own son?

863
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,899
You're making it worse.
You're making it worse.

864
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,841
What's with the birds?
That was weird.

865
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,039
I've got my hands full
with Hunter.
I don't need a bird.

866
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,275
Okay, you know what?
You got me. All right?

867
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,873
The finches were
a bad idea.

868
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,977
And I wasn't going to
say this, but I think
some of them have salmonella.

869
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,578
A fair amount, in fact.
What?

870
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,454
I may have inadvertently
poisoned your children.

871
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,160
You and l,
we got something going.

872
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,753
You know, maybe we can coach
the Little League together.

873
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,195
You really
think that, huh?
Yeah.

874
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,493
Coach Ditka?
Yes?

875
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:20,526
Hi. Um, uh, our son,
Byong Sun, he's very shy
and I was just wondering--

876
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,334
Sure. Yeah, I'd be glad to.

877
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,738
Thank you so much.

878
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,866
How do you spell that?

879
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,276
It's, uh, Byong Sun.
B-Y--

880
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,335
I think I got it.

881
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,574
Oh, oh, okay,

882
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,013
Okay?
thank you.

883
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,015
Bye-bye.

884
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,073
Thanks, Phil.

885
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,382
Yeah. They're great.

886
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,443
Just a wonderful couple.

887
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,955
(Phil)
Yeah.

888
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,591
Bing Bong?

889
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,721
Hey, Philly.

890
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,929
Yeah, Dad.

891
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,396
Hey, I've been
meaning to talk to you

892
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,161
about this Ditka thing.
I don't like it one bit.

893
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,531
Yeah, well, he's right here.

894
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,864
I'm not blind.

895
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,427
What, are you trying
to stick it to the old man?

896
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,370
You go to my mortal enemy
for help?

897
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,204
That's no way
to talk about your neighbor.

898
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,208
Oh, yeah?

899
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,369
He's right.

900
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,039
I hated him
from the first time
I laid eyes on him.

901
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:06,015
Maybe even before that,
because I know
you're the guy that wrote

902
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,949
"Ditka sucks" on my driveway.

903
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,179
What are you
even doing here?

904
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,244
You're just doing this
to get under my skin.

905
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,653
I'm glad you figured it out.

906
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,986
And I'm getting under
your skin.

907
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,049
It's gonna get
a lot worse
before it gets better.

908
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,685
In your dreams.

909
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,296
Ooh.

910
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,492
Hey, why don't you take
that pretty young wife
of yours and go home?

911
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,625
What did you call her?

912
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,464
(Phil)
Hey guys, please.
It's a compliment.

913
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,026
I said she's lovely
and she's young.

914
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,164
She's the light of my life.
You don't talk about her.

915
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,229
I go home when I want.

916
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,242
It's Mike Ditka. He's big.
Stay out of this.

917
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,471
I'll tell you
for the last time.
Hit the road!

918
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,603
Who's gonna make me?
I am.

919
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,704
You're acting like-- Oh!

920
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,446
I took a punch
from Hall of Famer,
Mike Ditka,

921
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,315
and I did not go down.

922
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,753
Sure, I wobbled a bit,
but I did not go down.

923
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,518
That Ditka has fists
like a small truck.

924
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,392
Come here.

925
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:52,690
[thumping]

926
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,853
Okay.

927
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,089
[groans]

928
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,861
Yeah, you need to relax.

929
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,333
Yeah.

930
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,530
You should've
seen the look
on my dad's face.

931
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,594
Priceless.

932
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,298
'Cause that punch
was meant for him,

933
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,103
that's what
makes me feel so good.

934
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,736
Okay, Phil,
can we please not talk

935
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,905
about your dad
or Ditka tonight?
Please?

936
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,950
I--l... You just need
to relax.

937
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,410
You're right.
Yeah.

938
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,009
I'm sorry.
Okay.

939
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,784
Yeah, I just get--

940
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,117
[both moaning]

941
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,154
[sobbing]

942
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,186
I'm in
way over my head.

943
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,926
I got punched in the face
and it hurt.

944
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,697
Honey, come on,
the kids need a real coach.

945
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:32,667
Phil?

946
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,704
Yeah?

947
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,703
I love you.

948
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,138
What does that have
to do with anything?

949
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,371
Okay. I quit.
I give up. I give up.
You go talk to Ditka.

950
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,676
What for? He scares me.

951
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,782
Have you ever
looked into his eyes?

952
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,281
Or at his hair?

953
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,718
Well, he's been coaching
for a long time.

954
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,187
Share your feelings
with him.

955
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,190
You want me
to share my feelings
of inadequacy

956
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,316
with Mike Ditka?

957
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,190
Uh. What else can you do?

958
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,592
[sighs]

959
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,188
Okay. You're right.

960
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,664
You're right.
You're always right.

961
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,602
I'm sorry.
I'll go talk to him.

962
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,764
Okay?
Okay.

963
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,102
And, Phil...
Yeah?

964
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,438
try not to cry
in front of him.

965
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,306
[bawling]

966
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,273
Hey, hey, get a grip
on yourself, okay? Man up.

967
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,338
I can't.

968
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,214
You better or else
I'm gettin' out of here.

969
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,877
Here, drink this coffee.

970
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,582
I don't like coffee.
It's a vasoconstrictor.

971
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,954
Hey, coffee is
the number one drink
in the world.

972
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,117
Everybody drinks it.

973
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,525
Even little kids in Mexico
drink coffee.

974
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,655
Well, I'm not a little kid
in Mexico.

975
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:37,132
[sobbing]
Okay? In fact,
I don't know who I am.

976
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:41,467
I took a long hard look
at myself in the mirror,
and you know what I saw?

977
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,528
What?

978
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,631
Nothing.

979
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,335
My dad, he's something.

980
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,572
I mean, I've never
lived up to my dad's
expectations.

981
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,446
And to top it all off,
I'm letting Sam down.
My own son!

982
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,384
Ah. Hey!

983
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,544
Ow!

984
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,417
Knock it off.
I don't care about that.

985
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,251
Why is everyone
slapping me lately?

986
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,723
Drink the coffee.
It'll make you
feel better.

987
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,783
I don't-- I don't like...

988
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:04,850
[sniffing]

989
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,728
Um, uh,

990
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,733
Yeah. Uh-huh.
yeah, it's good.

991
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,462
Picks you up.
It calms you down.

992
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,062
It's the lifeblood
that drives the dreams
of champions.

993
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,128
Oh.

994
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,902
Now, you gotta tell me
the problem,

995
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,409
but if you cry,
I'm out of here.

996
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,413
I--I can't do it.
I can't coach.
I can't beat my old man.

997
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,143
You can beat your dad!
He's just a man.

998
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,276
This coaching business,
Paul, is tough stuff.

999
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,250
Phil.

1000
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,844
Whatever. It's tough stuff.

1001
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,787
And when you lose,
it all comes down on you.

1002
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,484
But listen,
when you put it
all together,

1003
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,584
and you win,
it's the greatest feeling
in the world.

1004
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,060
It's like
winning the Super Bowl.

1005
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,391
Really?
Yeah, really.

1006
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,454
Except, you saddled me
with a bunch of stiffs.

1007
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,432
Take me 3 years
to get these guys
shaped up.

1008
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,525
I'm sorry.

1009
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,229
But I got a good idea.

1010
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,933
Maybe we take a shortcut,
stick it to your old man
real good.

1011
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,534
But in order to do that,
we gotta get
some fresh meat.

1012
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,578
Okay.

1013
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,704
(Umberto)
Keepa this up,
you get nowhere in meat.

1014
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,873
[speaking ltalian]

1015
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,814
Maria, the prosciutto.
It's almost 10..00.

1016
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,908
(Maria)
Okay.

1017
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,009
Umberto!

1018
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,075
Hey, coach.

1019
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:07,090
Don't you worry,
I got you bratwurst
all ready.

1020
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,486
Hello.

1021
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,549
Beautiful. Grazie.

1022
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,062
[speaking ltalian]

1023
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,153
Right.

1024
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,631
Are your nephews
working today?

1025
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,031
Uh, si, in the back.

1026
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,035
Go back and take
a look at these guys.

1027
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,965
Really?
Yeah, yeah.

1028
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,062
(Umberto)
Maria?

1029
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,004
[both speaking ltalian]

1030
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,377
[whispering]
Wow!

1031
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:37,779
Oh, they're terrific.

1032
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,789
Pretty impressive, huh?

1033
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,025
[both whooping]
Yes!

1034
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:47,592
These kids are the right age,
and they live in the district.
Why not?

1035
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,828
[speaking ltalian]

1036
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,494
Uh, excuse me, mister.
Your--Your two nephews...

1037
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,502
(Umberto)
Si?

1038
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,597
Uh, would--would they be
interested in, uh,
playing soccer?

1039
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,073
Massimo e Gian Piero?

1040
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,166
(Phil)
Yeah.

1041
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,040
No, no, no,
they not play soccer.

1042
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,444
They come here
to apprentice me.
Yeah.

1043
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,505
They have too much
to learn.

1044
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,211
You know, English, meat.
Too much.

Pizza. Pizza.

1222
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,683
How do you
say "spaghetti?"

1223
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,519
Spaghetti.

1224
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,552
Italian is easy.

1225
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,286
Thank you.
Hello.

1226
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:08,262
Hello.

1227
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,356
Where're you
from?

1228
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,422
Australia.

1229
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:11,591
Oh, that's
a lovely accent.

1230
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:12,600
Thank you.

1231
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,068
You still waiting

1232
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,070
Yes.

1233
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,835
Make sure you get
one of these sleeves.
I burned myself last time.

1234
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:18,875
Thanks for the tip.

1235
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,569
It's something you
don't know at first.

1236
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:21,633
[screams]

1237
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,341
? Let's get it started ?

1238
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,609
Would you look at

1240
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,413

00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,153
Okay, Bucky,

You should have
saw it.

1245
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,730
They just score and
score and score

1246
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,460
and score and score
and score and score.

1247
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,434
It was all too much,
I had to take an Advil,

1248
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,436
and I'm like, I got,
like, a headache almost.

1249
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,267
You should get some
ltalians on your team.

1250
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,637
It's like ba-boom!
Ba-boom!

Right.

1259
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,720
Guatemalan with
a little Ethiopian.

1260
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,194
Absolutely.

1261
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:17,791
Aw.

1262
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,358
That's--That's
not coffee.

1263
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,926
That's my Russian vodka!

1264

[boys cheering]

1265
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,607

1266
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,642
No! Mom!

1267
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:26,937
UV index
is very high today.

1268
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,534
I'm in the middle
of a game, come on!

1269
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,239
I know. But your skin's
more important.

1270
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,303
Mom, come on.

1271
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:32,643
Okay, go!

1272
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,775
Keep passing

Don't forget

1280
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,472
Hey, hey!

1282
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,838
Hey.

Are you serious?

1284
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,419
I'll go change

1285
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,647
Hurry up.

1288
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,996
Yeah.

1289
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,063
Hey, Philly.

1290
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,137
[sighs]

1291
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,194
Smells good.

1292
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,240
Yeah.

1293
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,467
They're
sirloin burgers.

1294
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,530
No, I mean the air.

1295
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,598
What?

1296
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,076
Smells fresh.
Yeah.

1297
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,169
What do you
mean?

1298
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,235
Beautiful day.

1299
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,338
Yeah.

1300
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,280
Couldn't ask for
a more beautiful day.

1301
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,282
I'm feeling
fully alive.

1302
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,854
Tigers have won
five in a row.

1303
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,552
The ltalians and Ditka
have won five in a row.

1304
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,727
We're 500.

1305
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,123
Yeah,
we're 1,000.

1306
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,354
Look, Dad,
I got a feeling

1307
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,194
we're gonna make
it to the finals.

1308
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,699
You what?
Gonna go where?

1309
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,167
Yeah.

1310
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,293
You're serious?

1311
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,803
Yeah, you bet I'm serious.

1312
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,005
[chuckling]

1313
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,142
Looks like somebody needs
to be taken down
a couple of notches.

1314
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,339
What is the law, Phil?

1315
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,382
Stop it, Dad.

1316
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,848
The law says..

1317
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,010
"You shall never beat
the old man at anything."

1318
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,110
Just serve.

1319
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:18,154
Okay.

1320

Oh, foul, foul, foul!
Come on!

1324
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,900
You a little klutzy?

1325
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,027
All right.

1326
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,794
Okay,
here we go.

1327
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,837

1329
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,637
Sorry.
Huevos Rancheros.

1330
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,239
You wanna quit now?

1331
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,475
No, no, no, no, no.

1332
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,708
[grunts]

1333
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,310
Oh!

1334
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,045
[chuckles]

1335
00:49:58,862 --> 00:49:59,954
Ole!

1336
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,319

00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,024
[laughing]

1338
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:08,995
You okay?

1339
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,130
Serve it.

1340
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,777
[groaning]

1341
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,610
Phil? Honey?

1342
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,911
Don't talk to me,
it's father-son time!

1343
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:25,944
[chuckling]

1344
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,193
Come on.

1345
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,863
Somebody should be
videotapin' this.

1346
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,631
Ooh. Who's your trainer?

1347
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,308
Stop talking and serve!

1348
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,334
Maniac.

1349
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,751
Now, I bury you.

1350
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,391
Bury you!

1351
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:02,747
Bury you!

1352
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,315
Bury you!

1353
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,553
Yeah.

1354
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,465
I'll see you inside.

1355
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,660
Okay.

1356

[chuckling]

1357
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,371
That's the best
I've ever played
against him.

1358
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,212
Yeah, it didn't grind
the barbecue to a halt at all.

1359
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,109
Ow.

1360
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,950
You made
an excellent impression
on your son, by the way.

1361
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,715
Hey, l--I almost had you.

1362
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:41,721
What do you call that again,
when you almost win?

1363
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,494
Oh, yeah, yeah, losing.

1364
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,675
I'll tell you, Dad.

1365
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,010
The Tigers are
making it to the finals.

1366
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,378
That ain't
never gonna happen.

1367
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,508
Oh, yeah?

1368
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,417
Never.

1369
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,417
You wanna make a bet?

1370
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,480
Yeah.

1371
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,581
Yeah?

1372
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,684
Fine. Okay.
We'll bet.

1373
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,262
I beat you,

1374
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,164
and you sell that break-even
snake-oil stand of yours.

1375
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,962
And you're gonna
come to work for me.

1376
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,764
No. No, I'm not
gonna work for you.

1377
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:22,827
Uh? Oh.

1378

1379
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,471
Okay, okay,
okay, okay. Stop.

1380
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,042
Okay. But if I win...

1381
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,349
What?

1382
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,643
I get the Pele ball.

1383
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:38,647
Do what?

1384
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,280
If I beat you
in the finals,

1385
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,353
Pele ball.
It's mine. I get it.

1386
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,398
(commentator)
Here comes Pele.

1387
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,061
A little high
and into the crowd.

1388
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,301
I got it! I got it!

1389
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,566
No. I got it.

1390
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,071
[people clapping]

1391
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,266
Yeah!

1392
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,467
Dad?

1393
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:02,168
What?

1394
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,269
Can I have the ball?

1395
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,371
For what?
I caught it. Why?

1396
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,040
You get
the next one.

1397
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,911
If I beat you in the finals,
I get the Pele ball.

1398
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,647
For the day.

1399
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,018
Forever.

1400
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,023
No way, Jose.
No, sir. No way.

1401
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,686
[imitating chicken clucking]

1402
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,186
[all laughing]

1403
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,633
All right. All right.

1404
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,327
Yeah?

1405
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,065
We got ourselves a bet,
okay?

1406
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,299
All right.

1407
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:31,904
Good.
Good.

1408
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,272
Good.
Yes.

1409
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,343
See you tomorrow.

1410
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,309
Okay. Good.

1411
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,812
Yeah, I think we're gonna
have to cut you off, sir.

1412
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:47,513
Ooh.

1413
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,388
Not a chance.
Gotta go feed the meter.

1414
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,824
Line 'em up.

1415
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,860
Your wife told me about

1416
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,424
the bet you made
with your old man.

1417
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,969
Oh, yeah?
What of it?

1418
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,327
I think maybe

1419
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,736
you're getting
ahead of yourself.

1420
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:05,468
We played the easy
part of our schedule.

1421
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:06,839
We gotta win
five games in a row

1422
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,343
just to make
the semifinals.

1423
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,469
So maybe you should--

1424
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,309
Maybe you should
worry more about the team

1425
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,541
and less
about the schedule.

1426
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:13,605
What?

1427
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,310
There's a lot of
slothfulness going on.

1428
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,352
Slothfulness?

1429
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,511
Yeah.

1430
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,020
Let's go, Tigers.
Bring it in.

1431
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,555
Bring it in, guys.

1432
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,423
Let's go.

1433
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:24,951
Grab some bench.

1434
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,155
Look how much time it takes
for them to come in.

1435
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,993
Take a seat.
Let's go.

1436
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,030
Okay, guys.

1437
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,167
I had you come
here early today,

1438
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,636
so we could talk
about some sloppy play.

1439
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,102
It's come
to my attention

1440
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,110
that lately,
I've noticed

1441
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,476
a general,
blatant disregard

1442
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,809
for our game plan.

1443
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:48,942
Ambrose.

1444
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:49,986
Yeah?

1445
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:51,543
I saw a bunch of
nonsense out there.

1446
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,646
What was going
through your head
out there last week?

1447
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,281
I was breaking
my back for you, Coach,

1448
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,950
because of my love
for the game.

1449
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,153
Liar!

1450
00:54:58,595 --> 00:54:59,892
Jack.
What?

1451
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,692
Who are you supposed
to pass the ball to?

1452
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:02,732
The ltalians.

1453
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,857
Right. Alex, when?

1454
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,457
When I come in
contact with the ball.

1455
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,696
The instant you come
in contact with the ball.

1456
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:08,897
That's our strategy.

1457
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,837
It's one of the many plays
we've worked out.

1458
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,602
It's the only play
we've worked out.

1459
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,701
How many sarcastic pills
did you take this morning?

1460
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:15,802
Coach,
I'm just saying--

1461
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:16,903
"But, Coach..."

1462
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,675
[mocking]

1463
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,111
You gotta
lighten up.

1464
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,312
He started it.

1465
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,990
I seem to remember
a certain little boy

1466
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,958
who was very
sad when he lost.

1467
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:33,052
And that same little boy
was very happy when he won.

1468
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:35,387
I'm doing this
for you, okay?

1469
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:36,932
So that
we can have fun.

1470
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,393
Right? Fun. Okay.

1471
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,401
Yeah.

1472
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,069
Hey,
you're--you're late.

1473
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:44,766
Wh-Wh-Where've
you been?

1474
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,902
Uh,
there's a problem.

1475
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,568
Wait, where's Gian
Piero and Massimo?

1476
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,145
We were supposed
to pick them up.

1477
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,747
Hey, what's going on?

1478
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,974
[speaking in ltalian]

1479
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,744
[all gasp]
Where are my ltalians?

1480
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,210
Huh?

1481
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:02,357
I can't afford to
lose this one, Umberto.

1482
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,785
Meat is now.
Me and the boy will work

1483
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,624
all day to get
this order done.

1484
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,561
It's a big, big order.

1485
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,429
No, no, no. I... Believe me,
I know. Meat comes first.

1486
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:12,468
Sure.

1487
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,901
I've only heard it about
a thousand times from you.

1488
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,769
I can't talk to you.
Here, you take this.

1489
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,638
(Phil)
I'm really getting
sick and tired of

1490
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,267
"the meat comes first."
I'm sorry.

1491
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,402
? Happy birthday ??

1492
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,776
Quiet please!

1493
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,741
Shut up!
I'm on the phone.

1494
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,407
You're not
the only one in the park.

1495
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,543
You know, at a certain point,

1496
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,109
these kids just
wanna play soccer.

1497
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:32,711
They don't care
about the meat.

1498
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,656
Uh, do I have to say that?
'Cause that's gonna cause

1499
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,158
some kind of
a dramatic situation here.

1500
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,321
What are you saying, eh?

1501
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,728
What? Hello? Umberto?

1502
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,231
Umberto?

1503
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,527
All right, guys.

1504
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:51,368
We got 25 minutes
and a lot of beef to cut.

1505
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:52,806
Let's get to it.

1506
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,271
[saw whirring]

1507
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,903
(Phil)
Watch me, boys, I'm goin' in!

1508
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,210
Whoa!

1509
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,609
[horn blaring]

1510
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:06,944
[all yelling]

1511
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:20,191
[gasps]

1512
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,849
We made it.
Sorry we're late.

1513
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:42,647
Hey, Stew.

1514
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,056
Hey.

1515
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,824
Uh. Listen. One of-- One of my
guys didn't bring his socks.

1516
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:49,831
So, we forfeit.

1517
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,795
You hear that, Vultures,
we forfeit. Let's go.

1518
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,201
[whistle blowing]
Come on! Run!

1519
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,431
Hurry, run quickly!

1520
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,337
Run! Run to the car! Run!

1521
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,171
Don't look back! Run!

1522
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:01,968
We won!

1523
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,069
We won.

1524
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,302
[all cheering]

1525
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:08,375
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

1526
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,214
Vultures. Vultures.

1527
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:11,583
Yeah!

1528
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,018
Good job, guys.

1529
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,061
Phil, it's freezing out here.

1530
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,425
It's not Phil.
It's Coach Weston.

1531
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,294
And it's not
freezing out here.

1532
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,561
Then why did you
build a fire?

1533
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:29,768
Because fire is
the stuff of warriors.

1534
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,007
And that's what we are,
right? Warriors?

1535
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,011
The Hopi lndians
called fire...

1536
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,978
[speaking gibberish]

1537
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,982
Coach, what are we
doing out here, anyway?

1538
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,850
We're bonding.
We're becoming a team.

1539
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,686
Surviving the elements,
here in the backyard.

1540
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,490
Coach, did you order
the pizzas yet?

1541
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,893
In due time, Connor.
In due time.

1542
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:58,163
However,
I want all of you to know

1543
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,498
if the pizzas don't arrive,

1544
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,437
I've already
made the decision

1545
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,132
that we will eat Byong Sun.

1546
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,634
All right.
We're not gonna eat him.

1547
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,271
But he does look delicious,
you have to admit, right,

1548
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,905
if we had to eat someone?

1549
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,041
Dad, you're
getting a little creepy.

1550
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,277
I know,
let's all bay at the moon.

1551
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,578
What?

1552
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,849
You know, howl like a wolf.

1553
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,051
[howling]

1554
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,490
(woman)
Shut up out there!

1555
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,258
You shut up in there!

1556
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,831
Come on, everyone.
Bay at the moon.

1557
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,025
[howling]

1558
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,396
[all howling]

1559
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,900
[barking]

1560
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,870
[all screaming]

1561
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:46,871
[dogs barking]

1562
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,123
(woman)
Ooh, I don't know.

1563
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,920
The lrish Cream
sounds good, huh?

1564
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,585
What's that?

1565
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,993
Uh, it's cream
and it's, uh, it's lrish.

1566
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,463
Hurry up and order.

1567
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,164
Excuse me. Thank you.

1568
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,003
How about a smoothie?
What's in that?

1569
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,707
Smoothie's a juice drink.
We want coffee.

1570
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,799
Buddy, relax.

1571
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:14,865
No, you relax.

1572
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,969
I'm a regular here.
This line needs to move.

1573
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,638
I beg your pardon.

1574
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,307
Do you have scones?

1575
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:21,907
Tall, non fat,
double latte--

1576
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,475
Sir, you're at
the back of the line.

1577
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,542
I recognize that!

1578
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,952
Cut it out or
you're out of here.

1579
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:26,954
You can't
kick me out!

1580
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,048
You know,
you're--you're really
invading my ear space.

1581
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,387
I'm a frequent
coffee drinker.

1582
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,018
I'm part of the club.
I have a card.

1583
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,722
Do you have a card?
Do you have a card?

1584
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,956
No, I don't
have a card.

1585
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,191
Does anyone here
have a card?

1586
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,789
We don't have
frequent drinker cards.

1587
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,266
[screams]
That's a video club card.

1588
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,495
Zip it there,
Sporty Spice.

1589
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,628
Are we doing this?
Is this
happening now?

1590
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:43,797
Yeah. Wanna go?

1591
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,033
Great.
I'd love to.

1592
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,700
Let's do it. Come on.

1593
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,267
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me!

1594
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,040
What is wrong
with you, Derrick?

1595
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,240
I thought
we were friends!

1596
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,407
My name is Andy!

1597
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,917
Your name is Liar,
'cause you're telling lies.

1598
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,213
You know what the odds are

1599
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,820
I will never come
back here again?

1600
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,116
There's a good
chance of that!

1601
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,622
That's a chance
we'll have to take.

1602
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,352
Okay, if that's how
you want to play it.

1603
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:05,223
Okay.
I am disappointed!

1604
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,556
Good.

1605
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,062
Get the door! Get the--

1606
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,464
[indistinct chattering]

1607
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,062
Fine!

1608
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:16,737
[whistling]

1609
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,104
Tigers, bring it in.
Let's go.

1610
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:20,598
Let's go, guys.

1611
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,666
[whistle blowing]

1612
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,110
All right, Tigers.

1613
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:34,553
Let's get ready
to play, huh?

1614
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,922
I don't wanna see
any laziness there, okay?

1615
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,756
We win this,
we're in the finals.

1616
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:41,490
If we get a big lead,
we gotta pummel these guys.

1617
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,395
We gotta pummel them
at all costs.

1618
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,364
Dominate and hammer them.

1619
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:46,934
I want you to play dirty,

1620
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,164
if you have to,
but don't get caught.

1621
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,832
Byong Sun, stay low, okay?

1622
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,535
That's easy for you.

1623
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,543
Just chop block them
in the back of the knee.

1624
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,805
That'll work well.

1625
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,141
Ambrose, you're big.

1626
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,805
Don't be afraid
to throw the elbow.

1627
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,281
If you break
someone's collarbone,

1628
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,545
that's a good thing.
That's what the medic's for.

1629
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,053
Otherwise,
he's just sitting around,
all right?

1630
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,214
You hear me?

1631
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,587
Hey, Phil.

1632
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:10,851
I--l--I don't think that's
a very good attitude.

1633
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,952
You can't talk about
hurting other players.

1634
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,828
You don't think?

1635
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:17,826
You don't-- you don't think?

1636
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,561
I don't think you
should be butting in

1637
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,068
when I'm talking
to my team.

1638
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,764
You're my assistant, okay?

1639
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,397
You're supposed to
back me up

1640
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,271
and go get me juice boxes
when I tell you.

1641
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:27,741
Now go get me
a juice box.

1642
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,300
You know who
you're talking to?

1643
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:30,709
I'm talking to
the juice box guy.

1644
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,906
You're crazy!

1645
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,573
I'm not crazy.
I'm just thirsty.

1646
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:34,911
Why don't you
go to hell?

1647
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,918
No, you go to hell!
While you're there,

1648
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:38,920
why don't you
grab me a juice box!

1649
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:40,888
I'm no juice box boy,
I'll tell you that!

1650
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,322
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!

1651
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:43,585
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!

1652
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:44,921
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!

1653
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:46,018
You're like your old man!

1654
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,084
I'm not like
my old man!

1655
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,222
If it weren't for these kids
I would whip your butt!

1656
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,265
I can take a punch!

1657
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,493
I'm out of here.
Bye-bye.

1658
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,795
I'll see you,

1659
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,733
Mr. Big Time Coach.
Bye-bye!

1660
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,863
I'm not like my old man!
I'm a kind and gentle,

1661
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,873
compassionate human being,

1662
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:01,337
with a heart
as big as a lion!

1663
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,875
We'll see you later,
juice box!

1664
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,914
Everyone wave goodbye
to juice box.

1665
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:08,575
Literally wave. Do it!

1666
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,515
Parents, too!
Everyone waves!

01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:15,152
Okay. Guys...

1669
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,526
I only want
winners out on the field.

1670
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:20,027

Who's a winner?

1671
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,862

01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:22,989

I am.

1673
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,259

1678
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:30,497
What?

1679
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,732
(all)
Tigers.

1680
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,299
All right. Let's break
someone's clavicle. On three!

1681
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:37,403
One, two, three.
Break someone's clavicle!

1682

Move it! Move it!

1685
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,041
Huh.

1686
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,021
Pick up that
piece of trash, Tom.

1687
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,521
Tuck in your shirt!

1688
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,292
What are you doing?
Have a sense of pride, huh?

1689
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,720
In fact,
why don't you take a lap?

1690
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,589

01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,474
[all shouting]

1749
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:29,844
Honey!

1750
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,347
(Forest)
Okay. All right.
That's it. I got this.

1751
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,617
(Barbara)
Hold him down.
Phil!

1752
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:36,919
Get the rope!

1753
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,017
What in the world
happened to your dad?

1754
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:41,290
I don't know.
But I'll tell you one thing.

1755
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:44,288
I'm never drinking
coffee as long as I live.

1756
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,389
[explosion]

1757
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:49,697
Wow!

1758
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,371
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow! Wow!

1759
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,037
What a day!

1760
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,839
Wh-What is with the coffee?

1761
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,606
Every home in Europe has
its own coffee press.

1762
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,047
In fact, every room.

1763
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:02,976
Okay,
you know what, Phil?

1764
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,077
You gotta stop.
You've gone overboard.

1765
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,548
What are you talking about?

1766
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:09,250
You called a group of
10-year-olds "losers."

1767
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:10,483
I did not.

1768
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,787
You screamed it
through a cone.

1769
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:12,850
Everyone heard you.

1770
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:15,055
What do you want me
to call them? Winners?

1771
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,099
'Cause that would
make me a liar, okay?

1772
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,100
And at least, give me that.
I am not a liar.

1773
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,465
You just lied, just a--
When?

1774
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,696
Just a second ago!
When?

1775
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,295
About the cone thing!

1776
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,397
Okay, you got me
on that one.

1777
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:26,998
That's one lie,
though.

1778
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,369
We're in the finals.

1779
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,412
Am I the only one
who cares about that?

1780
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:31,773
Where's Sam?

1781
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,541
Well, Sam's up in his room.

1782
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:35,277
Very upset. Very depressed.

1783
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,079
Depressed? We won.

1784
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,653
You didn't play him,
Phil.

1785
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,986
I warned you about,
this has become all
about you and Buck.

1786
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,184
That is patently untrue.

1787
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,693
And as far as Sam not playing
in the game, that's his fault.

1788
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:46,727
What?

1789
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,230
He needs to speak up, okay?
I can't worry
about every player.

1790
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:51,289
I can't talk to
you about this.
No, not anymore.

1791
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,800
I don't even
know who you are.

1792
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,301
You're not human,
that's for sure.

1793
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,860
You're like some
kind of animal.

1794
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:56,962
An animal?

1795
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,472
Yes, like a wild animal.

1796
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,598
Where are you going?

1797
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:00,642
I'm going.

1798
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,975
Coffee will make
you feel better.

1799
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,823
? The eye of the tiger ??

1800
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,156
(Phil)
Barbara, are you there?
Pick up. It's me.

1801
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,563
Game's about to start.

1802
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,067
Where's Sammy?
I thought you guys
were gonna meet me here.

1803
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:28,431
Hello? Hello?

1804
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,672
You know what,
I gotta run.

1805
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,766
What are you?
Who dresses you these days?

1806
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,778
What's this,
some kind of clown outfit?

1807
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,178
No.
It's a Tiger outfit.

1808
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,745
Good. Good.

1809
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,879
Some of the cool stuff
I can do.

1810
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,111
And you think this
suit's gonna help you?

1811
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,652
We'll see.
Might be a good luck charm.

1812
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,361
Okay, good luck, Son.
You're gonna need it.

1813
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:54,418
[chuckles]

1814
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,403
Bring it in. Let's go.
Huddle it up. Come on.

1815
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:06,839
Coach, um, where's Sam?

1816
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,274
Because I don't
see him anywhere.

1817
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,141
He'll be here.
Don't worry about it. Okay.

1818
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,146
[whispering]
Guys, listen up.

1819
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:17,515
Now I don't think it needs
to be said more than once

1820
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,653
how important
today's game is, huh?

1821
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,815
[whispering]
This is what we've
worked all year for.

1822
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,415
Why are you whispering?

1823
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,083
For dramatic effect!

1824
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,362
Who are those
guys over there, huh?

1825
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:28,521
(boys)
Tigers.

1826
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,859
They look like
pussycats to me.

1827
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:31,194
What do you say?
Yeah.

1828
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:32,256
Afraid of 'em?

1829
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,323
(boys)
No!

1830
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,334
Okay.

1831
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,462
You step on this field,
this is all about you.

1832
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,406
I mean, I'm not gonna be
the one staying up
late at night,

1833
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:42,000
you know, punching a hole
through the window

1834
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:45,137
or crying myself to sleep
or wetting my bed.

1835
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,416
Okay? That's not gonna be me.

1836
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:49,644
'Cause I'm fine.

1837
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,413
I got my vitamin store
to go back to.

1838
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,580
I'm gonna be just great.
I'm gonna be great.

1839
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,385
Let me hear you say
that we can do this.

1840
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:56,446
We can do this!

1841
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,685
Again.
We can do this!

1842
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,921
One more time.
We can do this!

1843
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,519
You either win

1844
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,293
and go on to greatness,
or you lose.

1845
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:08,294
And probably face a series of
cataclysmic events

1846
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,837
for the rest of your lives.

1847
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,296
Bring it in, guys.

1848
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,398
[whispering]
Bring it in.

1849
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,739
Tigers on three. Whisper.

1850
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,706
One, two, three.

1851
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,507
[all whispering]
Tigers.

1852
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,776
One, two, three, Gladiators!

1853
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,179
(Jim)
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

1854
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:27,347
and welcome to the HHSO
Championship game.

1855
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,015
I'll be giving
you a play-by-play,

1856
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:30,718
blow-by-blow of
what promises to be

1857
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:31,918
the game of the year.

1858
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,359
Look alive!

1859
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:35,486
Tigers versus the Gladiators.

1860
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,560
Gladiators with the ball.

1861
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,167
Immediately
stolen by Massimo!

1862
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,395
Go!

1863
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,766
Defense!
Push deeper! Deep! Deep!

1864
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,830
He kicks it high.
It's a perfect pass!

1865
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,569
Shot! Goal!

1866
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:48,769
Yeah!

1867
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,472
??[singing]

1868
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,640
Are you ready for this?

1869
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,321
The Gladiators with
some good ball movement.

1870
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:03,150
Shot! It's off the mark.

1871
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,053
Give it up, Dad!

1872
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:07,027
It's a long game, sonny!

1873
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:10,996
Hey, grab the pebble
from my hand, Grasshopper!

1874
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,461
What?

1875
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,162
Hey!
If it isn't fart-face Jones.

1876
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,398
What's up,
farty pants?

1877
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,198
Bring it on.

1878
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,206
You can have
the first punch right here.

1879
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:24,370
I could eat a box of cookies
for dinner if I want to.

1880
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,708
What? Can you do that? No.

1881
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,248
'Cause you're
a fart-face kid.

1882
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:30,308
Oh, my God!
No! Tigers! Help me!
Get him off me!

1883
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:31,508
[blowing whistle]

1884
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,077
Get him, Logan.
Attaboy, Logan.

1885
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:34,315
Ow! He's got my ear.

1886
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,290
He's got my ear!

1887
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,389
He's like a jackal from hell!

1888
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,464
(Jim)
Italians with the ball.

1889
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,001
And they pass it of
to little Byong Sun!

1890
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:49,866
Pass it off! Pass it!

1891
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,236
Do it! Shoot it,
Byong Sun. Shoot it!

1892
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,275
No! No, no.

1893
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,366
[grunts]

1894
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,774
(Jim)
Oh! Weak kick!

1895
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:58,745
Stolen away and
kicked way downfield.

1896
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,445
Gladiators moving the ball.

1897
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,246
Hunter, catch up!
Catch up.

1898
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,617
They find Bucky Weston
in the open.

1899
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,349
He shoots! Score!

1900
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,447
Yes!

1901
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,786
Gladiators tie the game.

1902
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:11,485
Byong Sun!

1903
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,462
What was that?

1904
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,086
I thought
I had the shot.

1905
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,154
You thought?

1906
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:18,824
How many times do
I have to say this?

1907
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:21,961
You can take as many shots
as you want during practice.

1908
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,104
But never ever
in a game.

1909
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,004
Especially not
the championship game.

1910
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,406
Okay,
you cannot talk to him--

1911
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:28,704
No, no, no.
Don't go there.

1912
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,608
Take a seat.
Go ahead.

1913
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,344
(Ann)
Ease up on him!

1914
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,344
You ease up on that
corduroy jacket of yours.

1915
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:36,840
[referee whistling]

1916
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,120
(Jim)
Gladiators moving the ball.

1917
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,450
[referee whistles]
Oh! Number 14 goes down.

1918
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,220
Come on! That?

1919
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:46,420
Good call, ref!

1920
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:47,462
That's a bad call!

1921
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,621
All right, coaches!

1922
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,791
Coaches here, now!

1923
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,097
God! That's a bad call,
you know it!

1924
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:55,136
Hey, hey, hey.

1925
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,193
That's a bad call!

1926
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:57,329
Hey! Hey,
I'm warning you.

1927
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:58,395
Let me ask you a question.

1928
01:12:58,474 --> 01:12:59,463
Let me ask a question.

1929
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,338
How much you pay him
to make those calls?

1930
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,173
You are one wisecrack away

1931
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:04,678
from being thrown
out of this game.

1932
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:05,975
I don't want to
get thrown out.

1933
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,141
Can't a guy just be
enthusiastic about the game?

1934
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,377
You can be
enthusiastic...

1935
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:10,440
That's all I want to do.

1936
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:11,611
...at a respectable level.

1937
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:12,813
I just wanna have fun.

1938
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,651
Now, go to
your places!

1939
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,554
And keep your
comments to yourself.

1940
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,228
Wow! What was
that all about?

1941
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,796
Here's all I heard.

1942
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:23,797
The ref said....

1943
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:24,798
[sputtering]

1944
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:25,856
Then my Dad said...

1945
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,060
[sputtering]

1946
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,330
Then the ref said....

1947
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,393
[sputtering]

1948
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:30,961
Any more questions?

1949
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,132
Hit the road. Move it.

1950
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:34,605
[referee whistling]

1951
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,410
[boys cheering]

1952
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,636
(Jim)
Massimo with the ball,

1953
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,705
trying to pass it
off to his brother.

1954
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,407
Come on!

1955
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:45,217
But Buck Weston
has figured out
this Tiger offense.

1956
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,219
Go!

1957
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:47,277
[chuckles]

1958
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,517
(Phil)
Get back on defense!

1959
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,288
What did I just say?

1960
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,490
Bucky with another open shot.
Goal!

1961
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:58,692
Yes!

1962
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,826
Gladiators take the lead.

1963
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:02,003
Was anyone listening?

1964
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,628
The Italians have effectively
been shut down.

1965
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:05,070
Great.

1966
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:05,629
(Janice)
That's my boy!

1967
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:07,534
[whistle blowing]

1968
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:08,769
That's the half.

1969
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,177
Honey, wh-where have you been?

1970
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,683
I called you twice.

1971
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:19,285
What? Why isn't Sam
in his uniform?

1972
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:20,343
So, how's it going?

1973
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,447
It took me all morning
to convince him to come.

1974
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,992
And the only reason he is here
is to support his team.

1975
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,651
What, he doesn't
want to play for me?

1976
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,218
He would love to
play for you

1977
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,288
but you've turned
him into a benchwarmer.

1978
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:31,764
Sound familiar?

1979
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:33,958
Look, I just wanted

1980
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:36,504
to get to
the championship game, that...

1981
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,336
Well, you're here, Phil.

1982
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,979
I'm not crying.
It's frustration.

1983
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:49,711
Don't worry.
You'll be all right.
Gonna be all right.

1984
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,777
If you play the second half
the way you
played the first half,

1985
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,346
I'm gonna trade the whole team
to the Tigers next year.

1986
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:58,086
Can I go in now?
I have fresh legs.

1987
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,354
(Buck)
Philly, I can't.

1988
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:01,020
It's the championship game,
all right?

1989
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:02,324
Don't bother me, okay?

1990
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,058
I didn't play
the week before, either.

1991
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,692
I promise you,
I'll play you
next season, okay?

1992
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:07,894
You want to be Gladiators?

1993
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,902
(boys)
Yeah!

1994
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,233
Let's say,
"We are Gladiators."

1995
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:11,294
(boys)
We are Gladiators!

1996
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,170
Say it again!
We are Gladiators!

1997
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:16,541
Okay, go out
in the second half,
I want you to stay focused.

1998
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,707
You doing okay?
I know this is tough.

1999
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:23,216
Hey, guys.

2000
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,048
Sam, you think
I could talk to you?

2001
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:27,750
I guess.

2002
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,714
Honey, do you mind?

2003
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,450
Sure.

2004
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:38,065
So, I just
was thinking, uh...

2005
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,431
You know,
grown-ups are always
telling kids

2006
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,266
how they mess up, right?

2007
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,397
But the truth is

2008
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,308
sometimes
grown-ups screw up

2009
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,573
but we don't have anyone to
tell us when we do it.

2010
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:53,009
I screwed up, Sam.

2011
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,207
You think?

2012
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:58,615
I just got caught up
in everything.

2013
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,914
I really lost my way,
I mean,

2014
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,690
I apologize.

2015
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,325
I just wanna ask
you if you-- if you can

2016
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,161
find it in your heart
to forgive me

2017
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,264
and you give me
a second chance,

2018
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:14,825
I'd like to
make it up to you.

2019
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,300
Okay.

2020
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:20,869
You accept
my apology then?

2021
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,271
Yeah.

2022
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,538
Thanks, buddy.

2023
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:27,673
All right. You're
starting the second half.

2024
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,443
(Sam)
Really?

2025
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:30,712
Yeah.

2026
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:32,950
You're not worried
about losing the game?

2027
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,886
No, I'm worried
about losing you.

2028
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,284
I brought
your uniform
just in case.

2029
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:38,326
So, go suit up.

2030
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:39,360
All right.

2031
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,986
Okay?

2032
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:44,397
Good job.

2033
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:45,500
Thanks.

2034
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,357
Now, give me
that jacket.

2035
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,063
Oh.
It's bad?

2036
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:50,104
Horrible.

2037
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,139
Okay.

2038
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:52,195
(Phil)
Hey, guys.

2039
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,333
Everyone take a seat,
if you would.

2040
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,535
I have something important
I'd like to tell you. Um...

2041
01:16:58,914 --> 01:16:59,903
[sighs]

2042
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:03,479
I just want you guys to know
that I know that I blew it.

2043
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:06,614
I--l--l--I completely blew it.

2044
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:11,053
And we should've just been
having fun all along

2045
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,287
and honestly,
I don't know what happened.

2046
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:16,497
And I owe you,
I owe all of you an apology.

2047
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:19,832
I am very, very,

2048
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:24,568
very, very sorry.

2049
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:28,802
With a capital "S"
and a capital "ORRY."'

2050
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,273
You know what I mean.

2051
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,572
You--You guys are great kids.
You're unique

2052
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,811
with--with--with your own
strengths and talents,

2053
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,819
and I should've
been promoting that.

2054
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:41,745
Instead, I wasn't,
'cause I'm a lousy coach

2055
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,290
and I didn't
teach you anything.

2056
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:44,620
That's not true,
Dad.

2057
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,388
(all)
What?
What are you talking about?

2058
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:47,587
He's a lousy coach.

2059
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,789
He didn't teach me anything.

2060
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,161
(Byong Sun)
He tried to kill me.

2061
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,826
He taught us exactly how
not to play soccer.

2062
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,096
Actually, Sam's right.

2063
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,899
That's exactly what I did.

2064
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:00,866
We just need to
take the field

2065
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,534
and you guys
just do e-e-exactly

2066
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,841
the opposite of
everything I've taught you.

2067
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,073
Does that make sense?

2068
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:07,945
What have l-- What have l
told you to do?

2069
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,643
Always play the ltalians.

2070
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,447
Okay. There you go.

2071
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:12,679
Gian Piero, Massimo,

2072
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,221
we'll get some
fresh legs in there.

2073
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:15,415
Give you guys a rest?

2074
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:16,650
Rest?
Yeah.

2075
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,215
Okay. Grazie.

2076
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:19,282
Thanks.

2077
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,589
Wh-What else
have I taught you?

2078
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:22,391
Break people's clavicles.

2079
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,522
Chop block.

2080
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:25,257
Tattoos are cool!

2081
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:26,867
Don't remember that one.

2082
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:28,197
Coffee is the lifeblood

2083
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,067
that fuels
the dreams of champions.

2084
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,003
Right. Hold on.

2085
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,540
[all cheering]

2086
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,446
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

2087
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:45,552
(Mark)
Way to go, Byong Sun!

2088
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,483
[all cheering]

2089
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,326
All right. What else?

2090
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,890
The most important
thing is winning.

2091
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:58,598
No. No, no, no, no.
The most important thing

2092
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,863
is--is having fun and
trying your best, all right?

2093
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,637
So, let's get out there
and do everything

2094
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:06,765
the opposite of
what I've taught you.

2095
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,272
Sound like a plan?

2096
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,574
Bring it in. Here we go.

2097
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:12,806
Yes.

2098
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,382
(Phil)
What are we gonna do?

2099
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,974
(boys)
Don't listen to Phil!

2100
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:20,644
Take the field.
Here we go, guys. Have fun!

2101
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,590
(Jim)
Down by one,
the Tigers have both Italians

2102
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:25,057
sitting on the bench?

2103
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,061
Odd move by
Coach Phil Weston.

2104
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,493
Stop them, guys!

2105
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,635
Goal, and the Tiger
goalie goes down hard!

2106
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:35,794
Oh, my--

2107
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:36,838
(Buck)
That's it.

2108
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,271
That's the intensity
I've been looking for.
That's it.

2109
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,174
The Tiger goalie looks okay.

2110
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,769
Hey, ref? Injury?
Time out?

2111
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:46,313
Coach Weston is
taking no chances.

2112
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,712
Time out.
Everyone with glasses.

2113
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:49,214
Can I borrow your glasses?

2114
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,649
Would you mind?
Thank you.

2115
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,083
I appreciate that.

2116
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:53,678
You look like
you need those.

2117
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,646
Thank you.
Appreciate that.

2118
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:56,915
(Phil)
You all right?

2119
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,016
Yeah, I'm all right.

2120
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:00,288
Just want to do a
little vision test here.
All right?

2121
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,360
Is that better
or worse?

2122
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,396
Worse.

2123
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:04,355
Better or worse?

2124
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:05,399
Worse.

2125
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:07,801
Better or worse?

2126
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,092
Better!

2127
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:10,604
Okay. Put those on.
Let's go, guys.

2128
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:12,003
Okay. All right.
Come on.

2129
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,062
Thanks.

2130
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,568
He's okay.

2131
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,140
(Jim)
Play resumes.

2132
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:24,515
The Gladiators still
dominating the field.

2133
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:29,080
Wow. An amazing save
by the Tiger goalie!

2134
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,215
Yes!
That's my baby!

2135
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:31,589
He stopped that goal.

2136
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,130
Tigers with the ball.

2137
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,929
Mark! Mark!

2138
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:40,990
On the neck!

2139
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:42,001
Yes!

2140
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,602
Mark Avery kicks the ball up,

2141
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,265
catches it on
the back of his neck.

2142
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,433
Yes.

2143
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:50,171
The rest of the Tigers are
forming some kind of wedge.

2144
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,769
Break through.
Win the ball back!

2145
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,405
Knock those clowns down.

2146
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,375
Mark Avery leads the league

2147
01:20:57,452 --> 01:20:59,352
in the least amount of
time played.

2148
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,780
Hey, keeper.

2149
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:07,485
Ew!

2150
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,024
Mmm.

2151
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:16,092
[gags]

2152
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:19,371
Ambrose with
a powerhouse kick!

2153
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:23,938
[referee whistling]

2154
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,775
Yeah!

2155
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:28,040
[boys cheering]

2156
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,849
Yes!

2157
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:32,852
Hunter, I'd give you a kiss
but you just ate a worm.

2158
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,147
Yeah! Can you smell it?

2159
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,190
Yeah! All right, Mark!

2160
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:37,816
It's the smell
of victory, baby!

2161
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,383
I love you, Dad!

2162
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,526
See if you love me
at the end of the game.

2163
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:43,291
Let's go, guys. Stay focused.

2164
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:45,625
Every time you say
something back to me,

2165
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,292
it makes me love you more!

2166
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:49,467
I can't-- I can't
believe this.

2167
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,736
(Jim)
Hunter is tearing down
the field!

2168
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,837
And he kicks
the ball to Jack.

2169
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:02,540
Get over there!
Go, Hunter!

2170
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,313
Jack takes
the ball into the corner.

2171
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:10,547
Whoa! It's a little bit high.

2172
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,955
Wait a second,
what's going on?

2173
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,762
It's like they're forming
some sort of mega person.

2174
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,627
Did everyone see that?

2175
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:23,133
[whooping]

2176
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:27,433
A header by Byong Sun from
Ambrose's shoulder for a goal.

2177
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:29,238
Way to go, Bing Bong!

2178
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:31,370
That's not legal.
Is that legal, ref?

2179
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,038
Great hustle.
Gian Piero and Massimo.

2180
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:34,513
You're back in.
Okay.

2181
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:36,072
But remember,
share the ball.

2182
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,243
Okay.
Team.

2183
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,014
Right? Team.
Yeah. Good. Good, good.

2184
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:40,645
Okay, guys.

2185
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:42,683
(Jim)
The Italians are back in.

2186
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:44,384
And Massimo steals the ball.

2187
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,764
Less than
a minute left to play.

2188
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,529
The Gladiators are
completely out of sync here.

2189
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:59,800
And the ball goes
to Ambrose who fakes.

2190
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:02,843
Watch it! It's a trap!
Stay with the ltalians!

2191
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,640
(Barbara)
Come on, Sam!

2192
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:11,275
You're gonna have to
get past old,
uncle Bucky for this one.

2193
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,718
Here's something
your dad never taught you.

2194
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:39,370
[all cheering]

2195
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:41,210
Goal!

2196
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,108
[referee whistling]

2197
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:48,950
And you can
put it on the board.

2198
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:50,856
[blowing whistle]

2199
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,488
That's the game!

2200
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,495
Tigers win! Tigers win!

2201
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,162
(Phil)
Way to go, guys!

2202
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,529
(Tom)
Nice job, everyone!

2203
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:03,826
[whooping]

2204
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,531
(Ann)
Come on, honey!

2205
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:11,469
(Phil)
Sammy!

2206
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,350
Where did you learn
to move like that, Sam?

2207
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,477
I practiced every time
you benched me.

2208
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,616
(boys)
Tigers! Tigers!

2209
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:26,685
[boys chanting]

2210
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:31,826
Great game, Bucky.

2211
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,231
A hell of a game, bro.

2212
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:34,700
I guess we really
got out-coached.

2213
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:35,929
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

2214
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:36,936
And I'm serious.

2215
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,336
I don't give
compliments lightly.

2216
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:39,600
This is from the heart.

2217
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:41,141
I'm not blowing
smoke up my butt.

2218
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,642
I think you mean
smoke up my butt.

2219
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,143
No. Dude,
just take the compliment.

2220
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,577
You got it.

2221
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:47,474
I'll see you later.

2222
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:48,675
See you at the barbecue.

2223
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,481
[all cheering]

2224
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:54,321
Good job.

2225
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:55,481
Sorry, Grandpa.

2226
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:57,286
What, are you kiddin' me?

2227
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,719
If anyone's gonna beat me,
I'm glad it was you.

2228
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,260
Great goal, Samson.

2229
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:03,728
So, you're not mad?

2230
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:05,629
The only thing
that makes me mad

2231
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,601
is that I let you get away
from the Gladiators, okay?

2232
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:09,659
[chuckles]

2233
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,370
I'll never be mad at you.
Never.

2234
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:17,878
(Phil)
Burgers look good, right?

2235
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,038
That one's dead.

2236
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,014
This one needs
to be turned. Okay?

2237
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:22,049
Looks good to me.

2238
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,084
You'll learn.

2239
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:24,209
[machine humming]

2240
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,150
Hey, Ditka!
Knock it off, would you?

2241
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:27,518
Would you knock it off?

2242
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:28,886
Dad, relax.
Here, I'll handle it.

2243
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:29,946
Yeah.

2244
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:30,991
I'll talk to him.

2245
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:34,693
Hey, Buck.
Yeah?

2246
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:36,753
Remember when we beat you
in the championship?

2247
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:37,855
Yeah.

2248
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:40,924
Remember when, uh, when
I shoved that kid in the pool?

2249
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:42,024
Whoa!

2250
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:44,632
[gasping]

2251
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,268
Okay, Buck.
You got me good, buddy.

2252
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:49,310
Yeah.

2253
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:50,605
How do you want
your hamburger?

2254
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:51,838
Well done. Thanks, Buck.

2255
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,540
Okay. You got it.

2256
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,707
Hey, coach!

2257
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,078
Yeah?

2258
01:25:58,753 --> 01:25:59,981
Hey.

2259
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:01,750
Hey.

2260
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:05,186
Um, I don't know if you heard,
we won the championship.

2261
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:06,284
Yeah, I heard.

2262
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:07,419
Yeah.

2263
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:10,225
Look, I just wanna say
I'm sorry for the way I acted.

2264
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:11,560
Hey, let me
tell you something.

2265
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:12,930
You were
a ravin' maniac.

2266
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,026
Yes, I was.
I was a maniac.

2267
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:17,195
Yeah, but I see you
changed your ways.

2268
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:18,665
And man,
down the stretch,

2269
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,674
you did one great job
of coaching those kids.

2270
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:24,643
Thank you. It means a lot.

2271
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,704
So, can I count on
you for next year?

2272
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:28,009
No.

2273
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:31,779
Okay. But you and l,
we're good?

2274
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,109
We're good.

2275
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,348
Good.

2276
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:35,787
How about you
and your old man?

2277
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,188
Better. Yeah.

2278
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:40,794
Listen. I mean no disrespect
to you and your family.

2279
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,928
But my job in life is

2280
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:45,192
to make your dad's life
a living hell.

2281
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,128
Hey, do what you gotta do.

2282
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,191
I gotta do it.

2283
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:50,328
I'm about to make
good on that Pele bet.

2284
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:51,667
You wanna come
over and watch?

2285
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:53,070
Yeah, I'd love to
but I gotta get

2286
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,541
all these leaves over in
that yard before nightfall.

2287
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:57,701
Right.

2288
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:06,317
We had a bet.
You won fair and square.

2289
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,820
Good job.

2290
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:10,482
Yes.
Thank you.

2291
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:14,754
I don't say this enough

2292
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:17,263
but you really stepped up.

2293
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:18,492
I'm proud of you, Son.

2294
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:20,195
I appreciate that.

2295
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:22,662
The real Pele ball.

2296
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:23,704
Yep.

2297
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:24,863
I'm actually
touching it.

2298
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:25,928
Take good care of it.

2299
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:28,373
That means an awful
lot to me, that ball.

2300
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,035
It does,
doesn't it?

2301
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:32,238
Yeah.

2302
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:36,709
Here.

2303
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:37,716
What?

2304
01:27:37,785 --> 01:27:38,911
You keep it.

2305
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,417
No. You won fair and square.
It's yours now.

2306
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,479
No.

2307
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:44,650
You beat me, Philly.

2308
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:46,455
Well, the Tigers
beat you.

2309
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:48,726
I mean I had a good time
kicking your butt,

2310
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:50,661
I'm not gonna lie,

2311
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:51,994
but i-i-it's not
about winning.

2312
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:53,624
I thought it was.
It's not.

2313
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,499
About--About
you and me,

2314
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,830
you know, the--the ball
is just a metaphor

2315
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:01,272
about the distance
between us.

2316
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:02,468
It's a soccer ball.

2317
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:03,805
No, no, no, Dad.

2318
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:05,243
I-l-It's not
about the ball.

2319
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,110
It was never
about the ball.

2320
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:09,140
I don't want the ball.

2321
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:11,578
Then what do you want?

2322
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:15,683
(announcer)
And now an important message
from the King.

2323
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:17,555
Hi, I'm Buck Weston.

2324
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,149
King of sporting goods.

2325
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:21,354
And to make my stores
the best they can be,

2326
01:28:21,429 --> 01:28:23,761
I've teamed up with my son.

2327
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,757
Hello,
I'm Phil Weston.

2328
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:29,161
And I'm
the Prince of Viitamins.

2329
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:31,738
(Buck)
Now, you can get all your
health supplement needs

2330
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:34,366
at Buck and
Phil's Sports Kingdom.

2331
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:37,275
At prices so low,
it'll blow your top.

2332
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,342
Don't worry,
kind sir.

2333
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:42,007
We've got
something for that, too.

2334
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,515
See?

2335
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:49,783
I do see,
Prince Phil.

2336
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:51,950
Now in five
convenient locations.

2337
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:53,526
I'm Buck Weston.

2338
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,094
And I'm
Phil Weston.

2339
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,757
(both)
And we've got balls.

2340
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,197
And vitamins.

2341
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,894
But mainly, balls.

2342
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,731
(all)
And vitamins!

2343
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:07,134
These guys
couldn't win a salad bowl,

2344
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:08,799
Iet alone a Super Bowl.

2345
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,207
(Diana)
Mike, I smell smoke.

2346
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:11,438
Nobody's smokin'.

2347
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,139
Besides,
I'm the king in this house

2348
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:14,941
and I can do what I want.

2349
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:16,305
Got you!

2350
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,408
Okay, honey.

2351
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:18,884
??[We Can Work It Out
by Stevie Wonder playing]

2352
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,713
? Try to see things my way ?

2353
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:25,415
? Do I have to keep on talking
till I can't go on ?

2354
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:28,325
? While you see it your way ?

2355
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:32,164
? Run the risk of knowing that
our love may soon be gone ?

2356
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,730
? We can work it out ?

2357
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,334
? We can work it out ?

2358
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:39,664
? Think of what
you're saying ?

2359
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:41,571
? You can get it wrong ?

2360
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:43,974
? And still think
that it's all right ?

2361
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:46,473
? Think of what I'm saying ?

2362
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:49,115
? We can work it out
and get it straight ?

2363
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:50,912
? Or say good night ?

2364
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:52,848
? We can work it out ?

2365
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:55,319
? We can work it out ?

2366
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:12,769
? Work it out
when you're dating ?

2367
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:15,107
? Work it out
when you're dating ??
