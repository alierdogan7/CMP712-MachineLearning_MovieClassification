1
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,991
Berlin, Germany

2
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,280
You didn’t wake me.

3
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,323
You were sleeping.

4
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,410
You let me sleep because you can’t
bear to have breakfast with me.

5
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,538
Nothing could be further from the
truth. I boiled you an egg. See?

6
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,164
I’d hardly have boiled you an egg
if I didn’t want to see you.

7
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,083
Tea or coffee?

8
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,711
Does any woman ever stay long
enough to find out

9
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,964
what the hell
goes on in your head?

10
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,800
What are you doing tonight?

11
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,762
I’m seeing my daughter.

12
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,892
Your daughter? You’ve kept very
quiet about her.

13
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,812
Have I?
She’s been abroad for a year.

14
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,690
Did you say tea?

15
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,401
I’m going.

16
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,948
Give my love to your daughter.

17
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,814
Tickets please.

18
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,560
Neustadt, West Germany, 1958

19
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,685
Hey, you!

20
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,006
Your feets!

21
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,070
Hey, kid.

22
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,614
Up.

23
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,910
It’s alright

24
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,465
Where do you live?

25
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,387
It’s here.

26
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:07,307
I’ll be fine now.
Thank you.

27
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,602
Goodbye

28
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,196
Look after yourself.

29
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,704
I’m worried about him.

30
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,997
He looks terrible.

31
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,040
The boy’s saying he doesn’t need a doctor.

32
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,210
- He does.
- I don’t need a doctor.

33
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,211
Good then.
- Peter!

34
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,912
We’re not going to argue about this.

35
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,469
Remind me, how old are you now?

36
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:46,680
Michael’s fifteen.

37
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,349
It’s scarlet fever.

38
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,728
He’ll be in bed
for several months. At least.

39
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,230
In completely isolation.

40
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:59,443
Emily, keep away. He’s contagious.

41
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,487
Emily?

42
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,048
How are you feeling?

43
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,634
Better.

44
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,512
I meant to tell you..

45
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,889
the day I got ill...
a woman helped me.

46
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,974
She helped you?

47
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,727
Yes. She brought me home.

48
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,147
Do you have her address?

49
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,353
Yes?

50
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,004
I brought you these flowers.

51
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,047
To say thank you.

52
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,342
Put them over there.

53
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,365
I would have come earlier, but I’ve
been in bed for three months.

54
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,367
You’re better now?

55
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,037
Yes, thank you.

56
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,914
Have you always been weak?

57
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh no. I’d never been ill before.

58
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,628
It’s incredibly boring.

59
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,172
There’s nothing to do.

60
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,092
I couldn’t even be
bothered to read.

61
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,973
Well, thank you again.

62
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,518
Wait.

63
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,855
I’ll walk with you.
I have to go to work.

64
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:48,070
Wait in the hall while I change.

65
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:41,076
There are two more buckets downstairs.
You can fill them and bring them up.

66
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,731
You look ridiculous, look at you, kid.

67
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,653
You can’t go home like that.

68
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:23,285
Take off your clothes.
I’ll run you a bath.

69
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:47,476
Do you always take a bath in
your trousers?

70
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,742
It’s all right, I won’t look.

71
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,019
I'll get you a towel.

72
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,332
That’s why you came back.

73
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:35,102
You’re so beautiful

74
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,022
What are you talking about?

75
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,993
Look at me kid.

76
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,623
Slowly.
Slowly.

77
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,539
You’ve inconvenienced your mother.

78
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,459
How many more times?
I’ve said I’m sorry.

79
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,212
You scared her.
- I got lost, that’s all.

80
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,089
That’s why I was late.
Can I have some more?

81
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,842
How can anyone get lost in their
own home town?

82
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,720
I meant to head for the castle, I
ended up at the sports-field.

83
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,639
They’re in opposite directions.
- It’s none of your business.

84
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,723
He’s lying.

85
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,059
He’s not lying.

86
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,729
Michael never lies.

87
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,150
Dad, I’ve decided, I want to go
back to school tomorrow.

88
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,402
The doctor says you need another
three weeks.

89
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,112
Well I’m going.

90
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,657
Peter!

91
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,201
Like this?

92
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,620
That's right!

93
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,919
Not so fast.

94
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,269
It's alright!

95
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,689
Do it again.

96
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,130
What's your name?

97
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,256
What?

98
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,383
Your name?

99
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,094
Why do you want to know?

100
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,348
I’ve been here three times.

101
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:03,560
I want to know your name.
What's wrong was that?

102
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,146
Nothing, kid...

103
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,690
There's nothing wrong with that

104
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,400
It's Hanna.

105
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,820
It looks so suspicious

106
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,281
What’s yours, kid?

107
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,909
Michael.

108
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,748
So I'm with Michael.

109
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,709
Hanna.

110
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:33,298
The notion of secrecy is central to
Western literature.

111
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,802
You may say the
whole idea of character

112
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:41,306
in fiction is defined by people holding
specific information

113
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:49,022
which for various reasons.
- Sometimes perverse... Sometimes noble

114
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:54,903
They are determined not to disclose.

115
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:09,835
You never tell me what you’ve been
studying.

116
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,546
Studying?

117
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:16,008
At school.

118
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,054
Do you learn languages?

119
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,473
Yes.

120
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,059
What languages?

121
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,645
Latin.

122
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:35,110
Say something in Latin.

123
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,362
Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? Aut cur
dexteris aptantur enses conditi?

124
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,283
Aut cur dexteris aptantur
enses conditi?

125
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,036
It’s Horace.

126
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,955
It’s wonderful.

127
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:50,459
Do you want some Greek?

128
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,431
Oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon
oi da naon phais epi gan malainan

129
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:08,018
emmenai kalliston, ego de ken otto
tis eratai.

130
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,229
It’s beautiful.

131
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,981
How can you tell?

132
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:17,110
How do you know
when you’ve no idea what it means?

133
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,032
What are you studying in German?

134
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:25,035
I'm studying a play

135
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,038
Well, I’m writing a play.
By a writer called Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.

136
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,206
You’ve heard of him?

137
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,084
The play’s called Emilia Galotti.

138
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,836
You can read it.

139
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,463
I’d rather listen to you.

140
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,049
Allright.

141
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,686
Act One.
Scene One.

142
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:53,355
The setting:
one of the prince’s chambers.

143
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:55,941
The Prince:

144
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,111
I'm not very good.

145
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,697
Go On!

146
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:06,243
"Complaints, nothing but complaints."

147
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,206
For goodness’ sake, is there anything,
live for work?"

148
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:16,003
just imagine that people actually envy us.”

149
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:19,965
You’re good at it, aren’t you?

150
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,178
Good at what?

151
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,474
Reading.

152
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,480
What's funny?

153
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:40,569
I didn’t think I was good
at anything.

154
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,867
What are you doing?
What is it?

155
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,703
Why did you treat me like if you didn't know me?

156
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,413
You didn’t want to know me!

157
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,624
You can see I was in the first carriage.
So why did you sit in the second?

158
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,376
What did you think I was doing?

159
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,211
Why the hell do you think I was there?

160
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:22,963
How should I know.
I need a bath.

161
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,799
You know I've been working.

162
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,552
I'd like to be by myself

163
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,722
Could you please, leave?

164
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,937
I... I didn’t mean to upset you.

165
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:43,067
You don’t have the power to upset me.

166
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:46,372
You don’t matter enough to upset me.

167
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:06,483
I don’t know what to say.

168
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:11,280
I’ve never been with a woman before.

169
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:17,077
We’ve been together four weeks

170
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:21,373
and I can’t live without you.
I can’t!

171
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:25,544
Even the thought of it kills me.

172
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:35,387
Kid, you thought we could make love
in a tram?

173
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:39,892
kid, myœla the eœ that we will
kochaæ is the tram?

174
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:49,735
Is it true what you said?
That I don’t matter to you?

175
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:04,958
Do you forgive me?

176
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,841
Do you love me?

177
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,235
Do you have a book?

178
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,861
Yes, I have.

179
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:36,240
I took something
with me this morning.

180
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,242
What is it?

181
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:42,287
"The Odyssey" by Homer.
It's my homework.

182
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:47,709
We’re changing the order we do things.

183
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,878
Read to me first, kid.

184
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:53,715
Then we make love.

185
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,428
"The Odyssey" by Homer.

186
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,305
What’s an odyssey?

187
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,850
It’s a journey.
He sets out on a journey.

188
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,394
Good.

189
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:11,733
“Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the
man of twists and turns...

190
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,486
Driven time and again off course,
once he had plundered

191
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,573
The hallowed heights of Troy.

192
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,117
Come here!

193
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,418
"You press your hand
to his lips."

194
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,254
"She was dead"

195
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:35,591
"Pass all hed."

196
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:46,727
"I poked into the place aways and
encountered a little open patch

197
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:52,024
as big as a bedroom.
All hung around with vines.

198
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,568
and found a man lying there asleep,

199
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:57,350
and by Jinks,
it was my old Jim..."

200
00:28:57,717 --> 00:29:06,097
"- When you learn it. I'll rec catch up land with shout you...

201
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,460
“Lady Chatterley felt his naked
flesh against her as he came into

202
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:14,588
flesh against her as he came into her.

203
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:17,341
For a moment he was still
inside her...

204
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:20,344
This is disgusting.

205
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,888
Where did you get this?

206
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:26,016
I borrowed it from someone at school.

207
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,852
You should be ashamed.

208
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,149
Go on.

209
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:39,613
‘Blistering Barnacles and a
thundering typhoon. It is water.'

210
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,824
‘But what on earth did you expect
it to be?’

211
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,408
Whisky.

212
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,869
Whisky! By thunder, whisky.

213
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:47,996
‘Whisky?

214
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:49,873
Come now captain, you
can’t be serious.’

215
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,043
That’s enough for today, kid.

216
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,004
I was wondering...
Do you think you could get some time off?

217
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:59,132
Maybe we could go for a trip.

218
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,467
What sort of trip?

219
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:02,594
Bicycling holiday.

220
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,430
Just for two days.

221
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,436
I’ve got a guide-book.
I’ve worked out the route.

222
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,647
Look!

223
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:16,525
What do you think?

224
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:23,240
I think you like planning, don’t you?

225
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:40,299
“I’m not frightened.

226
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:43,719
I’m not frightened of anything.

227
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:48,515
The more suffering,
the more I love.

228
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:52,269
“Danger will only increase my love,

229
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:56,106
it will sharpen it,
it will give it spice.

230
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,068
I’ll be the only angel you need.

231
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,989
You will leave life even more beautiful
than you entered it.

232
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:08,327
Heaven will take
you back and look at you and say

233
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,996
‘Only one thing can make a soul
complete,

234
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:12,414
and that thing is love.’

235
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:51,453
Excuse me.

236
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,998
Do you know what would you like?

237
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,920
What are you having?

238
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:03,465
You order.
I’ll have what you have.

239
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:09,179
Two a skip the potato...

240
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:20,983
Thank you.

241
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,819
I hope your mother was happy.

242
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:24,695
Thank you.

243
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:28,532
She enjoyed her meal very much.

244
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:03,817
Here, let me show you where we’re going.

245
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:07,237
It’s OK, kid.

246
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,782
I don’t want to know.

247
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:03,103
- What are you doing?
- I’m writing a poem. About you.

248
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,731
About you.

249
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:08,692
Can I hear it?

250
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,611
It’s not ready.

251
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:14,281
I’ll read it to you one day.

252
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:31,316
- Morning Henry.
- Good morning, Mr. Berg.

253
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:34,111
- Room 306
- Thank you.

254
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:35,696
- You all right, Michael?
- I’m fine.

255
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,948
You’d better hurry.
You know what she’s like.

256
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:41,618
- For now!
- Good luck.

257
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,955
Please, Stand!

258
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,460
Please, sit down.

259
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:57,009
The defender, please!

260
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:17,196
- Hello
- Hello.

261
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,282
Good morning, ladies.

262
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:22,534
Gentlemen, please welcome your new fellow-students,

263
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,995
treat them with courtesy.
Sit down!

264
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,706
Hello!

265
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:30,250
My name is Sophie.

266
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,794
I’m Michael.

267
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:34,755
"The Odyssey"

268
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:38,008
Take off your books.

269
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:42,596
Everyone believes that Homer’s
subject is homecoming. In fact,

270
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:45,432
The Odyssey is a book about a journey.

271
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,810
Home is a place you dream of...

272
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,854
Berg, I don’t mean to distract you,

273
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:55,400
but we’re meant to studying Homer,
not studying Sophia.

274
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,075
It’s wonderful, isn’t it?

275
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:07,162
Wonderful.
It’s going to be a great summer.

276
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,051
Why do you leave early?

277
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:22,678
He always leaves early.

278
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,388
Do you have large for a job?

279
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,099
See you tomorrow.

280
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:38,402
I’m sorry I’m late.

281
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,780
I was held up at school.

282
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:44,825
I have a new book.

283
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,995
"The Lady with the Little Dog."

284
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:52,124
By Anton Chekhov.

285
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:55,544
“The talk was that a new face had
appeared on the promenade,

286
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:58,797
a lady with a little dog.”

287
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:12,519
Schmitz!
One moment, please!

288
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:16,356
I read the reports on you

289
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:18,233
Every single word.
Excelent!

290
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,569
To work with me in the office.

291
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,196
We’re going to promote you.

292
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,948
Congratulations.

293
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,336
Let's get out of here...

294
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:40,839
Come on! Michael, We're leaving.
Let's Go!

295
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:45,969
This is a surprise to
your birthday.

296
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,891
What is it?

297
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,392
I'm sorry, really...

298
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,228
We thought you’d like it.

299
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:57,272
We have a beer, will dances.

300
00:39:57,439 --> 00:40:00,651
I promised something.

301
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:06,532
Michael? Please!

302
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:11,912
"Here and elsewhere the glint y
and the world is a reflection of stars."

303
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:14,623
Oh kid, kid. Stop.

304
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,499
What?

305
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,792
Stop.

306
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,503
What’s wrong now?

307
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,922
Nothing’s wrong.

308
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,218
It’s nothing.

309
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:29,012
You know?

310
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:31,098
You never ask,

311
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:34,810
You never bother to
ask how I am.

312
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:37,229
You never say.

313
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:40,816
It just happens to be my birthday.

314
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,111
It’s my birthday, that’s all.

315
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,029
In fact, you’ve never even asked when it is.

316
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,322
Look if you want a fight, kid?...

317
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:48,782
No, I don’t want a fight.

318
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:49,825
What’s wrong with you?

319
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,870
What business is it of yours?

320
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:56,081
It’s always on your terms.
Everything!

321
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:57,749
We do what you want.

322
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:00,127
It’s always what you want.
My friends were giving me a party!

323
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:02,129
Well then why are you here?

324
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:05,966
Go back to your party.
Isn’t that what you want?

325
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:32,826
And it’s always me that has to apologize.

326
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:35,078
You don’t have to apologize.

327
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:38,081
No-one
has to apologize.

328
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:49,343
War and Peace, kid.

329
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:36,783
Now you must go back to your friends.

330
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:54,510
Michael. You all right?

331
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:26,059
It's him

332
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,731
Good.

333
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:35,068
Get the boy something to eat.

334
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:46,788
I think we all knew you’d come back
to us eventually.

335
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:59,278
Mr Berg. It is eight o’clock.
Your daughter.

336
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:05,492
Thank you.

337
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:10,205
Julia.

338
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:13,709
I'll not kept you waiting

339
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:15,669
I was early.

340
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:18,839
Welcome back.

341
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:23,802
So how will you decide?

342
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:25,304
I don’t know.

343
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,472
I’m happy back in Berlin, I suppose.

344
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,975
You’ve seen your mother?

345
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:32,686
I wanted to get away, that's all

346
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:35,397
It was Paris,
but it could have been anywhere.

347
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:38,650
Away from your parents?

348
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,697
I’m aware I was difficult.

349
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:48,243
I wasn’t
always open with you.

350
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:52,706
I’m not open with anyone.

351
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:01,173
I knew you were distant.

352
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:06,220
You know?
I’d always assumed it was my fault.

353
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,932
Julia.

354
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:13,977
How wrong can you be?

355
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:28,200
- See you soon.
- I’ll see you soon.

356
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:33,872
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, Julia.

357
00:48:40,212 --> 00:48:44,633
Those of you for the special seminar group.
Please stay on in this room.

358
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,887
Professor Rohl will be here in a moment.

359
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,294
Well...

360
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,297
we seem to be quite a small group.

361
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:26,717
A small group and a select one.

362
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:31,096
Clearly, this is going to be a
unique seminar.

363
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:34,892
We're going to start reading this, gentlemen.

364
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:38,854
- Karl Jaspers.
- And ladies...

365
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:42,649
"The question of German guilt."

366
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:01,418
So this is where you are.

367
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,632
Yes.
Come in.

368
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:10,802
You take work seriously.

369
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:12,221
Oh I don’t know.

370
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:14,640
You’re rather a serious boy.

371
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:16,934
It’s how I was brought up.

372
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,394
What about you?

373
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:23,440
Are you serious?

374
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:28,278
You’re sure you want to work tonight?

375
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:33,659
But I won’t work every night.

376
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:36,370
See you tomorrow.

377
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,511
We need help.

378
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:17,369
Why all the police?

379
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:20,289
They’re worried about demonstrators.

380
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:22,166
For or against?

381
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:25,419
both.

382
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:31,842
Is a circus.

383
00:51:37,723 --> 00:51:41,643
All photographers are now asked to leave.

384
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,812
The defendants, please..

385
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:46,815
Please sit down!

386
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:52,738
The first thing I’m going to do is hear motions
from each of the defendants’ lawyers.

387
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:55,073
They’re going to be arguing that
there’s no reason

388
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,496
to keep the defendants in jail until the
outcome of the forthcoming trial.

389
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,289
Do you want a pen?

390
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:03,874
I’ve got a pen.

391
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:05,334
Hanna Schmitz.

392
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:09,129
Your name is Hanna Schmitz?

393
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,173
Yes.

394
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,425
Can you speak louder please?

395
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:14,927
My name is Hanna Schmitz.

396
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:16,637
Thank you.

397
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:20,390
You were born on October 21st, 1922?

398
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:22,559
Yes.

399
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:26,146
At Hermannstadt.
And you’re now 43 years old?

400
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:28,857
Yes.

401
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,820
You joined the SS in 1943?

402
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:34,154
Yes.

403
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:37,324
What was your reason for joining?

404
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,911
You were working at the Siemens
factory at the time?

405
00:52:41,078 --> 00:52:41,995
Yes.

406
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:45,499
You’d recently been offered a promotion.

407
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,459
Why did you prefer to join the SS?

408
00:52:47,626 --> 00:52:48,377
Objection

409
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:50,462
I’ll re-phrase my question.

410
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:55,926
I’m trying to ascertain if she joined the SS freely.

411
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,429
Of her own free will.

412
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:01,765
I heard there were jobs

413
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:03,433
Go on...

414
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,939
I was working at Siemens when I
heard the SS was recruitin

415
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:13,152
Did you know the kind of work you’d
be expected to do?

416
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:16,530
They were looking for guards.

417
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:19,032
I applied for a job.

418
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,368
And you worked first at Auschwitz?

419
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,536
Yes.

420
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:28,500
Until 1944. Then you were moved to
a smaller camp near Cracow?

421
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:32,504
- Yes.
- Are you OK?

422
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:33,505
I’m fine.

423
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:39,469
... You then helped move the prisoners west
in the winter of 1944 in the so-called death marches?

424
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,409
- So what did you think?
- I do not know.

425
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:05,621
It wasn’t quite what I expecting.

426
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:06,955
Wasn’t it?

427
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:08,499
In what way?

428
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,834
What were you expecting?

429
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:12,711
I thought it was exciting.

430
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:14,338
Exciting?

431
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:17,216
Why? Why did you think it exciting?

432
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:21,178
Because it’s justice.

433
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:53,710
Societies think they operate by
something called morality

434
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:55,254
But they don’t.

435
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,341
They operate by something called law.

436
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:04,721
You’re not guilty of anything merely
by working at Auschwitz.

437
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:09,685
8,000 people worked at Auschwitz.

438
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:14,231
Precisely 19 have been
convicted, and only 6 for murder.

439
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:19,570
To prove murder you have to prove intent.

440
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:21,864
That’s the law.

441
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:26,243
The question is never ‘Was it wrong?’

442
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,203
but ‘Was it legal?’

443
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:32,416
And not by our laws.
No.

444
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:35,002
by the laws at the time.
with the law of the times.

445
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:36,753
But isn’t that...

446
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,006
What?

447
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:40,347
Narrow?

448
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:43,886
Oh, Yes. The law is narrow.

449
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:47,931
On the other hand, I suspect people

450
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:50,017
who kill other people

451
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:53,979
tend to be aware that it’s wrong.

452
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:59,359
Miss Schmitz, you’re familiar with this book..

453
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,113
Yes.

454
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,742
Parts of it have already been read
out in court.

455
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:09,203
It’s by a survivor,

456
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,038
a prisoner who survived

457
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:13,790
Ilana Mather...

458
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:16,585
She was in the camp, wasn’t she,
when she was a child?

459
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:18,253
She was with her mother.

460
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,172
Yes.

461
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:24,384
In the book, she describes a
selection process.

462
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:28,764
At the end of the month’s labour, every month,
sixty inmates were selected.

463
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:33,018
They were picked out to be sent from the
satellite camp back to Auschwitz.

464
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:36,647
That’s right, isn’t it?

465
00:56:36,814 --> 00:56:39,399
Yes.
It’s right.

466
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:42,820
And so far, each of your fellow defendants

467
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:46,865
has specifically denied
being part of that process.

468
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:49,368
Now I’m going to ask you.

469
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:52,955
Were you part of it?

470
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:55,749
Yes.

471
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:01,922
So you helped make the selection?

472
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:03,841
Yes.

473
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:07,094
You admit that?

474
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,015
Then...

475
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:16,645
tell me, how did that selection happen?

476
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:18,897
There were six guards,

477
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:23,527
So we decided we’d choose ten people each.

478
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:27,865
That’s how we did it - every month.

479
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:30,284
We’d all choose 10.

480
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,412
Are you saying your fellow
defendants took part in the process?

481
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:36,081
We all did.

482
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:38,709
Even though they’ve denied it?

483
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:41,253
You’re saying you
took part in the process.

484
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,215
than the "I", true
Ms Schmitz?

485
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:48,010
Did you not realise...

486
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:51,805
you were sending these women to their deaths?

487
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:52,598
Yes, but...

488
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:56,685
there were new arrivals,
new women were arriving all the time. So...

489
00:57:56,852 --> 00:58:01,064
of course we had to move
some of the old ones on.

490
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:02,983
I’m not sure you understand...

491
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,610
We couldn’t keep everyone.

492
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:07,779
There wasn’t room.

493
00:58:07,988 --> 00:58:10,991
No, but what I’m saying

494
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:13,368
let me rephrase: to make room,

495
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:15,787
you were picking women out and saying

496
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:20,667
‘You you and you have to be sent back to be killed?’

497
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:25,506
Well, what would you have done?

498
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:38,936
Should I never have signed up at Siemens?

499
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:52,825
Ms. Mather, they’re ready for you now.

500
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:57,788
Go! Go! Go! Go!

501
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:13,095
- Where's Michael?
- I do not know.

502
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:17,558
In your book you describe the
process of selection...

503
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,226
Yes.

504
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:21,270
You were made to work and then,

505
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:24,106
when you were no longer any
use to them,

506
00:59:24,273 --> 00:59:26,733
then they sent you
back to Auschwitz to be killed.

507
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,778
Are there people here today who
made that selection?

508
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,655
Yes.

509
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:34,575
I need you to identify them

510
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:37,995
Can you please point them out?

511
00:59:50,174 --> 00:59:52,426
Her

512
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,681
And her.

513
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:01,393
And her.

514
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,647
And her.

515
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:09,026
her.

516
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:13,447
And her.

517
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:16,950
Thank You!
Please continue.

518
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:20,787
Each of the guards would choose a
certain number of women.

519
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,707
Hanna Schmitz chose differently.

520
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:26,460
In what way differently?

521
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:35,552
She had favourites.
Girls, mostly young.

522
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:39,097
We all remarked on it,

523
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:42,100
she gave them food and places to sleep.

524
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:46,438
In the evening,
she asked them to join her.

525
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:48,732
We all thought

526
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:51,478
Well, you can imagine what we thought

527
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:52,779
And then we found out...
