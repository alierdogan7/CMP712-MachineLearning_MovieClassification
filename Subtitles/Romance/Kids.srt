1
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,828
Know what I want to do?

2
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,111
Yeah.

3
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,067
What do I want to do?

4
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:16,685
You want to fuck me.

5
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:19,178
But you can't fuck me.

6
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:20,593
Why not?

7
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:22,962
You know why.

8
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:24,589
'Cause you're a virgin?

9
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,514
'Cause I don't want no baby.

10
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:30,666
You think I want a baby?

11
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,188
With me, you don't have to worry
about that kind of shit.

12
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,918
Why is that?

13
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:38,028
'Cause I like you.

14
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,855
I think you're beautiful...

15
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:43,404
And I think if we fucked,
you'd love it.

16
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,030
You wouldn't believe it.

17
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:49,134
I wouldn't believe it?

18
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:53,672
I don't know, I just think
you would love it, that's all.

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,129
I don't know. I'm scared
that things would change...

20
00:01:58,196 --> 00:01:59,625
between us.

21
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:02,482
What things?
Nothing's going to change.

22
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:07,504
I just want to make
you happy, that's all.

23
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,255
You know
it won't hurt.

24
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:26,538
I'll be gentle,
I promise.

25
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:30,380
Do you care about me?

26
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,581
Of course I do.

27
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:31,080
(grunting and moaning)

28
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:35,975
Boy: Virgins.
I love them.

29
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,129
No diseases,

30
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:40,049
no loose-as-a-goose pussy,
no skank,

31
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:41,455
no nothing.

32
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,213
J ust pure pleasure.

33
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:47,339
Girl: Wait...

34
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:50,221
That hurts.

35
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,718
- What's up, bitch?
- Shit, yo.

36
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,133
- What happened?
- Guess.

37
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,628
You fucked her?

38
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:37,572
I knew you fucked her.
I sat here for like two hours.

39
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:39,469
She was 12,
you hit that shit up.

40
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:43,245
Well, who I am?
I'm the motherfucking virgin surgeon.

41
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:44,718
How was that shit, yo?

42
00:05:44,783 --> 00:05:47,816
Oh, my God, so good.
That girl can fuck.

43
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:49,676
Word, she can fuck, yo?

44
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:52,361
Hells, yeah! Halfway through,
I'm thinking about...

45
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:55,748
"This girl's no virgin.
No virgin can fuck like this".

46
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,448
You sure she's a virgin?

47
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,645
Hell, yeah.
That bitch was bleeding, dude.

48
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,410
When I first put it in,

49
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,479
she all screamed all loud,
and then like...

50
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:09,096
I think I saw her bite down
on her pillow, but I don't know.

51
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,206
- How long did it take?
- Did what take?

52
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,067
How long you fuck her for?

53
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:15,524
Well, you know,
it took me 15 minutes

54
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:17,322
to talk her into it
and everything.

55
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:20,009
It took a little longer
than I expected.

56
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:23,242
But once it was on, we fucked
for a good half an hour.

57
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,027
I had to keep taking it out
and putting it back in.

58
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,640
It hurt the first time.
Didn't want to come too quick.

59
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,271
Did her puss stink?

60
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:32,356
Take a whiff.

61
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,640
(inhaling)

62
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,434
Mmm...
Butterscotch, yo.

63
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:36,746
That's the best.

64
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:40,972
- That bitch was so clean, dude.
- Word?

65
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,373
You could tell she took
care of herself.

66
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:44,550
How?

67
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:46,346
'Cause she, like,
had all these like...

68
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:49,097
powders and creams
in her bathroom.

69
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,595
Let me smell
that shit again.

70
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,564
I'm telling you, man,
that's why I love virgins.

71
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:55,815
They're the best.

72
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:57,315
Purity, man.

73
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,113
- You know what else?
- What?

74
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:02,059
- You can tell she just entered puberty.
- How?

75
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,191
'Cause I was flipping through
this picture book of her family.

76
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:08,644
And there was this picture
of her painting Easter eggs.

77
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:12,034
And I was like, "Damn, you were
pretty cute when you were little".

78
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,325
All right?
So, like, she was all like...

79
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:18,699
"That picture was taken
less than a year ago.

80
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,423
I look younger
without makeup".

81
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:22,823
That's a good one.

82
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,984
So I was like,
"Shit, this girl's a baby".

83
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:28,646
Then I was like,
"Oh, shit...

84
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:32,263
that turns me on.
I want to fuck this baby girl".

85
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,242
Fucking perverted bastard,
I swear.

86
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,691
I'm tellin' you, Cas,

87
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:37,164
I'm getting addicted
to this shit.

88
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,690
To what, virgins?

89
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:41,448
It's all I think about now.

90
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:43,372
Having complex fantasies
and shit.

91
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:46,187
- What do you mean?
- Like going all out.

92
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:48,741
You mean, like fucking
two virgins at once?

93
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,562
That would be kinda sweet,
but I mean like...

94
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:53,799
when I was fucking her,
right...

95
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:57,164
I kept thinking how much
I wanted to put it in her ass.

96
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:59,465
She'd probably smash you
in the grille, kid.

97
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:02,347
I don't know about that.
She was pretty into it.

98
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:04,897
What do you want to do?

99
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:07,208
Get another 40.
Smoke a blunt or some shit.

100
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,448
- You hungry?
- I'm fucking starving, yo.

101
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:11,883
Wait up a sec.
I'm taking a piss.

102
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:13,671
Right up on this piece.

103
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,780
Hey, let's go to Paul's house.

104
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:17,608
Paul, what for?
That guy's a dick.

105
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:19,105
Yeah, but he always got food.

106
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,319
He got them microwave
burrito things, you know?

107
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:23,013
Think he's got any herb
on him?

108
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,931
He quit dealing,
but I'm sure he'll smoke us out.

109
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:28,451
- You think?
- Probably.

110
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,587
He lives on 76th, right?

111
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,245
78th.

112
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:36,866
Let's be ghosts, man.

113
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,454
Hey, Telly,
she suck your dick, man?

114
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:43,459
A little bit,
but I really didn't want her to.

115
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:44,873
Why not, man?

116
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,492
Having a virgin suck your dick,
that's so basic, man.

117
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:49,418
It's simple. It's easy.

118
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,872
But like, if you deflower a girl,
man...

119
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,028
You're the man!

120
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,042
No one can ever
do that again.

121
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:56,938
You're the only one.

122
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,776
- No one has the power to do that again.
- Right.

123
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:03,495
The way I see it,
my outlook on the situation...

124
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:04,563
Mr. Wizard.

125
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,409
It's like getting fame,
you know?

126
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,515
Say you was to die
tomorrow, right?

127
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:10,212
50 years from now,

128
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,672
all the virgins you ever fucked
will remember you.

129
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:14,722
They'll tell their grandkids
about that shit.

130
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:17,064
"That Telly, he sure
was good in the sack".

131
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:19,399
You thirsty?

132
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,638
Hells, yeah.
I'm fucking dehydrated.

133
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:22,707
You got any money?

134
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,705
Three pennies
and a ball of lint, kid.

135
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,208
- You down with the boost?
- True.

136
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,314
Chill a second.

137
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,169
You happen to have diss digg?

138
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:49,380
What?

139
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:51,872
Diss digg.
I'm curious, do you have it?

140
00:09:51,946 --> 00:09:53,353
What is "diss digg"?

141
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,076
Diss digg.

142
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:56,146
What are you saying?

143
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:59,017
- Diss digg here. Do you have it?
- What?

144
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:02,175
Diss digg.
Diss digg.

145
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,097
I don't...
I don't understand you.

146
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:07,551
A'ight, one last time.
Do you have diss digg?

147
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:09,120
What you say, diss digg?

148
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:10,721
He said, "this dick,"
motherfucker.

149
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,899
Don't you understand English?

150
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:24,674
Stupid fuck boys.
Fuck you.

151
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,814
(belches)

152
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:42,952
What's up?

153
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,926
- It's Telly.
- You like peaches?

154
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:48,198
It's Telly, man. Open up.

155
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,983
Yo, yo!

156
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:11,331
What's up?
What's going on?

157
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:13,125
What's up?

158
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,663
Shit.

159
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:28,544
What's all this shit, man?

160
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:31,104
Fuckin' up our crib.

161
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,060
Fuck the crib.

162
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:34,560
Move the fuck over,
you bitch ass.

163
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,967
What's going on?

164
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,040
Nothin'. Chillin'.
What y'all up to?

165
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:40,356
You want a whip-it?

166
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:43,107
Give me one of them shits.

167
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:46,111
This balloon almost busted,
so be careful.

168
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,402
This video is phat.

169
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:54,119
Listen for that crack.

170
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:58,049
Pop that shit.

171
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:02,438
I told you, be careful.

172
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,638
How you doin' there?

173
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:16,549
You're going to be a vegetable
when you're older.

174
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,339
Fuck off.

175
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,895
- My God. Look at his lip.
- Check it out, nigga.

176
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:22,910
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

177
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:26,077
Your lips are blue.

178
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:28,485
Shut up!
You don't even know me, nigga.

179
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:35,197
Look at this kid, yo.
He's like a fiend.

180
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:37,279
That's why I like this shit.

181
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:39,139
They wake my brain up.

182
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:41,629
There's more, man.

183
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:44,769
- How many people live here?
- Too many.

184
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,621
No, only eight or nine.

185
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:50,404
Where does everyone sleep?
You homosexuals?

186
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:54,021
No, get the fuck out of here.

187
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,061
Everywhere.
It's a flophouse, man.

188
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:57,728
We're still short on the rent.

189
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,614
If we had a faggot,
he'd pay the rent.

190
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,402
You and Casper can move in.

191
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,259
You could share the bathtub.

192
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:06,116
- I don't know about that.
- Yo, Telly...

193
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:07,644
Jenny says, "What's up?"

194
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:08,995
Jenny who?

195
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:10,492
You know, Jenny.

196
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,454
Casper: That pretty girl you boned
last summer.

197
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:15,834
I haven't seen her in forever.
What's she up to?

198
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:19,709
I knew he wouldn't
speak to me. That dick.

199
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,124
You still mad at him?

200
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,914
Of course.
How can I forgive him?

201
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:25,437
- What did he do?
- He stole her virginity.

202
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,826
He took it away
and now it's gone forever.

203
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:31,106
It's not the fact
that he devirginized me,

204
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,857
it's that he never
spoke to me again.

205
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:36,676
He talked all this bullshit
and then just broke out.

206
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:40,965
But he was all like, "Jenny,
I like you so much," and...

207
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,583
"I promise,
I won't use you".

208
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:44,734
Same lines.

209
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:46,267
He was talking mad shit.

210
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,098
The first time
is always whacked.

211
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,744
Be glad you didn't lose your
virginity in the back seat of a car.

212
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:54,683
- That's right.
- That's nothing.

213
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:58,205
I had just turned 14.
With this asshole who was 18.

214
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,001
I can't remember his name.

215
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,844
This was at sleep away camp
with your friends and shit.

216
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,462
We were getting it on
in the bushes, around midnight.

217
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:09,380
I got fucking mosquito bites
all over my ass.

218
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:12,741
I thought nobody knew about it,
but everyone knew the next day.

219
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:14,594
- And the pain was...
- Hell, yeah!

220
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:18,468
- The fucking pain! Jesus!
- That's the shit.

221
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,705
God, the pain!
The fucking pain! Jesus!

222
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:22,627
You feel like
you're being ripped open.

223
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,442
You are being
ripped open inside.

224
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:27,484
- Did you bleed?
- No, I didn't.

225
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:31,070
- You didn't bleed?
- I bled all over.

226
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:32,995
On the condom, everywhere.

227
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:36,573
You know what he started singing?
"Sunday, Bloody Sunday".

228
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,554
- "Sunday, Bloody Sunday".
- That stupid fucking song.

229
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,352
I was like, "What the hell?"

230
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,276
I couldn't believe
he did that to me.

231
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,472
Then everyone at camp was singing
that the whole time.

232
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,250
You know what?
I have sex and I like fucking.

233
00:14:49,317 --> 00:14:50,975
Hell, yeah.

234
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,637
I love sex, girl.

235
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,741
It's the best.
There's nothing better.

236
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,951
It's the best thing, right?
That's it.

237
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:00,251
No, no, not sex.

238
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:03,042
Foreplay.
Foreplay.

239
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,326
Hardcore pound fucking.

240
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,055
That's the shit right there, man.

241
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,164
That's the only way to do it.

242
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:13,440
It's that boom, boom, boom.

243
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:17,757
But there's a difference
between making love...

244
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,770
having sex and then fucking.

245
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:21,021
Right.

246
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,369
Making love is like...

247
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:24,476
It's, like, sweet.

248
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,238
It's real slow.
Real slow.

249
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:27,387
Sex is like,

250
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,460
"All right,
let's have sex.

251
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,637
Let's go, come on".

252
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:35,521
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

253
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:36,668
That's the whole thing.

254
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,358
They want you to be
so kind, so gentle,

255
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:41,981
like you give a fuck
or something.

256
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,482
- What's up, Jav?
- What's up?

257
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:50,425
What are you doing
with a cigarette?

258
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,961
Like you care?

259
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,035
Yeah, right.

260
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:58,396
Most of the time, you just want
to be all pounding that shit.

261
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,704
I like that part.

262
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:03,259
My God!
That motherfucker's the bomb.

263
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,957
If you could just be like,

264
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,002
"Excuse me, miss,
can I borrow your hole?

265
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:08,450
(laughing)

266
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:11,264
It'll only take a little bit.
I'll give it right back".

267
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:13,403
- Right.
- "I'm done".

268
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,383
But that's it.
You got to take it slow.

269
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:20,345
You got to be smooth.
Girls like it slow and romantic.

270
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:22,687
Fuck romance.
I like it hard and nasty.

271
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,210
I've been with a lot of girls,
so I know.

272
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:27,039
Me too, nigga.
What's up?

273
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:32,347
But it depends.
I was at Eric's house.

274
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:33,695
Smash J was there.

275
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:35,672
D.J. Flipper was there.

276
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,918
All right?
He was horny.

277
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:41,183
He threw me on the bed.
We started getting it on.

278
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,000
They were in the room
getting dressed.

279
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:47,197
They were going to a disco.
That shit was so good.

280
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,437
He was fucking fingering me,
sucking on my tits.

281
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,743
I was like, "You go, boy".

282
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,403
We ripped each other's hair out.

283
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:56,321
We kissed so hard,
our lips were busted.

284
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:58,775
I was like,
"Work it, boy".

285
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,698
But y'all know why
I go out with Alex, right?

286
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:05,723
He has the best fucking fingers
I ever had.

287
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,965
I'm going out with him.

288
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:10,367
He got it going on.
That's that.

289
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:12,769
That's why foreplay
is better than sex.

290
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,005
They can touch you
and you're going crazy

291
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:18,205
and all of a sudden, it's like,
"What the hell happened?"

292
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:20,662
- J ust a big disappointment.
- It's a letdown.

293
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:23,291
Then it takes them either
too long,

294
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:24,736
or too short to come.

295
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:27,420
Have you ever had someone
who took forever?

296
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,864
What, to come?

297
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,384
Let me tell you.
I was having sex with Jake,

298
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:34,108
and it took my man
an hour and a half.

299
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,033
I don't have
no hour and a half.

300
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,138
No, no, no.

301
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:40,992
You know what I notice,
though?

302
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:43,195
Bitches love to suck dick.

303
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:46,527
It's like some secret
hobby for them or some shit.

304
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:48,284
Some freaks.

305
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:50,622
All bitches, man.
I know, man, I'm telling you.

306
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:52,151
Casper's right.

307
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:54,778
They act like they don't
in front of their friends,

308
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:56,190
to try to get respect.

309
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:59,519
When you get them alone,
it's the first thing they go for.

310
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:03,033
The girls just grab your dick,
start sucking.

311
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:05,374
They know they're
in charge of something.

312
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:06,967
Only time they feel prosperous.

313
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:10,042
- I'm telling you.
- They love that shit.

314
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:11,705
That's why girls
live longer than guys.

315
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:14,143
Sperm's got vitamin C
in that shit.

316
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,958
The shit's nutritious, right?

317
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:22,016
Looking at your watch.

318
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:25,279
You know what's the worst?

319
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:28,061
Sucking dick.
I hate sucking dick.

320
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:31,260
They'll be shooting you in the eye,
and the ear and shit.

321
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,717
And you don't know
what to do.

322
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:35,868
It hits that little thing...

323
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:38,751
the tonsils, the esophagus,
whatever the hell it is.

324
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:42,842
- You don't get anything out of it.
- You'll be gagging.

325
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:45,148
How much more can you bob?

326
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:46,842
You don't get shit.

327
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:48,919
Have you ever swallowed
it before?

328
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:50,486
No.

329
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,469
Me neither.

330
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:54,202
- I have.
- Of course.

331
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,395
No, but it was like...

332
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:01,759
No, it's like sweet and sour
and salty butter.

333
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,148
It's like...
it's just nasty.

334
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:07,256
You drink and drink
and you cannot get...

335
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:09,499
the taste out of your mouth.

336
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:12,285
The sperm get stuck in your teeth.
They're disgusting.

337
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,352
You gotta sit down and eat
a whole real meal.

338
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:17,333
All I know is that
condoms suck.

339
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,651
They don't work.

340
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,786
They either slip off, or break,
or make your dick shrink.

341
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,164
(laughter)

342
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:25,849
You got a small condom, huh?

343
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,577
We still got to use them.

344
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:29,174
I did once.

345
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:31,669
Telly's the only guy
I've had sex with.

346
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:35,191
- I thought you had sex with A.J.
- No, we just messed around.

347
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,501
That's the whole thing,
you know?

348
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,672
You hear of all these diseases.

349
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,198
Disease this,
disease that...

350
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:49,500
fucking everyone's dying and shit.
That shit is made up.

351
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,422
I don't know no kid with AIDS.

352
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,974
Ain't no one I know died
from that shit.

353
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:56,567
Fucking, that's just
some make-believe story.

354
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:59,126
(laughter and clapping)

355
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,409
It's bullshit!

356
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:05,493
We all going to die anyway.
I'm going to go out fucking.

357
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,290
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

358
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,205
(hooting)

359
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,219
One guy got tested.
He was negative.

360
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:20,821
This other guy...

361
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:23,960
he'd fucked only two other girls,
and they were virgins,

362
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,852
so he was safe.

363
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,715
But then this other guy I just fucked,
which was a mistake.

364
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,212
Heat of the moment
kind of thing.

365
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:35,100
But I went to the clinic last week
with Jenny...

366
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:37,140
to get ourselves checked,
to be safe.

367
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:38,588
Jenny went?

368
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:41,687
She got tested with me
so that I didn't have to be alone.

369
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:43,416
Word, they ask
a lot of questions?

370
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:45,144
Jenny...

371
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:46,458
how old are you?

372
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:47,606
16.

373
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,012
How many people have you
had vaginal intercourse with?

374
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:53,143
- One.
- Were you protected?

375
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:54,213
No.

376
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,230
- How old are you, honey?
- 17.

377
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,886
How many people have
you had vaginal intercourse with?

378
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,544
- Altogether?
- Yes, altogether.

379
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:06,613
I'd say eight.
Maybe nine.

380
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:09,620
How many times
did you go in unprotected?

381
00:21:09,693 --> 00:21:11,351
Four times
I went unprotected.

382
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:12,883
Maybe it was three.

383
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:15,741
Have you ever had anal
intercourse?

384
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:16,852
No.

385
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,948
Have you ever had anal
intercourse?

386
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:23,223
Yeah.

387
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:25,268
With how many
different people?

388
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:33,148
I think three,
but I'm not sure.

389
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:35,188
Were they wearing condoms?

390
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,075
Yes, with two of them.
Twice I didn't.

391
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:39,286
I didn't...

392
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:40,567
two times.

393
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:44,275
We're going to draw
some blood from you.

394
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:46,171
Come back in seven days...

395
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:49,684
and we should have the results
of your tests, okay?

396
00:21:49,756 --> 00:21:51,512
Thanks.

397
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:55,131
- You see that pork fried rice store?
- The Chinese joint?

398
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,237
Yeah.
My cousin lives right up there.

399
00:21:57,309 --> 00:21:59,927
He's mad. Crazy.
His name is Harmonoff.

400
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,283
One time we went to
Special Olympics on a school trip.

401
00:22:04,348 --> 00:22:06,715
Seventh grade, whatever.

402
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,333
He tried to pick up
these retarded bitches.

403
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:12,338
That nigga's crazy.
He's still got a thing for them.

404
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:14,583
He caught one
dope bitch that day...

405
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:16,626
she had those leg braces
and shit.

406
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,423
But she had a fat ass.

407
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:20,084
You're crazy. Ruthless.

408
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:24,150
He brought her into the bathroom
and fucked the shit out of her.

409
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,515
He was telling me that the leg
braces were scratching up his shit.

410
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,395
He hit her hard, yo.
She was all drooling and shit.

411
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:46,170
So, he's pretty crazy;
he'll do whatever to bust a nut.

412
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:47,762
- You know?
- That's ruthless shit.

413
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:51,959
He wanted to take the leg braces off,
but he was just like "Fuck it".

414
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:53,937
"Let's hit this up real quick".

415
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:56,890
Telly: Like quickie style.

416
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:02,809
# The summer's gone #

417
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,690
# And all the roses dying... #

418
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,488
Man, this guy's really good, yo.

419
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:11,418
He reminds me of my uncle.

420
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:14,167
- I bet he brings mad dough in, yo.
- Hells, yeah.

421
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:20,753
#... when summer's
in the meadow #

422
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:27,472
# Or when the valley's hushed
and white with snow #

423
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,929
# It's I'll be here #

424
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:34,614
# I n sunshine or shadow... #

425
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,183
I don't think I want
to be seein' him anymore.

426
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,552
I want to date other people.
I don't know.

427
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,781
I think he's mad at me
or something. But who cares?

428
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:55,706
It's like,
"Get off your high horse.

429
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,869
If I want to see other guys
I'll see other guys".

430
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,498
So it's just like...

431
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,675
I can't deal with
that jealous crap.

432
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:05,299
I don't know why I see him
in the first place.

433
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,665
He's a jerk!
Giving me a hard time. That crap.

434
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,869
I think I'm just gonna
dump him completely.

435
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:14,386
I was just tryin' to be nice,
but if he's gonna get...

436
00:24:14,457 --> 00:24:15,864
(coughing)

437
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,588
It must have been
something I ate.

438
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:19,381
Ruby, follow me.

439
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:21,653
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

440
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:32,432
Jenny...

441
00:24:52,153 --> 00:24:53,844
You tested negative

442
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:57,208
for all sexually transmitted
diseases and infections.

443
00:24:57,273 --> 00:24:58,931
Yes!

444
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,408
You're clean.

445
00:25:00,473 --> 00:25:02,361
I can't tell you
how nervous I was.

446
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:03,799
I didn't sleep last night.

447
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:06,166
Now you have to be careful,
Ruby, okay?

448
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:10,194
I want you to take these
pamphlets and read them.

449
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:12,021
And, Ruby, read them.

450
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:19,928
Jenny, you've tested
positive for the H IV virus.

451
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:20,992
What?

452
00:25:21,016 --> 00:25:22,926
The test isn't 100% accurate.

453
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,789
I tested positive?

454
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,645
I'm sorry.

455
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:28,534
I only had sex with Telly.

456
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,215
I just came to keep
Ruby company.

457
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:53,519
Yo, I want to fuck Darcy.

458
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:54,671
Who?

459
00:25:54,743 --> 00:25:56,150
You know Darcy.
Bennie's little sister.

460
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:57,525
You like her, uh-huh?

461
00:25:57,592 --> 00:25:59,380
Yo, I liked her
for a while, yeah.

462
00:25:59,447 --> 00:26:00,447
Darcy, yo?

463
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:03,319
She's so little,
innocent and pretty.

464
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:04,944
She's only 13, man.

465
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:06,510
Shit.

466
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,202
You remember the last week
at the block party?

467
00:26:09,272 --> 00:26:11,759
She was handing out
watermelon slices.

468
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:15,606
I just sat across from her
and started watching her.

469
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:17,646
- She was eating this watermelon.
- U h-huh.

470
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,298
J uices just start runnin'
off her chin onto her shirt.

471
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:22,447
After about three seconds, yo,

472
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,389
I got the biggest
fuckin' hard on, yo.

473
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:29,107
I just wanted to take out my dick
right there and start jerking off.

474
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:30,768
Shit, yo.

475
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,392
Like at that point,
and moment, like...

476
00:26:33,463 --> 00:26:35,830
she was like a vision
of perfection.

477
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,488
I know what you mean, yo.

478
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,171
Like, like she represented
everything holy about a virgin.

479
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,988
I know what you're saying.
I know.

480
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:45,647
She works for Nasa, man.

481
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,574
I think she promotes for them.

482
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:50,256
I'm going to fuck her
tonight, I swear to God.

483
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:53,261
How you going to fuck
two virgins in one day?

484
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:56,084
That shit's got to be
against the law or some shit.

485
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:59,533
I'm still going to fuck her.
I'll bet you money I'll fuck her.

486
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:01,330
Bet, yo.

487
00:27:10,358 --> 00:27:12,497
# I have no legs #

488
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:14,705
# I have no legs #

489
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:16,367
# I have no legs #

490
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:19,602
Run by the park and get zooted?
See what the fellas are doing?

491
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,605
Yeah, yeah.
But I also got to run home.

492
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:24,467
Yeah, yeah,
that's cool. That's cool.

493
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:28,307
# I have no legs #

494
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,748
# I have no legs #

495
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:34,196
# I have no legs #

496
00:27:34,262 --> 00:27:35,985
God bless you.

497
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:38,801
# I have no legs #

498
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,780
# I have no legs #

499
00:27:53,077 --> 00:27:54,124
God bless you.

500
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:55,855
Bless you back, man.

501
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:58,162
# I have no legs #

502
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:00,084
# I have no legs #

503
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:01,523
# I have no legs #

504
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:19,697
Peter, is Mom there?

505
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,186
No, I need to speak to Mom.

506
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:23,668
(sighs)

507
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,391
Peter, where's Mommy?

508
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:28,244
No, I can't talk to you
right now.

509
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:32,881
Yeah, I hear it.

510
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:38,802
J ust tell her that...

511
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,965
Never mind.
J ust go watch television.

512
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:44,592
(sobbing)

513
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:49,044
Come on.
It's gonna be okay.

514
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,497
It's gonna be okay.

515
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:56,653
I'm gonna have to tell
my little brother I'm gonna die.

516
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:59,659
I can't make him
his lunches any more.

517
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:03,693
Come on. I mean, don't cry.
We'll work it out.

518
00:29:03,764 --> 00:29:05,552
I only did it once.

519
00:29:17,908 --> 00:29:19,663
I gotta go.
I gotta find Telly.

520
00:29:19,732 --> 00:29:21,390
Don't go anywhere,
just stay with me.

521
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,656
- No, I gotta find him.
- Then I'm coming.

522
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,665
- No, I just gotta go.
- Jen...

523
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,681
Jenny!

524
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,306
- What's up, yo?
- Yo, chillin'.

525
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,906
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Telly, where you been?

526
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:18,888
- What's up?
- Hi, Casper.

527
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:22,513
We were just out
trying to find jobs.

528
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:25,262
- Any luck?
- No, no.

529
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:29,997
What are you gonna do
about money this summer?

530
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,024
I don't know. Find a job.

531
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,505
Can I borrow some money?

532
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,537
Your dad made me promise
not to give you any money

533
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,171
until you find a job.

534
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:42,795
- Then I won't need your money.
- That's right.

535
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:45,168
Come on, Mom.

536
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:47,144
N - O.

537
00:30:51,314 --> 00:30:52,721
Come on, Casper.

538
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:57,073
Damn, Telly.
Your little brother's getting big.

539
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:59,025
Yeah, man, I know.

540
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,225
Yo, Telly, your mom's
titties are looking good.

541
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:06,378
Shut the fuck up, man.

542
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,660
Damn.

543
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:17,962
Cardizems.

544
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:31,692
Hey, how do these things work?

545
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:34,183
How am I supposed to know?

546
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:37,546
How much you gonna take?

547
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:39,275
I don't know.
How much you want?

548
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:42,127
$10. $15's good, though.

549
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:53,833
You ever take one of these
things out with your teeth?

550
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:55,214
Stoops.

551
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:58,993
Your girls don't bleed yet,
that's why.

552
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:01,545
My girls got mad flavor.

553
00:32:02,576 --> 00:32:03,951
Heavy flow.

554
00:32:16,753 --> 00:32:18,760
$15 for me.
$10 for you.

555
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:21,134
You cheap motherfucker, yo.

556
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,761
But I'm supporting your ass.

557
00:32:22,832 --> 00:32:24,937
Thanks a lot.

558
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:26,382
Thievin' bastard.

559
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:30,053
The fuck outta here, cat.

560
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,447
It's damn hot out!

561
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,495
It's a fucking sauna
in here, man.

562
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:39,144
Yo, is crazy hot out.

563
00:32:39,216 --> 00:32:40,972
Word, yo.

564
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,982
Shit.

565
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:48,682
Come on, nigga.

566
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:50,726
You think Darcy
will be at Nasa tonight?

567
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,207
Yeah, probably.

568
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,127
You got any weed
around here?

569
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:56,810
No. We should run by the park
and pick up some.

570
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:58,472
Maybe Darcy'll be there.

571
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,071
True. True.

572
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,478
Yo, I gotta start wearin'
more hats.

573
00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:06,951
This is my tape, man.

574
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:08,551
Hey, my hair looks busted, B.

575
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,892
- I'm gonna get buff, B.
- You are?

576
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,870
Hells, yeah.

577
00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:14,920
The other day, this Chinese bitch
said I'd look good with muscles.

578
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,530
I'll get mad diesel. Fuck up
any nigga that step to me.

579
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,654
You got hairy armpits.
Word up.

580
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:25,702
You got Buckwheat
in a headlock there.

581
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:26,920
You want some?

582
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,846
Get the fuck out of here
with that.

583
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:30,765
- You fucking stink, dude.
- So?

584
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:31,845
You stink.

585
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,010
That shit gives me a rash
all over my armpits and my stomach.

586
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,021
I like my smell.
It's fuckin' natural.

587
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:39,502
You still stink.

588
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:41,094
Your mother stinks.

589
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,846
These chips are stale.

590
00:33:46,254 --> 00:33:48,010
Look at this busted-ass nigga.

591
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:51,470
That's me, nigga.

592
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:52,996
Me and your bitch.

593
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,150
Stoops.

594
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:58,188
TV: He wants to spend
time together.

595
00:33:58,255 --> 00:33:59,716
I hardly know my old man.

596
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,623
Shh...

597
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:05,516
I'm going out
for a little while.

598
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,655
- When are you gonna be back?
- Not too late.

599
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:09,319
4:30 in the morning?

600
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,081
Not too late.

601
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:15,749
You sure I can't get
any money?

602
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:19,270
If I had some, maybe.
Right now, I don't have a penny.

603
00:34:24,046 --> 00:34:25,988
All right, then. Bye.

604
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:35,085
(door slams)

605
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,288
Shit.

606
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:06,469
What's up, Ras?

607
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,428
Casper.

608
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:13,546
Back off of my customer
there, man.

609
00:35:15,885 --> 00:35:17,445
Ras, you got some?

610
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:18,564
Yeah, mon.

611
00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:21,604
Let me check out a dime
of that.

612
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:22,985
Come here.

613
00:35:23,629 --> 00:35:26,018
I want no twigs
or pebbles neither.

614
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:27,915
I wouldn't do you.

615
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,772
Check this.
Good sinsemilla.

616
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:38,982
Smells delicious.

617
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,060
- I the best.
- Definitely.

618
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:43,718
How about a dime of that shit?

619
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:45,447
Drop it.

620
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:53,125
Good looking out.

621
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:54,571
Come check me out again.

622
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:56,970
- See you tomorrow.
- Later, man.

623
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:14,411
Yo, Paul, is Telly there?

624
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:16,200
Is Telly there?

625
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:17,729
This is Paul.
Who's this?

626
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:19,810
It's Jenny.
J ust tell me if Telly's there.

627
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:20,997
Hello, Jenny.

628
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:23,239
Wanna come upstairs
and make out with me?

629
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:25,729
Listen, I'm fucking serious.
Where's Telly?

630
00:36:25,803 --> 00:36:27,691
Telly's not here.

631
00:36:27,756 --> 00:36:29,960
I think he went downtown
with Casper.

632
00:36:32,812 --> 00:36:35,845
My dolly's black Lucy.

633
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:56,520
Telly: Tracy's talking
to another guy over there.

634
00:36:56,587 --> 00:36:58,081
Casper: Tracy?

635
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:00,457
Whatever.
She can suck my dick.

636
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:07,713
What's up, nigga?

637
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:11,875
What's up, dude?

638
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,131
What's up, guy?

639
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:27,397
Shut the fuck up,
you four-eyed bitch!

640
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:51,009
(rapping)

641
00:38:00,266 --> 00:38:01,924
I tell you what.
That body.

642
00:38:01,994 --> 00:38:03,685
Yeah, I'm in that piece,
kid.

643
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,576
- What's up, Harold?
- What's up?

644
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,791
- Where you at?
- I'm right here, you know?

645
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,832
- You going out tonight?
- Yeah, maybe Nasa or some shit.

646
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:26,498
Yo, word?
You're on the list?

647
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:29,187
Probably.
But fuck that shit. I'll sneak in.

648
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:31,167
I need some female
vagina tonight.

649
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:33,794
I had some female vagina
last night.

650
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:35,714
You did? All right!

651
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:38,854
You want to do any pot?
You got a Phillie?

652
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:41,987
- Got one.
- Make a trade.

653
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,917
You got this in the park?

654
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:49,284
Break that shit up.

655
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,287
Break it.

656
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:57,889
Scrape it.

657
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:00,898
Lick it.

658
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:04,546
Dump it.

659
00:39:24,201 --> 00:39:25,826
You got it.

660
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:29,351
Smoke it.

661
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:41,855
(speaking Spanish)

662
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:54,626
What's up?

663
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:01,415
Can I fuck with that?

664
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,040
Sure.

665
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:10,788
Yeah, boy.

666
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:12,960
(coughing)

667
00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:19,076
- Mad hot, right?
- Mad hot.

668
00:40:19,143 --> 00:40:20,605
I want to go swimmin', kid.

669
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,534
Word.

670
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,908
Look at that shit, man.

671
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:26,209
Gay guys.

672
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:27,294
That shit is sick.

673
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:28,774
Faggots!

674
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:30,148
Fucking faggots!

675
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:31,622
Butt pirate!

676
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:32,897
Bitch ass faggot!

677
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:36,390
Fuck out of here,
motherfucker!

678
00:40:36,455 --> 00:40:38,113
J ungle fever.

679
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:44,099
Fucking faggot!
Bitch ass faggot!

680
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,234
How can you hang out
with Casper?

681
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:53,158
That nigga's a jerk.

682
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:55,711
- You think?
- Yeah, yo. I've always hated him.

683
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:58,149
He used to eat glue
in the seventh grade.

684
00:40:58,215 --> 00:40:59,643
- Still does.
- I hate him.

685
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:04,604
Give me a taste of that
motherfuckin' chronic, kid.

686
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:09,313
This weed is mad good, yo.

687
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:11,743
This your board?

688
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,490
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

689
00:41:27,558 --> 00:41:29,729
Well, watch where
the fuck you're skating at.

690
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:31,587
- Watch where you walk, yo.
- What?

691
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:33,410
- What I said, yo.
- What?

692
00:41:33,478 --> 00:41:34,623
Forget it, B. Nothin'.

693
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:36,932
- What?
- Whatever, yo. Just forget it.

694
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,786
Do you want to get fucked up,
motherfucker?

695
00:41:38,854 --> 00:41:41,276
- What's up, then?
- What do you mean?

696
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:43,738
- What's up?
- What's up, motherfucker?

697
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:55,908
Casper: Suck my dick.
Fuckin' suck my dick.

698
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:06,148
- Beat his ass, fuckers.
- Motherfucker!

699
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:07,555
Punk ass motherfucker.

700
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:35,834
He's out, man!

701
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:38,047
Word up, that shit is out!

702
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:47,771
Now get in my way, bitch!

703
00:42:47,844 --> 00:42:48,989
Motherfucker.

704
00:42:54,628 --> 00:42:56,352
Man: Excuse me.

705
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,624
Can I ask you a question?

706
00:43:00,228 --> 00:43:02,367
Can I ask you a question?

707
00:43:02,436 --> 00:43:04,574
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be a pest.

708
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:08,411
It's just that I was looking
at you and you look upset.

709
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,969
I like looking at you, but...

710
00:43:12,036 --> 00:43:14,686
but your face looks upset.

711
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:16,032
So I was wondering...

712
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,653
if I could be
of any assistance.

713
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:21,344
Maybe cheer you up
or something?

714
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:23,321
No, I'm okay, thanks.

715
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:25,305
Okay?

716
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:27,998
Because you don't look okay.

717
00:43:28,068 --> 00:43:30,173
You're a very pretty
young lady.

718
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:31,650
It's just...

719
00:43:31,716 --> 00:43:33,690
that your face looks troubled.

720
00:43:33,763 --> 00:43:35,673
It's just been a bad day.

721
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,536
Miss...

722
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:42,906
Would I be prying
if I asked you what was wrong?

723
00:43:42,979 --> 00:43:44,802
Would I be prying?

724
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:46,722
Everything's wrong.

725
00:43:46,787 --> 00:43:49,601
No, not everything.

726
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:52,481
The sun is still shining.

727
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,783
It's a beautiful day.

728
00:43:55,779 --> 00:43:57,567
Some things are okay, right?

729
00:43:57,667 --> 00:43:59,161
I guess so.

730
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,562
Did you break up with your boyfriend?
- No.

731
00:44:01,635 --> 00:44:04,251
You in trouble with the law?
- No.

732
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:06,177
Am I getting closer?

733
00:44:06,242 --> 00:44:07,242
That's better.

734
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:09,372
You look like a prom queen
when you smile.

735
00:44:09,443 --> 00:44:11,036
A glamour girl.

736
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,415
When I was a kid...

737
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:19,197
I had a crush
on the prom queen.

738
00:44:19,267 --> 00:44:20,990
Darlene Lewis.

739
00:44:22,114 --> 00:44:24,569
She had a big black mole...

740
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:27,009
in the middle of her face...

741
00:44:27,074 --> 00:44:29,944
that used to make me
so excited.

742
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:31,873
You look a little bit
like her.

743
00:44:31,938 --> 00:44:34,816
Right around the cheeks and the chin.
- Thanks.

744
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:38,199
Boy, did I have a crush
on her.

745
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:41,656
She was the first girl
I put my tongue in her mouth.

746
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:46,842
Hey, look. Whatever it is,
just forget about it.

747
00:44:46,914 --> 00:44:50,143
Life is too short.
Try to be happy.

748
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:52,665
But what if you
can't make yourself happy?

749
00:44:52,738 --> 00:44:54,014
Well...

750
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:57,246
...then I don't know.

751
00:44:57,314 --> 00:44:59,802
You know what you do then?
You forget.

752
00:44:59,874 --> 00:45:01,335
Block it out.

753
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:04,225
I remember...

754
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:08,894
when my grandmother told me
how to be happy.

755
00:45:08,962 --> 00:45:09,976
She said, "Leon...

756
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,122
Leon,
my darling little grandson,

757
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:13,754
if you want to be happy...

758
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:15,287
don't think.

759
00:45:15,873 --> 00:45:18,721
Don't bump into any walls.

760
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:20,574
If you stutter...

761
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:22,430
don't talk".

762
00:45:22,497 --> 00:45:24,537
I listened to my grandmother.

763
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:26,464
Look at me now.

764
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:28,896
Couldn't be happier.

765
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:31,449
That's life.

766
00:45:32,257 --> 00:45:33,883
Darcy!

767
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:36,376
Darcy!

768
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:39,706
Darcy!

769
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:42,648
Darcy!

770
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:45,121
Darcy!

771
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:47,575
Bennie, what's up?

772
00:45:47,648 --> 00:45:49,241
Nothing. What's up?

773
00:45:49,312 --> 00:45:51,581
Yo, is your sister home?

774
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,820
- You want Darcy?
- Yeah.

775
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,092
Hold on.
Let me see if she's here.

776
00:45:57,313 --> 00:45:59,963
Yo, hurry the fuck up, man.
I want to go swimming.

777
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:02,072
Hold up, man. Damn.

778
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:05,177
Hey.

779
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:08,412
Hey, what's up?
What are you doin' right now?

780
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,815
I was just getting ready
to take a bath.

781
00:46:10,881 --> 00:46:13,019
Don't take a bath.
Come swim with us.

782
00:46:13,088 --> 00:46:14,998
Hi, Darcy!

783
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:17,626
Hi, Kim.
Hi, Joy.

784
00:46:17,697 --> 00:46:19,900
Come on.
Come swimmin'.

785
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:21,016
Right now?

786
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:22,496
Yeah. Come on.

787
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,967
Hold on.

788
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,829
So that's your new girl, huh?

789
00:46:27,904 --> 00:46:29,115
I hope so. For now.

790
00:46:29,184 --> 00:46:30,591
You like 'em kinda young,
right?

791
00:46:30,656 --> 00:46:31,866
Fuckin' babies.

792
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:34,358
I like 'em new.
Not like you.

793
00:46:34,432 --> 00:46:35,708
Fuck you.

794
00:46:35,776 --> 00:46:38,264
Damn, bitch,
don't kill the shit.

795
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:40,310
What the fuck?

796
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,806
You think we might've killed
that guy?

797
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,959
No, man.

798
00:46:44,031 --> 00:46:46,104
- You sure?
- Casper: I don't know, though.

799
00:46:46,176 --> 00:46:49,721
I kicked him so many times,
my fuckin' toes are broken.

800
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:54,398
No, man. We didn't kill him,
'cause when we were through,

801
00:46:54,464 --> 00:46:56,187
he was all twitching.

802
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,255
Word, he was crawling
around the floor and shit.

803
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:01,150
You guys are fuckin' sick,
you know that?

804
00:47:01,215 --> 00:47:03,997
That's all right.
That's how I'm living.

805
00:47:05,952 --> 00:47:07,545
It's unreal out here,
right, Harold?

806
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:27,995
Ready.

807
00:47:28,063 --> 00:47:29,852
You look nice.

808
00:48:15,038 --> 00:48:16,663
Hey, girl, what's up?

809
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:19,036
Nothin'.
J ust some crazy shit.

810
00:48:19,102 --> 00:48:20,379
Have you seen Telly around?

811
00:48:20,446 --> 00:48:22,039
Yeah.
Speaking of stupid shit...

812
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,215
him and his ape-ass
of a friend, Casper,

813
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:25,747
they almost just
killed some kid.

814
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:28,244
- What happened?
- Some messy little scrap.

815
00:48:28,317 --> 00:48:31,067
- You know that bullshit.
- Yeah. You know where he went?

816
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:34,036
I don't know. He said some shit
about meeting Darcy.

817
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,663
- I think he likes her now.
- Bennie's little sister?

818
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:38,490
She should be
at Nasa tonight.

819
00:48:38,558 --> 00:48:40,979
Why are you looking for him?
You like him now?

820
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:44,853
Come on, man.
H urry up.

821
00:48:44,926 --> 00:48:47,097
Get in this piece.

822
00:48:47,198 --> 00:48:48,954
H urry up, Kim.

823
00:48:51,165 --> 00:48:53,816
Harold: You think I ain't
motherfuckin' hot naked?

824
00:48:53,885 --> 00:48:55,860
Shit.

825
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,381
I'm jumpin' in before everybody.
I don't give a fuck.

826
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:02,388
Girl: Take your fucking clothes off
and shut the fuck up, Harold.

827
00:49:12,061 --> 00:49:15,989
Motherfucker,
you know what I'm saying?

828
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,962
Damn, Kim. Your body
looks fucking dope.

829
00:49:20,637 --> 00:49:22,393
You think so?

830
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:23,890
Hells, yeah.
I'm serious, yo.

831
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:26,867
It's funny, you don't know
how dope a girl's body is

832
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,828
until she takes
all her clothes off.

833
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,446
It looks good, right?

834
00:49:31,517 --> 00:49:33,688
Think it don't
when it does?

835
00:49:33,756 --> 00:49:35,861
Aw, you don't look
so bad yourself, Casper.

836
00:49:37,692 --> 00:49:40,725
That shit is rare.
What about me?

837
00:49:40,796 --> 00:49:43,796
That's what I like about you.
A girl's ass.

838
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,867
Joy, ever seen
a black man's lasso?

839
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,890
(laughter)

840
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,321
Oh, my God!

841
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:57,304
Harold: Look at it.

842
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:01,810
Girl: Harold's dick is black
and beautiful. Look at him.

843
00:50:02,684 --> 00:50:04,572
All right. Chill.
Be quiet, be quiet.

844
00:50:06,492 --> 00:50:08,248
(flapping sounds resume)

845
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:12,981
Look at that fuckin' shit.

846
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,921
That's how I'm gonna be
up against your ass, like this.

847
00:50:15,995 --> 00:50:17,337
(flapping sounds and laughter)

848
00:50:21,564 --> 00:50:24,859
It's all gonna be against your ass.
I'm gonna be on the floor, like,

849
00:50:24,924 --> 00:50:26,386
down, break-break-breakin'
that shit.

850
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:29,972
- You know what I'm saying?
- We've seen enough, Harold.

851
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:32,891
Harold: Break your back.
Break, break, break.

852
00:50:32,956 --> 00:50:34,712
Hi-ho, Silver!

853
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:41,586
Oh, shit!
That shit is cold.

854
00:50:41,692 --> 00:50:43,382
I'm going to piss in the pool.

855
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:46,544
I'm tellin' you,
somebody's gonna piss in it.

856
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,146
What's that?

857
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:50,739
Damn, girl,
that's my triple nipple.

858
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:58,096
You're gonna give me
goose bumps.

859
00:51:03,419 --> 00:51:05,786
I've been thinkin' about you
a lot lately.

860
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,225
- You have?
- Yeah.

861
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,909
- After I seen you last week.
- At the block party.

862
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:11,091
Yeah.

863
00:51:12,315 --> 00:51:14,519
I was looking for you
all day today.

864
00:51:14,587 --> 00:51:16,310
You were?

865
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:18,288
I thought about you
when I woke up.

866
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:24,760
"Where could Darcy be at?"
I was looking all over.

867
00:51:24,826 --> 00:51:28,787
I'll give you a dollar
if you let me suck your tit.

868
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:32,120
No, though, I'm serious.
Either of you guys.

869
00:51:32,186 --> 00:51:34,935
What really makes you think
I'll let you suck my tits?

870
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:38,450
I don't know. They're just
sittin' there all ripe and firm.

871
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,758
It makes you want to
suck on them.

872
00:51:40,794 --> 00:51:42,387
Don't touch!

873
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:44,947
Harold: Yeah, me too.

874
00:51:46,522 --> 00:51:48,410
Harold! Fuck you.

875
00:51:52,218 --> 00:51:54,225
I thought you had a girlfriend.

876
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:56,208
No, I ain't seeing nobody.

877
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:57,743
What about you?

878
00:51:57,818 --> 00:52:00,916
I can't. My mom won't let me
have a boyfriend.

879
00:52:00,985 --> 00:52:03,124
She won't?
Why not?

880
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:04,601
I don't know.

881
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:06,520
I guess it's 'cause
my sister Nicki...

882
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:08,919
had a baby when she was 15.

883
00:52:08,986 --> 00:52:12,630
She was real young so my mom's
very protective over me.

884
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,868
I can understand that.

885
00:52:16,441 --> 00:52:19,540
They just look so fucking good.

886
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:22,544
Yo, I truth or dare
you guys to kiss each other.

887
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:25,170
Sure.
We do it all the time.

888
00:52:28,154 --> 00:52:30,674
- Holy shit.
- Holy s... damn!

889
00:52:31,513 --> 00:52:33,585
Casper:
You guys are dykes, right?

890
00:52:33,657 --> 00:52:34,657
Shit!

891
00:52:36,473 --> 00:52:38,710
- No.
- How can you kiss each other?

892
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:40,086
How can you do that?

893
00:52:40,153 --> 00:52:41,876
It don't matter.
It just feels good.

894
00:52:41,945 --> 00:52:43,025
It's not like we're gay.

895
00:52:43,097 --> 00:52:45,366
It's just like kissing
another person, a friend.

896
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:47,538
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

897
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:49,648
- Yeah, it's no big deal.
- Not at all.

898
00:52:49,721 --> 00:52:51,543
I don't know.
I never seen...

899
00:52:51,608 --> 00:52:53,463
no shit like that
in my life.

900
00:52:53,528 --> 00:52:55,252
I think it looks nice,
though.

901
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:58,103
- I know you think it's nice.
- Do it again.

902
00:52:58,168 --> 00:52:59,826
Fuck outta here,
you guys.

903
00:52:59,896 --> 00:53:01,620
Come on.
One more time.

904
00:53:01,689 --> 00:53:03,379
Shut the fuck up.

905
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:06,645
You just did it. How the fuck
you ain't gonna do it again?

906
00:53:06,712 --> 00:53:08,752
- Do it again.
- Joy, do it again.

907
00:53:08,825 --> 00:53:11,159
- Stop sweatin' it, you guys
- Suck her titty then.

908
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:13,166
Why don't you suck
each other's dicks?

909
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,345
- I'm not gay.
- I'll fuck you up.

910
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:17,107
Why don't you kiss me,
then?

911
00:53:17,176 --> 00:53:19,794
I don't want to kiss you.
You're not a girl.

912
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,457
Yes, I am.

913
00:53:21,528 --> 00:53:23,568
- What's that?
- A clit.

914
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,811
Harold will do anything
for a kiss.

915
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,669
I don't want to kiss you,
Harold.

916
00:53:27,736 --> 00:53:30,037
- Come on, just one kiss.
- You're so fuckin' aggressive.

917
00:53:30,104 --> 00:53:31,380
I got to represent.

918
00:53:31,448 --> 00:53:32,910
Casper:
"It just feels good, that's all".

919
00:53:33,016 --> 00:53:34,674
- Shut up.
- We're just friends.

920
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,238
You made me horny
right now.

921
00:53:36,312 --> 00:53:38,865
Come on.
Why you gotta be like that?

922
00:53:38,936 --> 00:53:39,951
J ust one kiss.

923
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:41,682
(muffled screaming)

924
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:46,417
Give her one kiss.
Come on, man.

925
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:49,907
Harold. Fuck you.

926
00:54:03,831 --> 00:54:07,028
I say we go skinny-dipping, man.
Fuck this.

927
00:54:07,095 --> 00:54:09,200
- Let's just do it.
- Want to go skinny-dipping?

928
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:13,069
You should come back
to Steven's house tonight.

929
00:54:13,144 --> 00:54:14,605
Tonight?

930
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:17,548
Come on. We'll bug out.
His parents are away.

931
00:54:17,623 --> 00:54:20,340
I don't know.
I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.

932
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:23,025
You can rave another night.
A bunch of people'll be there.

933
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:24,688
- It'll be fun, I promise.
- Yeah?

934
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:28,400
Come on, it'll be nice.
It'll be a change of pace.

935
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:30,837
That club shit gets boring.

936
00:54:41,687 --> 00:54:42,996
Jenny!
What's up, girl?

937
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:44,818
- How you doin'?
- Let's go.

938
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,325
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hey.

939
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,238
(techno music)

940
00:55:32,502 --> 00:55:34,836
How you doin'?
My name is Chi.

941
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:36,014
Hi, Chi.

942
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:37,296
All right, baby.

943
00:55:53,973 --> 00:55:55,631
Jenny-Jen!
What's up?

944
00:55:56,757 --> 00:55:58,612
- How do you feel?
- What's goin' on?

945
00:55:58,677 --> 00:56:00,532
Oh, shit!
I got to show you something.

946
00:56:00,597 --> 00:56:02,931
It's a spectacle.
It's a real spectacle.

947
00:56:02,997 --> 00:56:04,404
Jesus Christ, look at this!

948
00:56:11,765 --> 00:56:13,194
What's up?

949
00:56:25,588 --> 00:56:27,661
Holy,
they're still goin'!

950
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:30,667
It's like amazing
sexual exploration!

951
00:56:31,508 --> 00:56:34,672
You don't have to look at us.
It's not a free show.

952
00:56:43,092 --> 00:56:44,092
Who are they?

953
00:56:44,117 --> 00:56:45,262
I don't know.

954
00:56:45,332 --> 00:56:48,049
I saw that one girl once before,
but she's like...

955
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:50,931
like I don't know, like her face
is all mangled and shit.

956
00:56:50,996 --> 00:56:53,417
But they look like cornballs
from Jersey on Ecstasy,

957
00:56:53,492 --> 00:56:54,769
feelin' the effects-tasy.

958
00:57:12,148 --> 00:57:15,017
I got something for you.
Check it out.

959
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:16,946
It's a present.
It's a pres.

960
00:57:17,011 --> 00:57:19,433
- What is it?
- It's a pres, Jenny-Jen.

961
00:57:20,596 --> 00:57:22,090
It's like bang-up stuff.

962
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:26,088
Yeah, it's called
the euphoric blockbuster

963
00:57:26,163 --> 00:57:28,400
and it's supposed
to make Special K look weak.

964
00:57:28,468 --> 00:57:29,515
- Take it.
- I don't...

965
00:57:29,588 --> 00:57:31,922
You look sad. Take it.
J ust swallow it.

966
00:57:31,987 --> 00:57:34,354
I promise.
J ust swallow it.

967
00:57:34,419 --> 00:57:37,834
You swallow it, you be floatin'
up in heaven with the angels.

968
00:57:37,907 --> 00:57:39,795
You'll be singing
with Sammy Davis, Jr.

969
00:57:39,859 --> 00:57:42,444
You'll be kissing
Leo Gorcey on the chops.

970
00:57:42,515 --> 00:57:44,970
Don't you know, don't you know
Trix are for kids, silly?

971
00:57:51,347 --> 00:57:52,776
Fucking asshole.

972
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:07,979
Fuck that, nigga.

973
00:58:10,259 --> 00:58:12,626
I'm gonna throw a rocket
at your ass.

974
00:59:02,482 --> 00:59:04,391
Yo, I got that fool.

975
00:59:05,778 --> 00:59:07,185
I got that one.

976
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:11,856
What's up, nigga?
Niggas is buggin'.

00:59:18,129 --> 00:59:20,976
- Ass crazed, ugly bitch.
- Ass crazed.

978
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:24,075
He said, he said, he said,
you're ass crazed.

979
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:26,633
He said you're ass crazed.

980
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:27,916
What's up, yo?

981
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,110
Chillin', yo.

982
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:34,926
Casper: What's a little nigga
like you doing drinking beer?

983
00:59:37,937 --> 00:59:40,303
What's up, Trix?

984
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,256
Gravediggers.

985
00:59:43,088 --> 00:59:45,576
Who'd want to make out
with those nasty-ass bitches, huh?

986
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:50,156
Them bitches that left.

987
00:59:50,225 --> 00:59:53,072
You don't know pussy
has no face, Javier.

988
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:54,697
- Stoops.
- Come on, man.

989
00:59:54,768 --> 00:59:56,524
You've never seen a puss.

990
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,632
I've seen a lot of puss.

991
01:00:01,873 --> 01:00:03,564
Hey, yo, Casper.

992
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,542
- Why are you called Casper?
- It's my name.

993
01:00:05,616 --> 01:00:07,525
Nobody's real name
is Casper.

994
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,062
That's my real name,
bitch.

995
01:00:09,137 --> 01:00:12,366
Why do you keep asking me
the same shit for?

996
01:00:12,433 --> 01:00:15,280
Why don't you go lose
some fuckin' weight for anyway?

997
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:17,286
Ought to go
to Weight Watchers.

998
01:00:20,592 --> 01:00:23,439
Casper: Nick, what kind of bitches
do you like to fuck?

999
01:00:25,616 --> 01:00:28,104
You like black bitches,
white bitches, what?

1000
01:00:28,176 --> 01:00:31,045
- Anything. It don't matter.
- You like any old thing?

1001
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,200
What age?

1002
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,047
- 16, 15...
- I bet you're a virgin now.

1003
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,007
Well, bet whatever
you want to bet, then.

1004
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:42,414
So when'd you hit it, yo?

1005
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,171
Don't worry about that.

1006
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,207
How'd you hit it then.
Doggy? What? Never, right?

1007
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,425
Probably a doggy.

1008
01:00:48,496 --> 01:00:50,284
You ever get a blow job?

1009
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:52,714
(choking and coughing)

1010
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,367
Jenny, come on. Let's dance.
Come on, let's dance.

1011
01:01:07,439 --> 01:01:08,814
- What?
- Come on, let's dance.

1012
01:01:08,879 --> 01:01:11,050
I don't feel all right.
You seen Telly around?

1013
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,159
Telly's at Steven's house
with a bunch of people.

1014
01:01:13,263 --> 01:01:14,605
Come on, dance.

1015
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:16,493
- Telly's at Steven's?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1016
01:01:46,414 --> 01:01:49,032
(giggling)

1017
01:02:02,734 --> 01:02:04,806
(retching)

1018
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:20,006
Oh, shit.

1019
01:02:21,294 --> 01:02:23,781
Why won't you give me
the time of day, Gertie?

1020
01:02:23,853 --> 01:02:24,803
Billy...

1021
01:02:24,813 --> 01:02:28,162
I love you, Gertie.
I feel like I love you.

1022
01:02:28,238 --> 01:02:31,337
You just best get yourself
out of my face, Billy.

1023
01:02:31,406 --> 01:02:33,740
What do you mean, Gertie?
I love you.

1024
01:02:33,805 --> 01:02:35,692
I want to do somethin' for you.

1025
01:02:35,758 --> 01:02:39,948
I want to take you out to dinner.
I want to take you out to eat.

1026
01:02:40,014 --> 01:02:43,330
Billy, take your
cracker ass out of my face.

1027
01:02:43,405 --> 01:02:47,431
Gertie, I didn't mean it.
Gertie.

1028
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:51,363
I want to buy you food,
corn dogs, anything.

1029
01:02:51,437 --> 01:02:53,608
Come on, baby.
J ust one more kiss.

1030
01:02:53,677 --> 01:02:55,051
No, Harold, no.

1031
01:02:55,117 --> 01:02:57,005
Come on, no.

1032
01:03:41,805 --> 01:03:43,233
You know what I'm sayin'?

1033
01:03:43,308 --> 01:03:45,926
I love you.
I want to get close to you.

1034
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:50,601
I want to, I want to feel you.
I want to be with you.

1035
01:03:50,668 --> 01:03:53,351
It's real like that.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1036
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,809
I want to... I want to sleep
with you, Gertie.

1037
01:03:57,836 --> 01:03:59,526
- Come on.
- No, no.

1038
01:04:07,947 --> 01:04:10,217
Where did you get that shit?

1039
01:04:10,284 --> 01:04:11,877
My brother.

1040
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:54,918
That is some good weed
that your brother has.

1041
01:04:54,987 --> 01:04:57,092
Where does he get it at?

1042
01:04:57,163 --> 01:04:59,781
I don't know.
He won't tell me.

1043
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:02,338
That sucks, your brother
won't tell you about it.

1044
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:04,679
'Cause it's kinda whacked.

1045
01:05:04,778 --> 01:05:07,942
If I knew where to get this,
I would get this every day.

1046
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:16,644
Yo, Ham...

1047
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:19,909
Pussy.

1048
01:05:19,979 --> 01:05:22,662
You takin' big hits
for a little guy.

1049
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:24,192
You're a fiend,
that's why.

1050
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:27,845
And you got,
you got gold on your neck, too?

1051
01:05:27,914 --> 01:05:29,375
That's crazy.

1052
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,654
That's nice.
Christ on your neck.

1053
01:05:31,722 --> 01:05:33,609
That's nice.
I like that.

1054
01:05:39,818 --> 01:05:43,014
- Jesus Christ.
- You believe in Him?

1055
01:05:43,082 --> 01:05:45,351
Yeah, I believe in Him.

1056
01:05:45,418 --> 01:05:47,523
That guy is the Saver, man.

1057
01:05:47,594 --> 01:05:49,285
He's cool.

1058
01:05:49,354 --> 01:05:50,597
Saved his life.

1059
01:05:54,474 --> 01:05:56,099
- What's up, Jeff?
- 'S up?

1060
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:58,599
Chillin'.

1061
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:01,732
My man fucked up right here.

1062
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,360
Oh, shit.

1063
01:06:10,602 --> 01:06:12,773
Oh, shit.

1064
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:21,478
That weed got you so fucked up
where you don't want to hit it?

1065
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:23,432
- That shit got me open.
- Yeah.

1066
01:06:23,497 --> 01:06:25,766
- Like it?
- Yeah, dig it, y'all.

1067
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:28,004
It feels different,
like you're in another world...

1068
01:06:28,073 --> 01:06:30,823
like you zone out.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1069
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:32,034
You're straight man.

1070
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:34,472
You straight?

1071
01:06:34,537 --> 01:06:37,636
That's my limit.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1072
01:06:37,705 --> 01:06:39,079
The big hit man.

1073
01:06:39,145 --> 01:06:41,218
You know what I'm sayin'?
Big hit, baby.

1074
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,710
Get high quick.
Big hits.

1075
01:06:43,785 --> 01:06:45,573
I see the cherry go big, yo.

1076
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:46,720
Word?

1077
01:06:46,792 --> 01:06:49,792
Steam that shit.
Big hit man.

1078
01:06:49,865 --> 01:06:51,752
Big hit.

1079
01:06:51,817 --> 01:06:55,559
Well, see, a person like me
smoke weed until I hallucinate.

1080
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,152
I don't know why, either.

1081
01:06:57,225 --> 01:06:59,264
Crazy, right?

1082
01:06:59,336 --> 01:07:02,849
This party was dope,
but that shit got played quick.

1083
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,927
But the bitches
are freaky here.

1084
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,539
# Casper, the friendly ghost,
the friendly ghost #

1085
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:12,161
# The dopest ghost in town. #

1086
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:16,258
# The bitches love me because
I'm fuckin' Casper #

1087
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:18,881
# The dopest ghost around. #

1088
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,676
Fuck, yeah.

1089
01:07:23,912 --> 01:07:26,563
I'm not gonna die.

1090
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:41,478
Do you like kissin' me?

1091
01:07:41,544 --> 01:07:42,820
Yes.

1092
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:46,335
- Do you like me?
- U h-huh.

1093
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:48,960
I think you're like the best girl
I've ever kissed.

1094
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:58,534
(sobbing)

1095
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:05,669
I couldn't stop thinking
about you

1096
01:08:05,735 --> 01:08:07,808
ever since I seen you
at the block party.

1097
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:09,340
Come on.

1098
01:08:09,415 --> 01:08:12,262
I'm serious.
I'm not jokin'.

1099
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:14,334
I just like you. That's all.

1100
01:08:14,407 --> 01:08:16,229
I like you, too.

1101
01:08:52,966 --> 01:08:55,203
Hey, yo, Steven.

1102
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:57,157
Come on, man.
Steven!

1103
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:58,597
What, man?

1104
01:08:58,662 --> 01:09:01,411
Let me in your parents' room.
J ust for a while.

1105
01:09:01,478 --> 01:09:02,591
No, I can't, man.

1106
01:09:02,662 --> 01:09:04,604
Come on, man.
Hook me up.

1107
01:09:04,678 --> 01:09:06,979
Do me this solid.

1108
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:09,860
Come on, man.
Yo, I gotta get Darcy alone, man.

1109
01:09:09,925 --> 01:09:12,478
She's gonna let me fuck her.

1110
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:15,778
All right, man. J ust don't fuck
with anything, all right?

1111
01:09:15,846 --> 01:09:16,846
All right.

1112
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:06,332
Telly, I'm nervous.

1113
01:10:07,493 --> 01:10:10,340
Trust me.
Don't be nervous.

1114
01:11:30,563 --> 01:11:31,938
Sorry.

1115
01:11:55,459 --> 01:11:58,175
I like you so much.

1116
01:11:58,243 --> 01:12:01,090
I think you're beautiful.

1117
01:12:01,154 --> 01:12:03,543
If we fucked,
you would love it.

1118
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,986
You wouldn't believe it.

1119
01:12:06,051 --> 01:12:07,774
How do you know?

1120
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:13,409
I just know.
You'll love it.

1121
01:12:14,722 --> 01:12:17,243
But I'm scared, Telly.

1122
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:21,985
I'm tellin' you, there's nothin'
in the world to worry about.

1123
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,708
Nothing?

1124
01:12:35,234 --> 01:12:36,412
Nothing.

1125
01:12:37,922 --> 01:12:41,086
I just want to make you
happy, that's all.

1126
01:12:41,154 --> 01:12:43,390
Trust me.

1127
01:12:43,874 --> 01:12:47,103
I don't want you to hurt me.

1128
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:49,275
You know it won't hurt.

1129
01:12:49,346 --> 01:12:51,201
I'll be gentle, I promise.

1130
01:12:52,897 --> 01:12:55,931
Do you care about me?

1131
01:12:56,002 --> 01:12:58,173
Of course I do.

1132
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:08,825
# The friendly ghost #

1133
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:12,727
# You know
I'm the dopest ghost in town. #

1134
01:13:12,801 --> 01:13:17,852
# The bitches all love me
'cause I'm fuckin' Casper. #

1135
01:13:17,921 --> 01:13:19,961
Fuckin' shit.

1136
01:13:20,033 --> 01:13:22,138
Casper.

1137
01:13:22,209 --> 01:13:23,583
What's up, Jenny?

1138
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,170
What are you doin' here?
Long time no see.

1139
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:27,386
Casper, where's Telly?

1140
01:13:27,457 --> 01:13:29,344
What do you want
with Telly for?

1141
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:31,743
That guy's got
enough bitches.

1142
01:13:31,809 --> 01:13:33,216
Where is he?

1143
01:13:34,784 --> 01:13:37,173
Well, don't look for him.
He's doin' fine.

1144
01:13:37,249 --> 01:13:38,875
He got a girl.

1145
01:13:40,384 --> 01:13:42,970
He's fucking her right now
in Steven's parents' room.

1146
01:13:43,072 --> 01:13:44,414
(laughing)

1147
01:13:44,449 --> 01:13:46,936
So what you know, Joe?

1148
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:54,045
What's she lookin' worried
about that nigga for, huh?

1149
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,906
Oh, Ham.
Hit this yo. Ham.

1150
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,878
Telly, it hurts.

1151
01:14:12,672 --> 01:14:14,460
That's it.
You're doin' fine.

1152
01:14:14,528 --> 01:14:16,601
Come on.
Come on. That's it.

1153
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:23,417
(moaning in pain)

1154
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:28,471
That's it.
You're doin' fine.

1155
01:14:28,543 --> 01:14:31,293
Come on, Darcy.
That's it.

1156
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,272
Telly, it hurts.
Ow.

1157
01:14:45,344 --> 01:14:47,831
Come on, Darcy.
That's it. Come on.

1158
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,502
Shut the fuckin' door!

1159
01:15:49,471 --> 01:15:51,445
(glass shatters)

1160
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:00,916
What's up, Ham?

1161
01:16:03,902 --> 01:16:06,041
(laughing)

1162
01:16:52,349 --> 01:16:54,236
(coughing)

1163
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:07,739
Lucky fuckin' bastard.

1164
01:18:10,492 --> 01:18:12,281
Hey, Jenny, wake up.

1165
01:18:15,644 --> 01:18:17,400
Hey, Jenny, wake up.

1166
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:36,469
Jenny, wake up.

1167
01:20:07,673 --> 01:20:09,560
Don't worry, Jenny.
It's me, Casper.

1168
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,437
Don't worry, Jenny.

1169
01:20:23,257 --> 01:20:24,337
Jenny: No.

1170
01:20:24,441 --> 01:20:26,263
Shh. Shh.

1171
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:37,525
Shh.

1172
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,106
It's me, Casper.
Don't worry.

1173
01:22:02,423 --> 01:22:03,983
Shh...

1174
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,509
Don't.

1175
01:24:10,965 --> 01:24:13,103
Telly: When you're young,
not much matters.

1176
01:24:13,172 --> 01:24:15,212
When you find something
that you care about,

1177
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:17,073
then that's all you got.

1178
01:24:17,108 --> 01:24:20,174
When you go to sleep at night,
you dream of pussy.

1179
01:24:20,244 --> 01:24:22,349
When you wake up,
it's the same thing.

1180
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:25,486
It's there in your face.
You can't escape it.

1181
01:24:25,556 --> 01:24:27,018
Sometimes when you're young,

1182
01:24:27,092 --> 01:24:28,947
the only place to go is inside.

1183
01:24:29,012 --> 01:24:31,947
That's just it.
Fuckin' is what I love.

1184
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:34,769
That that away from me
and I really got nothin'.

1185
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:43,947
Jesus Christ,
what happened?
