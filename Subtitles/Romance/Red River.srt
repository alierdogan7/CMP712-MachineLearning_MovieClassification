00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,847
- Indians maybe.
- Maybe so.

172
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,542
I'm taking it away from him.

173
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:07,078
Others have thought as you.
Others have tried.

174
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,554
And you've always been
good enough to stop them?

175
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:11,386
It is my work.

176
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,386
Pretty unhealthy job.

177
00:17:15,462 --> 00:17:17,029
Get away, Matt.

178
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm sorry for you--

179
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:27,966
How about you?
You want some of it?

180
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,773
It is not my land. I will wait
until Don Diego tells me what to do.

181
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:37,372
Go tell him what happened.
Tell him what I said.

182
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:42,113
Take your friend's horse.
We'll bury him. Move!

183
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:52,153
Matt, I told you to get away.
You might have got hurt.

184
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,289
He went for his gun first,
but you seemed to know--

185
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,129
Next time, do what I say.

186
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,295
- How'd you know he was gonna draw?
- By watching his eyes.

187
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,339
- Remember that.
- I will.

188
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:09,971
Get a shovel and my Bible.

189
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,982
I'll read over him.

190
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:21,792
"We brought nothing into this world,
and it's certain we carry nothing out.

191
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,385
The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away.

192
00:18:24,463 --> 00:18:26,897
Blessed be the name
of the Lord. Amen."

193
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:45,479
Turn 'em loose.

194
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,257
[ Cattle Mooing ]

195
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:02,023
[ Matthew ]
They're going to get away.

196
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,034
[ Dunson ] Wherever they go,
they'll be on my land.

197
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:13,234
My land. We're here,
and we're going to stay here.

198
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:19,246
Give me 10 years. I'll have that brand
on the greatest ranch in Texas.

199
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:26,456
The big house will be down by the river,
and the corrals and the barns behind it.

200
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:29,153
It'll be a good place to live in.

201
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:34,494
Ten years and I'll have the Red River D
on more cattle than you've ever seen.

202
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:39,265
I'll have that brand on enough beef
to feed the whole country.

203
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,965
Good beef for hungry people.

204
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,443
Beef to make them strong,
make them grow.

205
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:49,969
It takes work, and it takes sweat.

206
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:53,882
And it takes time,
lots of time.

207
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:55,544
It takes years.

208
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:00,122
Well, we've had
our ten years and more.

209
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:02,494
- About 14.
- Near to 15, and we've got the cattle.

210
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,019
- About 14.
- Near to 15, and we've got the cattle.

211
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,122
Thousands of heads of good beef.

212
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,227
And there as they stand there isn't
a head worth a plug three-cent piece.

213
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:16,434
Three-cent piece? That's more silver
money than I've seen since the war.

214
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:20,274
That's right. It all happened
while you were away, Matt.

215
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:24,975
More cattle than a man could
gather elsewhere in two lifetimes.

216
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,282
And I'm broke.
Unless we can move them, I'm broke.

217
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,946
Figured that's why
you rounded them up.

218
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,321
I'm not going to take it haunch-backed
like the rest around here.

219
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:36,587
- If there's no cattle market in Texas--
- And there ain't.

220
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:38,595
Then I'll take them
where there is a market...

221
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:40,688
if it means driving them
a thousand miles.

222
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:42,756
- Missouri?
- Yeah.

223
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,961
That's what I figured.

224
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,130
Seems you two have been
doing a lot of figuring.

225
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,073
While you were at it, did you figure out
the best way to get them there?

226
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:55,442
Which trail to take? Yeah. San Saba,
then Meridian, then along the Brazos--

227
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:56,810
That's the long way around.

228
00:20:57,816 --> 00:20:59,613
Along the Brazos and up Palo Pinto--

229
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:02,278
- I said that's the long way.
- I know it's the long way.

230
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:04,982
But there's good water
clear all the way up to the Red.

231
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,320
But going that way,
we'd get two extra crossings.

232
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,952
- You're not going. How do you know--
- I'm not?

233
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:12,690
No, you're not.
How do you know the water's good?

234
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:16,291
- I led a patrol that way.
- You think it's worth--

235
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:18,893
You think it's worth--
What are you mumbling about?

236
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,938
Where are those store teeth
Matt brought you?

237
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:22,940
- In my pocket.
- Why don't you use them?

238
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:25,033
They whistle.
I use them for eating.

239
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,135
- Can't understand you.
- Everybody else can.

240
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:28,770
What did you say?

241
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:31,714
I said, there's a lot of things
you don't know about, Mr. Dunson.

242
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:34,217
- What?
- First, about me going on this drive.

243
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:35,480
Go ahead.

244
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:37,714
- It's a thousand miles to Missouri?
- That's right.

245
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:39,780
You figure me and my bad leg
couldn't ride a horse that far.

246
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:42,292
-That's it.
-It might be I could ride a chuck wagon.

247
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,622
We've already got a cook.

248
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,227
That is right, Mr. Dunson.

249
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,567
But might be Old Cookie might not
like grubbing the trip all that way.

250
00:21:53,638 --> 00:21:56,198
You heard me good that time,
didn't you?

251
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,573
It might be the time of year when old
Cookie would like a change of scenery.

252
00:21:59,644 --> 00:22:03,341
Might be I already persuaded him,
'cause he up and quit this morning!

253
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:10,178
Well, then, it might be we could
persuade you to drive the chuck wagon.

254
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:12,917
Might be, Mr. Dunson. Might be.

255
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,762
That's a pretty nice gun
you're scratching those matches on.

256
00:22:25,704 --> 00:22:29,902
- How is your gun arm?
- I've used it a lot the last few years.

257
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,169
- Get me my horse, will you, Matt?
- Yeah.

258
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:35,610
Funny thing about guns--
Draw!

259
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,006
I haven't heard that
in a lot of years.

260
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:42,485
He beat you.
You knew it was coming. He beat you.

261
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:46,183
I'd say he was just a little faster,
just a mite faster than you was.

262
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:50,023
Matt, draw up a map of that country
we were talking about--

263
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:54,156
- I did. It's on your desk.
- [ Groot Cackles ]

264
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:56,462
Mite faster
about a lot of things.

265
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:58,802
I'll see you later.

266
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,937
That's the first time in one year
I see the grin on his face...

267
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,534
except the other day
when you come home.

268
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:10,080
- Didn't you see anything else?
- Huh?

269
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:15,509
That look on his face
when he was talking about the cattle.

270
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,749
- He's afraid.
- Afraid?

271
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:21,553
- You're crazy. You're looney--
- Am I?

272
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:26,555
Sure, sure. I'm scared too.

273
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:29,031
But I've been here
watching and seeing--

274
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,160
- Seeing what?
- Seeing a man fighting.

275
00:23:32,237 --> 00:23:34,967
Fighting with his soul and gut
to hang on to this place.

276
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,270
Fourteen years of it,
and it cost him dear too.

277
00:23:38,343 --> 00:23:41,312
Cost him a woman.
The only woman he ever wanted.

278
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,438
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You know about that.

279
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:45,608
Cost him the killing
of them seven graves.

280
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:49,483
Men who tried to take the place
away from him, but that weren't hard.

281
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,251
He knows that kind of fighting.
What else?

282
00:23:53,324 --> 00:23:55,417
Then come the war
while you was away.

283
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:57,427
He learned a lot of things
for himself.

284
00:23:57,495 --> 00:24:00,055
He learned that a ranch
ain't only beef but it's money.

285
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:02,224
But the war took all the money
out of the South.

286
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,669
He didn't know about money. He never
had none. He didn't know what to do.

287
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,866
You mean he just doesn't know
who to fight.

288
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:12,273
That's all right.

289
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:16,177
He's just been waiting for you
to head the herd north in a full drive.

290
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:20,377
It's never been done before.
Ten thousand cattle clear to Missouri.

291
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:23,182
- We could make it.
- We--

292
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:28,351
I'm glad you come home, 'cause--

293
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,360
Well...

294
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,592
I'm glad you come home.

295
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,880
Let him go!

296
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,422
Hey, Matt. It's a Diego.

297
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,923
Let him go.

298
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:07,297
Another Meeker.

299
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:09,731
- Turn him loose.
- Hold it!

300
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:13,362
- Put a brand on him.
- It's a Meeker steer.

301
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:17,067
- I said brand him.
- He's wearing a Meeker iron.

302
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:19,705
I can't see it.

303
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:23,605
Brand him.

304
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:25,650
All right, but the next one up
is another Diego.

305
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,087
Brand him.

306
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,056
Put the iron
on all of them, Teeler.

307
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:41,189
Anything you see, slap it with
a Red River D and burn it deep.

308
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:42,698
Why not?

309
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:48,328
You're going to wind up branding
every rump in Texas except mine.

310
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:51,799
Hand me that iron.

311
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:57,739
- You don't think I'd do it, do you?
- No, I don't.

312
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:03,615
I'm going to Missouri with every steer,
cow and bull I can lay my hands on.

313
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:09,126
I think Meeker might be real pleased
to see our brand on his stock.

314
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,753
That I'll argue with Meeker.

315
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:16,892
And now might be a good time. He's
even got some people to back him up.

316
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,469
I want to see this.

317
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,980
Howdy, Dunson. Matt.

318
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,209
I hear you're making
a drive, Dunson.

319
00:26:33,284 --> 00:26:36,048
News travels fast.
Yeah, we're going to Missouri.

320
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,782
That's what I heard. I also heard
something else yesterday.

321
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:42,383
Cumberland, a neighbor of mine,
drove 3,000 head to the Red River.

322
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,394
When he got across,
the Missouri border gangs jumped him...

323
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:46,828
stole the herd, killed all his men.

324
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,831
- Hard luck.
- You know about it then?

325
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,663
I know about Cumberland and Shriver
and a lot of others...

326
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,704
but nobody's gonna take my cattle.

327
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,762
I don't want anybody
to take mine either.

328
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,831
I hear some of my brand
wandered over this way.

329
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,741
- Mind if we look your herd over?
- I do mind.

330
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,870
- You'd stop us?
- Yeah, we would.

331
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,881
Can't you hold that horse still?

332
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,846
Well?

333
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:11,479
- Shall we take that look around?
- You must be new around here.

334
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:14,524
- [ Matt ] I told you we'd stop--
- I heard you.

335
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,583
Well, Mr. Meeker?

336
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,651
Maybe I should introduce you two
before you--

337
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:22,495
- [ Matt ] Who are you?
- Some call me one thing, some another.

338
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:25,729
- What do they call you most?
- By my name, Cherry Valance.

339
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:29,295
- Of Val Verde?
- Val Verde way.

340
00:27:29,373 --> 00:27:32,001
- We've heard of you.
- Thanks.

341
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:34,544
They say you're good with a gun.
How good?

342
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:38,514
-I manage to stay alive.
-[ Matt ] You've been doing pretty good.

343
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:41,574
- Still want to stop us?
- Yeah.

344
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,654
Well, Mr. Meeker,
what do you say?

345
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:49,921
At one time, I would have said yes.
But now-- Look, Tom.

346
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:53,657
- Everything I've got--
- Yeah, I know. Me too.

347
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:58,031
We rounded up some of yours, Diego's
and everybody else's around here.

348
00:27:58,102 --> 00:27:59,296
And?

349
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,067
I haven't got the time
or inclination to cut them out.

350
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,870
I'll drive them to Missouri and give you
two dollars a head when I get back.

351
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:09,037
- And if you don't get back?
- That's your gamble.

352
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:14,210
I reckon it is. Not a bad one either.
All right, suits me.

353
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:17,379
Mr. Meeker, I changed my mind
about working with you.

354
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:18,887
Can you use another hand?

355
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:22,391
- We're full up.
- I'd like to go with you to Missouri.

356
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:25,792
- I told you--
- I heard you. I care to go along.

357
00:28:25,863 --> 00:28:28,627
Might find it harder to stay alive
along the Missouri border.

358
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:31,265
I might at that.

359
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,630
Wages are $10 a month.

Triple if the steers
bring $15 at the railroad.

361
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:39,609
- We lose the herd, you lose your wages.
- Fair enough.

362
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,804
All right, good luck.

363
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,608
Good-bye, Mr. Meeker.

- Sure.

Yes, sir!
Brand them all, boys! Get going!

369
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,492
You ought to stick around
back there.

370

- What for?
- See the shooting.

371
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,234
- You reckon they're going to fight?
- Not yet.

372
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:12,400
They'll just paw at each other,
find out what they're up against.

373
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:14,239
Worth seeing.

374
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:15,835
Could be.

375
00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:21,012
Let's give 'em a hand here.

376
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:24,782
Sure. That's a good-looking gun you were
about to use back there. Can I see it?

377
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:33,626
Maybe you'd like to see mine.

378
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,967
Nice. Awful nice.

379
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:44,632
There are only two things
more beautiful than a good gun.

380
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,575
A Swiss watch
or a woman from anywhere.

381
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:49,579
You ever had a good Swiss watch?

382

Go ahead. Try it.

Hey, hey, that's good too.
Go on. Keep it going.

385
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:19,171
Yeah, now I know who you'd be.

386
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:22,371
- You'd be Matthew Garth, wouldn't you?
- That's right.

387
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,971
You're as good
as they say you are.

388
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:27,210
Maybe as good as me.

389
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,445
That puts two of us
at the head of the list.

- Dunson.

- He taught me.

- How are you doing?
- What was all that shooting?

394
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:51,840
That shooting was two of the best men
with a gun anybody had ever seen.

- Who?
- Matt and Cherry Valance.

When they do, it ain't gonna be pretty.

figured Matt was better--

I could take that personal.

00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,712
Yeah, and I could take the end
of your nose off just as easy.

a happy Injun. Look at that gaping puss.

when an Injun's running a bluff?

00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:38,147
- Yah-hah!
- Yee-hah!

495
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,376
- Yee-hah!
- Ee-yah!

496
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,509
- Eee--
- Yah-hah!

497
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:16,507
All right, Quo!
Let's go to Missouri!

[ Whooping, Coughing ]

499
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:45,537
There they are, Matt.
Fourteen years of hard work.

500
00:38:47,484 --> 00:38:50,419
And they say
we can't make the drive.

501
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:52,421
They could be wrong.

502
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:54,813
Better be.

503
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:21,809
Teeler, you and Walt and Simms
are on the next watch.

504
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,820
Breakfast at 4:30, Groot.
Trail at 5:00.

505
00:39:24,888 --> 00:39:26,355
All right, Tom.

506
00:39:26,423 --> 00:39:28,755
Hey, Quo, when you're
finished there, get some--

507
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,292
What's the matter?

508
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,487
- Grub finished?
- Sure. I ate.

509
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:36,054
- Give 'em tooth.
- Teeth, I told you.

510
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:38,726
It's only a few hours till morning.
I'll be using them again.

511
00:39:38,802 --> 00:39:40,736
Come morning, you get 'em.

512
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:44,763
This is getting to be plumb crazy.
We been doing this all day.

513
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,469
By the time we get to Missouri,
we'll have them all wore out...

514
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:50,775
passing them back and forth
and back and forth.

515
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:54,510
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you 100% profit.

516
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:56,518
I'll give you two dollars
for your half interest.

517
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:02,522
Not now. When I get it.
When we finish the drive.

518
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:06,358
I get money,
you get 'em tooth.

519
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:10,729
Teeth, you dumb heathen.
Why do I always have to--

520
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,734
Oh, what's the use?

521
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:21,100
The way we worked it,
along the Brazos, the Palo Pinto...

522
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:26,171
up to the Red,
then north to Sedalia.

523
00:40:27,517 --> 00:40:30,918
You make that drive to Sedalia
look very easy.

524
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:34,150
There are a lot of rough boys along
the border. I just got back from there.

525
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,852
You want to stick your nose
back in that country?

526
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:39,451
Cherry, how come
you joined the drive?

527
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:42,327
Just a notion I had.
Then Matt turned me down.

528
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:47,962
Made me want to go. Besides,
I've taken a liking to that gun of his.

529
00:40:48,037 --> 00:40:51,131
Fat chance you got
of getting that, bub.

530
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:54,870
I've been wondering. Why'd you
turn me down? You're not afraid of me.

531
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:58,209
You know what happens if this drive
doesn't get to market?

532
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,340
According to Dunson,
we lose our wages.

533
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,317
You've been all through the state.
What did you see?

534
00:41:02,385 --> 00:41:06,879
Yeah, I know. Cattle running wild.
Carpetbaggers reaching with both hands.

535
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:09,322
Ranchers roasting grain
and calling it coffee.

536
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:13,954
- I've been doing it for two months.
- I saw a man swap a steer for flour.

537
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,555
I know why you want to get through.
Maybe I do too.

538
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:19,568
But why to Missouri? Why not turn west
at the Red and head them for Kansas?

539
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:21,365
- Kansas?
- What?

540
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:24,965
Fine "howdy-ma'am" that would be
when the railroad's in Missouri.

541
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,066
- Railroad in Kansas too.
- Where?

542
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:29,873
I saw the one in Topeka,
and there's one in Abilene.

543
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,278
Abilene? That's further west.

544
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:34,373
Did you see it in Abilene?

545
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,716
I didn't get there.
I met a girl in Kansas City.

546
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,347
She fancied she could sing,
but she had other--

547
00:41:40,423 --> 00:41:43,358
If we could head west at the Red--

548
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:45,394
- We'd save ourselves a heap of--
- [ Dunson ] We're going to Missouri.

549
00:41:47,163 --> 00:41:51,000
I've seen buyers and cash in Sedalia.
What have you seen in Abilene?

550
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,533
Not a thing.
Just a girl told me.

551
00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:55,832
- A girl with hair the color--
- Seems to me, Mr. Dunson--

552
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:58,805
- I didn't ask you, Groot.
- No, that's right.

553
00:41:58,874 --> 00:42:01,069
You didn't ask me, Mr. Dunson.

554
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:04,378
We're going to Missouri.

555
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:09,074
Suppose if I tangled with him,
I'd have to take you on too.

556
00:42:13,522 --> 00:42:17,458
You'll find him
a handful by himself.

557
00:42:40,649 --> 00:42:45,052
- How much further we going today?
- About four miles north. There's--

558
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,113
Hold that horse. There's
a good stream and bed grounds.

559
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,125
Cinch him up.

560
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,795
That old ankle's sure puffing up.

561
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,024
Yeah.

562
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:59,932
We're going to have
to paint it tonight.

563
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:07,771
Keep 'em moving.

564
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,512
It's a good thing
we got a big remuda.

565
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:17,518
He's been wearing out
three, four horses a day.

566
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:20,487
- All the same, I don't like it.
- What don't you like?

567
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:24,549
Everything's going too good. We're
bound to have a hat full of trouble.

568
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:27,186
- Always yammering, I tell you.
- Well--

569
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:30,698
I don't like to see things
go good or bad.

570
00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:33,064
I like 'em in-between.

571
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:46,648
Groot, what's Dan riding
in Quo's wagon for?

572
00:43:46,715 --> 00:43:48,945
- I was wanting to discuss that myself.
- What?

573
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:51,042
- I was wanting to discuss that--
- I can't understand you.

574
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,418
Why don't you use your teeth?

575
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:54,478
Whoa!

576
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:00,027
My teeth is just
what we was discussing.

577
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:03,064
Well, talk on your own time.
Dan should be working.

578
00:44:03,132 --> 00:44:06,033
If you was half human, you'd give
them back to me. I could use them.

579
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,569
Besides, they'd help
keep the dust out of my mouth.

580
00:44:08,637 --> 00:44:10,571
Keep mouth shut.
Dust not get in.

581
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,040
Bet I ate 10 pounds
in the last 16 days.

582
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,600
Before this shenanigan's over,
I'll probably eat enough land...

Ow! That hurt!

585
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:27,116
Teeth or no teeth, I can still use me
a whip, and you keep out of that sugar.

586
00:44:27,189 --> 00:44:29,589
Too late, Pop.
I already got me some.

587
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:34,823
Having a sweet tooth is almost as bad as
having a whiskey tongue or liking women.

588
00:44:34,897 --> 00:44:39,129
A hundred days. Well, all I got
to worry about is feeding them.

There's water
three or four miles on ahead.

00:45:51,173 --> 00:45:52,834

a pretty tough day.

- I think in all fairness--
- I'll do the thinking.

too good to be true.

We're moving on!

Get up from there, you!

00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:45,625

00:46:45,694 --> 00:46:47,127
All right, Matt.

611
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:55,929
- Hi, Laredo. Just get in?
- Yep. Got any coffee?

612
00:46:56,004 --> 00:46:58,495
- I'll get you some.
- What'd you find?

613
00:46:58,573 --> 00:47:01,133
Good water ahead
for the next three days.

00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:04,440
- Where's Dunson?
- He and Matt are out with the herd.

- How they doing?
- Kind of uneasy.

00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:46,444
That coyote
ain't helping them none.

626

- No.
- Whoa, cattle.

627
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:53,419
Just keep quieting them.
They'll be all right.

628

Sure hope nothing happens.

00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,988
I've been thinking about the drive
and what it means to everybody.

- Me too. It means that--
- What does it mean, Dan?

Well, one thing...

- A whole lot of things.

a little pair of red shoes.

I'd get them for her.

Is that such a fool idea,

641
00:48:32,601 --> 00:48:36,935
It's a good idea, Dan.
I'd do it.

Making them spooky.

put them on the prod.

Wouldn't take much
to stampede the whole outfit.

01:05:52,002 --> 01:05:53,993
All I want is--
Where are you going?

824
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:58,535
- I'm going to sit down.
- You got work to do.

825
01:05:58,609 --> 01:06:00,543
Watch it.

826
01:06:00,611 --> 01:06:03,774
I was just getting myself
a drink of water.

827
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:14,255
I'm just listening.

828
01:06:15,826 --> 01:06:20,058
Well, there's quitters
to be buried. I'll--

829
01:06:21,531 --> 01:06:24,159
I'll read over them
in the morning.

830
01:06:25,335 --> 01:06:28,498
Planting and reading.
Planting and reading.

831
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:33,600
Fill a man full of lead, stick him in
the ground and then read words at him.

832
01:06:33,677 --> 01:06:38,774
Why when you kill a man, why try to read
the Lord in as a partner on the job?

833
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:54,321
Well?

834
01:06:54,398 --> 01:06:56,628
You didn't have to do that
back there.

835
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,930
- You joined in.
- Yeah, and I thought you were wrong.

836
01:06:59,002 --> 01:07:01,835
- Then why didn't you--
- Don't try and tell me what to think.

837
01:07:01,905 --> 01:07:04,135
I'll take your orders about work
but not about what to think.

838
01:07:04,207 --> 01:07:07,108
- You think I'm to blame for that?
- Just as sure as you're sitting there.

839
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:12,345
- And so?
- So I'll take your orders.

840
01:07:23,257 --> 01:07:25,623
- Got you in the leg, huh?
- Yeah.

841
01:07:35,436 --> 01:07:39,236
- Ain't bad.
- Went clean through.

842
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:41,240
Ain't as bad as it should be.

843
01:07:42,209 --> 01:07:44,905
You too?
What do you got to say?

844
01:07:44,979 --> 01:07:48,380
Nothing. If I did,
you wouldn't listen to it.

845
01:08:03,464 --> 01:08:06,763
- You find them?
- No. They're gone, all right.

846
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:08,768
That's a pretty howdy-do.

847
01:08:08,836 --> 01:08:13,364
You ought to--
No, I better tell him myself.

848
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:21,280
Tom. Tom.

849
01:08:25,586 --> 01:08:28,248
Teeler, Laredo and Bill Kelsey
are gone.

850
01:08:28,322 --> 01:08:30,290
- What?
- They up and left.

851
01:08:31,725 --> 01:08:34,592
-How do you know?
-I went to wake them. They wasn't there.

852
01:08:34,662 --> 01:08:36,630
- When did they go?
- During the night.

853
01:08:37,665 --> 01:08:40,498
They was on second guard.
It could have happened anytime.

854
01:08:40,568 --> 01:08:43,435
Anybody know anything about
Teeler, Kelsey or Laredo?

855
01:08:43,504 --> 01:08:45,938
There ain't no doubt.
I checked the wagon.

856
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:48,304
We're shy some cartridges,
flour and a mite of salt.

857
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,809
- How many cartridges?
- This side of a hundred.

858
01:08:50,878 --> 01:08:52,345
- Flour?
- One sack.

859
01:08:52,413 --> 01:08:54,210
Sneaking yellow--

860
01:08:55,316 --> 01:08:58,342
Well, they're not going to--
Matt, get--

861
01:08:58,419 --> 01:09:01,786
No. Cherry, get mounted,
and take Grant here and Bill--

862
01:09:01,855 --> 01:09:05,188
- Grant will be enough.
- They'll probably head straight south.

863
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:07,352
Find them, and bring them back.

864
01:09:07,428 --> 01:09:09,919
- Supposing they won't come?
- Bring them!

865
01:09:09,997 --> 01:09:12,329
We'll catch up with you.

866
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,334
From now on,
this outfit's going to move.

867
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:16,767
Get them going.

868
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:34,447
Matt? Keep your point moving.
The drag's catching up.

869
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:35,954
Sure.

870
01:09:48,335 --> 01:09:50,030
The Red River ahead!

871
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:53,830
Hey, it's the Red River!

872
01:09:53,907 --> 01:09:56,102
Red River ahead!

873
01:09:57,244 --> 01:09:59,178
Red River ahead!

874
01:10:22,102 --> 01:10:26,038
Hyah! Hi-yah! Hyah!

875
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:46,148
- Well, here's your Red.
- It's quite a river.

876
01:10:47,394 --> 01:10:50,488
We sure had a lot smaller herd
the last time we crossed.

877
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,667
One bull and a cow.

878
01:10:55,736 --> 01:10:58,432
Well, this looks like
as good a place as any.

879
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:01,235
This will take us the rest of the day
and part of the night.

880
01:11:01,308 --> 01:11:04,004
- Why not cross fresh in the morning?
- We'll put them across now.

881
01:11:04,078 --> 01:11:07,707
-You got a pretty tired bunch behind us.
-Tired men don't run away.

882
01:11:07,781 --> 01:11:10,409
We can't keep them this wore out
the rest of the drive.

883
01:11:10,484 --> 01:11:13,920
No, but we can keep them this wore out
until Cherry gets back.

884
01:11:13,987 --> 01:11:15,955
Then nobody
will want to run away.

885
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:19,754
- Mark for us, will you, Leather?
- Sure enough.

886
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:40,274
Quicksand out in here!
Mark it!

887
01:11:44,685 --> 01:11:49,247
More of it in here!
Mark it from the stump to the tree!

888
01:11:49,323 --> 01:11:50,813
From the stump to the tree!

889
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:54,156
- How is it up there, Matt?
- Firm all the way!

890
01:11:55,262 --> 01:11:58,163
Bring them on in!
Keep them downstream!

891
01:11:58,232 --> 01:11:59,995
Bring them on!

892
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:03,036
- Matt, watch for strays!
- Right!

893
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:35,358
Come on, cattle!
Get in, cattle!

894
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:39,065
Come on, cattle.
Come on. Get going.

895
01:12:57,825 --> 01:13:00,293
Hyah, cattle! Go!

896
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,089
Come on, cattle!

897
01:13:11,438 --> 01:13:13,406
Hi-yah!

898
01:13:13,474 --> 01:13:14,907
Get over there!

899
01:13:34,695 --> 01:13:38,096
All right, giddap now!
Hyah! Giddap there now!

900
01:13:54,047 --> 01:13:56,447
[ Dunson ]
Straighten out that line!

901
01:13:59,419 --> 01:14:00,852
[ Dunson ]
Keep downstream!

902
01:14:11,832 --> 01:14:13,356
Keep them coming!

903
01:14:19,339 --> 01:14:21,967
Bedroll's right down there, Tom.

904
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:37,319
Have some coffee, Tom?

905
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:38,949
Picked up a few.

906
01:14:40,093 --> 01:14:42,755
We just picked up
a few strays downstream.

907
01:14:42,829 --> 01:14:46,424
All told,
we lost 30 to 40 head.

908
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,937
Better than 9,000 head across in less
than 4 hours. That's awful good, Tom.

909
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:53,131
- Boys did all right.
- Yep.

910
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:55,174
Why don't you tell them so?

911
01:14:57,344 --> 01:14:59,938
That's their job.

912
01:15:00,013 --> 01:15:02,481
They're awful tired.

913
01:15:02,549 --> 01:15:05,051
We won't have to count noses
in the morning.

914
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,487
- That leg bothering you?
- Yeah.

915
01:15:13,559 --> 01:15:15,754
I hooked it on a horn.
It opened up a little.

916
01:15:15,828 --> 01:15:17,819
- I'll take a look at it.
- Wait till morning.

917
01:15:22,635 --> 01:15:26,127
You need sleep, Tom.
You need it bad.

918
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,439
Some nights ago
we lost three men.

919
01:15:30,509 --> 01:15:33,672
I haven't slept since,
and we haven't lost any more.

920
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:36,476
We're not gonna lose any tonight
nor from now on.

921
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:51,059
Why'd we have to cross today? Wouldn't
tomorrow have been just as good?

922
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,621
Dunson's orders. Ask him.

923
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:57,726
We could have waited till morning
instead of finishing after dark.

924
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,398
It don't make sense.
We got a long way to go yet.

925
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:04,136
He's getting worse every day.

926
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:07,976
Sometimes I think he's going
plumb out of his head.

927
01:16:08,047 --> 01:16:12,746
Why tell me? If you feel that way,
what do you tell me for?

928
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,616
l-- I'm sorry. l--

929
01:16:16,722 --> 01:16:18,952
Here.

930
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:21,322
You know, Matt,
things ain't right.

931
01:16:21,393 --> 01:16:25,853
It's him. He's got to get some sleep.
If he don't, something's gonna happen.

932
01:16:25,931 --> 01:16:31,665
All the sleep he's had in the last three
nights wouldn't fill a mouse's ear.

933
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:34,069
He won't sleep until--

934
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,131
Yeah.

935
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:40,941
When do you expect Cherry back,
if he comes?

936
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,140
Tomorrow sometime.

937
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,423
[ Cowboy Whooping ]

938
01:16:57,096 --> 01:16:58,495
[ Irishman ]
Looks like Cherry.

939
01:17:12,244 --> 01:17:14,178
Hyah! Hyah!

940
01:17:25,157 --> 01:17:29,025
Get down off them horses. I don't
favor looking up to the likes of you.

941
01:17:32,831 --> 01:17:36,562
That's better.
You should be crawling.

942
01:17:36,635 --> 01:17:40,162
Cherry, I sent you out after
three of them. You brought back two.

943
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,640
Bill Kelsey figured he'd rather fight.
Made a good one of it for a while.

944
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:46,678
Hmm. Laredo, Teeler...

945
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:50,112
you signed on for the drive,
and you signed on to finish it.

946
01:17:50,182 --> 01:17:53,640
- That's right--
- You stole beans, flour and cartridges.

947
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:56,882
Besides being deserters,
you're common thieves.

948
01:17:56,956 --> 01:17:59,186
- The law might see it different.
- I'm the law. You're a thief!

949
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:03,294
You too, Teeler.
Anything more?

950
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:06,695
I know what you're gonna do to us,
but first I want to tell you something.

951
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,630
- Go ahead.
- You're crazy.

952
01:18:08,701 --> 01:18:12,228
You've been drinking and not sleeping.
If you ain't crazy, you're close.

953
01:18:12,304 --> 01:18:13,999
- You through?
- No.

954
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:17,702
You want to get this herd to market.
So do all of us!

955
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:19,903
There's a good way to Abilene,
but you won't listen to that.

956
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:23,881
You want to drive them to Missouri,
when you got everything against you.

957
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,417
I ain't through yet.

958
01:18:26,485 --> 01:18:28,419
This herd don't belong to you.

959
01:18:28,487 --> 01:18:31,684
It belongs to every poor, hoping
and praying cattleman in the state.

960
01:18:32,992 --> 01:18:36,519
I shouldn't have run away. I should
have stayed and put a bullet in you.

961
01:18:36,595 --> 01:18:39,530
I signed a pledge, sure,
but you ain't the man I signed it with.

962
01:18:39,598 --> 01:18:41,532
- You finished?
- Yeah.

963
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,832
Now you can get your Bible
and read over us after you shoot us.

964
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:48,830
I'm gonna hang you.

965
01:18:51,277 --> 01:18:54,246
No. No, you're not.

966
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,407
- What?
- You're not going to hang them.

967
01:18:59,218 --> 01:19:00,515
Who'll stop me?

968
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,919
I will.

969
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:42,521
Give me that gun.
Somebody give me--

970
01:19:42,594 --> 01:19:44,221
I'll kill him! Let me go!

971
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:47,197
He was gonna kill me.
He wasn't gonna give me a chance.

972
01:19:48,734 --> 01:19:50,531
Turn him loose.

973
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:54,299
Cherry, give me that gun.
Here's what you've been crying for.

974
01:19:55,174 --> 01:19:57,108
All right. Use it!

975
01:19:57,176 --> 01:19:59,110
Go on.
You got what you wanted.

976
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:03,114
What are you waiting for? If you don't
want to live, all you have to do is--

977
01:20:12,858 --> 01:20:15,656
You're a lucky man, Teeler.

978
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,925
That's how close it came.

979
01:20:19,998 --> 01:20:21,932
Matt, we're getting
as crazy as he is.

980
01:20:26,472 --> 01:20:30,169
Keep it.
You want to finish the drive?

981
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,504
- Where we going?
- Abilene.

982
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,511
- Who's heading it?
- [ Matt ] I am.

983
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,513
What about Dunson?

984
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,278
He stays here.

985
01:20:40,352 --> 01:20:41,614
We're taking the herd.

986
01:20:42,955 --> 01:20:44,980
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm with you, Matt.

987
01:20:45,057 --> 01:20:46,957

01:34:35,851 --> 01:34:38,046
I probably am. I'm no good.

1151

Stop wasting powder.
Load for me. Keep down.

1152
01:34:46,561 --> 01:34:48,222
What are you so mad about?

1153
01:34:54,069 --> 01:34:56,765
I asked you why you're angry.

1154
01:34:56,838 --> 01:34:58,772
Is it because--

1155
01:35:00,776 --> 01:35:02,903
Is it because
some of your men might--

1156
01:35:03,812 --> 01:35:06,042
might get hurt or killed maybe?

1157
01:35:06,114 --> 01:35:09,515
Why don't you stop
talking and load--

1158
01:35:09,584 --> 01:35:12,485
That's fine.
Thought I told you to stay down.

1159
01:35:12,554 --> 01:35:14,215
- You did.
- Why didn't you?

1160
01:35:14,289 --> 01:35:16,348
'Cause I got up.

1161
01:35:16,425 --> 01:35:19,360
Not so bad. Hold still.

1162
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:25,928
- All right. It's free.
- Here they come, Matt!

1163
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:35,271
You'll have to wait.
Ma'am. Ma'am, over here.

1164
01:35:35,343 --> 01:35:38,278
Watch her, will you?
See she doesn't move until I get back.

1165
01:35:57,165 --> 01:36:00,100
All right, thanks.
Leave the cloth, will you?

1166
01:36:00,168 --> 01:36:02,261
I'm going to have
to cut your dress away.

1167
01:36:02,337 --> 01:36:04,601
- That shouldn't bother you.
- It doesn't.

1168
01:36:04,673 --> 01:36:07,335
I asked you before
why you were so mad.

1169
01:36:07,409 --> 01:36:12,676
Is it because your cattle-- the cattle
Cherry told me about-- might run off?

1170
01:36:12,747 --> 01:36:17,548
Or maybe you don't like the idea
of helping a bunch of--

1171
01:36:17,619 --> 01:36:19,610
A bunch of what?

1172
01:36:19,688 --> 01:36:21,656
That's what
I thought you thought.

1173
01:36:21,723 --> 01:36:23,190
This is going to hurt.

1174
01:36:23,258 --> 01:36:25,726

more than it does me.

1175

No, this will hurt you.

01:36:31,233 --> 01:36:33,997
You were right. It did.

- I hope not.

At least not until I've done something
I've been wanting to do.

I said we were lucky.

I don't know. I wasn't there.
What happened?

1197
01:38:10,932 --> 01:38:14,891
Took one look at me and made up
his mind I was one of a bunch of--

One look. That's all he took.

- Got mad. Wasn't any excuse. I just--
- Yeah.

Tell me why he did that.

Just what did you want to know?

1207
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:48,966
- Anything you can tell me, Groot.
- Why?

1208
01:38:49,037 --> 01:38:52,200
See, I met Matt today
just after he rode in.

1209

We didn't get along very well,
and I want to find out why.

01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,448
Wish it would rain.

1216
01:39:34,516 --> 01:39:37,417
He wouldn't pick you off
in the fog, Buster.

1217

I know it.

I ain't seen a thing

Yeah.

What would you do if you were me?

01:40:17,357 --> 01:40:19,587
If I was you? Huh!

Now, ain't that just like a woman?
I ain't you.

you'd get with a puss like mine?

- Morning, at the latest, we'll be gone.

want to talk to him.

That's the way I want it.

You're shaking.
You thought I was Dunson.

I know a little bit about it.
Groot told me.

1242

It's funny. I didn't imagine you
being scared. It doesn't seem to fit.

- It fits.
- I guess it does.

- It makes things clearer. It helps.
- Helps what?

I want to know more about him.
Why does he think that way?

1258
01:42:51,344 --> 01:42:54,040
Because he got to a place where--

1259
01:42:54,114 --> 01:42:56,947
See, he'd taken empty land
used for nothing...

1260

what he'd been after for so long...

1265
01:43:11,865 --> 01:43:13,799
it wasn't worth anything.

have got as far as we did.

- No, I don't suppose we could.

01:46:42,275 --> 01:46:43,867
We'll feed you.

1309
01:46:43,943 --> 01:46:46,275
- Well, thanks, l--
- I'll take care of Mr. Dunson.

1310
01:46:49,949 --> 01:46:53,043
- You two boys--
- A couple of you come with me.

1311
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:57,579
- Two of you boys follow me.
- Couple of you come with me.

1312
01:47:03,730 --> 01:47:08,190
- How did you know my name?
- We can talk about that later.

1313
01:47:08,267 --> 01:47:09,700
Sit down.

1314
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:18,704
I believe it's your beef
we're eating.

1315
01:47:18,778 --> 01:47:22,373
- Who told you that?
- The man you promised to kill.

1316
01:47:22,448 --> 01:47:23,881
He tell you that too?

1317
01:47:25,084 --> 01:47:29,817
You're tired, aren't you? Tired,
hungry and just a little bit irritable.

1318
01:47:29,889 --> 01:47:34,883
You'll feel better after you eat.
We'll talk then.

1319
01:47:34,961 --> 01:47:39,057
- How'd you get that away from him?
- I stole it.

1320
01:48:01,154 --> 01:48:03,816
So you stole that bracelet.

1321
01:48:03,890 --> 01:48:07,291
- How did you get it?
- Would you really like to know?

1322
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:11,126
- How did you get it?
- I got it in the rain...

1323
01:48:11,197 --> 01:48:13,131
eight days ago...

1324
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:16,362
before he took your herd
across that river and left.

1325
01:48:16,436 --> 01:48:18,131
I'm wondering
whether to believe you.

1326
01:48:18,204 --> 01:48:21,332
- I don't care whether you do or not.
- I believe that.

1327
01:48:21,407 --> 01:48:23,040
- Want to hear more?
- Go ahead.

1328
01:48:23,173 --> 01:48:27,109
It was raining. If it hadn't rained,
I wouldn't be here talking to you.

1329
01:48:27,177 --> 01:48:29,202
He wouldn't be where
you could find him to kill him.

1330
01:48:31,882 --> 01:48:34,851
- Still intend to kill him, don't you?
- Nothing you can say or do--

1331
01:48:34,918 --> 01:48:37,819
I didn't say anything.

1332
01:48:39,122 --> 01:48:41,056
I'll get you another drink.

1333
01:48:44,494 --> 01:48:47,361
So he went off and left you.

1334
01:48:48,432 --> 01:48:51,959
I didn't give him that much credit.

1335
01:48:53,270 --> 01:48:56,728
- You in love with him?
- I thought you'd ask that.

1336
01:48:56,807 --> 01:48:59,071
Can a woman love a man
who'd go off and leave her?

1337
01:48:59,142 --> 01:49:02,236
Well, she--
She shouldn't.

1338
01:49:02,312 --> 01:49:04,576
I wanted to go with him,
but he had work to do.

1339
01:49:04,648 --> 01:49:09,210
He had to get your cattle to market.
Said I wasn't strong enough to go.

1340
01:49:09,286 --> 01:49:11,914
Nothing I could do or say
would change his mind.

1341
01:49:13,857 --> 01:49:16,155
But I wanted to go with him.

1342
01:49:17,227 --> 01:49:19,695
I wanted him so much that--

1343
01:49:19,763 --> 01:49:24,359
That you felt like
you had knives sticking in you.

1344
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:28,804
How did you know that?

1345
01:49:31,274 --> 01:49:33,902
I suppose other people
have felt that way before.

1346
01:49:33,977 --> 01:49:36,810
- I have.
- Tell me something, Mr. Dunson.

1347
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,871
- What?
- Why do you want to kill him?

1348
01:49:38,949 --> 01:49:41,941
- Because he's a thief.
- Do you think he thinks that?

1349
01:49:42,018 --> 01:49:46,921
He should! I picked him up in the brush
leading a cow. That's 14 years ago.

1350
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:48,958
Taught him all I could.

1351
01:49:49,025 --> 01:49:51,084
He knew what I was planning,
saw what I was building.

1352
01:49:52,262 --> 01:49:54,594
He knew that someday
it would all be his.

1353
01:49:54,664 --> 01:49:57,929
His land, his cattle.
The whole thing.

1354
01:49:58,001 --> 01:50:01,664
Even talked of a woman,
as men will talk.

1355
01:50:01,738 --> 01:50:06,903
A strong woman who could bear him sons.
A woman like you.

1356
01:50:06,977 --> 01:50:09,969
- Why did you want him to have a son?
- Because I'd built something.

1357
01:50:10,046 --> 01:50:14,142
Built it with my owns hands,
and I can't live forever.

1358
01:50:14,217 --> 01:50:16,651

what would you say if--

1370
01:50:59,029 --> 01:51:01,497
if I offered you
half of everything I own for a son?

1371
01:51:01,565 --> 01:51:04,796
- Your son?
- You can have a son, can't you?

- I thought so.

When did you--

1379
01:51:26,554 --> 01:51:30,115
- Did you really hurt that arm?
- I hurt it. It's almost well.

You can take that gun
out of the sling now.

Now, when did you
fall in love with him?

1383
01:51:48,309 --> 01:51:51,244
It was under a wagon.
Six inches of mud.

1385
01:51:53,214 --> 01:51:55,148
- What?
- When did you fall in love with her?

- You told me.

You knew how I felt
when he left me.

1390
01:52:05,293 --> 01:52:08,228
She must have felt the same way
when you left her.

1391
01:52:08,296 --> 01:52:12,232
That's right, isn't it?
Well, can't you remember?

1392

I hope so, because--

01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:22,107
Because I want you to think about her
while I ask you something.

- What?

- That won't do any good.

- But if it ain't?

01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:48,657
Oh, Pete!

1472
01:58:48,729 --> 01:58:50,788
You stay here.

1473
01:58:50,864 --> 01:58:54,425
Anything those boys want out there,
you give it to them.

1474
01:58:54,501 --> 01:58:56,128
Buster.

1475
01:58:57,104 --> 01:58:59,538
- Cherry, watch things, will you?
- Sure.

1476
01:59:02,276 --> 01:59:04,039
Come on in, boys.

1477
01:59:08,649 --> 01:59:10,241
What's the matter?

1478
01:59:10,317 --> 01:59:12,945
The roof is funny. We haven't been
under one in three months.

1479
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:14,988
[ Laughing ]
Sit down.

1480
01:59:15,055 --> 01:59:17,319
Let's talk a little business.

1481
01:59:17,391 --> 01:59:20,417
Mr. Garth, I'm--
Say, what is your first name?

1482
01:59:20,494 --> 01:59:21,794
- Matthew.
- Matt.

1483
01:59:21,794 --> 01:59:23,227
- Matthew.
- Matt.

1484
01:59:23,295 --> 01:59:26,321
I'm the Greenwood Trading Company
of Illinois.

1485
01:59:26,398 --> 01:59:28,229
I'd like to buy your beef.

1486
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:30,063
That's why we came.

1487
01:59:30,135 --> 01:59:32,365
- How many you got?
- I don't know exactly.

1488
01:59:32,437 --> 01:59:34,928
We started out with
well over 9,000.

1489
01:59:35,007 --> 01:59:36,269
Man alive!

1490
01:59:36,341 --> 01:59:38,332
We've lost 600 or 700 on the way.

1491
01:59:38,410 --> 01:59:41,504
We won't have them all in here
till 8:00 or 9:00 tonight.

1492
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:43,673
We haven't got corrals enough
for half that number.

1493
01:59:43,749 --> 01:59:45,341
We could leave them
in the streets.

1494
01:59:45,417 --> 01:59:48,011
They're good and tired.
They should stay where they're put.

1495
01:59:48,086 --> 01:59:50,577
Sure, that'd be all right.
What's your price?

1496
01:59:52,624 --> 01:59:54,387
Well, uh--

1497
01:59:54,459 --> 01:59:56,893
I'm kind of new at this.

1498
01:59:56,962 --> 01:59:58,691
Would you make me an offer?

1499
02:00:00,098 --> 02:00:01,690
All right, 20 dollars.

1500
02:00:01,767 --> 02:00:04,463
You-- A head?

1501
02:00:07,406 --> 02:00:09,704
Twenty dollars a head.

1502
02:00:09,775 --> 02:00:11,072
Well, uh--

1503
02:00:11,143 --> 02:00:15,409
How can a man deal with someone
who's done what you've done?

1504
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:18,142
I'll give you top price
that anyone else offers...

1505
02:00:18,217 --> 02:00:20,777
for a lot of 500,
and I'll take the whole herd.

1506
02:00:23,322 --> 02:00:26,291
Looks like you're gonna buy yourself
a lot of beef, Mr. Melville.

1507
02:00:26,358 --> 02:00:29,657
If that engineer was here,
I'd get him to blow his whistle again.

1508
02:00:29,728 --> 02:00:32,959
All right. I'll draw up a contract
and have it ready tonight.

1509
02:00:33,031 --> 02:00:35,966
Buster and I'll ask around and find out
what you're going to have to pay.

1510
02:00:36,034 --> 02:00:37,797
We'll be back in a couple hours.

1511
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:40,566
You need anything else?
Need some cash?

1512
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,233
I sure could use some.
I'd like to pay off the men.

1513
02:00:43,308 --> 02:00:46,004
All right. It'll be ready
and waiting for you tonight.

1514
02:00:46,078 --> 02:00:47,841
All right.
Thanks, Mr. Melville.

1515
02:00:47,913 --> 02:00:50,177
- So long.
- So long.

1516
02:01:07,065 --> 02:01:11,161
They crossed here, all right.
Not over four or five hours ahead.

1517
02:01:44,403 --> 02:01:45,995
Here you are, Matt.

1518
02:01:46,071 --> 02:01:48,130
You'll have to sign this.

1519
02:01:48,206 --> 02:01:51,141
This is a check
to Thomas Dunson for $50,000.

1520
02:01:51,209 --> 02:01:54,770
The rest will be paid when
the tally's finished at $21 a head.

1521
02:01:54,846 --> 02:01:56,780
You see, I've taken
a credit here for...

1522
02:01:56,848 --> 02:01:59,476
the money you wanted
to pay off your men.

1523
02:01:59,551 --> 02:02:01,348
I suppose--

1524
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:03,445
I suppose they'll be celebrating.

1525
02:02:03,522 --> 02:02:06,184
- They've got a right to.
- Of course they have.

1526
02:02:06,258 --> 02:02:10,194
There's three times in a man's life
when he can yell at the moon.

1527
02:02:10,262 --> 02:02:13,425
When he marries,
when his children come...

1528
02:02:13,498 --> 02:02:14,795
and...

1529
02:02:14,866 --> 02:02:17,528
and when he finishes a job
he had to be crazy to start.

1530
02:02:19,538 --> 02:02:21,529
Well, when do you expect
to be leaving, Matt?

1531
02:02:21,606 --> 02:02:23,164
I don't exactly know.

1532
02:02:24,443 --> 02:02:26,843
You're gonna wait
for Dunson, huh?

1533
02:02:26,912 --> 02:02:29,676
I've been talking
to some of your men.

1534
02:02:29,748 --> 02:02:32,740
Isn't that check
and the fact that you got here--

1535
02:02:32,818 --> 02:02:34,752
Isn't that gonna make
any difference?

1536
02:02:36,588 --> 02:02:38,351
I don't think so, Mr. Melville.

1537
02:02:38,423 --> 02:02:40,015
I suppose I'm crazy, but--

1538
02:02:40,092 --> 02:02:43,255
- You want me to run away?
- No.

1539
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,761
Of course not.

1540
02:02:49,034 --> 02:02:50,296
Couldn't--

1541
02:02:50,369 --> 02:02:52,894
Couldn't I talk to him?

1542
02:02:52,971 --> 02:02:55,064
I'd still have to talk
to him after that.

1543
02:02:57,776 --> 02:02:59,368
Good night, Mr. Melville.

1544
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:04,313
- Get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah, I could use some.

1545
02:03:04,383 --> 02:03:05,975
Good night.

1546
02:03:11,757 --> 02:03:14,317
- Evening, Mr. Melville.
- Evening.

1547
02:03:19,431 --> 02:03:22,594
Well, work's not done yet, huh?

1548
02:03:22,667 --> 02:03:24,294
No, sir.

1549
02:03:24,369 --> 02:03:26,860
Well, you fellas see
you get her done.

1550
02:03:26,938 --> 02:03:28,735
I like that boy too.

1551
02:03:33,512 --> 02:03:35,776
I'll buy the drinks
when it's over.

1552
02:04:09,815 --> 02:04:12,443
He's camped two or three miles
outside of town.

1553
02:04:12,517 --> 02:04:14,280
He says he'll be here
just after sunup.

1554
02:04:15,187 --> 02:04:17,121
He says he's going to kill you.

1555
02:04:22,928 --> 02:04:24,862
What's the matter?
Is something--

1556
02:04:26,465 --> 02:04:28,057
I must look
like I'm in mourning.

1557
02:04:28,133 --> 02:04:30,601
I didn't mean it that way,
or I wouldn't have--

1558
02:04:33,138 --> 02:04:34,400
No, Matthew.

1559
02:04:34,473 --> 02:04:36,407
I know you've only
a few hours, but--

1560
02:04:36,475 --> 02:04:38,705
but listen for just a minute,
that's all.

1561
02:04:38,777 --> 02:04:42,406
Then I won't talk about it anymore.
Just a minute.

1562
02:04:42,481 --> 02:04:44,415
He hasn't changed
his mind, Matthew.

1563
02:04:44,483 --> 02:04:46,917
- I didn't think he would.
- We saw the railroad, and I thought--

1564
02:04:46,985 --> 02:04:49,249
I thought it might make a difference,
but it didn't.

1565
02:04:49,321 --> 02:04:52,256
Nothing would.
He's like something you can't move.

1566
02:04:52,324 --> 02:04:55,760
Even I've gotten to believe
it's got to happen, your meeting.

1567
02:04:55,827 --> 02:04:57,852
I was going to ask you to run, but--

1568
02:04:57,929 --> 02:05:00,557
No, I'm not. I'm not!
It wouldn't do any good.

1569
02:05:00,632 --> 02:05:02,691
You're too much like him.

1570
02:05:02,767 --> 02:05:04,894
Oh, stop me, Matthew.
Stop me--

1571
02:05:09,007 --> 02:05:10,770
God bless you, Matthew.

1572
02:05:45,210 --> 02:05:47,144
- [ Matt ] Morning.
- [ Men ] Morning.

1573
02:05:49,614 --> 02:05:51,206
Got a match, Walt?

1574
02:06:23,915 --> 02:06:26,406
I told you all
where you stand in this.

1575
02:06:28,486 --> 02:06:30,420
See that you remember it.

1576
02:06:50,175 --> 02:06:52,166
[ Whooping ]

1577
02:06:56,748 --> 02:06:58,215
Hey!

1578
02:07:04,623 --> 02:07:06,284
He's got plenty with him.

1579
02:07:06,358 --> 02:07:08,121
- How many?
- Oh, ten or twelve.

1580
02:07:08,193 --> 02:07:10,457
- I'll be telling Matt.
- Right.

1581
02:07:25,909 --> 02:07:29,140
He's coming in now.
Got about ten with him.

1582
02:08:51,161 --> 02:08:54,995
You know that young man isn't
going to use his gun, don't you?

1583
02:08:55,065 --> 02:08:56,327
Yeah.

1584
02:08:57,734 --> 02:08:59,793
But I haven't any such notion.

1585
02:09:03,473 --> 02:09:04,906
Mr. Dunson.

1586
02:09:05,976 --> 02:09:08,570
Mr. Dunson.
I'll say it just one more time.

1587
02:09:29,499 --> 02:09:30,761
Go on. Draw.

1588
02:09:34,104 --> 02:09:35,571
I said, "Draw."

1589
02:09:41,878 --> 02:09:43,470
Then I'll make you.

1590
02:09:56,826 --> 02:09:58,691
You're soft!

1591
02:09:58,762 --> 02:10:01,697
Won't anything make
a man out of you?

1592
02:10:01,765 --> 02:10:04,859
You once told me never to take
your gun away from you.

1593
02:10:06,736 --> 02:10:09,227
You yellow-bellied,
chicken-livered--

1594
02:10:23,553 --> 02:10:25,145
All right!

1595
02:10:25,221 --> 02:10:27,815
For 14 years I've been scared,
but it's gonna be all right.

1596
02:10:31,127 --> 02:10:33,322
Get up.
Come on. Get up!

1597
02:10:52,882 --> 02:10:54,577
Stop it!

1598
02:10:54,651 --> 02:10:56,209
Stop making a holy--

1599
02:10:56,286 --> 02:10:59,517
"Stop it," I said! I'm mad,
good and mad, and who wouldn't be?

1600
02:10:59,589 --> 02:11:01,716
You, Dunson, pretending
you're going to kill him!

1601
02:11:01,791 --> 02:11:03,383
It's the last thing
in the world--

1602
02:11:03,460 --> 02:11:05,394
Stay still!
I'm mad, I told you.

1603
02:11:05,462 --> 02:11:06,554
And you, Matthew Garth.

1604
02:11:06,629 --> 02:11:09,723
Getting your face all beat up
and all bloody!

1605
02:11:09,799 --> 02:11:12,029
You ought to see
how silly you look.

1606
02:11:12,102 --> 02:11:15,037
Like something the cat dragged--
Stay still!

1607
02:11:15,105 --> 02:11:16,970
What a fool I've been.

1608
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:18,803
Expecting trouble
for days when...

1609
02:11:18,875 --> 02:11:21,605
anybody with half a mind would know
you two love each other.

1610
02:11:21,678 --> 02:11:23,908
It took somebody else to shoot you.
He wouldn't do it.

1611
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:26,847
- Are you hurt?
- No, just nicked the fat.

1612
02:11:26,916 --> 02:11:29,146
Then stay still!
No, don't stay still.

1613
02:11:29,219 --> 02:11:32,211
I changed my mind.
Go ahead. Beat each other crazy.

1614
02:11:32,288 --> 02:11:34,222
Maybe it'll put some sense
in both of you.

1615
02:11:34,290 --> 02:11:36,053
Go ahead! Go on! Do it!

1616
02:11:36,126 --> 02:11:38,321
Use this.
Oh, you can't. It's his.

1617
02:11:43,099 --> 02:11:45,158
You'd better marry
that girl, Matt.

1618
02:11:45,235 --> 02:11:47,430
Yeah, I think I'd--

1619
02:11:47,504 --> 02:11:50,439
When are you going to stop
telling people what to do?

1620
02:11:53,309 --> 02:11:56,301
Right now.
At least as soon as--

1621
02:11:56,379 --> 02:11:57,812
When?

1622
02:11:57,881 --> 02:11:59,815
As soon as I tell you
one thing more.

1623
02:11:59,883 --> 02:12:01,441
What?

1624
02:12:01,518 --> 02:12:05,079
When we get back to the ranch,
I want you to change the brand.

1625
02:12:05,155 --> 02:12:06,588
It'll be like this.

1626
02:12:07,857 --> 02:12:10,621
Red River D...

1627
02:12:10,693 --> 02:12:13,025
and we'll add an M to it.

1628
02:12:14,397 --> 02:12:16,092
You don't mind that, do you?

1629
02:12:17,333 --> 02:12:18,595
No.

1630
02:12:23,206 --> 02:12:24,833
You've earned it.
