You promised to come play with me

29
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,900
I need to study

30
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,900
You are not studying

31
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,900
It's an English magazine

32
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,000

He is a famous Italian aircraft designer. His name is Caproni, seems he is a count

35
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,000

36
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,500

37
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000

38
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,100
Please be quiet..

39
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,000
Jiro, What are you doing here?

40
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Kayo, you should not have come here

41
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,800
You are not wearing your glasses

42
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,000
I am looking at the stars without it. looking something far is good for the eyes

43
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
You will be scolded by mom

44
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
A falling star!

45
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
There's one more!

46
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's beautiful

47
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,000
There's one over there

48
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Over there too!

49
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
I am a Japanese boy

50
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It is supposed to be a dream! I think this is my dream.

51
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,000
Maybe we're in my dream

52
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
we are also in my dream

53
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
In your dream? we are together in each dreams?

54
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,800
It's mysterious , you are Count Caproni Earl right?

55
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,700
I am very glad to be able to meet you

56
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's interesting, probably this is not a dream, this world is a dream

57
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,900
Welcome to my kingdom

58
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
I am greatly honored

59
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Look

60
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They are going to bomb the city of the enemy , half of them won't be able to come back

61
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the war is going to end very soon

62
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,700
Come up here you Japanese kid

63
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,400
When the war ends, I am going to make this thing

64
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,800
Don't you think it's geat?

65
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
take off

66
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,200
this will carry passengers instead of bombs

67
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,900
If there's something like this, it would be easy to dream

68
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We can go wherever we want

69
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Come over here! just walk along the bracket

70
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Look

71
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,100
Isn't it beautiful?

72
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes it's magnificent!

73
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,400
It will carry 100 passengers and cross the Atlantic ocean

74
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,300
Mr. Caproni, I have a question

75
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,600
If you are nearsighted, can you design aircrafts?

76
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,700
For me I wont be able to fly planes because I am nearsighted

77
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,600
Listen to me kid, I don't fly planes
or should I say I can't fly planes

78
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,700
There are lots of people who want to fly planes

79
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,000
but I am a person who make airplanes!

80
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,000
Cool!

81
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,400
Listen to me kid, aircrafts are not weapons of war nor means of trade

82
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,900
It is a wonderful dream, aircraft designers will build this beautiful dream

83
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,000
Right!

84
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Well then goodbye!

85
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Hey Jiro, go to bed and rest.

86
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,700
You were having a dream right? As if you were responding to someone in a loud voice

87
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
Mom, I want to be an aircraft designer

88
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,100
That's a great ambition

89
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
That person told me, airplane is a wonderful dream

90
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,500
I want to build a wonderful airplane

91
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Madam, you can have the seat here, I'm going to move somewhere

92
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,000
you can sit now

93
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,400
It's really nice!

94
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Miss, your hat might be blown away

95
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,800
I'ts fine

96
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
watch out!

97
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,900
Are you OK

98
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm safe.
Are you OK

99
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,500
I'm safe.

100
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Nice catch!

101
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
Thank you !

102
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,000
"Le vent se leve"

103
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,000
il faut tenter de vivre

104
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
"Le vent se leve, il faut tenter de vivre ."

105
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,000
When the wind rises "you should look on the heart and mind"

106
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,330
Earthquake

107
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The engine will explode!

108
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,790
What happened

109
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,500
Her feet

110
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Let me take a look

111
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It Hurts

112
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,500
Stay strong

113
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,000
She broke her leg, she can't walk

114
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,600
run before the engine will explode!

115
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
That's silly. don' believe that.

116
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The engine won't explode

117
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,500
my trunk case

118
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,500
relax it

119
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,000
here we go

120
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,500
you can not walk

121
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Where do you live?

122
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,900
Ueno

123
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,500
I'll send you off

124
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,200
There's fire

125
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,400
Let's keep going

126
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
Your luggage?

127
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,800
It's okay

128
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
sorry, sorry

129
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,000
Does it hurt?
Hold on

130
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
Let's go

131
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,000
It is a new cloth so it's clean

132
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,400
open your mouth

133
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,800
The well just ran out of water

134
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,900
How about you?

135
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,700
yes please

136
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,500
The fire hasn't reach the main street

137
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm going to my former school, how about you two?

138
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,200
I'm going to call somebody from home

139
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,400
Let me go with you

140
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,400
Madam, can I leave my things with you

141
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
yes

142
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Don't worry, I'll definitely come back

143
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,900
Okay

144
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,000
please look out for my trunk

145
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,010
yes

146
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,000
Thank you so much!

147
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,200
You're welcome

148
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,500
What's your name by the way?

149
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,000
He is a good man

150
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,700
You're back Jiro! you're back on a devastating day

151
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,000
How's the aviation institute?

152
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,800
The area might be on fire

153
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,300
We already brought out most of the stuffs

154
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,200
Do you have a smoke?

155
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,800
This is huge, I even see a door flying

156
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The fire is spreading! Tokyo is burning

157
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,000
I really made it but the foundation is Mr Caproni's dream

158
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't shoot!

159
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
The wind direction has changed. Fire is coming here!

160
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,900
Hey Japanese boy! Is the wind still blowing

161
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,900
Yes, the strong wind is still blowing

162
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,900
you must keep going then
"Le vent se leve, il faut tenter de vivre"

163
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,500
Jiro, Let's go.

164
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,800
okay

165
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,300
still old fashioned. Nothing has changed

166
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,900
But seems they widened the street

167
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,900
Even those planes  still look the same

168
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,700
Welcome

169
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,000
Jiro you're eating saba again!

170
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,500
because they are delicious

171
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,500
It's already a habit, same as the lectures in school

172
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,000
Ms Kimi, can you bring me an egg?

173
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,800
got it

174
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,600
It has become an era of aluminum already

175
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,500
you should eat tofu and meat sometimes. We are behind a decade already

176
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,800
What is it

177
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,700
isn't it a work of art?

178
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,500
it has an impressive curve

179
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,600
Do you always look on the bones when you eat mackerel?

180
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
just eat faster, we'll go get coffee after

181
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,800
Jiro seems really well motivated

182
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,700
the mackerel bone inspired him

183
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Is Mr. Horikoshi back?

184
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,000
Jiro

185
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,300
Honjo I found out something

186
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,700
The bones of the fish is similar to that airfoil profile of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)

187
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,600
I just wonder if Americans eat mackerel

188
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,800
Jiro someone is looking for you

189
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,700
Yes?

190
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,500
A while ago, a young girl came and asked me to hand this to you.
you were out so I took it

191
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,800
Thank you very much

192
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,100
Jiro is it a valentines gift?

193
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,000
Do you have a cigarette? give me a stick

194
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,900
Jiro

195
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,600
Let him go

196
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,300
You're back

197
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm back

198
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,000
I led your visitor to your room. It's a girl

199
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,500
oh thanks

200
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,700
I hate you Jiro!

201
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,500
Oh Kayo! sorry, I totally forgot it.

202
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
--%!

203
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,900
How's mom?

204
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
she's at uncle's place

205
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,800
are you going to stay?

206
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,900
just for a night

207
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,300
Kayo you've grow a lot and  became prettier

208
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,400
Jiro, you don't care much! you never came home once

209
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,400
Oh it's getting late

210
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,000
I'll send you off, I am going to give my apologies

211
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,500
Let's go by steamboat

212
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You must like her so much right?

213
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,400
no way, It has been two years already

214
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,300
Do you know what happened to the girl you helped?

215
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,800
it's been two years ago. I went to see her once after the fire

216
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,900
The fire burned down the entire house.

217
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,000
I see

218
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
we're here

219
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Don't you feel cold?

220
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm fine

221
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,300
I never thought Tokyo would be revived

222
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,100
Can I live here with you ?

223
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,112
Dad won't allow me to go to Tokyo alone

224
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,390
at that time, maybe I will already be in Nagoya

225
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:40,990
On an aircraft company?
yes

226
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:46,863
Guys are lucky. I am going to a university and study medicine

227
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,200
So you want to be a doctor. I think it suits you

228
00:28:50,222 --> 00:28:51,113
Really? do you think so?

229
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:55,050
When I come back on New Year, I am going to talk to Dad

230
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:57,240
Thanks. I owe you.

231
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:03,023
Jiro

232
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,810
Hey you made it!

233
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:09,066
finally I'm here...      yeah finally

234
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:29,972
there's a lot going out of the city to do job hunting

235
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:31,624
I saw a lot of them on my way here.

236
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,434
some even sleep outdoors

237
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:39,195
there's commotion again

238
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:40,725
This time it's the kamehachi bank

239
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:47,396
Bankruptcy?

240
00:30:47,396 --> 00:30:48,450
Yes Yes

241
00:30:48,465 --> 00:30:51,423
There were some rumors

242
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,933
about the world recession

243
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:55,690
Our company might go into recession too

244
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:17,263
you came at a busy time, did you know what you came for

245
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:19,932
They said anytime on April will be good

246
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:22,423
despite you can show up on March

247
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:22,926
yes sir

248
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,433
I will let you join the team immediately

249
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:25,990
Yes sir

250
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:29,012
Did you prepare the data of the metal fittings?

251
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,572
yes sir

252
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:32,611
I'll let you do design, the engineering department seems to be less busy

253
00:31:32,611 --> 00:31:32,975
okay

254
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:38,180
You'll work here

255
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,741
Please wait for a while

256
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,540
Come here

257
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:55,501
You can use the table here, it is for imports so no one has been using it

258
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:55,930
thanks

259
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,642
datas here, hats there

260
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,470
Listen everybody, I introduce you our new member

261
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:06,473
he is the said genius who's gonna be joining our team for Hayabusa.
Introduce yourself

262
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,743
I'm Horikoshi. Pleasure to meet you all

263
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:09,943
familiarize yourself to work

264
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:10,834
Yes sir

265
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Hey Jiro

266
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,977
It' lunchtime. Let's go

267
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:49,785
oh, okay

268
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:51,858
Do you want to see the workshop?

269
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:53,600
yes I would like to take a look.

270
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:59,509
It's kinda strange.. people get chaotic to a newcomer who just arrived

271
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:00,880
Two lunches please

272
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,209
Good day, I have some favor to ask

273
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:06,951
oh, it's almost done

274
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,011
Sorry for bothering you on your rest time

275
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,971
No problem at all. I am happy to be visited by young designers

276
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,364
Honjou! It seems the metal fittings are already done

277
00:34:17,582 --> 00:34:22,754
I never thought a beginner like you can be reliable, I wonder who is  better among you

278
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:25,663
he seems to be a fruit of a hardworking mother

279
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:28,383
Come over here, I wanna show you something

280
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:30,322
I want to hear your opinion

281
00:34:36,062 --> 00:34:37,051
What do you think about this?

282
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:38,491
Seems to be a solid design

283
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:39,914
This part doesn't look good

284
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,885
Although the idea is the same.

285
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:43,524
That's not good

286
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,149
foreman, breaktime is over

287
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:47,000
be quiet

288
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,770
Airplanes are really interesting huh

289
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,348
yeah, we'll get late

290
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,120
I'm Hattori

291
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,741
This is Mr. Hattori, the director of the design department

292
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,391
Is this your first work?

293
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:12,810
It is a design of the metal fitting

294
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,991
it doesn't seem so

295
00:35:13,991 --> 00:35:14,380
oh

296
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:15,949
Please explain this one

297
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:16,639
sure sir

298
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,279
To increase the rigidity of the fitting, I used a leaf suspension on this part

299
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:26,875
The use of wire rope and stretchable cable, absorbs the pressure that can penetrate in the middle bracket of the skeleton

300
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,897
So the skeleton wont be deformed

301
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:32,000
Yes that's right

302
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,146
but I haven't calculated that yet
Yes that's right

303
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:33,746
but I haven't calculated that yet

304
00:35:34,147 --> 00:35:36,767
You are wasting time what is this crap you're doing?!

305
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:37,798
What happened to the work I gave you?

306
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:38,608
I already finished it

307
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,218
those are fine nice lines

308
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:52,378
perfect! you should submit as soon as you're done

309
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:53,329
got it

310
00:35:55,547 --> 00:35:57,537
Hey , I'm going home now

311
00:35:57,537 --> 00:35:58,956
I am going home now as well

312
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:01,377
How about your task given by Mr. Kurokawa?

313
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:02,286
It's done

314
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:08,388
There are cows here

315
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:15,277
They will carry the new aircrafts to the plant ,it takes 2 days for 3 kilometers.
that's the new rule

316
00:36:15,277 --> 00:36:17,088
I like cows

317
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:22,728
It's coming ! It's coming

318
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:28,501
Prepare to measure the time

319
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:31,101
here he come

320
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,851
No! Damn it!

321
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:46,671
Were you able to take it?

322
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:49,371
13.3 seconds around 270 km/hr

323
00:37:49,371 --> 00:37:50,230
that's slow!

324
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:54,700
It should fly high 15km high, mobility is too low, engine is not maximized

325
00:37:55,588 --> 00:37:57,600
Hey Mr. Black hat

326
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,401
Yes

327
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:00,641
Army officers are here

328
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:04,661
Good job! it was great.. very innovative design.

329
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,002
You' have a bunch of good people

330
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,400
He is driving speed of 400 km/hr!

331
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,060
it crashed!
the pilot!

332
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:10,300
Mr.Kurokawa, the collection of wreckage will be done when the rain stops

333
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,800
How's the pilot?

334
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,878
He's fine

335
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:13,859
thank god

336
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:18,289
Mr. Kurokawa, let's go back.
Let's go and start over again

337
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:22,528
Do you think the mid-air breakage is because of the metal fittings?

338
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:27,167
I don't think so. the problem might be deeper, broader or farther than we think

339
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:33,367
I have deep realizations today. I felt as if an endless road has opened in front of my eyes.

340
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:40,567
There's no more Hayabusa no.2. we already lost the army
they already took the other company.

341
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:45,300
This was the only chance we could have had.

342
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:52,685
Anyway our company is going to produce bomber planes for Junkers Company in Germany.

343
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:57,820
This is your chance to see Germany , I recommended you

344
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,820
Are you still open?

345
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,580
Oh you're back, you came late today

346
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,368
two Siberian cakes please

347
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,175
okay

348
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:47,348
here's your cake

349
00:40:48,457 --> 00:40:49,607
who are those kids?

350
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:57,407
The parents hasn't come yet. they always wait there, I am closing soon

351
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:59,278
I see, Thanks

352
00:40:59,278 --> 00:41:00,318
thank you for coming today

353
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:15,432
Hey Kids aren't you hungry? Eat this cake I just bought from the store

354
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:27,151
Take it

355
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:28,782
Let's go

356
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,839
are you home?

357
00:41:47,783 --> 00:41:51,819
Too bad, I heard the project has been terminated?

358
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,231
hmm?

359
00:41:53,231 --> 00:41:56,150
Siberia cake, you eat weird stuffs

360
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:12,710
did you expect that that girl would smile and thank you

361
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,829
No.   hmm maybe yeah

362
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:28,796
There are lots of hungry people on the street.
one metal fixture can feed that kids family the entire month

363
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:32,041
Why is this country so poor

364
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:32,782
Jiro

365
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:37,071
Do you know how much this engineering companies pay?

366
00:42:37,493 --> 00:42:45,962
That amount of money is enough to feed the kids in Japan everyday, they can eat rice and cakes. so I have no plan of wasting the chance given to me.

367
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:47,582
Are you going too Honjou?

368
00:42:47,582 --> 00:42:49,011
I've made up my mind just today

369
00:42:49,082 --> 00:42:50,953
That's great

370
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:57,831
Because this poor country want aircrafts, so let's make aircrafts!

371
00:42:58,831 --> 00:43:01,481
Tomorrow I am going to Tokyo, I'm gonna get married

372
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:02,681
Get married?

373
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:08,782
In order to be invited to this kind of work, one needs invitation. marriage is a contradiction.

374
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:44,360
Germans are so mean.

375
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,950
despite coming all the way here

376
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,217
they won't allow us on the plant

377
00:43:48,268 --> 00:43:49,919
There are no cows here

378
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,238
cause the field is just beside the plant

379
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:54,518
So wide

380
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:18,321
it's G38, who would buy this.

381
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:21,682
they will make bomber planes in Japan, at the governments expense

382
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:24,651
Where the heck the army is planning to go

383
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:27,301
In America. maybe better not to know

384
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:31,723
this plane is well made

385
00:44:31,723 --> 00:44:37,583
Isn't this awesome. there's a room that's converted into bomber's outlook on the wing.

386
00:44:37,753 --> 00:44:38,990
Who cares anyway

387
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,582
Take this opportunity to  learn about metal!

388
00:44:46,343 --> 00:44:50,013
they don't even show what's inside like it's supposed to be

389
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:18,561
It's beautiful

390
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:22,038
Hey Japanese, you are not allowed here!

391
00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:25,997
Hey you! do not lay hand on him

392
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:29,069
Is this how the Germans treat visitors!

393
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:33,299
Japanese will copy right away! It's Germany's property

394
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:34,100
Don't be too proud

395
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,729
We have a lot of this old fashion things in Japan!

396
00:45:36,729 --> 00:45:38,227
Honjou that's enough

397
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,462
We visited this plant to achieve technical expertise

398
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:47,363
There is reason why we joined this convention, there is unfairness to students based on the agreement

399
00:45:47,363 --> 00:45:48,700
There is no instruction from your boss

400
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,544
that we are not allowed to go near anywhere

401
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:55,960
There are no questions of you doing your job

402
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,093
but insulting us out of the content of the agreement is unforgivable

403
00:46:01,353 --> 00:46:05,693
We were ordered to look after for Japanese who wanders around

404
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,690
come here

405
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:24,481
It's Dr. Hugo Junkers

406
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,061
Yeah, a very fine man

407
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:31,681
Dr. Junkers gave his permission. I will guide you around

408
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:46,222
I never thought we can even ride it

409
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,011
It is shaky more than I expected

410
00:46:49,024 --> 00:46:51,543
They seem very excited

411
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:54,569
Excuse guys, the army wants to try too

412
00:46:58,877 --> 00:47:00,088
it's your turn

413
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:02,527
This aircraft is really good

414
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:06,990
There are channels inside the wings

415
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:10,947
this is awesome

416
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,358
if possibel inside the plant

417
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:22,100
Good Day! we are permitted here as researchers

418
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,758
please show us your work

419
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:26,610
This is the engineers position

420
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,356
This is a great airplane

421
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,919
Japanese, you can not go any further

422
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:36,700
got it bro! this is great

423
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,063
this is great

424
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,954
I agree

425
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,770
This is Germany's crystallization industrial technology

426
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:17,158
Dr Hugo is great, but their company who is very tight

427
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:20,807
Jiro do you have smoke?

428
00:48:22,328 --> 00:48:23,307
Jiro

429
00:48:25,357 --> 00:48:26,259
have some smoke?

430
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:28,329
I ran out

431
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:48,063
It seems pretty cold outside, good that it's warm in here

432
00:48:48,815 --> 00:48:51,550
I though all people are warm here like this heater

433
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:56,280
maybe this is Dr. Junkers same as the airplane today, don't you think so?

434
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:56,780
It's great

435
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,690
enough of it.. I get it.

436
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,700
They say we have no foundation of our technology

437
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,050
a warm bath and a table with heater is fine

438
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,056
airplane and table with heater doesn't match

439
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:10,900
the data we got today is indeed wonderful

440
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,140
only the good and strong points are written

441
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,094
"The technology is Germany's property"

442
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:21,330
Honjou, I think airplanes and table with heater are related

443
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,173
wood and metal might not be

444
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:29,183
With that it's too late, we are already 2 decades behind

445
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:34,960
Let's go for a walk.

446
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,980
I need to calm my mind.

447
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:50,044
we are the Achilles chasing a turtle ahead 2 decades from us

448
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,000
catching up to a 20 years gap for 5 years

449
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,530
the turtle is 5 years ahead, we're gonna chase that 5 years in 1 year

450
00:49:57,826 --> 00:50:00,845
that would be an endless chase

451
00:50:01,146 --> 00:50:02,600
Now we can only do so there is always a catch even one day overtake

452
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,365
someday we will able to reach and overtake it

453
00:50:05,918 --> 00:50:09,679
i wonder if there could be shorter roads for a turtle

454
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,700
What is it?

455
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:21,820
I hear a phonograph

456
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:30,718
Winterreise song. it pictures our journey

457
00:50:52,527 --> 00:50:53,406
What was that?

458
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:55,687
It looks like the person from the hangar

459
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:58,033
Jiro, I finished bathing. it's your turn

460
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,190
he's fallen asleep

461
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,110
The Japanese engineer who bears alone the fate of our aircraft

462
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,000
come in

463
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,900
it's fine here

464
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,500
There was a telegram from the company, It was decided that few will stay and rest should go home

465
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,450
Honjou, you stay.

466
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,700
while Jirou will go to the west

467
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,600
to the West?

468
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,500
He was called to see the world

469
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,982
He is traveling alone?

470
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:53,700
Mr. Caproni

471
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,889
Is the wind still blowing?

472
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,599
yes. still blowing

473
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,800
come join me, to my retirement airplane

474
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,820
come with me

475
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,110
you are going to retire?

476
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,880
fly high

477
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,319
fly!

478
00:53:22,278 --> 00:53:25,720
Hurry up! We are about to get going!

479
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:30,300
there is plenty of time to go up. come fast!

480
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:30,750
okay!

481
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,750
can you please close it

482
00:53:40,906 --> 00:53:43,607
Let's Fly

483
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,400
They are all relatives of  my workers

484
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,336
the entire village

485
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,850
tokyo village is a secret

486
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:03,053
because their product are bombs

487
00:54:06,854 --> 00:54:08,303
What do you think?

488
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,372
It's amazing!

489
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,814
it looks like the Roman buildings

490
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,500
well there is no need to bluff pair with Tokyo

491
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,700
authorities do not need to fight extensively

492
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,900
In fact, my country is very poor

493
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:25,503
Our technology can't even make this

494
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,492
getting closer to it is most important

495
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,800
sense will come first

496
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,611
then technology will go after

497
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,260
That's my family

498
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:42,612
In fact, my country is also poor
there are too many kids

499
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:51,292
Hoi! Do not get too excited ! we'll fall!

500
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:53,000
Come

501
00:54:56,715 --> 00:54:58,120
Watch your head

502
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,655
Even in dreams, do not hit your head

503
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,347
Which do you prefer, a world with a pyramid or none?

504
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,000
pyramid?

505
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,880
There is a haunting dream on the dream of flying

506
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,400
Airplanes are weapons of mass and destruction

507
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,498
so it is burden of your fate

508
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:27,358
i see

509
00:55:27,818 --> 00:55:31,900
Even for me, I chose the world with pyramid

510
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,447
So which one do you choose?

511
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,000
I want to build a magnificent airplane

512
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,916
are you referring to that one?

513
00:55:54,527 --> 00:55:56,500
It looks great

514
00:55:57,637 --> 00:56:00,637
the engine and cockpit has not been made yet

515
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,357
What a beautiful dream

516
00:56:21,346 --> 00:56:24,147
this will be my last flight before retiring

517
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,800
you have 10 years of creative life

518
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,520
artists and designers are also the same

519
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,700
Use your 10 years to live fruitfully

520
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:53,440
Jiro , come let's have a talk

521
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,300
But I have a meeting now

522
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:54,900
postpone it

523
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,821
The demands are too high

524
00:57:13,042 --> 00:57:14,250
it is always the case

525
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,111
Jiro , How many years have you been with the company?

526
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:18,982
Jiro

527
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:19,622
Ah

528
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:21,001
How long have you been with us?

529
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,210
Five years

530
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,240
I think it's already fair enough

531
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,471
That should be enough for you to become a chief designer.

532
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:29,119
For the prototype of army jet-fighter organized by navy

533
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,610
He has promoted you.

534
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,190
Jiro

535
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:46,721
what do you think?

536
00:57:47,151 --> 00:57:48,670
let me do it

537
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:50,091
Very well

538
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:52,221
can I ask Honjou as a staff?

539
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:55,100
That's not a very good idea. You'll be competing

540
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,293
your friendship will be affected

541
00:57:57,902 --> 00:57:59,290
Talk it over

542
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,490
Ms. Kimi, bill please

543
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:05,462
I have some task for Honjou

544
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,593
Domestic engine is such a crap.

545
00:59:01,594 --> 00:59:03,893
The aircraft carrier is aboard.

546
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:10,103
your clean clothes are ready!

547
00:59:10,192 --> 00:59:11,972
thank you so much

548
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:24,761
thank you for being generous

549
00:59:25,012 --> 00:59:26,591
does it fit you well?

550
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,596
Man overboard!

551
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:48,420
It's flying! success!

552
01:02:51,227 --> 01:02:53,777
Papa

553
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:41,353
Bravo! Nice catch

554
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,055
Thank you. were you hurt?

555
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,876
I'm fine
here is the umbrella

556
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,800
Thank you
we almost lost it. We could have been in trouble.

557
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:52,700
I have to go now

558
01:04:06,272 --> 01:04:08,977
papa, I think I said something wrong

559
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,410
he is a nice boy
We stay in the same hotel so we have a chance to thank him there

560
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:53,690
What is it?

561
01:06:54,804 --> 01:06:57,917
I saw the person who helped us with the umbrella

562
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:01,132
I wonder if he is with somebody

563
01:08:09,078 --> 01:08:11,367
sorry, I should go back later

564
01:08:12,417 --> 01:08:16,404
Please do not go.
I went here to pay my respect and give thanks

565
01:08:16,664 --> 01:08:20,881
I prayed and asked that you would come here

566
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:26,330
you haven't change a bit

567
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,330
eversince that time we met

568
01:08:29,261 --> 01:08:32,707
during the earthquake
Thank you so much

569
01:08:32,903 --> 01:08:35,371
I always wanted to meet you,
to thank you face to face

570
01:08:36,215 --> 01:08:37,806
Ah you're the girl during the ...

571
01:08:38,176 --> 01:08:41,096
My name is Naoko Satomi

572
01:08:41,564 --> 01:08:43,962
I'm Jiro Horikoshi

573
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:06,010
Are you OK

574
01:09:06,598 --> 01:09:08,582
I'm fine

575
01:09:08,598 --> 01:09:10,978
do you remember my maid

576
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:13,945
She got married 2 days before the incident

577
01:09:14,934 --> 01:09:17,412
on the commemoration, she often cries a lot

578
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:20,511
Jiro, in fact you were our prince

579
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,625
a prince ?

580
01:09:21,755 --> 01:09:24,971
Yes, you were a prince riding on a white horse

581
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:27,652
there is a leak on this umbrella

582
01:09:28,175 --> 01:09:31,827
it's okay, I have to tell you more about her

583
01:09:32,015 --> 01:09:35,117
She gave birth to her second child

584
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,274
the baby is very cute

585
01:09:40,562 --> 01:09:42,292
Your paintings are already soaked

586
01:09:42,631 --> 01:09:45,389
yes, it will eventually dry up

587
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:48,104
Look, the sun is working it out

588
01:09:54,318 --> 01:09:56,756
it's already dry here

589
01:09:57,715 --> 01:10:00,416
look over there

590
01:10:07,087 --> 01:10:09,507
I already forgot how a rainbow looks like

591
01:10:09,957 --> 01:10:12,228
Life is really beautiful, isn't it?

592
01:10:13,403 --> 01:10:16,639
We should go, I'm sure my dad is worrying by now

593
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:24,725
papa...

594
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,319
you come with me, I'll  introduce you to my father

595
01:10:27,329 --> 01:10:29,224
okay

596
01:10:30,343 --> 01:10:31,857
you are totally wet

597
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:35,275
I'm fine. he helped me

598
01:10:35,343 --> 01:10:36,420
He is Jiro Horikoshi

599
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:38,320
I'm Jiro Horikshi

600
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,480
I'm Satomi

601
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,935
seems My daughter has troubled you again

602
01:11:26,092 --> 01:11:28,523
do you mind me sitting here?

603
01:11:29,509 --> 01:11:31,708
not at all

604
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,100
This is German smoke, it's my last piece

605
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,350
kinda sad

606
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,650
I know the feeling

607
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:56,150
I had the same experience

608
01:11:56,405 --> 01:11:58,680
So you've been to Germany huh?

609
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,918
In De Zhao City right?

610
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:03,826
Are you Sherlock Holmes?

611
01:12:04,405 --> 01:12:10,320
I know you are an engineer, I always see you on German airplane magazines

612
01:12:10,985 --> 01:12:14,351
All japanese engineers go to De Zhao City

613
01:12:14,353 --> 01:12:18,059
Haha ~ you are totally right!

614
01:12:19,487 --> 01:12:22,122
Dr. Hugo is going to end

615
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,055
going to end?

616
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:28,833
He is fighting against odds with the government

617
01:12:28,975 --> 01:12:31,563
is it an envy from the political party

618
01:12:31,812 --> 01:12:34,563
a rogue group

619
01:12:35,115 --> 01:12:37,020
this is a cool place

620
01:12:37,368 --> 01:12:40,038
there are no mosquitoes, it's not hot

621
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,508
Watercress is delicious

622
01:12:41,963 --> 01:12:44,523
you can forget the unpleasant things

623
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:46,929
you wanna try this japanese smoke?

624
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,576
Thank you

625
01:12:54,151 --> 01:12:57,691
nice music, it's Der Zauberberg (the magic mountain)

626
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:59,959
Thomas Mann's magic Mountain?

627
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,373
It is a good place for forgetting things

628
01:13:02,672 --> 01:13:06,090
To forget about the war with China

629
01:13:06,108 --> 01:13:09,092
to forget what Manchukuo has made

630
01:13:09,104 --> 01:13:12,341
to forget being taken out from the League of Nations

631
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:14,997
to forget being the enemy of the world

632
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:17,732
Japan is recovering

633
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:20,090
Germany will also recover

634
01:13:20,324 --> 01:13:22,274
Will Germany go for war again?

635
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:25,288
We must stop talking now.

636
01:13:26,049 --> 01:13:28,566
Sorry to keep you waiting

637
01:13:28,925 --> 01:13:31,329
actually Naoko has a fever

638
01:13:31,414 --> 01:13:34,449
Please allow us to cancel our dinner for tonight

639
01:13:34,499 --> 01:13:37,866
I understand. Please tell her to get well soon

640
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:42,201
I'll go look for a doctor.

641
01:15:32,334 --> 01:15:34,805
Who hes ever seen the wind?

642
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:42,632
You nor I have seen it.
but when it quivers my face, the wind passes by

643
01:15:47,988 --> 01:15:50,380
but when the wind soar and quivers

644
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:54,749
I'll send it to your side."

645
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:29,695
Jiro

646
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:31,235
Naoko

647
01:16:50,368 --> 01:16:52,492
hold on

648
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:48,941
nice catch

649
01:20:02,209 --> 01:20:04,526
is your daughter already well?

650
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:06,546
thanks, she is now

651
01:20:06,782 --> 01:20:12,334
That's good. all will be healed on Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain

652
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,912
that's probably true

653
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:18,559
this guy seemed so lonely before

654
01:20:18,741 --> 01:20:20,587
but now look at him, he is so alive

655
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:22,765
because he fell in love

656
01:20:23,587 --> 01:20:25,661
Yes

657
01:20:26,194 --> 01:20:28,479
this love will end so fast

658
01:20:28,777 --> 01:20:32,284
love sickness? the mountain will forget

659
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:34,507
I'm not that kind

660
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,928
with.. don't say it's my daughter!

661
01:20:39,404 --> 01:20:41,578
Yes, with Naoko

662
01:20:42,401 --> 01:20:45,121
Please allow me to date your daugher

663
01:20:46,188 --> 01:20:47,937
it's ok.... however

664
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,886
About that thing, please allow me to accept it

665
01:20:53,592 --> 01:20:56,052
this is lovely

666
01:20:58,401 --> 01:21:02,372
before anything else, we have something to talk about

667
01:21:02,681 --> 01:21:06,151
two years ago, my mother died of tuberculosis

668
01:21:06,823 --> 01:21:09,306
and I am also suffering from tuberculosis

669
01:21:09,599 --> 01:21:11,705
I always have loved you

670
01:21:11,822 --> 01:21:14,004
from the time you saved my hat

671
01:21:14,522 --> 01:21:18,053
Me too, eversince the wind brought you to me

672
01:21:18,761 --> 01:21:20,414
Will you marry me?

673
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,756
Yes... but I have to get well first

674
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,823
can you wait until that time

675
01:21:25,975 --> 01:21:28,810
even if it takes a hundred years

676
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:32,215
Congratulations ... He is such a good young man

677
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:35,635
your daughter is also a fine lady

678
01:21:35,777 --> 01:21:39,412
This summer is a great summer

679
01:22:00,169 --> 01:22:01,915
Jiro! over here

680
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:03,910
Honjou! when did you come back?

681
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:05,204
the other day

682
01:22:05,891 --> 01:22:08,174
it's hot here

683
01:22:09,645 --> 01:22:12,276
Help me take a look at this.

684
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:19,476
It's beautiful...... this is good

685
01:22:22,653 --> 01:22:27,503
It's an experimental machine
so you are free to do what you want

686
01:22:27,953 --> 01:22:30,432
It's hard to figure out without an actual test

687
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:31,880
This will fly

688
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,440
the wind is blowing

689
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:55,669
Hojou you are the Achilles of Japan

690
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:57,210
The 20 years has shortened

691
01:22:57,873 --> 01:22:59,930
Mine was a tin-plate duck type

692
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,794
Do you want to use this?

693
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:05,017
I was not able to use it on my duck plane

694
01:23:06,946 --> 01:23:09,800
it is used on the test port cover rivets

695
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,568
to reduce air resistance

696
01:23:11,568 --> 01:23:14,560
the hinges on the fuel inlets

697
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,189
will be more convenient for access

698
01:23:20,815 --> 01:23:23,590
with this, I think the elasticity of the spring is enough

699
01:23:23,954 --> 01:23:27,627
Jiro that's a great idea.. this is Columbus' egg

700
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:28,520
please use it

701
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:30,200
thank you

702
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,125
But not now

703
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:34,457
I'll keep this design

704
01:23:34,771 --> 01:23:36,300
you are going to use it next time, so after you

705
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,385
please let me use this too

706
01:23:38,385 --> 01:23:40,000
affirmative

707
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,648
I'm looking forward to use it

708
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,839
Jiro ! where are you?

709
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:48,300
Mr. Kurokawa.... Jiro

710
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,000
come back quickly..

711
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:49,800
yes sir

712
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,900
thanks. I will visit you in your house soon

713
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:52,650
okay

714
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,029
Jiro,, you pedal

715
01:23:59,417 --> 01:24:01,641
Jiro, you are being investigated by the agents

716
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:04,958
you are a target of white-collar crime by the secret police

717
01:24:05,761 --> 01:24:09,312
we told them you are not here and you are on a business trip

718
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:22,900
just go along with the plan, they pretend they left

719
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,880
Jiro stay here, your work will be brought here

720
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:28,225
please explain what happened.I am innocent

721
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:31,070
I have 2 friends who were arrested

722
01:24:31,429 --> 01:24:34,027
they were innocent as well

723
01:24:34,174 --> 01:24:35,480
come in

724
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,480
we're coming in

725
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,800
please bear with this for the mean while

726
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:42,000
Do you still need something?

727
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,916
go back as soon as you drop the things

728
01:24:44,098 --> 01:24:47,156
Jiro it has arrived!! ... the beta prototype of the flange

729
01:24:56,628 --> 01:25:00,642
it looks good... if only we had it a year ahead

730
01:25:00,747 --> 01:25:02,546
Jiro.. How is it?

731
01:25:02,628 --> 01:25:06,111
Next time the ducklings(ahirunoko) will become duck-mole(kamogura)[japanese humor]

732
01:25:07,253 --> 01:25:11,387
entirely a metal duck right?
Mr. Hirokawa how is it?

733
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:14,767
The duralumin era has already ended

734
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,100
Let's all go back!

735
01:25:28,515 --> 01:25:30,000
I think no one is after us

736
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
none

737
01:25:32,857 --> 01:25:35,958
Just to be safe, do not show up for 2-3 days

738
01:25:36,246 --> 01:25:37,832
they will deal it until today

739
01:25:37,854 --> 01:25:39,629
you can come to my place, it's distant from here

740
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,701
Please allow me to go to my dormitory, I'm expecting a letter

741
01:25:43,137 --> 01:25:44,952
I think it would not be safe

742
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:46,560
It would be trouble if they find it.

743
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:48,669
It's fine but an undercover agent might appear

744
01:25:48,843 --> 01:25:51,778
it is translated letter that contains profanity

745
01:25:51,858 --> 01:25:54,146
regarding serious diligence to modern nation

746
01:25:55,642 --> 01:25:57,699
you translated it?

747
01:25:57,865 --> 01:25:59,300
Jiro you are just a human

748
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,300
That's funny. I though Japan is a modern nation

749
01:26:01,955 --> 01:26:03,702
It's not a funny thing to laught at

750
01:26:03,996 --> 01:26:07,018
Of course it's not. tell the agent posted in your place

751
01:26:07,202 --> 01:26:09,680
that those are just like love letters

752
01:26:09,825 --> 01:26:13,206
The next aircraft is coming soon. you will do it.

753
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:17,818
the company will do everything to protect you.
you are person who is very reliable

754
01:26:17,868 --> 01:26:19,829
put your focus on the job

755
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:28,857
despite of that, we parted ways too soon

756
01:26:39,647 --> 01:26:45,162
wherever he is, I'm continuously pray for his safety outside of the country

757
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,100
Jiro , you have a phone call

758
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,400
thanks

759
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,363
phone is over there

760
01:27:05,363 --> 01:27:08,368
Thank you

761
01:27:09,196 --> 01:27:13,169
Hello....... jiro it's me,  there's a telegram for you

762
01:27:14,335 --> 01:27:18,040
The people here are worried....

763
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:20,039
please read it for me

764
01:27:20,171 --> 01:27:21,896
is it okay?...
sure

765
01:27:23,403 --> 01:27:30,200
Naoko . . . Cough . . Hemo...ptysis,, father..

766
01:27:36,955 --> 01:27:38,900
hello.. are you still there?

767
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,900
yes. thank you very much

768
01:27:41,329 --> 01:27:43,797
wait.. don't hang up.. hello

769
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,924
Please tell me the fastest way to go back to Tokyo.

770
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:54,641
to Tokyo?
Yes, I need to get back there

771
01:27:54,925 --> 01:27:56,650
wait a moment

772
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:58,578
the bus will come at noon

773
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:00,866
you will reach the train station at 1pm

774
01:28:01,095 --> 01:28:04,074
I'll somebody to assist you.. be ready

775
01:28:04,317 --> 01:28:05,894
Jia.. Jia..

776
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:49,900
Jiro

777
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,900
I'm sorry, it took a while

778
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,200
I might infect you

779
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:08,900
you're beautiful

780
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,900
I love you

781
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,900
Jiro came through the back door

782
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,900
yes, come in

783
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:33,900
Jiro went to visit
But he needs to go back very soon

784
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,900
Next time I will use the main entrance

785
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:37,900
I prefer you coming through the back door

786
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:39,900
okay, I must do it again then

787
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:41,900
take care

788
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:45,900
you take care too..
I'm going ahead

789
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:47,900
I'll send you off

790
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:55,900
the last train? you must hurry then

791
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,900
if only I can stay here with her

792
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:06,900
I object..,I think you should to work
go hurry up

793
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,900
you're crying

794
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:24,900
I think I will take the doctors advice. I am going to the Hospital in the mountains

795
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:28,900
that place is sad.., you will be alone

796
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,600
I want to live to be with Jiro

797
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:41,900
you're just right on time.. the top management is waiting

798
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,900
well then?

799
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:51,900
I will do my best

800
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,900
Next will be the navy

801
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:06,700
I will do my best

802
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,440
you were not listening

803
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:09,500
yes

804
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,900
then it was cancelled

805
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,900
it's greatly taking time.... oh chief

806
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,900
seems a study class about accomplishments

807
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:20,900
oh

808
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,240
Next is the latest aviation technology

809
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:26,700
look at this

810
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:27,900
it's a retractable landing gear right?

811
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:30,900
To reach 270 nautical miles per hour , this is needed

812
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:34,300
270 nautical miles per hour... around 500 km/hr?

813
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,900
isn't is that the navy requires  220 nautical miles per hour?

814
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,200
That would be very soon
but it will eventually be outdated

815
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,500
the wing-load bearing capacity is 120,000 sq. km

816
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,600
its resistance to damage

817
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:47,200
will be a bold introduction to the latest technology

818
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,100
of course there are slats and split flaps

819
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:10,900
interesting! ,,,, nice!

820
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,900
However, it will be a bit heavy

821
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,900
but if it's not loaded with machine guns, it should be fine

822
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,900
this idea will be conveyed for next opportunity

823
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,280
it's exceptional

824
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,900
that's too close

825
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,060
our engines are incompetent

826
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:38,360
Our job is to make it light and tough

827
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,400
reduce as much as possible

828
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,320
make the surface smooth to reduce air resistance

829
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:47,100
Our airplanes will be an unprecedented all-metal airplane

830
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:48,900
may I...

831
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,900
come here Mr. Hirayama

832
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,950
Mr Hirayama from the production department technician is here with us

833
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:56,900
I'm Hirayama

834
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:01,900
He's going to talk about the new rivet

835
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:07,800
keeping the head of the rivet flat all throughout, is technically impossible

836
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:08,900
what's it about?

837
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:10,600
Flat head rivets

838
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:16,500
flat head rivets are already existing all ocer the world
so me might have to use it

839
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:22,900
that was really interesting

840
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:46,300
Miss Satomi you have a mail

841
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,900
thank you

842
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,900
Chief , phone call for you

843
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:07,760
I'll take it later

844
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,900
it seems to be an emergency

845
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,900
Hello, yes

846
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,280
Jiro

847
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:26,900
thank God

848
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,900
You don't know how much I wanted to see you.

849
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,900
are you well now? can you walk?

850
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:35,280
yes

851
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,900
Let's Go

852
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:46,600
after seeing you, I'll go home

853
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:47,450
please don't go

854
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,300
Stay here and live with me

855
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:06,250
such a beautiful girl

856
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:07,450
I'm Naoko

857
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,800
Nice to meet you Ms. Naoko

858
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:09,900
Is it Jiro?

859
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:12,120
I am to ask you a favor

860
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,150
my husband, isn't it good?

861
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:19,600
separate rooms is no problem, but for an unmarried couple

862
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,900
i won't allow it!

863
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:27,100
We will marry right away
Mr. Kurokawa Mrs. Kurokawa, please be our witness

864
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:27,900
right now?

865
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:28,480
that's stupid

866
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:33,720
dear,  dont you think it's lovely?
In order to love, it takes courage to conquer the mountain

867
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:38,600
My father knows all about this
The hospital as well was informed

868
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:39,300
please allow us

869
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:47,900
If that's the case, then let me handle things with the bride
Naoko, please come with me

870
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:55,900
don't mind my husband he is always like that

871
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:03,900
If you care about her, you should go back to the mountains as soon as possible

872
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,900
I can bring her back but I had to quit doing airplanes
But I can not do that

873
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:12,900
That would not be love, but your own selfish way

874
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:16,900
We don't have enough time anymore, we have to settling things

875
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,100
I get it.. I give you my best wishes!

876
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:46,900
they are coming

877
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:49,800
they're here

878
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:18,900
Listen.... this beautiful lady abandoned her riches
Alone on the mountains and leave to reach here....

879
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:27,900
I say.... I hope they won't regret it

880
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:30,900
May marriage not separate them till death

881
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,900
You're very beautiful

882
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:38,900
Mr. Kurokawa Mrs. Kurokawa we appreciate your warm thoughts
there are no words to express how much we can thank you. will never forget this

883
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:47,900
Our pleasure
you being with a wonderful person like Jiro is making us happy... right dear?

884
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,900
It's heroic! This calls for a celebration...Congratulations!!

885
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:07,900
did you get tired?

886
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:12,700
somehow I feel shaking in my dreams

887
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:14,900
have peace in mind.. rest well

888
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:16,900
please come here

889
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:17,900
But ...

890
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:21,900
Come

891
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,900
Jiro, do you always come home this late?

892
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,900
Kayo I totally forgot you were coming.

893
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,900
You are so mean..

894
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,900
You are now a doctor right.. Congratulations!

895
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:15,100
I have to congratulate you too
Congratulations on your wedding

896
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,900
I came to thank Mr. and Mrs, Kurokawa
in behalf of our parents

897
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,040
Where are Mr. and Mrs Kurokawa?

898
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,900
they are already asleep

899
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:22,990
Have you met Naoko?

900
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:23,800
yes

901
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:29,680
Do you care about Naoko?

902
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,680
leaving her alone and just letting her sleep

903
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:36,040
She is suffering so hard more than you think

904
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:39,000
I am a doctor so somehow I can understand her situation

905
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:44,500
Dint you even notice that she tries to give you peace of mind
and puts make-up and blush on every morning

906
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:51,800
I like Naoko very much.. she is a nice person.. I pity her

907
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:58,900
is it hard for her to go back to the hospital on the mountain?

908
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:04,900
we are spending our life to the fullest everyday

909
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,900
you should rest now.. thank you for paying a visit

910
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,900
I'm home

911
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:26,900
welcome home

912
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:27,900
just sleep

913
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:34,900
do you feel okay?

914
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,900
Kayo went to visit

915
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:37,900
Oh

916
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:39,900
we got along well with each other quick

917
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:44,520
she is sparkling
she is a person full of ambitions

918
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:49,120
next time, she'll take a break and will visit here as a doctor

919
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:56,900
I got a sleep-wear from your mother.. it is very warm

920
01:44:58,300 --> 01:44:59,300
is it too bright?

921
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:01,900
it's fine enough

922
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:04,900
I have to do this until tomorrow

923
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:06,880
Mackerel bones?

924
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:12,040
you still remember.. we're building a family soon as husband and wife

925
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:16,900
can you come close to me

926
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,720
hold my hands

927
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:33,900
I love looking at your face when you're doing your work

928
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:38,880
If there is a competition using one hand, I will be the winner

929
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,880
it will go well I guess

930
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:43,040
maybe reduction of 50g to it's weight seems possible

931
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:44,900
that's great

932
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:47,240
150g for 30 minutes

933
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,200
it's too much

934
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:51,900
if it's for two, maybe half is okay

935
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:55,900
because it's just the skeleton, if it's a mackerel bones, the meat can be eaten

936
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:03,900
I gave you a goodnight kiss, so you should sleep now

937
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:04,900
don't let go of my hand

938
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:06,900
I won't

939
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,700
I want to smoke, can I let go of your hand?

940
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,900
No. you can smoke here

941
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,360
It's not good for you

942
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:17,500
It's okay

943
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:37,640
Hey Honjo

944
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:38,900
Can I look at it?

945
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,900
sure.. your airplane is awesome.... fair enough

946
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:46,900
it's vanguard! very daring..

947
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:51,900
so this are the flat head rivets..

948
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,900
it's uneven

949
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:58,900
totally Jiro's work

950
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,000
no influence from Junkers like mine

951
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:08,900
These is a mackerel bone.. it's awesome

952
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:16,900
Jiro please let me use the flat head rivets
also the idea of the hinge

953
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:17,900
sure

954
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:23,080
I asked for a new  bomber design but they said they will just change the fuselage

955
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:24,900
-

956
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:28,440
mostly fuel tanks,  it will catch fire in a couple of bullets

957
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:32,280
I haven't researched about bullet proof  tanks yet

958
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:36,050
having the first japan assembled airplane to fly for Navy's is a big deal

959
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,900
Hanging the bombs will reduce the weight, therefore it can fly above three thousand kilometers

960
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:44,900
just right timing for the power up

961
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:58,900
I wonder where will be the war and with whom

962
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:03,300
USSR, England,  Netherlands, America

963
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:04,900
there will be bombings

964
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:08,900
We are not the destructive weapon dealers
we just want to make a great airplane

965
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:09,900
you're right

966
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,900
see you around. get some sleep

967
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:13,720
You too Honjou

968
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,900
we're going ahead of you..
okay

969
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:44,900
welcome back home

970
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:48,900
It's finished. we just have to wait until test the flight

971
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:51,900
Congratulations, you worked so hard for it

972
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:58,900
It's tiring to go back and forth to work everyday
I might need to stay there for few days

973
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,080
you look so tired

974
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:03,900
yeah a bit

975
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:06,900
it will surely fly

976
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:12,280
it will.. it's because of you

977
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,900
Jiro  I love you

978
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,900
Naoko

979
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:08,900
I'm going now

980
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,900
I wish your success

981
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:37,900
Oh Naoko

982
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:42,900
Mrs. Kurokawa I feel well this morning
I want to go for a walk around

983
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,900
okay, don't force yourself too much

984
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:50,900
I left the room quite dirty
I'll clean after I get back

985
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:55,900
okay
Kayo is coming today.. looking forward to see her

986
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:57,900
yes,,, I'll come back very soon

987
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,900
come in

988
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:47,900
Oh I knew it..

989
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:59,900
She left letters
There is one for me too

990
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:08,100
She went back to the hospital in the mountain.. I will go after her

991
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:10,200
No.. don't chase her

992
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:20,900
We will see her again when she gets well
she just wanted to be with the person she loves

993
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:09,900
this is awesome
I

994
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:12,200
hey over there what have you recorded?

995
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,700
I'm so sorry, we have to do it again
It's too fast!

996
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:16,900
how many nautical miles?

997
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,700
Yeah is 240 nautical miles

998
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:19,900
240?

999
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:57,900
it's a success! banzai!

1000
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:00,900
Hey Jiro

1001
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:11,400
It's a great airplane!
thank you..

1002
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:24,900
you came...
Japanese boy

1003
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:26,900
Mr. Caproni

1004
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:33,300
Here is where we first met right?

1005
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:35,900
this is the kingdom of our dreams

1006
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:37,600
I thought it was hell

1007
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:44,900
it's different but maybe almost the same thing
How was your 10 years? did you exert a lot of effort?

1008
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:47,900
it turned into pieces in the end

1009
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:52,900
Coz we destroyed the country
That is your Zero

1010
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:31,900
it's spectacular.. such a good work

1011
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:33,900
But no one even came back

1012
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:41,900
No one is coming back
though an airplane is beautiful it is a curse dream
We are all being swallowed by this universe

1013
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,900
There is someone waiting for you

1014
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:00,900
Naoko

1015
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:04,400
She has been here waiting for you

1016
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,800
Jiro you have to live

1017
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:12,000
live

1018
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,900
i will

1019
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:38,900
She's gone
she's like a beautiful wind

1020
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:41,600
Thank you

1021
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:43,900
thank you..

1022
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:51,900
You must continue living on
don't you want to get closer? there is a good wine ahead
