513
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:48,179
"Boy, that sucks...

514
00:38:48,288 --> 00:38:52,247
and I'm really sorry
it happened to you."

- [Chuckling] Yeah.

that I don't see him on the holidays.

No, it's the way we do that—

But not the specifics.

529

Cancer's okay,
but no one ever says "lung cancer."

- Oh, just... wandering around Rittenhouse.

You know, I give this girl a job.
She seems normal.

Next thing I know,
she's taken off with this dog.

00:40:55,148 --> 00:40:59,778
You can imagine, something like this gets out,
and I'm out of business.

00:40:59,886 --> 00:41:04,789
So, how does 200 sound for a reward?
Fair enough?

extra blankets in the closet.

she was exactly like that.

683
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:36,052
What was the last
great restaurant you went to?

684
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:39,892
- I took my sister to Le Bec Fin.
- Uh-huh.

685
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:45,130
And you both got the... snapper,
right?

686
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:47,296
Close. I got the snapper.

687
00:50:47,406 --> 00:50:51,172
- She got three rum and Cokes
and the sommelier's phone number.
- [Laughs] Okay.

688
00:50:51,277 --> 00:50:55,270
Well, I'll take you there,
and we'll get...

689
00:50:55,381 --> 00:50:59,647
the foie gras
with Roquefort-stuffed fig...

690
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:02,277
Scottish wood pigeon with cabbage...

691
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:04,913
and porcini cassoulet.

692
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:08,693
And the chocolate mousse...

693
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:11,354
with raspberries
and hazelnut macaroon.

694
00:51:11,463 --> 00:51:14,432
You'll want to eat with me
for the rest of your life.

695
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:20,666
- Ah.
- Here you go.

696
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:23,037
- Mmm.
- I know.

697
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:24,973
- The special, tara.
- Thank you.

698
00:51:25,077 --> 00:51:26,977
Enjoy.

699
00:51:28,247 --> 00:51:31,307
So— [Clears Throat]
What are the other rumors?

700
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:33,544
Ah. Um—

701
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:36,712
Rumor one: Mysterious illness.

702
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:39,882
Rumor two: Head-hunted
by Pepper and Hamilton.

703
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:45,025
Here. Try some of this.

704
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,361
- Rumor three?
- Um, soy?

705
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:50,662
Oh, come on.
What's rumor three?

706
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:58,238
Affair with a partner gone bad.

707
00:51:58,344 --> 00:52:00,812
[Laughs]

708
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,717
Don't worry.

709
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,083
Most people are betting on lupus.

710
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:19,423
Here.
Wasabi makes everything better.

711
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:27,229
- So, uh, what time Friday?
- Friday?

712
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:29,239
Dinner.

713
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:33,243
Oh, look, Simon, this was— this was
really nice, but, um, I don't think—

714
00:52:33,345 --> 00:52:35,210
7:00 it is.

715
00:52:38,217 --> 00:52:40,117
Thank you.

716
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:48,826
Mmm. That smells good.
What is that?

717
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:50,895
That's braised veal.

718
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,858
- Shit.
- [Drink Fizzing]

719
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:59,130
There's a paper towel on the counter.

720
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:07,838
Out of curiosity...

721
00:53:07,946 --> 00:53:11,040
how long is this vacation of yours
going to last?

722
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,381
How come you don't have
any pictures of my mom around?

723
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,421
Don't you like thinking about her?

724
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:20,492
I don't need to have a picture
to think about my daughter.

725
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:32,468
You put out pictures,
people ask questions.

726
00:53:32,571 --> 00:53:35,597
They expect you to tell 'em everything,
and I don't do that.

727
00:53:35,707 --> 00:53:38,175
'Cause Mom was sick?

728
00:53:38,277 --> 00:53:40,575
Because she's gone.

729
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,907
Is that why you pulled away from us?

730
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:47,485
So that you didn't have to talk
about her with us either?

731
00:53:47,586 --> 00:53:50,578
I didn't pull away. I was pushed.

732
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,925
No, listen.

733
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:58,656
I'm not the one who didn't pass along
the letters. That was your father.

734
00:53:58,764 --> 00:54:00,698
I'm not the one
who didn't want a relationship.

735
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:03,734
He said that? "I don't want you to have
a relationship with my daughters."

736
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:05,804
- [Chuckling] Oh, yes.
- When?

737
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:09,169
- At the funeral.
- Why? Why would he say that?

738
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:15,139
Because he's irrational. Yeah.
He blamed me for everything.

739
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:18,148
Every bad day, every bad episode.

740
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,447
He did not want me near her.

741
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,521
And after she was gone...

742
00:54:23,622 --> 00:54:27,080
he didn't want me near you
or your sister.

743
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:33,797
I just wonder—

744
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,736
If you had tried harder,
you know, or, like, tried again...

745
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:44,104
after he'd gotten over the whole...

746
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:47,201
shock and grief of it, you know?

747
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:55,081
'Cause it would have been nice
having a grandmother.

748
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:57,155
Nice and...

749
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,351
maybe a little less lonely.

750
00:55:06,198 --> 00:55:09,326
She sounds like a manipulative
little nincompoop.

751
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:13,131
- The girl lost her mother.
- So? You lost your daughter.

752
00:55:13,238 --> 00:55:15,229
- It's not the same.
- It's worse.

753
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,673
A parent burying a child
goes against the law of nature.

754
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:22,577
Well, so does a grandparent
abandoning her grandchildren.

755
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:25,309
You said yourself
he didn't want you around.

756
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:28,352
What were you supposed to do,
break down the door?

757
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:30,387
Yes.

758
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:33,523
Shoelace.

759
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,326
For Caroline, yes.

760
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,661
For Caroline.
She was gone, cookie.

761
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:45,259
And you pushing your way into that house
wasn't gonna do a thing for her.

762
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:47,895
- She wanted me there.
- You don't know that.

763
00:55:48,006 --> 00:55:51,407
- Yes, I do. I know.
- How?

764
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:55,079
I just do.

765
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,080
How?

766
00:55:59,585 --> 00:56:02,145
I've never told anybody this,
not even Ira.

767
00:56:02,254 --> 00:56:06,418
I'll take it to my grave,
probably tomorrow.

768
00:56:06,525 --> 00:56:08,493
[Chuckles]

769
00:56:11,229 --> 00:56:13,197
It wasn't a car accident.

770
00:56:13,298 --> 00:56:16,665
I mean, eh— it— it was a car...

771
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:21,535
and there was a crash, but—

772
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:25,609
How do you know it was on purpose?

773
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,348
She wrote a note.

774
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:36,844
It came the day after the funeral.

775
00:56:36,955 --> 00:56:39,549
What'd it say?

776
00:56:39,658 --> 00:56:41,558
One line.

777
00:56:42,661 --> 00:56:45,528
"Please take care of my girls."

778
00:56:45,631 --> 00:56:48,623
- And you didn't.
- [Restrained Sobbing] Mm-mmm.

779
00:56:48,734 --> 00:56:50,759
You didn't because you couldn't.

780
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:53,133
Now you can, so you will.

781
00:56:53,238 --> 00:56:57,698
Ella, bubbeleh, you did the best
you could in a very bad situation.

782
00:56:57,809 --> 00:57:00,607
You got nothing to feel guilty about.

783
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,543
And you tell that
to Miss Hotsy-Totsy Pants.

784
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:07,619
[Chuckles]

785
00:57:15,794 --> 00:57:18,922
So this is where all my boyfriends
have been coming from.

786
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:21,192
[Chuckles]

787
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:25,258
They took a vote. I don't know who
I pissed off, but somehow... I lost.

788
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:28,737
Or won. Either way, it's official.

789
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,673
I am the captain of the softball team.

790
00:57:31,777 --> 00:57:34,143
[Laughs]

791
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:36,146
Yeah.

792
00:57:37,783 --> 00:57:41,446
Look, I know this isn't my business,
but I can't not say anything.

793
00:57:41,553 --> 00:57:46,957
You have rights, legal options
for getting your job back.

794
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:48,959
I don't want it back.

795
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:51,723
You don't?

796
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,025
I thought you loved it.

797
00:57:54,132 --> 00:57:57,397
You were always the first one there in the morning
and the last one to leave at night.

798
00:57:57,502 --> 00:58:01,029
I know. Not because I loved it.

799
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:03,039
Then why?

800
00:58:04,176 --> 00:58:06,076
I don't know.

801
00:58:06,178 --> 00:58:10,012
Maybe... I was scared of what
would happen if I wasn't there.

802
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:13,278
Oh, what? Like the place
would fall apart without you?

803
00:58:13,385 --> 00:58:17,014
- With law freaks like you there? Never.
- [Laughs]

804
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:20,455
No, I wasn't worried about the office.

805
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,824
I guess it was more... me...

806
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:26,921
and what would happen to me
without those people to please...

807
00:58:27,032 --> 00:58:29,660
and those tasks to get done.

808
00:58:29,768 --> 00:58:33,534
Like... maybe... those were
the things holding me together.

809
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,275
And without them, I'd...

810
00:58:38,376 --> 00:58:40,344
fall apart.

811
00:58:42,547 --> 00:58:45,072
But you didn't.

812
00:58:45,183 --> 00:58:47,083
I guess not.

813
00:58:49,454 --> 00:58:51,922
So what does hold you together?

814
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:03,930
For me, it's the law, politics...

815
00:59:04,035 --> 00:59:06,094
the Sixers and good food.

816
00:59:06,204 --> 00:59:11,164
If you ever want to join me
for a game or a meal...

817
00:59:12,277 --> 00:59:14,336
I hope you'll give me a call.

818
00:59:30,896 --> 00:59:32,796
Ella?

819
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:10,732
[Gasps]
Oh. I was just looking for—

820
01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:12,736
For what?

821
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:19,233
[Sighs]
Sorry, l—

822
01:00:19,344 --> 01:00:22,711
Wrong dresser.
It's in the sock drawer.

823
01:00:22,814 --> 01:00:24,839
What is?

824
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:28,886
My cash. That's what you were looking for,
right? That's what you want.

825
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:32,081
[Scoffs]
No. God.

826
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:35,751
[Clicks Tongue]
Oh, well.

827
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:38,659
I guess after being absent
for some 20-odd years or so...

828
01:00:38,763 --> 01:00:41,698
I can't expect you to want
to have a relationship with me.

829
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,268
- How much?
- How much what?

830
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:48,931
Money, Maggie. How much money
were you hoping to get from me?

831
01:00:51,509 --> 01:00:54,740
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

832
01:00:56,381 --> 01:00:59,214
I want to go to New York.

833
01:00:59,317 --> 01:01:04,016
Maybe... act.
I think I'd be good at it.

834
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:07,319
Mmm, clearly.

835
01:01:07,425 --> 01:01:09,450
- How much do you need?
- Three grand.

836
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:12,257
That you would not have found
in the sock drawer.

837
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:14,332
How much do you have?

838
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:19,969
Well...

839
01:01:20,071 --> 01:01:23,529
I won't give you $3,000,
but I'll do this.

840
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:26,736
They need help over
at the Assisted Living Center.

841
01:01:26,845 --> 01:01:31,214
You get that job, stop loafing around
here like some princess...

842
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,784
and I will match what you earn,
penny for penny.

843
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:42,724
You would do that?

844
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,297
Why?

845
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:50,033
Because I'm your grandmother.

846
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:55,863
[Chattering]

847
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:59,442
[Woman]
Oh, I don't think so.

848
01:01:59,544 --> 01:02:03,503
Last time I ran anywhere was to my wedding.
Look what happened.

849
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:15,187
- Is that Corinne?
- No.

850
01:02:15,293 --> 01:02:17,193
- Who is it?
- Maggie.

851
01:02:17,295 --> 01:02:19,661
Have we met before?

852
01:02:19,764 --> 01:02:22,892
There's a pick-up line
with a little dust on it.

853
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:25,265
Fine. What's your sign?

854
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,702
I've been out of the game for a while.

855
01:02:27,806 --> 01:02:30,274
What, like 70, 80 years?

856
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:33,367
[Chuckling]
Give or take.

857
01:02:33,478 --> 01:02:35,446
Where's Corinne?
She's my number-one girl.

858
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:38,141
Well, excuse me, but what does
Corinne have that I don't?

859
01:02:38,249 --> 01:02:42,811
- She reads to me.
- Oh.

860
01:02:42,921 --> 01:02:47,290
You could do it, maybe nose her
out of first position.

861
01:02:49,294 --> 01:02:51,262
Here.

862
01:02:53,365 --> 01:02:56,300
I'm a little busy right now.

863
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:59,893
Maybe you should wait for Corinne.

864
01:03:07,545 --> 01:03:10,343
- [Exhales Deeply]
- [Line Ringing]

865
01:03:10,448 --> 01:03:13,315
- [Simon] Hello?
- Are the Sixers basketball or hockey?

866
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:15,716
[OrganFanfare]

867
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:18,448
[Crowd Cheering]

868
01:03:18,556 --> 01:03:20,524
[Simon]
Come on, Eric.!

869
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,059
Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!

870
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:25,652
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Get back, get back!

871
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:28,892
That's Reggie Miller.!
You gotta get him.!

872
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,468
- [Sixers Fans Booing]
- He'll make it every time.

873
01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:33,469
Boo! That's right.

874
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:35,664
- Boo!
- Good.

875
01:03:38,343 --> 01:03:40,311
[Man]
I can't believe we lost the game.

876
01:03:40,412 --> 01:03:42,880
- Why can't you believe it?
We've been losin' all season long.
- That's right.

877
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:45,609
We need a three-point man, a man who
can shoot the pill, a man who can thrill.

878
01:03:45,717 --> 01:03:48,083
I don't care if you have the best
three-point shooter in the league.

879
01:03:48,186 --> 01:03:51,121
- You got to get back on defense.
- But at the same time, you need
to put points on the boards too.

880
01:03:51,222 --> 01:03:54,020
Look at the best teams in history—
the Celtics, the Bulls, the Lakers—

881
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,025
all great defensive teams.

882
01:03:56,127 --> 01:03:58,595
I mean, offense sells tickets,
but defense wins ball games.

883
01:03:58,696 --> 01:04:01,096
- He's right.
Without defense, you won't win games.
- Thank you.

884
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,502
[Sniffs]

885
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,372
Hmm.

886
01:04:14,012 --> 01:04:16,412
I see you're a fan of the classics.

887
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:20,341
Um, what?

888
01:04:24,355 --> 01:04:28,223
- Oh, that. That-That's my sister's.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

889
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:30,760
I hope you like cheap, almost-stale red.

890
01:04:30,862 --> 01:04:32,762
[Chuckles]
It's my favorite.

891
01:04:33,898 --> 01:04:35,957
What's she like— the sister?

892
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:39,332
She's, you know, a sister.

893
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:44,266
- You don't want to talk about your sister.
- I didn't say that.

894
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:49,570
I don't want to talk about my sister.

895
01:04:51,883 --> 01:04:53,851
Cheers.

896
01:05:01,326 --> 01:05:04,352
So what's he like,
this, um, Captain Jack?

897
01:05:06,965 --> 01:05:08,933
"His fingers tangled in her curls...

898
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:12,992
"while his tongue plundered
the soft cavern of her mouth.

899
01:05:13,104 --> 01:05:15,072
"She made no protest.

900
01:05:15,173 --> 01:05:18,040
"Her furnace was alight.

901
01:05:18,143 --> 01:05:21,112
"Jack drew his lips from hers
and urged her forward...

902
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:24,113
"so he could take
one shirt-veiled nipple...

903
01:05:24,215 --> 01:05:26,115
"into his mouth.

904
01:05:26,217 --> 01:05:29,050
"Kit's gasp urged him on.

905
01:05:29,154 --> 01:05:31,645
"He licked the material
until it clung...

906
01:05:31,756 --> 01:05:33,656
"to the ripe peak...

907
01:05:33,758 --> 01:05:37,125
"then drew the turgid flesh
deep into his mouth.

908
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:42,097
"Kit moaned, her body
spasming in response.

909
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,397
Her eyes were closed,
her lips parted."

910
01:05:47,105 --> 01:05:49,903
Okay, um, embarrassing
as this is to admit...

911
01:05:50,008 --> 01:05:52,476
I'm officially turned on.

912
01:07:16,561 --> 01:07:19,029
Does this mean that I'm your bitch?

913
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:23,366
Do you want to be my bitch?

914
01:07:28,906 --> 01:07:32,239
I have wanted to be your bitch
since my first day at Dommel.

915
01:07:34,212 --> 01:07:39,172
That Chicago trip— I was convinced it was
all gonna come together for me there.

916
01:07:39,284 --> 01:07:44,085
- Was I unfriendly?
- Oh, no. I mean, not compared to, say, Stalin.

917
01:07:44,188 --> 01:07:46,156
[Both Laugh]

918
01:07:47,759 --> 01:07:50,091
I'm sorry.

919
01:07:50,194 --> 01:07:54,460
- Hmm. I was hideous.
- That's okay.

920
01:07:54,565 --> 01:07:57,125
You have plenty of time
to make it up to me.

921
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:05,509
[Dogs Barking]

922
01:08:11,182 --> 01:08:14,879
- Go, go, go!
- [Barking]

923
01:08:16,387 --> 01:08:18,287
Come on, come on!

924
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:23,451
- [Barking]
- Yes! Go!

925
01:08:25,029 --> 01:08:29,329
Yes! [Laughing] Yes!

926
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:34,431
So, how's it going with Hotsy Tots?

927
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:37,406
- [Chuckling] Oh, fine.
- "Fine," she says.

928
01:08:37,508 --> 01:08:39,942
- [Chuckles]
- What?

929
01:08:40,044 --> 01:08:42,069
There's no "fine" with grandkids.

930
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:46,014
It's either the best day of your life
or sheer torture.

931
01:08:46,117 --> 01:08:49,177
- What do you do together?
- I don't know. We eat.

932
01:08:49,287 --> 01:08:51,187
[Mrs. Lefkowitz]
Huh.! That's it?

933
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:53,382
Oh, do things she likes to do.

934
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:58,554
Read the fashion magazines, surf the Net,
watch the smut on the cable.

935
01:08:58,663 --> 01:09:01,689
- I don't have cable.
- [Mrs. Lefkowitz] No cable?

936
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:04,927
And she wonders why she and the girl
aren't all buddy-buddy.

937
01:09:05,036 --> 01:09:10,338
I don't need television to build
a relationship with my granddaughter.

938
01:09:10,441 --> 01:09:12,534
You're new to this. Trust me.

939
01:09:12,643 --> 01:09:14,611
It's all about surround sound.

940
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:22,713
[Woman On TV] I just needed
a little kiss to make me feel better...

941
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:26,187
but now it wasn't working.

942
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,190
- Maggie!
- Oh!

943
01:09:28,292 --> 01:09:30,886
We're having Cosmopolitans.
Would you like one?

944
01:09:30,995 --> 01:09:34,761
[Woman On TV] I wasn't getting
the same rush. Tonight, I needed more.

945
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:36,766
No, thanks.

946
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:40,269
Meanwhile, uptown, Charlotte wondered
when relationships had gotten so complicated.

947
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:44,740
She yearned for the time when dinner
was followed by dessert, not lubricant.

948
01:09:44,842 --> 01:09:47,402
- [Gags]
- Ooh, whoops!

949
01:09:47,512 --> 01:09:50,379
[All Laughing]

950
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:52,381
[Ella]
Oh, my.

951
01:09:52,483 --> 01:09:55,008
I don't want to. Or maybe I do.
I don't know what I want, but—

952
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:58,577
- I've seen this one.
- [Charlotte] I can't.

953
01:09:58,689 --> 01:10:01,783
- I want children and nice bedding and—
- It's funny.

954
01:10:01,893 --> 01:10:06,159
[Woman] That night, they made love
the Charlotte way—polite—

955
01:10:06,264 --> 01:10:08,164
[Mrs. Lefkowitz]
Oh, it was wonderful.

956
01:10:08,266 --> 01:10:10,166
- I thought so.
- Oh, you would.

957
01:10:10,268 --> 01:10:12,293
- Now, walk up straight now.
- Thank you for everything.

958
01:10:12,403 --> 01:10:14,303
- Good.
- Have a very wonderful day.

959
01:10:14,405 --> 01:10:17,340
- Yes, and have a good sleep, and no sugar.
- Okay. And good night.

960
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:19,876
- Good night.
- Yeah.

961
01:10:19,977 --> 01:10:22,502
[Chuckling]
Well—Yeah, okay.

962
01:10:22,613 --> 01:10:25,207
Okay. Thank you. Good night.

963
01:10:39,797 --> 01:10:41,765
[Water Running]

964
01:10:44,302 --> 01:10:46,770
What's up with Lewis?

965
01:10:46,871 --> 01:10:50,500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

966
01:10:50,608 --> 01:10:53,600
I say go for it. Just jump him.

967
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:55,645
Maggie!

968
01:10:55,746 --> 01:10:58,306
Don't talk like that. Here.

969
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:03,519
Half the fun of sex...
is talking about it.

970
01:11:03,621 --> 01:11:06,522
Well, I guess I missed that half.

971
01:11:06,624 --> 01:11:09,422
You never talked about sex?

972
01:11:09,527 --> 01:11:13,293
[Sighs]
Occasionally with Ira.

973
01:11:13,397 --> 01:11:15,297
Kind of.

974
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:18,266
Yeah, but what about girlfriends?

975
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:20,564
The first time you got laid.

976
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:22,571
You had to tell someone that.

977
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:26,040
It was my wedding night.
It was assumed.

978
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:30,045
You missed out on one of the all-time
greatest conversations in life.

979
01:11:31,315 --> 01:11:33,283
Who'd you tell?

980
01:11:35,019 --> 01:11:36,987
Rose.

981
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:39,386
Well, maybe if I'd had a sister.

982
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:41,958
Even when you were so small...

983
01:11:42,059 --> 01:11:44,584
you had a bond
that I'd never had with anyone.

984
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,062
You still close like that?

985
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,567
Sure.

986
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:54,433
- You don't talk about her.
- What do you want to hear?

987
01:11:56,641 --> 01:11:59,576
We're totally fine. We're-We're tight.
We're thick as thieves.

988
01:11:59,677 --> 01:12:03,135
Let's ask her down.
I'd like to know her too.

989
01:12:03,247 --> 01:12:06,182
You know, I doubt she would come.

990
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:09,378
She's, like, really busy.
She's a lawyer.

991
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:11,055
- No kidding. What kind?
- The really busy kind.

992
01:12:11,055 --> 01:12:13,114
- No kidding. What kind?
- The really busy kind.

993
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,957
[Amy] What do you do
once they've all peed?

994
01:12:17,061 --> 01:12:20,394
[Rose] Hmm. Give 'em a brush.
Take 'em all home.

995
01:12:20,498 --> 01:12:22,966
Make sure they have water to drink.

996
01:12:25,202 --> 01:12:28,729
- After that.
- Then I'm done.

997
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,973
- So what do you do?
- Whatever.

998
01:12:34,078 --> 01:12:38,981
- Shop for food, cook for my boyfriend.
- I know his name.

999
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:43,076
I know, but I've never really had a real,
live, grown-up boyfriend before...

1000
01:12:43,187 --> 01:12:46,179
and I'm gonna use the word
as often as I can.

1001
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:49,157
All right, first of all,
he's not grown up.

1002
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,160
None of them are.

1003
01:12:51,262 --> 01:12:55,858
You know, there's a consistency
to your cynicism which is truly beautiful.

1004
01:12:55,967 --> 01:12:58,094
Hmm. Just don't be surprised...

1005
01:12:58,202 --> 01:13:01,399
if he turns out to be...
less than perfect.

1006
01:13:01,505 --> 01:13:03,973
And don't be surprised if he doesn't.

1007
01:13:06,544 --> 01:13:08,512
- I gotta go.
- Good-bye.

1008
01:13:08,613 --> 01:13:10,513
- Have fun.
- I'll call you.

1009
01:13:10,615 --> 01:13:11,843
All right.

1010
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:16,011
[Old Man] You sound too pretty,
Maggie, to be cleaning bedpans.

1011
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,588
You're right. I am.

1012
01:13:18,689 --> 01:13:22,125
I have a grandson, a doctor over in Tampa.
I should introduce you.

1013
01:13:22,226 --> 01:13:25,320
- [Chuckles] You don't want to do that.
- Are you bad news?

1014
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:29,593
[Sighs] Well, you know,
I don't mean to be, but yeah.

1015
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,158
Well, since you're not gonna
marry my grandson...

1016
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,500
you might as well read to me.

1017
01:13:41,278 --> 01:13:43,439
- I'm kind of a slow reader.
- Perfect.

1018

01:14:08,939 --> 01:14:11,339
- What are you, a teacher?
- Professor.

1023
01:14:11,442 --> 01:14:15,071
Retired.
Just take your time, Maggie.

1024
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:18,342
Listen to the words
as you're about to say them.

1025
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:20,917
Nine times out of 10,
you'll hear a mistake coming...

1026
01:14:21,018 --> 01:14:23,486
and you'll correct it
before you make it.

1027
01:14:23,587 --> 01:14:27,489
Then again, you might make
a total ass of yourself.

1028
01:14:43,808 --> 01:14:46,436
Oh, come on.

1029
01:14:46,544 --> 01:14:49,513

Good.

Unacceptable answer.
What's the poem about?

1067
01:17:24,635 --> 01:17:27,103
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. What's it about?

1068
01:17:30,808 --> 01:17:32,742
- Losing?
- What?

1069
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,880
- Love?
- Ah.

1070
01:17:37,982 --> 01:17:40,314
And how about that?

1071
01:17:41,585 --> 01:17:44,383
Is the love lost already?

1072
01:17:44,488 --> 01:17:47,753
Is Bishop writing about it
as a possibility, a probability?

1073
01:17:47,858 --> 01:17:49,758
What?

1074
01:17:51,395 --> 01:17:53,295
Well...

1075
01:17:54,798 --> 01:17:57,266
in the beginning,
she's talking about...

1076
01:17:57,368 --> 01:18:01,998
Iosing real things, like keys.

1077
01:18:03,374 --> 01:18:07,333
And then she— she gets, like—

1078
01:18:07,444 --> 01:18:09,344
she lost a continent.

1079
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:12,540
- She's getting grandiose.
- Yeah.

1080
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:16,450
And the way she says it is like—
like it doesn't matter.

1081
01:18:16,553 --> 01:18:18,453
Ah.

1082
01:18:18,555 --> 01:18:21,490
Her tone—
would you call it detached?

1083
01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:26,420
I think she wants
to sound detached.

1084
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:30,626
You know,
she wants to... sound...

1085
01:18:30,734 --> 01:18:32,634

01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:38,099
how bad it's gonna feel to lose.

1089
01:18:41,278 --> 01:18:43,678

Is it a lover?

1091

No.

1092
01:18:58,429 --> 01:19:00,397
It's a friend.

01:19:35,499 --> 01:19:37,558
Well, what can I get you?

1099
01:19:37,668 --> 01:19:41,502
- I'll have a white wine, and he'll have the same.
- Oh, good.

1100

Why don't you just make yourself at home,
and I'll be right back.

1101

- Hello, sweetie.

1102
01:19:48,245 --> 01:19:50,145
- Oh!
- Where's Maggie?

1103
01:19:50,247 --> 01:19:53,739
- Oh, not here.
- Oh, thank God. We don't need
her drama tonight.

1104
01:19:53,851 --> 01:19:57,753
- Why isn't she here? Is something wrong?
- No, we just had a fight.

1105
01:19:57,855 --> 01:20:01,416
- About what?
- Can we talk about this later?

1106
01:20:01,525 --> 01:20:04,756
Yes. Bad enough she monopolizes
the evening when she's here.

1107
01:20:04,862 --> 01:20:07,490
Oh, let me see that ring.

as well, Sydelle.

You'll love her. Everyone does.

She's an absolute genius in her work.

Please. To Rose and Simon.

We're all blessed to be a part
of your happiness.

Your love bonds
notjust your two hearts...

1118
01:20:41,899 --> 01:20:44,697
but the hearts of two families.

- [All] Mazel tov!

1120

- Yeah.

Where's Maggie?

1123
01:20:54,011 --> 01:20:56,479
Uh, it's hard to say.
She moves around a lot.

1124
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,708
Well, I want to meet her eventually,
you know? She's your sister.

1125
01:20:59,817 --> 01:21:02,718
- I want to know her.
- You will.

1126
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:05,050
What was the fight about?

1127
01:21:05,155 --> 01:21:07,123
Mmm. Girl stuff.

1128
01:21:14,398 --> 01:21:16,298
Oh, shit.

1129
01:21:17,835 --> 01:21:19,769
Oh.!

1130
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:23,237
I should have used fresh vegetables
instead of frozen.

1131
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,638
[Ella]
I don't think so. They were great.

1132
01:21:25,742 --> 01:21:28,336
- Really delicious. They were good.
- Really?

1133
01:21:28,445 --> 01:21:30,345
Yes.

1134
01:21:30,447 --> 01:21:34,315
- So, have you heard from Rose?
- No.

1135
01:21:34,418 --> 01:21:37,080
- So she hasn't gotten back to you.
- About what?

1136
01:21:37,187 --> 01:21:39,678
You were going
to invite her down, Maggie.

1137
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:41,758
I don't know
where you got that idea.

1138
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:44,987
Maggie,
I specifically asked you to.

1139
01:21:45,095 --> 01:21:48,929
So? Just because you specifically asked
doesn't mean I'm going to.

1140
01:21:49,032 --> 01:21:52,399
You shouldn't smoke.
You have a family history of lung cancer.

1141
01:21:52,503 --> 01:21:54,596
I have a family history
of car wrecks too.

1142
01:21:54,705 --> 01:21:57,105
Does that mean I shouldn't drive?

1143
01:21:57,207 --> 01:21:59,505
- That is not funny.
- It wasn't supposed to be.

1144
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,874
All right, what is the problem
between you and Rose?

1145
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:05,278
- Why don't you want her to visit?
- Why do you?

1146
01:22:05,382 --> 01:22:07,942
I mean,
am I not good enough for you?

1147
01:22:08,051 --> 01:22:10,645
This has nothing to do with you.

1148
01:22:10,754 --> 01:22:13,780
She's my daughter's daughter,
and I want to get to know her too.

What was Caroline like with you girls?

1151
01:22:32,743 --> 01:22:35,644
I mean, as a mom,
how do you remember her?

1152
01:22:35,746 --> 01:22:37,907
Why don't you ask Rose?

1153
01:22:38,015 --> 01:22:41,348
Maggie, please grow up.

1154
01:22:47,457 --> 01:22:49,357
She was special.

1155
01:22:49,459 --> 01:22:51,859
Different than the other moms.

1156
01:22:51,962 --> 01:22:53,930
She used to surprise us.

1157
01:22:56,733 --> 01:22:59,566
One time I opened up
my lunch box...

1158
01:23:00,671 --> 01:23:03,902
and there was a tiara inside.

1159
01:23:04,007 --> 01:23:06,532
A tiara. With your sandwich?

1160
01:23:06,643 --> 01:23:08,543
Instead of a sandwich.

1161
01:23:10,414 --> 01:23:12,882
What was she like as a daughter?

1162
01:23:14,117 --> 01:23:16,017
No tiaras.

1163
01:23:18,755 --> 01:23:21,781
But I loved her so much.

1164
01:23:25,329 --> 01:23:28,958
But loving her in the right way
was difficult, for me, anyway.

1165
01:23:29,066 --> 01:23:31,762
I didn't know there was
a right way and a wrong way.

1166
01:23:31,868 --> 01:23:33,836
Neither did I.

1167
01:23:35,005 --> 01:23:37,701
I had ideas—

1168
01:23:37,808 --> 01:23:41,608
I had unwelcomed ideas
about how to keep her safe.

1169
01:23:41,712 --> 01:23:43,976
Like?

1170
01:23:44,081 --> 01:23:47,380
Like, I thought she should have been
on her medication all the time.

1171
01:23:47,484 --> 01:23:49,816
I thought that her relationship
with your father...

1172
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,252
was far too passionate
for her to handle.

1173
01:23:52,356 --> 01:23:54,324
And as far as children
were concerned...

1174
01:23:54,424 --> 01:23:57,552
she was in no condition,
no condition at all.

1175
01:23:57,661 --> 01:24:00,494
So you wish she never had me.

1176
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:05,301
You know what I wish, Maggie?

1177
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:09,899
I wish I'd kept my big mouth
shut long enough...

01:38:23,986 --> 01:38:25,647
Gin.

1355
01:38:48,877 --> 01:38:50,708
[Gasps]

1356
01:38:50,813 --> 01:38:52,781
[Knocking]

1357
01:38:54,683 --> 01:38:57,243
- Oh, no.
- Dad?

1358
01:38:58,454 --> 01:39:00,422
- Dad?
- You are not welcome here!

1359
01:39:00,522 --> 01:39:03,320
- Rose? You all right?
- Are you kidding?

1360
01:39:03,425 --> 01:39:07,020
I'm fantastic. Turns out I have
a grandmother I never knew about.

1361
01:39:07,129 --> 01:39:09,256
It was in your own best interest.
Your father thought—

1362
01:39:09,364 --> 01:39:12,891
Why are you speaking? You do not
have any place in this conversation.

1363
01:39:13,001 --> 01:39:17,665
- Excuse me, miss. This is my house.
- Sydelle. Please.

1364
01:39:24,947 --> 01:39:26,915
How did she find you?

1365
01:39:28,116 --> 01:39:30,812
How did she lose me?

1366
01:39:32,721 --> 01:39:35,189
She said she sent birthday cards.

1367
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:37,656
Please tell me you never got 'em.

1368
01:39:39,394 --> 01:39:43,296
Our mother was dead,
our father was practically catatonic.

1369
01:39:43,398 --> 01:39:47,459
- A grandmother might have come in handy.
- She was impossible, Rose.

1370
01:39:47,569 --> 01:39:52,336
Bossy, self-righteous, nosy about things
that weren't her business.

1371
01:39:52,441 --> 01:39:55,501
- Like what?
- Trust me. We were better off without her.

1372
01:39:55,611 --> 01:39:57,511
Because she was bossy?
That doesn't make any sense.

1373
01:39:57,613 --> 01:40:00,309
I didn't want to be around that,
and I didn't want you around it.

1374
01:40:00,415 --> 01:40:02,315
- What?
- The judgment. The blame.

1375
01:40:02,417 --> 01:40:05,352
- For what? What-What'd she blame you for?
- Everything.

1376
01:40:05,454 --> 01:40:07,786
- What everything?
- Just everything.

1377
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:10,620
- Dad!
- For your mother, all right?

1378
01:40:10,726 --> 01:40:12,694
For her death.

1379
01:40:16,698 --> 01:40:19,360
- She said that?
- She didn't have to.

1380
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:26,539
She wanted her protected
all the time. Drugged.

1381
01:40:26,642 --> 01:40:29,805
But Caroline—
she didn't want to live that way.

1382
01:40:29,912 --> 01:40:32,210
It made her foggy.

1383
01:40:32,314 --> 01:40:35,078
She couldn't take it
if she was pregnant.

1384
01:40:35,183 --> 01:40:38,880
So... we hoped it would be enough—

1385
01:40:38,987 --> 01:40:42,787
loving each other,
loving you and Maggie.

1386
01:40:44,826 --> 01:40:47,454
There were so many good days.

1387
01:40:48,664 --> 01:40:51,656
We thought it would be okay.

1388
01:40:51,767 --> 01:40:54,463
Oh, God.

1389
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:56,538
I'm sorry, Rosie.

1390
01:40:57,839 --> 01:40:59,898
I'm so sorry.

1391
01:41:00,008 --> 01:41:03,466
[Ella]
Now, um...

1392
01:41:03,579 --> 01:41:07,413
the only opening on Thursday
she has is 5:00.

1393
01:41:07,516 --> 01:41:09,416
- P.M.?
- Yes.

1394
01:41:09,518 --> 01:41:12,282
- That's right in the middle of dinner.
- Well, take it or leave it.

1395
01:41:12,387 --> 01:41:15,447
- I'll take it if she won't.
- I'll take it. I'll take it.

1396
01:41:15,557 --> 01:41:17,047
- "Mrs. Stempel."
- Ella.

1397
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:21,061
Lewis! Are you looking
for a personal shopper too?

1398
01:41:21,163 --> 01:41:23,927
[Chuckling]
No. A date, to the Tea Dance.

1399
01:41:24,032 --> 01:41:26,830
And I'd be honored
if you'd go with me.

1400
01:41:29,538 --> 01:41:33,474
- I'd love to.
- Pick you up at 4:00.

1401
01:41:36,745 --> 01:41:40,875
- Lewis Feldman.
- Ooh.

1402
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:53,151
This place just keeps
getting better and better.

1403
01:42:08,443 --> 01:42:10,968
[Humming]

1404
01:42:12,514 --> 01:42:14,482
[Gasps]

1405
01:42:16,618 --> 01:42:18,586
What are you doing here?

1406
01:42:21,857 --> 01:42:23,950
I live here.
What are you doing here?

1407
01:42:24,059 --> 01:42:26,755
You live here?
In an old folks home?

1408
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:31,260
It's a retirement community
for active seniors.

1409
01:42:31,366 --> 01:42:34,631
Wait, so you—
you live with our grandmother?

1410
01:42:37,673 --> 01:42:40,198
How'd you find out about her?

1411
01:42:40,308 --> 01:42:44,267
I can't believe she wrote you
without telling me.

1412
01:42:46,248 --> 01:42:48,216
It's so sneaky.

1413
01:42:49,551 --> 01:42:52,645
Does it offend
your strict moral code?

1414
01:42:56,024 --> 01:42:58,288
So, how's it going for you down here?

1415
01:42:58,393 --> 01:43:01,851
Who's buying your cocktails?

1416
01:43:01,963 --> 01:43:03,931
No one.

1417
01:43:04,032 --> 01:43:06,626
Oh, no.
Is your mojo failing you already?

1418
01:43:06,735 --> 01:43:08,635
My mojo's fine.

1419
01:43:08,737 --> 01:43:11,399
I just haven't felt like drinking.

1420
01:43:11,506 --> 01:43:14,669
Right. Probably haven't
felt like stealing...

1421
01:43:14,776 --> 01:43:18,576
or lying or having sex
with inappropriate partners either.

1422
01:43:20,582 --> 01:43:24,643
- Did you come down here just to abuse me?
- [Door Shuts]

1423
01:43:24,753 --> 01:43:27,313
Maggie.! I hope you are prepared
to be exceedingly rich...

1424
01:43:27,422 --> 01:43:29,390
because I booked you within an—

1425
01:43:31,593 --> 01:43:33,493
Rose. Oh.

1426
01:43:36,998 --> 01:43:38,989
Oh, Rose.

1427
01:43:39,101 --> 01:43:41,126
Look at you.

1428
01:43:41,236 --> 01:43:43,568
Oh, look how lovely you are. Oh.

1429
01:43:43,672 --> 01:43:45,572
[Laughing]

1430
01:43:47,209 --> 01:43:49,905
Oh. Do you remember me?

1431
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,714
Yeah.

1432
01:43:53,815 --> 01:43:55,840
I remember you too.

1433
01:43:55,951 --> 01:43:57,919
You-You're exactly the same.

1434
01:43:58,019 --> 01:44:00,544
Smiley and huggable and—

1435
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:03,885
- Ooh, and engaged?
- What?

1436
01:44:03,992 --> 01:44:05,892
Oh, yeah.

1437
01:44:05,994 --> 01:44:09,794
- Holy shit. To who?
- No one you know.

1438
01:44:09,898 --> 01:44:11,889
Champagne. Now, come with me.

1439
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,696
Tell me all about it.

1440
01:44:18,006 --> 01:44:21,464
I can't believe you're marrying
somebody I haven't even met.

1441
01:44:26,314 --> 01:44:28,305
What's he like anyhow?

1442
01:44:31,953 --> 01:44:34,251
Why? You want to screw him too?

1443
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:41,458
I don't expect you to forgive me, Rose...

1444
01:44:45,734 --> 01:44:47,702
but I am sorry.

1445
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:57,169
[Squeaky Horn Tooting]

1446
01:44:57,279 --> 01:44:59,747
- [Maggie] Careful, Mrs. Haskell.
- I'm always careful!

1447
01:44:59,848 --> 01:45:03,375
She hit somebody last week.
It was a big to-do.

1448
01:45:03,485 --> 01:45:07,285
And there's a store where you can buy
eight different kinds of hemorrhoid creams.

1449
01:45:07,389 --> 01:45:09,653
All right.
Here come the Queen Bees.

1450
01:45:09,758 --> 01:45:13,250
Widows. They run the place.
Oh, watch out.

1451
01:45:13,361 --> 01:45:15,989
- Hello, ladies! This is my sister.
- Maggie.

1452
01:45:16,097 --> 01:45:17,997
- Hi.
- Hi, Maggie.

1453
01:45:18,099 --> 01:45:20,067
Yep. Have a good day.

1454
01:45:21,703 --> 01:45:24,399
This is the exercise pavilion.
Hey, guys!

1455
01:45:24,506 --> 01:45:26,474
- Hi, Maggie.
- This is my sister, Rose.

1456
01:45:26,575 --> 01:45:28,941
Hello, Rose!

1457
01:45:29,044 --> 01:45:32,309
[Man] Good, Lydia. A good stretch.
That's it. And left.

1458
01:45:32,414 --> 01:45:34,314
Looking good, Mrs. Klein.

1459
01:45:34,416 --> 01:45:36,316
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi, ladies.

1460
01:45:36,418 --> 01:45:38,818
Hi!

1461
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:41,855
I call these guys The Bench.
They're all former lawyers.

1462
01:45:41,957 --> 01:45:45,586
- Gentlemen! Hey.
- Hi, Maggie.

1463
01:45:45,694 --> 01:45:48,788
This is my sister, Rose.
She's a lawyer, too, from Philadelphia.

1464
01:45:48,897 --> 01:45:51,866
- Which firm?
- Uh, actually, no firm right now.

1465
01:45:51,967 --> 01:45:55,459
I'm just... taking some time off.

1466
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:58,038
- Me too.
- [Laughing]

1467
01:46:05,247 --> 01:46:08,341
- What are you doing, Ella?
- Sit down, girls.

1468
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:13,012
I've got some things here
I thought you might like to see.

1469
01:46:13,121 --> 01:46:16,056
- Whoa.
- Oh, God.

1470
01:46:16,157 --> 01:46:18,057
- [Chuckles]
- Look at you.

1471
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:20,719
- These are great.
- Hey, look. Our old living room.

1472
01:46:20,829 --> 01:46:22,922
Mm-hmm.

1473
01:46:23,031 --> 01:46:24,828
Oh, God.

1474
01:46:24,933 --> 01:46:28,164
Could Mom have been any prettier?

1475
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:30,932
Oh, you look exactly like her.
Doesn't she?

1476
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:34,475
- I wonder if there's a picture of Honey Bun.
- That'd be pretty impossible.

1477
01:46:34,576 --> 01:46:36,203
- Who's Honey Bun?
- Our dog.

1478
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:38,006
- You had a dog?
- For one day.

1479
01:46:38,113 --> 01:46:40,946
The greatest day.

1480
01:46:41,049 --> 01:46:43,847
Mom woke us up really early.
It was a school day. It was still dark out.

1481
01:46:43,952 --> 01:46:45,852
It was winter.

1482
01:46:45,954 --> 01:46:49,856
And she put us in our best party dresses and
dragged us down to the kitchen, which was—

1483
01:46:49,958 --> 01:46:52,449
- A mess.
- Covered, every counter, in fudge.

1484
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,357
She'd been up all night making it.

1485
01:46:54,462 --> 01:46:58,091
We loaded it into the car,
and she drove us right past school...

1486
01:46:58,199 --> 01:47:00,167
straight up to New York,
to Lord & Taylor.

1487
01:47:00,268 --> 01:47:02,736
Which was closed, because we got there
at 8:00 in the morning.

1488
01:47:02,837 --> 01:47:05,806
- That's right, and we hung out in the car.
- Eating fudge for breakfast.

1489
01:47:05,907 --> 01:47:08,967
Mom had heard about Mrs. Fields.
You know, the cookie lady?

1490
01:47:09,077 --> 01:47:12,308
And she figured that her fudge
was just as good as those cookies, so—

1491
01:47:12,414 --> 01:47:14,382
So she was gonna make a fortune.

1492
01:47:14,482 --> 01:47:19,283
When it finally opened, we went in
and, oh, God, she was so beautiful.

1493
01:47:19,387 --> 01:47:22,914
- She was wearing this long, velvety gown.
- At 8:00 in the morning?

1494
01:47:23,024 --> 01:47:25,754
Well, by this time it was 10:00.

1495
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:28,954
I guess she talked to some of the store people
about the fudge, but I don't remember.

1496
01:47:29,064 --> 01:47:31,862
Mmm, she spilled it,
all over the jewelry counter.

1497
01:47:31,967 --> 01:47:36,495
- There was a guy who just kind of looked at her.
- I don't remember a guy.

1498
01:47:36,604 --> 01:47:39,471
There was a guy,
and he looked at her.

1499
01:47:41,176 --> 01:47:44,839
Anyway, Mom said that we could
each get one present.

1500
01:47:44,946 --> 01:47:47,506
- And you got—
- A Nancy Drew book.

1501
01:47:47,615 --> 01:47:50,948
I asked for a puppy. And she got it!

1502
01:47:51,052 --> 01:47:54,749
[Sighs] He was so cute.
I named him Honey Bun.

1503
01:47:54,856 --> 01:47:57,791
Why'd you only have it for one day?

1504
01:47:57,892 --> 01:48:00,793
- I guess Dad thought it was a bad idea.
- [Ella] Why?

1505
01:48:00,895 --> 01:48:04,126
I don't know. I think he thought
I was too young.

1506
01:48:04,232 --> 01:48:06,291
No. He was just mad.

1507
01:48:06,401 --> 01:48:11,134
- About a dog?
- No, about the whole day.

1508
01:48:11,239 --> 01:48:15,300
He didn't have any idea where we were,
and school had called.

1509
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:18,140
- Oh.
- Really?

1510
01:48:18,246 --> 01:48:22,205
Yeah. He was really panicked
and really, really mad at her.

1511
01:48:22,317 --> 01:48:24,285
They had a huge fight.

1512
01:48:24,386 --> 01:48:27,378
I don't remember a fight.

1513
01:48:27,489 --> 01:48:30,515
You were in your room
with a record playing.

1514
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:32,684
- I was?
- Yeah.

1515
01:48:32,794 --> 01:48:36,958
I put you in there and turned the music on
so you wouldn't hear them.

1516
01:48:37,065 --> 01:48:40,694
[Ella]
Why? What were they saying?
