1
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,171
<i>In our relations with other people, </i>

2
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:50,340
<i>we mainly discuss and evaluate</i>

3
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,078
<i>their character and behavior. </i>

4
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:58,649
<i>That is why I have withdrawn</i>

5
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,420
<i>from nearly all so-called relations. </i>

6
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:07,595
<i>This has made my old age</i>
<i>rather lonely. </i>

7
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:15,130
<i>My life has been full of hard work, </i>
<i>and I am grateful. </i>

8
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,971
<i>It began as toil</i>
<i>for bread and butter</i>

9
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,845
<i>and ended in a love for science. </i>

10
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:29,150
<i>I have a son, also a doctor, </i>
<i>who lives in Lund. </i>

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:34,249
<i>He has been married for many years. </i>
<i>They have no children. </i>

12
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:40,922
<i>My old mother is still alive</i>
<i>and is very active, in spite of her age. </i>

13
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,873
<i>My wife Karin</i>
<i>has been dead for many years. </i>

14
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,276
Dinner is served, Professor Borg.

15
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,910
Thank you.

16
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,216
<i>I am lucky</i>
<i>in having a good housekeeper. </i>

17
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:08,825
<i>Perhaps I should add</i>
<i>that I am an old pedant, </i>

18
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:13,159
<i>which at times</i>
<i>has been rather trying</i>

19
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:18,226
<i>for myself and those around me. </i>

20
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,571
<i>My name is Isak Borg, </i>

21
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,945
<i>and I am 78.</i>

22
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:33,508
<i>Tomorrow I shall receive</i>
<i>an honorary degree in Lund Cathedral. </i>

23
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:52,167
WI LD STRAWBERRI ES

24
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,197
<i>In the early hours ofJune 1 st, </i>

25
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:00,398
<i>I had a weird</i>
<i>and very unpleasant dream. </i>

26
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,766
<i>I dreamt that during</i>
<i>my morning walk</i>

27
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:10,406
<i>I lost my way among empty streets</i>

28
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,007
<i>with ruined houses. </i>

29
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,488
Are you ill?

30
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,328
Miss Agda, please prepare
some breakfast. I'm taking the car.

31
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,666
Please, Professor! Go back to bed
and I'll bring you coffee at 9:00,

32
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,071
and we'll leave at 10:00 as planned.

33
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,507
Oh, well, I'll go without breakfast.

34
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,608
And who will pack your tails?

35
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,750
- I will do it myself.
- And what about me?

36
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,752
You can come in the car or fly.
Please yourself.

37
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:58,489
I've looked forward to seeing you get
your honorary degree.

38
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,466
And we had arranged
everything so nicely,

39
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,867
and now you're taking the car.

40
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,600
The ceremony isn't until 5:00.

41
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,235
If I leave at once, I've got 14 hours
before the ceremony.

42
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,813
You'll ruin everything!

43
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,542
What about your son who is expecting you
at the airport in Malmõ?

44
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,611
You can think up an explanation.

45
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,653
If you go by car,
I won't come at all.

46
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,090
Now listen, Miss Agda!

47
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:38,227
Take the car, and you'll ruin
the greatest day of my life.

48
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,771
We're not married, Miss Agda.

49
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:45,435
I thank God for that every night.

50
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:50,004
I've used my common sense for 74 years,
and it won't let me down now.

51
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,607
Is that your last word?

52
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,652
Yes.

53
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:02,351
But I shall say plenty to myself
about selfish, crabby old men

54
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:08,024
who never think of those who have
served them faithfully for 40 years.

55
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,126
Incredible that I have put up...

56
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:16,106
with your bossing for so long.

57
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,644
Just give the word,
and I'll leave tomorrow.

58
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:25,183
I'm going by car anyway,
and you can do as you damn well please.

59
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:38,019
I happen to be grown-up
and needn't take orders from you.

60
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,563
No one can pack like you, Miss Agda.

61
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,468
Really?

62
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,008
Old sourpuss.

63
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,043
Shall I boil you a couple of eggs?

64
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:56,581
Yes, please, if you will be
so extremely kind.

65
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:06,954
The faculty should have made me
honorary idiot.

66
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,396
I'll calm the old girl down
with a present.

67
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,196
I hate resentful people.

68
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:21,899
I wouldn't hurt a fly,
let alone Miss Agda.

69
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,602
Toast?

70
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,905
No, don't trouble yourself
on my account.

71
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,913
What are <i>you</i> cross about?

72
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,349
Don't you want a cup?

73
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,060
Good morning, Uncle Isak.

74
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,863
Well, well, why is my daughter-in-law
up at this hour?

75
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,564
Who can sleep when you and Aunt Agda
are making such a row?

76
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,970
There has been no row.

77
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,770
No, not at all.

78
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,703
You're taking the car to Lund?

79
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,838
Yes.

80
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,677
Can I come with you?

81
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,308
You're going home?

82
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,251
Yes, I want to go home.

83
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,084
Home to Evald?

84
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,817
You don't need to ask why.

85
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,587
I would take the train
if I could afford it.

86
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,958
Of course you may ride with me.

87
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,587
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

88
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,793
Good heavens!

89
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:57,535
Please don't smoke.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.

90
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,035
I forgot.

91
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,437
There should be a law
forbidding women to smoke.

92
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,904
Beautiful weather.

93
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,810
Yes, but sultry.

94
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,050
- I think we'll have a thunderstorm.
- So do I.

95
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,778
No, give me a cigar anytime.

96
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,185
That's stimulating and relaxing.
That's a vice for men.

97
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,258
And what vices may a woman have?

98
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,487
Weeping, giving birth
and speaking ill of her neighbors.

99
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,360
How old are you really, Uncle Isak?

100
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,830
Why do you ask?

101
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,696
No reason. Why?

102
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,703
I know why you asked.

103
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,830
Oh, well.

104
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:41,169
Don't pretend.
You don't like me. You never have.

105
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,714
I only know you
as a father-in-law.

106
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,807
Why are you going home?

107
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,818
On impulse. Nothing more.

108
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,184
Evald happens to be my son.

109
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,722
So he is.

110
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,282
Evald and I are very much alike.
We have our principles.

111
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,259
You don't need to tell me <i>that. </i>

112
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,762
Now, this loan, for instance.

113
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,729
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

114
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,529
He should have paid it back
when he became an associate professor.

115
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,196
It's a matter of honor for him
to pay back 5,000 a year,

116
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,636
and so on, and so on.

117
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,674
A promise is a promise.

118
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,608
For us, it means
that we never can be free together,

119
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,611
and that your son
works himself to death.

120
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,079
You have your own income.

121
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,047
Especially when one considers
the fact that you're filthy rich

122
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,516
and don't need the money.

123
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:26,216
A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.

124
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,693
Perhaps.
But he also hates you.

125
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,508
What do you have against me?

126
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,304
Shall I be frank?

127
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,742
Yes, I'm asking you.

128
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,607
You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.

129
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:55,176
You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.

130
00:15:56,255 --> 00:16:01,249
But you hide it all behind
your old-world manners and charm.

131
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:07,756
Beneath your benevolent exterior,
you're as hard as nails.

132
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:13,070
But you can't fool us
who have seen you at close quarters.

133
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,604
Remember when
I came to you a month ago?

134
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,178
I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.

135
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,749
So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.

136
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,318
Remember what you answered?

137
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,445
I said I'd be delighted.

138
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,160
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but you said,

139
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,289
´´Don't try to draw me
into your marital squabbles.

140
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,127
I don't give a damn.

141
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,225
You and Evald must make
the best of it. ''

142
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,894
Did I say that?

143
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,270
- Not only that.
- Oh, no.

144
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,070
These were your very words:

145
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,309
´´I have no respect
for mental suffering,

146
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,347
so don't come lamenting to <i>me. </i>

147
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,881
If you need therapy,
you'd better see a shrink.

148
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:05,582
Or why not a minister?
It's in fashion now. ''

149
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,420
Did I say that?

150
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:11,119
Your judgments are very categorical,
Uncle Isak.

151
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,631
I should hate to depend on you.

152
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,964
I have liked having you
about the house.

153
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,770
Like a cat.

154
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,243
A cat or a human being.

155
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:32,579
You're a fine young woman,
and I'm sorry you dislike me.

156
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,346
- I don't dislike you.
- Really?

157
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,684
- I feel sorry for you.
- Sorry?

158
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,421
I'd like to tell you about a dream
I had this morning.

159
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,830
I'm not very interested in dreams.

160
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:52,802
No. No, of course not.

161
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,975
Where are you going now?

162
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,647
I want to show you something.

163
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:49,151
We lived here every summer
during the first 20 years of my life.

164
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,822
There were ten of us children.
Perhaps you knew that.

165
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,823
Does anyone live here now?

166
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,663
No, not this summer.

167
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,469
I'll go swimming, if you don't mind.
We have plenty of time.

168
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,100
Yes, by all means, do.

169
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,991
The place where
wild strawberries grow!

170
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:38,073
<i>Perhaps I got a little sentimental. </i>

171
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,041
<i>Perhaps I got a little tired</i>

172
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,741
<i>and felt a bit sad. </i>

173
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:51,687
<i>It</i>'<i>s not impossible that I began</i>
<i>to think of this and that, </i>

174
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,453
<i>associated with places</i>
<i>where I played as a child. </i>

175
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,229
<i>I don</i>'<i>t know how it happened, </i>

176
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,756
<i>but the day</i>'<i>s clear reality</i>

177
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:08,033
<i>dissolved into the even clearer</i>
<i>images of memory</i>

178
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,631
<i>that appeared before my eyes</i>

179
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,609
<i>with the strength</i>
<i>of a true stream of events. </i>

180
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:31,891
Sara.

181
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,628
Sara,

182
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,702
it's your cousin Isak.

183
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,434
Well, I've become quite old,
of course, so I don't look the same.

184
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:53,246
But you, you haven't changed at all.

185
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,092
Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?

186
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,389
Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?

187
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,992
And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries

188
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,866
picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?

189
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,371
Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aron's name day today.

190
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,840
I forgot to make a present.

191
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,571
So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.

192
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,839
I'll help you.

193
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,474
You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,

194
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,313
and Anna has painted
a really good picture,

195
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,445
and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.

196
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,581
That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.

197
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,525
He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.

198
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,062
And you have a darned cute nape.

199
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,057
You know you shouldn't do that.

200
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,659
- Says who?
<i>- I</i> say.

201
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,467
Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man

202
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,234
who thinks he's really something.

203
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,674
I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.

204
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,840
With you!

205
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,939
Come and be kissed on the lips.

206
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:03,247
If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.

207
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,882
Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.

208
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,357
You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.

209
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:14,159
So secretly, everyone knows it.

210
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,292
It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.

211
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,395
When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?

212
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:27,378
I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,

213
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,845
but I think it's Isak.

214
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,506
Isak is the nicest, anyway.

215
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,278
And you're the horridest, nastiest,

216
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:39,255
silliest, stupidest...
I can't find the words to describe you!

217
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,452
Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.

218
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,927
And you reek of cigars.

219
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,793
It's a nice manly smell.

220
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,827
And the twins,
who know <i>most</i> things,

221
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:57,773
say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.

222
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:03,246
She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.

223
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,715
How pretty you are
when you blush.

224
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,083
You <i>must</i> kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.

225
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:14,557
Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.

226
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,854
- You're just saying that.
- No.

227
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,860
And the twins say

228
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,095
that you're <i>mad</i> about girls.

229
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,930
Is that true?

230
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,376
Oh, look what you've done!

231
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,751
And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?

232
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,418
I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!

233
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,531
You've made
a bad woman of me.

234
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,658
At any rate, <i>nearly. </i>

235
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,329
I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.

236
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,264
I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.

237
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,940
Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!

238
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:40,903
Where's Isak?

239
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:46,414
Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.

240
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:52,479
Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.

241
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,569
In Jesus' name
we take our seat.

242
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,112
Bless, O Lord,
this food we eat. Amen.

243
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,083
Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.

244
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,092
How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?

245
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,718
I <i>have. </i>

246
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,261
Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.

247
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:12,734
Your fingernails are filthy.

248
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,104
Hagbart, pass the bread.

249
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,270
Don't take so much butter.

250
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:24,371
Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.

251
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,575
How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?

252
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,950
It's <i>paint</i> under my nails.

253
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,852
Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?

254
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,448
- I did.
- What?

255
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,624
Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.

256
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,564
I did!

257
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:46,296
Fancy your remembering
my name day.

258
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,634
How kind of you.

259
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:53,639
Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?

260
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,441
Never when Papa is not at home.

261
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:00,548
Uncle has already had three drinks.

262
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,554
We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.

263
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,954
So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.

264
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,856
Twins, speak when spoken to.

265
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,921
And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.

266
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,167
You will do as Auntie says.

267
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,966
Benjamin, don't bite your nails.

268
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:25,600
Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.

269
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,610
I want to give Uncle my picture.

270
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,476
Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?

271
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,345
- Where is your present?
- Under the table.

272
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,145
No, after we've eaten.

273
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:40,186
A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.

274
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,159
You can't tell which is Fritjof!

275
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:49,529
What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
in the wild strawberry patch?

276
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,501
We saw you! We saw you!

277
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:55,266
The twins ought to be muzzled.

278
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,466
The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.

279
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,099
No freedom of speech, eh?

280
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,110
Shut up, you brats.

281
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,272
Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!

282
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,343
Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!

283
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,319
Quiet, everybody!

284
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,283
But Sara!

285
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,362
They're lying! They're lying!

286
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:50,050
Isak is so fine and good,

287
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:55,460
so moral and sensitive.

288
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,695
He wants us to read poetry

289
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,535
and talk about the next life

290
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,200
and play four-handed piano.

291
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,312
And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,

292
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,211
and he talks about sin.

293
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,981
He's on such a terribly high level,

294
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,814
and I feel so worthless.

295
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,057
And I <i>am</i> worthless...
there's no denying it.

296
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:33,196
But sometimes it seems to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,

297
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,568
if you know what I mean.

298
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:40,235
And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.

299
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:46,748
And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.

300
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,012
I don't want to be here all summer

301
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,645
and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.

302
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,747
I don't want to!

303
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,088
I'll speak to Sigfrid.

304
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,661
If he doesn't behave,

305
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:00,196
I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.

306
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,959
Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.

307
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,001
He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.

308
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,595
Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.

309
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,468
How unfair everything is.

310
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,273
All will be well, you'll see.

311
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,441
Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.

312
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:26,054
How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.

313
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,784
How typical of the twins.

314
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:32,795
F<i>lowers nod, grasses bow</i>

315
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:38,358
<i>Around our lovely house</i>

316
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:44,032
<i>We our Uncle Aron celebrate</i>

317
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,110
<i>And with our song</i>

318
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:50,580
<i>Ornament his brow</i>

319
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,979
Four cheers for Uncle Aron.

320
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:59,182
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

321
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,796
I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.

322
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,390
You do that.

323
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:16,831
<i>I was overwhelmed by feelings</i>
<i>of emptiness and sadness, </i>

324
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,905
<i>but was soon awakened</i>
<i>from my reveries</i>

325
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,447
<i>by the voice of a young girl</i>
<i>asking me repeatedly about something. </i>

326
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,381
Is this your house?

327
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,578
No, it's not.

328
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,019
You're lucky to be telling the truth.

329
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,956
It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.

330
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,961
I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.

331
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,361
Oh, yeah?

332
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,997
- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.

333
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,229
Looks antique.

334
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:49,170
Yes, it's antique, like its owner.

335
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:54,310
So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.

336
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,437
Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?

337
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,378
Well, I'm going to Lund.

338
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,111
But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.

339
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,949
I'm honored.

340
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,387
My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?

341
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,824
My name's Isak.
It's silly too.

342
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,190
Weren't they married?

343
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:16,131
No, unfortunately.
That was Abraham and Sara.

344
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,360
Let's leave, then.

345
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:21,302
I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.

346
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,273
- Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.

347
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,343
We're going to have company
as far as Lund.

348
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,403
Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.

349
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,678
Ironic again, but it suits you.

350
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:35,975
Let's be off.

351
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,988
Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.

352
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:50,056
That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.

353
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,871
That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.

354
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,137
What a big bus.

355
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,179
Yes, there's room for us all.

356
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:07,411
Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.

357
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,770
I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.

358
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,634
We're crazy about each other.

359
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,006
Viktor's the chaperone.
Daddy insisted.

360
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:38,304
Viktor is in love with me too.

361
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,283
It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.

362
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,844
I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.

363
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,390
I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.

364
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,520
And I smoke a pipe.

365
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,727
Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.

366
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,572
I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.

367
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,073
No! She was like me, wasn't she?

368
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,077
She was, actually.

369
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,737
What happened to her?

370
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:14,216
She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.

371
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:18,254
She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.

372
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,984
I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.

373
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:26,625
Oh, dear,
now I <i>have</i> put my foot in it.

374
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,474
Are you all right?

375
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,602
I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.

376
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:20,673
My wife was driving.
Are you all right?

377
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:26,947
The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.

378
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,527
That's my wife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.

379
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,495
That's the complication
we were discussing when...

380
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,759
Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.

381
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,530
I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.

382
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,971
I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.

383
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:49,240
God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?

384
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,339
Let's get your car upright.

385
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,214
- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.

386
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:59,779
Some people are unselfish,
though <i>you</i> don't think so.

387
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,626
My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.

388
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:13,301
Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,

389
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:19,172
straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.

390
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:28,215
Darling, you might have a stroke.

391
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,321
My wife likes ridiculing me.

392
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,325
I let her.
It's psychotherapy.

393
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:44,587
I never know whether my wife
is really crying or just playacting.

394
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,598
I'll be damned if it isn't real.

395
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,267
It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.

396
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,396
Can't you shut up?

397
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,236
My wife can really <i>live</i> a part.

398
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:02,568
For two years,
she made me think she had cancer

399
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,241
and plagued us
with every possible symptom,

400
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,183
even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.

401
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:15,055
Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!

402
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,354
It's natural that you're upset,

403
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,895
but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?

404
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,363
A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?

405
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,594
Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.

406
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:31,737
You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.

407
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,537
So you can <i>afford</i> to defend her.

408
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,102
I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.

409
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,341
Very sarcastic!

410
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,850
Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.

411
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,021
But little Berit is.

412
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,585
Do you know
what that means for me?

413
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,490
I gather you're a Catholic.

414
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,028
Quite right.
That's how I stand it.

415
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,462
We ridicule each other.

416
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,830
She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.

417
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,166
So, you see,
we need each other.

418
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,366
It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.

419
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,677
There it came.

420
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:20,018
That's what is called syncopes,
isn't it?

421
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,691
Very funny.

422
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:32,226
If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.

423
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,499
Shut up! Shut up!

424
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,275
This may be too blunt,

425
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:49,114
but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.

426
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,654
Forgive us, if you can.

427
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,758
<i>It was with mixed feelings</i>
<i>I saw this region again. </i>

428
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,097
<i>I had my first practice here, </i>

429
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,834
<i>and my old mother lives nearby. </i>

430
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,278
Hello there, Doctor.

431
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,020
So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?

432
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,218
Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.

433
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,521
Eva! Come here a moment!

434
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,059
It's Dr. Borg in person.

435
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:19,035
Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.

436
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,373
The world's best doctor.

437
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,644
Let's call the baby after him.

438
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,083
Isak Akerman... not a bad name
for a prime minister.

439
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,155
Suppose it's a girl.

440
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:35,248
We only have boys.

441
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,624
And how's your father these days?

442
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:48,694
Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.

443
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,570
But Mom's as lively as a cricket.

444
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,109
And you're going to see
<i>your</i> mother, Doctor?

445
00:41:56,247 --> 00:42:00,149
She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.

446
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,742
- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.

447
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,514
What do I owe you?

448
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,787
- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!

449
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:13,762
Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!

450
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:18,426
Why should you pay
for my gasoline?

451
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,302
There are things
that <i>can</i>'<i>t</i> be paid back...

452
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,066
not even with gas.

453
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,642
We haven't forgotten.

454
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,510
Ask anyone around here.

455
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,583
They all remember your kindness.

456
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,884
Maybe I should have stayed here.

457
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,581
What do you mean?

458
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,591
You said you should have stayed.

459
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,892
Did I?

460
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:52,491
Well, thanks anyway.

461
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:58,334
Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.

462
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,342
You know where to find me.

463
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:26,468
<i>During lunch I was in good spirits</i>

464
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:31,030
<i>and told the young people about</i>
<i>my years as district medical officer. </i>

465
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,769
<i>My stories were quite a success, </i>

466
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:37,142
<i>and I don</i>'<i>t think they laughed</i>
<i>merely out of courtesy. </i>

467
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:42,175
<i>I had wine with the lunch, </i>
<i>and then port with the coffee. </i>

468
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:51,954
Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,

469
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,129
how radiant must be its source!

470
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,394
He is going to be a minister,
and Viktor a doctor.

471
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,663
Reciting poetry
is against our agreement

472
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:05,140
not to discuss God
or science on this trip.

473
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,470
It was beautiful!

474
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:10,980
How can anyone today
study to become a minister!

475
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:15,484
Your rationalism is as dry as dust.

476
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,315
I say that modern man...

477
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,184
I say that...

478
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:24,454
believes only in himself

479
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,188
and his biological death.

480
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:29,060
Modern man is a figment
of your imagination.

481
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,761
Man regards death with horror.

482
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:37,136
Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.

483
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,799
How sweet they <i>both</i> are!

484
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,934
I always agree with the one
I spoke with last.

485
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,946
Once you believed in Santa Claus...
now in God.

486
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:47,506
You never had any imagination!

487
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,109
What do you say, Professor?

488
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,022
Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,

489
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,650
so I'll say nothing.

490
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,661
I'm sure they'll be disappointed.

491
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:03,460
No, Sara. Very, very happy.

492
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:09,028
´´Where is the friend I seek

493
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:14,839
at break of day?

494
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:18,904
When night falls, when... ''

495
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,315
´´When night falls,
I still have not found Him. ''

496
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:26,185
´´My burning heart
shows me His traces... ''

497
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,224
Are you religious, Professor?

498
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:34,523
´´I see His traces

499
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:39,398
wherever flowers bloom.

500
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:49,808
His love is mingled with every air. ''

501
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,717
´´His voice calls
in the summer wind. ''

502
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:56,911
Not bad for a love poem.

503
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:02,087
I've gone all solemn again
for no reason.

504
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:08,458
Well, I'm going to call on my mother.
I'll be back soon.

505
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,261
- May I come?
- Of course.

506
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,346
Here comes the thunder.

507
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:36,326
I have just sent you a telegram

508
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,486
on your great day.

509
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,287
And now you're here.

510
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:44,890
We all have our bright moments,
dear Mother.

511
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:50,168
Is that your wife over there?

512
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,334
I don't want to talk to her.

513
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,411
She has done us too much harm.

514
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,243
No, Mother dear.

515
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:03,945
This is Evald's wife, Marianne.

516
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,080
Well, let her come
and say hello to me.

517
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,327
Good day, Mrs. Borg.

518
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,961
And why are you
gadding about like this?

519
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,056
I have been in Stockholm for a visit.

520
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:21,297
Why aren't you with Evald
and the child?

521
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:24,306
Evald and I have no children.

522
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:29,505
These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.

523
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:36,949
Will you please hand me
that big box over there.

524
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,890
My mother lived in this house.

525
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,621
Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?

526
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,594
Very well.

527
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,725
Here are some of your toys.

528
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:56,738
I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.

529
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,571
Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.

530
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,804
Twenty grandchildren.

531
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,848
Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.

532
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,679
Don't get me wrong...
I'm not complaining.

533
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,784
Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.

534
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:18,624
I send presents
for all their birthdays.

535
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:24,565
I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me

536
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:28,195
unless they want to borrow money.

537
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,468
Oh, I know I'm tiresome.

538
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,100
Don't think that, Mother.

539
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,338
And I've one more fault.

540
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,848
I don't die.

541
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,578
The inheritance
isn't being divided up

542
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,712
the way these crafty young people
had planned.

543
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,291
This was Sigbritt's doll.

544
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,620
She got it when she turned eight.

545
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:56,459
I made the dress myself.

546
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,932
But she never cared for it

547
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,970
so it went to Charlotta.

548
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:04,632
She took care of it...
I remember it clearly.

549
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,173
Do you see who that is?

550
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,577
Sigfrid was three
and you were five.

551
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,718
And myself.

552
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:18,253
What a fright
one looked in those days.

553
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,756
May I have it?

554
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:23,382
By all means.
It's only rubbish.

555
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,225
And here's a coloring book.

556
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:31,962
I don't know whose it was.

557
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,629
They've all put their names in it.

558
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,674
Kristina has scrawled:

559
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:42,734
´´I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world. ''

560
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:49,009
And Birgitta has put:
´´I'm going to marry Papa. ''

561
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,423
Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.

562
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:59,589
Don't you think it's cold in here?

563
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,324
No, not particularly.

564
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:06,095
I have felt cold all my life.

565
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,661
Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.

566
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,606
You have low blood pressure.

567
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:17,578
Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.

568
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,844
No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.

569
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:28,024
Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.

570
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,219
I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.

571
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:35,230
It has no hands.
Does that matter?

572
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:49,475
I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.

573
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:54,983
He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.

574
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,145
Now he's turning 50.

575
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:04,751
And little cousin Sara used to
carry him around and sing to him.

576
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:07,625
She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.

577
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:14,059
Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.

578
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:19,234
I am very glad you came,
and I hope to see you again.

579
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,834
Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.

580
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,939
Where are Anders and Viktor?

581
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:57,674
They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.

582
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,243
And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,

583
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:05,287
and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.

584
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:09,017
I said they could talk
about me instead.

585
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:13,825
Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,

586
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,397
so I left.

587
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:19,629
They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...

588
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,671
the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.

589
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:25,002
- Where are they now?
- Up there.

590
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,739
I'll see to them.

591
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,281
Which one do <i>you</i> like best?

592
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,880
Which one do you like best?

593
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,353
I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister...

594
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:41,481
He's a darling.

595
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,450
But a minister's wife...

596
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,530
Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.

597
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:51,067
- Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?

598
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:56,401
A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.

599
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:00,203
Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.

600
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,378
But how <i>can</i> anyone believe in God?

601
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,621
Well? Does God exist?

602
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,758
<i>I dozed off, </i>
<i>but was haunted by vivid</i>

603
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:54,455
<i>and humiliating dreams. </i>

604
00:53:55,398 --> 00:54:01,735
<i>There was something overpowering</i>
<i>in these dream images</i>

605
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:07,777
<i>that bored relentlessly into my mind. </i>

606
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,479
Have you looked in the mirror, Isak?

607
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,618
Then I'll show you
what you look like.

608
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,930
You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,

609
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,730
but I have all my life before me.

610
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,739
That hurt your feelings, after all.

611
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:41,940
No, it didn't hurt.

612
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:47,142
Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.

613
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:51,711
The truth is that
I've been too considerate.

614
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,483
And so became unintentionally cruel.

615
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,719
I understand.

616
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:03,765
No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.

617
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,730
Look in the mirror again.

618
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,861
No, don't turn away.

619
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,030
I see.

620
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,302
Listen to me.

621
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,742
I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.

622
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:22,711
Love is almost a game for us.

623
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:28,858
Look at your face now.
Try to smile!

624
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,121
There! Now you're smiling.

625
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,256
But it hurts so.

626
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:42,704
As professor emeritus,
you ought to know why it hurts.

627
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,364
But you don't know.

628
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:49,444
You know so much,
and you don't know anything.

629
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,041
I must go.

630
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:56,676
I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.

631
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,645
Poor little thing.

632
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:31,115
Hush, baby. Sleep.

633
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,186
Don't be afraid of the wind

634
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:40,093
or the birds

635
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,899
or the waves of the sea.

636
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,934
I'm here with you,
holding you tight.

637
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:50,562
Don't be afraid, little one.

638
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:54,102
It will soon be day again.

639
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,113
No one will hurt you.

640
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:00,376
I am with you.
I am holding you.

641
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,531
Please come in, Professor Borg.

642
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,876
Have you brought
your examination book?

643
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:42,023
Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.

644
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,535
There must be something wrong.

645
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,272
Not with the microscope.

646
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,683
I can't see a thing.

647
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,452
Please read this text.

648
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,805
What does it mean?

649
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,305
I don't know.

650
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,038
Really?

651
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:34,947
I'm a doctor, not a linguist.

652
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:41,752
What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.

653
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,793
Don't you know what that is?

654
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,395
Let me think.

655
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,127
Take your time.

656
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:58,267
A doctor's first duty...

657
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,470
A doctor's...

658
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:03,578
I've forgotten.

659
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,911
A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.

660
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:13,021
Of course! Now I remember!

661
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,396
You have been accused of guilt.

662
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:33,838
I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.

663
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,981
Is it serious?

664
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,376
Unfortunately, Professor.

665
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,057
I have a weak heart.

666
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,428
I'm an old man.

667
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,366
You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.

668
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:03,533
There's nothing about your heart
in my papers.

669
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,539
Do you want to stop the examination?

670
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,666
No, for God's sake, no!

671
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:18,415
Please diagnose the patient.

672
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,896
The patient is dead.

673
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:59,354
What are you writing in my book?

674
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:02,522
- My verdict.
- And that is?

675
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,899
That you are incompetent.

676
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:13,640
You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.

677
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:18,714
Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.

678
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:22,517
Your wife has made the charge.

679
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:24,950
You'll be confronted with her.

680
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,545
But my wife has been dead for years!

681
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,522
Do you think I'm joking?

682
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,255
Please come with me.

683
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,857
You have no choice.

684
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:00,465
Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.

685
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:04,237
Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,

686
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:10,346
but you can recall this scene
at any time.

687
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:13,883
Tuesday, May 1 st, 1917.

688
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,818
You stood on this very spot.

689
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:21,363
and heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.

690
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:40,815
Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.

691
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:44,249
´´My poor girl, I'm sorry for you. ''

692
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,488
Just as if he were God.

693
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:55,359
Then I'll weep and say,
´´Do you really feel sorry for me? ''

694
01:08:56,599 --> 01:09:01,036
He'll say, ´´Yes, very sorry. ''

695
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:05,664
Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.

696
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:06,968
He'll say,

697
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:12,378
´´You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive. ''

698
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,881
But he doesn't mean
a word he says

699
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,119
because he's cold as ice.

700
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,722
And suddenly he gets very tender,

701
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,755
and I scream at him that he's mad

702
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:35,800
and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.

703
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,865
Then he says
he'll get me a sedative

704
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:43,172
and that he understands
everything quite well.

705
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,541
And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.

706
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:53,114
And he looks sad
and says it <i>is</i> his fault.

707
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,322
But he doesn't really care
about anything

708
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,961
because he's so cold.

709
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,420
Where is she?

710
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:29,981
Gone. All are gone.

711
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:34,028
Removed by an operation,
Professor.

712
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:38,292
A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.

713
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,334
Nothing that bleeds or trembles.

714
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,398
How silent it is.

715
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,897
A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.

716
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:49,740
And the punishment?

717
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:53,508
I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.

718
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,174
The usual?

719
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,184
Loneliness.

720
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,584
Loneliness?

721
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,521
Precisely.

722
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,352
Is there no mercy?

723
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,828
Don't ask me. I don't know.

724
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,780
What's this?

725
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,487
The children wanted
to stretch their legs.

726
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,286
But it's still raining.

727
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:42,057
I told them about today
and they want to honor you.

728
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:44,556
Slept well?

729
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:50,435
Yes, but recently I've had
the weirdest dreams,

730
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:59,611
as if I must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.

731
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,046
What's that?

732
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,546
That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.

733
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,913
You and Evald are very alike.

734
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,453
So you've said.

735
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,790
He said the same thing.

736
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,254
About me?

737
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,094
No. About himself.

738
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,667
But he's only 38.

739
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,762
May I tell you about it?

740
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:28,809
Yes, I'd be grateful.

741
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:34,748
A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,

742
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,943
so he drove me down to the sea.

743
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:41,113
It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.

744
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:47,761
Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?

745
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,093
Something unpleasant, of course.

746
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,526
I wish I didn't have to.

747
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,694
You have found someone else.

748
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,436
Don't be childish.

749
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:03,136
You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,

750
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:06,976
and then you find it
hard to begin.

751
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:13,021
Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!

752
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,953
I almost want to laugh now.

753
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,957
Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?

754
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:21,257
That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?

755
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,990
I'm going to have a baby.

756
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,392
Are you sure?

757
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,903
The doctor told me yesterday.

758
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:34,374
So that was the secret.

759
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:39,677
I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.

760
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:43,511
- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.

761
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:02,061
You know I don't want a child.

762
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,605
You'll have to choose
between me and the child.

763
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:07,766
- Poor Evald.
- Don't ´´poor Evald'' me!

764
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:12,069
It's absurd to bring children
into this world

765
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:15,048
and think they'll be better off
than we are.

766
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:19,018
- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.

767
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:23,421
I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.

768
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:26,392
Is he even sure I'm his son?

769
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:30,158
That's no excuse
for behaving like this.

770
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:31,789
I must be at the hospital at 3:00.

771
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,869
I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.

772
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,839
You're a coward.

773
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:40,875
Yes.

774
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:43,370
This life sickens me.

775
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,140
I will not be forced to take on

776
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,080
a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.

777
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:53,052
And you know
that I mean what I say.

778
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:07,298
I know that this is wrong.

779
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,734
There's neither right nor wrong.

780
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,968
We act according to our needs.

781
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,338
And what are they?

782
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:20,572
Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.

783
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:21,808
And yours?

784
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:26,944
Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.

785
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,601
If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.

786
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:50,741
Why have you told me all this?

787
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:59,154
I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.

788
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,317
I don't understand.

789
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:09,194
I thought: That's his mother.

790
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:15,061
An old woman, cold as ice,

791
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:18,196
more forbidding than death.

792
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,704
And this is her son,

793
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,441
and there are light-years
between them.

794
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:29,110
He himself says
he's a living corpse.

795
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:36,623
And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.

796
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:41,296
And I thought of the baby inside me.

797
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:46,563
All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death

798
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:49,637
and loneliness.

799
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,871
It must end somewhere.

800
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,567
But you're going back to Evald!

801
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:01,407
To say I can't agree
to his conditions.

802
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:05,509
I want this child.
No one can take it from me.

803
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:08,055
Not even the man
I love most of all.

804
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,551
Can I help you?

805
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:15,129
No one can help me.

806
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:19,792
We are too old.
Things have gone too far.

807
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,569
What happened after your talk?

808
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:26,140
Nothing.
I left him the next day.

809
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,768
Hasn't he gotten in touch with you?

810
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:35,445
- I don't want us to get...
- To get what?

811
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:39,813
Like those two in the car today.

812
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,218
I was just thinking of them.

813
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:48,252
It reminded me of my own marriage.

814
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,828
But we love each other.

815
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,400
<i>Long may he live</i>
<i>Long may he live</i>

816
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,335
<i>May he live to be</i>
<i>a hundred years old</i>

817
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,541
We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.

818
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:05,841
With these simple flowers
we want to say

819
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:10,509
that we are <i>very</i> impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.

820
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:14,419
We know you must be
a very wise old man

821
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,919
who knows <i>everything</i> about life

822
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:22,463
and has learned
all the instructions by heart.

823
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:27,200
Thank you.

824
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:31,633
Now we must go on.
It's getting late.

825
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:05,196
So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.

826
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:08,238
A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?

827
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:12,046
You'll have to get
into your tails at once.

828
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:16,710
Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.

829
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:19,286
Thank you.
That was most kind.

830
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,187
So you came after all, Miss Agda.

831
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:27,387
I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.

832
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,255
Welcome, Father.

833
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:33,558
As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.

834
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:36,398
- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?

835
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:39,497
The guest room as usual, Father?

836
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,974
Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.

837
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:48,748
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.

838
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,078
Who are those young people?

839
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,380
I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.

840
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:55,456
- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.

841
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:58,253
It's a quarter past 4:00.

842
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,356
I've bought you new shoelaces.

843
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,675
I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.

844
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:19,178
- Are you going to a hotel?
- No, why?

845
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:23,012
Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.

846
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:26,087
- Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.

847
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:28,154
And unexpected.

848
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:29,951
Same here.

849
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,891
Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?

850
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:37,522
Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.

851
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:47,300
Hurry up, Professor!

852
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:27,174
<i>During the ceremony, </i>

853
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:31,211
<i>my thoughts strayed</i>
<i>to the day</i>'<i>s events, </i>

854
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:36,211
<i>and it was then I decided</i>

855
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:39,116
<i>to write down what had happened. </i>

856
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:45,492
<i>In this jumble of events, </i>

857
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:49,791
<i>I seemed to discern</i>
<i>an extraordinary logic. </i>

858
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:18,426
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

859
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,255
Yes, thank you.

860
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:23,654
Are you tired, Miss Agda?

861
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,357
I won't deny it.

862
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,492
Take one of my sleeping pills.

863
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:35,241
Miss Agda, I am sorry
about this morning.

864
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:37,711
Are you ill, Professor?

865
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:39,746
No. Why?

866
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:43,284
I don't like the sound of it.

867
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:46,250
Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?

868
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:51,289
Do you want the carafe
on the table?

869
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:19,352
Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.

870
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:21,683
Miss Agda,

871
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:27,991
as we have known each other

872
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,223
for so many years,

873
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:33,823
don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?

874
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:36,597
No, I don't.

875
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:38,001
Why not?

876
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:40,604
Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?

877
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:46,573
No intimacies for me, thank you.

878
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,842
It's all right between us as it is.

879
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:51,885
But we are old now.

880
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:56,753
Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.

881
01:24:57,459 --> 01:25:01,691
What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?

882
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,730
They would make fun of us.

883
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:07,233
Are you always right?

884
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,394
Almost always.

885
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:14,498
At our age,
we should know how to behave.

886
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:25,983
Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.

887
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:30,114
You know where I am
if you want anything.

888
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:19,433
Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.

889
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,509
We were terribly proud
to know you.

890
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:25,568
An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.

891
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,581
- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.

892
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,480
We just wanted to say good-bye.

893
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,019
Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.

894
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:37,654
It's you I really love, you know.

895
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:41,786
Today, tomorrow, always.

896
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:44,162
I'll remember.

897
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:47,295
Come on.

898
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:56,506
We have to go now.

899
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:02,241
Let me hear from you.

900
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:16,853
- I think Uncle is asleep.
- Evald!

901
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,962
Yes, Father?

902
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:21,695
Are you back already?

903
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:25,505
Marianne lost the heel on a shoe.

904
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:29,603
So you're going to the dance?

905
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:32,712
I suppose so.

906
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:36,908
- How are you, Father?
- Excellent.

907
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:39,748
- Heart all right?
- Excellent.

908
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:43,581
Sleep well.

909
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:48,785
Sit down a moment.

910
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,398
Anything special?

911
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:59,037
How is it to be
between you and Marianne?

912
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:02,135
Forgive my asking.

913
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:03,733
I don't know.

914
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:07,343
It's not my business, but...

915
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,875
But wouldn't it...

916
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:14,011
I have asked her to stay with me.

917
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,317
Shouldn't you... I mean...

918
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:20,690
- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?

919
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:23,855
I can't live without <i>her. </i>
That's what I mean.

920
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,933
Oh, I see.

921
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,763
It will be as she wants.

922
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,864
And she...

923
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:34,669
She says she'll think about it.

924
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:37,510
About that debt of yours...

925
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:39,842
Don't worry,
you'll get your money.

926
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:42,541
That's not what I meant.

927
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:46,384
How are you, Uncle Isak?

928
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,421
Fine. Just fine.

929
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:51,515
I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?

930
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:54,094
They're very nice.

931
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:59,124
Thanks for coming with me.

932
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:05,371
I like you, Marianne.

933
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:08,305
I like you too, Uncle Isak.

934
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:20,948
<i>If I have been worried</i>
<i>or sad during the day, </i>

935
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:27,019
<i>it often calms me</i>
<i>to recall childhood memories. </i>

936
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,395
<i>I did so on this evening too. </i>

937
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:45,643
Isak, there are no
wild strawberries left.

938
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,611
Auntie wants you
to look for your papa.

939
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:51,412
We'll sail around and meet you
at the other side of the island.

940
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:56,222
I can't find either Papa or Mama.

941
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,418
Come, I'll help you.
