BILLY: Mr Rogers beat you

- Take it like a man, Henry.

Can I help it if I'm your superior?

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,611
Heh. Do you want a drink?

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,171
Why not?

00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,890
See you there. Thanks, Billy.

00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,562
- Well, this is very nice.
- What is?

00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,247
Mary's beau, Henry Talbot,
has invited us all to watch him drive

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,324
- at Brooklands next week.
- He’s just sucking up.

- You're convalescing.

not drive in it.

more than 10 minutes.

He told me he's inviting Bertie Pelham.

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,284
- Oh.
- What about you, Mary?

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,922

- You are the owner of a hotel.
- What were you having done'?

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,326
I turned a bedroom into a bathroom
and I've installed an inside privy.

21

and one for my niece to run it.

- Hmm, when the time comes.

And that'll happen soon enough.

- Fine,

at the cottage again.

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,731
No need to sound gloomy.
I can rustle up something.

27

Whatever you do rustle up,
I won't cook it right

VIOLET: Do you enjoy weddings?
- Yes, but I'm not going to that one.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,049
I'd feel like the wicked fairy
at the christening of Sleeping Beauty.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,567
Why would Larry Grey
want you to be there?

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,961
- You of all people.
- I'm sure he doesn't.

39
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,090
- Dickie must have persuaded them.
- I doubt that.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,084
He wouldn't want to subject you
to more insults.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,765
Well, who then?

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,844
I'd say this is the work
of Miss Cruikshank.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,801
She's the one always making
a show of friendship.

44

Why don't I pay a call on her
and see if I can winkle out the truth?

- I'm sorry I showed it to you now.
- Oh, don't be. Don't be.

Are things going well
in my former kingdom?

00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,687
Cora is settling in.
I know it must feel awkward.

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,322
Oh, no. I am yesterday,
she is tomorrow. That's the way it is.

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,084
You must be feeling very hurt.

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,561
Well, yes, the fact is,
I must be very honest,

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,008
- I am angry at the way I've been treated.
- I don't blame you.

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,245
While angry I say things some people
find hard to forgive.

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,926
So I have decided to go away.

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,290
I'd rather vent my rage
on the desert air

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,810
and return when I've regained control
of my tongue.

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,281
Your self-knowledge
is an example to us all.

- The last thing you need,

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,446
at this stage in your life,
is to quarrel with your son

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,329
- and daughter-in-law.
- Precisely.

60
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,451
But don't fear, I'll call on
Miss Cruikshank before I leave.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,807
I suspect she's quite a tough nut.

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,440
And I’m quite a tough nutcracker.

I’m ready if he needs any help.

I’ll tell him you said so.

I don't say you're not,

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,327
but it doesn't seem quite fair
on his lordship, to string it out.

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,970
Does that mean I'm sacked?

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,010
It means I shall be pleased
when we learn the identity

have not seen eye to eye in the past.

in a manner,

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,450
that in any other century,

You are misinformed.

But I want to know this:
Why encourage Mrs Crawley

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,124
when your fiancé detests
the mere idea of her?

I still dispute that,

but I would say

116
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,167
that Larry had perhaps not quite
thought matters through.

117
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,210
- Meaning?
- Only that his father is old

118
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,601
and alone

119
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,445
- and in need of...
- In need of care?

Which you are not prepared to give.

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,048
I would have said a companion.

122
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,043
Which you are not prepared to be.

123
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,447
And what of this house?

Love isn't finite.

If Mr Mason makes new friends,

it doesn't mean he has
any less love for you.

Cover the pots with water.
