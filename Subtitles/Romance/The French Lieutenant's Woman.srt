Sam?

10
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,639
Sam! Get the carriage ready.

11
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
- We're going to Miss Ernestina's.
- At the double, sir.

12
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,879
<i>(maid) Madam'.!</i>

13
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,039
Madam, come quick!
Madam, it's Mr Charles.

14
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,679
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

15
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,679
Will you please tell your mistress
I'm here to see her?

16
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,199
- Charles! Goodness, you are up early.
- Good morning, Mrs Tranter.

17
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,439
- A beautiful morning.
- It is indeed. Come in, do, please.

18
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,919
Is, er, Ernestina awake?

19
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,999
- Er, Mary, is my niece awake?
- She is, ma'am.

20
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,279
- Well, tell her Mr Charles is here.
- Yes, ma'am.

21
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,279
Might it be possible
for me to see Ernestina?

22
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,919
- Alone?
- But of course, of course.

23
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,599
- Thank you.
- Miss!

24
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,039
Miss! Mr Charles
is here, Miss, to see you.

25
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,919
- Mr Charles?
- He's down below, Miss, waitin' for you.

26
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,439
He wants to speak to you.

27
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,239
- What shall I... What dress shall I wear?
- Oh, your pink. It's so lovely, Miss.

28
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,240
- You look pretty as a picture in your pink.
-Yes... Yes, my pink. I'll wear that.

29
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,879
The conservatory is a private place.
Will that suit?

30
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,839
It will suit. Thank you.

31
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I shall wait for her... in the conservatory.

32
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,399
I always thought you from London
spent half the day in bed.

33
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,519
No, ma'am. Up and about.
We're always up and about.

34
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Early birds ready to catch
your early worm, ma'am, us Londoners.

35
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,080
She's comin'!

36
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,999
Charles?

37
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,479
Ernestina.

38
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,959
- She's gone into him.
- Doesn't she look a princess?

39
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,359
Ernestina, it cannot have escaped
your notice that it is fully six weeks...

40
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,519
...since I came down here
to Lyme from London.

41
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,719
No, it has not escaped my notice.

42
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,720
I came to Lyme to explore the flint beds
of the Undercliff to look for fossils...

43
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,959
...but I have stayed for you.

44
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,319
- Ah.
- For your sweet company.

45
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,439
Thank you.

46
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,239
- She's not going to turn him down?
- Never. She'd give her left arm.

47
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,359
I came to inquire whether you would
allow me to ask your father for your hand.

48
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,839
Yes, I would allow it.

49
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,559
Mind you, I don't know
that he approves of me.

50
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,799
I don't do what he considers to be work.

51
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,639
Are you suggesting that it is
entirely Papa's decision?

52
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,959
- No. It is yours.
- Yes, it is.

53
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,799
Papa will do what I want.
And I will do what I want.

54
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,119
Well, in that case, might you take pity...

55
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,120
...on a crusty old scientist,
who holds you very dear...

56
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,959
...and marry me?

57
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,319
Oh, Charles!

58
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,719
I've waited so long for this moment!

59
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,999
He's home and dry.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,359
This isn't mistletoe,
but it will do, will it not?

61
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Oh, Charles.

62

63
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,039

Who is it?

65
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,839
Yes, it is.

66
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I'll tell her.

67
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,719
Anna?

68
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,959
You're late.

69
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Make-up's waiting for you.

70
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,439
Oh, God!

71
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,399
- What happened to the wake-up call?
- I don't know.

72
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,279
- Who called?
- Jack.

73
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,639
- Did you answer the phone?
- Mm-hm.

74
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,039
Well, then... they know.

75
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,279
- They know that you're in my room.
- Mm.

76
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,280
In your bed. I want them to know.

77
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,719
Christ, look at the time.

78
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,999
They'll fire me for immorality.

79
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,799
They'll think I'm a whore.

80
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,239
You are.

81
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,359
Morning.

82
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Chilly morning.

83

<i>(hammering)</i>

Miss Woodruff! You know
you cannot stay here any longer.

85

Miss Duff has made
no provision for you in her will.

86
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,159
The cottage is to be sold.

87
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,160
How much money do you possess?

88
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,719
Miss Woodruff, I think I know
someone who might take you in.

89
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,359
Mrs Poulteney from the Grange.

90
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,839
Does her house overlook the sea?

91
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,639
Yes, it does, yes.

92
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Then... I would be grateful
for your help, sir.

93
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,440
- Mr Smithson to see Mr Freeman.
- You are expected, sir.

94
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,959
You may be a gentlemen
of leisure, Smithson...

95
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,559
...but you are certainly punctual.

96
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,039
Good morning, Mr Freeman.

97
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,799
Well...

98
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,159
We could have met
at my office in the City...

99
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,919
...but I thought you'd be
interested to see this place.

100
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,839
- Indeed I am.
- Mind.

101
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,159
Of course, in a few months we shall be
opening depots in Bristol and Liverpool.

102
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,039
<i>L</i> see.

103
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,839
That's the May Queen,
in this morning for a carpenter.

104
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,839
Yes, indeed. I recognise, er, Charles...

105
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,239
...that you bring to Ernestina
not only love and protection...

106
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,359
...but also in time
a considerable inheritance.

107
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,599
That is so.

108
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,039
Yes...

109
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,119
Well, I know my daughter loves you.

110
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,120
You seem to me an upright man.
Let us shake hands.

111
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,840
I started here, Charles,
with my dear wife at my side.

112
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,479
- You know I have no son.
- I do, sir, yes.

113
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Well, if you ever felt disposed
to explore the world of commerce...

114
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,919
...I would be delighted to be your guide.

115
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,919
Thank you.

116
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,719
Oh, yes, he was very respectful
of what he called...

117
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,639
...my position
as a scientist and a gentleman.

118
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,479
In fact, he asked me about my work.

119
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,079
But as I didn't think that
fossils were quite in his line...

120
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,519
...I gave him a brief discourse
on the theory of evolution instead.

121
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,759
- How wicked of you!
-Yes, he didn't think very much of it.

122
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,439
In fact... he ventured the opinion...

123
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,399
...that Mr Darwin should be exhibited
in a cage in the zoological gardens.

124
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,639
In the monkey house.

125
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,519
I'll lead the way.

126
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,559
Shall we return?
The wind is getting very strong.

127
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,560
I thought you might welcome a reason
to hold my hand without impropriety.

128
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,039
Very well.

129
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Good Lord! What on earth is she doing?

130
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,759
- Oh. It's poor "Tragedy".
- "Tragedy"?

131
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,079
The fishermen have
a grosser name for her.

132
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,519
What?

133
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,039
They call her
"the French lieutenant's... woman".

134
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,039
Do they?

135
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,079
- Please come.
- I must speak to her.

136
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,759
- She could fall.
- She won't thank you. She's mad.

137
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,679
It's dangerous. Will you stay there?

138
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,439
Charles!

139
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Charles!

140
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Madam!

141
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,279
Madam!

142
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Madam, forgive me. I'm alarmed
for your safety. Come back!

143
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Madam!

144
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Tell me, who is this... French lieutenant?

145
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,199
He is a man she's said to have...

146
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,439
Fallen in love with?

147
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,440
- Worse than that.
- Ah. And he abandoned her.

148
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,799
Is there a child?

149
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,879
I think not.

150
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,439
Oh, it's all gossip.

151
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,239
What's she doing here?

152
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,239
They say she's waiting for him to return.

153
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,240
How banal.

154
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,519
(woman) How has she supported
herself since her dismissal?

155
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,520
(vicar) Most pitifully. I understand...

156
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,519
Miss? Miss?

157
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Miss Woodruff,
would you come in, please?

158
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,439
Mrs Poulteney, this is Miss Woodruff.

159
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,559
<i>L</i> see.

160
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,359
I wish, as the vicar has told you...

161
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,759
...to take a companion.

162
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,760
He has indicated to me that you might be
a suitable person for such a post.

163
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,399
- You are without employment?
- I am, ma'am.

164
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,959
- But you have been a governess?
- I have, ma'am.

165
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,960
The post of companion requires a person
of irreproachable moral character.

166
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,119
- I have my servants to consider.
- (clears throat)

167
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,239
- You speak French, I believe?
- I do, ma'am.

168
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,559
- I do not like the French.
- (clears throat)

169
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,399
Perhaps you might
leave us now, Mr Forsythe.

170
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,439
Yes, of course, Mrs Foulteney.
Good afternoon.

171
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,799
Mr Forsythe informs me that you...

172
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,800
...retain an attachment
to a... foreign person.

173
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,399
I have heard from
the most impeccable witnesses...

174
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,519
...that you're always to be seen
at the same place when you're out.

175
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,079
You stand on the Cobb and look to sea.

176
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,159
I'm led to believe that
you're in a state of repentance...

177
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,160
...but I must emphasise that such
staring out to sea is provocative...

178
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,479
...intolerable... and sinful.

179
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,359
If you consider me unsuitable
for this position...

180
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,479
...do you wish me to leave the house?
- I wish you to show...

181
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,319
...that this person
is expunged from your heart!

182
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,320
- How am I to show it?
- By not exhibiting your shame!

183
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,159
I should like to hear you
read from the Bible.

184
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,959
If your expression is agreeable to me...

185
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,960
...you shall have the position.

186
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,639
- Mike?
- Yeah?

187
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,919
Listen to this.

188
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,920
"In 1857, it is estimated there were 80,000
prostitutes in the county of London."

189
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,639
Yeah?

190
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,559
"Out of every So houses,
one was a brothel."

191
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,879
<i>Hon, hon, hon'.!</i>

192
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,880
"At a time when the male population of
London was one and a quarter million...

193
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
...the prostitutes were receiving clients
at a rate of two million per week."

194
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,119
- Two million?
-Yeah.

195
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,120
You know when I say in the graveyard
scene about going to London?

196
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
(helicopter overhead)

197
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,439
"if I went to London,
I know I should become...

198
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,879
...what some already
call me here in Lyme."

199
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,359
- Go on. Yeah?
- Well, that's what she's really faced with.

200
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,959
This man says that
hundreds of the prostitutes...

201
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,439
...were nice girls, like governesses,
who'd lost their jobs.

202
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,959
You offend your boss, you lose
your job, you're out on the streets.

203
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,239
That's the reality.

204
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,799
The male population was
one and a quarter million?

205
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,599
Yeah.

206
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,039
Well, if we take away a third
for children and old men...

207
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,599
...that means that, outside of marriage...

208
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,600
...your Victorian gentleman could
look forward to 2.4 fucks a week!

209
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,440
<i>(humming)</i>

210
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,480
<i>(whistling)</i>

211
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,440
<i>(twig snaps)</i>

212
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm very sorry to disturb you.

213
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,359
<i>(knocking)</i>

214
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,360
All right. I'm comin'!

215
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,919
For the lovely young lady upstairs.

216
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,920
And... for the even more lovely one down.

217
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,359
How much do I owe you?

218
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,360
- A penny?
- Mm.

219
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,559
Thank you very much.

220
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,879
- Do you know that lady?
- Aye.

221
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,119
- Does she come this way often?
- Often enough.

222
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,279
But she be no lady.

223
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,280
She be the French lieutenant's whore.

224
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,079
From Mr Charles, Miss Tina,
with his compliments.

225
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,959
- Did he bring them himself?
- No, Miss.

226
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,959
- Where <i>is</i> Mr Charles?
- Dunno, Miss. Didn't ask him.

227
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,639
Ask who?

228
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,039
- His servin' man, Miss.
- But I heard you speak with him.

229
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,719
- Yes, Miss.
- What about?

230
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,479
Oh, it was just the time of day, Miss.

231
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,879
You will kindly remember
that he comes from London.

232
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,479
Yes, Miss.

233
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,239
If he makes advances,
I wish to be told at once.

234
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Now bring me some barley water.

235
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Madam?

236
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,319
Madam?

237
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,320
I'm very sorry to have
disturbed you just now.

238
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,280
I gather you've recently become...
secretary to Mrs Poulteney.

239
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,880
May I accompany you? Since
we walk in the same direction.

240
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,519
I prefer to walk alone.

241
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,519
- May I introduce myself?
- I know who you are.

242
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,520
- Ah. Then...
- Kindly allow me to go on my way alone.

243
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And please tell no one that
you have seen me in this place.

244
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,239
"Miss Wood ruff."

245
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,639
Wait a minute. I lost the place.

246
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Page 50. I suddenly see you. You've
got your dress caught in the brambles.

247
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,799
I see you, then you see me. We look at
each other, and I say "Miss Woodruff."

248
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,559
All right.

249
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,839
Right. I see you.

250
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,159
Get your coat caught in the brambles.

251
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,199
Right.

252
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,599
Now I'm looking at you.

253
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,799
You see me.

254
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,519
- "Miss Woodruff."
- I'm looking at you.

255
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,199
But now you come
towards me to pass me.

256
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,559
It's a narrow path, and it's muddy.

257
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,560
- You slip in the mud...
- Ow!

258
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,919
- ...and I help you up.
- Let's just do it again, OK?

259
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,920
- All right.
- Let's just do it again.

260
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,960
All right...

261
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,799
I've got my dress caught in the brambles.

262
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,239
Suddenly you see me.

263
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,799
Then I see you.

264
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,800
"Miss Wood ruff."

265
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,999
I dread to think what would happen...

266
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,999
...if you should one day
tum your ankle in a place like this.

267
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,839
I must go back.

268
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,439
Permit me to say something first.
I know I am a stranger to you, but...

269
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,440
<i>(dog barking)</i>

270
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,199
Down here, here in this hollow.
Come on.

271
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,679
Here. Here.

272
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,159
Heel!

273
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,039
It's really not necessary to hide.

274
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,040
No man who cares for his good name can
be seen with the scarlet woman of Lyme.

275
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,999
Miss Woodruff... I've heard
something of your circumstances.

276
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,359
It cannot be any great pleasure
being in Mrs Poulteney's employ.

277
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,159
Why don't you leave Lyme? I understand
you have excellent qualifications.

278
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,799
- I should be happy to make inquiries...
- I cannot leave this place.

279
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,399
But why?

280
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,719
You have no family ties, I believe,
that confine you to Dorset.

281
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,919
I have ties.

282
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,920
To this French gentleman?

283
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,999
Permit me to insist.
These things are like wounds.

284
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,359
If no one dares speak of them, they fester.

285
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,559
If he doesn't return...

286
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,119
...he was not worthy of you.

287
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,120
- If he returns...
- He will never return.

288
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,039
You fear he will never return?

289
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,040
<i>I know</i> he will never return.

290
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,159
I do not take your meaning.

291
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,160
He is married.

292
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,359
I should have listened to
the dictates of my own common sense!

293
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,360
- You are a cunning, wicked creature!
- May I know of what I am accused?

294
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,559
You have been seen
walking on the Undercliff!

295
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,639
Not twice, but thrice!

296
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,799
But... what, pray, is the sin in that?

297
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,800
The sin? You, a young woman
alone, in such a place?

298
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,439
- It is nothing but a large wood.
- I know very well what it is.

299
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,119
And what goes on,
the sort of person who frequents it.

300
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,279
No one frequents it. I go there to be alone.

301
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,839
Do you contradict me, Miss?

302
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,719
You will confine your walks
to where it is seemly.

303
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Do I make myself clear?!

304
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,679
Good afternoon,
Mrs Poulteney, Miss Woodruff.

305
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,279
Good afternoon.

306
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,799
- It's that Mrs Foulteney.
- Who's that?

307
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,279
The one who kicked me out in the street.

308
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,319
Is it? Poison her tea.

309
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,320
Ah, now, Miss Woodruff.
It <i>is</i> a pleasure to meet you.

310
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,439
- Are you liking Lyme?
- Erm...

311
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,199
Thank you, ma'am. Yes.

312
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,759
- Were you born far from Lyme?
- In Dorchester, ma'am.

313
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,519
- (knocking)
- It is not very far.

314
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,239
Ah, tea. Thank you, Mary.

315
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,159
Good... Just there.

316
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,679
How long will you remain in Lyme,
Miss, er... Freeman?

317
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,919
Oh, for the summer.

318
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,799
I must say, Mrs Poulteney,
you look exceedingly well.

319
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,159
At my age, Miss Freeman,
spiritual health is all that counts.

320
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,479
Then I have no fears for you.

321
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,919
With gross disorders on the streets...

322
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,319
...it becomes ever more necessary to
protect the sacredness of one's beliefs.

323
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,279
- Gross disorders on the streets?
- Certainly, Mr Smithson.

324
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,079
Even a disciple of Darwin,
such as I understand you to be...

325
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,799
...could not fail to notice
the rise of the animal about us.

326
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,839
It no doubt pleases you...

327
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,840
...since it would accord with
your view that we're all monkeys!

328
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,639
I must look more closely into it...

329
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,159
...the next time I find myself on a street.

330
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,639
Please allow me to help you, Mrs Tranter.

331
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,599
Your maid, for example, Mrs Tranter.

332
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,599
I have been informed by my housekeeper
that she saw her, only this morning...

333
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,759
"talking with a person, a young person.

334
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,639
My housekeeper did not know him.

335
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,999
Oh, then it was no doubt
Sam, my servant.

336
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,839
- Very likely.
-Yes, I must say, Charles...

337
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,999
...your servant spends an inordinate
amount of his time talking to Mary.

338
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,079
And what is the harm in that?

339
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,599
There is a world of a difference between
what is accepted in London and here.

340
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,839
But I do not understand what crime Mary
and Sam, by talking, appear to commit.

341
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,559
Your future wife is a better judge than
you are of these things, Mr Smithson.

342
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,359
I know the girl in question.

343
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,399
I had to dismiss her.

344
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,400
If you were older, you would know that
one cannot be too strict in such matters.

345
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,400
I bow to your
far greater experience, madam.

346
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,200
<i>(Miss Woodrufl' whispers) I'm</i> here!

347
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,079
<i>(organ Plays)</i>

348
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,559
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

349
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,560
How did you dare to behave in so
impertinent and presumptuous a manner?

350
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,559
- How dare you, in front of Miss Freeman?
- I had no one else to turn to.

351
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,279
It must be obvious it would be improper
for me to interest myself further in you.

352
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,079
Yes, it is obvious.

353
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,279
Why don't you go to London,
make a new life?

354
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,119
If I went to London,
I know what I should become.

355
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,279
I should become what some
already call me in Lyme.

356
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,959
- My dear Miss Woodruff...
- I am weak. How should I not know it?

357
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,359
I have sinned.

358
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,879
You cannot imagine my suffering.

359
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,359
My only happiness is when I sleep.

360
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,839
When I wake, the nightmare begins.

361
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,840
<i>(door closes)</i>

362
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,559
This is...

363
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,199
Why am I born what I am?

364
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,759
- Why am I not born Miss Freeman?
- That question were better not asked.

365
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,919
- I did not mean...
- Envy is...

366
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,999
Not envy!

367
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,439
Incomprehension.

368
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,239
- You must help me.
- It is not in my power to help you!

369
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,119
I do not... I <i>will</i> not believe that.

370
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,519
What do you want of me?

371
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,359
I must tell you what really
happened to me 18 months ago.

372
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,839
I beg of you. You are my only hope.

373
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,399
I shall be on the Undercliff tomorrow
afternoon, and the next afternoon.

374
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,159
I shall wait for you.

375
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,359
I must go.

376
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,360
I shall wait!

377
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,959
Davide?

378
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,960
No, it's not Davide. It's Mike.

379
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,119
What are you doing?

380
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,039
- Looking at you.
- Come back.

381
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,040
Come back. Come on.

382
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,439
- Do you approve of my telescope?
- It is most elegant.

383
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,239
I use it to keep an eye out for mermaids.

384
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,759
<i>(laughs)</i> Here.

385
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,959
I'm delighted you dropped in.
it was time we met.

386
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,799
The best brandy in Dorset.

387
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,599
I keep it for visitors from London
who share a taste for the good life.

388
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,559
- Your good health, Doctor.
- Yours.

389
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,919
- Care for a cheroot?
- Thank you.

390
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,839
I understand you're, er... a scientist.

391
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,199
A seeker after fossils.

392
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,039
Palaeontology <i>is</i> my interest.

393
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,359
I gather it is not yours.

394
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,959
When we know more of the living,
it will be time to pursue the dead.

395
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,719
Yes, I was introduced the other day
to a specimen of the local flora...

396
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,319
...that rather inclines me
to agree with you.

397
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,399
A very strange case, as I understand it.

398
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,639
- Her name is Woodruff.
- Ah, yes. Poor "Tragedy".

399
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,640
We know more about your fossils on the
beach than we do about that girl's mind.

400
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,600
A German doctor called Hartmann has
divided melancholia into various types.

401
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,999
One he calls "natural", by which
he means that one is born with a...

402
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,079
...a sad temperament.

403
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,399
Another he calls "occasional"...

404
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,359
...by which he means
springing from an occasion.

405
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,439
And the third class he calls
"obscure melancholia"...

406
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,440
...by which he really means, poor man,
he doesn't know what the devil caused it.

407
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,199
- But she had an occasion, did she not?
- Oh, come now.

408
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,479
Is she the first young woman
to be jilted? No, no.

409
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,079
She belongs to the third class:
obscure melancholia.

410
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,999
Listen to me.

411
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,679
I'll tell you, in the strictest confidence.

412
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,359
I was called in to see her,
oh, ten months ago.

413
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,639
She was working as a seamstress,
living by herself...

414
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Well, hardly living. Weeping without
reason, unable to sleep, unable to talk.

415
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,479
Melancholia as plain as the pox.

416
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,719
I could see there was only one cure.

417
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,599
To get her away from this place.
But no, she wouldn't have it.

418
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,679
She goes to a house that
she knows is a living misery...

419
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,199
...to a mistress that sees no difference
between a servant and a slave.

420
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,479
- And she will not be moved.
- But it's... incomprehensible.

421
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,359
Not at all. Hartmann has something
very interesting to say...

422
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,239
...about one of his patients.

423
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,240
"It was as if her torture
had become her delight."

424
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,639
And she has confided the true
state of her mind to no one?

425
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,519
- She has not.
- But if she did?

426
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,279
I mean, if she could
bring herself... to speak?

427
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,919
She would be cured.

428
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,920
But she does not want to be cured.

429
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,040
I was working... as a governess.

430
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,040
At the Talbots'.

431
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
His name was Varguennes.

432
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,840
He was brought to the house
after the wreck of his ship.

433
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,040
He had a dreadful wound. His flesh
was tom from his hip to his knee.

434
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,439
He was in great pain...

435
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,519
...yet he never cried out.

436
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Not the smallest groan.

437
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,079
I admired his courage.

438
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,080
I looked after him.

439
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,360
I did not know then that men can be
both very brave and very false.

440
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,239
He was handsome.

441
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,240
No man had ever paid me the kind
of attentions he did as he was...

442
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,600
"recovering.

443
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,079
He told me I was beautiful...

444
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,080
...and that he could not understand
why I was not married.

445
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Such things.

446
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,959
He would mock me...

447
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,279
...lightlY-

448
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,679
I took pleasure in it.

449
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,879
When I would not let him kiss my hand...

450
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,519
...he called me cruel.

451
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,520
A day came when I thought
myself cruel as well.

452
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,920
And you were no longer... cruel?

453
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,879
<i>(sighs)</i>

454
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,239
Varguennes recovered.

455
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,199
He left for Weymouth.

456
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,200
He said that he would wait there
one week and then... sail for France.

457
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,719
I told him that I would never follow him...

458
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,959
...that I could not.

459
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,960
But, after he had gone...

460
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,919
...my loneliness was so deep...

461
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,920
...I felt I would drown in it.

462
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,159
I followed him-.

463
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,479
I went to the inn
where he had taken a room.

464
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,759
It was not a respectable place -
I knew that at once.

465
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,639
They told me to go up to his room.

466
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,039
They looked at me.

467
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,279
They smiled.

468
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,280
I insisted he be sent for.

469
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
He seemed... overjoyed to see me.

470
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,759
He... he was all that a lover should be.

471
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,760
I had not eaten that day. He took me
to a private sitting room, ordered food.

472
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,439
But...

473
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,319
...he had changed.

474
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,959
He was full of smiles and caresses, but...

475
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,759
...I knew at once that he was insincere.

476
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,439
I saw that I had been...

477
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,399
...an amusement for him.

478
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Nothing more.

479
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,120
I saw all this within...

480
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:52,560
...five minutes of our meeting.

481
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,359
Yet I stayed.

482
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,719
I ate the supper that was served.

483
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I drank the wine. It did not intoxicate me.
I think it made me see more clearly.

484
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,079
Is... is that possible?

485
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,559
No doubt.

486
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,199
Soon he no longer bothered to hide the
real nature of his intentions towards me...

487
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,319
...nor could I pretend surprise.

488
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,320
My innocence was false
from the moment I chose to stay.

489
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,800
I could tell you that he overpowered me...

490
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,279
...or that he drugged me, but...

491
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,280
...it is not so.

492
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,679
I gave myself to him.

493
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,239
I did it so that I should
never be the same again...

494
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,240
...so that I should be seen
for the outcast I am!

495
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,159
I knew it was ordained that
I should never marry an equal, so...

496
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,479
...I married shame.

497
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,799
It is my shame that has kept me alive...

498
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,839
...my knowing that I am
truly not like other women.

499
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,199
I... I shall never, like them,
have children and a husband...

500
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,879
...and the pleasures of a home.

501
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,880
Sometimes I pity them. I have
a freedom they cannot understand.

502
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,919
No insult, no blame, can touch me.

503
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,920
I have set myself beyond the pale.

504
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,719
I am nothing.

505
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,199
I am... hardly human any more.

506
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,839
I am the French lieutenant's...

507
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,840
...whore!

508
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,440
You must leave Lyme.

509
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:34,240
<i>(laughter)</i>

510
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,359
We must never meet alone again. Go.

511
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,360
I will wait.

512
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,480
What's the matter?

513
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,320
- What's the matter? You look sad.
- No.

514
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,399
No.

515
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,519
Why are you sad?

516
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,520
I'm not.

517
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,079
- Out of my way, little girl.
- Good morning, Mrs Fairley.

518
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,359
My usual.

519
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,360
- Gonna be a nice day, then?
- Yes.

520
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,440
<i>(woman knocking) Miss Wood ruff?</i>

521
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,119
Miss Wood ruff!

522
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,959
Miss Wood ruff,
Mrs Poulteney wants to see you!

523
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,359
<i>(knocking)</i>

524
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:59,360
Mrs Poulteney wants to see you at once!

525
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,920
<i>(clock strikes six)</i>

526
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,880
<i>(thunder)</i>

527
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,319
- Yes?
- Forgive me. I must speak to Dr Grogan.

528
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,079
- Dr Grogan is not here.
- Not here?

529
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:06,080
He has been called to the asylum.
He's at the asylum.

530
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,559
Thank you.

531
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,519
<i>(knocking)</i>

532
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:19,159
Charles Smithson. I must see Dr Grogan
on a matter of the utmost importance.

533
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,399
Follow me, please, sir.

534
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,479
<i>(woman groaning)</i>

535
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,399
Ah, Smithson. I can guess
what you've come about.

536
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,639
I'm sorry I wasn't at home.

537
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,999
I'm attending a breech birth.

538
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Well, the fact is,
we don't know where she is.

539
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,079
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- You don't know what's happened?

540
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,559
- No.
- Then why are you here?

541
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,879
- I need your advice.
- I'm not sure I have any left to give.

542
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,559
Miss Woodruff has disappeared.
Mrs Poulteney dismissed her.

543
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,319
There's a search party out. I've offered
£5 to the man who can bring her back.

544
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,119
- Or find her body.
- Well, she <i>is</i> alive.

545
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,759
- (woman <i>in</i> labour)
- I've just received a note from her.

546
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,760
I must go back.
Go to my house. Wait for me.

547
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,279
Nothing that has been said in this room
tonight, or that remains to be said...

548
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,359
...will go beyond these walls.

549
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,399
Now, you ask for my advice.

550
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,879
I am a young woman of superior
intelligence and some education.

551
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,599
I am not in full command of my emotions.

552
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:01,600
What is worse, I have fallen in love
with being a victim of fate.

553
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,679
Enter a young god.

554
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,439
Intelligent, good-looking.

555
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,799
Kind.

556
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,039
My one weapon is the pity
I inspire in him.

557
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,919
So what do I do? I seize my chance.

558
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,719
One day, when I am walking where
I have been forbidden to walk...

559
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,839
...I show myself to someone
I know will report my crime...

560
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,159
...to the one person who will
not condone it, my employer.

561
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,679
I then disappear...

562
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,680
...under the presumption that it is in order
to throw myself from the nearest cliff top.

563
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,679
And then, <i>in</i> extremis...

564
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,839
...I cry to my saviour for help.

565
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,159
What in heaven's name
are you talking about?!

566
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,039
I spoke to Mrs Poulteney's housekeeper.
She was at the dairy on the Undercliff.

567
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,999
The girl walked out of the woods
under her nose. She wanted to be seen.

568
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,679
- Presumably to compromise you.
- Why should she want to harm me?

569
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,799
Listen to me. I have
known many prostitutes.

570
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,919
I hasten to add, in pursuance
of my own profession, not theirs.

571
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,839
And I wish I had a guinea for every one
of them I have heard gloat over the fact...

572
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,279
...that their victims
were husbands and fathers.

573
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,599
But she is not a prostitute!

574
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,999
Neither is she a... fiend.

575
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
My dear man, you are
half in love with her.

576
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,879
On my most sacred honour, nothing
improper has passed between us.

577
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,839
I believe you. But let me ask you this.

578
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,119
Do you wish to hear her?
Do you wish to see her?

579
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:43,120
Do you wish to touch her?

580
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,559
You are not the first man
to doubt his choice of bride.

581
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,560
I will go to see the lady.
I will tell her you've been called away.

582
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,519
And you must go away, Smithson.

583
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,639
Yes.

584
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,479
I shall honour my vows to Miss Freeman.

585
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,679
I know of a private asylum in Salisbury.

586
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,119
Miss Woodruff would be kindly treated
and helped, I assure you.

587
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,319
- Would you bear the expense?
- Yes.

588
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:25,320
I would bear the expense.

589
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,400
Miss Wood ruff.

590
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Have you passed the night here?

591
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,480
- Are you cold?
- No. No.

592
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:11,199
Do not fear.

593
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,200
I have come to help you.

594
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,240
- Pray control yourself.
- I cannot! I cannot!

595
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,799
<i>(giri giggling)</i>

596
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,319
' <i>Wary)</i> I'm not!
' (Sam) Why not?

597
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:52,320
(Sam) What is it?

598
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,999
What the devil are you doing here?!

599
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,599
- Walking, Mr Charles.
- Kindly leave us.

600
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,159
Yes, sir.

601
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,719
I have come here to help that lady...

602
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,919
...at the request of
the physician who is treating her.

603
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,639
- He is aware of the circumstances.
- Yes, sir.

604
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,079
Which must on no account...
be disclosed.

605
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,359
- I understand, sir.
- Does she?

606
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,799
Oh, she won't say nothin', sir. On my life.

607
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,800
On my solemn oath, Mr Charles.

608
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,560
I have taken unpardonable advantage
of your situation. Forgive me.

609
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,559
I am wholly to blame.

610
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,999
You must go to Exeter.

611
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,959
There is talk of
committing you to an institution.

612
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,960
You will save yourself embarrassment
if you do not... return to Lyme.

613
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,159
- Where are your belongings?
- At the coach depot.

614
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,999
I will have them sent
to the depot at Exeter.

615
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,799
Walk to Axmouth Cross,
wait for the coach there.

616
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,800
Take the money in this purse.

617
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,519
Thank you.

618
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,119
Here is my lawyer's address.

619
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,359
Let him know where you are.

620
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,679
I will instruct him
to send you more money.

621
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,680
Thank you.

622
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:04,640
I shall never see you again.

623
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,680
No.

624
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,359
You are a remarkable person,
Miss Woodruff.

625
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:20,360
Yes, I am a remarkable person.

626
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,319
I'm going - to London.

627
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:57,119
Yup.

628
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:02,120
Well, I don't have any more
scenes to shoot here, so...

629
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,759
ls, er... David here?

630
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,760
- No, he's flying in tonight.
- Oh. That'll be nice for you.

631
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:19,319
No... it <i>will</i> be nice for you.

632
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,519
Nice for him, too.

633
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,599
I'll miss you.

634
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,199
I'll drive you up to the Cups
if you've finished.

635
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,279
- See you in Exeter, Anna.
- Mm-hm.

636
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,280
- Think of us, slogging away.
- Oh, I will.

637
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,399
Am [going to see you in London?

638
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:44,400
That would be very, very difficult.

639
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,399
We are there for a fortnight.

640
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,400
I must see you.

641
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,919
OK.

642
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,999
<i>(PA) OK, we're moving up to the Cups.</i>

643
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,959
- Mike, we need you <i>in</i> Make-up.
- Yes!

644
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,239
Yes.

645
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,279
- Yes.
- Yes.

646
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,280
Sam?

647
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,119
- Sir.
-Ah, Sam.

648
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,479
I want you to leave for London
today, open up the house.

649
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,559
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

650
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,159
- Change of plan.
- I see, sir.

651
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:28,160
This doesn't have any bearing on
your, er, future plans, I trust, sir?

652
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:33,240
- What are you talking about?
- I've got to think about myfuture, sir.

653
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:38,360
Have you? Well, your immediate future
is to leave for London today.

654
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,200
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Mr Charles.

655
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:05,840
<i>(rings bell)</i>

656
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,519
Ah. Good afternoon.

657
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,679
Good afternoon, sir.
Miss Ernestina's in the garden.

658
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,680
Thank you.

659
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,799
Sam has explained about the, er...
circumstances of this morning?

660
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,719
Yes, sir.

661
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,720
- And you understand?
- Yes, sir.

662
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,400
- Sir, I don't want that.
- No. Here.

663
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,199
Good afternoon.

664
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:16,200
Charles! So you have actually deigned
to desert the world of the fossil for me?

665
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,519
I am honoured.

666
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:24,520
I can assure you, the true charm
of this world resides in this garden.

667
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,439
Honeyed words.

668
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,559
My dearest, I must leave you again
for a few days. I must go to London.

669
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,919
- To London?
- To see Montague, my lawyer.

670
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,039
- Oh, Charles!
- It's unavoidable, I'm afraid.

671
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:43,679
Apparently there are matters outstanding,
to do with the marriage settlement.

672
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,479
- Your father is a most scrupulous person.
- What does he want?

673
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,599
- Who?
- My father.

674
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,719
Er... Justice for you.

675
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,720
Sweet justice...
that takes you away from me.

676
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,199
Ernestina, I know our private affections
are the paramount consideration...

677
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,200
...but there is also a... legal and
contractual side to matrimony which is...

678
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,519
Fiddlesticks!

679
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,199
- My dearest Tina...
- I am weary of Lyme.

680
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:19,200
- I see you so little.
- I shall be back in three days.

681
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:26,720
Kiss me, then... to seal your promise.

682
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:09,200
Flay.

683
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,879
Upon the chase. 40-15.

684
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,880
Chase three.

685
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,840
Game to Mr Smithson,
and the first set: 6-5.

686
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,319
My goodness, Charles, you were
in cracking form. Sharp as a razor.

687
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,519
- What's the answer? Country grub?
- It's good to hit a ball.

688
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,999
You were hitting it as though you hated it.

689
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,079
Harry, a word.

690
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,039
You will be hearing from a person,
a Miss Woodruff from Exeter.

691
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,639
She'll give you her address. I'd like
you to send her some money for me.

692
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,479
Of course. How much?

693
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,279
£50.

694
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,479
Of course.

695
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,399
- Miss Woodruff?
- Yes.

696
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,399
And I want to hear nothing more about it.

697
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:42,400
You shan't.

698
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:53,760
Wait for me.

699
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,799
- Where the devil have you been?
- I'm sorry, sir. I...

700
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,439
Go and lay out my clothes.
I'm dining at my club.

701
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,639
Yes, sir. Can I have a word with you, sir?

702
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,640
No, you can't.

703
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,319
- How goes the huntin' in Dorset, Charles?
- And how go you for hounds?

704
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,959
I could offer you a brace of
the best Northumberland. Real angels.

705
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,079
D'you know who
their grandpapa was? Tornado.

706
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,199
Do you recall Tornado at Cambridge?

707
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,319
Yes. So do my ankles.

708
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:35,239
Aye, he took a fancy to you.
Always... always bit what he loved.

709
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,279
What a profoundly good idea
this was, Charles.

710
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:44,280
- To dear old Tornado, God rest his soul.
- Rest his soul.

711
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,839
Bravo! Port is essential
to wash down the claret.

712
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,439
As claret was essential
to wash down the punch.

713
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,440
As punch was essential
to sluice the champagne.

714
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,519
- What follows?
- What follows?

715
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,159
A little drive round town follows.
That most essentially follows.

716
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,359
Tom, my dear old fellow,
you're a damn good fellow.

717
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:18,159
So are you, Charley boy.
We're all damn good fellas.

718
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,559
- On we go, gentlemen.
- Where are we going?

719
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,599
Where all damn good fellas go
for a jolly night out.

720
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,359
We're goin' to Kate Hamilton's,
bless her heart.

721
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:33,360
The bishop's son has hit it, Charley.
But not a word to his old man!

722
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,439
Steady.

723
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,279
Come along, sir, be upsta...
Oh! He's at the post.

724
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,079
- The white flag is up. They're off!
- Steady, steady.

725
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,879
- That's it. Very good.
- He's on the rails, off the rails!

726
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,880
Oh, my God!

727
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,680
I don't think our dear Charley is going
anywhere tonight, old boy. Do you?

728
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,119
This come to Mr Montague,
for Mr Smithson.

729
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:24,120
Thank you very much.

730
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:57,200
Mr Charles?

731
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,559
Mr Charles?

732
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,199
Sir!

733
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:06,200
A letter for you, sir. Special messenger
just come from Mr Montague.

734
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:26,320
Er, bring me some tea.

735
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,760
<i>(humming)</i>

736
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,559
What is it, Sam?

737
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,399
I'd like your advice, sir.

738
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,679
On what subject?

739
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:49,239
My ambition is to go
into business, sir... in due course.

740
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,159
- Business?
- Yes, sir.

741
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,359
- What kind of business?
- Draper's and haberdasher's.

742
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:59,399
I've set me heart on a little shop.

743
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,519
Would that not be
a somewhat costly undertaking?

744
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,520
£280, sir.

745
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,839
And how much do you have put by?

746
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,359
£.30... But that's three years' savin'.

747
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,159
So I was wonderin'
if you could help me, sir.

748
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:22,639
I can't say it sounds
a very practical idea to me, Sam.

749
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,559
I'm very enthusiastic
about the idea myself, sir.

750
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,079
Very.

751
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,519
Well, I'll think about it.

752
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,399
I'll certainly be happy to think about it.

753
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,359
Now pack, would you?
We're going to Lyme.

754
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:44,360
- To Lyme, sir?
- To Lyme, yes.

755
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,759
(guard) Exete r! Exete r!

756
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:05,760
Change here now
for Exmouth, Weymouth and Lyme.

757
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:12,199
- Carriage to Lyme, sir?
- We'll stay the night. It's going to rain.

758
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,279
We'll put up at the Ship.

759
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,959
- I'm going to stretch my legs.
- Shall I order dinner, sir?

760
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:22,960
I'll decide when I come in.

761
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,159
- A room, sir?
- Er, no, I...

762
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,639
...I should like to speak to one of your...

763
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,719
- A Miss Woodruff.
- Oh, the poor young lady, sir.

764
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,559
She was a-comin' downstairs
and she slipped, sir.

765
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,479
Turned her ankle terrible. I wanted to
ask the doctor, but she won't hear of it.

766
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,679
I have to see her on a... business matter.

767
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:10,519
Ah... A gentleman of the law?

768
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,119
Yes.

769
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,639
- Then you must go up, sir.
- Thank you.

770
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,640
Betty Anne? Take this gentleman
to Miss Woodruff's room.

771
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:29,040
<i>- (knocks)
- Come 'm.</i>

772
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:34,320
A gentleman to see you, Miss.

773
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:48,240
I was passing through Exeter.

774
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:51,599
Had I not better go at once
and fetch a doctor?

775
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,719
He would only advise me
to do what I am already doing.

776
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:59,720
- You're not in pain?
- No.

777
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,999
Be thankful it didn't
happen on the Undercliff.

778
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Yes.

779
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,680
Do sit down.

780
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:43,319
Miss Wood ruff, please...

781
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:48,320
I should not have come.

782
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,560
- I meant not to.
- I thought I should never see you again.

783
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:06,280
Oh!

784
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:20,480
Oh, Sarah.

785
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:27,680
<i>(he gasps)</i>

786
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:36,359
I was... the first?

787
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:41,360
Yes.

788
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:47,760
- Why did you lie about the Frenchman?
- I don't know.

789
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,879
Does he exist?

790
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:02,719
Oh, yes, he exists.

791
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:07,720
I did follow him to Weymouth, to the inn.

792
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,840
As I drew near I saw him
come out with a woman.

793
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:18,360
The kind of woman one... cannot mistake.

794
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,920
When they had gone, I... walked away.

795
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:29,559
But then... why did you tell...

796
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:34,560
I don't know.

797
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:40,959
I cannot explain.

798
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,960
Not now.

799
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,319
I must make myself free.

800
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:55,559
- I am to blame. I knew when I came here.
- I wished it so.

801
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:00,560
<i>I</i> wished it so.

802
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,560
Sarah...

803
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:21,120
it is the sweetest name.

804
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,560
I have long imagined a day such as this.

805
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,159
I have longed for it.

806
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:39,160
I was lost from the moment I saw you.

807
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:47,560
I, too.

808
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,799
I must go to Lyme...

809
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,159
...to see her, to tell her.

810
01:22:55,160 --> 01:23:00,160
You must give me a day's grace.

811
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:05,760
You will wait for me, won't you?

812
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:11,200
I shall come back for you.

813
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:42,720
I shall be back tomorrow.

814
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:49,799
Do what you will... or what you must.

815
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,399
Now that I know there was truly
a day upon which you loved me...

816
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:58,400
...I can bear anything.

817
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:06,640
You have given me the strength to live.

818
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:34,799
- Cheese and onion.
- Perfect.

819
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,799
- I'm losing you. I'm losing you!
- What? I'm just going to London.

820
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,679
- Stay the night.
- I can't.

821
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:44,159
- Why not? You're a free woman.
-Yes, I am.

822
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,399
- I'm going mad!
- No, you're not.

823
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,519
- I want you so much.
- Well, you just had me... in Exeter!

824
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,279
<i>(guard blows whistle)</i>

825
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,559
Excuse me.

826
01:24:55,560 --> 01:25:00,560
Bye-bye.

827
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,199
- (knocking)
- (Charles) Thank you. I'll show myself in.

828
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:27,439
Charles!

829
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,719
- Please sit down.
- What is it?

830
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:32,999
- Charles, what is it?
- Sit down.

831
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,279
Well, what has happened?

832
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,119
Why do you look at me like that?

833
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:45,120
Because I don't know how
to begin to say what I must.

834
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,319
- I've come to tell you the truth.
- The truth?

835
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,079
- What truth?
- That I have...

836
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:57,119
...after many hours of the deepest
and the most painful consideration...

837
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,799
...come to the conclusion
that I am not worthy of you.

838
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,519
- Not worthy of me?
- I'm totally unworthy.

839
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,319
Oh! You are joking.

840
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:11,759
No.

841
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,879
Will you kindly explain
to me what you are saying?

842
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,919
The terms your father offered
were... more than generous.

843
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,519
But you despise the idea
of marrying into trade.

844
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:26,520
- No, I don't despise it. I...
- Then what are you saying?

845
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,639
Ernestina, I have realised
during these last days...

846
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:34,679
...that far too great a part of
my regard for you has been ignoble.

847
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:38,999
I was far more tempted by your father's
fortune than I cared to admit.

848
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,279
Now that I've seen that to be the truth...

849
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,679
Are you saying...

850
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:48,680
...that you have... never loved me?

851
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:55,760
I am not worthy of you.

852
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:06,960
Tina, dear.

853
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,999
Charles?

854
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,839
I know I am spoilt.

855
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,840
I know I am not unusual.

856
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,359
But under your love and protection...

857
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:31,360
...I believed I would become... better.

858
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,639
I would do anything, you see.

859
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:39,640
I would... I would abandon
anything to make you happy.

860
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:56,199
You are lying.

861
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:01,200
Something else has happened.

862
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:04,479
Yes.

863
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:08,719
Who?

864
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,279
You don't know her.

865
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,639
I don't know her?

866
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:17,279
I've known her... many years.

867
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,079
I thought the attachment was broken.

868
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,839
I discovered in London that it is not.

869
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,039
- Why did you not tell me?
- I hoped to spare you the pain of it.

870
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:29,119
Or yourself the shame of it!

871
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,559
Who is she?!

872
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:36,560
What woman would be so vile
as to make a man break his vows?

873
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,439
- I can guess she is married.
- I will not discuss her.

874
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:44,440
- I came here to tell you the truth...
- Truth?! You are a liar!

875
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:50,360
My father will drag your name,
both your names, through the mire!

876
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:54,599
<i>You will be spurned
and detested by all that know you!</i>

877
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:59,600
<i>You will be hounded out of England!</i>

878
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:05,119
<i>- (knock</i>
_ <i>Mm? my)</i>

879
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,359
What the devil do you want? I didn't ring.

880
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:12,360
I brought you a glass of brandy, sir.
I thought you might want it.

881
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,559
It's never true, sir?

882
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,759
Yes, it is true. Miss Freeman
and I are no longer to marry.

883
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,199
Now go. And keep your mouth shut.

884
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,279
- Did you hear what I said?
-Yes, sir. Only, with respect...

885
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,559
...I have to consider me own situation.
- What?!

886
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:35,560
Will you be residing in London
from now on, sir?

887
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:40,079
- We shall probably go abroad.
- Oh, well. I beg to advise you, sir...

888
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,879
...I won't be accompanying you. And I'm
not coming back to Exeter, neither.

889
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:48,159
I'm leaving your employ, as I ought
to have done when all this started.

890
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,679
- Go to hell!
- Don't fancy nowhere, sir...

891
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:55,479
...as I might meet a friend of yours.

892
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,599
- Sam!
- if you wish for attention...

893
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,600
"ring for one of the hotel domestics.

894
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:14,760
Wait here.

895
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,559
- Miss Woodruff expects me.
- The young lady's left, sir.

896
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,119
- Left? You mean gone out?
- No, sir. I mean left.

897
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,199
- She took the London train this afternoon.
- What?

898
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:32,200
She took the three o'clock to London.
Didn't leave no address.

899
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:36,039
- You're lying.
- Where are you going?!

900
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,399
Sir! Wait a minute!

901
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,559
What are you doing?!

902
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,639
- Sarah?
- Sir! You can't do that!

903
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,039
You've no right! You're trespassin'!

904
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:53,040
- Did you hear what I said?!
- Get out!

905
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:26,399
<i>(phone rings)</i>

906
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:30,359
Hello? Hello?!

907
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:35,360
Room 516.

908
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,159
- Who was that?
- I don't know. He put the phone down.

909
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:47,160
- Who did?
- I don't know. He didn't say.

910
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:54,080
- Maybe it was a wrong number.
- Yes, maybe.

911
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,599
<i>(swing music playing on stereo)</i>

912
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,919
All right, I'll get you
some more in a moment. Hang on.

913
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:04,079
Darling, do go and play in the garden.

914
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:09,080
- Lucy! Lucy, I found it!
- Can I try some?

915
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,439
<i>(turns down music)</i>

916
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,399
- You all right?
- Mm?

917
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,159
Yeah.

918
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,559
Fine.

919
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,679
Listen, what about having
some people to lunch on Sunday?

920
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:26,119
- What people?
- Oh, you know, some of the cast.

921
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,719
Fine.

922
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:31,879
The film's nearly over, and Anna
has to get back to the States.

923
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,119
You know.

924
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:37,119
Fine. As long as it's not the entire unit.

925
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:42,120
Oh, no. Just, you know...

926
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:47,280
Fine.

927
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,359
<i>(rings)</i>

928
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,999
<i>- Hello?
- Is that Davide? This is Mike.</i>

929
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,159
<i>We're having a lunch party
on Sunday. Can you both come?</i>

930
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:01,879
I'll give you Anna.

931
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,639
- Hello?
- <i>is that you? It's me.</i>

932
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,399
- Hi.
- Where are you? <i>You'd</i> gone.

933
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,799
<i>- You weren't in your hotel room.
- What'!?</i>

934
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,199
<i>- In Exeter.
- Oh!</i>

935
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,719
Come to lunch on Sunday.

936
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,239
By the way, I love you.

937
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:22,719
Oh, great. Um... sure, we'd love to come.

938
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,239
- I'll... see you then.
- <i>I</i> said <i>I</i> love <i>you!</i>

939
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:30,240
Bye.

940
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,319
Lunch on Sunday.

941
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:38,799
"Will Miss Sarah Woodruff urgently
communicate her whereabouts...

942
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,999
...to Montague, Chancery Lane."

943
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,079
Yes, very well worth it, I should say.

944
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,159
Now, Mr Smithson...

945
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:49,719
...I shan't pretend to you
that it's going to be an easy task.

946
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,839
But I have four good men,
and they'll go on the job at once.

947
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,719
We'll try the educational boards
of all the church schools.

948
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,599
We shall also investigate
these new female clerical agencies.

949
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,239
- They're growing up like wildfire.
- Yes! Yes, where else?

950
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:08,039
And we shall investigate
all the girls' academies in London.

951
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,039
Yes.

952
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:15,040
I shall also be examining
the Register of Deaths.

953
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:20,279
Very good.

954
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:24,199
Try everything, Mr Grimes.

955
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,319
One last question, sir, for the moment.

956
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:32,320
Does the lady wish to be found,
would you say, or not?

957
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:37,360
I cannot say.

958
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:48,480
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

959
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:53,600
"We are instructed by Mr Ernest Freeman,
father of Miss Ernestina Freeman...

960
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:57,439
...to request you to attend these chambers
at three o'clock this Friday."

961
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:02,239
"Failure to attend will be regarded as an
acknowledgment of our right to proceed."

962
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:06,399
- "Aubrey and Baggott."
- And what does it mean?

963
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:10,039
It means they have cold feet.
But they're not letting us off altogether.

964
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:14,639
My guess is we will be asked
to make a confessio delicti.

965
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:17,439
- To acknowledge my guilt?
- Mm.

966
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,919
Just so. I'm afraid we must
anticipate an ugly document.

967
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,239
But I can only advise you to sign it.

968
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,959
We have no case.

969
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:31,960
Remember the skirt's going to be grey.

970
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,519
Oh, yeah.

971
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:39,439
Oh, it's great. It's great.

972
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,359
- I'm gonna like her in this.
- OK.

973
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:47,360
"L, Charles Henry Smithson, solely by my
desire to declare the truth, admit that one:

974
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,999
...I contracted to marry
Miss Ernestina Freeman."

975
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,079
"Two: I was given no cause whatsoever
to break my solemn contract."

976
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,959
"Three: I was fully and exactly
apprised of her rank in society...

977
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,159
...her character, marriage portion
and future prospects...

978
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,639
...before my engagement to her hand."

979
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:08,799
"Four: I did break that contract
without any justification whatsoever...

980
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,359
...beyond my own criminal
selfishness and lust."

981
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:17,360
"Five: I entered into a clandestine liaison
with a person named Sarah Woodruff."

982
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:21,319
"Six: my conduct throughout this matter
has been dishonourable."

983
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:25,639
"By it I have for ever forfeited
the right to be considered a gentleman."

984
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:30,640
"The injured party may make whatsoever
she desires of this document."

985
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:37,159
- You are entitled to withdraw with me...
- it will not be necessary.

986
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:41,039
But I have one question. What does...

987
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:45,999
..."The injured party may make whatever
she desires of this... document" mean?

988
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,119
It means precisely what it says.

989
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:52,239
She might, for instance, wish to
have it published in The Times.

990
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:57,240
- And she would be free to do that?
- She would indeed.

991
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:04,400
I will sign.

992
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:58,720
(coachman) Whoa, there! Whoa!

993
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,879
(man) Go on, get out!
Throw her out! She picked my pocket!

994
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,880
Get out!

995
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,399
Call the police!

996
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:51,400
Don't let her get away!
Come on, call the police!

997
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:43,640
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I...

998
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,479
- Hello. I saw you through the window.
- Hi. Are you Lizzie?

999
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:08,479
- Yes, I am.
- Can we come in?

1000
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,879
- Come in.
- Hello, Anna.

1001
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:15,880
Hi, Sonia. Nice to see you.

1002
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:22,800
- Like some more wine?
- Please. Some white.

1003
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:29,600
<i>(girl) 13-14.</i>

1004
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:40,479
- Can I have a drink?
- All right. Shall we go and get one?

1005
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:44,319
- Excuse me for a minute.
- 14-all.

1006
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,519
I must say, they have
a lovely garden, don't they?

1007
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,239
- Mm.
- So serene.

1008
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:56,240
Of course, she seems so serene,
doesn't she? The wife.

1009
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:01,759
Look at their little girl.
Isn't she lovely? Such a pretty little thing.

1010
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,159
Aren't you a pretty little thing?

1011
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,919
- Who made that dress for you?
- <i>I</i> don't know.

1012
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:11,920
- Having a good time?
- Good.

1013
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,519
Have they decided how to end the movie?

1014
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,919
- End it?
- I hear they keep changing the script.

1015
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:23,039
- Not at all. Where did you hear that?
- Well, there are two endings in the book.

1016
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,839
A happy ending
and an unhappy ending, no?

1017
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,479
We're going for the first ending -
I mean the second ending.

1018
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:32,719
- Which one is that?
- Hasn't Anna told you?

1019
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,999
<i>(dog barks)</i>

1020
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,519
Manders. Manders! (whistles)

1021
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,279
Come on. Good girl. Come on.

1022
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:45,280
(laughing) There's a good girl. Yes.

1023
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,159
Oh!

1024
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:58,160
It's a really great... garden.

1025
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:06,800
- Who takes care of it for you?
- I do.

1026
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,279
- All by yourself?
- Mm, mostly.

1027
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:14,359
- What about Mike? Doesn't he help you?
- Oh, when he's here.

1028
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,639
A bit.

1029
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:21,640
He's pretty lazy, actually.

1030
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:28,999
I really... envy you.

1031
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,359
Envy me? Why?

1032
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:37,360
Well...

1033
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,599
For being able to create
such a lovely garden.

1034
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,999
<i>(Sonia laughs)</i>

1035
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Oh, I wouldn't bother
to envy me if I were you.

1036
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,599
Would you like a drink?

1037
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,399
Mm.

1038
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:01,400
<i>(plays the Adagio
from Mozart's Sonata in D)</i>

1039
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,000
- I want to show you something.
- All right, darling. Go and show Mummy.

1040
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:41,880
Anna.

1041
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:45,599
- This is pure bloody hell.
- I know.

1042
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,199
- Mike...
- We've got to talk.

1043
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:50,519
- All right. Not now.
- When?

1044
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:53,959
- Windermere.
- But that's our last scene.

1045
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,879
- We've got to talk properly.
- What are we going to say?

1046
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:59,639
- We've got to decide what we want.
- I know.

1047
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:03,439
- (Davide) Have you seen Anna?
- I think she's upstairs.

1048
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:06,719
I'm coming.

1049
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:11,519
Sonia... Thank you.
The afternoon, it was just lovely.

1050
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,639
- I had a wonderful time.
- (Sonia) Thank you.

1051
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:17,999
- Good to meet you.
- And you.

1052
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,000
- Good luck with the last scene.
- Thank you! We'll need it.

1053
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:14,719
Sir, a telegram for you.

1054
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:19,720
Sir?

1055
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:55,679
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1056
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,439
- I'm Tom Elliott. Who are you?
- My name is Smithson.

1057
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:03,319
- Mama and Papa are abroad.
-Yes. I was looking for a Mrs Roughwood.

1058
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:08,320
I'll find her for you.

1059
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:15,160
- (girl) You put that one in there.
- Mrs Roughwood?

1060
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:20,799
- Mrs Roughwood?
- (woman) She's with Rachel and William.

1061
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,759
- Mrs Roughwood?
- Yes?

1062
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:26,999
- Someone to see you.
- All right.

1063
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:32,000
She's working, but she
doesn't mind being interrupted.

1064
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,119
Mrs Roughwood?

1065
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:07,799
Mr Smithson?

1066
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,279
My solicitor was told
you lived at this address.

1067
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:15,959
- I do not know by whom.
- By me.

1068
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:20,399
BY You?!

1069
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:23,799
I've been looking for you for three years.

1070
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:26,319
I broke off my engagement.

1071
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:31,320
I came back for you to take you with me,
to marry you... and you'd gone.

1072
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:36,079
And now all these years later you choose
to let me know you're alive. Why?

1073
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:39,599
I could not do so before this.

1074
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:44,039
- You've married.
- Oh, no, I have not.

1075
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:47,559
I pass as a widow in the world.

1076
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:51,919
- What is this house?
- He is an architect. His name is Elliott.

1077
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,759
They gave me shelter a long time ago.

1078
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:59,719
I am tutor to their children,
but... I am free to do my own work.

1079
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:02,199
They have encouraged it.

1080
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:07,200
- These are yours?
- Mm. Yes.

1081
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,879
You have found your gift.

1082
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,039
Why did you leave Exeter?

1083
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:20,040
You told me you loved me.
You showed me your love.

1084
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:28,840
Answer me!

1085
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:34,360
There was madness in me... at that time.

1086
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:39,279
A bitterness, an envy.

1087
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:44,280
I forced myself on you, knowing
that you had other obligations.

1088
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,079
It was unworthy!

1089
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:52,080
I saw after you had gone that I had
to destroy what had begun between us!

1090
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:57,520
Are you saying that you never loved me?

1091
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:02,079
- I could not say that.
- But you must say that!

1092
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:04,359
You must say "I am totally evil."

1093
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:07,239
"I used him as an instrument."

1094
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,199
"I do not care
that in all this time...

1095
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:13,039
...he hasn't seen a woman
to compare with me...

1096
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:16,079
...that his life has been
a desert without me...

1097
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,199
...that he sacrificed everything for me."

1098
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:22,719
- Say it!
- No. No.

1099
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:26,999
Why did you ask me here?
What do you want from me?

1100
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,959
- I saw the newspaper advertisements...
- You saw them?

1101
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:33,399
- You read them, and you did nothing?
- I'd changed my name.

1102
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:35,999
You ruined my life
and took pleasure in doing so!

1103
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
You misjudge me! It has taken me
this time to find my own life!

1104
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:47,079
It has taken me this time
to find... my freedom.

1105
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:49,799
- Freedom?!
- Yes.

1106
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:52,999
To make a mockery of love,
of all human feeling?

1107
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,359
Is that what Exeter meant to you? One
brief transaction of the flesh, just that?

1108
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:58,999
You planted a dagger in me...

1109
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,239
...and your "freedom" gives you
license to twist it in my heart?!

1110
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:04,319
- Well, no more.
- No!

1111
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:09,320
Yes!

1112
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:23,400
Mr Smithson...

1113
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:29,120
...I called you here
to ask your forgiveness.

1114
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:39,039
You loved me once.

1115
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:42,239
If you still love me, you <i>can</i> forgive me.

1116
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:47,240
I know... I know it is
your perfect right to damn me.

1117
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,119
But if you do...

1118
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:56,120
...still love me...

1119
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:05,720
Then I must... forgive you.

1120
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:12,440
Yes, you must.

Oh, are you going?

1126
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:25,320
Take care.
