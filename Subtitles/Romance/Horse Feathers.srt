in retiring as president

00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,474
Sometimes I went
without my supper and
didn't go to bed at all.

A college widow stood for
something in those days.

In fact,
she stood for plenty.

00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,230
There's nothing wrong

the college widow.

taught you in college.

to go, you leave me.

Well, move over
and I'll talk to
the next fellow.

159
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,974
But a college needs
something else
besides education.

160
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,310
What this college needs
is a good football team.

161
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,312

a good football team

football players.

My boy,
I think you've got
something there,

164
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,277
and I'll wait outside
until you clean it up.

165
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,821
I know it's dangerous,
but I'm gonna ask you
one more question.

166

Where do you get
good football players?

167
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,617
Well, in the
speakeasy down...
In a speakeasy?

168
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,912
Isn't that against the law?
Selling football players
in a speakeasy?

football players
in the country

hang out in the
speakeasy downtown.

Are you suggesting
that I, the president
of Huxley College,

172
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,545
go into a speakeasy
without even giving
me the address?

173
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,882
It's at 42 Elm Street,
but you can't go there.
It's unethical.

174
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,051
It isn't right for a college
to buy football players.

175

It isn't, eh? Well,
I'll nip that in the bud.

176
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,180
How about coming along
and having a nip yourself?

177

you wait here.

"Anything further, Father?"

179

That can't be right. Isn't it,
"Anything, Father, further?"

180
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,773

okay with us,

gonna fix it?

about the dough?

It's the name
of a fish.

Is it Mary?

That's no fish.

She isn't?
Well, she drinks
like one.

Is it sturgeon?

Eh, you crazy.

232
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,471
Sturgeon is a doctor

when you sick.

one more chance.

I got a haddock
too.

for a haddock?
Well, sometimes
I take aspirin.

I take a calomel.

for a calomel.

I'm dealing with
a couple of snakes.

338
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,104
What I meant to say was that
there's too much football
and not enough education.

339
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,856
BOTH: That's what I think.

340
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,900
Oh, you do, do you?
Well, you're wrong again.

341
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,152
If there was a snake here,
I'd apologize.

342
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,488
Where would this college
be without football?

343
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,156
Have we got a stadium?
BOTH: Yes.

344
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,699
Have we got a college?
BOTH: Yes.

345
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,410
We can't support both.
Tomorrow we start
tearing down the college.

346
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,996
BOTH: But, Professor,
where will the students sleep?

347
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,248
Where they always sleep.
In the classroom.

348
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,336
Oh, Professor, the Dean of
Science wants to know
how soon you can see him.

349
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,463
He says he's tired
of cooling his heels
out here.

350
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,299
Tell him I'm cooling
a couple of heels in here.

351
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,260
Where were we?
Oh, yes.

352
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,306
How much am I
paying you fellows?

353
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,142
5,000, a year.
But we've
never been paid.

354
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,937
Well, in that case,
I'll raise you to 8,000,
and a bonus.

355
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,106
Bring your dog around,
I'll give him a bonus too.

356
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,276
The dean is furious.
He's waxing wrath.

357
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,989
Is Roth out there too?
Tell Roth to wax
the dean for a while.

358
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,032
Guess that's bad, huh?

359
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:09,035
One more thing,
Professor.
It's about your son.

360
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,707
I'm afraid he's paying
too little attention
to his studies

361
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,626
and too much
to Connie Bailey,
the college widow.

362
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,754
He is, eh?
I'll put a stop to that.
I'll call her up right now.

363
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,048
Have either of you weasels
got her phone number?

364
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:25,135
BOTH: No!
Well, it's a good thing
I've got it.

365
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,848
Get me Maine 49970
and reverse the charges.

366
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:31,808
You may go now.

367
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,810
Drop this in the mailbox
on your way out.

368
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,228
(BUZZING)

369
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,440
Hello.
I wanna speak
to Miss Bailey.

370
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,275
Is this Miss Bailey?

371
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,735
Mmm-hmm.

372
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,988
Why, of course
I know your son.

373
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:49,534
Why, that's silly.
We're just very
good friends.

374
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,663
But, Professor,
I don't understand.

375
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,958
You don't, eh?
Well, I wanna see you.
Come right over to my office.

376
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,418
You can't?
You're in bed?

377
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,420
Well, in that case,
I'll come over
to your office.

378
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,397
That's a fine way
to carry ice.
Where are your tongs?

379
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,982
Looks like a tong war.

380
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,320
Well, that's the last time
we deliver ice unless
you pay the bill.

381
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,572
How much
do we owe you?
$2,000.

382
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,074
$2,000, for ice?

383
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,826
I can get an Eskimo
for $200 and
make my own ice.

384
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,380
I can do for you,
I make you proposition.

385
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,717
You owe us $200.
We take 2,000
and call it square.

386
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,929
That's not a bad idea.
I'll tell you.
I'll consult my lawyer,

387
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,264
and if he advises
me to do it,
I'll get a new lawyer.

388
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,766
Why don't you
forget about the money.

389
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,019
Go to college, meet
all the beautiful girls.
Get yourself a co-ed.

390
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,646
Ha! I got a co-ed.

391
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,649
Last week for $18
I got a co-ed with
two pair of pants.

392
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,569
Since when has a co-ed
got two pair of pants?
Since I joined the college.

393
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,072
Baravelli, you've got
the brain of a
four-year-old boy,

394
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,740
and I bet he was glad
to get rid of it.

395
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,827
Well, now that
you're a college boy,
here's your hat.

396
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,746
Here's your pennant.
Here's your coat.

397
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,338
Alright, report
for football practice
in the morning.

398
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,090
Now, I want you to
sign this agreement.

399
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,591
Hey, there's nothing
on this paper.

400
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,176
That's all right.
We'll fill in
something later.

401
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,139
Put your name
on there, huh?

402
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,183
Gee, I didn't know
you could write.

403
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,435
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
This isn't legal.

404
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,229
There's no seal on it.
Where's the seal?

405
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,856
Where's the seal?
Where's the seal?

406
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,274
Where's the seal?
Where's the seal?

407
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,984
BOTH: Where's the seal?

408
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,527
(BARKING)

409
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:55,451
And thus we see that
the function of the
respiratory system

410
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,371
is to transmit oxygen
into the bloodstream.

411
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,749
This process,
which is called osmosis...

412
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,586
Have they started sawing
a woman in half yet?

413
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,963
Oh, Mr. President,
this is indeed a pleasure.

414
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,339
What brings you here?

415
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,383
A bicycle,
but I left it
out in the hall.

416
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,469
Have you got two empty
dunce chairs? I brought
you two empty dunces.

417
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,723
Come in, dunces.
Here they are.
Ten cents a dunce.

418
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,812
Well, all you
need now is
a bowl of cherries.

419
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,231
Find yourselves
a couple of seats.

420
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,410
Now, let us go on
with our lecture.

421
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,205
I wish you'd go on
without your lecture.

422
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,665
What do you think
of that slide?

423
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,085
Well, I think
he was safe at second,
but it was very close.

424
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,922
Now let us examine
the circulatory system.

425
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,591
Here is the liver.

426
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,886
What, no bacon?
I'd send that back
if I were you.

427
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:58,723
"The liver,
if neglected, invariably
leads to cirrhosis."

428
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,935
Of course, you are
all familiar with
the symptoms of cirrhosis.

429
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,269
Sure.

430
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,230
"So-roses are red,
so-violets are blue,

431
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,523
"so-sugar is sweet,
so-so are you."

432
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,860
(GROANS)
I can't see him,
but I bet I know who it is.

433
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,738
"For the protection
of the heart, or cardium,

434
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:18,117
"Mother Nature
has provided a sac
called the pericardium."

435
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,577
Any questions?

436
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,247
Yes. When you gonna
cut the watermelon open?

437
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:28,169
"Psychopathically,
the duodenum is
in inverse ratio

438
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,381
"to the coordination
of the planephas."

439
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,175
Is this stuff on the level
or are you just making
it up as you go along?

440
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,927
My feet are getting
tired from this walk.

441
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:40,098
Why, everything I told you
can be found in the simplest
textbook on anatomy.

442
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,517
I'm sure my students
will bear me out.

443
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,060
We bear you out.

444
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,402
And let that be a lesson
to every one of you.

445
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,613
This school was here
before you came, and it'll
be here before you go.

446
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,532
And you, too,
you numbskull.

447
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,045
You've got some nerve.
Leave me alone.

448
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,094
Let us follow
a corpuscle
on its journey.

449
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,223
Oh, my mistake.
I thought I was a corpuscle.

450
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,935
As you know, there is
constant warfare between
the red and white corpuscles.

451
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,313
Now, then, baboons,
what is a corpuscle?

452
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,939
BARAVELLI: That's easy.

453
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,860
First it's a captain,
then it's a lieutenant,
then it's a corpuscle.

454
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:38,031
That's fine. Why don't you
bore a hole in yourself
and let the sap run out?

455
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,285
We now find ourselves
among the Alps.

456
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,955
The Alps are a very simple
people living on a diet of
rice and old shoes.

457
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,707
Beyond the Alps
lies more Alps.

458
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,293
And the Lord Alps those
that Alps themselves.

459
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,961
We then come
to the bloodstream.

460
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,172
The blood rushes
from the head
down to the feet,

461
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,632
gets a look at those feet
and rushes back
to the head again.

462
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,052
This is known
as Auction Pinochle.

463
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,347
WAGSTAFF: Now, in studying
your basic metabolism,

464
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,848
we first listen
to your hearts beat.

465
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,975
If your hearts beat
anything but
diamonds and clubs,

466
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,728
it's because your partner
is cheating or your wife.

467
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,522
Now, take this point,
for instance.

468
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,902
That reminds me.
I haven't seen
my son all day.

469
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,905
Well, the human body
takes many strange forms.

470
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,283
Now, here is
a most unusual organ.

471
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:26,037
The organ will play
a solo immediately after
the feature picture.

472
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,207
WAGSTAFF: Scientists
make these deductions
by examining a rat

473
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,792
or your landlord
who won't cut the rent.

474
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,960
And what do they find?
Asparagus.

475
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,254
Now, on closer examination...

476
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,925
Hmm. This needs
closer examination.

477
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,177
In fact,
it needs a nightgown.

478
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,347
Baravelli,
who's responsible for this?
Is this your picture?

479
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,516
I don't think so.
It doesn't look like me.

480
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,394
Well, take it out
of here immediately and
hang it up in my bedroom.

481
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,479
Now then, out with it.
Who did it?

482
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,857
WAGSTAFF:
Oh, so you're the culprit.

483
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,027
Young man, as you grow older,
you'll find you can't burn
the candle at both ends.

484
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,115
Well, I was wrong.

485
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,783
I knew there was
something you couldn't
burn at both ends,

486
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,034
I thought it was
a candle.

487
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,536
However,
you must be punished.

488
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,121
Just for that,
you stay after school.

489
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,581
But, Professor,
I didn't do anything.

490
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,209
I know, but there's no fun
in keeping him after school.

491
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:17,088
Now, we'll have
no more interruptions.

492
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,716
According to Von Sternmetz,
the eminent physiologist,

493
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,261
"There is ever present
a group of white
phagocytes..."

494
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,477
According to Von Sternmetz,
the eminent physiologist,

495
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,689
"There is present a group
of white phagocytes..."

496
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,361
According to Von...

497
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,072
According
to Von Sternmetz...

498
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,078
According to Von Sternmetz,
the eminent physiologist,

499
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,414
"There is present a group
of white phagocytes..."

500
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,334
They are ever present
and they are essential...

501
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,879
They are essential
to prolonging life.

502
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,342
My left wing has been turned.
My rear end has been cut off.

503
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:06,846
But I'll fight it out
on these lines if it
takes all summer.

504
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,514
They got me.

505
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,517
(PHONE RINGING)

506
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,857
Hello.

507
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,026
Oh, it's you, Frank.

508
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,989
Why, of course.
I'd love to have
you come over.

509
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,992
All right. I'll be
expecting you, then.

510
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,203
Good-bye, darling.

511
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,830
Who were you
calling "darling?"

512
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,541
Oh. Frank Wagstaff,
the professor's son.

513
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,710
Say, I didn't tell you
to fall for him.

514
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,296
I just told you
to find out all you
could about his team.

515
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,798
Well, he said
it was a cinch
for Huxley to win.

516
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:47,094
Listen, I've got
my bankroll bet on Darwin
and I'm taking no chances.

517
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,139
Before the game starts,
I'll have the Huxley signals.

518
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,934
Now, here's down
the hatch and on my way.

519
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,190
See you later.

520
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,901
Good-bye, dear.

521
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:20,419
Are you still here?
I just came in.

522
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,966
What do you mean,
am I still here?
(GIGGLES)

523
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,593
Oh, I mean,
are you here already?

524
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,428
You know, I really
shouldn't be here.

525
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,056
The old man gave me
a terrible bawling
out for seeing you.

526
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,935
Oh, let's not worry
about him. He'll never
know you were here.

527
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,854
How about
a little drink?
All right.

528
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,898
I'll get you one.
Please.

529
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,083
Are you Miss Bailey?

530
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,335
Come, come. One of us
is Miss Bailey, and I'm not.

531
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,129
I'm Miss Bailey
and who are you?

532
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,131
I'm Professor Wagstaff.
Who are you?

533
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,633
Miss Bailey.
Ah, then you are
Miss Bailey.

534
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,969
Thought you could
slip one over on me,
didn't you?

535
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,679
Listen, madam, you've
gotta give my son up.

536
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,723
Give him up?
You can't
take him from me.

537
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,641
He's all I've got
in the world,
except a picture

538
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,435
of George Washington
crossing the Delaware.

539
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,562
But, Professor, I...
Whatever you say
is a lie.

540
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,356
He's only a shell
of his former self,
which nobody can deny.

541
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,441
Whoopee!
(SCOFFS)

542
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,651
I tell you, you're
ruining that boy.
You're ruining him.

543
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,237
Did my son tell you,
you had beautiful eyes?

544
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:29,322
Why, yes.

545
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,949
He told me that too.
He tells that to
everyone he meets.

546
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,784
Oh, I love sitting
on your lap.

547
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,163
I could sit here all day
if you didn't stand up.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,874
Quick! Hurry!
Get out of here.
That door.

549
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,508
I don't want any ice.

550
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:50,968
Oh!

(SHATTERING)

552
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,440
Who was that?
The iceman.

553
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,902
Is that so? Well, you can't
pull the wool over my ice.
Oh!

554
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,780
That iceman stuff
leaves me cold.

555
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:11,947
Here you are...

556
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:15,451
So I caught you at last.
You are fooling around
with this woman.

557
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,119
Oh, the shame of it.

558
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,955
That I should live to see
a son of mine try to take
a dame away from his father.

559
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,874
Dad, I can...
Enough of this.
You leave here immediately,

560
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,793
and I'll stay here
and settle
with this woman.

561
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,795
As soon as we're
settled, we'll have
you over for dinner.

562
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,255
On second thought,
I'll go with you.
Come. Follow me.

563
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,640
Be a lamp in the window
for my wandering boy.

564
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,019
Let's see, where...
Oh, yes.
I was on your lap

565
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,648
and doing pretty well
as I recall it.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

566
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,026
Quick. Hurry.
Get out. Hurry.

567
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,654
And remember,
stay undercover.

568
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,490
You've got more students
than the college.

569
00:33:58,245 --> 00:33:59,578
Here, lady,
you dropped your ice.

570
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,415
But I don't
want any ice.
Neither do I.

(SHATTERING)

572
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,005
Now do you
want any ice?
No.

573

Oh, you're beautiful.
Ah, so nice.

575
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,764
Baravelli, you overcome me.
But remember
it was your idea.

576
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:19,974
No.

577
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,517
Lady, I like you.

578
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,853
You got something,
but I don't
know what it is.

579
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,771
I'm gonna tell him
he's crazy.

580
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,451
Professor, I no see you.
What are you doing here?

581
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,036
Nothing right now, but
I was doing all right
till you came in.

582
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,538
Oh! So you know
the professor.

583
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,374
Sure. He put me
in business. He got me
on the football team.

584
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:48,210
Now all I gotta do
is get him off the couch.

585
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,172
Have you read
any good books lately?

doing this all day.

Pretty popular place,
isn't it?

591
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,534
Yes, a hot dog stand
would clean up here.

00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,411
What are you
doing here?
Why, me?

593
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,914
I'm the music teacher.
I give her singing lessons.

594
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,833
Since when are you
taking singing lessons?
Since you came in.

595
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,585
What are you
doing here?
I'm the plumber.

596
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,171
I'm just hanging around
in case something goes
wrong with her pipes.

597
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,757
That's the first time
I've used that joke
in 20 years.

598
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,343
Now, take
a deep breath
and follow me.

You sing high, huh?

00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,370
Yes, I have
a falsetto voice.

604
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,704
That's funny.
My last pupil,

605
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,248
she got a
false set of teeth.

606
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,667
Maybe for the first
lesson, it's better
if you don't sing.

607
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,837
And if you don't sing,
I think it's much
better yet. I'll sing.

608
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,756
Everyone says I love you

Colombo do

He say to Pocahontas
Hacha, facha, cacha coo!

That means, you little
son of a gun, I love you!

624
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,259
Maybe it's better if
I don't sing too, huh?
Yes.

out of here.

go out into the lobby
till this thing blows over.

Well, that's all
for the first lesson.

632
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,763
I come back next week
and teach you
how to breathe.

633
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,391
And don't breathe
until I see you again.

a singing lesson,
I'm a ring-tailed monkey.

and keep your family
out of it. Baravelli!

Are you going
my way?

Sure.
Well, you go my way,
and I'll stay here.

guys here again,

640

it'll be curtains.
Now, on your way.

tell him to take the lamp
out of the window.

Dad, you've got
the wrong football
players.

643
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,802
You mean the whole team?
No. Baravelli
and the dogcatcher.

644
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,262
They're not
football players
at all.

645
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,556
They must be.
I got 'em out
of a speakeasy.

646
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,765
But you got
the wrong ones.

I told you about are
playing for Darwin.

648
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,894
Send for Baravelli.

stone unturned.

Baravelli, you can fix it
for our team to win.

I wanna play.

00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,636
All right. You can play.
There's two football players
on the Darwin team

659
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,055
I want kidnapped.

660
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,849
Have you ever had any
experience as a kidnapper?
You bet.

661
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,851
You know what I do
when I kidnap somebody?

662
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,146
First I call 'em up
on the telephone, then
I send 'em my chauffeur.

663
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,439
Oh, have you got
a chauffeur?
Yeah.

664
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,648
What kind of a car
have you got?

665
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,401
I no got a car.
I just got a chauffeur.

666
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,487
Maybe I'm crazy,
but when you have
a chauffeur,

667
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,030
aren't you supposed
to have a car?

668
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,114
Well, I had one.

669
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,700
But it cost too much
money to keep a car
and a chauffeur,

670
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,285
so I sold the car.

671
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,037
Well, that shows you
how little I know.

672
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,040
I would have kept the car
and sold the chauffeur.
That's no good.

673
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,793
I gotta have a chauffeur
to take me to work
in the morning.

674
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,170
If you've got no car,
how can he take you
to work?

675
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,714
He don't have
to take me to work.
I no got a job.

676
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,466
Baravelli,
this is the finish.

677
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,219
How much would you want
to stand at the wrong end
of a shooting gallery?

678
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,224
Now, now, now, boys.
Now, just a minute,
boys, just a minute.

679
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,101
Now let's forget what
happened yesterday.

680
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,477
I didn't come here
to fight.

681
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,395
You've got to fight.
I've already taken
my coat off.

682
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,231
I wanna talk to
Baravelli.

683
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,483
Now, you wouldn't mind
stepping out, would you?

684
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,319
I'd love to step out,
but I'd have to
see the girl first.

685
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,238
Baravelli, I've got
a proposition for you.

686
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,366
Watch yourself, Baravelli.
He's almost as crooked
as you are.

687
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,034
Let's go in here.

688
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:02,167
Baravelli, I want you
to do something for me.
I'm busy.

689
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,962
Me and my partner,
we gotta kidnap a couple
of football players

690
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,506
on the Darwin team.
Is that so?

691
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,591
You don't mean
MacHardie and Mullen?

692
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:13,762
That sounds something like it,
but the fellows I mean
are Mullen and MacHardie.

693
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,430
I'll give you a tip.

694
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,392
The boys you want
live at 39 Hanley Street.

695
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:22,437
That's fine, thanks.
Now, I want you to
do something for me.

696
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,523
What do you want?
Listen.

697
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,610
Give me the signals,
and this 500 bucks
is yours.

698
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,529
All right.

699
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,365
Here's the signals.

700
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,286
Hey, wait a minute.
These are the
wrong signals.

701
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:41,165
These are Darwin's signals.
Do you think I'd give you
$500 for Darwin's signals?

702
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,251
They cost me 200.
I guess I gotta make
a little profit.

(CLAPS, WHISTLES)

704
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,921
Say, listen, you've got
to get busy and get
those football signals.

705
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,839
But I thought you
were going to get them.

706
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:21,218
If I did, I wouldn't
be asking you to go
after them, would I?

707
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,970
Now look, all you've
got to do is to get
to Professor Wagstaff.

708
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,056
He's got the
Huxley signals,

709
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,434
and I'm depending
on you to get them
here before the game.

710
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,353
Yes, but how?

711
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,271
You know how.

712
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,982
Romance him, baby.
Romance him.

713
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,237
And remember,
all you're to get
is football signals.

Get stuck on each other
and begin to woo

a million more rabbits who

a flat bottom, but the girl at
the boathouse didn't have one.

think of something else.

I can't think of anything.

815

got an idea.

Come on. Get off that ball.
You're holding up the game.

985
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:43,837
Let's huddle up, men.

986
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,756
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
(ALL CHATTERING)

987
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,677
BARAVELLI: Hike!

988
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:56,016
Signal. Uno, due, tre, bendy.
This time, we go left endy.

989
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,268
Hike!

990
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,119
Nice work, Pinky!

991
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:23,377
Signal.

992
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,296
High diddle diddle,
the cat and the fiddle.

993
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,464
This time, I think
we go through
the middle. Hike!

994
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,178
(BARKING)

995
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,396
Hey, you're
running the wrong way!

01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,489
(PINKY WHISTLES)

997
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:14,678
We are gathered
together here

998
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:16,930
to join this man
and this woman

999
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:20,351
in the bonds of matrimony,
which is an honorable estate.

1000
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:23,687
Do you take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?

1001
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,272
I do.

1002
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,942
Do you take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1003
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,569
TOGETHER: We do.
