1
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,640
Excuse me.

2
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,080
Who are you? What do you want?
Why the hell do you speak german?

3
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,160
-What?
-What do you want?

4
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm hitching, and I was going to ask you
if I could hitch a ride, thats all. Take it easy.

5
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,040
Fuck!

6
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,560
Fuck! Fucking shit! FUCK!!

7
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,640
Shit! Damnit!

8
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,800
Hey, I'm talking to you!

9
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,960
Shit. Come on.
We gotta get out of here!

10
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,680
Mother fucking shit!

11
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,640
Like one corpse wasn't enough.
Now I'm dragging 2 mother-fucking corpses!!

12
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
What did you say?

13
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Are you okay?

14
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,240
-Yeah, I'm ok.
-Good. Get the hell out!

15
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,520
Ouch.
I Think there's something wrong with my neck!

16
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,120
-I said: GET OUT!
-Hear me out.

17
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,640
You almost killed me, but I'm still alive.
And you're happy you didn't kill me.

18
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,160
Why not show me a little of that
happiness by letting me tag along?

19
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,920
Please.

20
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,080
Come sit up front.

21
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
My name is Daniel.

22
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
Isa.

23
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Okay, Daniel.

24
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,680
Where are you from?

25
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,400
Hamburg.

26
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,160
My ant lives in Hamburg.

27
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,960
What do you do for a living?

28
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,920
I'm an teacher's apprentice.

29
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,080
-I'm gonna be a teacher.
-A teacher? You?

30
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,200
Shit, really!
You don't look like a teacher.

31
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,480
What do I look like?

32
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
Don't know. You look more like a bum.

33
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
Going to the south?

34
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,160
-To Turky.
-I see.

35
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,960
Going on vacation?

36
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,080
Nope.

37
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,240
I'm looking for a girl.

38
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,600
Your wife?

39
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,000
Nope.

40
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,320
Are you in love?

41
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,840
Cool. Tell me everything.

42
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,520
It's a pretty long story.

43
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,440
We have a hell of a long ride ahead of us.

44
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,800
By using Newton's law
on the problem, we see -

45
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,720
- that speed is the most 
important factor.

46
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,960
How fast must X accelerate from
a ramp with an angle of 10 grades -

47
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,160
- to surpass 25 metres of
gravitational power?

48
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Anette?

49
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,360
-Anette?
-Don't you see I'm busy?

50
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,040
-Ernie?
-No idea, old man.

51
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,880
Kira?

52
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,560
We cant have ordinary class the
last day before the summer vacation!

53
54:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:09,569
-What are we supposed to do instead?
-We end it.

54
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,640
-Good bye, Mr. Bannier.
-Good bye, Kira.

55
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,640
Have a good vacation.

56
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,120
He walks past you every day, and
you still haven't talked to him?

57
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,320
-I'm to shy.
-You? Shy?

58
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Shit.

59
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,280
That's him!

60
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,920
-That guy with the glasses!
-Come on, talk with him!

61
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,400
Hey you!

62
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Come here.

63
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
It seems like you can need some luck.

64
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,040
-I'm in more need of a new bag.
-What is this?

65
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,320
-A sun.
-What is a sun?

66
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,320
A ball of gas that the earth, 
as well as eight other planets orbit.

67
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,840
The sun light up life. For you,
for her and for me.

68
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,800
-Another word for light is..?
-Energy?

69
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,880
-Another word for light is luck.
-Ah, ok, the ring brings luck.

70
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,520
-You're really smart.
-I'll be a teacher soon.

71
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,720
A teacher? Really?
That's funny.

72
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,320
-What is your name?
-Daniel. Daniel Bannier.

73
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,520
Wonderful name.

74
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
-And what is your name?
-I'm July, like the month.

75
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
What about the ring?

76
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,880
It's an old maya-ring. The legend
tells us, that the one who carries the ring, -

77
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,920
can recognize luck.

78
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,800
You will soon meet a woman that
also carry a symbol of the sun.

79
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,720
It's only she that can bring you 
true happiness.

80
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,160
-How much?
-50.

81
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,200
-Don't you like it?
-Yes, but...

82
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,440
Why don't you fight a little for it then?

83
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,480
-Ok, 30.
-40.

84
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,960
35. It's all that I've got.
But I really want the ring.

85
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,800
Ok, but only because I like you.

86
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,840
-Thank you.
-Wait.

87
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,840
This is tonight. Stop by.

88
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,760
Thank you so much.

89
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,520
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Me to.

90
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
Bye.

91
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,800
-July?
-Yes?

92
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,560
-What was that?
-That was Daniel Bannier.

93
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,240
Yes, I got that, but what's
so special about him?

94
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,000
He's got something deep inside of
him, waiting to be released.

95
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,000
Like what?

96
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,600
-Hey! 1.person, singular, teacher!
-Hello, Kodjo.

97
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,120
I'm going to Jamaica, to drink
cold pina colada, smoke weed, -

98
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,440
- and look for the Kini sisters.
Do you know the Kini sisters?

99
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,400
-Don't think so, Kodjo.
-Bikini and zukini.

100
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,880
-Where are you going on vacation?
-This year i'm staying in Hamburg.

101
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,000
Stay here? Won't you go anywhere at all?
You need some sun.

102
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,160
-The sun shines here as well.
-Could you water my plants?

103
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,880
-Sure, I can do that.
-Morning and evenenings?

104
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,560
Cool.

105
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,520
Here's my carkeys. Use the
car as much as you want.

106
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,400
Give them water so they can grow!

107
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,720
Excuse me!

108
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,960
Hello!

109
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,480
Excuse me!

110
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,480
A beer please!

111
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,120
-Excuse me, but is that a sun?
-What?

112
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,320
-Is it a sun on your amulet?
-No, it's a moon.

113
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,520
Excuse me! Could I get a....

114
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,200
The next song is a love song.

115
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,840
About love that defies all boundaries.

116
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,960
Hey, do you know of any cheap
places to spend the night?

117
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,840
I'm from Berlin. 
I'm not familiar with this place.

118
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,360
No? Ok.

119
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,640
Excuse me, wait just a moment.

120
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,880
I was a little far-off, -

121
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,880
but I just remembered...

122
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,440
that it is a cheap youth shelter nearby.

123
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,120
If you want to, I can show you the way?

124
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,080
-If it isn't to much trouble for you?
-Oh, no, I've got a car.

125
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,960
-That is kind of you.
-My car is just over there.

126
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,240
-I'm Daniel.
-Melek.

127
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,280
-Lovely name. Where is it from?
-Turky.

128
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,160
Are you turkish?

129
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,800
-Do you want me to carry that for you?
-Thank you, it's ok.

130
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
-It's not heavy.
-No, but you've been carrying it all day.

131
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,200
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

132
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
It cant be true!

133
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,560
This is Istanbul. Bosporus.
Europe to the left, Asia to the right.

134
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,160
Some times I stand under the bridge
at night, to look at the water.

135
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,040
When the moon shines at the
water surface, it looks like -

136
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,400
thousands of little fish dancing.
In turkish we say -

137
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,560
"Yakamoz"

138
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,280
I've got a date under the bridge
friday at noon.

139
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,120
Aren't you leaving for somewhere?

140
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,640
-Aren't you leaving for somewhere?
-No, I don't think so.

141
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,520
-But everyone leaves for vacation!
-Yeah, I know, but I want to stay here in Hamburg.

142
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,800
Hamburg can be very nice during 
the summer. Parks, café's -

143
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,600
and resturants and all.
And there's the beach!

144
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,400
-Hamburg have a beach?
-Didn't you know? A real beach.

145
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,040
With sand and water, and shells and stuff.

146
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,360
Do you want to see it?

147
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,400
The bill, please.

148
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,240
Yes, well this is the beach.
Not that many shells, but...

149
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,360
-Do you want a beer?
-Yes, please.

150
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,200
Excuse me, could one of you sell me two beers?

151
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,880
Sure.

152
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,400
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

153
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,320
-Wait! How much do I owe you?
-The best in life is free.

154
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,240
Cheers.

155
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,080
I'm starting to understand
why you don't want to leave.

156
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,440
My sun, my moon, let your rays shine

157
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,000
my sand warm

158
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,160
I touch your skin with my wind

159
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,880
my lips craves yours

160
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,760
your eyes

161
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,560
must never stop looking after me

162
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,160
your lips

163
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,960
must never stop kissing me.

164
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,920
So, your name...Melek,
does it mean something?

165
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,160
Angel.

166
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,560
-You wear the name well.
-Thanks, but you don't know me.

167
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,040
What about that place 
to spend the night?

168
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,560
Do you live here alone?

169
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,800
Yes.

170
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,240
Don't you have a girlfriend?

171
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,440
Nope.

172
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,920
-Do you want some tea?
-Yes, please.

173
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,440
It's so peculiar that we met
each other today, since...

174
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,400
I knew that we were going to meet today.

175
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Maybe I didn't know, but just hoped.

176
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,720
It's like you could decide
your own destiny in one day.

177
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,840
I stood there and waited and
waited, for you, and...

178
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,480
So I didn't believe that you
were going to show up.

179
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,640
Then you stood there.

180
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,240
Melek?

181
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,040
-Thank you for everything.
-The pleasure was all mine.

182
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,760
Good bye, Daniel.

183
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,040
Bullshit!
Come to your senses and stay here!

184
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,080
NO! I hate this fucking city!

185
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,440
Yeah yeah, but where are you going?

186
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,320
Where the wind takes me.

187
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,360
-What do you mean by that?
-I just want to get away!

188
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,280
The first car that stops,
decides my destination.

189
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,280
What if the first car is going to Bayern?

190
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,720
Do you want to stay in Bayern?

191
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,720
So this will be my destiny, I guess.

192
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,360
-I'm going to miss you.
-I'll miss you too.

193
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,720
Hey, July.

194
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,240
Jump in, I'm in a hurry.

195
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,840
-Is this your car?
-No, it belongs to a friend of mine.

196
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,680
Where do you want me to drive you?

197
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,880
Where are you going?

198
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,320
Istanbul

199
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,360
Istanbul?

200
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,320
Why are you going to Istanbul?

201
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
It worked!

202
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,040
What worked?

203
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,840
The lucky ring.

204
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,120
I know it sounds crazy and
illogical, but it worked.

205
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,920
So where is she now?

206
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,280
She flew to Turky on vacation this morning.

207
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,760
Everything I know, is that she'll be 
waiting under the Bosporus bridge, friday at noon.

208
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,400
July, she is so....

209
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,320
-By the way, where are you going?
-What?

210
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,560
I mean,  where are you off to?

211
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,200
-I'm also going to Turky.
-What?

212
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,960
To Istanbul.

213
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,280
It's like this:

214
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,160
Every summer, I stand there
where you picked me up -

215
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,520
to leave on vacation.
I go wherever the wind takes me.

216
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,320
The first person that picks me up,
decides where I'm going. You understand?

217
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,880
-You do this every summer?
-Yes!

218
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,040
I've been in the most odd places.
Italia, Spain...

219
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,360
One guy brought me to Afghanistan.
Quite some place to travel to!

220
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
-Afghanistan?
-Yes!

221
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,760
-Amazing!
-Yeah.

222
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,320
You never know where you end up.
It's like buying a surprise pack.

223
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,000
-I see.
-And this year it'll be Turky. Awesome!

224
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,640
I've never been in Turky.
This will be so cool.

225
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,360
Definitely.

226
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,520
It does so once in a while.

227
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,160
Unbeliveable.

228
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,960
One moment.

229
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,200
We could stay here.

230
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
In Bayern?

231
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,040
The sky is blue everywhere.

232
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,080
Hei! It's a new day tomorrow, or what?

233
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,160
I'm sorry, but we don't have
two single rooms left.

234
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,200
We have only one single room, with
one single bed. Will that be ok?

235
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,160
- It's only one night. Shouldn't, be a problem, or..?
- Of course not.

236
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,720
July, you took the entire blanket.
Could I get a little piece of it?

237
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,080
You don't seem to be able to sleep.

238
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,000
No, it's uncomfortable and hot and...

239
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,760
-Do you know the spoon-position?
-Sure.

240
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,720
I've heard it's one of the most
comfortable sleeping positions.

241
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,640
Is that so?

242
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,400
OK, who will spoon whom?

243
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,480
You'll spoon me.

244
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,680
Mmmm, it is really comfortable.

245
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,880
Really nice.

246
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,360
Fuck.

247
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,040
We'll head south, through Italia
to Bari, and take the ferry boat to -

248
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,680
Greece, and then to Turky.

249
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,200
We can also travel through Austria,
Jugoslavia and Bulgaria, to Turky.

250
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,160
-It's war in Jugoslavia.
-Oh, yeah.

251
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,800
Or through Austria, Hungary,
Romania and Bulgaria.

252
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,600
That's a real detour. Maybe there's a ferry 
boat leaving directly from Bari to Turky.

253
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
-I have a problem.
-What is it?

254
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,040
I have very little money.
I can't afford the ferry boat.

255
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,800
That is not my problem.

256
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,920
What do you mean?

257
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,280
What's the matter, don't you
know where you are going?

258
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,120
-Sure we do! Istanbul.
-I'm going to Budapest. Get in!

259
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,080
Now? Are you coming?

260
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,920
-I'm Leo.
-Daniel, pleasure to meet you.

261
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,640
I'm July, like the month.

262
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,640
-July is a beautiful name.
-Thanks. Leo ain't to bad either.

263
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,640
Reminds me in some way of a lion.

264
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,240
I think it has originated from that.

265
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,000
-Are you born in the sign of the lion as well?
-No, unfortunately. I'm a scorpion.

266
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,400
I've got a sting on my tale...

267
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,280
-But you are lion right?
-Yes.

268
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,160
-A july-lion?
-Of course.

269
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,640
-What about your boyfriend?
-He's not my boyfriend...

270
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,000
What is that for?

271
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,560
-That is "Che".
-Yeah, but what does that mean to you?

272
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,000
-What does "Che" fights for?
-For justice.

273
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,880
Yes, but what else?

274
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,320
-For freedom?
-Bingo.

275
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,400
-This "Che" represent my belief 
in the individual freedom.

276
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,080
Then we have something in common.

277
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,440
-What is it?
-I'll wait outside.

278
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,160
-Don't you want a beer?
-No thanks.

279
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,800
-Don't be a partybreak.
-I'm not!

280
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,120
-I'm going in.
-Good. I'll wait here.

281
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,920
Hey, Leo!

282
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,200
-Ok, this is July.
-Hey, July.

283
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,600
-To beers. You want a large one?
-Sure, I'll keep up.

284
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,760
Were you serious about your belief 
in individual freedom?

285
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,080
-That we have it in common?
-Of course I was serious.

286
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,560
-Really?
-Yes.

287
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,520
-Do you want to come with me?
-What?

288
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,840
I mean, do you want to come along?

289
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,400
Where?

290
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,720
To the end of the world, perhaps?

291
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,360
I can't.

292
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,120
Do you think he's the right guy?

293
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,360
Yeah.

294
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,560
Would he fight for you?

295
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,120
I'd wish he would.

296
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,840
Let's dance.

297
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,080
Dance?

298
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,280
Leo, stop it!

299
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,400
What are you doing? Stop it. Leo!

300
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,680
-Leo, stop it!
-Shut up, Paul!

301
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,320
Leave her alone!

302
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,720
-Mind your own business!
-Stop it, or get lost.

303
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,960
-Shut your mouth and sit down.
-Let me go!

304
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,240
-Let her go!
-Daniel! DANIEL!

305
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,520
-Please let her go.
-Didn't get ya?

306
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,280
-I said let her go, please.
-I can't understand.

307
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Let her go!

308
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,160
Hey, come on. Let's get out of here.

309
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,320
Damn, I've never been in a fight
before. I never fight!

310
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,520
My glasses are gone.

311
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm a pacifist. I hate violence.

312
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
What's so funny about that?

313
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,760
-Nothing.
-How should we get away?

314
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,680
-With boat.
-With boat?

315
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,800
Yes, with boat.

316
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,480
Donau runs straight out in 
The Black Sea, don't it?

317
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,440
True. And Istanbul lies by 
The Black Sea.

318
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,960
-That's drugs right?
-No it's not!

319
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,360
-It's a piece.
-What do you mean? It's illegal.

320
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,640
That is a long story.

321
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,360
Maybe, but that stuff makes you stupid.

322
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,400
-Do you think im stupid?
-No, I don't, but...

323
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,000
It's cool, man.

324
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Trust me.

325
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,400
Do you inhale just like a sigarett?

326
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,920
It tastes good.

327
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,680
It tastes really good.

328
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,400
Like ropes.

329
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,200
Like a ribbon.
It tastes a little like that.

330
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,360
It feels so hot...here.

331
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,720
-Ok?
-I'm ok.

332
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,560
-You have little ashe on you.
-Ashe, ashe, ashe.

333
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,880
Another drag?

334
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,240
You've gotten the taste for it now, huh?

335
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,640
I once saw a few guys...
My students at school...

336
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,360
They held it in a special way...
Like this, I think.

337
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,680
-In school?
-In school. Fifteen!

338
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,280
-Amazing.
-They are idiots.

339
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,480
Everything they can do, I can do better.

340
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,960
Cool.

341
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,840
Why do you laugh?

342
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,280
Nothing. They way you say
"cool" is so sweet.

343
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,960
My students keep telling me that.

344
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,360
I was wondering what kind of
music teachers listen to.

345
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,400
What I listen to, you mean?

346
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,880
-Jazz.
-Jazz?

347
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,240
-Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.
-What do you listen to then?

348
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,280
I like the good oldies. Elvis Presley.

349
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,320
What about you?
Do you like oldies?

350
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,800
Sometimes. I must, -

351
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,040
- because every sunday I eat
breakfast at my moms house, -

352
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,800
- and she listens to oldies all day long.

353
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,160
Oldies with coffé, müsli and peanutbutter, 
oldies with everything, -

354
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,000
- for an example...

355
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,160
Blue Moon...

356
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,080
Do you know it?
Nice, or what?

357
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,880
What are you going to do when you find her?

358
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,280
What do you mean?

359
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,520
What are you going to tell her?

360
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
I have no idea.

361
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,280
You don't know?

362
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,440
What should I tell her?

363
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,600
Something like...

364
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,640
My love, -

365
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,200
- I've travelled thousands of miles,
crossed rivers, and moved mountains.

366
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,320
I've suffered and endured torment.

367
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,960
I've resisted temptations,
and I have followed the sun, -

368
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,600
- so that I could stand in front
of you and tell you that, -

369
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,040
- that I love you.

370
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,920
Isn't that a little to excessive?

371
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,800
July?

372
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,640
I'm going to get us something to eat.

373
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,320
I'll be right back.

374
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,160
We have a stowaway on board!

375
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,880
Not so loud, my dear.

376
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,920
Please no, please no.

377
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,760
Budapest?

378
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,040
Do you speak german?

379
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,320
No?

380
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,240
-Do speak english?
-No.

381
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,080
My name is Daniel.

382
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,120
That's my name.

383
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,760
What's your name?

384
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
-Luna.
-Luna...

385
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,640
Like the moon.

386
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,480
Smoke?

387
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,720
Thanks.

388
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,920
Sorry, do you know a place where
we could get something to eat?

389
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,960
Something to eat.

390
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,720
It's a nice place.

391
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:59,400
Could I order something to drink please.
Like a cola, and just anything to eat.

392
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,720
-Do you speak german?
-No.

393
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,440
Well, just anything to eat.
I don't care. Bread or...

394
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,760
We have on simple princible here.
We've got one meny. Eat, or not to eat.

395
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,920
-I'll definitely eat!
-Fish

396
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,520
Fish, fish is great. Wonderful!

397
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,040
-It was very good.
-Yes, time to pay.

398
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,240
How much?

399
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,920
Ten.

400
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,600
Ten?

401
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,440
-Mark.
-German mark?

402
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,840
German, German, German.

403
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,160
Thanks.

404
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,520
So thank you for everything,
but I think I have to go now.

405
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,320
Yes, you see I have a problem.

406
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,040
I have to follow someone.

407
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,840
-It's a girl.
-One more cola? Please?

408
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,760
So you do speak german.

409
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,360
Budapest?

410
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,360
-So we meet again. Give me my money!
-What's he doing?

411
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,160
-Where's my things?
-Who is this?

412
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,440
-I don't know.
-Give me my passport!

413
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,520
-The ring!
-Mind your own business.

414
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,400
Just wait, I'll get you!

415
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,840
Now I should get a hold of you.

416
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,360
Fuck! Why doesn't this shit work?

417
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,320
Hey, you! Give me a push!

418
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,080
Oh, God, oh God.

419
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,440
You're mad!

420
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,800
To the right!

421
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,120
This isn't true!
She's crazy!

422
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,080
I'm gonna redecorate your face!

423
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,440
I'll get you!

424
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,520
Just wait, you asshole!

425
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,880
-I can't hear you!
-Just wait until I can get my hands on you.

426
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,040
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

427
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,160
You assholes!

428
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,760
Uops!

429
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,000
Where are you from?

430
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,200
Passport?

431
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,080
Passport?

432
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,160
Border: Hungary - Romania

433
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,160
Hello.

434
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,320
Passport?

435
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,800
That is exactly my problem.
I don't have any passport.

436
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,480
No passport, no Romania.

437
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:28,120
Sure, that is obvious. You have to
have a passport to cross the borders.

438
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,600
But I just don't have it.
Please.

439
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,040
No passport, no Romania.

440
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,320
Yeah, I understood you, but
perhaps you didn't understand me.

441
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,560
I really have a big problem,
and I need to go over this border.

442
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,920
I need to go to Romania to meet someone.
It's very, very...

443
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,200
No passport, no Romania.

444
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,640
-Damn.
-Yes, damn.

445
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,120
Daniel!

446
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,400
July!

447
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:45,040
-Stop!
-I didn't do anything.

448
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,920
I have a big problem!
No pass, nothing, -

449
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,120
- and I must cross. Help me.
- Where is your passport?

450
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,400
Doesn't matter.
Say anything.

451
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:59,280
Tell them we're married, ok?

452
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,480
This is no problem.
She's my wife.

453
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,640
-The ring... we are married. If she...
-But we aren't married!

454
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,880
-July, please!
-No, we can't lie to him.

455
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,200
Please.

456
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,840
Ok.

457
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,320
Daniel Bannier, do you take me
as your lawful wedded wife?

458
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,960
-What?
-Do you, or do you not?

459
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:25,040
-Yes, I do...
-Then ask me.

460
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,000
July, do you take me as your
lawful wedded husbond?

461
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,480
-Yes, I do.
-Ok, good.

462
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,400
What else?

463
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,240
-The speech first.
-Which speech?

464
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,600
-The one I taught you.
-Now?

465
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,560
It's a part of the ceremony.

466
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,960
Ok, so...

467
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,840
"My love..."
That's correct, right?

468
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,440
"I've crossed bridges..."
Wrong, huh?

469
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,000
-"I..I've crossed..."
-You don't remember it.

470
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,840
-No, but I will learn it.
-Promise?

471
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,080
I promise you.

472
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,000
Yes, we are married.

473
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,800
Kiss.

474
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,760
I'll go get the car...

475
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:47,000
When you get married in Romania,
you usually give presents.

476
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,520
Presents?

477
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,000
Bus, my present.

478
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,600
Ok.

479
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,040
Raise the bar.

480
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,280
Thank you.

481
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,120
How to we get further?

482
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,840
We could have our honeymoon here.

483
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,600
-I think that I have a better suggestion.
-What?

484
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,800
We steal a car.

485
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,320
-What?
-Yeah, we steal a car.

486
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:43,080
-We can't steal a car.
-Why not?
-We're nice people. They don't steal cars.

487
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,640
We could steal the car from a bad guy.

488
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,080
-Him? Is he a bad guy?
-Nope.

489
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,160
-He's a nice guy.
-Obviously.

490
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,120
But it's exactly those guys
that beat their wife and kids.

491
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,640
-I don't know.
-They!

492
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,040
He reminds me of a friend of mine.

493
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,640
Him. A serial-killer!

494
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,640
-He looks nice to me.
-I get anxiety, just looking at him.

495
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,720
Everyone look like bad guys to me.

496
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,440
You know what you're doing right?

497
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,440
Can you handle it?

498
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,680
-What are you doing?
-It just layed in the car.

499
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,480
Hurry, got damnit.

500
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,960
Hey! Are you crazy?
You're destroying everything!

501
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,400
Trust me, ok?

502
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,360
-Did you hurt yourself?
-No, I'm fine.

503
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,360
Oh damn! Julie!
Don't movie, I think somone is looking.

504
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,240
Fuck, he's looking this way...

505
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,280
Act normal.

506
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,760
-Isn't this romantic.
-What?

507
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,920
I've never stolen a car with someone before.

508
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:34,240
Get a move on this car, so
we'll get away from here. Please!

509
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,400
-Well, what did I tell you?
-Amazing!

510
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,000
You're the best.

511
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,600
Tell me, Alin.
Don't you've got a blue Dacia?

512
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,600
That's right.

513
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,360
I think it's getting stolen.

514
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,280
Bullshit!

515
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,200
Fuck, they are stealing my car!

516
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,120
"No passport, no Bulgaria."
I've had it with that.

517
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:03,840
How do you think the Turkish border is?
Probably five times as worse!

518
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,320
Wait a moment, could you back up a little?

519
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,640
-Where does this lead?
-We'll soon find out.

520
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,840
-Look at that.
-This place looks dead.

521
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,360
-That's not what I ment.
-What do you mean?

522
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,360
-That must be Bulgaria.
-Bullshit.

523
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,840
-Why is it bullshit?
-This puddle ain't the Donau.

524
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,240
I'm sorry, but Donau isn't the border.

525
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,560
-Yes, it is!
-Are you sure?

526
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,640
-No.
-Then this could be the border.

527
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,160
Ok, let's assume that this is 
the border. So what?

528
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,920
I'll just drive across.

529
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,760
-How do you plan to accomplish that?
-I'll accellerate from a distance, hit the ramp -

530
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,400
- and jump across the river.

531
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,680
-That's crazy!
-We need the car.

532
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,080
-We can manage without it.
-It's wednesday, and we're still not in Bulgaria.

533
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,920
I need the car to be in Istanbul friday at noon.

534
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,240
That won't work if you die.
Have you thought about that?

535
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,240
Sensible teachers don't do this stuff!

536
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,840
Ok, so...

537
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,360
The car is the weight, x.

538
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:37,360
X weighs 500 kilo.
The distance is 25 metres.

539
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,680
The question is: How fast 
must we drive up a ramp -

540
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,440
- with a ten grade incline
to cross 25 metres?

541
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:50,080
The answer is...

542
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:57,120
96,41 km/h.

543
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,680
Daniel!

544
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,720
Fuck!

545
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,200
Excellent! Congratulations! 
I really pitty your students.

546
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,080
-You could have been killed!
-What if I'd been?

547
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,600
-That's nothing to joke about.
-Why not?

548
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,080
Because I don't like it.

549
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,240
What would you do if I'd been killed?

550
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,520
Probably been happy to finally 
gotten rid of you.

551
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,920
What is this?

552
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,360
The border river.

553
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,840
Donau.

554
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,080
What is so funny?
Really funny, huh?

555
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,320
Really amuzing.

556
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,120
Just hilarious.

557
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,240
-Take it easy.
-No! It's all your fault!

558
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,280
-My fault?
-Yeah, your fault!

559
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,280
-Why?
-All this shit is your fault!

560
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,800
If I had taken the ferry boat from Bari,
I'd been in Istanbul by now, not here.

561
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,680
Bari!

562
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,960
Without me, you'd still been in Bayern!

563
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,720
Who helped you across the border?
Who stole the car?

564
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,160
And who sold me this stupid ring?

565
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:26,840
Without this piece of junk,
I'd still been in Hamburg, and not here!

566
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,120
So head back to Elben.

567
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,560
Read a newspaper or a book!
Go back to your empty and booring life!

568
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,920
You just don't want me to meet her!

569
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:37,120
The first one who stops decides my destination.

570
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,520
He didn't count.

571
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,280
July?

572
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,280
July?

573
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,560
And that was it?

574
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,960
That was it.

575
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:16,640
One moment!
Did you really experience all that?

576
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,960
I've experienced all that.

577
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,560
-You didn't make it up?
-Why should I make it up?

578
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,120
-Respect, man.
-Thanks.

579
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,840
Where does that awful smell come from?

580
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,720
You still don't got your papers, do you?

581
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:45,160
-No...
-Out! Get out of the car!

582
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,480
-What is that bullshit?
-Daniel, get out of the car!

583
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,960
-What type of bullshit is this?
-You heard me!

584
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,000
-What piece of crap is this?

585
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,840
Out! Both of you!

586
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,080
Come on now!

587
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,200
-He have to go out also.
-Out.

588
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,400
-What?
-I told him to get out.

589
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,760
-I had just told him that.
-He's german.

590
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,080
German, german.

591
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,680
Passport, and registration card.

592
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,920
-Passport!
-I don't have a passport!

593
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:29,960
-His passport were stolen.
-Tell that to your grandma.

594
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,360
-What is the problem?
-Shut up!

595
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,720
What?

596
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,120
-I told him to shut up!
-Shut up!

597
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,880
-I haven't said a word!
-Shut up!

598
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:44,080
-You're not going anywhere without passport.
-His passport really was stolen.

599
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:49,240
What are you? Terrorists, satanists, or what?

600
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,080
-Open your luggage compartment!
-Isa, what...

601
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,000
Open it!

602
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,200
Arrest them immideately!

603
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,600
This is unbeliveable. 
Totally unbeliveable.

604
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,960
Now we're doomed!
Forever! And why?

605
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,880
Because I hitchhiked with a guy that 
had a corpse in the luggage compartment.

606
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,880
Just imagine! A corpse!
Is it your hobby or something?

607
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,000
-Shut up!
-I won't shut it.

608
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,880
-Don't make me angry!
-Or what? Your pants will blow?

609
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,240
Listen, you dickhead!

610
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,280
Not more than 20 words from you,
from here to Istanbul, ok?

611
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,360
Yeah ok, you can get them right now:
Asshole, asshole, asshole...

612
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,840
The corpse in the car is my uncle Achmed.

613
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,560
What?

614
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,920
He came from Istanbul to visit us.

615
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,400
Uncle Achmed is my fathers eldest brother.

616
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,800
And my father often invited him to Germany.

617
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,120
Five months ago, he finally came.

618
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,480
He got a visum for three months,
and tricked his way to Germany.

619
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:20,240
He thought Berlin was pretty awesome.
Lots of turkish people in our neighborhod.

620
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:25,160
At once, he participated in everything,
and really had a great time.

621
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:30,840
And we, my family and I,
had a great time as well.

622
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:36,760
My nephews...I've got two nephews, 
the boys of my sister.

623
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,960
They dropped out of kindergarten, -

624
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:44,760
- because when no one else was there,
uncle Achmed looked after them.

625
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,520
You wouldn't believe how 
good he was at cooking!

626
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,200
Better than my mother!

627
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,880
Three months passed, and
uncle Achmed stayed.

628
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,920
Then the unavoidable happened.

629
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,560
He died.

630
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:15,000
Without even saying goodbye.
Heart attack. Dead.

631
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,360
Really stupid.

632
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:23,040
The whole family gathered and
held a crise meeting.

633
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:29,360
This had to be kept a secret when my 
parents kept an illegal corpse in the basement.

634
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:34,360
So we decided to smuggle the 
corpse back to Turky.

635
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,600
Since I'm the youngest,
and on vacaion, -

636
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,240
I was stuck with this shit.

637
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,920
Shit!

638
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,640
They are going to ask for his birth certificate.

639
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:51,440
-You can get it sent here by fax.
-No, they want to see the original.

640
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,680
If I just could have one phone call.

641
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:01,640
Then I would call my girlfriend.
She could bring the birth certificate.

642
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:07,200
Isa, my time is running out.

643
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,320
Come on.

644
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,920
Wait! What about me?

645
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:30,920
-Who was that?
-We'll soon find out. Come on.

646
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,200
The door is open.

647
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:19,120
So you came all the way here just to
bring your dead uncle to Turky?

648
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,760
Brave, Isa! Bravo!

649
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,600
Osman, give the hero some tea.

650
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,600
-Cigarette?
-Thanks.

651
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,960
I need your uncle's birth certificate.

652
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:05,320
If I could make a phone call,
I could get it brought from Istanbul tonight.

653
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,600
Show Isa the telephone.

654
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:22,880
To all passengers:
We'll take a 30 minutes break.

655
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:26,040
The tea is on us.

656
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,400
July?

657
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,920
Hey! Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

658
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,520
Melek.

659
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,200
This is unbelievable.

660
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:13,880
-I'm heading for Istanbul.
-What are supposed to do there?

661
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:23,480
-That is...a pretty long story.
-Tell me about it. But fast.

662
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,200
I met a girl.

663
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,440
Fell in love.

664
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,520
I'm going to Istanbul to see her.

665
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:55,360
Where in Istanbul are you going to meet her?

666
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,000
Under the bridge.

667
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,800
Are you sure that she'll be there?

668
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,840
I hope so.

669
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:25,080
The bus to Edirne is soon leaving.
Please board the bus immediately.

670
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,360
I have to go.

671
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:32,920
-Aren't you going to Istanbul?
-No, I have to bring something to the border.

672
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,280
What?

673
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,360
That is also a long story.

674
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,200
-Say hello to your boyfriend for me!
-I will.

675
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,840
Did I tell you about my boyfriend?

676
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,080
Don't be late for your bus now!

677
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,240
Hey!

678
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,640
You made it.

679
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,560
Good to see you.

680
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,120
Where is the girl you were meeting?

681
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,000
My love, -

682
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,920
- I've travelled thousands
of miles, -

683
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:42,400
- crossed rivers and
moved mountains -

684
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,320
- I've suffered and endured torment, -

685
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:53,240
- I've resisted temptations, -

686
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:57,440
- and followed the sun,
so I could stand in front of you -

687
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,200
- and tell you -

688
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,800
- that I love you.

689
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,040
We'll do the old game: The first car
that stops, decides our destination.

690
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:43,760
May I say something?
I love you.

691
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,800
-What?
-I love you.

692
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:51,880
-Funny, but I didn't quite hear you...
-I love you.

693
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:55,640
Yes, but I told you that I have 
difficulties understanding you.

694
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,520
-I LOVE YOU!
-That's more like it.

695
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,080
Hey, lovebirds!
Where are you going?

696
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,200
-To the fucking south!
-Ok, get in.

697
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,480
What are you waiting for?
