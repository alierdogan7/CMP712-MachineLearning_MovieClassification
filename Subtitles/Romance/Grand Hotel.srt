I suppose I can cancel the Vienna contract.

501

I just want to be alone.

to breathe the air you breathe.

GERSTENKORN: We did not approach you.

668
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,715
GERSTENKORN: You approached us!
ZINNOWITZ: Wait.

669
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,720
Can you imagine 100 girls
in a ballet school...

670
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,713
each thinking she would become
the most famous dancer in the world?

671
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,118
I was ambitious then.

672
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,795
We were drilled like little soldiers.
No rest, no stopping.

673
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,475
I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.

674
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,916
Then I became famous soon.

675
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,429
But why am I telling you all this?

676
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,629
Last night I didn't know you at all.

677
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,398
- Who are you, really?
- What?

678
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,516
I don't even know your name.

[Baron laughing]

680
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,676
I am Felix Benvenuto Frihern von Geigern.

681
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,391
My mother called me Flix.

682
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,110
No. Flix.

683
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,078
That's sweet.

684
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,636
And how do you live?
What kind of person are you?

685
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,709
I'm a prodigal son,
the black sheep of a white flock.

686
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,039
I shall die on the gallows.

687
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,558
- Really?
- Really.

688
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,638
I haven't a bit of character. None at all.

689
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,358
- No?
- No. Really.

690
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,871
You know, when I was a little boy
I was taught to ride and be a gentleman.

691
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,670
Then at school, to pray and lie.

692
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,352
And then in the war, to kill and hide.

693
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,159
That's all.

694
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,311
And what do you do now?

695
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,110
Now I’m a gambler...

696
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,394
running at large, like a happy pig...

697
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,518
devouring everything of life
that pleases me.

698
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,117
I really belong in jail.

699
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,479
What a picture.

700
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,551
And what else?

701
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,314
What else?

702
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,110
BARON: I'm also a criminal
and a hotel thief.

703
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,197
That's not a funny joke.

704
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,236
You must believe one thing.

705
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,996
You must believe that I love you.

706
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,075
<i>That I’ve never known love like this</i>
<i>until now.</i>

707
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,072
What is it, Flix? What's the matter?

708
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,559
Hotel thief.

709
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,869
No.

710
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,029
Did you come here just for these?

711
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,393
That's horrible.

712
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,759
You may keep the pearls.
I don't want them.

713
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,591
I will not denounce you.

714
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,471
Hadn't you better go now?

715
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,351
I wanted money desperately.

716
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,477
Can't you understand that?
That's why I wanted your pearls.

717
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,675
I was threatened.

718
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,036
I was desperately in need
of a certain big sum of money.

719
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,919
I've been following you. I've admired you.

720
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,079
But last night, at last,
I managed to come into your room.

721
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,914
And now...

722
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,914
And now?

723
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,510
I couldn't go through with it.

724
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,318
Don't you understand?

725
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,314

Hello, Pimenov. Good morning.

734
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,393
Darling.

735
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,073
Beautiful morning. Yes, very well.

736
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,117
Rehearsals? All right,
you can come. Goodbye.

737
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,395
I have to go to rehearsals.
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning.

738
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,516
- Our train?
- Yes, for Vienna.

739
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,795
- Vienna?
- You're coming with me.

740
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,030
- Of course you are.
- But I can't.

741
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,634
I'd give my soul to go, but I can't.

742
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,395
GRUSINSKAYA: Why couldn't you?
BARON: I'll try. There might be some way.

743
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,430
GRUSINSKAYA: Flix, is it money?
BARON: Of course.

744
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,477
I have money.
I have enough for both of us.

745
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,471
No. That would spoil everything.

746
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,872
I'll manage somehow. I'll get it.
I have a whole day. I'll be on the train.

747
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,308
I shall dance, and you'll be with me.

748
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,912
Then we'll go to Tremezzo.
I have a villa there.

749
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,758
The sun will shine.

750
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,556
I'll take a vacation,
six weeks, eight weeks. I don't know.

751
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,551
We'll be happy and lazy.

752
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,309
And then we'll go to South America.
It will be divine.

- I'll be on the train with the money.

PREYSING: Next week.
GERSTENKORN: Come on.

836
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,472
Good night, Preysing. You're a sly one.

837
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,239
ZINNOWITZ: Dr. Waitz?
WAITZ: Yes.

838
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,718
ZINNOWITZ: I'll be at your office tomorrow.

839
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,352
You let me talk myself hoarse...

840
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,159
and you had Manchester
signed up all the time. Why?

841
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,829
- The deal has been put through.
- Yeah.

842
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,310
The deal has been put through.

843
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,269
- What's the matter with you?
- Here.

844
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,557
"Deal with Manchester definitely...

845
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,955
"definitely off." Preysing!

846
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,838
Yes, if that's what the world wants, bluff...

847
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,191
I can be just as big a bluff as anyone.

848
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,477
You must go to England yourself at once
and really see this through!

849
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,710
Yes, I must go to England.
I was desperate.

850
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,951
I didn't know what I was doing.
Now I don't care.

851
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,873
This thing goes to a man's head.

852
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,313
ZINNOWITZ: You need some relaxation.
PREYSING: Yeah!

853
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,557
That's it! I want to break loose.

854
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,235
I want to drink.
I want to maybe go dancing.

855
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,548
I want to do anything.

856
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,596
I can understand that, after this...

857
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,478
Yes, go on, say it. My lie.

858
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,836
But that's the first time in 30 years that...

859
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,039
Where is my stenographer? Miss Flaemm?

860
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,111
ZINNOWITZ: Why do you want her?
PREYSING: Pardon?

861
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,634
ZINNOWITZ: What do you want?
PREYSING: What?

862
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,040
Here. I want to do some dictating.

863
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,270
I want to tell my father-in-law about...

864
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,669
She had an engagement
in the Yellow Room at 5:00.

865
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,079
She was in a hurry.

866
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,798
- In the Yellow Room?
- Yes.

867
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,196
Do you think that she's pretty?

868
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,599
- Pretty as a picture.
- You think so?

869
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,875
Let's go find her. We'll go get a drink.

870
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,076
- You come along, Zinnowitz.
- Yes.

871
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,991
I don't know much about women.

872
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,709
I've been married for 28 years, you know.
Come along, Zinnowitz.

873
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,552
- Good evening, Mr. Kringelein.
- Good evening, Miss Flaemm.

874
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,995
- Have you seen the Baron?
- I'm waiting for him.

875
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,913
I've been with him all day.
We had a marvelous time.

876
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,834
We were in a motor car,
100 miles an hour, in an airplane.

877
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,990
- Really?
- We had a marvelous time.

01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,114
My, how you've changed.
You look awfully nice.

880
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,078
Thank you, Miss Flaemm.
I had a manicure, too.

881
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,434
Really?

882
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,312
I'm sorry, Miss Flaemm.
Would you have something to drink?

883
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,995
A Louisiana Flip. Louisiana Flip, please.

884
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,594
- Absinthe.
- Oh, that.

[Otto whistling]

886
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,555
- You like music, Mr. Kringelein?
- Yes. I love it.

887
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,437
It's so stimulating.

888
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,476
- A man could...
- A man could what?

889
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:55,190
- He could do almost anything.
- He could.

890
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,111
- Hello, funny one.
- Hello.

891
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,953
BARON: Sorry I’m late.
OTTO: Baron, won't you have a drink?

892
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:04,636
OTTO: A Louisiana Flip.
BARON: Mr. Kringelein, how are you now?

893
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,870
OTTO: I feel a little strange, Baron.

894
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,155
- I'd given you up.
- Sorry.

895
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,710
OTTO: Please, Baron, do have a drink.
A Louisiana Flip.

896
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,236
No, thanks, old man.
I'm keeping my head clear.

897
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,793
- Dance, then?
- What?

898
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,348
- Dance?
- Yes, I’d love to.

899
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:25,997
- Watch this, will you, Mr. Kringelein?
- I really ought to learn to dance.

900
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,398
I suppose it's very important.

901
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,472
Yes, you should learn
as quickly as the time allows.

902
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,276
Believe me, Mr. Kringelein,
a man who is not with a woman...

903
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,914
is a dead man.

904
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,356
- What have you been doing all day?
- Chasing around.

905
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,400
- Chasing what?
- Money.

- You were very different yesterday.
- That was yesterday.

908
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,113
I served as a surgeon in the Great War...

909
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,313
till the end.

I carried diphtheria bacilli

913

- Drink, Mr. Kringelein.
- Yes.

914
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,799
That was lovely.

do you want to make a man happy?

BARON: Dance with old Kringelein.

Why?

You know, you're not a bit
like you were yesterday.

Yesterday?

922
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,997
No, perhaps not.

923
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,916
I fell in love last night.

924
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,999
The real thing.

925
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,989
There's no real thing. It just doesn't exist.

926
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,509
I thought that, too.

927
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,870
But now I know that it does.

928
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,752
It's wonderful.

929
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,313

- Of course. Anything for you.

Here you are. I must speak with you.

933

- Presently, Mr. Preysing.
- No, now. This is very urgent.

at the moment.

Mr. Kringelein?

- Come along and try it.
- I'd be afraid.

Mr. Kringelein, Mr. Preysing.

951
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,833
Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend
and not accept your invitation to dance.

952
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,871
I couldn't think of not accepting
the invitation to dance.

953
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,950
I understood you to say
that you reported to our plant ill...

954

and you're here in Berlin
indulging in diversions...

01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,036
- Go away, please. You are annoying.
- You don't like to see me enjoying myself.

1001
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,556
When a man's working himself to death,
that's what he's paid for.

1002
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,473
You don't care if a man
can live on his wages or not.

1003
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,599
You have a very regular scale of wages,
and there's the sick fund for you.

1004
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,399
OTTO: What a scale, and what a fund.

1005
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,357
When I was sick for four weeks...

1006
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,749
you wrote me a letter
telling me I’d be discharged...

1007
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,637
if I were sick any longer.

1008
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,517
Did you write me that letter or not?

1009
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,478
I have no idea of the letters that I write.

1010
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,552
I know that you are here
in the Grand Hotel, living like a lord.

1011
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,154
You are probably an embezzler.

1012
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,151
- An embezzler!
- Yes, an embezzler.

1013
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,515
You are going to take that back!

1014
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,955
Right here in the presence
of this young lady!

1015
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,918
Who do you think you're talking to?
You think I’m dirt?

1016
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,713
If I’m dirt, you're a lot dirtier...

1017
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,394
Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing!

1018
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,119
PREYSING: You're discharged.
FLAEMM: You can't do that.

1019
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,033
I don't know the man or what he wants.
I never saw him before.

1020
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,348
I know you.

1021
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,034
I've kept your books for you,
and I know all about you.

1022
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,079
If one of your employees
was half as stupid in a small way...

1023
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,879
OTTO: As you are in a big way...
PREYSING: What do you mean?

1024
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,474
MAN #1: Gentlemen, please! Please!

1025
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,959
MAN #2: Stop that!

1026
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,230
PREYSING: You're discharged! You hear?
OTTO: Wait!

1027
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:24,238
You can't discharge me.
I'm my own master...

1028
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,675
for the first time in my life.

1029
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,630
You can't discharge me. I'm sick.

1030
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,793
I'm going to die. You understand?

1031
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,312
I'm going to die, and nobody
can do anything to me anymore.

1032
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,073
Nothing can happen to me anymore.

1033
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:46,110
Before I can be discharged, I’ll be dead!

1034
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,037
The man's crazy.
I don't know him. He's annoying.

1035
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,435
- Baron!
- Excuse me.

1036
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,348
BARON: What is it? What's happened?
FLAEMM: He's ill.

1037
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:03,150
- I'm sorry, Baron.
- Poor old Kringelein. You're all right.

1038
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,073
- Give him some whiskey.
- No.

1039
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,189
A Louisiana Flip.

1040
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:20,559
SENF: Five minutes to 7:00.
Time drags when you're tired.

1041
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,994
I was in the hospital the whole night,
walking up and down the corridor.

1042
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,436
They wouldn't let me see her.
And I have to stay chained to this desk.

1043
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,636
PORTER: Did you find that lady
for Mr. Preysing?

1044
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,280
BELLBOY: Yes, they're over there.
PORTER: That's all.

1045
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,789
His secretary.

1046
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,470
Come on, waiter.

1047
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,392
[Soft instrumental music]

1048
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,948
- Would you like a little cognac?
- No, nothing.

1049
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:44,950
PREYSING: Nothing?

1050
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,315
PREYSING: One cognac for me.
WAITER: Very good, sir.

1051
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,671
You wanted to see me?

1052
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,115
Yes. Pardon me. I must go to England.

1053
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,510
It's very important. I must go at once.
I have some very big deals...

1054
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,398
involving hundreds of thousands
of marks...

1055
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,793
and I thought
I would take along a secretary...

1056
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,269
to take care of my correspondence.

1057
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,998
You know what I mean.

1058
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,072
I understood you to say
that you travelled and...

1059
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,638
<i>You understand?</i>

1060
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,869
I understand you perfectly, Mr. Preysing.

1061
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,878
PREYSING: What would you want
for such a trip?

1062
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,554
FLAEMM: Marks? You mean money?
PREYSING: Yes.

1063
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,476
I don't know. I'd have to figure it up.

1064
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,869
I'd need clothes and shoes...

1065
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,719
and it's cold in England in March.
And I’d need a suit.

1066
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,270
- You'd want me to look nice?
- Of course, Miss Flaemm.

1067
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,669
Yes, I thought you would.

1068
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,197
I should say 1,000 marks.

1069
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,279
FLAEMM: Is that too much?
PREYSING: No.

1070
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,392
That is all right.

1071
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,076
Would you like me
to get you a room here...

1072
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,350
at the hotel? Now?

1073
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,510
PREYSING: And that would...
FLAEMM: Hello, Baron.

1074
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,876
- Would you please pay some attention?
- I'm paying attention.

1075
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,994
BARON: How do you do?
PREYSING: Insolence.

1076
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,354
You mean the Baron?

1077
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,876
PREYSING: Baron what?
BARON: What?

1078
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,072
He's a gentleman.

1079
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,510
Is the Baron tired?

1080
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,358
No, not tired exactly.

1081
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,318
I thought this evening
we could go to the casino.

1082
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,551
That place we passed
with the wonderful bright lights.

1083
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,990
Kringelein, I’d adore it.
I can't go anywhere.

1084
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,156
- What?
- I'm broke.

1085
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,910
- No, you're joking.
- Yes. Isn't it odd?

1086
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,996
A baron, broke.

1087
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,758
Excuse me, old man.

1088
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,673
- I quit.
- You can't.

1089
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,751
I'm not getting those pearls,
neither are you.

1090
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,637
- What about the money?
- I'll pay you back.

1091
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,518
- How?
- I have an idea working in my head.

1092
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,750
You might find a bullet through that head.

1093
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,310
If you do that you'll get nothing,
except maybe the police after you.

1094
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,794
MAN: Mme. Grusinskaya's car!

1095
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,873
If you wait, I’ll pay you back your 5,000...

1096
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,432
I’ll see you later.

1097
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,633
Go on, Suzette.

1098
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,788
Are you coming to the theater?
I shall dance tonight. How I shall dance!

1099
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,836
I want to feel that you're there.

1100
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,991
<i>I came too far.</i>

1101
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,118
- I'm worried about you.
- Don't be.

1102
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,758
- You'll be on the train?
- Yes.

1103
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,831
- Until then.
- Bless you.

1104
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,913
- Was the Baron joking?
- What?

1105
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,629
- Is it really true?
- What are you talking about, Kringelein?

1106
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,792
Is the Baron really in financial straits?

1107
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,514
To tell you the truth, I must get
some money somehow right away.

1108
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,831
- If the Baron will permit me.
- What?

1109
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:43,119
I'd be awfully glad to oblige.
You've been very decent to me.

1110
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,315
Three hundred?

1111
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,869
If I could get into a game of some kind,
I think I might win.

1112
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,834
Gambling! I'd love that!

1113
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,390
I've got over 6,800 marks right here.

1114
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,436
If we could scare up some men to play.

1115
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,751
- We could go up to my room.
- That's a grand idea.

1116
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,195
Come on.

1117
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,512
- Cab, miss?
- What?

1118
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,592
- Cab?
- No, thanks. I'll walk.

1119
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,156
BARON: 4,000 marks.
DEALER: 4,000!

1120
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,150
BARON: Too high?

1121
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,113
DEALER: 4,000 marks.

1122
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,838
DEALER: Want a card?
BARON: Please.

1123
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,114
Thanks.

1124
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,480
PLAYER #1: 8,000 marks.
OTTO: 8,000!

1125
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,269
BARON: I take it all.
PLAYER #2: That's a lot of money.

1126
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,272
I need it, thanks.

1127
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,632
DEALER: Want a card?
BARON: Please.

1128
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,353
Baccarat.

1129
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,668
PLAYER #2: Too bad there.

1130
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,751
[Men chattering]

1131
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,593
- Now, Mr. Kringelein.
- Baron!

1132
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,756
Will you help me again, please?

1133
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,035
I think you'd better help me, Kringelein.

1134
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,317
- Make your bets, gentlemen.
- How much shall I bet?

1135
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,678
BARON: How much is left in the bank?
BANKER: 2,500 uncovered.

1136
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,553
- Do you feel like going that far?
- All that money, Baron?

1137
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,189
Come on, you're killing them tonight.
Go ahead, old man.

1138
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,349
Do you want a card?

1139
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,919
What have you got?

1140
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,030
The old highwayman. He has nine again.

1141
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,555
I win again!

1142
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,112
Come on, gentlemen. Please drink! Drink.

1143
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,470
It's wonderful and sweet champagne!

1144
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,348
Mr. Kringelein, care to take the bank?

1145
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,989
Yes! Surely. I'll take everything.
I'll take anything.

1146
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,993
Come on, now. Drink, gentlemen.
Please drink some champagne.

1147
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,911
It's expensive and good.

1148
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,156
What will I take the bank for?

1149
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,073
- I'll play for 500.
- Baron, all at once?

1150
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,434
Suppose you lose it?

1151
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,398
It's all the same thing, Kringelein.
Come on, now, old man.

1152
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,909
Deal me two cards.

1153
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,878
One to me first. One to yourself.

1154
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,037
One to me. One to yourself.

1155
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,349
Baron, if all that money...

1156
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,751
What have you got?

1157
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,594
I've got a nine!

1158
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,238
Isn't that a wonderful thing?

1159
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,154
Kringelein, you old robber,
you're hopeless.

1160
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,911
Baron! Baron, please.

1161
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,080

01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,112
Here, Miss Flaemm.

1326
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,557
Miss Flaemm, please don't leave me.
Please, Miss Flaemm.

MAN: What a grand hotel!

1329
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,233
WOMAN #1: Hurry. They're waiting.
WOMAN #2: She was in a hurry.

1330
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,117
No wonder she was running.

1331
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,428
Mr. Kringelein!

1332
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,709
Wake up!

1333
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,871
Hear me? Wake up!

1334
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,076
- The Baron.
- The Baron?

1335
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,436
Go quickly. The Baron. Do you hear me?

1336
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,190
- Where?
- Preysing's room.

1337
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,873
Hurry!

1338

[Sobbing]

1339
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,068
Here. Take it. You thief, you.

1340
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,273
I must get out of here.

1341
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:48,478
Mr. Kringelein, he robbed me.
He struck me. He's dead.

1342
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:56,315
Baron. Dead, just like that.

1343
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,037
Look. His eyes are still open.

1344
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,716
He looks so peaceful.

1345
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,075
It can't be so hard to die.

1346
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,273
That pocketbook he stole from me.

1347
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,591
It's just like it was.
I haven't touched nothing.

1348
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,833
Maybe he did try to take
your pocketbook...

1349
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,911
but you don't kill a man for that.

1350
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,469
You don't kill a man about a pocketbook.

1351
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:32,438
Poor Baron, he wanted money so badly.

1352
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,832
- Where is Miss Flaemm?
- I'll take care of her.

1353
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,992
That's it. She's working with that man.

1354
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:44,158
She enticed me into her room
while he robbed me here.

1355
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,038
- I'll tell that to the court.
- To the court?

1356
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,030
Yes.

1357
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,713
Mr. Kringelein, I must talk with you
before the police come.

1358
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,351
Miss Flaemm is in your room?

1359
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,432
- Yes.
- She's in your room.

1360
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,432
No one will know that I was with her.

1361
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,352
You were with her.

1362
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,471
They will not interrogate you.
They will not ask you any questions.

1363
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:11,235
You cannot give no testimony.
Neither can she say anything.

1364
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,750
But what you are proposing
is falsification of the evidence.

1365
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,593
My existence is hanging by a thread.

1366
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,439
A scandal with that woman
would mean ruin for me.

1367
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,718
- But you've just killed a man!
- That makes no difference!

1368
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:29,918
I beg your pardon.
It makes all the difference in the world.

1369
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,919
OTTO: We're going to call the police.
PREYSING: No!

1370

Please, Mr. Kringelein.

1371
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,757
I will give you money, anything.
You can go away. Please.

1372
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:42,391
- I have enough money.
- Mr. Kringelein, please help me.

1373
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,479
- My life is in your hands.
- Your life.

1374
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,277
What about my life,
when you had it in your hands?

1375
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,749
But I can send you back to Friedersdorf.

1376
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:55,673
I can give you a very good position
in Friedersdorf.

1377

Many, many thanks,
Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing...

1378

- but I am never going back to Friedersdorf.
- Don't, please.

1379
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,033
Worry about yourself.
Don't worry about me.

It was never so quiet in the Grand Hotel.

01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,070
- They don't kill a man for that.
- He was desperate.

1474

He was?

1475
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:12,277
He tried to raise money all day.

1476
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:15,193
And he laughed, poor devil.

1477
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,037
And a man like Preysing has to kill him.

1478
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,429
You know, I didn't like Preysing right off.

01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,949
Why did you have anything
to do with him?

1480

- Money.
- Money.

- Yes, I do.

- Do you really?
- Yes, I do.

1483
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:43,399
I could take care of you,
Miss Flaemmchen, if you'd let me.

1484
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,232
I have enough money.

1486

<i>and there's 3,400 that I won last night.</i>

1487
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:57,872
That would last a long time.
I could win some more. We could travel.
