Well, l've never felt this way

Please not me.
Please not me.

36
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:14,788
Like l said, it's management.

37
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:16,886
They make these decisions.

38
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:20,457
Please not me. Please not me.

39
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:26,997
Sorry, Lily.

Sorry, it's unlucky.

43
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:45,052
- You can finish up the week.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:02,939
<i>The shark is often a solitary
animal. It's only social contact...</i>

45
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,468
No, no. You've eaten already.

46
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:10,881
Winston's trying
to eat my fish and chips.

47
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:12,885
Cute.

48
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:16,684
<i>...from a considerable distance
by the distressed or wounded.</i>

49
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:23,622
<i>You are apples</i>

50
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:27,758
<i>And I am tangerines</i>

51
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:32,805
<i>We're different fruit
From the same tree...</i>

52
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,504
That sounds really cool.

53
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:48,453
- Here.

54
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:50,922

tried to eat my fish.

55
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:53,425
Thanks, Damon,
l like it a lot.

56
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:59,528
l'm really sorry you lost your job.
They don't know what they're missing.

57
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,698
And if Mum and Dad were alive
they'd say the same thing.

58
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:06,599
Thanks, Damon.

59
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:08,608

00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:51,644
So your favorite animal's a shark?

122
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:52,980
- Yup.
- Pretty cool.

123
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:56,853
l almost came as a shark, but l realized
that an eagle's slightly better.

124
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:01,225
- What are you supposed to be?
- Tarantula.

125
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:05,891

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,574
- You're competing?
- Yup.

131

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,959
Jarrod, he's the Eagle Lord
and l'm Blaze.

00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,521
You had some pretty cool moves for
someone who'd never played before.

178
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,187
Takes more than cool moves
to defeat a champion.

179
00:17:30,797 --> 00:17:32,731
Don't forget that.

180
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:39,498
Ow, ow.

181
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:02,795
This is a plane l made.

182
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,059
Cool.

183
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,800
Guitar, emery board, fret board.

184
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:13,728
Painted eggs.

185
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,866
Jewelry.

186
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:17,466
Watch wallet.

187
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:23,314
Wow.

188
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:27,417
This is the area
where l make my candles.

189
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:32,248
Flame within a flame. Conceptual.

190
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:34,217
Giant pencil.

191
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:36,086
Ancient coin.

192
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,024
Probably sell these to the Muslims.

193
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:42,190
Sell this one to the Yanks. Make a mint.

194
00:18:42,302 --> 00:18:43,633
Cool.

195
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:46,638
l guess l've gotta keep creating
or l'll just die.

196
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:48,906
Wow.

197
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:58,317
So who's that Tarantula guy.
ls that your boyfriend?

198
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:00,580
Oh, no. He's my brother.

199
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:06,487
He's a cartoonist. And he's
very good at accents and impressions.

200
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:10,556
My brother's dead.

201
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:13,456
Oh, l'm sorry.

202
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:18,400
My parents are dead too.

203
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:21,538
Yeah, well...

204
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:24,307
...my mum's dead as well.

205
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:29,572
How did your parents die?

206
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:31,674
- Heart attacks.
- Were they too fat?

207
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,379
Oh, no. My dad died when he was 72,

208
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:38,891
and then my mum died
because she really missed him.

209
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:42,158
Yeah, well...

210
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:46,664
...my mum got kicked
in the head by a cow.

211
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,561
Can't go near cows now
because of that,

212
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,695
because l think about her too much.

213
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,170
l'm so sorry about your mum.

214
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:59,804
- And your brother.
- lt's cool.

215
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,472
You're pretty beautiful.

216
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:08,211
Same. l mean, you are too...
sort of, more handsome.

217
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:11,888
- Do you wanna kiss?
- Yep.

218
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,721
On the lips, though.

219
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:14,919
- Yep.
- OK.

220
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:27,733
Wanna have a lie-down on my bed?

221
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,138
- Yep.
- OK.

222
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,946
Do you wanna have sex?

223
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,919
Um, yep.

224
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,035
Fuck.

225
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:07,144
Sorry.

226
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,246
<i>Hello?</i>

227
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:17,215
Hello, is Eric there please?

228
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:18,648
<i>Who's speaking?</i>

229
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:20,208
The police.

230
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,312
<i>Hello?</i>

231
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,518
You're fuckin' dead,
you fuckin' Samoan fuck.

232
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:27,821
<i>Who is this?</i>

233
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:29,155
<i>Stop...</i>

234
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,007
Oh, hi.

235
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,707
What are you doing here?

236
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:25,213
l just had a sandwich
and l was, you know, nearby.

237
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,188
That was pretty good sex last night.

238
00:23:31,191 --> 00:23:33,853
OK, well. l'm going back to work.

239
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,222
OK, bye.

240
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:36,693
- See ya.
- See ya.

241
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:40,265
Uh, what are you up to tonight?

242
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:43,461
- l don't know.
- l might go to a movie. You can come.

243
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:46,562
lt's the new Wolverine movie.
lt's got Hugh Jackman in it.

244
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:49,608
Apparently, l look like him.
Gets pretty tiresome.

245
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:52,304
''Hey, Jarrod,
you look like Wolverine.''

246
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:55,541
Sometimes l wish l did have knives
that came out of my fists.

247
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:58,309
Anyway, it's 7:30 at Cine-saurus Rex.

248
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:00,545
- lf you want to come. l don't care.
- Yep.

249
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,747
Do you? OK. OK. See ya.

250
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:05,655
- See ya. Jarrod?
- Yeah?

251
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:07,317
- Eagle, eh?
- What?

252
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:09,622
Your favorite animal? Eagle?

253
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:12,163
Yeah, or cobra.

254
00:24:12,232 --> 00:24:14,496
But, yeah, pretty much eagle rules.

255
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:17,297
- OK. See ya.
- See ya.

256
00:25:32,478 --> 00:25:34,275
- Hey.
- Hi.

257
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:37,111
Yeah, so l didn't end up
going to that movie. Did you?

258
00:25:37,183 --> 00:25:38,673
Yep, oh, no.

259
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,111
l knew it.

260
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:45,087
How did you find out where l live?

261
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:47,319
l got my flatmate to ring up your work.

262
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:49,657
Tell them it was an emergency.

263
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:52,959
You probably shouldn't go in there.
They think you're dead.

264
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,605
Yeah. l had to be alone.

265
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:07,612
l got depressed about something.

266
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:11,139
l suffer from depression.

267
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:16,251
Fifty. Break.

268
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:20,488
Yeah, that makes me pretty intense.

269
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,892
l just do stuff without thinking.

270
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:26,754
What's wrong?

271
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:29,357
l need to go home. To my hometown.

272
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:31,437
- Oh, that sounds cool.
- No.

273
00:26:31,537 --> 00:26:35,029
lt's not cool. lt's necessary.

274
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:36,541
Why?

275
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,078
Because of my mission.
lt's time to put my training into use.

276
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:42,910
What do you have to do?

277
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:45,109
Kill a man... Probably.

278
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:50,312
- Who?
- Eric Elisi. He's Samoan.

279
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,085
Why? What did he do?

280
00:26:52,158 --> 00:26:55,958
Nearly ruined my life, that's all.
He's my high school nemesis.

281
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:59,520
He's been living in Samoa,
but l just heard from my contact

282
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:01,600
that he's gonna be home soon.

283
00:27:02,368 --> 00:27:06,464
When he gets back, guess who's
gonna be forming the welcoming party?

284
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:10,899
- You?
- You got it, girl.

285
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:13,411
What exactly are you gonna do to him?

286
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:16,004
l'm gonna kick his Samoan ass,
that's what.

287
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:17,982
lt's time to pay the piper.

288
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:22,715
He's gonna reap what he sowed,
and it sure ain't corn... or wheat.

289
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:23,915
When are you going?

290
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,322
That's the fucking point. l can't leave!

291
00:27:29,796 --> 00:27:34,392
Sorry. l told you, l just
snap sometimes. lt's my depression.

292
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,694
Sorry.

293
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,764
Why can't you leave?

294
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:42,638
Don't have any wheels. How the hell am l
gonna get there if l got no wheels?

295
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:43,801
On a bus?

296
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:47,539
l'm not gonna take a damn bus.
lt'll take ages.

297
00:27:47,613 --> 00:27:49,478
l'll get there in, like, two weeks.

298
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,313
Why don't you hire a car?

299
00:27:51,384 --> 00:27:54,285
OK. Sure. Have you got,
like, a million dollars for me?

300
00:27:58,224 --> 00:28:00,385
- What about Damon?
- Who?

301
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,825
My brother.

302
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:03,020
Oh, yeah, sorry.

303
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:05,323
He's got a car. He's got a Ford Laser.

304
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:07,296
Shall l ask him?

305
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:10,631
Yeah.

306
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:14,434
Damon, would it be all right
if we borrowed your car

307
00:28:14,507 --> 00:28:16,498
to take Jarrod to his hometown?

308
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:18,300
Yes.

309
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:21,276
- He said yes.
- l heard.

310
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:24,240
Thanks, man. You're cool.

311
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:22,302
- Horse.
- Damn.

312
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:25,276
- l've got 1 4, you've only got eight.
- You're too good.

313
00:29:25,344 --> 00:29:26,641
How many have you got?

314
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:29,207
None.

315
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:33,610
- Horse.
- Damn.

316
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:36,311
Look, l don't even get it.

317
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:39,222
Just whenever you see a horse,
you say ''horse,''

318
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:42,750
and whoever, in the end,
has the most horses wins all the horses.

319
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:45,457
Well, no. Not so much, really,
just like pretend.

320
00:29:45,565 --> 00:29:47,897
Yeah, well,
it's not even a real game.

321
00:29:50,436 --> 00:29:53,837
l don't really want to play this game
anymore, Damon. lt's dumb.

322
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:57,569
Hey, so...
What did the Samoan guy do to you?

323
00:29:57,643 --> 00:29:59,634
Damon, that might be personal.

324
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:01,270
lt's cool.

325
00:30:02,181 --> 00:30:05,878
Him and some other guys
from school used to gang up on me.

326
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:07,510
l used to be a bit of a nerd.

327
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:13,724
Would've been OK one on one.
Even one on two, me against two of them.

328
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:18,457
But l'd usually have to fight,
like, eight of them.

329
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:20,156
That's awful.

330
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:24,600
Sometimes my brother would help out,
and then we'd kick some serious ass.

331
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:29,000
But usually they'd find me when
l was alone, and l'm like, ''Oh, OK,

332
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:32,875
now l have to fight eight of you.
Come on then, bring it on.''

333
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:36,540
Anyway, l don't really
want to talk about it.

334
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:43,212
Jarrod...

335
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:46,784
...get out of the car.

336
00:30:49,228 --> 00:30:52,129
l need your clothes
and your boots and your motorcycle.

337
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:57,202
- Know who that is?
- [chuckles] Arnie.

338
00:30:57,303 --> 00:31:00,864
- lt's Arnie.
- He sounds just like him.

339
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,272
Hey, l bought some apples for you guys.

340
00:31:03,342 --> 00:31:06,175
Thanks. l'll have one later.

341
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:15,720
Oh, yuk.

342
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:17,847
This is rotten.

343
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:21,850
Thanks very much for
trying to kill me, Damon.

344
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:46,879
So are you gonna introduce us?

345
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:52,287
- This is Nancy, my sister.
- Hi.

346
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:54,519
- This is Doug, her husband.
- Hi.

347
00:31:55,561 --> 00:31:57,791
This is Dad. He's my Dad.

348
00:31:57,897 --> 00:32:00,195
- This is my friend, Damon.
- Hello.

349
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:02,461
And this is Lily.

350
00:32:03,302 --> 00:32:07,261
<i>Lily's, like, the best female
Fight Man player l have ever seen.</i>

351
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:10,042
- And she's a dancer.
- Cool.

352
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,236
No, l'm not.

353
00:32:14,146 --> 00:32:15,670
l thought you said that once.

354
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:19,010
l like your jackets and your pants.

355
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:23,084
Thanks. This is our own label,
Awesome Apparel.

356
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:26,591
- lt didn't really take off.
- Which makes these quite rare.

357
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:29,787
- Really?
- You wouldn't find these in any shops.

358
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:33,524
We've actually got surplus stock
if you guys are keen to buy anything.

359
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:34,691
Oh, yeah?

360
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,427

Yeah?

362

Thanks, Jarrod.

365
00:32:58,858 --> 00:33:01,418
Where are you guys gonna sleep?
There's no room.

366
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:03,961
- What about my room?
- Our stock's in there.

367
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,089
- Gordon's room?
- Dad's in there.

368
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:07,392
Who's in his room?

Us.

370
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:10,258

- Zane.

371
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:13,600
- Vinny's in here.

372
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:15,334
Pitch the tent.

373
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:18,377
l don't want to sleep
in a damn tent. This is typical.

374
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:21,345
- No one ever thinks about me.
- 'Cause you're a loser.

375
00:33:21,414 --> 00:33:23,109
You're a loser. Bitch.

376
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:25,150
- Cock hole.
- Bitch.

377
00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:26,479
- Cock hole.
- Bitch.

378
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:28,281
- Cock hole. Cock hole.
- Bitch.

379
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,481
Stop calling me cock hole, bitch.

380
00:33:33,826 --> 00:33:35,157
- Cock hole.

381
00:33:36,262 --> 00:33:39,390
You're a bitch
and you're gonna die of diabetes.

382
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,995
- Twenty-eight years old.

383
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:45,333
Treat me like an adult, bitch.

384
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,718
Hey, wow. That's you.

385
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:12,855
What? Yes.

386
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:17,694
- That's so well done.
- lt's OK. My brother did it.

387
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:22,738
What's all that stuff?

388
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:24,742
- Stuff.
- More candles?

389
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,677
Yes. Rejects.
Ones that aren't good enough.

390
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:32,942
Hey, wow. lt's a hand.
And it's pointing up.

391
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:36,454
Give me that. Who gave you
permission to touch that?

392
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:37,921
No one. Sorry.

393
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,721
How'd you like it if l went to your
place, started touching everything?

394
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:44,318
Like your books and
your oven, or your computer.

395
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:48,457
How about l started messing around on
your computer and changed the settings.

396
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,558
Changed your bloody desktop picture?

397
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:52,927
l said l was sorry.

398
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:59,941
This candle was supposed to be for
my Dad, but he thought it was dumb.

399
00:35:00,012 --> 00:35:03,413
- Well, l think it's cool.
- lt's a reject.

400
00:35:09,588 --> 00:35:10,850
How did your brother die?

401
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:12,780
Sorry.

402
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:17,087
He was saving a kid
from a fire at the school.

403
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:21,228
- Wow.
- Wow.

404
00:35:26,138 --> 00:35:28,003
[Damon] l'll be back in a week, right?

405
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,168
Yep.

406
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,603
You need anything,
you just give me a call, OK?

407
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,146
Yeah.

408
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:39,017

409
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:40,278
Yep.

410
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,351
Oh, wait.

411
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:47,152
- Safety grass.
- Safety grass.

412
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:51,823
- [Austrian accent] l'll be back.

413
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:55,458
- See you later, cock hole.

414
00:35:57,036 --> 00:35:58,901
See ya. Love ya.

415
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:40,636
Done.

416
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:49,549
l like your family.
Doug and Nancy are very nice.

417
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:52,216
They're idiots.
Except for my Dad and me.

418
00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:55,384
l like them.

419
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:57,985
Yeah, well. They're still idiots.

420
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,377
This is Mason Hutchinson.
He's the best computer hacker l know.

421
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:22,647
Gidday, Mason.

422
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:26,782
<i>This is Lily McKinnon. She's the best
female Fight Man player l've ever seen.</i>

423
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:28,451
Hi.

424
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:33,864
Down to business. Any developments?
When's the bastard getting back?

425
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:08,924
Not today, but the next day.

426
00:38:11,136 --> 00:38:14,367
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

427
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,169
Good work.

428
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:18,300
How did you find out
this information?

429
00:38:18,377 --> 00:38:21,073
l asked his mum.
She lives in his house.

430
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:22,170
Good.

431
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:26,445
l'm glad he'll have someone to wipe his
ass when l turn him into a vegetable.

432
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:36,687
You've got pornography
on your computer screen.

433
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:48,372
<i>Oh, Baby. Oh, Baby.</i>

434
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,843
<i>Oh, Baby. Oh, Baby.</i>

435
00:38:56,815 --> 00:38:59,045
lt's got a virus.

436
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,184
Lilies.

437
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:13,997
Go. Move.

438
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:29,538
Hi, Dad.

439
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:45,955
Hey, Zane. You still playing guitar?

440
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:47,396
Yep, yep.

441
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,468
Me and Zane are in a band.

442
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:53,402
- Wow.
- He does the music and l dance.

443
00:39:53,472 --> 00:39:58,000
Cool. Lily plays guitar. She's really
good. She's good at finger picking.

444
00:39:58,077 --> 00:40:00,068
- Really?
- No, not really.

445
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:03,911
- Just, sort of, teaching myself.
- And she's got a degree.

446
00:40:03,982 --> 00:40:05,677
No l don't.

447
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:08,377
What do your parents do?

448
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:11,014
- They're dead, unfortunately.
- They're dead.

449
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,388
Good one, Nancy.
They had heart attacks.

450
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:15,253
Sorry, Lily.

451
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,885
- lt doesn't matter.
- She's an orphan.

452
00:40:17,996 --> 00:40:19,759
Like Oliver Twist.

453
00:40:25,604 --> 00:40:27,765
Well, l suppose l should
say a few words.

454
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,966
Why?

455
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:33,839
Now we're all here, l'd just
like to say that l'm really happy

456
00:40:33,912 --> 00:40:36,244
that we're all together
under the same roof.

457
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:38,647
lt's always great to come home.

458
00:40:38,717 --> 00:40:40,708
l'd also like to say
that this Saturday

459
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,448
l will be having a
scheduled fight with Eric Elisi.

460
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:46,719
- The Samoan.
- Oh, yeah. He used to beat you up.

461
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,783
- Yeah, and me.
- Yeah, and him.

462
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:51,791
He was the toughest guy at our school.

463
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:54,422
He used to pick on
quite a few people, actually.

464
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:57,502
Anyway, you're all invited to attend.

465
00:40:57,569 --> 00:40:59,764
lt'd be great to see you there.

466
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:01,169
Thank you.

467
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,708
Why are you fighting him, Uncle?

468
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:07,371
Well, Zane, basically,
l'm gonna restore honor

469
00:41:07,446 --> 00:41:09,573
to the family name, to your family name.

470
00:41:09,648 --> 00:41:12,048
My family name is Davis. Eh, Dad?

471
00:41:12,117 --> 00:41:14,711
Yep. Dangerous Davis, back in the day.

472
00:41:14,787 --> 00:41:18,348
- Yeah, l'm a Davis too.
- Yeah, well it doesn't matter, does it?

473
00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:21,756
We're family. That's what matters.

474
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:31,799
Why didn't you tell me
you had a little girl?

475
00:41:32,704 --> 00:41:34,137
l don't know.

476
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:37,840
- How often do you see her?
- Not very.

477
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:41,204
- How old is she?
- Nine.

478
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:45,842
<i>- Were you married?
- No. What is this Crimewatch?</i>

479
00:41:46,585 --> 00:41:51,420
<i>We met at a party, we had sex, then
a baby came out. End of story. Finito.</i>

480
00:41:54,393 --> 00:41:56,361
How many boyfriends have you had?

481
00:41:56,461 --> 00:41:59,328
- Three.
- Who?

482
00:41:59,398 --> 00:42:03,164
Sam, Sam, another Sam and Raymond.

483
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:08,030
How many girlfriends have you had?

484
00:42:09,408 --> 00:42:11,399
About five.

485
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:14,411
Actually eight. l forgot some.

486
00:42:15,314 --> 00:42:18,078
- Who?
- That's irrelevant.

487
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:37,335
- Lily.
- Yep.

488
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:41,099
You can hold my hand
if you want.

489
00:42:41,173 --> 00:42:44,336
OK.

490
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:04,421
- Good morning.
- Morning.

491
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:06,520
- Hi.
- Hey.

492
00:43:07,232 --> 00:43:09,200
Look at all this stuff.

493
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:11,462
How much do you reckon you'd pay...

494
00:43:11,536 --> 00:43:14,096
...for all this makeup?
A bag, like this?

495
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:17,798
Dunno. Maybe a hundred bucks?

496
00:43:19,544 --> 00:43:21,910
No. All this is only 30 dollars.

497
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:24,775
And it's dermatologically sweet as.

498
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,080
- Yep. But you can have it for 20.
- Cool.

499
00:43:27,152 --> 00:43:28,244
Five.

500
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,948
Twenty-five dollars.
Because you're a guest.

501
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,919
Combination.

502
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:38,451
Kick, punch, block, spin, double kick.

503
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:45,899
Kick, spin, kick,
punch, double kick.

504
00:43:46,204 --> 00:43:48,172
OK, ball. Block.

505
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,969
Stick, block. Block.

506
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:53,735
Hoop. Through, yes.

507
00:43:55,714 --> 00:43:57,648
- Hi.
- Hey, Trace.

508
00:43:57,716 --> 00:43:58,978

513

She's good at sports.
Netball, darts...

515
00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:18,534
- Here, Jonah, here's that tape.
- Thank you.

516
00:44:18,603 --> 00:44:21,970
Hey Trace-meister.

Oh, thanks.

520

- Lily, show them your hula hooping.
- Oh, no. l'm not really that good.

521

Yes, you are.
She is good. Show them.

522

Dad, what do you think
of my new girlfriend?

526
00:45:08,954 --> 00:45:12,355
She's an artist and a musician.
Amongst other things.

527
00:45:12,424 --> 00:45:15,552

Doesn't matter.
Chicks, they just like flowers.

536
00:46:16,154 --> 00:46:17,587
Chilly.

537
00:46:21,626 --> 00:46:23,025

l gotta be alone right now.

541
00:46:37,142 --> 00:46:38,439
Oh, yeah.

544
00:46:45,317 --> 00:46:48,411
- l didn't know this would happen.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

545
00:46:51,923 --> 00:46:54,153
And we can still be friends, right?

546
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,349
Yep.

547
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:01,632
Damn it.

Have you checked out
our local social scene yet?

601
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:07,113
No, not really.

602
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:09,977
We're going to a party tomorrow night.

Gaseous Maximus.

610
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:03,902
- What's so funny?
- Oh, Lily just told a funny joke.

611
00:56:03,975 --> 00:56:05,465
Yeah. Where have you been?

612
00:56:05,543 --> 00:56:09,570
Just hanging out with Tracy. We've been
pretty much laughing the whole day.

613
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:12,172
Like this, but about
ten times more laughing.

614
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,241
Wow. That's heaps.

615

Excuse me. Thank you.

00:56:31,102 --> 00:56:35,539
<i>Gordon. Gordon.

00:56:49,253 --> 00:56:51,244
<i>Get out of it.</i>

619
00:56:55,193 --> 00:56:57,354
Dad, me and Tracy are going out.

620
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:03,191
Don't know how it happened,
but it's pretty serious.

621
00:57:10,408 --> 00:57:12,740
Just thought you should know
the good news.

622
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:26,680
<i>- Yeah.</i>

623
00:57:53,885 --> 00:57:57,343
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. l'm asleep.

624
00:57:58,222 --> 00:58:00,918
- Why don't you go sleep in the tent?
- l'm all right.

625
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:05,952
You go in the tent.
l'll... l'll sleep out here.

626
00:58:06,063 --> 00:58:07,621
No, you go.

627
00:58:07,732 --> 00:58:10,565

628
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:12,796
l've got my sleeping bag. l'm good.

629
00:58:16,174 --> 00:58:18,574
You don't complain
about anything, do you?

630
00:58:18,643 --> 00:58:22,238
There's some people in the world
who don't even have sleeping bags.

631
00:58:33,758 --> 00:58:35,749
There's a weird smell down there.

632
00:58:36,561 --> 00:58:38,028
l don't like it.

633
00:58:38,095 --> 00:58:41,064
Think it's probably
a dead hedgehog or something.

634
00:58:41,165 --> 00:58:43,133
Disgusting.

635
00:58:45,203 --> 00:58:48,172
lf you get cold you can
come sleep in my tent,

636
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:51,231
but please don't wake me up.

637
00:58:51,309 --> 00:58:53,140
The last thing l need.

638
00:59:06,657 --> 00:59:09,785
You seem to be getting on
pretty well with my family.

639
00:59:09,827 --> 00:59:12,227
Told you, l like them.

640
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:17,158
Yeah, well. Don't get too close.
They'll turn on you, that's for sure.

641
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,633
What was that joke
you told them?

642
00:59:25,743 --> 00:59:27,904
Just my favorite.

643
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:29,913
One of Damon's.

644
00:59:33,351 --> 00:59:35,182
Can you tell it to me?

645
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:37,652
No.

646
00:59:56,073 --> 00:59:59,167

01:04:07,191 --> 01:04:10,319
No, l didn't break up with him.
He broke up with me.

695
01:04:10,394 --> 01:04:13,261
Oh, well, you would've. Given time.

696
01:04:18,602 --> 01:04:20,331
Take me away from here.

697
01:04:20,437 --> 01:04:22,371
- Where?
- Anywhere.

698
01:04:22,439 --> 01:04:26,899
- Help me escape.
- OK. Where shall we go?

699
01:04:27,011 --> 01:04:29,002
Where do you wanna go?

700
01:04:29,947 --> 01:04:32,507
Home. Wanna go home.

701
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:36,019
Home's horrible.
You must wanna go somewhere else.

702
01:04:38,055 --> 01:04:41,582
- Hm, dunno. Be Australia.
- No, not there.

703
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:44,423
My ex-wife lives there.

704
01:04:45,863 --> 01:04:47,728
What? ls she alive?

705
01:04:47,798 --> 01:04:50,562
Who cares about her? She's a lesbian.

706
01:05:26,036 --> 01:05:28,664
OK, don't put the blade out.

707
01:05:31,242 --> 01:05:33,710
- Whoa. Stop the press.
- Wow.

708
01:05:33,777 --> 01:05:35,972
We've got a fashion model in the house.

709
01:05:36,046 --> 01:05:38,537
- ls that the makeup you got from us?
- Yep.

710
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:41,676
- And your skin's all right?
- Yep. Why?

711
01:05:41,752 --> 01:05:44,550
- Oh, we were just wondering.
- Oh, nothing.

712
01:05:44,622 --> 01:05:48,023
l was wondering if l could
potentially still come to that party?

713
01:05:48,092 --> 01:05:50,526
- Sure.
- Thank you.

714
01:05:51,662 --> 01:05:55,564
ls this sort of appropriate? l don't
really have any sort of party gears.

715
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:24,587
Lily! Lily! Lily!

716
01:07:48,045 --> 01:07:51,572
Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily!

717
01:08:53,277 --> 01:08:56,474
Did you have a nice time
fucking my friend Mason Hutchinson?

718
01:08:56,547 --> 01:08:57,571
What?

719
01:08:57,648 --> 01:09:00,640
You have a nice time
fucking my friend Mason Hutchinson?

720
01:09:00,717 --> 01:09:02,912
Or did you do everyone
at the whole party?

721
01:09:02,986 --> 01:09:04,044
l didn't do anyone.

722
01:09:06,023 --> 01:09:08,548
Anyway, what do you care?
You've got Tracy.

723
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:10,889
We're not going out.
We haven't even kissed.

724
01:09:10,961 --> 01:09:13,896
Could've if l wanted to,
but l've been too busy training.

725
01:09:15,232 --> 01:09:16,893
Where did you sleep last night?

726
01:09:17,835 --> 01:09:19,359
- ln the bushes.
- Great.

727
01:09:19,436 --> 01:09:22,200
l'm up all night
wondering where the hell you are.

728
01:09:22,306 --> 01:09:25,537
l thought you were dead.
Could've left me a note or something.

729
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:28,271
Easy, ''Dear Jarrod,
don't wait up all night long.

730
01:09:28,345 --> 01:09:30,813
l'll be sleeping in the bushes.
Thank you.''

731
01:09:30,914 --> 01:09:33,508
l didn't get any sleep last night.
lt's my big day.

732
01:09:33,584 --> 01:09:36,712
What am l going to tell your brother?
Oh, yeah. Hi, Damon.

733
01:09:36,787 --> 01:09:39,278
Your sister, Lily, oh, nah.

734
01:09:39,356 --> 01:09:42,382
Oh, she went to a party and got killed.

735
01:09:42,493 --> 01:09:45,894
Here's a bit of her leg,
that's all that's left.

736
01:09:45,963 --> 01:09:47,954
You should be more careful next time.

737
01:09:48,031 --> 01:09:50,397
l'm not gonna be there
to wait up for you.

738
01:09:50,467 --> 01:09:53,129
- Gotta go.

739
01:09:53,237 --> 01:09:55,205
- You ready for your fight?
- Yes.

740
01:09:55,305 --> 01:09:57,773
l'm gonna cut his damn head off.

741
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:00,543
Not that you'll be there.

742
01:10:00,644 --> 01:10:03,636
You'll probably be off having sex
with heaps of people.

743
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:07,414
l'll think about it.

744
01:10:22,165 --> 01:10:25,100
Can you remind my dad to come?
Because he might forget.

745
01:10:31,174 --> 01:10:34,143
<i>- Hi, this is Michael Jackson.
- Damon, it's Lily.</i>

746
01:10:34,211 --> 01:10:36,111
Lily. l tried to call.

747
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:39,444
<i>- How's it going down there?
- lt's been pretty weird.</i>

748
01:10:39,516 --> 01:10:42,212
You want to come home?
l can come and get you.

749
01:10:42,286 --> 01:10:44,083
No, it's too far. l'll catch a bus.

750
01:10:44,154 --> 01:10:46,679
You sure? l can leave right now.

751
01:10:46,757 --> 01:10:50,193
Yeah, no, no. lt goes tomorrow.
l'll be home in time for tea.

752
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:53,491
l'll make your favorite, shepherd's pie?

753
01:10:53,564 --> 01:10:56,533
<i>- Oh, yum.
- You gonna be OK?</i>

754
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,364
Yeah. lt's just really nice
to hear your voice.

755
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:00,960
OK. Well, l'm right here, OK?

756
01:11:01,071 --> 01:11:02,595
Yeah, l know.

757
01:11:02,706 --> 01:11:07,109
Well, you have a shaggadelic day,
baby, yeah!

758
01:11:07,177 --> 01:11:09,202
<i>- Do behave.</i>

759
01:11:09,313 --> 01:11:11,213
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

760
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:31,998
Gordon jumped off that.

761
01:11:33,403 --> 01:11:37,066
Look at it, sticking up there
like a bloody tombstone.

762
01:11:40,677 --> 01:11:42,508
lt was so wonderful when he won.

763
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:48,074
l just wanted him to keep on
doing better, you know, to keep winning.

764
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:52,379
Maybe that's why he did it...

765
01:11:53,056 --> 01:11:54,785
...because of me.

766
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:57,790
l'll never know now.

767
01:12:00,564 --> 01:12:03,499
My whole life's a complete disaster.

768
01:12:06,169 --> 01:12:11,630
You know,
life is full of hard bits, l think.

769
01:12:11,742 --> 01:12:17,339
But in between the hard bits
are some really lovely bits.

770
01:12:18,815 --> 01:12:20,442
l mean, Jarrod's a lovely bit.

771
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:24,917
- Jarrod?
- Yep.

772
01:12:25,622 --> 01:12:27,988
- Jarrod?
- Yeah.

773
01:12:28,058 --> 01:12:31,221
- l just don't think you know him.
- Yes, l do. l know my family.

774
01:12:31,294 --> 01:12:33,353
Better than you do.

775
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:35,898
Oh, what's Jarrod's
favorite animal then?

776
01:12:35,966 --> 01:12:38,628
- A giraffe.
- No.

777
01:12:40,837 --> 01:12:41,861
- An octopus.
- No.

778
01:12:41,972 --> 01:12:45,032
- Well, a cheetah then.
- No.

779
01:12:46,276 --> 01:12:48,244
lt's an eagle.

780
01:12:51,448 --> 01:12:52,972
OK.

781
01:12:55,919 --> 01:12:57,511
Or a cobra.

782
01:13:29,086 --> 01:13:31,611
- Good luck, Eagle.
- What?

783
01:13:32,322 --> 01:13:35,155
Eagle. l know.

784
01:13:51,475 --> 01:13:52,464
There he is.

785
01:14:01,985 --> 01:14:03,577
Kick his ass!

786
01:14:11,661 --> 01:14:15,358
- ls this a trick?
- No, it's not a trick.

787
01:14:15,432 --> 01:14:16,899
Mason?

788
01:14:18,568 --> 01:14:20,433
Mason? ls it? ls he tricking?

789
01:14:26,777 --> 01:14:29,439
- Can you move?
- Yeah.

790
01:14:29,513 --> 01:14:30,844
- Your legs.
- No.

791
01:14:30,914 --> 01:14:33,075
- Can you feel anything in them?
- No.

792
01:14:39,256 --> 01:14:41,747
- Ah! Fuck off.
- You felt it.

793
01:14:41,825 --> 01:14:44,191
- No, l didn't.
- Well, did you feel it or what?

794
01:14:44,261 --> 01:14:45,387
- No.
- You screamed.

795
01:14:45,462 --> 01:14:48,363
Of course l screamed.
You hit me with fuckin' nunchucks!

796
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:53,296
- You're a cripple.
- Yeah.

797
01:14:55,305 --> 01:14:56,897
He's a cripple.

798
01:14:58,909 --> 01:15:01,275
l don't fuckin' believe it.

799
01:15:01,344 --> 01:15:04,074
Mason, why didn't you tell me?

800
01:15:04,147 --> 01:15:06,877
- l did, kind of.
- No, you didn't.

801
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:09,180
Yeah, on the phone before l came here.

802
01:15:09,252 --> 01:15:12,653
You said, ''When l'm finished with him,
he won't be able to walk.''

803
01:15:12,722 --> 01:15:15,282
- And l laughed.
- ls that what you meant?

804
01:15:15,358 --> 01:15:17,053
Yeah.

01:15:24,467 --> 01:15:28,096
But l've been training.
l was gonna kick your ass.

806
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:31,473
- When did it happen?
- About a year ago.

807
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:33,168
- How?
- Accident.

808
01:15:33,276 --> 01:15:34,766

810
01:15:36,847 --> 01:15:39,782

811
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:42,318
- Listen...
- Shut up. l'm trying to think.

812
01:15:42,385 --> 01:15:44,649

815
01:15:49,259 --> 01:15:53,025
For all the things l did.
For picking on you at school.

816
01:15:53,096 --> 01:15:55,087
Jesus, it was such a long time ago.

01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,198

818
01:17:02,532 --> 01:17:04,261

820
01:17:09,406 --> 01:17:12,000
Jarrod! Cut it out.

821
01:17:18,315 --> 01:17:20,044
Come here! Come here!

822
01:17:35,465 --> 01:17:37,865
Leave him. He's had enough.

823
01:18:36,226 --> 01:18:37,693
Hello.

824
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,467
