I would become a skeleton
if we waited in line with you every day

407
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,242
Is the sugar over?

408
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,329

You are not yourself these days

418
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:52,954

00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:34,687
Do not speak of the superior again
Do you understand?

431
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,544
Allah make him fall

432
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:38,687
He said he cant marry me before
his mother dies

433
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:41,471
Should we kill his mother dad?

434

440
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:55,646
If the superior disturbs her

What do they want?

494
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:37,062
They are not in a good mood

495
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:39,211

972
00:49:48,662 --> 00:49:51,157
it contains very valuable candies

973
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,067
guess this is the tradition

974
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:57,365
they make the groom wait in cold

975
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:01,384
he's waiting outside

976
00:50:01,675 --> 00:50:04,305
you see, we make the groom wait outside

977
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:05,363
because of you

978
00:50:05,363 --> 00:50:06,432
let him wait

979
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:08,423
who does he think he is?

980
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,932

981
00:50:09,932 --> 00:50:11,112

982
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:17,517

983
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:19,452
i have always liked Hacer

984
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:21,266
she is very skilled

985
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:22,536
and a nice lady

986
00:50:22,536 --> 00:50:24,409
so we thought

987
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:26,832
We decided to ask for her
with Allah's commandment

988
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:31,061
go check that

989
00:50:32,722 --> 00:50:33,727

my father is talking business inside

994
00:50:42,752 --> 00:50:46,541
man, is it acceptable to make
a mighty groom shake like a dog?

995
00:50:52,776 --> 00:50:55,407
he is crying off, dad

996
00:50:56,016 --> 00:50:57,571
well, i cant make the guy wait longer

997
00:50:57,571 --> 00:50:59,546

998
00:50:59,546 --> 00:51:01,914

999
00:51:01,914 --> 00:51:03,309
