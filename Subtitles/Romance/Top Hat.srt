1
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:25,674
I beg your pardon.

2
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:30,438
Good evening.

3
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:38,747
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Hardwick.

4
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,921
- Has Mr. Jerry Travers come in yet?
- Yes, sir.

5
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:48,690
He's been waiting for you

6
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:50,125
the entire evening, sir.

7
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:53,328
The entire evening? Oh, dear.

8
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:54,996
Thanks.

9
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,898
Begging your pardon, sir.

10
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,467
But is that the Mr. Travers,

11
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:01,670
the well-known American gentleman, sir?

12
00:04:01,903 --> 00:04:03,038
It is indeed.

13
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:05,674
He's come over to star in my show.

14
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:07,842
It's his first London appearance.

15
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:09,544
Your show, Mr. Hardwick?

16
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:10,845
I'm producing it.

17
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:12,347
But I don't want

18
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,581
any of the members here to know.

19
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,016
I want to surprise them.

20
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,252
I'm sure they'll be surprised,

21
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:18,219
Mr. Hardwick.

22
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,237
Hello, Jerry. I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

23
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:51,119
Jerry, there are a lot of things

24
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:52,053
that I have to discuss.

25
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:53,288
So I want you to come over

26
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:54,389
to my hotel now.

27
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:05,767
What happened?

28
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:16,678
Jerry, I forgot to tell you.

29
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:18,947
I want you to stay here for the night.

30
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,615
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

31
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:21,816
But you must, old man, really.

32
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,917
You see, at the moment, I'm having

33
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,252
a sort of a problem with my valet.

34
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:27,722
What do you want me to do,

35
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:28,590
press your pants?

36
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:30,191
No. You wouldn't know how.

37
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:31,626
No, you don't understand.

38
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,494
It's my man, Bates.

39
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,429
- We've had a bit of a tiff.
- How terrible.

40
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:37,532
- You didn't come to blows or anything?
- Nothing like that.

41
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:38,833
We're not speaking to each other.

42
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:41,703
We've had rather a clash of taste.

43
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,539
You see, Bates insists that a square tie...

44
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:46,174
is the only possible tie

45
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:47,976
that can be worn with evening clothes.

46
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,345
A square tie, imagine.

47
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:52,580
I prefer the butterfly.

48
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:55,417
- I think Bates is right.
- Bates is never right.

49
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,920
- Well, then why don't you fire him?
- That's a little difficult.

50
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,855
I'm hoping against hope

51
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,624
that the man will just disappear.

52
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:04,059
I hate to interfere

53
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:05,827
in these little family squabbles.

54
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,162
But let's hope he'll approve of me.

55
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,464
There's never any telling with Bates.

56
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:11,766
There you are.

57
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,201
If you please.

58
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:19,341
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

59
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:21,076
Allow us to introduce ourselves, sir.

60
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:22,777
We are Bates, sir.

61
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:24,112
Really?

62
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:29,884
- We are Jerry Travers.
- Welcome to our menage.

63
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:30,685
Thank you, Bates.

64
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:32,887
It seems that I'm to stay here tonight.

65
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:34,522
At least that was the idea

66
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,291
of our beloved impresario.

67
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:37,792
Whose idea?

68
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:39,527
Mr. Hardwick's.

69
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:41,896
His idea.

70
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:49,004
Welcome anyhow.

71
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:51,172
Thank you, Bates.

72
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:53,341
Pardon, sir, but may we make

73
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,576
a personal observation?

74
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:57,212
- Not too personal.
- No, sir.

75
00:06:57,712 --> 00:06:59,381
It's merely that we feel impelled

76
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:00,648
to compliment you, sir...

77
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:04,386
upon your excellent taste in ties.

78
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:14,229
- They like me.
- You never know.

79
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:16,064
Where on earth did you ever find him?

80
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,465
From the Salvation Army,

81
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:18,199
as a matter of fact.

82
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,301
I sent them a pair of very old shoes.

83
00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:22,137
I see. And the shoes came back

84
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,038
and Bates was in them.

85
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:24,305
And he's been wearing

86
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,373
my good ones ever since.

87
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,978
- How's Madge feeling?
- She's fine. Thanks, Jerry.

88
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:30,912
The climate at the Lido

89
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:31,846
has done her a lot of good.

90
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,715
That's fine. Too bad she won't be here

91
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:34,649
for the opening tomorrow night.

92
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,518
Isn't it? She's heartbroken, really.

93
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,119
However, she's expecting us to fly down

94
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:39,454
to Italy for a weekend.

95
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,222
Fly down to Italy for a weekend?

96
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:43,658
I can't. I haven't got any goggles.

97
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,760
My word, Jerry, you'll have to go.

98
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:46,494
She's counting on us.

99
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:47,529
She's going to have

100
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:48,697
a young friend visit her.

101
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,265
I suspect there's something in the air.

102
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:51,466
You know Madge

103
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,101
and her matchmaking proclivities.

104
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,502
Is she expecting me

105
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:55,437
for a weekend or a wedding?

106
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:58,106
You can't tell. You know how wives are.

107
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,308
No, I don't. How are they?

108
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:04,279
Wives? They always have a little scheme.

109
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:06,681
Look here, I think it's about time

110
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:07,782
you found out for yourself.

111
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:09,551
- You do?
- I certainly do.

112
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:10,585
No, thanks, Horace.

113
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:11,786
In me you see a youth

114
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,388
who's completely on the loose.

115
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:15,323
No yens, no yearning.

116
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:48,977
Hello. This is Miss Tremont.

117
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,644
I'd like to speak

118
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:50,945
to the manager immediately.

119
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:02,357
Hello. Are you there?

120
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,859
Who? The manager. Yes.

121
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:06,594
I can't hear a word you're saying.

122
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:08,997
There's a young lady downstairs.

123
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,833
A young lady. At this time of night?

124
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,568
She can't come up here now.

125
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,970
No, I'd better come down myself.

126
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,506
Jerry, go right ahead.

127
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,607
A young lady downstairs

128
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:20,775
evidently wants to see me.

129
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:13,695
Hello.

130
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:19,167
Won't you come in?

131
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:22,871
I'm awfully glad you dropped in.

132
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:24,439
I dropped up from the room below,

133
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:26,141
where I've been trying to get some sleep.

134
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,510
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,079
I didn't realize I was disturbing you.

136
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:33,281
You see, every once in a while,

137
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:34,582
I suddenly find myself...

138
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:36,785
dancing.

139
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,688
I suppose it's some kind of an affliction?

140
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:41,723
Yes, it's an affliction.

141
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:44,526
St. Vitus' dance.

142
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:47,095
And it only occurs at this time of night?

143
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:48,630
Yes, that's it.

144
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:50,398
It only occurs at this time of night.

145
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,767
As a matter of fact,

146
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:55,136
I really shouldn't be left alone.

147
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,538
Yes, I can see that.

148
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:57,639
You probably should have

149
00:12:57,672 --> 00:12:59,107
a couple of guards.

150
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:02,177
I think you're very unkind

151
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,011
to make fun of me.

152
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:04,846
I'm sorry.

153
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:09,317
- I wish you wouldn't leave.
- Why not?

154
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,153
I think I feel an attack coming on.

155
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,157
See, there it is.

156
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:20,628
So I see.

157
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:22,564
There's only one thing that'll stop me.

158
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:25,633
You must tell me what it is.

159
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:27,402
My nurses always

160
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:28,470
put their arms around me.

161
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:33,675
I'll call the house detective

162
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,510
and tell him to put his arms around you.

163
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:43,551
Good night.

164
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,680
What are you doing here?

165
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:12,847
What are you carrying that for?

166
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:14,849
- Who was the young lady?
- What young lady?

167
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:17,252
That call wasn't for me. It was for you.

168
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:18,653
Somebody has registered a complaint.

169
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:21,289
I know. I've just seen the complaint.

170
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:22,257
She's lovely, she's delightful,

171
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,026
she's charming, and she wants to sleep.

172
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,127
She does?

173
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:27,529
And I'm going to help her,

174
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:30,098
and you're going to help me. Take this.

175
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,400
No, bring it in here

176
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:33,535
and guard it with your life.

177
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:34,703
- What are you going to do?
- Never mind.

178
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:48,350
Look here, what's the idea?

179
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,618
The young lady downstairs wants to sleep.

180
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:51,353
So you told me.

181
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:53,788
I've appointed myself her official sandman.

182
00:14:55,357 --> 00:14:56,458
But, Jerry...

183
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:20,775
What else have you got?

184
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:22,110
I'm sorry, sir,

185
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:23,111
but you've cleaned out the shop.

186
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:25,213
You better tell them

187
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:26,281
to plant some more for tomorrow.

188
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,217
They are all to go

189
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,218
to Miss Dale Tremont, sir?

190
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:31,386
That's right.

191
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:35,957
Her room number is 304.

192
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,031
What's that?

193
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:44,632
That's for the opening

194
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,533
of a butcher shop, sir.

195
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:50,205
- Send that up, too.
- But, sir, a horseshoe?

196
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:52,173
Why, yes, I may want to order

197
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:53,475
a peach orchard tomorrow.

198
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,244
What's the number of your room, sir?

199
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:00,982
Just charge it to Horace Hardwick,

200
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,317
room 404.

201
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,951
Yes, sir.

202
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,123
I wonder what Mr. Beddini

203
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:09,224
is going to say about this.

204
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:10,625
What can he say?

205
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:13,561
He's been sending her flowers daily

206
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:14,696
ever since they came here.

207
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:18,433
And entre nous...

208
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:20,835
the desk clerk has intimated...

209
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,971
that Mr. Beddini provides Miss Tremont

210
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:24,706
with all the niceties...

211
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:27,175
including her clothes.

212
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,009
Really?

213
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,720
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

214
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,690
- I do hope you slept well last night.
- I slept well enough, but not long enough.

215
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,425
I'm sorry. I was hoping...

216
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,560
there was something I could do

217
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,628
to square myself.

218
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,129
That's quite all right.

219
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,964
I thought perhaps I could drive you

220
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:46,665
to the stables.

221
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,634
No, thank you. I have a hansom cab

222
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,668
waiting for me outside.

223
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,236
With a horse in front of it?

224
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,271
Yes. You see,

225
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,640
the stable people always use them.

226
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,042
They feel the horse is coming back.

227
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,644
Where's he been?

228
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,419
We're leaving tonight.

229
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:08,687
Has Mr. Beddini made arrangements?

230
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,588
Yes, Miss Tremont.

231
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,822
He's ordered your baggage

232
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,757
to be picked up at 7:00.

233
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:12,824
Thank you.

234
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,683
- Driver.
- Yes, miss?

235
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,419
Can't you go any faster than this?

236
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,155
Lord love a duck, miss. I can,

237
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,990
but I'm not allowed to leave the horse.

238
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,063
I meant the horse, of course.

239
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,099
It's like this, miss.

240
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,968
You see, the horse is
kind of tired today...

241
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,069
on account of having won

242
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,370
the Grand National on Friday.

243
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,838
Are you trying to tell me

244
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:01,606
that this is a racehorse?

245
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,209
Yes, miss, and I've got his pedigree, too.

246
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,444
As a matter of fact,

247
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,279
his sire was Man O'War.

248
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,682
Who was his dam?

249
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:15,187
- I beg your pardon, miss?
- I said, who was his dam?

250
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,456
I don't know, miss. He didn't give a...

251
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,413
Peekaboo.

252
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,015
Stop this cab at once.

253
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,217
I don't know how.

254
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,084
I've never handled anything

255
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,519
more complicated than a Duesenberg.

256
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,388
Take it easy, Mavis.

257
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,423
What are we going to do?

258
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,559
In dealing with a girl or horse,

259
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,496
one just lets nature take its course.

260
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:20,819
There we are, miss.

261
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,522
I told you the horse

262
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,690
would bring you to the right place.

263
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,925
What is this strange power

264
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,460
you have over horses?

265
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:30,329
Horsepower.

266
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,299
Don't I even get any thanks?

267
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,772
Buy yourself a new hat.

268
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:34,960
Cab, miss?

269
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,719
May I rescue you?

270
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,324
No, thank you, I prefer being in distress.

271
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,832
Charming little spot you have here.

272
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,968
When does the concert start?

273
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,272
Just as soon as you and the rain stop.

274
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,141
Now, please.

275
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,409
You wouldn't like to be

276
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,545
just a little bit more friendly, would you?

277
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:29,581
Why should I?

278
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,717
I don't know you from Adam.

279
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,220
Maybe it's the way I'm dressed.

280
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,260
Are you afraid of thunder?

281
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,931
No, it's just the noise.

282
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,434
You know what thunder is, don't you?

283
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:51,803
Of course.

284
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,842
It's something about the air.

285
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,180
No, when a clumsy cloud from here

286
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,716
meets a fluffy little cloud from there...

287
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,586
he billows towards her...

288
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,954
she scurries away

289
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,490
and he scuds right up to her.

290
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,458
She cries a little...

291
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,394
and there you have your shower.

292
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,829
He comforts her.

293
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,097
They spark.

294
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,099
That's the lightning.

295
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:23,568
They kiss.

296
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,204
Thunder.

297
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,640
Who is sending you this horse's shoe?

298
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,209
How cute.

299
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,310
Alberto, I've seen him.

300
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,711
I've talked to him. I've danced with him.

301
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,480
- Him? Who is this him?
- Who?

302
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,416
His name is Adam.

303
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,550
You forget this Adam.

304
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:08,020
You have promised to go with me to Italy.

305
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,187
Your friend Madge Hardwick

306
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:09,921
is awaiting you.

307
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,491
There, you will dazzle the eyes

308
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,394
in clothes designed by Alberto Beddini.

309
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,728
Alberto, I hope you don't mind,

310
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,030
but I'm not going to the Lido.

311
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,765
Madre mia. What you say?

312
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,166
My dear, listen to me.

313
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,167
We have made agreement.

314
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,869
Beddini designs the clothes...

315
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,270
which you wear among your friends,

316
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,305
the smart people.

317
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,139
So that they ask:

318
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,440
"Who is so smart

319
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,042
as to make these smart clothes?"

320
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:30,742
And you say,

321
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:33,745
"Who? Who is so smart? Beddini. "

322
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,281
Forget this Adam. Beddini demands it.

323
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,785
Beddini does, does he?

324
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,987
Alberto, up to the
present, our relationship

325
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,522
has been purely a business one.

326
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,023
But if you start interfering

327
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,291
in my personal affairs...

328
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,526
I'll go back to America

329
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,560
and live on the dole.

330
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,296
Now, Dale darling, I'm so sorry.

331
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,798
I did not mean to interfere.

332
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,233
Go ahead, fall in love with this Adam.

333
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:55,901
Marry him.

334
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,104
But, as Mrs. Adam, what would you wear?

335
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:00,973
Fig leaves.

336
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:11,483
Thank you, sir.

337
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,519
Dale, a telegram for you.

338
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:16,822
Read it to me, please.

339
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,025
"Come ahead, stop.

340
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,027
"Stop being a sap, stop.

341
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,530
"You can even bring Alberto, stop.

342
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,532
"My husband is stopping

343
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,867
at your hotel, stop.

344
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,069
"When do you start, stop. "

345
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,306
I cannot understand. Who wrote this?

346
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,875
Sounds like Gertrude Stein.

347
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,445
No, it's from Madge Hardwick.

348
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,281
She says her husband is stopping

349
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:44,116
at this hotel and will look you up.

350
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,120
Wonder what kind of man Madge married.

351
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,655
He's sure to have influence.

352
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:50,789
Let's be nice to him.

353
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,924
I'm going to be too busy

354
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,226
being nice to somebody else.

355
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,028
Dale, you can't do this.

356
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,130
All my life I have promised my dresses

357
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,331
to take them to Italy...

358
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,766
and you must be in them.

359
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,801
Sorry, Alberto, but I'm unpacking.

360
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,741
Never again will I allow

361
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,510
women to wear my dresses.

362
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,492
- Good evening, Miss Tremont.
- Good evening.

363
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,761
Mr. Beddini and I have decided to stay.

364
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,630
I'm so glad. Then I'll cancel the order

365
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,397
about the bags.

366
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,633
Thank you. Is there a Mr. Hardwick

367
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,068
stopping at this hotel?

368
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,002
Why, yes, Miss Tremont.

369
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,271
Mr. Hardwick has room 404.

370
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:40,706
Just above you.

371
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,611
- Are you sure?
- Definitely, miss.

372
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:48,947
As a matter of fact,

373
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,315
there's Mr. Hardwick now...

374
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,049
on the mezzanine.

375
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:51,850
The gentleman

376
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,218
with the briefcase and cane.

377
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:07,299
- Horace, here's a telegram for you.
- For me?

378
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,768
- It's from Italy.
- Italy? That's probably from Madge.

379
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,570
There's a message in your room

380
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,504
to call the box office.

381
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,138
Some trouble about the tickets

382
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:13,739
or something.

383
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,874
Trouble? With the tickets?

384
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,943
My word, Jerry. Why, they wouldn't dare.

385
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,878
Will you hold those things for me please?

386
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,546
Get a taxi and I'll meet you downstairs.

387
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,714
All right.

388
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:40,098
Cab, miss?

389
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,135
When a clumsy cloud meets

390
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,703
a fluffy little cloud.

391
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:54,613
We're only trying

392
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,881
to investigate matters, miss.

393
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,350
We must protect our guests.

394
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,085
She does not need your protection.

395
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,454
I am too much protection enough.

396
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:04,723
There's nothing to investigate.

397
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,959
Nothing matters, nothing's happened.

398
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:07,893
Will you please ask

399
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,094
these gentlemen to go?

400
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,029
You mean to tell me

401
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,397
that girl slapped your face...

402
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,932
in front of all those people for nothing?

403
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,901
What would you have done, sold tickets?

404
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,502
I mean, you did nothing,

405
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,670
and yet she slapped your face?

406
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,773
- Now you're getting it.
- I wish you'd be serious about this.

407
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,909
One breath of scandal at this time

408
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,876
will ruin our show.

409
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,378
Why, I'd rather have had it happen

410
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,279
to me than to you.

411
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,282
- If you enjoy that sort of thing.
- I do, immensely.

412
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:31,617
Don't be absurd.

413
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,686
I hate men. I hate you. I hate all men!

414
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,223
But cara mia, you make a big mistake.

415
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:39,391
I am no man.

416
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,293
I am Beddini.

417
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:44,963
How could he have made love to me

418
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,265
when he was married all the time?

419
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,867
And to Madge of all people.

420
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,337
So, this snake in the grass, this Adam...

421
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,039
already he has eaten the apple?

422
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:54,973
Yes.

423
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,746
I will kill him for you.

424
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:02,981
Have you finished packing?

425
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,951
But you do not understand.

426
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,588
Are we leaving or aren't we?

427
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,823
No, you cannot go back to America.

428
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:13,225
We must go to the Lido.

429
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,693
But I can't face his wife.

430
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,161
And why not?

431
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,363
Women are facing wives every day.

432
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:20,399
And, after all, you can't avoid seeing

433
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:21,733
Madge sometime, can you?

434
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,136
I guess not.

435
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,203
Very well then.

436
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,472
Why not face the musicians now?

437
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,910
All right. Maybe she ought to know.

438
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,479
You're sure

439
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,647
you didn't forget yourself in the park?

440
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:36,315
Positive.

441
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,050
If I ever forgot myself with that girl,

442
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:38,850
I'd remember it.

443
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:48,126
- We're the management.
- Are you?

444
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:50,495
Oh, dear. Some more

445
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,897
of these plural personalities.

446
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,767
Just a moment.

447
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,537
Jerry, get into my bedroom, quick.

448
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,738
No one must know you're here.

449
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,807
If they ever suspect that you're in this,

450
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,175
it'll be in every newspaper in an hour.

451
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,781
Well, gentlemen,

452
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:10,782
this is a pleasant surprise.

453
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,751
A small matter of great import

454
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,353
has come to our attention, sir.

455
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,421
I am up here in your interest

456
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,090
and to protect the hotel.

457
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,326
- We wish to avoid any scandal.
- Scandal?

458
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,194
Yes, in connection

459
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,996
with a certain slap in the face.

460
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:26,164
The young lady refuses to divulge

461
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,599
why she slapped you.

462
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,202
Well, she didn't slap my face.

463
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,238
Who did she slap?

464
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,774
Why, it was... Who?

465
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,510
It was he, my valet.

466
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,912
Me, sir?

467
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,182
Why, of course. Don't argue with me.

468
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:44,850
How did it happen?

469
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,588
Possibly we had been

470
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,924
a little imprudent, sir.

471
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:53,258
Of course. You see,

472
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,960
we had been a little imprudent.

473
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,495
But you said it wasn't you.

474
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,464
Not Mr. Hardwick.

475
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:04,569
Gentlemen, we take all the blame myself.

476
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,072
And there we are. There you are.

477
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,307
You see, it was just a mistake.

478
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,409
I'll take him to task personally.

479
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,377
- Thank you, sir.
- Not at all.

480
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,245
- Good night.
- Not at all.

481
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,346
- Good night.
- Good night.

482
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,886
Bates, thank you.

483
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,322
You know, really,

484
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,157
you are an invaluable assistant.

485
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,760
Thank you, sir. Allow us, sir.

486
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:29,761
Thank you, Bates.

487
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,031
- Your coat, sir.
- Really?

488
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,401
This is like old times, isn't it?

489
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:37,736
Your helping me with my coat, I mean.

490
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,539
It's a pleasure we have missed, sir.

491
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,641
- Thank you, Bates.
- Thank you, sir.

492
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,478
How is our lumbago this evening, sir?

493
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,781
- It's so much better, Bates, thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

494
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,285
- Bates.
- Yes, sir?

495
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,289
There's a crisis afoot.

496
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,458
Couldn't we bury the hatchet?

497
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,759
I mean, couldn't we forget

498
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,860
all about the ties?

499
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,565
Sic transit gloria mundi, sir.

500
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,001
- Bates.
- Yes, sir.

501
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,536
Mr. Travers is in trouble.

502
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,105
He's practically put his foot

503
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,873
right into a hornet's nest.

504
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:19,177
But, hornets' nests grow on trees, sir.

505
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:20,479
Never mind that.

506
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,214
We have got to do something.

507
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,916
What about rubbing it with butter, sir?

508
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,052
You blasted fool,

509
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,587
you can't rub a girl with butter!

510
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,555
My sister got into a hornets' nest

511
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:32,324
and we rubbed her with butter, sir.

512
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,226
That's the wrong treatment.

513
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,060
You should have used mud.

514
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:36,528
Never mind that!

515
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,664
Mr. Travers is in trouble.

516
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,365
It is liable to develop into a scandal

517
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,533
that will involve all of us.

518
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,103
There's a young lady in the room below us.

519
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:47,039
I've seen her, sir.

520
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,073
I want you to find out

521
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,241
all you can about her.

522
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,976
Follow her wherever she goes.

523
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,411
Never take your eyes off her.

524
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,046
- Never, sir?
- Never.

525
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,950
- Whither she goes...
- Thither I, sir.

526
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,555
Right you are, sir. Whither or thither.

527
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,297
- What happened?
- It's all right. I fixed it.

528
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,099
But things are getting involved.

529
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:15,467
This is a deep-laid plot.

530
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,669
Nonsense. Why should this girl want

531
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:18,570
to involve me?

532
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,372
Why, for money, of course. Publicity.

533
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,607
Anything to create a scandal.

534
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,142
I'm going to see her and buy her off.

535
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:25,544
You're not. If anyone's going to buy

536
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,678
her anything, I am going to do it.

537
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,246
No, you stay right here.

538
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,148
I'll clear this all up myself.

539
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:32,050
It's probably some little thing you did...

540
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,552
carried away for the moment,

541
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,520
that offended her sense of decorum.

542
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:37,289
If I did, I'm going right down

543
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,091
and do it again. Goodbye, old boy.

544
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,034
Come along, cara mia.

545
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,042
- Get me a taxi, quickly.
- Taxi.

546
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:01,046
Follow that cab.

547
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:03,282
Come in.

548
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,054
Where's the young lady

549
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:09,821
that has this room?

550
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,189
She's gone, sir.

551
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:12,891
- Gone?
- Yes, sir.

552
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,129
You don't mind if I get on with me work?

553
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,330
I gotta get these flowers out

554
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:19,231
in the morning's rubbish.

555
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,434
That's all right, go ahead. Go right ahead.

556
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,419
Jerry, do you realize that we have

557
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,820
less than an hour before the show opens?

558
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,255
We've got to get out of here. Come on.

559
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,682
Women do strange things sometimes,

560
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:11,683
don't they, George?

561
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:12,284
Yes, sir.

562
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,556
- That first act was simply marvelous.
- Good.

563
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:18,790
Everybody's crazy about it.

564
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:19,691
The critics are raving.

565
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:21,193
I've got some more good news.

566
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,762
- Did you find out were she's gone?
- She? Oh, that girl.

567
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,330
No, but, Jerry, please.

568
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:27,199
The entire Thackeray Club is out in front.

569
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,534
You don't suppose

570
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:30,669
my dancing has disturbed them?

571
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,604
I don't think so. They didn't say.

572
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:34,373
Of course not. It's
perfectly all right here.

573
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:36,341
Second act begins, Mr. Travers.

574
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,276
Thanks. I'll be there.

575
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,610
Really, the second act.

576
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:39,911
A lot of telegrams for you.

577
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:41,546
I'll be right back as
soon as the act is over.

578
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,148
My word, I never read

579
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,416
my own telegram from Madge.

580
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,485
Isn't it too bad she isn't here tonight?

581
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:47,486
The biggest night of my life

582
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,186
and she isn't here.

583
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,156
- What does she say?
- All kinds of good wishes for our success.

584
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:52,958
Sorry we can't fly down to Italy after

585
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,393
the performance to meet her friend.

586
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:56,128
Her little friend is in London,

587
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,129
staying at my hotel.

588
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:58,130
Her name is Tremont.

589
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:00,332
Tremont? Wait a minute. Let me see that.

590
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:03,902
Horace, hire a plane right away.

591
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:05,671
We're leaving for Italy in the morning.

592
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:06,939
One minute, Mr. Travers.

593
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:08,607
You can't do that. The seats were sold out

594
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,574
for months in advance.

595
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:10,676
How long does it take to fly there?

596
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:11,944
Seven hours. You have to be back

597
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:13,145
Monday for a performance.

598
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,213
Charter a plane for the weekend,

599
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,181
we'll be back in time.

600
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:17,149
You're on, Mr. Travers.

601
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:18,750
I will not jeopardize my position.

602
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,352
If you want this show to run two nights,

603
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,587
get me a plane now.

604
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,389
- What kind of a plane?
- One with wings.

605
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:51,650
I'll go look for Madge

606
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:53,018
and see you later for cocktails.

607
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,913
- Dale, when did you get down?
- Just now.

608
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,315
Good. Have something to drink.

609
00:46:29,722 --> 00:46:31,023
Horse's neck.

610
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:36,996
- It's grand seeing you.
- And it's grand seeing you.

611
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:38,330
Now tell me, did my husband look you up?

612
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,901
- Yes.
- How did he impress you?

613
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:47,072
I think he is very fascinating.

614
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,208
Fascinating?

615
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:50,876
You know, every once in a while, the effect

616
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:53,012
Horace has on people surprises me.

617
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,515
He sort of surprised me, too.

618
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:58,317
I'm glad you liked him.

619
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,652
He will be here today.

620
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,621
No. He can't...

621
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:06,492
What's the matter? Did he flirt with you?

622
00:47:08,694 --> 00:47:10,562
He sent me a room full of flowers.

623
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,731
That was sweet of him.

624
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:16,869
But, Madge, you don't understand, he...

625
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:22,274
- He chased me in the park.
- Really?

626
00:47:22,308 --> 00:47:22,975
I didn't know

627
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:25,144
Horace was capable of that much activity.

628
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:26,545
Did he catch you?

629
00:47:29,248 --> 00:47:31,550
- Yes.
- Good for Horace.

630
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:35,321
Why, Madge, you shock me.

631
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:36,455
Horace flirts with

632
00:47:36,488 --> 00:47:37,589
every attractive girl he meets.

633
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:38,824
He doesn't mean anything.

634
00:47:44,063 --> 00:47:45,531
That's a funny way to take it.

635
00:47:46,498 --> 00:47:48,133
My dear, when you are as old as I am,

636
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:49,635
you'll take your men as you find them.

637
00:47:50,502 --> 00:47:51,904
If you can find them.

638
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:06,685
And another thing, Jerry.

639
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:07,820
The gossip at the hotel

640
00:48:07,853 --> 00:48:08,854
was that this man, Beddini...

641
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,122
was supplying her with everything.

642
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:11,757
Money, clothes, flowers.

643
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:14,994
No, Horace, you provided the flowers.

644
00:48:15,027 --> 00:48:16,362
I? I never did anything.

645
00:48:16,395 --> 00:48:18,564
I didn't even know her.
Don't be ridiculous.

646
00:48:18,597 --> 00:48:20,032
But anyway, as soon as we land,

647
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:21,133
I'm going to see Madge...

648
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,368
and I am going to find out from her

649
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:24,370
just who and what this Tremont person is.

650
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:27,039
I only want to find out where.

651
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:28,607
Now, Jerry, I warn you...

652
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:30,409
you don't realize the trouble

653
00:48:30,442 --> 00:48:32,311
a designing woman can make for a man.

654
00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:33,946
Now, I know all about these things.

655
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:35,547
I wouldn't tell this to anybody.

656
00:48:39,151 --> 00:48:40,019
I am the victim

657
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:41,587
of a designing woman myself.

658
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:45,157
- Surely you don't mean Madge?
- Why, certainly, who else?

659
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:46,959
Not Madge. She doesn't know

660
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:47,926
anything about it either.

661
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:50,029
Her name is Violet.

662
00:48:50,062 --> 00:48:52,865
She is what the French call a passade.

663
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:57,069
I see. Little ships that pass in the night.

664
00:48:57,102 --> 00:49:00,372
Ships? Yes. Exactly.

665
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,142
I met her at the birdhouse in the zoo.

666
00:49:03,175 --> 00:49:04,610
She was a very pretty little thing

667
00:49:04,643 --> 00:49:06,712
and she seemed to be quite frightened.

668
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:08,113
Of the birds?

669
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:09,248
Yes. You see,

670
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:11,483
she had led a very sheltered life.

671
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:13,052
It was the storks in particular

672
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:13,886
that worried her.

673
00:49:14,987 --> 00:49:16,655
I took her to a cinema...

674
00:49:16,689 --> 00:49:17,723
and then we had dinner

675
00:49:17,756 --> 00:49:19,091
and then I took her to another cinema.

676
00:49:19,992 --> 00:49:20,960
Then I fear

677
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:22,828
I forgot myself and let her kiss me.

678
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:42,147
That must be his plane now. Come on.

679
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:45,818
No, I'd rather not.

680
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:47,886
Come on. If I were you...

681
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,288
I wouldn't miss this opportunity

682
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:51,490
of seeing the early worm get the bird.

683
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:01,233
You know, Dale, I haven't told you

684
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:02,635
the real reason I asked you down here.

685
00:50:04,036 --> 00:50:04,837
Haven't you?

686
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,606
No, I feel I've known you long enough

687
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,408
to have the right to talk to you this way.

688
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:11,477
In spite of the fact that

689
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,013
all men are males...

690
00:50:14,046 --> 00:50:15,914
there is no feeling so secure as having

691
00:50:15,948 --> 00:50:19,351
a good, reliable husband. I know.

692
00:50:39,338 --> 00:50:40,773
- Jerry.
- Hello, Madge, I'll see you in a minute.

693
00:50:46,178 --> 00:50:47,413
Where did Miss Tremont go?

694
00:50:48,147 --> 00:50:50,849
- Dale didn't tell me she'd met you.
- Yes, we've met.

695
00:50:50,883 --> 00:50:52,117
Fine, I've arranged

696
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:53,585
a little dinner party for all of us.

697
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:54,553
Let's eat now.

698
00:50:54,586 --> 00:50:56,121
Leave the child alone,

699
00:50:56,155 --> 00:50:57,589
she's a little upset about something.

700
00:50:57,623 --> 00:51:00,559
- Really?
- Yes. Tell me, how did Dale strike you?

701
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:04,563
- Right between the eyes.
- Good.

702
00:51:05,531 --> 00:51:08,701
- Where's Horace?
- I left him struggling with the baggage.

703
00:51:08,734 --> 00:51:10,235
The hotel's crowded and both of you

704
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:12,271
will have to bunk together tonight.

705
00:51:12,304 --> 00:51:13,105
Dale's with me.

706
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:16,342
- Did you get that room for my husband?
- Si, signora, but I am so sorry...

707
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,576
because of the carnival,

708
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,545
the only thing available
is the bridal suite.

709
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:24,016
- The bridal suite.
- How romantic. Thank you.

710
00:51:26,919 --> 00:51:29,121
Signor, are you Horace Hardwick?

711
00:51:29,922 --> 00:51:31,690
Thank you, I am. How do you do?

712
00:51:32,324 --> 00:51:34,593
- I am very displeased to meet you.
- Really?

713
00:51:36,195 --> 00:51:37,429
What do you mean, displeased?

714
00:51:37,463 --> 00:51:38,864
Signor, I warn you.

715
00:51:38,897 --> 00:51:40,499
For men of your kind,

716
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,935
this is not a healthy place.

717
00:51:42,968 --> 00:51:44,169
My dear fellow, this is one

718
00:51:44,203 --> 00:51:45,237
of the healthiest spots in Europe.

719
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:46,872
The air, the breeze, the flowers.

720
00:51:48,574 --> 00:51:50,242
So it is funny tricks you're being.

721
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:51,310
I warn you...

722
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,412
never let your path

723
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:57,316
criss-cross mine again, or the heart...

724
00:52:10,596 --> 00:52:12,564
- Horace.
- How do you do?

725
00:52:12,598 --> 00:52:15,834
Madge, darling.

726
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:18,904
My, your passion frightens me.

727
00:52:18,938 --> 00:52:23,309
- Been practicing?
- Yes. Well, scarcely. No.

728
00:52:23,342 --> 00:52:24,677
Madge, what do you think

729
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,444
has happened to me?

730
00:52:26,412 --> 00:52:30,149
- I know. You got your first long trousers.
- Madge, please.

731
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:30,916
There's something down here

732
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,084
that I have to investigate...

733
00:52:32,117 --> 00:52:33,118
and Jerry thinks that I...

734
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:35,054
Maybe I better tell it anonymously.

735
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:36,789
You know, it sounds as if you were

736
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:38,390
about to confess something, Horace.

737
00:52:38,424 --> 00:52:41,093
Does it? What would I have to confess?

738
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:42,995
You really want to tell me

739
00:52:43,028 --> 00:52:44,463
about Dale Tremont, don't you?

740
00:52:44,496 --> 00:52:46,932
Yes, but then again, no.

741
00:52:47,466 --> 00:52:48,434
You see, as a matter of fact,

742
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:49,602
I haven't even met her yet.

743
00:52:49,635 --> 00:52:51,370
- You haven't met her?
- No.

744
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:54,139
If that's your story,
Horace, you stick to it.

745
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:57,109
I suppose you weren't in the park, either.

746
00:52:57,142 --> 00:52:58,377
The park, my dear girl,

747
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,012
it happened in the zoo. What?

748
00:53:00,045 --> 00:53:02,181
The zoo... Yes. The zoo was in the park.

749
00:53:02,214 --> 00:53:03,549
How did you know I was there?

750
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:07,152
- A little bird told me.
- The stork?

751
00:53:08,487 --> 00:53:10,990
I think, after the trip
I better clean up a bit.

752
00:53:11,023 --> 00:53:13,459
- Of course, I understand just
how you feel. - Yes.

753
00:53:32,111 --> 00:53:34,413
- What's the matter?
- It's Madge.

754
00:53:34,446 --> 00:53:36,048
- Has she been chasing you?
- No.

755
00:53:39,518 --> 00:53:41,287
Jerry, I think she's
found out about Violet.

756
00:53:42,021 --> 00:53:43,656
And I just had my life threatened.

757
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,292
But what did he say?

758
00:53:46,325 --> 00:53:48,460
He just lied in a straightforward manner,

759
00:53:48,494 --> 00:53:49,862
and said he'd never met you.

760
00:53:52,631 --> 00:53:55,567
- He did, did he?
- I told you he'd forget all about you.

761
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:00,572
I'll make him remember me

762
00:54:00,606 --> 00:54:02,308
in a manner he'll never forget.

763
00:54:04,977 --> 00:54:06,445
Has Horace been away from you lately

764
00:54:06,478 --> 00:54:07,379
for any length of time?

765
00:54:07,413 --> 00:54:08,247
Well, he was alone

766
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,415
on the Continent last year.

767
00:54:13,185 --> 00:54:15,387
Connect me with Mr.
Hardwick's apartment, please.

768
00:54:16,689 --> 00:54:17,356
Madge, have you any objections

769
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:18,457
if I scare your husband...

770
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:19,959
so that he'll never look at another woman?

771
00:54:19,992 --> 00:54:21,660
Dale, no husband

772
00:54:21,694 --> 00:54:23,629
is ever too scared to look.

773
00:54:25,631 --> 00:54:26,231
Hello.

774
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:32,237
Hello, where are you?

775
00:54:32,271 --> 00:54:34,073
So you do remember me?

776
00:54:35,307 --> 00:54:36,742
He remembers me all right.

777
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:42,247
- Are you alone?
- Completely and desolately.

778
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:44,216
Fine. I'll be right up.

779
00:54:55,461 --> 00:54:56,595
Horace, she's coming up.

780
00:54:57,496 --> 00:54:58,230
She's coming up here?

781
00:54:58,264 --> 00:54:59,932
She can't do that. It isn't proper.

782
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:02,668
- She wants to see me alone.
- Alone? Jerry.

783
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:04,103
What did I tell you?

784
00:55:04,136 --> 00:55:05,304
She wants to compromise you.

785
00:55:05,337 --> 00:55:07,039
Rack your brains, please.

786
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:07,906
Couldn't you have met

787
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,208
that girl someplace else before?

788
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,278
I could have met her in Moscow.

789
00:55:13,545 --> 00:55:17,249
- In Moscow. You see?
- But I've never been to Moscow.

790
00:55:19,418 --> 00:55:20,786
Couldn't you have met her in Paris?

791
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,021
The last time I was in Paris,

792
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:23,055
I was 10 years old.

793
00:55:23,756 --> 00:55:26,158
Jerry, I don't think it's safe

794
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:27,426
for you to see that girl alone.

795
00:55:28,827 --> 00:55:30,062
I don't think it would be quite proper

796
00:55:30,095 --> 00:55:31,463
for you to receive her that way.

797
00:55:45,477 --> 00:55:46,211
Hello.

798
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:47,913
I know you'll think this is

799
00:55:47,947 --> 00:55:49,882
a little unconventional of me...

800
00:55:49,915 --> 00:55:54,353
but I just couldn't wait to see you alone.

801
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:03,929
I'm awfully glad you came up.

802
00:56:05,898 --> 00:56:07,132
My darling.

803
00:56:10,603 --> 00:56:12,571
Hello. How have you been?

804
00:56:14,173 --> 00:56:15,941
I've been missing you terribly.

805
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,143
I came down

806
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:19,545
on the fastest plane I could get.

807
00:56:20,779 --> 00:56:23,682
No, I meant before yesterday.

808
00:56:25,384 --> 00:56:29,321
- Before yesterday?
- Yes, of course.

809
00:56:30,656 --> 00:56:31,557
Don't you remember?

810
00:56:35,027 --> 00:56:35,728
Should I?

811
00:56:37,529 --> 00:56:38,163
Have you forgotten...

812
00:56:38,197 --> 00:56:42,968
- what we've been to each other?
- No.

813
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,705
What we've been to each other...

814
00:56:49,308 --> 00:56:51,010
I knew yesterday in the park,

815
00:56:51,043 --> 00:56:52,544
when I was dancing in your arms...

816
00:56:52,578 --> 00:56:55,748
- you remembered who I was.
- Of course.

817
00:56:57,449 --> 00:56:58,217
Who are you?

818
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:02,955
Then you still don't remember?

819
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:08,427
I can try to remember something.

820
00:57:10,796 --> 00:57:11,997
How could you forget

821
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:13,299
that funny little house...

822
00:57:14,566 --> 00:57:16,368
and the suspicious concierge...

823
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,939
and that quaint little room?

824
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:24,076
We used to have tea and muffins

825
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:25,210
in front of the fireplace...

826
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:26,512
watching the

827
00:57:26,545 --> 00:57:28,213
shadows leaping on the ceiling.

828
00:57:30,015 --> 00:57:31,417
And those long walks down that

829
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:33,352
twisty cobblestone street to the river.

830
00:57:36,155 --> 00:57:38,490
Paris is heavenly in the spring.

831
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,001
So that's where we met.

832
00:57:50,169 --> 00:57:51,136
Yes, last year.

833
00:57:54,173 --> 00:57:55,107
In Paris.

834
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:01,747
Why, of course.

835
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,452
It's all coming back to me now.

836
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:08,253
Is it?

837
00:58:09,054 --> 00:58:10,789
Yes, but you weren't calling
yourself Dale Tremont.

838
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:14,426
- Wasn't I?
- No, it was...

839
00:58:17,896 --> 00:58:19,632
Madeline, that was it.

840
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:21,800
I called you Mad for short.

841
00:58:23,602 --> 00:58:24,937
You've put on a little weight, haven't you?

842
00:58:29,275 --> 00:58:30,609
Remember that night on the Left Bank...

843
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,845
you had on that little blue dress

844
00:58:32,878 --> 00:58:33,946
I bought for you?

845
00:58:37,016 --> 00:58:39,351
And to think that I almost forgot you...

846
00:58:42,688 --> 00:58:43,656
Tell me something.

847
00:58:46,825 --> 00:58:48,694
Do you still have that awful weakness

848
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:50,329
for diamond bracelets?

849
00:58:53,832 --> 00:58:55,167
I suppose I do.

850
00:58:56,902 --> 00:58:58,304
Make yourself comfortable, darling.

851
00:58:59,104 --> 00:58:59,972
I'll order some cocktails.

852
00:59:00,005 --> 00:59:00,606
A little later on,

853
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:02,541
we'll have supper up here, just we two.

854
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:06,178
It'll be like old times, won't it?

855
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,114
I think I'd better be going.

856
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:11,483
I'll let you go on one condition.

857
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:13,953
Promise me, now that I found you again...

858
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:15,688
we can be to each other

859
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:18,490
what we were in Paris.

860
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:32,671
There, you see? I was right.

861
00:59:32,705 --> 00:59:34,740
Of all the scheming, brazen creatures...

862
00:59:34,773 --> 00:59:35,708
trying to pretend

863
00:59:35,741 --> 00:59:36,642
that she met you in Paris.

864
00:59:36,675 --> 00:59:37,576
Do you realize that she's

865
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:38,911
deliberately trying to trap you?

866
00:59:38,944 --> 00:59:41,513
- What are you going to do about it?
- Marry her.

867
00:59:41,547 --> 00:59:43,749
Jerry, this is no time for you to be funny.

868
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,451
All right, then, you be funny.

869
00:59:45,484 --> 00:59:45,985
I'm going down

870
00:59:46,018 --> 00:59:47,319
and ask her to marry me right now.

871
00:59:47,353 --> 00:59:48,687
Jerry, please wait.

872
00:59:48,721 --> 00:59:50,289
Now, before you make

873
00:59:50,322 --> 00:59:51,257
a complete fool of yourself...

874
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:53,225
promise me that you won't ask her...

875
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:54,627
until I find out from Madge

876
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,594
more about her past.

877
00:59:55,628 --> 00:59:57,229
All right, you find out
all about her past...

878
00:59:57,263 --> 00:59:58,864
and I'll go down and plan her future.

879
00:59:58,897 --> 01:00:03,402
- Remember, that's a promise.
- All right, it's a promise.

880
01:00:11,844 --> 01:00:14,113
What happened? Did you scare him?

881
01:00:15,114 --> 01:00:18,417
No. He scared me.

882
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:21,620
What did he do, make faces at you?

883
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:25,157
You know, sometimes

884
01:00:25,224 --> 01:00:25,958
I get up in the morning...

885
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:27,226
and I take a good look at him

886
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:28,661
and he frightens me, too.

887
01:00:29,461 --> 01:00:30,796
He mistook me for someone called

888
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:32,765
Madeline he'd met in Paris.

889
01:00:33,966 --> 01:00:34,566
Really?

890
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,502
Madge, do you think you ought

891
01:00:36,535 --> 01:00:37,703
to let him go away from you alone?

892
01:00:38,837 --> 01:00:40,039
I don't believe he was nearly so innocent

893
01:00:40,072 --> 01:00:41,106
in Paris as you seem to think.

894
01:00:42,441 --> 01:00:43,409
Darling, you interest me.

895
01:00:43,442 --> 01:00:45,411
I must send him to China next year.

896
01:00:45,444 --> 01:00:46,278
But, Madge,

897
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:47,446
you don't seem to understand.

898
01:00:47,479 --> 01:00:49,315
I'm trying to tell you that I'm afraid...

899
01:00:49,348 --> 01:00:53,285
that we're carrying this thing too far.

900
01:00:56,555 --> 01:00:59,058
You know, I wonder if you've seen

901
01:00:59,091 --> 01:01:00,025
something in Horace...

902
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:01,160
that I've never seen.

903
01:01:41,934 --> 01:01:43,702
I wonder what's keeping Horace.

904
01:01:49,942 --> 01:01:50,843
What's the matter?

905
01:01:52,811 --> 01:01:54,179
I'm afraid I'm going to have a headache.

906
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:55,281
Don't go. This is a meeting

907
01:01:55,314 --> 01:01:56,582
I've been planning a long time.

908
01:02:02,388 --> 01:02:03,022
Good evening.

909
01:02:04,957 --> 01:02:06,558
It's nice to see you again, Miss Tremont.

910
01:02:09,628 --> 01:02:10,829
You've robbed me of the pleasure

911
01:02:10,863 --> 01:02:11,830
of introducing you two.

912
01:02:11,864 --> 01:02:12,932
You've already met.

913
01:02:14,733 --> 01:02:17,036
Yes, we've met last spring.

914
01:02:19,939 --> 01:02:21,273
I hope you see a lot of each other.

915
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,009
You know, Madge is

916
01:02:24,043 --> 01:02:25,110
the most understanding person.

917
01:02:25,144 --> 01:02:26,545
She seems to know instinctively

918
01:02:26,578 --> 01:02:27,846
the kind of girl that interests me.

919
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,117
I don't know what I'd do without her.

920
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:33,719
That's sweet of you, darling.

921
01:02:33,752 --> 01:02:34,853
You two run along and dance,

922
01:02:34,887 --> 01:02:35,988
and don't give me another thought.

923
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:41,126
That's what I'm afraid of.

924
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:51,003
I think Madge is a very brave person.

925
01:02:51,904 --> 01:02:52,371
Yes, I have

926
01:02:52,404 --> 01:02:53,906
a tremendous admiration for her.

927
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:10,689
Well, if Madge doesn't care,

928
01:03:10,723 --> 01:03:11,757
I certainly don't.

929
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,893
Neither do I, all I know is that it's...

930
01:08:39,552 --> 01:08:40,152
Why don't you tell me

931
01:08:40,186 --> 01:08:41,220
what this is all about?

932
01:08:41,654 --> 01:08:43,389
You know we never met in Paris.

933
01:08:44,657 --> 01:08:46,826
I know. I'm afraid

934
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,494
I haven't been quite fair with you.

935
01:08:49,695 --> 01:08:50,997
You see, I know who you are.

936
01:08:52,999 --> 01:08:54,266
What difference does that make?

937
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:59,205
- So that doesn't make any difference?
- No, why should it?

938
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:01,440
I don't know who you are, and I don't care.

939
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:03,709
That's big of you.

940
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:07,446
Well...

941
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:10,783
Well, what?

942
01:09:11,651 --> 01:09:12,652
Aren't you now supposed to say...

943
01:09:13,552 --> 01:09:14,053
we should think

944
01:09:14,086 --> 01:09:15,388
only of what we mean to each other...

945
01:09:15,421 --> 01:09:17,923
that we're entitled to live our own lives?

946
01:09:19,892 --> 01:09:21,427
I don't think I'd say it

947
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,929
that way exactly, but aren't we?

948
01:09:26,499 --> 01:09:27,099
Go on.

949
01:09:28,901 --> 01:09:30,603
If it weren't for a promise I made

950
01:09:30,636 --> 01:09:31,470
in a moment of weakness...

951
01:09:31,504 --> 01:09:32,571
I would go on.

952
01:09:34,407 --> 01:09:35,441
You made a promise.

953
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:37,310
That shouldn't make

954
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:38,377
much difference to you.

955
01:09:41,047 --> 01:09:44,283
That's right. Forget it, marry me.

956
01:09:47,453 --> 01:09:48,888
How could I have fallen in love

957
01:09:48,921 --> 01:09:51,057
with anyone as low as you?

958
01:09:58,597 --> 01:09:59,665
She loves me.

959
01:10:05,605 --> 01:10:07,607
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

960
01:10:08,374 --> 01:10:09,709
I'm leaving. You don't know

961
01:10:09,742 --> 01:10:10,876
what a mess we've got into.

962
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:11,677
Why, what's the matter?

963
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:14,146
Your husband.

964
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:20,453
- He wants to divorce you and marry me.
- I see.

965
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,355
He wants to do right by both of us.

966
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:24,323
Did he mention any settlement?

967
01:10:24,924 --> 01:10:25,257
No.

968
01:10:26,392 --> 01:10:27,226
That'll come later.

969
01:10:27,259 --> 01:10:28,327
He'll probably want me

970
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:29,395
to pay myself alimony.

971
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:32,365
Now listen, Dale. I don't want you to go.

972
01:10:32,398 --> 01:10:33,899
That won't solve anything.

973
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:37,036
I can't stay here under the circumstances.

974
01:10:37,069 --> 01:10:38,037
Here or there,

975
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,438
as long as you remain a spinster...

976
01:10:39,472 --> 01:10:41,574
you're fair game for any philandering male.

977
01:10:41,607 --> 01:10:45,111
You know, what you really should have...

978
01:10:45,144 --> 01:10:46,812
is a husband you can call your own.

979
01:10:49,682 --> 01:10:50,950
Seriously, I mean it.

980
01:10:52,918 --> 01:10:53,686
But what are we going to do

981
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:54,587
about your husband?

982
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,522
Don't worry, dear. I'll do it.

983
01:11:03,863 --> 01:11:04,363
Come in.

984
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:08,868
Darling.

985
01:11:19,378 --> 01:11:22,348
All I said was darling and she smacked me.

986
01:11:25,351 --> 01:11:27,653
Jerry, how does it look? Tell me frankly.

987
01:11:27,687 --> 01:11:30,690
It looks like a sunrise
by Maxfield Parrish.

988
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:34,060
Jerry, that's terrible.

989
01:11:35,127 --> 01:11:36,696
I can't go around now like this.

990
01:11:37,897 --> 01:11:39,165
Put a piece of raw steak on it.

991
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:40,232
That'll take the swelling down.

992
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:41,334
It would?

993
01:11:42,535 --> 01:11:44,236
- A steak?
- Sure.

994
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:49,842
Yes, sir.

995
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:54,413
- Order a steak.
- A steak. Very good, sir.

996
01:11:56,248 --> 01:11:57,516
You know, Jerry, I can't imagine

997
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,018
what's got into Madge recently.

998
01:11:59,051 --> 01:12:00,486
She's never hit me before.

999
01:12:01,287 --> 01:12:03,022
Maybe she just never thought of it before.

1000
01:12:06,592 --> 01:12:07,326
Room service.

1001
01:12:08,227 --> 01:12:10,363
Yes. This is the bridal suite.

1002
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:12,264
Yes, will you please send up

1003
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:13,933
a nice, juicy steak?

1004
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,468
I beg your pardon?

1005
01:12:16,769 --> 01:12:20,306
Yes, mashed potatoes, and carrots...

1006
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,877
and spinach. Yes, of course, coffee...

1007
01:12:30,616 --> 01:12:31,851
As soon as you get your eye fixed,

1008
01:12:31,884 --> 01:12:32,918
we'll go down and see Madge.

1009
01:12:34,453 --> 01:12:35,521
Where do you want it, sir?

1010
01:12:36,188 --> 01:12:38,491
- Want what, Bates?
- The steak, sir.

1011
01:12:38,524 --> 01:12:40,092
On my eye.

1012
01:12:41,994 --> 01:12:43,829
On your eye, sir?

1013
01:12:44,864 --> 01:12:46,399
My word, why do I always

1014
01:12:46,432 --> 01:12:47,767
have to say things twice?

1015
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,902
On my eye means on my eye, doesn't it?

1016
01:12:49,936 --> 01:12:51,470
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Don't argue!

1017
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,708
Jerry, you see what I'm up against.

1018
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:57,243
The man has a sluggish brain,

1019
01:12:57,276 --> 01:12:58,477
always wants to debate things.

1020
01:12:59,545 --> 01:13:01,180
First it's a maniac, and then it's Madge,

1021
01:13:01,213 --> 01:13:02,014
and now it's Bates.

1022
01:13:02,048 --> 01:13:02,815
I give you my word,

1023
01:13:02,848 --> 01:13:04,717
if anything else happens, I'll go insane.

1024
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:36,711
We are a grand success.

1025
01:13:36,744 --> 01:13:38,807
Every woman, she's saying this dress,

1026
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:39,739
she's wonderful.

1027
01:13:39,773 --> 01:13:41,669
This Beddini is the tops.

1028
01:13:42,469 --> 01:13:43,267
I'm so happy.

1029
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:48,626
No, but, cara mia, it's not the dress,

1030
01:13:48,662 --> 01:13:49,592
it's not Beddini.

1031
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:51,756
It's you who wears it.

1032
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,118
Thank you, Alberto.

1033
01:13:57,749 --> 01:14:00,311
What is it? Is it Adam again?

1034
01:14:01,211 --> 01:14:02,375
His Garden of Eden...

1035
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:05,270
he has made you sad?

1036
01:14:09,099 --> 01:14:10,961
It's just that I'm all
mixed up, that's all.

1037
01:14:10,997 --> 01:14:13,559
Why worry about this man?

1038
01:14:15,124 --> 01:14:17,453
I think I'm worrying more about his wife.

1039
01:14:21,182 --> 01:14:23,777
Beddini does not like to see you so sad.

1040
01:14:27,473 --> 01:14:28,903
Alberto, you seem to be

1041
01:14:28,938 --> 01:14:30,735
the only one left I can turn to.

1042
01:14:35,562 --> 01:14:36,893
Why don't you marry Beddini?

1043
01:14:37,926 --> 01:14:38,691
He'll make you happy.

1044
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:44,182
Why not? I'm rich, I'm pretty...

1045
01:14:45,115 --> 01:14:46,313
and then this Hardwick

1046
01:14:46,347 --> 01:14:47,411
will leave you alone.

1047
01:14:52,805 --> 01:14:54,235
I'll marry you if you really want me to...

1048
01:14:56,067 --> 01:14:57,264
but let's do it right away.

1049
01:15:09,149 --> 01:15:09,647
First of all,

1050
01:15:09,681 --> 01:15:10,945
we'll get you straightened out...

1051
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,744
and then I'll ask Madge about Dale.

1052
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,605
Mr. Hardwick, dear sir, one of our

1053
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,603
guests has informed us...

1054
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:17,735
that he is to be married this evening.

1055
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:18,268
We wondered

1056
01:15:18,303 --> 01:15:19,733
if you would give up your bridal suite.

1057
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:23,928
- Give it up? Why we...
- We've hardly settled in it yet.

1058
01:15:23,961 --> 01:15:27,456
- Have we, angel?
- No, and all our clothes are... Please.

1059
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,886
- Of course you may have it.
- Thank you, sir.

1060
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,949
I shall remove you elsewhere.

1061
01:15:33,249 --> 01:15:35,079
Come on, dear sir, brace up.

1062
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:36,576
Madge has merely heard something

1063
01:15:36,611 --> 01:15:37,841
about this Violet girl.

1064
01:15:37,876 --> 01:15:39,272
We know it isn't the truth,

1065
01:15:39,306 --> 01:15:40,337
you tell her yourself...

1066
01:15:40,372 --> 01:15:41,369
that's all she's waiting for.

1067
01:15:41,404 --> 01:15:42,833
I know. That's what I'm afraid of.

1068
01:15:42,869 --> 01:15:44,998
Always remember that the truth

1069
01:15:45,032 --> 01:15:46,595
has never hurt any man.

1070
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:49,359
Jerry, you are right.

1071
01:15:53,986 --> 01:15:54,950
Anyway, if it does,

1072
01:15:54,985 --> 01:15:56,349
I'll go to the hospital with you.

1073
01:16:00,677 --> 01:16:03,106
Horace, what is this, Halloween?

1074
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:06,269
Madge, Horace has

1075
01:16:06,303 --> 01:16:07,567
a little confession to make.

1076
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,495
I've been waiting for this for some time.

1077
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:12,227
Come right in and get it off your chest.

1078
01:16:15,523 --> 01:16:17,220
You'd better take your glasses off.

1079
01:16:22,413 --> 01:16:23,078
Sit down.

1080
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:39,722
You see, when Horace was in London,

1081
01:16:39,755 --> 01:16:40,953
he met a certain young lady.

1082
01:16:40,987 --> 01:16:42,251
And, Madge, you must have

1083
01:16:42,286 --> 01:16:43,517
had an inkling of this or...

1084
01:16:44,282 --> 01:16:48,609
- Or you wouldn't be telling me now.
- Never. What? Certainly.

1085
01:16:49,642 --> 01:16:50,639
What Horace means to say is...

1086
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:51,538
that he'd like to make

1087
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,069
a clean breast of the whole thing.

1088
01:16:53,103 --> 01:16:58,195
- Before I find out the truth.
- Exactly. Madge, this girl was... What?

1089
01:16:58,929 --> 01:17:00,925
Dear, I'm all mixed. Where am I?

1090
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:10,646
- Hello.
- Madge, darling...

1091
01:17:11,478 --> 01:17:12,309
I wanted to call you

1092
01:17:12,343 --> 01:17:13,940
and tell you I just got married.

1093
01:17:14,607 --> 01:17:15,205
You got what?

1094
01:17:16,038 --> 01:17:17,269
I'm sorry, dear, I can't hear you.

1095
01:17:17,303 --> 01:17:18,168
It sounds just as if you said

1096
01:17:18,202 --> 01:17:18,933
you got married.

1097
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:23,161
- I did.
- Where are you now?

1098
01:17:24,261 --> 01:17:25,425
Going to the bridal suite?

1099
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:27,521
Very proper place

1100
01:17:27,556 --> 01:17:28,586
for a bride and groom, isn't it?

1101
01:17:28,622 --> 01:17:30,484
Darling, I must compliment you

1102
01:17:30,519 --> 01:17:31,482
on your speedy work...

1103
01:17:31,517 --> 01:17:32,480
but who on earth did you find

1104
01:17:32,516 --> 01:17:33,579
to marry you so quickly?

1105
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:38,241
Alberto? You'd better hang up, Dale, dear.

1106
01:17:38,275 --> 01:17:40,971
- I think I'm going to faint.
- Dale.

1107
01:17:41,669 --> 01:17:42,467
What was that?

1108
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,030
- Dale Tremont married?
- Yes, to that dressmaker.

1109
01:17:46,064 --> 01:17:48,793
- Good.
- Good? What did you have to do with this?

1110
01:17:48,826 --> 01:17:50,590
- It's all his fault.
- My fault?

1111
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,254
Yes, she told me how you chased her

1112
01:17:52,287 --> 01:17:53,784
in the park and she slapped your face.

1113
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:57,346
Yes, but I'm the one she slapped.

1114
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,073
She's been mistaking me

1115
01:18:02,108 --> 01:18:03,738
for Horace all this time.

1116
01:18:05,137 --> 01:18:06,002
No wonder she thought

1117
01:18:06,035 --> 01:18:07,099
Horace was fascinating.

1118
01:18:07,134 --> 01:18:09,563
No wonder. I resent that.

1119
01:18:10,795 --> 01:18:13,790
- Madge, where is she now?
- On her way to the bridal suite.

1120
01:18:13,825 --> 01:18:15,254
Bridal suite.

1121
01:18:21,381 --> 01:18:21,945
I'll see you later.

1122
01:18:22,646 --> 01:18:24,376
But, Jerry, you can't do a thing like that.

1123
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:25,140
It isn't fair.

1124
01:18:25,175 --> 01:18:26,571
All is fair in love and war,

1125
01:18:26,607 --> 01:18:28,070
and this is revolution.

1126
01:18:32,732 --> 01:18:35,094
- Yes, this is very pretty.
- Thank you, dear sir.

1127
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,359
We are very proud

1128
01:18:36,393 --> 01:18:37,524
of our bridal arrangements.

1129
01:18:37,558 --> 01:18:38,722
Is there anything else, sir?

1130
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:41,052
Yes, would you please ask my wife

1131
01:18:41,087 --> 01:18:41,952
to join me here?

1132
01:18:41,986 --> 01:18:43,449
It is a pleasure, dear sir.

1133
01:19:08,582 --> 01:19:09,546
What are you doing here?

1134
01:19:10,711 --> 01:19:13,374
- What are you doing here?
- Yes, but this is my room.

1135
01:19:14,074 --> 01:19:18,666
- Yes, but this is my room.
- But I have the key.

1136
01:19:18,701 --> 01:19:20,798
But I have the key.

1137
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:26,390
- But I am Beddini.
- You got me there, pal.

1138
01:19:28,022 --> 01:19:30,451
We will see who is the owner of this room.

1139
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,123
But, Jerry, you shouldn't be in here.

1140
01:19:50,157 --> 01:19:52,952
- It isn't cricket.
- No, Horace, it isn't tiddlywinks either.

1141
01:20:03,306 --> 01:20:05,868
Signor, there is a man in my bed.

1142
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:12,391
It's too bad. He's not here yet.

1143
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,388
I'll just wait until my uncle returns.

1144
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,417
Thank you.

1145
01:20:17,453 --> 01:20:19,149
Why, Jerry, I didn't know

1146
01:20:19,183 --> 01:20:20,180
that you had an uncle here.

1147
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,778
- Didn't you know?
- No.

1148
01:20:22,446 --> 01:20:24,209
I haven't, but this room is

1149
01:20:24,242 --> 01:20:25,540
just above the bridal suite.

1150
01:20:29,969 --> 01:20:30,733
He's not here, signor.

1151
01:20:30,767 --> 01:20:32,164
If he returns, you will call us.

1152
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:34,628
If he returns, I will kill him.

1153
01:20:34,661 --> 01:20:36,158
We Beddini have the motto:

1154
01:20:36,193 --> 01:20:39,055
For the woman, the kiss.

1155
01:20:39,089 --> 01:20:41,052
For the man, the sword.

1156
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:28,720
Dale, you are lovely.

1157
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:32,247
Like a flower I am afraid to crush.

1158
01:21:32,282 --> 01:21:33,812
Don't be afraid.

1159
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:44,697
Alberto, make him stop!

1160
01:21:44,731 --> 01:21:46,694
Who is it? You know?

1161
01:21:47,393 --> 01:21:48,491
Yes, it's Horace.

1162
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:52,552
Horace Hardwick, that interloper.

1163
01:21:52,587 --> 01:21:54,250
I'll stop him.

1164
01:22:01,574 --> 01:22:04,002
For the man, the sword.

1165
01:22:16,753 --> 01:22:17,983
Mrs. Hardwick's apartment, please.

1166
01:22:26,605 --> 01:22:27,703
- He's coming.
- Is he?

1167
01:22:27,737 --> 01:22:29,068
You keep this up and hold him

1168
01:22:29,102 --> 01:22:29,866
here as long as you can.

1169
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:30,864
I will.

1170
01:22:44,148 --> 01:22:45,512
Madge, you'd better come over

1171
01:22:45,546 --> 01:22:46,344
and rescue Horace.

1172
01:22:46,377 --> 01:22:48,174
Alberto has gone after him with a sword.

1173
01:23:02,988 --> 01:23:04,185
Why, yes, of course.

1174
01:23:16,037 --> 01:23:17,368
I'm sorry to break in like this,

1175
01:23:17,402 --> 01:23:18,566
but I simply had to see you.

1176
01:23:19,266 --> 01:23:20,795
Will you please stop annoying me?

1177
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,059
But you've been mistaken about me.

1178
01:23:24,392 --> 01:23:26,588
- I'm afraid I haven't.
- All right, then.

1179
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:28,186
I'll stay right here and there will be

1180
01:23:28,219 --> 01:23:29,183
a scene with your husband.

1181
01:23:31,549 --> 01:23:32,779
He'll be furious if he finds you here.

1182
01:23:34,178 --> 01:23:35,208
Then please come with me

1183
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:36,008
for a few minutes.

1184
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:37,139
I've simply got to talk to you.

1185
01:23:41,335 --> 01:23:42,365
And so you see, my dear chap,

1186
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:44,329
I am definitely the wrong person.

1187
01:23:44,364 --> 01:23:48,124
- But you are Horace Hardwick, no?
- Yes, of course I am Horace Hardwick.

1188
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:48,890
Then you are not

1189
01:23:48,924 --> 01:23:51,986
the wrong person. Prepare.

1190
01:23:58,312 --> 01:23:58,976
Don't mind me.

1191
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:00,274
I just came up to see the fun.

1192
01:24:00,308 --> 01:24:02,004
Madge, explain to this maniac that

1193
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,570
he is making a very serious mistake.

1194
01:24:03,604 --> 01:24:05,434
He may be making a mistake,

1195
01:24:05,468 --> 01:24:06,531
but it's not serious.

1196
01:24:07,598 --> 01:24:08,728
Go right ahead, Alberto.

1197
01:24:09,928 --> 01:24:11,790
No, I cannot kill him before a lady.

1198
01:24:12,691 --> 01:24:14,521
If you're going to pull out on us, Alberto,

1199
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:15,919
maybe it's best that you don't kill him.

1200
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:18,881
I may want that pleasure myself someday.

1201
01:24:23,077 --> 01:24:24,740
But why didn't you tell me who you were?

1202
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,635
After all, I mean, you never gave me

1203
01:24:28,669 --> 01:24:29,766
very much of a chance.

1204
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,154
Mr. Travers!

1205
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:45,445
Help, somebody.

1206
01:24:46,511 --> 01:24:47,608
I am so sorry.

1207
01:24:47,642 --> 01:24:49,605
I really did not want to kill you.

1208
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,836
- You must forgive me.
- I forgive you.

1209
01:24:56,097 --> 01:24:57,661
Go right ahead, boys, don't mind me.

1210
01:25:00,191 --> 01:25:01,056
Not tonight, Alberto.

1211
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:01,621
Some other time

1212
01:25:01,657 --> 01:25:02,754
when I'm feeling stronger.

1213
01:25:02,788 --> 01:25:03,686
Thank you.

1214
01:25:04,518 --> 01:25:06,414
- Pardon me, sir.
- What is it? What's the matter?

1215
01:25:06,449 --> 01:25:07,380
What have you been doing?

1216
01:25:08,213 --> 01:25:08,844
Pardon me, sir,

1217
01:25:08,879 --> 01:25:10,643
Mr. Travers and Miss Tremont, sir...

1218
01:25:10,677 --> 01:25:11,874
they're drifting out to the bay

1219
01:25:11,908 --> 01:25:12,839
in a gondola, sir.

1220
01:25:12,873 --> 01:25:15,435
There. That ought to make you

1221
01:25:15,471 --> 01:25:16,568
feel pretty small, accusing me.

1222
01:25:16,602 --> 01:25:18,765
- He's kidnapped her.
- Kidnapped her?

1223
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:21,960
You are in this plot.

1224
01:25:21,994 --> 01:25:23,956
You are cahooting with him.

1225
01:25:23,992 --> 01:25:24,756
I've had just about enough...

1226
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:27,020
Children, if Dale and Jerry

1227
01:25:27,053 --> 01:25:27,984
are drifting out to sea...

1228
01:25:28,019 --> 01:25:28,949
don't you think the best thing

1229
01:25:28,985 --> 01:25:30,648
we could do is rescue them?

1230
01:25:30,849 --> 01:25:31,779
Yes, come.

1231
01:25:31,814 --> 01:25:33,977
Isn't it marvelous to have some brains?

1232
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:34,909
I'm always so helpless.

1233
01:25:34,943 --> 01:25:37,272
Don't answer me like that. Do something.

1234
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,730
- Jerry.
- That isn't Jerry.

1235
01:25:42,765 --> 01:25:44,495
That's right. Make a fool of yourself.

1236
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:46,360
It's no crime to look, is it?

1237
01:25:52,385 --> 01:25:55,480
- I think there is no gas left.
- My word, no petrol?

1238
01:25:56,214 --> 01:25:57,411
Perhaps I'd better look at the engine,

1239
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:58,176
where is it?

1240
01:25:58,211 --> 01:25:59,474
They may have hidden it up there

1241
01:25:59,509 --> 01:26:00,240
under the hood.

1242
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,398
This is the first time

1243
01:26:06,433 --> 01:26:08,096
I ever had to walk back from a boat ride.

1244
01:26:13,323 --> 01:26:14,554
Jerry, you mustn't come with me.

1245
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:16,351
I'd rather talk to Alberto alone.

1246
01:26:17,017 --> 01:26:17,980
Alberto will have to get accustomed

1247
01:26:18,016 --> 01:26:19,079
to talking in front of me.

1248
01:26:19,748 --> 01:26:20,345
No, seriously,

1249
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,110
I'd rather you wouldn't. Please.

1250
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:24,039
When am I going to see you again?

1251
01:26:26,237 --> 01:26:27,535
I don't know.

1252
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:34,626
Mr. Travers, they went after you, sir,

1253
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,090
to look for you, sir, in a motorboat.

1254
01:26:37,523 --> 01:26:39,918
- Mr. Beddini, too?
- Yes, sir, all three of them...

1255
01:26:39,953 --> 01:26:41,583
but they won't be back this evening, sir.

1256
01:26:41,617 --> 01:26:42,515
We took the precaution

1257
01:26:42,549 --> 01:26:44,212
of removing the gasoline.

1258
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:47,241
Thank you, Bates.

1259
01:27:02,155 --> 01:27:03,885
What is it, my good man?

1260
01:27:08,911 --> 01:27:11,141
Yes. I'm masquerading.

1261
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,596
Don't you understand English?

1262
01:27:21,229 --> 01:27:22,926
You don't understand English?

1263
01:27:24,358 --> 01:27:27,486
Well, I've been waiting for an opportunity

1264
01:27:27,519 --> 01:27:29,216
like this since my childhood.

1265
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,778
You frozen-faced flatfoot.

1266
01:27:35,108 --> 01:27:36,938
And grazie to you if it comes to that,

1267
01:27:36,973 --> 01:27:39,035
you stultified shrimp.

1268
01:27:43,165 --> 01:27:44,228
Can I help it if you look

1269
01:27:44,262 --> 01:27:46,657
like a mildewed donkey?

1270
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:51,351
I'm adoring this.

1271
01:27:51,386 --> 01:27:53,682
And grazie to you, since you insist.

1272
01:27:53,716 --> 01:27:56,211
You see, I happen to be breaking the law.

1273
01:27:56,246 --> 01:27:58,908
I admit it wholeheartedly...

1274
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:00,538
but, of course, you would never know that,

1275
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:02,836
you fish-faced nincompoop.

1276
01:28:05,267 --> 01:28:06,498
Good night.

1277
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:14,753
I arrest you for masquerading

1278
01:28:14,787 --> 01:28:15,552
as a gondolier.

1279
01:28:15,586 --> 01:28:17,316
I further charge you with insulting

1280
01:28:17,349 --> 01:28:18,580
an officer with vile names...

1281
01:28:18,615 --> 01:28:20,345
according to Rule Three, Section Three

1282
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:22,242
of the law dealing with delinquents.

1283
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:36,489
Beg your pardon, signoro,

1284
01:28:36,524 --> 01:28:37,587
the carnival is beginning.

1285
01:28:37,622 --> 01:28:38,219
Shall I serve now

1286
01:28:38,255 --> 01:28:39,352
or will you wait for the groom?

1287
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,981
I don't think the groom

1288
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:43,046
will be here tonight.

1289
01:28:43,847 --> 01:28:45,644
- Very good, sir.
- Very good? It's perfect.

1290
01:28:46,776 --> 01:28:47,806
I still feel a little guilty

1291
01:28:47,841 --> 01:28:48,938
being here with you...

1292
01:28:48,972 --> 01:28:50,568
while Alberto's out looking for us.

1293
01:28:51,369 --> 01:28:53,032
Let's eat, drink, and be merry,

1294
01:28:53,068 --> 01:28:54,398
for tomorrow we have to face him.

1295
01:35:32,634 --> 01:35:34,469
The hour of reckoning is at hand.

1296
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:38,206
Beddini is about to settle his accounts.

1297
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,016
Skipper, will you tell

1298
01:35:48,049 --> 01:35:49,584
my husband we're here?

1299
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:56,758
He's the one with his mouth closed.

1300
01:36:04,866 --> 01:36:05,533
Listen, you two idiots,

1301
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:07,102
Alberto is as mad as a drunken toreador.

1302
01:36:07,135 --> 01:36:09,237
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the room.

1303
01:36:10,372 --> 01:36:11,373
If you take my advice, you'll take

1304
01:36:11,406 --> 01:36:12,774
the first plane back to London pronto.

1305
01:36:13,475 --> 01:36:14,976
Not until I've asked Mr. Beddini for his

1306
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:17,612
wife's hand. Do you think he'll accept me?

1307
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:24,686
- Mr. Hardwick.
- What do you want?

1308
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:26,021
I regret to report, my dear sir,

1309
01:36:26,054 --> 01:36:27,922
that your manservant has been arrested.

1310
01:36:27,956 --> 01:36:30,692
- Bates? Really?
- Yes, sir.

1311
01:36:30,725 --> 01:36:32,294
He would have spent the whole night

1312
01:36:32,327 --> 01:36:34,029
in jail if I had not bailed him out.

1313
01:36:34,062 --> 01:36:35,096
You don't mean it.

1314
01:36:40,201 --> 01:36:40,869
Come in.

1315
01:36:47,475 --> 01:36:48,710
At last.

1316
01:36:49,711 --> 01:36:51,579
The little birdies have come flying back

1317
01:36:51,613 --> 01:36:52,747
to the rooster.

1318
01:36:56,818 --> 01:36:58,653
Mr. Beddini, we want to explain

1319
01:36:58,687 --> 01:36:59,955
this whole thing to you.

1320
01:37:00,655 --> 01:37:02,457
I will not listen to any excuses,

1321
01:37:03,224 --> 01:37:04,659
not even the truth.

1322
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,795
Jerry, Madge,

1323
01:37:06,828 --> 01:37:08,630
I have the most amazing news.

1324
01:37:08,663 --> 01:37:11,533
A few days ago,
my invaluable manservant, Bates...

1325
01:37:11,566 --> 01:37:14,402
Allow me to tell them, sir, please.

1326
01:37:14,436 --> 01:37:16,137
Quiet, your turn will come later.

1327
01:37:17,172 --> 01:37:17,906
A few days ago,

1328
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:19,708
my invaluable manservant, Bates...

1329
01:37:19,774 --> 01:37:21,843
The needle has gotten stuck in a crack.

1330
01:37:23,111 --> 01:37:24,045
You tell it, Bates.

1331
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:25,113
Thank you, madam.

1332
01:37:29,718 --> 01:37:31,987
You see, Miss Dale, Mr. Hardwick thought

1333
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:33,121
you were a dangerous woman.

1334
01:37:33,154 --> 01:37:34,356
And he asked me to follow you

1335
01:37:34,389 --> 01:37:37,826
in case you did something dangerous.

1336
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,629
- Follow me?
- Yes, miss.

1337
01:37:40,662 --> 01:37:42,364
And in order to put you off the scent,

1338
01:37:42,397 --> 01:37:44,966
I thought of many little disguises.

1339
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,002
This evening, I met

1340
01:37:47,035 --> 01:37:48,370
Mr. Beddini and Miss Tremont...

1341
01:37:48,403 --> 01:37:49,504
and fearing

1342
01:37:49,537 --> 01:37:50,772
that they might recognize me...

1343
01:37:50,805 --> 01:37:53,174
I turned my collar around...

1344
01:37:53,208 --> 01:37:57,312
like this.

1345
01:37:57,345 --> 01:38:01,449
And very cleverly, I became a clergyman.

1346
01:38:03,184 --> 01:38:05,587
You are the one who married us.

1347
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:06,988
Yes, sir.

1348
01:38:08,156 --> 01:38:10,358
Then we've never been really married?

1349
01:38:10,392 --> 01:38:12,160
Precisely, miss.

1350
01:38:15,697 --> 01:38:17,499
Well, Mr. Beddini...

1351
01:38:18,266 --> 01:38:19,034
what are you doing

1352
01:38:19,067 --> 01:38:20,769
in this young lady's room?
