Away to the chip shop
and get us a couple of fish suppers.

30
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,190
You want to encourage that boy to speak more.

31
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,490
There's nothing wrong with his voice.
He's got a lovely wee voice.

32
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,410
You should encourage it more.

33
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,200

<i>MAN: Oh Marie!
Come on, give us a break!</i>

38
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,260
Oh, keep your hair on! It's a joke.

39
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,510
Right, you two, beat it.

40
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,140
And don't annoy me for the rest of the week,
OK?

41
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,890
<i>Right, who's next?</i>

42
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,100
OK.

43
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,640
Right.

Aye, no bother.

49
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,550
Right.

50
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,510
OK, is that it?

51
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,440
How old are you?

52
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,950
Yeah, well, come back in six and a half years.

53
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,790
Just you go back down there
and tell Madam Muck

54
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,280
<i>that you want a packet of Embassy Regal.</i>

55
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,630
<i>And if she gives you any more of her lip,</i>

56
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,130
tell her I'll come down
and batter more than her fish.

57
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,090
Are you that desperate?

58
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,720
And that was that. Know what I mean?

59
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,980
Excuse me. 20 Embassy Regal.

60
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,980
Er... there's a queue.

61
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,760
My boy's already queued.
And before you ask, I am 16, so...

62
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,900
Yeah, and the rest.
OK, hold your horses. I'll do you next.

63
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,320
<i>MAN: Come on there's a queue!
- Oh, God almighty!</i>

64
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,780
She only wants a packet of fags!

65
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,950
What was the problem, anyway?
Could you not understand him?

66
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,740
I understood him perfectly.
He's a smart wee cookie.

67
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,000
For a deaf kid?

68
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,780
For his age.

69
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,500
Thanks.

00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,740

(Reads) You left while I was sleeping,

75
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,250
Taken from my loving arm,

76
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,510
And now I'm left to grieve here,
broken like a doll.

77
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,390
Jesus Christ, that doesn't even rhyme.

78
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,430
They're supposed to rhyme.

79
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,730
Just you make sure mine rhymes.

80
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,860
Oh, don't bother. I'll write it myself.

81
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,030
It's wishful thinking, you know.
You won't find his name in there.

82
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,070
Well, he's got to die sometime.

83
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,530
<i>Did you know something, Da?</i>

84
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,790
<i>Did you know a Great White
can jump right out of the water</i>

85
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,460
<i>and knock over a boat?</i>

86
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,590
<i>Not your boat, though. Your boat's ginormous.</i>

87
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,550
<i>And guess what else, Da? Guess what?</i>

88
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,040
<i>From my window, I can see the sea.</i>

89

(Tuts)

90
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,810
You have to wear it.

91
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,530
Did you do the toilet?

92
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,700
It's a big day tomorrow.
You'll need to get to sleep now.

93
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,520
- Miss?
- Yes?

94
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,060
What does it feel like to be deaf?

95
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,940
Brilliant. You wouldnae be able to hear your ma
shouting at you to do stuff all the time.

96
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,490
(Laughter)

97
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,370
Miss, is it like when your ears are all blocked,
and everything feels like it's miles away?

98
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,030
Well, that's certainly one way to think about it.

99
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,170
But just remember,
you don't have to shout at him all the time.

100
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,450
Do you hear me, Ricky?

101
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,500
Sorry, Miss, did you say something?

102
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,920

104
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,520
Well, let's give it a couple of weeks.
If he's struggling, we'll let you know.

105
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,440
He won't struggle.
There's nothing wrong with his brain.

106
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,280
Is there, Frankie?

107
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,570
A word to the wise.
Watch what you say in front of him.

108
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,620
He's a champion lip-reader.

I am well aware that a wee boy your age

at this time of the day.

167

There's no flies on me, so come on.

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,160
Oh, never you mind, son.

175
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,250
<i>You... You pick a book.</i>

176
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,160
<i>Pick any book.</i>

177
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,250
And if we don't have it here,

178
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,380
then I will move mountains to get it for you.

179
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,980
Any cards up there for a locksmith?

180
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,470
I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.

181
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,890
Ah...

182
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,660
Got them.

183
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,540
(Rings bell)

184
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,960
(Sighs)

185
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,090
(Imitates beatbox)

186
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,470
Is this Frankie Morrison's house?

187
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,160
(Whistles)

188
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,590
You're weird.

189
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,190
A-C-C-R-A.

190
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,480
What's that supposed to mean?

191
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,780
It's the name of his dad's boat.

192
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,150
And it's the capital of Ghana.

193
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,950
Don't tell me, you must be Ricky Monroe?

194
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,040
- Ricky...
- What?

195
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,790
Get your feet off the bed.

196
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,370
(Doorbell rings)

197
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
Thanks, but no thanks.

198
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,130
The advert won't go in the paper till Friday.

199
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,300
I'm grateful for the offer,
but we might not be here that long.

200
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,300
That's what I said when I first came.

201
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,310
It's only a part-time job.
I'm not asking you to sign your life away.

202
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,060
OK, just think about it.

203
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,940
<i>NANA: She doesn't need to think about it.
She'll take it.</i>

204
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,820
<i>Just tell her what time you want her to start.</i>

205
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,740
(Laughs)

206
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,450
OK, then.

207
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,830
(Radio on)

208
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,090
<i>MAN:
We crossed the equator a week ago, Frankie.</i>

209
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,180
<i>Be docking in the Cape soon.</i>

210
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,350
<i>And it's really hot on board now.</i>

211
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,130
<i>It's so hot on deck,
you burn your hands on the rail.</i>

212
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,690
<i>Well, I'd better go now, Frankie.</i>

213
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,860
<i>It's my turn on watch.</i>

214
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,320
<i>Now, mind and stick in at school
and be a good boy for your mammy.</i>

215
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,120
<i>Love from your daddy.</i>

216
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,240
Hey, Frankie boy, bet you're dead excited
about seeing your da?

217
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,410
GIRL: Why don't you just lay down and die?

218
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,910
Ignore him, Frankie.

219
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,870
Bet you didn't even know his boat was coming!

220
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,150
Of course he knew, stupid.

221
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,200
And you don't need to shout.
He can see what you're saying... unfortunately.

222
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,420
I bet you all my trump cards
your da doesn't come.

223
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,080
If he comes, I'll give you the lot.

224
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,460
If he doesnae come,

225
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,600
you have to give me every single one of
your stamps and your knife, to keep for ever.

226
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,170
No, Frankie, don't. Don't do it.

227
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,690
<i>Dear Da, sorry I haven't written for a few days.</i>

228
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,860
<i>Things have been very busy here.</i>

229
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,390
<i>I suppose you've been busy too,</i>

230
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,720
<i>now that you've had to change course
and sail back north.</i>

231
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,980
<i>Ricky Monroe told me.</i>

232
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,270
<i>Trust him to put his big feet right in it.</i>

233
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,240
<i>I've told him hundreds and hundreds of times</i>

234
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,860
<i>you might not even get shore leave.</i>

235
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,200
<i>But he doesn't know about these things
He's not very clever. And he's a liar.</i>

236
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,990
<i>He said you wouldn't want to come
and see us, even if you could.</i>

237
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,610
<i>So, guess what, Da? I've made a bet.</i>

238
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,200
<i>I bet Ricky Monroe you were coming.</i>

239
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,840
<i>Then I said I'd bring you
to the football trials to prove it.</i>

240
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,350
Hey, slowcoach, I'm waiting on those chips.

241
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,480
OK, hold your horses, I'm doing them.

242
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
Everything all right?

243
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,190
Yeah, everything's fine. Absolutely fine.

244
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,670
I need the money for the milk.

245
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,290
We owe three weeks
and he'll be here first thing.

246
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,060
My purse is on the table,
and don't do that again.

247
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,420
- Don't do what?
- Come in here without knocking.

248
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,050
I thought you were Frankie.

249
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,430
So? You shouldnae have anything to hide.

250
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,310
Shut the door.

251
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,520
I've got something I need to show you.

252
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,240
(Sighs)

253
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,910
I knew something like this would happen.
I told you, didn't I?

254
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,290
What are we going to do?

255
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,540
Move?

256
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,170
Lizzie, darling, listen, you cannae keep running.

257
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,750
You've got to face this sometime.

258
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,300
Tell Frankie the truth. He should know, Lizzie.

259
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,390
<i>He should know what his daddy was.</i>

260
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,310
Then maybe he'd stop wishing for him.

261
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,190
Have you forgotten what it was like?

262
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,690
No, I haven't forgotten. But it's over now.
It's over and done with. Davey's dead.

263
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,060
Davey's not dead.

264
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,490
I check that paper every week.
I know he's not dead.

265
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,990
<i>He could walk in through that door
any minute now and take what's his.</i>

266
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,230
No, he won't walk in.

267
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,490
- How do you know that?
- I just know it.

268
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,200
Lizzie, darling, you're my daughter
and I love you, but you're wrong.

269
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,080
You've stopped living your life.
You're the one that's dead.

270
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,880
That's not what Frankie needs.

271
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,590
He doesnae need lies in a letter.

272
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,850
He needs flesh and blood.

273
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,060
<i>- Where are you going?
- For cigarettes.</i>

274
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,240
(Tuts)

275
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,290
(Ringing tone)

276
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,710
<i>WOMAN: Hello?</i>

277
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,500
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

278
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,780
Go away.

279
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,200
Just go away and leave us alone.

280
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,550
For God's sake, just leave us alone.

281
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,400
Do you believe in mermaids?

282
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,450
I do. I think the sea's full of them.

283
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,450
I saw one once, over at Meagle Point.

284
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,500
There. What do you think?
Do I look like a mermaid?

285
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,750
Frankie, why don't you ask your mammy?

286
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,880
Ask her if your daddy's going to come.

287
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,510
I know. You want to know,
but you don't want to know.

288
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,220
Tricky.

289
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,390
You know what I would do,
if I was in your situation?

290
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,880
I'd look in my mammy's wardrobe.

291
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,230
Whenever there's something
my mammy doesn't want me to see,

292
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,440
she hides it in the back of her wardrobe.

293
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,570
I've found hundreds of things in there.

294
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,650
Condoms...

295
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,780
...dirty videos, cheap cigarettes.

296
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:27,160
See, I bet your daddy's written
to your mammy and told her he's coming,

297
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,250
but not to tell you because it's a surprise.

298
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,540
Girls love secrets, Frankie.

299
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,670
It'll be in the back of her wardrobe.

300
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,380
Trust me. I know these things.

301
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,060
Wardrobe.

302
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,780
(Rattles door handle)

303
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,990
The key's here somewhere.

304
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,420
Aw!

305
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
Perfect.

306
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,770
Look, Frankie, a bride's dress.

307
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,540
What are you doing with that?

308
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
<i>That's mine. Put it down.</i>

309
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,550
What else did you touch?

310
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,300
What else?

311
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,390
What else did you touch?

312
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,200
Never go near my things again,
do you hear me?

313
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,030
<i>They're mine.</i>

314
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,990
They're nothing to do with you. Nothing.

315
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,450
I'm entitled to some privacy.

316
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,790
I'm allowed one thing of my own. Just one.

317
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,500
One single thing that's mine.

318
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,630
I'm here, Frankie.

319
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,510
I'm the one that's here.

320
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,590
I'm the one that's still here!

321
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,210
Are you still in a huff with me?

322
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:29,300
I wish you wouldn't sit there. You'll get a chill.

323
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,550
Suit yourself.

324
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,440
I need to tell you something important.

325
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,590
Of course he wants to see you.

326
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,430
He might not want to see me,
but he'll always want to see you.

327
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,270
You're his boy.

328
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,940
Maybe he just can't, Frankie.

329
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,700
It's been a long time.

330
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,210
Like yourself.

331
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,460
You look like yourself.

332
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,280
Heard from your dad yet, Frankie boy?

333
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,550
Hold on! I wasnae finished with that.

334
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,350
Well, hurry up. I haven't got all night.

335
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,310
Come on, Frankie, you too. Eat.

336
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,100
Where's the bloody fire?

337
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,270
I'm going out, that's all.

338
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,150
If the wind changes, your faces'll stay like that.

339
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,450
(Buzz of conversation)

340
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,290
(Thumping music)

341
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,960
Bacardi and Coke, please.

342
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,070
<i>I hope you're not working, sweetheart.</i>

343
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,150
We don't do deals in here.

344
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,880
No. On your bike.

00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,910
I suppose you're dying to know
what I was doing.

347
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,500
Well, I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't, but...

348
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,500
...that doesn't mean you have to tell me.

349
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,840
I was looking for a man.

350
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,510
<i>A stranger.</i>

351
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,090
No past, no present...

352
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,930
...no future.

353
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,150
I was looking for a man to be Frankie's dad.

354
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,370
Just for a day, one single day,
and I was going to pay him to do it.

355
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,170
(Door opens)

356
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,660
Where the hell have you been?

357
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,910
I've been worried sick.

358
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,910
I've been at Marie's.

359
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Everything's all right now.

360
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,740
(Shop bell rings)

361
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,370
<i>BOY: Pass to me!</i>

362
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,200
<i>FRANKIE: Dear Da, in case you're interested,</i>

363
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,500
<i>the football trials are on Saturday
at Boundary Park.</i>

364
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,160
<i>10:30.</i>

365
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,540
<i>Mr Fraser said I could get
into the reserves if I want.</i>

366
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,510
<i>But I don't. I'm rubbish at football.</i>

367
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,090
<i>Who cares about a stupid bet anyway?</i>

368
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,680
(Cheering)

369
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,260
Yes!

370
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,810
Another goal by the master!

371
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,270
<i>FRANKIE: I know
you're only three whole days away,</i>

372
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,820
<i>so you might not even get this letter.</i>

373
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,860
<i>If you can't come and see me,
that's all right, I understand.</i>

374
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,620
<i>Ma says it's been a long time
and you've probably changed.</i>

375
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,190
<i>I have, that's for sure.</i>

376
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,080
<i>I'm now four foot eight inches tall,</i>

377
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,040
<i>and I have brownish hair, just like Ma's.</i>

378
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,550
<i>Do you know something funny, Da?</i>

379
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,590
<i>I think Ma knew you'd be coming.</i>

380
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,430
<i>That's why she brought us here.</i>

381
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,720
<i>I think she wanted you to find us.</i>

382
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,060
(Laughter and chatting)

383
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,980
(Raucous laughter)

384
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,460
Lizzie Morrison?

385
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,880
Yeah.

386
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,390
An Americano. Strong.

387
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,890
- Just water.
- Sparkling or still?

388
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,850
Tap.

389
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,690
Don't get service like this at Marie's.

390
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Marie didn't tell me much about you.

391
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,460
No past, present or future.
That's what you said you wanted.

392
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,890
Frankie's letters to his dad.

393
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,350
He's been writing them for a few years now.

394
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,930
He's a lovely wee writer.

395
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,980
Well, you'll see that for yourself.

396
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,520
He sends them to a post office box
here in Glasgow,

397
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,230
and I collect them twice a month
and then I write back.

398
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,330
Um, this is one of mine.

399
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,290
That's a Scottish postmark.

400
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,920
Yeah, I've told him there's a central mail depot,

401
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,630
and that all the letters from the ship go there.

402
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,050
He doesnae question it.

403
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,480
I make it all up. I've been making it up for years.

404
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,480
I made up the boat.

405
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,230
I saw the name on a stamp.

406
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,070
How was I to know
the bloody boat actually existed?

407
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,950
That's Frankie,

408
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,130
a couple of months before his dad left.

409
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,380
And this is him now.

410
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,310
Frankie's deaf, but he's a champion lip-reader.

411
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,640
How old is he?

412
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,760
Nine.

413
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,970
And a half.

414
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,940
Does he remember what his dad looks like?

415
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,400
I don't remember what he looks like.
It's been a while.

416
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,580
Does Frankie have any photographs
of his dad?

417
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,450
No.

418
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,570
You sure?

419
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
Yes, I'm sure.

420
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,250
(Clears throat)

421
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,550
Marie says you're only here for a week.

422
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,830
I sail next Monday.

423
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,330
Good, that's good. That fits in just right.

424
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,630
Um...

425
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:09,270
That must be some life,
seeing all those different places.

426
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,150
You should know.

427
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,730
You've been writing from them for years.

428
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,160
You must think I'm completely mad,
asking a total stranger to do this.

429
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,950
I don't know who the hell you are, but...

430
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,250
...I'm asking you if you'll do it.

431
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,170
I don't have much, but I'll pay you what I can.

432
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,700
What time do you want me to be there?

433
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,840
One day to go, Frankie boy.

434
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,720
<i>WOMEN:
# The midges, I'm no gonna kid yous</i>

435
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,510
# The midges is really the limit

436
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,390
# With teeth like piranhas

437
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,930
<i># They'll drive you bananas</i>

438
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,400
# If you let them get under your...

439
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,320
# Simmit

440
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,900
(They cheer)

441
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,560
Hey, come on, you sing one now.

442
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,700
Oh, God, no, I can't sing.

443
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,900
<i>MARIE: Oh, go on.</i>

444
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,950
# Da dum da-da dum...

445
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,580
Come on, you know it better than me.

446
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,750
# When I was a young girl

447
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,460
# I used to dream of a lover

448
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:05,260
<i># Who'd be my shining knight
of strength one day</i>

449
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:11,310
# He'd carry me to a castle in the heavens

450
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:17,270
<i># And he'd battle all my dragons far away</i>

451
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,030
<i># And he'd ride down</i>

452
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,690
# On a great white horse

453
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,290
# And he'd bring me love

454
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,790
# I'd been longing for

455
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,750
# And he'd bring me joy

456
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,460
<i># And lasting peace</i>

457
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,000
<i># And on a great white horse</i>

458
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,250
<i># He'd ride away with me</i>

459
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,300
(Ship's hooter)

460
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,810
Lizzie. For God's sake,
will you stop still for a minute and listen?

461
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,530
I can't, I've got to find him.
God knows where he is.

462
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,570
Well, I'll go. I'll find him.

463
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,610
He's due at ten, isn't he?

464
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,410
- The man?
- Yeah.

465
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:10,240
- Well, you'd better stay here in case.
- In case of what?

466
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,700
Just in case.

467
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,160
I'll find him. I promise.

468
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,350
I look at you sometimes and I swear
I don't know where you came from.

469
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,560
And this man?

470
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,650
<i>- Who is this man that's coming?
- I told you. He's a friend of Marie's.</i>

471
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,320
Oh, that's a comfort!

472
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,700
Jesus, Lizzie, we don't know anything
about this man.

473
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,410
He could be a...

474
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,670
<i>We don't know anything about him.</i>

475
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,960
We don't need to know anything.

476
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,380
- This is the end of it.
- Promise?

477
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,970
(Doorbell rings)

478
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,380
That's him.

479
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,020
Hey, Frankie.

480
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,940
Your mammy is worried about you.

481
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,620
It's good up here, isn't it?

482
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,920
This is my favourite place in the whole world.

483
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,840
See, when you come around the coner,

484
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,630
and the cranes appear out of nowhere...

485
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,390
<i>With the hills behind them</i>

486
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:57,140
<i>and the water dancing round them.</i>

487
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,230
Takes my breath away.

488
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,940
Every single time.

489
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,000
(Sighs)

490
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,000
(Lizzie sighs)

491
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,810
Right, if he's not back in five minutes,
I'm going to the docks myself.

492
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,190
How do you even know that's where he is?

493
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,820
Where would you go if it was you?

494
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,610
He won't go on that ship.

495
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,990
How do you know what he would do?
You've not even met him.

496
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,070
He doesn't want to spoil the surprise.

497
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,410
If I was a betting man,

498
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,500
which I'm not,

499
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,330
I'd put money on it.

500
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,180
Mother, do something useful
and put the kettle on.

501
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,940
Would you like a cup of tea?

502
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,610
- I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
- Jesus God!

503
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,570
What's Frankie's dad called?

504
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,060
Depends who's calling him.

505
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,200
Davey.

506
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,290
Call me Davey, then.

507
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,080
(Doorbell)

508
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,500
Don't ruin this for him, please.
Let him have this one day.

509
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,930
(Man clears throat)

510
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,290
Have you got that money?

511
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,350
Oh, yeah, um...

512
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,440
That's half now, half later.

513
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,690
<i>Look, there's no harm done.</i>

514
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,360
<i>He knows he shouldn't have done it.</i>

515
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,610
So, um... everything all right?

516
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,870
<i>- Yeah.
- Good</i>

517
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,580
Right, I'd better go.

518
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,340
Hey, come in for chips after the football, OK?

519
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:28,540
Marie...

520
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,250
Thanks for bringing him.

521
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,620
Right.

522
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,220
<i>No, leave that, Frankie. Do it later.</i>

523
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,390
<i>I want you to come in here for a minute.</i>

524
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,390
You've got a visitor, Frankie.

525
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,480
This is your daddy.

526
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,700
Hello, Frankie.

527
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,540
You've got big.

528
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,920
I didn't tell you I was coming because...

529
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,970
<i>I wasn't sure if I'd be here in time.</i>

530
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,730
<i>I hoped I would, but I wasn't sure.</i>

531
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,680
I've got something for you.

532
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,980
Frankie wasnae looking for anything.
You didn't need to do that.

533
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,020
I know I didn't need to.

534
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,360
That's for you.

535
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,210
He wants to know how you knew.

536
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,180
I read it.

537
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,890
You... You'll have to look at him.

538
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,180
<i>Sorry</i>

539
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,600
I read it in your letters.

540
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,640
<i>(Clears throat)</i>

541
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,090
You'll have to get a move on, you'll be late.

542
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,770
Come on, slowcoach. Get your things together.

543
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:48,850
Here.

544
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,480
You'll want to remember the look
on Ricky Monroe's face.

545
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,700
<i>MAN: Come on, now, boys, that's good.</i>

546
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,990
<i>Keep moving</i>

547
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,450
<i>Well done.</i>

548
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,950
Come on.

549
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,070
<i>- What are you doing, you bloody idiot?
- What?</i>

550
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,920
- You gave me a crap pass.
- I didn't mean to. I slipped.

551
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,060
Well, a bet's a bet.

552
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,100
You won it fair and square.

553
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,400
Do you want to bring him for chips?

554
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,990
No? Another time maybe?

555
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:27,910
Come on, Frankie.

556
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,410
This is half an hour of my life
I am never going to get back.

557
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,540
Just have what you always have.

558
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,040
Chips.

559
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,460
<i>MAN: Me too.</i>

560
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,510
Can I have some fish with mine?

561
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,850
Er... Frankie is a vegetarian.

562
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:55,310
He's a vegetarian
that doesnae eat his vegetables.

563
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,650
Roll and butter?

564
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:05,360
Can I change my mind?

565
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,240
Sure.

566
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,620
No fish for me.

567
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,660
Right, is that it?

568
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,430
I know, Frankie.

569
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,650
Good? Yeah? Yeah?

570
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,370
It's going well.

571
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,160
Is it?

572
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,620
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

573
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,670
I thought this is what you wanted.

574
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,040
Yeah, it is.

575
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,210
He's not going to take him away from you,
Lizzie.

576
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,600
- Nobody could do that.
(Shop bell)

577
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,760
(Door bangs)

578
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,310
Where are they going now?

579
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,020
He wouldn't take him to the ship?

580
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,860
Lizzie, wait! Wait.

581
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,690
Lizzie!

582
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:07,100
Big, isn't she?

583
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,860
More than a match for any shark.

584
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,820
Want to go on?

585
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,840
It's up to you, Frankie.

586
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,350
Take a picture, then.

587
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:38,510
For later.

588
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,150
# DAMIEN RICE: Delicate

589
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,170
# We might kiss

590
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,180
# When we are alone

591
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,930
# When nobody's watching...

592
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,230
Too bumpy. Flat, so it skims.

593
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,410
# We might make out

594
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,870
# When nobody's there

595
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,630
# It's not that we're scared...

596
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:52,340
This is good, Frankie.

597
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,800
Frankie...

598
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:02,560
# So why do you fill my sorrow?

599
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,020
That is a champion skimmer.

600
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:17,190
# From the only place that you've known

601
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:27,500
# And why do you sing hallelujah

602
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:33,250
# If it means nothing to ya?

603
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,380
# Why do you sing...

604
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,260
Want to go for a race?

605
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:42,890
# With me at all?

606
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,810
# Why did you fill my sorrow

607
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:58,030
# With the words you've borrowed?

608
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:06,790
# Why do you sing with me at all?

609
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,940
You OK?

610
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,750
I've had an idea.

611
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,930
(Pants breathlessly)

612
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:04,050
(Knocks on door)

613
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,520
Oh!

614
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:16,520
- Have you not got a watch?
- Sorry. The time just flew.

615
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,870
Now, Frankie, say goodbye.

616
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,500
He's tired.

617
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,580
It's been a long day.

618
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,830
Aye, you can say that again.
Well, it's over now.

619
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,960
So, we'll just say cheerio,
and thanks very much.

620
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,880
Go on, Frankie, say cheerio.

621
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,720
Come on. It's late.

622
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:56,860
I think he wants to ask you something.

623
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,070
What do you think he wants to ask me?

624
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:05,660
I don't go back to my ship till Monday.

625
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:06,910
So?

626
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:10,830
So, I thought it might be nice to...
spend some more time with Frankie.

627
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,380
Did you, now?

628
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:21,670
Well, Frankie and you.
You know, the three of us.

629
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,050
No.

630
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,290
No!

631
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,720
Now see what you've done.

632
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,860
Mother, take Frankie inside now.

633
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,200
We had an arrangement. You broke it.

634
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:54,460
One more day. That's all.

635
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,460
No, no, no, I want you to go now.

636
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,500
It's over. Do you hear me? It's over.

637
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,710
My ship sails in one day.

638
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,170
There is only one more day.

639
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,220
Who the hell do you think you are?

640
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,890
Who gave you the right
to come in here and behave like this?

641
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,600
You did.

642
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,880
He's waited all this time.

643
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,020
<i>You've waited all this time.</i>

644
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:38,170
One o'clock, here.

645
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,040
One o'clock down at the quay.

646
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:44,670
- Right, that's it. Come on.
- I've got business down at the quay.

647
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,840
Be easier if you could meet me there.
Trust me.

648
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:55,770
You have to trust somebody someday.

649
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,360
One o'clock at the quay.

650
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,280
Come on, son.

651
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,320
You'll see him again tomorrow.

652
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,210
Did your daddy give you that?

653
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,550
It's a beauty.

654
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,720
That should really fly.

655
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:36,080
<i>LIZZIE: Is Frankie sleeping?</i>

656
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,840
I doubt it. He's wound up like a spring.

657
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,040
Do you fancy a wee whisky, Ma?

658
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,920
Why? What are we celebrating?

659
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,550
We're not celebrating anything.
I just need one, that's all.

660
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,820
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

661
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:20,540
<i>Here. Give me that.</i>

662
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,800
Bette Davis used to have blood-red nails.

663
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,840
- Did she?
- Mm.

664
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,300
That's what your daddy used to call you.

665
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:42,930
You'd be all dressed up
in my best frock and high heels.

666
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,700
Talking away to yourself.

667
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:47,690
Away in your own wee world.

668
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:50,440
And he'd say,

669
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:54,860
"Jesus Christ, Nell!
Who the hell does that lassie think she is?

670
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,320
Bette Davis?"

671
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,660
I never really liked Bette Davis.

672
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,160
Preferred Barbara Stanwyck.

673
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,300
You knew where you were
with Barbara Stanwyck.

674
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:16,620
Ma...

675
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,840
What is it?

676
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,810
My brush. Have you seen my brush?

677
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:25,850
- In your bag.
- Oh, aye.

678
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,900
Oh, I forgot to give you this.
It's been in my bag for ages.

679
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,860
You know something? I don't think
I'll bother getting this paper any more.

680
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,330
Never anything in it.

681
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,920
Let me see it.

682
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,210
Aye. Aye, you can come right over.

683
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:30,250
Come round later.

684
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:36,420
Maybe we can get a video or something.

685
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:39,550
(Door opens)

686
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,770
Janet wants to meet me.

687
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:48,020
Is he dead?

688
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,600
He's very ill, apparently.

689
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,800
It's a trap.

690
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,810
He wants to see Frankie.

691
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,520
We can leave. Go tonight.

692
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:58,290
You don't owe him anything.

693
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:02,370
JANET: I know I shouldn't ask,
but he's my brother, Lizzie.

694
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:03,780
He's my brother.

695
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:06,080
He's a sorry sight, Lizzie.

696
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,040
He's not the man he was. That's a dead cert.

697
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,710
If you could only just see him.

698
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,670
No.

699
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,240
Please. Put the past behind you,
for Frankie's sake.

700
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:18,670
- Leave Frankie out of it.
- He's dying, Lizzie.

701
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:21,380
How long has he got?

702
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:26,220
They don't know. It just depends
how much fight there is in him.

703
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,810
He always had plenty of that.

704
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:30,020
What good does that do now?

705
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,100
I don't have to justify myself to you.

706
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:33,190
<i>Or him.</i>

707
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:35,440
I don't blame you. I've never blamed you.

708
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:37,860
<i>He's my brother. I know exactly what he is.</i>

709
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,990
But you know what they say.

710
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:43,660
No, Janet, what do they say?

711
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,740
They say blood's thicker than water, Lizzie,

712
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,580
and, like it or not,
he's Frankie's flesh and blood.

713
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,360
- I'll see him on my own.
- He wants to see Frankie.

714
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:56,630
For God's sake, he might not last. Please.

715
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:58,630
I'm begging you. Show some pity.

716
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:02,340
I'll see him on my own,
and then I'll decide if I let him near my son.

717
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,890
That's it, Janet. Take it or leave it.

718
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,350
Ready?

719
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:40,860
Cheers, pal.

720
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,530
Here.

721
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:03,420
Right, you choose.

722
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,130
Where do you want to go?

723
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,930
# JESSE HARRIS:
The Secret Sun

724
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,480
# Meet me by the sea again

725
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:30,280
# Past the point where the shoreline bends

726
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:35,450
# Where the sand is soft and warm

727
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:42,010
# And hangs upon your golden arm

728
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:50,890
# And time won't move at all

729
01:11:56,270 --> 01:12:00,220
# We were once the only ones

730
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,650
# Who knew of the secret sun

731
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:11,820
# Shining down where no-one goes

732
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:17,440
# In a place that no-one knows...

733
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,540
I think this must be yours, sir.

734
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:25,240
Stupid me. It's for you, isn't it?

735
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:32,840
Your dad thought
all his birthdays had come at once.

736
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,020
Could you bring another spoon,

737
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,060
just in case he cannae finish it?

738
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,030
Hold it flat, Frankie!

739
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,500
<i>He cannae hear you.</i>

740
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,710
Sorry.

741
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,380
I forgot.

742
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:13,760
# But back there in the orange light

743
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:19,560
# There will be no fear of the night

744
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:29,860
# And time won't move at all

745
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:38,030
# And time won't move

746
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:45,200
# At all

747
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:32,760
<i>MARIE: Hi, Frankie!</i>

748
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,910
You well?

749
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:36,970
Oh, no, thanks!

750
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,880
Hello.

751
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,140
Hiya.

752
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:44,270
- You look nice.
- So do you.

753
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,390
(Muffled techno music)

754
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,690
Oh, this is Ally, er... my partner.

755
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:51,970
In crime.

756
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:54,110
Hi.

757
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:59,150
I thought you only had the one day.

758
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,570
I did.

759
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,870
This is the second half of it.

760
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,080
Aye, Frankie must be delighted.

761
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,170
So, what are you all up to now?

762
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,500
Going home.
Frankie's got school in the morning.

763
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,130
Why don't you stay?

764
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,640
I mean, just for a wee while.

765
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,100
<i>I mean, he'd love it.</i>

766
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:27,230
Right, the DJ is rank,
but there's a great band on afterwards.

767
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,190
No, sweetheart, it's been a long day.

768
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:33,650
<i>And it's time to go now.</i>

769
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:35,530
Come on, son.

770
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:37,360
It's just this once.

771
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,990
# LOS DEL RIO:
Macarena (River Remix)

772
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,370
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

773
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:49,030
# Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle

774
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,130
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

775
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:52,670
# Hey, Macarena!

776
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,710
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

777
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,210
# Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle
alegria y cosa buena

778
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,510
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena

779
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,850
# Hey, Macarena!

780
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,850
# Macarena tiene un novio
que se llama

781
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:09,600
# Y en la jura de bandera
del muchacho

782
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,190
# Se la dio con dos amigos

783
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:14,190
# Macarana tiene un novio
que se llama

784
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,610
# Que se llama de apellido Vitorino

785
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,570
# Y en la jura de bandera

786
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:20,570
# Se la dio con dos amigos

787
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,950
# Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena...

788
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,530
So? What do you think, then?

789
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,370
I don't think anything. Why?

790
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,040
Nothing.

791
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,870
I was just wondering, that's all.

792
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,830
There's nothing to wonder.
It's a business arrangement, that's all.

793
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,180
And his ship sails tomorrow, like he said.

794
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:46,850
Like he said.

795
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:52,600
(Music thumps)

796
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,280
Good God.

797
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,610
I can't drink all that.

798
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,740
No, but I know a man who can.

799
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:14,630
Cheers.

800
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,870
Since when did you start smoking those?

801
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:21,550
What happened to your roll-ups?

802
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,850
Oh, Jesus. Make my next one a double.

803
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,110
# When I was a young man

804
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:39,530
# I used to dream of a maiden...

805
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,570
That's my song.

806
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,070
# With long soft hair

807
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,830
# Blowing in the wind

808
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:57,170
# Her laughing eyes
and loving arms would follow

809
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,840
# When I'd sail around the world...

810
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,300
Hey, Frankie. Hey, Frankie.

811
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:09,730
I bet you all your trump cards
that you don't ask Catriona Murray to dance.

812
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:14,890
# I'd ride down on a great white horse...

813
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:19,320
If you do that, I'll get your mum up to dance.

814
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:22,190
Deal?

815
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,700
# I'd bring her laughter...

816
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,030
Dance?

817
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,580
# On a rainy day...

818
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,620
I never dance.

819
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:37,210
You'll have to this once.
Frankie's made another bet.

820
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,170
You'd better watch him.
It's becoming a bit of a habit.

821
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:55,890
# When I was a young girl,
I used to dream of a lover

822
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:05,730
# Who'd be my shining knight
of strength one day

823
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:12,530
# He'd take me to a castle in the heavens

824
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:22,200
# And battle all my dragons on the way

825
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:30,260
# And he'd ride down on a great white horse

826
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,140
# He'd give me love

827
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:38,690
# I'd been longing for

828
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:43,640
# He'd bring me joy

829
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:47,950
# And lasting peace

830
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:52,070
# And on a great white horse

831
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,040
# He'd ride away with me...

832
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:15,850
(Cheering and applause)

833
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:19,480
ALLY: Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

834
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:23,440
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!

835
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,860
(Laughter)

836
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:26,900
I had a good time tonight.

837
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:32,070
Don't sound so surprised.

838
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:37,410
You are the best!

839
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,460
He's got your eyes.

840
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,340
They pull you.

841
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:46,630
Right in.

842
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,670
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

843
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,720
I don't know what to say to that.

844
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:55,010
Well, you don't have to say anything.

845
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,270
You don't have to say nice things to me.

846
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:03,310
I'm not paying you for that.

847
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,730
So, why don't you want to hear them?

848
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,740
What are you afraid of?

849
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,120
Where did Marie find you?

850
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,870
No.

851
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,880
I thought we agreed: No history.

852
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,300
Things have changed.

853
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:39,720
Have they?

854
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:48,730
What I find really difficult...

855
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,190
to understand...

856
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,950
is why?

857
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:59,370
I told you why. Frankie made a bet.

858
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:02,000
No, no, no, no, no.

859
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,540
Why did he ever leave the two of you?

860
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,130
He didn't leave us. I left him.

861
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:21,890
One night I just picked Frankie up, and I left.

862
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:25,140
And my mother came with me,
to make sure I never went back.

863
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,730
And we've been leaving ever since.

864
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,860
<i>Always ready in case he shows up.</i>

865
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,780
Frankie wasn't born deaf.
It was a present from his daddy.

866
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,530
Frankie's a very... very lucky boy.

867
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,440
How do you figure that one out?

868
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,330
I'm his mother, and I lie to him every single day.

869
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,000
No.

870
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,710
No, you protect him every single day.

871
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,300
Do I?

872
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:50,440
Every time I write one of those letters
I promise myself it'll be the last one.

873
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,850
<i>I thought he'd lose interest, in time.</i>

874
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:57,530
<i>Just stop</i>

875
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,830
But see, if he hasn't written
for a couple of weeks,

876
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:06,200
I'm the one egging him on,
telling him to hurry up and write.

877
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:11,170
<i>It's the only way I can hear his voice.</i>

878
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,090
<i>I'd better go.</i>

879
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,300
I'm away first thing.

880
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,270
Can I say goodbye?

881
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,020
If you can wake him.

882
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,850
Hey.

883
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:59,350
(Uses voice) You're coming back?

884
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,950
I don't know, Frankie.

885
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,640
Did you do this?

886
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:44,400
Frankie, I can't take this. This... This is yours.

887
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:47,320
(Mouths)

888
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:55,160
I'd be honoured to take it.

889
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:59,500
It's beautiful.

890
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,470
Remember, Frankie.

891
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:15,810
We're all connected.

892
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,100
Lizzie, Lizzie.

893
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,230
I've let myself go a wee bit. Sorry.

894
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:56,410
It's been a long time.

895
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:03,250
You're still beautiful.

896
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,950
No, I'm not. I'm not beautiful.

897
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,840
I'm sorry.

898
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,090
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

899
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,890
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

900
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:20,140
Shush, Davey. Shush.

901
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:24,980
It's all right. It's all right now.

902
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,150
Don't cry.

903
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:35,650
Where's Frankie?

904
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,820
<i>He's at school.</i>

905
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:40,780
He's nine now, nearly ten.

906
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,450
Aye, I know.

907
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,370
He's top at geography.

908
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,790
I always knew he was clever.

909
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:55,300
Must take that off you.

910
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:59,250
I don't think so. You were the one
that could have gone to college.

911
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,630
I want to see him, Lizzie.

912
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,970
I've got a right to see him.

913
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:40,260
<i>- Don't give me that.
- It's too late for fighting.</i>

914
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:42,140
<i>Just let me see him.</i>

915
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:46,140
I want him to know how sorry I am.

916
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:49,980
He's my son.

917
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:52,020
He's not your son. He's mine.

918
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,610
You don't deserve him.

919
01:32:56,690 --> 01:32:59,530
You don't deserve his forgiveness.

920
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,700
Christ.

921
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,160
I made one mistake.

922
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,170
One stupid fucking mistake,
and you made me pay.

923
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,630
<i>You've made me pay, all right.</i>

924
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,800
You're a bitch.

925
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,970
<i>You're nothing but a bitch!</i>

926
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:25,750
I want to see my son!

927
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:29,810
<i>I've got a right!</i>

928
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,480
I'm his father!

929
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:33,230
<i>I've got rights!</i>

930
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:36,270
I've got my rights! I'm his father!

931
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,940
You're not his father!

932
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:41,280
He's got a different father now, a real father.

933
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:46,280
A kind, gentle man, who teaches him
to throw stones across the water.

934
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:48,200
You could never be his father.

935
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:50,250
I want to see my son!

936
01:33:50,330 --> 01:33:52,670
<i>- Davey, please, no, come on.
- I'm his father!</i>

937
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:53,860
Davey, no, stop it.

938
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,240
Nurse!

939
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:57,340
<i>Nurse!</i>

940
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:59,340
I want to see my son!

941
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,850
Lizzie, wait a minute.

942
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:19,780
Lizzie, Lizzie, please.

943
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,270
He nearly killed us, Janet!

944
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,450
I know. I know.

945
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:27,490
He's only got a few days left.

946
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,490
He can't touch you now.

947
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:32,290
Let him die in peace.

948
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,040
For your own sake.

949
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:12,160
I want to talk to you. It's very important.

950
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:16,290
I got a message today from your dad.

951
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:21,960
He's not very well, Frankie.

952
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,590
He's very, very sick.

953
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,800
But he says he wants you to know he loves you.

954
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:32,060
Very much.

955
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:08,260
<i>Dear Da, I thought you'd like this drawing.</i>

956
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:10,680
<i>I copied it from my book.</i>

957
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:13,170
<i>Ma says you're not very well.</i>

958
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:15,560
<i>I hope you feel better soon.</i>

959
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,600
<i>Love from your son, Frankie.</i>

960
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,760
<i>DOCTOR: OK, call the crash team.</i>

961
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,170
Please! What is wrong with him?

962
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:59,390
Let's get the bed down. Come on.

963
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,440
Mrs Morrison?

964
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,110
It might be best if you went
and had a cup of tea just now.

965
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:09,650
I'll send someone along to find you
as soon as we have any news.

966
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:12,700
This is for my husband.

967
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:15,330
It's from our son.

968
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:16,990
Right.

969
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,500
- Oh, Nurse, erm...
- Yes?

970
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,510
Could you make sure he sees it?

971
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:31,260
I'll make sure.

972
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:45,020
<i>LIZZIE: Davey Morrison
died peacefully after a long illness.</i>

973
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:47,110
<i>Father to Frankie.</i>

974
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:23,890
I know it's a terrible thing to say,
but Davey's finally done you a favour.

975
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,730
It's over now.

976
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:30,820
Marie?

977
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,180
What?

978
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,030
Who was he?

979
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,160
My brother.

980
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:42,870
Oh, right.

981
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,960
I've got to go.

982
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:52,920
- Where are you going?
- I'll see you after.

983
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:59,010
<i>MAN: Do you want me to check the box?</i>

984
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,060
<i>LIZZIE: There won't be anything in it.</i>

985
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:03,720
<i>It'll cost you to have your mail forwarded.</i>

986
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:06,520
I'll check it for you, hen,
just to be on the safe side.

987
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:57,280
<i>FRANKIE: Thanks for the book.</i>

988
01:39:57,370 --> 01:40:00,320
<i>I've read it all the way through now twice.</i>

989
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:04,080
<i>I took it into school.</i>

990
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,750
<i>I know you won't mind.</i>

991
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:07,870
<i>My teacher put it on the nature table.</i>

992
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:22,350
(Low whistle)

993
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:25,010
<i>Miss Mackenzie gave me a gold star.</i>

994
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:28,270
<i>I've got eight now. Catriona's got 20.</i>

995
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:31,690
<i>Ricky's only got one, and it's not even gold.</i>

996
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:40,240
<i>Guess what.</i>

997
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,200
<i>I got into the football team.</i>

998
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:45,370
<i>Well, the reserves. I'm playing on Saturday.</i>

999
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:47,950
<i>And guess what else.</i>

1000
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,210
<i>I got one wrong in geography this week.</i>

1001
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,340
<i>Ma and I had a bit of a shock last week.</i>

1002
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:01,340
<i>My da - my real da - he's been sick.</i>

1003
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:04,970
<i>I think he's been sick for a long time.</i>

1004
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:06,720
<i>Ma never said anything.</i>

1005
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:08,390
<i>But I just knew.</i>

1006
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,850
<i>And last week, he died.</i>

1007
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:14,190
<i>I think ma's very sad, inside.</i>

1008
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:16,190
<i>But Marie says time's a great healer,</i>

1009
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:20,200
<i>and Ma's not to worry any more,
cos she's still got me.</i>

1010
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,820
<i>Anyway, I've got to go now. My tea's ready.</i>

1011
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:26,200
<i>I hope it's not chips.</i>

1012
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:28,250
<i>I've had them three times this week.</i>

1013
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:33,080
<i>Maybe you'll come and see us one more time.</i>

1014
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,340
<i>Maybe next time your ship docks.</i>

1015
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:37,380
<i>Your friend, Frankie.</i>
