00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,166
At my aunt's house,
I was solitary and despised.

184
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:54,006
She thought I could do
without one bit of love or kindness.

185
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:56,932
You are loved.

186
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:02,541
There's an invisible world
all around you,

187
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:07,411
a kingdom of spirits
commissioned to guard you, Jane.

188
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:09,945
Do you not see them?

189
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:19,388
Jane?

190
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,969
Have you something for me to do?

191
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:26,100
You're doing something already.

192
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,539
May I see?

193
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:38,883
These are wonderful.

194
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:44,219
St. John...

195
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:45,916
No, Mary, please...

196
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:49,086
See how skilled Jane is.

197
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:57,599
Is this how you perceive me,
Miss Elliott?

198
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:05,709
Well. How fierce I am.

199
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:12,441
Jane.

200
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,587
You're freezing.
Your little feet are bare.

201
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:22,288
Come into bed and cover yourself.

202
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,129
(COUGHING)

203
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:34,330
How are you?

204
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:38,409
I'm happy, Jane.

205
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,008
I'm going home.

206
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,415
Back to your father?

207
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:48,546
I'm going to God.

208
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,949
Don't be sad.

209
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,994
You have a passion for living, Jane.

210
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:02,061
And one day you'll
come to the region of bliss.

211
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:11,740
Don't leave me.

212
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:14,742
I like to have you near.

213
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,613
I will not leave you.

214
00:19:23,924 --> 00:19:25,949
No one shall take me from you.

215

218
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:04,088

(CARRIAGE ROLLING AWAY)

220
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:31,354
Mr. Rivers? I wondered if you
had yet heard of any work I could do.

221
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,605
I found you a situation some time ago,
but I've delayed telling you

222
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:38,403
because the work is lowly
and I fear you'll scorn it.

223
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,829
I shan't mind what I do.

224
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:46,936
When I took over the parish
two years ago, it had no school.

225
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:51,667
I opened one for boys.
I now intend to open one for girls.

226
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,645
The schoolmistress will have
a cottage paid for by benefactors

227
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:57,911
and she'll receive ￡15 a year.

228
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:02,249
You can see how humble,
how ignoble it is.

229
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,287
Mr. Rivers, thank you.

230
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:05,552
I accept.

231
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:07,822
With all my heart.

232
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:09,189
But you comprehend me?

233
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,097
'Tis a village school,

234
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:17,533
What will you do
with all your fine accomplishments?

235
00:21:17,738 --> 00:21:20,901
I will save them
till they're wanted. They will keep.

236
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,264
ROCHESTER: Jane.

237
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:05,980
You will be quite alone here.

238
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:07,518
I'm not afraid of solitude.

239
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,224
This is my first home
where I am neither dependent

240
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:12,623
nor subordinate to anyone.

241
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:15,659
Thank you, Mr. St. John.

242
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:22,699
It is small and plain, as I told you.

243
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:25,932
Then it'll suit me very well.

244
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:44,085
GIRL: Safe journey, Miss Eyre. Godspeed.

245
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:46,258
Goodbye, Miss Eyre.

246
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,050
-Safe journey.
-Thank you.

247
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:49,520

248
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:50,621

DRlVER: Thornfield, Miss.

252
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:51,991
Wait here, Miss.

(DOOR OPENING)

254
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:19,742
How do you do, my dear?

255
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:22,448
-Are you Mrs. Fairfax?
-Indeed I am.

256
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:29,018
What a tedious journey
you must have had.

257
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:31,494
Your hands must be frozen. Here.

258
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:38,998
Goodness. How young you are.

259
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,308
I'm quite experienced, I can assure you.

260
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:44,869
Of course you are.
I'm sure we're very lucky to have you.

261
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:47,978
Leah, would you ask Martha
to bring a little hot port

262
00:24:48,048 --> 00:24:49,413
and cut a sandwich or two?

263
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:51,116
Draw nearer the fire.

264
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:54,318
John is taking your trunk
up to your room.

265
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:00,390
I've put you at the back of the house,
I hope you don't mind.

266
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:02,887
The rooms at the front have much
finer furniture,

267
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:06,194
but they're so gloomy
and solitary, I think.

268
00:25:07,468 --> 00:25:09,026
I'm glad you're come.

269
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,965
To be sure, this is a grand old house,

270
00:25:13,407 --> 00:25:17,002
but I must confess that in winter
one can feel a little dreary and alone.

271
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:22,406
Leah's a very nice girl, and John
and Martha are good people, too,

272
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,910
but they are servants.

273
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:28,454
One cannot talk to them
on terms of equality.

274
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,986
JANE: Am I meeting Miss Fairfax tonight?

275
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:35,392
Who?

276
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,657
Miss Fairfax, my pupil?

277
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:40,663
Oh, you mean Miss Varens,
Mr. Rochester's ward.

278
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:42,702
She's to be your pupil.

279
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,499
Who's Mr. Rochester?

280
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:49,605
Why, the owner of Thornfield.
Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester.

281
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:52,906
I thought Thornfield Hall
belonged to you.

282
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,313
Bless you, child, what an idea. Me?

283
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:58,183
I'm only the housekeeper.

284
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,617
Forgive me.

285
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:02,713
There is a distant connection
between Mr. Rochester and me,

286
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,191
his mother was a Fairfax,
but I'd never presume on it.

287
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:09,084
Heavens. Me, owner of Thornfield?

288
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:12,288
We shall have a cheerful
house this winter.

289
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:14,663
With Miss Varens here and with you,

290
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:17,067
we'll have quite a merry time of it.

291
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:18,109
I'm sure that last winter,

292
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:21,005
and what a severe one it was, 
if it didn't rain it snowed,

293
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:23,066
if it didn't snow it blew.

294
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:27,705
I declare, not one soul came to
the house from November to February.

295
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:29,407
When spring finally came,

295
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,048
I thought it a great relief
I hadn't gone distracted.

00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,384
I've never seen such
an ancient old house.

How beautifully you've preserved it.

306
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:47,153
Well, Mr. Rochester's visits
are always unexpected.

307
00:27:47,928 --> 00:27:50,158
He doesn't like to arrive and find
everything all swathed up,

308
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,721
so I keep it in constant readiness.

309
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:56,498
Now, come and meet Miss Varens.

713

I've put him in the morning room.

714
01:00:20,512 --> 01:00:22,412
Have I done wrong?

715
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:26,011
Bring him to my study.

716
01:00:35,193 --> 01:00:37,491
Jane, this is a blow.

If I were to go to those people

718
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,695
and they looked at me
coldly and sneered,

719
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:45,464
and then left me one by one,

720
01:00:45,537 --> 01:00:47,835
what would you do?
Would you go with them?

721
01:00:48,073 --> 01:00:49,768
No, sir. I'd stay with you.

722
01:00:53,912 --> 01:00:56,142
You'd dare condemnation for my sake?

723
01:00:57,149 --> 01:01:00,050

I'm here. Be composed. A servant

737
01:01:51,603 --> 01:01:52,934
I must see you back into your rooms

You showed no fear.

I cannot tell you.

787

For years, I've sought to escape it.

788
01:06:21,306 --> 01:06:25,766
This spring, I came home heart-sore
and soul-withered.

789
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:29,579
And I met a gentle stranger
whose society revives me.

790
01:06:30,715 --> 01:06:33,149
With her, I feel I could live again

791
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:34,548
in a higher, purer way.

792
01:06:37,088 --> 01:06:38,112
Tell me,

793
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:42,225
am I justified in overleaping an
obstacle of custom to attain her?

794
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:46,792
There is an obstacle?

795
01:06:47,532 --> 01:06:49,830
A mere conventional impediment.

796
01:06:50,568 --> 01:06:52,695
But what can it be?

797
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:54,169
If you cherish an affection, sir,

798
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:56,366
then fortune alone cannot impede you.

799
01:06:58,076 --> 01:06:59,304

801
01:07:01,379 --> 01:07:04,212
and has indicated that
she may reciprocate...

Jane, of whom do you think I speak?

803
01:07:10,522 --> 01:07:12,422
Of Miss Ingram.

804
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,996
I'm asking what Jane Eyre would do
to secure my happiness?

805
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:21,394
I would do anything for you, sir.

Anything that was right.

807
01:07:25,803 --> 01:07:27,737

808
01:07:31,976 --> 01:07:34,274
I feel I can speak to you now

809
01:07:34,345 --> 01:07:35,607
of my lovely one,

810
01:07:36,347 --> 01:07:38,975
for you've met her and you know her.

811
01:07:39,951 --> 01:07:42,078
She's a rare one, isn't she?

812
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:44,511
Fresh and healthy,

813
01:07:45,857 --> 01:07:47,950

814
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,999
I'm sure she'll regenerate me
with a vengeance.
