the earthbound body</i>

<i>and soar with it into heaven.</i>

109
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,926
<i>When we see a beautiful woman, or a man...</i>

110

<i>the soul remembers the beauty
it used to know in heaven.</i>

111
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,651
<i>And wings begin to spout,
and that makes the soul want to fly,</i>

112
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,451
<i>but it cannot yet.
It is still too weak.</i>

113

Teddy gets who he wants.

- That's my brother, Rick.
- How are ya?

181
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,289
(Barry) What's goin' on, now? Anything.
Same today?

182
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,364
Don't know how many times
I thought I'd die right here on the street.

183
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,571
I picked him up and I had him
in my car, and a cop pulled us over.

184
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,124
I tell him, "I'm a Methodist minister
and I'm looking after you, alright?"

185
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,850
And I got off.

186
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,129
(players laughing
and chatting indistinctly)

187
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,451
<i>(Rick) I dreamed that we were caught in
a huge tidal wave that engulfed the city.</i>

188
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,163
<i>Any moment I! seemed like
we might be swept under.</i>

189
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,689
<i>There was a door
that I was afraid to go through.</i>

190
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,966
<i>- I touched the knob...
- (Barry) If I stuck you with a fork,</i>

191
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,770
<i>(Barry) Just wanna feel somethin', man.</i>

192
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,323
<i>Wish we could do some things.</i>

193
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,681
<i>Like gain' out on the Snake River together.
Remember?</i>

194
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,562
<i>Think I'd end up here.</i>

195
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,445
<i>Gracias.</i>

196
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,566

197
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,761
It's good of you to invite me out here.

198
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,490
(loud slap)

199
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,685
Show me what it's like
to live a normal life.

200
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,127
(loud slaps)

201
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,323
(Barry) Somethin' wrong?

202
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,170

203
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,890
(chuckles)

204
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,130
What's up?

205
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,403
I can tell when somethin's wrong, man.
I know you.

206
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,691
(Barry) What do you wanna talk about?

207
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,523
I'm the only brother you got left.
You can tell me.

208
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,970
I tell you stuff.

209
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,928
<i>(Rick) I loved my brother then.</i>

210
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,250
<i>I hated him, too.</i>

211
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,963
<i>For destroying everything
I'd been trying to do.</i>

212
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,327
<i>To build us back up after Billy died.</i>

213
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,211
I remember when they were putting Billy
in the ground, Dad went into hysterics.

214
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,330
"My son!"

215
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,570
Who fucking does that?

216
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,201
<i>(Rick) They said he took his life.</i>

217
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,450
<i>But they don't know.</i>

218
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,921
(Barry) Oh, right now. Come on.

219
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,210
I gotta feel something.

220
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,970
<i>(Rick) Like a snake.</i>

221
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,445
<i>Swallowed him.</i>

222
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,165
Come on, feel it.

00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,290
<i>Didn't have the guts.</i>

229
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,963
<i>(Rick) He's just an old fool.</i>

230
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,807

Thank you.

273

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,364
What's going on with you?

354
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,483
(Nancy) You used to sing in the morning
coming down the stairs.

355
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,769
I meant to make you happy.
I wanted nothing else.

356
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,691
But then you began to be angry with me...

357
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,644
just for little things.

358
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,529
<i>(Nancy) I don't wanna accuse you,
bu! you turned more unkind toward me.</i>

359
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,450
<i>Almost cruel.</i>

360
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,530
Just don't threaten me with leaving, okay?

361
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,370
Just do what you wanna do!

362
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,764
Just go!

363
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,642
(leaf blower howling)

364
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,442
(howling)

365
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,402
(Rick, whispering) <i>Stay.</i>

366
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,810
<i>I want you.</i>

367
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,770
<i>Hold you.</i>

368
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,531
<i>Have you.
Mine.</i>

369
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,369
<i>(Nancy) Are you sorry
we didn't have babies?</i>

370
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,370
<i>(Nancy) I am.</i>

371
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,009
(toy laughs mechanically)

372
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,203
<i>(Nancy) Got started so late.</i>

373
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,288
(low, heavy string music)

374
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,046
<i>(Nancy) You wanted me to help you
through the dangers of a young man's life.</i>

375
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,410
<i>Ambition.</i>

376
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,765
<i>Fear.</i>

377
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,649
When was the last time
you took these boots off?

378
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,411
(inaudible)

379
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,003
<i>(Nancy) I think you were afraid
of going astray.</i>

380
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,530
<i>I couldn't help you stay on the right path.</i>

381
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,762
(inaudible)

382
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,370
<i>Your head was turned
in the wrong direction.</i>

383
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,527
Can you move all your fingers?

384
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,360
Yeah, they look a little bit bruised.

385
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,242
(string music continues)

386
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,363
<i>(Nancy) You never really wanted
to be totally inside our marriage.</i>

387
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,204
<i>Nor outside it, either.</i>

388
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,250
<i>You were sincere in the promises you made.</i>

389
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,250
<i>Still... they didn't come from your heart.</i>

390
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,081
<i>(Rick) I was afraid when I was young.</i>

391
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,245
<i>Afraid of life.</i>

392
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,770
<i>Who pays for it.</i>

393
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,722
<i>I'm sorry you had to pay as well.</i>

394
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,690
(child babbling)

395
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,844
(Rick, whispering) My <i>hope.</i>

396
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,244
<i>(Rick) You gave me peace.</i>

397
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,886
<i>You gave me what the world can't give.</i>

398
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,890
<i>(string music:
"Solveig's Song" by E. Grieg)</i>

399
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,605
<i>Mercy.</i>

400
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,050
<i>Love.</i>

401
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,490
<i>Joy.</i>

402
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,210
<i>All else is cloud.</i>

403
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,810
<i>Mist.</i>

404
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,570
<i>Be with me.</i>

405
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,925
<i>Always.</i>

406
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,042
(Solveig's Song continues)

407
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,082
(music ends)

408
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,445
<i>(Nancy) You 're still the love of my life.</i>

409
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,010
<i>Should I tell you that?</i>

410
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,682
(agent 1) Drinking is bad.
Bu! feelings are worse.

411
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,526
Sober girls are the worst,
but so are really drunk ones.

412
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,723
The sweet spot is one xanie,
four white wines.

413
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,842
<i>(agent 2) If you're not first in line,
you're smelling somebody else's brown eye.</i>

414
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,570
<i>(man) Balls deep.</i>

415
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,245
(men laugh)

416
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,001
(agent 2) Living my life is like
playing Call oi Duty on easy.

417
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,128
I just go around and fuck shit up.

418
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,290
<i>(Herb) Why don't we take
"yes" for an answer.</i>

419
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,451
(Herb) Let me tell you about you.

420
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,489
You worked long and hard
to get to this moment.

421
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,765
Mountain air.

422
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,208
Freedom.
What are you gonna do?

423
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,207
Crawl back down because
you don't like the altitude?

424
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,681
You have an incomparable opportunity.

425
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,844
I told you about you.

426
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,522
Now let me tell you about me.

427
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,045
I wanna make you rich.

428
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,930
Is there anyone you wanna sit
in a room with?

429
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,322
<i>(Herb) Is there anyone you wanna know?
You wanna climb your stairs, or theirs?</i>

430
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,562
(woodwind music)

431
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,685
<i>Never get your shot.</i>

432
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,645
<i>Your time on Earth.</i>

433
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,803
<i>AH you need to do is say yes.</i>

434
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,285
<i>Nod.</i>

435
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,965
<i>Wink.</i>

436
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,724
<i>Where else will you go?</i>

437
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,842
<i>It'll be the same there.</i>

438
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,845
<i>Don't get your head
too far up your own ass.</i>

439
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,328
<i>(Joseph) Once people envied
and respected me.</i>

440
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,050
They called me in.

441
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,525
Give me your ID's.

442
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,567
Give me your...
give me your pass to open the doors.

443
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,245
They have a checklist.

444
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,522
(helicopter sounds)

445
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,805
They didn't count the pros
and cons... (drowned out by noise)

446
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,806
I gave my life up for you kids.

447
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,841
It wasn't a noble sacrifice.
It was what we were supposed to do.

448
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,122
It was the way I was raised.

449
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,042
(inaudible)

450
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,644
Try starving once! I've tried it.
I've done it!

451
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,169
Now ifs all over. Now it's leaving me.
Now it's going away from me.

452
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,407
<i>(Joseph) You think when you reach a
certain age things will start making sense.</i>

453
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,126
<i>Then you find out you're
just as last as you were before.</i>

454
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,651
<i>I suppose that's what damnation is.</i>

455
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,324
<i>The pieces of your life
never to some together.</i>

456
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,006
<i>Just splashed out there.</i>

457
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:09,329
<i>(narrator) His goods are in peace. Bu! when
a stranger than he shall came upon you...</i>

458
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,201
<i>(man, echoing) This was a vision,</i>

459
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,365
<i>nice and
clear as a mountain stream.</i>

460
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,880
<i>The mind revealing itself to itself.</i>

461
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,121
<i>In my vision
I was on the verandah of a vast estate,</i>

462
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,648
<i>a palazzo of some fantastic proportion.</i>

463
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:45,002
<i>There seemed to emanate from it a light
from within this gleaming, radiant marble.</i>

464
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,447
(man yelling in German)

465
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,443
(woman) That's good, that's good.

466
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,045
Tuck.
Relax your mouth.

467
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,885
(man nagging in German)

468
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,482
Who is responsible for this clothing?
Who is it?

469
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,605
- (man) Can you step out of the wind?
- (woman) Stop smiling.

470
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,011
(man) And don't move too fast.

471
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,044
They didn't take eighty.
Doesn't matter.

472
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,450
<i>(Rick) I had a dream.</i>

473
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,802
(man) Don't stare at me like this.

474
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,651
<i>(Rick) I meta woman from another world.</i>

475
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,802
<i>I was taken up above the earth.</i>

476
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,765
<i>I shook with fear.</i>

477
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,325
<i>Wonder.</i>

478
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,808
(woman) Lean into her.
Put your breasts against her back.

479
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,646
Don't look sweet. Don't look scared.
You like this, Helen.

480
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,085
<i>(Rick) Who are you?</i>

481
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:06,805
(woman) Look into the camera. Fucking make
ii hard. You're a dirty, fucking bitch.

482
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,330
Work those muscles. You're a 1975 housewife
who takes steroids and fucks girls.

483
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,410
<i>(Helen) I travel.</i>

484
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,290
<i>A wanderer.</i>

485
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,170
<i>A stranger.</i>

486
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,090
<i>Like you.</i>

487
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,491
(woman) Stop, take your hands off your hip.

488
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,205
Hit her hard, pop.

489
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,441
<i>(Helen) I keep thinking
I can make a new start.</i>

490

Two weeks.

00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,202

(crickets chirping)

494
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,728
(Rick) Higher.

495
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,643
Is this a friendship we have?

496
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,484
I don't wanna wreak havoc
in men's lives anymore.

497

498

<i>(Rick) Oh life.</i>

499
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,808
<i>(Helen) What do you want from me?</i>

500
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,044
<i>To weave a spell over you?</i>

501
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,130
<i>To make you dream?</i>

502
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,604
<i>Dreams are nice.</i>

503
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,009
<i>But you can't Jive in them.</i>

504
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,091
(string music: Solveig's Song)

505
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,885
<i>(Helen) There's somewhere else
we needle get to.</i>

506
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,610
<i>I know it.</i>

<i>(Joseph) It comes to me now.</i>

510
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,127
How tenderly you touched my face...

511
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,723
<i>when you were four years old.</i>

512
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,243
<i>And I'd bounce you on my knee.</i>

513
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,525
<i>So much I was given.</i>

514
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,601
<i>So much I left behind.</i>

537

552
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:02,566
- Keep looking.
- What kind of jacket is that? Take it off.

553
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,200
Take it off. Whoa, careful.

Whatever you want it to be.
You pick.

576
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,485
You have a darkness on you.

577
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,730
A little shadow.

578
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,329
You live in a little fantasy world,
don't you?

579
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,770
Don't you?

580
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,651
Yes. Because ifs so much more fun.

<i>Do you enjoy yours?</i>

582
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:47,290
Uh-huh. Changes every day.
I can be whatever I want to be.

583
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,561
Don't forget that.
You can be whoever you want to be.

584
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,685
You can be an asshole.

585

You can be a saint,

<i>Wake up.</i>

596
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,686
(Karen) Love danger.
Like living on the edge like this.

597
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,571
It's crazy, ifs scary.
What if I get busted?

598
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,725
Look at you with your little
eyes looking at me. (laughs)

599
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,204
Sometimes I think I know so much more
about the world than other people.

600
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:09,606
You see, I took drugs once, and it kind of
opened up this window for me.

601
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,723
I call it the Window of Truth.

602
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,042
<i>(Karen) Real life's so hard to find.</i>

603
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,363
I saw the world in a different way...

01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,930
<i>Where is it?</i>

605
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,531
I see things other people do not...

606
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,601
I think you had that experience, too.

607
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,330
<i>How do you get there?</i>

608
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,801
<i>Get out of the big cloud of dust
everybody's kicking up.</i>

609
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,242
<i>The only way out is in.</i>

610
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,730
<i>Breathe.</i>

<i>Why not?</i>

615
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,888
<i>(Rick) Then I tell back asleep.</i>

616

(Walt) Very loving and enchanting.
Most affectionate.

628
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,970
Real nice to get along.

629
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,929
(Karen) Very beautiful.

630
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:58,008
I like your outfit, too, especially the
boots. Now they're a touch of class.

631
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,481
(Karen) Are you a religious man?

632
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,401
- You have a cross around your neck.
- (Wall) Absolutely.

633
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,162
Oh, even though I'm in darkness,
I believe in the light.

634
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,491
I was instructed from some information

635
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,723
to be no part of the world
nor of the things in it.

636
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,363
But my eyes are now simple,
and I'm carnal when I see beautiful women

637
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:26,206
and big cars and lots of money,
and I wanna be a part of it.

638

(Karen) I mean, who needs a bed
this big? Pretty good, huh?

639
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,685
Look at you,

640
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,568
hanging out there with your girls and your
money. Are you feeling happy?

641
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,489
- Yes.
- It makes you happy?

642
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:48,561
- (man) It depends who owns the money.
- It's my new fur. He bought it for me.

643
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,769
This man is in love with me.

644
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,649
Just some other girl.

645
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,370

- Hi.

(Karen) I thought you were dead.

653
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,964
- I can't believe I actually met Elvis.
- You never know in this town.

654
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,721
That's my move.
Do you think I'll be as famous as Elvis?

<i>(Elizabeth) You're afraid

<i>But the vow comes out

<i>Love's so rare that when you find it</i>

<i>(Christopher) I remember when

<i>if not enlightened,
at least wiser than I had been.</i>

690
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:08,600
You have to kneel in a certain way and
you have to bow at the appropriate time.

691
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:13,448
And it's all beautifully timed,
even the sound of when they announce...

692
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,045
We walked 250 miles over the mountains,

693
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,567
into Tibet area.

694
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,370
And every... couple days,

695
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,045
every 20 miles or so,

696
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,805
you knew you were
going back in history, in time...

697
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,122
(indistinct)

698
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,404
But don't forget
their life is so circumscribed.

699
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:59,169
If you're living in a cave eating nettles,
it's not so difficult to keep life simple.

700
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:05,489
You don't have honking horns and your wife
running in saying "You screwed up!"

701
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:11,164
The distractions are very few, and that's
the great attraction of the monk's life.

702
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:16,406
<i>(Christopher)
Teaching now... I only teach one thing.</i>

703
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,647
<i>I just teach this moment.</i>

704
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,006
<i>Pay attention to this moment.</i>

705
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,563
<i>And everything is there...</i>

706
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,730
<i>perfect...</i>

707
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,810
<i>and complete.</i>

708
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,405
<i>Just as it is.</i>

709
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,166
(rattling of countless marbles)

710
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,328
(Elizabeth) You're so <i>quiet.</i>

711
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,687
<i>You keep everything to yourself.</i>

712
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,050
<i>You have love in you.</i>

713
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,610
<i>I know it.</i>

714
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,810
<i>When I'm with you...</i>

715
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,168
<i>I forget everything else.</i>

716
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,688
<i>My husband...</i>

717
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,370
<i>my life as I knew it.</i>

718
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:58,561
(recording) Thumb, first finger, third
finger, left, fourth finger, third finger,

719
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:05,842
<i>second finger, thumb, right hand, thumb,
first finger, second finger, thumb...</i>

720
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,690
<i>(Rick) Have I found you?</i>

721
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,530
<i>Can it be?</i>

722
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,402
(high Milan music)

723
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,808
(rock music on radio)

724
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,642
(high organ music continues)

725
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,642
(she squeals with joy)

726
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,322
(waves crashing)

727
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,330
<i>(Rick) Answer me.</i>

728
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,730
<i>So this is what we are.</i>

729
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,245
<i>A fire.</i>

730
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,725
(hoots)

731
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,925
(splash)

732
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,050
<i>(Rick) Come with me.</i>

733
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,610
<i>Away.</i>

734
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,842
(slow string music)

735
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,122
(music ends abruptly)

736
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,965
Open your mouth.

737
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,405
(she laughs)

738
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,647
<i>(Rick) I wanna go away with you.</i>

739
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,650
<i>Marry you.</i>

740
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,526
<i>(Rick) Save what you can of your life.</i>

741
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,250
<i>Look at me.</i>

742
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,322
(breathes heavily)

743
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,409
<i>Don't lose it all
just because you've lost a part.</i>

744
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,006
<i>(Elizabeth) I found out! was pregnant.</i>

745
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,644
<i>Nate came back.</i>

746
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:13,644
<i>And I wasn't sure if it was my husband's...</i>

747
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,928
(inaudible)

748
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,210
<i>or if it was yours.</i>

749
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,368
(she sobs)

750
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:39,171
<i>to distract me right now</i>

751
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,601
<i>but I wanted to tell you, to...</i>

752
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,443
acknowledge that it was...

753
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,885
I wake up and...

754
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,883
I forget about it
for a few minutes and then...

755
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,565
(exhales)

756
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,529
and then I remember.

757
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:14,126
She's like "I had four of them.
You have to get over it and stop crying."

758
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,883
<i>(Elizabeth) What are we now?</i>

759
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,202
(melancholic string music)

760
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,005
<i>(Rick) Forgive me.</i>

761
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,642
(music fades out)

762
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,562
(faint string music)

763
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:26,450
<i>(Rick) There's so much lave inside us.</i>

764
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,285
<i>That never gets out.</i>

765
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,484
<i>(Joseph) Have mercy an me.</i>

766
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,687
<i>According to your unfailing love,</i>

767
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,207
<i>your great compassion,</i>

768
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,845
<i>blot out my transgressions.</i>

769
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,648
(car engine)

770
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,130
(Joseph) <i>My</i> son,

771
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,010
<i>I know you.</i>

772
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,203
<i>I know you have a soul.</i>

773
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,882
(faint string music)

774
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,487
(Fr. Zeitlinger) <i>Seems you're alone.</i>

775
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,685
<i>You're not.</i>

776
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:26,644
<i>Even now,
He's taking your hand and guiding you</i>

777
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,370
<i>by a way you cannot see.</i>

778
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:34,649
If you are unhappy, you shouldn't
take it as a mark of God's disfavor.

779
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:40,962
Just the contrary.
Might be the very sign He loves you.

780
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:45,808
He shows His love
not by helping you avoid suffering,

781
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:49,169
by sending you suffering,

782
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,530
<i>by keeping you there.</i>

783
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:01,087
To suffer binds you to something
higher than yourself,

784
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,288
higher than your own will.

785
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,283
Takes you from the world

786
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:09,363
to find what lies beyond it.

787
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,642
(slow string music)

788
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:18,766
<i>(Fr. Zeitlinger) We are not only to endure
patiently the troubles He sends,</i>

789
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,922
<i>we are to regard them as gifts.</i>

790
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,249
<i>As gifts more precious</i>

791
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:31,204
<i>than the happiness we wish for ourselves.</i>

792
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,730
(loud smash)

793
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,962
(indistinct screaming)

794
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,647
(loud smash)

795
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,323
<i>(Rick) Just left you behind.</i>

796
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:57,644
<i>To get burned up.</i>

797
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,122
(slow string music continues)

798
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,487
(train noises)
(music fades out)

799
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,685
<i>(Rick) Haw do I begin?</i>

800
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:30,202

801

01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,765
<i>(Rick) Father.</i>

<i>Strength.</i>

805
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,089
<i>(Joseph) I'm proud of you.</i>

806
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,925
<i>You've done well.</i>

807
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,609
<i>Better than me.</i>

808
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,241
<i>Which is the way it's supposed to be.</i>

<i>(Joseph) Find the light

812
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,484
<i>As a child.</i>

813
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,565
<i>The moon.</i>

814
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,645
<i>The stars.</i>

01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,363
<i>They serve you.</i>

816
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,362
<i>They guide you on your way.</i>

817
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:10,246
<i>The light in the eyes of others.</i>

818
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,570
<i>The pearl.</i>
