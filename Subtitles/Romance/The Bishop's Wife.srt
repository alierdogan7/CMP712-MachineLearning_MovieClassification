172
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,585
It would be completely out of sight.
I won't stand for it.

173
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,003
Mrs. Hamilton, this cathedral cannot be
designed for the glory of an individual.

174
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,047
It has to be created for all the people.

175
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,925
I'm very displeased at your attitude,
Henry Brougham.

176
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,389
I was instrumental
in having you made bishop...

177
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,429
...although others
thought you too young.

178
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,475
- Is that an exaggeration?
- Oh, yes, Mrs.-- I mean, no.

179
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,940
- You were the guiding spirit.
- I distinctly remember that you told--

180
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,778
I had confidence in you when you
were a poor little parson in the slums.

181
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,942
I confess my confidence is weakened.

182
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,031
I regret
I've been such a disappointment.

183
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,493
HAMILTON: Regrets and apologies
are no good whatsoever.

184
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:53,035
You give me the impression of being
confused, indecisive and ineffectual.

185
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,456
That is not the kind of leadership
we expect of our bishop.

186
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,340
You better remember one thing.

187
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,798
You will build that cathedral as I want it,
or you will not build it at all.

188
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,179
That's all I have to say.

189
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,641
Someone get this dog out of the way.

190
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,268
HENRY: Julia.
- Queenie.

191
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,646
Good night, Mrs. Hamilton.

192
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,227
- Good night.
WARD: Good evening.

193
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,483
PERRY:
Good evening, Mrs. Brougham.

194
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,895
Good evening, Mrs. Brougham.

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,162
- Can we serve dinner now, ma'am?
- Yes, Matilda.

196
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,327
The chicken will be burned to a crisp.

197
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,246
We'll be right in.

198
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,177
Julia, you knew that Mrs. Hamilton
was expected here this afternoon.

199
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,678
I know, Henry.

200
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,088
I'm sorry I was late.

201
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,975
What a ghastly afternoon.
What a ghastly woman.

202
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,182
I have no intention of being strangled
by her purse strings.

203
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,846
She did and I was proud of you.

204
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,812
I had a most un-Christian impulse
to take those blueprints...

205
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,569
...and give her a good whack
over the mink coat.

206
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,729
I thought you stood up to her
magnificently.

207
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,525
I appreciate your appreciation,
but what about my cathedral?

208
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,694
May I make a suggestion, Henry?

209
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,034
Why not postpone the cathedral?
Forget it until after Christmas.

210
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,041
Impossible.
The house of God can't just be put off.

211
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,044
This cathedral must rise.
Plenty of rich people in this town.

212
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,376
If I had to enlist their financial
enthusiasm...

213
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,917
...I shall have to take advantage
of their Yuletide spirit.

214
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,550
Oh, I can see it all now.

The McVVhithers, the Homes,
the Van Deusens.

The luncheons, committee meetings.
And you, you there, ﬂattering them...

217
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,389
...kowtowing to them, begging them.
- it's got to be done.

218
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,897
Oh, Henry, if you could see
your poor harassed face.

219
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,057
- You haven't done much to help it.
- Why--?

220
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,851
Yes, Miss Cassaway, what is it?

221
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,236
Mr. Trevor on the phone.
He says it's urgent.

222
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:47,115
- Tell him the bishop will call him back.
- Yes, Mrs. Brougham.

223
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,948
Henry, what's happened to you?

224
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,238
What's happened to us
and our marriage?

225
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,579
We used to have such fun,
you and Debby and I.

226
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,711
We used to be happy,
we used to make other people happy.

227
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,542
Oh, Henry, that was your gift.

228
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,798
You're no financier
and you're not a promoter.

229
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,879
You can't see
beyond the end of your nose.

230
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,921
I want this cathedral to stand
like a beacon. Its light to--

231
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:13,342
Oh, never mind, Henry, never mind.
Keep that for your next committee meeting.

232
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,100
Here's a contribution I collected.

233
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,646
What's that?

234
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,687
It's an old Roman coin.
Professor Wutheridge sent it to you.

235
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,946
Wasn't it sweet of him?

236
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,608
The old fool.
What does he think I can do with that?

237
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,619
Well, it's a beginning.

238
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,201
And now all you need
is another 4 million.

239
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,662
Julia, don't be flippant about this.

240
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,963
- Is dinner ready?
- Yes.

241
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,550
Let's go in and get it over with.
I have a lot of work to do.

242
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,309
For what we are about to receive,
make us thankful.

243
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,065
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,927
- Julia.
- Yes?

245
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,346
I was just thinking...

246
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,349
...tomorrow maybe we could
go out together.

247
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,676
Where?

248
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,348
Oh, just walk around the way we used to.

249
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,775
We could go and call on the professor...

250
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,609
...go to the park and watch the skaters,
that sort of thing.

251
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,989
Maybe we could have lunch together...

252
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,367
...at Michel's. You remember that?

253
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,361
Michel's.

254
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,324
Oh, it's been years
since we've been there.

255
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,870
Please forgive me. I've been
trying to explain to Mr. Trevor...

256
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,381
...but he insists upon speaking to you
personally, bishop.

257
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,337
Excuse me, darling.

Matilda, will you keep the soup warm,
please?

Tell Delia we'll be out for lunch tomorrow.

I appreciate your difficulties--

But--

00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,398
Oh, very well, I'll be there.

at the Banker's Club at 11.

00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,371
- Yes, sir. Tomorrow, Thursday.
- You might as well go home now.

00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,667
- There's a great deal of work, sir.
- Never mind. You must be tired.

Oh, thank you, sir.

Who told you I asked for help?

Well, you are known to be a good man,
Henry, and you were heard.

I was instructed to come here
in answer to your prayer.

- I'm an angel.

No wings at the moment, but...

297
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,119
You're an angel.

I knew it. I've been working too hard--

00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,924
I understand, Henry.
It's hard to believe, even for you.

Well, how can I?
I've only got your word for it.

00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,620
Now you're gonna be with Henry
permanently?

338
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,335
For as long as may be necessary.

339
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,171
If you don't mind,
I must talk to this gentleman alone.

340
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,302
- I'll see you in a moment.
- Sure.

341
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,340
Oh, we were just having dinner,
won't you join us?

342
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,680
That's very kind of you,
but I have things to do around town.

343
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,347
You can understand, Henry,
so many people making so many mistakes.

344
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,889
Yes, I see.

345
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,353
Then we'll see you tomorrow?

346
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,189
- Oh, yes, bright and early.
- Good.

347
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,650
Whenever you're ready, Henry.

348
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,698
Good night, Dudley.

349
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,734
Good night, Julia.

350
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,867
Are you sure you're an angel?

351
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,208
I know it isn't easy, Henry,
but you've just got to take me on faith.

352
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,874
- Yes, for how long? How long will it take?
- For just long enough...

353
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:47,637
...until you can utter another prayer and say
that you have no further need of me.

354
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,050
Then I'll be gone and forgotten.

355
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,969
But now Julia is waiting for you
at the dining table.

356
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,137
You must go to her.

357
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,101
Yes.

358
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,901
But I don't--

359
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,070
- Henry.
- Yes?

360
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,732
What's the rest of Dudley's name?

361
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,159
I don't know.

362
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,619
Are you nervous, dear?

363
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,121
No.

364
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,107
Why, the bishop didn't
eat his breakfast.

365
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,268
No. He took only his prune juice.

366
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,653
Prune juice?
What's the matter? Is he sick?

367
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:32,067
Oh, he looked perfectly awful.
He said he had a very bad, sleepless night.

368
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,286
Passing up a breakfast like that.

369
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,242
It just ain't normal.

370
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,330
Nobody expects him to be normal,
he's a bishop.

371
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,389
If I could get you something, sir?

372
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,765
No, thank you, Matilda.

373
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,928
- Maybe just a cup of tea?
- Nothing, thank you.

374
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,102
- Good morning, Miss Cassaway.
- Good morning, bishop.

[SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]

376
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,569
Did anything come in
for the cathedral fund?

377
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,447
Mr. and Mrs. J. Thurston Ward,
no contribution.

378
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,700
- Mrs. Gerald Wilmarth, $15.
- Fifteen dollars?

379
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,861
We had her down for 10,000.

380
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,076
CASSAWAY: There's a letter
from her explaining that--

381
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,082
I know. The same letter they all write.

382
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,041
I put the personal mail on the desk, bishop.
The rest I'm taking to the office.

383
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,751
I'll be there after the meetings.

384
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,116
Oh, Matilda,
I think there's someone at the door.

00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,119
Yes, sir.

386
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,499
Good morning, Matilda.
I'm Dudley, the bishop's new assistant.

387
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,751
Good morning, Henry.
It's a wonderful morning.

388
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,084
I'm a little late, but I stopped to chat
with a traffic policeman...

389
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,374
...who was worried about his wife.

390
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,418
Oh, thank you. Thank you, dear.

391
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,087
I directed traffic

- I see.
- She's doing fine. So is the baby.

Why, you must be Mildred Cassaway.

- We're going to be working together.
CASSAWAY: That's very nice.

396
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,772
Oh, thank you.

397
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,938
- Thank you very much.
DUDLEY: See you later, Mildred.

398
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,071

Oh, good morning, Dudley.
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,971
- Lovely.
- Henry and I are going out together.

405
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,637
I'm terribly sorry,
but I have some appointments.

- You what?
- Mr. Trevor, I gotta see him and then...

407
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,274
...the board meeting, junior assembly.

408
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,186
- But don't you remember? You promised--
- Yeah, I know I did.

409
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,152
Well, Dudley could represent you
at those meetings, couldn't he?

410
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,908
Could I?

411
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:24,786
No, out of the question. They expect me.
It would never do if I sent an assistant.

412
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,834
Excuse me.

413
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,329
Now--

414
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:42,507
- You see, the trouble is I can't explain.
- You needn't try to explain, Henry.

415
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,392
- This is the way it is and will always be.
- What--?

to believe in me, huh?

- Obviously, that's the most important thing.

Yes. How did you know?

437
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,786
Mommy told me.
She said you came to help Daddy.

That's right.

Well, that's extremely kind of Mommy.

maybe we'll get to see Daddy sometimes.

on a tray for you.

Thank you, Julia. 
I'll get along very well.

- Oh, it's very cold out.

Oh, well, the cold never affects me. I--

451
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,575
I think you should wear this anyway.

452
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,083
- I bought it for the bishop last Christmas.
- Well. Really?

453
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,085
- But he's never worn it.
- Oh, it's a lovely scarf, Matilda.

454
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,496

when he sees it on me.

00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,859
It's a chronic disease
and it's incurable.

667
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,029
Once I was madly--

668
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,415
Once I was madly in love with a girl.

669
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,797
My friends, she was a vision of delight.

670
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,837
- A pure enchantress.
- Why, you've never told me about that.

671
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,301
No, that's just the trouble.

672
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,056
I never told her about it either.
I couldn't find the words.

673
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,846
So she married an athlete.

674
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:52,689
A great hulking oaf
who never even reached the eighth grade.

675
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,488
But he knew how to say, "I love you."

676
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:03,202
Same trouble as my book,
can't find the words.

677
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,162
Even when you had this coin
to inspire you?

678
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:12,212
Why, that's the one
that you gave to Henry, professor.

679
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,998
Yes, I stole it off the table.

680
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,213
You wasted your time, Dudley.
It's worthless.

681
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,596
Oh, on the contrary, this is one
of the rarest of all antiquities.

682
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:26,101
Only 100 of these coins were minted
by Julius Caesar 2000 years ago.

683
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,432
That was when Cleopatra visited Rome.

684
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,564
Presumably, these coins were used
to pay her hotel bill.

685
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,769
I never knew that.

686
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,437
No, nobody knew about it
except Caesar's wife.

687
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,946
- She was suspicious?
- Definitely.

688
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:43,156
She did not share her husband's
admiration for Cleopatra.

689
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,913
So she had these coins destroyed,
melted into ornaments for herself.

690
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,165
This is the one she missed.

691
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:54,671
It's an unwritten chapter in history,
and you, professor, will write it.

692
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,957
Do you know more stories like that?

693
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,799
Oh, any number of them.

694
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,927
You're a curious fellow, Dudley.

695
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,384
Have you just begun to notice that?

696
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,765
What's your background?

697
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:10,221
- Uh, my background?
- Well, where do you come from?

698
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,810
- Well...
- And don't tell me any more about Vienna...

699
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,270
...I won't believe it.

700
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,433
All right.

701
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,569
Supposing I told you I came
from another planet. You believe me?

702
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,153
- I don't know.
- I'd believe you, Dudley.

703
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,488
And you'd be right, Julia, as always.

704
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,699
We all come from our own little planets.

705
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:30,411
That's why we're all different.
That's what makes life interesting.

706
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,508
We don't seem to be making
any headway.

707
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:53,104
First star I see tonight.

708
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,724
You must make a wish, Julia.

709
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,396
Oh, it's getting dark. It must be late.

710
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,485
Henry will be worried.
We must be leaving.

711
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,493
- Oh, no.
JULIA: I'm sorry, professor, but we must.

712
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,739
- Dudley.
- Yes, my friend.

713
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,533
There's one thing that troubles me.

714
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,168
- One thing I wish I knew.
- What's that?

715
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,956
Well, I'm an old man.
That history is a tremendous task.

716
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:23,001
I wonder, will I have time to finish it?

717
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,137
You'll finish your history, professor.
You'll have time.

718
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,513
I believe you, Dudley.

719
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:35,306
For quite a while now,
every time I passed a cemetery...

720
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,895
...I felt as if I were
apartment hunting.

721
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,021
Good bye, professor.

722
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,648
You've given an old man
a very happy afternoon.

723
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,067
- Thank you.
- God bless you both.

724
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:51,864
Thank you.
I'll pass that recommendation along.

725
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,464
Oh, my, that's pretty.

726
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,470
Take some of that pink stuff
and make curlicues with it.

727
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,891
I hope dinner won't be spoiled.

728
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,099
MATILDA: Oh, no, sir. I had a sort of feeling
that they might be late.

729
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,765
Yes. Very considerate of you.

730
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,603
MATILDA: Yes.
- Who's that cake for?

731
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,314
MATILDA: What cake?
- The cake behind you.

732
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,611
Oh, that cake? Oh, for anybody
who might like cake, sir.

733
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,947
But you know neither Mrs. Brougham
nor myself like these desserts.

734
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:15,785
Oh, but we baked you
an egg custard, sir.

DUDLEY:
Hello.

736
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,792
Oh, hello, dear.
I'm sorry we were late for dinner.

737
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,506
- Good evening.
- We've had the most marvelous time.

738
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,921
- Oh, I wish you'd been with us.
- I wish I had.

739
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,431
- Debby told me about the snow fight.
- Oh, did she?

740
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:38,266
We went to see Professor Wutheridge
and then we had lunch at Michel's.

741
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,646
- Is Debby in bed?
- No, she's waiting to see you.

742
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,308
Good. Well, I'll just go up
and say good night to her.

743
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,478
I won't be a minute.
I just wanna see if she's all right.

744
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,530
I trust you spent a
profitable afternoon.

745
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,697
Oh, yes. Did you have
a profitable afternoon, Henry?

746
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,666
Not very.

747
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,170
I'd like to see you for a moment.

748
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,956
Certainly.

749
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,128
Excuse me.

750
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,311
Can you prove to me
that you are an angel?

751
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,567
Proof? You mean a document?

752
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:31,106
Why, surely, you of all people should know
that an angel needs no passport.

753
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,695
I wanna see you perform a miracle.

754
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,610
- What kind?
- Well...

00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,029
...make this desk rise up
and fly around the room.

756
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:42,201
Please, Henry. I didn't come down here
to do silly tricks. I'm surprised at you.

757
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,415
I don't believe you're an angel.

758
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,875
I think you're a demon right out of--

759
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:50,337
Oh, Henry. Don't say that.

760
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:55,050
- Well, anyway, you know how I feel.
- Yes.

761
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,720
Now, wait a minute, Dudley,
there's another thing.

762
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,804
Oh, dinner is served, bishop.

763
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,905
Thank you, Dudley.

764
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,998
For what we are about to receive,
make us thankful.

765
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,754
- Amen.
- Amen.

766
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,053
Pass the celery, Henry. Please.

767
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,769
- Hmm?
DUDLEY: The celery.

768
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,319
Thank you.

769
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,652

Oh, I don't know, dear. Is it anything?

00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,361
- It's rather gay.

Thank you, dear. Is that a compliment?

777
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,543
Yes. You do it so capably.

00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,042
Well, thank you.

779
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:41,463
In fact, now I come to think of it,
everything you do is capable.

780
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:47,268
If there's one thing I pride myself on,
it's the fact that we lead a well-ordered life.

00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,849
The family, I mean.

782
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:52,891
Of course, the credit for that is due to you
much more than to me.

00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,107
- I think you're an excellent wife.
- Well, thank you.

- Do you think I'm an excellent husband?
- Of course, dear.

785
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,902
We'll have an early supper
so we get to St. Timothy's on time.

786
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,946
- St. Timothy's?
- For the choir rehearsal, the benefit.

I hope you're gonna take it easier
now that Dudley is here with you.

I think that he's very able.

00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,134
- You do?
- Yes.

792
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,967
- He knows so many things.
- What, for instance?

793
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,803
Well, you should have seen him
at Professor Wutheridge's.

794
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,389
He knows more about history
than the professor.

00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,493
- Don't you know any stories?
- Certainly, I know hundreds of stories.

- Tell me one. Please?
- All right. All right. Now, let me think.

All right.
This happened many, many years ago.

That's not the way to begin.

Stories start, "Once upon a time."

805
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:06,214
Oh, yes, that's true.
Well, once upon a time...

806
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,009
...there was a little boy
and he lived in a little town.

807
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,395
- What was his name?
- His name was David. He was a shepherd.

808
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,805
And the town where he lived
was called Bethlehem.

809
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:18,226
DEBBY: Oh, I know Bethlehem,
that's where the star was.

810
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:21,192
That's right.
Only David lived long before the star.

811
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,232
Well, one night, David was out in the hills
tending his sheep.

812
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,117
He was playing the harp and singing.

813
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,448
What was he singing? "Jingle Bells"?

814
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:32,081
Ha, ha. No, no. No, "Jingle
Bells" hadn't been written then.

815
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,663
David was singing songs
that he wrote himself.

816
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:38,171
Well, suddenly, an angel came down
and spoke to David.

817
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,503
- How did David know it was an angel?
- Ah, he didn't know.

818
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,293
And that's the way it always is.

819
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,053
Angels come down
and put ideas into people's heads...

820
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:50,387
...then people feel proud of themselves,
they think it was all their own idea.

821
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,848
Well, this angel said to David:

822
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,137
"One of your lambs has strayed."

823
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:59,400
So David put aside his harp and went out
in the darkness to find the lamb.

824
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,311
Of course, the angel guided him.

825
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:06,783
And when David found the lamb,
he saw a great, big ferocious lion.

826
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,317
Oh!

827
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,613
So David said to the lion,
“You get away from that lamb!"

828
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,749
And the lion said, “You get away
from me or I'll eat you too!"

829
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,159
Did David run away?

830
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,044
No. You know why?

831
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,581
Because the angel put another idea
into his head.

832
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,500
So David took out his sling...

833
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:27,090
...and he hurled a stone
and hit the lion right between the eyes.

834
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,847
I bet that lion was surprised. Ha-ha-ha.

835
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,758
Yeah. And so was David.

836
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,051
Because he didn't know
an angel had helped him.

837
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,354
Well, he picked up the lamb
and took it back to the fold...

838
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,607
...and then he felt so happy
that he made up another song.

839
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,394
It started out:

840
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:46,189
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want;

841
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,900
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

842
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,203
He leadeth me beside
the still waters;

843
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,748
He restoreth my soul."

844
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,372
You can tell the rest of this, Henry.

00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:03,297
- Some other time.
DEBBY: Hello, Daddy.

846
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:07,881
Miss Cassaway, will you get Mrs. Hamilton
on the telephone, please?

847
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,802
Miss Cassaway,
Mrs. Hamilton on the phone, please.

00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,716

- Good morning, Dudley.

850
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,229
See you in a few minutes.
Have to see Matilda.

851
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,016
- Yes. Bye, Debby.
- Goodbye, Dudley.

852
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,650
Bye.

853
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,240
- Thank you.
- Oh, pretty.

854
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,871
- Are you expecting a letter?
- One never knows.

855
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,127
But if I should get one,
the stamp will be worth saving.

856
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,083
I'll have Mrs. Hamilton in a moment.

857
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:45,965
You gonna see Mrs. Hamilton today?

858
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,842
- I hope to.
- May I come along? I'd like to meet her.

859
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,879
Mrs. Hamilton? Bishop Brougham.

860
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,259
Hello, Mrs. Hamilton. How are you?

861
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,768
I'm glad to hear it.

862
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:01,476
Mrs. Hamilton, 
I'd like to see you today.

863
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,937
Well, this afternoon, if possible.

864
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,020
Yes, it is. It's very urgent.

865
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:11,319
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Oh, terrible.

866
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:15,574
You can? Oh, that's splendid.

867
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:19,240
Thank you so much.
I'll be there, 5:00 this evening.

868
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,580
Thank you, Mrs. Hamilton. Goodbye.

869
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,791
Henry, you didn't make an appointment
for this afternoon, did you?

870
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:28,629
- Yes, it was the only possible time.
- You can't do this to Reverend Miller.

871
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,543
That rehearsal is being held for you.

872
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:34,305
They'll get along all right without me.
There are other things more important.

873
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,340
Mr. Miller will be delighted to see you.

874
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,885
But it isn't the same, Henry.
You're his bishop.

875
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,350
And I don't like going alone.

876
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,123
It's the big house
at the end of this street, driver.

877
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,705
Dudley, I take it that--

878
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:08,002
That you have the money for the taxi?

879
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:11,384
No. What makes you think I have money?

880
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,840

- Good evening, Bishop Brougham.
- How are you, Stevens?

00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,409
Mrs. Hamilton
is in the drawing room, sir.

Thank you.

896
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,917
Well, Bishop Brougham.

897
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,129
My dear Mrs. Hamilton,
I've come to tell you--

898
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,044
- You've come to apologize, I trust.
- Exactly.

899
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,805
Upon mature consideration,
my objections seem petty...

900
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,307
...compared with the generosity
of your gesture.

901
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,592
I'm very much relieved.

902
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,556
- Sit down, Bishop Brougham.
- Thank you.

903
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,769
What hurt me most was to think
that my instincts betrayed me...

904
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,604
...in recommending you
for the position you now hold.

905
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,439
I'm grateful, Mrs. Hamilton.

906
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,947
Now, in planning the cathedral,
I'm taking it for granted...

907
00:58:57,117 --> 00:59:00,075
...that George B. Hamilton
Memorial Chapel shall be located--

908
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,202
Just where you specified, Mrs. Hamilton.

909
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:06,491
You no longer feel the effect will be that the
cathedral was built in my husband's honor?

910
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,454
That was used in the heat of dispute.

911
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,586
- What matters is that the cathedral be built.
- Good.

912
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:15,341
You know, I will not have his name
in some horrid little brass plaque.

913
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,719
Oh, no. It will be incised in marble,
large letters that are gilded.

depicting Saint George and the dragon.

916
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:27,686
I should very much like that the countenance
of Saint George suggest my late husband.

00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:28,971
Yes.

918
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:33,017
- Who do you see as the dragon?
- Oh, any dragon.

919
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,186
Now, let's get the blueprints.

00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,025
Mrs. Hamilton, as we're now
in such complete agreement...

921
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,783
...would you mind
if we postponed the discussion?

Julia's waiting for me at St. Timothy's.

00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,330
Very well. We can go over the plans
when we send for transfer of funds.

00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,084
Thank you so much. And I'm so glad
we've settled our differences.

Is anything the matter?

Why, it doesn't seem quite right,
does it?

Oh, but-- Oh, Stevens.

928
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,680
There's something wrong
about the bishop's chair.

929
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:10,267
Oh, madam, it must be the new varnish.

930
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,102
The finisher should have warned us.

931
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,901
I do hope I'm not harming the chair.

932
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,028
Oh, no, no, not at all.

933
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:22,362
Send to a furniture shop, or a plumber's
or get turpentine. Do something, Stevens.

934
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,119
Yes, madam. Oh, dear.

935
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,615
- I wonder--
- Would you give it a pull at the back?

936
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:29,873
Yes, yes.

It's been a long time
since Henry's been down here.

939

I wish he had come.

940
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,939
You know, when he was here,
he was so close to people...

941
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,350
...so loved by everybody.
- Uh-huh.

942
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,235
And how does it seem to you now?

943
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:01,523
In dreaming of his cathedral,
he's moved away from people he loved?

944
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,190
Yes.

945
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,906
It's gonna be such a disappointment
for Reverend Miller not to see him.

946
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,913
Oh, well, he doesn't have
to be disappointed.

- Thank you, Mr. Miller.

Mr. Miller.

Yes.

- This is Mrs. Duffy.
- I know Mrs. Duffy. How are you?

01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,560
It's an honor to have you here

are a little late.

01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,945
We really should begin,
but I don't see how we can.

961
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,239
It's really quite embarrassing.

Well, I didn't.

with Mrs. Hamilton, I would.

01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,939
...but I got frightened.

1330
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:36,488
He had nothing
and I was afraid of poverty.

1331
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,195
He went away.

1332
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,744
I never saw him again.

1333
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:46,619
I never loved George Hamilton.

1334
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:51,412
He was very much in love with me
and he was wealthy.

1335
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:57,377
I've spent a fortune honoring his memory
in empty monuments.

1336
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:09,058
The Hamilton mansion.

1337
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,722
I never took a call here before.

1338
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,641
- What do I owe you now?
- Oh, no charge.

1339
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:14,685
- I got nothing better to do.
- Thank you.

1340
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:16,854
I'll be seeing you, Julia.

1341
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,277
[SNIFFLING]

1342
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:27,660
There's someone at the door.
That must be Henry and Julia.

1343
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:31,498
Oh, the bishop. No, I won't--
I can't see him now.

1344
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:33,787
- Oh, yes, you will.
- No.

1345
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,581
Yes.

1346
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:38,508
That's right, Agnes.

1347
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:42,216
Just go out and greet them
in your usual warm-hearted manner.

1348
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:48,427
The bishop and Mrs. Brougham
are calling, madam.

1349
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:49,891
Yes.

1350
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:57,147
You'll stay for dinner, Dudley?

1351
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:59,029
Oh, I'm afraid I can't, Agnes.

1352
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,985
I have a great deal of work to do.

1353
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:03,776
But don't keep Henry and Julia waiting.

1354
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:15,833
Julia.

1355
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,169
How do you do, Mrs. Hamilton?

1356
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:21,464
How nice of you to come and see me.

1357
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,379
And Henry.

1358
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:26,890
A Merry Christmas. A Merry Christmas.

1359
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:29,392
Come. Let's go into the drawing room.

1360
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,482
- Henry.
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Hamilton.

1361
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:36,892
Merry Christmas to you too.

1362
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,981
Come now, Henry.
We're very old friends.

1363
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:41,396
You must call me Agnes.

1364
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,944
And you too, Julia, dear.

1365
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:46,110
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1366
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,746
Oh.

1367
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:53,158
But he's gone already.

1368
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:54,747
JULIA:
Who?

1369
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:56,745
Dudley.

1370
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:58,254
- He was here?
- Yes.

1371
01:33:58,424 --> 01:33:59,459
I should have known it.

1372
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,295
- Where did he go?
- Oh, the poor man.

1373
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,130
He said he had so much work to do.

1374
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,261
Henry, you must make him
take some rest.

1375
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:07,138
I've been trying to make him do that.

1376
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,720
Oh, I can't thank you enough
for sending him to me.

1377
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:10,975
Oh, but do sit down.

1378
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:12,853
You know, my dear, meeting Dudley...

1379
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:16,515
...has been the greatest
spiritual experience of my life.

1380
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:17,933
I'm glad you've seen him.

1381
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:22,105
- How did you ever find him, Henry?
- it was more or less of an accident.

1382
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:24,523
- It was a miracle.
- Oh, indeed, it was.

1383
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:28,865
Talking with this wonderful,
understanding man has--

1384
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:32,030
Henry, I've changed my mind
about the cathedral.

1385
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:34,499
I'm going to give my money
to those who need it.

1386
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,251
To the poor and the homeless...

1387
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:40,665
...and the unappreciated people
here in the city and all over the world.

1388
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:43,755
And I want you
to direct the spending of the money.

1389
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:45,839
Now, Henry,
you see what Dudley has done?

1390
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:47,345
- Yes.
- Now you understand.

1391
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,426
Well, thank you, Mrs. Hamilton.

1392
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:53,977
I'll be home later for dinner
or something.

1393
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,479
I don't know what time--

1394
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,231
Goodbye.

1395
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:46,062
Hello, professor.

1396
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:47,857
Henry.

1397
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:49,945
Come in, my dear fellow. Come in.

1398
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,077
Sit down, Henry. Let me take your coat.

1399
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:55,740
- No, thanks.
- Oh, no, not there. Here.

1400
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,033
This is the only reliable chair.

1401
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:01,954
Well, this is a surprise and an honor.

1402
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:03,713
We must have a glass of sherry.

1403
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:06,124
- No, thank you, professor.
- Oh, but I insist.

1404
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:08,259
I wanna show you something.

1405
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:10,591
You see this bottle?

1406
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:12,221
You note that it is full?

1407
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:14,053
Now watch.

1408
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,517
This is something
that even you can't explain...

1409
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:19,897
...with all your vast
ecclesiastical knowledge.

1410
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,894
You will observe that it's still full.

1411
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:26,561
Now, how do you account for that?

1412
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,446
And what's more, the sherry itself.

1413
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:31,859
It stimulates, it warms, it inspires...

1414
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:35,154
...but no matter how much you drink,
it never inebriates.

1415
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:36,742
I think I can account for it.

1416
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,702
- Dudley's been here.
- Yes.

1417
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,041
And that bottle isn't all.

1418
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:43,874
He told me some things about history
that opened my eyes.

1419
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:48,133
And today, I went up to the university
library, I looked into some ancient texts...

1420
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:51,421
...which no living scholar
has been able to decipher.

1421
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:54,965
Suddenly, I found
that I could understand them.

1422
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:56,178
And look.

1423
01:36:56,352 --> 01:36:58,889
This is what I've done,
thanks to Dudley.

1424
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:02,101
My history, I'm actually writing it.

1425
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:03,561
Let's face it, Henry.

1426
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:07,444
This Dudley is no mortal man
like the rest of us.

1427
01:37:07,613 --> 01:37:09,069
Is he?

1428
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:12,445
- How did you know?
- Well, I can't tell.

1429
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:15,110
- Who is he? What is he?
- He says he's an angel.

1430
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:16,494
An angel?

1431
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,621
Funny.
Nothing stopped me from saying it.

1432
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:19,826
From heaven?

1433
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:21,457
That I'm not sure about.

1434
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,459
An angel.

1435
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:26,963
Too bad. He's such a nice fellow.

1436
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:29,586
I suppose I should have known it.

1437
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:32,093
Nothing less than an angel
could've put me to work.

1438
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,129
I'm glad he'd done some good
for somebody.

1439
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:36,173
He brought nothing but disaster for me.

1440
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:37,637
That's absurd.

1441
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:39,676
He and Julia were in here
the other day...

1442
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,970
...she seemed happier
than she's been in years.

1443
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:44,264
In fact, quite like her
old delightful self.

1444
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:47,104
She's a different person
when she's with him.

1445
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:49,985
He's made her despise me.

1446
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:53,193
Are you sure he has done that?

1447
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:55,985
- Do you think it's my fault?
- I didn't say that, Henry.

1448
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:59,120
This whole thing is a mystery
beyond my powers of comprehension.

1449
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,827
Oh, I suppose I am to blame
for everything.

1450
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:04,834
I asked for this in more ways than one.

1451
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:08,122
I suppose that Dudley came to me
just to confirm...

1452
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:11,837
...that I'd already lost
the love of Julia and Debby.

1453
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:16,008
I've got a confession to make
to you, my old friend.

1454
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:18,514
You sent me a coin.
That was very generous of you.

1455
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:21,267
I was mean enough
only to see its commercial value.

1456
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,178
It's gone. Don't know what's happened.

1457
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:25,893
But I do. Here it is.

1458
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:28,729
Now, where--? Oh, here it is.

1459
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,359
Where did you find it?

1460
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:32,191
- Oh, don't tell me.
- Yes.

1461
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:36,359
And what's more, he told me what it is.
A museum piece. Worth a fortune.

1462
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:38,118
No, I insist you keep it.

1463
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,278
Give it to Julia as
my Christmas present.

1464
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,697
Who knows?
it might bring luck to you both.

1465
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,286
Henry, it seems strange.

1466
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:47,748
I mean, you being a bishop,
and I a broken-down old scholar...

1467
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,879
...but I feel terribly sorry for you.

1468
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:52,256
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

1469
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,213
Thank you, there's nothing to be done.

1470
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:55,502
There must be.

1471
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,297
You and Julia love each other.
You always have.

1472
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:01,091
It's only partially true. I love Julia.

1473
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:02,805
Then why don't you fight for her?

1474
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:04,219
How can I fight against--?

1475
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:06,559
But you have a tremendous advantage
over him.

1476
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,314
Advantage? Over an angel?

1477
01:39:08,484 --> 01:39:09,940
That's precisely it.

1478
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,853
He's an angel.
Julia is a creature of earth.

1479
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:14,812
She's a woman, Henry.

1480
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:17,403
And you are a man.

1481
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:29,418
Isn't it beautiful?

1482
01:39:29,589 --> 01:39:33,253
And he did every bit of it himself,
and so quick too.

1483
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:36,418
When I saw it,
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1484
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:38,303
What a blessing he's been to us.

1485
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:40,931
The tree is lovely, Matilda. Lovely.

1486
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,511
DUDLEY:
I'm glad you like it.

1487
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:45,677
Been years since I've had a chance
to work on a Christmas tree.

1488
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:48,893
I usually get the more
disagreeable jobs.

1489
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,522
Good night, Matilda.

1490
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:55,027
Sweet dreams.

1491
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:57,360
Thank you, Mr. Dudley.

1492
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:07,574
- Julia.
- Yes?

1493
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:09,789
I think my work here is almost finished.

1494
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:12,294
I'll have to be moving along.

1495
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:13,750
Oh.

1496
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:16,292
My superior officers.

1497
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:19,468
Will we ever see you again?

1498
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:20,720
Mm-mm.

01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:24,265
DUDLEY: They seldom send us
to the same place twice.

1500
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:26,893
We might form attachments.

1501
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:30,431
I don't know what you're talking about,
Dudley.

1502
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:32,440
Of course not.

1503
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,815
- Julia.
- Yes?

1504
01:40:36,906 --> 01:40:38,863
- I don't want to leave.
- Why?

1505
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:43,827
There are a few people who know the
secret of making a heaven on earth.

1506
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:45,657
You are one of those rare people.

1507
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:50,950
I think you ought to go.

1508
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:54,496
No, please, Julia. Don't send me away.

1509
01:40:56,842 --> 01:40:58,628
What are you saying, Dudley?

1510
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:01,044
I'm tired of being a wanderer.

1511
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:06,058
I'm tired of an existence where one
is neither hot nor cold, hungry nor full.

1512
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:10,261
No.

1513
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:14,140
No. No, you must go away...

1514
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,480
...and never come back.

Julia.

1516

Julia.

1517
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:40,508
I've never had to fight an angel,
but take off your coat...

1518
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:42,168
...and put up your dukes.

1519
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:45,088
Now, why do you want
to fight me, Henry?

1520
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,057
Because you're a thief.

1521
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:51,345
Trying to steal my wife and my child.
The love that belongs to me.

1522
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:53,513
Don't you realize that as an angel...

1523
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:56,399
...I could possibly destroy you
with a bolt of lightning?

1524
01:41:56,569 --> 01:41:59,061
I don't care.
Julia means more to me than my life.

1525
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:01,400
I'm not gonna lose her.

1526
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:03,569
Ah.

1527
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,700
Then I have news for you.

1528
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:07,702
I'm going.

1529
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:13,166
I'll accept that as a fact
when I see it happen.

1530
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:14,542
Oh, no, you won't.

1531
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:17,249
Because when I'm gone,
you will never know...

1532
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:19,539
...that an angel visited your house.

1533
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:21,378
And Julia? What about her?

1534
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:23,463
There will be no memory
with her, either.

1535
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:27,552
Or with Debby or the professor
or anyone else.

1536
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,057
I don't trust you, Dudley.

1537
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:31,467
You may, Henry.

1538
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,229
Because your prayer
has been answered.

1539
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:35,888
My prayer has not been answered.

1540
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:37,899
I was praying for a cathedral.

1541
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:41,107
No, Henry.
You were praying for guidance.

1542
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,487
That has been given to you.

1543
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:52,238
Just a minute, please.

1544
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,200
Good bye, Henry.

1545
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:05,427
Dudley, if we should need you again,
will you come back?

1546
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:06,677
Not I.

1547
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:10,556
I should ask to be assigned
to the other end of the universe.

1548
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,683
Is that because I was so difficult?

1549
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:15,595
Oh, no. This difficulty was in me.

1550
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:17,309
When an immortal finds himself...

1551
01:43:17,483 --> 01:43:20,896
...envying the mortal entrusted
to his care, it's a danger signal.

1552
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:24,608
Take her in your arms
and hold her tight.

1553

Shh!

01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:23,955
She's asleep.

1559
01:44:26,594 --> 01:44:28,335
Are you all right?

1560
01:44:29,472 --> 01:44:31,713
Why, yes, of course I am.

1561
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:35,391
Henry, did you get that for Debby?

1562
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:39,512
HENRY:
No.

1563
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:43,521
Well, I can't imagine
where it came from.

1564
01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:58,282
Henry, what is it?

1565
01:44:58,459 --> 01:45:00,325
I don't know, I--

1566
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:04,037
I just had the most inexplicable feeling
of happiness.

01:45:05,424 --> 01:45:06,710
- You know something?
- What?

1569
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:08,795
In the kitchen there's a bowl of cider.

1570
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:11,882
- Yes, that's for tomorrow afternoon.
- Well, let's drink it now.

1571
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:14,923
Let's drink to us, to our happiness,
and to what lies ahead.

1572
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,387
And then let's smash the glasses
in the fireplace.

Tonight, I want to tell you the story
of an empty stocking.

1581
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:31,212
Once upon a midnight clear,
there was a child's cry...

1582
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:36,387
...a blazing star hung over a stable...

1583
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:40,517
...and wise men came
with birthday gifts.

1584
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:44,516
We haven't forgotten that night
down the centuries.

1585
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:47,648
We celebrate it
with stars on Christmas trees...

1586
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:50,731
...with the sound of bells
and with gifts.

1587

You give me a book, I give you a tie.

Aunt Martha has always wanted
an orange squeezer...

1590
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:06,167
...and Uncle Harry could do
with a new pipe.

Oh, we forget nobody, adult or child.

All, that is, except one.

01:47:17,723 --> 01:47:21,091
And we have even forgotten
to hang it up.
