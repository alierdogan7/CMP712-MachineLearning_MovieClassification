( upbeat music begins )

6
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:39,541
Take it, Roger.

7
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:47,401
( guitar solo )

00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:00,775
( applause )

00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:42,174
( alarm sounds )

10
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:45,812
I'm getting too old for this.

11
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,880
( doorbell rings )

12
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:06,913
( continues ringing )

13
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,942
Oh, God.

14
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:12,822
Happy birthday, my darling.

15
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:18,677
So, how does it feel
to be thirty-eight?

16
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,711
Oh, great.

17
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:24,278
Just think, in two years
I'll be forty, in twelve I'll be fifty.

18
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,912
I'm really excited about this.

19
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:28,912
- It's fun.
- Oh, sweetie.

20
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:31,246
Hey, what am I doing
with my life?

21
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,813
What am I doing with my career?

22
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,881
- What am I doing with us?
- You're boring us.

23
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,225
Yeah.

24
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:47,049
Do you love it?
It's an African grave post.

25
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,416
Is that gorgeous?

26
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:53,617
You bought me a grave post
for my thirty-eighth birthday?

27
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:56,551
Look, I'm sorry.
I like it, I really do.

28
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:59,485
It's really nice.
Look, uh, I've been thinkin'.

29
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:02,486
Remember, remember that thing
you used to wanna talk about,

30
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:04,119
and I never did?

31
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,887
You know, uh,
the "M" word?

32
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:11,889
Well, I think maybe it's time
that we did the "M" word.

33
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:14,554
Roger, I don't think you're
ready to do the "M" word.

34
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,422
Yeah, I am, honest.

35
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,189
Peggy, I want to get...

36
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,389
..."M'd".

37
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,190
Roger, if you can't say
the "M" word,

38
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,290
then you're not ready
to do the "M" word.

39
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,330
I can say the "M" word.
Geez!

40
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:33,258
( gagging sound )

41
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:36,458
Marriage, marriage, of course,
I can say it. What do you think?

42
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,326
I think we shouldn't get into
this right now.

43
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:41,726
You're going to be late for work,
and you know how daddy hates that.

44
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:44,760
I just came by to wish you
a happy, happy thirty-eighth.

45
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:46,360
Mmm.

46
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:49,036
Happy thirty-eighth.
That's a contradiction in terms.

47
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:58,046
( saxophone playing blues solo )

48
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,399
That was very bodacious.

49
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,699
( laughing )
Hey, Roger Dodger,
what it is?

50
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,500
- Hey, Bix.
- ( barks )

51
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,166
Makin' any money today?

52
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,467
Almost as much
as I made last night.

53
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:21,434
- That bad, huh?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:23,202
Look, Roger,

55
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:25,868
I've been thinkin' of joinin'
Jimmy Bowers' big band.

56
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,568
I want you to come and go with me.

57
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:28,869
I appreciate it, Ty, but--

58
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,603
No, don't give me that but, but jive.

59
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:34,004
Hey, look at this face.

60
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,804
- I'm quitting the group, Ty.
- You're doin' what?

61
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:38,705
I gotta give up something.

62
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:41,271
I figure I still have time to
make something of myself
as a lawyer

63
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:44,806
and I'm not going any further
as a musician.

64
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:47,872
Oh, this is an unhappy face.

65
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,273
Not that unhappy.

66
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:52,807
This is the face of a man who
has given up the wrong thing.

67
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:54,474
- Don't pick my nose.
- ( barking )

68
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:56,574
And if you do not correct
your thinkin' in this matter,

69
00:05:56,575 --> 00:06:01,576
I shall be forced to tell the
world that you are a honky mook!

70
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:05,810
Tyrone, you really should not
call another person a honky mook.

71
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:07,210
And why not?

72
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:09,944
Well, for one reason,
you're white.

73
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,944
- I am?
- Yeah.

74
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:16,656
( begins playing "Auld Lang Syne" )

75
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,446
Oh, my God, I am.

76
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,846
I'm late, Ty, I gotta go.
I'm doing the right thing, really.

77
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,658
You be cool, fool.
Good jammin' with you, Bix.

78
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:45,798
Well?

79
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:48,851
Well, you're dying alright.

80
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:52,352
Ever since I was a child doctors
have been telling me I'm dying.

81
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:54,252
Yeah, well, I guess
you've had enough practice

82
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:56,495
because you're really doing it now.

83
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:01,654
- How much time?
- A week, a day.

84
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,566
- A month?
- Mm-hm.

85
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:07,655
Good.

86
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:09,135
The phone.

87
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,823
- Got a cigarette?
- You don't smoke.

88
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,668
It can't hurt now.

89
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,202
Thank you.

90
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,459
After thirty-two years
of marriage,

91
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,959
you're still a naughty
little devil, aren't you?

92
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,327
( intercom buzzes )

93
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,360
Shouldn't you answer that?
Maybe it's your wife.

94
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:38,161
Ever since she filed for divorce
she hardly ever calls anymore.

95
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:40,828
( knocking )

96
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:45,062
I'm sorry, Mr. Schuyler, but,
Edwina Cutwater is on one.

97
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:47,509
Oh, God.
Alright.

98
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:49,896
It's okay.

99
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:53,231
I just wanted to tell you,
your wife subpoenaed me.

100
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:56,372
Oh, Gretch,
I'm so sorry about that.

101
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,073
I do have to take this call.

102
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,866
- Good morning, Margo.
- Good morning, Roger.

103
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,867
Good morning, Bix.

104
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:11,534
Any good ones for me today?
Any unfairly evicted tenants?

105
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,835
Uh, farm workers, Indians?

106
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:16,101
Well, Mr. Van Rensselaer called.

107
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:18,435
He wants you to fire his chauffeur.

108
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:22,769
Mr. Spencer Sr. wants you
to draw up a pre-marital agreement

109
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,970
for Mr. Spencer, Jr.

110
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,237
And finally,
Mr. Spencer Jr. called,

111
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:33,138
he wants you to tell Mr. Spencer Sr.
to mind his own friggin' business.

112
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,205
May justice prevail.

113
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:36,839
Why do I do it?

114
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,840
I think it's called paying dues.

115
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:43,373
I've been paying dues for eleven years.
I should own the entire club by now.

116
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,807
- Right on, Roger.
- No more.

117
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:50,075
I want worthwhile cases.
I want to defend right against wrong.

118
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,808
I want a partnership.

119
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:53,842
You're telling the wrong people, Roger.

120
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:56,143
I know. I was practicing.
Pretty good, huh?

121
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,276
I think wadding the message
is very effective.

122
00:08:58,277 --> 00:08:59,676
I'm gonna do this
for Schuyler right now.

123
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:03,677
Seymour, she was the fourth woman
today to tell she's been subpoenaed.

124
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:05,278
( knocking )

125
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,211
Mr. Schuyler, I have to talk to you.

126
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,512
I don't want her on the stand!

127
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:12,579
Listen, if you haven't got the
guff to handle this the right way,

128
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,890
I'm going to find someone who does!

129
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:18,747
- Mr. Schuyler--
- I was just gonna call you.

130
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:21,881
Get Miss Cutwater's file.
Go out to the house.

131
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:25,148
Edwina claims that she's finally dying
and needs to get her affairs in order.

132
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,782
No, uh, I have to discuss
my future here right now.

133
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:31,750
Well, Roger,
we are discussing your future.

134
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,916
You're going to
Edwina Cutwater's house.

135
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,990
I want a partnership.

136
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:42,185
Listen, the day you give up bebop
and concentrate on the law, we'll talk.

137
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:45,452
Start talking.
I quit the band.

138
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,353
As of today I'm dedicating
myself full time to my legal career.

139
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:52,420
Later today, I'm going to buy a vest.

140
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:55,054
My God, you're serious.

141
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:56,855
I am serious.

142
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:59,155
But I want to start
handling real cases, the big cases.

143
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,255
No more of this trick or treat stuff.

144
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:05,022
Roger, you don't know how long I have
waited to hear you say those words.

145
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:06,923
Going out to Edwina Cutwater's
house is not my idea--

146
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:08,090
No, no. Listen to me.

147
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:10,823
Long after Edwina
is gone from this earth,

148
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:14,958
her estate is going to generate
more income for this office

149
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,259
than most small countries see in a year.

150
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,125
And it's going to take
a lot of very sophisticated

151
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:25,093
legal expertise to structure
and administer those affairs.

152
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:28,461
Now, you do this for me, today,
go out to her house,

153
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,727
and I'll put you in charge of all that.

154
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:34,462
Now, if that's not real law,

155
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:38,139
if that's not big law,
I don't know what the hell is.

156
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:42,138
Actually the more I think about
this thing, the better it sounds.

157
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:46,964
Don't look at me
like that, will you?

158
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:48,998
I'm not going in there
as a messenger boy.

159
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,498
I'm going in as a highly
skilled legal adviser.

160
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,466
This is really good.

161
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,499
No more being looked
down upon by people that think

162
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,766
they're better than I am,
because they're rich.

163
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,867
From now on
I'm gonna be respected...

164
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,372
By people who think they're better
than I am, because they're rich.

165
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:09,535
Hi. Roger Cobb from Schuyler
and Mifflin to see Miss Cutwater.

166
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,541
- Yes, sir, you are expected.
- I'll show him up.

167
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:18,703
- Betty Ahrens.
- I'm Roger Cobb.

168
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,337
Try not to excite her, okay?

169
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:23,804
Edwina:
Grayson? Oh, Grayson.

170
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:27,038
- Yes, madam?
- Don't forget to pick up
the invitations,

171
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,773
and make sure they're
hand delivered the moment I die.

172
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:32,006
The moment you die.
Yes, madam.

173
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,573
( sighs )

174
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,907
- Oh, Mr.--
- Cobb.

175
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:38,940
Cobb. Oh, yes,
you're the tedious one.

176
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:41,775
Do you mind accompanying me
back to my deathbed?

177
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:44,842
Now, here's the name of my caterer,
and the evening's menu.

178
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:48,576
Make sure they have plenty
of goose paté, it's marvelous.

179
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:49,910
This is for the funeral?

180
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:52,110
One doesn't have goose
paté at a funeral.

181
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,544
Now, Mr. Fulton Norris is a
wonderful society orchestra.

182
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:58,511
I should like you to engage him
for the entire weekend.

183
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:00,145
- ( sighs )
- This is for the wake, ma'am?

184
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:04,145
Heavens, no. It's for a party,
and I want it to be a corker.

185
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:07,013
- Guess what I'm going to do?
- What?

186
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:09,255
I'm going to come back
from the dead.

187
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,781
( clears throat )
And, ah, what makes you think
you can do that?

188
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,455
Because I'm rich.

189
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:22,821
Grayson, come in here, please.
Over.

190
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:29,218
Miss Cutwater, this is not a parking
ticket we're talking about, here,

191
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:31,718
this is the, uh, Grim Reaper.

192
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,985
You cannot bribe
the Grim Reaper.

193
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:37,086
( chuckles ) Oh, Mr. Cobb,
I spent a lifetime shackled by...

194
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:39,019
frailty and poor health...

195
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,020
wheelchairs and sick beds.

196
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:44,087
It's my heart, you see.

197
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:49,089
It means well, but it's always
been something of a lemon.

198
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:54,322
I've had all the money in the world
and not one good chance to enjoy it.

199
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:57,590
I have never been to Europe.

200
00:12:57,591 --> 00:13:00,090
I've never
been anywhere, really.

201
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:05,092
Oh, sure I've ordered
from Neiman's and Gucci's,

202
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:08,036
but I've never
actually been there.

203
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:13,526
I've never ridden my horses.
I've never been to a ballet.

204
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,026
I've never danced.

205
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:18,860
But, Cutwater's
aren't quitters. ( sighs )

206
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:23,461
So, I've decided that if my
wealth cannot help me in this life,

207
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:25,795
then my God,
it's going to buy me another one.

208
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:29,796
- Ah, Grayson.
- You, ah, walkie-talkied, madam?

209
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:32,829
Yes, please send in Mr. Prakha
Lasa and what's her name,

210
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,697
- Fred's daughter.
- Miss Terry, madam.

211
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,897
Gas me.

212
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:40,331
Excuse me, am I just
getting you goose paté,

213
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:41,664
or do you have any
legal work for me?

214
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:44,799
( sighs ) of course I do.
I need you to amend my will...

215
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,965
so that what's her name, um...

216
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:50,933
Fred's daughter will become
inheritor over my entire
estate.

217
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:53,233
( coughs )
So we must draw up
a new codicil.

218
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:56,001
We need it witnessed.
Ah, your grace.

219
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,501
( startled shouting )

220
00:13:57,502 --> 00:14:00,702
It's alright,
Prakha, come in.

221
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,513
Come in. Come, come.

222
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,504
( whispers) What's going on here?

223
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:14,352
- Wait.
- Who's Fred's daughter?

224
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:20,272
Hello.

225
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,272
- Hello. I'm Terry Hoskins.
- Roger Cobb.

226
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:25,807
- Uh, so,
you're Fred's daughter?

227
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,507
Mm-hm.

228
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:29,440
Roger:
Who the heck is Fred?

229
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:31,615
Terry:
Daddy, come in, please.

230
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:35,109
I'm against the whole thing, I am.

231
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,609
My father is
Miss Cutwater's stableman.

232
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,475
It's unnatural.

233
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:40,976
Let me get something
straight here,

234
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:44,043
you're going to will all of your
money to the stableman's daughter,

235
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:45,211
and he's against it?

236
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,944
No.

237
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:50,244
- He just said that--
- You see, I should inherit nothing.

238
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:53,112
But you just said you wanted to
make her your sole beneficiary.

239
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:54,478
That is correct.

240
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:58,223
- So you will inherit the estate?
- No, she won't.

241
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,280
What am I missing here?

242
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:03,480
You see, thanks to
his highness Prakha Lasa,

243
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:05,586
I'm going to be transmigrated.

244
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,982
Transmigrated means that my soul
is going to leave my body forever

245
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:16,650
and become one with the universe.

246
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:19,222
At which time my soul
will enter her body.

247
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:23,051
Ah, good plan.

248
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:26,452
I'm sorry, but I don't think
it's a good plan at all.

249
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:30,152
My daughter's soul leavin' her body
and going off to who knows where?

250
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,986
Fred, let's not go through
all this again, shall we?

251
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,753
I know I wasn't much of a father
to her when she was growing up,

252
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:38,487
but I won't lose her again.
No, I won't.

253
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:40,721
Zip it, Fred.

254
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:45,088
Miss Cutwater, as your attorney
it is my duty to inform you

255
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:50,089
that the will could be
contested if you're deemed...

256
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,024
not of perfectly sound mind.

257
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:57,190
Why you presumptuous
ambulance chaser.

258
00:15:57,191 --> 00:16:02,158
Are you insinuating that I am
not of perfectly sound mind?

259
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,692
No. no, I wouldn't do that,
but I think practically

260
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:07,927
everybody in
the solar system would.

261
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:09,793
Mr. Cobb,

262
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:13,728
that's last thing I need around here
is your ill-informed negativity.

263
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:15,628
Get out.

264
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:18,695
( gasping - coughing )

265
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:20,029
( bell ringing )

266
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,840
- Thanks for not exciting her.
- Prakha: ( chanting )

267
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,330
There, there.

268
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:29,903
( chanting continues )

269
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,498
Edwina:
No, Prakha, not yet.

270
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,536
Prakha, not yet.

271
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,346
( breathing heavily )
I'm not ready.

272
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,467
Is everybody here bananas?

273
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:46,234
Mr. Cobb...

274
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:48,767
Let me explain something to you.

275
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,001
You see...

276
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:53,768
closer please.

277
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:55,807
( coughing )

278
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,384
That's for bananas,
now get out!

279
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,670
What century is this?

280
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:05,871
I hurt my hand.

281
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:09,905
I'm going to tell Mr. Schuyler that
you're an insolent little toad.

282
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,439
And demand that he fire you.

283
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,206
Why don't you just enter
his body and do it yourself?

284
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:18,416
And don't you come back,
you peasant!

285
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:22,874
Look, lady...

286
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,042
just because my grandfather
didn't rape the environment

287
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:27,375
and exploit the workers
doesn't make me a peasant!

288
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,175
And it's not that he didn't
want to rape the environment

289
00:17:29,176 --> 00:17:31,009
and exploit the workers,
I'm sure he did.

290
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,753
It's just that as a barber
he didn't have that much opportunity.

291
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:43,711
Grayson, bring the car
and my hairdresser,

292
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:46,785
and the golden
diamond jewelry. Over.

293
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,148
I've got to hand it to you,
it's brilliant.

294
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:58,648
- What is?
- Your scam.

295
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,214
It's legal, it's logical.

296
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:02,549
I thought the bit with the bowl
was overdoing it a little,

297
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,349
but, it's certainly original.

298
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,283
The bowl, Mr. Cobb,
is attuned to the harmonics
of Miss Cutwater's life force.

299
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:11,384
When her body dies it becomes
a repository of that life force

300
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:16,084
so I hold the bowl and it becomes
the conduit from her body to mine.

301
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:19,352
You really believe that?

302
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:21,352
Yes.

303
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:23,753
Of course, uh...

304
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:27,454
if you're wrong you inherit
twenty million bucks.

305
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,620
I don't want her money.

306
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,554
When I was fifteen
I ran away from home

307
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:35,488
thinking I could find myself
in the material world.

308
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,156
I found only pain.

309
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:42,189
His holiness, Prakha Lasa, teaches
that possessions transmit pain.

310
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,557
I want something far more
valuable than money...

311
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,991
far more elusive,

312
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:51,758
for which I'm willing to give up
my physical being and become one
with the universe.

313
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,492
And ah, don't you think
that's just a little bit...

314
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:57,166
whacko?

315
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:01,371
Feel my heart.

316
00:19:03,462 --> 00:19:05,827
You are unhappy.

317
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,095
You are anxious and unfulfilled

318
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:10,906
because you are not doing
with your life as you wish.

319
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,896
I'm at peace.

320
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:17,935
Which one of us is crazy?

321
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:21,007
You are.

322
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,170
Thank you.

323
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,134
Margo.

324
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:42,701
Oh, Mr. Durand called.

325
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:45,535
He needs you to set up
a Bermuda corporation,

326
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:47,735
so he can write off
his honeymoon.

327
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,403
- Also, there was a call--
- Forget it.

328
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:52,670
I'm telling Schuyler today
he's got to play me or trade me.

329
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,414
He's in the conference room
with Miss Cutwater.

330
00:19:58,272 --> 00:19:59,972
She's here?

331
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:03,638
Also with her doctor,
with her nurse,

332
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:08,439
Mr. Mifflin, some english girl
with no bra.

333
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,607
And a Hindu
holding a bedpan on a stick.

334
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:14,240
I don't think you should
go in there.

335
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:15,775
( inhaling deeply )

336
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:17,475
Schuyler:
We just had a little
bit more to go over now.

337
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:19,175
Are you strong enough to continue?

338
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,542
( exhales )

339
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:23,942
What? Oh, I'm fine. Really.

340
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:25,710
( coughs )

341
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:27,943
I'm fine. Tell them.

342
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,510
She could drop dead any minute.

343
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:32,550
Never mind her.
She's only trying to make me feel good.

344
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:37,079
( door opens )

345
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,012
I'm very sorry to interrupt.

346
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:43,846
Madam, I wish to apologize
for upsetting you before.

347
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:47,181
Mr. Cobb, please don't grovel.

348
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:51,682
I'm not groveling,
I'm apologizing.

349
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:55,015
- If I could see you outside.
- If you're trying to save your job,

350
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:56,849
you're too late.

351
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,126
- What?
- It's quite lost by now.

352
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:06,985
Let me tell you something.

353
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:10,918
My father
worked himself into an early grave
defending the rights of needy people

354
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,252
in a rat infested
store front over on ninth street.

355
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:17,320
When he died my mother took
a job as a plumber's assistant

356
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,920
so I could go to law school
and carry on in his name.

357
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:23,788
So now the only job I can get
is in some skidrow legal aid office,

358
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:26,554
I'd just as soon take it
as have to kowtow to people like her

359
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:27,789
- for the rest of my life!
- Schuyler: That's enough!

360
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,555
You know what you are?
You're an energy vampire.

361
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,489
- That's enough.
- You leap in my neck.

362
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,723
You suck all the fun out of
being a lawyer.

363
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,290
Schuyler:
Shut up! That's enough!

364
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,523
( coughing )

365
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:39,457
I have never heard such a
moronic load of crap in my life!

366
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,557
Well, I don't have to take that.

367
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:42,758
No, not you, her.

368
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,825
( chuckling )
Did you hear what she wants
to do with her soul?

369
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:46,125
Yeah.

370
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:47,825
Jesus Christ,
the woman is looney tunes.

371
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:49,059
She's nuts!

372
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,926
But you,

373
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:53,260
Roger, you've got guts.

374
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:56,660
I never saw you stand up
to anyone like that before.

375
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:59,295
You have a fire burning
inside you.

376
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:02,328
To defend people who really need you.

377
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:05,729
And I never knew that about
your father or your mother.

378
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,630
- Well, I made that up.
- You didn't?

379
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:11,063
- You son-of-a-gun.
- Pretty good, huh?

380
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:12,463
( laughing )

381
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,964
I like a man who thinks
on his feet.

382
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,364
Thanks.

383
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:18,899
Roger, I have a case that needs
a lawyer just like you.

384
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,265
You win it,

385
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,899
and I'll put you up
for a partnership.

386
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,833
This is not for one of these
rich goofballs?

387
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:28,033
No, no, no.
It's for a very nice man...

388
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:30,037
who's getting divorced.

389
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:32,901
I think I'm gonna
be a partner.

390
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:34,176
Mazel tov!

391
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:38,468
Oh, Bix, you're going to be
a partner's best friend.

392
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:40,381
( barking )

393
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:44,369
Call the Fulton Morris
Orchestra tell them Miss Cutwater

394
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:49,371
has requested her favorite saxophone
player Tyrone Wattell for her party.

395
00:22:50,406 --> 00:22:53,638
And she'd like him to receive
a thousand dollars for the night.

396
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,372
We're gonna inform Mr. Wattell.

397
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,672
- Come on, Bix.
- ( barking )

398
00:22:57,673 --> 00:22:59,272
What a guy.

399
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:01,652
Now, then...

400
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:05,708
Mr. Mifflin can witness
the codicil.

401
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:07,874
I will sign as executor
of the estate

402
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:11,949
and then we will be all signed,
sealed and---

403
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,510
( exhales deeply )

404
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:17,043
- Oh, a tunnel...
- Hmm?

405
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:20,576
- Edwina?
- ...with a very bright light.

406
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:22,477
I was afraid of this.

407
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:23,444
What the hell is she
talking about?

408
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,611
Terry...

409
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,978
Prakha...

410
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:29,178
( begins to chant )

411
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,712
Schuyler:
What the hell is going on?

412
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:32,779
Miss Cutwater?
Wait a minute.

413
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,079
( everyone talking at once in a panic )

414
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,685
( chanting )

415
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:40,380
Mifflin:
Did she sign everything?

416
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:42,981
Ahrens:
Jan, S10 I.V. Hurry!

417
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:45,292
Kim, call the insurance company.

418
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:49,463
( chanting continues )

419
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,383
Mifflin:
How is she?

420
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:54,658
Will she be alright?

421
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,884
( clanking )

422
00:23:57,885 --> 00:24:00,331
Ahrens:
I'm losing her. I'm losing her.

423
00:24:04,186 --> 00:24:06,097
Get out of my way, you fool!

424
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:11,194
Ahrens:
I lost her.

425
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,763
- ( banging sound )
- Roger: Ouch!

426
00:24:21,956 --> 00:24:23,589
Edwina's voice: Where am I?

427
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,689
What?

428
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,624
Edwina: ( gasps ) I'm breathing.
I must be alive.

429
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,124
Who said that?

430
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,537
Edwina:
No, I can't be. I just died.

431
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:36,958
I'm picking up General Hospital
in my fillings.

432
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:39,192
Edwina:
Oh, it worked.

433
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:41,092
Oh, my Lord!

434
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,360
( hollering )

435
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:45,293
( whimpering )

436
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:47,365
What the hell's happening to me?

437
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:53,294
( effeminately )
I feel like the healthiest
woman alive.

438
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:55,362
Oooh!

439
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:57,729
Who said that?
I did.

440
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,230
I'm going crazy.

441
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:03,898
Edwina voice:
That does not sound like
Fred's daughter.

442
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:06,764
No, I'm not going crazy.

443
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:08,797
Something hit me on the head.
Ouch!

444
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,507
I'm just hallucinating.
That's all!

445
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:13,898
( screams )

446
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:15,366
Edwina:
Oh, shit!

447
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,299
What the hell are you doing
in there?

448
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,834
I can't believe this.
I can't even die right.

449
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:23,267
Why are you doing this to me?

450
00:25:23,268 --> 00:25:26,768
Dear, God, don't you get enough
laughs up there?

451
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:28,901
What did I ever do to you?

452
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,736
Somebody please tell me
this is not happening.

453
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,469
Edwina:
I'm afraid it is,
so let's just go inside,

454
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,042
and have Prakha Lasa
straighten out this mess.

455
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,838
Oh, geez, I can't move
my right leg.

456
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,105
I'm paralyzed!

457
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:44,038
Edwina:
Here let me try.

458
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,713
( screaming )

459
00:25:48,273 --> 00:25:51,106
Edwina:
We obviously have mutual
control over our body.

460
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:52,973
Our body?
It's my body.

461
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:54,406
I'm not sharing my body
with anyone.

462
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:56,820
Everybody’s going to be
real disappointed.

463
00:25:58,575 --> 00:25:59,774
( speaking to himself )
Where are we going?

464
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,708
We've got to find Prakha Lasa!

465
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:04,342
I can't go in there,
Schuyler will think--

466
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:06,909
Excuse me, this is a private
conversation, do you mind?

467
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,109
Ah, no.

468
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,810
Edwina:
Please, just do as I say!

469
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,484
Nooo!

470
00:26:17,712 --> 00:26:20,090
( grunting )

471
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:26,647
Edwina:
You seem to have control over
the left side of your body,

472
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:29,980
while I feel dominant
on the right.

473
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:32,553
Oh, let go of that.

474
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:37,249
Oh, you bitch!

475
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,991
How about a little respect
for the deceased?

476
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,783
Let go of my hand you brute!

477
00:26:44,784 --> 00:26:46,354
I will not!

478
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:49,617
( grunting )

479
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:52,752
Edwina:
Just stop it!
If you want me out of you,

480
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:54,918
then you must stop this
ridiculous behavior.

481
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,318
( barking )

482
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,053
Roger:
Lady, I don't know how
you got in there,

483
00:26:58,054 --> 00:26:59,786
but I'm going to get you
out of me right now!

484
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:02,253
Let's go!

485
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,654
( barks )

486
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,120
Edwina:
Just wait, I'll go first.

487
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,188
Calm down and try
to concentrate.

488
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:11,188
I'm the right side,

489
00:27:11,189 --> 00:27:14,022
Uh, and you're the left.

490
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:17,389
First me, then you.

491
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,890
Me. You.

492
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:22,991
See, if we just cooperate.

493
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:26,091
Now all we have to do
is find Prakha Lasa.

494
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:28,759
Actually, there's something
we have to do first.

495
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,959
Edwina:
What?

496
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,564
I really have to take a leak.

497
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:39,830
Bix, go see Margo.

498
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:42,862
Edwina:
Your foot, my foot,
your foot, my foot, very good.

499
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,462
Your foot, my foot,
your foot, my foot.

500
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:46,762
You're doing wonderfully well.

501
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:48,462
Mifflin:
Isn't it awful?

502
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:50,463
Roger:
You have no idea.

503
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:53,396
I can't go in there.
That's the men's room.

504
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:55,378
Just shut up and do as I say!

505
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:06,099
Don't you ever,
ever yell at me again.

506
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,666
I'm sorry, but this is not
my idea of a good time.

507
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,467
Well, I'm not exactly having
one my best days either.

508
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:13,200
I died five minutes ago.

509
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:15,868
( grunting )

510
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,101
Oh, God.

511
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:18,968
You'll have to do it.

512
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:21,035
I'll have to do what?

513
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:23,002
You know, take it out.

514
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:25,437
Take what out?

515
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,636
The little fireman.
<i> </i>

516
00:28:27,637 --> 00:28:29,403
The little fireman?

517
00:28:29,404 --> 00:28:30,927
You know, my penis!

518
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:35,014
How dare you say penis
to a dead person.

519
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,640
Listen, lady, if you don't
give Big Ed some air,

520
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:42,526
he's gonna piss all over
your half of my body.

521
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:47,767
Mr. Cobb, if you're trying
to scare me, it won't work.

522
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:50,007
Both:
( clears throat )

523
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:52,742
( paints unzip )

524
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:54,814
( hollering )

525
00:28:57,432 --> 00:28:59,020
Stop it! Stop it!

526
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,643
Alright...

527
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:05,217
first, let go of your grip.

528
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,911
Now slowly take your hand...

529
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,220
Now slowly!

530
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,220
( sighs ) Alright,
we're going to try it again.

531
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:18,260
Carefully. Very carefully.

532
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,247
What the hell are you doing
in there?

533
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:27,982
I'm trying to release
your Mister Ed.

534
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:31,077
Stop playing with it already,
and take it out!

535
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,803
You don't have to talk out loud,
I can hear your thoughts.

536
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:39,480
( Roger to himself )
Oh, great, just what
I always wanted.

537
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:44,544
( sighs in relief )

538
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:56,713
Shall I tap?

539
00:29:56,714 --> 00:29:59,481
- Yes.
- Tap, tap.

540
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:01,018
Thank you.

541
00:30:02,315 --> 00:30:04,424
I meant what I said
about yelling.

542
00:30:12,351 --> 00:30:15,850
I was, ah, just talking
to myself in there...

543
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:16,784
...it wasn't anything really.

544
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:18,351
Edwina: ( gasping )
There's Fred's daughter!

545
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:21,118
Yoohoo, Terry.
Stop it!

546
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,940
From now on, don't use my mouth.
And try to walk more like a man.

547
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,197
Alright.

548
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:31,587
Mr. Cobb...

549
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:34,054
- I feel so terrible.
- I know.

550
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,488
It's not your fault
it didn't work.

551
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:37,154
How do you know it didn't work?

552
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:39,389
You're not going
to believe this...

553
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,256
Hey, where's the swami?

554
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,022
He left when
all those people came in.

555
00:30:43,023 --> 00:30:46,223
- He's very shy, you know.
- Left? Where did he go?

556
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:48,290
Oh, stop worrying,
I know where to find him.

557
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:50,024
You better had!

558
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:51,624
Mr. Cobb?

559
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,858
You still want to go through
this transmigration thing?

560
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:55,192
- Well, yes, but she's--
- Fine. Look,

561
00:30:55,193 --> 00:30:56,558
- We'll go get Gunga Den...
- Mr. Cobb?

562
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,825
Excuse me. Mr. Schuyler needs
to see you right away.

563
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:01,026
Fine, thanks.

564
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,226
Where can we reach you?

565
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,793
I'm staying at Miss Cutwater's.

566
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:05,527
- Who's we?
- Roger?

567
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:07,594
He said now!

568
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:09,628
I'll explain later.

569
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:11,540
Trust me.

570
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:15,662
( Roger to himself )
Don't swing your arm so much.

571
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:17,930
There's something very odd
about Cobb.

572
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:20,631
The man has been bringing a dog
to a law office for three years

573
00:31:20,632 --> 00:31:22,197
and you just noticed he's odd?

574
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:24,498
Yes, but he's speaking
with a funny voice.

575
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,061
Have you heard his secretary?

576
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:29,079
And he's impi--

577
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:32,344
We'll discuss this later!

578
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:36,967
Tattle tale.

579
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:38,500
Are you feeling alright?

580
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:42,202
Yeah. Just this whole Cutwater
thing really got under my skin.

581
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:43,602
Look, I need to leave
for just about an hour.

582
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:45,235
Forget it.
We're going to court tomorrow.

583
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,136
Court tomorrow.
Really, I, I--

584
00:31:47,137 --> 00:31:48,639
Clear the decks.

585
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:51,883
Sit down.

586
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,037
It's my divorce.

587
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,638
Ah, nobody knew.

588
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:59,605
Tell you the truth,
it's a little embarrassing.

589
00:31:59,606 --> 00:32:03,339
Seymour was representing me,
but he wasn't doing squat!

590
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,972
He wanted me to settle.

591
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,406
You want a partnership,

592
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:08,373
you do for me what you did
in the Brenner case.

593
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:09,840
( Roger to himself ) Oh, God, not now.

594
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:11,707
Edwina:
Oh, just explain what happened.

595
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,474
Roger: Are you crazy?
I don't even believe it.

596
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:15,541
If I tell him
he'll have me put away.

597
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,275
Look, before I can
take care of any of this,

598
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:20,908
there's something very personal,
very private I have to clear up.

599
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:22,843
Oh, yes, of course.
Alright, sit down.

600
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:24,909
I'll tell you everything.

601
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,810
- No, no. I meant that--
- That's alright,
don't be embarrassed.

602
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,977
I started cheating on my wife
three years ago.

603
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:32,478
Edwina:
Oh, goody, man talk.

604
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,011
I never intended to.

605
00:32:34,012 --> 00:32:36,412
Women just started throwing
themselves at me.

606
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,146
( sarcastically )
Oh, you must be joking.

607
00:32:38,147 --> 00:32:41,746
- What?
- ( coughs ) I must be choking.

608
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:45,880
Anyway, I know it's not because
I'm Paul Newman or anything.

609
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,580
( chuckling )
You can say that again.

610
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:50,825
- What?
- I said, uh, could you say that again?

611
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:56,016
I'm not Paul Newman.
<i> </i>

612
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:59,192
Not Paul Newman.

613
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,850
Anyway...

614
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:06,784
It seems that one of my wife's
best friends suddenly lost her husband.

615
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:09,518
Well. Women usually do
outlive their men.

616
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,919
So, naturally,
she found herself cut off

617
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,819
from her normal sexual
relations, and, uh...

618
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,753
She turned to you
and you comforted her.

619
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:20,054
I understand, sir, you really
didn't do anything wrong.

620
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:23,587
Oh, you better believe it.
I was incredible.

621
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:25,821
I see, sir. I think I can
figure out the rest.

622
00:33:25,822 --> 00:33:28,022
And then another one was widowed.

623
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:31,123
Okay, so, two little indiscretions.
That's not such a big deal.

624
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:34,056
And then, another one.
And, uh, another.

625
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:37,524
And, uh, pretty soon, just going
to a funeral would give me a hard-on.

626
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:42,526
Edwina:
Speaking on behalf of the dead,
I find this disgusting.

627
00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:44,492
I think I got the picture now.

628
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:47,159
I'm not sure you do.
You see, it's not just sex.

629
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,792
Let me tell you.

630
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:53,227
These sweet darling ladies have
given new purpose to my life.

631
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:56,194
They given me the opportunity
to give something back to the world

632
00:33:56,195 --> 00:33:58,561
instead of just take, take, take.

633
00:33:58,562 --> 00:34:00,129
- Are you alright?
- Fine. Fine!

634
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,669
Edwina: Ops, sorry.

635
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,229
Anyway, you understand
what I'm saying?

636
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:08,096
I get to give love
and happiness to people who
really need and appreciate it.

637
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:10,964
Hell, I'm the west coast
distributor of love and happiness.

638
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,631
And for that,
I have to go to court?

639
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:16,032
Now I don't deserve that.
I should get a dinner!

640
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,198
Edwina:
He should get a social disease.

641
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,099
- I won't let you down.
- I'm counting on you, son.

642
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,766
( Roger to himself )
Shake hands with him.

643
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:25,440
Like a man.

644
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:30,134
( laughing )
Crazy musicians.

645
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,401
You won't regret this.

646
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,568
I know I won't.
If I do,

647
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:35,768
you'll never practice
in the free world again.

648
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:38,376
( nervous laugh )

649
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:46,304
Edwina:
I certainly hope you plan on
losing that case.

650
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:48,104
How did it go, Roger?

651
00:34:48,105 --> 00:34:49,438
( Roger to himself )
The only thing I plan on losing is you!

652
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,604
( door slams )

653
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:53,005
Nice talking to you, Rog'.

654
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:55,405
You know, you have
a great deal to learn

655
00:34:55,406 --> 00:34:58,106
about making
someone feel welcome.

656
00:34:58,107 --> 00:34:59,573
Let's get something straight, here.

657
00:34:59,574 --> 00:35:02,174
I never liked you
when you were in your body,

658
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:04,207
I certainly don't
like you in mine!

659
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:08,075
Well, I don't see why you're
getting so upset about all this.

660
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:09,841
Because I want my body back!

661
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:12,409
And I want my freedom
and my privacy.

662
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,509
And most of all, I'd like to be able
to take a leak without being fondled!

663
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,977
You may find
this hard to believe,

664
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:21,777
but fondling you
while you make pee-pee,

665
00:35:21,778 --> 00:35:24,678
is not my idea of a good time.

666
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,353
Fine! Fine!

667
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,446
It's two o'clock.
I have a lot to work to do.

668
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:35,895
I want you out of me by 3:15.
Now, where's the swami?

669
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:38,714
Well...

670
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:41,081
you know he's never
been away from Tibet.

671
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:43,415
So, I put him up
at the Ambassador.

672
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,682
Let's see.
What is that number?

673
00:35:45,683 --> 00:35:48,516
Hotels, H, H, H,

674
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:51,157
Let's see.
( humming )

675
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,084
Let your fingers do--
( gasps )

676
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,617
Here it is,
The Ambassador.

677
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:58,284
( gasps )And look over here.
The Arlington.

678
00:35:58,285 --> 00:36:00,518
That's where mommy
in the spring of sixty-two

679
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:03,786
had her amethyst stolen
from her in the elevator.

680
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,353
It was just so distressing.

681
00:36:05,354 --> 00:36:07,231
( shouting )
Give me that!

682
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:13,865
( chanting softly )

683
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,471
( flushes toilet - telephone rings )

684
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:30,266
( telephone rings -
continues to flush toilet )

685
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,430
( ringing stops )

686
00:36:42,427 --> 00:36:44,202
No, he hasn't checked out.

687
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:55,462
( sighs )
Oh, dear.

688
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,996
Yeah, oh, dear.
Don't worry, I know where to find him.

689
00:36:57,997 --> 00:37:01,969
- Good going, Edwina.
- It's Miss Cutwater to you.

690
00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:04,730
- Hello, Margo.
- Oh, hi, Peg.

691
00:37:04,731 --> 00:37:06,131
Roger:
Any woman who fondles me
in a men's room,

692
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:09,298
I think I can be on
a first name basis with!

693
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:12,199
That's not fair.
You told me to pull out your penis.

694
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,202
How about a cup of coffee?

695
00:37:21,302 --> 00:37:23,568
Where is she?

696
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,468
( under his breath )
Oh, boy.

697
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:26,802
Where is she!?

698
00:37:26,803 --> 00:37:29,502
- There's nobody here.
- Liar! I heard her!

699
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:31,370
So you want to get married
and settle down, huh?

700
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:34,336
Peggy, I swear,
there's nobody else here.

701
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:37,304
Come out, you little slut.

702
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,979
- Who is she calling a slut?
- Shhh!

703
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:42,872
I heard that.

704
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:43,571
( growling )

705
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:45,405
Come on, deny it.

706
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:47,439
Where is she?

707
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,206
It was me.
Bix, stop that.

708
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:50,706
- What was you?
- The voice you heard.

709
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:52,540
I was talkin' to myself.

710
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:53,774
Listen...

711
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:57,941
your perfume suits you.
It's cheap and common.

712
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,875
Edwina:
At least she slapped your side.

713
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:01,808
And who did I heard you say
was fondling you in the men's room?

714
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:03,809
- Me.
- Liar!

715
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,909
Edwina:
How dare she.

716
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,142
- Peggy: ( screams )
- Edwina!

717
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:07,376
Edwina?

718
00:38:07,377 --> 00:38:09,577
My name is Peggy, you pig!

719
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,877
( hollers )
No, let me explain.

720
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:14,086
It's Edwina Cutwater.
She died today.

721
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:18,079
You did it with a dead woman?

722
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,979
- No!
- Roger, you are sick.

723
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,880
To think I came up here
to even discuss marrying you.

724
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:26,713
Despite the fact that I heard
what you're doing to my mother.

725
00:38:26,714 --> 00:38:28,481
How did your mother
get into this?

726
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:30,214
I just found out you're going
to court tomorrow

727
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:33,315
to represent the other side
against my own mother.

728
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:35,348
I'm respecting your father.

729
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:38,316
You're going to try
to beat my mother.

730
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:42,783
- Oh, God!
- Roger, you go to court
tomorrow, we're through.

731
00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:45,517
If I don't, your father
will have my balls.

732
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:47,784
Then it's either me
or your balls, Roger.

733
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:50,164
But you can't have both.

734
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:56,019
Hmm, very interesting choice.

735
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,252
I'm not certain what purpose
balls actually serve

736
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,564
but they've got to make a
better pair than the two of you.

737
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:09,154
- Well?
- I'm very attached to them, Peg.

738
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:11,534
Goodbye, Roger.

739
00:39:13,256 --> 00:39:14,956
By the way...

740
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:17,190
I never liked your dog

741
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:19,193
and I think jazz is stupid!

742
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,401
( door slams )

743
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:25,592
( door opens )

744
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:28,039
And I faked all those orgasms.

745
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:31,198
( panting )

746
00:39:32,694 --> 00:39:36,327
( screaming - laughing )

747
00:39:36,328 --> 00:39:37,705
Sound familiar?

748
00:39:39,595 --> 00:39:42,236
Yeah, well, I faked mine, too.

749
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:47,529
Aw, believe me, we're better off
without her.

750
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,669
She just isn't right for us.

751
00:39:52,897 --> 00:39:54,171
( screams )

752
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:57,698
You know, ever since
our little accident,

753
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:00,998
I have sensed a lot of
hostility coming from you.

754
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,532
Well, excuse me!

755
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,766
But I'm watching my entire
career go down the sewer,

756
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:09,466
'cause I've got a dead woman
living inside me.

757
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:11,634
And the only person who can
get you out is some...

758
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:14,167
cosmic weirdo you can't
even find.

759
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:17,135
I can so find him.

760
00:40:17,136 --> 00:40:18,502
I think.

761
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,068
Wait, I'm sure I know
where he'll be this evening.

762
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,503
Do you have a car?

763
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,102
( car tires screeching )
Edwina laughing:
Oh, this is fun.

764
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:26,169
Roger:
Shift, damn it.

765
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,904
- Shifting, whee!
- What are you doing?

766
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:29,537
I never learned how to drive.

767
00:40:29,538 --> 00:40:31,137
Which is it, one of these
pedal things?

768
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,905
Roger:
The brakes, not the gas!

769
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:36,238
Edwina:
The brakes, the gas,
I don't know which one it is.

770
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,239
Bix, let go of her.
( growling )

771
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,172
Edwina:
Stop it. ( screams )

772
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:41,272
I'm going to strangle
this mangy mongrel.

773
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,873
Roger:
Alright, that's it.

774
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:45,140
Edwina:
This isn't the way.
Where are we going?

775
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:46,540
It's enough that I have
to put up with you,

776
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:49,174
but I will not subject my dog
to this one minute more.

777
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:50,508
( skidding )

778
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:53,609
Tyrone. Oh, great,
I gotta talk to you.

779
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,642
Hey, Roger Dodger.

780
00:40:56,643 --> 00:40:59,076
I got a call from the union
about some gig.

781
00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:00,543
They wouldn't tell me
who recommended me,

782
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,044
but I smelled your
finger prints all over it.

783
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,377
- Thank you, bro.
- It was nothing really.

784
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:07,344
( effeminately )
Can we get on with this,
please?

785
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:09,278
Who's that?
Someone with you?

786
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,378
Sort of, yeah.

787
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:12,278
Well, where are
your manners, chump?

788
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:14,646
Introduce me to the lady.

789
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:19,147
Edwina Cutwater,
Tyrone Wattell.

790
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:20,991
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

791
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:25,248
Hairy knuckles for a chick.

792
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,614
Look, I need your help.
Can you take care of Bix
for a couple of days?

793
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:30,016
Oh, sure, I'd be--

794
00:41:30,017 --> 00:41:31,496
Wait a minute, Roger,
what's wrong?

795
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:34,683
I really don't think I can
explain it.

796
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:36,617
( sternly )
What's wrong, Roger.

797
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:39,651
Well, Edwina died today.

798
00:41:39,652 --> 00:41:42,818
Her soul entered me and took
over the right half of my body.

799
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:44,919
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

800
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,919
I knew you'd understand.
Thanks for not having me committed.

801
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,386
Roger. I got a lot of friends
crazier than you,

802
00:41:51,387 --> 00:41:53,386
but I ain't got many better.

803
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:55,087
Thanks, pal.
Go with him, Bix.

804
00:41:55,088 --> 00:41:56,854
Come on, Bix.
( barking )

805
00:41:56,855 --> 00:41:58,387
Nice meetin' you, Edwina.

806
00:41:58,388 --> 00:41:59,788
Bye.

807
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:02,030
( engine revving -
tires squeal )

808
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:08,723
Minister:
A woman who would rather
buy a candle,

809
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:11,638
than curse the darkness.

810
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:16,958
You pack 'em in, don't you?

811
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,939
Hello. Come in.

812
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:23,470
- I can start over if you'd like.
- Uh, no, thank you.

813
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,993
And we wonder, 0 Lord,

814
00:42:27,994 --> 00:42:31,361
what it means when a person
passes away

815
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:35,995
and so few take the time
to pay final respects.

816
00:42:35,996 --> 00:42:37,928
Edwina:
Oh, big deal.

817
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,195
Roger:
He's not here,
let's go find him.

818
00:42:39,196 --> 00:42:43,263
However, we received
a number of mailgrams,

819
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:45,296
from bereaved loved ones.

820
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:47,164
Edwina:
Wait! Wait! I must hear this.

821
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:50,297
Lady, I have to prepare for the
most important case of my life,

822
00:42:50,298 --> 00:42:51,665
let's get out of here, okay?

823
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:54,365
Edwina:
No. I want to hear these mailgrams.

824
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:57,099
- Oh, I really got to--
- I mean it, sit!

825
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,199
Very touching.
We will miss her.

826
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,400
The Bel Air
Oxygen Supply Company.

827
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:07,235
She was truly
a great customer,

828
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:10,101
J.J. Wheelchairs.

829
00:43:10,102 --> 00:43:12,002
Edwina:
Oh, they remembered.

830
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:14,602
From Browing Orthopedic Mattresses...

831
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:17,437
May she continue
to rest in peace.

832
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:19,636
Edwina:
Oh, how deeply touching.

833
00:43:19,637 --> 00:43:22,448
( choir begins to sing )

834
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,773
- Mr. Cobb.
- Huh?

835
00:43:35,774 --> 00:43:37,841
Mr. Cobb?

836
00:43:37,842 --> 00:43:39,287
Oh, hi.

837
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:44,775
- What time is it?
- Almost midnight.

838
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:46,308
Mr. Cobb, this morning
you were going to tell me

839
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:48,009
how you knew it didn't work.

840
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,114
( sighs )

841
00:43:52,477 --> 00:43:53,957
Edwina?

842
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:58,088
- She's asleep.
- Who's asleep?

843
00:43:58,104 --> 00:44:01,236
Edwina.
Don't wake her.

844
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:02,895
Wow.

845
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,335
This is great.
When she's asleep.

846
00:44:04,346 --> 00:44:06,348
Mr. Cobb, Miss Cutwater is dead.

847
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:10,513
No. She's not.

848
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,346
She entered me instead of you.

849
00:44:12,347 --> 00:44:14,081
What?

850
00:44:14,082 --> 00:44:17,514
- Where's the swami?
- I haven't seen him.

851
00:44:17,515 --> 00:44:18,882
Maybe he's back at the hotel.

852
00:44:18,883 --> 00:44:21,049
I just called,
there's no answer.

853
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,482
Well, we should go there
and wait for him.

854
00:44:22,483 --> 00:44:24,616
I've got to find that guy.
I can't take more...

855
00:44:24,617 --> 00:44:26,816
- Oh, God!
- You poor dear.

856
00:44:26,817 --> 00:44:29,784
You must relax.
Stop worrying.

857
00:44:29,785 --> 00:44:32,422
Oh, no. I really think
we oughta go find him.

858
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:35,718
I'm sure he'll be at
the funeral tomorrow morning.

859
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:38,285
And if Miss Cutwater
really is inside you,

860
00:44:38,286 --> 00:44:44,067
he will help her leave
your body, and enter mine.

861
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:47,357
I think I envy her.

862
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:53,621
Mr. Cobb,

863
00:44:53,622 --> 00:44:58,589
this morning when I placed
your hand on my heart,

864
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,094
did you feel anything special?

865
00:45:02,258 --> 00:45:04,123
Yes,

866
00:45:04,124 --> 00:45:05,658
I felt your left--

867
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:10,039
Yes, I felt something
very special pass between us.

868
00:45:11,726 --> 00:45:15,125
Oh, Mr. Cobb, by this time
tomorrow my soul will be gone.

869
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:18,438
I want to know love
one last time.

870
00:45:19,594 --> 00:45:20,794
Don't you think
we really oughta go--

871
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:24,227
Please, Mr. Cobb.

872
00:45:24,228 --> 00:45:28,803
Let me take the memory of passion
to sustain me in the next world.

873
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:33,196
So this would be like...

874
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:36,397
...for a good cause?

875
00:45:36,398 --> 00:45:38,173
Oh, yes.

876
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,263
We have to be very quiet.

877
00:45:43,264 --> 00:45:45,107
I'm not sure
that will be possible.

878
00:45:53,448 --> 00:45:56,328
It's a good cause.
It's a good cause.

879
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:05,367
I'm ready, Mr. Cobb.

880
00:46:05,368 --> 00:46:06,500
Take me.

881
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:08,413
Shhh! Keep sleeping, Edwina.

882
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,674
Now.

883
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:24,374
( both moaning )

884
00:46:28,206 --> 00:46:30,243
Edwina:
What-- what is all this?

885
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:33,406
What's going on here?

886
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:35,239
- No.
- Oh, yes.

887
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,239
Edwina:
What are you doing to her?

888
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,574
Roger:
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

889
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:42,419
Go back to sleep, you're dreaming.

890
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:45,508
Why, Miss Hoskins!
You whore!

891
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:47,608
You lascivious whore.

892
00:46:47,609 --> 00:46:49,843
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

893
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:52,109
You're a shameless little slut.

894
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,043
- Yes.
- Shut up!

895
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,853
Talk dirty.

896
00:46:56,601 --> 00:46:59,278
You're nohing
but a cheap sex tramp.

897
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:00,478
( laughing )
Good!

898
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:03,278
Now call me a poodle, Mr. Cobb.

899
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,779
Call me a cheap slut,
sex poodle.

900
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,679
Why you deserve a good
spanking!

901
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,346
( excitedly )
Oooh! Mr. Cobb!

902
00:47:09,347 --> 00:47:12,346
Oh you, you little bad bunny.

903
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:15,881
- Edwina, no!
- Mr. Cobb, yes.

904
00:47:15,882 --> 00:47:16,814
You love rocket.

905
00:47:16,815 --> 00:47:18,581
( gasps )
Stop talking like that.

906
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:21,682
Oh, spank me again, you bad boy.

907
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:23,348
Edwina, stop it!

908
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:25,449
I will not!
She should be ashamed of herself.

909
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:26,516
And you should, too!

910
00:47:26,517 --> 00:47:28,816
Hey, hey, hey stop!

911
00:47:28,817 --> 00:47:29,796
Mr. Cobb?

912
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:35,190
For God's sake, Edwina,
go away, will you?

913
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:36,401
I own that body!

914
00:47:36,412 --> 00:47:38,118
What if you got her pregnant?
You have no right.

915
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:40,352
No, you have no right.
<i> </i>

916
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:41,786
And you have no class.

917
00:47:41,787 --> 00:47:44,653
You're rude, crude
and thoroughly unattractive.

918
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,497
God, it is Miss Cutwater.

919
00:47:49,955 --> 00:47:52,054
I'm sorry you had
such a lousy life.

920
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:54,588
I really am. But just because
nobody ever did this with you

921
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:57,089
doesn't mean the rest of us
have to go without.

922
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,889
As a matter of fact,
I am quite proud of my virginity!

923
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,923
It's something
I have always treasured.

924
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:04,310
Of course you did!
Nobody else ever wanted it!

925
00:48:05,492 --> 00:48:08,063
( door slams )
Terry, wait!

926
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:16,101
( sighs )

927
00:48:21,361 --> 00:48:22,794
Lady...

928
00:48:22,795 --> 00:48:25,260
if Prakha caca doesn't
show up by tomorrow

929
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:27,461
I'm going to get a lobotomy...

930
00:48:27,462 --> 00:48:30,328
or a high colonic or something.

931
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:32,896
But you're getting
the keys to the street.

932
00:48:32,897 --> 00:48:34,729
Oh, stop being such a martyr.

933
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,763
As soon as I'm not dead anymore,
I'll pay you for your trouble.

934
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:40,097
Pay me? Oh, Jesus,

935
00:48:40,098 --> 00:48:42,964
I just realized why no one
showed up at your memorial services.

936
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:45,764
You forgot to hire mourners.

937
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:50,065
Edwina:
You are an insensitive horse's ass,
do you know that?

938
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:52,411
Oh, drop dead.

939
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:56,566
Look, Cobb, I am talking to you.

940
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:59,434
For your information,
there's a perfectly good reason

941
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:02,635
nobody showed up
at my memorial service.

942
00:49:02,636 --> 00:49:03,835
Yeah, what?

943
00:49:03,836 --> 00:49:08,003
I don't have any friends.

944
00:49:08,004 --> 00:49:10,369
I'm looking back
at an entire lifetime

945
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,970
and I don't have one friend.

946
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:17,004
( begins to sob )
I never had any friends.

947
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:20,605
I've had only nannies
and tutors

948
00:49:20,606 --> 00:49:22,806
and servants and nurses.

949
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:25,239
( sniffling )

950
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,373
Once my parents hired a clown
to entertain me,

951
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:30,540
but he didn't like me.

952
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:33,108
And when my parents weren't
in the room,

953
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:35,374
he'd just sit there.

954
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:39,051
( sobbing )
He didn't lift a finger
to amuse me.

955
00:49:45,344 --> 00:49:47,076
That's a terrible clown.

956
00:49:47,077 --> 00:49:50,677
Yes.
Well, that's not all.

957
00:49:50,678 --> 00:49:52,411
When Fred's daughter
was a little girl,

958
00:49:52,412 --> 00:49:55,912
she'd come to my house
to visit her father

959
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:58,045
and the nurses would push
my oxygen tent

960
00:49:58,046 --> 00:50:01,279
over to the bedroom window
so I could watch her

961
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,346
and all of her little friends

962
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:06,880
ride my horses
and swim in my pool

963
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:10,048
and run and play and laugh

964
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,960
( sobbing )
and dance.

965
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,649
Then I swore,
I'd give every cent I ever had

966
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,350
to be able to do all that.
To be free.

967
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:24,422
To be like her.

968
00:50:26,265 --> 00:50:30,126
( sighing )
Well, I've humiliated myself.

969
00:50:31,453 --> 00:50:34,252
Anyway, what I really
wanted to say was

970
00:50:34,253 --> 00:50:37,201
I'm sorry if I spoiled
your birthday.

971
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:42,454
And I'm sorry if I made you
being dead an unpleasant experience.

972
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:45,355
I am dead, aren't I?

973
00:50:45,356 --> 00:50:48,755
Oh, please, make me not dead.

974
00:50:48,756 --> 00:50:50,256
( continues to cry )

975
00:50:50,257 --> 00:50:53,089
I can't, Edwina.

976
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,366
( clears throat )
No sense wishing.

977
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:00,591
Oh, I feel much better.

978
00:51:00,592 --> 00:51:04,091
It's really late.
Why don't you go back to sleep.

979
00:51:04,092 --> 00:51:06,825
Well, aren't you coming to bed?

980
00:51:06,826 --> 00:51:10,059
( yawns )
I can't.

981
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:13,293
I've got to prepare
for this case tomorrow.

982
00:51:13,294 --> 00:51:15,360
You go to sleep.

983
00:51:15,361 --> 00:51:17,861
Edwina: ( yawning )
Okay.

984
00:51:17,862 --> 00:51:21,061
Good night, Roger.
<i> </i>

985
00:51:21,062 --> 00:51:22,804
Good night, Edwina.

986
00:51:25,263 --> 00:51:28,096
Edwina:
Roger? Roger?

987
00:51:28,097 --> 00:51:30,096
Roger, wake up.

988
00:51:30,097 --> 00:51:32,764
Wake up, Roger.
Funeral time.

989
00:51:32,765 --> 00:51:34,431
Let's go.
We've got to get up, Roger.

990
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:36,564
Come on!
Up, up, up, up.

991
00:51:36,565 --> 00:51:37,840
Let's go!

992
00:51:39,066 --> 00:51:42,533
( sighs )
Did you have a good night's
sleep last night?

993
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:43,766
Oh, yeah.

994
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,682
Got the full seven--
seven and a half minutes.

995
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:51,706
Oh, God.

996
00:51:55,069 --> 00:51:57,769
( chanting )

997
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:01,240
( telephone rings )

998
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:09,618
( flushes toilet -
telephone continues to ring )

999
00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:20,817
Edwina:
Roger!

1000
00:52:27,308 --> 00:52:28,708
Alright! Alright!
I'm awake. I'm awake.

1001
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:30,208
Edwina:
Well you have no idea
what it's like

1002
00:52:30,209 --> 00:52:33,509
to be inside a healthier body
than you've ever been in before.

1003
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:37,515
I know. That's what
I was trying to find out last night.

1004
00:52:38,244 --> 00:52:40,710
I can not believe you're
still upset about that.

1005
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:43,501
Careful, careful.

1006
00:52:43,512 --> 00:52:46,736
Of course you can't.
Can we hurry this up, please?

1007
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:47,946
See, your problem is,

1008
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:49,880
you don't understand how
life is to be lived.

1009
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:52,280
It's to be experienced
and savored.

1010
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:54,381
Edwina:
Oh, I know that you big dope.

1011
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:56,181
Why do you think I've gone
to so much trouble and expense

1012
00:52:56,182 --> 00:52:58,181
to buy myself another chance?

1013
00:52:58,182 --> 00:53:00,315
( gargling )

1014
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:02,148
'Cause you're operating under
the mistaken assumption

1015
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:03,648
that it's going to make
a difference.

1016
00:53:03,649 --> 00:53:06,250
Oh, come on.
It will, too, make a difference.

1017
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:10,250
Inside your new body
you'll still be the same 'ol sour puss.

1018
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:12,751
You'll wind up as bitter and
alone as you always have been.

1019
00:53:12,752 --> 00:53:14,418
Edwina:
Oh, I think not.

1020
00:53:14,419 --> 00:53:18,318
I'm gonna dance, Roger.
I'm gonna twirl and whirl and spin.

1021
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,819
I'm gonna cha-cha-cha.

1022
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,386
I'm gonna dip deeply.
<i> </i>

1023
00:53:23,387 --> 00:53:25,887
- Go like this.
- It's too unattractive.

1024
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:27,720
So is a deep scar.
Just do as I say,

1025
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:29,257
we don't have time to argue.

1026
00:53:30,256 --> 00:53:31,821
( mumbling )
What's the big hurry anyway?

1027
00:53:31,822 --> 00:53:34,288
My funeral's not until 10:30.

1028
00:53:34,289 --> 00:53:36,489
I have to be in court at 8:30.

1029
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:38,822
How are you gonna make
the 10:30 funeral

1030
00:53:38,823 --> 00:53:41,190
if you have to be in court?

1031
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:43,556
I'll figure it out
at 10:29, okay?

1032
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:47,506
You are so cranky when you
haven't had enough sleep.

1033
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:52,392
And you recognize your
signature on this check?

1034
00:53:52,393 --> 00:53:53,992
Yes.

1035
00:53:53,993 --> 00:53:55,760
And on this?

1036
00:53:55,761 --> 00:53:57,060
Yes.

1037
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:59,360
And this?

1038
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,961
Yes.

1039
00:54:00,962 --> 00:54:02,771
No further questions.

1040
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:05,827
Counselor?

1041
00:54:05,828 --> 00:54:07,308
Edwina:
Roger?

1042
00:54:08,863 --> 00:54:10,728
Roger?
<i> </i>

1043
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:12,163
Roger? Oh, my God.

1044
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:14,062
You can't fall asleep on me now.

1045
00:54:14,063 --> 00:54:15,629
Judge:
Counselor?

1046
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,197
( effeminately )
Just a second.

1047
00:54:18,198 --> 00:54:20,764
Edwina:
Roger, please, wake up.

1048
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:23,474
Counselor, the court is waiting.

1049
00:54:27,767 --> 00:54:29,337
Well...

1050
00:54:32,801 --> 00:54:34,019
Your honor--

1051
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,640
Edwina:
Edwina, a man, act like a man.

1052
00:54:36,651 --> 00:54:38,127
( Voice deepens )
Your honor, ah...

1053
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:39,168
( clears throat )

1054
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:41,167
your honor...

1055
00:54:41,168 --> 00:54:43,979
( grumbling - coughing )

1056
00:54:52,204 --> 00:54:54,549
( clears throat - spits )

1057
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:58,372
Proceed with the witness.

1058
00:54:58,373 --> 00:54:59,738
What the hell's the matter
with you?

1059
00:54:59,739 --> 00:55:01,305
I'm just a little nervous,
that's all.

1060
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:02,939
( whispering )
Don't be nervous.

1061
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,439
It's just your career
that's at stake, that's all.

1062
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,207
( gasps )
Mr. Schuyler...

1063
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:10,740
you didn't really
give those women

1064
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:14,053
a half million dollars in gifts now,
did you?

1065
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:19,619
Yes, I did.

1066
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,010
Well, I'll bet you had
a darn good reason to,

1067
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:26,184
now didn't you, sport?

1068
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,344
( whispering )
Why are you acting like this?

1069
00:55:29,345 --> 00:55:30,930
Say yes.

1070
00:55:32,312 --> 00:55:33,444
Yes.

1071
00:55:33,445 --> 00:55:34,412
( scuffs )

1072
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:37,951
He had a darn good reason.

1073
00:55:39,447 --> 00:55:42,013
- Proceed.
- Proceed?

1074
00:55:42,014 --> 00:55:45,881
Edwina:
Proceed, Edwina, like a man.
Like a man.

1075
00:55:45,882 --> 00:55:48,385
( gagging sounds )

1076
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,483
( effeminately )
Wait a second, every Christmas
you gave me--

1077
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:58,082
( voice deepens )
You gave Miss Cutwater
darling little gifts, now didn't you?

1078
00:55:58,093 --> 00:56:00,531
- Yeah.
- So, it's your practice.

1079
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:03,550
Indeed, ladies and gentlemen
of the...

1080
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:05,151
...world.

1081
00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:08,874
It's standard practice among
many business professionals

1082
00:56:08,885 --> 00:56:12,519
to reward valued clients
with gifts, is it not?

1083
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,286
( blows nose )

1084
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,987
( clears throat )
Yeah.

1085
00:56:16,988 --> 00:56:18,587
( excitedly )
Yes, it is!

1086
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:22,487
Objection!
The money in question came
from the Schuyler's personal account

1087
00:56:22,488 --> 00:56:24,021
and not from the law firm.

1088
00:56:24,022 --> 00:56:26,355
And therefore cannot
be construed as business gifts.

1089
00:56:26,356 --> 00:56:28,288
( gasps )

1090
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:30,702
Good point, toots.

1091
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,423
Women, huh?
Can't live with 'em,

1092
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:35,328
Can't live without 'em.
<i> </i>

1093
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,591
Edwina:
Oh, Roger, please wake up.

1094
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:39,295
( sighs )

1095
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:43,478
Judge:
Mr. Cobb?

1096
00:56:44,926 --> 00:56:47,100
Edwina:
I'm sorry, Roger.

1097
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:53,467
( screaming )
Roger! Wake up!

1098
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,728
( panting )

1099
00:56:57,729 --> 00:56:59,861
Mr. Cobb, are you alright?

1100
00:56:59,862 --> 00:57:02,395
Yeah.
No problem.

1101
00:57:02,396 --> 00:57:05,296
How do you respond
to the objection?

1102
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,800
Objection?

1103
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:10,405
Ah, could you read that back?

1104
00:57:11,158 --> 00:57:14,083
The money in question came from
the Schuyler's personal account,

1105
00:57:14,094 --> 00:57:16,060
not from the law firm
and therefore

1106
00:57:16,071 --> 00:57:18,879
cannot be construed
as business gifts.

1107
00:57:19,226 --> 00:57:20,825
( Roger to himself )
Business gifts?

1108
00:57:20,826 --> 00:57:23,859
Edwina:
I'm sorry, I couldn't
think of anything else.

1109
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,835
Roger:
Edwina, you're brilliant.

1110
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,792
Your honor,

1111
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:31,393
Mrs. Schuyler's sole source
of support was Mr. Schuyler,

1112
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:34,094
whose sole source of income
was the law firm.

1113
00:57:34,095 --> 00:57:36,261
So the better the law firm's
business was

1114
00:57:36,262 --> 00:57:39,795
the more money Mr. Schuyler
could take home to Mrs. Schuyler.

1115
00:57:39,796 --> 00:57:43,163
Therefore, since business gifts
are intended to increase
business,

1116
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:46,363
the more generous Mr. Schuyler
was with his gift giving,

1117
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:48,331
the better able he was
to support Mrs. Schuyler

1118
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:50,437
in the manner to which
she's become accustomed.

1119
00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:58,332
Give me a minute.

1120
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,937
( sighs )

1121
00:58:01,867 --> 00:58:04,733
( to himself )
Edwina, I could kiss you.
We're gonna win it.

1122
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:07,209
I'm gonna get my partnership
and we're gonna make that funeral.

1123
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:09,634
Of course, none of those
women were clients,

1124
00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:11,568
but I won't tell anyone
if you won't.

1125
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:12,735
Edwina:
What?

1126
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:14,569
I'm going to overrule
the objection.

1127
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,702
( gasping )

1128
00:58:15,703 --> 00:58:17,236
- Thank you, your honor.
- Edwina: Just a second,

1129
00:58:17,237 --> 00:58:19,637
if they're not his clients,
then this isn't fair.

1130
00:58:19,638 --> 00:58:22,037
Your honor, I move we dismiss
claims for damages

1131
00:58:22,038 --> 00:58:23,871
on the grounds that
those women were not his--

1132
00:58:23,872 --> 00:58:25,171
Shut up!

1133
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:28,538
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.

1134
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:30,039
Judge:
Just tell me what you said.

1135
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,739
I didn't say anything.

1136
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,505
- Were not his what?
- Nothing, your honor.

1137
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:35,185
Those women were not his client---

1138
00:58:35,196 --> 00:58:37,046
Mr. Cobb, are you alright?

1139
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:38,923
Just bit my tongue, that's all.

1140
00:58:39,174 --> 00:58:43,451
Mr. Schuyler, were any of those
women clients of yours?

1141
00:58:43,462 --> 00:58:45,204
( effeminately )
Ah, here we go.

1142
00:58:47,643 --> 00:58:50,043
No!
You're dead meat, buddy.

1143
00:58:50,044 --> 00:58:51,276
It's not me,
it's Edwina Cutwater,

1144
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,543
her soul's inside me.

1145
00:58:52,544 --> 00:58:54,009
Oh, that's right,
blame it all on me.

1146
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,577
Well, it is your fault,
I had this case won.

1147
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:57,647
No, I had it won!
But it would have been wrong!

1148
00:58:57,658 --> 00:58:59,091
What the hell is going on here?

1149
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,044
It's not fair and I will not be
a party to unfairness.

1150
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:03,578
Edwina, we're in a court of law.
Fairness has nothing to do with it.

1151
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,945
That will cost you
five hundred dollars.

1152
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:07,212
Contempt of court!

1153
00:59:07,213 --> 00:59:09,446
- Good for you, judge.
- A thousand dollars!

1154
00:59:09,447 --> 00:59:12,680
- Will you shut up?
- No, you shut up! Fifteen hundred!

1155
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:14,947
Not you, her.
I got someone inside me!

1156
00:59:14,948 --> 00:59:16,381
Well then both of you shut up!

1157
00:59:16,382 --> 00:59:17,881
Don't you tell me
to shut up, Charles.

1158
00:59:17,882 --> 00:59:19,514
I contributed to your campaign.

1159
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:24,516
Two thousand dollars and bailiff
throw this jackass out of my court!

1160
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:27,255
I'm going to the state bar.
You're a lunatic.

1161
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:28,956
You can't do this to me.

1162
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:30,773
Mifflin:
He's not just a lunatic,
he's a pervert, too.

1163
00:59:30,784 --> 00:59:32,351
He plays with himself
in the men's room.

1164
00:59:32,352 --> 00:59:33,684
And he cheated on me, daddy.

1165
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:35,384
He had sex with a dead body
in your office.

1166
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:36,888
You're fired, Cobb!

1167
00:59:39,377 --> 00:59:43,952
Edwina:
Oh, Roger, I see what you mean
about life is to be savored.

1168
00:59:43,953 --> 00:59:47,187
It's so, it's so dramatic.

1169
00:59:47,188 --> 00:59:50,187
I am going to kill you.

1170
00:59:50,188 --> 00:59:52,221
Edwina:
I was just trying to help.

1171
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:53,964
You failed!

1172
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:57,089
You know what's happened to me
since you've been helping me?

1173
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,389
I've lost me girl!
I've lost my job!

1174
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,709
I've alienated my dog!

1175
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,723
I broke my sunglasses!

1176
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:06,046
You can't even get
that kind anymore.

1177
01:00:06,057 --> 01:00:09,491
- Stop helping me!
- You know, you are so ungrateful.

1178
01:00:09,492 --> 01:00:11,524
If it weren't for me
you would get that partnership

1179
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,759
and then you'd have to take
cases like that.

1180
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,792
And kiss your father's
high ideals goodbye.

1181
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:20,588
You'd also be married to Peggy.
You call that savoring life?

1182
01:00:21,694 --> 01:00:24,427
Look who's talking about
savoring life.

1183
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:28,138
I spent my life in a sick bed.
What's your excuse?

1184
01:00:30,066 --> 01:00:32,916
You know, it's just like a dead person
to say something like that.

1185
01:00:39,031 --> 01:00:41,864
- How much to the airport?
- Uh, thirty bucks.

1186
01:00:41,865 --> 01:00:43,865
Make it a hundred.
Pan Am Airlines.

1187
01:00:43,866 --> 01:00:45,431
See that he gets on the plane.

1188
01:00:45,432 --> 01:00:47,665
Geez, lady, this plane
don't leave till midnight.

1189
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:49,627
- Make it two hundred.
- No problem.

1190
01:00:49,638 --> 01:00:51,380
No problem.
( car starts )

1191
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:53,975
- Bon voyage.
- Voyage?

1192
01:00:56,901 --> 01:00:59,711
We're wasting our time here.
Let's get to the cemetery.

1193
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,219
He better be there, lady.

1194
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:04,089
- Maybe Terry picked him up.
- He just better be there!

1195
01:01:04,322 --> 01:01:05,954
( elevator bell rings )

1196
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:07,654
Edwina:
Oh, there's the elevator.
Hurry!

1197
01:01:07,655 --> 01:01:09,829
Oh, I love running.

1198
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:22,690
- Have you seen Prakha?
- I was hoping you had.

1199
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:25,358
I stopped by the hotel
this morning, but he wasn't there.

1200
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,125
Oh, I'm ruined. God.

1201
01:01:27,126 --> 01:01:29,625
( horns playing softly
in the background )

1202
01:01:29,626 --> 01:01:31,659
Edwina:
What is that?

1203
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,093
And who are all those people
behind my hearse?

1204
01:01:35,094 --> 01:01:37,160
Roger:
Oh, I invited them.

1205
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:38,693
Edwina:
What do you mean?

1206
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:40,727
Last night while
you were asleep,

1207
01:01:40,728 --> 01:01:42,761
I wanted to surprise you.

1208
01:01:42,762 --> 01:01:46,662
I thought it might make your
funeral a little more fun.

1209
01:01:46,663 --> 01:01:47,843
I don't know.

1210
01:01:51,264 --> 01:01:52,971
Edwina?
<i> </i>

1211
01:01:54,397 --> 01:01:56,346
Edwina?

1212
01:01:58,832 --> 01:02:02,256
You got a little mirror?
Uh, compact or something.

1213
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:04,501
Thank you.

1214
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:08,766
( music continues playing )

1215
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,134
( sobbing )

1216
01:02:11,135 --> 01:02:13,513
Oh, Roger, thank you.

1217
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:17,301
Okay, okay.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

1218
01:02:17,302 --> 01:02:21,069
I just-- I just did it
'cause I thought I liked you.

1219
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,502
I've gotten over that since then.
Now, come on.

1220
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:25,823
Edwina:
It's alright. I'm okay now.
( clears throat )

1221
01:02:25,834 --> 01:02:27,537
Really, I'm fine.
( sniffling )

1222
01:02:27,538 --> 01:02:31,342
- You're okay?
- Yes. ( sobbing )

1223
01:02:31,353 --> 01:02:35,804
It's the nicest thing anybody's
ever done for me.

1224
01:02:35,805 --> 01:02:37,472
Don't say that.

1225
01:02:37,473 --> 01:02:39,371
Well, it is.

1226
01:02:41,406 --> 01:02:44,406
You're the best friend
I've ever had.

1227
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:45,977
( sighs )

1228
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,831
- Thanks.
- Are you alright?

1229
01:02:53,842 --> 01:02:56,717
Oh, yeah.
The music got to me.

1230
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:04,706
Minister:
...and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

1231
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:06,844
Amen.

1232
01:03:06,845 --> 01:03:08,011
crowd: Amen.

1233
01:03:08,012 --> 01:03:11,323
( dixieland style music begins )

1234
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:22,020
Terry?

1235
01:03:24,182 --> 01:03:27,448
I have this
terrible feeling we're never
going to see Prakha Lasa again.

1236
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:29,215
Oh, I gotta find that guy.

1237
01:03:29,216 --> 01:03:32,115
- Maybe he's back at the hotel.
- I told you, he's not there.

1238
01:03:32,116 --> 01:03:34,926
Let's call the police,
file a missing persons report.

1239
01:03:34,952 --> 01:03:36,851
Hey, maybe he's trying
to get home.

1240
01:03:36,852 --> 01:03:39,318
- Let's check the airport.
- Actually, you may be right
about the hotel.

1241
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:41,485
He's bound to turn up
there eventually.

1242
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:43,555
- We should try there first.
- Okay.

1243
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:55,588
- What are you doing?
- We may not have another chance.

1244
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:57,521
Oh, but I really don't think
I can--

1245
01:03:57,522 --> 01:03:59,622
Please, Roger,

1246
01:03:59,623 --> 01:04:02,456
I want to feel your naked skin
next to mine.

1247
01:04:02,457 --> 01:04:05,857
I want to feel our bodies merge.

1248
01:04:05,858 --> 01:04:08,323
Well, I guess there's nothing
wrong with a quick, little merge.

1249
01:04:08,324 --> 01:04:10,391
Edwina:
Oh, no you don't.

1250
01:04:10,392 --> 01:04:12,424
Do we have to go through
this again?

1251
01:04:12,425 --> 01:04:15,625
Roger: Why don't you just relax,
maybe you'll learn something.

1252
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:18,292
Edwina:
I thought we were going
to find Prakha Lasa?

1253
01:04:18,293 --> 01:04:20,726
Roger:
I'm just taking a little breather,
that's all.

1254
01:04:20,727 --> 01:04:22,693
Edwina:
Yes, well, put your little breather

1255
01:04:22,694 --> 01:04:25,260
back inside your trousers
and let's go find him.

1256
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,761
- Roger, what's wrong?
- What?

1257
01:04:27,762 --> 01:04:29,294
Don't I excite you?

1258
01:04:29,295 --> 01:04:31,928
Edwina, what are you doing?

1259
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:35,029
Edwina:
I am think of very old nuns.

1260
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,829
Oh, please don't do this to me.

1261
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:39,296
Roger, don't you want me?

1262
01:04:39,297 --> 01:04:42,564
Oh, God.
Now she's thinking of dead kittens.

1263
01:04:42,565 --> 01:04:44,545
Would you excuse us?

1264
01:04:47,665 --> 01:04:49,498
Alright.

1265
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:52,066
What happened to
"Oh, Roger, you're my best friend"?

1266
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:55,733
I just don't feel like performing
a sexual act on Fred's daughter.

1267
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:58,400
Okay, okay. How about if she
preforms one on us?

1268
01:04:58,401 --> 01:05:00,333
- No!
- Please?

1269
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:03,667
No! No! What is so important
about sex?

1270
01:05:03,668 --> 01:05:05,501
What's so important about--

1271
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:08,502
That's like saying,
"What's so important about laughing?"

1272
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:12,303
or, Duke Ellington,
or the World Series?

1273
01:05:12,304 --> 01:05:14,103
It's one of those things
that makes you feel like

1274
01:05:14,104 --> 01:05:16,971
you're really living,
like you're glad to be alive.

1275
01:05:16,972 --> 01:05:19,171
I am already glad to be alive.

1276
01:05:19,172 --> 01:05:22,405
I don't need to play tonsil
hockey with some english tart,
to feel good.

1277
01:05:22,406 --> 01:05:24,472
I already feel good.
I feel wonderful.

1278
01:05:24,473 --> 01:05:26,806
In fact, I feel...

1279
01:05:26,807 --> 01:05:28,406
quite tingly.

1280
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:31,073
That's right.
Those are my tingles you're feeling.

1281
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:32,640
What do you mean?

1282
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:35,540
It's called sexual...

1283
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:37,675
- ...excitement.
- It is?

1284
01:05:37,676 --> 01:05:40,941
Yes.
And if you think this feels good,

1285
01:05:40,942 --> 01:05:43,309
wait'll you feel hot...

1286
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,742
passionate...

1287
01:05:44,743 --> 01:05:47,010
boffing feels like.

1288
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:49,377
And what happens?
Bigger tingles?

1289
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,378
Oh, major tingles.

1290
01:05:52,379 --> 01:05:54,811
But will she still respect us
in the morning?

1291
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:56,811
She doesn't respect us now.

1292
01:05:56,812 --> 01:05:58,224
Let's boff.

1293
01:06:00,346 --> 01:06:03,513
Edwina: ( gasps )
Oh, dear, this could
be sort of embarrassing.

1294
01:06:03,514 --> 01:06:05,080
Roger:
For who?

1295
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:07,113
Edwina:
For me. As soon as I get
Terry's body,

1296
01:06:07,114 --> 01:06:09,380
you'll know what
I look like naked.

1297
01:06:09,381 --> 01:06:12,014
Roger:
I swear to God
I'll never tell anyone.

1298
01:06:12,015 --> 01:06:13,782
Edwina:
Okay, thank you.

1299
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:15,315
Roger:
You're welcome.
Now, shut up!

1300
01:06:15,316 --> 01:06:18,549
Edwina:
Well, what should I do?
How can I help?

1301
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,416
Roger:
Fantasize.

1302
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:22,316
Edwina:
Okay, I'm good at that.

1303
01:06:22,317 --> 01:06:24,250
- Oh, Terry.
- Oh, Roger.

1304
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:25,710
Oh, Clark.

1305
01:06:26,418 --> 01:06:27,897
Wait a second.
Wait!

1306
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:30,488
( sighs )

1307
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:34,019
- What are you doing?
- I'm fantasizing.

1308
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:37,752
I know, my head is filled with pictures
of Clark Gable taking his shirt off.

1309
01:06:37,753 --> 01:06:39,720
I know.
Isn't that hot?

1310
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:42,720
No! It's sort of cooling me off,
if you know what I mean?

1311
01:06:42,721 --> 01:06:45,988
It's making me tingle
like crazy, Roger.

1312
01:06:45,989 --> 01:06:49,655
Great, great. Now, just throw
in a couple of women on top of him

1313
01:06:49,656 --> 01:06:51,589
and we're in business, okay?

1314
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,501
( reluctantly )
Okay.

1315
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:57,356
- Is it alright now?
- Sort of.

1316
01:06:57,357 --> 01:07:01,091
She's got the whole cast of
Gone With The Wind humping in my head.

1317
01:07:01,092 --> 01:07:03,191
( moaning )

1318
01:07:03,192 --> 01:07:05,458
- Oh, Roger.
- Oh, Terry.

1319
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:09,125
Edwina:
Oh, Clark. Vivian and Olivia.

1320
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:12,574
Oh, Ashley and Butterfly.

1321
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,627
( glass breaking )

1322
01:07:16,628 --> 01:07:20,028
Terry:
Oh, no. Son-of-a-bitch.

1323
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:20,961
Son-of-a-bitch?

1324
01:07:20,962 --> 01:07:22,961
I don't believe it.

1325
01:07:22,962 --> 01:07:25,462
Prakha, where the hell
have you been?

1326
01:07:25,463 --> 01:07:26,837
Been?

1327
01:07:27,363 --> 01:07:29,496
The airport?
What the hell were you doing
at the airport?

1328
01:07:29,497 --> 01:07:31,230
Prakha:
Airport?

1329
01:07:31,231 --> 01:07:35,030
Prakha, Prakha, it's now time
for Miss Cutwater's soul

1330
01:07:35,031 --> 01:07:36,564
to enter miss Hoskins.

1331
01:07:36,565 --> 01:07:38,331
Enter miss Hoskins?
<i> </i>

1332
01:07:38,332 --> 01:07:41,821
It's me, Prakha,
I'm inside Roger.

1333
01:07:42,147 --> 01:07:45,386
- ( hollers )
- Go warm up the bowl.

1334
01:07:46,225 --> 01:07:47,600
Yeah!

1335
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:50,674
( continues hollering )

1336
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:53,837
( Prakha begins chanting )

1337
01:07:55,803 --> 01:07:57,492
Terry?

1338
01:07:57,503 --> 01:07:59,635
I guess it wasn't meant
to be between us.

1339
01:07:59,636 --> 01:08:01,169
I'll always regret that.

1340
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:05,203
But I want you to know that,
wherever it is you're going,

1341
01:08:05,204 --> 01:08:07,037
I hope you'll be very happy.

1342
01:08:07,038 --> 01:08:10,404
Oh, I will. I've got a wonderful house
and beautiful horses

1343
01:08:10,405 --> 01:08:13,771
and all the money in the world
why shouldn't I be happy?

1344
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:15,317
What?

1345
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:17,225
( chuckles )
Well...

1346
01:08:17,236 --> 01:08:18,940
if you think I'm really going
to go through with this,

1347
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:20,839
you're not just stupid,
you're crazy.

1348
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,473
What do you mean?
I'll handle this.

1349
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:23,806
What do you mean?

1350
01:08:23,807 --> 01:08:25,573
When I first heard about this
I thought,

1351
01:08:25,574 --> 01:08:27,408
if the mad woman wants
to give her money away,

1352
01:08:27,409 --> 01:08:29,341
she may as well give it to me,

1353
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:32,637
but I never really thought
that the flying nun here
would pull it off.

1354
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:35,866
Wait a second.
you just can't leave her in me!

1355
01:08:35,882 --> 01:08:38,343
I'd really love to stay and chat,
darling,

1356
01:08:38,344 --> 01:08:40,627
but you served your purpose.

1357
01:08:40,877 --> 01:08:42,411
And I've got to get back
to my mansion,

1358
01:08:42,412 --> 01:08:44,744
and get ready for my party.

1359
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:46,019
Ciao.

1360
01:08:46,612 --> 01:08:50,178
Oh, by the way,
don't bother coming.

1361
01:08:50,179 --> 01:08:52,925
The guards will have orders
to keep you out.

1362
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:57,013
Bye, Roger.
Goodbye, Miss Cutwater.

1363
01:08:57,014 --> 01:08:59,947
So long, Prakha.

1364
01:08:59,948 --> 01:09:01,825
( chanting )

1365
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,848
Please, don't say it.

1366
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:09,962
Oh, dear God.

1367
01:09:09,973 --> 01:09:12,516
All I wanted was a second chance.

1368
01:09:12,517 --> 01:09:15,050
A fair shake.

1369
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:18,784
Instead I've made
a complete mess of your life.

1370
01:09:18,785 --> 01:09:20,684
And I've...

1371
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:24,785
I've left all my money
to a lying, cheap slut,

1372
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,596
sex poodle.
Oooh!

1373
01:09:34,621 --> 01:09:38,026
Prakha, I want you
to release my soul.

1374
01:09:38,037 --> 01:09:39,688
Give Roger his freedom.

1375
01:09:39,689 --> 01:09:42,855
No! She double crossed us,
we can fight this.

1376
01:09:42,856 --> 01:09:47,756
No. Perhaps Prakha can
put my soul into an eagle.

1377
01:09:47,757 --> 01:09:51,424
Or some wonderful bird, Roger.

1378
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:54,725
So that I can fly free
with the wind.

1379
01:09:54,726 --> 01:09:57,400
Hover over my house...

1380
01:09:57,411 --> 01:09:59,482
and shit on her head.

1381
01:09:59,493 --> 01:10:01,285
Stop talking like that.

1382
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:04,295
I can't help it.
I'm pissed.

1383
01:10:06,428 --> 01:10:09,594
I became a lawyer because
I wanted to fight injustice.

1384
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:12,363
I wanted to help the little guy
against the big guy.

1385
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,576
Big guy!

1386
01:10:13,587 --> 01:10:17,569
Instead, I wound up representing
powerful rich people like you.

1387
01:10:18,752 --> 01:10:23,753
But now, don't you see,
you're pauper.

1388
01:10:23,764 --> 01:10:25,431
You're bilked out of
what is rightfully yours

1389
01:10:25,432 --> 01:10:29,953
by Miss Terry Hoskins,
who is today one of the wealthiest
women in the state of California.

1390
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:33,042
And you wanna be a bird?
Forget it!

1391
01:10:33,053 --> 01:10:34,531
Oooh!

1392
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:36,509
Don't go soft on me now.

1393
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:39,642
Oh, it's not that.
It's just that offering you your freedom

1394
01:10:39,643 --> 01:10:42,576
is the first unselfish thing
I've ever done.

1395
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:44,076
How's it feel?

1396
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:45,610
Oh, wonderful.

1397
01:10:45,611 --> 01:10:47,244
You're okay, Edwina.

1398
01:10:47,245 --> 01:10:50,385
Give me the number of the
Fulton Norris Orchestra, please.

1399
01:11:19,018 --> 01:11:23,115
Dad, you don't have to do that.
You're not an employee anymore.

1400
01:11:23,126 --> 01:11:27,282
- Someone's got to do it.
- I shall hire someone.

1401
01:11:27,293 --> 01:11:29,206
Pack your things.
You're moving up to the house.

1402
01:11:29,207 --> 01:11:31,112
I won't move in there.
It's not right.

1403
01:11:31,123 --> 01:11:34,541
Yes, you will.
I won't have people saying
my father lives in a stable.

1404
01:11:34,542 --> 01:11:37,875
I bought you a tuxedo.
You're coming to the party tonight.

1405
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,508
For God's sake take a bath!

1406
01:11:39,509 --> 01:11:43,795
You know, you're nicer to that
horse than you are to people.

1407
01:11:43,806 --> 01:11:46,010
Why don't you take him
to your party?

1408
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,896
If I thought it were appropriate,
I would.

1409
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:53,445
Oh, you're lucky
you're a gelding.

1410
01:11:53,446 --> 01:11:56,145
Norris: Snap it up, guys.
Thank you.

1411
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:59,479
Smile please. And if you have
to winkie let's do it now.

1412
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,051
We'll have a full rehearsal
in five minutes.

1413
01:12:07,748 --> 01:12:09,381
Come on, come on.

1414
01:12:09,382 --> 01:12:10,690
Come on.

1415
01:12:13,449 --> 01:12:16,149
Roger, exactly how you plan
on pullin' this off?

1416
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:18,049
Beats the heck outta me.

1417
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,717
Well, if I can be of
any help at all,

1418
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:21,417
you in worse trouble
than I thought.

1419
01:12:21,418 --> 01:12:22,726
That's right.

1420
01:12:25,794 --> 01:12:28,317
Roger:
Strum, strum, strum.

1421
01:12:28,318 --> 01:12:31,259
Edwina:
Oh, this is so much
more fun than being a lawyer.

1422
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:32,294
Roger:
I know.

1423
01:12:32,305 --> 01:12:35,920
Edwina:
I think you should forget the
law and become a musician full time.

1424
01:12:35,921 --> 01:12:38,125
Roger:
Oh, it's a nice dream,
but I can't.

1425
01:12:38,136 --> 01:12:41,880
Edwina: Roger, there's
nothing sadder then looking back
at the end of your life and saying,

1426
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:45,591
"I didn't do it right."
And believe me, I know.

1427
01:12:45,602 --> 01:12:49,612
Roger:
Yeah, my solo's comin' up.
I need control of my hand.

1428
01:12:49,623 --> 01:12:51,865
- Can you give it to me?
- Sure.

1429
01:12:55,436 --> 01:12:57,609
( hard rock riff )

1430
01:13:00,665 --> 01:13:02,380
Edwina:
Oops, sorry again.

1431
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:04,436
( heavy sigh )

1432
01:13:04,437 --> 01:13:06,104
Is this some sort of a joke?

1433
01:13:06,105 --> 01:13:08,085
You didn't like that?

1434
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:15,639
Listen, I'll be okay.
I just need a minute.

1435
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,939
Alright, gentlemen.
Let's take a break.

1436
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,706
Who are those guys?

1437
01:13:19,707 --> 01:13:21,840
- Bring the bowl.
- The bowl.

1438
01:13:21,841 --> 01:13:22,979
Come on.

1439
01:13:25,408 --> 01:13:27,208
You know, your friend's
a real freak.

1440
01:13:27,209 --> 01:13:28,552
Thank you.

1441
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:35,375
Fred:
See you in the mornin'.

1442
01:13:35,376 --> 01:13:38,790
I'm gonna put on
a bloody tuxedo.

1443
01:13:56,697 --> 01:13:58,689
( chanting )

1444
01:14:02,332 --> 01:14:04,878
Oh, Edwina?

1445
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:12,850
Okay, Miss Hoskins.

1446
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:13,886
Hoskins.

1447
01:14:20,152 --> 01:14:22,393
- Grab the bowl!
- Stop it!

1448
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:25,426
( chanting )

1449
01:14:41,089 --> 01:14:43,502
Edwina in bowl?

1450
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:48,172
- Where's Edwina?
- Edwina.

1451
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:52,257
- Edwina in water?
-  Edwina.

1452
01:14:52,258 --> 01:14:54,992
You just made
a big mistake, buster.

1453
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:56,639
Guards!

1454
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:01,226
Can you put Edwina
back in the bowl?

1455
01:15:01,227 --> 01:15:02,126
Back in bowl.

1456
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:03,492
Yes, back in bowl.

1457
01:15:03,493 --> 01:15:05,793
- Yes, back in bowl.
- Back in bowl. Nyhm.

1458
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:07,603
Nyhm? Whatta you mean?

1459
01:15:09,962 --> 01:15:12,209
Oh, you have to fix the bowl?

1460
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:13,773
- Fix bowl.
-  Fix bowl.

1461
01:15:13,784 --> 01:15:15,062
-  Fix bowl.
- Fix bowl.

1462
01:15:15,063 --> 01:15:17,462
- You put Edwina back in bowl.
- Back in bowl.

1463
01:15:17,463 --> 01:15:19,062
Edwina, back in bowl.

1464
01:15:19,063 --> 01:15:20,130
- Go fix bowl.
- Go fix bowl.

1465
01:15:20,131 --> 01:15:21,474
Go, go, go!

1466
01:15:24,865 --> 01:15:28,278
Edwina, if you can hear me,
blow some bubbles or something.

1467
01:15:29,899 --> 01:15:31,776
I'm talking to a bucket.

1468
01:15:32,678 --> 01:15:34,802
Get the bucket.
Get the bucket.

1469
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:38,075
Don't let him get away. Hurry!

1470
01:16:03,215 --> 01:16:06,383
Ty, feel this.
Take good care of it.

1471
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:07,482
What is it?

1472
01:16:07,483 --> 01:16:09,382
It's very, very special.

1473
01:16:09,383 --> 01:16:10,418
No problem.

1474
01:16:25,553 --> 01:16:28,160
Hey, where are you going
with that green bucket?

1475
01:16:34,721 --> 01:16:36,291
Get out of my way!

1476
01:16:54,028 --> 01:16:55,927
Oooh, damn!

1477
01:16:55,938 --> 01:16:57,441
It's alright.

1478
01:17:01,093 --> 01:17:02,424
Terry, No!

1479
01:17:05,061 --> 01:17:06,860
Want us to throw
him out, ma'am?

1480
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,686
No, he's harmless, now.

1481
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,776
Goodbye, Edwina.

1482
01:17:32,599 --> 01:17:34,099
Good evening.

1483
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,266
Ah, Mr. Mifflin.
Good evening, Mr. Schuyler.

1484
01:17:37,267 --> 01:17:38,833
We have rather
a pleasant orchestra.

1485
01:17:38,834 --> 01:17:40,567
Why don't you come and dance?

1486
01:17:40,568 --> 01:17:42,411
Good evening, senator.

1487
01:17:42,968 --> 01:17:45,034
Daddy, how debonair.

1488
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,501
Oh, good evening.
I'm Terry Hoskins.

1489
01:17:47,502 --> 01:17:49,346
Welcome to Hoskins Manner.

1490
01:17:50,444 --> 01:17:52,374
( singing quietly )
All of me...

1491
01:17:53,804 --> 01:17:57,115
why not take all of me...

1492
01:17:59,338 --> 01:18:01,909
can't you see...

1493
01:18:02,872 --> 01:18:05,410
I'm no good without...

1494
01:18:23,076 --> 01:18:26,701
God rest her wonderful soul.
I'll never forget her.

1495
01:18:26,712 --> 01:18:28,609
Just remember how
comforting it will be

1496
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:30,643
to look around
this magnificent home

1497
01:18:30,644 --> 01:18:33,784
and always see a little bit
of Edwina in everything.

1498
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:37,793
Yes, especially the flower bed.

1499
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:39,956
Yes.

1500
01:18:45,781 --> 01:18:49,558
Ty, I thought I had
everything under control.

1501
01:18:50,582 --> 01:18:54,914
I'm sorry mah man.
I did not see her grab the pitcher.

1502
01:18:54,915 --> 01:18:56,215
You know what I'm sayin'?

1503
01:18:56,216 --> 01:18:58,782
It's not your fault, Ty.

1504
01:18:58,783 --> 01:19:01,560
Oh, man, I feel empty.

1505
01:19:02,717 --> 01:19:05,283
You know,
I know this sounds crazy...

1506
01:19:05,284 --> 01:19:08,050
but I actually miss
the old girl.

1507
01:19:08,051 --> 01:19:10,484
Who are you calling
an old girl?

1508
01:19:11,387 --> 01:19:13,556
It's not funny, Ty.

1509
01:19:13,738 --> 01:19:17,104
I'm not trying to be funny,
you-- you peasant.

1510
01:19:17,168 --> 01:19:18,452
Edwina?

1511
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,352
No, it's Pearl Bailey.
Who the hell do you think it is?

1512
01:19:21,353 --> 01:19:23,254
Oh, Edwina.

1513
01:19:23,255 --> 01:19:25,687
Hey, hey,
that's my side, stupid.

1514
01:19:25,688 --> 01:19:28,454
- I'm over here.
- What are you doing in Ty?

1515
01:19:28,455 --> 01:19:31,088
How should I know,
I can't see a thing in here.

1516
01:19:31,089 --> 01:19:33,822
Oh, man, when you set
that pitcher down here

1517
01:19:33,823 --> 01:19:37,490
and said take care of it,
I thought it was gin and I drank some.

1518
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:39,124
You mean you've been
inside all the time?

1519
01:19:39,135 --> 01:19:40,590
Why didn't you say something?

1520
01:19:40,591 --> 01:19:42,757
I wanted to see
if you missed me.

1521
01:19:42,758 --> 01:19:45,091
Cute, cute, cute, oh God!

1522
01:19:45,092 --> 01:19:46,503
Come on, Ty. Come on.

1523
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,339
- Come on.
- Hey, Bix.

1524
01:19:55,294 --> 01:19:56,637
Prakha?

1525
01:19:57,495 --> 01:19:58,994
Fix bowl.

1526
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:01,861
- Ah, fix bowl. Great.
- Edwina in water?

1527
01:20:01,862 --> 01:20:04,028
No, no! Edwina not in water.
You're not gonna believe this.

1528
01:20:04,029 --> 01:20:04,961
Say something.

1529
01:20:04,962 --> 01:20:08,524
Your holiness, it is I,
Edwina Cutwater.

1530
01:20:08,535 --> 01:20:10,037
( both laughing )

1531
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:14,963
I fail to see humor
in the situation.

1532
01:20:14,964 --> 01:20:16,564
He drank her.

1533
01:20:16,565 --> 01:20:17,997
Drink her.

1534
01:20:17,998 --> 01:20:19,131
He drink her.
<i> </i>

1535
01:20:19,132 --> 01:20:20,998
He drink her?

1536
01:20:20,999 --> 01:20:23,165
If it had not been
for Mr. Wattell...

1537
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:27,399
I'd be Edwina the flower bed
right now, you big dope.

1538
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,866
Big dope!

1539
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:34,657
Look, look. Take Edwina out,
put back in me.

1540
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:36,401
- In me.
- Okay?

1541
01:20:36,402 --> 01:20:37,468
Okay.

1542
01:20:37,469 --> 01:20:38,568
Really?

1543
01:20:38,569 --> 01:20:40,811
It's the only safe place.

1544
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:44,703
Edwina:
Oh, you really
are my friend.

1545
01:20:44,704 --> 01:20:48,015
Tyrone:
I sure hope nobody
else can see this.

1546
01:20:52,071 --> 01:20:53,812
( chanting )

1547
01:20:57,539 --> 01:20:59,406
Good night.
We're in the Roosevelt, you know.

1548
01:20:59,407 --> 01:21:01,706
Yes. If you need anything
you call Grace.

1549
01:21:01,707 --> 01:21:03,243
Good night.

1550
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:08,707
Ty, don't be crazy.
You gotta get back on the bus.

1551
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:11,641
No way, Jose. I gotta find out
how this megillah ends.

1552
01:21:11,642 --> 01:21:13,441
- Ty!
- Besides...

1553
01:21:13,442 --> 01:21:17,609
I can be of help. Walking around
in the dark is my territory.

1554
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:20,010
- Okay, you're hired.
- Thank you.

1555
01:21:20,011 --> 01:21:22,477
Oh, God! This way.

1556
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:25,653
What kind of seein' eye dog
is this anyway?

1557
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:28,344
You hang back here.
<i> </i>

1558
01:21:28,345 --> 01:21:30,417
Hang back here.

1559
01:21:45,341 --> 01:21:46,821
Edwina:
Hi, sailor.

1560
01:21:48,316 --> 01:21:50,315
( whispering )
Are you having a good time?

1561
01:21:50,316 --> 01:21:52,549
I am.

1562
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:56,517
I hope I have as much fun in my
new body as I've had in yours.

1563
01:21:56,518 --> 01:21:57,963
Thanks.

1564
01:22:02,852 --> 01:22:04,018
There she is.

1565
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:08,127
Roger, now that you know what
a horrible person she is...

1566
01:22:08,602 --> 01:22:11,002
aren't you glad you
weren't intimate with her?

1567
01:22:17,122 --> 01:22:20,354
I thank my lucky stars.

1568
01:22:20,355 --> 01:22:22,122
I'm glad you said that.

1569
01:22:22,123 --> 01:22:23,488
I've been thinking...

1570
01:22:24,247 --> 01:22:29,248
if things work out, you just
might get another chance.

1571
01:22:29,441 --> 01:22:31,694
Oh, Edwina Cutwater.

1572
01:22:35,591 --> 01:22:37,093
That's our cue.

1573
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:43,871
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1574
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:00,629
Ty, watch your head.

1575
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,339
Shhh! Come on Prakha, come on.

1576
01:23:05,331 --> 01:23:07,174
Bix, go outside, go on.

1577
01:23:08,832 --> 01:23:10,298
- Prakha, take care of Ty.
- Ty.

1578
01:23:10,299 --> 01:23:12,031
- Take care of Ty.
-  Ty.

1579
01:23:12,032 --> 01:23:13,340
Good. Shhh!

1580
01:23:18,938 --> 01:23:20,534
Oooh!

1581
01:23:26,635 --> 01:23:28,201
( loud clang )

1582
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:30,205
( shhshing each other )

1583
01:23:46,405 --> 01:23:47,704
Hello, darling.

1584
01:23:47,705 --> 01:23:49,706
Watta you waitin' for, Roger?
Grab her!

1585
01:23:49,707 --> 01:23:52,739
( cocks trigger )
Watch out man,
I think she's got a gun.

1586
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:55,307
Let's all take a
little walk now, shall we?

1587
01:23:55,308 --> 01:23:57,273
Where we goin'?

1588
01:23:57,274 --> 01:24:00,074
Shhh, you don't want to
wake up the other guests.

1589
01:24:00,075 --> 01:24:01,941
What are you going to do?

1590
01:24:01,942 --> 01:24:04,541
I shall say you sneaked back
into the house to rob me.

1591
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:06,508
Oh, we in trouble, Roger.

1592
01:24:06,509 --> 01:24:08,808
That you took this gun
from my night table.

1593
01:24:08,809 --> 01:24:10,476
Big trouble.

1594
01:24:10,477 --> 01:24:12,943
You led me at gunpoint
to a quiet room.

1595
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:15,677
This is it.
Get in there!

1596
01:24:15,678 --> 01:24:17,477
How do you expect
to get away with this?

1597
01:24:17,478 --> 01:24:19,044
I'll just tell the truth.

1598
01:24:19,045 --> 01:24:22,178
You brought me to this room...
we struggled, I grabbed the gun.

1599
01:24:22,179 --> 01:24:24,178
What the hell is going on?

1600
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:25,178
( gun fires )

1601
01:24:25,179 --> 01:24:27,412
Watch out!
Sounds like a gunshot!

1602
01:24:27,413 --> 01:24:29,179
Somebody's fighting now, Roger.

1603
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,457
Somebody just knocked over
some furniture.

1604
01:24:33,314 --> 01:24:36,159
Sounds like an end table with
tchothkes keys on it, Roger.

1605
01:24:37,915 --> 01:24:40,448
It's okay, now.
It's all over.

1606
01:24:40,449 --> 01:24:41,982
Who won?

1607
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:44,682
- We did, Ty.
- I'm calling the police.

1608
01:24:44,683 --> 01:24:45,849
Good idea.
Who's that?

1609
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:48,017
No, don't!
I won't go back to jail.

1610
01:24:48,018 --> 01:24:49,416
Back to jail?

1611
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,784
Who's going back to jail?
Terry?

1612
01:24:51,785 --> 01:24:53,551
Where did all these
people come from?

1613
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:54,818
Get me the police.

1614
01:24:54,819 --> 01:24:56,852
- Police?
- That's right.

1615
01:24:56,853 --> 01:24:59,352
This is attempted homicide.
Two counts, maybe.

1616
01:24:59,353 --> 01:25:02,986
Oh, no. That'll be
her third conviction.

1617
01:25:02,987 --> 01:25:05,986
Third conviction?
You're a three time loser.

1618
01:25:05,987 --> 01:25:08,154
You're going into the slammer
and they're going to throw away the key.

1619
01:25:08,389 --> 01:25:11,631
I won't go back.
I promise I'll kill myself first.

1620
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:13,032
She would, you know.

1621
01:25:14,056 --> 01:25:16,421
Hello, police?
Yes, this is Burton Schuyler.

1622
01:25:16,422 --> 01:25:18,489
I want to report
an attempted homicide.

1623
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:20,089
- Yes, I'm over here--
- Stop!

1624
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:21,422
Miss Cutwater...

1625
01:25:21,423 --> 01:25:22,923
Yes?

1626
01:25:22,924 --> 01:25:26,840
If I go to jail,
I take my body with me.

1627
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:33,925
Hang up, Schuyler.

1628
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:35,701
I'll make a deal with you.

1629
01:25:36,726 --> 01:25:38,331
( chanting )

1630
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,616
Terry.

1631
01:25:58,798 --> 01:26:01,631
Oh, my lord,
that was powerful.

1632
01:26:01,632 --> 01:26:02,838
Edwina.

1633
01:26:03,566 --> 01:26:04,704
Roger.

1634
01:26:05,866 --> 01:26:09,533
It worked. It really worked.

1635
01:26:09,534 --> 01:26:11,411
Is Terry in there, too?

1636
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:15,212
She's gone.

1637
01:26:23,702 --> 01:26:25,046
Terry?

1638
01:26:28,937 --> 01:26:32,003
Are you sure this is what
you want, honey bun?

1639
01:26:32,722 --> 01:26:34,326
( whinnies )

1640
01:26:34,371 --> 01:26:35,871
Thank you, ma'am.

1641
01:26:35,872 --> 01:26:37,904
I don't know how I'm
going to explain this

1642
01:26:37,905 --> 01:26:39,972
to her parole officer.
Thank you.

1643
01:26:39,973 --> 01:26:42,139
That's quite alright, Fred.

1644
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,472
Come on, baby.

1645
01:26:43,473 --> 01:26:46,373
I'm gonna fix you up
a nice private stable

1646
01:26:46,374 --> 01:26:49,739
and never leave daddy again.

1647
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:53,140
No more thieving,
no more swindling...

1648
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,541
just runnin' and prancin'

1649
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:58,908
and jumpin' for the rest
of your life.

1657

So, how do you feel?

1658
01:27:43,518 --> 01:27:46,966
Alive and healthy and...

1659
01:27:48,352 --> 01:27:49,785
and scared.

1660
01:27:49,786 --> 01:27:51,518
Why?

1661
01:27:51,519 --> 01:27:55,627
Because I finally got
what I always wanted...

1662
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:58,920
and I've no excuses anymore.

1663
01:27:58,921 --> 01:28:01,265
Yeah, welcome to the real world.

1664
01:28:06,189 --> 01:28:08,968
- What?
- Tingles.

1665
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:11,489
It's supposed to.
You oughta try it more often.

1666
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,457
Is that advice
from my lawyer?

1667
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:16,156
Lawyer, hell. I'm no lawyer.
I'm a musician.

1668

- You are?
- Yeah.

1669
01:28:18,258 --> 01:28:20,991
You know, I've had more real
feeling in the last two days

1670
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:23,792
than I've had in the last
ten years in that damn office.

1671
01:28:23,793 --> 01:28:25,825
Those papers stacked
up to here and

1672
01:28:25,826 --> 01:28:28,726
that florescent lighting
burning off all my vitamins.

1673
01:28:28,727 --> 01:28:32,293
Unlike you, most of us only get
to go around once in life and

1674
01:28:32,294 --> 01:28:35,494
I'm not going to spend the rest
of mine sitting behind a desk.

1675

Oh, I love it when you talk
like a beer commercial.

Hey, let's dance.

1677
01:28:41,229 --> 01:28:43,295
I don't know how.

1678
01:28:43,296 --> 01:28:44,929
Oh, it's easy.

1679
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:47,570
Now, put your feet
on top of mine.

1680
01:28:48,564 --> 01:28:51,738
Come on. This is how kids
learn how to dance. See?
