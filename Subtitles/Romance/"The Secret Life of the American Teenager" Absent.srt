Previously on "The Secret Life
of the American Teenager"...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,300
I'm... pregnant?

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,500
Amy, you can't be pregnant.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,600
Maybe we should think
about adoption.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,100
If I did end up having the baby,
do you think I could get married?

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,000
Married?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,300
Ben said he would marry me.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,700
What's the matter with my girl?

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,700
She's pregnant, George.

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't think it would be too smart
if Amy actually had your baby, do you?

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,300
What? What baby?

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,300
You mean she's having an abortion?

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,900
This is not your problem.
This is my problem.

15
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,500
If your decision is not to have the baby,

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,600
you really should talk to your parents.

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,200
Who's this Ritchie character, anyway?

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,500
Ricky. He's in the band.
You've seen him.

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,100
He's that drummer
that's always showing off.

20
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,500
This girl I don't even know and care
nothing about is gonna ruin my life.

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,000
You think Amy wanted this to happen?

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,800
Grace, I regret what I did,
and I apologize.

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,700
I take full responsibility for my actions.

24
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,400
That's more than Ricky's
ever gonna do for Amy.

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,000
Things are what they are, and we're
gonna have to figure them out.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,300
Do you think I made
the right decision?

27
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,800
I think that you made
the right decision for you.

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,600
I'm gonna drop your sister off
at school and hit the road.

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,800
You're sure you're OK
talking to your dad alone?

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,400
Yeah. I don't mind
talking to him alone.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,500
I just mind him
looking at me.

32
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,800
You look fine. You don't
even look that different.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,700
No, Mom. Look at me. I'm huge,
and I'm gonna get more huge.

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,000
It's OK, Amy. 

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Your dad loves you, and so
do I, and so does your sister.

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,400
You don't have to go away.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,800
I don't mind asking your grandmother
if you can stay with her.

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,100
I don't even mind telling her
why you want to stay with her,

39
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,800
but you don't have to stay with her.

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,900
You can stay here.

41
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,300
Mom... let me go.

42
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,500
You said I could go.
You promised me.

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I know, Amy, but I can't imagine
not seeing you every day,

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
being with you through all this.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
I don't want you
to see me like this.

46
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,200
I don't want anyone
to see me like this.

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,800
I just....I wanna do this all alone.

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,000
But you're not alone.

49
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,600
We're alone.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Finally.

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Mom's been waiting for you.
You're gonna be late for school.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,500
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
gonna be late for my period.

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Ashley, apologize.

54
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,000
Fine. I apologize.

55
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,700
But you know she's pregnant. I don't
see why some good can't come of it.

56
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,000
Why can't you make Dad come
home and have him help?

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,900
I'm not even gonna be here, Ashley.

58
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,000
I thought you two
were getting along.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,700
I thought you and Dad
were getting along.

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,900
We're talking about Amy.

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,000
That's all we ever do
is talk about Amy.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,700
Can't we talk about Dad for once?

63
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,800
Your dad is the one
who decided to leave.

64
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,500
Dad decided to leave.
Amy decided to leave.

65
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Maybe I'll decide to leave.

66
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,100
Can I go live with him?

67
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,800
May I go live with him?

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
Let's go.

69
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,500
So... that isn't a no.

The Secret Life of the American Teenager S01E07

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,900
Why can't you mother
clean out the coffeemaker?

75
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,200
No. Dad... I meant...

76
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,900
No. Sweetie, don't do that, all right?
You been crying for weeks.

77
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Come on.

78
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,200
It's OK.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
OK, it's not OK, but... I just
don't know how this happened.

80
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,400
I mean how'd it happen, Amy?
How is this possible?

81
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,100
Sex?

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,800
I guess I should've talked to
you more about personal stuff.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
Guys.

84
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,000
Where babies come from.

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,100
But... you really think you wanna go
away and live with your grandmother?

86
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,000
I mean, you think
that's the best thing?

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,500
Yeah.

88
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,200
Was that your idea
or your mom's idea?

89
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,400
I don't wanna stay here, Dad.

90
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,500
I don't wanna face everybody.

91
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,000
What about Ben?

92
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,600
I still wanna marry him, but...

93
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,900
but Mom still thinks it's a bad idea.

94
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,400
What do you think?

95
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,500
Do you have any new
thoughts on that?

96
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,000
Maybe later... when you're 30.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
Yeah.

98
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,700
When the baby's my age - 15.

99
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,200
Honey, everything's gonna be OK.

100
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
These things happen.

101
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Mainly when guys talk young girls
into doing things they shouldn't.

102
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,100
It's not all his fault.
I just let it happen.

103
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,600
No, it's his fault.
He knew what he was doing.

104
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,200
And this Ricky guy -
he knows about this?

105
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,600
Yeah, he knows.

106
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
But you haven't talked
to him face to face.

107
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
No.

108
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,300
I don't want anything
to do with that guy.

109
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,300
Little late for that.

110
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,800
After yo u have the, um... 

111
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,100
child, then what?

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,300
I can't think about that
right now, Daddy.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,100
You haven't called me that
in so long, baby.

115
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,700
Aw, Amy...

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,200
Oh.

117
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,000
Maybe it really is time
for me to come home.

118
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
So, what are you gonna do?

119
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
I'm not gonna do anything.

120
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,400
Have you talked to her?

121
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
No, I haven't talked to her.

122
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,500
Well, talk to her.

123
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,900
I don't wanna talk to her.
I don't want anything to do with her.

124
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,600
You've already had something
to do with her, son.

125
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,200
You are not my dad.

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,100
You're right, I'm not, but I've tried
to be a good father to you,

127
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,600
and now you're gonna be a father, so...

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
what kind of father
are you gonna be?

129
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
It's time to have a conversation.

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Go talk to her, today, this
morning before you go to school.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm already late,
and don't you think

132
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
if she wanted to talk to me,
she'd come talk to me?

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,900
She knows where to find me.

134
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,100
We have band together.

135
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,200
So is she gonna stay in school?

136
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,700
How would I know?

137
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,700
Wait, how could she stay in school?

138
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,200
She does have that option.

139
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,800
She's not gonna come to school
when she's having a baby.

140
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Can't you do something about that?

141
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
What would you want me to do?

142
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,300
Aren't you a social worker?

143
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,100
Yes.

144
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,800
And I encourage teenage mothers
to stay in school.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
Are you kidding me?

146
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,200
No, I am not
kidding you, Ricky.

147
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,700
I encourage you
to take responsibility

148
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,100
for whatever happens
to this baby.

149
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,200
Not exactly the responsible type
and neither is she, thus the baby.

150
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,400
Any word yet?

151
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,200
We're running out of time.
We gotta get you to school.

152
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,500
I haven't heard anything yet.

153
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
All I know she wants to leave town.

154
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,300
It's not that far away
to grandmother house.

155
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,700
We can drive up
on the weekends and see Ames.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,700
She doesn't want us to see her.

157
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,000
Or at least she doesn't
want me to see her.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,700
Is that crazy, or what?

159
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,300
She's scared, Ben.

160
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,900
I mean she's scared and she's
angry and she's overwhelmed.

161
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,100
Do her and yourself a favor and go
along with the plan, whatever it is.

162
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,200
Of course, whatever it is is
probably gonna change 

163
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,800
over and over and over again.

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,700
It's just not easy, that's all.

165
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,600
What in life is easy?
Not much, that's what.

166
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,200
Certainly not
the sausage business.

167
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,900
Come on,
we better get going.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,900
Dad...

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,700
I know, you wanna stay home.

170
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm pretty sure your mother
would want you to go to school.

171
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,700
I don't think she would.

172
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,400
All right, stay home,
as long as it's for one day.

173
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
You don't wanna stay home
and hang out with me?

174
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,900
No. Can't do, I'd rather stay busy.

175
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,600
And besides...

176
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,800
I'm pretty sure you
don't have any intention 

177
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,900
of hanging around
the house all day.

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,300
Am I wrong?

179
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,100
No.

180
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Call her, text her, do something.

181
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,700
Let me know what happens.

182
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Hello.

183
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,100
I love you.

184
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,200
Me too.

185
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
Is he still there?

186
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,100
No, he's gone.

187
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,200
Then what's the decision?

188
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,400
Decision?

189
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,200
Are you goin'?

190
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,600
Yeah.

191
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,900
I'm going to my grandmother's.

192
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,000
I thought maybe your dad
would say no.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,400
I think that's kinda up to me
to decide, don't you?

194
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,100
Ben, you can't decide for me.
I have to go. I can't stay.

195
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,000
Stay with me, at my house.

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,700
I mean just say you're going to
your grandmother's,

197
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,200
and live with me and my dad.

198
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,000
I can't do that. I don't
want you to see me, either.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,400
I have to see you.
I'll die if I don't see you.

200
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,700
OK, please don't say that.
We both know you're not gonna die.

201
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,600
It makes me feel like
you're threatening to kill yourself.

202
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,300
OK, one - "I'll feel really bad if I don't
see you" doesn't express my true feelings,

203
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,900
and two - I think you're aware
that when you lose a parent,

204
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,600
it makes you value your own life,

205
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
so I have no intention of offing myself.

206
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,100
I totally just forgot about your mom.

207
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Say something, please?

208
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,500
You really think going to your
grandmother's is the only solution?

209
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,100
No, I don't think
there is any solution,

210
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,800
but I do think
it'll make things easier.

211
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,300
Ben, this isn't easy.

212
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,300
What is?
Not much, that's what.

213
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,100
What?

214
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,000
Nothing.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,300
Why is it going to be easier for people
to see you after you've had the baby?

216
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,200
Either way, they know.

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,300
Just don't care if they know.
Don't care.

218
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,100
You can decide that, you know,
to not care what people think.

219
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,600
Who doesn't care
what people think?

220
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
Me. I don't care.

221
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,000
Come on, Amy. At least consider
going back to school.

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,100
I'll be right there with you,
holding your hand.

223
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,900
I already told you I can't.

224
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,300
They're a bunch
of high school students.

225
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,100
Ben, I'm going to my grandmother's.

226
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,700
You can come over tonight
and say goodbye if you want.

227
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,400
I'll probably leave
in the morning.

228
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
No.

229
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,300
Thanks for asking, but, no,
I don't wanna say goodbye,

230
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,100
because I don't want you
to leave.

231
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,600
Who is it?

232
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,100
It's me.

233
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,800
What are you doing here?

234
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Come on,
let's stay home today.

235
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,100
I can't.

236
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,000
Why?

237
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,300
'Cause I don't want to.

238
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,300
All right. Can I stay here?

239
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,300
I'm not in the mood
to go to school today.

240
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,400
You can't stay here.

241
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Is your mom home?

242
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,500
You know she's not.

243
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,200
Come on, Adrian. I can't
go to school today.

244
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,600
I can't.

245
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,500
Sedlack will kill you
if you don't make practice.

246
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,100
I'm already missing practice,
and I don't care about band.

247
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,000
Can I come in?

248
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,000
I need you.

249
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,700
Oh, come on.

250
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
My life is falling apart.
I need you.

251
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,900
Really. Just take a day off.

252
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,300
Call in sick, stay in bed.

253
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,900
Mnh-mnh. I have to turn in
my English Lit paper.

254
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Turn it in tomorrow.

255
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,300
No. I worked really hard on it.

256
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,500
I'm not gonna
get points taken off

257
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,900
just 'cause I didn't
turn it in on time.

258
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,300
OK, I'll come back at lunch,
after English Lit.

259
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,900
You can stay,
but I have to go.

260
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,000
What are you doing home?

261
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
Come on, you didn't think
I was actually going to school.

262
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,200
We're parent-free.

263
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,500
So, how'd it go with Dad?

264
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,700
I don't know. He cried,
and I cried...

265
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
Yeah, and?

266
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,200
And he wants to come home.

267
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,700
Thank you. Finally.

268
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,500
Just because he says that
does not mean she'll let him.

269
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,300
And aren't you concerned you're gonna
get in trouble for ditching school?

270
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah.

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,700
Guess I kinda
lowered that bar.

272
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Thank you for that, too.

273
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,400
Don't you think you're taking this
whole thing a little too seriously?

274
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,100
It's not like you're dying.
You're just having a baby.

275
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,600
Just? Just having a baby?

276
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,800
Ashley, I'm 15.

277
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,300
I don't wanna have a baby.

278
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,900
I just wanna be normal
like everyone else.

279
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
I wanna go to a normal school
and be in the band

280
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,900
and go to high school dances
and fall in love and get married

281
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,800
and then maybe have a baby.

282
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Then why did you have sex?

283
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,500
I don't know.

284
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,900
I didn't... think about it.

285
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,600
I didn't have a good reason.
I just did it.

286
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,600
Ashley, promise me that you won't
have sex until marriage.

287
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,900
Please. Not one of your fake
promises to Mom and Dad.

288
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,000
A real promise. 

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
I don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

290
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,200
Are you kidding?

291
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,300
I have condoms.
I'm not an idiot.

292
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,800
You have condoms at 13?

293
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,100
Where did you get condoms?

294
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,200
The grocery store.

295
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,400
You are not using condoms.

296
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,900
Now there's some really bad advice.

297
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,500
OK, you know what I mean, Ashley.

298
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,400
You don't need condoms.
Just say no.

299
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,300
That doesn't work, obviously.

300
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,200
I didn't say no.
I didn't say anything.

301
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,900
I just let this happen.

302
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,600
I cannot believe
I let this happen to me.

303
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Ashley, just listen to me.

304
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
You do not wanna have a baby.

305
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,100
Not at 13. That's why
I have the condoms.

306
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,900
When did you even
get condoms?

307
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,600
I dunno. Right after
I found out you were pregnant.

308
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,800
It's not like they're illegal.
Anyone can buy 'em.

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,100
Why are you in such a bad mood
this morning?

310
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,600
I thought it was
because Dad was coming over,

311
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,100
but that's obviously not it.

312
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,600
I'm not in a bad mood.

313
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,200
Yeah, you're right.
You're in an angry mood.

314
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,700
What, are you angry at that guy Ricky?

315
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,900
No. I'm just angry
with myself.

316
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,300
No, that's not it.

317
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,900
What, is it Ben?

318
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
God, how can you be angry
with a guy who loves you

319
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,600
despite the fact that
you're pregnant by another guy?

320
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,700
I just can, OK?

321
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,200
Well, it's a step up
from feeling sorry for yourself.

322
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,000
Change your mind?

323
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,200
Who are you?

324
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,300
A friend of Adrian's.

325
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,600
I didn't break in
or anything, honest.

326
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Are you breaking in?

327
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,400
I got a key. What's your name?
I recognize you.

328
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,500
Ricky Underwood.

329
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, yeah, I know you.

330
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,100
And you are?

331
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,200
I'm Amy's dad.

332
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,100
Don't you hit me. If you hit me,
I'll hit ya back, I swear.

333
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,600
Why would I hit you?

334
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, no. I know.

335
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
I know, all right.

336
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,400
And I'd like to hit you,
but if I started hitting you,

337
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
I don't think I could stop.

338
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,400
'Cause I wanna kill you.

339
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,700
But for one - I don't feel like going to
prison for killing the likes of you,

340
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,300
not that I couldn't get away with it,

341
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,200
because believe me,
people would understand.

342
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,500
And two - I don't wanna lose
any business for killing the likes of you.

343
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,900
Because you know I'm the one who would
end up paying for whatever happens here.

344
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,300
Which brings me to three -
I wanna talk to you.

345
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,400
So you listen up.

346
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,900
I don't want you involved in
anything that my daughter decides.

347
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,900
Is that clear? You have no part
in the decision-making process whatsoever.

348
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,000
And whatever decision Amy
and her mother and I make,

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,500
that's it. That's the decision.

350
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,300
Not yours.
You have nothing to say.

351
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,500
No, of course not.
It's her baby.

352
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Don't be an idiot.
It's your baby, too.

353
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,200
But you're not gonna have
anything to do with it, ever.

354
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,500
If she wants to put it up for adoption,
you're gonna sign when you have to sign.

355
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
OK.

356
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
And if she ends up
keeping it...

357
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,400
and she doesn't
want you around,

358
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,600
you're not around.

359
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,600
But believe me, you're gonna pay for
that baby for the rest of his or her life.

360
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,000
You, not me. You.

361
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,900
And that money doesn't
entitle you to a thing.

362
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,000
You give up all rights
to anything and everything

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,600
when you take advantage
of an innocent 15-year-old girl.

364
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,900
I understand,
and I'm OK with all that.

365
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,600
Band camp.

366
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,700
That's what people do nowadays
at band camp, they have sex?

367
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,600
It just happened.

368
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,000
Sex doesn't just happen.

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,700
I'm a man.

370
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,100
I know how hard it is
to get a woman to have sex.

371
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,300
Why do you have a key
to Adrian's condo?

372
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,300
It's not her condo,
it's her mother's condo.

373
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,100
I'm... putting some new
furniture in for her mother.

374
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,900
I came by to measure a room,
not that it's any of your business.

375
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,000
No, but I notice you feel comfortable here.

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,500
You opened a new jar of mayonnaise.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,200
Are you seeing Adrian's mother?
You're the boyfriend?

378
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,000
Let's just stick
with the furniture story.

379
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,200
What, you got a problem
telling a little white lie,

380
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
but you don't mind ruining
my daughter's life?

381
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,500
'Cause you ruined her life.
You realize that, don't you?

382
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,600
You ruined her life,
her sister's life,

383
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,200
her mother's life, and my life,

384
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,900
not to mention the life
of an innocent child.

385
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,800
I don't think I've ruined
anybody's life.

386
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,700
Why aren't you at school?

387
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,200
'Cause I don't feel like having
people stare at me all day.

388
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
So, what, you gonna
drop out of school, then?

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
No, I'm not dropping out.

390
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,300
I can't just drop out of school.
I'd like to, but I can't.

391
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,100
Why not? Why can't you drop
out or go to another school?

392
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,500
Amy's gonna have to go
to another school.

393
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,900
Why shouldn't you?
Oh, that's right.

394
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,000
Because people can see
that she's having a baby,

395
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,800
but you, you just get to walk around

396
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,100
like the worthless
piece of trash that you are.

397
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,100
You stay away from my daughter
and you keep your mouth shut

398
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,300
about me and Adrian's mom.

399
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,100
No one knows about that
but me, her and Adrian.

400
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,300
And now you.

401
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,700
I'm not a worthless
piece of trash!

402
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,600
*The feelings all roll back
As I flip another page*

403
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,400
*It's funny how back then I'd dream
of better days, but when it all...*

404
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,700
Hi, Adrian.

405
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
Did you say something?

406
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,400
Hi.

407
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,000
Hi what?

408
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,700
I wanted to apologize for the way
I talked to you at that clinic.

409
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,800
I was in a panic.

410
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,000
You were on a mission.

411
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,800
I was.

412
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,100
I still believe what I believe, but maybe
I could've handled the whole thing better.

413
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,300
We can have a difference
of opinion and be friends.

414
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,300
That little skirmish at the clinic
and a difference of opinion...

415
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,800
that's what you think is
keeping us from being friends?

416
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,700
How about we're not friends because... 

417
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,400
your boyfriend and I hooked up?

418
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,900
I've forgiven him.

419
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,700
What?

420
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,300
I don't know if we'll date again,
but regardless of that, I've forgiven him.

421
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,000
And... I forgive you.

422
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,800
Who are you to forgive me?

423
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,000
You're exactly right,
who am I to forgive you?

424
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,700
Forgiveness belongs to God,

425
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,000
so I'm forgetting what happened
between you and Jack.

426
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,700
I have the power to do that,
to forget, to just... let it go.

427
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,400
It still happened.

428
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:01,275
What happened?

429
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:04,770
I hooked up with Jack.

430
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:07,868
You did? I forgot.

431
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:09,932
You haven't forgotten.
You can't.

432
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:13,079
I don't think you can forget
I think it would've been a good idea

433
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,442
if Amy decided
not to have a baby.

434
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:18,046
Maybe if we were friends,
we could talk about that sometime.

435
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:20,039
Or even if we can't be friends,

436
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,115
maybe we can at least speak
in the hallway

437
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,282
without it being a big deal
like it is now.

438
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:27,195
I don't see any reason why we have 
to have hard feelings between us.

439
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:28,665
OK, what is it?

440
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:30,884
You think that if you're 
friends with me,

441
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,284
you could still hang out
with Ricky, is that it?

442
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,459
I can hang out with Ricky,
anyway, if I want to.

443
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:38,715
Your Christian parents are gonna
 let you hang out with a guy

444
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,978
that got a 15-year-old girl
pregnant?

445
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,836
I guess.

446
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:45,321
A guy like that needs friends now,
don't you think?

447
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,490
No, I don't think.

448
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:50,699
The only friend he needs is me.

449
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,595
OK.

450
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:56,347
But don't you need a friend?

451
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:59,633
You're the girlfriend of a guy
who got a 15-year-old girl pregnant.

452
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:03,124
The whole situation is so sad, I think.

453
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:06,605
Must be so tough on both of them,
having a baby so young.

454
00:21:06,605 --> 00:21:10,807
He's not having a baby.
She's having a baby.

455
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:12,308
And I hear she's
 leaving town to do it,

456
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:13,723
so she's not gonna
be around anymore.

457
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:15,785
It's over for her and Ricky.

458
00:21:15,785 --> 00:21:18,496
You don't think at some point
Ricky's gonna wanna see his own baby

459
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:21,201
or be involved with his child
as he or she grows up?

460
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:22,064
Nope.

461
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:24,908
I can't imagine Ricky would
never wanna see his own child.

462
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,860
That's 'cause you live with
two parents.

463
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:28,709
Most families
aren't like that.

464
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:30,989
Every child has two parents.

465
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,452
I don't.

466
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,987
Bye.

467
00:21:39,022 --> 00:21:41,100
Call me sometime.
We'll talk.

468
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,107
Or just drop by.
You don't have to call.

469
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:52,153
I'm not nothin'.

470
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:53,893
He has no right
to talk to me like that.

471
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:55,930
I'm a human being.
I'm as good as he is.

472
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:58,419
I could've punched
that guy.

473
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,291
But you came here instead
to talk it out,

474
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,843
so you didn't punch him.

475
00:22:01,878 --> 00:22:03,465
That doesn't mean I won't.

476
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,015
-I think it does.
-No, it doesn't.

477
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:08,045
The next time he or anyone else
tells me I'm trash, I'm gonna punch 'em.

478
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,093
No, you're not.

479
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,756
Didn't I just say I was?

480
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,643
I'm not gonna let anyone
talk to me like that ever again.

481
00:22:13,678 --> 00:22:16,690
Because you're not trash.
You're a man. You're somebody.

482
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:20,446
What are you sayin'? I'm pourin' my 
guts out, and you're mocking me?

483
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:24,347
I'm not mocking you at all.
I'm agreeing.

484
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:25,947
I don't know what
you're talking about.

485
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:29,351
Half the time I'm here, I don't know what 
you're talking about or who you're talking to.

486
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:32,481
That's because up until now,
you didn't know who you are.

487
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,312
-Who am I?
-You're a man.

488
00:22:34,347 --> 00:22:37,219
As good as Amy's dad,
as good as anyone else.

489
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:39,483
You're a human being.

490
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:41,980
No matter how you've been
treated before in this life,

491
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:45,203
you are a human being,

492
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:47,465
and human beings make mistakes.

493
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,281
How can I be a man
who's as good as everyone else

494
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:51,385
when I made the mistake
of getting a girl pregnant?

495
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,720
A 15-year-old girl is pregnant
because of me,

496
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:55,788
and I don't care
about her or the baby.

497
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:58,535
All I care about is that
her father called me trash,

498
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:01,270
and I'm not trash.

499
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:04,058
-Because?
-Because I'm not.

500
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:07,825
That is as good an
 answer as any.

501
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:11,466
You're the doorway
to self-respect.

502
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:13,305
Open it, Ricky.

503
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,911
Open it and go on in.

504
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:19,114
I don't know how.

505
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,884
I think you do.

506
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:29,409
Hello.

507
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:32,938
Anyone home?

508
00:23:38,804 --> 00:23:40,792
Came home from school for this?

509
00:23:49,183 --> 00:23:51,986
-Yeah, it's me. What do you want?
-Where are you?

510
00:23:51,986 --> 00:23:54,553
Leave a message, not that
I'll call you back.

511
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,607
So I came home.
Where are you?

512
00:23:59,863 --> 00:24:01,100
Adrian?

513
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:03,074
What are you doing here?

514
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,266
-What are you doing here?
-I live here.

515
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,892
Why aren't you
at the furniture store?

516
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:07,988
I brought you something.

517
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:10,542
-It's all set, boss.
-Thanks, fellas.

518
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,537
-You brought me something?
-Yeah.

519
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,308
Something for you
and your mom.

520
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:18,011
-I don't want anything from you.
-Fine. I'll take it back.

521
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:19,636
At least take a look
at it first.

522
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:33,721
Why would you get me a desk?

523
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,325
What am I gonna do with a desk?

524
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,291
I see you studying at the kitchen
 counter, on the couch, all over the place.

525
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:39,715
Thought you might like a desk.

526
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:40,936
What do you want?

527
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:43,397
-Nothin'.
-No, you want something.

528
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:46,260
-You all want something.
-All?

529
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:49,714
Oh, OK, I get it.

530
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:51,790
You don't want me
to say anything to Amy.

531
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,638
Of course I don't want you 
to say anything to Amy.

532
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:54,685
I don't want you to say
anything to anyone.

533
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:56,397
But this isn't a bribe,
it's a gift.

534
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:57,388
So...

535
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:58,990
did you get my mother
a new desk, too?

536
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,341
No, an armoire.

537
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:02,241
Oh...

538
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:09,239
Top-of-the-line armoire.
It was made in India.

539
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:11,868
Goodbye, George.

540
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:13,127
Goodbye?

541
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:14,776
You're breaking up with her,
aren't you?

542
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:16,111
What are you talking about?

543
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:18,917
All the last guy gave us
was a box of steaks.

544
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:22,095
I knew you were smart.
That's why I got you the desk.

545
00:25:22,095 --> 00:25:23,747
Just leave.

546
00:25:24,161 --> 00:25:26,821
Just so you know,
Ricky was here earlier.

547
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:28,596
I came by to get some things,
and he was here. 

548
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:29,892
Be careful.OK?

549
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:32,965
Or what? I'll end up pregnant?

550
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:36,463
-Everyone knows.
-All right.

551
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:37,699
Is that why you're 
going home?

552
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,154
That's none of your business.

553
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:42,682
Guys would like you anyway,
you know that, right?

554
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:43,753
What do you mean, anyway?

555
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,135
Even if you don't have sex
with 'em.

556
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:47,394
And that's
none of your business.

557
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,761
You're welcome for the desk.

558
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:10,585
Hey, jerk.

559
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:12,665
I'm sorry.
My day took a weird turn.

560
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:14,328
Yeah, so did mine.

561
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:15,719
You coming over or not?

562
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,815
Nah. Something I have to do.

563
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,366
Amy's father
said he talked to you.

564
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:23,326
He's not trying to force you
to marry her, is he?

565
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,693
No. Pretty much the opposite.

566
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:29,896
Look, I can't ignore the fact
that I'm the father of a baby.

567
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:31,713
Sure you can.
Lots of guys do.

568
00:26:31,713 --> 00:26:33,640
Lots of guys? Like who?

569
00:26:33,683 --> 00:26:35,227
Like my father.

570
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:37,219
I didn't know.

571
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:39,763
You do what you have to do.
I don't care.

572
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:42,447
Yeah, ya do care, and I know
you were counting on me to come over,

573
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,138
and I'm sorry.

574
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,671
I'm gonna start being
more responsible.

575
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,014
I just have to
take care of something.

576
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:51,084
Look, I don't need you
to come over.

577
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:52,637
 I have friends.

578
00:26:52,637 --> 00:26:54,399
No, you don't.

579
00:27:07,382 --> 00:27:08,552
Call her back?

580
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:11,419
Yeah, called her back.

581
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:12,347
Good.

582
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:15,326
That's a start. What's next?

583
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,283
Hi.

584
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,430
Hi. I didn't know you guys
were stopping by

585
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,789
during school hours,
uninvited.

586
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:32,917
Your dad called.

587
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,742
He thought maybe
you needed some company.

588
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:37,063
No, that's fine.
Thank you, though.

589
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:38,305
Did you hear from Amy?

590
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:40,474
-Is she...
-Leaving?

591
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:42,358
I guess so.

592
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:44,429
Are you going over to her house
to say goodbye?

593
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,365
No.

594
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,172
No.

595
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,351
I can't.

596
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:51,275
You have to say goodbye.

597
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,511
Doesn't matter.
She'll be back.

598
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:56,340
Yeah, eventually.

599
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:59,899
She doesn't want me to see her,
either, when she gets...

600
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:02,653
bigger.

601
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,832
Like that would matter to me.

602
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:07,646
All right, you guys
make yourselves at home.

603
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,181
Want some company?

604
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:12,208
No. I got my dad's driver
for company, but thanks.

605
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:16,063
Sweet.

606
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:18,322
We can't just stay here
when Ben's not here.

607
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,223
Yeah, we can.

608
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:20,438
We're his best friends.

609
00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:24,499
Yeah, which is why he left us his
 room for the first time ever.

610
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,656
Have we ever
been in here alone?

611
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:27,950
Is this a set-up?

612
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,840
-No, I swear.
-I'm not having sex.

613
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,839
Is that why you wanted me
to come here, to have sex?

614
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,168
It's pretty much why I do
everything - to have sex.

615
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:35,347
But we don't have sex.

616
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,082
But we could if we wanted.

617
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:39,053
I have a condom.

618
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:41,503
You think because we're in high school, 
we're supposed to have sex?

619
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:44,873
I don't know about supposed to,
but I'd really like to,

620
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:47,512
and you said you wanted to
take the next step, right,

621
00:28:47,512 --> 00:28:51,778
before, when you decided,
so now I decided.

622
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:54,504
By next step, I didn't mean
actual intercourse.

623
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:55,507
I meant next step.

624
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:58,079
Yeah, and I think we took
that next step.

625
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,319
Please, Alice.

626
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,175
Maybe on your birthday,
if you don't beg. I hate begging.

627
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,671
My 16th birthday?

628
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:05,718
Oh, no. 

629
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:08,390
I don't know why
I said that. No, probably not.

630
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,325
-But maybe.
-No.

631
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:12,061
-Come on, say maybe.
-No.

632
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:14,370
-I already said I hate begging.
-OK, I hear ya.

633
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:16,085
I can live with no.

634
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:17,341
You'll have to.

635
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:24,680
When we get older and we do get 
married and we do have sex,

636
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:27,370
I bet it's going to be
really good sex.

637
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:30,217
Most people
don't have good sex.

638
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:34,511
52% of Americans 16 and older
are not fully satisfied with their sex lives.

639
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,722
But we're not like most people.

640
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:37,929
How can you look at me
and still wanna have sex?

641
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:40,748
How can I look at you
and not wanna have sex?

642
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:49,794
But I'm a man, and I can
take no for an answer.

643
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:55,893
Good, because
you'll have to,

644
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:59,219
at least for a few more birthdays
or until I decide otherwise.

645
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:14,339
 Amy, it's me.

646
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:16,410
-Oh, no.
-Who's me?

647
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,313
It's Ricky.
Can I talk to you?

648
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:19,345
No, no, no.

649
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:26,636
Uh, is Amy home?
I'm her friend Ricky.

650
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:31,384
Could we talk?

651
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:33,032
I don't know.

652
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:36,827
I talked to your dad earlier,
or he talked to me.

653
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:38,431
My dad?

654
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:43,709
Look, Ricky, I'm not sure
I really wanna talk to you now.

655
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,381
I'm not sure I wanna talk
to you, but we have to talk.

656
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:48,404
No, we don't have to talk.

657
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:49,931
Are your parents home?

658
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,899
Why?

659
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:53,522
If they're not, I'll come back and talk to you
when one of them is here,

660
00:30:53,522 --> 00:30:55,633
either your mom, your dad,
or both.

661
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,606
I think it's best if we have a chaperone,
parent-type chaperone,

662
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,348
maybe not in the same room,
but in the house, anyway.

663
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:03,160
What do you even
wanna talk about?

664
00:31:05,856 --> 00:31:07,090
She knows.

665
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,991
I know everything,
and I have condoms.

666
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,184
I'll come back.

667
00:31:13,184 --> 00:31:16,288
Considering our situation, I'd like to have
one of your parents here.

668
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:18,714
I'd like to talk
before you leave town.

669
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:21,324
Are you leaving?
That's the rumor around school.

670
00:31:21,324 --> 00:31:22,808
Maybe. 

671
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:26,227
Did you say you actually
talked to my dad earlier?

672
00:31:26,227 --> 00:31:30,075
Yeah, and I made some promises to him
I don't think I can keep.

673
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:31,049
Like?

674
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:33,889
Like I think I do wanna
be involved.

675
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:35,177
Seriously?

676
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:36,217
Involved?

677
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:37,792
I'm the father of this child,

678
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:40,508
and I think I should have
some say in what happens here.

679
00:31:41,874 --> 00:31:45,742
Just call me when I can come over
and talk to you, OK?

680
00:31:53,854 --> 00:31:56,055
OK, now I see how it happened.

681
00:31:58,614 --> 00:32:00,646
She's beautiful,
don't you think?

682
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:08,232
I know we're a little young,

683
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:12,376
and... she's
a little pregnant...

684
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:17,270
...but I'm really in love,

685
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,549
and I don't think
she understands that.

686
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,216
If she did, I don't think she'd 

687
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:26,198
be running off
to her grandmother's house.

688
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,709
This is the woman I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

689
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:35,316
She says she feels
the same way about me, but...

690
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:39,169
I don't know.

691
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:43,746
Of course, it's complicated,
but life is complicated.

692
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,753
Heh. I sound like Dad,
don't I?

693
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:51,745
Except Dad would add,
"Sausage is complicated."

694
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:53,843
Probably. 

695
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:56,977
That's not her,
you know.

696
00:32:57,495 --> 00:32:58,634
It's her.

697
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:02,888
Nah, that's the container that holds
 the container that used to be her.

698
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:08,082
Is this the first time you've come to see her
since we said goodbye to her?

699
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:11,332
It is, yeah.
I don't like coming here.

700
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,488
But I didn't come for her,
I came for you.

701
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:17,279
Why do you come here every year
on the anniversary of her death?

702
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:19,972
Why do you do this
to yourself every year?

703
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:22,195
'Cause every day
would be too often.

704
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:24,527
Life is for the living, son.

705
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:27,121
You can talk to the deceased
but not the living?

706
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:28,521
Join the living.

707
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:31,112
If Amy's leaving
and going to her grandma's,

708
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:32,481
then that's what's happening.

709
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,226
Do you won't be together
for the rest of your lives.

710
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:37,915
It means she's going away
for a while.

711
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:40,215
For a while. Get it?

712
00:33:40,216 --> 00:33:42,341
She's not leaving forever.

713
00:33:42,341 --> 00:33:44,218
She's choosing to go.

714
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,509
Mom, she didn't have a choice,
but Amy is...

715
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:51,096
You can't have your way
on this one, Benjamin.

716
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:54,104
Jue I couldn't
have my way on that one.

717
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:56,087
Live with it.

718
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:27,138
I'm really happy
you stopped by.

719
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:29,068
And surprised.

720
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,296
Yes, we're very happy.

721
00:34:30,296 --> 00:34:33,601
We're very happy.
We've heard so much about you.

722
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:37,858
From me. That's why
we are surprised.

723
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:38,980
Yeah.

724
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:45,247
I remember the other time
I was surprised to see you.

725
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:48,122
Why don't we just
let that go, Tom? Let it go.

726
00:34:48,758 --> 00:34:50,941
Really. We're really happy
you stopped by.

727
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:52,322
I didn't have your number.

728
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:55,503
I don't usually just
stop by anywhere.

729
00:34:55,503 --> 00:34:57,548
I don't even know why
I did this.

730
00:34:57,548 --> 00:34:59,915
Maybe it's because I asked
if you wanted to be friends.

731
00:35:00,102 --> 00:35:01,931
I'd really like to be friends.

732
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:03,194
Really?

733
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:05,678
Yeah, Grace is friends
with lots of people, Tom.

734
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,755
Lots of people.
She's very friendly.

735
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:10,863
Um, are you hungry?

736
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:11,936
Have you had dinner?

737
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:14,519
I'm not hungry. I don't
usually eat this early.

738
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,767
We don't either, but my wife
had a function at church,

739
00:35:16,768 --> 00:35:17,847
lots of leftovers,

740
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,765
so I can fix you a plate.
I'll get you something.

741
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,549
No, I'm really
not hungry.

742
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:24,559
Is it me?

743
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,683
Sometimes
I make people nervous.

744
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,059
Oh, no.I like you.

745
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,487
You seem to be pretty honest.

746
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:32,562
Yeah, I am.

747
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:35,187
-Well, not that many people are honest.
-Yeah.

748
00:35:35,187 --> 00:35:37,157
-Yeah.
-True.

749
00:35:37,157 --> 00:35:42,236
I know. You thought Ricky
is here.

750
00:35:42,236 --> 00:35:43,860
Oh, no. I know where he is.

751
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:46,282
Is he at Amy's?

752
00:35:46,282 --> 00:35:48,931
-And you would know that how?
-I was guessing.

753
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:50,808
I told you at school
I thought maybe Ricky

754
00:35:50,808 --> 00:35:53,760
was capable of taking some
 responsibility for what happened.

755
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:56,315
Not that I know him
better than you.

756
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:58,798
I'm just an optimistic person.

757
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:01,869
Just being optimistic,
hoping for the best.

758
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,943
And in this situation,
what do you think is the best?

759
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:07,299
Ahem. Why don't you let me
take this one, all right?

760
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:12,411
Um, in this situation, I think the very
 best possible choice for Amy and Ricky

761
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:15,869
would be to find a loving family
to adopt the baby.

762
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:17,498
That way,
when the baby grows up,

763
00:36:17,498 --> 00:36:20,196
he or she can be thankful
to both of them

764
00:36:20,196 --> 00:36:23,130
for providing a loving family
that has two adults

765
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,239
that can actually
take care of him or her.

766
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,647
Yeah. That's good.

767
00:36:28,907 --> 00:36:31,599
Tell you what - Tom,
why don't we give the girls

768
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,033
a little private time
to talk? What do you say?

769
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:38,004
Good night.

770
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:40,562
Really nice to meet you.

771
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:41,570
You too.

772
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:53,696
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

773
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:55,980
I don't wanna talk
about Ricky or the baby.

774
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,383
I thought I did,
but I don't.

775
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:02,289
I don't know, I didn't want him
to be my only option tonight.

776
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:04,477
I should go.

777
00:37:04,478 --> 00:37:05,634
No, please, stay.

778
00:37:05,634 --> 00:37:07,737
When you drop by, you're
supposed to stay a while.

779
00:37:07,737 --> 00:37:08,912
There are rules?

780
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:11,216
No, but hang out.
We'll talk about something else.

781
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:12,432
Anything else.

782
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:14,073
Like?

783
00:37:14,073 --> 00:37:17,440
Like... I don't know.

784
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,748
I don't have any girlfriends
that I do this with, either,

785
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:21,764
so...

786
00:37:21,764 --> 00:37:23,679
I'm not really any better
at this than you.

787
00:37:30,693 --> 00:37:32,419
So what's new in your life?

788
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:35,319
Oh, I got a new desk.

789
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:37,486
A desk? That's great.

790
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:39,109
 I'd love
to come see it sometime.

791
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:40,405
OK.

792
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:42,679
Where did you get it, online?

793
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,406
I got a great desk online
one time.

794
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:48,333
Uh, no.Actually, it was a gift
from my mother's boyfriend.

795
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,738
Yeah.

796
00:37:56,605 --> 00:37:57,969
How'd you get home from school?

797
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,125
Taxi.

798
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,493
You don't have
that kind of cash.

799
00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:01,820
I took the bus.

800
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,767
You don't even know
where the bus is.

801
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:04,882
I walked.

802
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,621
All the way home
from school?

803
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:10,262
Do people at school know?

804
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:11,305
Know what?

805
00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:12,792
About your sister?

806
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,240
The whole world knows.

807
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:15,049
How do they know?

808
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:16,828
How does everyone know?

809
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,731
Well, the people at school
have brothers and sisters

810
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,327
who go to school with Amy.

811
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:25,180
Welcome home, Dad.

812
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:26,655
Hello, princess.

813
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:35,325
I saw we had company,
so I came around the side.

814
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:36,837
Whose car is that?

815
00:38:36,837 --> 00:38:37,892
Can he stay?

816
00:38:37,893 --> 00:38:39,951
Why don't you let
your father and I talk?

817
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:43,267
Can't the three of us talk?
It is about the three of us,

818
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,940
especially if Amy's
going off to Mimsy's.

819
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:46,826
OK.

820
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:49,294
Why don't we start with how
 you got home from school today?

821
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:53,075
Right. I guess you have, um,

822
00:38:53,075 --> 00:38:56,768
more important things
to talk about than me.

823
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:04,271
She hitched a ride with the bagboy
from the grocery store.

824
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:05,349
The college kid?

825
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:07,881
He saw her walking home
and picked her up.

826
00:39:08,498 --> 00:39:11,910
The cashier we like told me when I
 stopped in the market on the way home.

827
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:14,837
She skipped school,
George.

828
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,905
You know, maybe it
 really is time I come home.

829
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:20,256
Or not.

830
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:21,546
We got one daughter
who's pregnant

831
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:22,816
and another one
who's skipping school.

832
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:23,712
Your point being?

833
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:25,888
Point being is you
need me around here

834
00:39:25,888 --> 00:39:27,583
Correct me if I'm wrong,

835
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:30,601
but weren't you living here
when Amy got pregnant?

836
00:39:30,822 --> 00:39:34,086
And I'm pretty sure you were here this
 morning when Ashley skipped school.

837
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:36,789
Come on. I know
we have problems,

838
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:38,684
but we're not gonna fix our marriage
with me outta the house.

839
00:39:38,684 --> 00:39:41,951
It took me a few weeks to realize it,
 but, hey, at least I realized it.

840
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,750
I'm not so sure I wanna fix
our marriage.

841
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,808
Did you tell Mimsy you and I are living apart?
Does your mother know?

842
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:48,271
She doesn't need
to know that.

843
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:50,794
I can't imagine
she'd be too happy about it.

844
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:54,070
She likes me...
better than you, even.

845
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,248
Yeah, she likes everyone
better than me.

846
00:39:58,384 --> 00:40:00,277
So... Amy?

847
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:03,773
She can stay there. I got
a referral for a doctor,

848
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:06,232
and I met her,
she seems very nice.

849
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,860
She's getting Amy into a group
with other teen mothers.

850
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,536
I don't want my daughter
associating with girls like that.

851
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:13,548
Come on, I wanna come home.

852
00:40:13,548 --> 00:40:15,143
Where are you staying now?

853
00:40:15,631 --> 00:40:17,129
You know, here and there.

854
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:21,178
I checked our credit-card account,
 and there aren't any hotel bills on there.

855
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,641
You're not staying
at the store, are you?

856
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:26,001
Well, I'm...

857
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,540
Yeah, I didn't think so.

858
00:40:29,043 --> 00:40:31,903
So why don't you slither
on back down the driveway,

859
00:40:31,903 --> 00:40:33,914
back to wherever it is
that you are staying?

860
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:35,821
Where's Amy?

861
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:37,157
She's talking to Ricky.

862
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:40,132
-I told him to leave her alone.
-I told her to talk to him.

863
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:41,571
We'll see who's right
about this.

864
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:44,315
Call me when you need my help,
'cause you're gonna need my help.

865
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:46,366
-Good night, George.
-Good night, Anne.

866
00:40:48,716 --> 00:40:50,063
This is my house, too,you know.

867
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:51,247
Yeah, I know.

868
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:00,797
I'm not saying
I'm against adoption.

869
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:03,295
I'm saying I'd like to know
who's adopting, where they live,

870
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:05,419
and if I can see my own kid.

871
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:08,106
I really don't see why you
 should have any say in this.

872
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:11,037
You and your dad
would like to ignore I even exist.

873
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:14,636
You know what? I don't know
what my father said to you,

874
00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:17,334
but I am perfectly capable
of speaking for myself!

875
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:18,437
Since when?

876
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:20,269
Since I got pregnant!

877
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,692
That's when.

878
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:24,088
Since I discovered I'm going
to have to take charge

879
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:26,039
of another human being's life.

880
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:28,638
I might as well start
with my own.

881
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:29,983
OK, OK.

882
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:32,022
But I'd like to know where you are
and what's going on,

883
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,638
if you don't mind.

884
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,121
Maybe I do mind.

885
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:39,705
I'll think about what you said,
and I'll call you.

886
00:41:40,072 --> 00:41:42,814
When? When are you
gonna call me?

887
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:44,103
When I feel like it.

888
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:46,302
OK, I'll take that.
Thanks.

889
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,522
You're welcome.

890
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:49,270
Now go home.

891
00:41:51,193 --> 00:41:53,316
Do you wanna exchange
phone numbers?

892
00:41:53,316 --> 00:41:58,148
No. I'm pretty sure I can find your number
 if and when I want to call you.

893
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,436
Good night.

894
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:01,506
Good night.

895
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:10,642
What?

896
00:42:10,642 --> 00:42:13,250
I was hiding in the bushes.
I hope you don't mind.

897
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,197
I was coming up the walk,
and I saw your dad pull up,

898
00:42:15,197 --> 00:42:18,599
and I knew Ricky was inside,
so... I got stuck.

899
00:42:19,108 --> 00:42:20,463
I don't mind.

900
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,471
I don't mind at all.

901
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:28,086
No, no, no. Stay.

902
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:32,609
That bump - that's not me.

903
00:42:33,672 --> 00:42:35,455
It's the baby.

904
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:37,826
Yeah, I thought so.

905
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:40,799
The baby.

906
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:45,413
Don't shut me out, Amy.

907
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,817
Please don't shut me out.

908
00:42:51,546 --> 00:42:55,872
