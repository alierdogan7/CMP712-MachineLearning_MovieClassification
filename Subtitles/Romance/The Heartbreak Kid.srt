1
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,293
That there is Eddie again
something touching?

2
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:42,203
If, some new nike arrived
to the store, it is brilliant

3
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:43,874
Leave me reformular the question

4
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,975
Is there urgado some vagina?

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,809
No, dad, there is not urgado
any vagina

6
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,676
Seriously...

7
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,111
Seriously dad, alone that
I am not going out for the time being with anybody

8
00:00:54,387 --> 00:01:00,417
Not I understand, if you refuse yourself to marry it is
to refuse you to enjoy the life, it is as...

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,719
...to live in the purgatory

10
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,262
Dad, I don't refuse myself to marry
alone I want to make it with the suitable person

11
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,158
Pardon to bother you but
I want you to be happy

12
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,370
I hate that are alone
a lifetime

13
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,333
He won't be,
I will go to a wedding

14
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,667
Ah already knows, the weddings are a good place
to know women

15
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,274
Who does marry?

16
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:19,945
Jodi

17
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,445
- That?
- Seriously?

18
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,951
- Dad goes!
- Eddie, don't make you this

19
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,780
We are still friends

20
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:34,288
Alone I say that to walk somewhere around
with your former-engaged one...

21
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,755
...he/she smells a little to...

22
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,457
No, we already pass that

23
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,757
Everything will be Catholic

24
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,457
We will be alone a little close

25
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:46,001
I believe that you should not make it
but perhaps alone I am antiquated

26
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,971
He/she forgets the wedding, your and I go to Las Vegas
with luck hayaremos a couple of women

27
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:56,172
If, I have to say that the idea
of going out with my setentero father it is tempting...

28
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,078
...but I already made plans, but
I appreciate the offer, we go

29
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,455
- Can he/she give me a beer?
- I want a Cosmopolitan

30
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,123
Cosmopolitan?

31
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,733
- Is a drink of women not?
- Oh if

32
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,733
If, it has induced me

33
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,230
- Deveras?
- If

34
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,341
It handcuffs happy, happy life

35
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,837
That is good, happy wife
happy life, likes me

36
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,139
- It should be true
- Thank you

37
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,845
You look at it, it is grandiose hey

38
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,283
If, it is very good

39
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,084
You vé that leaves to conserve,
he/she looks at the mom

40
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,459
Girl go

41
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,898
Hey goes

42
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,194
You were five years old for
to pull the trigger with Jodi, ok?

43
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,962
There are enough reasons to make it

44
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,574
If, but even memory
as era

45
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,710
"He doesn't like my fantasy of the soccer"

46
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,612
"He/she never attempts anything new"

47
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,308
That is not my voice

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,818
That is exactly your

49
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,615
I don't hear myself as a ratoncillo

50
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,517
- a little
- " I don't speak this way"

51
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,422
Ok, do you remember this?

52
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,228
"She hates the Cadi Shaka"

53
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,029
" if, and you know for that hates
the cadi shaka?"

54
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,362
" it is heard very false"

55
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,762
We go, that would bother you

56
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,532
Totally, the opportunity leaves to the garbage
of being happy, because the girlfriend is false

57
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,640
We go, you should already marry

58
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,869
You are 40 years old, in some moment
you should close the eyes and to jump

59
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,973
I made it and I am the type
but happy

60
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,378
Hello Eddie

61
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,348

00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,348

00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,454
They come, we have go to greet
to the tables

64
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,652
- I follow you - it is for my
- No, that it is

65
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,455
Now it is mine

66
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:59,566
- What table do you have Eddie?
- The 34

67
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,206
That bad luck, us the 11

68
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,309
See you later, you owe me a dance
don't forget it

69
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,138
- I won't make it
- We go

70
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,241
It excuses... your you work here?

71
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,682
Clear, I seem a coordinator
of weddings, hey

72
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,141
No, I didn't mean that

73
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,152
Somebody looks for the coordinator of weddings

74
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,084
That would be me

75
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,588
What can I make for you?

76
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,130
I believe that there was an error, I have
the table 34, but it is that of children

77
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,632
Not it is the table of children

78
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,794
It is the table of single, enjoy it

79
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,109
- Didn't your wife come hey?
- Not I have wife

80
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,912
Divorced?

81
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,454
- No
- Girlfriend?

82
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,924
He/she swims for the time being

83
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,323
I have my open options

84
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,361
- Hey Mister
- That?

85
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,122
Is gay?

86
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,730
- No
- If! You owe me 10 dollars

87
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,330
- Are you of those?
- No, I am not it

88
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,337
Do you see it? Not yet it leaves the closet

89
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,840
Are you widow or something like that?

90
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,772
If, it is this way

91
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,879
- Pardon
- It is gay

92
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,845
- Not I am gay
- Then it plays the 5-5

93
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,351
What is that?

94
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,457
I ask you 5 questions
in 5 seconds

95
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,387
If you tell the truth, you don't have
that to think

96
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,490
If, I don't want to play
the game, I sit down it

97
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,328
- Rápdio...
- Murder

98
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,595
- As?
- It chops ice

99
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,696
- Do they have to the type?
- If

100
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,127
- How does he/she call himself?
- Arnold

101
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,699
- Brad Pit, Lara Craft who is but sexy?
- Brad Pitt

102
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,331
No, I thought that they said
who is but sexy really

103
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,235
- They caught you
- Gey

104
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,233
Your you are gay

105
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,207
Alone he/she wanted them to know

106
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,516
Jodi is the only woman
that I have loved

107
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,856
And I want to thank them to help me to
to make reality this fantasy

108
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,021
And that doesn't mean that I had
that to kiss frogs...

109
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,720
...before knowing my prince

110
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,224
But seriously...

111
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,038
Michael has been the answer
to all my sentences

112
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,640
Besides that is the only one
that my father has approved

113
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,944
And it is because it is the first type
that it is not an idiotic total

114
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,287
Well, thank you to come
will we have a good time certain?

115
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,974
- Somebody stops it!
- High Hey!

116
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,882
- Not he/she has anything to do with you!
- Calm, give me the handbag

117
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,076
I swear him for heaven's sake I will hit you!

118
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:13,691
- Give me the handbag!
- It is mine! It is mine!

119
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,686
It is mine! It is mine!

120
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,103
Are you well?

121
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,740
- That me hechó?
- It is alone my perfume

122
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,435
Shit! Not I can believe it taenia

00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,707
...everything is there! My license

124
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,318
...life!
- If, that type is crazy

125
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,819
I say I was about stopping it but...

126
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,923
- Pardon, almost the taenia
- No, non estu accuses

127
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,920
I should hit it or something, I sit down it

128
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,733
Thank you, it is brilliant that you
you have involved yourself

129
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,973
- I help you with that
- Thank you

130
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,119
Not I want... he/she didn't want
to see that color is

131
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,317
This well, I have it

132
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,191
Not there is problem

133
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,988
- That is
- Do you live here?

134
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,899
If, to a couple of blocks

135
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,691
By Big City Sports

136
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,730
The store Big Sports

137
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,101
- That of there
- Oh if, I already know which

00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,914

Not I have money, you lelvó

00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,648
- He/she takes... please
- Not I meant that, you already made a lot

141
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:56,323
This well, I have hundred of dollars
in the bank

142
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,327
- Not I can accept it then
- I joke, I am well

143
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,729
I say, I am rich, I live comfortable
ahead reach it

144
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,366
- Carefully
- Thank you

145
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,872
- How do you call yourself?!
- Lilac!

146
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,570
Lilac! I Am Eddie, Eddie Cantrow

147
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,155
Oh if, this he/she is your girl, I have told you
and you can say much of a woman for their short

148
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,093
From cuiando you do say that?

149
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,169
I say it as a mantra
but it doesn't put attention

150
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,464
- And did you have something with her?
- No, I didn't have anything with her

151
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,805
I hardly met her

152
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,275
A moment, is sexy, friendly
it is day of san Valentine...

153
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:52,383
- ... it is alone
- Does he/she have David Bowie in their underwear?

154
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,674
And you didn't think of requesting him/her...

155
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,083
Everything happened very quick
taenia spray in the eyes...

156
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,779
...of a very fragrant perfume

157
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:03,257
- It was disoriented
- You were never happened, to follow it down the street

158
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,555
And to call it for their name!

159
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,228
No! This girl was incredibly beautiful

160
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,062
In no way it would be single

161
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,367
He/she should have a noviomillonario. com

162
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,339
A millionaire would make it wash his clothes
in a laundry in day of san valentin, let us go!

163
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,968
Eddie! It is available

164
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,245
He/she is my wife

165
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,552
If, affection

166
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,255
Ok, to the moment

167
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,151
Good-bye boys, husband's duties

168
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,856
Not you can fly much of their house

169
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,998
- As that to fly?
- Tammy had its period...

170
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,564
...so I have to go
to buy some feminine towels

171
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,668
He/she has something to see the one that
have not put attention?

172
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,395
No for that?

173
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,765
I want to make it happy, for that reason
I am this way

174
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,409
- Lament that of your girl, Eddie
- You can stay them

175
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,374
We go for a coffee...

176
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,277
...with a damned pay

177
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,853
Oh if, a pay will be the best thing

178
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,818
Alone I say that when you are with
somebody this way, you don't allow it to go

179
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,516
I go on a trip, take care

180
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,426
Eddie that I will make alone?

181
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,630
- Not you should always go for the first ball
- But he/she went exactly in half

182
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,139
It was a little high
and inside

183
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,334
Hey, magpie penis can

184
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,978
I am amid something
he/she listens...

185
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,343
...all want to bat home runs
but the fact is that a hit is similar of good

186
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,539
- Is it it?

187
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,846
It is the advice but silly that have listened

188
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,354

- Veto
- Relax you, I won't ruin your hidden

195
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,800
It is as good as to put
the face in their underwear

196
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,211
- Of where you took out them?
- Do you want to calm down?

197
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,347
I have just brought them of the club

198
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,547

he/she has recyclable material

219
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,525

Ees fan of the pay, do you like pay?

Oh pay, as of apple,

222
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,735
Not it can be, so you are
an investigator of the environment

223
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,941
For that you are surprised it so much?

224
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,171
No, it is olo that you don't see yourself as...

225
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,976
...the prototype of scientific

226
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,585
Not it is so scientific, it is but... you already know

227
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,755
- It is single investigation
- If

228
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,462
You make it see but simple
of what is but...

229
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:02,396
...you already see, the baseball gloves...

230
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,700

00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,402
...can I be honest with you?

232
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,037
If, clear

233
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,443
He/she didn't really want to buy
that pants

234
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,348
Fuí to the store to see you

235
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,415

Not these enojdado?

242
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,524

Not I want you to make anything
that it inconveniences you

244
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,870
No, silly, it is for that reason
of the virgin thing...

245
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,067
Lilac, you don't need to explain anything

246
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,445
Alone I want you to understand
of where I come

247
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:02,017
It is alone that I have seen as it has grown
of quick our relationship

248
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,385
Not I want to take a risk what we have

249
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,088
Because what we have is
really good

250
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,086
Prece that we were in a career

251
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,640

00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,429
What does it happen?

256
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,824
As much as time wants to live there?

257
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,260
Not you, depends on the restrictions

258
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,870
- At least two years
- Two years!

259
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,067
Two years?

260
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,674
Why to finish?

261
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,183
That we were not in, I don't want to make it
I cannot make it, I want to be...

262
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,321
...investigating but I don't want...

263
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,323
- It is my career I cannot say that
- I understand, but you cannot say...

264
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,625
...somebody is not but that goes?

265
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,524
No, I am I or the other one
person, but this married one

266
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,393
- And that that?
- Not they make married people to move

267
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,602
It is political

268
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,605
- That he/she has of negative?
- I hardly know it of six weeks

269
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,646
He/she is enough Eddie, I proposed it to him
to your mother after three days

270
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,248
Me dió 18 of the best
years of my life

271
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,913
You were committed with Jodi for
5 years and that you obtained?

272
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,817
If, but there are other things

273
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,615
As that?

274
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,756
Not he/she has a great sense of humor

275
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,825
These crazy one? The amusement is
of men, idiot

276
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,830
Not you have seen that when he/she is a girl
very amusing, it is clever

277
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,228
think it

278
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,667
Lilly Tomás, Rossie O'Donald

279
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,374

00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,873

281
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,510
A great bottom

282
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,510
- Check it
- They know that, forget it

283
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,511
Ok, is wonderful
he/she is an incredible girl

284
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:16,680
Not there is well, it is for the idea
of the marriage, it is so permanent

285
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,890
They know, it is as...

286
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,217
...it is as if at the end of the day
he/she chose among Lilac...

287
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,893
...and all the other women
of the world

288
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,689
Not you have gone out with none of
the other women of the world

289
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,123
Not make urgado but of 3 vaginas
and later you finished with Jodi

290
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,336
Dad why the obsession of
to count the vaginas urgadas?

291
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,802
Not I am comfortable with that term

292
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,702
Pardon, is said this way

293
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,309
Who you believe that you are?

294
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,505
Who demons believe that you are?

295
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,944
Thinking of reasons for
not to marry this girl?

296
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,354
You should thank to God that a woman
that it is fantastic you this considering

297
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,654
Unless you want to be the one
75 year-old dad...

298
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,727
...I suggest that you are in charge of of your
life because of that Eddie is

299
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,259
It is life!

300

Finally I gave the jump!
And do you know that?

304
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,469

305
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,105
I told you that it would be it

306
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,467
Thank you to speak this way to me

307
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,736

00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,476
...and next days we will happen
in End

310
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,680
I am in the club!

311
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,019
When you arrive at the hotel
he/she asks for the Uncle Tito

312
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,248
And give him/her this as gratefulness

313
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,926

Grandiose, where this?

318
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,433
That is my tiger

00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,145
Give me a hug

320
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,883
Lament to have me lost
the ceremony

321
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,244
You look at it, how beautiful

322
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,950
It is the same one that uses
the day of my wedding

323
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,552
The same designer?

324
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,354
No, it is the same dress

325
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,440
- You have good voice
- Thank you

326
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,940
He/she gives me pleasure that pleases you because
you listened the next ones a lot 40 or 50 years

327
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,681
Uuh, 40 or 50 years

328
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,279
You know that he/she was thinking
to make when we arrived?

329
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,953
To make something of fishing

330
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,550
He/she planned to catch a Marlin and
to put it in the store

331
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,451
Not I can make it

332
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,096
- For that not?
- Because I get dizzy in the boats

333
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,159
- I sit down it
- This well

334
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,665
This well, is many things
amusing that to make there

335
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,962
As soon as a couple of days are
outside of the hotel, and to go for a "donkey"...

336
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,566
...a Mexican "donkey"
donkey in English

337
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,801
To go to the mountains, to go to
some adventure

338
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,340
Really?

339
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:06,011
I thought in simply
to relax us in the beach

340
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,417
He/she remembers that it is a country tercermundista

341
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,815
It can be really dangerous

342
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,021
If, good...

343
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,720
- ... it is End
- If, it is very good

344
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,521
Affection that such if we turn off
the radio a while

345
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,724
To listen the blow of the wind

346
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,563
I have a better idea

347
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,333
- For that don't look for a place where to catch?
- Ok

348
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,467
Do you like that Eddie?
If, you like it, not?

349
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,778
- If, I like
- Tell me as much as you love me

350
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,340
- Tell me that you like
- I like it a lot

351
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,445
- Do you like that?
- Oh if

352
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,586
- Oh if, I like
- That such... that?

353
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,458
I don't like that

354
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,560
You are a bad boy

355
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:05,830
We can change the position a while
I am choked a little

356
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,005
Do you like the helicopter?

357
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,707
As?

358
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,003
Your you rotate me

359
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,646
Not I believe that I like
the helicopter

360
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,713
Alone you shake me

361
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,822
I have an idea, he/she guesses that

362
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,827
For that not the hacmeos simply
in the missionary's position?

363
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:35,360
A little

364
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,158
That that is?

365
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,828
The missionary's position,
you already know it is as...

366
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,941
...I arrive of you, as
regularly, up of the girl

367
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,576
Can you put on in that position?

368
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,650
That beautiful fué

369
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,415
Not I believe that he/she can think
in any figure for the time being

370
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:38,560
It will be I practice in the next ones
40 or 50 years

371
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,624
Affection, to where you go?

372
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,237
Pee

373
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,948
Non fué what you believe that fué

374
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,017
What? Not I listened anything

375
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,690
That well, because I end up
of hecharme a pedote

376
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,105
Sr. Cantrow is very quiet
this morning

377
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,601
I am always this way in the morning

378
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,744
After the wild thing

379
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,612
Could you take by the hand?
I would really like it

380
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,620
To take by the hand? Clear

381
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,836
Love, miraz

382
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,142
Not it would be brilliant that
we were us in 10 years

383
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,073
10? Not I know, they seem as...

384
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,909
...I hope they are
but of 10 years

385
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,489
Can I wonder something?

386
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,689
Last night

387
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:24,199
Not you will believe that it was very...
or if?

388
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,495
Not I am completely in shape but...

389
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,104
...I don't like that, me ago
to feel like a small girl

390
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:33,400
If you want we can attempt it
in some way well

391
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:40,945
I don't believe it, I say, I sit down that
this way this well

392
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,156
Are you well?

393
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,126
There was something of juice
in the nose

394
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,667
He/she is this idiot it sews
that I have...

395
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,965
- ... everything you...
- Do you have that?

396
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,472
There was a boy in the camp
that taenia one

397
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,872
he/she ate as pig

398
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:12,608
Me not, but everything you me
it leaves the nose

399
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,376
You had said that taenias
that to avoid the liquids

400
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,282
Love, looks at them, they are so pretty

401
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,794
They are adorable

402
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,946
It is even better than Breasur

403
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,641
He/she looks at this

404
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,055
I need to say something

405
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:40,702
It had never been married and
I have always wanted that everything is perfect

406
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,100
I believe that I have been
acting a little... bad

407
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,973
- No
- If, truly I have been...

408
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,980
...being about being comfortable
with everything

409
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,709
I think that you can go away

410
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,380
Perhaps a little

411
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,421
But do you know that? I am also nervous

412
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,616
I say, here we are, married

413
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,953
It had never been married
it is new for both

414
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,425
- He/she gives me pleasure to say something
- Well

415
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:14,269
- For that don't begin again
- I like it, it is necessary to begin

416
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,875
Look at that! The Mariachi!

417
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,673
I love it, it is true Mexico

418
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:34,147
Here they have, we are of honeymoon

419
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,161
Oh my God, is the happy hour

420
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,756
I will go to botanear

421
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,463
Will play for her

422
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,372
Hey looks it is the joto of the wedding

423
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,374
- What do they make here?
- Not I know, of vacations with our parents

424
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,517
You see yourself descepcionado to see us
were you crossing the fingers?

425
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,018
For their information
the sexy blond of there

426
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,555
- This with me, will sleep with me tonight
- I will guess

427
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,626
How he/she makes it, he/she puts on
the eggs below...?

428
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,320
...or does it put them very up?

429
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,567
For that don't hold on to their project
of genes and they leave

430
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,127
And they learn some I inhabit

431
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,936
He/she can tell me where to find
to the Uncle Tito?

432
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,042
If, I can ask for that?

433
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,644
If, my name is Eddie Cantrow and
I am a friend's of him friend...

434
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,941
...I have to give him/her something

435
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,051
Lament to tell him/her that
he no longer works here

436
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,244
In fact for 10 years

437
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,556
It organized women's fights
and we don't speak of that

438
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,160
Seriously?

439
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,160
Undoubtedly not! I joke!

440
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,895
I am the Uncle Tito
it is a pleasure to know you

441
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,105
- Are You the Uncle Tito?
- You should see your face

442
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,201
- Did you bring the gift of Mac?
- If, I bring it

443
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,305
Here this

444
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,813
It is amusing, it imagined it but old
of long hair...

445
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,208
- Not I do know for that? -Do you like my hair hey?
- Yes, I like it

446
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:19,458
I wondered if we would rot...

447
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,731
Here he/she has the video
of adults Mister

448
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,337
I will load it to their room

449
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,236
Does he/she want him to take him/her but?

450
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,978
No, thank you

451
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,439
He/she will have an amusing night

452
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,287
You have to prove this

453
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,285
You are but sexy that eat
they described you

454
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,857
Thank you

455
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,757
Not he/she spoke of you, he/she spoke of him

456
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,955
I joke!

457
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:58,258
You are incredibly sexy!
By the way...

458
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,700
...please put your jewels in the box
of security, many lunamieleros...

459
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,533
...they lose their rings in the beach

460
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,935
- It is very sad
- Thank you for the tip

461
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,044
I also want you to know
that I am with you in everything

462
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,941
I have them the suite lunamielera

463
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,112
Thank you

464
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,114
This is surprising

465
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,886
How beautiful it is this!

466
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,049
It checks this view

467
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,223
He/she thinks quick

468
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,463
Affection, you could take out me
an eye with that

469
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,735
Nisiquiera happened close

470
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,032
he/she looks at this place

471
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,397
Will all cost?

472
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:40,075
He/she stops to worry about the money
it is our luina of honey

473
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,175
I am with the man with the one who
voiviré 50 years

474
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,445
You are right

475
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,742
I am thinking as single
I have to remember that I already have family

476
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,883
- Do you have a second work?
- No, I say my wage, your wage...

477
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,420
My wage?

478
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,786
That? You think now in
separate goods?

479
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,195
Affection, I am voluntary

480
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,367
Ah if? Does all win the volunteers?

481
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,295
A volunteer is a volunteer

482
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,130
Not they pay to take care of the atmosphere
I told it to you

483
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:18,243
Then... forzan to the volunteers
to move for them?

484
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,142
Not to the married volunteers?

485
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,908
Not the forzan

486
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:25,020
But if you want to continue with
the company has to play its game

487
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,518
You told me that you were one
environment investigator

488
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,217
If, I am it

489
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:38,633
At least you don't have to wait in the cold
with those fishes

490
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:42,634
Not he/she loved you when
they have to urinate in my

491
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,541
These with the fish but
you are not investigating of atmosphere?

492
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,907
You know Eddie, I love my work
and I don't have to defend it for you

493
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,342
Work? Not I believe that
should call I work him

494
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,483
Ah if? As it is supposed that
should I call it?

495
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,346
Hobby?

496
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,281
- Hobby?
- Hobby, to work you pays

497
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,319
- According to the one who?
- According to the dictionary...

498
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,682
Who reads a dictionary?
Not all

499
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:03,985
Seemingly not

500
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:07,391
- A work is a word, it is not in Japanese
- You married for my money

501
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,428
What? A moment, not him
give the turn

502
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,132
What? You stole yourself my handbag like
did he/she make it my I finish boyfriend?

503
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,795
Your former-boyfriend stole you
your handbag?

504
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,530
God, you were there

505
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,299
Was that your boyfriend?

506
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,609
That maniac?

507
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,839
- That was my former-boyfriend
- Was that lunatic of the bike your former-boyfriend?

508
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:27,914
- If
- And didn't you tell me for that?

509
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,416
For that would make it? We were
some strangers

510
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,215
And for that stole you your handbag?

511
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,716
Because it owed me money
so I took their wallet

512
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,724
And he/she would not live in my department
because the one entered...

513
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,456
...so I grabbed my handbag
together with their keys and their cellular one

514
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,463
And allow me to tell you something but
about my hobby

515
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,364
Our day children inherited
this Earth...

516
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,472
...alone I make sure that there is
some aquatic one when they make it

517
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,343
- That is not a word
- What a word is not?

518
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:54,736
In habitat, it is not word

519
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:58,142
Ah if? For that don't look
the dictionary

520
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,113
And you look for what is catch-shit

521
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,822
Will I look for cogemierda and does he/she guess that?
I won't find you inhabit or cogemierda

522
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,008
It excuses... do you need help?

523
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,775
Pardon, was fallen my camera

524
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,682
Not it seems to be had broken

525
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,286
Don't throw it, already under

526
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,925
thank you

527
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,792
Not I wanted to bother you...

528
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:28,895
Not there is problem, you were in the morning
in the reception?

529
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,505
If

530
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,810
- Not it was what you believed
- Alone you produced a video

531
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,913
But it was not this way

532
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,811
Not you have to explain anything

533
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:45,350
I have a cousin that he likes
the pron hard

534
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,319
Well, but I am not that
type of types

535
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,724
We are getting ready

536
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,259
Please it ascends

537
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,055
I already go

538
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,034
- That is my cousin
- Is your cousin?

539
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,066
We come for a family meeting

540
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,867
If, my aunt and my uncle
they wanted us to come

541
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,704
It is a luck that you/they continue being loved
God blesses them

542
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,170
- That well
- If that there are of you?

543
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,382
That you make here?

544
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,982
Plneas some vacations?

545
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,314
Do I seem sick?

546
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,586
We are clever to play Parchisi

547
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,488
I already go

548
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,395
This well, you already have your camera

549
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,508
- I sit down it a lot
- Affection, I regret it

550
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,208
No, I sit down it, but before anything

551
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,007
I love you to love
the fish

552
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,212
And I believe that it is grandiose
that you want to clean the ocean

553
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,220
- It will work
- You were right Eddie

554
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,658
If, they should have me paid
a long time ago

555
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,366
As it is

556
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:09,435
How I can leave debts
if I continue leaving that he/she makes me this

557
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,934
As that?

558
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,373
To leave debts

559
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,538
Do you have debts? What class
of debts?

560
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,946
You already know, of the type of the one that
you request borrowed money to people

561
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:19,875
As much as money?

562
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,880
Not it is so bad

563
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:27,386
Since I began with this of sipping
it will be about 26 thousand

564
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,092
You have this... problem of cocaine?

565
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,194
It is for that reason that I have
does this apparatus remember?

566
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,696
You said that the taenias
but non dsijiste that taenias...

567
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,902
...you already know, that of smelling cocaine

568
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,071
For that reason I have the receiver

569
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:48,477
There is who have this
problem of sipping

570
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,305
Taenia 8 years, and he/she was my partner
of room

571
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,407
He/she would have given me bill

572
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,277
You speak to me a little more than this

573
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:00,353
It is an I surrender of my life
of the one that I am not very proud

574
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,319
Well

575
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,326
You know that... if he/she had that
to make everything again

576
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:10,864
He/she would not think it twice, because
that made me what I am today

577
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,036
And do you know who am now?

578
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,462
No, who are?

579
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,831

580
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,641
- Eduard
- Eduard, you didn't tell it to me

581
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:31,345
Good, Sr. Cantrow, is some other one
dirty and dark secret that he/she should know?

582
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,163
You can bet

583
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,064

584
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,095

We are well, I don't want
to really hit you

589
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,320
- Do you have vagina?
- No

590
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,426
- Do you have vagina?
- No! Not I have vagina

591
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,820
Then you are a joto?

592
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,464
- I am not it!
- Because you stop me, make this way it!

593
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,427
That it happens? A girl you
did it grab the nipples?

594
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,539
Like this way me, if!

595
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,769
If! Catch!

596
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,476
Catch!

597
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,742
- Catch!
- I believe that I am making it

598
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,755
Catch as the black type! Let us go!

599
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,494
Continue making it!

600
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:15,758
- This is oil
- If

601
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,026
Affection, here this the sun

602
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,459
You know that you have to use
oil when you are wild

603
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:27,163
It is very strong, you need a
30 or 35, I have something here

604
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,029
Do you want to control me phenomenon?

605
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,475
first question me my words
and now this

606
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,468
Forget it idiotic, I will make it myself

607
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,346
I only say that the Sun
it is different here

608
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,451
The sun is the sun

609
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,618
Calm grumpy person

610
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:28,965
Really this there

611
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,430
Perhaps he/she told the truth

612
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,580
Make them to leave

613
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,782
Thank you but not

614
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,854

Thank you but we are well

616
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,595
High

617
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,139
Mexican idiots always
they are this way

618
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,936
Not they are stupid, alone
you have to see as being with them

619
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,307
It was about tanning

620
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,243
No, you were about being wild

621
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,509
Of what side these Eddie?

622
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:27,222
- That? Which sides are?
- Mine or the other ones, he/she chooses

623
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:32,924
I am of your side, alone you tranquilize yourself
I will put on this in the back

624
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,161
He/she will make you feel better

625
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,059
Ah lousy pendejo!

626
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,467

00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,432

00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,644
I want you to greet somebody

631
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,577
Hello Eddie, I am Caddie

I knew that you married
Happiness

633
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,487
Your dad says that it is surprising

634
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,523
Really not, I can speak
with my dad?

635
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,387
What does it happen? These well?

636
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,328
No! Not I am well, I have big
problems, I believe that perhaps...

637
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,091
...I shitted it

638
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,305
Allow me to be direct, you believe that your wife
it is crazy because...

639
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,105
...they are of honeymoon
in the paradise of the tropic...

640
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,007
...he/she sings too much and they had
sex in the parking lot

641
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,807
And accidentally you hechó a fart

642
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,713
Yes but it is much worse
of like one hears

643
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,212
Now listen to me well

644
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:38,622
These with your wife in your honeymoon
request him/her that you ma-to... seeing...

If, thank you Tito

647
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,545
Where your adorable wife is?

648
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,337
Too much time was
in the sun

649
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,273
Something is irritated

650
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,975
For sure fué the sun that that
did it irritate it and not your hey?

651
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,222
Another beat but that it is but loaded

652
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,722
Hello what you make in the bar?

653
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,328

654
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,006

- That that is?
- Neither he/she devises, but it is tequila and something but

658
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,818
I have discovered as they make it

659
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,717
People that live in this
restaurant in vacations

660
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,028
Oh if, as the vacationers

661
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,023
Not I know, you believe that they should have
a reason?

662
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,131
- In seiro?
- Of course

663
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,337
Not you, seems that they hide of something

664
00:47:54,638 --> 00:48:01,601
They hide of their boring lives
they need some weeks of party

665
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,075
- Of where you are?
- Missisipi

666
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,111
- Seriously? Not you have the one it accent-excuses

667
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,718
Are they here of honeymoon?

668
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,717
In fact, me if

00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,586
Are they having a good time?

670
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,527
We are passing it to us incredible

671
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,994
The moment of our lives

672
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,395

Oh if, sure, there is not problem

He/she is my friend Eddie

680
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,904
As it was that you found it
here, Miranda?

681
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:08,408
Eddie, my family, my Aunt Nieggel,
Barrew and Beaul

00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,579
Is their anniversary certain?

683
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:14,180
Happiness, I believe that it is a beautiful name

684
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:15,817
Does something mean?

685
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,278

00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,614
- It is the short of Beauford
- Beaufoerd!

687
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,685
Ok for that you/they don't call you Beau

688
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,196
That it sews so amusing!

689

30 years and we didn't know as calling him/her
but that Bu

690
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,402
My cousins, Buz and Martha

691
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,607
Adorable Steward

692
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,717
I remind you, you are of...

693
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,217
And the adorable man of the bar
he/she is my grandfather

694
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,549
Hello

695
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,625
I like in knowing them, but
I have to leave, good night

696
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,027
This beat is for part
of their new friends

697
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,834
Not we want but, thank you

698
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,670
I believe that I will happen

699
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:19,947
Not I believe that you can safarte
that easy, affection

700
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,051
Thank you

701
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,684
Hey for Bearl and Beau

702
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,878
Do we have to pay for that reason?

703
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,613
You are a baseball trainer

704
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,406
It is brilliant

705
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,708
In fact, Beau taenia the one
I equip before the one

706
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:58,079
He/she never got lost a game
in 28 years

707
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,721
There were some games that God willing
I had gotten lost

708
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,456
Miranda also taenia their team

709
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,730
- It is this way
- Are you entrenadora?

710
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,126
That is... wau,
the whole family has trainers

711
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:15,530
There is an I articulate on them
in the newspaper

712
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,534
You can chatear with them
in it lines

713
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,742
Is it surprising that there are of you?

714
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:24,345
Not I am a trainer
I have a couple of stores

715
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,742
Not forget the third
that taenias in the 27

716
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,848
You can return

717
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:36,556
- We will open another in that area
- The best thing

718
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,861
Don't allow it to enter
to the I circulate

719
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:43,655
We want to maintain a good organization

720
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,460
- So we will hurry
- And we will be there this time

721
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:48,762
- That well?
- And your Eddie?

722
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,164
Do you sell things of sports?

723
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,774
I make it, in fact I have
a store of sports in San Francisco

724
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,476
In fact I lost my opportunity
in the diamond of the baseball

725
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,515
If, a couple of boys me
they put below and...

726
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,250
Not beautiful fué

727
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:12,825
Did you lift positions?

728
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,728
- No, it was...
- He/she was joking

729
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,829
About anal violation

730
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,279
For that assume that the aliens
of the space ships people are?

731
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,183
For that could not be
perhaps cows?

732
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,250
Of that planet

733
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:43,287
- Certain
- Do you understand what I say?

734
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:48,856
Even if the cows were capable
of flying ships

735
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:54,369
People of the planet would continue
looking for the cows

736
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,801
You say, he/she looks at the cows in
stupid UFOS

737
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,709
Or IFO, because they know what is

738
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,435
If, exactly

739
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:09,413
Ok, I can say that your family...

740
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,152
...I love them, they are wonderful

741
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,114
Thank you

742
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:15,848
With an exception

743
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:17,957
It is a little tender the...

744
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,022
- ... Mervin
- Martin!

745
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,626
If, I sit down that Martin this

746
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,558
Alone a little antiquated?

747
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,765
Friend! That is my cousin!

748
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,331
Alone he/she said that he/she is an idiot

749
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:39,345
For that don't forget this
because it is something...

750
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,674
he/she is their best friend

751
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,185
As one week a month

752
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:48,856
I suppose that it is something that
he/she has to happen

753
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:57,196
- And your you wanted him to happen?
- He is of those that they like the routine

754
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,567
He didn't want to formalize

755
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:04,602
Do you mean that he/she didn't want to marry?

756
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,002
- Can you believe it?
- No

757
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,741
Which the problem is?

758
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:10,612
That it passes him/her?

759
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:14,146
So I told him/her that
taenia that to take a respiration

760
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:19,010
And in little time I realized
of the different thing that we were

761
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:25,222
That there are of you? Do you have a girlfriend at home?

762
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:31,928
Where demons have you been?

763
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,837
I have looked for you for 45 moinutos

764
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,733
All are very drunk

765
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,430
- And?
- And?

766
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,075
Nobody takes care anybody

767
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:44,170
- I thought that you were in the highway
- Oh shit

768
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,881
Do you find amusing? For that don't go
to clean everything

769
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,842
Martin, relax you

770
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,782
We will fish tomorrow,
do you want to come?

771
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:54,479
A moment, we cannot invite
to anyone to come

772
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:57,249
I will speak with the captain

773
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,462
Forget it, anyway
I cannot go

774
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:01,486
Good night

775
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,539
Where you have been?

776
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,647
It was below

777
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:33,521
Below? You left 7 hours ago
and you said that alone you will have dinner

778
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,122
It was this way, it was in the bar
with Jimmy Chongos...

779
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,824
...it was inside

780
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,661
Jimmy Chongos doesn't take a long time so much

781
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,838
No, quick fué,
then the lupus came out

782
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,237
I knew a wonderful couple
to who I said that we were of honeymoon

783
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:51,777
And they invited me a swig,
and then another group, and then they were many swigs

784
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:55,439
- Which another group?
- Another group, this...

785
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:59,751
There in the bar, but very pleasant
of Jimmy's Crankcase type

786
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:03,785
Eddie, that doesn't explain because you arrive
at 4 o'clock if the bar closes at two o'clock

787
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:09,192
Affection said that you wanted to sleep, so
he/she didn't want to bother and I went to the beach to see the waves

788
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,896
You were in the beach everything
this time

789
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,499
- Deveras?
- If, affection

790
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,548
I sit down it, I didn't want
to distrust of you, alone...

791
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:31,310
...that I am very miserable
and it leaves me everything of the nose...

792
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,818
- .. I cannot sleep
- That? What does it leave your nose?

793
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,750
It was for the pain

794
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,367
Were you about taking out it?

795
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,934
Anything works

796
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,638
Will I take charge of this, this well?

797
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:57,040
Me your small visitor's deharé

798
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,875
Stay this way, lean back

799
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,476
This is as the game "Operating"

800
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,089
- You played the nose
If

801
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:10,984
You have to be still

802
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,201
It is enormous

803
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:24,601
My face hurted me so much
I have to clean

804
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,005
Better

805
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,303
How do I see myself?

806
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,439
That it happens? This bad?

807
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,620
Not it is so...

808
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,918
- Oh my God!
- Affection

809
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,523
- It is horrible!
- Affection

810
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:51,230
We have the credit card
we can fix it

811
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,164
Go away, everything is your blame

812
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:55,563
As that my blame is?

813
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:01,675
I made it alone to prove you
that you were mistaken

814
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,778
Now these happy one?

815
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,480
Lilac, is a madness

816
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,107
Lilac goes

817
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,300
It is ridiculous, as much as time
you stayed there

818
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,803
It doesn't concern you, leave alone me

819
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,312
Edduard

820
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,212
Baby, we go, I have to urinate

821
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,919
- And?
- Allow me to enter

822
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,216
See to urinate to another part

823
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,924
Why you won't explore Mexico
or something like that?

824
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,617
Not I want to explore Mexico without you, we go

825
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,362
I want to be alone

826
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:57,725
We have to eat

827
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,729
Do you want to have breakfast?

828
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,062
It passes the menu for below
of the door

829
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,802
I thought that they would go to the
fishing expedition

830
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,377
With 150 dollars it would rot
to make something, Sr parties

831
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,710
I suppose that it is as well as
the hcen in California hey

832
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,979
Without consideration for those
people's plans

833
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,522
This well, stops to be so weeping

834
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,291
In the morning we walked
for the beach

835
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:38,634
And we think that there were not us
had a good time so much without you

836
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:44,006
For their birthday, we will put one
badge in their car that Byoo says

837
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,740
Anything of names,
single Beau

838
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:53,455
He will love that... can I tell him/her?

839
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,150
Eddie, why you take
do eat for two?

840
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:05,232
No, alone he/she wanted to eat something but
this morning

841
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,131
and eggs also

842
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:14,333
Hey here is something to make, there is a
bus that he/she goes to Miraflores

843
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,340
It is or more good of Mexico

844
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,055
The Uncle Tito will take charge of everything

845
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:40,897
Tito looks, I need that
do me a great favor

846
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,262
300 pesos

847
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,564
- Nisiquiera even knows what
- It should be something unpleasant, or you would make it your same one

848
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,483
Affection, are you your?

849
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,060
Well, I will open the door

850
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:08,020
And you put it there

851
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:50,058
Hey Mac! I owe it to you friend
this place is...

852
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,458
...it is the best place where
I have been!

853
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:54,761
I told you that you would love

854
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,342
Oh my God, I know it I will take to Grace

855
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,602
In seiro, nobody knows what is here

856
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:05,404
It is incredible

857
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:07,608
How Lilac is it?

858
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,018
Who?

859
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,616
Your wife, Lilac

860
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:17,322
Not very well, he/she burned a little

861
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:21,863
I am with another girl

862
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,428
a moment, seriously?

863
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:28,135
That a lawyer looks for?
of what do you speak?

864
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,352
I tell it to you since we marry
it changed, it is a nightmare

865
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,953
The dogs are crazy
the wise ones

866
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,847
They always change

867
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,787
Of what do you speak? You said that
you were happy with her

868
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,756
You want to know the secret of our
happy marriage? Make that that me

869
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:57,064
It drives the following mile
he/she waits the following century half...

870
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,598
...sit down, relax you, he/she looks
the breeze and he/she dies

871
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,801
As my hips they are come?
and my back?

872
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,006
Is it brilliant, where is it?

873
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,711
If! I already go!

874
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,712
It is small, it doesn't bother him/her
that you grieve have you married?

875
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:19,845
No, there is not him to him acalarado exactly
but I will make it, I wait the moment

876
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,421
You have to see the ocean

877
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,966
Not it is surprising?
I have to leave

878
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,363
Non Eddie! Let us go!

879
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,331
We Go Eddie

880
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:55,688
That grandiose Eddie

881
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,255
Very amusing

882
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,326
Here you have your Mexican hat

883
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,094
He/she looks, the band returns

884
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:09,533
Ok, apresuremnos, we have
that to reach them in 15 minutes

885
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,536
Well, this well

886
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:20,213
Dad, there this the type that
their wife is...

887
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:22,209
The one of there

888
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,816
If he/she is a lunatic

889
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,314
He/she says that not, but it is gay

890
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,028
Hello Baby, Eddie arrived

891
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,753
And I have you a history

892
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,933
I hope it is good
to have been the whole day

893
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,432
This is what happened
I went down to bring you your breakfast

894
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,764
- To who you believe that I saw?
- Who?

895
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,235
- Ivonne Shnewart
- Who?

896
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,376
That of Patagonia

897
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,134
- And?
- And...

898
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:53,838
We go, Patagonia is one
of those but big suppliers, you know it

899
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,779
Good Ivonne and their friends
they will leave...

900
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,077
- ... does it dilute?
- No

901
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,583
They asked me him to be
I said that not

902
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,384
I have to go

903
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,288
Who those friends were?

904
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:13,330
A couple of friends, Lenny of sure
that type of things

905
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,527
And another of Patagonia

906
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:16,898
How did he/she call himself?

907
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,631
Sixto called herself

908
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,502
- Sixto?
- If, Sixto

909
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:27,112
One of those types

910
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:32,913
By the way, it showed me as
mantner the balance, is what you need

911
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:36,114
In fact he/she said that he/she would make
a better shot, direct to the ball

912
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:41,655
And for that took a long time 7 hours?

913
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:47,027
But I tell you that in fact
they took advantage

914
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:52,536
We really speak of things
grandiose for the store

915
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,572
Why didn't you call me?
It was very concerned for you

916
01:06:55,845 --> 01:07:00,077
I made it, but at that distance
not taenia reception

917
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,216
What do you make? You will go to
some part?

918
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:05,884
Lilac, I have just said I have it to you that
to see Matt in the dinner in 5 minutes

919
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,485
When you said that?

920
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,723
Before anything, these people
allow me to explain to you...

921
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:17,695
...these people, this it is the opportunity
of hiring a great company

922
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,734
It is international, alone they have that
to bite the fishhook, I go up them to the boat

923
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:24,302
And I shake them until death
it is hour of killing affection

924
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,135
I have to take advantage of the moment

925
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:32,804
Not I should take a long time so much, because
a couple of hours ago...

926
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:36,212
...it is something very interesting in
all that anyone has to say

927
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:40,616
- It will be good
- This well, waits to that put on makeup

928
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:42,921
Do you come?

929
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,251
Claor that I will go

930
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:52,556
Yes! I will only call him/her so that
have some skies but

931
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,732
Skies?

932
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,303
Eddie, I cannot go in a boat

933
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,403
Skies, deveras

934
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:11,711
Sure? We will pass a couple of miles
of water, it is supposed that it is maraviloso

935
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,284
And this type of the movie...

936
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,013
...the Perfect Storm

937
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:21,493
Affection, I sit down it, but of
no way will go there

938
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,789
Do you know what? To the devil

939
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,557
What am I making?
I am of honeymoon

940
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,134
Thank you to make me remember it
I will call to cancel

941
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:30,429
What there are of the terms
of the credo?

942
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,408
This well, do you know that? You win

943
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:38,112
We will make it to your way
I will go, I will finish the treatment...

944
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,142
...quick, and I will return to have dinner

945
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,508
does it sound well?

946
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,752
There is something important of that that
I have to speak to you

947
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:47,317
Ah if?

948
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:51,117
- Is it good or bad?
- Some both

949
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,092
But first have to leave

950
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,525
Grandiose

951
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:05,101
Affection, lament to have this way you traado
in the morning, I didn't want him to be so hard

952
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,503
When you sat down in the
door of the bathroom

953
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:14,012
You threw the food and you put
my hand in your salami

954
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,044
You surprised me, I didn't feel
so well

955
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:21,121
I promise you that I will reward you
in the night

956
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,052
Super

957
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,400
- As these?
- I am well

958
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:36,299
You see yourself as if something bothered you
there below

959
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,599
Ah that, is a long history
I don't want to bother you with that

960
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,208
Please make it, I have everything
the time of the world

961
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:43,708
What did it happen?

962
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:46,407
After taking the food
to your room in the morning...

963
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:49,413
...I put my I punished in your wife's hand
and it shook it...

964
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,347
...he/she knew me very well friend

965
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:53,822
Is it seriously?

966
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:58,350
That he/she spends? You have spent of lance

967
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,117
That is not acceptable

968
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:01,521
That is not made

969
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:02,924
We go

970
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,864
To the devil, do you joke truth?
you caught me

971
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,101
Not I am joking, it is seriously

972
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,865
That is not a correct behavior
you don't go and you put your penis...

973
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,543
...in my wife's hand

974
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:22,440
If you put this way it, I sit down it...

975
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:23,948
...I feel very bad

976
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,619
What were you thinking?

977
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:30,757
Esque comes here, and you want
to give me your video pron...

978
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,258
...and I do you with another woman

979
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:36,589
in your honeymoon, I imagined that...

980
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:38,389
...everything was well for
this type

981
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,131
Lament the malentendido, Mister

982
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,318
- You are beautiful
- Thank you

983
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,260
Do you want us to walk?

984
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:10,658
He/she listens... I have that... to tell you something

985
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:15,235
Something that I should say you before
but I didn't make it and...

986
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,836
I know that of your wife

987
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:18,972
Ah if?

988
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:24,571
- How?
- Some people spoke of her in the bus

989
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,840
They spoke of her in the bus

990
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:29,751
Then it is true

991
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:35,349
If, but it is very important that
know that it already finished

992
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:40,495
Lament not to have you said him before
but esque when I met you...

993
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:44,894
...I didn't realize that
I liked you so much

994
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:48,902
And he/she didn't want to go away

995
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:50,697
Not it would have been this way

996
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,298
Really?

997
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:53,802
Then not these angry one?

998
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:58,005
I am sad

999
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,070
It should be horrible

1000
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:05,512
The fué, is it, I say... it is a suck

1001
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,416
You are the person but pleasant
of the planet

1002
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:13,324
Really?

1003
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:17,431
Not he/she waited this reaction

1004
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,566
Does the whole family know it then?

1005
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,937
Not I believe that they take it
as well as your

1006
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,235
Calro that if

1007
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,343
- Alone they want to lean on
- Even Martin?

1008
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:32,770
Beau told to all
that they didn't say anything

1009
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:37,184
That well!

1010
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:45,557
You have to go in donkey to
the summit of the mountain and they live there...

1011
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:48,262
It is always the summit
of the mountain...

1012
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,164
Seriously, we have to go tomorrow

1013
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,463
That would be, ok, alone I have that
to fix some things

1014
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,606
It can be a headache
but I can make him to happen

1015
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,510
I am the only one to the one that continues
moledstandole this type?

1016
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:04,703
I believe that if

1017
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:06,914
Allow me to wonder this...

1018
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:11,519
...that he/she makes here with Miranda?

1019
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,821
All they know it, I don't care it

1020
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:23,225
If he likes it is not breaking
any law ok

1021
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:12,508
- How these?
- Lament to ruin our honeymoon

1022
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:16,143
- I am an idiotic wife
- No, you are not it

1023
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:17,716
You are grandiose

1024
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,445
You are a wonderful person
and beautiful

1025
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,624
However, I believe that
we should speak

1026
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:28,018
He/she waits, I have something for you

1027
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,766
Anyway

1028
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,736
- I have been thinking
- Turn it

1029
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:46,744
The best husband in the world

1030
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,647
Your you made it?

1031
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:55,052
Before you left

1032
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,556
Your you made it?

1033
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,761
Did you make it your alone one?

1034
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,589
The hearts, yours and mine

1035
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:04,695
Together

1036
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,597
forever

1037
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:11,003
Then you do want to speak of what?

1038
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,602
I want to speak with you...

1039
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,810
...about anything at this time

1040
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,342
He/she rests and we will speak in the morning

1041
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:24,813
Give me a kiss

1042
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,519
Eddie Bear loves you

1043
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,654
Love, love, love

1044
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,127
What that is so important
of what you want to speak?

1045
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:49,035
- If, ok...
- God, this is surprising

1046
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:50,575
If, it is good

1047
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:52,370
Your hand

1048
01:15:56,552 --> 01:16:00,511
Not I will retard it but...
I have not been a good husband

1049
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,723
I have been bad

1050
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,385
Me dá so much pleasure that
say that

1051
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,427
I thought that I was
returning madwoman

1052
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,792
From the moment in that us
we marry, everything changed

1053
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,299
And you transformed into this moonstruck one

1054
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:18,530
If! You are right, I became
a moonstruck one...

1055
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:22,301
...you are not your, I am me, this conversation
it is for my, because...

1056
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:28,813
...as wife, you have made all that that
any man...

1057
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:31,315
...it would be happy of having
a wife as you

1058
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:36,923
And everything to make it for my
with all my... madness

1059
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,924
The point is, affection, you don't have
that to give everything for your husband

1060
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,431
You deserve something well

1061
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:49,365
- Do you understand what I say?
- If, you apologize, it is very sweet

1062
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:55,366
That is hot

1063
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:59,637
Affection, in the life, sometimes...

1064
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,577
...you sometimes choose something and...

1065
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:06,311
...and in retrospective, you realize
that the election is not the correct one

1066
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:09,980
Not a malaeleccion
neither a bad, alone...

1067
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:11,692
...it is not the correct one

1068
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:14,994
For people that are
involved

1069
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,389
Of what do you speak to Eddie?

1070
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,997
Lilac, we won't be happy together

1071
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:23,796
In San Francisco

1072
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:30,309
It is where you have to be

1073
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,308
That is your destination

1074
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:36,311
To clean the rocks and
to prepare the atmosphere

1075
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:39,919
It is what you should make, not to be
in San Francisco with me

1076
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,816
- A fool of the sport
- Oh my God

1077
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:48,623
You are saying what I think
that you say?

1078
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:54,832
Lilac, this will be something good

1079
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,309
You have something leaving of...

1080
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,277
This will be the best thing

1081
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:11,679
Do you listen to me?

1082
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,788
- Tngo that to call to mom
- If, this well calls it

1083
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,188
He/she suckles, I am me

1084
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,693
No, I am well, alone...

1085
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:28,029
...something has happened

1086
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:32,706
Something enormous, Eddie will leave
to Rotherdam with me

1087
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,237
No, he/she waits, Lilac not

1088
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,808
- He/she will no longer have that sport store
- No, Lilac

1089
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:41,005
- He/she waits he/she loves you something
- Not it is that, hello...

1090
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,946
If, we were discussing

1091
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:49,249
No, if Lilac wants to make it

1092
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,118
In fact taenia an entire plan with her

1093
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:57,629
But her... I have to leave

1094
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:03,767
That it happens?

1095
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,473
- As they are?
- Very well

1096
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,276
Not we find Miranda in
any part, have you seen it?

1097
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,376
- Affection who Miranda is?
- Miranda...

1098
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:20,314
.. affection, is its cousin

1099
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:28,789
Boys, what do they make?

1100
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,587
Not they can be here

1101
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:31,992
That it happens? that this is?

1102
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:35,692
Look, you that you/they have seen
that of Miranda and me but...

1103
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,905
...we will already have time to speak
but not now

1104
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,605
I am about to tell him/her

1105
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:41,204
Who is she?

1106
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,234
He/she is my wife

1107
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:45,909
Does it handcuff?

1108
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,515
Boys, we go

1109
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,218
- I am me, Eddie
- But your wife murdered fué

1110
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,614
What?

1111
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:55,312
Those twins

1112
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:58,526
They said that your wife murdered fué
for a maniac with a picahielo

1113
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:07,133
They have to know that from the moment
that I saw Miranda he/she will tell him/her that of my wife

1114
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:18,735
Hey what they make?

1115
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:25,751
Non voucher the pain

1116
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:28,454
What is it happening?

1117
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,583
Eddie who you/they were?

1118
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:33,556
Neither he/she devises

1119
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:37,388
How that doesn't have idea?

1120
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,361
They called you Eddie
and didjiste that were cousins

1121
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:43,163
You who you/they were, is
the types of Patagonia

1122
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:47,669
Not I understand why
they behave this way

1123
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:50,009
Are you well?

1124
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,472
Not I am well

1125
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,271
Not we are well, he/she finished

1126
01:20:57,986 --> 01:20:59,317

1127
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,856

1128
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,648
- I tie!

1129
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,361
50 dollars so that they stop, ok?

1130
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:14,328
Be quiet!

1131
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:19,436
I am paying him/her a lot of dineor
to this hotel

1132
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,869

I wonder to where you fué
all that passion

1137
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:51,302
I regret it, but we have finished

1138
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:55,275
That there are of our plans?

1139
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,346

1140
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:04,410

as moonstruck

1141

My God, how is your nose?

1142
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:14,818
- Made Martin me chili
- What?

1143
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:19,159
- This has been a malentendido
- Not it is my intention, we can wait

1144
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:21,659
I will be made late for
the ceremony

1145

He/she will stay here with their wife

1153
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,050
Of what do you speak?

Leave alone me... take away from my

Lilac, I have been about cirtelo...

01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:04,632

1166
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:09,403

For that was not

1178
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:07,596
To torture me?

1179
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,703
It is the grandiose thing of being married

1180
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:18,038
Not I know, I jumped, two days...

1181

01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:41,333
Alone I am here with my brother

1187
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:43,731
People are looking for you

1188
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:46,566
Your father has been calling
and Mac is raking you

1189
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:49,275
What you suopne that he/she tells him/her
to the American girl

1190
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:50,741
Miranda

1191
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:52,640
What you know about Miranda

1192
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:55,773
Their family flew to house

1193
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,953
She not, stayed and
it is looking for you

1194
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:01,512

1195
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,094
That girl has you cacheteando
the benches

1196
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:11,788
You should see your face

1197
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,694
You were so happy
for a moment estasb this way...

1198
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,438
Not I can believe that
I deceived you again

1199
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:23,605
The comic

1200
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:27,142
It is well, don't worry about my

1201
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,612
Seriously, these here for
some reason?

1202
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:34,014
Which the problem is? you love me
that he/she returns with Lilac

1203
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,122
Or to return there, it won't pass that

1204
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:37,723
You look at yourself

1205
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:39,120
Listen to you

1206
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,123
These "crazy one"

1207
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:43,928
Am I crazy? No, your these lunatic

1208
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:47,629
Lilac burned my lunch,
it burned my clothes, it burned my passport

1209
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:49,530
Although he/she wanted to return it would not rot

1210
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:52,831
Not I will have my papers
in one month or something like that

1211
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:57,333
But you know that, I don't need papers
to walk with this type

1212
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:58,944
Because you don't see papers

1213
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:00,580
Alone you see friendship

1214
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:01,975
Or not?

1215
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:08,086
And we will stay here, and we will speak
a lot, a lot, until it is clear, certain?

1216
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:10,280
Until always, do I have raznon?

1217
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,927
He/she listens, foreign magpie...

1218
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:19,499
...you have been I chingando for everything
this time for that shit

1219
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:23,296
Do you want to fix that you made?
he/she stops to speak of that and make it

1220
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:25,597
Get up and make it!

1221
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:31,601
He is right

1222
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:34,508
He/she has to return and
to fix it, ok?

1223
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:38,117
We go, get up, you can make it, we go

1224
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:43,518
He/she looks, I have conecciones, people
that it can take you from return to California

1225
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,920
- Not you do joke?
- No, I promise it, I don't enter with that

1226
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:52,130
Well, but I don't want to go
to California

1227
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:54,534
I want to go to Misissipi

1228
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:07,875
Calm, I am American but
I lost my passport

1229
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:13,732
I believe that this is a bad idea

1230
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:22,448
Dad looks, I thank that
you are helping me

1231
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,881
This is something that I have to make

1232
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:29,254
Not I understand what it passed with you and Lilac
he/she was such a sweet girl

1233
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:32,851
Dad, master to Miranda

1234
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:37,660
- It had never been but sure in my life
- This well, alone you are careful ok?

1235
01:30:38,566 --> 01:30:41,000
He/she remembers, these types have weapons

1236
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:44,170
It is here, hold

1237
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:53,175
I believe that you should wash yourself
to shave or something like that

1238
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:56,508
I have been thinking of this speech
alone I want to enter and to make it

1239
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,232
Byuu

1240
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:22,534
That good to see you again

1241
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,037
I know it, don't ask

1242
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,747
Is Miranda?

1243
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:31,350
- You should be crazy
- No

1244
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:35,250
My God! That he/she makes this idiot here?

1245
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:39,790
- Not I want problems Martin
- No? Now if you are in problems

1246
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:40,955
Shit piece!

1247
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:43,060
That is a very honest answer

1248
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:48,566
Allow me to tell you this,
did I make a great error, ok?

1249
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:49,963
Guilty

1250
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:53,901
I shitted it and I admit it

1251
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:57,372
I married very quick,
I knew my wife two weeks...

1252
01:31:57,578 --> 01:32:00,411
...before marrying and that
it is the other face of the currency

1253
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:03,515
And as much as time met Miranda
before deciding that she is the indidcada

1254
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,544
Two days, and I knew that...

1255
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:10,757
...that it is my point, I won't make
the same error again

1256
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:13,853
They should be sure, I am completely
in my five senses

1257
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:18,030
And as soon as my marriage finishes
I will tell to Miranda that we go slowly

1258
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:22,566
I say, to leave a time to move
together one year at least

1259
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:24,964
To see like he/she feels and
to leave of there

1260
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:26,729
Without promises

1261
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,975
I want to make it well this time

1262
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:32,744
Not there will be a this time" Eddie
the Pop music entered in its head

1263
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:34,938
Miranda marries on Saturday

1264
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,546
What?

1265
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:41,079
- Of what haban?
- Finally it has recovered the sense

1266
01:32:42,356 --> 01:32:44,347
- I don't believe them
- But it is worth that you believe

1267
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:46,560
- I don't believe you
- Eddie

1268
01:32:46,794 --> 01:32:48,056
It is true

1269
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:51,092
He/she will marry

1270
01:32:55,269 --> 01:33:00,798
- At least I can speak with her in person?
- No, aéjate of Miranda! Ok?

1271
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:02,635
I will leave the face

1272
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:07,346
I am calmed

1273
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:14,548
We ask you you to respect
Miranda's privacy

1274
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:17,318
Alone they want to be happy

1275
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:21,920
If you care Miranda
it is it you will make

1276
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:31,836
I will make it

1277
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:55,888
I am me

1278
01:33:57,264 --> 01:33:58,094
Are you crazy?

1279
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,892
It is a madness

1280
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:04,534
What do you make?

1281
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:07,404
They told me that you married

1282
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:11,439
- I only want to speak with you
- Is he my husband you see it?

1283
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,942
I will be quiet, alone you listen to me

1284
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:20,016
Not I will listen to you,
this is a madness

1285
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:22,714
I request it to you

1286
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:24,254
Alone Porfavor listens to me

1287
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:28,322
You have one minute, ahead

1288
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:32,061
First, I regret not to have you
said that was married

1289
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:35,564
I was about telling it to you a couple
of times but...

1290
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:39,538
...there was a malentendido for that of
that my wife had been murdered

1291
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:43,539
- The point is...
- The point is that you love me something or not

1292
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:46,176
You were about catching me in
your honeymoon

1293
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:51,146
- Do make it quick if?
- I make it, I want to apologize

1294
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:54,047
But on the other hand
I am glad him to happen

1295
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:11,103
Not it is my blame that it passed this

1296
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:12,897
I shitted it

1297
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,834
I married very quick

1298
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:22,106
And now I know that I should not make it
I request it to you

1299
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,145
I fell in love with you

1300
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:26,352
And I will never apologize for that reason

1301
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:29,015
Never

1302
01:35:31,425 --> 01:35:32,517
Damned he/she is Eddie

1303
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:41,530
It lowers the bat

1304
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:43,737
Not it is for you, it is for him

1305
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:47,830
Who demons is this type?

1306
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:50,374
This psychopath attempts
to steal your wife

1307
01:35:51,145 --> 01:35:53,136
He/she knew that you would make, dog son

1308
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:56,439
Not I can avoid it, it is made
what is for what is wanted

1309
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,446
Eddie has to leave of here

1310
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,984
- Not until you give me an answer
- No! Not there will be answer

1311
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:05,588
Damned! That hurted!

1312
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:11,030
Do you feel very rude?
I will become trained, we go

1313
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:12,925
Don't enter in problems
alone I am of back

1314
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:15,398
The one that this in problems is your
magpie

1315
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:17,797
Dad, is well, Miranda...

1316
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:21,138
...alone you tell me, you feel the same thing or not

1317
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:24,643
We can fix everything

1318
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:32,217
No, it is not this way, Eddie

1319
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:35,154
We had a coneccion in Mexico

1320
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:36,718
But only fué that

1321
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:43,956
I love Kyle and all that happened
in End he/she made me realize that

1322
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:46,262
I regret it

1323
01:36:47,735 --> 01:36:48,963
It is everything

1324
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:51,263
We go, larguemonos of here

1325
01:36:56,443 --> 01:36:57,740
The dogs are crazy, you know it

1326
01:37:12,793 --> 01:37:14,192
Hey dad

1327
01:37:14,395 --> 01:37:15,726
He/she looks

1328
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:17,994
He/she is looking at me while I leave

1329
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,497
He/she is the better Eddie

1330
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:47,453
We go, man

1331
01:37:47,728 --> 01:37:48,922
Not you can leave me now

1332
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:50,829
It was to improve it

1333
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:53,029
What does that mean?

1334
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:54,831
It means that in that I am
I told it to him...

1335
01:37:55,069 --> 01:37:58,061
...from now on, of Thursday to Domingo
it will be to be outside of house

1336
01:37:58,339 --> 01:38:00,273
It is a lot of time

1337
01:38:00,474 --> 01:38:02,465
Did you really say that?
Simply this way

1338
01:38:02,676 --> 01:38:04,906
- You put the hand as if...
- If

1339
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:07,374
And she understood

1340
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:13,084
Affection, I am conversing
with Eddie at this time

1341
01:38:13,287 --> 01:38:15,812
I call you but it takes, good-bye

1342
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:19,786
- Impressive
- Do you see?

1343
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:22,325
It will be this way from now on
please don't leave

1344
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:24,894
We already happen for this reason, there is not
I motivate to stay here

1345
01:38:25,099 --> 01:38:27,499
Lilac, will have the store when getting divorced
and potato...

1346
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,100
...it is in Las Vegas the whole time

1347
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:31,701
Not I have known anybody
in the last 6 months

1348
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:34,237
It is because you are always seeing
what Miranda will make

1349
01:38:34,441 --> 01:38:36,602
No, I already overcame it, I continue ahead

1350
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:40,104
In fact, it is something good to have
left of that experience

1351
01:38:40,814 --> 01:38:43,942
Ah if? As staying with
their underwear for 6 months

1352
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:46,413
Smelling that, it is asombrosoz

1353
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:50,420
If, for that reason I have to change
I cannot wait to that the life changes

1354
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:51,818
I have to follow my instincts

1355
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:53,822
Now my instincts tell me...

1356
01:38:56,363 --> 01:38:59,059
Mac, enters to the puto car
at this time

1357
01:39:01,168 --> 01:39:02,567
Eddie, take care

1358
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:06,600
How these Eddie
you are sad

1359
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,404
Good-bye Lester

1360
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:22,487
18 months later

1361
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:31,925
For other 150 dollars, I can

1362
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:34,633
A walk for the Island

150 dollars

1364
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,032
It is a robbery

01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:42,538
go to look for it you, are big I don't believe
that they have problems with the sharks

1366
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:46,006
Tito, don't scare people
there are not sharks

1367
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:48,438
There are sharks of sand
but without teeth

1368
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:51,651
Do you see it? Not they have anything to make there

1369
01:39:52,519 --> 01:39:55,818
Hey Manuelito, helps Tito

All costs a Skimborrou

1372
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,342
What do you make here?

1373
01:40:21,648 --> 01:40:22,842
I came with the family

1374
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:27,684
We see each other again, Bearl and Byoo
they want to be in the afternoon

1375
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:34,093
And to be honest, I listened rumors
that taenias a business here

1376
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:36,660
Ah if? How did you know that?

1377
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:39,763
I received your e-mail for your inauguration

1378
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:45,560
If, taenia a great group
of and-mails...

1379
01:40:47,274 --> 01:40:49,071
Not I can believe that really

Did they separate?

1388

He/she is a good boy, but probably
never marry

1389
01:41:23,043 --> 01:41:24,237

1390

I suppose that now I know that that
you passed in your honeymoon

1391
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:32,241

In fact, I am in the hotel for if...

1399
01:42:08,555 --> 01:42:09,920

- It is incredible, it was...

1410
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,094

I believe that at the beginning you got angry
but later

1419
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:27,929
