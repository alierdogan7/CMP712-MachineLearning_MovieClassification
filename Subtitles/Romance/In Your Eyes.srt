1
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,355
Did you guys
hang out last night?

2
00:00:58,357 --> 00:00:59,723
Yeah, dude, you should have
been with us.

3
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,825
We took a whole six pack
from Dylan's dad.

4
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:03,459
It was my idea.

5
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:06,061
No way, did you guys
like, get drunk and stuff?

6
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:07,362
I don't remember a thing.

7
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:09,163
I blacked right out.

8
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:10,797
You only had a sip, you loser.

9
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,132
Dyl Pickle got scared.

10
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:15,267
Don't call me that, Lyle.

11
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:26,711
Rebecca, be careful.

12
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:36,152
So we're gonna get like a 12
pack this time.

13
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:37,520
I had to be the lookout.

14
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:39,455
Can't drink when I'm on the job.

15
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:42,157
Like your dad's gonna wake up?

16
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,258
Bell rang, boys.

17
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,393
Whatever, Mr. Howard.

18
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,728
It's just all a joke
to you guys?

19
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,696
Lets see how funny
these test scores are.

20
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:50,687
Honey, jump off.

21
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:58,892
Dylan, please get back
in your seat.

22
00:02:58,895 --> 00:02:59,627
Dylan?

23
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:00,527
Dylan, you okay?

24
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:01,828
Dylan!

25
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,296
Is he okay, Mr. Howard?

26
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:04,497
Dylan, buddy.

27
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:05,598
What's wrong with him, bro?

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,334
Dylan, wake up, hey, Dylan.

29
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:10,903
My God, Rebecca?

30
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:12,938
Rebecca, wake up!

31
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,540
Rebecca, honey, please wake up!

32
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:12,394
Dylan, my man.

33
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:16,364
You gotta get yourself
some new porn.

34
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:17,565
Want a beer?

35
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:18,832
I'm on the clock.

36
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:19,866
Where you been?

37
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:20,967
Out.

38
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,402
Crazy boy.

39
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:23,836
You clean the spark plugs
of that four by

40
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:25,755
with your goddamn tongue,

41
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,673
but you can't sweep up
in here every once in a while?

42
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:29,541
The only one who
comes around is you.

43
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:32,644
Then you should make an effort.

44
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:33,678
Where you been?

45
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,613
Car wash.

46
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:36,914
Got an extra shift.

47
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:37,981
Bullshit.

48
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,315
Call 'em.

49
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:39,948
Think I won't?

50
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,916
Think you should.

51
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,951
Have you been associating
with any known criminals?

52
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:45,686
No, Sir, I have not.

53
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:48,989
Have you crossed over
the state line at any time?

54
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:52,359
No, Sir, have not.

55
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:54,260
How's the job going?

56
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:57,563
It's boring,
but it's still mine.

57
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,665
Two months.

58
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,000
Gotta be some kind of record.

59
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,601
Anything else you need to know?

60
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,269
I need to know when
you're gonna slip up

61
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,471
and stick your pecker
in the grits again.

62
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,638
This may be a dumb question,

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,440
but what did I ever do to you?

64
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,978
You went into
other people's houses

65
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,512
and took things
that didn't belong to you,

66
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:22,014
things that they worked
long and hard for.

67
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:24,383
And I paid my debt, Giddons.

68
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:27,352
My conscience is shiny and new.

69
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:29,420
Yeah, well, how about
Bo and Lyle?

70
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:31,889
Bo and Lyle weren't on that job.

71
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:33,490
So the record states.

72
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:35,325
That is real sweet of you
to take the heat

73
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,994
for your old school buddies.

74
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:39,662
Giddons, all due respect,

75
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:43,065
you're not a detective,
you're my PO.

76
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:45,634
And I know that you
ride me more than most.

77
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,701
Why?

78
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:49,837
You're smart.

79
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,904
And ain't nothing in this world

80
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,972
dumber than a smart guy.

81
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:54,306
A smart man,

82
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:56,341
he sees beyond his little world

83
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:58,376
and it kind of warps him.

84
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:00,344
So when he makes
that wrong move,

85
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:01,745
and you will,

86
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:03,913
it tends to be messy.

87
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:08,484
Well, maybe there's a side
of me you don't see.

88
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:11,786
As long as you're on parole
you are only what I see.

89
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,325
Now, I'd lock the doors
if I was you.

90
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:21,361
There's burglars and thieves
around these parts.

91
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:49,354
I bet you thought
I wasn't gonna make it.

92
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:51,089
Yeah, I wasn't sure that I was.

93
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,124
That's right, you've only
had 12 hours to change.

94
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:54,525
You should have started
last night.

95
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:57,394
"Ha-ha" she said gamely.

96
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:58,695
Well, two of our trustees
are gonna be

97
00:06:58,697 --> 00:06:59,796
at the Thompsons'.

98
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:00,696
Do I have to be charming?

99
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:02,431
No, just be yourself.

100
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,099
Actually, you need to be
a little charming.

101
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,634
Just nod and smile
and talk to the wives.

102
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,535
It's the Thompsons,
Dorothy will be there,

103
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:10,103
you can gossip behind our backs.

104
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:13,773
I promise to turn my back
as often as possible.

105
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:16,442
Is that what you're wearing?

106
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:24,381
Woo!

107
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:25,715
Let's go double or nothing.

108
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:28,017
I'll spot you three balls
this time.

109
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,451
All tapped out, buddy.

110
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:31,019
Come on man, don't be a pussy.

111
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:32,553
I know you got some green
right there in that pocket.

112
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:33,520
No, I'm good.

113
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:34,954
Hey.

114
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,588
You walk out on a man
who's still gambling

115
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,056
you might catch a bad one, boy.

116
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,792
You starting fights again, Dyl?

117
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,393
What's up?

118
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,894
Why don't you
rack 'em up, big guy?

119
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,028
I'd be happy to take
Dyl's cash off you.

120
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,029
Come on, man.

121
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,031
Lemme buy you a beer.

122
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,800
So what you been
working on, man?

123
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:52,468
Dirty cars, mostly.

124
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,135
Yeah?

125
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:55,470
That sounds shitty.

126
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:57,138
Better work's coming.

127
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,539
A lot of businesses
going belly up

128
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,440
in this economy.

129
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:01,841
Ready?

130
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,710
Tons of shit just sitting there

131
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,645
just waiting to be picked.

132
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:08,513
I know you could use the money.

133
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:11,148
Especially if you ever
wanna play pool again.

134
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,616
Not exactly flush.

135
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,117
Well, hell, let's change that.

136
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,052
Hey, can I get a beer here
for my poor relation?

137
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,158
I'll be seeing you.

138
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,592
You know, Giddons finds out

139
00:08:24,594 --> 00:08:25,893
that you and Bo have been
chatting

140
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,494
he's gonna send you
right back up.

141
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:29,162
He probably will anyway.

142
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:31,130
Fourteen in the corner.

143
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,868
With authority.

144
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:44,175
Porters.

145
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:45,509
Hi.

146
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:46,743
Hi, how are you?

147
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,511
Fine, how are you?

148
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:56,117
Personally I think
you're a shoo-in.

149
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,618
I don't know, guys.

150
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,186
The city council
would be a good step,

151
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:00,753
but I still have
a hospital to run, you know?

152
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:02,188
I'm not sure I'm ready
to move on.

153
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,123
Methinks the man doth
protest too much.

154
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,991
Not at all.

155
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:08,126
You still got four months
of protesting ahead of him.

156
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:10,862
Wait until we start begging
before you announce.

157
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:11,929
Please don't ever...

158
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:12,963
a rumor, sweetie.

159
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:14,464
It's an undeniable truth,

160
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,832
it might as well be
written in print.

161
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:16,999
What's truth?

162
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:18,133
Chief Booth is having a thing,

163
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:20,802
he's taking lovers.

164
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:22,470
Paula Dodd.

165
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:23,137
Paula Dodd?

166
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,171
Is she that, she that...

167
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:25,572
Yeah, she runs that gift shop,

168
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,073
sells those ceramic things.

169
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:28,207
Yes thank you.

170
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,608
She's good.

171
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,842
What did you tell Audrey Booth?

172
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:32,743
She was
absolutely crucified.

173
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:34,878
But she has a right to know
if her husband cheated on her,

174
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,646
that's all I'm saying.

175
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:45,687
Hey, Dylan.

176
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:49,157
Hey, Donna.

177
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,191
Gonna buy me a drink?

178
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:53,594
I damn.

179
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:55,662
All cleaned out right now.

180
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:57,163
I mean, I would.

181
00:09:57,165 --> 00:09:58,697
You can have mine.

182
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,965
That's okay.

183
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,634
I don't want your cooties.

184
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,302
No, no, no, I've been
to a specialist about that

185
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,871
and they turned out to be
benign cooties.

186
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,939
So...

187
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,641
Wait, what?

188
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:13,709
Nothing, it's just a...

189
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,845
So what's been going on
with you?

190
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:20,181
Just, you know, the usual.

191
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:23,817
Hey, you working?

192
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:27,821
Yeah, yeah I'm over at the

193
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:30,290
National Car Wash still.

194
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:32,225
That's cool.

195
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:33,826
Yeah.

196
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:37,395
Okay.

197
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:43,334
I was, okay,
let's just talk later.

198
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:44,401
Yeah, I'll see you around.

199
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:45,068
All right.

200
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,935
Okay.

201
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,704
Good talking to you.

202
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:50,372
Hey, Eddie.

203
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:53,107
Look what the horse dragged in.

204
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:56,877
Yeah!

205
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:03,915
No, it's the best thing
in the world, really.

206
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,284
I only took the class
because Dorothy was taking it...

207
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:07,685
And for the naked men.

208
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:09,386
And for the naked men,
of course,

209
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:11,788
but now it's really
an obsession.

210
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,957
The drawing, I mean.

211
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,158
What about you, Becky?

212
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,859
Do you ever think about
taking classes?

213
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:20,761
I meant to take
a painting class for a while,

214
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,162
but I'm really no good.

215
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:24,264
Well you're not out
to make a living, sweetie.

216
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,331
Drawing will be good for you,

217
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,799
it clears out the cobwebs,

218
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,367
not that you have got
any cobwebs...

219
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,268
My God.

220
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,802
I had a streak, boy!

221
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:32,903
You walked away when
I was on a streak!

222
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:34,271
I had a streak!

223
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:38,775
Boys, keep it light, now!

224
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,209
Outside, come on!

225
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:42,743
You all right?

226
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:44,111
Man, I didn't even
see him coming.

227
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:46,413
Well, he knocked
the living piss out of you, man.

228
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,981
You okay?

229
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:49,416
Yeah, I'm fine.

230
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,850
Well let me pull you a beer
on the house,

231
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:52,918
how about it?

232
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,219
I'll pass, Wayne, thanks.

233
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,324
Rebecca.

234
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,059
Is she okay?

235
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:07,128
I'm sorry, sorry, I'm fine.

236
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,929
My God.

237
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:15,200
Hit him, yeah, hit him again.

238
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,436
You made your point, guys.

239
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:24,473
You're welcome.

240
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:49,463
Give me a little warning
next time

241
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:51,998
you're gonna have
another seizure, okay?

242
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:55,968
I mean, honey, really,
it was quite a show.

243
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,369
It was a muscle spasm.

244
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,970
I guess.

245
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,906
It hurt a lot.

246
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:04,875
For a second I...

247
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:06,076
felt like somebody hit me.

248
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:07,911
The look on your face, Becky.

249
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,946
It was a little much, you know?

250
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:13,182
Even for someone with
a muscle spasm.

251
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,022
I just, I guess for a second
I was worried

252
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,156
this was the beginning
of another...

253
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:23,757
It's not.

254
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:26,533
It's not.

255
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:29,994
Okay.

256
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:33,931
I'll give you a shoulder rub
when we get home.

257
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:37,801
It doesn't hurt anymore.

258
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:50,982
Hello?

259
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:51,916
Where are you at...?

260
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,218
What, what time is it?

261
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,653
Shit!

262
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,158
Shit!

263
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,038
Hello.

264
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,106
Hi.

265
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:02,207
Anything in particular?

266
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:05,276
No, I'm just stocking up.

267
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:46,411
Look out!

268
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:47,478
Fuck!

269
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:49,712
Fuck.

270
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:51,714
What?

271
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:54,183
- What?
- What?

272
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,618
Who is that?

273
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,219
Who said that?

274
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:59,353
Stop it.

275
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:00,253
Ma'am?

276
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:02,221
Who said that?

277
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:03,322
Stop this!

278
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:04,723
Stop this, stop it.

279
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,658
Ma'am, your bag.

280
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:09,627
Shit.

281
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:13,730
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it,

282
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:17,734
stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it,

283
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:19,068
stop it, stop it, stop it.

284
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,369
What is this, what's going on?

285
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:23,205
Stop it, stop this...

286
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:24,706
Hey, shut up!

287
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:30,244
Can you hear me?

288
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:31,411
Who are you?

289
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:32,712
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:33,746
I'm sorry,
what am I sorry about,

291
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:34,680
what did I do?

292
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:35,547
Who are you?

293
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,115
I asked you that.

294
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,220
I'm looking at a store window.

295
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,854
Am I looking at a store window?

296
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,489
Yes, I am.

297
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:47,756
Are you me?

298
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:51,426
No, no, no, you're in my head.

299
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,294
You're in my head.

300
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:55,729
I'm having...

301
00:18:55,731 --> 00:18:57,397
I'm losing...

302
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:59,766
God, I'm so scared.

303
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:00,833
Where am I?

304
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:01,767
What?

305
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:03,335
Where am I?

306
00:19:03,337 --> 00:19:06,438
You're on the road,
you're on a road.

307
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,139
There's a truck,

308
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:11,342
I don't understand,
what does the truck mean?

309
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,277
Well that means I have a truck.

310
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,346
It's my truck.

311
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:17,747
I have a truck.

312
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:22,318
You have a truck.

313
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,786
Yeah.

314
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,853
Why, what do you have?

315
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:26,221
What?

316
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:29,324
Um, a Range Rover.

317
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:31,225
Nice, safe.

318
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:38,765
I can see out there.

319
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:42,335
I can see here, too.

320
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:45,938
It's like one's close
and one's far away.

321
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,807
I just focus and

322
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:51,442
I can see what's here

323
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:53,377
or what's in my head.

324
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:54,344
This ain't your head, lady,

325
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:57,513
this is New Mexico.

326
00:19:57,515 --> 00:20:01,183
Wait, you're real.

327
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:03,485
You're a real person.

328
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:06,588
That's the sweetest thing
anybody said to me all day.

329
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:09,423
I don't understand this.

330
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:14,460
It's cold.

331
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:17,329
Wait are you,
are you cold there?

332
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:20,231
Yeah, it's um,
it's almost winter.

333
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,866
I can feel it.

334
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:24,234
This is too crazy.

335
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:24,934
And I can hear you...

336
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:26,868
Like I hear myself.

337
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:31,238
Where are you?

338
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,940
If you're not in my head
then where are you?

339
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,408
Exeter, New Hampshire.

340
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,910
New Hampshire?

341
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:39,578
Get outta here.

342
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,313
Wait a minute, what time is it?

343
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:42,580
No, what day?

344
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,982
Um, it's Thursday

345
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:48,919
the 24th?

346
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,987
Okay, well that's today,
I think.

347
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,388
Do you have a watch?

348
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,323
Yeah.

349
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:58,860
My God.

350
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:00,561
You're in the future.

351
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:02,262
You're two hours in the future!

352
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:03,930
No.

353
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:06,666
I'm in a different time zone.

354
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:08,601
Yeah, right.

355
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:12,971
Can you hear my thoughts?

356
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,974
I don't know, think something.

357
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,642
Okay.

358
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,543
What should I think about?

359
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,011
I'm not allowed to tell you.

360
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,313
Right.

361
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,847
Okay.

362
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:29,450
Yeah, no, I got nothing.

363
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:32,319
I'm thinking about new sneakers.

364
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:33,753
Okay.

365
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:34,787
That's a weird one.

366
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:35,820
All right, well, hey,

367
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:36,822
what if we just both...

368
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:38,356
Rebecca, are you all right?

369
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:39,390
Hello?

370
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:41,325
You there?

371
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:43,693
Hi.

372
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:45,394
Chief Booth.

373
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:46,328
You okay?

374
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,862
Yes.

375
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:48,996
I'm fine.

376
00:21:48,998 --> 00:21:50,464
I'm so sorry, I think I fell,

377
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:51,565
I think I'm...

378
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:54,435
Did you hurt yourself?

379
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:57,304
No, I think maybe
I had bad clams or something.

380
00:21:57,306 --> 00:22:01,041
Um, are you,
how are you, how's Audrey?

381
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:02,509
Good, she's great.

382
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:03,610
Are you sure you're all right?

383
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:07,280
Yeah, I'm great, I'm great.

384
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:10,349
Maybe if you just um,
walk me to my car

385
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:11,416
to be sure.

386
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:12,417
Absolutely.

387
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,551
- You know.
- Where are you?

388
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:15,352
I think I'm parked
right over here.

389
00:22:15,354 --> 00:22:16,637
You sure you're okay?

390
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:17,921
I'm totally fine.

391
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:24,059
Are you there?

392
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:29,063
Wow, 
guess we got disconnected.

393
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:31,999
Yeah, someone came and
I had to cut you off.

394
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,633
So, wait, how?

395
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:36,435
I mean, I could feel you
trying to come in.

396
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:38,603
This this kind of
swimmy feeling

397
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:42,406
in the back of my head,
but I could stop it.

398
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:43,907
That's good to know.

399
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,508
Yeah.

400
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:48,911
Um, I can't talk here.

401
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:50,879
People are um, staring at me.

402
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:52,814
Right.

403
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:54,748
And yea, assuming I still got a
job I need to get to it,

404
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,682
but I mean,
we gotta talk about all this.

405
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:59,920
Okay, later though.

406
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,621
- Seven o'clock?
- Okay.

407
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:03,589
Well, wait that's 
that's five my time,

408
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,057
I'm still at work.

409
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,925
Say ten, eight for me?

410
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,326
Yeah, great, fine, okay.

411
00:23:08,328 --> 00:23:09,760
Okay.

412
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:12,429
And if, you know,
it doesn't work for some reason

413
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:15,031
then

414
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:18,433
It was nice meeting you.

415
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,436
Hey.

416
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:24,371
It's snowing.

417
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:53,799
Hey, hey, hey.

418
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:55,600
On top.

419
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,696
My God, it's almost ten.

420
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:29,465
Why, yes, it is.

421
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,567
Is it, is it some cause
for excitement?

422
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,835
No, no, no, no.

423
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:35,102
Just we ate so late.

424
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:36,136
Yeah, I told you it was
gonna be a long day.

425
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:37,403
Yeah, I know.

426
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:40,139
No, I was just, I just meant,

427
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:41,540
I just meant you must be tired

428
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:42,674
and thinking about going to bed.

429
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:44,509
Well, I'm not.

430
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:45,543
Is that okay?

431
00:24:45,545 --> 00:24:47,111
Of course!

432
00:24:47,113 --> 00:24:49,113
Good.

433
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,493
Actually um,

434
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:05,795
there was a show I wanted
to um, to watch.

435
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,631
Yeah,
that sounds fun for you.

436
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,483
My God.

437
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:35,621
Well, yeah, hi.

438
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:38,557
Boy, did I not
expect this to work.

439
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,624
I thought I was just...

440
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:41,125
I know, I did, too.

441
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:43,060
Man, okay.

442
00:25:43,062 --> 00:25:45,495
Well, I just,

443
00:25:45,497 --> 00:25:46,863
I spent all day
just trying to think

444
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:48,598
why this could be happening.

445
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,665
So?

446
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,500
Did you come up with anything?

447
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:54,135
Well, you know, one thing
did occur to me.

448
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:57,872
Are you by any chance

449
00:25:57,874 --> 00:25:59,840
Satan?

450
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:00,740
No.

451
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:02,675
Um...

452
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:06,211
My name is Rebecca.

453
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:08,680
That's, wow,
I didn't even think of that.

454
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:09,747
I'm Dylan.

455
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:12,215
Dylan.

456
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:13,482
That's nice.

457
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:17,718
This is a nice room.

458
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,852
Is this your place?

459
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:20,753
Yeah, this is my house.

460
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:23,222
I mean, it's my husband's.

461
00:26:23,224 --> 00:26:25,824
You're married.

462
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:27,726
Yeah, why not?

463
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:29,627
I mean, you got a name,
you could be married, too.

464
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,662
Did you tell him about it?

465
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:32,729
Um...

466
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:36,899
No, I

467
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:39,868
I, I just wasn't sure.

468
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,836
Yeah, I mean,

469
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:44,572
maybe it's better
if you don't right away.

470
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:45,673
I don't know,

471
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:46,840
this is just hard enough
to believe

472
00:26:46,842 --> 00:26:47,874
if it's happening to you.

473
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:49,909
Yeah.

474
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:52,711
I'm gonna wait.

475
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:54,713
Wait.

476
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:57,615
So, this is your house?

477
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,250
No, it's yeah, yeah, it is,

478
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,686
but it's a little messy.

479
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,655
It's kind of the maid's
decade off.

480
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:15,830
Wait, what are you doing?

481
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:17,932
It's better this way.

482
00:27:17,934 --> 00:27:20,401
Shouldn't have to...

483
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:22,936
I don't really have girls
over too much.

484
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:25,838
My God, I have to ask you!

485
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,906
Did you um,

486
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:30,908
did you get hit last night
on the shoulder,

487
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,776
like really hard?

488
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,644
Yeah, I sure did!

489
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:35,878
This son of a bitch just like
came at me...

490
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,346
With a pool cue!

491
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:39,414
I know, I was there!

492
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:43,284
And I was also
at this dinner party.

493
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:53,293
trying to fend him off.

494
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:54,360
Becky?

495
00:27:58,366 --> 00:28:00,366
Sorry, it's Vicky Madden.

496
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:03,736
I was just telling her about
my smooth move last night.

497
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:06,838
You must tell it really well.

498
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,006
Yeah, what was that?

499
00:28:09,008 --> 00:28:12,909
God, yes,
the kids sound amazing.

500
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:15,411
I can't believe that.

501
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:16,412
That was very smooth.

502
00:28:16,414 --> 00:28:18,847
Thank you, Vicky.

503
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:23,317
So that was your husband?

504
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,851
Yeah.

505
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:27,954
Um, yeah, that's Phillip.

506
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,055
Good looking guy?

507
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:33,358
Yeah, doctor, he runs the um,

508
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,459
hospital here.

509
00:28:36,129 --> 00:28:37,862
Professional man.

510
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:39,730
Yeah.

511
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,332
I should probably go.

512
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:46,934
Well, do you wanna
talk again tomorrow?

513
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:52,372
Okay, but after Phillip
goes to work.

514
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:53,773
You're not like,

515
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,441
planning on getting hit
again, are you?

516
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:56,775
Well, let's see.

517
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,343
It's not in my book.

518
00:28:58,345 --> 00:28:59,477
Nah, that wasn't nothing anyway.

519
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:03,447
Worst I ever took was...

520
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:05,048
My God.

521
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:07,783
What?

522
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:08,784
Let me ask you something.

523
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:10,418
Did you ever go sledding?

524
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,853
Did you ever go sledding
and get really hurt?

525
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:16,389
I hit a tree.

526
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:18,457
Jesus H. God!

527
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:22,059
I got knocked out cold.

528
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,995
I mean, I must have been out
for more than a minute.

529
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,764
I still have the scar.

530
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,500
Dylan, that was 20 years ago.

531
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,836
I'll be damned.

532
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:09,503
I got 12 stitches.

533
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:13,273
And my mom never let me
go sledding again.

534
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:17,977
Not that I was all that keen to.

535
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:20,212
Hey, what about when
you were like

536
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:21,980
I don't know, maybe 16?

537
00:30:21,982 --> 00:30:24,882
You were all torn up
about something.

538
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:26,516
I wanna say it was like,
the dead of summer and,

539
00:30:26,518 --> 00:30:28,050
I mean it must have
been a killer

540
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:30,519
because I must have been
cross-eyed for a month.

541
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:32,787
That is so embarrassing.

542
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:35,339
What?

543
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,156
I can't tell you,
it's um, too personal.

544
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:38,992
Come on, you got to!

545
00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:42,562
You owe me a whole July.

546
00:30:42,564 --> 00:30:45,798
That was...

547
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,067
Walter, my first boyfriend.

548
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:50,802
I was so in love with him.

549
00:30:50,804 --> 00:30:53,037
He was 20, you know?

550
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,805
I don't know, we went out for
like, two months

551
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:58,208
and then he broke up with me
right after we, you know.

552
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:01,944
No wonder.

553
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:03,545
Yeah.

554
00:31:03,547 --> 00:31:07,415
I mean like, right after.

555
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,016
What a dick.

556
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:11,184
Sorry if I 
ruined your summer.

557
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:15,020
No, it's cool.

558
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:17,255
I was, you know,
pretty used to having like,

559
00:31:17,257 --> 00:31:20,825
weird moods and you know,
stuff I couldn't really explain.

560
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:22,560
Yeah, me, too.

561
00:31:22,562 --> 00:31:24,895
I pretty much thought
that you were PMS.

562
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:26,162
Yeah, a lot of people
get us mixed up.

563
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:32,234
I remember some other
stuff, too, but, I don't know,

564
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:34,903
I guess it's all
kind of personal.

565
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:37,171
Like your mom.

566
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:39,473
Yeah, that figures.

567
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:41,575
You were in college, right?

568
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:44,044
Yeah.

569
00:31:44,046 --> 00:31:45,545
She wasn't ever very well.

570
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:49,548
She was, like me, kind of?

571
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:54,852
Not much of a physical specimen.

572
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:57,888
Dylan, there's something,

573
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,923
didn't make any sense
to me at the time, but,

574
00:31:59,925 --> 00:32:03,126
you know, I always felt like
there was someone with me.

575
00:32:03,128 --> 00:32:05,862
You know, just like a feeling.

576
00:32:05,864 --> 00:32:07,196
I felt it um,

577
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:11,200
more strongly than ever
after she died.

578
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:13,535
It helped.

579
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:16,237
Did you ever feel that way?

580
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,639
Why don't you tell me?

581
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:23,043
I remember your first
night in prison.

582
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:25,211
Yeah, right.

583
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:29,215
Time to come clean.

584
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:30,249
What'd you do?

585
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:34,219
I just good with locks.

586
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:37,288
Not that good
with silent alarms.

587
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,222
Got two years,

588
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:42,124
in with mostly lifers.

589
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:46,594
Yeah, I figured that was
nightmares,

590
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:47,995
it was really terrifying.

591
00:32:47,997 --> 00:32:49,429
Yeah.

592
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:51,397
Yeah, I never felt as alone
as I did in there

593
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:52,464
doing my bid.

594
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:55,666
You weren't.

595
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,938
Hey, haha, Jesus, hey.

596
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,972
What?

597
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:05,641
Go look in the mirror.

598
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:06,675
What?

599
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:08,209
Come on!

600
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:09,176
I don't even hardly
know what you look like

601
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:10,310
except mostly your hands.

602
00:33:10,312 --> 00:33:12,912
Um, um...

603
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:14,280
Go on, show me.

604
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:18,017
I, you know,
why don't you do that?

605
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:20,986
'Cause I asked first.

606
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:24,622
Well, I'm not doing it
unless you do it, too.

607
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:26,090
Okay.

608
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:27,991
But after you.

609
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:29,292
I'm not even dressed.

610
00:33:29,294 --> 00:33:32,194
Well, come on,
whose fault is that, lazybones?

611
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:33,595
Let's go.

612
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:36,530
Fine.

613
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,238
This is ridiculous, I'm scared.

614
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,972
Come on, what have you got

615
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:48,173
to be scared of?

616
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:50,275
Shut up, you're scared, too.

617
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:51,676
Okay.

618
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,013
I'm going to the mirror now.

619
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,999
God, I'm beautiful.

620
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,034
Don't be stupid.

621
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:20,702
No, when I said
"beautiful" I meant,

622
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:22,270
you know, ugly, wart covered,

623
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:24,105
what did I say?

624
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:25,406
Just don't flatter me because

625
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,408
I spent the night
in prison with you.

626
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,742
What are you talking about?

627
00:34:28,744 --> 00:34:30,076
Hey, look, I was having fun

628
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:31,377
being a beautiful girl there.

629
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,312
I was all ready to go...

630
00:34:33,314 --> 00:34:35,180
buy hats or something, go back.

631
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:36,114
No.

632
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,082
No, it's your turn.

633
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:40,751
Hold on, just give me a second.

634
00:34:40,753 --> 00:34:43,019
It's your turn!

635
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:51,059
Read 'em and weep.

636
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:58,266
You've got such a nice face.

637
00:34:58,268 --> 00:34:59,433
Nice?

638
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:01,668
No.

639
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:05,237
I mean yeah, it is.

640
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,538
Well, it ain't much,

641
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,072
but it does cover
my unsightly skull,

642
00:35:08,074 --> 00:35:10,040
so that's a plus.

643
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:23,686
- Hi.
- Hi.

644
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,529
No, no, no,
it was nothing like that.

645
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:36,797
We um,

646
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:38,899
we actually met when he,

647
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:42,569
when he lectured at my school.

648
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:44,370
I know, it sounds terrible,

649
00:35:44,372 --> 00:35:47,139
but it was really nice.

650
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:48,373
We just got along great and...

651
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,540
What did you say?

652
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,542
Nothing, it was the phone.

653
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:53,911
Um, did you figure it out?

654
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:55,345
I wish I could
describe it better.

655
00:35:55,347 --> 00:35:56,779
It was like a chugging noise.

656
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,413
Yeah, I know.

657
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:00,348
What it is, you got a crack
in your manifold.

658
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,449
They go on you.

659
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,149
You need to replace it.

660
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:03,250
Okay.

661
00:36:03,252 --> 00:36:04,484
Let me check my stock and

662
00:36:04,486 --> 00:36:05,852
probably rack you up today,
yeah?

663
00:36:05,854 --> 00:36:06,719
Yeah, that's great.

664
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:07,419
Excellent.

665
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:08,753
Thank you.

666
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:10,254
What year is your truck?

667
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:12,889
A 2010.

668
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:14,590
There's no way
the exhaust system

669
00:36:14,592 --> 00:36:16,758
on a Range Rover would go
after just a few years.

670
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,528
Here, turn her over.

671
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,297
Okay, go look under the hood.

672
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:25,332
Like, what, now?

673
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,167
No, after he charges you
1200 bucks.

674
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:28,868
Yeah, come on.

675
00:36:37,245 --> 00:36:39,845
Okay.

676
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:41,479
What am I looking at?

677
00:36:43,883 --> 00:36:45,649
Okay.

678
00:36:45,651 --> 00:36:47,417
That sounds like it could just
be the sensor got loose,

679
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:49,919
so that should be over
by the ABS.

680
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:52,288
I don't know what that is.

681
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,924
That, that,
that boxy thing there.

682
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:57,892
Okay, over here?

683
00:36:57,894 --> 00:36:59,627
No.

684
00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:01,562
Okay, try the other side.

685
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:02,930
Over here?

686
00:37:02,932 --> 00:37:06,333
It's like
a multi prong thing.

687
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:09,269
You're looking for like,
a multi prong plug in thing.

688
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:10,403
See that?

689
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:12,571
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

690
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:14,539
What do we do with it?

691
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:15,573
Look, it's loose.

692
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,840
Plug it in.

693
00:37:16,842 --> 00:37:19,509
There's your problem
right there.

694
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:20,576
The sound stopped.

695
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:21,476
Yup.

696
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:22,443
That's it?

697
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:23,410
That's it.

698
00:37:23,412 --> 00:37:24,544
I fixed it.

699
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:27,280
Yes you did, darling.

700
00:37:27,282 --> 00:37:28,447
Hey, you're in luck,
I can take you today.

701
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:29,748
We are in luck,

702
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,283
the intake and exhaust manifolds
are both fine.

703
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:33,584
The um...

704
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:34,818
Sensor.

705
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,786
Sensor just needed tightening.

706
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,587
I don't think that's gonna
do you much good

707
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,455
in the long run but, yeah,
I can take care of it for you.

708
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:43,291
No, that's all right,
I already did it.

709
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:44,692
Thanks, Stan.

710
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:49,596
And they put me in prison.

711
00:38:25,695 --> 00:38:26,827
What is that?

712
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:32,364
Never.

713
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,007
Kershaw.

714
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:05,543
So, how's the auto cleansing
business treating you?

715
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:07,945
Actually I've been thinking
about looking for some new work.

716
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:08,645
Who with?

717
00:40:08,647 --> 00:40:10,213
Bo, Lyle?

718
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:11,780
I wanna see if I can't
scare up something better.

719
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:13,649
I mean, I ain't
gonna quit or nothing,

720
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:15,717
not till I'm sure, but...

721
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:19,553
What's with you?

722
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:20,587
You got a funny look.

723
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:21,821
What?

724
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:23,556
You look like
you're about to kiss me.

725
00:40:23,558 --> 00:40:25,624
Well, I mean, when the light

726
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:27,726
hits you like that
something about your head...

727
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:29,427
Well, solicitation is a crime,

728
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,495
so what's going on, Kershaw?

729
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:33,430
Nothing's going on.

730
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,767
For such a smart man
you are a piss poor liar.

731
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,740
I met someone.

732
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:51,545
Well, there it is! Yeah!

733
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,580
You getting your pecker
waxed?

734
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:55,381
She know you a con?

735
00:40:55,383 --> 00:40:57,116
She doesn't seem to mind.

736
00:40:57,118 --> 00:41:00,085
You got you one of
them classy women.

737
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:01,986
You'd be surprised.

738
00:41:01,988 --> 00:41:04,121
Nothing you do
could surprise me.

739
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,726
Over there.

740
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:19,734
I like that you told him
you had a girlfriend.

741
00:41:19,736 --> 00:41:22,069
Yeah, well, some people
will believe anything.

742
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:24,037
Come on, you've had girlfriends.

743
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:26,806
Nothing that lasted more
than a few dates.

744
00:41:26,808 --> 00:41:28,874
Just not good with women.

745
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,742
What about your man needs?

746
00:41:31,744 --> 00:41:32,876
Becky!

747
00:41:32,878 --> 00:41:34,744
You got a mind like a sewer.

748
00:41:37,615 --> 00:41:40,015
Shoot.

749
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:41,416
Move the other six back

750
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,483
then you can move that one over.

751
00:41:42,485 --> 00:41:44,151
No, dummy, that's cheating.

752
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:46,653
It's not cheating,
it's creative.

753
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:49,622
It's no fun to cheat,
it's no fun if you win.

754
00:41:49,624 --> 00:41:51,090
The only reason you don't cheat

755
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,492
is 'cause you're afraid
someone will get mad.

756
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:55,427
Can't always do what
you're told, darling.

757
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,496
Spoken like a true convict.

758
00:42:02,502 --> 00:42:03,634
I'm sorry.

759
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:07,437
What, no, yeah, it's okay.

760
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,504
I got no right to be touchy,

761
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:09,872
it's all true.

762
00:42:14,477 --> 00:42:17,644
Hey...

763
00:42:17,646 --> 00:42:19,178
I think I figured it out.

764
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,646
You know, why it happened

765
00:42:20,648 --> 00:42:22,714
or why we opened it up
when we did.

766
00:42:22,716 --> 00:42:23,481
Really?

767
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:24,081
Really.

768
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,148
Why?

769
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:28,517
Why not?

770
00:42:33,723 --> 00:42:35,155
What up, Dyl Pickle?

771
00:42:38,226 --> 00:42:40,492
I gotta go Becky,

772
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:41,826
got something I gotta do.

773
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:44,661
Okay, I'll see you.

774
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,066
Gruman Tech Supply.

775
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,167
The bitch is ripe, Dylan.

776
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,468
Is it?

777
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,037
You know our cousin, Adam?

778
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,171
The one who beat that
aggravated assault charge

779
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,739
against the 7-Eleven clerk?

780
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,073
Kicked his lard ass
all up and down

781
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,424
the freezer section.

782
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:00,774
He's been working maintenance
in the office park.

783
00:43:00,777 --> 00:43:03,277
He says Gruman is empty
as church service

784
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:04,678
on Super Bowl Sunday.

785
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,613
Here's the best part.

786
00:43:06,615 --> 00:43:07,947
No silent alarms.

787
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:09,348
Don't it just make
your heart sing?

788
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,116
You know Giddons is just
drooling for me

789
00:43:11,118 --> 00:43:12,951
to make a move like this.

790
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:14,319
Don't worry about Giddons,
he'll sleep through it.

791
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:15,987
Your end is two hours at most.

792
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:17,655
You open up the pearly gates,

793
00:43:17,657 --> 00:43:18,989
we handle the rest.

794
00:43:18,991 --> 00:43:20,023
You don't wanna be seen with us,

795
00:43:20,025 --> 00:43:21,691
yeah, I get it, I get it, man.

796
00:43:21,693 --> 00:43:24,694
Hell, we'll mail you your cut.

797
00:43:24,696 --> 00:43:26,262
I could use some
walking around money.

798
00:43:26,264 --> 00:43:27,896
Yeah, but this is more than
just walking around money.

799
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:30,265
We got a fence lined up
in Wilberfield?

800
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:32,367
He's gonna buy the whole lot.

801
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:33,835
Your parole gets through,

802
00:43:33,837 --> 00:43:36,671
this is you setting up
in a new town.

803
00:43:36,673 --> 00:43:38,806
Like a proper man.

804
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:41,275
All you gotta do is keep
your pretty trap shut,

805
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:42,909
Dyl Pickle.

806
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,244
Who's ever gonna know?

807
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,817
I don't know, I just...

808
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:54,819
Ain't exactly
good timing for me.

809
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:56,153
What else you gonna do man?

810
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:57,821
You just gonna wax
a bunch of Caddies?

811
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,856
Dylan, this was your idea.

812
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:02,325
When you got out
you asked for some action.

813
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:03,326
Something to get back
on your feet,

814
00:44:03,328 --> 00:44:04,694
something safe.

815
00:44:04,696 --> 00:44:06,996
Now this is way the hell
out in Bedlow

816
00:44:06,998 --> 00:44:08,998
and all that equipment's
just sitting there.

817
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It ain't nobody's,
it's gonna rust.

818
00:44:11,002 --> 00:44:12,334
There's no victim here.

819
00:44:12,336 --> 00:44:14,002
Just a true convict.

820
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:17,338
Dylan, we let you in on this
because you asked.

821
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,741
Now I don't like you knowing
if you don't have a stake in it.

822
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:26,326
We'll be waiting on you, boy.

823
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:33,785
Catch you soon, Dyl Pickle.

824
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:09,018
Hey.

825
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,919
Phillip!

826
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:11,886
Sorry, you startled me.

827
00:45:11,888 --> 00:45:13,854
Sorry.

828
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:15,722
You know how I get
in these places.

829
00:45:15,724 --> 00:45:18,357
Yeah, I do which is why
I'm surprised to see you here.

830
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:19,424
Everything all right?

831
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:21,125
Yeah, everything's fine.

832
00:45:21,127 --> 00:45:23,794
I was around and
I had a wild notion

833
00:45:23,796 --> 00:45:26,029
you might be free for lunch.

834
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:27,797
Um...

835
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:29,265
It was a pretty wild notion.

836
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:33,135
Let-, I still got my doctor's
cap on I'm afraid, um...

837
00:45:33,137 --> 00:45:35,103
Maynard's here to discuss
his research program.

838
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:38,339
The um,
the schizophrenic narc...

839
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:39,740
Narcotherapy.

840
00:45:39,742 --> 00:45:41,141
It's a big word hun.

841
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:44,110
Which reminds me
next Thursday

842
00:45:44,112 --> 00:45:46,812
is the big fundraiser so
don't put us down for anything.

843
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:47,445
Okay.

844
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:48,878
Okay, good.

845
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:53,015
Dennis.

846
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:54,149
Phillip.

847
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,950
You remember my wife, Becky?

848
00:45:55,952 --> 00:45:57,718
Yes, nice to see you again.

849
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,885
Dr. Maynard.

850
00:45:58,887 --> 00:46:00,786
Do you two have plans?

851
00:46:00,788 --> 00:46:03,288
No um...

852
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,123
I just need to remember
to call ahead first

853
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:07,458
if I'm going to be spontaneous.

854
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:11,178
I see.

855
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:12,028
Okay, I'll just
leave you guys then.

856
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,396
Okay, I shouldn't be
late for dinner.

857
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:15,214
Okay.

858
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:17,031
And um, I'll see you Thursday
at the fundraiser.

859
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:19,334
I look forward to it.

860
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:25,139
It's hard to tell right off.

861
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:26,507
Yeah, I wish you could have
spent more time with her.

862
00:46:26,509 --> 00:46:28,775
I just, I didn't know
she was coming.

863
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:30,143
Well I see what
you're talking about.

864
00:46:30,145 --> 00:46:33,880
Her, her body language
is very protective,

865
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:35,381
very concealing.

866
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:38,817
She's deeply uncomfortable.

867
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,084
It's odd.

868
00:46:40,086 --> 00:46:41,752
Yeah, she's always
been skittish.

869
00:46:41,754 --> 00:46:44,020
I, I just, I don't know.

870
00:46:46,391 --> 00:46:47,523
Wait, wait, who's this guy?

871
00:46:47,525 --> 00:46:49,258
That's Muffler Mike.

872
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,826
His muffler's been busted
for about eight years

873
00:46:50,828 --> 00:46:53,428
so everyone knows
when he's coming.

874
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,898
And that is Bob Breezy,

875
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,400
we call him, yup, Breezy Bob.

876
00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:01,802
Okay, so it's not brilliant
but...

877
00:47:08,176 --> 00:47:11,377
Yeah, I actually
worked with him once

878
00:47:11,379 --> 00:47:13,379
on a highway job.

879
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:15,013
He's got a real
interesting smell.

880
00:47:22,154 --> 00:47:23,953
You got a problem, buddy?

881
00:47:23,955 --> 00:47:25,120
Tell him to go fuck himself.

882
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:26,121
No.

883
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:27,555
Go fuck yourself, dude.

884
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:29,390
Nope, nope, no problem at all,
we're cool.

885
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:30,858
Such a wimp.

886
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,827
Do you like it when we get hit?

887
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,964
Hey, who's that, she's hot.

888
00:47:38,966 --> 00:47:41,232
Yeah, that's Donna,
she's a nice girl.

889
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,866
She's a nice girl?

890
00:47:42,868 --> 00:47:45,501
Is she married,
is she covered in sores?

891
00:47:45,503 --> 00:47:48,136
Not to hear it.

892
00:47:48,138 --> 00:47:49,137
Wait, she's waving.

893
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:50,404
I know.

894
00:47:50,406 --> 00:47:52,005
You guys are friends,
ask her out.

895
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:53,439
I'm not gonna just ask her.

896
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:55,441
Don't be a wuss,
you know you want her.

897
00:47:55,443 --> 00:47:56,575
Shut up.

898
00:47:56,577 --> 00:47:58,843
Look, she's coming over!

899
00:47:58,845 --> 00:48:02,012
What is this strange power
you have over women?

900
00:48:02,014 --> 00:48:03,346
If you don't shut up
I'm gonna shut you out.

901
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:04,230
You better not,

902
00:48:04,231 --> 00:48:05,113
not when our girlfriend's here.

903
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:05,981
Hey, Dylan.

904
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,215
Come to me, wench.

905
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,416
Hey, Donna.

906
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,517
Hey.

907
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,886
Are you here alone?

908
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,854
Jenny's supposed to
be coming, but...

909
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,892
Haven't seen you
around much lately.

910
00:48:18,894 --> 00:48:20,460
Haven't been around.

911
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:22,528
Duh, say you like her shoes.

912
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,563
I like your shoes.

913
00:48:24,565 --> 00:48:27,065
They, they work.

914
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:28,132
I can't believe
you noticed them.

915
00:48:28,134 --> 00:48:29,399
I got them on sale.

916
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:31,100
They pretty much go
with everything.

917
00:48:31,102 --> 00:48:32,585
See?

918
00:48:32,586 --> 00:48:34,069
You compliment them on
something they did or bought,

919
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:36,204
not like their eyes or
something they were born with,

920
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:37,872
that's how they know
that you like them,

921
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:39,106
you like their taste, you
like their...

922
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:39,906
Shut up.

923
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:44,143
I just hate this song.

924
00:48:44,145 --> 00:48:46,178
You're joking, this is like,
my favorite song.

925
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,980
I know, just, I've heard it
so many times.

926
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:51,214
Yeah, that's true,
they do play it a lot.

927
00:48:53,518 --> 00:48:55,551
Ask her out, ask her out,

928
00:48:55,553 --> 00:48:57,085
ask her out!

929
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:00,088
Say, Donna, I was thinking.

930
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:03,091
Are you,
are you busy Tuesday night?

931
00:49:04,227 --> 00:49:06,359
I'm busy most nights.

932
00:49:09,931 --> 00:49:11,063
What'd you have in mind?

933
00:49:11,065 --> 00:49:14,099
I just thought that

934
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:16,134
I could cook for you,
I could cook for you.

935
00:49:16,136 --> 00:49:18,536
I could cook you dinner.

936
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,288
You cook?

937
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:22,039
Yeah, I mean, well,
a thing or two.

938
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,640
What do you like?

939
00:49:23,642 --> 00:49:27,076
Um, well I like steaks.

940
00:49:27,078 --> 00:49:28,343
Big steaks.

941
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:30,178
All right, all right, yeah,
I could,

942
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,513
I'll fix you up a rare steak

943
00:49:32,515 --> 00:49:35,249
with a fancy sauce
and trimmings for days.

944
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:36,984
If you're not too busy.

945
00:49:36,986 --> 00:49:38,285
I am so smooth.

946
00:49:38,287 --> 00:49:39,519
Tuesday I'm seeing my momma,

947
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:41,220
but I think Thursday I'm free.

948
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:42,221
Done,
dinner at 6:30.

949
00:49:42,223 --> 00:49:44,289
No, no, no, no, no.

950
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,057
I'm busy Thursday night.

951
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:47,625
You're not coming.

952
00:49:47,627 --> 00:49:48,993
Jenny's here.

953
00:49:48,995 --> 00:49:50,060
So 6:30.

954
00:49:50,062 --> 00:49:50,994
6:30.

955
00:49:50,996 --> 00:49:53,396
Okay, gotta go, see ya.

956
00:49:54,532 --> 00:49:57,065
Phillip and I have a fundraiser
Thursday night, you dope.

957
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:58,633
Yeah, you think I want you
coming on my date

958
00:49:58,635 --> 00:49:59,667
telling me how to kiss
and stuff?

959
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:01,101
Who made you ask her out?

960
00:50:01,103 --> 00:50:02,102
You couldn't even talk to her,

961
00:50:02,104 --> 00:50:03,303
you're nothing without me.

962
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:05,071
Still not coming.

963
00:50:05,073 --> 00:50:07,473
I made you and I can break you.

964
00:50:30,129 --> 00:50:32,129
This event
is going to be so great.

965
00:50:32,131 --> 00:50:34,097
It'll help with the Laramie
Project.

966
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:37,133
A charity donation is
just like any other investment.

967
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:39,668
You wanna know your money
is being put to good use.

968
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,238
Wow, you know, I can't think
of a better place

969
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,340
to put your money
than in the research fund.

970
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:47,275
Of course you can't,
your husband's on the board!

971
00:50:48,778 --> 00:50:50,210
But no, you're right.

972
00:50:50,212 --> 00:50:52,478
Sick people are always the best.

973
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,414
Real lump in the throat stuff,
these hospital charities.

974
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:57,449
Give me cripples every time.

975
00:50:57,451 --> 00:51:00,385
These are psychos,
not cripples, but you know,

976
00:51:00,387 --> 00:51:03,654
would you mind excusing me
just a minute?

977
00:51:11,296 --> 00:51:12,295
How's it going?

978
00:51:12,297 --> 00:51:13,229
What?

979
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:14,363
How's it going?

980
00:51:14,365 --> 00:51:16,398
I'm fine, yeah.

981
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,800
Why, what do you want?

982
00:51:19,435 --> 00:51:22,803
Nothing, I'm just checking in,
seeing how it's going.

983
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:24,404
Yeah, everything's great.

984
00:51:24,406 --> 00:51:26,339
Your sauce is burning.

985
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:29,108
This is nuts.

986
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:30,159
I haven't cooked anything

987
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,209
that didn't take microwave
instructions

988
00:51:31,212 --> 00:51:33,178
since ever.

989
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,579
Here, smell this.

990
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:39,149
What is that, um, rosemary?

991
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:39,749
Yeah, too much?

992
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:41,517
No, no!

993
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:43,752
It's a little thick, though.

994
00:51:43,754 --> 00:51:45,253
Yeah, you said it's
supposed to be thick.

995
00:51:45,255 --> 00:51:48,256
Yeah, but not like,
thick as a brick.

996
00:51:56,432 --> 00:51:57,431
What?

997
00:51:57,433 --> 00:51:59,099
You hate this shirt.

998
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:00,533
This is the wrong shirt,

999
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,334
women everywhere
revile this shirt.

1000
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:05,737
Dylan, maintain.

1001
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:08,473
The tie's a little rodeo,
but it's gonna be okay.

1002
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:10,475
Yeah, easy for you to say.

1003
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:11,809
How's your money dinner?

1004
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:13,844
You know,
stuffed shirts anonymous,

1005
00:52:13,846 --> 00:52:16,379
I just have to worry about
not falling asleep.

1006
00:52:17,248 --> 00:52:18,313
Shit.

1007
00:52:19,749 --> 00:52:21,415
Hey, you're gonna be great.

1008
00:52:21,417 --> 00:52:22,849
Good luck.

1009
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:24,250
Thanks.

1010
00:52:29,723 --> 00:52:30,755
Hi.

1011
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:31,756
How you doing?

1012
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:33,324
Good, how are you?

1013
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:35,859
Shit.

1014
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,127
Well done.

1015
00:52:44,201 --> 00:52:45,500
Okay.

1016
00:52:45,502 --> 00:52:46,801
Everything, that's good,

1017
00:52:46,803 --> 00:52:48,302
that'll be great, yeah.

1018
00:52:48,304 --> 00:52:50,203
- Come on in.
- Okay.

1019
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,475
Never seen your place before.

1020
00:52:56,477 --> 00:52:57,843
You haven't?

1021
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:00,278
I thought, you weren't out here
for the Fourth?

1022
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,345
I don't think so.

1023
00:53:01,347 --> 00:53:03,347
I thought you were.

1024
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:04,514
Yeah.

1025
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:06,148
I had a barbecue.

1026
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,349
It's kind of my own concept,

1027
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,584
barbecue on the Fourth of July.

1028
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,519
Lots of people do that.

1029
00:53:12,855 --> 00:53:15,488
I I like,

1030
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,491
really like your shoes.

1031
00:53:18,493 --> 00:53:20,493
You got a thing for feet?

1032
00:53:20,495 --> 00:53:22,161
Dated a guy like that once.

1033
00:53:22,163 --> 00:53:22,794
Real weirdo.

1034
00:53:22,796 --> 00:53:24,395
No, no, I don't.

1035
00:53:24,397 --> 00:53:25,896
Can I get you
something to drink?

1036
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:29,332
I did pick up
some red wine if you like.

1037
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:32,268
You got a beer?

1038
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,203
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

1039
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:35,470
I'll take one of those,
actually.

1040
00:53:35,472 --> 00:53:37,438
Thanks.

1041
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,540
Just twist, yeah, cheers.

1042
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:41,208
Cheers.

1043
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:47,247
So you really
cook and everything?

1044
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:48,314
Now and then.

1045
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,284
Ew.

1046
00:53:52,286 --> 00:53:53,518
What's this?

1047
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,453
It's the sauce.

1048
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,922
That smells kinda crazy.

1049
00:53:58,924 --> 00:54:01,524
Becky: Bimbo.

1050
00:54:01,959 --> 00:54:04,392
Well, it's not for tonight.

1051
00:54:04,394 --> 00:54:05,459
Okay.

1052
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:10,530
Yeah, I don't like
my steaks all fancy.

1053
00:54:10,532 --> 00:54:12,298
Just burnt black
with tons of ketchup.

1054
00:54:13,534 --> 00:54:15,367
Figures.

1055
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:17,369
Figures what?

1056
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:19,437
Sorry?

1057
00:54:19,439 --> 00:54:20,471
I thought you had spoken.

1058
00:54:20,473 --> 00:54:23,273
Gosh.

1059
00:54:23,275 --> 00:54:25,208
Maybe I did.

1060
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:25,741
I think I was...

1061
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:28,810
Whoa, whoa!

1062
00:54:28,812 --> 00:54:29,610
No!

1063
00:54:29,612 --> 00:54:30,877
Hot, hot, hot!

1064
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,846
You missed it!

1065
00:54:33,848 --> 00:54:35,514
Put it in the sink!

1066
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:38,450
In the sink, in the sink!

1067
00:54:46,259 --> 00:54:48,425
There, happy now?

1068
00:54:48,427 --> 00:54:49,826
Me?

1069
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,928
Maybe you better go
wash that off, honey.

1070
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,562
Stay out of this, Phil.

1071
00:54:57,568 --> 00:54:58,900
God.

1072
00:54:58,902 --> 00:55:01,302
I'm so sorry.

1073
00:55:01,304 --> 00:55:02,903
Yeah, why don't you go
to the bathroom,

1074
00:55:02,905 --> 00:55:04,604
collect yourself.

1075
00:55:04,606 --> 00:55:07,006
I, you're right, honey...

1076
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:09,808
It's okay, it's okay.

1077
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:10,909
You guys okay?

1078
00:55:10,911 --> 00:55:12,266
Yeah, yeah.

1079
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,622
Did you get anything on you?

1080
00:55:13,623 --> 00:55:14,978
No, I'm fine but,
is she all right?

1081
00:55:14,981 --> 00:55:17,580
Yeah, she's fine, she's fine.

1082
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:24,885
Who's Phil?

1083
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,690
Just give me a second.

1084
00:55:30,692 --> 00:55:34,360
Okay.

1085
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:35,627
What did you think
you were doing?

1086
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:37,028
I told you not to
come along anyway,

1087
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,029
I had everything under control.

1088
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:39,597
You had everything on fire!

1089
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,998
Yeah, well, that's
the way I like it.

1090
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,333
Sure, burned black,
tons of ketchup.

1091
00:55:43,335 --> 00:55:45,001
It's none of your business
what she eats,

1092
00:55:45,003 --> 00:55:46,969
you yuppie snob, that's my date.

1093
00:55:46,971 --> 00:55:49,571
Yeah, well, you know,
you sure know how to pick 'em.

1094
00:55:49,573 --> 00:55:51,306
What's the matter?

1095
00:55:51,308 --> 00:55:53,441
Are you jealous?

1096
00:55:53,443 --> 00:55:55,376
No, I'm not jealous!

1097
00:55:55,378 --> 00:55:56,543
Then butt out!

1098
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:59,379
Why don't you make me?

1099
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:00,446
Just make me.

1100
00:56:00,448 --> 00:56:01,613
You think I won't?

1101
00:56:01,615 --> 00:56:04,482
Yeah, sure, try.

1102
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:07,918
There.

1103
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,920
- That's all you got?
- Uhhuh.

1104
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:11,054
Stop it.

1105
00:56:11,056 --> 00:56:12,488
Did it again, did it again.

1106
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,389
Dylan, stop, stop it.

1107
00:56:14,391 --> 00:56:16,357
I won't, no, I'm not going to.

1108
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:17,658
I won't.

1109
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:21,461
Hey, Donna.

1110
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:22,728
Hey.

1111
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:26,031
I'm just putting on
some aftershave.

1112
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:27,699
Just freshening up a little.

1113
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:29,033
I'm gonna go.

1114
00:56:32,438 --> 00:56:33,470
Donna!

1115
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:37,706
Dylan?

1116
00:56:38,909 --> 00:56:42,644
Donna, wait!

1117
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:44,646
I was just making a joke.

1118
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:46,514
I was just

1119
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:48,415
putting on aftershave.

1120
00:57:07,536 --> 00:57:09,769
You are gonna speak to me again
before we die, right?

1121
00:57:09,771 --> 00:57:11,604
What do you want me
to say, Rebecca?

1122
00:57:11,606 --> 00:57:15,608
Thank you, I'm so glad you
made us look like idiots.

1123
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,743
You didn't even apologize
to Dr. Maynard.

1124
00:57:17,745 --> 00:57:19,511
I don't like
Dr. Maynard.

1125
00:57:19,513 --> 00:57:21,412
He always looks at me like he's
trying to guess my weight.

1126
00:57:21,414 --> 00:57:23,547
He was trying to raise money
for an important project

1127
00:57:23,549 --> 00:57:27,350
I happen to be involved with.

1128
00:57:27,352 --> 00:57:29,719
Phillip, I can't say
what happened.

1129
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:33,421
I think maybe I dozed off
for a second.

1130
00:57:34,023 --> 00:57:36,123
I was confused.

1131
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:37,124
Haven't you ever done that?

1132
00:57:37,126 --> 00:57:38,725
That's not it.

1133
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:41,861
I mean, that may be true, but...

1134
00:57:44,098 --> 00:57:47,632
Something is happening to you.

1135
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:50,568
And I don't know if it's
what happened before or not.

1136
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,570
It's not, believe me.

1137
00:57:52,572 --> 00:57:54,772
Okay, then what?

1138
00:57:54,774 --> 00:57:55,839
What?

1139
00:57:57,776 --> 00:58:00,109
I don't know, Phillip,
sometimes...

1140
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:05,580
Sometimes you just look
at everything

1141
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:09,084
and it's all just different.

1142
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,218
Do you know?

1143
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,252
Yeah, I do.

1144
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,720
They call that puberty.

1145
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,722
No, it isn't just then,
it never stops.

1146
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,558
It's like um...

1147
00:58:20,827 --> 00:58:23,761
Like shedding your skin.

1148
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,896
Is that what you're doing?

1149
00:58:27,832 --> 00:58:29,231
Shedding?

1150
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:33,567
Yeah, I guess, sort of.

1151
00:58:35,537 --> 00:58:37,603
Shedding me?

1152
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:41,907
No. No.

1153
01:00:05,922 --> 01:00:06,921
Hey.

1154
01:00:06,923 --> 01:00:08,656
Hi.

1155
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,227
I'm really sorry,
I know I messed it up,

1156
01:00:14,229 --> 01:00:15,161
I know...

1157
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:16,695
No, no, it's cool.

1158
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:18,730
I would have messed it up
myself anyway,

1159
01:00:18,732 --> 01:00:19,931
you just saved me time.

1160
01:00:19,933 --> 01:00:21,599
Give yourself a little credit.

1161
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:23,334
That girl really likes you.

1162
01:00:23,336 --> 01:00:25,769
Well, if she did I think
she got over that pretty quick

1163
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:27,036
when she caught me talking to
the little man

1164
01:00:27,038 --> 01:00:28,804
inside of my head.

1165
01:00:28,806 --> 01:00:30,205
Yeah.

1166
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,640
Right.

1167
01:00:33,809 --> 01:00:35,008
It's just sometimes
when I'm with you

1168
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:37,744
I forget myself.

1169
01:00:41,983 --> 01:00:44,316
You feel funny.

1170
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:45,150
What?

1171
01:00:45,152 --> 01:00:46,217
Don't you feel funny?

1172
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:49,787
Like, not, not a fever, but...

1173
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:53,390
I

1174
01:00:53,392 --> 01:00:55,892
I was previously engaged

1175
01:00:55,894 --> 01:00:58,628
in a certain kind of activity
and

1176
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,363
Nope... heh... um...

1177
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:06,701
Well, you smell nice.

1178
01:01:06,703 --> 01:01:08,369
Kinda sweaty.

1179
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:13,273
Sorry, that...

1180
01:01:13,275 --> 01:01:15,775
That was out of line,
I didn't

1181
01:01:17,745 --> 01:01:19,711
I should go.

1182
01:01:22,248 --> 01:01:23,313
Okay.

1183
01:01:23,315 --> 01:01:26,783
Um, look, I'm sorry
about tonight.

1184
01:01:26,785 --> 01:01:28,717
Yeah, me, too.

1185
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,855
Well, goodnight.

1186
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,389
Goodnight.

1187
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:39,125
Goodnight.

1188
01:01:40,828 --> 01:01:42,027
Goodnight.

1189
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,999
Goodnight.

1190
01:01:54,405 --> 01:01:56,872
Okay, well, wait,
here goes a good one.

1191
01:01:56,874 --> 01:01:57,956
Number seven,

1192
01:01:57,957 --> 01:01:59,039
how does your partner
rate as a lover?

1193
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:00,408
- Pass.
- No, wait!

1194
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:03,344
Pass, pass, pass,
that's none of your business.

1195
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:04,978
Of course it's my business,
hush up.

1196
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,781
You describe your lovemaking
as A, wild animals.

1197
01:02:08,783 --> 01:02:10,849
B, sweet and slow.

1198
01:02:10,851 --> 01:02:12,350
C, at least he tries.

1199
01:02:12,352 --> 01:02:13,718
D...

1200
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,785
Who's he talking to?

1201
01:02:14,787 --> 01:02:15,752
I don't know.

1202
01:02:15,754 --> 01:02:18,955
Um, B, A,

1203
01:02:18,957 --> 01:02:19,989
no, no.

1204
01:02:19,991 --> 01:02:21,090
Yeah.

1205
01:02:21,092 --> 01:02:22,057
B?

1206
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:24,726
Okay, if you say so.

1207
01:02:24,728 --> 01:02:26,694
Nine, how often
do you and your mate...

1208
01:02:26,696 --> 01:02:27,961
No, pass!

1209
01:02:27,963 --> 01:02:29,362
Why?
- Pass.

1210
01:02:29,364 --> 01:02:30,096
Come on, this isn't
gonna work unless...

1211
01:02:30,098 --> 01:02:31,897
Wait.

1212
01:02:31,899 --> 01:02:34,733
Turn up the radio.

1213
01:02:34,735 --> 01:02:37,035
You like this?

1214
01:02:37,037 --> 01:02:40,371
Yeah, I love this song.

1215
01:02:40,373 --> 01:02:43,006
Yeah, I remember this.

1216
01:03:29,845 --> 01:03:30,343
Hey.

1217
01:03:30,345 --> 01:03:32,478
Phillip.

1218
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,479
Hi.

1219
01:03:33,481 --> 01:03:36,815
Is this more shedding?

1220
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:38,883
No.

1221
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:40,818
This is dancing.

1222
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:43,954
Yeah, it is.

1223
01:03:43,956 --> 01:03:46,489
Okay, um...

1224
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:48,090
I'll see you.

1225
01:03:48,092 --> 01:03:50,058
So what brings
the party down here?

1226
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,795
I was just looking for
my old photo albums.

1227
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:55,029
I thought they were
in the corner.

1228
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,764
Yeah, yeah.

1229
01:03:56,766 --> 01:04:00,367
Last time I saw them
they were...

1230
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,836
God I hope Bridget
didn't throw them out.

1231
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:03,937
No, that doesn't make any sense,

1232
01:04:03,939 --> 01:04:04,938
she would have ask...

1233
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,372
Hey, I ran into Diane.

1234
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:09,541
She said you were gonna do
the painting class.

1235
01:04:09,543 --> 01:04:10,808
The drawing class.

1236
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:11,775
The drawing class, yeah.

1237
01:04:11,777 --> 01:04:13,042
Yeah, I don't have to.

1238
01:04:13,044 --> 01:04:14,977
What? No, I think
that's great.

1239
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:16,111
You know, get you out of your,

1240
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:18,512
the cellar.

1241
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,115
Why would Bridget
throw out my photos?

1242
01:04:23,117 --> 01:04:24,883
No, I'm not saying,
just, you know,

1243
01:04:24,885 --> 01:04:26,484
whatever, by accident.

1244
01:04:26,486 --> 01:04:28,052
What do you want with them?

1245
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:30,054
Nothing, I just wanted
to show them to D-,

1246
01:04:30,056 --> 01:04:33,891
to, to...

1247
01:04:33,893 --> 01:04:36,393
myself, look at them.

1248
01:04:36,395 --> 01:04:38,027
I'm not saying don't find them,

1249
01:04:38,029 --> 01:04:39,928
it's a healthy thing,
that's good.

1250
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:41,863
And I can help you
look for them.

1251
01:04:41,865 --> 01:04:45,833
I have my council meeting
at six but um,

1252
01:04:45,835 --> 01:04:48,101
you know, it won't kill me
to be a few minutes late.

1253
01:04:48,103 --> 01:04:49,535
Yes, it will.

1254
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:54,573
Thank you for knowing that
about me.

1255
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,245
Hey, is my gray shirt clean?

1256
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:02,479
Yeah, I'll check.

1257
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,881
Thank you.

1258
01:05:17,094 --> 01:05:19,260
Everything come out all right?

1259
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:23,563
You're drunk.

1260
01:05:23,565 --> 01:05:26,165
I ain't had hardly
nothing to drink.

1261
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:28,867
But give me time, partner.

1262
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:30,935
I got wine on my damn pants.

1263
01:05:31,837 --> 01:05:35,104
What's Phillip gonna think?

1264
01:05:35,106 --> 01:05:37,106
Where is ol' Phil?

1265
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:38,507
Meeting.

1266
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:42,844
Have I given you the tour
of my luxurious home?

1267
01:05:42,846 --> 01:05:44,145
Yeah, you have.

1268
01:05:44,147 --> 01:05:47,181
Elegant, modern
entertainment center.

1269
01:05:47,183 --> 01:05:49,583
The perfect addition
to every home.

1270
01:05:49,585 --> 01:05:51,451
Did you find those pictures
you were gonna show me?

1271
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:57,088
They're gone.

1272
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,523
Well, wait a minute,
what happened?

1273
01:05:59,525 --> 01:06:01,591
They're gone.

1274
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:06,094
I have been through the entire

1275
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:09,063
attractively furnished house.

1276
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,366
Maybe the maid ate them.

1277
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:13,334
Or maybe...

1278
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,703
my husband
slipped them into the trash.

1279
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:16,704
Are you serious?

1280
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,105
Why the hell would he do that?

1281
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,507
Because he knows me.

1282
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:23,709
Phillip takes care of me.

1283
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:26,678
That's not ta-,
that sucks.

1284
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,746
He's not being mean.

1285
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,583
He knows how funky
I get sometimes,

1286
01:06:33,585 --> 01:06:36,118
looking through that stuff.

1287
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,721
Doesn't matter anyway,
I know them all by heart.

1288
01:06:39,723 --> 01:06:42,690
There's my mom
when she's little.

1289
01:06:42,692 --> 01:06:44,658
She has my eyes.

1290
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:47,394
Blue-gray with flecks
of panic.

1291
01:06:47,396 --> 01:06:50,130
And here's Mom teaching me
how to swim.

1292
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:54,733
Notice how I'm grafted
to her arm.

1293
01:06:54,735 --> 01:06:57,368
Not a success.

1294
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:00,771
And there's a picture of a pony.

1295
01:07:00,773 --> 01:07:02,105
I don't know why it's in there

1296
01:07:02,107 --> 01:07:03,072
or who it belonged to,

1297
01:07:03,074 --> 01:07:06,275
but there it is anyway.

1298
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:10,378
And there's my dad.

1299
01:07:11,748 --> 01:07:14,682
Scariest man who ever lived.

1300
01:07:16,185 --> 01:07:19,252
Grown ups were scared of him.

1301
01:07:20,054 --> 01:07:24,022
All they ever taught me
was how to be afraid.

1302
01:07:24,024 --> 01:07:27,091
And I went out and found
the copingest man alive

1303
01:07:28,227 --> 01:07:31,761
so he could take care of me.

1304
01:07:31,763 --> 01:07:35,197
So he could get rid of the past.

1305
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:37,132
Chipping away at it.

1306
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:42,602
All my little quirks
and insecurities.

1307
01:07:43,705 --> 01:07:45,705
Until...

1308
01:07:46,808 --> 01:07:49,375
<i>voila.</i>

1309
01:07:49,377 --> 01:07:51,176
Nothing left.

1310
01:07:57,383 --> 01:07:58,582
Ha.

1311
01:08:02,254 --> 01:08:05,321
Nothing like a little truth
to sober you up?

1312
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:11,293
I'll tell you about my family,

1313
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:15,096
I got a brother named Mitch.

1314
01:08:15,098 --> 01:08:16,297
I think he lives down
in Louisville now,

1315
01:08:16,299 --> 01:08:18,799
moved 1500 miles away so that

1316
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:22,269
he wouldn't have to
loan me any more money.

1317
01:08:22,271 --> 01:08:24,471
My momma just,

1318
01:08:24,473 --> 01:08:26,172
I put her through so much,

1319
01:08:26,174 --> 01:08:30,176
by the time I got popped
she stopped talking to me.

1320
01:08:30,178 --> 01:08:32,378
She didn't even wait
for the trial.

1321
01:08:34,415 --> 01:08:37,482
I never met anyone
I didn't disappoint.

1322
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,153
I mean, the best thing,

1323
01:08:42,155 --> 01:08:45,789
the only thing about me
that I like

1324
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:48,524
is you.

1325
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:27,225
Fuck.

1326
01:09:27,227 --> 01:09:30,294
I wish you weren't
so damn pretty, Becky Porter.

1327
01:09:32,765 --> 01:09:35,332
I know it's dumb
and shallow and,

1328
01:09:35,334 --> 01:09:36,466
I mean you're a married woman

1329
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:40,369
and I'm on parole.

1330
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:43,271
Still, sometimes I think...

1331
01:09:46,142 --> 01:09:47,508
Just wish you weren't
so damn pretty.

1332
01:10:22,506 --> 01:10:26,508
I wanna know what you feel like.

1333
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:25,276
Cut it out, it's good.

1334
01:12:25,278 --> 01:12:26,343
It's cool!

1335
01:12:26,345 --> 01:12:27,577
Look at Diane's.

1336
01:12:30,815 --> 01:12:32,881
That's a little abstract
there, darling.

1337
01:12:32,883 --> 01:12:34,349
Try drawing the nice man.

1338
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,891
Dylan, my office.

1339
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:46,425
Gotta go, darling.

1340
01:12:46,427 --> 01:12:48,393
Okay, I'll see you.

1341
01:12:51,364 --> 01:12:53,897
What's going on, Jake?

1342
01:12:53,899 --> 01:12:56,366
It's no good.

1343
01:12:56,368 --> 01:12:57,500
What is?

1344
01:12:57,502 --> 01:12:59,435
It's no good.

1345
01:12:59,437 --> 01:13:00,502
It doesn't work.

1346
01:13:00,504 --> 01:13:03,404
Wait, wait, am I fired?

1347
01:13:03,406 --> 01:13:06,507
Okay, you're me, Dylan, okay?

1348
01:13:06,509 --> 01:13:08,075
What would you do?

1349
01:13:08,077 --> 01:13:11,644
Keep the ex con
who talks to himself all day?

1350
01:13:14,548 --> 01:13:17,649
You frighten the customers.

1351
01:13:17,651 --> 01:13:19,751
Look, next time you
get a gig, okay,

1352
01:13:19,753 --> 01:13:23,721
just let your imaginary friend
stay at home.

1353
01:13:23,723 --> 01:13:25,422
Okay.

1354
01:13:25,424 --> 01:13:27,457
You gotta start living
in the world, brother.

1355
01:13:27,459 --> 01:13:30,059
You gotta be where you at.

1356
01:13:30,061 --> 01:13:31,060
You understand what I'm saying?

1357
01:13:31,062 --> 01:13:31,760
Be where you at.

1358
01:13:31,762 --> 01:13:33,461
Okay.

1359
01:13:33,463 --> 01:13:36,330
I'll give you a recommendation
if you need one.

1360
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:38,532
I won't lie.

1361
01:13:38,534 --> 01:13:42,502
But I-,
I'll say you were honest.

1362
01:13:42,504 --> 01:13:43,436
Th...

1363
01:14:02,723 --> 01:14:04,022
What happened, bro?

1364
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:27,043
Hon, I'm your friend.

1365
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:28,411
Good.

1366
01:14:28,413 --> 01:14:31,113
I mean, yes, of course you are.

1367
01:14:31,115 --> 01:14:32,647
You can tell me.

1368
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:34,015
You really should.

1369
01:14:34,017 --> 01:14:35,383
Sweetie, I honestly,

1370
01:14:35,385 --> 01:14:38,119
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1371
01:14:38,121 --> 01:14:40,621
Not at all?

1372
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:44,458
Everybody's concerned.

1373
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,493
Is something going on?

1374
01:14:46,495 --> 01:14:49,496
You can tell me.

1375
01:14:49,498 --> 01:14:51,965
There's just really
nothing to tell.

1376
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:54,733
Have you been seeing someone?

1377
01:14:54,735 --> 01:14:55,600
God, no.

1378
01:14:55,602 --> 01:14:57,001
No, no, no, no, no.

1379
01:14:57,003 --> 01:14:59,670
I couldn't, I'm married,
I would never.

1380
01:14:59,672 --> 01:15:02,606
I meant a shrink.

1381
01:15:02,608 --> 01:15:04,074
You're having an affair,
my God.

1382
01:15:04,076 --> 01:15:05,742
No, no, no.

1383
01:15:05,744 --> 01:15:07,110
You don't have to tell me who
unless you want to

1384
01:15:07,112 --> 01:15:08,811
because I'm very good
at keeping...

1385
01:15:08,813 --> 01:15:10,579
Diane, I'm not,
I'm not having an affair.

1386
01:15:10,581 --> 01:15:12,714
And we never had
this conversation.

1387
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:14,549
Poor Phillip.

1388
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:15,950
I didn't mean that.

1389
01:15:15,952 --> 01:15:17,651
You know, you don't have to
tell me who,

1390
01:15:17,653 --> 01:15:20,754
that just explains everything.

1391
01:15:20,756 --> 01:15:22,588
Explains what?

1392
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:26,858
Well, I don't mind telling you

1393
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,026
now that I know
you're not crazy,

1394
01:15:29,028 --> 01:15:31,461
but everybody's talking.

1395
01:15:31,463 --> 01:15:34,096
Well, you must know that.

1396
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:35,797
Everybody's talking about me.

1397
01:15:35,799 --> 01:15:37,165
Why?

1398
01:15:37,167 --> 01:15:38,432
Don't they have lives?

1399
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:39,800
My lips are sealed.

1400
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:41,768
They are zip locked.

1401
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,169
You don't have to tell me
who he is,

1402
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:44,803
but is it someone I know...

1403
01:15:44,805 --> 01:15:46,805
Diane, honestly,
I'm not having an affair,

1404
01:15:46,807 --> 01:15:47,906
I'm not, I swear.

1405
01:15:47,908 --> 01:15:48,806
Okay?

1406
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:50,707
I'm just crazy.

1407
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,549
Amazing!

1408
01:16:01,551 --> 01:16:04,685
This is possibly the greatest
game of pool ever played.

1409
01:16:04,687 --> 01:16:05,886
Hi, Dylan.

1410
01:16:05,888 --> 01:16:07,687
Hey, queen of the rodeo.

1411
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:09,221
Rodeo queen?

1412
01:16:09,223 --> 01:16:11,656
What'd, you come to watch me
make pool history?

1413
01:16:14,627 --> 01:16:15,859
Had a few pitchers, haven't you?

1414
01:16:15,861 --> 01:16:17,327
My only regret

1415
01:16:17,329 --> 01:16:18,328
is that I gave up my law
practice

1416
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:21,297
to become a showgirl.

1417
01:16:21,299 --> 01:16:22,331
Can I pour myself one?

1418
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,766
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1419
01:16:24,768 --> 01:16:26,768
Hey, hey, hey, have a beer.

1420
01:16:30,774 --> 01:16:33,307
I'm just gonna find this ball.

1421
01:16:33,309 --> 01:16:36,843
So Wayne says that Jake
gave you the can.

1422
01:16:36,845 --> 01:16:37,743
That blows.

1423
01:16:37,745 --> 01:16:39,644
Don't it, sister?

1424
01:16:39,646 --> 01:16:41,646
Where the hell you been
hiding at, Dyl Pickle?

1425
01:16:41,648 --> 01:16:43,614
Thank God, you've come.

1426
01:16:45,884 --> 01:16:47,524
Is it time to do crimes?

1427
01:16:50,354 --> 01:16:54,356
Yeah, man,
we been waiting on ya.

1428
01:16:54,358 --> 01:16:55,623
Cue ball.

1429
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:56,724
Enough dicking around.

1430
01:16:56,726 --> 01:16:57,691
Are we doing this or not?

1431
01:16:57,693 --> 01:16:59,726
Hell yes, let's do it.

1432
01:16:59,728 --> 01:17:00,960
Let's do it.

1433
01:17:00,962 --> 01:17:02,594
All right, here's the address.

1434
01:17:02,596 --> 01:17:03,995
Need you to roll up there,
check the place out.

1435
01:17:03,997 --> 01:17:06,364
We go in Thursday night.

1436
01:17:06,366 --> 01:17:07,932
Let's do it now.

1437
01:17:07,934 --> 01:17:09,233
Let's do it now, I mean,

1438
01:17:09,235 --> 01:17:10,133
what am I waiting for, right?

1439
01:17:10,135 --> 01:17:11,801
This is what I do.

1440
01:17:11,803 --> 01:17:14,637
I mean, I'm a criminal element
man type, man.

1441
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:15,704
Just like you.

1442
01:17:15,706 --> 01:17:17,338
Like, who am I kidding?

1443
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,939
Maybe you've had enough, Dyl.

1444
01:17:18,941 --> 01:17:20,941
Maybe you wanna head home,
sleep it off.

1445
01:17:20,943 --> 01:17:22,943
No, I want some action!

1446
01:17:22,945 --> 01:17:24,678
I want some Action Jackson!

1447
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,781
Come on, let's get lost.

1448
01:17:27,783 --> 01:17:29,849
Hey, you can be my moll.

1449
01:17:29,851 --> 01:17:30,983
Yeah.

1450
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:33,017
I mean, I gotta have a moll.

1451
01:17:36,055 --> 01:17:39,322
See, I got this problem, y'all.

1452
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:40,790
It's the Jiminy the Cricket
is gonna get

1453
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:42,324
all upset with me, man,

1454
01:17:42,326 --> 01:17:44,626
and I can't go messing with
Jiminy the Cricket.

1455
01:17:44,628 --> 01:17:45,893
He lives in my head
with Mr. Cr-,

1456
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:48,962
excuse me,
Dr. Cricket.

1457
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,797
And what am I gonna do
when she finds out

1458
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:52,365
that I'm just like
everybody said?

1459
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:54,233
What am I gonna do then, Bo?

1460
01:17:54,235 --> 01:17:55,400
You got voices in your head?

1461
01:17:55,402 --> 01:17:56,801
Is that what you're saying?

1462
01:17:56,803 --> 01:17:57,768
You don't believe me?

1463
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:59,202
- Donna?
- He does.

1464
01:17:59,204 --> 01:18:01,671
Yeah, I have a world
of craziness up here, man.

1465
01:18:01,673 --> 01:18:03,839
So you might wanna find
somebody a little more stable

1466
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:04,739
to be your wire man.

1467
01:18:04,741 --> 01:18:06,407
Maybe I'm not your guy.

1468
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:07,307
I mean, burglary is
a pretty tricky

1469
01:18:07,309 --> 01:18:08,908
piece of business.

1470
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:10,209
It's time to shut your mouth
now, Dyl.

1471
01:18:10,211 --> 01:18:11,376
You know what,
I'm getting so sick

1472
01:18:11,378 --> 01:18:13,678
of everybody telling me
what to do.

1473
01:18:17,383 --> 01:18:19,783
All right, step back Dylan,
just step back.

1474
01:18:19,785 --> 01:18:22,352
You two, get the hell
out of my bar.

1475
01:18:22,354 --> 01:18:24,253
All right, Wayne,
put the gun down.

1476
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,954
Okay, Wayne.

1477
01:18:25,956 --> 01:18:27,422
Man, I got a lump on
my head the size of Nebraska.

1478
01:18:27,424 --> 01:18:28,990
Shut up Lyle, shut up,
it's okay,

1479
01:18:28,992 --> 01:18:29,857
everything's fine.

1480
01:18:29,859 --> 01:18:30,791
Am I bleeding there?

1481
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:31,391
Everything's fine.

1482
01:18:31,393 --> 01:18:34,927
Shut up, Lyle.

1483
01:18:34,929 --> 01:18:38,363
I don't care how long
we known each other.

1484
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:40,998
You screw this up...

1485
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,999
Bo, look at my hair, man.

1486
01:18:42,001 --> 01:18:43,934
Am I bleeding?

1487
01:18:43,936 --> 01:18:46,870
Bo, my head's gonna be
all discolored.

1488
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:29,777
Diane.

1489
01:19:29,779 --> 01:19:32,479
Hi, I just got the call
that you were here.

1490
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:35,315
To what do I owe
this pleasant surprise?

1491
01:19:40,488 --> 01:19:42,020
What?

1492
01:20:15,354 --> 01:20:17,454
Do you recognize it?

1493
01:20:24,162 --> 01:20:26,362
That doesn't even
look any smaller.

1494
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:28,430
I never came here again.

1495
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,033
I was scared.

1496
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:34,902
I just felt like

1497
01:20:34,904 --> 01:20:38,472
there was something here.

1498
01:20:38,474 --> 01:20:41,808
Something too grown up.

1499
01:20:42,544 --> 01:20:44,477
Too real.

1500
01:20:46,514 --> 01:20:48,480
Do you think this is
the place I first went nuts

1501
01:20:48,482 --> 01:20:50,548
or does it go further back?

1502
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:52,182
Come on, you're not crazy,
Becky.

1503
01:20:52,184 --> 01:20:54,851
I was once.

1504
01:20:54,853 --> 01:20:57,186
Right after college.

1505
01:20:57,188 --> 01:20:59,787
Before Phillip and I
were engaged.

1506
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:04,357
I...

1507
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:08,227
Kind of fell apart.

1508
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:10,429
Couldn't deal with
being in the world

1509
01:21:10,431 --> 01:21:15,300
so I spent some time
in a hospital upstate.

1510
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:19,570
Rehabilitating.

1511
01:21:21,941 --> 01:21:23,006
I didn't know about that.

1512
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:26,476
Yeah, you missed that one.

1513
01:21:26,478 --> 01:21:30,480
Probably because I
missed most of it, too.

1514
01:21:30,482 --> 01:21:33,249
I couldn't feel anything.

1515
01:21:33,251 --> 01:21:36,118
I'd just lay in bed
for three months

1516
01:21:37,454 --> 01:21:40,154
trying to work up
enough energy to cry.

1517
01:21:44,426 --> 01:21:46,459
Phillip was with me
through all of it,

1518
01:21:46,461 --> 01:21:50,095
he read to me, he sat with me.

1519
01:21:51,898 --> 01:21:55,499
Tried to get me through it.

1520
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:57,566
He probably did.

1521
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:02,202
Sure wasn't me.

1522
01:22:04,539 --> 01:22:06,238
So goddamn weak.

1523
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,473
Becky, how can you say that?

1524
01:22:08,475 --> 01:22:10,508
I mean, what you did for me?

1525
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:14,478
Have I made your life
any easier, honestly?

1526
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,612
Yes.

1527
01:22:20,051 --> 01:22:22,918
You know, I can't
read your mind, Dylan,

1528
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,021
but I know when you're lying.

1529
01:22:26,023 --> 01:22:27,155
Becky, don't do this.

1530
01:22:27,157 --> 01:22:30,057
I can't live like this.

1531
01:22:30,059 --> 01:22:32,626
Dylan,

1532
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:35,962
Phillip is my husband.

1533
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:38,230
I know you don't like him,

1534
01:22:38,232 --> 01:22:41,066
but I need to be with him.

1535
01:22:41,068 --> 01:22:42,867
I need to find him again.

1536
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:44,969
Yeah, you gotta do
what you're told, right?

1537
01:22:44,971 --> 01:22:46,003
That's not fair.

1538
01:22:46,005 --> 01:22:47,604
Fair?

1539
01:22:47,606 --> 01:22:50,006
I finally for once in my life,

1540
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:53,175
I could see something,
something real

1541
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,910
and then you tell me
I gotta give it up,

1542
01:22:54,912 --> 01:22:58,213
so how do you come at fair?

1543
01:22:58,215 --> 01:23:02,083
I can't be with you and I...

1544
01:23:02,085 --> 01:23:04,452
I can't play at this anymore.

1545
01:23:04,454 --> 01:23:05,886
It's not a game,

1546
01:23:05,888 --> 01:23:07,621
it's not something
that you play.

1547
01:23:07,623 --> 01:23:10,190
What am I supposed to do?

1548
01:23:10,192 --> 01:23:13,593
You are going to be fine.

1549
01:23:13,595 --> 01:23:16,094
God, Dylan.

1550
01:23:18,331 --> 01:23:20,497
You have so much.

1551
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:25,501
You...

1552
01:23:25,503 --> 01:23:29,104
You blew me away.

1553
01:23:29,106 --> 01:23:32,040
You know that, you...

1554
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:34,108
I'm never gonna forget that.

1555
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,309
Couldn't we just...

1556
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:36,376
No.

1557
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,246
How do you expect me to
just shut you off?

1558
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:46,383
Because you love me.

1559
01:25:20,308 --> 01:25:22,374
Give me a whiskey neat, please.

1560
01:25:22,376 --> 01:25:24,309
The thing is you come in here

1561
01:25:24,311 --> 01:25:26,810
and there's always
some kind of trouble.

1562
01:25:29,548 --> 01:25:31,581
Is that what you hear?

1563
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:33,282
Not too nicely, though,

1564
01:25:33,284 --> 01:25:35,384
you were in here doing your
little MMA style tango

1565
01:25:35,386 --> 01:25:36,718
with the Soames brothers.

1566
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,453
They showed up, I left.

1567
01:25:38,455 --> 01:25:39,854
We didn't associate.

1568
01:25:39,856 --> 01:25:42,790
Dylan, this ain't
a goddamn drill, okay?

1569
01:25:42,792 --> 01:25:44,324
You went and got yourself fired,

1570
01:25:44,326 --> 01:25:45,591
you're hanging out
with known felons

1571
01:25:45,593 --> 01:25:47,426
and now Lyle is looking
to bust your ass...

1572
01:25:47,428 --> 01:25:49,728
Giddons, look can you...?

1573
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,362
No!

1574
01:25:51,364 --> 01:25:54,131
No, no.

1575
01:25:54,133 --> 01:25:56,833
No, no!

1576
01:25:56,835 --> 01:25:57,834
Please, no.

1577
01:25:57,836 --> 01:25:59,202
What's wrong with you?

1578
01:25:59,204 --> 01:26:01,337
Please!

1579
01:26:10,447 --> 01:26:11,546
Dylan.

1580
01:26:11,548 --> 01:26:13,147
Dylan!

1581
01:26:15,151 --> 01:26:16,283
What the hell's wrong with you?

1582
01:26:16,285 --> 01:26:17,317
Those bastards!

1583
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:19,519
Who, Bo and Lyle?

1584
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:20,887
You know what I'm
looking at right now?

1585
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:22,688
A cell.

1586
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:24,289
Hey, you tell me what's
going on with them brothers

1587
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:25,757
you won't even have to
think about that.

1588
01:26:25,759 --> 01:26:27,792
No, I mean I'm looking
at it right now,

1589
01:26:27,794 --> 01:26:28,726
I'm in it.

1590
01:26:28,728 --> 01:26:29,693
What?

1591
01:26:29,695 --> 01:26:31,194
This is where they put me,

1592
01:26:31,196 --> 01:26:32,528
'cause this is where
they see me.

1593
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:34,229
What, wait a minute.

1594
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,331
So this is when you start
blaming the whole world

1595
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:37,498
for your crap, is that right?

1596
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,166
No, no, this is where I stop.

1597
01:26:43,304 --> 01:26:44,903
We ain't finished.

1598
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:54,178
I want you to get better.

1599
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,913
To stop...

1600
01:26:57,249 --> 01:27:00,183
worrying about everything.

1601
01:27:00,185 --> 01:27:02,185
Everything's gonna be fine.

1602
01:27:04,389 --> 01:27:07,890
You just need to be

1603
01:27:07,892 --> 01:27:09,458
alone for a while.

1604
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,927
No distractions.

1605
01:27:11,929 --> 01:27:14,930
Till you feel yourself again.

1606
01:27:26,977 --> 01:27:28,576
Rebecca.

1607
01:27:29,312 --> 01:27:31,345
I love you.

1608
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,542
Fuck.

1609
01:28:06,713 --> 01:28:07,912
Hey.

1610
01:28:07,914 --> 01:28:11,582
Now we both got lumps
on our heads.

1611
01:28:11,584 --> 01:28:13,350
It's Thursday!

1612
01:28:13,352 --> 01:28:14,884
Time to go to work, Dyl.

1613
01:28:14,886 --> 01:28:15,885
I gotta be somewhere.

1614
01:28:15,887 --> 01:28:18,387
Yeah, and we know where.

1615
01:28:18,389 --> 01:28:20,355
You know, I told Bo

1616
01:28:20,357 --> 01:28:21,589
that we should bust you up
and leave you there

1617
01:28:21,591 --> 01:28:22,656
when we're through,

1618
01:28:22,658 --> 01:28:23,990
but he's got a code.

1619
01:28:23,992 --> 01:28:26,425
Two hours
and comfortable living, Dyl.

1620
01:28:26,427 --> 01:28:28,593
No, I need to be somewhere,
I'm asking.

1621
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:30,428
And I'm answering.

1622
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,279
We'll worry about forms later.

1623
01:28:50,281 --> 01:28:53,015
None of your people will
even know she was here.

1624
01:28:53,017 --> 01:28:54,383
I'm betting she'll be
back to normal

1625
01:28:54,385 --> 01:28:56,685
in just a couple of months.

1626
01:28:56,687 --> 01:28:58,286
Maybe.

1627
01:29:16,638 --> 01:29:19,705
Did you see who was
driving that car?

1628
01:29:19,707 --> 01:29:21,339
Okay.

1629
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:38,723
Becca.

1630
01:29:38,724 --> 01:29:40,057
We are
currently

1631
01:29:40,059 --> 01:29:41,324
at a cruising altitude of...

1632
01:29:41,326 --> 01:29:43,059
Becca.

1633
01:29:45,096 --> 01:29:48,097
Can you hear me?

1634
01:29:48,099 --> 01:29:50,499
Come on, answer me, Rebecca.

1635
01:29:52,336 --> 01:29:53,735
Dylan.

1636
01:29:54,971 --> 01:29:56,070
Jesus Christ.

1637
01:29:56,072 --> 01:29:58,338
Rebecca, what is going on?

1638
01:29:59,674 --> 01:30:02,941
Phillip put me in here.

1639
01:30:02,943 --> 01:30:05,410
I think he thinks
I'm having an affair.

1640
01:30:05,412 --> 01:30:07,412
So he locks you up?

1641
01:30:07,414 --> 01:30:08,980
Can he do that?

1642
01:30:08,982 --> 01:30:12,116
I don't know.

1643
01:30:12,118 --> 01:30:14,084
I'm afraid of him.

1644
01:30:14,086 --> 01:30:16,619
I don't know what he's gonna do.

1645
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:18,687
God, you feel like
you're underwater.

1646
01:30:18,689 --> 01:30:20,388
What are they giving you?

1647
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:22,690
Phillip gave me these pills.

1648
01:30:22,692 --> 01:30:23,891
I took them.

1649
01:30:23,893 --> 01:30:27,060
He told me to take them
so I took them.

1650
01:30:27,062 --> 01:30:29,095
Don't you know where you are?

1651
01:30:29,097 --> 01:30:31,097
Yeah, I'm in the um...

1652
01:30:31,999 --> 01:30:34,432
I think it's the um,

1653
01:30:34,434 --> 01:30:36,700
Hophauer Clinic.

1654
01:30:36,702 --> 01:30:38,535
It's a mental institution.

1655
01:30:38,537 --> 01:30:41,504
Your husband oughtta be
a permanent resident, darling.

1656
01:30:41,506 --> 01:30:43,138
Once again,
we do request...

1657
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:44,772
You're in a plane?

1658
01:30:44,774 --> 01:30:47,908
I'm, I'm headed your way.

1659
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:54,147
Listen, I need to see the room.

1660
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:56,716
I want you to look around,
I wanna see everything.

1661
01:31:09,129 --> 01:31:10,595
Is there anything
you can do or...

1662
01:31:10,597 --> 01:31:12,496
I understand, Sir,
but unfortunately

1663
01:31:12,498 --> 01:31:13,797
we cannot rent you a vehicle

1664
01:31:13,799 --> 01:31:15,532
without a valid
driver's license.

1665
01:31:15,534 --> 01:31:17,433
I just, I just don't
have it with me

1666
01:31:17,435 --> 01:31:19,468
right now is all and I have
a real important job interview.

1667
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:21,703
And I do hope you get that job.

1668
01:31:21,705 --> 01:31:23,805
What I can do is
arrange a cab for you.

1669
01:31:23,807 --> 01:31:25,473
Perhaps a friend can
overnight your license

1670
01:31:25,475 --> 01:31:26,841
while I hold the res...

1671
01:31:26,843 --> 01:31:28,042
Sir?

1672
01:31:28,044 --> 01:31:30,010
Thanks.

1673
01:31:56,771 --> 01:31:58,036
Where are you?

1674
01:31:58,038 --> 01:32:00,671
Still at the airport.

1675
01:32:00,673 --> 01:32:03,740
What are you doing?

1676
01:32:03,742 --> 01:32:05,108
Renting.

1677
01:32:07,178 --> 01:32:08,777
Hey, you, stop!

1678
01:32:18,555 --> 01:32:21,222
Now twist it to the left.

1679
01:32:21,224 --> 01:32:23,591
Slowly.

1680
01:32:23,593 --> 01:32:26,660
Okay, now see if you can
find the empty space in there.

1681
01:32:27,763 --> 01:32:30,196
I can't do this,
I feel like a four year old.

1682
01:32:30,198 --> 01:32:32,531
You can do it, just relax.

1683
01:32:32,533 --> 01:32:35,534
This ain't Fort Knox,
these are simple locks.

1684
01:32:35,536 --> 01:32:37,469
Um, turn here.

1685
01:32:38,872 --> 01:32:41,472
Where did you learn to do
all this stuff anyway?

1686
01:32:41,474 --> 01:32:44,174
Um, school mostly.

1687
01:32:44,176 --> 01:32:46,709
I always wondered what
you guys did in shop.

1688
01:32:46,711 --> 01:32:48,510
I bet you took ballet?

1689
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:51,246
Or tea appreciation
or something.

1690
01:32:51,248 --> 01:32:52,513
Oboe.

1691
01:32:53,048 --> 01:32:54,914
Haha

1692
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:56,882
Holy shit, holy shit.

1693
01:32:56,884 --> 01:32:59,818
Hot damn, that took me
a week to learn that!

1694
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,619
You're a natural born criminal.

1695
01:33:01,621 --> 01:33:04,555
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

1696
01:33:05,758 --> 01:33:06,656
Am I close?

1697
01:33:06,658 --> 01:33:08,107
Yeah, I think so.

1698
01:33:08,108 --> 01:33:09,557
Just keep going
all the way through town.

1699
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,759
It's right by the train tracks,

1700
01:33:10,761 --> 01:33:12,828
you can't miss it.

1701
01:33:12,829 --> 01:33:14,896
Okay, I'll find it,
time to get a move on now.

1702
01:33:14,898 --> 01:33:17,198
Anybody in the hall?

1703
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,934
Um, wait a sec.

1704
01:33:21,604 --> 01:33:23,670
Wait till she leaves the hall.

1705
01:33:26,708 --> 01:33:27,773
Check.

1706
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:30,575
Nervous?

1707
01:33:30,577 --> 01:33:31,709
Check.

1708
01:33:31,711 --> 01:33:34,778
Listen, when you
get out of there, um,

1709
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,846
you ever seen Canada?

1710
01:33:37,748 --> 01:33:39,247
Why, what did you have in mind?

1711
01:33:39,249 --> 01:33:41,515
I thought maybe you'd like
to have a romance

1712
01:33:41,517 --> 01:33:43,583
in an exotic setting.

1713
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:50,039
Go for it,

1714
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,189
just walk like
you know where you're going.

1715
01:34:22,654 --> 01:34:24,186
Shit.

1716
01:34:41,704 --> 01:34:43,270
Do you have any idea where I am?

1717
01:34:49,077 --> 01:34:51,343
No, get back on Main Street.

1718
01:34:55,415 --> 01:34:59,049
Not a good idea.

1719
01:34:59,051 --> 01:35:00,917
Shit.

1720
01:35:00,919 --> 01:35:03,399
Police loudspeaker: Turn off the
engine and show me your hands.

1721
01:35:04,322 --> 01:35:06,055
How are you doing today?

1722
01:35:13,763 --> 01:35:15,229
Dylan: Here goes nothing.

1723
01:35:17,966 --> 01:35:19,899
Police loudspeaker: Stop the
car.

1724
01:36:44,278 --> 01:36:46,211
Becky: My God.

1725
01:36:47,981 --> 01:36:49,380
My God.

1726
01:36:50,516 --> 01:36:52,148
Dylan, I can't
talk to him, I can't.

1727
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:54,416
Becky, calm down,
you can do this.

1728
01:36:54,418 --> 01:36:57,385
Okay, okay.

1729
01:36:57,387 --> 01:37:00,020
I'm just gonna walk past him,
it's gonna be totally fine.

1730
01:37:04,092 --> 01:37:05,224
Rebecca?

1731
01:37:05,226 --> 01:37:07,392
What are you doing?

1732
01:37:08,528 --> 01:37:10,227
Told you I couldn't talk to him.

1733
01:37:10,229 --> 01:37:11,528
Go, Becky, just go.

1734
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:12,428
Phillip.

1735
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:13,028
Call security.

1736
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:14,095
Rebecca!

1737
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:26,004
He's gone.

1738
01:37:38,918 --> 01:37:39,983
The woods.

1739
01:37:40,318 --> 01:37:42,017
The woods, go!

1740
01:38:19,121 --> 01:38:20,053
Hear that train?

1741
01:38:20,055 --> 01:38:21,054
Yes.

1742
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,522
Run for it!

1743
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:44,275
Dylan: I'm here.

1744
01:38:44,277 --> 01:38:45,276
Where?

1745
01:38:48,414 --> 01:38:49,946
Where?

1746
01:38:53,951 --> 01:38:55,317
Where?

1747
01:38:55,319 --> 01:38:56,584
Dylan: Here.

1748
01:39:08,296 --> 01:39:11,130
There's an open boxcar, see it?

1749
01:39:11,132 --> 01:39:12,131
Where?

1750
01:39:12,133 --> 01:39:13,665
This red boxcar right here.

1751
01:39:13,667 --> 01:39:15,600
Red boxcar, see it?

1752
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:18,135
Yes!

1753
01:39:18,137 --> 01:39:19,669
Okay, go!

1754
01:40:54,327 --> 01:40:57,161
This is gonna be so weird.
