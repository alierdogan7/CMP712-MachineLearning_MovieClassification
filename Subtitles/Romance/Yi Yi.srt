1
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,335
Thank you.
Dear sister and brother-in-law.

2
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,467
From here on in, it's your show.

3
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,540
Isn't it our turn for photos?

4
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,545
Yang-Yang!

5
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,543
Where are the kids?

6
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,488
Grandma.

7
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,495
Look.

8
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,500
It was on the tree.

9
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,504
Anything wrong?

10
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,497
You know that strange woman?

11
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,504
Can I help you, Miss?

12
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,540
May I ask who?

13
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,508
Mind your own business!

14
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,476
Yun-Yun!

15
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,513
Ting-Ting.

16
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,518
You look so pretty today!

17
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,526
Where's your grandma?

18
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,471
I'm so sorry!

19
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,500
Marrying your son today!
It should have been me.

20
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,212
Yun-Yun! Come along now.

21
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,506
I let you down, I'm so sorry.

22
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,483
I'm not worthy of you!
It breaks my heart.

23
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,253
Don't push me around!

24
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,482
It's not that bad!

25
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,486
Where is she?

26
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,496
Where is that pregnant bitch?

27
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,467
Dad, Grandma wants to go home.

28
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:36,344
Go home?

29
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,469
She doesn't feel well.

30
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,469
And tonight?

31
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,442
Where's XiaoYan?

32
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,484
Show your face, XiaoYan!

33
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,451
Give A-Di back to me!

34
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:54,865
For this!
You'll face retribution.

35
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,502
Sorry about the mess.
We're the Jiangs... I'm Lili.

36
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,539
I'm Ting-Ting.

37
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,503
This is my grandma.

38
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:11,871
We're the Jians.

39
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,504
See you later, bye!

40
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,486
Ting-Ting!

41
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,450
Take out the garbage before
we go. It's starting to smell.

42
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,320
I'm doing it.

43
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,493
I'll do the rest tomorrow.

44
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,494
There's some on the balcony.

45
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:06,455
I know.

46
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,501
What was I getting?

47
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,490
How did you find me?

48
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,491
Followed the removal men.

49
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,452
Mother will be livid!

50
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,485
I miss you!

51
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,494
Don't I call you?

52
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,495
Can't see you on the phone.

53
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,493
Come.

54
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,489
Sorry, I'm in the middle of
moving house.

55
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,493
It's a huge mess!

56
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,329
Call me on this mobile number.

57
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,494
I'll have a phone-line
in tomorrow.

58
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:20,528
Really?

59
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,510
Okay, no problem.

60
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,502
Good-bye.

61
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,522
Ready, Ting-Ting?

62
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,469
What's on your mind?

63
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,505
I feel sorry for Yun-Yun.

64
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:04,546
If it's not Uncle's fault,
it must be Xiao Yan's.

65
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,518
Don't say that,
we hardly know her.

66
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,521
I think Grandma's right,
we can't accept her.

67
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,350
Did Grandma say that?

68
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,462
No, but she's been unhappy
all day.

69
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,459
Did she say anything else?

70
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,465
No, but she said she feels
really old.

71
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,461
What does she mean by that?

72
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,475
The groom is right behind me!

73
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,512
Put your hands together!

74
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:43,487
NJ.

75
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,488
Your wife's brother is some guy!

76
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,489
Not many weddings with the bride
so very pregnant!

77
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,492
That's the way he is!

78
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,494
He put off the wedding for
months...

79
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,467
because this is the luckiest day
of the year in the almanac.

80
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,468
Take his shoe!

81
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,475
Don't mess with girls!

82
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,514
Pregnant brides aren't unusual
these days.

83
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,549
We had "bus rides without tickets"
in our day too, you know.

84
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,494
Sorry, Yang-Yang, this is your seat.

85
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,495
Girls teased him again.

86
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,499
Never mind, have some food.

87
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,495
So, did you and NJ?

88
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,466
Don't ask me.

89
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:39,470
Who cares? You women
always trap men that way!

90
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:44,513
It still works!
It worked on your brother!

91
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,083
NJ would be a push over!

92
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,254
So?

93
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,479
Here's the bus-rider!

94
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,483
What? I drove myself here.

95
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,455
Drink! It's on my brother-in-law!

96
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,492
Why aren't you eating?

97
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,496
Those girls teased him again.

98
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,502
Try this new toy!

99
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,498
Just let him be.

100
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,479
Is it really you?

101
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,490
You're still in Taipei?

102
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,498
I live... in the US now.

103
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,544
Your son?

104
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,504
So cute.

105
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,488
This is my number.

106
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,487
Call me.

107
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,562
Why didn't you come that day?

108
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,501
I waited and waited.

109
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,499
I've never got over it, you know.

110
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,541
Sherry!

111
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,510
How many years has it been?

112
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,518
Almost 30!

113
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:39,222
Not that long! It hasn't been
that long since we graduated!

114
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,484
Didn't know you two were still
in touch!

115
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,456
We just ran into each other
by chance.

116
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,498
Good to see you still get along!

117
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:49,524
Sure.

118
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,498
My namecard.

119
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,504
My husband does business in China,
so I'll be in town quite a bit!

120
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,507
Stay in touch, okay?

121
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,508
I sure will.

122
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:06,548
Sorry, I've run out of namecards.
I keep forgetting to...

123
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,482
Sorry, I must go...

124
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:10,847
Remember, stay in touch!

125
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,519
Promise!

126
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,485
It really is a lucky day!

127
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:23,497
I've forgotten my own first love,
why do I remember yours?

128
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,501
What did I come down for?

129
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,543
Some tea?

130
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,511
No, thanks.

131
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,508
Something wrong?

132
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,483
Nothing.

133
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,488
A Japanese named Ota...

134
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,292
Dad, your cigar burst it!

135
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,496
See what happens when you smoke
those disgusting things?

136
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,259
It wasn't...

137
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,457
Then who was it?

138
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,461
Er... Whatever.

139
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,449
Quiet! Shut it!

140
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,450
Now the elders are involved.

141
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,788
Fair enough,
they must both drink!

142
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:25,929
One each!

143
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,098
Ok, ok. You guys ask us to drink,
so we will.

144
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,478
What the fuck is this?

145
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,210
It's called a "depth charge."

146
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,480
You'll both have potbellies
after this!

147
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:13,608
Bottoms up!
Bottoms up!

148
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,487
Is it raining?

149
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,492
Can you manage the stuff
in the trunk?

150
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,487
If not, ask Dad to bring it in
when he's parked.

151
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,501
Don't forget the big bag.

152
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,438
Mrs. Jian! Why are you so late?

153
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,444
Your mother's been rushed there!
Get to the hospital!

154
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:23,843
My mother?

155
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,477
Wait!

156
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,445
Wait!

157
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,486
I'll go in to see her first, NJ.

158
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,496
Wait here for A-Di,
he'll be here soon.

159
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,496
Tell Ting-Ting to put Yang-Yang
to bed.

160
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,500
I did. You go ahead!

161
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:47,497
What does the doctor say?

162
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,501
She's had a stroke.
They need to operate.

163
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,508
I saw her lying in the driveway
by the dustbins...

164
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,514
Maybe she fell over, or
maybe she was hit by a car.

165
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,488
It's odd, she rarely
goes downstairs.

166
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,188
You drove here drunk!?

167
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,484
The cops drink too!

168
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,491
Don't worry, NJ.

169
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,497
Sister called and told me
what happened.

170
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,493
Mother will be fine, it's
the luckiest day of the year!

171
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,501
A-Di, it's not that simple...

172
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,500
Maybe you don't trust me.

173
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,338
Things are different now!

174
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,504
I was unlucky, so I borrowed
from you and sister.

175
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,306
Now my luck has turned!
I'll be repaying you soon!

176
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,247
Trust me!

177
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,479
You saw my partner Piggy tonight.

178
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,491
He'll pay me back tomorrow,
and I'll pay you back next day!

179
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:48,192
Your mother is in a coma now.

180
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,192
Since she has high blood pressure,

181
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,701
the blood vessel
of the brain was burst.

182
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,608
Her condition is very serious.

183
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,544
Ting-Ting took out the garbage
in the afternoon.

184
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,484
What was Mother doing
down by the dustbins?

185
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,450
We don't know if she fell
or was knocked over by a car.

186
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,500
My brother says she'll recover
quickly.

187
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,505
It was the luckiest day
of the year.

188
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,378
He put off his wedding for
this lucky day.

189
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,512
Nothing unlucky can happen.

190
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,376
Otherwise Mother would be dead
by now.

191
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,484
That's one way to see it.

192
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,482
How else?

193
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,522
Don't complicate things!

194
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,522
How's this, Min-Min?

195
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,487
Didn't I say it goes to City Hall?

196
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,494
How does your Master see it?

197
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,501
You should go up the mountain
yourself.

198
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,502
I spent two weeks at the temple
with you!

199
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,506
I'm just not smart enough to
understand his teachings.

200
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,475
Two weeks may not be enough.

201
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,519
Look how busy I am.

202
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,522
How can I find the time?

203
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,494
Maybe you need a bit
more humility.

204
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,467
Are you saying there's
something wrong with me?

205
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,439
Look at Yang-Yang!

206
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,538
My auntie was like this
at her wedding.

207
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,477
So fat?

208
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,207
No, guess why.

209
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,215
What's under your shirt?

210
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,476
A balloon!

211
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,494
She's coming!

212
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,525
Concubine! Concubine!

213
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,494
Is she the Concubine?

214
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,490
Shut up!

215
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,463
Stay there!

216
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,504
Get on with your work!

217
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,473
What's that in your hand?

218
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,471
Nothing.

219
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,442
Better watch yourself!

220
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,321
Yang-Yang, she likes you!

221
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,490
Her old man will be jealous!

222
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,491
Who's her old man?

223
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:35,496
Today one of you has brought
something bad to class. Who is it?

224
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,528
Who has brought a condom?
Stand up!

225
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,509
If he won't admit it...

226
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,475
I'll name him!

227
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,381
Jian Yang-Yang, it's you!
Stand up!

228
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,416
Me?

229
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,482
Hand over your condom!

230
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,483
What's a condom?

231
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,490
Playing dumb?

232
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,489
Don't laugh!
You're shameless!

233
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,495
You can't hide it!
I know everything!

234
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,498
Who's telling lies about me?

235
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,502
Never you mind!

236
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,475
You just heard something,
you didn't see it.

237
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,506
So I'm wrong, am I?

238
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:30,450
You think I need to see it
to know?

239
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,481
I even know which pocket
it's in.

240
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,491
Your left pocket... come on!

241
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,497
What's this?

242
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:45,495
A balloon.

243
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,506
Quiet!

244
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,477
I'll let it go this time,

245
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,479
but you'd better watch out!

246
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,493
Had your milk?

247
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,491
I can't wait, you'll have to
take the bus.

248
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,498
You won't grow tall
if you don't drink it.

249
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,508
Mrs. Jiang.

250
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:35,545
Good morning.

251
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,479
First Girls' High... great school!

252
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:41,480
You are good!

253
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,452
So is Lili!

254
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,492
I hear her playing every day,
so beautiful!

255
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,493
I hope it's not too loud.
Do you play an instrument?

256
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,498
Yes, but I'm not very good.

257
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,498
Better to be good at books,
anyway.

258
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,497
What's the point?
What's the point?

259
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,503
What's the point in making
all the money last year.

260
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:11,545
Everyone does computers now. Just
like garment business a while ago.

261
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,480
The more orders you fill,
the more money you lose!

262
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,522
Instead of cashing in...

263
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:23,487
you blew it all
on lavish expansion plans.

264
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:24,652
So, what can I do?

265
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,357
You screwed up real bad,
what can I do?

266
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,496
We do have a strategy,
one step at a time.

267
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,899
There're always ups and downs
at a time of transition.

268
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:37,766
I warn you...

269
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:43,040
one more negative review,
and we'll pull our funds.

270
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,849
So what's this strategy?

271
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,515
Moving into software?
Or into... content?

272
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:53,485
Damn right!
It's still hush-hush...

273
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,496
Heard of a Japanese named Ota?

274
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,456
Computer games?

275
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,462
That surprised you, right?
/Promising...

276
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,467
Go on!

277
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,471
We're always cutting-edge!

278
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:14,509
Sure you are! But you're down
the tube if we pull out.

279
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,476
Why "cash in"
when we were ahead?

280
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,449
No prisoners! It was our policy.
Remember?

281
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,484
Why listen to his hindsight?

282
00:25:26,324 --> 00:28:04,873
Why should he?

283
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:31,486
You were too honest and
told him everything!

284
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:36,425
I'm not like you.
We don't even know this "Ota".

285
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,461
And we're going bust!

286
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,403
He doesn't come cheap.

287
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,436
He's a brand name!

288
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:45,499
We buy his name to attract
investors!

289
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,468
Brand name?

290
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,513
What if it costs too much
to recoup?

291
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,273
That's not good investment.
I'm against it!

292
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,281
Taiwan has the best copycats.

293
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:58,478
Are they ripping off Ota's
stuff? I'll check.

294
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:03,492
What will you guys do
if we go bust?

295
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:07,493
I know, you'll retire,
stay home and smoke your pipe.

296
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,500
Da-Da, you'll move to
San Francisco?

297
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,465
And you, NJ?

298
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:17,497
All your money's in
the company, isn't it?

299
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,469
He didn't hear me.

300
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,476
He doesn't want to answer.

301
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,449
He has other things on his mind.

302
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,450
I'm going, uncle is here.

303
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,195
Ting-Ting! You're leaving?

304
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,491
Yes, you two enjoy yourselves.

305
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,469
I didn't know she was
meeting you.

306
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,472
She and I are still very close.

307
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,480
Hey, everything's fine now.

308
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,449
I even urged Ting-Ting
to be kind to your new wife.

309
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,456
We didn't marry, but we're
still friends.

310
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,453
All these years!

311
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,498
Yes, many years.

312
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,497
You're so calm, I'm surprised.

313
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,297
Let's get to work.

314
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:25,499
Everyone was stunned by what
you did at the wedding banquet.

315
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,471
Don't get me going again, okay?

316
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,446
Here, look.

317
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:35,482
I've transferred part of our
savings to your account.

318
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,481
We cleared 20 million on
Yahoo and AOL.

319
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,452
Part of it is in a mutual fund.

320
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,491
The documents here need your
authorization.

321
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:57,473
And find me a boyfriend.
I'm alone now, you know that.

322
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:02,512
Figures give me a headache.

323
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,451
Lili!

324
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,485
I heard your grandma is in
hospital.

325
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,219
Yes.

326
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,490
Is it serious?

327
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,493
She's in a coma... she fell.

328
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,504
I love your grandma,
she's so elegant.

329
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,532
She was a teacher.

330
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,474
It's your boyfriend...

331
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:35,503
Right.

332
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,505
Why don't you go over?

333
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,496
I'll see you later.

334
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,506
You should move her
every 2 hours or so.

335
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:16,415
Like this. A different
position every time.

336
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,422
First one side, like this,
then the other, like that.

337
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,456
And put a pillow
under her back.

338
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,493
That's the way.

339
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:31,494
And pat her back often.

340
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,371
Do it yourself if the nurse
isn't here.

341
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:37,506
That's for her circulation?
/Exactly.

342
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,405
I think that's all...

343
00:29:42,580 --> 00:34:22,882
Doctor.

344
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:48,475
How long before Mother regains
consciousness?

345
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,514
It's hard to say.

346
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,484
Treat her normally...
open her window in the daytime.

347
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,455
Take her out in the wheelchair,
turn off the lights at night.

348
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:03,459
Most important, talk to her,
it stimulates her senses.

349
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,362
But I'm not optimistic.

350
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,506
You should prepare for the worst.

351
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,715
What the heck with you?

352
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,489
Don't show up any more.

353
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:03,925
Go away, go away.

354
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,497
Calm down, calm down!

355
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,828
I don't want to see you any more.
/Take it easy!

356
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,962
Get lost!
You asshole!

357
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,505
Sorry, brother-in-law,
I haven't repaid you yet.

358
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:00,484
Never mind.

359
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,486
If I forget again, remind me.

360
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,451
I'm thinking about the company.

361
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:11,490
Bad mood?

362
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,495
More financial problems?

363
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,496
You're not going bust, are you?

364
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:22,272
I'm thinking about the meeting
with the Japanese tomorrow.

365
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,465
Fuck! Are you in debt to Japan?

366
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:30,270
No! What are you saying?

367
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,470
Of course not!

368
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,480
Yang-Yang, it's your turn.

369
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:45,318
From now on, we'll take turns
to talk to Grandma.

370
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,497
It will make her wake up sooner.

371
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,499
Ting-Ting hasn't done it.

372
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,541
She played the piano, didn't she?

373
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:03,478
I could show her my drawings,
but she can't see.

374
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:07,482
But she'll hear you!
Didn't the doctor say so?

375
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,487
There's lots to tell her.

376
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,488
Like what happened at school...

377
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,449
or some little secret
you have.

378
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,490
You can tell Grandma anything.

379
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,497
What's the matter?
Why that grumpy look?

380
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,502
Don't want to talk to her?

381
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,476
What's the point?
She can't see what I tell her.

382
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,479
What?

383
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:47,484
Are you trying to get out of it?
That's not nice!

384
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,491
How can you let Grandma down?

385
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,455
You're making me cross!

386
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,497
Don't they teach you anything
at school?

387
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,498
Grandma loves you so much.

388
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,534
You can't just ignore her,
can you?

389
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,546
You just can't!

390
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,475
You take a break.

391
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,446
I'll talk to her first.

392
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,487
It's my turn.

393
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,458
Ma, I'm good at talking.

394
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,497
Luck's on my side now,
don't worry!

395
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,507
I'm rich now.
People come to me for loans!

396
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:48,508
Not like the old days when my
borrowing made you worry.

397
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,490
I've made lots of rich friends.

398
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,491
And...

399
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,494
Don't you worry about XiaoYan.

400
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,539
She's a nice girl. Really...

401
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,502
And... what else...

402
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,511
The other stuff...
I guess you know.

403
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,523
If you have questions,
you can't ask.

404
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:34,493
Today...

405
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,499
Let's call it.

406
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:50,505
You must be tired.
I'll try and tomorrow...

407
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,479
That's for... today...

408
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,488
Okay.

409
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:06,486
Grandma.

410
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,497
Did I forget to take out
the garbage?

411
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,464
I can't remember.

412
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:38,484
If you forgive me, wake up!

413
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:42,451
Please?

414
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:55,503
Because, I can't sleep
if you don't...

415
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,477
Survival instincts are
all the same.

416
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:10,476
Overfeeding may not
improve growth.

417
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,389
It may diminish evolutionary
impulses.

418
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,459
So, the drive to reproduce
declines.

419
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,492
Some of you can't bring them
into bloom.

420
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,495
You're overdoing the care.

421
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,500
Like, say...

422
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,527
Jian Ting-Ting.

423
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,540
Jian Ting-Ting!

424
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,501
She stays up all night
nurturing her plant.

425
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,475
See how they bloom?
The others must be slacking.

426
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:55,493
It begins to acquire signs of
human life.

427
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,493
It begins to think...

428
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:02,503
then matures into
a living entity...

429
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,541
and becomes our most devoted
companion.

430
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,536
That's the limitless future
for computer games.

431
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:16,481
We haven't yet surpassed fighting
and killing games.

432
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,486
Not because we haven't fully
understood computers.

433
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,482
But because we haven't fully
understood ourselves, human beings.

434
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:01,287
Our future collaboration can be
based on these objectives.

435
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,490
This is the way forward.

436
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:07,492
These are uncharted waters...

437
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,502
so I understand
your hesitations.

438
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,502
But this cutting-edge approach
puts us...

439
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,506
well ahead of any
future competition.

440
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:20,508
So there are ample grounds
for optimism.

441
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,481
That concludes my presentation,
thank you.

442
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,492
Wonderful!

443
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:40,497
We learned a lot today!

444
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,499
Really good...

445
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:49,508
No one's dared try it before,
but we have to pay for it?

446
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,511
I thought we were just buying
a brand name, pure and simple.

447
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:59,251
I liked what he said.
It's a risk worth taking.

448
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,483
Shit, you were against it
before!

449
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,452
He's too expensive, not worth it.

450
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,454
I found a local copycat of Ota.

451
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,234
Calls itself "Ato", close enough?

452
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,665
Forget the names!
What about performance?

453
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,499
Small return on small risks,
big deal!

454
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,172
It beats big losses on big risks.

455
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,207
Let's not sign with him yet!

456
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,506
Find an excuse to send him back
to Tokyo.

457
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,516
That's not nice!
Who has to tell him?

458
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,319
NJ.

459
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,517
Take Mr. Ota to dinner tonight.
Tell him we're keen to sign.

460
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:41,458
But play hard to get,
let's buy some time.

461
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,356
Why me?

462
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,431
You look honest!

463
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,162
So? Am I pretending?

464
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,464
What's wrong with
a little acting?

465
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,141
So honesty is an act?
And friendship? Business?

466
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,472
Is anything real left?

467
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,467
Don't mind
what I said about acting.

468
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,308
We've been a team
since schooldays.

469
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,314
Sure, why else do
I stick around?

470
00:42:34,518 --> 00:43:02,302
Okay, okay.

471
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,447
By the way, Sherry's husband,
Rodney Breitner is big in insurance.

472
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,490
He's from Chicago.

473
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,489
Good reputation.

474
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,488
I had a long talk with her
on the phone.

475
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,464
She asked me to say "Hi".

476
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,470
Give her a call sometime.

477
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:59,473
Just as a classmate,
not an ex-lover.

478
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,021
It's not locked.

479
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,155
You're home early.

480
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,485
I was next door.

481
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,495
Hello? Dad!

482
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:31,467
Yang-Yang hid the phone,
I couldn't find it.

483
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:39,476
We're cooking a health-food
dinner and you'll miss it!

484
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,447
Okay, next time.

485
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,488
Yes, I'll tell Ma.

486
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:56,495
That was my dad.

487
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:00,202
He's going to miss
my masterpiece.

488
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,498
Well, that's his loss.

489
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,482
So what's next?

490
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:14,445
Check that page.

491
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,319
We're out of carrots.

492
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,459
We have some.

493
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:39,504
Next time I'll show you my pad
in Shanghai.

494
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,501
My daughter's in.

495
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,480
My daughter Lili.

496
00:44:46,216 --> 00:48:22,655
Call him Uncle.

497
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,477
Call me Allen.

498
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,479
You're cooking?

499
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,483
Nice place you have here.

500
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,492
Hi, Mrs. Jiang.

501
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,493
Ting-Ting, you're cooking too?

502
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,392
Big job, isn't it?

503
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:09,470
It's fun!
Join us for a health-food feast!

504
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,540
We're going to the movies.

505
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,511
That's nice... hold on.

506
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,337
Allen, make yourself at home.

507
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,504
I'm fine

508
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,217
Shall we really go?

509
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,185
It's on me.

510
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,486
Treat Ting-Ting to a good show.

511
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,256
Your daughter is a musician!

512
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,494
She certainly is, she's won
prizes!

513
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,472
Lots of comedies,
which one do you fancy?

514
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:56,518
We can do something else...
if you'd prefer...

515
00:46:08,565 --> 00:48:22,595
Welcome.

516
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,497
Can I help you?

517
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,495
Our friend is...

518
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:16,501
They're my friends.

519
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:21,506
Hi, Fatty.

520
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:25,509
I thought you were cooking.

521
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,478
What're you doing?

522
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,510
Checking these.

523
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,452
I don't come here every day.

524
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,498
Wait for me at the
usual place, okay?

525
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,501
Fatty? He's so thin!

526
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,508
Maybe he used to be fat.

527
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:06,484
You shouldn't mind waiting.
He's often waited for you.

528
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:11,518
It's not that
he'll be here soon.

529
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,466
Want to be alone?

530
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,466
I can go home...

531
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,469
Okay.

532
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,473
Don't worry,
he'll be here soon.

533
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,495
Keep it down!
This isn't your own place!

534
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:01,241
Hey, you seem to be
disturbing her!

535
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,469
Cool it!

536
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:06,505
It's not our fault that
your boyfriend stood you up!

537
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,348
Leave her alone.

538
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,452
Been in the army too long,
I'm not used to this!

539
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,450
Cool it, cool it.

540
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,483
Don't worry.

541
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,493
I may look rough but I have
a heart of gold.

542
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,490
Let it be, okay?

543
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,300
Yes, we are very impressed.

544
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:31,906
But you know... we think
your proposal is very advanced.

545
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,405
So, my company need more time to...

546
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,509
You are like me.

547
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,416
We can't tell a lie.

548
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,652
My company, last year

549
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,117
lost big money...

550
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:53,292
Not successful...

551
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:58,534
Because we tried to
repeat the old way

552
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:02,236
so, too many same products,

553
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,404
too many competition,

554
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,836
almost not profit.

555
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,777
That is why I suggest to you

556
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,250
we try at new way.

557
00:49:19,990 --> 00:55:41,395
It's okay.

558
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,920
If we don't sign,

559
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:27,621
I understand.

560
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:32,831
Risk is high, when you do
anything for the first time.

561
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,030
No problem.

562
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,442
Just let me know

563
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:45,708
when your company makes
any decision. Ok?

564
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,310
Let's toast.

565
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:02,394
Thanks.
This must be fish...

566
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:07,767
Stange!

567
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:14,938
Why are we afraid of
the first time?

568
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,946
Every day in life is first time.

569
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,174
Evey moring is new.

570
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,748
We never live the same day twice.

571
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:31,150
We never afriad of getting up
every morning.

572
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:33,626
Why?

573
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,122
'The Great Renet'!

574
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,731
You know music very well.

575
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,128
When I was a little boy,

576
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,872
my family was very poor.

577
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:24,375
Music makes me believe
life is beautiful.

578
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:30,083
My father listen to music eveyday,
but I hate this music.

579
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:36,654
That's all?
/Yeah! When I was 15, I fell in love.

580
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,851
Suddenly
all music mean something.

581
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:46,664
Then, she left,
music stays with me.

582
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,964
She didn't like music?

583
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,509
Many people think that
music is uselss.

584
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:58,512
We can not get any money
from listen to music.

585
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,676
She also think this way.

586
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,684
So, she left you?

587
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:06,352
No, I decided to leave her.

588
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:12,184
But, you know,
I just met her a few days ago.

589
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,160
After 30 years.

590
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,960
This must be her music.

591
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,802
I can almost see
her face and that.

592
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:30,146
You know, music of way...
I'm afraid maybe you don't
like the place I'm taking you.

593
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:00,476
NJ? Your father must

594
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:04,239
have given you
piano lessons.

595
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:08,515
No, I'm not talented.
I was rejected,

596
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:09,846
after only one day.

597
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,215
And you?
/Me?

598
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,473
Where's he from?
He's good.

599
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:13,505
Japan. I just met him.
He plays well for a computer guy.

600
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,444
Bring more friends like him.

601
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,445
Great for atmosphere.

602
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,454
Times are hard.

603
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:27,485
We're in trouble.

604
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,494
Come more often...

605
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,053
Hi, you have reached Breitner's.

606
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:34,380
Please leave the message
after the tone. Thank you.

607
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:41,457
Sherry? It's me, NJ.

608
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:47,494
I'm glad it's the machine.
Otherwise I'd be tongue-tied.

609
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,508
Da-Da said he spoke to you.

610
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:56,506
He says you're doing well,
I'm so glad.

611
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:03,518
I'd heard your life was tough
before.

612
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,486
I felt it might be my fault.

613
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:15,492
You asked why I vanished without
a word 20 some years ago.

614
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,500
There were many reasons.

615
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,497
Now they all sound stupid.

616
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,543
I'm glad that you have a good life.

617
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:34,475
I'm really happy for you.

618
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,482
All my best wishes.

619
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,462
I have nothing to say to Mother.

620
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:38,477
I tell her the same things
every day.

621
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,239
What I did in the morning.

622
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:44,476
In the afternoon.
In the evening.

623
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,488
It only takes a minute.

624
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,463
I can't bear it.

625
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,508
I have so little.

626
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,912
How can it be so little?

627
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,493
I live a blank!

628
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,496
Every day... every day...

629
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,497
I'm like a fool!

630
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,465
What am I doing every day?

631
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:04,494
If I ended up like her
one day...

632
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:35,462
I'll ask the nurse to read
the newspaper to her.

633
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:39,498
She'll have something new to
listen to, okay?

634
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:45,503
Where were you last night?

635
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,474
Why should I tell you?

636
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,145
You think I'm some dumb bitch?

637
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,476
Why should I wait for you?

638
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:57,479
Give me back the cell-phone!

639
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,486
What are you doing?

640
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:00,447
You asking me?

641
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,492
Get the hell out!

642
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:06,456
Fuck you, you nosey bitch!

643
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,456
You're a fucking joke!

644
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,490
Yang-Yang, the lift's here.

645
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:44,498
Don't stare at people like that.

646
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,365
It's rude.
People will be cross.

647
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:52,507
I wanted to know why she's unhappy.
I can't see from behind.

648
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:55,535
How do you know she's unhappy?

649
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:59,546
She had a big fight last night.

650
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:01,479
I could hear from my room.

651
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:02,447
Really?

652
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,496
Daddy, I can't see what you see
and you can't see what I see.

653
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:20,499
How can I know what you see?

654
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,497
Good question.
I never thought of that.

655
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:29,507
That's why we need a camera.
Do you want to play with one?

656
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:33,504
Daddy, can we only know
half of the truth?

657
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,478
What? I don't get it.

658
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:39,487
I can only see what's in front,
not what's behind.

659
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,453
So I can only know
half of the truth, right?

660
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,496
You have a lot of questions today!
Let me ask you one...

661
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:54,494
Where shall we take Mummy
this weekend to cheer her up?

662
01:02:54,904 --> 01:06:51,971
You can decide.

663
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:20,495
Min-Min!

664
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,495
Still here?

665
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:32,504
Nancy...

666
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,462
Where can I go...

667
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,453
What are you doing?

668
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:34,456
What are you snapping?

669
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:37,189
I want to show Mummy
the mosquitoes.

670
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,493
Mosquitoes? Can you snap them?

671
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:43,497
Daddy said so,
or people won't believe me.

672
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,241
That's not our place!

673
01:05:48,444 --> 01:06:51,806
I know.

674
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:54,447
Your Mum and I both think
they are strange.

675
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:59,449
Is Mummy home?
I haven't seen her lately.

676
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,475
My boss is here, bye!

677
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:06,488
Your partners are in a meeting
with Ato Company.

678
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,447
They want you to join them.

679
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:10,451
Ato?

680
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,158
Isn't it Ota? I wasn't told.

681
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:17,230
No, Ato is Ota's copycat.

682
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:19,491
Confusing, isn't it?

683
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,272
General Manager's office.

684
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:29,501
The President's in a meeting.
May I say who called?

685
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,544
No? Thank you.

686
01:07:34,550 --> 01:11:28,044
General Manager's office.

687
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:42,454
My boss is here,
I'll call you later.

688
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,487
General Manager's office.

689
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,454
Hold on.

690
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,493
NJ, long-distance from the US.

691
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:10,535
I knew it was you.

692
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,512
You take care of the company.

693
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,472
I'm staying home.

694
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,483
Call me when you need me.

695
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,481
Seems I'm the only one left
to keep you company.

696
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,476
When Min-Min was home,
I thought...

697
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,454
she'd solve all the problems
around here.

698
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:59,489
But now, there's no one
to do it.

699
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,487
And I really don't know
when she'll be back.

700
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,696
It's hard for me
to mumble like this.

701
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:12,874
I hope you won't be offended
if I say it's like praying.

702
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,477
I'm not sure if the other party
can hear me...

703
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:23,449
and I'm not sure if
I'm sincere enough.

704
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:33,427
Frankly, there's very little
I'm sure about these days.

705
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:40,401
I wake up feeling unsure
about almost everything.

706
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:43,470
And I wonder
why I wake up at all...

707
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:48,473
just to face the same
uncertainties again and again.

708
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,414
Would you want to wake up,
if you were me?

709
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,453
Maybe Yang-Yang's right.

710
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:05,493
You've lived so many more years.

711
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:11,496
Other than these questions we can't
answer, what is there to tell you?

712
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:19,470
Anyhow, I guess you don't blame
Yang-Yang for not talking to you.

713
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,470
In many ways he takes after me.

714
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:27,437
Really.

715
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:53,839
Which brand do you want?

716
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:54,837
The same one.

717
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,471
Which was that?

718
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:02,979
This one.

719
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,484
Right, hold on.

720
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,484
Shida Road Art Portraits,
can I help you?

721
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:13,490
And the surname is...?

722
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:16,498
Okay, I'll check.

723
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,050
Wait up!

724
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,858
Knock it off! Knock it off!

725
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,995
Don't touch me!

726
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,193
Give them back to me!

727
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:54,026
Stop it! Stop it!

728
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:58,497
What the...?

729
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:10,483
What the hell are all these?

730
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:14,482
Oh, I get it.

731
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:19,158
This is what they call
avant-garde art!

732
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,487
Amazing!

733
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:24,494
Class, time for
some art appreciation!

734
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:29,295
What's it for?
It's art! Expensive art!

735
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,268
Why is art expensive?

736
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:32,497
Why take so many?

737
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,540
He's a loony!

738
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:39,510
Look at him!
Our newfound maestro!

739
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:42,515
A rare genius in our school!

740
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,481
Didn't you love to talk back?

741
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,446
Take after your father, right?

742
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:51,454
Tell him you are caught in the act.

743
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,491
Call him and ask for help!

744
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:57,462
Scared?

745
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:00,501
Stand there until he comes!

746
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,495
Don't pull that face at me!

747
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,538
Turn around against the wall!

748
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:11,506
I dare you do that again!

749
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,453
How was it the other night?

750
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,496
Isn't Lili home yet?

751
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:36,735
Could you give this to her?

752
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:44,504
Nothing.

753
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:13,466
Lili!

754
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:16,505
This...

755
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:20,437
is for you.

756
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:22,445
Thanks.

757
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,447
It's...
/I know.

758
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:37,456
Wen-Ho Lee,
originally from Tainan...

759
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,467
was found to be
in breach of Security Codes...

760
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:44,470
and dismissed from his post
at Los Alamos Research Lab.

761
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,435
To date, the Federal authorities...

762
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:51,479
do not have enough evidence
to prosecute him as a spy.
