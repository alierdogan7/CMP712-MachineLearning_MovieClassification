to Europe for the summer

as a graduation gift,
but she's back.

5
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:09,813
And I have three confirmed
sightings of her in this mall.

6
00:01:09,882 --> 00:01:11,873
Matt, I don't care
about Tori Frederking.

7

- Daddy likey.

I'm talking about The Frederking.

That was in the tenth grade.

12
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:26,097
You got truth-or-dared
into a closet with the girl.

It was literally
seven minutes in heaven.

14
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:31,293
When we got out of that closet,
she told everyone at that party

15
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,632
that I was an amazing kisser.

16
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,434
...amazing kisser.
- She did.

17
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:35,996
But you didn't kiss her.

18
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,566
You spent seven minutes shitting
your pants and not making a move.

19
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:40,475
I know, that's what makes
her so fucking awesome.

20
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:41,570
When I got out of the closet,

21
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:43,308
everyone started ragging
on me for choking,

22
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:45,782
she lied and said
that I was an amazing kisser.

23
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:48,445
- Pretty stellar move, huh?
- To the max.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,318
Oh, my God, I've been hearing this story
since we shared our mother's uterus.

Oh, and by the way,

26
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:55,057
did you even have the balls
to ask her out after that?

27
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:56,651
- I can't recall.
- No, but only because...

What do you think
this house cost them?

1034
00:56:15,217 --> 00:56:18,880
Uh... Drug habit, kids in therapy.

1035
00:56:18,954 --> 00:56:20,080
But hey, look at the view.

1036
00:56:22,091 --> 00:56:23,922
But you like it, right?

1037
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:27,691
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

1038
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:30,857
Drexel's great.
It's a real opportunity for me.

1039
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:33,766
I'll get stock options, great benefits.

1040
00:56:33,836 --> 00:56:36,270
You know, it's really a wonderful...

1041
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:39,467
What?

1042
00:56:41,677 --> 00:56:43,269
I hate it.

1043
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,214
I hate my job.

1044
00:56:48,651 --> 00:56:52,246
Wow, I... I've never
said that out loud before.

1045
00:56:52,321 --> 00:56:54,186
But I do, I hate it. I...

1046
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,718
I do. I hate all of this.

1047
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:58,725
- Really?
- Hate it.

1048
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:00,955
- Gotcha.
- Crazy, right?

1049
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:04,591
But I just keep thinking,
"Do I really want to do this?

1050
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:06,464
Is this what I want
to do with my life?"

1051
00:57:06,535 --> 00:57:07,593
Is it?

1052
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:08,864
I don't know. That's the thing.

1053
00:57:08,937 --> 00:57:13,169
I am so confused and I really...
I really don't know.

1054
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:16,340
God, I'm sorry. This must
sound ridiculous to you.

1055
00:57:16,412 --> 00:57:19,142
You are obviously
very smart at your job.

1056
00:57:19,214 --> 00:57:23,150
No, no, no, Tori...
Whoa. Are you kidding me?

1057
00:57:23,218 --> 00:57:25,243
I got this thing
that I know I'm good at,

1058
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,447
that everyone in my life...

1059
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:30,588
...you know, expects me
to turn into a career.

1060
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:33,187
But I can't stand it.

1061
00:57:33,862 --> 00:57:36,524
I know. I feel
the exact same way every day.

1062
00:57:36,598 --> 00:57:38,156
Yeah, and then there's
no turning back, right?

1063
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:40,428
It's gonna be, like,
family and mortgage...

1064
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:42,470
- I know. Yes!
- And there's no way to quit.

1065
00:57:42,538 --> 00:57:44,165
BOTH: It's a trap.

1066
00:57:49,778 --> 00:57:51,643
God, that sounds so messed up.

1067
00:57:56,752 --> 00:57:58,117
Have you ever played the penis game?

1068
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:00,587
Uh...

1069
00:58:00,656 --> 00:58:03,181
I am not prepared to reveal
that information, thank you.

1070
00:58:03,258 --> 00:58:05,055
No, it's... it's a real game.

1071
00:58:05,127 --> 00:58:08,096
I say the word penis, like really quiet,

1072
00:58:08,163 --> 00:58:10,222
and then you say it
just a little bit louder,

1073
00:58:10,299 --> 00:58:11,766
then I say it a little
bit louder than that,

1074
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:13,529
and the first to stop saying it loses.

1075
00:58:13,602 --> 00:58:15,160
Are you ready? It's easy.

1076
00:58:15,237 --> 00:58:16,602
(WHISPERS) Penis.

1077
00:58:16,672 --> 00:58:19,300
- I don't know.
- Tori, trust me.

1078
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,968
There's nothing more fun than a job
you don't give a shit about losing.

Let's call it a tie.

Christ, Christ, you are
out of control, lady.

1087
00:58:44,933 --> 00:58:46,059
TRISH: Yeah, fuck you, too.

1088
00:58:46,135 --> 00:58:47,534
What? I'm sorry.

1089
00:58:47,603 --> 00:58:50,197
Don't apologize to me.
What are you, my child?

1090
00:58:50,272 --> 00:58:51,534
Fuck you, then.

1091
00:58:51,607 --> 00:58:54,337
- Yeah, that's better.
- Yeah. All right.

1092
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:57,606
I'm gonna swallow you whole, son.

1093
00:58:58,313 --> 00:59:00,474
If you don't mind,
that would be fantastic.

1094
00:59:01,784 --> 00:59:04,082
I mean, um...

1095
00:59:04,153 --> 00:59:08,112
Suck my dick... bitch.

1096
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,589
Yeah!

1097
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:11,956

I'm gonna hammer you, Barry Nathan!

Wait a minute...

1102
00:59:24,807 --> 00:59:25,933

(GASPING)

1106
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,407
Hey! What the hell's he doing?

1107
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:34,608
Oh, he's getting a better angle.

1108
00:59:34,683 --> 00:59:36,480
OK, he can't come near me.

1109
00:59:36,552 --> 00:59:38,645
- How close?
- I don't want him touching me at all.

1110

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1111
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:44,816
- Let me outta here.
- What, you don't like this?

1112
00:59:44,893 --> 00:59:45,882
Shit no!

1113
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:47,620
Ow!

1114
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:49,561
- Yeah!
- You crazy bitch!

1115
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,622
Yeah, come on.
Lash out at me, Barry!

1116
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:54,566

I didn't go to college, OK?

1121
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:09,678
You people crossed the line
here today! This is entrapment!

1122
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:11,274
No thank you!

God, it's like, "Who lives

1125
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,085
Yeah, I know.

1126
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:20,753
Actually... hang on one sec.

1127
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:28,031
How do you feel about
a little bit of yard-hopping?

1128
01:00:28,103 --> 01:00:29,092
Uh... I don't...

1129
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:30,900

- Oh, my God!
- Shh...

1131
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:42,313
I don't think anyone's home.

1132
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:44,174
Really?

1133
01:00:45,087 --> 01:00:46,782
Welcome to your new house.

1134
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:48,789
How are you like this?

1135
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:50,882
No one else I work with is
this much fun.

1136
01:00:51,927 --> 01:00:53,792
I can't believe you're a banker.

1137
01:00:54,429 --> 01:00:56,488
Yeah. Me neither.

1138
01:01:00,636 --> 01:01:02,160
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1139
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:04,671
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh, no...

1140
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,573
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- No, not...

1141
01:01:07,643 --> 01:01:10,305
- Oh, we're doing this.
- I'm not getting on that thing.

Oh, yeah!

1143
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:14,481
Smooth. That was really smooth!

- Come on!
- No, I'm not!

1145
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:17,650
- I know you want to.
- I will watch...

1146
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,516
- Come on.
...safely from down here, thank you.

we're doing.

(GIGGLING)

1151
01:01:36,905 --> 01:01:38,634
Yeah, this is
just coming back to me.

1152
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:41,005
Do you remember
when we played truth or dare

1153
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:42,668
at Lisa Mandriko's house?

1154
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:46,771
I think that you and I got dared
into seven minutes in heaven?

1155
01:01:46,848 --> 01:01:50,545
Hmm... No, doesn't ring a bell.

1156
01:01:52,554 --> 01:01:56,217
But, you know, maybe
if we played again...

1157
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,553
You wanna play...

1158
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:00,556
...truth or dare?
- Truth or dare?

1159
01:02:01,229 --> 01:02:02,890
OK. Wow.

1160
01:02:02,965 --> 01:02:04,956
Uh... Yeah, truth.

1161
01:02:05,033 --> 01:02:08,901
If I was your high school crush,
how come you never asked me out?

1162
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,935
Uh... You know, I just never had my in.

1163
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,307
Your "in"?

1164
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:19,609
Yeah, you know, the right moment.

1165
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:22,650
You know, the perfect
confluence of events, where...

1166
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:29,017
No.

1167
01:02:29,925 --> 01:02:33,554
No, I've been telling myself
that since high school.

1168
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:35,357
And it's bullshit.

1169
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,955
I had plenty of opportunities
to ask you out.

1170
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:41,801
I was afraid.

1171
01:02:44,172 --> 01:02:45,662
Truth.

1172
01:02:45,741 --> 01:02:48,232
If I had asked you out in high school,

1173
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,540
would you have said yes?

1174
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:55,748
Hm... That's not fair.

1175
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:57,648
If I had known then,
what I know now...

1176
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:00,984
Tori... come on.

1177
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:04,586
(SIGHING)

1178
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,989
No. I probably
wouldn't have said yes.

(CHUCKLING)

1180
01:03:13,602 --> 01:03:14,660
Why do you look so relieved?

1181
01:03:14,736 --> 01:03:17,170
(CHUCKLES) Because I am.

1182
01:03:17,906 --> 01:03:22,843
My biggest regret is not having
the balls to ask you out in high school.

1183
01:03:22,911 --> 01:03:24,811
And now I know that it
wouldn't have made a difference.

1184
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,111
Besides which, if I had, and you had
rejected me, I would have despised you,

1185
01:03:28,183 --> 01:03:29,673
and I wouldn't be sitting here
with you right now,

1186
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:33,084
having the... (STAMMERS)

1187
01:03:33,155 --> 01:03:35,487
...having the best night
of my entire life.

1188
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:44,730
Dare.

1189
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:47,635
Come over here,

1190
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:51,103
and bring your lips
as close to mine as possible

1191
01:03:51,173 --> 01:03:53,004
without touching.

1192
01:03:55,343 --> 01:03:57,106
Truth.

1193
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:00,080
Are you messing with me right now?

1194
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,175
Dare.

1195
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,047
Come and find out.

1196
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:17,394
Come on...

1197
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:19,556
That good?

1198
01:04:19,634 --> 01:04:21,829
No, not good. A little closer.

1199
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,363
That's it.

1200
01:04:31,046 --> 01:04:32,570
What's that sound?

1201
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,944
I think that's my heart, beating like...

1202
01:04:38,887 --> 01:04:41,253
...really fast.

1203
01:04:43,058 --> 01:04:45,390
Dare me to make it go faster.

1382
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:56,167

Fifty-three thousand.

1383
01:14:56,237 --> 01:15:00,537
Fifty-eight thousand with the full
Corinthian leather package.

1384

Depending on what
kind of job that you get.

1393
01:15:22,163 --> 01:15:24,028
Of course, with your education,
