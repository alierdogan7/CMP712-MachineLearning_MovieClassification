I have to balance up my pros and cons

Ferguson here, World War 2.

717
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,750
Well, he dropped the
big one on the Japs.

718
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,420
Look at them.

719
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,131
Come on.
Look at 'em, PlayStation faggots.

BRUTON: You are not you, anymore.

721
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,384
You are them.

722
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:38,388
You carry their flame.
You carry their spirits.

723
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:41,683
And you have an obligation to uphold.

724
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:47,814
Tomorrow, you will rise with wings
that you did not know you had.

725
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,650
And you will fly.

726
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,111
You will feel a spirit inside of you,

727
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,656
that you did not know you possessed.

728
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:59,034
- And you will fly.
- On wings.

729
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,956
And you will see a glow,

730
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,959
descend on the field.

731
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:08,919
And in that glow,

732
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:13,966
will be the spirits of these boys,
of these men.

733
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,425
And they will carry you,

734
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:20,347
if you have the courage
and the heart to be carried.

735
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,142
And if you do not...

736
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,687
Woe be on you.

737
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,314
For if you are a cockroach at heart,

738
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,818
if you are a piece of chewable candy,

739
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,737
then this game will spit you out.

740
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,866
The chewable,
rancid nothing that you are.

741
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,202
And this team will cast you out

742
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:45,664
into your own dark nothingness.

743
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,750
Now, when you go out into that field,

744
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,961
I want you to remember three things.

745
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,587
One.

746
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,048
Be prepared to die.

747
00:43:55,717 --> 00:44:00,095
Two. Be prepared to feel
a spirit inside of you, carrying you.

748
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,221
And three,

749
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,849
wear clean cleats.

750
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,184
I can't stand dirty cleats.

I can't be trying to do this for him.

I just gotta focus.
Gotta get my mind on it.

No, I don't have time. I'll be late. All right.

01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,430
So, who wants to go first?

1071
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,308
Fuck it. I will.

1072
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,545
Lord knows, I hate sloppy-seconds.

1073
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:14,980
Okay, just lay down on that table.

1074
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,315
Cool. Just take your top off.

1075
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,525
(CHUCKLING)

1076
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:18,859
I'm an A-cup.

1077
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:20,152
I'll be the judge of that.

1078
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:22,113
Hey Smits. What is he doing?

1079
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,447
It's just fun. Relax.

1080
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:25,908
You know, I'm kinda thinking
she must be friends with all of us guys,

1081
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,618
always hanging around videotaping us,

1082
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,544
getting off on it later on,
right, sweetheart?

1083
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:31,622
How about those A-cups?

1084
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,251
Fine!

1085
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,169
What're you gonna do? Rape me?

1086
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,880
Go ahead, and then we can
use your brain scans

1087
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:41,799
to see what a sociopath looks like.

1088
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,926
- (CHUCKLING)
- So, on the table then?

1089
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,014
(GRUNTS)

1090
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,189
(SIGHS)

1091
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,479
MAN'S VOICE: Buddy, you're the best.
Buddy, you're the best.

1092
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,792
Buddy, you're the best.
Buddy, you're the best.

1093
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,756
Buddy, you're the best.
Buddy, you're the be...

1094
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,566
(SIGHS)

1095
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,245
Hi, again.

1096
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:03,839
(SCOFFS)

1097
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,560
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie.

1098
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:18,479
Jerry...

1099
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:22,358
I'd really like to know your intentions.

1100
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:23,651
- What?
- Ed, honey...

1101
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,611
Consider the weirdness
of what you're doing.

1102
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,154
My Mom's had a really rough time.

1103
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,033
And my Dad, he was an asshole.

1104
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,910
And I just really don't want
that to happen again.

1105
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,034
So, I'd just like to know
your intentions, 'cause...

1106
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:36,580
My Mom...

1107
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:38,791
She's not a good-time Gussie.

1108
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,793
Good-time Gussie?

1109
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:43,212
Ed... Don't worry about it.

1110
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,256
No, no. It's okay.

1111
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,468
Well, I was waiting for...

1112
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,971
I didn't wanna rush anything.

1113
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,099
I know, she's dating other people.

1114
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:58,978
But, I'm falling for...

1115
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:02,690
I have fallen for your Mom.

1116
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,233
JUNE: You have?

1117
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,277
JERRY: I was planning
to tell you on a picnic.

1118
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:08,241
- Does that freak you out?
- No, I love picnics.

1119
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,533
I should go.

1120
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:15,536
See ya.

1121
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,620
Bye, sweetie.

1122
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:25,045
- So... What do you eat on picnics?
- Sandwiches.

1123
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:42,062
ED: Hey, Ashby.

1124
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,480
Ashby!

1125
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:45,107
You okay?

1126
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,358
Hey.

1127
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:47,985
Look up. You all right?

1128
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:50,988
(GROANS)

1129
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,118
Oh, my God.

1130
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,747
(GROANS)

1131
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,630
You're not pissed at me, anymore?

1132
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,257
Are you okay?

1133
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,052
Do you need to get up? Here.

1134
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,137
I want...

1135
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,056
I'm hungry. I want...

1136
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:19,391
I want pancakes at...

1137
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:22,895
Diamond Diner Inn.

1138
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,397
Okay.

1139
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:35,658
What happened?

1140
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,745
Fuckers keep losing.

1141
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:42,998
It's been pointed out.

1142
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,050
You look miserable when you play.
You look like, you're...

1143
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,095
You're afraid of getting hit.

1144
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,349
You came and watched me play?

1145
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,189
Go, wait in the car.
I'm gonna go get my pills.

1146
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,816
We'll take a ride.

1147
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,445
Feel free to clean up this mess.

1148
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:22,621
Hey.

1149
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,753
I'm sorry about what I said
about your daughter.

1150
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,459
(LAUGHS SADLY)

1151
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:29,545
Well, you were wrong anyway.

1152
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:32,214
It was Spain. I was in Spain.

1153
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:37,636
You know, when she was...

1154
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:44,435
When she was 19, she was...

1155
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,811
She was troubled.

1156
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,730
She...

1157
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,899
She couldn't find her place.

1158
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,863
Years and time went by,
she just needed me to hold her hand.

1159
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,198
You know, like when she was little.

1160
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,576
You know, she used to...

1161
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:04,663
Just hold on to my hand
and she'd grip it really tight.

1162
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,919
And she looked at me with,
with them, with them eyes that...

1163
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,008
That thanked me
for knowing how to keep her safe.

1164
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,513
Maybe she

1165
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,434
looked around for me like that,

1166
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:29,021
and I wasn't there.

1167
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,025
I was off in South America and

1168
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,903
Panama, Nicaragua, you know,

1169
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,655
doing my thing.

1170
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,117
Putting a bullet in a man's head.

1171
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,042
Is that why you wanna
get to heaven so bad?

1172
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:52,878
I have to see her. I have to...

1173
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,547
I have to make it right.

1174
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:05,224
(ENGINE STARTS)

1175
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,829
But she's, she's not my girlfriend, okay?
She's just...

1176
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,415
It's, it's ambiguous, but even so,

1177
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,793
it's turned into a fucking disaster.

1178
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:34,628
Uh-huh.

1179
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,339
I can't believe we came to Washington
for pancakes.

1180
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,507
Pretty damn good?

1181
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,591
Yeah, pretty good.

1182
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:42,928
Know what?

1183
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,390
I know what your problem is.

1184
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:47,474
You do? What do I do?

1185
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,320
Well, first of all, you gotta stop bitching

1186
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:52,437
like a damn sheep on crystal meth

1187
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:53,925
and you have to just ask yourself

1188
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:57,067
how come I can't grow a set of balls
and behave like a man?

1189
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,032
- Hey.
- (SCOFFS)

1190
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,952
You missed me, didn't you? (LAUGHS)

1191
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,579
You have a very '50s view
of the world, okay?

1192
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,455
It's not all about having balls. All right?

1193
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,499
And if it was, I have balls.

1194
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,001
I got big balls.

1195
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:16,712
Always gloating, this young man.

1196
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:20,215
I've just made some strategic decisions
that didn't work out.

1197
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,341
Strategic decisions?

1198
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,468
Yeah, like, in the way
that I have handled the Eloise situation.

1199
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,803
Like, if it'd gone any further with her,

1200
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,680
I would've stepped in for sure.

1201
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:27,806
I know it.

1202
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:30,893
I think, maybe, you wanna think so.

1203
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,060
No, it is true.

1204
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,145
They're my teammates, okay?

1205
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,230
We need unity, we're a team,
and we're in a difficult place.

1206
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:37,983
And Eloise, she just always makes
it about them or me with her,

1207
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,443
and that's a difficult bind to put a guy...

1208
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:43,322
What are you doing? What is this?

1209
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,782
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

1210
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,910
- This is a pancake.
- This is a pancake.

1211
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:48,994
This is a...

1212
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,663
I thought, maybe, you're gonna convince
me it was a chicken.

1213
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,918
Here's the deal.

1214
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,920
Is she your friend?

1215
01:10:58,046 --> 01:10:59,212
Yeah.

1216
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:00,839
Did you let her down?

1217
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,177
Yeah, yeah.

1218
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:07,930
Yeah. I'm such a shitty coward.

1219
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,334
I'm such a shitty, shitty coward.

1220
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,016
Come here.

1221
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:14,186
Then don't be, okay?

1222
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,812
You make it up to the girl.

1223
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:19,858
But don't just apologize.
You gotta make amends with the girl.

1224
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:23,820
Okay?

1225
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,991
- You feel me, boy?
- I feel you, I feel you.

1226
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,329
ED: You have a lot of friends.
ASHBY: I'm a charming person.

1227
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,082
ED: Guess that's a side of you
I'm still waiting to see.

1228
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,209
Love you.

1229
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,362
Nice house you got here.

1230
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,531
I knew it was you.

1231
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:11,618
When Pete got shot,
God damn it, I knew it.

1232
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:12,911
Just had a feeling.

1233
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:15,789
Get out of the pool, Ken.

1234
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:16,999
All right.

1235
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:27,009
So I'm assuming
you found out about Garret, right?

1236
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,093
I did.

1237
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,930
Well, I knew you would, eventually.

1238
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:34,933
We were friends.

1239
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:38,437
I know.

1240
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,292
Eloise, hey, how's it going?

1241
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,836
Eloise, what's up?

1242
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,713
Yeah, yeah.

1243
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:08,967
I know. I'm just calling,

How can I not think about that?

1415
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,391
Well.

1416
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:04,354
Well, it's tough, but I...

1417
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,816
I believed in...

1418
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:13,279
I believed in something
that I thought was right.

1419
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,575
Me too.

1420
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,538
So... So, are you sorry?

1421
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:29,087
I'm sorry that
I... I had to live that life.

1422
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:31,673
No.

1423
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:34,967
I would've liked to have done
something different.

1424
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:38,721
You know.
I wanted to be a baseball player.

1425
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,559
I wanted to be a writer.

1426
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,186
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1427
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,107
So, Father?

1428
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:55,780
Can I be forgiven?

1429
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:01,536
In your heart,
do you think you're a good man?

1430
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,957
I think I've tried. I've really tried.
And um...

1431
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,960
I don't know.

1432
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:11,879
I mean, if I just tried,
I tried to be a good man

1433
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:15,174
and do my job and...

1434
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,261
Will it be enough?

1435
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,975
I absolve you of all your sins.

1436
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:33,735
Go in peace.

1437
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,228
Talk to me.

1438
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:12,690
Talk to me, Ed. What are you gonna do?

1439
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,906
I'll let you die the way you wanna die.

1440
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:21,783
Okay?

1441
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,493
I am not gonna call the cops.

1442
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,872
You just have to promise me one thing.

1443
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:36,047
Just, please don't kill that last guy.
Okay, please.

1444
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:37,965
Just, please don't kill that last guy

1445
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:40,134
because I will call, I'm gonna call them.

1446
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,970
I will, and I know I should. I...

1447
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:50,019
I just...
I can't deal with it, I can't fucking...

1448
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:55,858
I won't kill him.

1449
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,069
Thank you.

1450
01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:01,989
Can I ask you something? Like...

1451
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:07,745
Did you just use me
to drive you around...

1452
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:11,082
To do this, or...

1453
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,542
Did you actually... Like...

1454
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:14,502
Did you even care about me at all?

1455
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:20,925
I've met a lot of people in my life.

1456
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,347
But I never met anybody like you.

1457
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:31,435
It's been an honor.

1458
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,124
Hey, Ashby.

1459
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:56,836
Just so you know...

1460
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,048
I think what you did was wrong.

1461
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,375
(SCATTERED CHATTER)

1462
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,046
Young fella.

1463
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:45,885
I'll just take that.

1464
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:52,183
Entwistle, two sugars, right?

1465
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,519
Well, Ashby.

1466
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,146
What a surprise.

1467
01:27:58,065 --> 01:27:59,398
You hear Pete got clipped?

1468
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:01,359
I did.

1469
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,070
Probably screwed around

1470
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,822
with the wrong guy's wife.

1471
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,201
He didn't deserve to die.

1472
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,747
- Garret Hughes.
- Well...

1473
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:15,957
What do we know about him? I mean,

1474
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,541
really what do we know about him?

1475
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:18,918
Maybe he was a pedophile.

1476
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:21,712
Liked young kids, young boys,
young girls, you don't know.

1477
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:23,130
What are you, God? You Moses?

1478
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,049
You have a tablet? You have a ledger?

1479
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:26,717
You know,

1480
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:29,929
you've always been
a self-righteous prick.

1481
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,305
We kill people.

1482
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:32,682
That's what we do.

1483
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,517
For our country.

1484
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:36,644
Bullshit.

1485
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,646
You like killing people.

1486
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:39,730
We all did.

1487
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:41,816
He was just another one.

1488
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:48,864
You remember these?

1489
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:51,909
Cuba.

1490
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,661

- I believe freedom needs to be protected.

1492

And costs will be borne.

1493
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:13,723
And scumbags like you will highjack that.

1494
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:17,268
And just grab it
for a big house and a big pool.

1495
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,612
It's just a green sticker.

1496
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:29,947
It's not poison.

1497
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,658
I'd love to kill you.

1498
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:37,955
But I promised somebody I wouldn't.

Well, I guess...

1581
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:57,543
Be careful of what
and who you believe in.

1582
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:03,715
Find someone that you love fiercely.

1583
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:06,093
And who loves you back the same way.

1584
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:08,178
And you treat them well.

1585
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:10,431
And you know it's of value.

you shouldn't be scared of the world,

the world should be scared of you.
