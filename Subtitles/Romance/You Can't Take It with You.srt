1
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,902
-Good morning, Mr. Kirby.
-Good morning.

2
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:17,532
-Good morning, A.P.
-Good morning.

3
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:19,285
Good morning.

4
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,714
-No pictures.
-New York Times{y, Mr. Kirby.

5
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:28,884
We'd like a statement
on the business outlook.

6
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:32,139
The newspapers should know
Mr. Kirby never issues any statements.

7
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:33,392
Come on, come on.

8
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:38,442
I got your telegram, Mr. Kirby.
They're waiting in your office.

9
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:39,694
Good.

10
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:41,113
Hello, A.P.

11
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:43,116
-You're looking well.
-How was the trip?

12
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,535
-Hi, Dad.
-I'm glad to get home.

13
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:45,745
-Tony, how are you?
-Good.

14
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,915
-How's your mother?
-Fine.

15
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:50,002
Good, I nearly sent for you.
You might like the White House.

16
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:51,046
Sorry you didn't.

17
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,884
-How do you like being vice president?
-Painless so far.

18
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:56,889
He still talks
as if he were having a tooth yanked.

19
00:01:56,973 --> 00:01:59,435
-What happened in Washington?
-What did you find out?

20
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,897
-How do we stand?
-Get me some bicarbonate of soda.

21
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:03,650
How do we stand, A.P.?

22
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:06,363
There will be no interference
from the powers that be.

23
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:07,824
-There won't?
-Are you sure?

24
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:10,203
What about the senator
with the anti-trust complex?

25
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:12,165
I said there'd be no interference.

26
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:14,376
We're going ahead exactly as we planned.

27
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,965
It'll be the largest individual monopoly
in the world if we're smart.

28
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:20,302
Particularly now that Ramsey is lined up.

29
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:23,558
-That's impossible.
-The administration'd never stand for that.

30
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:26,605
-We'd control every type of war material.
-That's exactly it.

31
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,652
With the world going crazy,
the next big move is munitions.

32
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:31,822
And Kirby and Company will cash in on it.

33
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:32,865
It's unbelievable.

34
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,077
A war wouldn't be possible anywhere
without us.

35
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,291
If I know Ramsey, he'll never let himself
be absorbed by anybody.

36
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,501
-Won't he?
-No.

37
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:42,297
We'll see if he will
when I hand him a little surprise.

38
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:46,220
I own every inch of the 1 2 blocks
that surround the Ramsey factories.

39
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:49,350
-News to us!
-We didn't know anything about that.

40
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:52,564
So, how is he going to fulfill his contracts
without us?

41
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,861
You'd better get busy.
Complete your negotiations with the others.

42
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:58,741
-I'll handle Ramsey myself.
-We'll hop right to it.

43
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:01,412
I have a meeting with my nitrate group
this afternoon.

44
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:02,539
Good.

45
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,547
$10,000 a year for doctors
and I'm still taking this stuff.

46
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:13,265
-Son, what do you think about it?
-Don't ask me.

47
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:15,310
You know how cockeyed
my sense of value is.

48
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:19,275
Get me that sour-faced real estate agent
on the phone. What's his name?

49
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:22,322
-Blakely.
-Yeah. Private line.

50
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:26,620
-Dad, how do you feel?
-Rotten. It's my stomach.

51
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:27,789
I thought so.

52
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:31,337
These trips to Washington have me jittery.
But it's the last one.

53
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,089
From now on, they come to me.

54
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:38,431
Tony, do you realize there won't be a bullet,
gun or cannon made here without us?

55
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:43,481
Now, Dad, don't tell me
you've forgotten the slingshot market.

56
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:50,284
Mr. Blakely on the phone.

57
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:53,915
Hello, Blakely. This is A.P. How's it going?

58
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,587
You what? What trouble?

59
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,132
Now, wait a minute. Don't bite my head off.

60
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:01,636
I've got all 12 blocks, everything...

61
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,100
...with the exception of one little lot
and I can't get the man to sell.

62
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:08,314
Those 1 2 blocks are useless
unless I get every inch of them.

63
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,776
I'm up against some kind of an old crank.

64
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:12,864
His house isn't worth over $25,000.

65
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:15,576
I've already offered him $50,000,
but he's standing pat.

66
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,080
If you can't get it with money
there are other ways.

67
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:20,334
That's up to you. Now, remember this:

68
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:24,466
Unless you buy up the whole 1 2 blocks,
you won't get a penny commission.

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,349
That man has got ice water in his veins.

70
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:31,311
The description fits only one man.

71
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:33,647
I've simply got to get that property, Bill.

72
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,194
You can't force a man
to sell his home, John.

73
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,283
I've got to. I'll make him sell
if I have to drive him out with stink bombs.

74
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:44,373
Listen, a fortune has been invested
in those 1 2 blocks.

75
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,422
Behind it is one of the most powerful men
in the country, and a silly old man...

76
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:51,886
...with that silly little house
is holding up the whole business.

77
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:55,684
-Now, how do you like that?
-Excuse me, John, but I think it's great.

78
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:58,939
What did he say when you offered him
$50,000 for his place?

79
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,569
I'm not sure,
but I think someone began singing.

80
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:05,909
Someone danced and Grandpa Vanderhof
sat down and played a mouth organ.

81
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:07,370
Played a mouth organ?

82
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:09,916
-What are they, a bunch of nuts?
-Fascinating ones.

83
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,713
-It's the old army game.
-I doubt it. He's not interested in money.

84
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:15,091
Mr. Vanderhof is here.

85
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:18,931
-Have him come in right away.
-How did you get him to come here?

86
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:21,477
Not interested in money, eh?

87
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,190
Miss Jones, just a minute.
Don't send him in yet.

88
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:26,360
Have him wait. Let him cool his heels.

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,361
Yes, sir.

90
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:31,868
-He will just be a minute, Mr. Vanderhof.
-Thank you.

91
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:35,792
That guy wanting me
to split commissions three ways.

92
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:58,078
What are you doing?

93
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:01,459
My goodness. I made a mistake.

94
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,546
First time in 20 years.

95
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,094
That calls for the building to collapse,
I suppose?

96
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:10,307
-Have some.
-No, thank you. It'll spoil my appetite.

97
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,937
What are you doing that for?

98
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:16,025
I have to add up these figures
to see if they're right.

99
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,152
Why?

100
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:21,116
Why? Because they have to check
against these figures.

101
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:25,165
-Say, do you like this?
-Like it?

102
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:29,172
-This work you're doing.
-No, my goodness, no.

103
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:32,344
Land's sake, what am I saying?

104
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:34,681
Well, why do you do it?

105
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:37,728
Look, they're very strict
in this office and I....

106
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,024
Isn't there something else
you'd rather be doing than this?

107
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:42,193
No!

108
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,532
Go along with you.
I don't believe a word you're saying.

109
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:49,246
Go on, tell me,
what would you rather be doing than this?

110
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,919
I make up things.

111
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,092
-Poetry?
-No. Just things.

112
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,305
Go on. Let me see some of them.

113
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:17,334
-That's kind of cute.
-It is, isn't it? I made it up myself.

114
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,294
Yes.

115
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:20,756
I have a lot of other ideas just like it.

116
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:25,890
Well, what do you mean
fooling around with those dull figures?

117
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,979
Seems to me, Mr....

118
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:31,315
"Poppins."

119
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,575
It seems to me, that is the kind of work
you ought to be doing.

120
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,165
Some day I am going to do nothing else.
Some day, when my ship comes in.

121
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:46,925
How'd you like to come over to our house
and work on your gadgets?

122
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,261
Over to your house?

123
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:52,225
-Well, I don't know. I thank you, but--
-Oh, go along. You'd love it.

124
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,606
Everybody over at our place
does just what he wants to do.

125
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:56,941
Really?

126
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,320
That must be wonderful.

127
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:03,619
-But how would I live?
-The same way we do.

128
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:05,539
The same way.

129
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:07,834
Well, who takes care of you?

130
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,049
The same one that takes care
of the lilies of the field, Mr. Poppins.

131
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:17,433
Except that we toy a little,
spin a little, have a barrel of fun.

132
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:21,231
If you want to,
come on over and become a lily, too.

133
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:24,404
A lily? Me? A lily of the field?

134
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:26,782
What's that?

135
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:30,246
Just a little something
Mr. Poppins whipped up.

136
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,038
Why, Mr. Poppins.

137
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:33,911
Ethel, come here. Take a look at this.

138
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:35,744
Alice, George, John.

139
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:38,201
-Did you do that?
-Isn't that clever?

140
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,617
Aren't you clever, Mr. Poppins?

141
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:42,741
Where is he, Miss Jones?

142
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:48,946
What's going on here?

143
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:54,152
Welcome, Mr. Vanderhof.
Come right into my office.

144
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:57,734
-No, thank you, Mr. Blakely. I'm going.
-Going?

145
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:00,067
-Hello, Mr. Hughes.
-How do you do?

146
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:02,982
What's happened?
You were all right last time I saw you.

147
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:06,980
One of my granddaughters dared me
to slide down the banister.

148
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:12,852
-Too bad, is it serious?
-No, just a sprain or something.

149
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:15,684
The thing I like most about it
is the crutches.

150
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:19,724
I've been wanting to walk on them
ever since I was a kid, haven't you?

151
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:22,431
Oh, yes, must be a lot of fun.

152
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:25,347
Well, Mr. Vanderhof,
I believe we understand each other.

153
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,596
Now, I'm ready to do business.

154
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,387
Say, that's a bad twitch in your eye.

155
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:34,135
You've been working too hard.
You ought to take a vacation.

156
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:38,007
If it's all the same to you, Mr. Vanderhof,
let's quit playing games.

157
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:39,508
I'm a very busy man.

158
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:43,589
A couple of weeks fishing
will fix up that twitch, Mr. Blakely.

159
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:48,086
I've got to go to the graduation exercises
over at the university.

160
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,877
Look, I have a check here for $100,000.
If you're interested--

161
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,835
-Have you been to one lately?
-No.

162
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:56,000
They're a truckload of fun.

163
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:02,538
You ought to hear the speeches.
I'd better be going. I'll be late.

164
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:07,703
Lookout for that twitch, Mr. Blakely.

165
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:15,783
Coming, Poppins?

166
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:19,032
I'd like to, but I don't think.... I'd better not.

167
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:22,822
-Yes, sir.
-This is all your fault. You and your toys.

168
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:25,903
You....

169
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:31,068
Wait a minute, please.

170
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:38,523
If you leave, Poppins,
you needn't come back.

171
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:45,728
Wait, wait.

172
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,225
The die is cast.

173
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,225
I'm a lily.

174
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,266
Have some popcorn.

175
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:02,220
Did your grandpa go
to the graduation exercises, Miss Essie?

176
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:03,678
Guess so.

177
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:07,968
I wonder how many folks
Grandpa will bring home for dinner tonight.

178
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:11,467
I don't know. It all depends on
whether he goes walking in the park.

179
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,548
Well, let him bring them.
I'll be ready for them.

180
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:26,293
-Mother, will you taste a Love Dream for me?
-Not now. I'm busy.

181
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:32,749
Do you have to make candy today, Essie?
It's so hot.

182
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:35,622
Well, Ed went out
and got a bunch of new orders.

183
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:39,079
-How did it taste to you?
-If this keeps up, you'll be opening a store.

184
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:42,578
That's what Ed was saying last night,
but I said no.

185
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,993
No. I want to be a dancer.

186
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:53,114
Finish your second act yet, Mrs. Sycamore?

187
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:55,530
No, I've got Cynthia
just entering the monastery.

188
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,196
I'll be right down, Mr. DePinna.

189
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,195
I just want to show my wife
these new firecrackers we made.

190
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:03,443
Penny, we can make up a lot of these
before the Fourth of July...

191
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:06,234
...and sell them for 10 cents a string. Watch.

192
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,774
Watch, Penny.

193
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:19,394
Nice, huh?

194
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:22,726
-Yes, Paul.
-Kids will go for those like hotcakes.

195
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,974
Mr. Sycamore, I'm afraid we've got
the powder chamber too near the balloon.

196
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:33,263
-Let's go down to the cellar and try it.
-Where's Grandpa? Let's ask Grandpa.

197
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,303
I ain't done nothing, but I'm sure tired.

198
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:39,302
You're always tired. From what?
You was born tired.

199
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:41,759
Here, you're just in time to set the table.

200
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:45,757
I don't see why I got to do your work
just because we're engaged.

201
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:52,921
-Donald, were you ever in a monastery?
-No, I don't go no place much.

202
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,504
I'm on relief.

203
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,877
Hello, Momma.

204
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:03,333
What do you say, Donald boy?

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,373
Well, I delivered all the candy.
Where's my beautiful wife?

206
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,329
Oh, lordy!

207
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,454
Here's a new one, Ed. Taste it.

208
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:18,202
-I'm calling it Love Dreams.
-Boy, you're a whiz.

209
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:21,034
Listen to this tune.
It's been ringing in my ears all day.

210
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,033
-Come on back a minute, Essie.
-What tune?

211
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:28,155
This is a beauty. You'll like this.
Let me turn the little do-jigger on.

212
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,398
I like that, Ed. Yours?

213
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:46,189
No, Chopin.

214
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:48,438
Well, it's got a lot of you in it.

215
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:57,726
What do you say there, Donald?

216
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:07,097
Well, you should have been there.
Everybody should have been there.

217
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,386
-Hello, Grandpa. How's your foot?
-How's my foot? Is that all I get?

218
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,842
Big class this year, Grandpa?

219
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:21,007
-How many were there?
-There must have been two acres.

220
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,422
Everybody graduated.

221
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:27,046
The speeches were funnier this year, too.

222
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,378
If you want to hear a good speech,
you ought to hear Father Divine.

223
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:33,502
Don't you worry. They'll have him there yet.

224
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,623
See if this sounds any better to you,
Mr. DePinna.

225
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:54,576
Mr. Poppins, excuse me.

226
00:14:54,868 --> 00:15:00,323
This is my granddaughter, Essie,
and this is her husband, Mr. Carmichael.

227
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:01,989
Hello.

228
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:04,779
-What do you say, Mr. Poppins?
-How do you do?

229
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,778
Help yourself to a Love Dream.
They're on the table.

230
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:20,106
And this is my daughter, Mrs. Sycamore.

231
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:23,729
-This is Mr. Poppins, dear.
-How do you do?

232
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:26,978
Have a chair, Mr. Poppins.
Were you ever in a monastery?

233
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:29,643
In a monastery? Well, I....

234
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,559
What's the matter, Penny? Stuck?

235
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:34,683
Yes, I sort of got myself in a monastery
and I can't get out.

236
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:39,139
It'll come to you.
Remember how you got out of that jail?

237
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,179
Oh, that's fine, Ed.

238
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,470
-Is Alice coming home to dinner?
-She didn't say.

239
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,135
I think she should stop working
in that millinery shop.

240
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,009
They make her stay so late.

241
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:52,466
Penny, she hasn't been there
for five months.

242
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,966
She hasn't?

243
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:57,922
Isn't that a shame?
She was going to get me a hat I liked.

244
00:15:58,006 --> 00:16:02,045
-She works for bankers now.
-Bankers? That's wonderful.

245
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:05,170
Essie's dancing teacher
wants to borrow $100 on his car.

246
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:06,544
Do you think she could fix it?

247
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:10,500
Sure, Kirby and Company
just loaned somebody $80 million.

248
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:21,662
I must speak to Alice about it.

249
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:36,988
Mr. DePinna was right.

250
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:39,321
The powder chamber
was too close to the balloon.

251
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:41,194
-Have a Love Dream, Father.
-No, thanks.

252
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,027
Mr. Poppins, this is Mr. Sycamore,
my son-in-law.

253
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:46,359
How do you do?

254
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:49,317
We're testing a new skyrocket
and Mr. DePinna was saying--

255
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,648
Knew it all the time.
You can't have that powder chamber close.

256
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,856
Mr. Poppins, Mr. DePinna.

257
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,563
How do you do?

258
00:16:56,688 --> 00:17:00,519
-Mr. Poppins is going to stay with us.
-Oh, really? How wonderful!

259
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,186
Just for a short time. You see--

260
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:06,059
That's what I thought, that day
nine years ago when I delivered the ice.

261
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:07,683
Nine years ago?

262
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:09,849
You were the ice man.

263
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:12,056
-Mr. Poppins makes up things.
-Really?

264
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:13,179
You do?

265
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,654
Say, that's wonderful!

266
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,815
-Did you make that all by yourself?
-Yes.

267
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:25,854
That beats all.

268
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:28,888
-I have other ideas, too. Better ones.
-You have?

269
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:33,085
-Let's go down to the shop.
-You have a shop? That's marvelous.

270
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:40,483
Mrs. Penny...

271
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:41,190
Mrs. Penny...

272
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:45,096
...why don't you write a play
about "ism" mania?

273
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,507
-"Ism" mania?
-Yes, sure.

274
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:51,580
You know, communism, fascism...

275
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:56,400
...voodooism,
everybody's got an "ism" these days.

276
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,889
-I thought it was an itch or something.
-Well, it's just as catching.

277
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,959
When things go a little bad nowadays,
you go out and get yourself an "ism"...

278
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,913
...and you're in business.

279
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:08,827
I got it.

280
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,068
It might help Cynthia to have an "ism"
in the monastery.

281
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,811
Yes, it might at that.

282
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:19,757
Only give her Americanism.
Let her know something about Americans.

283
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:25,492
John Paul Jones, Patrick Henry,
Samuel Adams.

284
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:28,484
Washington, Jefferson, Monroe.

285
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:33,388
Lincoln, Grant, Lee, Edison and Mark Twain.

286
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:39,165
When things got tough with those boys,
they didn't run around looking for "isms."

287
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:45,441
Lincoln said, "With malice toward none,
with charity for all."

288
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,049
Nowadays they say, "Think the way I do
or I'll bomb the daylights out of you."

289
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,028
Why don't you go back
to your war play, Mrs. Sycamore?

290
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:03,769
-I like that one best.
-Really, Rheba? Well, maybe I will.

291
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,922
Hello. Miss Alice Sycamore, please.

292
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:20,019
You know, every once in a while
I get a very strange sensation.

293
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,678
I seem to hear a ringing in my ears.

294
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,834
Me, too. I thought for a moment
it was the telephone.

295
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:28,164
Yeah.

296
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,283
I hear voices, too.

297
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:35,146
Voices that say, "If you don't kiss her soon,
you're a chump."

298
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,050
If I were really clever, I could answer
the phone without the use of my hands.

299
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,169
I saw it done in a circus once.

300
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,871
Good.

301
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,986
That's wonderful.
I bet you'd be a sensation on a trapeze.

302
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:53,723
-Mr. Anthony Kirby Junior's office.
-Now, that's clever the way you say that.

303
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,092
Hello, Rheba.

304
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,837
No, Rheba.

305
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:00,165
Were you ever in a monastery?

306
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:05,859
No, but I'm the fellow
that got caught in a cave once.

307
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:07,853
-Really?
-Yeah.

308
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,682
Whatever happened to you?

309
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:14,171
Well, the cave caved in
and I haven't been heard from since.

310
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:18,783
Mrs. Kirby.

311
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,942
Hello, Mr. Hammond.
I'm just going in to see my son, Tony.

312
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:25,350
He's a very busy man nowadays.
I doubt if you can see him.

313
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:30,919
Dinner? Wait a minute, Rheba.
Wants to know if I will be home for dinner.

314
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:33,495
-No.
-The man says no, Rheba.

315
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:37,028
Tell Grandpa that I love him
just as much as ever...

316
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,769
...but a terrible, young vice president
has me in his power.

317
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:43,469
Of course I'm struggling, Rheba.

318
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:47,127
It would do your heart good
to see me struggle, Rheba.

319
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:54,400
Hello, Mother.

320
00:20:57,393 --> 00:21:01,798
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll visit with your father for a while.

321
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,237
-Busy, wasn't he?
-Definitely.

322
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:19,752
Goodbye, Rheba. The ceiling just fell in.

323
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:31,055
Would you be so kind as to give me
the want ad section of the newspaper?

324
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:35,877
I'm sorry, Alice.

325
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:38,370
Checks to be countersigned, Mr. Kirby.

326
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:02,600
I wouldn't mind his carrying on in the office,
but he's getting serious about her.

327
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:05,176
Miriam, it'll be bigger
than steel and can together.

328
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:07,212
Talked to me for hours about her last night.

329
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,334
Answer those.

330
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,748
-Who?
-Tony.

331
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:13,696
Talked to me for hours about his secretary.
Told me he was--

332
00:22:14,236 --> 00:22:15,690
-Yes?
-Mr. Ramsey to see you.{y

333
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:16,896
I'm too busy.

334
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,932
-Says he's in trouble.
-I don't care.

335
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:20,096
Anthony.

336
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:24,917
Yes, about Tony. I'll speak to him.
That was Ramsey.

337
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,618
Just found out what's up,
and is he screaming for help!

338
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:30,735
-But in the meantime, what about this girl?
-No.

339
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,647
What sort of a family is she from?

340
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,930
-Who? The secretary?
-Yes. Not steel or can, or Ramsey, or--

341
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:37,967
All right. Don't get so excited about it.

342
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:41,583
The girl is a stenographer.
Boys like Tony don't marry stenographers.

343
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,946
-Anthony, we must do something about her.
-All right, I'll fire her.

344
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,562
This isn't a business deal.
You can't settle anything by firing the girl.

345
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:52,097
All right, then. I won't fire her.
Hello. What?

346
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:54,258
No. I didn't mean you.

347
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:03,318
-You weren't going out, were you?
-Yes. I thought I--

348
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:05,604
We had a date, don't you remember?

349
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:07,764
I'm sorry. I forgot.

350
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:11,214
Yeah, we ought to discuss where to go,
don't you think?

351
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:16,077
We can't just pop out
of the building with no place to go.

352
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,113
That's a very bad idea.

353
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:22,393
I knew two people that did that once.
They went out of the building.

354
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:27,880
They were uncertain, so they just walked
and walked, and finally they died...

355
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:29,168
...of hunger.

356
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:33,781
You wouldn't want anything like that
to happen. Because if that happened....

357
00:23:37,106 --> 00:23:38,685
You're so beautiful.

358
00:23:39,683 --> 00:23:42,384
Sometimes you're so beautiful
it just gags me.

359
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:45,750
Maybe you're not real.
Maybe you're a phantom.

360
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,202
I keep expecting you to vanish.

361
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:51,859
Look, you better sit down over here
for a while.

362
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:55,101
Phantoms don't vanish very often
in a sitting position.

363
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,135
There. Now, wait a minute.

364
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:00,504
Here.

365
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,776
Here.

366
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:10,270
Now, let's see.

367
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,117
-That's a very lovely picture.
-Tony, I--

368
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:23,611
Now, wait a minute. Don't say anything.

369
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,149
Now look, phantom.

370
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:29,429
Last night I informed that irate lady
who was just in your office...

371
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,546
...that I was going to marry you.

372
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:39,279
I don't remember you telling it to me.

373
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:42,022
Well, you didn't ask me.

374
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:45,305
-That's right, I didn't.
-No, but she did.

375
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:47,633
I talked about you so much
that she finally said:

376
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:50,666
"Next thing I expect to hear
is that you'll marry the girl."

377
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:53,159
And I said, "Yeah, that's it exactly."

378
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,277
-What did she say?
-Nothing.

379
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:01,098
-Just fainted dead away.
-No, she took it standing up.

380
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:19,716
You know, if you scratch
under the surface here...

381
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,210
...you'll find a proposal lying around.

382
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:35,384
I admit it's kind of left-handed.

383
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,044
I can't help that.

384
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:40,580
I'm sort of a left-handed guy, you know.

385
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:42,698
Oh, Tony.

386
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:47,021
What about them?

387
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:48,434
Mother and Dad?

388
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,842
Did you see the way she looked at me?
I know what she was thinking.

389
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:56,663
There seems to be the impression
that the Kirbys are ogres or something.

390
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:59,198
If they are,
that doesn't make any difference to me.

391
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,193
They're just putty in my hands, Alice.

392
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:05,224
I never wanted anything that I couldn't get
if I just yelled loud enough.

393
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:07,925
Worked like a charm when I was a baby,
and since then...

394
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:12,248
...l've had so much practice that I'm terrific.
Here, I'll give you an idea.

395
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:22,346
Oh, Tony.

396
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:31,615
One little detail I forgot to mention.

397
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:33,609
I love you, Alice.

398
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:41,879
-Hello, Grandpa.
-Hey, Grandpa.

399
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:50,358
Yes, I have some of Essie's Love Dreams.

400
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:54,680
There he is. The man on the crutches.
You've got to get something on him.

401
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:56,218
What do you want us to do?

402
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:59,625
I don't care,
just make him sell that property.

403
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:03,657
-Hello, Grandpa, how's the foot?
-Hello, Mac. Oh, fine, thanks.

404
00:27:03,782 --> 00:27:06,815
Say, what's the meeting
over at Jensen's bakery?

405
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:09,475
They're excited about having to move out
or something.

406
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,301
-Move out?
-Yes, that's what I heard.

407
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:15,003
They're coming over to see you now,
I guess.

408
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:20,488
Did you hear about it, Grandpa?
We maybe all have to move.

409
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:21,569
Who said so?

410
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:24,769
Everyone's talking about it.
Somebody's buying up everything here.

411
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,972
They've been trying to buy it up
for a factory.

412
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:29,923
My landlord told me
that they offered him a lot of money.

413
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:31,752
Nobody wants to move. You know that.

414
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:35,574
-Emil put up some new shelves. Cost $60.
-I've been here for 20 years.

415
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:39,523
-I think we ought to see somebody about it.
-Wait a minute. Don't get excited.

416
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:42,722
We've all been neighbors for a long time.
I know that.

417
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:45,590
But if they're buying this property up
for a factory...

418
00:27:45,716 --> 00:27:48,126
...they'll need every foot of ground,
won't they?

419
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,082
I guess so.

420
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:52,531
Well, now, suppose I won't sell my place.
What are they going to do?

421
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:54,775
-That's right, you own your place.
-Sure, I do.

422
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,354
They're going to need it, too.

423
00:27:56,438 --> 00:28:01,383
You bet they will, and it'll take more
than money to make me sell my property.

424
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:05,996
Go on, get back to work and stop cluttering
up the street, or we'll all be arrested.

425
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:44,938
We sure need more displays this year.
We've got nothing exciting enough.

426
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:49,176
Mr. Sycamore, if I may suggest,
why not the "Russian Revolution"?

427
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:51,546
There's plenty of fireworks there.

428
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,369
The "Russian Revolution,"
clash of the colors, the reds and whites.

429
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:57,696
You've hit on something brilliant.

430
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,483
I don't understand.

431
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:03,099
A letter for me? Must be some mistake.

432
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:04,845
It had your name on it.

433
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:06,673
Where is it?

434
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:09,457
-I don't know. Where's Grandpa's letter?
-What, dear?

435
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,450
I said, where's that letter
that came for Grandpa last week?

436
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:13,614
Last week?

437
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:16,065
I don't know.
I remember seeing the kittens with it.

438
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:19,598
-Who was it from? Did you notice?
-The United States Government.

439
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:23,421
Really? I wonder what they want.

440
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:26,621
There was one before that
that came from the same people.

441
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:29,157
I can't imagine
what they'd be writing to me for.

442
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:33,604
You could put your printing
to some practical use.

443
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,225
Wait a minute.

444
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,469
I've got another idea.

445
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:42,788
-That wasn't very loud, was it?
-We can get it louder than that.

446
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,617
What is your idea, Mr. Poppins?

447
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,235
-Well, may I tell it?
-Yes.

448
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,022
Go back to work, Jim. Go back to work.

449
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:53,552
Why shouldn't Ed print about fireworks
and put it in the candy boxes?

450
00:29:53,636 --> 00:29:56,212
That would advertise the Revolution,
wouldn't it?

451
00:29:56,296 --> 00:30:00,077
Say, "Watch for the Revolution.
It's coming soon." How's that?

452
00:30:00,202 --> 00:30:03,776
"Watch for the Revolution.
It's coming soon." I can use my big type.

453
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:07,392
We've got plenty of these Red Flags.
You can write about them.

454
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:11,382
The Red Flag will sweep the country.
"Get your Red Flag from Sycamore."

455
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,042
Ed made up a beautiful song today
by Chopin.

456
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:33,076
Hello, Miss Alice.
Anybody get hurt when the ceiling fell in?

457
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,605
"Forks on the left, forks on the left, Rheba"

458
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:40,722
"Get your Red Flag from Sycamore."
How does it sound, Alice?

459
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:45,253
Gather around, everybody.
It's the town crier.

460
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:47,746
-The town crier.
-What is it?

461
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:54,521
Gather around, everybody.

462
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,806
Where's Grandpa?
I have an announcement to make.

463
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,425
-What is it?
-A young man is calling for me.

464
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:00,588
Is that all, Alice?

465
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:04,370
-Maybe he's a special young gentleman.
-You may go to the head of the class.

466
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:07,112
What's special about him?
Has he got horns or something?

467
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:09,523
-Maybe he's handsome like Ed.
-I'd better put a tie on.

468
00:31:09,607 --> 00:31:11,560
-Where'd you meet him?
-Better set another place.

469
00:31:11,643 --> 00:31:15,508
No. Mother, we're going out.
I thought he'd better take you in easy doses.

470
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:20,121
Mother, please don't read any of your plays
to him the first time he comes...

471
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:21,784
...because I like him.

472
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:24,485
Essie, I wouldn't dance for him
if I were you...

473
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:27,435
...because we're going
to the Monte Carlo Ballet later.

474
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,298
-Does anybody know what time it is?
-It was 5:00 about two hours ago, wasn't it?

475
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:34,002
Oh, never mind.

476
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:36,163
-Where's Grandpa?
-He's upstairs.

477
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:41,441
Incidentally, the young man's name is Tony
Kirby. Let me know the minute he comes.

478
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,893
Tony Kirby? Say, that's the boss' son.

479
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:44,932
Really?

480
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:47,592
Yes, and she told me
they've made him vice president.

481
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:48,880
Isn't that wonderful?

482
00:31:48,964 --> 00:31:51,457
We could have the wedding right here
in this room.

483
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:53,410
Now, wait a minute, Penny.

484
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:57,483
-This is the first time he's called for the girl.
-You only called for me once.

485
00:31:57,608 --> 00:32:02,013
-Young folks are different nowadays.
-I don't know. Look at Ed and me.

486
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:04,632
He came to dinner once and just stayed.

487
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,753
That's right.

488
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:08,580
The whole Alabama football team
would have stayed, too...

489
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:12,112
...if you'd had 10 more Essies.
How am I doing, Essie?

490
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,011
Well, there's a lot of fuss being made
about a young man taking you out to dinner.

491
00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:23,457
Well, there's a lot of fuss being made
about a young man taking you out to dinner.

492
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,826
What's so exciting about that?

493
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:29,401
-A proposal is exciting.
-Proposal!

494
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:33,516
That's something very different.

495
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,006
Move over there and give me some room.

496
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,785
Stop messing with that package.

497
00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:44,362
And let's get down to cases.

498
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,274
In love, huh?

499
00:32:47,438 --> 00:32:49,599
Well, well, I--

500
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:51,926
"Well, I," my foot.

501
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:54,336
Either you are or you aren't.

502
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:57,329
Let me look at your eyes.

503
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,402
Yes, of course.

504
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,228
Now, come on, tell me all about it.

505
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:08,135
What kind of a boy is he?
Do you have fun together?

506
00:33:09,382 --> 00:33:12,083
That's no answer to any question.

507
00:33:12,873 --> 00:33:14,202
Is he nice?

508
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:20,119
-Can't even talk about him, can you?
-Not rationally.

509
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:22,957
Who's asking you to be rational?

510
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,002
Listen...

511
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:29,677
...when I was courting your grandmother,
it took me two years to propose.

512
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:32,306
You know why?

513
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:36,147
The moment she'd walk into a room,
my knees buckled.

514
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,363
The blood would rush up into my head
and the walls would start to dance.

515
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:45,914
-Twice I keeled over in a dead faint.
-Why, Grandpa!

516
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:51,047
Yeah, she finally dragged it out of me
when I was in bed with a 104 fever...

517
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:53,301
...and in a state of hysteria.

518
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:58,979
When she accepted, the fever returned
to normal and I hopped out of bed.

519
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:04,613
Why, the case was written up in the medical
journals as the phenomenon of the times.

520
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:09,371
There was nothing phenomenal about it.
I just had it bad, that's all.

521
00:34:09,455 --> 00:34:11,792
And I never got over it either.

522
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:17,302
Right up to the very last,
she couldn't walk into a room...

523
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:20,933
...without my heart going thump, thump.

524
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:25,733
Oh, you darling.

525
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:29,656
I wish I had known her.

526
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,994
What was she like?

527
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:35,459
Look in there.

528
00:34:41,553 --> 00:34:43,222
This was her room, too.

529
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,230
Did you ever notice
the peculiar fragrance in here?

530
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:51,862
Yes, but I never knew what it was.

531
00:34:52,531 --> 00:34:56,371
It's hers. It's never left here.
She hasn't either.

532
00:34:57,456 --> 00:35:01,796
I can still hear the tinkle
of her thin little voice...

533
00:35:02,757 --> 00:35:05,052
...and see her eyes laughing.

534
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:11,271
That's the reason I've lived in this house
so many years and could never move out.

535
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:14,902
It would be like moving out on Grandma.

536
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,625
You go on back
to that infernal package of yours.

537
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:27,341
Now, wait just a minute.

538
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:28,635
It's for you.

539
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,680
-For me?
-Yes.

540
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:35,355
Why, bless my soul. It's a new harmonica.

541
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:38,360
-That's for your birthday.
-My birthday?

542
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:42,284
How do you know when my birthday is?
I don't even know myself.

543
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:45,707
Anytime I get an impulse
to buy you a present, that's your birthday.

544
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,459
Well, thanks, darling.

545
00:35:48,921 --> 00:35:50,214
Grandpa.

546
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:54,556
Grandpa, I hope you like him.

547
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:58,479
Anybody you fall in love with
is all right with me, Alice.

548
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:01,192
-You know that.
-Thanks, Grandpa.

549
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:03,529
Incidentally, what's his name?

550
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,491
Tony Kirby.

551
00:36:06,535 --> 00:36:09,748
-Not the son of "the" Kirby?
-Yes.

552
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,380
Pretty snooty outfit, aren't they?

553
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:16,594
Yes, but it's all right.
Tony told his mother about it.

554
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,141
It doesn't matter, I'm so happy.
I can't think of anything.

555
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:23,188
You go right on being happy.

556
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:27,822
Yes, I think I'll go downstairs
and take a whack at this.

557
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:56,288
I wonder where Alice's boyfriend is.

558
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:00,170
-Isn't that the doorbell?
-Doorbell's ringing.

559
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:02,215
-Get the doorbell, somebody.
-Want me to go?

560
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:03,593
Never mind. I'm coming.

561
00:37:03,718 --> 00:37:06,431
I'll answer it. It's all right, Rheba. I'll go.

562
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,936
Grandpa, he's here. Alice's young man.

563
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,523
Remember what she said.
Everybody be nice to him.

564
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:15,363
That's the first time that doorbell's rung
since Halloween.

565
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:16,907
Pipe, pipe.

566
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:22,083
-Welcome to our little home.
-How do you do?

567
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:26,340
I'm Alice's mother. Come right in.
Everybody's dying to know you.

568
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,261
Now, here we are.

569
00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:33,436
That's Grandpa, and that's Alice's father,
her sister and her husband, Ed Carmichael.

570
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,276
-Make yourself at home.
-I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

571
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:39,322
-How's that?
-My card.

572
00:37:40,115 --> 00:37:43,328
"Wilbur G. Henderson.
Internal Revenue Dept."

573
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:45,708
Well, for heaven's sake.

574
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:48,672
-I'm looking for Martin Vanderhof.
-Right here, sir.

575
00:37:48,797 --> 00:37:50,591
Excuse me. I've got work to do.

576
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:53,597
-Mind if I sit down?
-Sit right down, sir.

577
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:58,314
Mr. Vanderhof, the government wants
to talk to you about a matter of income tax.

578
00:37:58,397 --> 00:37:59,565
Income tax?

579
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:04,365
-Is that Mr. Kirby, Mother?
-No, it's an internal something or other.

580
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,410
Pardon me.

581
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:11,544
Mr. Vanderhof, we've written many letters
about this, but we've received no reply.

582
00:38:11,629 --> 00:38:15,427
That's what those letters were.
Did you hear that, Penny?

583
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:20,060
-This is the party that's been writing to me.
-It's not me, Mr. Vanderhof.

584
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:22,481
You see, the Internal Revenue Office--

585
00:38:23,316 --> 00:38:26,029
-That must be him now.
-Doorbell's ringing again.

586
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:28,282
-I heard the doorbell.
-I'm on it.

587
00:38:28,492 --> 00:38:29,744
Want me to go?

588
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:31,538
Pipe, pipe.

589
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:39,760
How do you do, Mr. Kirby? Come right in.

590
00:38:39,845 --> 00:38:42,850
-Thank you.
-We've been expecting you.

591
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:45,854
-You are Mr. Kirby, aren't you?
-Oh, yes.

592
00:38:45,939 --> 00:38:49,319
Thank heavens. Here he is.
This is really Mr. Kirby.

593
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:53,994
This is Alice's father, and her grandfather,
and her sister Essie, and Essie's husband.

594
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:57,083
-Won't you sit down, Mr. Kirby?
-Yes.

595
00:39:03,261 --> 00:39:07,685
-Mother, is that Mr. Kirby?
-Yes, dear. He's lovely.

596
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:09,980
I'll be right down.

597
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:12,944
-She'll be right down.
-Thank you very much.

598
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:18,245
-Do y'all play football?
-A little, yeah.

599
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:23,963
You are awful young to be a vice president.

600
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:29,097
You know what that means, vice president.
An office with my name on the door.

601
00:39:30,642 --> 00:39:32,228
Is that all?

602
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:35,566
I have a secretary.
A very lovely secretary, too.

603
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:37,738
Isn't that sweet, Ed?

604
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:41,327
How about salary?
Don't you get any salary?

605
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,833
A little. More than I'm worth, I'm afraid.

606
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:48,652
I beg your pardon.

607
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:52,321
I suppose you're ready
to settle down and get married now?

608
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:55,289
Come now, Penny. I'm sure Mr. Kirby
knows his own mind.

609
00:39:55,413 --> 00:39:57,144
You mustn't rush him, Mother.

610
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:02,051
All I meant was, he's bound to get married,
and suppose the wrong girl gets him.

611
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:04,607
Mr. Vanderhof, I've got to be going.

612
00:40:04,731 --> 00:40:07,740
Oh, too bad.
I'm sorry you can't stay to dinner.

613
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:08,894
Drop in again.

614
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:11,946
If you don't mind,
I'd like to settle my business before I go.

615
00:40:11,987 --> 00:40:14,130
He's selling something for the government.

616
00:40:14,255 --> 00:40:16,398
What can I do for you?

617
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:19,202
Mr. Vanderhof, our records show...

618
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:22,170
...that you have never paid any income tax.

619
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,407
That's right.

620
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,880
-Why not?
-I don't believe in it.

621
00:40:30,004 --> 00:40:32,024
You don't believe in it?

622
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:36,022
Mr. Sycamore, I can't get these things
to go off. Look.

623
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:39,526
-Not now, Mr. DePinna.
-No. Not now. Grandpa's busy.

624
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,773
-Mr. Kirby. Mr. DePinna.
-How do you do?

625
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:47,112
Of course, didn't I read something
about your father?

626
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,967
He was indicted or something, wasn't he?

627
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:51,895
No, he just testified
before the Securities Commission.

628
00:40:51,978 --> 00:40:53,833
-I thought the cops had got him.
-No.

629
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:56,884
-Come along, Mr. DePinna. Come on.
-See here, Mr. Vanderhof.

630
00:40:56,966 --> 00:41:01,707
Whether you believe it or not, you owe
the government 22 years back income taxes.

631
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,211
Wait a minute. That's too far back.
That's outlawed, ain't it?

632
00:41:05,294 --> 00:41:07,520
-What's your name?
-What's the difference?

633
00:41:07,603 --> 00:41:09,911
-Did you ever file an income tax return?
-No, sir.

634
00:41:09,994 --> 00:41:13,580
-What was your income last year?
-I don't know, about $85, wasn't it?

635
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:14,859
I don't know.

636
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:21,826
Now, Mr. Vanderhof, that's a serious thing,
not filing an income tax return.

637
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:24,877
Now, just suppose I do pay you this money.

638
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:29,165
Mind you, I don't say that I'm going to,
but just for the sake of argument...

639
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:31,474
...what's the government
going to do with it?

640
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:34,937
-What do you mean?
-What do I get for my money?

641
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:39,884
For instance, if I go into a department store
and buy something...

642
00:41:40,379 --> 00:41:43,100
...there it is. I can see it.

643
00:41:43,678 --> 00:41:45,801
But what are they going to give me?

644
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:48,841
The government gives you everything.
It protects you.

645
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,007
From what?

646
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,297
Invasion. How do you think the government
will keep up the Army and Navy...

647
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:57,046
-...with all those battleships?
-Battleships?

648
00:41:57,712 --> 00:42:01,918
Last time we used battleships
was in the Spanish-American War...

649
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:06,374
...and what did we get out of that?
Cuba. And we gave that back.

650
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,956
Why, I wouldn't mind paying
for something sensible.

651
00:42:10,082 --> 00:42:14,288
Something sensible! What about Congress
and the Supreme Court and the President?

652
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:19,244
-We've got to pay them, don't we?
-Not with my money, no, sir.

653
00:42:20,285 --> 00:42:23,366
Now, wait a minute.
I didn't come here to argue with you.

654
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,741
Hello, everybody.

655
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,199
-Hello, Tony.
-Hello, Alice.

656
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:28,905
-Is everybody acquainted with everybody?
-Yes, indeed.

657
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:32,154
We've had a most delightful talk
about love and marriage.

658
00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:34,569
I'm sorry. I tried to hurry.

659
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:36,277
Look, Mr. Vanderhof.

660
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,816
You haven't paid any income tax,
and you've got to pay it.

661
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:45,730
-What was that?
-I said you've got to pay it.

662
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:48,813
Well, you've got to show me.

663
00:42:49,396 --> 00:42:52,269
We don't have to show you. I just told you.

664
00:42:52,353 --> 00:42:56,434
Who's going to pay for all those buildings
in Washington and interstate commerce?

665
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:57,892
And the Constitution?

666
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:01,098
The Constitution has been paid for
years ago.

667
00:43:01,224 --> 00:43:05,680
And as for interstate commerce....
What is interstate commerce anyway?

668
00:43:06,263 --> 00:43:09,761
There are 48 states, see?

669
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:12,552
If it wasn't for the interstate commerce...

670
00:43:12,635 --> 00:43:16,424
...nothing could go
from one state to another, see?

671
00:43:17,133 --> 00:43:19,631
Why not? Have they got fences?

672
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,045
No, they haven't got fences.
They've got laws.

673
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:30,418
Holy smokes!
I never ran across anything like this before.

674
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:35,748
I might pay about $75...

675
00:43:35,957 --> 00:43:38,247
...but it isn't worth a cent more.

676
00:43:38,706 --> 00:43:42,121
You'll pay every cent just like anybody else.
Now, listen to me.

677
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:44,286
You'll go to jail if you don't pay.
That's law.

678
00:43:44,412 --> 00:43:47,785
If you think you're bigger than that,
you've got another thing coming.

679
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,492
You're the same as anybody else...

680
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:53,073
...and the sooner you get that
through your head, the better.

681
00:43:53,782 --> 00:43:55,239
Holy smokes!

682
00:44:09,608 --> 00:44:12,481
My father makes fireworks in the cellar.

683
00:44:14,314 --> 00:44:16,521
-How did that sound to you?
-Pretty good.

684
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:17,854
Thanks.

685
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:20,019
I guess we'd better be going, Tony.

686
00:44:20,103 --> 00:44:23,518
-Say, he was pretty mad, wasn't he?
-He certainly was.

687
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:26,724
That might get you into trouble,
Mr. Vanderhof.

688
00:44:26,808 --> 00:44:30,306
No, not me. I was only having fun with him.

689
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:32,596
I don't owe the government a cent.

690
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:32,763
-We're going. Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

691
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:35,470
-We're going. Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

692
00:44:35,637 --> 00:44:38,760
-Hello, everybody.
-Hello, Kolenkhov.

693
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:45,341
You know, never have I seen you look
more magnificent.

694
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:49,047
Thank you. Mr. Kirby, this is Mr. Kolenkhov,
Essie's dancing teacher.

695
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:52,795
-I don't know you, but you are a lucky man.
-Thank you.

696
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:56,294
-I practiced today, Mr. Kolenkhov.
-My Pavlova.

697
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:03,331
-Grandpa, I am in time for dinner, no?
-You are in time for dinner, yes.

698
00:45:03,665 --> 00:45:07,204
Goodbye, Mr. Kolenkhov.
We're going to the Monte Carlo Ballet.

699
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,329
The Monte Carlo Ballet?

700
00:45:09,912 --> 00:45:11,286
It stinks.

701
00:45:14,577 --> 00:45:16,201
Good night, everybody.

702
00:45:16,326 --> 00:45:18,824
-Good night.
-Good night.

703
00:45:19,408 --> 00:45:20,699
The Monte Carlo Ballet!

704
00:45:20,824 --> 00:45:22,364
Dinner's ready.

705
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,320
My little Rheba,
what would I do without my angel?

706
00:45:28,404 --> 00:45:31,735
Only three shirts. They must be washed
by your beautiful hands...

707
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,067
...and would you sew on two buttons?

708
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:38,482
Monte Carlo Ballet! Sergei Diaghilev!
Then you have ballet.

709
00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:40,688
Quite, please.

710
00:45:41,356 --> 00:45:42,647
Quiet.

711
00:45:43,396 --> 00:45:45,853
Well, sir. Here we are again.

712
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:51,684
We've been getting on good for a while,
and we're certainly much obliged.

713
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:56,765
Looks like Alice is going to get married,
and I think she'll be very happy...

714
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,804
...because we just met the boy you sent her
and he looks fine.

715
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:06,968
Remember, all we ask is to go along
the way we are and keep our health...

716
00:46:08,051 --> 00:46:12,257
...as far as anything else is concerned,
we leave that up to you.

717
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:13,590
Thank you.

718
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,463
Mr. Kolenkhov,
did you bring me any Russian stamps?

719
00:46:17,547 --> 00:46:21,545
No. Nobody writes to me. They're all dead.

720
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:30,165
I was just thinking about that family
of yours.

721
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:34,704
Living with them is like living in a world
that Walt Disney might have thought of.

722
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:37,079
Everybody does just as he pleases,
doesn't he?

723
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:41,035
Yes, Grandpa started it.
He suddenly quit business one day.

724
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,700
He started up in the elevator, came
right down again and never went back.

725
00:46:44,784 --> 00:46:48,199
He could have been a rich man,
but he said he wasn't having any fun.

726
00:46:48,282 --> 00:46:49,656
That's wonderful.

727
00:46:49,948 --> 00:46:53,654
Then he started collecting stamps
because that's what he liked best.

728
00:46:53,738 --> 00:46:56,361
You know, he gets paid
just to appraise collections.

729
00:46:56,445 --> 00:46:58,902
-He's an expert.
-That's marvelous.

730
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:03,691
My dad, he makes fireworks
because he never grew up, I guess.

731
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,857
And, Mother.
Do you know why Mother writes plays?

732
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:09,646
She likes literature and good books.

733
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:14,602
No, because eight years ago, a typewriter
was delivered to the house by mistake.

734
00:47:14,686 --> 00:47:18,933
If it had been a plough,
she'd have taken up farming, huh?

735
00:47:19,017 --> 00:47:21,432
I'm sure of it, if she'd liked it.

736
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:27,929
This is making conversation, but weren't we
supposed to go to the ballet?

737
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:31,303
Yes. Well, let's see.

738
00:47:33,427 --> 00:47:35,634
Yes, second seat over, miss.

739
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:47,003
I can talk and I can listen, or I can just sit.

740
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:50,794
-What will you have?
-Well, I think I'd like to have this first.

741
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:07,619
-Mr. Moody, what are you thinking about?
-Me?

742
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:13,366
That family of yours.
Boy, they knocked me for a loop.

743
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:15,116
I don't know.

744
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:19,654
It just seems like, in their own way,
they've found what everybody's looking for.

745
00:48:20,446 --> 00:48:23,527
People spend their whole lives
building castles in the air...

746
00:48:23,653 --> 00:48:26,984
...and then nothing ever comes of them.
Wonder why that is?

747
00:48:27,985 --> 00:48:29,484
It takes courage.

748
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:33,106
Everybody's afraid to live.

749
00:48:33,482 --> 00:48:36,522
You ought to hear Grandpa on that subject.
You know, he says...

750
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,562
...most people nowadays are run by fear,
fear of what they eat...

751
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:43,394
...fear of what they drink,
fear of their jobs, their future, their health.

752
00:48:43,477 --> 00:48:46,142
They're scared to save money,
and scared to spend it.

753
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:48,266
You know what his pet aversion is?

754
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:52,556
People who commercialize on fear,
scare you to death to sell you something...

755
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,012
-...you don't need.
-Yeah, I agree with him.

756
00:48:55,097 --> 00:48:59,136
So he kind of taught all of us
not to be afraid of anything...

757
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:03,676
...and to do what we want to do,
and, well, it's kind of fun, anyway.

758
00:49:03,759 --> 00:49:06,715
Yeah, that's it, but that takes courage.

759
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:10,172
Especially that
do-what-you-want-to-do department.

760
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:15,170
I remember in college,
another guy and I had an idea.

761
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:21,751
-Do you mind if I talk about myself?
-If you don't, I will.

762
00:49:26,498 --> 00:49:28,497
This guy and I had this idea.

763
00:49:31,454 --> 00:49:35,077
We wanted to find out...

764
00:49:35,202 --> 00:49:37,201
...what made grass grow green.

765
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:42,282
That sounds silly, but that's the biggest
research problem in the world today.

766
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:43,947
I'll tell you why.

767
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:48,404
Because there's a tiny little engine
in the green...

768
00:49:48,446 --> 00:49:53,401
...of this grass and in the green of the trees
that has the mysterious gift...

769
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:58,566
...of being able to take energy
from the rays of the sun and store it up.

770
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:04,563
You see, that's how the heat, and power
in coal, and oil, and wood, is stored up.

771
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,227
We thought if we could find the secret...

772
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:12,976
...of all those millions of little engines...

773
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:18,473
...in this green stuff, we can make big ones
and then we could take all the power...

774
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,888
...we could ever need
right from the sun's rays. See?

775
00:50:22,138 --> 00:50:25,178
-That's wonderful. I never knew that.
-Yeah.

776
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:28,260
We worked and worked on it...

777
00:50:29,718 --> 00:50:33,341
...day and night. We got so excited about it
we forgot to sleep.

778
00:50:34,133 --> 00:50:37,381
If we'd make just one little discovery...

779
00:50:38,922 --> 00:50:40,921
...we'd walk on air for days.

780
00:50:42,587 --> 00:50:45,335
Yeah, then what?

781
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,542
Then we left school...

782
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:53,290
...and now he's selling automobiles...

783
00:50:54,623 --> 00:50:57,496
...and I'm in some strange thing
called banking.

784
00:51:00,328 --> 00:51:02,576
I saw him a couple of weeks ago.

785
00:51:03,702 --> 00:51:06,034
Poor guy. Bob Smith is his name.

786
00:51:07,658 --> 00:51:11,406
Got all excited again,
wanted to talk about nothing else.

787
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:14,613
And?

788
00:51:16,654 --> 00:51:20,110
He's married, and his wife just had a baby.

789
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:25,025
Didn't think it was fair to gamble
with the future.

790
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:30,606
Anyway, that's his excuse
for lack of courage.

791
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,187
Don't say it. What's my excuse?

792
00:51:37,144 --> 00:51:41,350
The Kirbys have been bankers
for 9,000 years...

793
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,682
...and the line just can't be broken.

794
00:51:44,766 --> 00:51:48,680
That's been pounded into my head
until I have softening of the brain.

795
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:52,678
That's my excuse.

796
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,176
Tony, that's kind of silly,
you're pretty young to....

797
00:51:58,051 --> 00:52:02,132
I resent what you said about your brain.
I think it's beautiful.

798
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:05,796
You do?

799
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:07,879
You don't say.

800
00:52:08,379 --> 00:52:13,668
That's probably the first thing you noticed
about me, that you liked my colossal brain.

801
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:19,332
No, it was the back of your head.

802
00:52:20,082 --> 00:52:21,331
-My head?
-Yes.

803
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:24,079
-Nothing but a bump back there.
-The shape of it.

804
00:52:24,205 --> 00:52:26,370
What happened when I turned around?

805
00:52:27,495 --> 00:52:30,035
I figured I would have to get used to that.

806
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:32,326
You figured?

807
00:52:32,743 --> 00:52:35,908
I figured it might not take very long,
but I figured I'd just--

808
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:39,448
-You just figured that you'd get used to that.
-Yes.

809
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:43,404
-I'm glad you figured.
-Yes.

810
00:52:48,568 --> 00:52:48,859
What do you say, mister?
Want to learn to do the Big Apple?

811
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,900
What do you say, mister?
Want to learn to do the Big Apple?

812
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:55,106
-That's against the law, you know?
-So is necking.

813
00:52:57,023 --> 00:52:58,980
-How much is it?
-Ten cents.

814
00:52:59,063 --> 00:53:01,436
Wouldn't do it for a nickel, would you?

815
00:53:04,977 --> 00:53:06,059
I get it.

816
00:53:06,143 --> 00:53:08,433
-Can you do the Big Apple?
-No, can you?

817
00:53:08,517 --> 00:53:09,391
No.

818
00:53:09,475 --> 00:53:12,931
All right. I'll take a chance.
There you are. What do we do?

819
00:53:13,015 --> 00:53:15,138
You just watch them. It's a lead pipe cinch.

820
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:18,761
Okay, Red. You and Snoopy.
Make it hot. Let her go.

821
00:53:20,095 --> 00:53:22,094
You just watch them.

822
00:53:22,177 --> 00:53:23,259
Oh, yeah!

823
00:53:28,216 --> 00:53:30,464
Okay. Dorothy, you take this man.

824
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,462
-Come on, wiggle.
-Wiggle?

825
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:38,711
Point your toe.

826
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:40,377
-Which toe?
-That one.

827
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,790
Come on, wiggle!

828
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:49,081
It's not good unless you wiggle.

829
00:53:49,165 --> 00:53:51,413
That's right. Wiggle.

830
00:53:52,288 --> 00:53:54,078
-Swell.
-Swell.

831
00:53:54,162 --> 00:53:55,453
The winner.

832
00:53:57,244 --> 00:53:59,076
-Come on.
-Take it easy, Alice.

833
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,117
You ready?

834
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:01,824
-You all set now?
-Yep.

835
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,989
Shuffle, and shuffle, and move around.

836
00:54:06,115 --> 00:54:10,987
Break, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, step.

837
00:54:11,612 --> 00:54:13,819
Come on, sister, loosen up. You're too stiff.

838
00:54:13,944 --> 00:54:16,234
Yeah, Alice. Loosen up. That's it.

839
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,023
Very good. The new champion.

840
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:26,646
All right. Grab your partners.

841
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:33,434
Wonder whatever happened
to Astaire and Rogers.

842
00:54:34,143 --> 00:54:35,850
Jiggers, the cops.

843
00:54:53,217 --> 00:54:55,007
Pretty swank.

844
00:55:07,877 --> 00:55:10,042
Good evening, Mr. Kirby. Good evening.

845
00:55:10,126 --> 00:55:12,583
We seem to be attracting a little attention.

846
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:15,706
Oh, no. It isn't you they are watching.
It's Lord Melville.

847
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,164
-Lord Melville?
-Yes.

848
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:20,163
-Where is he?
-At your table with your father.

849
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:25,410
Tony, don't ask me to go over there
because I won't.

850
00:55:25,494 --> 00:55:27,534
No, Alice. It will be all right.

851
00:55:27,618 --> 00:55:30,949
I want you to meet a four-star blueblood.
Come on.

852
00:55:39,362 --> 00:55:40,361
Good evening.

853
00:55:40,445 --> 00:55:42,568
-Hello, Mother.
-Hello, Tony.

854
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:44,026
No, please.

855
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,317
Please be seated.

856
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:48,690
My son Tony, and Miss....

857
00:55:48,774 --> 00:55:50,648
-Alice Sycamore.
-Sycamore, of course.

858
00:55:50,732 --> 00:55:54,105
I never could remember names.
Lord and Lady Melville.

859
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,395
-How do you do?
-How do you do, sir?

860
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,561
Governor Leach and Mrs. Leach.

861
00:55:58,644 --> 00:56:00,184
How do you do?

862
00:56:01,935 --> 00:56:03,101
Nice party.

863
00:56:03,184 --> 00:56:05,932
-A couple of chairs, please.
-No, a table for two.

864
00:56:06,016 --> 00:56:08,389
-Yes, sir.
-Just want a table for two.

865
00:56:08,931 --> 00:56:11,721
-What do you have there, sir? A new game?
-Oh, no.

866
00:56:11,805 --> 00:56:14,595
I was just seeing
how far I could trace my family tree.

867
00:56:14,678 --> 00:56:16,343
Your mother was interested.

868
00:56:16,428 --> 00:56:19,967
I thought all that family tree stuff
went out with the buffalo.

869
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:22,007
How absurd, Tony.

870
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:25,465
America is more and more conscious
of its background.

871
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,796
It cost me $5,000 last year
to trace my family tree.

872
00:56:32,503 --> 00:56:35,459
And you, Miss Sycamore.
Have you a family tree?

873
00:56:35,543 --> 00:56:37,042
-Me?
-Yes.

874
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:41,998
My dear sir, don't you know
that a sycamore is a tree?

875
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,037
No comment.

876
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,661
Good night.

877
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,701
Good night.

878
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:00,614
Good night.

879
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:19,023
Boy, there are going to be some questions
asked about my family, and their tree.

880
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:22,229
-I can just feel it.
-Good, I know all the answers.

881
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:26,019
If we're honest now, we're going
to save ourselves a lot of embarrassment.

882
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:28,476
Tony, I want you to invite them to my house.

883
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,017
So that's what has been on your mind?

884
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,472
It will give them an opportunity
to meet everyone, and then they'll know us.

885
00:57:35,557 --> 00:57:38,555
All right. I think I can arrange that.

886
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:42,302
Let's see, I can put each member
of your family in a separate cage...

887
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:46,218
...and then put tags on them and the Kirbys
can march up and down like this.

888
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:49,382
Do you think I'm going to put you
on exhibition like a circus?

889
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:52,257
-I don't mind.
-I do. I'm just not going to bother.

890
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,797
We've got to.

891
00:57:53,881 --> 00:57:56,921
To them, I'll always be
just a stenographer who....

892
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:05,251
-Look at your mother. She is still staring.
-Who wouldn't stare at you?

893
00:58:05,334 --> 00:58:07,457
Tony, promise me you'll do it.

894
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:13,579
You know, every time I think how lucky I am,
I feel like screaming.

895
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:15,786
Tony, please promise you'll invite them.

896
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:19,285
-I feel a scream coming on.
-We'll have to face it sooner or later.

897
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:21,992
It's starting in my toes.
Sort of a tingling sensation.

898
00:58:22,076 --> 00:58:24,824
-Ask them for Wednesday.
-It's creeping up around my knees.

899
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,323
It's going up my legs.
Traveling faster and faster.

900
00:58:27,448 --> 00:58:31,654
-You're not really going to scream.
-It's in my stomach now. It's got me.

901
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:32,945
Not with your mother here.

902
00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:36,444
-It's going up. It's all over my body now.
-Please don't.

903
00:58:36,527 --> 00:58:39,858
It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out.

904
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:42,191
I can't hold it back any longer. Here it goes.

905
00:58:42,316 --> 00:58:43,148
No!

906
00:58:53,353 --> 00:58:54,644
What happened?

907
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:57,850
-A mouse went right past there.
-A mouse in this place?

908
00:58:57,976 --> 00:59:01,557
-A rat that long with hair on it.
-A rat with hair on it?

909
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,347
There were about six of them.
Six or seven of them?

910
00:59:04,472 --> 00:59:06,137
-Where?
-Where?

911
00:59:06,222 --> 00:59:08,470
Right under that table.

912
00:59:11,344 --> 00:59:13,009
There they go!

913
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:36,581
Mr. Kirby, I'm terribly sorry, terribly sorry.

914
00:59:36,665 --> 00:59:39,163
It's all right, Henri.
Buy yourself some mousetraps.

915
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:40,329
Thank you.

916
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:45,369
Are you ready, Anthony?

917
00:59:45,495 --> 00:59:48,202
Are you serious about taking me
on this slumming tour?

918
00:59:48,326 --> 00:59:51,741
The more we fight him, the more he'll resist.
It's the only thing to do.

919
00:59:51,866 --> 00:59:54,656
Pretend, at least,
that we are willing to be reasonable.

920
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,238
She's probably from some dull,
middle-class family.

921
00:59:57,322 --> 01:00:01,778
As soon as Tony sees us together,
he'll realize how impossible the situation is.

922
01:00:01,862 --> 01:00:04,485
Yeah. That, I take it,
is what is known as being subtle.

923
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:05,568
Yes.

924
01:00:14,064 --> 01:00:16,229
Come here a minute, Donald.

925
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:24,684
Donald, look and see if you see a man
standing in front of the house.

926
01:00:25,142 --> 01:00:26,849
What are you so excited about?

927
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:30,889
There's been a man following me lately
when I'm out delivering candy.

928
01:00:31,014 --> 01:00:33,054
Maybe he wants a piece of candy.

929
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:37,511
What's the matter, Alice? Are you jealous?

930
01:00:37,595 --> 01:00:41,218
-Do you want to break your leg, too?
-I got to do it without holding on.

931
01:00:41,301 --> 01:00:42,592
Let me have a piece of paper.

932
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:45,799
We ought to make a list out for Rheba
for tomorrow night.

933
01:00:45,924 --> 01:00:48,880
Let Rheba have the kitchen
all day tomorrow, won't you?

934
01:00:48,964 --> 01:00:50,379
-She'll need it.
-Yes, Alice.

935
01:00:50,463 --> 01:00:52,420
That's why I'm making
my Love Dreams now, so I'll be way ahead.

936
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:55,711
Thank you.
Mother, tomorrow, before the Kirbys come...

937
01:00:55,753 --> 01:01:00,417
...let them put everything down in the cellar,
the typewriter, the kittens, the vibraphone....

938
01:01:00,459 --> 01:01:04,540
The Kirbys are certainly going
to get the wrong impression of this house.

939
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:07,496
Guess I'd better have cocktails at 7:00.

940
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,162
I wonder if I ought to let Rheba
cook the dinner.

941
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:12,119
Stop worrying, Alice.

942
01:01:12,578 --> 01:01:16,659
From what I've seen of the boy,
the Kirbys are probably very nice...

943
01:01:16,743 --> 01:01:20,990
...and if things aren't too elaborate
tomorrow night, why, it will be all right, too.

944
01:01:21,116 --> 01:01:25,239
Darling, I'm not trying to impress them,
or pretend we're anything that we aren't.

945
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,070
We'll do everything we can
to make it a nice party.

946
01:01:28,154 --> 01:01:30,694
-Will you, Mother?
-Of course, dear.

947
01:01:34,109 --> 01:01:36,899
-Does Richard know where to go?
-Yes, I told him, Dad.

948
01:01:36,983 --> 01:01:40,148
Why did it have to be tonight?
I have more important things to do.

949
01:01:40,273 --> 01:01:43,688
I didn't want to trouble you,
but Alice wanted you to meet her family.

950
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:46,852
There you are, Anthony.
She may be very nice after all.

951
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:49,477
Why, Mother, you're breaking down.

952
01:01:49,644 --> 01:01:54,058
Heaven only knows what they'll have to eat.
You know how sensitive my stomach is.

953
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:55,681
Do we have to go there for dinner?

954
01:01:55,766 --> 01:02:00,263
-There are sure to be some vegetables.
-Probably raw. Mine have got to be cooked.

955
01:02:00,513 --> 01:02:04,344
Mrs. Sycamore, look what I found.

956
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:08,468
Oh, it's my painting of you
as the discus thrower.

957
01:02:08,551 --> 01:02:11,424
-Look, Grandpa.
-You remember, it was over eight years ago.

958
01:02:11,508 --> 01:02:15,381
I meant to finish it, then I got started
on my plays and I never painted again.

959
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,838
It's just as well.
I'd have been the next one to strip.

960
01:02:18,921 --> 01:02:21,836
I wish you would finish it.
I'd kind of like to have it.

961
01:02:21,878 --> 01:02:23,710
Would you? Perhaps I will.

962
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:27,292
Right tonight. Is the costume
and the easel still in the cellar?

963
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:28,667
Sure. I saved them.

964
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:32,539
You go and get them, Mr. DePinna.
I'll find my palette and brushes.

965
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:35,996
-Hello, everybody.
-Hello, Kolenkhov.

966
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,869
-Grandpa, I am in time for dinner, no?
-Of course you are.

967
01:02:39,995 --> 01:02:42,202
That is why I like to come....

968
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:44,492
What is that?

969
01:02:44,617 --> 01:02:48,365
That's a picture of Mr. DePinna.
Penny painted it.

970
01:02:49,657 --> 01:02:51,072
It stinks.

971
01:02:53,238 --> 01:02:55,528
I'm sorry to keep you, Mr. Kolenkhov.

972
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:58,860
My Love Dreams were on the stove.
I'll get into my dancing clothes.

973
01:02:58,902 --> 01:03:02,067
My Pavlova, you are like a beautiful swan.

974
01:03:07,023 --> 01:03:09,730
Essie making any progress, Kolenkhov?

975
01:03:11,146 --> 01:03:13,644
Confidentially, she stinks.

976
01:03:14,895 --> 01:03:16,852
As long as she's having fun.

977
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:23,515
My, it feels nice
to get into my art things again.

978
01:03:23,557 --> 01:03:27,680
-You're a breath of Paris, Madame
-Thank you.

979
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:35,010
It happened again.
A man followed me every place I went.

980
01:03:35,093 --> 01:03:37,633
I'm ready, Mrs. Sycamore.
Where are you going to work?

981
01:03:37,717 --> 01:03:39,466
-Right here.
-All right, Grandpa?

982
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:42,839
I'd forgotten that costume was so classical.

983
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:55,125
Your expression, Mr. DePinna. There.

984
01:04:00,956 --> 01:04:02,663
I'm ready now, Mr. Kolenkhov.

985
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:05,870
Good. We go to work.
We'll roll up the carpet, Ed.

986
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:19,572
-I got a new piece. Can I play it?
-There are no new pieces.

987
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:22,986
Play that Brahms' Hungarian dance.
I feel so good.

988
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:26,026
Life is running around inside of me
like a squirrel.

989
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,276
Well, my Pavlova, now we work.

990
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,941
Kolenkhov always said
art is 110 percent sweat.

991
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,016
That is better.

992
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,630
-Ready, Eddie?
-Yes, sir.

993
01:04:51,403 --> 01:04:52,520
Pirouette.

994
01:05:05,271 --> 01:05:07,009
Faster, Eddie.

995
01:05:17,732 --> 01:05:19,636
Mrs. Sycamore, please.

996
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,830
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby.

997
01:05:26,094 --> 01:05:27,874
-Faster.
-Mrs. Sycamore.

998
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:36,650
-Mrs. Sycamore.
-Go away, Rheba. I'm busy now.

999
01:05:36,774 --> 01:05:40,872
-Pull your stomach in a little, Mr. DePinna.
-I know, but, Mrs. Sycamore....

1000
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,570
Oh, my.

1001
01:05:50,684 --> 01:05:51,718
Oh, darling.

1002
01:05:51,802 --> 01:05:54,617
Please, all those.

1003
01:05:56,273 --> 01:05:57,597
Here, dear.

1004
01:05:59,253 --> 01:06:00,453
Take that.

1005
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:07,409
-Are we too early?
-I'll say.

1006
01:06:10,431 --> 01:06:12,252
It's perfectly all right.

1007
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,439
Why, of course. Only we thought it was
to be tomorrow night.

1008
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:18,131
-Tomorrow night?
-That's funny.

1009
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:23,718
-Really, Tony, this is most embarrassing.
-No, we weren't doing a thing.

1010
01:06:23,885 --> 01:06:26,368
Just having a quiet evening at home.

1011
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:30,384
Yes, but don't let that bother you.
Please come in.

1012
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:32,454
Come in, won't you?

1013
01:06:32,537 --> 01:06:36,345
-This is Alice's mother.
-How do you do?

1014
01:06:36,387 --> 01:06:40,940
Alice's sister and Mr. Carmichael...

1015
01:06:41,355 --> 01:06:42,596
...her husband.

1016
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:46,280
And this is Mr. Kolenkhov.

1017
01:06:57,707 --> 01:07:01,556
And the discus thrower is Mr. DePinna.

1018
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,165
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

1019
01:07:04,206 --> 01:07:06,814
Excuse my costume. I'll take it right off.

1020
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,387
Jim.

1021
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:14,762
Alice.

1022
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:18,405
What is it?

1023
01:07:18,488 --> 01:07:21,758
Will you come down?
We have a big surprise for you.

1024
01:07:21,883 --> 01:07:23,124
Be right down.

1025
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:26,974
Won't you take your things off?

1026
01:07:27,058 --> 01:07:30,630
Will you take your father's coat?
Hang it up over there. Shall I....

1027
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:35,252
I'm very uncomfortable, Tony.
This is all very embarrassing.

1028
01:07:35,379 --> 01:07:37,690
Now, anybody can get mixed up.

1029
01:07:37,816 --> 01:07:40,043
A chair for Mrs. Kirby.
Get that out of the way.

1030
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:42,355
The rug, dear, the rug.

1031
01:07:42,439 --> 01:07:46,263
That one for Mrs. Kirby, I think.
And that one for Mr. Kirby.

1032
01:07:46,726 --> 01:07:48,701
Ed, get that chair.

1033
01:07:49,752 --> 01:07:51,018
Thank you.

1034
01:07:53,424 --> 01:07:56,639
-Thank you, Ed.
-Yes, sir.

1035
01:08:05,451 --> 01:08:09,426
What about some dinner
for these good people?

1036
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:12,397
After all, they did come for dinner,
you know.

1037
01:08:12,478 --> 01:08:14,606
-Please don't bother.
-It's no bother at all.

1038
01:08:14,687 --> 01:08:17,858
Tell Donald to run to Murphy's
and get half a dozen bottles of beer.

1039
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,063
And some canned salmon.

1040
01:08:19,145 --> 01:08:21,914
Wait a minute.
Mr. Kirby, do you like canned salmon?

1041
01:08:21,996 --> 01:08:23,561
Don't trouble, please. I'm not hungry.

1042
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:27,656
We're having frankfurters, but I don't think
there will be enough now that you've come.

1043
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:30,308
Make it frankfurters, and tell Donald to get--

1044
01:08:31,955 --> 01:08:35,126
Tell Donald to get a dozen more
and an extra can of corn.

1045
01:08:35,249 --> 01:08:37,496
-See if Rheba has enough sauerkraut.
-All right.

1046
01:08:37,578 --> 01:08:38,822
-Tell Donald to hurry.
-Yes.

1047
01:08:38,903 --> 01:08:42,676
It won't take long.
Murphy's delicatessen is right next door.

1048
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:44,122
The pipe.

1049
01:08:44,928 --> 01:08:47,015
This is Alice's father.

1050
01:08:47,618 --> 01:08:49,062
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby.

1051
01:08:49,144 --> 01:08:50,870
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

1052
01:08:50,912 --> 01:08:55,168
I hope you'll pardon my appearance.
I couldn't find my other pants in the cellar.

1053
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,339
It's quite all right.

1054
01:09:04,115 --> 01:09:06,246
Without holding!

1055
01:09:10,933 --> 01:09:12,186
Oh, my.

1056
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:16,618
What do you think, Alice?
They thought it was tonight.

1057
01:09:18,796 --> 01:09:20,550
Tony, don't you remember what....

1058
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:25,568
-Have you all met?
-Oh, yes.

1059
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:28,204
I'm so confused.

1060
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:31,091
I had such a nice party planned
for tomorrow night.

1061
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:33,347
Perhaps we can come back again
tomorrow night.

1062
01:09:33,391 --> 01:09:34,895
Yes, of course.

1063
01:09:35,023 --> 01:09:38,033
-Sit down, Mr. Kirby.
-Thank you.

1064
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:47,569
Mother, I guess we'd better see
about getting dinner.

1065
01:09:47,653 --> 01:09:49,826
Oh, that's all done, Alice.

1066
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,950
He didn't touch second.

1067
01:10:12,036 --> 01:10:14,585
Mother, what did you send out for?

1068
01:10:14,671 --> 01:10:17,890
Mr. Kirby should have told you
that he suffers from indigestion.

1069
01:10:17,976 --> 01:10:20,986
Now, Miriam. It isn't as serious as all that.

1070
01:10:21,112 --> 01:10:25,167
Perhaps it is not indigestion.
Perhaps it is stomach ulcers.

1071
01:10:27,552 --> 01:10:28,805
Ulcers?

1072
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:32,905
Don't pay any attention to Mr. Kolenkhov.

1073
01:10:33,241 --> 01:10:37,213
He's Russian and the Russians
are inclined to look on the dark side.

1074
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:42,107
All right, I'm Russian, but a friend of mine,
a Russian, died from stomach ulcers.

1075
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:48,129
Mr. Kolenkhov, Mr. Kirby has indigestion
and that's all.

1076
01:10:48,255 --> 01:10:50,262
All right, let him wait.

1077
01:10:50,388 --> 01:10:54,527
Please, folks.
Let's not discuss Mr. Kirby's ulcers.

1078
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:58,627
Grandpa, please talk about something else.
Ask Mr. Kirby about business.

1079
01:10:58,711 --> 01:11:00,509
I'll be right back.

1080
01:11:01,304 --> 01:11:05,527
As a matter of fact, Mr. Kirby,
how are business conditions?

1081
01:11:06,406 --> 01:11:07,533
What?

1082
01:11:07,744 --> 01:11:11,590
Well, that depends
on what side of the fence you're on.

1083
01:11:12,596 --> 01:11:15,188
Personally, I find an improvement.

1084
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:20,917
There are two schools of thought
on that subject, and I have no ulcers.

1085
01:11:21,504 --> 01:11:22,840
You wait.

1086
01:11:32,044 --> 01:11:36,099
-Do you mind if I smoke a cigar?
-Not at all. Of course not.

1087
01:11:49,316 --> 01:11:51,950
What about the unemployment problem?

1088
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:54,251
Unemployment?

1089
01:11:55,256 --> 01:11:58,015
Unemployment is not the main problem,
Mr. Vanderhof.

1090
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,186
No?

1091
01:11:59,354 --> 01:12:01,152
-Why, I thought--
-Yes, I know.

1092
01:12:01,278 --> 01:12:05,207
But that sort of viewpoint
is purely emotional, not economic.

1093
01:12:06,131 --> 01:12:08,639
Now, for instance, in 1929--

1094
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,841
My goodness, that's wonderful.

1095
01:12:18,512 --> 01:12:20,602
It really frightened you, didn't it?

1096
01:12:20,688 --> 01:12:22,527
Mr. Poppins.

1097
01:12:22,821 --> 01:12:24,535
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby.

1098
01:12:25,624 --> 01:12:27,923
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

1099
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:31,689
Mr. Poppins makes up these masks
as a sort of hobby.

1100
01:12:31,983 --> 01:12:33,738
Oh, really?

1101
01:12:33,824 --> 01:12:38,174
I think he ought to warn people
before he pops up in front of them like that.

1102
01:12:41,145 --> 01:12:43,570
Now, let me see. What can we talk about?

1103
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:47,252
-Have you any hobbies, Mr. Kirby?
-Business is my hobby.

1104
01:12:47,587 --> 01:12:50,431
-Grandpa plays the harmonica.
-Really?

1105
01:12:50,516 --> 01:12:52,564
Did you ever try one, Mr. Kirby?

1106
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:54,069
Well, I....

1107
01:12:54,155 --> 01:12:57,584
He used to be champion.
He won first prize at amateur night.

1108
01:12:57,711 --> 01:13:00,261
Told me so himself, didn't you, Dad?

1109
01:13:02,188 --> 01:13:05,868
Say, I bet you and I could do a mean duet.

1110
01:13:06,037 --> 01:13:08,545
I'm too busy a man
to fool around with harmonicas.

1111
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:10,386
Here we are.

1112
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:13,900
Did you get everything, Donald?

1113
01:13:14,027 --> 01:13:17,748
Yes. There weren't any more weenies,
so I got pickled pigs' feet.

1114
01:13:17,876 --> 01:13:20,426
Just take everything into the kitchen.

1115
01:13:20,552 --> 01:13:24,232
I'll have some scrambled eggs made for you,
and a plain salad.

1116
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:25,781
That'll be fine. Thank you.

1117
01:13:25,907 --> 01:13:27,369
Forgot the mustard.

1118
01:13:38,207 --> 01:13:41,971
That's that, I guess.
Fine impression we're making.

1119
01:13:42,223 --> 01:13:46,906
Tony, how could you make such a mistake?
You knew it was for tomorrow night.

1120
01:13:47,536 --> 01:13:50,380
Yeah, I guess it wasn't such a hot idea.

1121
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:53,811
You mean you did it on purpose?

1122
01:13:55,401 --> 01:13:58,536
Tony, that's dreadful.
How could you do such a thing?

1123
01:13:58,622 --> 01:14:02,260
I didn't want to bring them down here at all,
but you insisted.

1124
01:14:02,345 --> 01:14:05,439
If they have to meet you,
I want them to meet you as you are.

1125
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:08,736
Not on some trumped-up evening
with everybody acting unnaturally.

1126
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,237
There's nothing unnatural
in wanting them to like us.

1127
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:13,822
If they don't like you the way you are,
too bad.

1128
01:14:13,947 --> 01:14:16,865
It doesn't make any difference to me
what they think.

1129
01:14:16,949 --> 01:14:20,451
If you'd just left things alone,
everything would have been all right.

1130
01:14:20,534 --> 01:14:24,369
But, no, you had to go and get funny
and spoil everything.

1131
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:28,246
It was a pretty stupid idea, I know.

1132
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:31,707
But, Alice, I'm just trying to be honest
about this thing.

1133
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:35,751
I brought my family down here
just as they are, stuffed shirts and all.

1134
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:39,128
I'm not trying to put on an act with them.
Why should you?

1135
01:14:39,212 --> 01:14:44,256
I'm trying to be honest, too. Can't you
understand? I've got to get their approval.

1136
01:14:44,382 --> 01:14:48,759
I'm not going to stand for your mother
looking at me as if I were a thief.

1137
01:14:48,843 --> 01:14:50,885
What do you think I am, a goop?

1138
01:14:51,469 --> 01:14:53,053
Start the eggs, Rheba.

1139
01:14:54,429 --> 01:14:56,888
Have you any hobbies, Mrs. Kirby?

1140
01:14:57,389 --> 01:14:59,890
Well, as a matter of fact, I have.

1141
01:15:00,725 --> 01:15:02,892
I'm a student of occultism.

1142
01:15:03,018 --> 01:15:05,352
-What's that?
-That's spiritualism, dear.

1143
01:15:05,436 --> 01:15:08,771
Spiritualism?
Why, Mrs. Kirby, I'm surprised.

1144
01:15:08,813 --> 01:15:12,982
-Everybody knows spiritualism is a fake.
-I beg your pardon?

1145
01:15:13,107 --> 01:15:16,400
Now, Penny. You mustn't criticize
other people's hobbies.

1146
01:15:16,484 --> 01:15:20,277
-You got one or two of your own, you know.
-Yes, but not silly ones.

1147
01:15:32,452 --> 01:15:32,993
The perfect hobby should improve the body
as well as the mind.

1148
01:15:32,994 --> 01:15:36,454
The perfect hobby should improve the body
as well as the mind.

1149
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:40,623
The Romans were great people. Why?
What was their hobby? Wrestling.

1150
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:44,542
In wrestling you must think quick
with the mind and act quick with the body.

1151
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:47,293
Yeah. I agree with you.

1152
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:50,462
When I was young, I was pretty good at it.

1153
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:54,006
-But, unfortunately, as one grows older--
-Foolishness.

1154
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:56,007
Once a wrestler, you never forget.

1155
01:15:56,132 --> 01:15:59,675
I have not done it for six years,
but I forget nothing.

1156
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:00,927
Look.

1157
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:14,766
What's happening in here?

1158
01:16:19,351 --> 01:16:21,310
Sit down, Mr. Kirby.

1159
01:16:25,562 --> 01:16:28,730
-Where are my glasses?
-Here they are.

1160
01:16:28,814 --> 01:16:31,148
Mr. Kirby, they're broken.

1161
01:16:31,231 --> 01:16:34,982
I am sorry, but when you wrestle again,
Mr. Kirby, you will of course...

1162
01:16:35,066 --> 01:16:36,274
...not wear your glasses.

1163
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:41,277
-I do not intend to wrestle again, sir.
-That was very silly, Kolenkhov.

1164
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:43,070
I'm sorry you did that.

1165
01:16:45,363 --> 01:16:47,113
I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby.

1166
01:16:48,656 --> 01:16:51,240
If you don't mind, I think we better be going.

1167
01:16:51,324 --> 01:16:54,116
-That's the best idea I've heard yet.
-Please don't go.

1168
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:56,992
You're absolutely right, Mrs. Kirby.
I think you should go.

1169
01:16:57,076 --> 01:17:01,077
The whole thing was a mistake.
I'm terribly sorry for everything.

1170
01:17:02,036 --> 01:17:04,120
Alice, let me stay. I want to talk to you.

1171
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:06,663
I'd rather you didn't.
There's nothing to talk about.

1172
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,081
-Good night, Mrs. Kirby.
-Good night.

1173
01:17:09,165 --> 01:17:12,749
Good night, Mr. Kirby.
I hope you didn't get hurt.

1174
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:16,209
No. It's a pleasure to have met all of you.

1175
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:18,210
-Tony, come on.
-Alice, I--

1176
01:17:19,878 --> 01:17:21,712
-Will I see you tomorrow?
-I don't know.

1177
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,171
-But I--
-Good night, Tony.

1178
01:17:26,297 --> 01:17:27,672
Good night.

1179
01:17:31,174 --> 01:17:34,342
-Stay right where you are, everybody.
-For heaven's sake.

1180
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:35,968
What's this all about?

1181
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,968
-Which one is it?
-That one over there.

1182
01:17:38,052 --> 01:17:39,469
Who? Me? What do you mean?

1183
01:17:39,553 --> 01:17:43,513
-Look here. We don't belong in this house.
-Keep your mouth shut, you.

1184
01:17:44,513 --> 01:17:45,513
What's your name?

1185
01:17:45,597 --> 01:17:47,931
Ed Carmichael, and I haven't done anything.

1186
01:17:48,056 --> 01:17:50,598
See here. This seems very high-handed.

1187
01:17:50,724 --> 01:17:53,850
-What's it all about?
-Police Department.

1188
01:17:54,184 --> 01:17:55,434
J-men.

1189
01:17:56,352 --> 01:17:59,019
-G-men, Penny.
-Ed, what have you done?

1190
01:17:59,103 --> 01:18:01,395
Nothing. I told you
somebody was following me.

1191
01:18:01,521 --> 01:18:04,355
But these people don't belong here.
Please let them go.

1192
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:06,314
Don't let anybody out that door.

1193
01:18:06,398 --> 01:18:09,315
This is outrageous.
Do you realize who I am?

1194
01:18:09,566 --> 01:18:12,900
-What's your name?
-Beton Batopevitch Kolenkhov.

1195
01:18:13,734 --> 01:18:16,110
-Where are you from?
-Omsk.

1196
01:18:22,363 --> 01:18:24,905
-Where?
-Omsk.

1197
01:18:29,616 --> 01:18:32,117
-These stairs lead to the cellar?
-Yes, they do.

1198
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:34,118
Look out, Chief.

1199
01:18:38,703 --> 01:18:42,371
-What do you call this?
-It's called the New Monster.

1200
01:18:42,538 --> 01:18:45,247
Oh, playing boogieman, huh?

1201
01:18:45,581 --> 01:18:47,915
Yeah. Get over there.

1202
01:18:47,999 --> 01:18:51,083
He must've gotten out
of the wrong side of the bed this morning.

1203
01:18:51,167 --> 01:18:52,459
Mike, Bill.

1204
01:18:52,543 --> 01:18:54,001
Take a look.

1205
01:18:56,044 --> 01:18:57,544
Come here, you.

1206
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:04,798
-Ever see these before?
-Yes, sir. I printed lots of them.

1207
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:08,007
-Oh, you print this stuff?
-Yes, sir.

1208
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:12,009
And you put them into candy boxes
to get them into people's homes?

1209
01:19:12,135 --> 01:19:14,886
-Oh, my Love Dreams.
-But I didn't mean anything.

1210
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:17,136
-You didn't?
-No, sir.

1211
01:19:17,387 --> 01:19:20,721
-"Watch for the Revolution."
-Radicals.

1212
01:19:21,138 --> 01:19:23,388
"The Red Flag will sweep the country."

1213
01:19:23,431 --> 01:19:25,890
I didn't mean that.
I just like to print, that's all.

1214
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:30,226
Oh, see here.
The government isn't in any danger from Ed.

1215
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:33,685
Why, printing is just his hobby. That's all.

1216
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,728
He'd print anything.

1217
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:37,520
It's just like a play, isn't it?

1218
01:19:37,604 --> 01:19:39,688
Now, look here, young man.

1219
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:42,897
Don't be so silly. I must get my pipe.

1220
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:45,899
We were right. There is enough gunpowder
to blow up the town.

1221
01:19:45,941 --> 01:19:47,149
-We only use that--
-Shut up.

1222
01:19:47,233 --> 01:19:48,900
Everybody here is under arrest.

1223
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,276
-What's that?
-I must get it.

1224
01:19:50,401 --> 01:19:51,818
Stay right here.

1225
01:19:51,943 --> 01:19:54,110
-I must get it.
-You stay right where you are.

1226
01:19:54,236 --> 01:19:55,694
But it's lit.

1227
01:19:58,738 --> 01:20:01,239
-What's that?
-The fireworks.

1228
01:20:03,615 --> 01:20:04,907
Jim.

1229
01:20:04,991 --> 01:20:06,991
-Anthony.
-Miriam, run!

1230
01:20:07,117 --> 01:20:09,576
-Grandpa!
-Keep your shirts on.

1231
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:11,910
The Revolution!

1232
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:05,517
Home again.

1233
01:21:07,309 --> 01:21:10,268
Just like Siberia. Only it stinks.

1234
01:21:10,394 --> 01:21:12,811
It was fun being fingerprinted, wasn't it?

1235
01:21:12,895 --> 01:21:15,854
Mr. Kirby didn't think so.
It took three men to hold him down.

1236
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:20,565
Never a dull moment, that's what I say,
never a dull moment.

1237
01:21:20,649 --> 01:21:22,358
I can walk alone.

1238
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:25,025
I never heard of anything so outrageous
in my life.

1239
01:21:25,151 --> 01:21:26,151
Never mind the argument.

1240
01:21:26,234 --> 01:21:29,610
Stop pushing me around, fools.
I'm Anthony P. Kirby. You hear me?

1241
01:21:29,694 --> 01:21:31,027
Okay, I'm George Washington.

1242
01:21:31,111 --> 01:21:34,445
I want a telephone.
I want to call my attorneys, you numbskulls.

1243
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:37,072
We've made two calls for you already.
Keep your shirt on.

1244
01:21:37,197 --> 01:21:40,990
-But this is Mr. Kirby, the banker.
-Yeah, well, that ain't my fault.

1245
01:21:41,074 --> 01:21:44,242
Night court's in session right now.
He'll have to wait his turn.

1246
01:21:44,326 --> 01:21:47,280
-I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby.
-You're sorry.

1247
01:21:47,363 --> 01:21:49,485
That's something
after what I've been through.

1248
01:21:49,569 --> 01:21:52,440
After all, you did come on the wrong night.

1249
01:21:52,523 --> 01:21:55,227
The mayor will hear of this
and so will the commissioner.

1250
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:58,182
-I'll have you all fired!
-Dad, don't get excited.

1251
01:21:58,266 --> 01:21:59,680
In a couple of hours--

1252
01:21:59,764 --> 01:22:03,925
I hope you're satisfied with your mother
in there with a lot of cheap, common--

1253
01:22:04,009 --> 01:22:06,547
Pipe down, big shot. We want music.

1254
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,877
Hit it up, Pop, and make it hot.

1255
01:22:57,732 --> 01:23:00,520
Listen, Matron, I'm Mrs. Kirby.
Mrs. Anthony P. Kirby.

1256
01:23:00,603 --> 01:23:03,099
I'll give you $100
if you'll get me a private room.

1257
01:23:03,183 --> 01:23:07,053
-We have those for the insane cases.
-Please, she doesn't belong here with us.

1258
01:23:07,178 --> 01:23:11,089
Have her throw a couple of fits, lady,
and I'll try to fix it.

1259
01:23:11,173 --> 01:23:15,625
Mrs. Kirby, please, believe me, I'm so sorry
to have gotten you into all these troubles.

1260
01:23:15,709 --> 01:23:18,746
I'll appreciate it
if you'll leave me strictly alone.

1261
01:23:18,872 --> 01:23:21,909
Don't let her get you, sister.
They're getting tougher every place.

1262
01:23:22,034 --> 01:23:23,948
Where you been operating?

1263
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,694
You got class. That's the connection
I'm looking for.

1264
01:23:27,777 --> 01:23:30,981
Wasn't it exciting in that car
with the sirens screaming?

1265
01:23:34,102 --> 01:23:38,762
You better sit on your hands, Mrs. Kirby.
It gets kind of cold after you sit awhile.

1266
01:23:38,846 --> 01:23:43,007
All right, but don't say I didn't tell you
when you begin to feel it.

1267
01:23:43,424 --> 01:23:44,922
Oh, good heavens.

1268
01:23:45,546 --> 01:23:49,582
Come down off your high horse.
It'll do you some good.

1269
01:23:49,707 --> 01:23:52,411
If you don't mind,
I don't need anyone to do me good.

1270
01:23:52,496 --> 01:23:54,743
Never can tell. I know a good--

1271
01:23:54,826 --> 01:23:56,865
Let her alone. Can't you see she's a lady?

1272
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:59,528
A lady? They sure get around nowadays.

1273
01:24:02,025 --> 01:24:05,270
You needn't waste your time trying
to protect me. That won't help you.

1274
01:24:05,396 --> 01:24:08,017
If you had any sense,
you'd stay where you belong...

1275
01:24:08,101 --> 01:24:10,181
...and stop being ambitious.

1276
01:24:11,596 --> 01:24:13,676
Shall I sock her, Alice?

1277
01:24:14,259 --> 01:24:17,588
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1278
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:39,394
Spend a quarter of a million dollars a year
for attorneys and I can't get one of them.

1279
01:25:05,361 --> 01:25:07,857
Young man, will you get me
some bicarbonate of soda?

1280
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:09,105
What flavor?

1281
01:25:12,727 --> 01:25:16,430
Well, I've got you to thank for this.
I hope it will teach you a lesson.

1282
01:25:16,513 --> 01:25:18,094
Fooling around with stenographers.

1283
01:25:18,178 --> 01:25:22,422
-Now, listen, Dad. I intend to marry that girl.
-Yes, I know.

1284
01:25:23,005 --> 01:25:27,582
I was going to marry a waitress once,
but my father knocked it out of me.

1285
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:29,289
If you'll excuse me, Mr. Kirby.

1286
01:25:29,372 --> 01:25:29,746
I don't believe anyone has the right
to interfere with young people in love.

1287
01:25:29,747 --> 01:25:34,241
I don't believe anyone has the right
to interfere with young people in love.

1288
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,111
-Why don't you relax?
-Relax?

1289
01:25:37,195 --> 01:25:40,024
With my son practically being stolen
from under my nose.

1290
01:25:40,108 --> 01:25:43,728
Me being locked up like a common criminal.
Relax!

1291
01:25:43,812 --> 01:25:46,683
You know what will happen
if the newspapers get hold of this?

1292
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:49,347
It'll jeopardize the biggest deal of my career.

1293
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:50,928
Stop worrying.

1294
01:25:51,344 --> 01:25:56,212
If I know my granddaughter, she isn't
going to marry Tony without your blessing.

1295
01:25:56,379 --> 01:26:00,540
The only thing you've got to be concerned
about is this big deal of yours.

1296
01:26:00,624 --> 01:26:02,871
What if it does fall through?

1297
01:26:02,954 --> 01:26:05,575
What if all your deals fall through?

1298
01:26:05,826 --> 01:26:08,738
-Might be a good thing for you.
-Man, you're crazy.

1299
01:26:08,822 --> 01:26:12,941
Well, maybe I am,
but I used to be just like you once.

1300
01:26:13,607 --> 01:26:16,769
Then one morning,
when I was going up in the elevator...

1301
01:26:16,853 --> 01:26:19,724
...it struck me I wasn't having any fun.

1302
01:26:20,057 --> 01:26:23,386
So I came right down and never went back.

1303
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,923
Yes, sir. That was 35 years ago.

1304
01:26:27,049 --> 01:26:29,753
Admirable.
And you haven't done a thing since?

1305
01:26:29,878 --> 01:26:33,706
Oh, yes. Just the things I wanted to do.

1306
01:26:34,123 --> 01:26:35,745
Collected stamps.

1307
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:40,531
Went to the zoo when I got the notion,
took up the harmonica again...

1308
01:26:40,906 --> 01:26:44,526
...and even found time
to notice when spring came around.

1309
01:26:44,776 --> 01:26:49,894
This would be a fine country if we
visited the zoo and played the harmonica.

1310
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:53,681
You used to play one yourself.
Tony said so.

1311
01:26:54,389 --> 01:26:56,760
Maybe you ought to take it up again.

1312
01:26:57,010 --> 01:27:01,753
Maybe it would stop you trying to be
so desperate about making more money...

1313
01:27:01,879 --> 01:27:03,585
...than you can ever use.

1314
01:27:04,043 --> 01:27:07,496
You can't take it with you, Mr. Kirby.
So what good is it?

1315
01:27:08,204 --> 01:27:13,655
As near as I can see, the only thing you can
take with you is the love of your friends.

1316
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:17,525
Why don't you go out
and get yourself a pulpit somewhere?

1317
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:19,689
I'm sorry.

1318
01:27:19,939 --> 01:27:22,186
-Which one is Vanderhof?
-Right here.

1319
01:27:22,728 --> 01:27:25,432
Hello, Mr. Vanderhof. Remember me?

1320
01:27:25,849 --> 01:27:27,097
Twitch-face.

1321
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:32,048
Yes, I heard that you were in trouble
and came over to see if I could help you out.

1322
01:27:32,132 --> 01:27:34,171
Why should you want to help me?

1323
01:27:34,255 --> 01:27:37,167
To tell you the truth,
I thought that if I did you a favor--

1324
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:40,954
You're wasting your time,
Mr. Twitch, Mr. Blakely.

1325
01:27:41,371 --> 01:27:46,087
-I have no intention of selling my home.
-We'll see how long you can hold out.

1326
01:27:46,213 --> 01:27:48,467
Wait till a few more things happen to you.

1327
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:52,765
-So you arranged this arrest?
-Yes, and it's just a starter.

1328
01:27:52,849 --> 01:27:56,438
By the time I get through,
you'll be willing and glad to sell.

1329
01:27:57,316 --> 01:27:59,319
So you did this?

1330
01:28:00,655 --> 01:28:01,740
Why, Mr. Kirby.

1331
01:28:01,824 --> 01:28:04,078
You blockhead.
Do you know what you've done?

1332
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:08,001
But, Mr. Kirby, I never dreamed
that you knew these people.

1333
01:28:08,127 --> 01:28:12,426
I told you the police were on their trail.
You told me to make them sell.

1334
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:14,012
You blithering idiot, get out.

1335
01:28:14,138 --> 01:28:16,725
If you've got any sense left,
you'll dig up my attorneys.

1336
01:28:16,851 --> 01:28:20,023
-I've been here for hours.
-Yes, sir. I'll phone them all.

1337
01:28:22,653 --> 01:28:25,574
So, you're the one
that's been holding up my deal?

1338
01:28:26,827 --> 01:28:30,375
-Yes. Kind of funny, isn't it?
-What's funny about it?

1339
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:36,594
The idea of you engineering this thing
and being caught in your own trap.

1340
01:28:37,262 --> 01:28:40,893
Maybe it won't be so funny
when I take that house away from you.

1341
01:28:41,478 --> 01:28:45,568
Now I begin to see what's been going on.
That's a fine trick, Mr. Vanderhof.

1342
01:28:45,611 --> 01:28:48,992
Using my son to get information,
and then making me pay through the nose.

1343
01:28:49,117 --> 01:28:51,454
-Wait--
-I won't pay for anything I don't want to.

1344
01:28:51,496 --> 01:28:54,668
-I'll show you business the Kirby way.
-Business?

1345
01:28:54,794 --> 01:28:57,632
You're not a businessman.
You're like a lion in the jungle.

1346
01:28:57,674 --> 01:29:00,095
I've got the longest
and the sharpest claws, too.

1347
01:29:00,137 --> 01:29:03,977
That's how I got on top,
and scum like this is still in the gutter.

1348
01:29:06,022 --> 01:29:07,524
You're an idiot, Mr. Kirby.

1349
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:09,361
-What?
-A stupid idiot.

1350
01:29:09,487 --> 01:29:12,074
-You can't talk to me like that.
-Yes, I can.

1351
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,660
Scum, are we?

1352
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:17,543
What makes you think
you're such a superior human being?

1353
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:21,174
Your money? If you do,
you're a dull-witted fool, Mr. Kirby.

1354
01:29:21,258 --> 01:29:23,094
And a poor one at that.

1355
01:29:23,178 --> 01:29:26,099
You're poorer than any of these people
that you call scum.

1356
01:29:26,183 --> 01:29:29,772
Because I'll guarantee
at least they've got some friends.

1357
01:29:29,857 --> 01:29:33,947
But you, with your jungle and long claws,
as you call them...

1358
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:39,331
...you'll wind up your miserable existence
without anything you can call a friend.

1359
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:45,509
You may be a high mogul to yourself,
Mr. Kirby, but to me you're a failure.

1360
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:50,810
A failure as a man,
a failure as a human being...

1361
01:29:50,936 --> 01:29:53,440
...even a failure as a father.

1362
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:58,616
When your time comes, I doubt
if a single tear will be shed over you.

1363
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,329
The world will probably cry
"good riddance."

1364
01:30:01,789 --> 01:30:05,503
That's a nice prospect, Mr. Kirby.
I hope you'll enjoy it.

1365
01:30:05,587 --> 01:30:10,679
I hope you'll get some comfort out
of this coin you've been sweating over then.

1366
01:30:19,278 --> 01:30:20,864
I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby.

1367
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:24,955
I haven't lost my temper like that
in 30-odd years.

1368
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:27,293
Don't know what came over me.

1369
01:30:29,046 --> 01:30:31,383
I didn't mean anything I said.

1370
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:35,223
I wish you'd told me
to mind my own business.

1371
01:30:36,559 --> 01:30:39,981
If there's any way I could make up for it...

1372
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,447
...l would.

1373
01:30:43,488 --> 01:30:46,994
Here, how'd you like to have my harmonica?

1374
01:30:48,205 --> 01:30:51,544
It's a new one and good, too.

1375
01:30:53,298 --> 01:30:55,885
You might want to play it sometime.

1376
01:30:57,848 --> 01:31:01,312
After all, who am I to criticize anybody?

1377
01:31:01,396 --> 01:31:05,528
All right, everybody out for night court.
Have your slips ready.

1378
01:31:06,738 --> 01:31:08,574
I'm Mr. Kirby's attorney. Where is he?

1379
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:11,204
-Kirby.
-Yes, Kirby, Kirby.

1380
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:15,754
Oh, yes. They're just going to be arraigned.
Right through there.

1381
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,307
Wonder what he's so excited about.

1382
01:31:23,894 --> 01:31:26,231
Attorney for Mr. Kirby.
Has he been arraigned yet?

1383
01:31:26,315 --> 01:31:29,069
-Not yet. Right through that door.
-Thank you.

1384
01:31:31,282 --> 01:31:32,450
Kirby?

1385
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:34,162
Anthony P. Kirby.

1386
01:31:34,246 --> 01:31:38,461
-Is that Anthony P. Kirby, the banker?
-It's Kirby, the banker, you know.

1387
01:31:38,545 --> 01:31:41,508
Just a minute, please.
Yes, that's Anthony P. Kirby.

1388
01:31:41,593 --> 01:31:43,137
That's all we wanted to know.

1389
01:31:43,221 --> 01:31:44,514
Oh, boy.

1390
01:31:45,473 --> 01:31:48,727
-What did you say your name was?
-Anthony P. Kirby.

1391
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:53,024
Psychopathic ward.

1392
01:31:55,235 --> 01:31:55,443
I sentence you to 31 days in the city jail...

1393
01:31:55,444 --> 01:31:59,073
I sentence you to 31 days in the city jail...

1394
01:31:59,157 --> 01:32:01,743
...but I'll suspend 30 days of that sentence...

1395
01:32:01,827 --> 01:32:05,539
...if you give me your word
that as soon as you get out tomorrow...

1396
01:32:05,623 --> 01:32:07,542
...you'll go back to your folks in Kansas.

1397
01:32:07,626 --> 01:32:11,422
-Thank you, sir, thank you.
-That's all right, run along.

1398
01:32:12,841 --> 01:32:15,135
Your Honor, would you take
the Vanderhof case next?

1399
01:32:15,219 --> 01:32:16,261
Why?

1400
01:32:16,345 --> 01:32:18,597
We just found out
that one of them is A.P. Kirby.

1401
01:32:18,681 --> 01:32:20,057
-The banker?
-Yes.

1402
01:32:20,142 --> 01:32:21,268
What are the charges?

1403
01:32:21,351 --> 01:32:24,855
Disturbing the peace and manufacturing
fireworks without a license.

1404
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:26,107
Fireworks?

1405
01:32:26,858 --> 01:32:30,654
You mean to tell me that A.P. Kirby
has been held in the drunk tank?

1406
01:32:34,326 --> 01:32:36,662
Is that why
all these spectators are here tonight?

1407
01:32:36,787 --> 01:32:38,789
No. They are Vanderhof's friends.

1408
01:32:38,915 --> 01:32:41,626
I didn't know anybody had
that many friends anymore.

1409
01:32:41,668 --> 01:32:44,087
-Do the newspapermen know?
-I don't think so.

1410
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:45,297
That's good.

1411
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:49,428
What a holiday they'd have if they knew
A.P. Kirby was in the drunk tank.

1412
01:32:49,762 --> 01:32:52,265
Bring them in right away.
No use crucifying him.

1413
01:32:52,348 --> 01:32:55,560
-Bring in the Vanderhofs.
-Vanderhof case next.

1414
01:33:00,358 --> 01:33:02,527
Get away from me. Have you seen the--

1415
01:33:02,653 --> 01:33:04,029
Hello, Grandpa.

1416
01:33:04,155 --> 01:33:05,823
Hello, Grandpa.

1417
01:33:13,333 --> 01:33:14,667
Order. Order.

1418
01:33:18,047 --> 01:33:19,340
Quiet.

1419
01:33:20,008 --> 01:33:21,009
Order.

1420
01:33:26,099 --> 01:33:30,229
Your Honor, in arresting Mr. and Mrs. Kirby
and their son, a grave blunder was made...

1421
01:33:30,312 --> 01:33:31,563
...and we would suggest--

1422
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:35,610
-Do all four of you represent Mr. Kirby?
-Yes, Your Honor.

1423
01:33:36,612 --> 01:33:39,615
Quite an array of talent for a misdemeanor.

1424
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:43,453
If there's any objection
to Mr. Kirby being represented by counsel--

1425
01:33:43,579 --> 01:33:47,333
Not at all.
In fact, this court feels quite flattered.

1426
01:33:48,335 --> 01:33:49,711
Thank you.

1427
01:33:51,338 --> 01:33:53,465
The charge is disturbing the peace.

1428
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:56,094
-How do you plead?
-Not guilty, of course.

1429
01:33:56,178 --> 01:33:57,346
Of course.

1430
01:33:57,596 --> 01:34:00,975
Mister, are you represented,
or any of your people, by counsel?

1431
01:34:01,059 --> 01:34:02,769
No, sir.

1432
01:34:03,562 --> 01:34:09,611
I guess we're disturbing the peace if one
took the trouble to make a complaint.

1433
01:34:10,571 --> 01:34:14,283
And if it's against the law
to manufacture fireworks without a license...

1434
01:34:14,367 --> 01:34:19,081
...l guess we're guilty of that, too,
because we've been doing it a long time.

1435
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,212
I don't feel guilty, do you, Essie?

1436
01:34:24,296 --> 01:34:25,881
Order, order, please.

1437
01:34:26,215 --> 01:34:29,260
Mr. Vanderhof,
on the charge of disturbing the peace...

1438
01:34:29,344 --> 01:34:33,140
...you and the rest of your family are,
by your own plea, guilty.

1439
01:34:33,224 --> 01:34:36,186
-However, I shall suspend sentence.
-Thank you.

1440
01:34:36,269 --> 01:34:40,816
But, the manufacturing of explosives
without a license, I'm sorry...

1441
01:34:41,401 --> 01:34:44,446
...l'm forced to fine you $100.

1442
01:34:46,491 --> 01:34:48,076
$100!

1443
01:34:48,952 --> 01:34:50,579
That's a lot of money.

1444
01:34:52,081 --> 01:34:56,002
Your Honor, Mr. Kirby,
who is noted for his charitable work...

1445
01:34:56,128 --> 01:34:59,173
...would like to pay the fine
for this poor unfortunate family.

1446
01:34:59,298 --> 01:35:02,552
Oh, no, thank you. I can't let you do that.

1447
01:35:02,677 --> 01:35:06,473
No, you don't. Grandpa don't need
your money. We'll pay that fine.

1448
01:35:10,228 --> 01:35:12,814
Order, order! Order in the court.

1449
01:35:17,362 --> 01:35:18,863
Order, order.

1450
01:35:24,413 --> 01:35:28,209
No, it's all right, Officer.
It's all right. Let them come in.

1451
01:35:35,552 --> 01:35:36,886
We'll pay the fine.

1452
01:35:37,554 --> 01:35:39,306
We don't need your money.

1453
01:35:40,933 --> 01:35:44,520
A whole hatful, Grandpa. A whole hatful.

1454
01:35:49,611 --> 01:35:51,238
We'll get it, Grandpa.

1455
01:35:59,415 --> 01:36:01,667
There you are, Judge, is that enough?

1456
01:36:01,793 --> 01:36:03,461
Yes, I think so.

1457
01:36:04,755 --> 01:36:07,633
Take the money over to the clerk's desk.

1458
01:36:10,178 --> 01:36:13,598
Mr. Vanderhof, you're a very lucky man
to have so many friends.

1459
01:36:13,682 --> 01:36:14,724
Yes.

1460
01:36:14,809 --> 01:36:17,312
-How about it, Lieutenant?
-You can't come in here.

1461
01:36:17,395 --> 01:36:19,731
Come on, will you?
Let us take just one flash.

1462
01:36:19,815 --> 01:36:21,275
Now, gentlemen.

1463
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:25,238
I'd like to dismiss the charges
against the Kirbys of disturbing the peace...

1464
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:29,577
...but they were present at the arrest
and if these people were guilty...

1465
01:36:29,661 --> 01:36:32,873
...then I must naturally assume
that the Kirbys were guilty also.

1466
01:36:32,957 --> 01:36:34,543
Your Honor, that's absurd.

1467
01:36:34,626 --> 01:36:37,506
Unless they can explain
what they were doing there.

1468
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:39,720
Don't say a word, Anthony.

1469
01:36:40,263 --> 01:36:41,849
I'm afraid they've got you, Mother.

1470
01:36:41,933 --> 01:36:45,439
Do you realize, Your Honor,
that this gentleman is Mr. A.P. Kirby?

1471
01:36:45,481 --> 01:36:47,443
I've been made to realize that fact.

1472
01:36:47,485 --> 01:36:51,910
Perhaps Mr. Anthony P. Kirby himself
can explain what they were doing there.

1473
01:36:51,994 --> 01:36:54,791
-Well, Your Honor--
-I don't think that's important.

1474
01:36:54,833 --> 01:36:56,836
Haven't we been embarrassed enough?

1475
01:36:56,921 --> 01:37:01,346
It seems to me a little more respect
should be shown for our position.

1476
01:37:01,513 --> 01:37:03,683
Your Honor,
this charge is absolutely ridiculous.

1477
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:07,943
Failing a satisfactory explanation,
I shall be obliged to have them stand trial.

1478
01:37:08,026 --> 01:37:10,155
-But--
-They have the right to be heard.

1479
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,409
Your Honor, please.

1480
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:16,334
Mr. Kirby came to see me
about buying my house.

1481
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,680
-About buying your house?
-Yes.

1482
01:37:22,722 --> 01:37:27,189
He's been interested in the property
for some time now and....

1483
01:37:27,691 --> 01:37:30,571
He just came to talk over the deal.

1484
01:37:30,613 --> 01:37:31,865
That's all.

1485
01:37:31,907 --> 01:37:36,541
That's why we were there, and I don't
see why we should be held accountable...

1486
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:39,589
...for anything that these people
might have done.

1487
01:37:39,923 --> 01:37:41,759
-That's not true.
-Now, Alice.

1488
01:37:41,844 --> 01:37:45,935
Grandpa, I won't stand
for our being humiliated like this.

1489
01:37:46,019 --> 01:37:48,941
They're ashamed to admit
they came to look my family over...

1490
01:37:48,983 --> 01:37:51,780
...to see if I was good enough
to marry their precious son.

1491
01:37:51,822 --> 01:37:55,913
-I never heard anything so silly in my life.
-That's the reason we were there.

1492
01:37:55,997 --> 01:37:57,583
It's about time you spoke up.

1493
01:37:57,667 --> 01:38:00,464
I've decided that it's your family
that isn't good enough.

1494
01:38:00,548 --> 01:38:04,597
I wouldn't be related to a bunch of snobs
like that for anything in the world.

1495
01:38:04,681 --> 01:38:07,853
Your mother's all in a dither
because of her social reputation.

1496
01:38:07,937 --> 01:38:11,235
-That's telling them, Alice.
-Who do they think they are?

1497
01:38:12,071 --> 01:38:13,156
Order!

1498
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:18,375
Your reputation's safe,
and so is your son's, and your old man's.

1499
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:19,501
What's up?

1500
01:38:19,586 --> 01:38:22,717
Cinderella just told Prince Charming
to go take a flying leap.

1501
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,805
-How about we take a flying leap?
-That's a good idea.

1502
01:38:26,182 --> 01:38:27,643
Order in the court.

1503
01:38:28,979 --> 01:38:31,650
Order. Officer, put these men out.

1504
01:38:38,248 --> 01:38:41,462
The next time you go slumming,
stay away from our neighborhood.

1505
01:38:41,546 --> 01:38:42,923
Alice, please.

1506
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,692
Order.

1507
01:38:56,075 --> 01:38:57,160
Order.

1508
01:39:40,664 --> 01:39:42,876
Alice should've told us
where she was going.

1509
01:39:43,002 --> 01:39:45,089
Don't you think so, Essie?

1510
01:39:58,115 --> 01:40:00,035
Any word from her yet?

1511
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:06,381
I've been all over town.
The detective agency worked all night on it.

1512
01:40:06,465 --> 01:40:10,097
They've checked every hotel
for 100 miles around.

1513
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,564
Mrs. Sycamore, will you please tell me
where she is?

1514
01:40:14,648 --> 01:40:16,067
I don't know, Tony.

1515
01:40:16,151 --> 01:40:18,781
Even if I did, I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you.

1516
01:40:18,865 --> 01:40:20,033
If I wrote her a letter--

1517
01:40:20,117 --> 01:40:23,582
She doesn't want to see you.
That's why she went away mostly.

1518
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:26,755
There's no use you coming here anymore,
or trying to find her.

1519
01:40:26,839 --> 01:40:29,844
You'll only make things worse for her.
For us, too.

1520
01:40:36,316 --> 01:40:38,403
I guess that's that.

1521
01:40:43,372 --> 01:40:46,002
-We're awfully sorry, Tony.
-Thank you, sir.

1522
01:40:57,442 --> 01:40:59,946
Boy, I sure do feel sorry for Tony.

1523
01:40:59,988 --> 01:41:02,117
Rheba say you want something to eat,
somebody?

1524
01:41:02,243 --> 01:41:04,246
No, I'm not hungry, are you?

1525
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:08,379
I ought to be cleaning up the cellar.
It's in an awful mess.

1526
01:41:15,853 --> 01:41:18,691
Look here, everyone.
Here's a letter from Alice.

1527
01:41:18,818 --> 01:41:19,945
Really?

1528
01:41:20,028 --> 01:41:21,990
-How is she?
-Where did you get it?

1529
01:41:22,032 --> 01:41:25,163
Ned, the postman, chased me
down the street and gave it to me.

1530
01:41:25,247 --> 01:41:28,252
He recognized her handwriting.
I've read it, Penny.

1531
01:41:28,504 --> 01:41:29,505
Read it aloud, Penny.

1532
01:41:29,589 --> 01:41:33,054
-Where's it from, Mother?
-Wait a minute. My hands are shaking.

1533
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:36,185
She's staying with Helen,
that school friend in Riverside.

1534
01:41:36,269 --> 01:41:38,857
That's in Connecticut, isn't it, Grandpa?

1535
01:41:38,899 --> 01:41:40,694
Read the letter, Mother.

1536
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,238
Now, let me see.

1537
01:41:42,281 --> 01:41:45,746
"And I was so miserable and confused
I had to do something.

1538
01:41:45,788 --> 01:41:47,917
"I do hope you'll understand.

1539
01:41:48,043 --> 01:41:50,923
"It's peaceful here and I've thought it all out.

1540
01:41:51,007 --> 01:41:55,557
"I know now the situation
between Tony and me is impossible.

1541
01:41:55,975 --> 01:42:00,442
"Mrs. Kirby was right.
I should have stayed in my own backyard.

1542
01:42:01,444 --> 01:42:04,616
"Don't worry about me, Mother.
I'll get over it.

1543
01:42:04,659 --> 01:42:07,497
"But, my darlings, I'm so lonesome for you.

1544
01:42:07,623 --> 01:42:10,002
"I don't know how I can stand it.

1545
01:42:10,462 --> 01:42:14,428
"Last night I cried myself to sleep,
and that helped a little.

1546
01:42:15,347 --> 01:42:19,521
"But this morning when I woke up
and realized I wasn't in my own bed....

1547
01:42:23,613 --> 01:42:28,247
"I wish I could rush back home.
But how can I, if I want to forget?

1548
01:42:29,458 --> 01:42:33,966
"The newspapers, Tony and a million things
make it impossible.

1549
01:42:35,554 --> 01:42:37,641
"Forgive me, my darlings.

1550
01:42:37,725 --> 01:42:42,818
"I promise to write every day,
sometimes twice or even more.

1551
01:42:44,154 --> 01:42:47,410
"Please, everybody,
take good care of yourselves.

1552
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:50,834
"Don't let anything happen to you.

1553
01:42:51,252 --> 01:42:53,047
"All my love, Alice."

1554
01:42:54,968 --> 01:42:59,304
Sounds to me like she's not coming back.

1555
01:43:00,013 --> 01:43:00,388
Mr. Blakely, please.

1556
01:43:00,389 --> 01:43:01,848
Mr. Blakely, please.

1557
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:04,058
Mr. Blakely?

1558
01:43:04,142 --> 01:43:07,811
Dad, you don't mean
you're thinking of selling the house?

1559
01:43:07,895 --> 01:43:09,396
Alice is right.

1560
01:43:09,521 --> 01:43:13,315
She can never come back here.
It would only make her miserable.

1561
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:18,695
I won't let her live alone.
We'll find a place up there with her.

1562
01:43:19,362 --> 01:43:22,322
Mr. Blakely, this is Vanderhof.

1563
01:43:22,407 --> 01:43:24,992
Do you still want to buy the house?

1564
01:43:27,244 --> 01:43:29,537
You'll only pay $25,000 now.

1565
01:43:29,996 --> 01:43:32,748
Well, all right. Certainly, today.

1566
01:43:32,915 --> 01:43:35,542
All right, that's all. Goodbye.

1567
01:43:37,419 --> 01:43:42,297
Well, we had to leave this house sometime,
anyway.

1568
01:43:45,801 --> 01:43:48,136
I had a hard time,
but I made the old codger sell.

1569
01:43:48,261 --> 01:43:51,054
-Mr. Kirby's got all 1 2 blocks, solid.
-We can go ahead.

1570
01:43:51,097 --> 01:43:53,473
We've got the Vanderhof property.
Line up Kincaid now.

1571
01:43:53,599 --> 01:43:57,560
If that old gent hadn't sold,
the whole deal would've been blocked.

1572
01:43:58,144 --> 01:44:02,647
To all tenants in the 1 2-block area.
Notice. You are hereby notified that--

1573
01:44:02,773 --> 01:44:07,151
"You are notified that 10 days from this date
your premises must be vacated."

1574
01:44:07,277 --> 01:44:10,904
-That's the same as I've got.
-That certainly doesn't give us much time.

1575
01:44:10,988 --> 01:44:12,113
No.

1576
01:44:12,197 --> 01:44:15,866
Look. The Jensens must have gotten
their notice. Let's go see.

1577
01:44:20,871 --> 01:44:24,832
-Mr. Jensen, did you get one of these?
-Sure. We have to get out in 10 days.

1578
01:44:24,916 --> 01:44:27,042
-We all have to move.
-I can't understand it.

1579
01:44:27,126 --> 01:44:31,129
Grandpa said if they couldn't buy his house,
nobody would have to move.

1580
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:32,547
Look.

1581
01:45:00,445 --> 01:45:02,446
Sorry, Mr. Kirby can't be disturbed.

1582
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:04,031
I think it's all over, don't you?

1583
01:45:04,115 --> 01:45:06,617
Hello? Sorry, Mr. Kirby's not available.

1584
01:45:08,368 --> 01:45:11,453
Hello. He's not answering his phone.
Sorry.

1585
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:12,580
I've just been upstairs.

1586
01:45:12,664 --> 01:45:16,625
All our board members are there,
and the heads of those six little companies.

1587
01:45:16,667 --> 01:45:18,501
This merger's going to make history!

1588
01:45:18,627 --> 01:45:21,003
The market doesn't know
whether to buy or sell.

1589
01:45:21,087 --> 01:45:23,338
I hope we're right.
I have everything sunk in this.

1590
01:45:23,423 --> 01:45:26,236
-Stop bellyaching. We can't miss.
-Where's Kirby?

1591
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:28,925
-In there. We've been waiting for him.
-Who's with him?

1592
01:45:28,968 --> 01:45:31,699
Nobody. He's probably bowing
to the other Kirbys on the wall.

1593
01:45:31,781 --> 01:45:34,181
Hello. No.
Tell the senator to keep his shirt on.

1594
01:45:34,264 --> 01:45:38,112
-Kirby wants him to stay in Washington.
-No newspapers until after the meeting.

1595
01:45:38,237 --> 01:45:40,761
Ramsey make trouble for us?
You're crazy. He's broke.

1596
01:45:40,885 --> 01:45:43,160
He's finished.
Kirby hasn't even left him carfare.

1597
01:45:43,202 --> 01:45:44,857
You've got to hand it to the old man.

1598
01:45:44,982 --> 01:45:47,133
How he squeezed down on old Ramsey,
beautiful.

1599
01:45:47,216 --> 01:45:50,195
It wouldn't surprise me
if he were to blow his brains out.

1600
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,437
They're waiting up there.

1601
01:45:51,479 --> 01:45:54,085
Get Kirby and get this over with
before something happens.

1602
01:45:54,127 --> 01:45:57,230
-Good idea.
-Wait, you know he doesn't like that.

1603
01:45:57,313 --> 01:45:58,554
Look at the time.

1604
01:45:58,596 --> 01:46:01,202
I'll get him on the phone.
Maybe he won't mind that.

1605
01:46:01,286 --> 01:46:03,768
Get me Mr. Kirby in the conference room.

1606
01:46:33,687 --> 01:46:35,549
Hello. Yeah.

1607
01:46:35,632 --> 01:46:38,652
Certainly. Well, come on.
What are you waiting for?

1608
01:46:41,053 --> 01:46:43,825
They're waiting upstairs.
We'd better be getting up there.

1609
01:46:43,908 --> 01:46:46,142
-Have you got your proxies?
-Including Kincaid's.

1610
01:46:46,225 --> 01:46:48,873
When we offered him presidency,
he jumped at it.

1611
01:46:48,956 --> 01:46:49,907
You offered what?

1612
01:46:49,991 --> 01:46:53,301
I explained you wanted to be
the chairman of the board of directors.

1613
01:46:53,384 --> 01:46:55,825
Tell him it's a mistake.
I've chosen the president.

1614
01:46:55,908 --> 01:46:57,894
Anthony Kirby, Jr. is to be president.

1615
01:46:57,977 --> 01:46:59,880
-Tony? He's much too young, A.P.
-Is he?

1616
01:46:59,964 --> 01:47:02,943
-What about our promise to Kincaid?
-Forget about him.

1617
01:47:03,026 --> 01:47:05,922
-But, we have obligations--
-I said, forget about him.

1618
01:47:06,005 --> 01:47:09,646
Now, please, Mr. Ramsey,
Mr. Kirby is very busy and he--

1619
01:47:14,902 --> 01:47:18,336
Well, Mr. Kirby,
I suppose you're very proud of yourself.

1620
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:22,542
Another victory.
The greatest of your career.

1621
01:47:23,042 --> 01:47:25,165
What do you want, Ramsey?

1622
01:47:25,208 --> 01:47:27,040
You know something.

1623
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:30,704
I actually thought of coming here
to ask for mercy...

1624
01:47:31,288 --> 01:47:34,203
...but I couldn't figure out a basis
on which to do it.

1625
01:47:34,286 --> 01:47:36,326
Certainly not friendship.

1626
01:47:36,493 --> 01:47:39,199
Once, a long time ago,
that might have been possible...

1627
01:47:39,325 --> 01:47:42,948
...but you destroyed that, Anthony.
Remember?

1628
01:47:43,448 --> 01:47:45,238
Look at me, Anthony.

1629
01:47:45,364 --> 01:47:48,695
Tomorrow the world will read
that Ramsey is broke.

1630
01:47:49,029 --> 01:47:50,986
Doesn't that please you?

1631
01:47:51,028 --> 01:47:55,484
I've seen men jump out of windows for less,
but I'm going to fool you, Anthony...

1632
01:47:55,858 --> 01:47:59,397
...because I've suddenly realized
I haven't lost a thing...

1633
01:47:59,523 --> 01:48:02,646
...that I never gained
one moment's happiness out of it.

1634
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:05,728
And I warn you, Anthony,
and neither will you.

1635
01:48:06,686 --> 01:48:08,476
In spite of your victories...

1636
01:48:08,518 --> 01:48:11,974
...you can't shut out
every decent impulse and survive.

1637
01:48:12,683 --> 01:48:16,639
You're top-heavy with power right now,
but you'll crack under it.

1638
01:48:16,889 --> 01:48:19,262
You're bound to crack under it.

1639
01:48:19,887 --> 01:48:23,510
You know what is going to happen,
Mr. Anthony P. Kirby?

1640
01:48:24,343 --> 01:48:28,715
You'll scream for help and suddenly
find yourself alone in the world.

1641
01:48:29,174 --> 01:48:32,838
You'll wiggle on the hook
and find that nobody gives a hang.

1642
01:48:32,922 --> 01:48:35,837
I know because that's what happened to me.

1643
01:48:36,046 --> 01:48:37,711
And it will happen to you.

1644
01:48:37,795 --> 01:48:40,710
That's what happens
to all men like us, Anthony.

1645
01:48:40,793 --> 01:48:43,708
It's coming to us, it's coming to us.

1646
01:49:06,738 --> 01:49:09,736
-He's taking it kind of hard.
-Always was a weak sister.

1647
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:10,861
Sounded crazy to me.

1648
01:49:10,944 --> 01:49:13,942
-They're waiting upstairs. Let's get up.
-Come along.

1649
01:49:14,068 --> 01:49:16,525
Go upstairs and start things.
I'll be up in a minute.

1650
01:49:16,608 --> 01:49:19,314
-But they're waiting.
-I'll be up in a minute.

1651
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:34,973
-Hello, Dad. May I come in?
-Hello, Son. Come on in.

1652
01:49:35,598 --> 01:49:37,013
How are you?

1653
01:49:37,805 --> 01:49:41,428
Glad to see you. Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

1654
01:49:42,469 --> 01:49:46,300
You know what I always said
about the Kirbys and Tennyson's brook.

1655
01:49:46,467 --> 01:49:47,674
They go on forever.

1656
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,965
If you're talking about
the meeting upstairs...

1657
01:49:50,091 --> 01:49:54,088
-...l know all about that. Congratulations.
-Thank you, but that's nothing at all.

1658
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:55,462
There's more to it than that.

1659
01:49:55,504 --> 01:49:58,960
When I get through with them upstairs,
there will be a new president.

1660
01:49:59,003 --> 01:50:03,375
-Do you know who that's going to be?
-I know you're going to be busy, so I....

1661
01:50:05,291 --> 01:50:06,498
I'm quitting.

1662
01:50:08,331 --> 01:50:09,996
You're quitting?

1663
01:50:10,955 --> 01:50:13,328
I just handed in my resignation.

1664
01:50:13,453 --> 01:50:15,785
I've been thinking about it for a long time--

1665
01:50:15,869 --> 01:50:19,450
So, you're quitting.
What are you going to do?

1666
01:50:27,196 --> 01:50:30,152
I don't know. I think I'll go away for a while.

1667
01:50:31,028 --> 01:50:33,318
Try and get myself organized.

1668
01:50:37,024 --> 01:50:42,396
I'm was going to hang on to my job until
this thing with Alice got straightened out...

1669
01:50:43,105 --> 01:50:45,145
...but that's all over, so....

1670
01:50:45,895 --> 01:50:48,393
There is no use waiting for that.

1671
01:50:49,226 --> 01:50:51,349
I don't know, I....

1672
01:50:52,017 --> 01:50:56,056
I thought, maybe when I get back,
I could start to work on that grass thing.

1673
01:50:56,181 --> 01:50:59,637
You remember that thing Bob Smith and I
fooled around with in college?

1674
01:50:59,721 --> 01:51:00,845
Yes.

1675
01:51:01,595 --> 01:51:05,717
Dad, if you think it's funny, I'm sorry.
I came in here to say goodbye.

1676
01:51:09,091 --> 01:51:10,381
Goodbye?

1677
01:51:10,424 --> 01:51:12,672
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I'm serious.

1678
01:51:15,421 --> 01:51:17,586
I don't want any part of this, Dad.

1679
01:51:18,669 --> 01:51:19,876
I never did.

1680
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:23,832
You can't do this,
after all the plans I made for you--

1681
01:51:23,917 --> 01:51:26,498
If I can just make you understand this.

1682
01:51:26,582 --> 01:51:30,038
I think this business is great.
It's good for you because you like it.

1683
01:51:30,163 --> 01:51:33,411
I don't. And I never will.

1684
01:51:37,909 --> 01:51:42,406
I've tried to talk to you many times about it,
but I couldn't get it out.

1685
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:48,029
I used to be able to talk to you, Dad...

1686
01:51:48,071 --> 01:51:49,570
...but lately....

1687
01:52:08,935 --> 01:52:11,891
I'll probably be gone
before you get home tonight.

1688
01:52:17,306 --> 01:52:18,796
Goodbye, Dad.

1689
01:52:24,798 --> 01:52:26,288
Goodbye, Son.

1690
01:52:27,945 --> 01:52:32,995
Maybe when I get back, we can sit down
and have a good old-fashioned gabfest.

1691
01:52:35,355 --> 01:52:37,093
Yeah, yeah.

1692
01:53:05,865 --> 01:53:08,017
-Yes.
-It's about Mr. Ramsey, sir.

1693
01:53:08,183 --> 01:53:12,571
They just found him dead in the washroom.
The doctor said it was heart failure.

1694
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:22,258
Yes?

1695
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:26,067
-What did you say?
-They just found Mr. Ramsey dead.

1696
01:53:39,562 --> 01:53:43,536
A.P., they're getting impatient upstairs.
I can't hold them any longer.

1697
01:54:04,856 --> 01:54:06,263
Boardroom.

1698
01:54:10,073 --> 01:54:12,624
Get everything set. We're on our way up.

1699
01:54:20,698 --> 01:54:22,120
Hello, Mr. Kirby.

1700
01:54:22,204 --> 01:54:24,713
52nd.

1701
01:54:28,730 --> 01:54:29,855
52nd, sir.

1702
01:54:41,902 --> 01:54:43,027
Take me down.

1703
01:54:43,069 --> 01:54:44,569
-Down?
-Down?

1704
01:54:44,695 --> 01:54:47,071
-We can't postpone this meeting.
-Take me down.

1705
01:54:47,113 --> 01:54:49,697
We've been waiting on you for hours.

1706
01:54:56,158 --> 01:54:59,326
What's the matter, Mr. Kirby?
Is there something wrong?

1707
01:55:11,165 --> 01:55:13,666
Darned if I don't think
they enjoy this moving.

1708
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:16,376
Don't be silly. It's killing them.

1709
01:55:17,334 --> 01:55:21,043
It's certainly going to be gay around here
when you leave, Grandpa?

1710
01:55:21,128 --> 01:55:24,421
He found the cutest place
near where Alice is, right on the ocean.

1711
01:55:24,504 --> 01:55:27,338
-Lake, Penny. Lake.
-That's what I said, lake.

1712
01:55:27,422 --> 01:55:29,714
We'll invite you all up
to go deep-sea fishing.

1713
01:55:29,798 --> 01:55:33,299
-Gee, Mr. Kolenkhov, isn't it exciting?
-Exciting?

1714
01:55:33,383 --> 01:55:37,676
With you moving and the Grand Duchess
out of a job, where do I eat?

1715
01:55:51,891 --> 01:55:55,225
-Hello, Mr. Vanderhof.
-So you're here again.

1716
01:55:55,310 --> 01:55:57,894
Why won't you tell me where she is?

1717
01:55:57,978 --> 01:56:02,034
Because there's an unwritten law
in our family against snitching.

1718
01:56:02,117 --> 01:56:05,755
But look, Mr. Vanderhof, I just sort of feel...

1719
01:56:05,839 --> 01:56:08,306
...l can talk to you about this thing.

1720
01:56:09,937 --> 01:56:14,160
I've left my job
and I'm going away tonight, and I....

1721
01:56:14,411 --> 01:56:18,759
But I love Alice. And she loves me.
This whole thing is ridiculous.

1722
01:56:18,844 --> 01:56:22,482
I'm convinced, young man,
but you're not marrying me.

1723
01:56:22,775 --> 01:56:25,116
After all, Alice is the woman.

1724
01:56:26,831 --> 01:56:29,005
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1725
01:56:29,883 --> 01:56:33,019
I just thought I'd take a parting shot
before I left.

1726
01:56:33,187 --> 01:56:36,197
I have messed things up beautifully,
haven't I?

1727
01:56:36,323 --> 01:56:39,459
-Yes.
-Well, goodbye, sir.

1728
01:56:39,919 --> 01:56:44,267
The trouble with young squirts nowadays
is they have no imagination.

1729
01:56:45,397 --> 01:56:47,404
They don't use the old bean.

1730
01:56:47,948 --> 01:56:50,582
Well, I'll do anything you say, sir.

1731
01:56:51,251 --> 01:56:53,927
-You want to see Alice again, don't you?
-Yes.

1732
01:56:54,137 --> 01:56:57,315
-And we can't tell you where she is?
-Yes, no, sir.

1733
01:56:57,817 --> 01:57:02,576
There's a big trunk of Alice's upstairs
and they're going to take it where she is.

1734
01:57:02,699 --> 01:57:04,873
Just don't say another word.

1735
01:57:07,213 --> 01:57:08,485
Grandpa!

1736
01:57:10,701 --> 01:57:14,804
I came as soon as I got your telegram.
I'm too late. You've already sold the house.

1737
01:57:14,886 --> 01:57:19,645
-Of course I sold the house. I got tired of it.
-Grandpa, it's all my fault.

1738
01:57:19,687 --> 01:57:24,077
Alice, dear. Alice, we were coming to you.

1739
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:26,786
Now everybody on the block has to move,
don't they?

1740
01:57:26,868 --> 01:57:29,083
What about Grandma?
You're walking out on her.

1741
01:57:29,166 --> 01:57:31,956
Now, don't be childish, Alice.
The thing is done.

1742
01:57:32,038 --> 01:57:34,541
Now, go on upstairs and pack your things.

1743
01:57:35,198 --> 01:57:37,372
Alice, will you give me a chance
to talk to you?

1744
01:57:37,455 --> 01:57:40,614
They wanted the house and they got it,
the mighty Kirbys.

1745
01:57:40,697 --> 01:57:42,420
What are you doing here anyway?

1746
01:57:42,502 --> 01:57:45,620
Wait a minute. I've something to tell you.
I want you to listen.

1747
01:57:45,703 --> 01:57:46,769
Go ahead and scream.

1748
01:57:46,852 --> 01:57:49,108
That's the way you've gotten everything.

1749
01:57:49,191 --> 01:57:52,115
Scream your head off
and see what it gets you now.

1750
01:57:55,667 --> 01:57:56,920
Alice, Alice.

1751
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:58,842
Alice.

1752
01:58:08,453 --> 01:58:10,124
I sure feel sorry for Grandpa.

1753
01:58:10,208 --> 01:58:14,219
I walked in the room and he was looking
at a picture of Grandma and he was crying.

1754
01:58:14,345 --> 01:58:15,389
Crying?

1755
01:58:15,473 --> 01:58:20,403
He got sore, too, because he caught me
looking at him, and threw something at me.

1756
01:58:20,445 --> 01:58:23,787
There's only one thing worrying me.
Have they got relief up there?

1757
01:58:23,913 --> 01:58:26,420
Sure they have.
They've got relief everywhere now.

1758
01:58:26,545 --> 01:58:27,965
-There is?
-Yeah.

1759
01:58:28,092 --> 01:58:30,595
Let's get on up there then.

1760
01:58:32,597 --> 01:58:34,724
I guess we've moved everything out of here.

1761
01:58:34,808 --> 01:58:36,727
Yes, that's about all.

1762
01:58:43,152 --> 01:58:45,780
Here's one that didn't go off.

1763
01:58:54,458 --> 01:58:56,627
Be careful with it. Especially the typewriter.

1764
01:58:56,711 --> 01:59:00,549
I have a feeling that I'm going to do
my best work at our new place.

1765
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:05,013
Oh, Dad.

1766
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:09,560
Oh, now, Penny,
we've had enough wailing for one day.

1767
01:59:24,872 --> 01:59:29,544
-Do you mind if I come in?
-No, not at all. Come right in.

1768
01:59:36,261 --> 01:59:38,847
We aren't quite prepared for visitors, but....

1769
01:59:38,931 --> 01:59:41,517
Donald, put that chair down for Mr. Kirby.

1770
01:59:41,601 --> 01:59:44,729
Let me have that stool, too,
will you, Donald, please?

1771
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:47,984
Thank you.

1772
01:59:49,987 --> 01:59:53,950
-Mr. Vanderhof, could we be alone?
-Oh, sure. Penny.

1773
01:59:54,618 --> 01:59:55,744
Thank you.

1774
01:59:59,124 --> 02:00:01,627
I don't know, Grandpa is talking to him.

1775
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:09,302
Mr. Vanderhof, you once told me
I was a failure as a father.

1776
02:00:10,054 --> 02:00:13,975
-I didn't mean that.
-I know, but I am.

1777
02:00:15,436 --> 02:00:18,773
Tony's walked out on me
and it's just about wrecked me.

1778
02:00:19,983 --> 02:00:23,737
Mr. Kirby, you're beginning to act
quite human.

1779
02:00:25,157 --> 02:00:28,244
Look, you know about these things.
I don't.

1780
02:00:28,494 --> 02:00:32,248
-I need your advice. I'd give a fortune to--
-Now...

1781
02:00:32,916 --> 02:00:36,253
...you've got to stop thinking
in terms of fortune.

1782
02:00:37,422 --> 02:00:40,926
Do you know what I do
when I run smack into a crisis?

1783
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:46,099
I just take out my harmonica
and I play on it...

1784
02:00:46,142 --> 02:00:48,812
...until that crisis just fades away.

1785
02:00:48,978 --> 02:00:52,315
-Now, please don't joke about this--
-I'm not joking about it.

1786
02:00:52,358 --> 02:00:55,403
You asked my advice
and I'm giving it to you.

1787
02:00:55,487 --> 02:00:59,909
I think if we played a duet together,
you and I, on the harmonica....

1788
02:01:00,368 --> 02:01:03,955
-You brought it with you, didn't you?
-Well, I....

1789
02:01:04,582 --> 02:01:06,167
Oh, yes, fine.

1790
02:01:06,668 --> 02:01:11,924
Now, let's play a duet good and loud.
You'll be surprised at what might happen.

1791
02:01:13,927 --> 02:01:15,929
Let's see, what shall we play?

1792
02:01:16,764 --> 02:01:18,891
Do you know Polly Wolly Doodle?

1793
02:01:18,975 --> 02:01:21,227
-You ought to know it.
-Polly Wolly Doodle?

1794
02:01:21,311 --> 02:01:24,022
We drove you almost crazy with it once.

1795
02:01:28,654 --> 02:01:30,698
You know it, of course you do.

1796
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:35,954
Let's play it good and loud, and swing it.

1797
02:01:53,227 --> 02:01:54,812
What's that, Grandpa?

1798
02:01:55,021 --> 02:01:57,023
Come on, Essie, let's get hot.

1799
02:02:00,152 --> 02:02:01,361
Come on.

1800
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:28,055
My Russian wrestling friend, eh?

1801
02:03:34,939 --> 02:03:37,734
Magnificent, magnificent.

1802
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:40,070
Thank you.

1803
02:03:41,823 --> 02:03:45,285
-Is my son here?
-You'll be surprised.

1804
02:03:53,504 --> 02:03:54,880
Anthony.

1805
02:03:55,715 --> 02:03:58,176
Hello, Mother, come on.
You do the Big Apple, too.

1806
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:00,596
Mr. Sycamore, you show her
how to do the Big Apple.

1807
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,348
Come on. Why not?

1808
02:04:19,037 --> 02:04:20,580
Quiet, please.

1809
02:04:20,914 --> 02:04:22,749
Quiet.

1810
02:04:24,544 --> 02:04:26,713
Well, sir, here we are again.

1811
02:04:26,755 --> 02:04:31,719
We've had quite a time of it lately,
but it seems that the worst of it is over.

1812
02:04:31,844 --> 02:04:36,600
Of course, the fireworks all blew up,
but we can't very well blame that on you.

1813
02:04:37,435 --> 02:04:41,231
Anyway, everything's turned out fine
as it usually does.

1814
02:04:41,649 --> 02:04:43,985
Alice is going to marry Tony.

1815
02:04:44,277 --> 02:04:49,241
Mr. Kirby, who's turned out to be
a good egg, has sold us back our house...

1816
02:04:49,826 --> 02:04:53,622
...and he'll probably forget
all about big deals for a while.

1817
02:04:54,331 --> 02:04:59,420
Nobody on our block has to move.
And with the right handling...

1818
02:04:59,505 --> 02:05:03,676
...l think we can even thaw out
Mrs. Kirby in time.

1819
02:05:04,678 --> 02:05:08,849
We've all got our health,
and as far as anything else is concerned...

1820
02:05:08,975 --> 02:05:11,102
...we still leave that up to you.

1821
02:05:11,645 --> 02:05:12,729
Thank you.

1822
02:05:12,813 --> 02:05:14,314
Bring it on, Rheba.

1823
02:05:14,816 --> 02:05:17,402
Now it is two easy lessons, Mrs. Kirby....

1824
02:05:21,407 --> 02:05:23,034
No holds barred.

1825
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:25,496
I hope you like it, Mr. Kirby.
