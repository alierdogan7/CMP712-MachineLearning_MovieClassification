1091
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:18,065
Imagine Ernest Hemingway
sitting right over there...

1092
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,766
at the Café Florian...

1093
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,935
just sipping
a single malt...

1094
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,707
dreaming up his
next masterpiece.

1095
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:27,146
God!

1096
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,653
Those birds
are psychotic.

1097
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,781
History doesn't interest
you at all. Does it, baby?

1098
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,483
Huh?

1099
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,117
Yeah, it does.

1100
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,093
I wasn't an Art History
major though, so...

1101
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:42,130
You don't have to be
an Art History major...

1102
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,426
to appreciate art.

1103
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,400
- Whoa. Whoa.
- What?

1104
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,300
Do you hear that?

1105
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,872
The bells? No?

1106
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:50,905
Uhhhh.

1107
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:51,905
What is it, honey?

1108
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:52,906
Uhhhh.

1109
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,374
What?

1110
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,207
- What?
- Ah, ha ha ah.

1111
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:58,746
- What?
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1112
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,578
[Whispering]
What? What are we listening for?

1113
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,847
What? What is it?
I can help!

1114
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,422
It's a message
from God.

1115
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,458
- It's a message.
- God?

1116
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,821
[Crack, Crowd Roar]

1117
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:11,859
[Man]
And there's a ground ball...

1118
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,428
up the middle
for a base hit.

1119
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,589
Jackpot!

1120
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,165
[Laughs]

1121
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,236
Honey, we still have
to see the Tintorettos.

1122
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:21,894
Oh...

1123
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:23,404
Oh, the...

1124
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:26,907
the church art
is... unbelievable...

1125
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,104
but it all kind of
looks the same to me.

1126
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:34,282
Now you know I love sports.

1127
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,579
I mean,
I'm a sports freak.

1128
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:38,278
But how often
are we in Europe?

1129
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,289
How often are the Dodgers
on TV in Europe?

1130
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,927
You're right.
You go watch sports.

1131
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,862
I'll go see
the Tintorettos.

1132
00:57:58,107 --> 00:57:59,938
Honey?

1133
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,977
- Yeah?
- Is...

1134
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:04,069
Is this a loving act
of generosity...

1135
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,114
or am I going to pay
for this later?

1136
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,411
Does it make a difference?

1137
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,316
I'm going to make this
up to you, huge.

1138
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:12,854
Huge.

1139
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,981
Tonight, everything
is your choice.

1140
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:16,991
Dinner in a church
if you want.

1141
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:19,220
[Laughs]

1142
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,529
[Sarah]
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1143
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,033
- I love you.
- I love you.

1144
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,153
Oh!

1145
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:55,720
Grazie.

1146
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,493
Grazie. Grazie.

1147
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,534
Grazie, goddamn it!

1148
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,732
Buon giorno, Fredo.

1149
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,641
Oh, buon giorno,
Mr. Peter Prentiss.

1150
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,542
- Come sta?
- Bene. Bene.

1151
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,842
Peter?

1152
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,541
Peewee,
what a surprise!

1153
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:15,675
What are you
doing here?

1154
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,582
- In Venice?
- Yes.

1155
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:18,813
In Venice, yes.

1156
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,321
Nextron's buying out
Ferugia Chocolate...

1157
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:21,913
that deal that me and your
dad were working on...

1158
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,993
so they sent the kid in
to close the deal.

1159
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,390
Did you get that bottle
of cognac I sent?

1160
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,689
Uh, yes, I, uh...

1161
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,991
thought it a tad
inappropriate.

1162
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:32,158
I'm sor... I didn't, uh...

1163
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,361
I'm just trying to be
the gallant loser here.

1164
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,494
Peter...

1165
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,197
Why don't we celebrate
this great coincidence?

1166
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:38,205
We're in Venice.

1167
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:39,798
I'll take
you guys to dinner.

1168
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,139
I'm on my honeymoon.

1169
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,338
My... My honeymoon.

1170
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,847
- [Laughs]
- See? Yeah.

1171
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,212
I can be so thick
sometimes.

1172
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,649
Grazie.
I'm sorry.

1173
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:50,810
I got a lot of work
to do anyways...

1174
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,911
so I'm going
to disappear.

1175
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,512
You guys have fun.

1176
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,387
Oh, Peter, wait.

1177
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,787
Uh, I don't
mean to be rude.

1178
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,227
[Laughs]

1179
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,663
You couldn't be rude
if you tried.

1180
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,324
How's the honeymoon?

1181
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,367
It's good? It's a dream?

1182
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,403
It's great.

1183
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:10,438
Oh, yeah. Great.

1184
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,666
Where's Tom?

1185
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,672
Oh, he's, uh...

1186
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,265
at the, uh...

1187
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:15,344
the church with...

1188
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,538
Uh, with, uh...

1189
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,673
with... He's...
He's a huge history buff.

1190
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,909
Yeah.

1191
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,383
Wow.

1192
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:25,886
Well, see? It's good that
you guys share that passion.

1193
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,685
Oh, yeah... yeah.

1194
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,157
Well... Ha ha.

1195
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,557
Bye.

1196
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,892
[Laughs Nervously]

1197
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,933
Fredo...

1198
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,165
I need to know where
that little signora is...

1199
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,763
at all times.

1200
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,173
[Fredo]
Very bold, Mr. Prentiss.

1201
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,471
Grazie.

1202
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,609
[Tom]
Dodgers won.!

1203
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,311
Dodgers won.!

1204
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:01,151
The Dodgers won, honey.

1205
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,782
See...

1206
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,383
I knew you were going
to make me pay...

1207
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,553
for watching the game.

1208
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,392
No.

1209
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,898
No, it's not that.

1210
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,093
We need to talk.

1211
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:17,130
About what?

1212
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,674
Have you always
told me the truth?

1213
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:20,674
Yeah.

1214
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,369
Except the time
I told you...

1215
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:23,775
I liked your
brother Willie.

1216
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,245
- This is serious.
- I am serious.

1217
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,610
I really don't like him.

1218
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,684
Marriage is built
on honesty and trust.

1219
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,343
- I totally agree.
- Okay.

1220
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,182
Then did you ever
do something...

1221
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,516
that you wanted
to tell me about...

1222
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,955
but you couldn't because
you felt bad about it?

1223
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,356
And the more time went on...

1224
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,428
the harder it got
for you to tell me?

1225
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,123
And then it turned into
this big, fat lie...

1226
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,630
so you kept not
telling me about it...

1227
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:45,291
Did you
talk to Kyle?

1228
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,767
No. Why?

1229
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:48,928
No reason.

1230
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,801
Does Kyle know something
that I should know?

1231
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:51,805
No.

1232
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:52,840
You covered your nose.

1233
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:53,840
I had an itch.

1234
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,138
You were hiding
flared nostrils.

1235
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,337
What do you have to tell?

1236
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,180
Okay.

1237
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:03,980
It's just...

1238
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,783
when Bags died...

1239
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,357
he didn't
exactly die...

1240
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,324
the way that
I described it.

1241
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:16,194
Him chasing those squawking
pigeons off the balcony?

1242
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,823
Yeah, that.

1243
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,300
What happened?

1244
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,301
Well...

1245
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,532
Okay. I'm reading
my magazine...

1246
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,868
and I'm really...
I'm focusing...

1247
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,169
and I'm really into it...

1248
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,800
and along comes
Bags, you know?

1249
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,276
He comes trucking over...

1250
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:35,043
and he starts
tugging on my ankle.

1251
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,675
And I was like, "Bags.!"

1252
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,219
I'm... I'm...
I was like...

1253
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:41,222
I think I even said,
"I'm trying to focus."

1254
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:44,350
Like, don't...
And he looked up at me...

1255
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,223
and he was giving me
the look like...

1256
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:47,489
"Hey, are you gonna
play with me or not?"

1257
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,497
And I was like...

1258
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,328
"I reallyjust want
to read though, Bags. "

1259
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,163
And... I'm... and...

1260
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,032
he started pulling
on my ankle again.

1261
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,538
So, I grabbed the ball...

1262
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,005
and I was like,
"Go get it, buddy. "

1263
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,905
And I threw the ball
over my shoulder...

1264
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:01,942
and it went out
the window...

1265
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,274
and Bags dove,
and he died.

1266
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,110
You killed Bags?

1267
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:08,683
It was an accident.

1268
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,685
And you lied about it
all this time?

1269
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,119
Actually, it was
more of an omission.

1270
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,520
No, it was
more like a lie!

1271
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,684
Where are you going?

1272
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,785
I have to figure out
what to do with this.

1273
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,227
What does that mean?

1274
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,854
I can deal with you
being cheap...

1275
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,364
and I can deal with you
being a shitty driver.

1276
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:28,130
I cannot not deal
with you being a liar!

1277
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,727
Whoa. Wait a second.

1278
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,274
This whole thing started...

1279
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,468
with you wanting
to talk about something.

1280
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:37,410
Well, I don't want to
talk about it right now.

1281
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,275
So you're feeling guilty
about something too.

1282
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,580
Yes, there is something
I "omitted"

1283
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,415
that I don't want to
talk about right now.

1284
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:48,319
You want a marriage based
on trust and honesty?

1285
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:49,550
Well, here's your chance.

1286
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,887
Come on!

1287
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,052
Yeah, yeah, you got it.!
I can see it.!

1288
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,060
Bring it!

1289
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,597
I slept with
Peter Prentiss.

1290
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:02,671
What?

1291
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:03,864
I slept with Peter...

1292
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:06,203
I heard you.!

1293
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,571
I'm sorry.

1294
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,769
I need to hear everything.

1295
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:09,776
No, you don't.

1296
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,141
Yes, I do.
That's what I do.

1297
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,477
That's what I do.
I need to know everything.

1298
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,380
Where you were,
what he did...

1299
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:16,576
how small
his wiener was.

1300
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,653
Everything.!

1301
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,448
I was helping on an
appraisal in Seattle.

1302
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:20,647
I don't want
to hear it!

1303
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:25,858
You slept with that...

1304
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,190
It was a long time ago.

1305
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,194
When?

1306
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,229
- Before we...
- Got married?

1307
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,424
- Yes!
- Got engaged?

1308
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,693
- Of course!
- Got together?

1309
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,702
Yes. No. No.

1310
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,465
It was right
after we met.

1311
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,472
My parents were
pressuring me to.

1312
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,439
Aha...

1313
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,010
Imagine my surprise.

1314
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:45,746
I was confused.

1315
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:47,748
I'm in Seattle.

1316
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:48,976
He asked me out
to dinner.

1317
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,677
The champagne
is flowing...

1318
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:53,186
Please try not
to break into song.

1319
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:56,122
My feelings for you...

1320
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,819
were very, very strong...

1321
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,328
and I needed to know
that they were real.

1322
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,419
I wasn't brought up...

1323
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:05,022
to manage feelings
like that very well.

1324
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:06,066
Yeah...

1325
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:10,662
you had a real
tough upbringing.

1326
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,241
I need some air.

1327
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:15,901
Yeah? Me too!

1328
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,741
Happy now?
You broke it!

1329
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:19,848
Oh, by the way...

1330
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,177
Peter's staying
at the hotel.

1331
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,616
Ha ha! That's funny!

1332
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,085
- Hooker!
- Murderer!

1333
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:53,746
What's the score?

1334
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,908
[Girl] 3-2,
top of the ninth.

1335
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:00,244
Are you American?

1336
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:03,318
Good guess.

1337
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,454
[Sighs]

1338
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:40,059
Where's Tom?

1339
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,323
We don't feel the need...

1340
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,628
to be with each other
all the time.

1341
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:47,669
Okay.

1342
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,205
I just find it odd that...

1343
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:57,177
you're spending so much
time apart on your honeymoon.

1344
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:01,647
Are you okay?

1345
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:07,454
[Whispering]
Peter, just go. Please?

1346
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:09,649
Go.

1347
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:12,557
[Sniffles]

1348
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,637
Sarah. Sarah.

1349
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:32,976
Why are you
still here, Peter?

1350
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:34,777
I'm not going
to leave you here like this.

1351
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,044
Listen. I have a car,
all right?

1352
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,782
I'm having a quick drink
at a friend's house. Just...

1353
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,357
take a ride with me.

1354
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,619
You know,
catch your breath.

1355
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,093
I'll take you
back to Tom.

1356
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,331
Champagne?

1357
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:57,338
Sure.

1358
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,013
[TVAnnouncer]
And that's the ball game.!

1359
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,883
[Crowd Cheers,
Jukebox Plays]

1360
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:13,977
Oh, my God!

1361
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,751
Oh, my God!
I love this song!

1362
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:16,756
No, wait.

1363
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:17,757
I really
should go.

1364
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,851
I can't.
No, listen...

1365
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:22,089
Bernardo Salviati
can actually...

1366
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,996
trace his family
back to Machiavelli.

1367
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,001
Huh.

1368
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:40,274
[Sarah] Oh, wow.
That's a big house.

1369
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,542
Nextron's thinking
of buying it.

1370
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,210
Turn it into
a resort complex.

1371
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,099
Buon giorno, Bernardo!

1372
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,565
Peter, hello.

1373
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,067
Good to see you.

1374
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:04,298
Bernardo,
Sarah McNerney.

1375
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,839
Ciao, Bernie.

1376
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,267
Tell me, pretty one.

1377
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:10,743
What brings
you to Venice?

1378
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,575
I'm on my honeymoon.

1379
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:13,579
Your honeymoon?

1380
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:14,580
Yeah.

1381
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,344
But she's so young
to be married.

1382
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,716
Why does everyone
keep on saying that?

1383
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,550
Where's your husband?

1384
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,921
Oh, I'm going
to meet up with him...

1385
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:27,723
you know... later.

1386
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:28,956
Yeah.

1387
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:33,797
I was married for 27 years
before my wife pass away.

1388
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,632
Believe me...

1389
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,798
the first months
are the most difficult.

1390
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:43,067
[Laughs]

1391
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,669
Bernardo here's a...

1392
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,145
a little bit
of a romantic.

1393
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:47,977
Hmm.

1394
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,677
[Whispering]
I love that.

1395
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:52,310
Let's have a drink.

1396
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:53,854
[Laughs]

1397
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,253
Please.

1398
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:59,020
You're on the radio?
That's awesome!

1399
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:01,358
So...

1400
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:06,662
when are we gonna go back
to... neeno, neeno, neeno?

1401
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,066
Oh... Ha ha. Yeah.

1402
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:09,831
I... Uh, I can't do that.

1403
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:11,497
What?

1404
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,268
Don't tell me all
the cute conversation...

1405
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,434
and air humping
is leading nowhere!

1406
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,603
No! Oh...

1407
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,010
Ohhhh!

1408
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:20,809
Okay, you mean...

1409
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:24,283
when are we gonna...

1410
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,284
Ahhhhh.

1411
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,356
Okay. All right.

1412
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,152
So I'm gonna
go and hit the...

1413
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,193
and then we'll...

1414
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,285
do that thing.

1415
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,761
- Cool.
- Okay.

1416
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:37,331
I'll be waiting.

1417
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,440
Whoa!

1418
01:10:57,052 --> 01:11:00,283
[Groaning]
And the hits just keep on coming!

1419
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,489
Ciao.

1420
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,398
Can I get the, uh,
key to 309, please?

1421
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:17,404
Oh, and do you know
if my wife's up in the room?

1422
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:18,564
A good husband knows...

1423
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:20,733
where his wife
is at all time.

1424
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,903
[Chuckles]
And a good maître d'

1425
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:27,847
answers questions
when he's asked.

1426
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,514
[Chuckles]

1427
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,249
Look, I'm not gonna
pay you for an answer.

1428
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,917
In this case,
you should.

1429
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,769
Your wife is in a car...

1430
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:51,965
on her way
to Salviati's...

1431
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,302
with Mr. Prentiss.

1432
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:56,071
Mr. Peter Prentiss?

1433
01:11:57,513 --> 01:12:00,482
Hmm? Oh. Of course.

1434
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:02,140
What's Salviati's?

1435
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,309
One of the oldest...

1436
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:05,353
and most beautiful
