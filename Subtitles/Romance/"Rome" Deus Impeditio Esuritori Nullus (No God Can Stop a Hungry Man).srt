- AND CARTHAGE.
 - ( chuckles )

54
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,834
CARTHAGE WILL BE ANNEXED

55

POOR OCTAVIAN, EH?

57
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:31,834

REALLY DESPERATE.

58

PEOPLE ARE STARVING,
 DYING.

59
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:39,234
OCTAVIAN WILL DO
 WHAT HE MUST TO PREVENT
   FURTHER SUFFERING.

60
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,033
BECAUSE HE LOVES
 THE PEOPLE SO.

61
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,300
- HE DOES.
- HE LOVES NOBODY
 AND NOBODY LOVES HIM.

62
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,834
HE COULD FEED
  THE PEOPLE LARKS

66
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,167
YES, SIR.

69
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,367
I HAVE NO DOUBT
 YOU ARE RIGHT,

70
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:09,100
BUT WE DO HAVE
   AN AGREEMENT, YES?

71
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,567
YES.

72

- AND SPAIN.
 - SPAIN?

75
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:23,868

  YOU CAN'T HAVE SPAIN.

76

OH?

77
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:28,634
OH, THAT'S A SHAME.
   NO DEAL THEN.

78
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:32,367

VENISON FOR DINNER, THEN?

82
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:46,801
PLEASANT VOYAGE
HOME, BOYS.

83
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,667
GET HIM OUT
  OF HERE.

84
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,767
I'LL SHOW YOU
   TO YOUR QUARTERS.

85
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,467
- IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THAT?
   - LIKE WHAT?

86
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:15,300
WELL, IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE
THE LITTLE SHIT DECLARE WAR,

87
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,567
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WILL.

89
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,968
HE'S A CAUTIOUS BEAST.

90
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,400
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
SIMPLY CUT THE CORD

91
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,601
AND DECLARE WAR
YOURSELF.

92
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,334

   DECLARE WAR...

93
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,734

NO NO NO.

96

NO, THAT WOULDN'T DO.

97

WHEN I RETURN HOME

98
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,634
IT WILL BE AS
A SAVIOR,

- YOUR CALL.
 - YES, IT IS.

177
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:28,667
( grunting )

178
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,534
WHY ARE YOU WASTING
 VALUABLE FOOD ON HIM STILL?

179
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,667
LET THE POOR BASTARD DIE.

180
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,100
MEMMIO?

181
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,834
( groaning )

182
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:39,968
NO.
   HE REMINDS THE OTHER
   MEN TO STAY HONEST.

183
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:41,968
WHAT'S TO BE DONE,
  THEN?

184
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:47,567
FETCH MY BEST CLOTHES.
   I'LL SEE IF HIS HONOR
   HAS ANY IDEAS.

185
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,968
( grunting )

186
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,701
HEY!

187
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,367
QUIET, YOU.

188
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:59,601
- EH!
 - ( growling )

189
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,434
YOU FUCKING
 HAIRY BASTARD.

190
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:08,701
SO FAR IT'S JUST THE OLD
AND THE SICK THAT ARE DYING.

191
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,033
BUT BY NEXT MOON,
OUR GRANARIES WILL BE EMPTY.

192
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,501
I UNDERSTAND THAT DOGS
  MAKE GOOD EATING.

193
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,100
THEY DO.

194
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,234
TASTE LIKE PORK IF
YOU COOK 'EM RIGHT.

195
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,367
- <i>ALL GONE.</i>
   - AH, I WONDERED

196
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,334
WHY THE NIGHTS
 WERE SO PEACEFUL.

197
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,667
-NO BARKING.
  - THIS IS NO MOMENT FOR WIT.

198
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:29,267
I WISH THERE WERE
  SOMETHING I COULD DO.

199
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,767
BUT THE STATE GRANARIES
 ARE NEAR AS EMPTY AS YOURS.

200
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:34,601
I CAN ONLY GIVE TO YOU BY
  TAKING FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

201
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,200
THE MILITARY SILOS
ARE UNTAPPED.

202
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,067
AND THE ARMY NEEDS TO EAT.

203
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,834
WELL THEN, SEND THREE
   LEGIONS TO AFRICA.

204
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:42,667
LET LEPIDUS FEED THEM.

205
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:46,334
<i>THAT WOULD SUPPLY THE CITY</i>
  <i>WITH ENOUGH GRAIN FOR A MONTH.</i>

206
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,300
HAVE IT DONE.

207
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,667
IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY
   SOLUTION, BUT IT'S THE BEST
  WE CAN OFFER.

208
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:55,934
- I'LL SEND YOU
   WHAT WE CAN SPARE.
  - THANK YOU.

209
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,434
PULLO.

210
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,868
TELL ME WHAT
 THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING.

211
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:06,767
TELL ME WHO THEY BLAME
FOR THIS FAMINE.

212
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,567
YOU, THEY SAY.

213
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,501
<i>YOU'RE THE MAN IN CHARGE.</i>

214
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:15,868
NOT ANTONY?

215
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,067
THEY HEAR THE NEWS
READERS SAYING

216
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,734
THAT HE'S HOLDING BACK
THE SHIPMENTS AND ALL THAT.

217
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:22,834
BUT, WELL, IT'S ANTONY,
ISN'T IT?

218
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:27,100
<i>WHY WOULD HE STARVE THEM?</i>

219
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:30,400
THEY'VE ALWAYS LOVED HIM
  AND HE'S ALWAYS LOVED
  TO BE LOVED.

220
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,100
WHEREAS YOU...

221
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,934
WELL, YOU'RE YOU,
   AREN'T YOU?

222
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,934
COLD AND HEARTLESS?

223
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:42,501
I'LL NOT SAY THAT.

224
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,467
BUT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
 THE AFFECTIONATE TYPE,
  NOW HAVE YOU?

225
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:50,434
<i>THANK YOU, PULLO.</i>

226
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,968
I'LL BE HEARING ABOUT
 THE GRAIN THEN, WILL I?

227
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,234
AGRIPPA WILL
  SEE TO IT.

228
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:04,734
- PERHAPS BIBULUS WILL SUCCEED?
 - NO, HE WON'T.

229
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,501
ANTONY'S NOT
ENTIRELY IRRATIONAL.

230
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,234
GIVEN ENOUGH MONEY,
   WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE?

231
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,033
ANTONY'S NOT
MOTIVATED BY MONEY.

232
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,667
HE HOPES THE PEOPLE
WILL RISE UP IN ANGER
AND DEPOSE ME.

233
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:15,100
EITHER THAT,
   OR HE SIMPLY WISHES

234
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,801
TO PROVOKE ME
   INTO DECLARING WAR ON HIM.

235
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:19,167
HAS HE REALLY BECOME
   SO FOOLISH?

236
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:21,601
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S BECOME
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OUT THERE?

237
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,367
WHO KNOWS WHAT CLEOPATRA
WHISPERS TO HIM?

238
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,334
HE WAS ALWAYS A FOOL
 FOR HIS WOMEN.

239
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,267
IF HE WANTS A WAR,
 WHY NOT GIVE IT TO HIM?

240
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:31,067
HMM, YOU HEARD PULLO.

241
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,634
YOU MIGHT AS WELL DECLARE WAR
ON WINE AND SONG.

242
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:36,801
( chuckles )
NO NO NO.

243
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,834
<i>WAR ON ANTONY IS DOOMED</i>

244
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:40,801
<i>UNLESS THE PEOPLE</i>
   <i>E WITH US.</i>

245
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:43,334
SEND FOR MY MOTHER
   AND SISTER.

246
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,100
I SHALL HAVE DINNER
 WITH THEM THIS EVENING.

247
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,400
Girl:
  <i>GRANDMA?</i>

248
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,834
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

249
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:57,534
OH!

250
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,434
IT'S DANGEROUS.

251
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:02,567
ANTONIA,
 WHERE ARE YOU?

252
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:04,968
SHE'S UP HERE WITH ME.
  I'LL BRING HER DOWN.

253
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,300
YOU NAUGHTY GIRL.

254
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:10,701
WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU
ABOUT GOING ON THE ROOF?

255
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:16,334
I SWEAR ON DIANA, I SHALL
HAVE SOMEONE BEAT HER.

256
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,734
SHE DOESN'T LISTEN
TO A WORD I SAY.

257
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:21,701
OH, SHE'S A GOOD
GIRL, REALLY.  JUST LIKE
YOU WERE AT THAT AGE.

258
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,868
AND I TURNED OUT
SO WELL?

259
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:26,734
YOUR BROTHER, ON THE OTHER
  HAND, WAS AS BIDDABLE
  AS A SHEPHERD'S DOG.

260
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,534
NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

261
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:30,968
CASTOR, ARE THERE ANY
 LETTERS FOR ME TODAY?

262
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:33,033
NO, DOMINA.

263
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,801
STRANGE.

264
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:38,667
I HAD THE STRONGEST FEELING
 THAT TODAY WAS THE DAY.

265
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:41,968
MOTHER?
THERE WILL BE NO LETTER.

266
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,601
YOU'RE WRONG.

267
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,634
SORRY TO BE BLUNT,
  BUT--

268
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:50,534
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S TIME TO FACE FACTS?

269
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:52,567
ANTONY PROMISED HE WOULD
SEND FOR ME AND HE WILL.

270
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:54,968
EVEN IF HE DID, DO YOU THINK
OCTAVIAN WOULD LET YOU GO?

271
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,234
I DON'T GIVE A FIG.

272
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,200
TRULY, IS HE WORTH TORTURING
YOURSELF LIKE THIS?

273
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:03,267
DOMINA?

274
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:06,767
OCTAVIAN CAESAR
   SUMMONS YOU BOTH FOR
   DINNER THIS EVENING.

275
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:09,534
WHAT DOES HE WANT NOW,
I WONDER.

276
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,567
NOTHING TO OUR BENEFIT.

277
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,200
FAMILY AND FRIENDS, EH?

278
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:23,067
NOTHING BETTER.

279
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,601
OCTAVIA, I HAVE A FAVOR
 TO ASK OF YOU.

280
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,767
- ( coughs )
  - YOU ARE AWARE OF THE GRAIN
   SHORTAGE, I SUPPOSE?

281
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:41,567
YOU KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE
ARE DYING IN THE STREETS
FOR WANT OF BREAD?

282
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,868
AND YOU WANT ME
  TO FEED THEM?

283
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,968
IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING.

284
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:50,200
YOUR HUSBAND HAS PLENTY
OF GRAIN IN EGYPT.

285
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:53,667
BUT HE IS PLAYING POLITICS
WITH IT, HOLDING IT BACK.

286
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,834
IF YOU WERE TO
 GO AND TALK TO HIM...

287
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:00,100
I?

288
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:01,634
GO TO EGYPT?

289
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,934
THE SOFT VOICE
 OF A LOVING WIFE

290
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,601
MAY SUCCEED WHERE ALL
   ELSE HAS FAILED.

291
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,501
YOU ARE JOKING!

292
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,834
I CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST
  TIME I MADE A JOKE.

293
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:13,767
LAST MARKET DAY.

294
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:16,667
YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
   FISHES WHICH MADE ME LAUGH
QUITE DISTINCTLY.

295
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:18,968
I WAS SPEAKING
  FIGURATIVELY.

296
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:24,300
IF YOU ARE SERIOUS,
   IT IS NOT I WHO SHOULD GO,

297
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:28,000
BUT MOTHER.
  SHE'S HIS REAL WIFE.

298
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,667
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
  GO TOGETHER,

299
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:36,300
<i>ESENT ANTONY WITH BOTH</i>
    <i>REALITY AND APPEARANCE.</i>

300
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:37,868
OH.

301
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:40,901
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL,
 BUT...

302
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:44,634
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO TAKE
   A LONG SEA VOYAGE.

303
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,968
DO YOU?

304
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,667
NO.

305
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,467
BESIDES, WE'RE NOT HUNGRY.

306
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:52,100
AND WE NEED NO GRAIN.

307
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,834
SO WHAT'S IN IT
 FOR US?

308
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:58,667
HOW WILL YOU PAY US
FOR OUR TROUBLE?

309
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:01,133
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

310
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,968
HMM.

311
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:08,567
POMPEII'S BECOME VULGAR.

312
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,467
I'D LIKE A VILLA IN CAPRI.

313
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:12,834
THAT'S FINE.

314
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:15,400
WHAT ABOUT YOU, OCTAVIA?
DO YOU WANT A VILLA?

315
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,968
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

316
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,567
<i>A VILLA WOULD BE NICE.</i>

317
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:25,534
SOME GLADIATORS
  WOULD BE FUN AS WELL.

318
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:28,033
WHY NOT TAKE CASH
AND DECIDE LATER?

319
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,534
GOOD IDEA.

320
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:32,033
- CASH.
 - AS YOU WISH.

321
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,267
MAECENAS,
  HAVE THE NEWS READER

322
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,467
ANNOUNCE THEY ARE LEAVING
  AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

323
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,634
( moaning )

324
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:21,701
( groaning )

325
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,200
( gasping )

326
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,067
I LIKE BIRDS.

327
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:58,534
I DON'T LIKE EGGS.
THERE IS SOMETHING QUITE
   SORDID ABOUT EGGS.

328
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,367
<i>WE SHAN'T SERVE</i>
 <i>THEM ANYMORE.</i>

329
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:03,133
UNLESS YOU OBJECT,
   OF COURSE.

330
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:12,601
WHY ARE YOU SENDING
   ATIA AND OCTAVIA TO EGYPT?

331
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,000
YOU HEARD WHY.

332
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:18,467
WELL, YES, BUT THAT CAN'T
   BE THE REAL REASON.

333
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:20,801
YOU KNOW ANTONY WILL
  REFUSE WHAT THEY ASK.

334
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,567
IT'S VERY LIKELY.

335
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,968
OH.
  ( chuckles )

336
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:27,400
WHAT?

337
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,467
YOU CALCULATE...

338
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:32,367
THAT IF ANTONY TURNS
  OCTAVIA AWAY,

339
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:36,334
THE PEOPLE WILL FEEL THAT
   HE HAS PUBLICLY HUMILIATED
HIS DARLING WIFE,

340
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,100
THAT QUEEN CLEOPATRA
   HAS BEWITCHED HIM,

341
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,868
AND THEY WILL ALL
TURN AGAINST HIM.

342
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:43,767
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

343
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:46,634
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

344
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,200
IF ANTONY STILL LOVES ATIA

345
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,234
AND YIELDS TO HER PLEADING,

346
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
THEN SO MUCH THE BETTER.

347
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,834
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR GRAIN.

348
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,234
CLEVER BOY.

349
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,601
GOOD NIGHT, MY DEAR.

350
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,267
I WISH YOU'D
STOP THAT.

351
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,767
<i>WE'LL GET THERE NO FASTER.</i>

352
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:35,801
HAVE I CHANGED AT ALL,
 DO YOU THINK,

353
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,601
<i>SINCE HE LAST SAW ME?</i>

354
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,567
( sighs )
   NO.

355
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:41,467
YOU'RE JUST EXACTLY
  AS YOU WERE.

356
00:24:41,534 --> 00:24:45,033
<i>HE'LL FALL INTO YOUR ARMS</i>
 <i>IN A DELIRIUM OF LOVE.</i>

357
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,467
DO YOU MEAN THAT?

358
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:48,634
NO.

359
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,734
YOU'VE BECOME
  VERY MEAN, YOU KNOW.

360
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:54,234
MEAN AND BITTER.

361
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,868
YOU'VE BECOME GIRLISH
AND SENTIMENTAL.

362
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:01,634
- IT'S DISGUSTING, FRANKLY.
  - <i>( woman heaving )</i>

363
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:04,400
( panting )

364
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:10,334
<i>( man shouting )</i>

365
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,868
<i>( gulls calling )</i>

366
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,968
NO POINTS.
   NO POINTS.

367
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:25,200
I WASN'T READY.

368
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:28,634
- ( groans )
  - HA!

369
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,334
10 POINTS TO ME.

370
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,467
WELL DONE, MAJESTY.
WELL DONE.

371
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:34,033
- READY?
  - NO, WAIT!

372
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,501
I BEG THEE!
WAIT!

373
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,634
( whimpering )

374
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:40,968
USELESS OLD WOMAN.
GO AWAY.

375
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,734
VORENUS,
   PLAY WITH ME.

376
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:02,667
THROW IT PROPERLY.

377
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,367
( groans )

378
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:09,167
COME ON, THEN.

379
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,567
GOOD CATCH.

380
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:21,901
TELL ME MORE
ABOUT MY FATHER.

381
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:23,734
<i>I TOLD YOU ALL</i>
  <i>THAT I KNOW.</i>

382
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:27,167
YOU'VE TOLD ME ONLY WHAT
   EVERY FOOL KNOWS.

383
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:29,234
HE WAS A GREAT
SOLDIER,

384
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,167
THE PEOPLE LOVED HIM,
  BLAH BLAH BLAH.

385
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:36,067
TELL ME WHAT
 HE WAS LIKE AS A MAN.

386
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,834
WELL, HE WAS--

387
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:41,534
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

388
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,901
HE WAS A GOOD MAN
   TO HAVE AS A FRIEND.

389
00:26:44,968 --> 00:26:46,834
YOU WOULDN'T WANT HIM
  AS AN ENEMY.

390
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:49,567
HE HAD A NASTY TEMPER
  WHEN HE WAS ROUSED.

391
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:52,434
WHEN THE BATTLE WAS GOING HARD
 AND MEN WERE FALTERING,

392
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:55,934
THAT'S WHEN YOU'D WANT TO SEE
YOUR FATHER AT YOUR SIDE.

393
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,067
BRAVEST MAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

394
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,767
MORE.

395
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:06,033
FINE HORSEMAN.

396
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,300
BAD GAMBLER,
 THOUGH HE'D NEVER ADMIT IT.

397
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:10,901
HE LIKED THE WOMEN.

398
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:13,234
HE LIKED TO EAT.

399
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,534
<i>HE'D EAT THE WHOLE</i>
    <i>TABLE IF YOU'D LET HIM.</i>

400
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,434
REALLY?

401
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:19,701
I'VE ALWAYS HEARD
HE WAS VERY...

402
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:21,634
ABSTEMIOUSN HIS DIET.

403
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:24,434
YEAH, WELL,
  THAT WOULD BE RIGHT.

404
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:28,000
THERE'S OTHERS KNEW HIM
 FAR BETTER THAN I DID.

405
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,467
WHERE ARE THEY?

406
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:35,434
WHAT'S WRONG?

407
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,133
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
   HERE?

408
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,167
THEIR SHIP DOCKED
ANOUR AGO.

409
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:47,467
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY
TO THE PALACE NOW.

410
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:49,634
AND THEY REQUEST AN IMMEDIATE
   AUDIENCE WITH YOU!

411
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,601
HOW DELICIOUS.
WIFE AND LOVER COME
TOTHER TO SEE YOU.

412
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:56,033
HUSH, WOMAN.

413
00:27:57,434 --> 00:28:00,000
- WHAT DO THEY WANT?
  - I DON'T KNOW.

414
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:03,400
WHAT SHALL I TELL THEM?
THEY WILL BE HERE.

415
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:06,067
JUST, GIVE-- GIVE--

416
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,000
<i>GIVE ME TIME TO THINK.</i>

417
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:10,767
<i>NO.</i>

418
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:15,434
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE COME
OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.

419
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:18,634
OCTAVIAN MUST HAVE
SENT THEM HERE.

420
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:20,767
SENT THEM
   TO DO WHAT?

421
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:23,467
OH, WHY ELSE
SEND MY WIFE

422
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:27,234
EXCEPT TO EFFECT
SOME KIND OF...

423
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,634
RECONCILIATION.

424
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:30,000
WELL, YOU MUST
  REFUSE HER.

425
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:31,701
OBVIOUSLY, YES.

426
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:34,767
HMM, BUT THAT--

427
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:39,400
THAT IS EXACTLY
  WHAT HE WANTS.

428
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,868
<i>HE IS FORCING ME</i>
 <i>TO CHOOSE PUBLICLY</i>

429
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:45,434
BETWEEN HER AND--
AND YOU.

430
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,334
AND WHEN I TURN HER AWAY,
   WHICH I WILL,

431
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,801
HE WILL HAVE
  HIS PREMISE FOR WAR.

432
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:54,734
THEN WHY SO GLUM?

433
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:58,133
YOU HAVE WHAT YOU WANTED.
A WAR THAT HE WILL START,

434
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,300
A WAR THAT YOU
  DID NOT SEEK.

435
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,767
STILL, I...

436
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,334
I DO NOT LIKE IT.

437
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,701
HA, HE IS--

438
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,868
HE IS STRIKING

439
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:12,133
AT MY SUPPORT
   AMONGST THE PEOPLE.

440
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,701
HE-- HE WILL THINK
HE HAS OUTMANEUVERED ME.

441
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:17,367
WHAT MATTER?

442
00:29:17,434 --> 00:29:19,100
AS LONG AS YOU
  WIN THE WAR.

443
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:21,367
YES.

444
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:25,300
- I SUPPOSE SO.
- IN ANY CASE...

445
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:30,033
- WE MUST BE GRACIOUS
  HOSTS, NAY?
 - HM?

446
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,267
WE SHALL THROW A LOVELY
PARTY FOR THEM.

447
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:36,167
CHARMIAN, SEND FOR
THE KITCHEN CHAMBERLAIN.

448
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:37,868
NO NO NO.
   NO!

449
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:41,133
NO?
 WE MUST BE HOSPITABLE.

450
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,634
Antony:
  <i>OH.</i>

451
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:48,133
YOU'D LOVE THAT,
  WOULDN'T YOU?

452
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,934
HUH?

453
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:54,033
HUMILIATING ATIA.

454
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,534
HMM?

455
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:58,667
WATCHING HER SQUIRM

456
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:00,434
AS YOU PLAY THE QUEEN.

457
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:03,534
PLAY THE QUEEN?

458
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,434
I AM A QUEEN.

459
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:07,300
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

460
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:11,100
NO.
NO, I DON'T.

461
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:14,067
YOU--
YOU JUST WANT TO

462
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:16,601
FLAUNT OUR LOVE
IN FRONT OF HER.

463
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,300
WHY NOT?

464
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,868
WE LOVE EACH OTHER,
DON'T WE?

465
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,567
AND YOU NO LONGER
LOVE HER.

466
00:30:24,634 --> 00:30:26,934
WHY SHOULD SHE
  NOT KNOW IT?

467
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:35,400
IT'S AN ACT OF KINDNESS.

468
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,667
STOP HER PINING
FOR YOU.

469
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,734
( laughing )

470
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:42,000
I'M NOT WRONG,
AM I?

471
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:44,434
YOU DO NO LONGER
LOVE HER.

472
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:46,968
OF COURSE
I NO LONGER LOVE HER.

473
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:52,601
YOU KNOW I NO LONGER
LOVE HER.

474
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,968
BUT NEITHER DO I THINK
   SHE DESERVES PUBLIC
   HUMILIATION.

475
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:02,434
THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.

476
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:05,934
THAT IS WHY THEY'RE HERE,
TO BE HUMILIATED.

477
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:11,234
NO, I DON'T
THINK SHE KNOWS THAT.

478
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,801
ELSE SHE WOULD
NOT BE HERE.

479
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:18,634
I THINK
HER FUCKING SON

480
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:21,567
HAS MANIPULATED
HER INTO IT.

481
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:27,267
LET'S KILL THEM THEN.

482
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,634
WHAT?

483
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,734
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

484
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:37,601
ATIA WILL NOT
BE HUMILIATED...

485
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:39,434
BECAUSE ATIA
 WILL BE DEAD.

486
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:46,901
OCTAVIAN WILL KNOW THAT
 YOU'RE NOT A MAN

487
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:49,067
TO BE OUTMANEUVERED.

488
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,834
IT'S PERFECT.

489
00:31:56,434 --> 00:32:00,067
NO.  MY PEOPLE WILL
DESPISE ME AS A WIFE-KILLER.

490
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,701
WELL, THEIR SHIP SANK
ON THE WAY HOME.

491
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:05,334
- NO.
   - IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

492
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,534
NO.  I MEAN IT.
   NO!

493
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:11,534
I SEE.  WELL, I THINK
YOU ARE A COWARD!

494
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:13,434
HA!

495
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:15,567
OR YOU STILL
 HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER.

496
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,834
- ( laughing )
 - WHICH IS IT?

497
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,601
HM?

498
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:21,868
WHICH IS IT?

499
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:24,234
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT
   YOUR FUCKING MOUTH?

500
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:29,801
<i>( grunts )</i>

501
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,200
GODS, WHAT
  A GHASTLY PLACE.

502
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:17,901
BIG, THOUGH.

503
00:33:17,968 --> 00:33:20,767
IT'S A SURE SIGN
OF VULGARITY.

504
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,868
PTOLEMIES WERE ORIGINALLY
  GOAT-HERDS, YOU KNOW?

505
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:34,467
WHY ARE THE DOORS
NOT OPEN?

506
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,801
( grunting )

507
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:44,801
AH!

508
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:49,133
AH!  NO!

509
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,434
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

510
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,934
THE RUDENESS.

511
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,334
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW--
  VULGAR.

512
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,200
ROYALTY, INDEED.

513
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:08,200
THIS HEAT'S UNBEARABLE.

514
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:10,400
I THINK I'M GOING
TO FAINT.

515
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,100
YOU WOULD THINK THEY
  WOULD BRING US WATER.

516
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,334
- CAN'T WE GO BACK TO THE SHIP?
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

517
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,834
WE'RE STAYING HERE
 UNTIL THESE WRETCHED PEOPLE...

518
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:20,767
OH, ABOUT BLOODY TIME.

519
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:23,300
HELLO.

520
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,634
JOCASTA.
  IS IT YOU?

521
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:27,667
OF COURSE IT'S ME.
WHO ELSE WOULD I BE?

522
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,067
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?

523
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,701
OH, THIS?

524
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,968
HER MAJESTY DOESN'T LIKE
   THE ROMAN STYLE ON HER WOMEN.

525
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:36,501
QUITE IRRATIONAL ABOUT
 THE SUBJECT IF YOU ASK ME.

526
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:38,267
BUT ANYTHING FOR
  A QUIET LIFE, EH?

527
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,400
I RATHER LIKE IT NOW.

528
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:42,601
<i>WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?</i>
    <i>HAVE YOU COME FOR</i>
    <i>CROCODILE DAY?</i>

529
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:45,834
THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT ANYWAY.
   I CAN'T GET MY MOUTH
   AROUND THEIR LINGO.

530
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:47,834
SHE WILL SHRIEK.

531
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:50,567
BUT I JUST PRETEND
I'M A LITTLE MAD,
   AND SHE LEAVES OFF.

532
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:53,834
WHY IS THE DOOR KEPT SHUT?
WHY IS THERE NO ONE HERE
TO GREET US?

533
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:56,767
OH, I'M SURE THERE'LL BE
 SOMEONE ALONG IN A WHILE.

534
00:34:56,834 --> 00:35:00,234
THINGS MOVE...
 EVER SO SLOW AROUND HERE.

535
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,434
IT'S THE HEAT.

536
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:03,167
LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU
GO INSIDE

537
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,267
AND TELL ANTONY THAT
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE HIM?

538
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:07,601
OBVIOUSLY, HE'S NOT BEEN
INFORMED THAT WE'RE HERE.

539
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,367
I COULDN'T DO THAT.

540
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:12,501
NO ONE'S ALLOWED TO
SPEAK TO ANTONY WITHOUT
SHE SAYS SO.

541
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,167
EXCEPT MY DEAR
  LITTLE POSCA.

542
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:16,501
AND LUCIUS VORENUS,
  OF COURSE.

543
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:20,334
I LOVE YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT.
 IS THAT HOW PEOPLE ARE
 WEARING IT NOW?

544
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,033
OH, THANK JUNO.
POSCA.

545
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,634
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S
NAME IS--

546
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:26,367
Posca:
    <i>JOCASTA, WHAT ARE</i>
    <i>YOU DOING?</i>

547
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:28,234
- I WAS ONLY--
- QUIET, WOMAN!

548
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,667
SCA,
WHERE'S ANTONY?

549
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:32,901
YES, YES!
 A GREAT PLEASURE.

550
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:34,734
INDEED, YES.
COME ALONG.

551
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,200
POSCA?

552
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,300
POSCA?

553
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:43,334
THANK YOU.

554
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:48,567
THEY'VE ALL GONE INSANE.

555
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:57,868
( moaning )

556
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:55,601
IT'S FOR THE BEST,
YOU KNOW.

557
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:59,934
THIS PALACE LIFE
IS NO GOOD FOR YOU.

558
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,567
YOU NEED ACTION.

559
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:05,300
YEAH.

560
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:08,267
YOU'LL BE MUCH MORE HAPPY
WHEN THE WAR BEGINS.

561
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:13,968
- VORENUS.
   - SIR.

562
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,467
I HAVE A DELICATE
 MISSION FOR YOU.

563
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,601
OH, I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU HAVEN'T GONE NATIVE,
AT LEAST.

564
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,434
PERHAPS YOU CAN
TALK SOME SENSE.

565
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:39,267
WHAT IS THE MATTER
 WITH THESE PEOPLE?

566
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:41,868
WHY HASN'T ANTONY BEEN
   TOLD OF OUR ARRIVAL?

567
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:44,968
( clears throat )
 I'VE BEEN ORDERED BY
 TRIUMVIR MARK ANTONY

568
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:46,934
TO ESCORT YOU BOTH BACK
TO YOUR SHIP,

569
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,767
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
  LEAVE ALEXANDRIA AS SOON
  AS THE WIND ALLOWS.

570
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:00,601
WITHOUT SEEING HIM?

571
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:05,434
HE TURNS AWAY
THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD?

572
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:08,901
THAT'S CORRECT.

573
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:12,801
IT WAS SHE WHO ORDERED YOU
 TO DO THIS, WASN'T IT?

574
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,801
ANTONY WOULDN'T ACT
 SOOW.

575
00:38:14,868 --> 00:38:17,434
I TAKE ORDERS ONLY FROM
   MARK ANTONY, MADAM.

576
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,567
NO, WE'RE NOT GOING.

577
00:38:26,634 --> 00:38:28,434
- MOTHER, I--
 - MADAM?

578
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:30,200
WE ARE NOT GOING.

579
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:33,133
I AM NOT MOVING
 FROM THIS SPOT

580
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,400
UNLESS ANTONY COMES DOWN
   HIMSELF AND TELLS ME TO GO.

581
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:38,767
IF YOU WILL NOT GO WILLINGLY,
I HAVE BEEN GIVEN ORDERS

582
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:41,601
<i>TO USE WHATEVER FORCE</i>
 <i>NECESSARY TO REMOVE YOU.</i>

583
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,601
YOU WOULD MANHANDLE
 THE WOMEN OF THE JULII?

584
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,467
NO, BUT THESE MEN HERE...

585
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:48,968
THEY HAVE NO
 SUCH SCRUPLES.

586
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,434
- ANTONY!
   - MADAM.

587
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:00,767
COME DOWN, YOU BASTARD!

588
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,567
MADAM, PLEASE!

589
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,100
( sobbing )

590
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:33,400
YOU TELL MY HUSBAND
THAT HE'S COWARDLY SCUM.

591
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:35,267
TELL HIM THAT.

592
00:39:59,234 --> 00:40:02,300
YOU REALIZE, OF COURSE,
 WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE ALL
OUR MONEY BEHIND.

593
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,200
- I DON'T CARE!
   - WE'RE PENNILESS.

594
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:06,801
I'M SCARED.
   I WANT TO GO HOME.

595
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:08,467
PLEASE, HURRY.

596
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:10,133
( clears throat )

597
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,300
- GOING SOMEWHERE?
   - NO.

598
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:13,734
NO, WHAT MAKES YOU
   THINK THAT?

599
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,367
PLEASE, VORENUS.

600
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:20,801
DON'T TELL.
   PLEASE DON'T TELL.

601
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:22,501
HAVE MERCY
ON US.

602
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:23,901
THEY'LL KILL US.

603
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:25,567
THEY'LL THROW US
  TO THE CROCODILES.

604
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,934
MY WIFE IS
  OVERWROUGHT.

605
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,868
WE WERE MERELY GOING TO TAKE
A STROLL ALONG THE HARBOR

606
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:32,334
TO LOOK AT THE SHIPS.

607
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:37,934
THEN YOU MUST HURRY.

608
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,167
THE WIND IS CHANGING.
THE SHIPS LOOK BEST WHEN
   THE SAILS ARE SET.

609
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:43,534
COME WITH US.

610
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:47,834
NO.

611
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:49,801
WAR IS SURE TO
 COME NOW.

612
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:52,467
THIS IS NO PLACE
 FOR DECENT ROMANS.

613
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,667
TRUE, BUT I HAVE
RESPONSIBILITIES HERE.

614
00:40:54,734 --> 00:40:56,434
NOW IS THE TIME.

615
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:04,334
IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
TITUS PULLO,

616
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,701
ASK HIM TO KISS
MY CHILDREN FOR ME.

617
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:08,834
I WILL DO THAT.

618
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:18,400
THANK YOU.

619
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:23,734
( street chatter )

620
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:54,000
HELLO, AGAIN.

621
00:41:56,467 --> 00:41:57,968
Posca:
 <i>SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU.</i>

622
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:01,000
WOULD YOU MIND AWFULLY
IF WE HIDE HERE

623
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:03,801
UNTIL THIS BOAT
IS AT SEA?

624
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,734
I'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
   I REMEMBER.

625
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:13,400
THERE MUST BE
  MORE THAN THAT.

626
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:15,300
LOOK TO YOURSELF.

627
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,734
YOU ARE WHAT
 REMAINS OF HIM.

628
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:21,300
VORENUS.

629
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,834
WELL?

630
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:29,634
THEY'RE GONE.

631
00:42:29,701 --> 00:42:31,300
GOOD.

632
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,400
GOOD.

633
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:38,200
AND HOW IS...
ATIA?

634
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:41,734
I SUPPOSE SHE TOOK IT
WITH HER USUAL POISE?

635
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:43,167
NO.

636
00:42:43,234 --> 00:42:45,267
NO?

637
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,067
OH.

638
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:49,100
WELL.

639
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,567
HAD TO BE DONE.

640
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,334
WHERE'S POSCA?

641
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,067
I SENT FOR HIM
BUT HE DID NOT COME.

642
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,067
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.
DO YOU WISH ME TO GO
AND LOOK FOR HIM?

643
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:00,834
OH, NO NO.

644
00:43:00,901 --> 00:43:03,601
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

645
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,634
I'M SURE HE'LL TURN UP.

646
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:10,367
SIR, YOUR WIFE INSTRUCTED ME
 TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

647
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:12,400
OH?

648
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,434
SHE INSTRUCTED ME
  TO TELL YOU

649
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:16,701
THAT YOU
  ARE COWARDLY SCUM.

650
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:21,434
SHE DID, DID SHE?

651
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:24,234
OH.  AND--

652
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,200
AND WHAT'S YOUR
 OPINION OF THAT?

653
00:43:26,267 --> 00:43:28,968
IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO HAVE
  AN OPINION, SIR.

654
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:31,067
NAH.
TELL ME ANYWAY.

655
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:33,634
IS THAT AN ORDER?

656
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:35,701
YES.
 THAT'S AN ORDER.

657
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,067
YOU'RE NO COWARD.

658
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:46,367
BUT YOU DO HAVE A STRONG
  DISEASE IN YOUR SOUL.

659
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:51,334
A DISEASE THAT WILL
   EAT AWAY AT YOU...

660
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,868
UNTIL YOU DIE.

661
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,934
REALLY?

662
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,267
HMM.

663
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:04,934
AND WHAT IS THIS DISEASE?

664
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:08,834
I DON'T KNOW.
   I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

665
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:10,567
NO.

666
00:44:10,634 --> 00:44:13,167
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

667
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:17,434
SO HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE
OF YOUR DIAGNOSIS, THEN?

668
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:21,334
I RECOGNIZE
 YOUR SYMPTOMS.

669
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:25,133
I HAVE THE SAME SICKNESS.

670
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:30,667
HMM.

671
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:40,767
( exhales )

672
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:49,334
LONG ONE.

673
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:13,601
HELLO, MOTHER.
AND POSCA.

674
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,868
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

675
00:45:15,934 --> 00:45:19,200
I GATHER ANTONY WAS NOT
AMENABLE TO PERSUASION.

676
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:23,467
NO, HE WAS NOT.

677
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:27,033
BUT YOU KNEW THAT,
   DIDN'T YOU?

678
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:32,033
YOU WANTED A VILLA
IN CAPRI.

679
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,534
NOW YOU MAY HAVE ONE.

680
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,601
IS OCTAVIA WELL?

681
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:44,534
POSCA HAS SOMETHING HERE

682
00:45:44,601 --> 00:45:47,033
THAT WILL HELP YOU
  DESTROY ANTONY.

683
00:45:48,701 --> 00:45:52,033
- MOTHER, I AM HOPING--
 - CRUSH ANTONY AND HIS QUEEN.

684
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:57,400
AND YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR DAMN VILLA.

685
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:06,367
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
 FOR ME, POSCA?

686
00:46:06,434 --> 00:46:10,367
IT IS THE LAST
   WILL AND TESTAMENT

687
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,601
OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.

688
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,200
TO BE OPENED AND READ ONLY ON
  THE OCCASION OTHEIR DEATH.

689
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:19,267
IT IS A DESPICABLE
DOCUMENT.

690
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:22,501
TAKEN TOGETHER WITH HIS
   REPUDIATION OF YOUR SISTER,

691
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:25,000
THE ROMAN PEOPLE WOULD THINK
  A WAR AGAINST ANTONY

692
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:27,100
NOT ONLY INEVITABLE

693
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:29,801
BUT EMINENTLY DESIRABLE.

694
00:46:29,868 --> 00:46:32,601
- IS IT GENUINE?
- IT IS GENUINE.

695
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,734
YOU ARE A GOOD
AND LOYAL FRIEND, POSCA.

696
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:49,767
( chuckles )

697
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:53,968
THIS ONE HAS COOKED
HIMSELF FOR DINNER.

698
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:56,067
HE ASKS TO BE BURIED
IN ALEXANDRIA.

699
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:59,133
HE DECLARES CLEOPATRA
HIS WIFE AND THAT THEY
ARE LIVING GODS.

700
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,734
<i>SHE IS ISIS</i>
 <i>AND HE, OSIRIS.</i>

701
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:04,968
- IT'S PERFECT.
  - <i>WAIT, WAIT.  IT'S BETTER.</i>

702
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:08,267
HE LEAVES TO HIS
CHILDREN BY CLEOPATRA
ALL THE EASTERN PROVINCES.

703
00:47:08,334 --> 00:47:10,000
AND HER SON BY CAESAR

704
00:47:10,067 --> 00:47:11,901
IS TO BE GIVEN
ROME AND THE WEST.

705
00:47:13,868 --> 00:47:17,901
HAVING REJECTED
   HIS LOVING WIFE, OCTAVIA,

706
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:22,133
MARK ANTONY HAS COUPLED
   HIMSELF TO THE SORCERESS

707
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,234
CLEOPATRA, PROMISING HER
  DOMINION OF ALL ROME!

708
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,634
( crowd booing )

709
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:30,234
HE WORSHIPS DOGS
  AND REPTILES.

710
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,367
HE BLACKENS HIS EYES
WITH SOOT

711
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,100
LIKE A PROSTITUTE.

712
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,601
HE DANCES AND PLAYS
   THE CYMBALS

713
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:41,000
IN VILE NILOTIC RITES.

714
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:45,901
I KNOW HOW UNHAPPY YOU ARE
 AND I CANNOT BLAME YOU.

715
00:47:45,968 --> 00:47:49,801
FOR WHO WOULD NOT WEEP
  WHEN HE HEARS THAT THE GREAT
   MARK ANTONY

716
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:52,701
PAYS HOMAGE
TO FOREIGN GODS?

717
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:55,534
THAT HE HAS ABANDONED
HIS WIFE,

718
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:58,601
HIS CHILD
AND HIS COUNTRY?

719
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,067
I AM ASKED IF
 HE IS GONE MAD,

720
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:02,667
IF HE IS BEWITCHED.

721
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:04,667
I HAVE NO EXPLANATION.

722
00:48:04,734 --> 00:48:08,734
WE MAY WEEP FOR HIM,
  BUT THEN WE MUST DO OUR DUTY,

723
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:12,567
FOR HE IS NO LONGER
A ROMAN, BUT AN EGYPTIAN.

724
00:48:12,634 --> 00:48:15,767
AND WHAT IS LEFT FOR US
  TO DO BUT FIGHT HIM?

725
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:18,701
FIGHT HIM
AND DESTROY HIM!

726
00:48:18,767 --> 00:48:21,267
( all applaud )

727
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:30,267
<i>( footsteps approach )</i>

728
00:48:30,334 --> 00:48:31,634
PULLO.

729
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,667
<i>MY OLD FRIEND,</i>
 <i>IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.</i>

730
00:48:33,734 --> 00:48:35,400
SIR.

731
00:48:35,467 --> 00:48:36,868
COME, SIT DOWN.

732
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,934
POSCA TELLS ME
   OUR FRIEND VORENUS

733
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,167
STANDS BY ANTONY
EVEN NOW.

734
00:48:51,234 --> 00:48:53,367
LOYAL MAN, VORENUS.

735
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:56,033
HE SENDS YOU
 HIS BEST REGARDS,

736
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,734
ASKED THAT YOUISS
   HIS CHILDREN FOR HIM.

737
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:01,267
- HE'S ALL RIGHT, IS HE?
- YOU KNOW HIM.

738
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:04,133
<i>IRON AS EVER.</i>

739
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,734
- ( chuckles )
  - YOU AND HE ARE
   STILL FRIENDS, THEN?

740
00:49:06,801 --> 00:49:08,267
YES.

741
00:49:09,267 --> 00:49:11,000
VERY SOON I WILL HAVE
   TO GO EAST

742
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:13,400
TO END THIS
   THING WITH ANTONY.

743
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:15,133
I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

744
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,501
- WHY?
  - YOU ARE CLOSE TO VORENUS.

745
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,701
HE IS CLOSE TO ANTONY.
  IT MAY BE YOU CAN ACT
 AS A MEDIATOR.

746
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:23,868
<i>AND MAYBE WE CAN SAVE</i>
  <i>UNNECESSARY BLOODSHED.</i>

747
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:25,767
NOT TO ARGUE WITH YOU,

748
00:49:25,834 --> 00:49:27,734
BUT IT DOESN'T
  SEEM LIKELY.

749
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:31,534
THERE ARE SOME WILL
 HAVE TO DIE, OF COURSE.
 ANTONY CANNOT BE SAVED.

750
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,868
- THE BOY CAESARIO
  WILL HAVE TO GO, OBVIOUSLY.
 - CAESARION?

751
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:38,200
THEY HAVE NAMED HIM PUTATIVE
  KING OF ROME, PULLO.

752
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:41,667
HE WILL HAVE TO DIE.
  BUT PERHAPS CLEOTRA

753
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:43,434
AND HER CHILDREN BY ANTONY
  MAY BE SAVED.

754
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:46,067
- <i>PRESERVE SOME STABILITY.</i>
  - YES.

755
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:48,200
I SEE.

756
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:51,534
I DO NOT WANT
  TO ORDER YOU TO COME, PULLO,
BUT I WILL IF I HAVE TO.

757
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:53,067
NO.

758
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:54,968
NO PROBLEM.

759
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,634
I'LL COME.

760
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:58,501
GOOD.

761
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,501
IT WILL BE LIKE
OLD TIMES.

762
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,100
AN ADVENTURE TOGETHER.

763
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:17,834
SO, ANTONY MORE OR LESS
   FORCED OCTAVIAN INTO WAR.

764
00:50:17,901 --> 00:50:19,534
ELSE THE EAST WOULD BE
 LOST TO THE GYPOS.

765
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:21,467
WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT,
 NOW WOULD WE?

766
00:50:21,534 --> 00:50:24,734
WORSHIPPING A BUNCH
   OF DOGS AND CATS
   AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

767
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:27,000
ANYROAD,
   THE THING IS,

768
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:30,000
OCTAVIAN'S ORDERED ME
   TO GO ALONG WITH HIM.

769
00:50:30,067 --> 00:50:33,434
SO THAT'S WHAT
 I'LL BE DOING--
 GOING ALONG WITH HIM.

770
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:36,634
- CAN I COME WITH YOU?
 - NO.  SORRY.

771
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:39,501
YOU STAY HERE
   WITH ME, HMM?
   WE'LL BE FINE.

772
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:41,133
YOU'LL HARDLY NOTICE
I'M GONE.

773
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,133
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,

774
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,234
I'M MORE THAN LIKELY
  TO SEE YOUR FATHER.

775
00:50:50,267 --> 00:50:54,167
HE SENT WORD THAT I SHOULD
  GIVE YOU ALL A KISS FROM HIM.

776
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:05,334
IF I SEE HIM, CAN I GIVE HIM
   A KISS FROM YOU IN RETURN?

777
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,434
NO.
  HE KILLED OUR MOTHER.

778
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,067
IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

779
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:18,400
YOU'RE A HARD ONE,
 YOU.

780
00:51:18,467 --> 00:51:20,501
MY FATHER MADE ME SO.

781
00:51:22,334 --> 00:51:23,701
I HEAR YOU.

782
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:46,267
WHILE I'M AWAY,
 THERE'LL BE NO TROUBLE
  BETWEEN YOU.

783
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:48,367
NO SKIMMING FROM
THE GRAIN RATION,

784
00:51:48,434 --> 00:51:51,801
NO STEALING OF WOMEN,
   NOR ANY EXTORTION,

785
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:53,734
ROBBERY, OR ARSON--

786
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:57,334
UNLESS UNDER DIRECT
   LICENSE BY MASCIUS.

787
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,734
ANYBODY STEPS OUT OF LINE,
  THEY'LL BE SHARING THEIR
  DINNER WITH MEMMIO.

788
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:03,434
( growling )

789
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:15,968
DON'T FORGET
YOUR VINEGAR FLASK.

790
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:18,033
MM, RIGHT.

791
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,667
GIVE US A SMILE, EH?
WON'T BE GONE FOREVER.

792
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,067
IF YOU REALLY LOVED ME,

793
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:27,567
YOU'D TAKE ME WITH YOU.

794
00:52:27,634 --> 00:52:28,934
( chuckles )

795
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,868
IT'S A WAR,
NOT A SHOPPING TRIP.

796
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:34,734
I CAN TAKE CARE
   OF MYSELF.

797
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:37,968
I KNOW YOU CAN.
  WHICH IS WHY I'M NOT WORRIED
 ABOUT LEAVING YOU HERE.

798
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:39,667
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING NOW?

799
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:41,601
VINEGAR.

800
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:45,667
( sighs )

801
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,067
MEMMIO?

802
00:53:33,968 --> 00:53:35,801
( yells )

803
00:53:53,434 --> 00:53:54,968
( grunts )

804
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:00,367
( both groaning )

805
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:04,033
( screams )

806
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:15,968
( groans )

807
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:30,300
( gasping )

808
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:43,267
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.
  THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

809
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:46,267
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

810
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:49,367
WHY ARE YOU
PUNISHING ME LIKE THIS?

811
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:53,033
OH, YOU SELFISH BASTARD.
  IT'S ME WHO'S DYING,

812
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,634
NOT YOU WHO'S BEING
PUNISHED.

813
00:54:55,701 --> 00:54:58,000
IT'S ME.

814
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:01,033
I'M GONNA DIE.

815
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,901
IT IS AS--
   AS IT SHOULD BE.

816
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:06,734
WHAT HAVE YOU
EVER DONE?

817
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:08,267
YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN.

818
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:11,634
OH, DON'T GET
 SENTIMENTAL ON ME NOW.

819
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:13,934
ONE THING I'M NOT
IS A GOOD WOMAN.

820
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,033
YOU'VE BEEN
GOOD TO ME.

821
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,334
NO, I HAVEN'T.

822
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,567
EIRENE.

823
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:24,200
EIRENE WAS A GOOD WOMAN.

824
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:26,667
NOT A SHE-WOLF
   LIKE ME.

825
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:29,400
SHE HAD HER MOMENTS.

826
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:31,067
SHE WAS GONNA
GIVE YOU A CHILD.

827
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:37,968
FATE HAD
   A DIFFERENT PLAN.

828
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,367
WE'RE HAPPY ENOUGH,
   YOU AND ME.

829
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,400
I'M SORRY.

830
00:55:51,033 --> 00:55:54,267
I CAN'T GO TO THE AFTERLIFE
WITH LIES IN MY HEART.

831
00:55:54,334 --> 00:55:56,801
NEMESIS WON'T
   LET ME REST.

832
00:55:59,934 --> 00:56:01,934
WHAT LIES?

833
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:05,000
WHAT'S NEMESIS
   WANT WITH YOU?

834
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:08,000
SEND THESE PEOPLE AWAY.

835
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,834
GET OUT.

836
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:19,000
REMEMBER WHEN I'M GONE,

837
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:22,334
WHAT I DID,

838
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,834
I DID OUT OF
LOVE FOR YOU.

839
00:56:26,901 --> 00:56:28,834
DID WHAT?

840
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:34,567
IT WAS ME...

841
00:56:34,634 --> 00:56:36,501
WHO KILLED EIRENE

842
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:38,567
AND YOUR CHILD.

843
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:42,400
I WANTED YOU
   FOR MYSELF.

844
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:44,133
SO I POISONED HER.

845
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,434
( shivering )

846
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:02,801
GOODBYE, LOVE.

847
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:10,000
( choking )

848
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:29,100
( choking stops )

849
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:31,534
