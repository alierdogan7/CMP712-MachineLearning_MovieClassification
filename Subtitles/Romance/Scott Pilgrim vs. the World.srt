00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,765
And you definitely don't
want to listen to them.

180
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,529
Oh, I heart them so much.

181
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:05,130
Yeah, I hearted them, too, until
they signed to a major label,

182
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:08,938
and the lead singer turned into a
total bitch and ruined my life forever.

183
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,534
But that's just me.

184
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:14,048
Envy Adams is so cool.
Do you read her blog?

185
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:15,673
Sorry, you were
saying about me?

186
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,685
I mean, I've never gone
out with anyone so talented.

187
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,080
Go out with
a lot of guys?

188
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:21,144
No.

189
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:23,551
Yeah, so, whatever, man.

190
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,490
I've never even
kissed a guy.

191
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:30,525
Hey,

192
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,561
me, neither.

193
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:46,210
Here you go.

194
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,646
So, this is
your secret lair?

195
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:49,445
Yeah, yeah.
Can I come in?

196
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,511
My secret lair
is one of those

197
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,350
"No girls allowed"- type
deals.

198
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:55,681
Okay.

199
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:57,247
But do you wanna see the
house where I grew up?

200
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:58,917
Sure!
Come on.

201
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:02,186
There you go.

202
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:04,995
Wow.

203
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,356
Yeah.

204
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:08,699
Wow.

205
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:17,711
Oh, God.

206
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:21,975
So alone.

207
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:25,017
You're not alone.

208
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,515
What?

209
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:29,318
You're just having
some idiotic dream.

210
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,986
Does that mean
we can make out?

211
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,857
Oh, God!

212
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:34,952
What is it, Scott?

213
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,190
I had this
totally weird dream.

214
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:37,492
Oh, God.

215
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:38,793
What is it,
Other Scott?

216
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:42,198
Can we skip the dream time?
Color me not interested.

217
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,532
But there was this girl.

218
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:44,934
Girl?

219
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:46,496
Was this
an Envy-related dream?

220
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:48,166
We don't use
the E-word in this house.

221
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:51,303
No, it wasn't her.
It was somebody new.

222
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,370
Yay for that.

223
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:54,642
Speaking of new,

224
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,616
weren't you supposed to take
your fake high-school girlfriend

225
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:58,277
to the library
a half-hour ago?

226
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,850
What? It's like 6:00
in the morning.

227
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:02,615
(SCREAMS)

228
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,050
MAN: Shh!

229
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:06,724
It's weird.

230
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,353
What's weird?

231
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,194
Libraries remind me
of grade school.

232
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,700
That must seem like
a really long time ago.

233
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:16,396
Yeah, let's talk
about something else.

234
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,987
Do you know that girl?

235
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,993
Scott!
What?

236
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:42,862
You only played one note
for that entire song.

237
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:44,957
My hand slipped.

238
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,762
Is your girlfriend
distracting you?

239
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:48,630
My girlfriend?

240
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:50,034
I'll be quieter.

241
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,400
Let's do that one again.

242
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,768
Sorry, what are we doing?

243
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,173
I told you, like, 50 times!

244
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,074
We're going
to this party, retard.

245
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,306
Party?
At Julie's.

246
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:00,405
I thought
you guys split up.

247
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:02,950
We did, but there might be some
label guys there, so, you know...

248
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:04,917
Oh, man, this is gonna suck. Suck!

249
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,147
At least it'll give us
something to complain about.

250
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:08,314
Oh, man!

251
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,516
This sucks!

252
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:10,683
Sucks!

253
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,785
I'm gonna go pee
due to boredom.

254
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,363
I have to pee.

255
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,023
You know, so I told him
you've got a really good sound,

256
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:19,566
and I think that you
should market your sound

257
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:22,125
to deaf people, because... Scott! Hey!

258
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:23,192
Hey, Comeau.

259
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:25,102
How about this party? You
getting your drink on here?

260
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:27,004
No, I don't drink.
This is just Coke Zero.

261
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:28,372
What do you mean,
you don't drink?

262
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:30,809
I distinctly remember you being very
drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...

263
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,244
Hey, Comeau,
you know everyone, right?

264
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:34,372
Yeah, pretty much, I do.

265
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:36,139
You know this one girl
with hair like this?

266
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,650
Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.

267
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:39,710
Somebody said she was gonna
be here tonight, actually.

268
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:41,085
What?
Oh, Scott.

269
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:43,283
You have the hots for her or
something? I gotta tell you though,

270
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:44,791
I hear that she's
a little hardcore.

271
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:08,638
(ALL CHATTERING)

272
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,831
Hey, what's up?

273
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,258
Nothing.

274
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:30,668
<i>Hey, you know Pac-Man?</i>

275
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:32,228
I know of him.

276
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:35,874
<i>Well, Pac-Man was
originally called Puck-Man.</i>

277
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:38,472
They changed it because...

278
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,673
Not because Pac-Man looks
like a hockey puck.

279
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:43,182
<i>"Paku-paku" means
"flap your mouth,"</i>

280
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:45,811
and that they were afraid
people would change...

281
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:49,687
Scratch out the "P" and
turn it into an "F," like...

282
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:51,823
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

283
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:53,554
Yeah, that's amazing.

284
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:55,117
Um...

285
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:57,491
Am I dreaming?

286
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:01,558
I'll leave you alone
forever now.

287
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:02,694
Thanks.

288
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,235
Dude!
What?

289
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:12,574
She's totally real!
Who?

290
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,205
Ramona Flowers.
What?

291
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:16,341
Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?

292
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,078
All I know is
that she is American.

293
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:19,210
American.

294
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:20,720
Why don't you go talk
to Sandra and Monique?

295
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:21,846
They know a lot more.

296
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:24,050
Lady-dudes. What do you
know about Ramona Flowers?

297
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,422
I heard she has
a boyfriend.

298
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:26,892
Yeah. Some guy
back in New York.

299
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:28,686
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What else?

300
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:31,197
I heard she kicks
all kinds of ass.

301
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,791
She's on another level.

302
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:35,768
She has men
dying at her feet.

303
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:38,465
She's got some
battle scars, dude.

304
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,063
What about Ramona Flowers?

305
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:41,130
You know her?
Tell me now.

306
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:42,198
She just moved here.

307
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:43,835
Got a job at Amazon.
Comes into my work.

308
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:44,901
Does she really?

309
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:46,640
Didn't you say she just
broke up with someone?

310
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:47,772
Did she really?

311
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:49,111
They had a huge fight,
or whatever.

312
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,172
Did they really?

313
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,651
Yes! But I didn't want Scott
to know that, Stephen.

314
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,688
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

315
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:56,951
Scott, I forbid you
from hitting on Ramona,

316
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:59,152
even if you haven't had a
real girlfriend in over a year.

317
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:00,251
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

318
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:03,456
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's
mourning period is officially over.

319
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:05,490
He's totally dating
a high-schooler.

320
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,535
Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.

321
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:08,762
She's got a point.

322
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:09,928
I thought
you guys broke up.

323
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:12,768
I don't want you scaring off the
coolest girl at my party, Scott.

324
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,400
We all know you're a total
lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.

325
00:15:15,476 --> 00:15:16,943
That's completely untrue.

326
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:18,808
That time with Lisa?
That was a misunderstanding.

327
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,814
That time with Hollie? That
wasn't what it looked like.

328
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:21,940
That time you
dumped Kim for...

329
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:23,779
Okay. Me and Kim are
all good now, all right?

330
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:28,613
Whatever! Ramona's out of your
league. Let's just leave it at that.

331
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,988
Besides, I'm not even sure
she did have a big breakup.

332
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:33,220
She keeps mentioning
some guy named Gideon.

333
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:34,761
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

334
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:36,157
Forget it, Scott!

335
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:37,422
(ALL EXCLAIM)

336
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,563
Guess who's drunk?

337
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:43,864
I guess Wallace.

338
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:45,730
You guess right.

339
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,775
So, that girl
from my dream...

340
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:52,142
Girl. Okay.

341
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:53,646
I saw her at the library.

342
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:56,343
Library. Can I pretend
we're talking about a guy?

343
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:59,284
And then I'm at this party
and, hey, there she is.

344
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:00,616
Hey, there he is.

345
00:16:00,688 --> 00:16:01,677
I think she's...

346
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:02,780
I think he's...

347
00:16:02,857 --> 00:16:05,018
I think she's
the girl of my dreams.

348
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:06,082
Mmm.

349
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,558
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

350
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,359
I've never been
so sure about something.

351
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:12,922
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

352
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:14,291
What's that?

353
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:17,338
You should break up with your
fake high-school girlfriend.

354
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:18,736

about me gaying up the place.

887

So, how's dinner
coming along?

888
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,740
Yeah, good, good, good.

889
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:35,305
Okay, well, I'm gonna
leave you lovebirds to it.

890
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:39,010
I am heading up to Casa Loma
to stalk my hetero crush.

Will you man the hell up?

893
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:43,053
You can get to second
and a half base tonight.

894
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:44,248
You think so?

895
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:47,225
Well, if you strike out in the next
hour, come find me at the castle.

896
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:48,585
If I strike out?

897
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:49,992
Okay, when. See you in 60.

898
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:56,501
This is actually
really good garlic bread.

899
00:42:56,569 --> 00:42:58,161
Garlic bread is
my favorite food.

900
00:42:58,238 --> 00:42:59,967
I could honestly
eat it for every meal.

901
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,731
Or just eat it all the time
without even stopping.

902
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:03,867
You'd get fat.

903
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,102
No, why would I get fat?

904
00:43:05,178 --> 00:43:06,236
Bread makes you fat.

906

915
00:43:48,855 --> 00:43:50,322
Your hair's pretty shaggy.

916
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,381
Oh, God,
I need a haircut, don't I?

917
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:53,447
What?

918
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:54,788
No, sorry. I just...

919
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:58,653
I got a bad haircut right
before me and my big ex broke up,

920
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:01,256
but that was so long ago
now I can barely remember.

Sounds like a bad time.

926
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:16,044
Bad time? Not really.

927
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:17,207
<i>It was.</i>

928
00:44:17,283 --> 00:44:18,511
It was a mutual thing.

00:44:18,584 --> 00:44:19,676
<i>It wasn't.</i>

930
00:44:19,752 --> 00:44:22,721
I mean, she told me it was mutual.

<i>She dumped him.
It was brutal.</i>

932
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:26,486
What was her name?

933
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:27,856
She was Nat,
when I knew her,

934
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:30,020
but she stopped
liking that name.

935
00:44:30,096 --> 00:44:31,757
Then she stopped liking me.

936
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:33,731
Your hair is cute.
I like it long.

937
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,597
But it would be cuter short, wouldn't it?

What?
What?

939
00:44:38,237 --> 00:44:39,261
Why are you
wearing that hat?

940
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:40,567
I thought we could go
for a walk.

come out here in the cold

so you could cover
your hair with that hat.

943
00:44:45,178 --> 00:44:47,806
No, no. I just love me
some walking, you know.

944
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,874
Just putting one leg in front
of the other, like this. Walking.

945
00:44:52,952 --> 00:44:54,920

a little heightened.

Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

947
00:44:57,123 --> 00:44:59,717
I just sort of feel like I'm
on drugs when I'm with you.

00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:01,316
Not that I do drugs,
unless you do drugs,

949
00:45:01,394 --> 00:45:03,294
in which case
I do drugs all the time.

950

Every drug.

951
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:08,133

a little brighter.

01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:51,631
Okay.

1409
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,110
You know how you only use
10% of your brain?

1410
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:56,477
That's because the other 90%
is filled with curds and whey.

1411
01:05:56,548 --> 01:05:58,675
Did you learn that
at Vegan Academy?

1412
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,183
Go ahead and
get snippy, baby.

1413
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:02,685
If you knew the science, maybe
I'd listen to a word you're saying.

pretend I just got wet from the rain?

1416
01:06:10,362 --> 01:06:11,420
It's not raining.

1417
01:06:11,496 --> 01:06:12,485
Oh.

1418
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,391

give me the Cliff Notes

1419
01:06:14,466 --> 01:06:17,094
on how and why you ended
up dating this A-hole.

1420
01:06:17,168 --> 01:06:18,499
Is that really
important right now?

1421
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:20,538
Well, if there's a key
element in his back story

1422
01:06:20,605 --> 01:06:23,870
that's gonna help me out in a
critical moment of not dying, yes.

1423
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:28,975
I was only dating Lucas until
the minute Todd walked by.

1424
01:06:29,648 --> 01:06:33,277
<i>Guess that's not very nice, but
I used to be, kind of like that.</i>

1425
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:37,386
<i>We hated everyone. We
wrecked stuff. Nobody cared.</i>

1426

<i>He punched a hole
in the moon for me.</i>

1427
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:41,556
<i>It was pretty crazy.</i>

1428
01:06:41,626 --> 01:06:42,820
<i>A week and a half later
he told me</i>

1429
01:06:42,894 --> 01:06:44,691
<i>his dad was sending him
to Vegan Academy,</i>

1430
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,795
<i>so I dumped him.</i>

1431
01:06:47,399 --> 01:06:49,663
Have you dumped everyone
you've ever been with?

1432
01:06:49,734 --> 01:06:51,599
You've never been
the dumpee?

1433
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:54,798
Look, I've dabbled
in being a bitch.

1434
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:56,670
It's part of the reason
I moved here.

1435
01:06:56,741 --> 01:07:00,040
I was really hoping to
just leave it all behind me.

1436
01:07:00,111 --> 01:07:01,510
TODD: Hey, lovebirds...

1437
01:07:02,514 --> 01:07:04,812
We have unfinished business,
I and he.

1438
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:06,712
He and me.

What?

1443
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:14,781
Because you'll be dust
by Monday.

01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:16,517
Um...

1445
01:07:16,594 --> 01:07:18,653
Because you'll be
pulverized in two seconds.

And the cleaning lady,
she cleans up dust.

1447
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,124
She dusts.

1448
01:07:26,337 --> 01:07:27,736
So, what's on Monday?

1449
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:32,903
Because it's Friday now. She
has the weekends off, so...

1450
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:35,445
Monday. Right?

1451

Basically, you can't
win this fight.

to give up this girl,

1453

gonna kill you.

Dude, I can see
in your mind's eye.

1468
01:09:44,843 --> 01:09:46,970
You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees

1469
01:09:47,045 --> 01:09:49,275
in an attempt to
make me break vegan edge.

1470
01:09:49,347 --> 01:09:51,144
I'll take the one with soy.

1471
01:09:53,985 --> 01:09:55,782
Thanks, tool.

1472
01:09:57,155 --> 01:10:00,386
<i>Actually, muchacho,
I poured the soy in this cup.</i>

1473
01:10:00,458 --> 01:10:03,291
But I thought real hard
about pouring it in that cup.

01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,333

half-and-half, baby.

you knowingly
ingested gelato.

For the record, I am so
pissed off for you, right now.

Shut the (BLEEP) up, Julie.

01:12:19,063 --> 01:12:20,360
Okay.

going to be much of a party.

just went "poom.''

Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.

Just the desperate people trying
to rub elbows with the label guys.

almost died back there.

I want to go.

you want to do.

So, let's go.

RAMONA: We really don't
have to go to this thing.

1527
01:12:51,029 --> 01:12:52,826
It'll probably be
a bad scene all around.

1528
01:12:52,897 --> 01:12:55,422
No, I'm fine.
It's just...

1529
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,933
It's just...
Well...

1530
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:01,229
Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?

1531
01:13:01,305 --> 01:13:03,034
So far,
you're not a total ass.

1532
01:13:03,107 --> 01:13:04,301
But I'm part ass?

1533
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:06,502
If it makes you feel better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.

Scott, I don't have
all the answers, okay?

1538
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:14,646

live in the moment if I can.

but are you saying
Envy wasn't?

1542

We all have baggage.

and kill me every five minutes.

I broke up with her.

She's totally cool with it.

1552
01:13:40,244 --> 01:13:41,802
Yeah, she's very mature
for her age.

1553
01:13:41,879 --> 01:13:43,141
We had a very
healthy breakup.

1554

Me and Kim?
I can barely remember.

1558
01:13:49,754 --> 01:13:51,745
It was high school.
She had freckles.

1559
01:13:51,956 --> 01:13:53,014
That's it?

1560
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:56,083
Yeah, it kind of ended.
We changed.

1561
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,286
That's really
the whole story?

1562
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:59,226
Okay, fine, I had to fight
a guy to be with her. Okay?

1563
01:13:59,297 --> 01:14:01,925
I fought a crazy,
80-foot-tall, purple-suited dude

1564
01:14:01,999 --> 01:14:04,126
and I had to fight
96 guys to get to him.

1565
01:14:04,202 --> 01:14:06,830
He was flying and shooting
lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?

1566
01:14:06,904 --> 01:14:09,338
And I kicked him so hard that he
saw the curvature of the earth.

1567
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:11,841
Does that make
you feel any better?

know what I'm like anymore.

thing is messing with my head.

01:45:08,331 --> 01:45:11,858
<i>but can you defeat yourself?</i>

2099
01:45:17,239 --> 01:45:18,467
KNIVES: Uh-oh!

2100
01:45:19,308 --> 01:45:20,468
Nega Scott.

2101
01:45:20,609 --> 01:45:22,167
<i>ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Nega Scott!</i>

2102
01:45:26,215 --> 01:45:27,443
No.

2103
01:45:27,683 --> 01:45:29,583
This is something
I have to face.

2104
01:45:32,822 --> 01:45:33,948
Myself.

2105
01:45:36,092 --> 01:45:38,322
<i>Solo round!</i>

2106
01:45:39,762 --> 01:45:43,254
SCOTT: They have this incredible
French toast with bananas on it

2107
01:45:43,332 --> 01:45:44,560
and you get bacon
on the side.

2108
01:45:44,633 --> 01:45:45,759
I'm liking that.

2109
01:45:45,835 --> 01:45:47,530
Let's do it next week.
Yeah, Tuesday.

2110
01:45:47,603 --> 01:45:48,729
Yeah, all right. Be good.

2111
01:45:48,804 --> 01:45:49,896
Yeah, yeah.

2112
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:51,263
Hey.

2113
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:52,602
(NEGA SCOTT WHISTLING)

2114
01:45:52,675 --> 01:45:54,142
What happened?

2115
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:57,111
Nothing, we just shot the shit.
He's just a really nice guy.

2116
01:45:57,179 --> 01:45:58,908
We're gonna get
brunch next week.

2117
01:45:59,048 --> 01:46:00,777
We actually have
a lot in common.

2118
01:46:00,850 --> 01:46:03,842
Your hair,
it's getting really shaggy.

2119
01:46:04,453 --> 01:46:06,148
It is?
Yeah.

2120
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:09,888
You should probably
get it cut.

2121
01:46:10,693 --> 01:46:12,160
Yeah, you're right.

2122
01:46:12,428 --> 01:46:13,656
I should get it cut.

2123
01:46:13,729 --> 01:46:15,219
At a salon.

2124
01:46:15,297 --> 01:46:17,663
Salon, yeah.
That sounds really nice.

2125
01:46:17,733 --> 01:46:19,132
Hey.

2126
01:46:20,436 --> 01:46:21,664
You're going?

2127
01:46:22,204 --> 01:46:24,172
I should probably disappear.

2128
01:46:24,607 --> 01:46:25,972
After all that?

2129
01:46:26,742 --> 01:46:28,733
I still need a new life.

2130
01:46:29,545 --> 01:46:33,037
I came here to escape, but
the past keeps catching up.

2131
01:46:34,016 --> 01:46:36,143
I'm tired of people
getting hurt because of me.

2132
01:46:36,218 --> 01:46:38,584
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna get over it.

2133
01:46:39,255 --> 01:46:41,223
I don't mean just you.

2134
01:46:44,093 --> 01:46:45,788
I understand.

2135
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:49,393
I should thank you, though.

2136
01:46:49,465 --> 01:46:50,864
For what?

2137
01:46:53,002 --> 01:46:55,971
For being the nicest guy
I ever dated.

2138
01:46:57,973 --> 01:46:59,736
That's kind of sad.

2139
01:47:02,311 --> 01:47:04,108
It is kind of sad.

2140
01:47:07,416 --> 01:47:08,906
Bye, and stuff.

2141
01:47:10,152 --> 01:47:13,553
Yeah. And stuff.

2142
01:47:18,961 --> 01:47:20,861
KNIVES: Go, get her.

2143
01:47:21,797 --> 01:47:23,264
SCOTT: What?

2144
01:47:23,332 --> 01:47:26,062
You've been fighting
for her all along.

2145
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:29,803
But what about you?

2146
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:32,402
I'll be fine.

2147
01:47:36,545 --> 01:47:39,070
I'm too cool
for you anyway.

2148
01:47:43,552 --> 01:47:44,780
<i>Ciao, Knives.</i>

2149
01:47:45,554 --> 01:47:46,714
Go.

2150
01:47:52,361 --> 01:47:53,623
SCOTT: Hey.

2151
01:47:53,696 --> 01:47:56,062
Hey, mind if I tag along?

2152
01:47:58,667 --> 01:48:00,100
You want to come with me?

2153
01:48:00,503 --> 01:48:04,599
Yeah, I thought
maybe we could try again.
