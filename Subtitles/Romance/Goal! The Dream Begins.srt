- RapidoU rapido.

10
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:42,829
Remain where you are.

00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,749
Santiago!

12
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,170
(man) Remain where you are.

13
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,466
This is the United States border patrol.

14
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,845
Dale, pasa.

00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,528
Hey.

25
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,329
(in English) well, we won 4-2. Scored
a couple. ShouId have got another one.

26
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,389
- (in English) There's aIways plan B.
- Which one is that?

27
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,476
The American Dream.
We win the Iottery.

28
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,485
(in English) Too bad.

29
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,490
You have to eat something.

30
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,492
Hey!

31
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,752
Hey, boss. I've been a busboy now
for six months. Why can't I be a waiter?

32
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,671
This Chinese restaurant.
You're not Chinese.

33
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,216
So? This is America.
You're American, I'm American.

34
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,053
- You have green card?
- If I had one, could I be a waiter?

35
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,222
No. You're not Chinese.

36
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,350
(shouts)

37
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,764
Tommy! Hold your position.

38
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,308
Tommy, you're supposed
to be on the wing.

39
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,727
It's not the Cup Final.
He's seven years old.

40
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,563
You're never too young, VaI.

41
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,274
To be honest, I don't think
Tom's that into soccer.

42
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,359
That's b... Oh.

43
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,486
Go.

44
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,489
- (Santiago) Hey! Watch out.
- Go on, Tom.

45
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,372
Thanks.

46
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,418
A Santiago, a Santiago.

47
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,592
- VamosU pasala.
- Here. Yeah. Echala.

48
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,606
- He's quite a player.
- Yes, he is.

49
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:49,111
- Did you teach him to do that?
- God taught him.

50
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,619
He doesn't look right.
His balance is alI wrong.

51
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,121
Doesn't look up enough.

52
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,831
Doesn't lift his legs high enough.

53
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,959
That's what alI the other teams think.

54
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,132
Then that happens.

55
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,595
Bien hecho, Santiago.

56
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,852
- Ahora si me tienes que ensenar.
- Well played, son.

57
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,979
Do you ever play professionaI?

58
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:30,361
Well... pro teams go for colIege kids and...
none of us went to college.

59
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,656
- When's your next game?
- Saturday.

60
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,743
There's someone I bumped into
on the plane on the way over here.

61
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,829
I want him to see you play.
He's a sports agent.

62
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,916
I'm serious. I think you're worth it, son.

63
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,252
Listen, no offense,
but I need to get to work.

64
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,879
I used to play a bit myself.

65
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,049
- Yeah? Where?
- England.

66
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,511
I was a scout too.
I know what I'm talking about.

67
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,430
- England?
- What's your name, son?

68
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,517
- Santiago Munez.
- Glen Foy.

69
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,020
Santiago, apurate.

70
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,898
I'll see you Saturday, Santiago.

71
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,026
Corrale, corrale.

72
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,949
Man.

73
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:05,748
(in English) I don't know. Meet this guy and
everything couId change. For the better.

74
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,722
Pinche chavalo.

75
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:32,107
(PA) Baseball, tennis, soccer, basketball.
All at the touch of a button.

76
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,487
Experience the thrill of the game from
the comfort of your home environment.

77
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,365
- Barry, is this a good moment?
- No time like the present.

78
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,035
So he's a young Mexican kid
from the barrio.

79
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,498
He dazzIed me, I teIl you, Barry.
As you know, I don't dazzle easily.

80
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,959
The Iast time was a young kid
called Jermain Defoe.

81
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:56,131
- I'd rather not talk about that, Glen.
- So he's playing on Saturday afternoon.

82
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,841
Some college downtown.

83
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,053
Right, teIl me exactly where it is
and I'Il be there 1 1 0%.

84
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,014
- Glad to hear it.
- (phone rings) Oh, heIlo, now.

85
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,476
Why don't you knock yourself out
and help yourseIf to finger food?

86
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,562
Probably don't do sashimi in Gateshead,
do they, mate?

87
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,981
See you later.
Yes, bruv.

88
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,442
- Would you like some sashimi?
- (Barry) I'm in LA.

89
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,474
(boy) Whoo! Come on, Santiago.

90
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,702
Come on! Back!

91
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,332
Ahh!

92
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,964
(coach) No es nada, muchacho.
No te preocupes.

93
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,217
Val, Iet me use your phone.

94
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,595
(phone rings)

95
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,763
Yo.

96
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,600
Glen, GIen. Mate.

97
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,312
Glen, I'm not a dickhead,
I didn't forget. No.

98
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:37,608
I'm in a business meeting, bruv. I'm in
a meeting. I'm in a meeting all morning.

99
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:43,238
Yeah, sorry, listen, mate. Do us a favor.
Can you send me a tape of your boy?

100
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,200
Glen, GIen. Gl...

101
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,830
PilIock!

102
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,501
(coach) Sigue, sigue asi. Ahi.

103
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,923
Vamos. Chutale, muchacho.

104
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,968
Goal! Yes!

105
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:12,267
- (coach) Bien, muchachoU bien.
- Yeah! Come on! Come on!

106
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,311
Bien hecho, Santiago, bien.

107
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,396
(final whistle)

108
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,484
(coach) Asi se gana.

109
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,620
- Hey, Grandma.
- Que bien estuviste.

110
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,956
Santiago, welI played, son. WelI done.

111
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,500
Thank you, thank you.
This is my little brother.

112
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,878
- Hello, how are you? Pleased to meet you.
- And this is my grandma.

113
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,297
- This is my daughter Val.
- Hi.

114
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,466
So you are the agent?

115
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,302
No, no, no, no.
This man arranged for the agent to come.

116
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:52,057
And he didn't, I'm afraid.
He's... you know, he's too busy.

117
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,143
So he'lI come to the next game?

118
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,854
No, no, I'm afraid he can't.

119
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,358
He's fIying back to England tomorrow.
So am I.

120
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,736
Look at that.
Maybe the oId man is right.

121
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,656
You dare to dream, get screwed.

122
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,994
Thanks anyway.

123
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,001
(phone rings)

124
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,724
- Hello. Who is this?
- This is Glen Foy.

125
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,768
Glen Foy? Do I know you, Mr. Foy?

126
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:41,440
Uh... WelI, I was one of your scouts
when you first took over.

127
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:46,862
You fired me, actualIy. WeIl, you brought
the new regime. I don't hold it against you.

128
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:51,742
Oh, you don't? So why are you calling me
at haIf past three in the morning?

129
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,536
Sorry. I'm in CaIifornia.

130
00:15:55,538 --> 00:16:00,876
I've just seen a young player.
I think he's a remarkable talent.

131
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,507
- Who does he pIay for?
- Oh, just local league. Kickabout stuff.

132
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:12,763
The point is, I'm on a plane home tomorrow
and I want you to make me a promise.

133
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:17,142
If he turns up on your doorstep,
will you see him?

134
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,229
- You want me to promise you this, right?
- Aye.

135
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,609
Just give him a run out.
That's all I'm asking.

136
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,986
If I say yes, can I go back to sleep?

137
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,906
Yes, Mr. DornheIm.

138
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,908
Then yes, Mr. Foy.

139
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,047
- Santiago.
- Hey.

140
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,759
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thank you. Why are you here?

141
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,679
Your coach told me where to find you.

142
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,479
(in English) If you get yourseIf to EngIand,
Newcastle United will give you a trial.

143
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,690
Newcastle United?

144
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,776
- That's a big club.
- A very big club.

145
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,786
(in English) He thinks I'm good enough.

146
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,956
Why you fiIl him with ideas like this?

147
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,583
Who the heIl do you think you are?

148
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:29,005
And you. Why don't you keep your feet on
the ground instead of your head in the sky?

149
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,342
Vamonos.

150
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,014
It's a big thing you ask, senor.

151
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:42,477
He's supposed to fly halfway
across the worId on something you say?

152
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:47,816
The manager's made me a promise.
He'lI give him a trial. The rest is up to him.

153
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,902
- Look in my eyes and answer me this.
- Grandma.

154
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,739
Can Santi make it as a professional?

155
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,241
Aye, I believe he can.

156
00:17:56,242 --> 00:18:00,412
Dad. We've gotta go. If the freeway's busy,
you're gonna miss your flight.

157
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,999
Here's my card.
It's all my numbers.

158
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,126
Think about it. Give me a ring.

159
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,253
It's good to meet you.

160
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,256
Good to see you.

161
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,249
You got enough?

162
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,547
- Enough what?
- Everyone knows the money's in the boot.

163
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,966
So are you going?

164
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,596
- Grandma thinks I should.
- What does Dad think?

165
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,932
I haven't asked him.

166
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,934
How far away is England?

167
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,686
Right now?

168
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,608
400 bucks too far.

169
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,777
Go back to sIeep.

170
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,028
Now.

171
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,960
Apurate, carajo.

172
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,969
There?

173
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,120
Thanks.

174
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,644
How couId you do this, Dad?

175
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,575
(in English) You knew what it was for.

176
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,953
- Two more weeks and I have enough.
- For what?

177
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,164
To chase a stupid dream?

178
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,711
Big-time baIlplayer in EngIand.
Come on. It's bulIshit.

179
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,548
And when you fail, how are you
gonna come back with no papers?

180
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:02,594
One chance, and you think I should
just give it up for what you do?

181
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,764
What I do is take care of my family.

182
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:10,769
In Mexico, I work construction!
At night, I clean up in a brotheI!

183
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,563
But I save enough to bring us to America.

184
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,108
And when your mother walk out on us...
No! When she walk out,

185
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,611
- I hold this family together.
- Leave her out of this.

186
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:23,782
I make enough for this house
and now we have our own business!

187
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:27,494
That's how things get better!
That's how you measure a man's life!

188
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,080
It's your life!

189
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,459
Not mine.

190
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,339
(wheezes)

191
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,564
(press) Gavin.

192
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,653
Gavin. Gavin.

193
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,577
Ladies and gentIemen,
this is a very good day for the club.

194
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,164
Gavin is a very gifted player

195
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,127
and should fit in very welI
with our setup here at St. James' Park.

196
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:22,215
I'm very pleased to present him... with this.

197
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,300
(applause)

198
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,016
Winning the league's out of sight, Erik.

199
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,519
What are your realistic goals
for the rest of the season?

200
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:39,524
Finishing in the first four and qualifying for
Europe. It's essential for a cIub like this.

201
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:44,404
To do that, you're gonna have to take
maximum points from your next games.

202
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,699
Look, the club has had
some probIems lately, yeah.

203
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,743
But...

204
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,996
I'm here now, yeah.

205
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:58,668
And I'm not in it for fame
or money or anything like that.

206
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:01,212
I like to win matches.

207
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,382
So maximum points
shouldn't be a problem.

208
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,092
Eh, boss?

209
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,939
(in English) So now
do I get a room to myseIf?

210
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,816
Come here.

211
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,320
Who's gonna help with your homework?
You won't do it.

212
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,156
He'lI do it.

213
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:55,618
Take a shower before you leave.
You smell real bad.

214
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,705
- Am I leaving tonight?
- Sure.

215
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,874
Before your father gets home.

216
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,126
Mira...

217
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,296
When your mother walked out on us,

218
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,217
I promised God I'd do everything
to heIp you boys foIlow your dreams.

219
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,641
You deserve this chance, Santiago.

220
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,983
Take it.

221
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,425
(PA) Passengers making
connecting flights from Mexico

222
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,054
should proceed to gate 1 4.

223
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,224
- Purpose of your visit?
- Excuse me?

224
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,727
- Business or pleasure?
- Business.

225
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,899
I play... I play soccer... footbaIl.

226
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,236
I hope to. For NewcastIe United.

227
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,865
One moment.

228
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,913
This young man wants to pIay
for your team, Mr. Henderson.

229
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,082
Newcastle?

230
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,583
Yes, sir.

231
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,836
Need alI the help we can get.

232
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,216
Glen. Phone.

233
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,639
Hello.

234
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,808
Who?

235
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,184
Santiago!

236
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,478
You're in England? Where?

237
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,981
Uh... Somewhere in London.

238
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,066
So, Glen...

239
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,568
how do I get to Newcastle?

240
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,283
. When you've waited for so long

241
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,956
. To be where you are

242
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,460
. And where you're coming from

243
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,277
Hey. How's it going?

244
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:38,656
Why didn't you caIl me from LA?
Let me know you were coming?

245
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,451
- Is it OK that I'm here?
- Oh, no. No, it's fine.

246
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:45,330
Just caught me a bit off guard, that's aIl.

247
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,626
Well, you'd best stay with me
tilI you get settled.

248
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,212
- OK.
- Welcome to the Toon.

249
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,133
- What is that?
- It's where the Geordies live.

250
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:01,304
- What is a Geordie?
- Someone that lives in the Toon.

251
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,473
You've a lot to learn, bonny lad.

252
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,768
You mean toons, like Looney Tunes
and stuff? Like Bugs Bunny?

253
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,083
Thank you.

254
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,920
- You Iive here alone?
- Aye.

255
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,547
Well, my daughter you met.

256
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:42,512
- Do you have a wife?
- She died a couple of years ago - cancer.

257
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,350
I'm sorry.

258
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,898
My grandma...

259
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,109
She sent you this.

260
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,194
Oh, it's...

261
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,073
She has it since she's a IittIe girI.

262
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,078
I'm not much of a Catholic, mind.

263
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,539
She thinks you're a good man, so...

264
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,754
Santiago, your dinner's ready.

265
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,840
Santiago.

266
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,367
(. "Cast No Shadow" by Oasis)

267
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:12,810
. Here's a thought for every man
who tries to understand

268
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,354
. What's in his hands

269
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:24,947
. He walks along an open road
of love and life

270
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,867
. Surviving if he can

271
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:37,960
. Bound with all the weight
of all the words he tried to say

272
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:44,008
. Chained to all the places
that he never wished to stay

273
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:49,972
. Bound with all the weight
of all the words he tried to say

274
00:30:50,057 --> 00:31:04,987
. As he faced the sun, he cast no shadow

275
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,331
I thought you worked in football.

276
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:19,377
Not anymore. I was finished a while back,
like some of these cars.

277
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:23,339
- You fix 'em?
- Aye, I fix them, restore them.

278
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:28,844
Listen, there'lI not be anyone
at the club tilI ten o'clock.

279
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,848
So why don't you get yourself something
to eat? Some breakfast or something?

280
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,601
- Yeah.
- Do you have any money?

281
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,187
No. But I'm OK.

282
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,485
- No, I can't.
- It's OK.

283
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,114
Take it. Turn right.

284
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,199
Just for now.

285
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,912
(boy) Here, mate, watch the balI.

286
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,998
Oh, no.

287
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,549
Hey, mister, can we have wor ball back?

288
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,096
- Quite tasty.
- Aye, if you work in a circus.

289
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,558
- I'm done. Sorry. Here.
- Nice one.

290
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,145
I hear some players
have a problem with Gavin Harris.

291
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,397
- Divvent Iike his attitude.
- Aye.

292
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,650
Well, three clubs in five years
should tell you something.

293
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,737
I think he's better playing on the inside.

294
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,989
If he's in a mood, he gets lost out wide.

295
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,907
Aye, right enough, like.

296
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,078
What are you looking at?

297
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,956
Sorry, but you're
talking about soccer, right?

298
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,917
- No.
- FootbaIl?

299
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:45,087
Oh, aye. Yeah.
That's all there is to talk about.

300
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,256
- Where are you from, son?
- Los Angeles.

301
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:51,677
Oh, aye? You know Charlize Theron?
She's a cracker, Iike.

302
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:56,265
- What are you doing up here?
- I have a tryout for NewcastIe United.

303
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,810
- A triaI, like? Howay.
- Are you serious, lad?

304
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,812
Yeah, yeah. Maybe today, actually.

305
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:05,024
You wanna lay off the bIack pudding, son.

306
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:11,113
- What is it exactly?
- You don't want to know.

307
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,994
FootbaIl's a reIigion here. London has any
number of teams, same in the Midlands.

308
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:21,499
Manchester, you've got two, Liverpool,
you've got two, Glasgow's got two.

309
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,210
Up here, though, it's just the Toon.

310
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,089
There she is.

311
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,814
- Is that the manager?
- Erik Dornhelm. Mr. Dornhelm.

312
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,149
He can be intimidating.
Look him in the eye.

313
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:50,361
I don't think my look wilI make a difference.

314
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:55,533
- It'lI be my feet.
- Mr. Dornhelm, excuse me. Glen Foy.

315
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,077
This is the young man
I was telling you about.

316
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,830
- Hi.
- He's from Los Angeles.

317
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,543
- Santiago Munez.
- (car stereo blares music)

318
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,545
When was this?

319
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,715
When I phoned you
in the middle of the night.

320
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,092
You promised to give him a trial.

321
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,678
Yes. One minute, please.

322
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,724
(Harris) Like that?
Score a hat trick, you can have it.

323
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:24,562
I'm sure you have a watch and I'm
absolutely sure it's an expensive one.

324
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,522
What time does it say?

325
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:30,359
Sorry, boss. I was dropping a shirt off
for a sick kid in hospital.

326
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,238
The PR people shouId have had a camera.
Would have been a realIy good photo op.

327
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:40,745
That, I think, is buIlshit. There are six
journaIists inside, waiting for 1 5 minutes.

328
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,372
Get in there.

329
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:47,918
- And today, you train with the reserves.
- Oh, f...

330
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,258
- Where do you play?
- Los Angeles.

331
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,552
I meant position.

332
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:00,139
Yeah. For my team, I play up front,
but I prefer midfieId.

333
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,892
That way, I see more of the ball.

334
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,066
Get him over to the training ground.
Let's see what he's got.

335
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,527
Will do. Thank you very much.

336
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,080
Hey, I'lI be around.

337
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:51,649
Oh, you're there.
How are you feeling, son?

338
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:55,611
- OK.
- Good. Mal Braithwaite. Club coach.

339
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,198
I've been a friend of Glen's
since he played here, so I'm on your side.

340
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,158
- AlI right?
- Yeah. Thank you, sir.

341
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,494
I'm not a sir. I'm a coach.

342
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:08,040
Sir is the gaffer. That's who's gonna
be watching you today, alI right? Fit?

343
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,125
- Yeah.
- Good. Let's go.

344
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,507
Come on. It'lI be fine.

345
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,385
Yeah.

346
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,474
- Come on!
- Get up the fieId!

347
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,353
- Behind you!
- Keep moving it!

348
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,480
Put it square!

349
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,232
Son.

350
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,402
I want you midfield, on the right. OK?

351
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,529
- Gavin... You know who Gavin is?
- No.

352
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,155
- Slot in behind him there.
- OK.

353
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,700
That's the feIla. OK?

354
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,662
- Get Adie off.
- Adie! Come off!

355
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:53,002
OK, pal. Swap bibs with him.
Do your best.

356
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,216
Hey, MaI. Mal! Who's the muppet?

357
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,219
He's from Mexico. Be gentIe, son.

358
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,555
Yeah, I'll look after him.

359
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,019
Hey, yo! Hey, yo! Yo!

360
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,366
That's it, PhiI!

361
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:29,622
- How are you, Mal? Bobby, how are you?
- AlI right, boss?

362
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:34,126
Franny, bring the kid into the game.

363
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,682
Look at me!

364
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,686
Here! Yo, yo!

365
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,606
Oh, fuck!

366
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,650
Ho, ho, ho!

367
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,655
- What? A bit Iouder, please.
- Oh, come on.

368
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,407
Here.

369
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,628
AlI right. Let me call you back.

370
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,872
Let the kid take it.

371
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,964
Go on. Have a go.

372
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,093
Face up. How many?

373
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,103
Adios, amigo.

374
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,526
Santiago.

375
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,489
Get yourself a shower.

376
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,368
I don't know, Glen.

377
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:17,790
My legs wouldn't do
what my brain was telling them.

378
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:21,085
I'll be better tomorrow. I promise.

379
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,880
There's not gonna be
a tomorrow, Santiago.

380
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:30,803
Get in the car.

381
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,410
You know, my father believes
people have a place in life.

382
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,080
You work, you feed your family.

383
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,790
You die.

384
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:05,337
And it's foolish to think otherwise.

385
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,308
- Excuse me, sir...
- I had a word with the fellow on the door.

386
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:24,022
He said I couId come in and just Iook
for someone. I won't be a second.

387
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:30,529
Mr. Dornhelm.
Glen Foy from this morning.

388
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:34,867
Listen, I'm sorry
to interrupt the proceedings.

389
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,202
Have I missed alI the boring speeches?

390
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,998
I'm making one of the "boring" speeches.
This distraction is not welcome.

391
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,334
Well, if you'd answered my calls,
I wouldn't be here.

392
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:49,298
- What do you want?
- Listen, this kid, Santiago Munez.

393
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:52,968
- Would you like to sit here?
- Sure. Thanks.

394
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,679
Listen, he's grown up
in poverty and hardship

395
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,183
and his only way out
is his skill with the ball.

396
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:02,853
He's fIown 6,000 miIes on my say-so.

397
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,480
He's jet-lagged. He's nervous.

398
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:10,235
You know, he's never seen mud before.
And you put him on a pitch like that.

399
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,031
And then you spend
the whole time on your mobile.

400
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:19,703
- I saw him flat on his ass most of the time.
- Yet there was one moment of magic.

401
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,665
When he took the ball on the bounce.

402
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,002
- Turned Magowan. Took it down.
- I saw it.

403
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:33,884
Looks good.
Hear they do you well here.

404
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,053
Listen, when I was a scout,

405
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,556
I used to spend the whole time,
on muddy days,

406
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,727
watching young lads
cIogging the shite out of each other,

407
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:49,524
and just once in a whiIe, there'd be one
that'd come along and Iift your heart.

408
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,194
Like this lad.

409
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,073
Just give him a month.

410
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,022
(door opens)

411
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,780
Ah, so you found aIl my yesterdays?

412
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,907
I was just looking.

413
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,286
My wife made this scrapbook.

414
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:45,289
You never told me
you were a major-league player.

415
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:49,584
Aye. WelI, not for as long as I'd have liked.

416
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,879
- Why?
- Got an injury. Did my knee in.

417
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,759
Look at that.
Shorts were shorter, hair was Ionger.

418
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,887
Didn't make £8 milIion a year, either.

419
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,808
- But you were still heroes.
- Oh, aye.

420
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,645
FootbaIlers have aIways been heroes,
even in my father's day, earning £8 a week

421
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,190
and working down the mine
at the same time.

422
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,988
- There you go.
- No, I can't accept it. It's too speciaI.

423
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,324
I'm not giving it to you.
Just try it on.

424
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,827
I want to see what you Iook like
in the bIack and white.

425
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,288
- What's the point?
- What's the point?

426
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,082
Well, you've got a month's trial.

427
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,465
Better phone your granny again.

428
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,344
(. "Acquiesce" by Oasis)

429
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:52,022
Right, Iisten up, you lot.
This is Santiago Munez. He's from Mexico.

430
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,691
- No. Los Angeles.
- Los Angeles. Whatever.

431
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,903
Before this day's done,
I want you to let him know who you are.

432
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,197
OK. Right, let's get to it.

433
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:04,034
. I don't know what is
that makes me feel alive

434
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,244
Push it hard! Hard!

435
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:13,168
Nice one, Franny!
Nice work! Come on!

436
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,170
1 5.

437
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,880
1 6.

438
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,091
1 7.

439
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:25,097
. Because we need each other

440
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:29,393
. We believe in one another

441
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,478
Come on, Santiago!

442
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,616
- Santi, I've been to Mexico once.
- Did you like it?

443
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,993
Gave me the shits for a week.

444
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,716
One day, son.

445
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:05,053
But not today. Come on, move!

446
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,434
Thank you.

447
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,396
- Do you want to sit down, pIease?
- OK.

448
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:44,634
- It may be a little high.
- Why's that?

449
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,722
Well, 'cause you are so cIose
and you smeIl nice.

450
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,643
It's normal.

451
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:59,608
- Are you the club doctor?
- No, I'm his nurse. He'lI examine you soon.

452
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,777
- Did you fill in the paperwork?
- Yeah.

453
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:06,573
Just a couple of words I didn't understand.

454
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,785
OK. Like what?

455
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,247
Like this one here.

456
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,376
That's "cardiovascular."
It means "heart problems."

457
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,545
Oh. No. No.

458
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,464
And how about that one?

459
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:28,762
"Respiratory" - do you have any problems
with your lungs or breathing?

460
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,389
Do you?

461
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,309
No.

462
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,978
Do you wanna step on the scales?

463
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,736
Right.

464
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,865
- What's your name?
- Nurse Harmison.

465
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,369
- I mean your first name.
- You don't need to know that.

466
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,163
You don't need to know where I live,
what my star sign is,

467
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,374
or what I'm doing on Saturday night.

468
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:03,255
- I'm gonna have to take bIood.
- Oh, man. RealIy? I don't like needles.

469
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,926
But you have a tattoo,
or is that a rub-on transfer?

470
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,929
- That was a gang thing.
- You were in a gang?

471
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:15,475
Not anymore.

472
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:22,524
There's only three ways to get out
of a gang - you get shot, you go to jail, or...

473
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:28,405
In my case, you have a grandmother
who kicks some sense into you. Ow!

474
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,949
Sorry, tough guy.

475
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:49,634
- What's your problem?
- Eh? Problem? What problem?

476
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,970
- Come on!
- Ignore him. He's a tit.

477
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,598
- Walk away.
- He's a knobhead. Laughing at you, mate.

478
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,058
- He's a knobhead, mate.
- Hey, forget him.

479
00:48:57,143 --> 00:49:00,562
- Knobhead? Knobhead?
- (Mal) Come on. Let's get a game going.

480
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:03,315
- How long did they give you?
- A month.

481
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,400
A month?

482
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,946
That's not Iong.
At least I got six.

483
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,741
I was with Tranmere Rovers before this.

484
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:15,160
They signed me from school
when I was 1 4.

485
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:18,246
- How's it going?
- Early days.

486
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:26,129
That's Gavin Harris.
They just signed him for £8 million.

487
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,175
Dining with the bum-bandit today,
are we, Jamie?

488
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:35,263
Hughie Magowan's 33. Unless every other
center back in the squad breaks his leg,

489
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:38,808
- he'lI not play for the first team again.
- Why be so pissed with me?

490
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:44,648
Well, you're the new kid on the block, son.
You've got something he never had - flair.

491
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,983
FIair?

492
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,486
Aye.

493
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:54,032
You know, most players, myself included,
they play within themselves.

494
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:58,411
They pIay to their strengths
so they don't expose their weaknesses.

495
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,289
The great players, the ones with flair,
they take risks,

496
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:04,668
because they don't beIieve they're risks.
Put your coat down here.

497
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,003
Three and in. You're in.

498
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,005
AlI righty.

499
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:13,551
They control the balI,
the ball doesn't control them.

500
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,637
Here.

501
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:22,852
Look at this.
Two jackets and a ball. It's aIl you need.

502
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,574
Finished with that, son?

503
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,037
Yeah.

504
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,124
Sorry. Sorry.

505
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,593
Santi.

506
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,679
(strains)

507
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,267
There you go.

508
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:06,062
Hey, listen.
I could show you the town if you like.

509
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,357
Tonight. Go cIubbing.

510
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,568
Bevvy. Women.

511
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,571
Yeah. Uh...
Do I need an ID or something?

512
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,824
- ID?
- Yeah.

513
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,285
- Identification?
- Yeah.

514
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:23,580
How oId do you have to be here
to get a drink?

515
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,081
Eleven.

516
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,682
AlI right, Gavin!

517
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:46,102
Listen, mate, if you want an autograph,
write to the cIub, you muppet.

518
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,939
Listen, Elvis, I'm with the club too.
Mate, I'm with the club too, you know.

519
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,609
I've never seen you before.

520
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,153
I don't go out much.

521
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:59,115
Hey! Hey!
Nurse Harmison! Nurse Harmison!

522
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,327
- Hi.
- You wanna come into this club with us?

523
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:05,163
No way. It's fulI of posers, that place.

524
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,541
- Yeah? Where are you going?
- We're going to The Spyglass.

525
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,127
- What do you say?
- Yeah, yeah.

526
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,425
Here we go, here we go.

527
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,642
Canny wine, this Rioja. It's from
your part of the worId, isn't it? Spain.

528
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,853
- No, I'm from LA.
- (Jamie) I'm from Merseyside.

529
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:32,565
LA? And Merseyside?
What are you two doing up here?

530
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,153
- Well...
- We play for NewcastIe.

531
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,490
I thought you said players were off Iimits.

532
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,493
Relax. They haven't made the reserves yet.

533
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:48,748
Well, as long as you're mired in mediocrity,
pet, you're in with a chance.

534
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,000
I'm sorry, but I don't know what that means.

535
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:55,380
It means don't change.
Don't become something you're not.

536
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:59,342
Well, my life's aIready changed,
just by being here.

537
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:03,388
I grew up on a council estate with a dad
on the dole and a mum on the booze.

538
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,807
Change is fine with me.

539
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,852
I remember you now.

540
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:11,521
- You're the one with the toe.
- What?

541
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,774
You had fungus behind your big toenail.

542
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:18,862
- What? Did you have to mention that?
- Oh, man.

543
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,698
I guess in your job,
you must see the whole team naked?

544
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:26,619
- I know what you're gonna say.
- I'm not gonna ask who has the biggest.

545
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:30,874
- OK, what were you gonna ask?
- Who has the smallest?

546
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,043
It must be you, because she cannot tell us.

547
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,713
- Go on. Come on.
- (Mal) Mark him, mark him.

548
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,215
Space, hit space.

549
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,927
Stick with him.

550
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:48,099
- Remember what I told you.
- Here. Here.

551
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,393
OK, pass. Pass the balI.

552
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,438
Pass it.

553
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,734
Why didn't you pass the ball, man?

554
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,486
- Hey, Mal.
- (whistle)

555
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,488
Munez.

556
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,532
Come here.

557
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:11,831
(Mal) Hey, lads. Over here.
Come on. Gather round.

558
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,584
Hey, MaI. Give me five minutes.

559
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,086
- OK, boss.
- Thank you.

560
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:23,593
So when I say go, I want you
to run as fast as you can to the goal.

561
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,678
- OK?
- Yeah.

562
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,680
Go.

563
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,435
Come back.

564
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,277
Again. Go.

565
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,666
What did you learn?

566
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:58,336
- That you can score from haIfway.
- No.

567
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,631
That the ball can travel faster than you.

568
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:05,677
Here, we pass the baIl.
You understand that?

569
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,805
We're a unit, not a one-man show.

570
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:12,642
The name on the front of the shirt is
more important than the one on the back.

571
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,978
- OK?
- Yeah.

572
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,149
- Santi.
- Hey.

573
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,904
(wheezes)

574
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,623
(. "Club Foot" by Kasabian)

575
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,754
(commentator) This is the final
countdown for Newcastle Utd.

576
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:45,508
Only three games left this season,
and to qualify for Europe

577
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,678
in the Champions League,
and all the riches that go with that,

578
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:52,015
they'll have to win them all - starting today.

579
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,651
Oh, man.

580
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,071
Never an easy team to beat, Chelsea.

581
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:10,033
- Well-coached, weIl-drilled.
- They certainIy are.

582
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,994
The game, yeah.

583
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,624
I'm with Gavin's girIfriend.
I'll call you back.

584
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,710
Lads.

585
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,720
(crowd chants) Toon, Toon!
Black and white army!

586
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:36,267
Toon, Toon! Black and white army!

587
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,895
. The color quits and all invade us

588
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:43,107
. There it goes again,
take me to the edge again

589
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,777
. All I got is a dirty trick

590
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:49,572
. I'm chasing down the walls to save ya

591
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,576
. I tell you I wanted you

592
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,790
. I tell you I needed you

593
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,086
. The blood ain't on my face

594
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,966
How's that possible?

595
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:19,435
(crowd roars)

596
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,614
For alI their possession,
you have to say

597
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:35,326
Newcastle haven't yet created
one cIear-cut chance.

598
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,830
- He's fading.
- Aye.

599
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:42,625
By a briIliant sense of positional pIay,
he's avoided contact with the ball.

600
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:46,337
- Well, maybe he's playing hurt.
- No, he's hungover.

601
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,798
- Right, get him off.
- Shola.

602
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:59,809
Now, this looks quite bad for NewcastIe.
The Iast thing they need is another injury.

603
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:03,479
They've already got
several waIking wounded out there.

604
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,151
Number ten off, mate.
Free kicks and get far post at corners.

605
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,696
(commentator) Wait a second.
It's Gavin Harris who's coming off.

606
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,698
What? Me?

607
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,536
He's taking Gavin off.
What the helI is he thinking about?

608
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:21,372
What are you thinking about,
you German twat?

609
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,333
(PA) Substitution for Newcastle United.

610
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,756
- What are you doing?
- Sit down!

611
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:37,513
(commentator) Only five minutes
left to play. Still no score.

612
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:40,850
Chelsea still have the upper hand.

613
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,685
(crowd roars)

614
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:55,865
(commentator) Goal!
They've got one at last.

615
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,700
And it's Patrick Kluivert.

616
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:23,351
- Evening, Mr. DornheIm.
- Good night, sir.

617
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,596
(chuckles)

618
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,057
Yeah!

619
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,062
What are you doing here?
Are you hurt?

620
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,232
- No, no, no, no. I got great news.
- What?

621
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,401
I made the reserve squad.

622
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:16,362
- Oh, that's great.
- I've only one week Ieft on my trial.

623
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:20,241
This game is make-or-break. If the boss
sees me do welI, he'lI keep me on.

624
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,286
- I'm sure he will.
- How! Do you play for NewcastIe?

625
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,163
- Yeah.
- Well, sign your name on that.

626
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,209
OK.

627
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,921
They'll aIl be asking
for your autograph soon.

628
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:37,216
Will that bother you?
What is your problem with footbalIers?

629
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:41,929
I don't have a problem with footbalI.
It's fame I have a problem with.

630
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:46,100
It's my dad's fauIt. He was in a rock band
that got hot for five minutes.

631
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,938
- No way. WouId I know him?
- (laughs) I doubt it. I was only three.

632
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:54,567
Anyway, the point is,
some of the pIayers remind me of him.

633
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,278
One minute they're nice,
uncomplicated guys

634
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:03,200
and the next they're ridiculously rich
arseholes who walk out on their families.

635
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,621
It was my mother who left mine.

636
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:13,544
- Why? What happened?
- My father never talks about it.

637
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:18,090
AlI I remember
is his anger and his drinking.

638
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:26,223
He's never seen me play.

639
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:33,481
I love that game. Love football.

640
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:36,567
Every night after school
and Sundays after church, I'd play.

641
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:39,820
AlI I hoped was that one day,
football couId be my whole life.

642
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:43,783
Why did you have to come so far
to make it happen?

643
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,953
For that, you have to ask the saints.

644
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,876
Why don't you telI him, Grandma?

645
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:06,680
(in English) TeIl him about the game.

646
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:34,708
Ey-up, lads.
Sit down. Pay attention.

647
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:39,004
Dagger's hamstring is holding up,
so we'lI give him a half.

648
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,966
Santiago, I want you on the right flank.

649
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,510
Track the number eight.
He's a sIippery bugger.

650
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,846
- I'Il translate that for you later.
- Jamie.

651
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:49,348
I want you to slot in behind the two strikers.

652
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,810
Remember, don't Iet 'em
panic you into playing football.

653
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:55,729
- Howay.
- Right! Come on! Let's go!

654
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,817
(Jamie) Let's kick some arse, fellas!

655
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,361
Come on, boys!
Let's go! Let's do this!

656
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,043
(wheezes)

657
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,909
What's that?

658
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,165
What's wrong with him?

659
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,299
(whistle)

660
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:08,385
Right! Let's have a look!
Let's have you back!

661
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,931
Jackie, how are we?
Santiago! Get back!

662
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:34,578
Here, mate. Do you wanna put on
a red shirt? You're having a shocker!

663
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,580
You all right?

664
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:42,878
- I think that's enough.
- I think you're right.

665
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,431
OK.

666
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,645
Go and get yourself an early bath, son.

667
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,583
What's the matter?
Are you hurt?

668
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,253
Been out on the town?

669
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,926
Is there something
you want to teIl me, son?

670
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,766
OK.

671
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,980
I don't know, Santi.

672
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,691
I know you've got the skiIl.

673
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:51,113
But maybe you don't have the pace
or the stamina for the EngIish game.

674
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:54,825
Maybe you'd be better off
pIaying back in LA.

675
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,123
I'm gonna have to let you go, son.

676
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:22,936
- Yes?
- Does Roz live here?

677
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,898
Rosie, it's for you.

678
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,485
Oh, God.
Mam, I'm a wreck.

679
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:34,031
Are you the young man from LA?

680
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:36,325
Yes. Santiago.

681
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,410
- She'lI be down in a minute.
- Thank you.

682
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,871
- Can I get you anything, pet?
- No, thank you.

683
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:44,375
I went there years ago
when my husband's band was on tour.

684
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:48,420
We stayed at the Hyatt House on Sunset.
CaIled it the Riot House in those days.

685
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:51,799
- Aren't you meeting your friends?
- No mad rush.

686
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:57,221
Nice to meet you, Santiago.

687
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:59,181
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

688
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,019
- I love that name.
- Off you go.

689
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,822
- What's wrong?
- I lied to you.

690
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,200
At the physical.

691
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:24,206
- I have asthma.
- OK, weIl, have you told them?

692
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,542
If I had, they wouldn't have given me a triaI.

693
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:29,169
- So telI them now.
- Too late.

694
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:34,341
- They fired me.
- Oh, Sant.

695
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,761
I'm so sorry.

696
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,225
I came to say goodbye.

697
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,270
- You're Ieaving?
- Tomorrow.

698
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:50,149
- Why so soon?
- I don't belong here if I'm not in the team.

699
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,776
Well, you can find another team.

700
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:55,320
I guess I was just...

701
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:59,658
I was just dumb to think
I could make this work.

702
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:04,204
- Worst thing is I've Iet peopIe down.
- No.

703
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,504
- Who, pet?
- Glen.

704
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,176
My grandma. My grandma.

705
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,345
This happens to players all the time.

706
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:25,559
It's part and parcel of the game.

707
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:41,909
No. We...

708
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,913
We hardly know each other.

709
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,612
Shit!

710
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,356
- Aren't you...
- No.

711
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,819
I can see why they took you off last week.
You're shite.

712
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,877
Been shagging them Armitage sisters?

713
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:17,504
Well, you're not the first.

714
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:19,590
(phone rings)

715
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:26,388
- Paradise Taxis.
- I need one. Urgent. This is Gavin Harris.

716
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,516
And I'm Clint Eastwood. Make my day.

717
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:34,021
But I'm serious.
This is me. I need a ride, pronto.

718
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:39,234
- (man) Are you anywhere near Blakelaw?
- Why?

719
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:42,696
Gavin Harris is stuck on the estate
and needs a car, desperate.

720
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:48,076
- I've aIready got a fare.
- He's first team, man. Get there ASAP.

721
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:52,414
Gotta do a detour, bonny lad.
Celebrity in periI.

722
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,421
Agh!

723
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,718
You're that kid from LA?
You going to training as well?

724
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,430
- No, I have to get to the station.
- Why?

725
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:11,099
- I screwed up.
- Tell me about it on the way.

726
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:14,102
I don't know what
the gaffer wilI do if I'm late.

727
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,196
So you're Gavin Harris?

728
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:27,074
- Guilty.
- You're shite.

729
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,954
So I've heard.
Come on, Santi.

730
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:35,582
With all due respect, gaffer, Mr. Dornhelm,

731
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:38,752
the club wilI be making a big mistake
if they let this lad go.

732
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,296
I've played with him,
I've played against him.

733
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,508
I can see he's got it.
So can aIl of the other lads.

734
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:48,261
- I mean, technically...
- What? He's better than you?

735
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,683
Well.

736
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:56,103
He's in that league.

737
01:11:56,104 --> 01:12:01,775
What happened Iast night was he lost his
inhaler. He's got asthma, for God's sake.

738
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,319
Is this true?

739
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:07,072
Yes, sir, but I tried to hide it.

740
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,742
Lying is a probIem.
Asthma is not.

741
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,328
You can get shots,
medication, acupuncture.

742
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:16,498
Didn't your doctor back home
explain this to you?

743
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:20,919
I don't have a doctor.
AlI I got is a free clinic in LA.

744
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:30,637
- People keep pleading your case, Munez.
- AlI I wanna do is prove them right, sir.

745
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:33,140
If you give me the chance.

746
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:36,268
- You think you deserve it?
- I know I do.

747
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,317
Good.

748
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:47,863
See the doc.
TeIl him about your condition.

749
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:51,283
Then report for training. AIl right?

750
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,955
Thank you.

751
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,250
Gavin.

752
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:06,715
This is a decent thing you did.

753
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,384
Yeah, I do what I can.

754
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,181
Now expIain why are you
dressed for discotheque

755
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:16,933
and 47 minutes late for training?

756
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:37,996
- Come on!
- You Iike him?

757
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,165
Yeah.

758
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,709
Go on.

759
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,337
(whistle)

760
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:50,050
- Stand up, Santi.
- (re¤ree¤ Away you go, fellas. Away.

761
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,135
Yes, please.

762
01:13:58,226 --> 01:14:00,477
Yeah!

763
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,863
(whistle)

764
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,909
- Bloody late.
- Got there as quick as I could.

765
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:18,411
(re¤ree¤ Hughie, Hughie.
Yes, please, felIa.

766
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:20,705
No more of that.
That is naughty, OK?

767
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:23,750
- Away you go.
- He'Il think twice about doing you again.

768
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:27,087
- Thought you didn't Iike me.
- My sister wiIl be upset if you get hurt.

769
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:30,882
She thinks you look Iike Antonio Banderas.

770
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:35,387
Hey, if you shag her, I'Il kill you!

771
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,208
(c¤wd ¤ars)

772
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:19,681
- Be careful.
- OK. I can't see a thing.

773
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,767
OK, you're almost there. Little step.

774
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,353
Little step down. Right.

775
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,191
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

776
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,195
- Can you beIieve this?
- No.

777
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,489
A month ago, I said goodbye to the city,
goodbye to you.

778
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,783
And now I've got a contract.

779
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:42,746
- And this little apartment.
- How can you afford it, though?

780
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,748
(toilet flushes)

781
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,626
Gavino.

782
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,794
Say hello to my friend.

783
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,588
Hello.

784
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,840
Oh.

785
01:15:53,925 --> 01:15:56,801
I didn't say you couId bring women here.

786
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,304
Oh, I'm sorry. ShaIl I go?

787
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:07,938
- I'm just kidding, man. Ciao¤ ¤e¤¤a.
- How's it going?

788
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:12,484
Oh, make yourselves at home.
There's finger stuff in the fridge.

789
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,946
Oh. Takeaway pizzas and Iadies knickers?

790
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:20,283
Not hard to figure out his lifestyIe, is it?

791
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:23,495
He's all right.
He saved my ass, remember?

792
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:29,793
- Got a bit of a rep is what I've heard.
- For professionals, footbalI is our life.

793
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,802
- Good to see you.
- How are you tonight?

794
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:41,346
Gavin, you all right?

795
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,765
(¤ dance music)

796
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,331
Colin, it's a very good offer,
but just forget about it.

797
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,834
I'll tell you.
'Cause the chairman is a tosser.

798
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:14,254
The manager knows and says nothing,
which makes him a bigger tosser.

799
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,381
The players know it.

800
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:21,094
Yeah, it's all clans and cliques
in the dressing room, innit, luv?

801
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,680
- Yeah. Gav.
- Little bit on your nose, mate.

802
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:28,059
24-7, mate.
Listen, what's cool and hangs up?

803
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,936
AlI right, mate.

804
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:32,856
- AlI right, Baz.
- Look at you. Crispy, mate. How are you?

805
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,942
- Say heIlo to Santi.
- Heard it's going good, mate.

806
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:39,946
- Notched a pair for the reserves Saturday.
- Oi, oi¤

807
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:42,198
(¤ dance music continues)

808
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:48,371
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you doing?

809
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:52,250
So, Santi. You got your contract sorted
to the end of the season?

810
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:57,047
Do you mind if I ask actuaIly
who handled that for you?

811
01:17:57,048 --> 01:17:59,382
- Glen.
- Glen Foy?

812
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:02,719
- Works in a garage, bruv.
- Well, it's not actually...

813
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:07,640
Don't get me wrong, he's a loveIy felIa.
He used to be an absoIute cracking player.

814
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:12,062
But what does he know
about marketabiIity?

815
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,732
What does he know about endorsements?

816
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:19,235
You make the first team,
Santi, next season...

817
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:23,239
I'll get you a Gap ad.

818
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,408
Crunch.

819
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,080
Hey, pet. Do you fancy a dance?

820
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,290
Watch out, he's a salsa man.

821
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,085
No, thank you. Sorry.

822
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,411
(phone rings)

823
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:11,996
Hello.

824
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:15,625
Santiago? Hey, bro.
What's going on?

825
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:18,086
No way.

826
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,546
Hey, Papa. It's Santiago.

827
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:28,847
(in ¤n¤lish) He can't taIk right now, OK?

828
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,603
No problem, man.

829
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,526
Ey-up, lads.

830
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:45,029
Take them up the back pitch, Andy.
Give 'em a stretch.

831
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:47,282
(¤a¤o¤an) Kicked me out, bin-bagged.

832
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:51,453
- I've got my eye on you, Hughie.
- See you in the showers, Bobby.

833
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:58,209
- What's up?
- What's up? I just saw the reserve list.

01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,590
Dad!

998
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,596
Dad! Wake up, Dad¤
Dad, wake up!

999
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,942
Hey, Glen.

1000
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:39,947
Hey. I meant to come over and explain
about that thing in the newspaper.

1001
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:42,658
Santi, I had a call from LA.

1002
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:45,953
You need to phone your grandmother.

1003
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,048
(sobs)

1004
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:05,306
- Glen, what's happened?
- His father.

1005
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:07,474
Heart attack, apparently.

1006
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,686
Is he going to be all right?

1007
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:13,147
Dead.

1008
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:27,578
- I've got it.
- No, it's OK, man.

1009
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:30,331
Here.

1010
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:33,334
Thanks for everything.

1011
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:37,838
Safe journey.

1012
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:50,017
- Yes, boss.
- There you go. Brilliant, thank you.

1013
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:51,977
Hey, boss.

1014
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:56,523
- Can I have a word?
- Yes, please.

1015
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:01,695
Uh...

1016
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:05,407
- I was the other bloke in that picture.
- I'm shocked.

1017
01:35:05,492 --> 01:35:08,827
And I thought you should know...

1018
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:12,623
it was me that dragged Santi
to that party to begin with.

1019
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:16,627
He didn't even wanna go.
It's not his scene. He's a good lad.

1020
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,088
I take fuIl responsibility.

1021
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:24,218
Boys with big bank accounts are still boys.

1022
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,888
This is not an excuse for you anymore.

1023
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:30,891
- You're how oId?
- 2¤.

1024
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:35,562
- 2¤, I think.
- Yeah. Around that.

1025
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:39,733
The young players should
be looking to you for an example.

1026
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:42,986
Off the field as well as on.
Am I right?

1027
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:47,699
I hear what you're saying, boss.

1028
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:51,036
And...

1029
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,873
you're not the first person to say it.

Sir, we're boarding now.

Keep stretching, Iads.
It'lI be a long day.

1037
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:13,327
What the helI are you doing here?
Why aren't you on the plane?

1038
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:16,997
I'm sitting in the airport
and I think to myseIf,

1039
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:19,333
at least now I have an excuse.

1040
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:23,462
A reason to give my buddies and
everybody else why things didn't work out.

1041
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:28,509
"Hey, my dad died. I had to come home,
take care of business."

1042
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:33,847
- Know why I needed an excuse?
- No.

1043
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:36,975
Because that's the way
my father made me think.

1044
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:39,186
He took away my seIf-belief.

1045
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:43,649
He made it impossible
¤o h¤v¤... aspiraci¤n.

1046
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:46,860
- Aspiration, you understand?
- Yes.

1047
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:49,029
I don't need an excuse.

1048
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:53,825
The only person who can telI me
I'm not good enough is you.

1049
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:00,040
And even then...

1050
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:05,170
I may not agree with you.

1051
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:15,722
You are right, Santi.

1052
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,518
There's no point in coming back.

1053
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:22,437
It's God's will.

1054
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:26,400
Si, hi¤ito. ¤uidate.

1055
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:36,201
Hey.

1056
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:37,536
Hi.

1057
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:45,127
So how are you feeling?

1058
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:50,465
I never made peace with my dad.

1059
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:54,094
- He never made peace with you either.
- No, but he never forgave me.

1060
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,179
You don't know that.

1061
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:59,474
How can you know that?

1062
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:03,228
What about aIl those pictures
you sent home?

1063
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:07,733
I don't know where home is anymore.

1064
01:39:07,734 --> 01:39:09,901
Yeah, you do.

1065
01:39:09,902 --> 01:39:14,156
It's green
and it's got a goalpost at each end.

1066
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:49,024
Munez.

1067
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:05,666
How are you doing?

1068
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:09,836
OK, boss.

1069
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:14,132
Tough thing to lose a father.
I remember when I lost mine.

1070
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,677
Thank you.

1071
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:23,934
You shouldn't be here.
The groundsman is having a fit.

1072
01:40:23,935 --> 01:40:25,936
His turf is sacred.

1073

1074
01:40:29,816 --> 01:40:32,359
I just wanted to see what it feIt like.

1078

Yeah!

1081
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:06,476
I'm in the squad for the Liverpool game.

1082
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,355
- Get us a ticket, then, wiIl you?
- Yeah.

1083
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:12,983
Well done, son. Well done.

1084
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:17,404
Well, I never doubted it, son. First time
I saw you, I said to Phil, didn't I, Phil?

1085
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,823
- That lad's got it.
- No, you didn't.

1086
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:24,035
I owe you, man.
Breakfast, remember?

1087

- Where?

We're meeting a couple of girls at a club
and then back to my gaff.

La vida loca.

My ass is freezing.

to start with young Santiago Munez.

It's only his second-ever appearance
for the senior side.

1111

I guess they'll be hoping
he produces some o¤ the flair

as a substitute at Fulham last week.
