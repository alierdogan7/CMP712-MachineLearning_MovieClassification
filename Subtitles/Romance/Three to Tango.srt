1
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:00,402
So we walk in...

2
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:01,836
...shake hands....

3
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:03,032
Where do we sit?

4
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:04,302
Down.

5
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,274
-Right. Good. Down.
-Yeah, why not?

6
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,108
-Will you say hello first, or am l?
-Why don't l?

7
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:12,808
-Good. This is gonna be okay.
-lt's gonna be marvelous.

8
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:14,651
Are you sure?

9
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:18,722
l dreamt that when we walked into
this meeting, l had no clothes on.

10
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:20,484
Well, l was wearing a doily.

11
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:24,889
And Julie McCoy from The Love Boat
was there and she had three breasts.

12
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:29,733
And then we kind of fell into
a hot tub. And all of a sudden...

13
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:31,937
...she wanted a commitment!

14
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:35,101
l'm freaking out.
l'm freaking out.

15
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:36,298
Okay, Oskie...

16
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,570
...this is what we're gonna do.
We're gonna have a signal.

17
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:42,447
lf you start to babble,
just watch the signal.

18
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,512
No babbling, no chatting...

19
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:47,581
...no small talk. We got
a signal now so we can do this.

20
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:50,617
Okay, yes. You're right.
We can do it. Thank you.

21
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:54,419
We'll walk in there and
kick some ass. Say it with me.

22
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:56,289
lKick some ass!

23
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:01,160
Hold me.

24
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:09,506
lt's a bit much, l know.

25
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:12,007
You look intimidating
in this picture.

26
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:14,374
l asked, but they wouldn't
run a nude photo.

27
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:18,018
Now that would have been
really intimidating.

28
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,485
What are you doing today?

29
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,483
l can't disclose that information.

30
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,729
You never tell me anything.

31
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:31,487
l love it when you
get all mushy like that.

32
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:35,499
This song is too slow.

33
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:43,436
When do l see you again?

34
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:46,745
Whenever l feel like it.

35
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,406
Mr. Newman.

36
00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:54,484
lt is now 3:55.

37
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:59,382
From 4 until 6:30, you will be hearing
proposals for the cultural center.

38
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,322
l'll be right out.

39
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:05,056
Also, your wife called.

40
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,598
She's expecting you for dinner
at The Ritz at 8.

41
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,630
-Thank you.
-l'm out of here.

42
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:11,737
-Wait, Amy, let me--
-Call me later.

43
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:20,936
l'll buzz you when the first
team of architects arrives.

44
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:42,468
Peter, before we go in,
l just wanted to say...

45
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,071
...that l would never have an
opportunity like this without you.

46
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:47,203
So, you know...

47
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:51,208
...whatever happens in there,
l just want you to know...

48
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:54,804
...that l'm very honored
to be your partner.

49
00:05:56,817 --> 00:06:01,254
You are the best partner
that a man could ever have.

50
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:07,053
Now, let's go inside before you
start singing or something, okay?

51
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,291
Look at this.

52
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,262
lt's Gilligan and the Skipper too.

53
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:18,066
What have you studmuffins
been up to lately?

54
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,007
Well, we've become triathletes,
actually. We bike, we swim, we....

55
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:26,075
-Also do the third thing.
-That's right.

56
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,613
Congratulations on your work in
that men's room in the bus station.

57
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,250
Yes, your use of mosaic
in the urinal trough...

58
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:35,513
...was reminiscent of our mural
in the Hancock Building.

59
00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:37,657
Except people don't piss on ours.

60
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:40,588
That's not true.
We read the reviews.

61
00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:42,125
Ouch. Humor.

62
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:46,259
Decker and Strauss.

63
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:49,969
-Let's go nail this job.
-See you.

64
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:56,374
Watch your feet.

65
00:06:58,646 --> 00:06:59,806
Pardon me.

66
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:03,040
Well, l'm not worried. You?

67
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:05,945
No. Absolutely not.

68
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,982
-We're dead.
-Yeah, we're dead.

69
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,792
Sir, the Charles Newman
Cultural Center...

70
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:25,631
...would redefine cultural life
in the city.

71
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,966
There'd be a museum,
an opera house...

72
00:07:28,342 --> 00:07:30,242
...an international food court.

73
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:32,569
Picasso...

74
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,744
...Madame Butterfly...

75
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,713
...burritos.

76
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:39,877
lnteresting.

77
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:44,682
Steinberg and Novak.

78
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:47,251
Oskie?

79
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,328
-Good luck, ladies.
-Thank you.

80
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:54,063
Gentlemen.

81
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:58,728
So you've worked with those two men?

82
00:07:58,939 --> 00:07:59,906
We did.

83
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:03,167
Are they really, you know, partners?

84
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:08,508
Of course...

85
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:10,877
...Peter is, you know....

86
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:12,878
-But Oscar--
-No, Josh.

87
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:16,579
Actually, Josh--
No, Oscar is very, very, you know.

88
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:19,883
lt's nice to meet you, sir.
lt's nice to meet you, sir.

89
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:23,187
They hang out at, you know, bars.

90
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:26,298
And they march in the,
you know, parade.

91
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,797
They have, you know...

92
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:30,027
...sex with, you know, men.

93
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:33,629
-lt's very nice to meet you, sir.
-He can hear you.

94
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:35,433
-No, he can't.
-Yes, he can.

95
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:39,100
-l'm Peter Steinberg. Oscar Novak.
-lt's nice to meet you.

96
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,974
-How you guys doing today?
-Great.

97
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:42,307
Couldn't be better.

98
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,244
lt's an honor to meet you.

99
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:47,079
And your office is--
Hey, you have a Buddha.

100
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:52,054
Oh, l love Buddhas. They're, like,
bright, cheery, naked Asian Santas.

101
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,157
l had a buddy in college.

102
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,124
His name was Bob,
and we called him...

103
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,524
...''Buddha Bob'' ...

104
00:08:57,731 --> 00:08:59,824
...because he was kind of fat...

105
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,899
...and he liked
to walk around naked...

106
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:03,967
...and we rubbed his belly for luck.

107
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:08,335
Anyway...

108
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:10,474
...l love Buddha.

109
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:12,439
He rocks.

110
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:15,679
The Buddha is an important
spiritual figure...

111
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:19,148
...from which l draw
tremendous inspiration.

112
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,250
Just kidding.

113
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:27,218
Let me hear what you have.

114
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,896
The Telford was not just
considered a great museum...

115
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:34,761
...but a wonder of the age.

116
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:37,429
l barely recognize it.

117
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:40,038
We propose a renovation
that modernizes...

118
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,765
...the Telford, without
eclipsing its classic glory.

119
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:45,035
To us, the Telford
is a work of art...

120
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,338
...one of Chicago's true monuments.

121
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:51,006
Preserving it would be more than
a job for us. lt's an opportunity--

122
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:52,315
Sorry.

123
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:54,786
Just a second.

124
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,092
Lenore.

125
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:00,983
-Lenore.
-Yes, Mr. Newman.

126
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:04,527
Bring in Decker and Strauss
and my echinacea drops.

127
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:11,994
l liked your presentation.

128
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:13,904
Big, modern, bold.

129
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:18,477
And preserving the old and contrasting
it with the new. l like that too.

130
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:21,176
You especially l like.

131
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:23,175
Passionate, sincere...

132
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,580
...goofball.

133
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:26,719
You find him?

134
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:28,486
Found him...

135
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:29,883
...and housebroke him.

136
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,552
This is what we're gonna do.

137
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:37,387
You'll each build a model...

138
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:38,428
...big models...

139
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:39,894
...and we'll do it...

140
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,863
...in the Telford itself.

141
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:43,899
What do you guys think of that?

142
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:45,036
l love it!

143
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:47,240
The press will love it.
And then...

144
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:49,733
...l pick the winner.

145
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:52,434
Well, l just, l think that's...

146
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:55,446
...a fantastic, fantastic idea.

147
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:58,818
You pay for these models
out of your own budget.

148
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,986
Do you know how unfair it is,
him getting your hopes up like that?

149
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:07,058
l mean, as if you two even
have a ghost of a chance.

150
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:08,193
Tell you what.

151
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:11,455
When we get the job, we'll throw
some men's rooms your way.

152
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:17,398
-How much is this gonna cost?
-$1 50,000.

153
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:19,765
Well, that's too much.
That's too much.

154
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:24,307
l could take out a second
mortgage on my apartment.

155
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:28,572
Come on. You have already invested
everything into this company.

156
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:30,476
l can't let you do that.

157
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,081
We have to.

158
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:34,649
We don't have to.

159
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:38,086
We're gonna get this job.

160
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:42,261
We're gonna kick ass.
We're gonna kick big ass!

161
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:44,088
l love you! l love you!

162
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,431
l love you!

163
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:52,436
-We were just--
-Very nice to meet you both today.

164
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:53,932
Here we go.

165
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,913
Well, that seems to
be a close partnership.

166
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:03,105
Yeah, they seem very close.

167
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,576
What do you mean?

168
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:06,914
You know.

169
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,052
Really?

170
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,350
Both gay? The goofball too?

171
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:14,024
Openly.

172
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:29,103
Wow! l'm so excited.
l'm overly excited.

173
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:49,490
l have some bad news.

174
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:52,227
l can't make it to
your opening at the gallery.

175
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:56,399
l did my best, but Olivia's been
planning this benefit for months.

176
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:57,467
That's okay.

177
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:07,580
-l'm sick about the whole thing.
-lt's all right, Charles.

178
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:11,484
So who's gonna be there?

179
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:13,544
Charles, don't start.

180
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:15,654
lt's a perfect opportunity...

181
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:18,848
...for one of these clowns you dated
to try to get back in.

182
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:20,185
Charles, come on.

183
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:22,088
What about that guy
from art school...

184
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:26,062
...the one who paints world flags
on people's asses...

185
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,858
...and then he photographs it?

186
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:29,360
l hate that guy.

187
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,670
Not to mention lKevin Cartwright...

188
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:33,863
...with his big, grotesque muscles...

189
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:36,575
...and his Mr. Nice Guy act and his--

190
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:44,339
lKevin. lt's so good to see you.
l got a little cold.

191
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:48,752
Great game last week.

192
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:52,315
-Congratulations on the new contract.
-Thanks.

193
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:56,528
l'll use these big, grotesque muscles
to load this stuff in the van.

194
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,288
See you at the gallery.

195
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,800
Charlie, you look good.
You been working out?

196
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:05,267
Thanks, lKevin.
You're a lifesaver.

197
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:17,414
lmagine a dome, flanked by four
sky-lit pyramids on either side.

198
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:22,179
What Oscar and l see is a convergence
of two classical styles...

199
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:23,378
...with an interplay--

200
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,649
Mr. Newman, l'd like
to say at this juncture...

201
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:28,555
...how grateful we are
for this opportunity.

202
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:31,822
l mean, we're excited and indebted.

203
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:33,556
Oscar, you might want to...

204
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:37,134
...save some of your dignity
for later, in case you need it.

205
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:39,532
l'm just telling him
how thrilled we both--

206
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,765
l appreciate your loyalty, Oscar.

207
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:44,466
lt's a rare commodity these days.

208
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:47,777
Can l talk to you
for a moment privately?

209
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,121
You know, you're quite a guy,
Oscar Novak.

210
00:14:57,524 --> 00:15:00,186
''Novak.'' That's Hungarian, right?

211
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:01,752
Great.

212
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:04,528
You know, Lenore told me about....

213
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:09,900
Anyways, l told her l think
it's great to have people of your...

214
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:13,505
...background working for me.
You and Peter.

215
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,631
Peter isn't.

216
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:16,704
He isn't?

217
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:19,603
No. l am, though,
1 00 percent.

218
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:22,141
l see.

219
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:25,180
You'd be surprised
how many of us there are.

220
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:27,285
Whatever.
lt doesn't bother me.

221
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:30,553
Can l be honest with you?

222
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:34,316
l'm married.

223
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:37,496
Well, how nice for you.

224
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:39,892
l also have a girlfriend.

225
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:41,765
Great.

226
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:44,835
Amy is an amazing woman.

227
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:46,400
Artist.

228
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:49,164
lmpulsive. Unpredictable.

229
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:51,003
A free spirit.

230
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:54,309
Tonight she opens
an exhibit of her work.

231
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:55,845
l can't be there.

232
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,984
This was very upsetting to me, but...

233
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,051
...l'm not upset anymore.

234
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,084
You're not?

235
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:03,586
Because you'll be there.

236
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,223
-l'll be there?
-Great.

237
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,154
l'd like you to stay close to her.

238
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,624
Tell me who she talks to,
that sort of thing.

239
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,923
There's one guy in particular,
lKevin Cartwright.

240
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,327
Ex-boyfriend of hers.
Real persistent guy.

241
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:17,002
l'm very worried about him.

242
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,473
What do you say?

243
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:29,739
Peter Stoyanovich kicking it away.

244
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,418
Holdman will grab it
back on the seven.

245
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:34,211
Go, buddy. Go, go, go!

246
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:40,420
Run me through this one more time.
Charles asked you...

247
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:42,322
...to spy on his mistress...

248
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:44,622
...and you just said yes?

249
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:47,628
-What else could l have said?
-Let's see.

250
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:48,798
No.

251
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,367
What do we got this week?

252
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:52,799
-Dim sum.
-Awesome.

253
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:55,401
Hurry up and ''dimmy some.''

254
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:58,976
Rick, Rick.
You don't put ketchup on dim sum.

255
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:00,242
Why?

256
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,677
Because, Rain Man, dim sum
are not French fries.

257
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:08,321
lt is important to me that you grasp
the delicacy of the situation.

258
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,717
You can't just go off
on a spying expedition.

259
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:12,858
Let him go.
What's the big deal?

260
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,050
-Catch the ball, for chrissake!
-Come on!

261
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:17,389
-What do you think?
-You mean as clothing?

262
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:19,827
So this honey, Charles' girlfriend...

263
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,263
...is she hot?

264
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:24,397
He can't go out with an ugly girl.

265
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:27,198
Give it up for Charles.
What did l say?

266
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:28,840
l don't know what she looks like.

267
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,408
l do know that before
she went out with Charles...

268
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:33,511
...she went out with lKevin Cartwright.

269
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:35,237
-Holy shit!
-Really?

270
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:36,412
Who?

271
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,080
The running back.

272
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:39,252
We watch him every week.

273
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:40,885
For seven seasons.

274
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,622
There you go.

275
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,292
There it is.

276
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:49,189
You know what the deal is
with that guy?

277
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:52,194
-He caught a really big fish?
-No, man.

278
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,956
That he's hung like an army mule.

279
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:57,129
They call it the ''Ponderosa.''

280
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:01,169
Like from Bonanza?
The Cartwrights?

281
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:02,602
The Ponderosa?

282
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:04,805
-Word up?!
-Word up?

283
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,535
You're white, man. Let it go.

284
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:10,739
l don't think you gents are grasping
the gravity of the situation.

285
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:14,717
This job could really land
Oscar and l in the major leagues.

286
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:17,216
Since Charles is
such a big, important guy...

287
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:21,260
...chances are that
his girlfriend is a foxy one.

288
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:25,325
That's the problem. We know how Oscar
handles himself around the honeys.

289
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:32,433
Give me some credit.
l have a degree of self-control.

290
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:35,107
l don't fall over
every pretty girl l see.

291
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:38,243
-The man's got complete control.
-Yeah, you're paranoid.

292
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:39,343
Yeah, okay?

293
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:40,568
So don't worry.

294
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,247
-Good night, guys.
-Later.

295
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:43,973
Where you going?

296
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:46,379
l want you back here by 1 0:00!

297
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:48,349
Dorm check at 1 1 :00!

298
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:53,016
You know what's funny?

299
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:55,258
You're so screwed.

300
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:58,387
Start looking for another job.

301
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:01,729
Who wants to get bitch-slapped first?

302
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:06,735
l'll go second.

303
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,913
l had no idea things
were so hairy in Bosnia.

304
00:19:57,157 --> 00:20:00,422
The yellows and purples,
l love all this. Let me show you.

305
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,090
Excuse me.

306
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:36,688
Shit! Piss!

307
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,122
Damn it! For chrissakes!

308
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:41,196
Someone's supposed
to secure these things.

309
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,369
Thank you. You saved me.

310
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:48,174
Well, you have to protect
something as beautiful as you.

311
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:50,776
As it.

312
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:54,140
You're not beautiful,
the sculpture is.

313
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:57,842
l am so sorry. This never should
have happened. By the way...

314
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:00,451
...have l told you
how enchanting you look?

315
00:21:01,354 --> 00:21:02,480
Spectacular.

316
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:14,226
l saw you catch that piece.
Nice moves.

317
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:16,994
Thanks. Coming from you,
that's a huge compliment.

318
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:21,196
You still hold the college record
for most penis in a single season.

319
00:21:21,674 --> 00:21:23,335
So you have all my stats?

320
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:27,103
Yeah. l'm a huge fan.
l used to have that poster of you.

321
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:32,014
Did l say ''penis'' back there?

322
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:34,150
You did.

323
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:36,584
-Thought l'd let it go.
-Thank you.

324
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:41,850
Do you come to these gallery
things all the time or...?

325
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:45,654
Well, actually, l'm very close
to the artist, Amy Post.

326
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:46,991
Really? How close?

327
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,159
Close.

328
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:51,030
Right, right. So what are you
doing after the show?

329
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,667
l mean, did you come here
with anybody besides Amy?

330
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,337
Well, actually, l--

331
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:04,108
Will you excuse me
just for a moment?

332
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:06,350
Go ahead.
You got it going on.

333
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:10,715
You got it going on.

334
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,553
Excuse me.

335
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:17,452
l've been looking for you.
l'm Amy Post...

336
00:22:17,664 --> 00:22:19,222
...and l owe you one.

337
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,164
l'm....

338
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:22,265
l'm....

339
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:24,527
Oh, boy. Oscar Novak.

340
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:27,365
lt's nice to meet you.
Thank you for saving that piece.

341
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:30,441
lt was an honor.
Listen, your work is amazing.

342
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:32,770
-l mean, it's really incredible.
-Really?

343
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,746
Don't get me wrong, though.
l could do it better.

344
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:40,576
l don't blow glass but
if l did, l think l could do it...

345
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,447
...a little bit better than you.

346
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:48,485
There's a party for the artists
at a bar across town.

347
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:51,220
l want to pay you back
for saving my ass.

348
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:54,127
-l don't think so.
-l'll see you guys over there.

349
00:22:56,936 --> 00:22:59,461
Wait. You said
your name was Oscar Novak.

350
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:02,340
Of Steinberg and Novak?

351
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:05,501
Oh, my God. That is so wild.

352
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,006
l know Charles Newman.

353
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,077
You do?

354
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:12,412
Congratulations. The Telford's
one of my favorite buildings.

355
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:13,881
Thanks. Me too.

356
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:16,180
l know every curve of it.

357
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:18,448
lt's kind of like a person to me.

358
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:22,619
That's scaring you.

359
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,428
No, that's how l feel about my stuff.

360
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:30,091
l get very caught up in my pieces.
They're like my kids.

361
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:32,936
l even talk to them.

362
00:23:33,806 --> 00:23:35,137
Really?

363
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:38,241
So see, l'm even scarier than you.

364
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:40,378
We're a couple of kooks, you and me.

365
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:55,487
He's dealing with that rather well.

366
00:23:55,895 --> 00:23:57,021
Maybe we should walk.

367
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,061
lt'll be fine.
l'll check the engine.

368
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:00,926
l'll check the--

369
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,308
Probably just a hose.

370
00:24:18,952 --> 00:24:20,351
Or not.

371
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:31,091
Go, go.

372
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:33,925
All right. Come on, let's go.
Go, just go.

373
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:42,734
l have a question.

374
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:46,444
-What the hell are you doing?
-Three sounds at once.

375
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:48,775
All right, that's horrifying.

376
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:50,505
Please do it again.

377
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:53,979
That's not three sounds at once.

378
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:55,950
No, it is. lt goes....

379
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:57,622
And the humming.

380
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,784
Shit!

381
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:04,691
Here, let me. l got it.

382
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,058
God, you've hurt yourself.

383
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:11,498
No, you hurt me.

384
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:14,873
Yeah, see, you hit me in the face.

385
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:16,598
l'm sorry.

386
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,543
Wait!

387
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:28,448
So what's good here?

388
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:29,986
Tuna melt.

389
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:31,588
What else is good?

390
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:32,756
Tuna melt.

391
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:34,723
What do you think?

392
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,658
Two tuna melts.

393
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:44,427
You seeing anyone right now?

394
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:49,634
Me? No. l have trouble finding
people that are compatible.

395
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,003
They always want to sleep
on my side of the bed.

396
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,473
-What side?
-Left side.

397
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,670
Get out! l like the left side.

398
00:25:56,582 --> 00:25:57,480
See?

399
00:25:58,985 --> 00:25:59,952
Are you lonely?

400
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:02,610
No.

401
00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:06,285
You're okay company as long as
you're not beating me up.

402
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:09,086
You cover.
Don't like to reveal too much.

403
00:26:09,295 --> 00:26:10,125
l resent that.

404
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:12,991
And l'd respond to it
if it weren't so revealing.

405
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:15,827
Then you change the subject
with a joke. Got it.

406
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:18,367
l will let you know when l'm joking.

407
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,750
This is not food.

408
00:26:35,588 --> 00:26:37,215
l think it looks good.

409
00:26:43,396 --> 00:26:44,385
Try it.

410
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,739
-Are you okay?
-Mouth-...

411
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:57,107
...watering.

412
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,939
God. You know what? l knew
that tuna melt tasted funny.

413
00:27:01,147 --> 00:27:04,639
l'm lucky. l can eat anything.
My mother was a horrible cook.

414
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:06,842
She'd make this chicken
that smelled like...

415
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:09,578
...an old shoe, a wet dog,
blue cheese and....

416
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:11,154
l'm sorry.

417
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:16,326
-Will you excuse me for a second?
-Sure.

418
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,391
Boy, l feel good.

419
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:27,330
Oh, God. Don't worry.
You'll feel better in a second.

420
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,413
lt just doesn't get better than this.

421
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:45,379
-You still want to go to that party?
-Yeah. Absolutely.

422
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:51,392
Are we sure this is safe?

423
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:53,690
lt's safe. Allow me.

424
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:03,168
Maybe we should skip the party?

425
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:14,242
l'm sorry about before.
How are your balls?

426
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:17,183
They're fine.
Thank you for asking that.

427
00:28:17,723 --> 00:28:21,887
l had a great time. One catastrophe
after another. l loved it.

428
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:23,152
Me too.

429
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:25,926
This is me.

430
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:36,074
Would you like to come
to my shop, see me work?

431
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:37,606
Yeah. That'd be great.

432
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,607
How about tomorrow?
l can always use a little help.

433
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,643
l'm sorry. You're probably busy.
That's okay.

434
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,513
-l'd love to--
-Say no more.

435
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,318
l understand.

436
00:29:14,547 --> 00:29:15,479
What happened?

437
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,108
What happened to your head?

438
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:20,979
l've been here nine hours.
l got bored.

439
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,551
You're a strange man.

440
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:24,848
Now will you get out of my apartment?

441
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:27,226
-What happened?
-Nothing happened.

442
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:29,488
Oskie, it's 6 in the morning.

443
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:33,995
lt was awful. As soon as we left
the gallery, our cab caught on fire.

444
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,224
Then she elbowed me in the face.

445
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:40,337
Then we both threw up...

446
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:43,201
...then she slammed
a car handle into my balls.

447
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:45,809
The entire night
was a total disaster.

448
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:49,237
-You're in love with her.
-Pretty much.

449
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,743
l'll have to default
on my mortgage...

450
00:29:55,955 --> 00:29:58,788
...and live in a box and walk
on the street with a bowl...

451
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:01,858
...begging for crusts of bread
because of you, you bastard!

452
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,756
-Nothing happened.
-Something always happens.

453
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:07,760
When it's you and romance,
something always happens.

454
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:09,958
You know what?
l resent that, okay?

455
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:12,933
l've had plenty of relationships
that were successful.

456
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:15,266
Before they went absolutely nowhere.

457
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:20,209
l'm sorry. Oscar, listen.

458
00:30:20,713 --> 00:30:23,238
l didn't mean that.
l really didn't mean that.

459
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,383
You gotta see this woman, though.

460
00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:27,049
She's beautiful.

461
00:30:28,154 --> 00:30:29,587
And funny...

462
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:31,254
...and smart.

463
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:36,953
And she has an ass that is so sexy
that l struggle to even understand it.

464
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:40,527
You gonna crochet that
and send it to her mom?

465
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:46,901
You're starting to sound like
you have a very low opinion of me.

466
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,539
You know that's not true.

467
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:51,674
But this project represents
a major opportunity for us.

468
00:30:51,877 --> 00:30:53,811
All of our dreams could come true.

469
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,140
l'm sure Amy is lovely
and complicated.

470
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:58,249
But there are a million
girls out there...

471
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:02,750
...and just one project like this,
so l'm begging you, please, please...

472
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:04,953
...stay away from Amy...

473
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:07,616
...and her bewildering ass.

474
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:16,263
Okay, l'll stay away.

475
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:19,429
Sorry.

476
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,736
Move it.

477
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,886
How much are we paying them?

478
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:44,654
They're interns. They're free.

479
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:47,025
Yeah, well, we're getting ripped off.

480
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:52,369
How are you?

481
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:54,436
Hi, Charles.

482
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,971
Hold on for just one second.

483
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:58,174
lt's Charles!

484
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:01,504
How'd it go?

485
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,044
lt went great.

486
00:32:03,482 --> 00:32:05,814
You don't have anything
to worry about there.

487
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:08,179
Cartwright....
lt was great.

488
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:09,354
Excellent.

489
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:13,116
Thank you very much, Oscar.
l know this whole thing may seem...

490
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:16,620
...extreme to you.
And l'm not proud of myself...

491
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:19,457
...asking you to look out
for her, but knowing...

492
00:32:19,665 --> 00:32:22,532
...that we're both keeping
an eye out, l'm just so....

493
00:32:23,302 --> 00:32:25,202
I'm so comforted.

494
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:28,373
l'd like you to spend as much
time with her as possible.

495
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:29,541
What do you say?

496
00:32:30,476 --> 00:32:32,376
As much time with Amy as possible?

497
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:34,068
Say no. Say no.

498
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:36,637
I....

499
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,442
You know, as much as
l'd love to, sir, l--

500
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:45,022
I hope you know I'd never ask you
to do something which you find...

501
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:48,517
...inconsistent with your values.

502
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:50,251
But if you don't want to help...

503
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:53,193
...that's okay.
l understand completely.

504
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:57,097
Say yes! Say yes!

505
00:32:58,838 --> 00:32:59,702
Yes.

506
00:33:02,074 --> 00:33:04,907
-Thank you, Oscar.
-No problem, sir. Tha--

507
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:11,448
Well, l guess
l have to keep seeing her.

508
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,242
Of course you do, you moron.

509
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,115
Oskie, l'm a professional.
l went to graduate school.

510
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:21,286
l did 72 all-nighters
my senior year.

511
00:33:21,794 --> 00:33:23,352
l did a semester in Egypt.

512
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:27,692
Do you have any idea what
toilet paper feels like in Egypt?!

513
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,892
l delivered cinnamon rolls on a truck
with bad suspension for three years!

514
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:34,698
Do you know what
that does to your kidneys?

515
00:33:34,907 --> 00:33:37,398
My poor kidneys!
My freaking kidneys!

516
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,208
My poor freaking kidneys!

517
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:46,748
My freaking, scarred,
bruised kidneys!

518
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:00,826
That is very sweet of you.

519
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:03,099
But l can't accept it.

520
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:05,497
Come on, l can't even
give you a little gift?

521
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:07,137
We've been over this.

522
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:10,331
l don't need presents.
l have too much stuff as it is.

523
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:14,376
You win.

524
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:17,014
You always win.

525
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:21,743
So? l'm waiting for my
cross-examination about last night.

526
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,755
Cross-examine? Me?
l would never do that.

527
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,320
You're cool with me
going out on my own?

528
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:31,690
Honestly, no.
But l'm working on it.

529
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:35,025
Great. l'm very proud of you.

530
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:37,935
l met someone
interesting last night.

531
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,469
Yeah, actually you know him.
Oscar Novak.

532
00:34:40,673 --> 00:34:41,503
You're kidding.

533
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:43,307
You met Oscar?

534
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:45,304
That is a coincidence.

535
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,510
He's a really good guy.

536
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:52,445
Very. He and his partner both
have a great aesthetic sense.

537
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:55,142
-l guess most of them do.
-Most?

538
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:56,184
Gay men.

539
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,821
You did know he was gay.

540
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,456
Sure, yeah.

541
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:08,462
Not that l care.
Doesn't bother me.

542
00:35:09,134 --> 00:35:11,068
Right. Who cares?

543
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:30,217
The other night l almost started
having a crush on you.

544
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:32,550
lsn't that funny?

545
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:36,591
Something about
late nights and thunderstorms.

546
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:39,230
l hope that's okay with you.

547
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:40,489
Yeah.

548
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:50,372
lf you and l are gonna
keep hanging out...

549
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:52,407
...there's something
l have to tell you.

550
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:55,612
Come over here.

551
00:35:58,317 --> 00:36:00,581
Remember when you mentioned
Charles Newman...

552
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:02,811
...and l said that l knew him?

553
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:04,619
Blow.

554
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:05,720
Excuse me?

555
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:08,084
-Help me blow.
-Excuse me?

556
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:10,657
lKeep your mouth on the opening.

557
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,460
Well...

558
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:14,724
...the truth is, actually, that...

559
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:17,129
...Charles and l are involved.

560
00:36:17,336 --> 00:36:18,462
We're having an affair.

561
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:23,237
lsn't that weird? You're at my show,
we get to know each other.

562
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:26,137
-And l'm involved with your boss.
-That's so weird!

563
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:27,676
l know.

564
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:31,476
By the way, how did you
find out about my show?

565
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:34,343
l read it in the newspaper.

566
00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:37,351
And l thought to myself,
''Glass blowing sounds cool.''

567
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:39,717
And l didn't have
anything better to do.

568
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:43,083
Man, you are a bad liar.
l mean, you cannot lie.

569
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:54,903
l'm a little slow,
but l figured it out.

570
00:36:56,141 --> 00:36:57,938
You were spying on me.

571
00:36:59,278 --> 00:37:03,271
l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.
l really should have told you.

572
00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:07,651
You have to understand.
Our entire careers are in his hands.

573
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:11,015
And then...

574
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,584
...l met you.

575
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,118
And...

576
00:37:14,426 --> 00:37:17,122
...you made three sounds at once.

577
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:23,760
And l just really
wanted to get to know you.

578
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:31,304
Just don't ever lie to me again.

579
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,782
lt's great being friends
with a mistress.

580
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,510
l'm free most evenings.

581
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:44,254
What do you say?

582
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,483
Tonight?

583
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:51,593
Come over, or l'll tell Charles
you went crazy and made a pass at me.

584
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:54,231
l could really get you
in trouble, Oscar.

585
00:37:56,435 --> 00:37:59,529
-l've gotta take a shower.
-Yeah, l was gonna say....

586
00:38:02,274 --> 00:38:05,038
l get this feeling around you.
l don't know why.

587
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:08,102
Like we've known each other
a really long time...

588
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:09,405
...or in a...

589
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:11,481
...another life or something.

590
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:13,207
-You know what l mean?
-Yeah.

591
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:15,883
No.

592
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:19,751
-What's the question?
-Are you always nervous?

593
00:38:24,062 --> 00:38:25,723
-Let's celebrate.
-Great.

594
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:28,828
lt's not every day
l get to hang out with a spy.

595
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:35,871
There's a CD in there.
Hit play.

596
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:42,043
l'll see you in a minute.

597
00:38:42,714 --> 00:38:44,375
-Go ahead.
-Right.

598
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:59,020
l'm Batman.

599
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,311
Check it and see

600
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:24,247
Got a fever of 103

601
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,285
Come on, baby
Do you do more than dance?

602
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:32,020
Hot-blooded, I'm hot-blooded

603
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:35,527
Know what I have in mind

604
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,735
And you ought to know
I'm hot--

605
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:40,165
Oh, shit!

606
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:50,772
Okay, l'm ready.

607
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:53,845
-Where's my champagne?
-Right here.

608
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:57,985
A toast to....

609
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,189
What should we toast to?

610
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:19,309
What, you don't call anymore?
You just show up?

611
00:40:23,448 --> 00:40:26,849
Champagne, music, Amy in a kimono.

612
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:30,316
l swear, if you weren't gay...

613
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,817
...l'd have to kill you.

614
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:36,185
Gay?

615
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:39,856
l'm not gay. l didn't--
Gay?

616
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:42,827
Oscar, come on. We don't care.

617
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,035
Absolutely not.

618
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:48,400
What people do in their own bedrooms
is no concern to us, right?

619
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:51,975
How are you?

620
00:40:52,177 --> 00:40:55,237
-l just love Japanese kimonos.
-l know.

621
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,463
Thank God you're here.
l need to--

622
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:17,932
You guys throw
a lot of dinner parties.

623
00:41:18,136 --> 00:41:20,331
-l'm gay. lt's what we do.
-Really?

624
00:41:20,706 --> 00:41:22,936
That, and shop for small dogs.
Can l help you?

625
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:27,100
l need to talk with you privately.
l need to talk with him privately.

626
00:41:28,847 --> 00:41:30,940
We're going to talk privately.

627
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,181
Anyone want cappuccinos?

628
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:38,420
They think l'm gay.

629
00:41:39,257 --> 00:41:40,087
What?

630
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:41,953
They think l'm gay.

631
00:41:43,662 --> 00:41:45,755
-Come again?
-Everybody thinks...

632
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,090
...l'm gay!

633
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:49,525
l win the pool.

634
00:41:53,205 --> 00:41:54,035
Come again?

635
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:56,400
Amy and Charles...

636
00:41:56,742 --> 00:41:58,232
...think l'm gay.

637
00:41:58,443 --> 00:41:59,967
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes!

638
00:42:00,178 --> 00:42:02,237
You're gay. l'm gay.

639
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,573
We're gay.

640
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:07,081
Good God!

641
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:11,318
l know. l mean, how could
they think that? Me, gay?

642
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:15,458
lt's just so embarrassing
and mortifying and....

643
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,490
Humiliating.

644
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:20,062
Humiliating, yes! l mean,
l don't get it. l don't see it.

645
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:22,563
l'm just a regular, normal...

646
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:25,763
...insensitive asshole.

647
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:29,630
But come on.
You know what l mean, right?

648
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:31,172
Oh, sure.

649
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,000
When you say you're humiliated...

650
00:42:33,211 --> 00:42:35,805
...you actually mean
you're proud and unashamed.

651
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:37,948
No. lt's not that.
lt's just--

652
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:39,275
Being gay's not normal.

653
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:42,419
l don't think that. l have
no problem with people being gay.

654
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:44,418
l'm all for homosexuality...

655
00:42:44,623 --> 00:42:47,114
...especially when it's
between gorgeous women.

656
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:49,190
But l'm not gay!

657
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,660
l'm sorry.

658
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:55,856
l didn't mean what l said before.
What are you doing?

659
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:57,933
l'm trying to decide...

660
00:42:58,136 --> 00:43:01,469
...if l should recover gracefully
from your insults...

661
00:43:01,673 --> 00:43:02,867
...or kneecap you.

662
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:05,942
Yes, l'm insensitive and callous.

663
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:07,702
Well, you're stupid and young.

664
00:43:08,947 --> 00:43:10,141
Yes, stupid and young.

665
00:43:10,348 --> 00:43:14,011
But that doesn't change the fact
that we're in deep shit, okay?

666
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,481
So what do we do?

667
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,314
''We?'' l don't see there's
anything for me to do.

668
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:20,354
-We have to do something.
-Why?

669
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,895
-Because everybody thinks l'm gay!
-l don't.

670
00:43:25,097 --> 00:43:27,361
You don't? Who cares?

671
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:30,896
You're enjoying this!

672
00:43:31,103 --> 00:43:35,301
l told you when you wanted to spy
on her, something bad might happen.

673
00:43:35,507 --> 00:43:38,305
You didn't listen.
So the reality is--

674
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,705
The reality is you made
your big gay bed...

675
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:43,380
...and you must now
slumber gaily in it.

676
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:45,344
But l don't wanna.

677
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:49,910
Sweet dreams. Hey, l'll see you
at the next dinner party.

678
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:54,156
Poor guy. lt's so hard
when you first come out.

679
00:44:31,263 --> 00:44:33,128
Want a beer?
l'm gonna grab a beer.

680
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,927
There he is. There's the guy!

681
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:39,626
Go, buddy. You gotta run
with that! Come on!

682
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:42,068
Come on, Ponderosa!
You've gotta run!

683
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:49,870
So how'd the spy operation go?

684
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:52,875
lt's just a little complicated.

685
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:54,244
-He did her.
-Score.

686
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:59,322
You got lucky? ls she stacked?

687
00:44:59,524 --> 00:45:02,960
She's really stacked, isn't she?
Oh, my God. She tie you up?

688
00:45:03,962 --> 00:45:05,896
She's a dominatrix, isn't she?

689
00:45:07,132 --> 00:45:08,599
You little piggy.

690
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:12,000
You got it on with a big-breasted
dominatrix, didn't you?

691
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,828
You tell me.

692
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:17,965
Am l the only one who's listening?

693
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:22,875
Nothing happened with Amy.
And, anyway...

694
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:25,274
...l've been meaning
to tell you guys...

695
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:28,145
...that you won't see me
with any women for a while.

696
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:32,653
l just kind of decided to, you know,
swear off girls for a while.

697
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:35,792
l don't know how--
Just a little bit of time.

698
00:45:41,266 --> 00:45:42,324
Can l move in?

699
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:45,094
l put my stuff in storage.
This is what l need.

700
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,630
l need my clothes,
my sketchbooks, my tools--

701
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,199
So you're Amy.

702
00:45:50,408 --> 00:45:51,705
Nice to meet you.

703
00:45:53,912 --> 00:45:55,812
Oscar told us about the other night.

704
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:58,777
That is so embarrassing
after what l did to him.

705
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:01,509
Are your balls okay
or are they still sore?

706
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:04,783
-Time to go.
-We should get going.

707
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,158
l'm out.

708
00:46:09,928 --> 00:46:11,156
Tools.

709
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:14,896
l'm impressed.

710
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:19,496
Are they all gay?

711
00:46:23,642 --> 00:46:24,631
Yes.

712
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,443
Damn! The little one
was kind of cute.

713
00:46:28,647 --> 00:46:31,138
Well, he's not exactly my type.
Let me ask you--

714
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:33,840
How's lKevin doing tonight?
He score yet?

715
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:34,984
He's kicking ass.

716
00:46:35,186 --> 00:46:36,175
You like him?

717
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,184
Are you kidding?
l worship the guy.

718
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:42,250
So are you okay?

719
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,224
This place is awesome.
Drafty, but awesome.

720
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:48,659
Tuna fish. Very brave.

721
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:49,925
l brought that for you.

722
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:51,329
Oh, thanks.

723
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:57,703
l brought that for you too.
lt'll fit you perfectly.

724
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:04,078
-ls this you?
-Don't.

725
00:47:04,816 --> 00:47:06,579
Were you in a band?

726
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,275
My friends in high school.

727
00:47:08,486 --> 00:47:10,716
Are you aware of how
you look in this picture?

728
00:47:10,922 --> 00:47:14,585
lt's not my fault. lt was the '80s.
You didn't look like a dork then?

729
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:18,251
-l got through the '80s dork-free.
-And you're making up for it now.

730
00:47:27,372 --> 00:47:28,964
l appreciate this, Oscar.

731
00:47:29,174 --> 00:47:31,904
Especially since we haven't
known each other that long.

732
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,136
l've been dodging my landlord,
and he finally nabbed me...

733
00:47:35,347 --> 00:47:37,212
...and l didn't know what to do.

734
00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:41,441
l have a lot of friends.
l just don't have a lot of friends.

735
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,844
You know?

736
00:47:44,756 --> 00:47:47,623
To tell the truth, l didn't
have anywhere else to go.

737
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,728
You came to the right place.

738
00:47:59,404 --> 00:48:01,838
Fantastic place.

739
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,599
Grimy, raw.

740
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,271
-l like it.
-Hi, Charles.

741
00:48:07,645 --> 00:48:10,136
l hope you don't mind me
stopping by like this.

742
00:48:10,648 --> 00:48:14,175
-Amy told me she'd be here.
-No, no. Consider this....

743
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:18,518
Let's go. l got you a room
at the Four Seasons and--

744
00:48:18,723 --> 00:48:22,819
No, that's okay. Oscar has
kindly agreed to take me in.

745
00:48:24,095 --> 00:48:26,427
Amy can stay here with me.
lt's okay.

746
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,856
Like l said, a saint.

747
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:31,968
Okay. You win.

748
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:34,329
You always win.

749
00:48:40,178 --> 00:48:41,008
How's the project?

750
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:42,270
Great.

751
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:52,685
Yeah, l'm going to head home now.

752
00:48:53,124 --> 00:48:55,718
l mean, l'm going
to head up there to....

753
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:58,624
-l'm going to bed.
-Are you sure?

754
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,355
l'll be asleep as soon
as my head hits the pillow.

755
00:49:05,804 --> 00:49:09,604
This place is such a dump.
l feel like l might catch something.

756
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:10,832
Shut up, Chuck.

757
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:24,583
Come here, you.

758
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:27,589
Oh, shit.

759
00:49:27,992 --> 00:49:30,051
Shit, shit, shit.

760
00:49:48,713 --> 00:49:51,238
All right, it's 7:07, Chicago.
Wake up!

761
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:54,748
Yeah, you dimwit, you idiot,
you moron, you a-hole.

762
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:56,887
Go to your crappyjob now.

763
00:49:57,088 --> 00:50:00,216
Go put on your crusty underwear
and blue-collar shirt--

764
00:50:27,151 --> 00:50:29,119
Does he know that he's upside-down?

765
00:50:30,722 --> 00:50:31,689
Yoga.

766
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:37,887
The new tycoon spent the night on
your couch. l hope you don't mind.

767
00:50:44,736 --> 00:50:46,169
You want some coffee?

768
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:54,504
l'll just get you
a nice cup of decaf.

769
00:50:57,515 --> 00:51:00,279
-Have you boys finished your homework?
-Cute.

770
00:51:00,485 --> 00:51:02,316
Don't fight with the kids on the bus.

771
00:51:08,493 --> 00:51:11,223
-What are you doing tonight?
-Going out with friends.

772
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:13,897
Great. Sounds like fun.

773
00:51:19,103 --> 00:51:21,663
-What are you doing tonight?
-Going out with her friends.

774
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:24,239
Great. Sounds like fun.

775
00:51:34,852 --> 00:51:36,786
What about working for Mr. Newman?

776
00:51:37,021 --> 00:51:39,148
ls he everything he's reputed to be?

777
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:41,882
-Everything and more.
-More.

778
00:51:42,093 --> 00:51:44,118
And you're an openly gay firm?

779
00:51:44,562 --> 00:51:47,360
Will this have any impact
on the competition?

780
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:51,201
We just try and do our jobs.

781
00:51:53,204 --> 00:51:56,662
lt's not important what other
people think of us personally.

782
00:51:56,874 --> 00:52:00,674
Don't you feel you have a certain
responsibility as a gay professional?

783
00:52:00,878 --> 00:52:05,315
lf we're talented, we shouldn't have
to pretend to be something we're not.

784
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:08,445
People have to understand
that we are individuals.

785
00:52:08,653 --> 00:52:10,746
Who cares if we're gay or straight?

786
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:13,185
Why can't people
accept us for who we are?

787
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,927
You do know you're not gay, right?

788
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:26,026
You know what?
You've been working too hard.

789
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:28,364
You need to relax.

790
00:52:31,242 --> 00:52:33,142
l have a surprise for you.

791
00:52:33,845 --> 00:52:34,812
For me?

792
00:52:35,747 --> 00:52:37,305
And there he is.

793
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,542
-That's lKevin Cartwright.
-You two have met before, right?

794
00:52:44,155 --> 00:52:47,591
Remember the Miami game, '93?
1 80 yards. Unbelievable.

795
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:51,091
Actually, it was like 1 50.
But who cares about a couple yards?

796
00:52:51,295 --> 00:52:52,353
You're the man!

797
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:54,864
That's lKevin Cartwright, right here!

798
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:57,294
You broke your hand, right?

799
00:52:57,535 --> 00:52:59,196
No, l sprained my hand.
What's up?

800
00:52:59,437 --> 00:53:03,134
Then you gained another 50 yards.
That's 230 yards in a game, my man!

801
00:53:03,341 --> 00:53:06,708
-l don't know about that.
-Baseball player stubs his toe...

802
00:53:06,944 --> 00:53:09,378
...he's on the disabled list
for nine years.

803
00:53:09,614 --> 00:53:11,377
l don't even know any
baseball players.

804
00:53:13,351 --> 00:53:16,878
l'd love to stay and talk,
but l'm bored out of my mind.

805
00:53:17,321 --> 00:53:18,913
Behave yourselves.

806
00:53:19,123 --> 00:53:21,785
l love that girl.
That's a good girl.

807
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:24,484
You're not gonna yell
my name no more, are you?

808
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:26,493
-No. l'm finished.
-Cool.

809
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:28,255
-Want to get another round?
-Absolutely.

810
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:30,559
That's lKevin Cartwright right here.

811
00:53:31,502 --> 00:53:34,528
-Seven seconds left.
-Twenty yards for a score.

812
00:53:35,807 --> 00:53:37,274
Set! Hut! Hut!

813
00:53:37,909 --> 00:53:39,672
And he's got some running room!

814
00:53:57,095 --> 00:53:59,063
l gotta tell you something.

815
00:54:00,965 --> 00:54:02,660
l'm very attracted to you.

816
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:05,660
And that's a football term for...?

817
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:08,737
l'm very attracted to you.

818
00:54:15,146 --> 00:54:16,374
Evidently.

819
00:54:18,983 --> 00:54:20,883
You know what? l can't breathe.

820
00:54:21,853 --> 00:54:23,252
There we go.

821
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:26,519
See, l told Amy how l felt
when we first met.

822
00:54:26,724 --> 00:54:28,715
That's why she set
this whole thing up.

823
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,288
How very nice of her.

824
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,625
Look, l'm a little new at this.

825
00:54:35,133 --> 00:54:37,761
l only realized l was gay
a couple years ago...

826
00:54:37,969 --> 00:54:39,994
...after Amy and l broke up.

827
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,331
lf you can't fall in love with her,
you must be gay, right?

828
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:49,613
l live a couple blocks from here.

829
00:54:49,814 --> 00:54:52,078
You want to come by
for another drink?

830
00:54:52,283 --> 00:54:54,148
That's very flattering.

831
00:54:58,856 --> 00:55:00,153
But you know what?

832
00:55:00,491 --> 00:55:03,051
The truth is, l'm in love
with somebody else.

833
00:55:05,797 --> 00:55:07,890
l mean, l think
you're really great...

834
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,826
...but l'm kind of head over heels,
you know? l'm sorry.

835
00:55:14,038 --> 00:55:15,096
lf Amy had told me--

836
00:55:15,306 --> 00:55:19,367
Actually, this person is completely
involved with somebody else...

837
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:21,841
...so there's no hope.

838
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,651
But l just can't help the way
that l feel, you know?

839
00:55:30,221 --> 00:55:31,415
Poor guy.

840
00:55:33,724 --> 00:55:35,157
That's awful.

841
00:55:40,198 --> 00:55:41,358
Thanks.

842
00:56:01,118 --> 00:56:02,517
l did not...

843
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:04,652
...ask you...

844
00:56:05,122 --> 00:56:06,419
...to do that.

845
00:56:06,624 --> 00:56:08,455
You don't have to yell
through the door.

846
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,425
Are you decent?

847
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:16,827
l meant well.
l knew you were lonely.

848
00:56:17,068 --> 00:56:18,729
Yeah, okay. Just...

849
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:21,137
...don't ever do that again.

850
00:56:22,406 --> 00:56:23,464
l'm sorry.

851
00:56:26,911 --> 00:56:30,438
Can you not tell anyone about lKevin?
He's still figuring things out.

852
00:56:30,648 --> 00:56:33,947
Believe me, mum is the word.
The word is mum.

853
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:35,777
Come in.

854
00:56:38,155 --> 00:56:39,679
So he's not your type?

855
00:56:42,593 --> 00:56:44,288
Well, he is....

856
00:56:45,596 --> 00:56:46,722
No.

857
00:56:47,498 --> 00:56:50,365
No, l prefer to date people
who are a little...

858
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:52,035
...a little more....

859
00:56:52,937 --> 00:56:54,632
-l don't know.
-Not so big and tall.

860
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:56,567
Exactly.

861
00:56:57,141 --> 00:56:58,768
What are your thoughts on penis size?

862
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:07,050
Do you know, l haven't exactly
organized my thoughts on that yet.

863
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:11,187
Between you and me, when l was
dating lKevin, we had a real problem.

864
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:12,720
He has this giant thing!

865
00:57:12,957 --> 00:57:14,049
No kidding.

866
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:18,117
l was surprised when lKevin told me
he was gay. You can't always tell.

867
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:19,990
Can you pass me the razor?

868
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:24,699
l'm gonna go.

869
00:57:24,902 --> 00:57:27,234
Actually, l had
a lesbian experience once.

870
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:28,335
Really?

871
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:30,806
You did?

872
00:57:31,442 --> 00:57:33,808
Yeah, it was in college.

873
00:57:34,011 --> 00:57:37,947
There was this Brazilian girl
in my intro philosophy class.

874
00:57:38,382 --> 00:57:41,647
One night we were studying
and sitting on her bed...

875
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:43,777
...and her hair brushed my hand...

876
00:57:43,988 --> 00:57:47,253
...and all of a sudden
l noticed how amazing she looked.

877
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:51,895
Olive skin and these incredible
bee-stung lips and these beautiful....

878
00:57:52,463 --> 00:57:55,626
You know how it is in college.
We experimented.

879
00:57:57,134 --> 00:57:58,897
Yeah, you had a....

880
00:57:59,437 --> 00:58:01,098
Well, good for you, l say.

881
00:58:01,505 --> 00:58:03,063
l'm saying good for you.

882
00:58:03,474 --> 00:58:05,874
l could never tell
a straight guy that.

883
00:58:06,077 --> 00:58:08,637
He'd ask creepy questions,
try to weasel out details.

884
00:58:08,913 --> 00:58:12,144
That's weird.
That is sick and weird.

885
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,841
Men have these stupid
Spice Channel fantasies...

886
00:58:15,086 --> 00:58:16,553
...about two women together...

887
00:58:16,754 --> 00:58:19,848
...in garter belts, push-up bras
and high heels.

888
00:58:20,758 --> 00:58:24,091
-That's just not how it happens.
-Well, of course not.

889
00:58:25,096 --> 00:58:26,791
What happens is...?

890
00:58:27,031 --> 00:58:28,293
lt was just different.

891
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:31,190
She was passionate and sensitive.

892
00:58:34,405 --> 00:58:36,896
Listen to me.
This must be so boring for you.

893
00:58:38,909 --> 00:58:41,377
No, l mean, it's not that boring.

894
00:58:42,013 --> 00:58:44,777
We did one thing that was
like those male fantasies.

895
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:46,441
You did?

896
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,140
Yeah, it was really....

897
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:49,717
Oh, l can't even say it.

898
00:58:49,954 --> 00:58:52,582
Sure you can.
We're a couple of girlfriends here.

899
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,260
Come here.
l'll whisper it in your ear.

900
00:59:09,373 --> 00:59:11,500
-Hand me my towel, would you?
-Sure.

901
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:16,376
Turn around.

902
00:59:32,163 --> 00:59:33,960
Man, it's hot in here.

903
00:59:36,434 --> 00:59:38,561
Chicago, I gotta get
something off my chest.

904
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:40,896
I don't care about
your sexual orientation...

905
00:59:41,105 --> 00:59:43,665
...or if you're in the closet,
out of the closet...

906
00:59:43,874 --> 00:59:45,967
...down a mineshaft,
on a broomstick.

907
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:48,543
Just, please do yourjob.

908
00:59:48,746 --> 00:59:51,806
Who's this bastard on the
front of the business section?

909
00:59:52,016 --> 00:59:54,246
Did you see him? Oscar Novak.

910
00:59:54,452 --> 00:59:57,182
He is a complaining,
complaining moron.

911
00:59:57,388 --> 00:59:59,686
Even if I was a mincing,
limp-wristed gay...

912
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,290
...I wouldn't tell
the whole city about it.

913
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,486
What are you--

914
01:00:04,695 --> 01:00:05,525
Oh, my God!

915
01:00:05,729 --> 01:00:07,959
Talk about great publicity!

916
01:00:08,766 --> 01:00:10,666
Good hair too.

917
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:15,465
Push up. Push up. Push up.

918
01:00:16,307 --> 01:00:17,604
Good. Good.

919
01:00:28,552 --> 01:00:30,611
He was definitely straight
before, right?

920
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:33,449
He and Peter do spend
a lot of time together.

921
01:00:33,924 --> 01:00:35,289
Mr. Newman.

922
01:00:39,964 --> 01:00:42,262
Do we have any newcomers?

923
01:00:44,168 --> 01:00:45,362
l'm Zack.

924
01:00:46,203 --> 01:00:47,067
And l'm....

925
01:00:48,372 --> 01:00:49,862
Gay?!

926
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:52,433
No, l'm not--

927
01:01:10,895 --> 01:01:11,793
What?

928
01:02:02,813 --> 01:02:05,509
Thought we kind of
had a moment there.

929
01:02:08,152 --> 01:02:10,313
Us? No, we didn't have a moment.

930
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:12,819
No, l was there. No moment.

931
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:15,653
You work out, don't you?

932
01:02:17,428 --> 01:02:20,056
You look even better in person
than in the paper.

933
01:02:20,264 --> 01:02:22,960
-You're in great shape.
-Well, thanks. Thanks.

934
01:02:41,652 --> 01:02:43,586
Clarkson back to pass...

935
01:02:43,821 --> 01:02:45,516
...and he hits Willhide
up the middle.

936
01:02:45,723 --> 01:02:48,453
He breaks a tackle,
still on his feet at the 20....

937
01:02:55,466 --> 01:02:57,161
For the last time...

938
01:02:57,735 --> 01:02:58,997
...l'm not gay.

939
01:03:01,038 --> 01:03:02,232
We know.

940
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,435
But you don't believe me.

941
01:03:04,675 --> 01:03:06,666
No, we do. We do.

942
01:03:06,877 --> 01:03:09,311
This is ridiculous.
l've known you my entire life.

943
01:03:09,513 --> 01:03:11,845
What would make you think
that l'm gay now?

944
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,350
The wall treatments.

945
01:03:17,621 --> 01:03:18,645
The hors d'oeuvres.

946
01:03:18,856 --> 01:03:21,086
Yeah, and all the...

947
01:03:22,826 --> 01:03:23,758
...gay things.

948
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:25,360
What's wrong with wall treatments?

949
01:03:25,562 --> 01:03:27,223
Do you know how hard it is...

950
01:03:27,431 --> 01:03:30,332
...to decide between sponging,
glazing and spackling?

951
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:32,927
Never mind.

952
01:03:33,137 --> 01:03:34,536
No, it's okay.

953
01:03:35,105 --> 01:03:38,700
Some people might think
you're a freak, but not me.

954
01:03:39,777 --> 01:03:41,301
l knew you were gay all along.

955
01:03:42,012 --> 01:03:44,503
l'm just glad you figured
it out for yourself.

956
01:03:44,715 --> 01:03:47,616
Remember when we went skiing
and went into the hot tub...

957
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:50,616
...and you sort of
brushed up against me...

958
01:03:50,988 --> 01:03:53,013
...and you didn't say anything...

959
01:03:53,223 --> 01:03:55,054
...you just looked
at me kind of funny?

960
01:03:57,761 --> 01:04:00,252
-Were you hitting on me?
-Okay, you're right. l'm gay.

961
01:04:00,464 --> 01:04:01,624
l've always been gay.

962
01:04:01,832 --> 01:04:05,324
All these years of friendship,
football and me chasing after girls?

963
01:04:05,536 --> 01:04:09,131
A ruse. A clever little trick
just to get all of you into bed.

964
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:12,309
That's right.
l want all of you.

965
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,005
Zack, with your lilting laugh.

966
01:04:15,412 --> 01:04:16,743
Bill, your farts...

967
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:19,408
...they're like perfume to me.

968
01:04:19,616 --> 01:04:20,583
And Rick...

969
01:04:21,218 --> 01:04:23,083
...you really figured me out, man.

970
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:27,580
l want you most of all.

971
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:28,883
My God.

972
01:04:32,563 --> 01:04:35,726
Mom, you're not listening.
l'm not gay.

973
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:38,161
You don't have to lie, son.

974
01:04:38,402 --> 01:04:39,699
l'm not lying.

975
01:04:40,003 --> 01:04:43,336
Look, l just have to pretend
to be gay for work.

976
01:04:45,342 --> 01:04:46,741
l know it sounds crazy.

977
01:04:46,944 --> 01:04:49,913
No, you did a brave thing,
and l think it's wonderful.

978
01:04:50,147 --> 01:04:51,239
Dad must be going nuts.

979
01:04:51,448 --> 01:04:53,746
No, your father feels
exactly the same way.

980
01:04:55,219 --> 01:04:56,743
Put him on the phone.

981
01:04:58,122 --> 01:05:00,249
He can't come to the phone right now.

982
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:02,519
He's busy.

983
01:05:12,803 --> 01:05:14,964
l'm never gonna have sex again.

984
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:17,932
Come on, Oscar.
Of course you will.

985
01:05:18,342 --> 01:05:20,003
Just maybe not with a woman.

986
01:05:32,022 --> 01:05:33,353
Hi, honey.

987
01:05:37,594 --> 01:05:40,757
-Wanna hang out with us?
-You won't believe the day l've had.

988
01:05:40,964 --> 01:05:43,762
Listen, l made you something.

989
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:45,498
Open it up.

990
01:05:49,173 --> 01:05:50,572
Oh, God.

991
01:05:51,175 --> 01:05:52,642
l'm so proud of you.

992
01:05:53,444 --> 01:05:55,173
Oh, don't be.

993
01:05:55,913 --> 01:05:57,278
That was nothing.

994
01:05:57,481 --> 01:05:59,915
That's not true.
You're proud of who you are.

995
01:06:00,117 --> 01:06:01,846
Not everyone's like that.

996
01:06:02,419 --> 01:06:05,445
-Come hang out with us.
-No, l don't want to.

997
01:06:05,656 --> 01:06:06,748
We have margaritas.

998
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:12,761
Gross!

999
01:06:13,397 --> 01:06:15,558
The best is: ''l won't
use a line on you.''

1000
01:06:15,766 --> 01:06:17,233
The anti-line line.

1001
01:06:17,434 --> 01:06:19,527
-l hate that.
-That is a stupid one.

1002
01:06:19,736 --> 01:06:23,536
ls it the same for you? Do you get
the same kind of come-ons as us?

1003
01:06:25,809 --> 01:06:27,436
Well, sometimes.

1004
01:06:27,644 --> 01:06:29,009
Like the other day...

1005
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,845
...l was on a bus, and this guy
comes up to me and says:

1006
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,347
''Do you work out?''

1007
01:06:36,086 --> 01:06:39,544
The old workout line.
Does anyone fall for that?

1008
01:06:40,557 --> 01:06:41,854
Shut up!

1009
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,660
And then, you know, he's...

1010
01:06:45,863 --> 01:06:46,693
...staring...

1011
01:06:46,897 --> 01:06:49,457
...l mean, staring at my butt.

1012
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:50,690
So l turn around.

1013
01:06:50,901 --> 01:06:53,369
Then, of course, my crotch
is right in his face.

1014
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:54,594
Oh, please!

1015
01:06:54,805 --> 01:06:57,273
So l turn around again,
and then there's butt.

1016
01:06:57,474 --> 01:06:59,271
So it's like butt,
crotch, butt, crotch...

1017
01:06:59,476 --> 01:07:00,943
...butt, butt, butt!

1018
01:07:01,144 --> 01:07:01,974
Go, Oscar!

1019
01:07:02,179 --> 01:07:06,309
And l'm thinking, ''Hey, pal,
l'm a person. l'm not an object.''

1020
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:07,908
Absolutely.

1021
01:07:08,151 --> 01:07:10,881
l have feelings.
lt doesn't matter that he's right...

1022
01:07:11,088 --> 01:07:14,649
...that l have a finely toned,
picture-perfect, award-winning ass!

1023
01:07:16,093 --> 01:07:17,321
There's more to me than that.

1024
01:07:17,528 --> 01:07:19,655
That's right.
You're not a piece of meat.

1025
01:07:19,897 --> 01:07:21,626
Whatever happened to subtlety?

1026
01:07:21,832 --> 01:07:24,494
Whatever happened to getting
to know somebody first?

1027
01:07:27,104 --> 01:07:29,265
lf all men were gay,
it'd be perfect.

1028
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:52,018
I love you so much.
You've changed my whole life.

1029
01:07:52,262 --> 01:07:54,958
I want to make you happy.
That's all that matters.

1030
01:07:58,435 --> 01:08:00,995
I've got something to tell you too.

1031
01:08:02,673 --> 01:08:04,641
I'm going to get married.

1032
01:08:12,149 --> 01:08:14,344
There's this thing l've noticed.

1033
01:08:14,551 --> 01:08:18,681
ln the movies, when a guy asks
a girl out, she says, ''l'd like that.''

1034
01:08:18,889 --> 01:08:21,619
l've never heard anyone
say that in real life, ever.

1035
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:24,457
lKnow what the most
spoken line in movies is?

1036
01:08:24,661 --> 01:08:26,185
''Let's get out of here.''

1037
01:08:28,165 --> 01:08:31,100
That makes sense.
lt works for a lot of situations.

1038
01:08:31,301 --> 01:08:33,929
''They're shooting at us.
Let's get out of here.''

1039
01:08:34,137 --> 01:08:36,662
''Aliens have landed.
Let's get out of here.''

1040
01:08:36,873 --> 01:08:39,569
''l wanna make love to you.
Let's get out of here.''

1041
01:08:39,776 --> 01:08:42,336
Those are all good,
especially that last one.

1042
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:47,944
What was that?

1043
01:08:48,151 --> 01:08:49,675
l was yawning.

1044
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:56,056
You're tired.
l'm gonna let you sleep.

1045
01:08:56,793 --> 01:08:58,226
No, stay here.

1046
01:08:58,962 --> 01:09:00,224
You sure?

1047
01:09:03,634 --> 01:09:05,397
Just till the end of the movie.

1048
01:09:06,003 --> 01:09:07,527
Will you marry me?

1049
01:09:08,138 --> 01:09:09,332
Will you?

1050
01:09:10,574 --> 01:09:12,439
Do you think we'd be happy?

1051
01:09:13,443 --> 01:09:15,775
No, but what does it matter?

1052
01:10:15,806 --> 01:10:17,774
l have beautifully located
season tickets...

1053
01:10:17,974 --> 01:10:19,839
...and l'd love you to be my guest.

1054
01:10:20,043 --> 01:10:22,637
Very, very exciting.

1055
01:10:28,218 --> 01:10:29,583
-Great party.
-Thanks.

1056
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,283
Very excited to see your model.
Very excited.

1057
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:35,685
Well, we just hope that you like it.

1058
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:39,384
There really are some very
nice-looking women here tonight.

1059
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:42,760
What's your type?

1060
01:10:43,366 --> 01:10:44,196
Type of what?

1061
01:10:45,102 --> 01:10:48,902
lt's funny. When l met you guys,
l thought you were supergay...

1062
01:10:49,106 --> 01:10:50,300
...and Oscar was straight.

1063
01:10:50,507 --> 01:10:51,565
l was supergay?

1064
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:54,400
-He cleared it up for me.
-He did?

1065
01:10:54,611 --> 01:10:58,047
He told me that you're not,
but he is, 1 00%%%.

1066
01:10:58,782 --> 01:11:00,181
That Oskie!

1067
01:11:01,017 --> 01:11:05,044
That article in the paper must
make it hard for you to meet girls.

1068
01:11:05,255 --> 01:11:06,244
l do okay.

1069
01:11:06,456 --> 01:11:09,220
Thanks, Mom.
And thank you for coming.

1070
01:11:09,426 --> 01:11:12,293
Dad, the bar's right over there.

1071
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,535
l'm sorry.

1072
01:11:22,773 --> 01:11:26,004
-l am so excited for you.
-Thanks, thanks.

1073
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:28,740
l'm sorry l stole
the blankets last night.

1074
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:32,642
You stole the blankets, you hogged
the couch. lt wasn't pretty.

1075
01:11:32,849 --> 01:11:34,441
You got the left side.

1076
01:11:34,651 --> 01:11:39,111
Ladies and gentlemen, the Decker
and Strauss model is open for viewing.

1077
01:11:55,839 --> 01:12:00,538
Ladies and gentlemen, the Steinberg
and Novak model is open for viewing.

1078
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,110
lt's so beautiful.

1079
01:12:19,129 --> 01:12:20,027
Okay, guys...

1080
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,322
...that's enough.

1081
01:12:22,999 --> 01:12:24,626
Sorry to interrupt.

1082
01:12:24,835 --> 01:12:29,568
We're with the National Association
of Gay and Lesbian Professionals.

1083
01:12:29,773 --> 01:12:33,607
We have selected you as
Chicago's Gay Man of the Year.

1084
01:12:34,845 --> 01:12:36,710
Congratulations, Oscar.

1085
01:12:36,913 --> 01:12:39,541
The ceremony is Friday.
We'd like you to give a speech...

1086
01:12:39,749 --> 01:12:42,582
...along the lines of what
you said in the paper.

1087
01:12:42,786 --> 01:12:45,084
So what do you say?
Do you accept?

1088
01:12:48,892 --> 01:12:50,723
Of course he accepts.

1089
01:12:52,295 --> 01:12:55,594
l haven't done anything
or anyone to deserve this.

1090
01:12:55,799 --> 01:12:57,699
Nobody deserves it more.

1091
01:12:57,901 --> 01:13:00,836
-Great. We'll be in touch.
-And congratulations again.

1092
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:04,199
This is great. lt's perfect.

1093
01:13:04,407 --> 01:13:07,808
First of all, l've already decided
you two have the job.

1094
01:13:09,012 --> 01:13:10,639
Oscar gives his speech...

1095
01:13:10,881 --> 01:13:13,611
...l tell the press my
super Gay Man of the Year...

1096
01:13:13,817 --> 01:13:15,409
...and his partner have won.

1097
01:13:15,619 --> 01:13:18,918
lt's perfect. Then we have
a press conference and--

1098
01:13:25,028 --> 01:13:28,259
Would someone tell me what
Amy is doing talking to my wife?

1099
01:13:28,465 --> 01:13:29,659
That's your wife?

1100
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,299
Let's go.

1101
01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:40,137
Darling.

1102
01:13:42,012 --> 01:13:44,412
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

1103
01:13:44,614 --> 01:13:48,243
The concert got canceled. You know
how temperamental cellists are.

1104
01:13:48,451 --> 01:13:51,284
And l've had an interest in
this project, so here l am.

1105
01:13:51,488 --> 01:13:54,753
l'd like to introduce you
to Oscar Novak and Peter Steinberg.

1106
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:58,394
Congratulations.
Your design is superb.

1107
01:13:58,595 --> 01:14:00,495
We were just discussing it.

1108
01:14:02,232 --> 01:14:04,962
l'm sorry. This is...

1109
01:14:05,368 --> 01:14:06,767
...my girlfriend, Amy.

1110
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:08,460
And, Amy, this is...

1111
01:14:09,139 --> 01:14:11,369
...my boss, Charles.

1112
01:14:13,543 --> 01:14:15,135
l'm sorry.

1113
01:14:15,512 --> 01:14:16,945
Aren't you gay?

1114
01:14:19,516 --> 01:14:20,380
Excuse me?

1115
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:22,244
Didn't l read you were gay?

1116
01:14:23,687 --> 01:14:25,450
Well, yes, l am.

1117
01:14:25,822 --> 01:14:26,914
Sometimes.

1118
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:29,918
Oscar's omnisexual.

1119
01:14:31,528 --> 01:14:32,654
He swings...

1120
01:14:33,363 --> 01:14:34,330
...every which way.

1121
01:14:39,269 --> 01:14:41,100
lf you'll excuse me.

1122
01:14:44,841 --> 01:14:45,933
Shouldn't...

1123
01:14:46,776 --> 01:14:47,868
...you go after her?

1124
01:14:56,853 --> 01:14:58,047
Say something.

1125
01:14:59,322 --> 01:15:00,653
That wasn't so bad.

1126
01:15:00,857 --> 01:15:02,222
lt wasn't?

1127
01:15:02,425 --> 01:15:05,121
l knew it might happen eventually
and it did and...

1128
01:15:05,328 --> 01:15:07,626
...look at me.
l'm still standing.

1129
01:15:07,964 --> 01:15:09,124
Good.

1130
01:15:09,332 --> 01:15:12,130
l think you're handling this
like a real champ.

1131
01:15:15,905 --> 01:15:17,270
Where are we going?

1132
01:15:17,607 --> 01:15:19,006
To get really...

1133
01:15:19,376 --> 01:15:20,741
...really drunk.

1134
01:15:33,323 --> 01:15:36,781
The thing is,
she seemed so nice, you know?

1135
01:15:37,761 --> 01:15:40,730
Pleasant and charming.
Didn't you think she was charming?

1136
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:44,792
Maybe she didn't notice
anything was weird.

1137
01:15:45,035 --> 01:15:47,026
Maybe she didn't
even notice that....

1138
01:15:48,505 --> 01:15:50,530
Charles did a good
job covering, right?

1139
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:53,569
Right.

1140
01:15:55,645 --> 01:15:58,944
So it's probably fine.
l'll pretend it never happened.

1141
01:16:02,752 --> 01:16:04,151
lt's okay.

1142
01:16:05,455 --> 01:16:07,252
l feel much better now.

1143
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:10,053
Let's dance.

1144
01:16:11,928 --> 01:16:12,895
We shouldn't--

1145
01:16:13,096 --> 01:16:14,154
Come on.

1146
01:16:14,364 --> 01:16:15,763
We're gonna dance.

1147
01:16:32,382 --> 01:16:34,873
Have you ever kissed a woman before?

1148
01:16:59,142 --> 01:17:00,939
Perfect. That is just perfect!

1149
01:17:01,144 --> 01:17:04,011
That would be just like me
to fall in love with you.

1150
01:17:04,214 --> 01:17:06,682
l have tried every kind
of unavailable man.

1151
01:17:06,883 --> 01:17:09,579
A gay guy would really
round out my collection.

1152
01:17:10,253 --> 01:17:13,120
-l'm losing my mind.
-You're not.

1153
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:17,783
You have been so good to me
and what do l do? l try to kiss you.

1154
01:17:17,994 --> 01:17:19,689
l am so sorry.

1155
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:21,427
Don't be sorry.

1156
01:17:21,631 --> 01:17:24,896
lt's just that sometimes,
you and l seem so....

1157
01:17:26,636 --> 01:17:28,069
l don't know.

1158
01:17:29,839 --> 01:17:33,104
Man, l'm such a fucking mess.
You know what?

1159
01:17:33,309 --> 01:17:37,075
l'm just being dramatic.
l'm tired. l'm gonna be fine.

1160
01:17:37,647 --> 01:17:38,909
Let's go.

1161
01:17:39,415 --> 01:17:41,883
Yeah, well, you certainly look fine.

1162
01:17:42,452 --> 01:17:46,616
Listen, l bought this tough-girl
routine for about five seconds.

1163
01:17:46,823 --> 01:17:48,256
-What?
-Look at you.

1164
01:17:48,491 --> 01:17:50,982
This is killing you.
Why are you with him?

1165
01:17:51,194 --> 01:17:53,424
What are you talking about?
lt works.

1166
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:54,460
lt works?

1167
01:17:54,664 --> 01:17:56,598
-Yeah, it works.
-Come on.

1168
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:57,731
Where's this going?

1169
01:17:57,934 --> 01:18:00,164
At least he's straight,
for chrissakes!

1170
01:18:02,605 --> 01:18:04,197
That's really great.

1171
01:18:06,075 --> 01:18:07,702
l get what l need from him.

1172
01:18:09,078 --> 01:18:10,409
Well, so does his wife.

1173
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:17,512
Give me one good reason you're
with him. Just one good reason.

1174
01:18:18,121 --> 01:18:20,316
ln a year and a half,
we haven't had one fight.

1175
01:18:20,523 --> 01:18:23,686
He doesn't care about you
enough to fight with you.

1176
01:18:23,893 --> 01:18:28,023
God, l can't believe l'm getting
grilled by you of all people!

1177
01:18:28,565 --> 01:18:30,658
You haven't had a date
since l met you!

1178
01:18:30,867 --> 01:18:33,301
You don't know a thing
about relationships!

1179
01:18:33,503 --> 01:18:36,131
You just sit around with me
and play it safe!

1180
01:18:38,775 --> 01:18:40,504
Well, l don't know about you...

1181
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:43,702
...but l'm getting a little tired
of playing it safe.

1182
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,818
So what are you waiting for?

1183
01:18:55,925 --> 01:18:59,554
You know, what l have with Charles
may not be perfect...

1184
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:02,521
...but what l have with you is what?

1185
01:19:06,803 --> 01:19:07,963
What?

1186
01:20:52,308 --> 01:20:54,606
Mr. Novak, you can't--

1187
01:20:58,147 --> 01:21:00,809
She hasn't come home.
She hasn't called.

1188
01:21:01,517 --> 01:21:04,145
So l was thinking
maybe you know where she is.

1189
01:21:05,288 --> 01:21:06,653
Do you know where she is?

1190
01:21:08,558 --> 01:21:10,492
l'm very disappointed in you.

1191
01:21:11,527 --> 01:21:12,653
Excuse me?

1192
01:21:13,463 --> 01:21:15,863
You were supposed
to watch out for her.

1193
01:21:16,566 --> 01:21:18,591
You were supposed to protect her.

1194
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:21,836
Look, l tried.
l went after her.

1195
01:21:22,038 --> 01:21:24,438
l tried talking to her,
but she was really upset.

1196
01:21:24,674 --> 01:21:27,302
She has been gone for two days.

1197
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:29,375
She could be anywhere.

1198
01:21:30,546 --> 01:21:32,537
How could you let this happen?

1199
01:21:33,349 --> 01:21:35,340
How could you let her get hurt?

1200
01:21:36,486 --> 01:21:38,044
That's a very good question.

1201
01:21:38,254 --> 01:21:40,017
You might want to try that
on yourself.

1202
01:21:48,097 --> 01:21:50,463
Because l know you'd never
take that tone...

1203
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:53,294
...with a person who just
granted you...

1204
01:21:53,503 --> 01:21:56,597
...a $90-million job...

1205
01:21:58,007 --> 01:21:59,804
...l'll pretend you didn't say that.

1206
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:04,202
l hope l don't have to embarrass you
by reminding you...

1207
01:22:04,414 --> 01:22:05,847
...that no friendship...

1208
01:22:06,649 --> 01:22:09,140
...can compare to what Amy...

1209
01:22:09,352 --> 01:22:10,944
...and l have.

1210
01:22:11,687 --> 01:22:13,746
-Do l make myself clear?
-Yes.

1211
01:22:16,826 --> 01:22:17,918
Perfectly.

1212
01:22:20,062 --> 01:22:20,892
Thank you.

1213
01:22:31,641 --> 01:22:33,404
We'd like to get started...

1214
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:36,043
...by saying a few words
about our organization.

1215
01:22:36,245 --> 01:22:37,507
This is our ninth year...

1216
01:22:37,713 --> 01:22:41,513
...and we've come a long way in
recognizing gays and lesbians....

1217
01:22:43,386 --> 01:22:45,251
You okay?
How you doing? Ready to go?

1218
01:22:45,455 --> 01:22:48,481
Fine. Got my speech
written on cards.

1219
01:22:48,958 --> 01:22:50,118
l can handle this.

1220
01:22:50,326 --> 01:22:53,818
l mean, it's just
a bunch of people, right?

1221
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:56,430
-Giving you an award.
-How could that be bad?

1222
01:22:56,632 --> 01:22:57,656
Exactly.

1223
01:22:57,867 --> 01:23:01,268
Plus, once this is done,
we can start on the project.

1224
01:23:01,471 --> 01:23:04,065
You know, you're right.
You're right.

1225
01:23:04,273 --> 01:23:06,070
And l have to say...

1226
01:23:06,275 --> 01:23:11,042
...l'm proud of you, the way that
you've evolved this mature attitude--

1227
01:23:11,247 --> 01:23:12,680
Well, thank you, thank you...

1228
01:23:12,882 --> 01:23:14,110
...because...

1229
01:23:14,617 --> 01:23:17,381
...you know, l figure
if l can't have Amy...

1230
01:23:17,587 --> 01:23:20,920
...then it won't be so bad.
l can pretend to be gay for a while.

1231
01:23:21,524 --> 01:23:23,515
You like being gay, right?

1232
01:23:23,726 --> 01:23:24,920
lt works well for me.

1233
01:23:25,127 --> 01:23:28,460
lt won't be bad. l can always
sneak off to straight bars...

1234
01:23:28,664 --> 01:23:30,427
...have anonymous sex
with straight women.

1235
01:23:30,633 --> 01:23:33,295
That's why giving this speech is fine.
lt's more than fine.

1236
01:23:33,503 --> 01:23:35,733
lt is very fine.

1237
01:23:42,745 --> 01:23:44,235
Oscar, about Amy....

1238
01:23:45,014 --> 01:23:47,847
You know there are other fish
in the sea, right?

1239
01:23:48,885 --> 01:23:51,649
Well, you know, l used to think that.

1240
01:23:52,188 --> 01:23:54,679
But what if you find ''the'' fish?

1241
01:23:56,659 --> 01:23:59,150
You're right. Plenty of fish.
You're probably right.

1242
01:23:59,362 --> 01:24:00,659
Yes, l'm right.

1243
01:24:00,863 --> 01:24:02,660
-l think l'm right.
-l think so.

1244
01:24:02,865 --> 01:24:06,494
lt's a pleasure to introduce
our Gay Professional of the Year....

1245
01:24:06,736 --> 01:24:08,135
Well, l gotta go.

1246
01:24:08,704 --> 01:24:10,399
lKick some ass, you hear me?

1247
01:24:10,873 --> 01:24:13,307
Say it with me.
lKick some ass!

1248
01:24:13,876 --> 01:24:16,003
-Okay. lKick some ass.
-lKick some ass.

1249
01:24:35,064 --> 01:24:36,429
Thank you.

1250
01:24:36,632 --> 01:24:40,033
Thank you for inviting me
here this evening.

1251
01:24:40,236 --> 01:24:43,034
These last few weeks
have been very exciting.

1252
01:24:44,407 --> 01:24:47,899
Peter and l had the opportunity
to work on a project...

1253
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:51,170
...that has become a dream come true.

1254
01:24:52,949 --> 01:24:54,678
This award is an honor...

1255
01:24:54,884 --> 01:24:57,444
...an honor which l accept with--

1256
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:16,163
You know, awards are a funny thing.

1257
01:25:16,372 --> 01:25:20,035
l won an award once.
l was in summer camp. l was 7.

1258
01:25:20,242 --> 01:25:22,676
lt was a bumper-pool tournament...

1259
01:25:22,912 --> 01:25:24,379
...and l won.

1260
01:25:24,981 --> 01:25:28,178
But it was kind of an empty victory
because l cheated.

1261
01:25:30,152 --> 01:25:34,486
When nobody was looking, l just
shoved all the balls into the pockets.

1262
01:25:35,358 --> 01:25:39,954
And the funny thing is, l felt
guilty about that my whole life.

1263
01:26:16,132 --> 01:26:20,034
l guess what l'm trying to say
is that a lot of you...

1264
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:23,136
...know what it's like
to be in the closet.

1265
01:26:23,339 --> 01:26:25,637
So you know what it's like
to have a secret.

1266
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:28,699
Constantly worried
about slipping up...

1267
01:26:29,812 --> 01:26:33,248
...hiding your feelings from the
people that are supposed to...

1268
01:26:33,983 --> 01:26:35,814
...mean the most to you.

1269
01:26:36,585 --> 01:26:39,554
And what l admire about
all the people here tonight...

1270
01:26:40,756 --> 01:26:44,317
...is that you're not afraid
to be honest about who you are.

1271
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:47,354
You're strong enough to stand up...

1272
01:26:47,563 --> 01:26:50,031
...for the dignity of telling
the people you love...

1273
01:26:52,368 --> 01:26:53,835
...how you feel.

1274
01:26:56,172 --> 01:26:57,332
Now, l....

1275
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,701
l know a little bit about this...

1276
01:27:01,077 --> 01:27:03,238
...because for the last three weeks...

1277
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:05,969
...l've had a secret.

1278
01:27:09,285 --> 01:27:12,015
And it's time for me
to come out of the closet.

1279
01:27:15,591 --> 01:27:17,024
l'm not gay.

1280
01:27:33,175 --> 01:27:34,802
Amy, l love you.

1281
01:27:37,446 --> 01:27:39,937
l haven't been honest with you.

1282
01:27:42,885 --> 01:27:44,045
But l love you.

1283
01:27:45,788 --> 01:27:47,881
l've never felt that way about anyone.

1284
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,789
And l know...

1285
01:27:52,895 --> 01:27:54,192
...that by telling you this...

1286
01:27:54,396 --> 01:27:57,695
...l might have lost any chance
l ever had to be with you.

1287
01:27:58,334 --> 01:28:00,302
But l believe you deserve...

1288
01:28:03,506 --> 01:28:06,270
...that everybody here deserves...

1289
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:11,145
...that kind of honesty.

1290
01:28:53,622 --> 01:28:55,647
-Thank you.
-Don't worry.

1291
01:28:55,858 --> 01:28:58,326
l'm very proud of you...

1292
01:28:58,527 --> 01:29:00,392
...you big drama queen.

1293
01:29:00,596 --> 01:29:01,563
Go get her.

1294
01:29:06,235 --> 01:29:08,533
Oscar, get your ass back here!

1295
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,129
A melee ensued today...

1296
01:29:12,341 --> 01:29:16,004
...at the Gay and Lesbian
Association's awards ceremony...

1297
01:29:16,212 --> 01:29:20,273
...as the Gay Man of the Year
declared his love for a woman.

1298
01:29:20,549 --> 01:29:21,743
Get back.

1299
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,588
l think Oscar and Amy need to talk.
Don't you?

1300
01:29:28,023 --> 01:29:30,184
Onlookers were amazed...

1301
01:29:30,392 --> 01:29:33,987
...as the Gay Man of the Year,
Oscar Novak, leapt from the stage...

1302
01:29:34,196 --> 01:29:36,494
...and pursued the woman
into the lobby...

1303
01:29:36,699 --> 01:29:38,894
...where crowds were
awaiting her response.

1304
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:42,099
Can we please just talk about this?

1305
01:29:45,507 --> 01:29:47,168
And it wasn't pretty.

1306
01:29:47,509 --> 01:29:49,670
You promised you'd never
lie to me.

1307
01:29:50,045 --> 01:29:51,512
We had a deal.

1308
01:29:51,714 --> 01:29:53,341
Get out of my way, you big freak.

1309
01:29:53,549 --> 01:29:55,847
Don't make me make you
my prison-bitch.

1310
01:29:57,119 --> 01:29:59,178
The incident reached
a fever pitch...

1311
01:30:00,155 --> 01:30:01,349
Great punch. Let's go.

1312
01:30:01,557 --> 01:30:05,254
...as Charles Newman, the renowned
international businessman...

1313
01:30:05,461 --> 01:30:08,294
...incurred the wrath of
the same unidentified woman.

1314
01:30:09,498 --> 01:30:12,296
Before police could arrive
on the scene...

1315
01:30:12,534 --> 01:30:16,937
...the enraged, yet fashionably
attired young woman escaped.

1316
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:20,599
How about that?

1317
01:30:20,809 --> 01:30:23,175
Gay Man of the Year: Not gay.

1318
01:30:24,146 --> 01:30:24,976
Are you okay?

1319
01:30:25,314 --> 01:30:29,148
You're fired. You will never work
for me, nor for anyone l know.

1320
01:30:29,351 --> 01:30:31,216
Which is everyone.

1321
01:30:32,021 --> 01:30:33,215
l don't care.

1322
01:30:33,422 --> 01:30:34,980
And you know why?

1323
01:30:35,491 --> 01:30:38,483
Because l don't like you.

1324
01:30:42,298 --> 01:30:44,596
Found him and housebroke him.

1325
01:30:50,339 --> 01:30:51,169
Excuse me.

1326
01:30:52,474 --> 01:30:54,408
That was a brave thing
your partner did.

1327
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:57,443
Yes. l have to say,
l'm very proud of the little guy.

1328
01:30:57,646 --> 01:31:01,514
l don't believe we've officially met.
l'm lKevin Cartwright.

1329
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:04,208
Yes, l know.
l've heard all about you.

1330
01:31:04,453 --> 01:31:06,045
Really? Like what?

1331
01:31:07,423 --> 01:31:09,482
Nothing specific really.

1332
01:31:09,959 --> 01:31:11,221
Well, it's all true.

1333
01:31:12,995 --> 01:31:15,259
-Would you like to get a drink?
-l'd love to.

1334
01:32:41,383 --> 01:32:42,782
Don't do it.

1335
01:32:47,956 --> 01:32:49,355
Yes, but l...

1336
01:32:49,558 --> 01:32:51,458
...deserve to die.

1337
01:32:53,695 --> 01:32:54,889
Not yet.

1338
01:32:57,933 --> 01:32:59,161
What are you doing here?

1339
01:32:59,968 --> 01:33:01,367
l thought l'd find you here.

1340
01:33:02,504 --> 01:33:03,334
Really?

1341
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:05,700
-Oh, my God, l'm so--
-Just shut up.

1342
01:33:11,013 --> 01:33:14,449
-l want to get a few things straight.
-Me too. l just--

1343
01:33:15,451 --> 01:33:17,578
l'm gonna be quiet now.

1344
01:33:20,155 --> 01:33:21,144
So...

1345
01:33:21,924 --> 01:33:25,325
...you lied to protect your job.
You violated my trust and friendship.

1346
01:33:25,527 --> 01:33:28,587
You tricked me into telling you things
l never would have.

1347
01:33:28,797 --> 01:33:30,526
Are you proud of yourself?

1348
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,634
-Go ahead.
-No.

1349
01:33:41,577 --> 01:33:43,169
Was it really worth it?

1350
01:33:48,517 --> 01:33:50,644
l have one thing left to say to you.

1351
01:33:56,258 --> 01:33:58,226
l get the left side of the bed.

1352
01:34:08,003 --> 01:34:09,368
Well, you know...

1353
01:34:10,405 --> 01:34:12,430
...we'll have to see about that.

1354
01:34:15,077 --> 01:34:16,442
Let's get out of here.

1355
01:34:16,645 --> 01:34:18,044
Yeah, l'd like that.

1356
01:34:27,422 --> 01:34:30,152
So l take it you have kissed
a woman before.

1357
01:34:32,728 --> 01:34:34,286
Not the right one.

1358
01:35:06,295 --> 01:35:09,890
Overall, an evening of shock
and amazement for everyone...

1359
01:35:10,098 --> 01:35:12,464
...as the Gay Man
of the Year announced:

1360
01:35:12,901 --> 01:35:14,562
I'm not gay.

1361
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:22,003
Won't it be awkward working
with Oscar after that fiasco?

1362
01:35:22,211 --> 01:35:24,805
Actually, l went
with the other firm.

1363
01:35:25,047 --> 01:35:26,776
You're depriving them of a job...

1364
01:35:26,982 --> 01:35:29,974
...just because he's in love
with your mistress?

1365
01:35:30,986 --> 01:35:32,317
Oh, you're hurt.

1366
01:35:32,754 --> 01:35:34,278
l realize this girl was special.

1367
01:35:34,489 --> 01:35:37,356
Olivia, l don't know
what you're talking about.

1368
01:35:37,559 --> 01:35:39,754
l simply went with the other firm.

1369
01:35:40,362 --> 01:35:42,262
Oscar and Peter did a better job.

1370
01:35:42,764 --> 01:35:45,460
They will build the cultural center.

1371
01:35:46,134 --> 01:35:46,896
Enough!

1372
01:35:48,136 --> 01:35:49,694
The decision's been made.

1373
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,136
Now...

1374
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:55,333
...why don't you go put on those
red bikini briefs that l gave you?

1375
01:35:55,577 --> 01:35:57,511
l love the way your butt
looks in them.

1376
01:35:57,713 --> 01:35:59,806
l really don't want to.

1377
01:36:00,949 --> 01:36:03,884
What happens when l'm unhappy?
What happens?

1378
01:36:05,621 --> 01:36:06,645
Fine.

1379
01:36:07,522 --> 01:36:09,353
But not the red ones.

1380
01:36:09,891 --> 01:36:10,983
They bind.

1381
01:36:20,035 --> 01:36:21,798
I want to swing
With that pussycat

1382
01:36:22,004 --> 01:36:24,063
I want to dance
With that pussycat

1383
01:36:24,273 --> 01:36:26,434
I want to fly
With that pussycat

1384
01:36:26,642 --> 01:36:28,803
I want to jump
With that pussycat

1385
01:36:29,011 --> 01:36:30,638
I want to swing

1386
01:36:32,047 --> 01:36:33,878
Kitty, kitty
Please come here

1387
01:36:34,082 --> 01:36:35,174
Don't hiss and moan

1388
01:36:35,384 --> 01:36:37,045
When I come near
Don't bite my neck

1389
01:36:37,252 --> 01:36:38,776
Don't scratch my eyes

1390
01:36:38,987 --> 01:36:40,955
I'll take away those doll eyes

1391
01:36:41,156 --> 01:36:43,920
A man's a man, a rat's a rat
So swing

1392
01:36:44,693 --> 01:36:46,558
Sweet pussycat
Swing

1393
01:36:46,795 --> 01:36:48,786
Sweet pussycat
Swing

1394
01:37:28,236 --> 01:37:30,033
All night long
