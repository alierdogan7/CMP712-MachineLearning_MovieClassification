1313
01:33:02,642 --> 01:33:04,551
Keep in touch.

1314
01:33:04,658 --> 01:33:07,341
Bye, Dad.

1315
01:33:13,842 --> 01:33:18,544
[Joanie] Do you want me
to open you a can of beer?

1316
01:33:18,642 --> 01:33:23,017
That would be lovely, Joanie.
With you in a sec.

1317
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:27,116
I'm giving it another chance
with Chook.

1318
01:33:27,282 --> 01:33:29,933
As soon as he gets out
of the correction centre.

1319
01:33:30,034 --> 01:33:33,100
They've accused him of raping
a Japanese tourist, which is ridiculous!

1320
01:33:33,201 --> 01:33:35,503
Chook hates the Japanese.

1321
01:33:35,602 --> 01:33:39,497
We better fly.
We're meeting Rose Biggs for lunch.

1322
01:33:39,602 --> 01:33:42,951
Rose Biggs?
Are you friends with her?

1323
01:33:43,058 --> 01:33:46,254
Once we got to know her,
we found out she was just like us.

1324
01:33:46,354 --> 01:33:50,216
- But Rose Biggs sucked
your husband's cock. Oh, she did.
- Rhonda!

1325
01:33:50,322 --> 01:33:52,395
I know, but, well...

1326
01:33:52,498 --> 01:33:57,932
I sucked her husband's cock, and it made
me realize we all make mistakes.

1327
01:33:58,034 --> 01:34:00,423
[Muriel]
Hi.

1328
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:03,759
- [Mrs. Epinstall] Mariel.
- Muriel.

1329
01:34:03,858 --> 01:34:06,313
What a surprise.

1330
01:34:06,418 --> 01:34:11,950
Rhonda, Mariel...
Muriel's come to visit you.

1331
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:16,240
Actually I've come to ask Rhonda
if she wants to come back to Sydney.

1332
01:34:16,338 --> 01:34:20,648
I've got a taxi outside
and two plane tickets, if you want to.

1333
01:34:20,754 --> 01:34:23,023
What about your husband?

1334
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:25,577
We broke up.

1335
01:34:25,682 --> 01:34:28,268
[Whispers]
I knew it wouldn't last.

1336
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:31,632
What makes you think
I'd go anywhere with you?

1337
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:33,770
Because I'm your friend.

1338
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:39,920
Muriel, you can't come
barging in here without warning,

1339
01:34:40,018 --> 01:34:42,985
trying to turn Rhonda against
the people who love her.

1340
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:47,083
Against the people who were there
for her when she needed them.

1341
01:34:49,714 --> 01:34:52,747
- Yes, she can.
- [Sighs]

1342
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:55,697
Sorry, Mum. You know I love you,
but you drive me crazy.

1343
01:34:55,794 --> 01:34:59,056
And you three...
What a bunch of cocksuckers.

1344
01:35:05,554 --> 01:35:09,809
[Laughing]

1345
01:35:14,257 --> 01:35:16,646
Who do you think you are
to call me that?

1346
01:35:16,754 --> 01:35:19,983
I'm married!
I'm beautiful!
