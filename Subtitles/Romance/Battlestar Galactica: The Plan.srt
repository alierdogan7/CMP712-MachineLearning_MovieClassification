Thanks for exposing me.

BROTHER CAVIL:
You weren't doing fine,
thank goodness.

10
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,458
If you'd wiped
out this fleet,

11
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,585
you'd have made us
even more irredeemable

12
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,003
in the eyes
of our parents.

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,589
No, I'd have proved us
to be superior.

14
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,342
No, no, see,
I've figured out
what went wrong.

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,261
Well, that's a very useful
revelation to have

16
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,806
when you're standing
in front of an airlock.

17
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,143
Nonetheless...
Our failure is obvious.

18
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:46,773
We had our foot on the throat
of humanity and we failed
to step down hard enough.

19
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:47,899
That was our error.

20
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,777
Have you learned
nothing in all this
time in this fleet?

21
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,572
Because I learned
a great deal among
the rebels on Caprica.

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,576
Every killing
of a human being
was a grievous error.

23
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,120
Do you want to know why?

24
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,288
I really don't.

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,957
Are you certain?
Because it's fascinating.

26
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,336
Listen, Brother,
if you're right,

27
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,839
that means this whole project
was doomed from the beginning.

28
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,717
Yes.
From the very top.

29
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,756

30
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,592

they won't survive
the death of the Colonies.

Life among humans
will have humbled them.

36
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,364
When they resurrect,
they'll return

37
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,659
with apologies tumbling
from their lips like jewels.

38
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,745

some very sticky hugs.

a yen to experience a nuclear
holocaust in person.

Perhaps with our dear
mother here,

41
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:38,092
I'll slide in another tub,
and we can download
side-by-side,

hit on Picon.

yourself if you want.

But I'll be on Caprica,
making final arrangements
with our contact.

45

So if you're going to go,
go soon.

to know that the final results
of the CNP project

47
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,645
are working close
to 95% efficiency
throughout the Fleet.

48

50

I doubt you would've
ever completed
the project without me.

51
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,947
Yes. Well,
you helped a bit.

52
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,115
I rewrote
half your algorithms.

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,533
All right,
you were extremely helpful,

54
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,161
but let's not forget,
you got something out of it.

All that poking around
inside the defense mainframe.

56
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,796
It should give you
a huge advantage bidding
for the contract next year.

57

You know that's not
really why I did it.

58
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,509
No. You did it
'cause you love me.

59
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,512

you'd get here.

detonate the charges.

I mean, these humans,
there are so few of them.
They're no threat.

They are manifestly
a threat.

502
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,925
They're a threat
because of the power they
have to make you do this.

503

Of all Cylons,
you should see that.

they think that? That's crazy.

there are those who think
this current devastation

is punishment
for man's sins.

Is that what you believe,
Brother?

I don't believe
it's punishment
from the Gods, no.

544

But perhaps...

545
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:11,698
Perhaps the Cylons

that the Gods once had.

about the courageous Five

who weren't supposed to be
alive in the first place.

578

No one was supposed
to be alive! Our people were
supposed to be positioned

not mop up afterwards.

and one of the Sixes
was a prostitute.

But the only one
in a position to do
any frakking damage

583
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,013
was a Five on this ship,
and he frakked it up!

still has these

for a moment

that I'm gonna be moved

that you married one of them.

I promised to hear
his confession,

667

keep our promises.

Okay, go, go.

so far ahead?

00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,204
Doctor, it's all right.
It's a lie.

676
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,955
The photograph
was a fake.
What?

677
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,503
It was almost seamless,
but your face,

678
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,714

it was all a fake.

679
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,550
I went back, I re-ran
all the security checks.

680
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:19,180
This time I found
markers which pointed
to photo manipulation.

681
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,433
They weren't apparent
until the photo
was fully resolved.

682
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,606
Thank you.

683
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,318
It was really nothing, Doctor.
Once the photos
were fully resolved,

684
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,154
it was almost too easy,
like she wanted
to be found out.

687

She's fast.
She's almost beyond human.

688
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,131
How did she get
off of the ship?
Got me.

689
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,008
There's been no ships
coming or going.
I gave you an order.

690
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,260
I had two Marines
tailing her.

691
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,012
They say they went
around a corner
and she was gone.

692
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,555
Every ship in the Fleet
has reported in, sir.

693
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,598
There's no sign
of her.

694
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:05,726
That's unacceptable.
She was here.
She was right here.

695
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:09,438

She didn't just vanish.

Baltar, he helped us
so much on Caprica...

704

Are you attracted
to this human?
No.

705
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,978
'Cause the other Six
got addicted to him.

706
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:54,650
I'm not addicted!
Baltar's a brilliant man, yes,
but you should've seen me.

707
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,902
I was brutal with him.
I pushed him.

01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,154
You pushed him.

709

you would have sent him
through a wall.

once in the head?

I could get this done

843

was to turn myself
into a Centurion.

turning hard.

845
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:48,929
I could feel the bullets
moving through the channels
under my hard metal skin.

846

my heartbeat.

01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:19,400
Well, no.
Barolay was there and
she was gonna see me run.

1008
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:27,950
And suddenly I find myself
worrying about my own
frakking reputation.

1009
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,662
So, I didn't run.

1010
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,459
And that's my confession.
I'm a godsdamn coward,
Brother.

1011
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,006
Well,
I suppose you were.

1012
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:45,217
But what about now?

1013
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,764
I'm not gonna run anymore.

1014
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:55,353
Maybe I'm stronger
or maybe I'm just
more insane.

1015
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:01,192
This whole experience
has changed you
for the better.

1016
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,568
You've learned.

1017
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:04,946
You know,
at the end of a confession,

1018
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:08,324
sometimes there's
an ending or, you know...

1019
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:12,370
Yes, fine. You are absolved
in the example of the Gods.

1020
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:19,460
Now, Sam, listen,
given that this holocaust

1021
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:22,797


was a journey
of learning for you...

1022
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,757
Journey? I don't know
if it was a journey...

1023
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,885
Well, given that,
it can...

1024
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:31,013
Can you

1025
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:36,894
forgive the Cylons?

1026
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:39,563
Because if you can,

1027
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:42,650
that's really transcendent.
I know you didn't
just say that.

1028
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,235
I mean,
they must've
had a purpose.

1029
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:47,488
Something must've
made them...
Made them what?

1030
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,199
End everything?
Destroy billions
of souls?

1031
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:52,743
No, frak, no.
Humanity had so much sin.

1032
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:54,078
Are you kidding me?

1033
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:56,288
They made you put
all these dead...
Wait a second.

1034
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:59,333
...on your shoulders.
Are you defending them?
Listen, Brother,

01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:00,751
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that, okay?

01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,754
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear any of that.

01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:49,204
Cylon and man
will now go
their separate ways.

1174
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:50,372
No harm done.

1175
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:51,790
ADAMA: No harm?

1176
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:53,834
You completely
annihilated our race

1177
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:56,127
and destroyed
our civilization.

1178
01:42:56,838 --> 01:42:59,047
Now, if you're gonna start
pointing fingers...

1179
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:01,842
You see, we're not like you.

1180
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:04,970
We can admit our mistakes,
and we're not afraid
of change.

1181
01:43:05,054 --> 01:43:08,431
New marching orders
by your one true god?

1182
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,725
There is no god.

1183
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:14,354
Supernatural divinities
are the primitive's answer

1184
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:16,439
for why the sun
goes down at night.

1185
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:19,109
At least that's what
we've been telling
the others for years.

1186
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:21,486
We can't really prove it
one way or the other,
of course.

1187
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:23,363
TIGH: Enough.
Let's airlock them both.

1188
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:29,828
ADAMA: Airlock them.

1189
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,009
Hold it at the door.

1190
01:43:44,093 --> 01:43:45,135
GUARD: Yes, sir.

1191
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,804
TIGH: Check the hall.

1192
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:50,557
Stop. Stop.

1193
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:57,397
Sweep the halls.
Clear up ahead,
there are too many civilians.

1194
01:44:08,117 --> 01:44:09,951
Not how I imagined it.

1195
01:44:10,036 --> 01:44:11,286
(SIGHS) No, Brother.

1196
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:12,662
All right.

1197
01:44:49,325 --> 01:44:51,952
Is there a Resurrection ship
in range?

1198
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,495
(ALARM BLARING)

1199
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:56,539
Yes, Brother.
But first,
we're gonna die in a vacuum.

1200
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:58,875
There's a 170-foot
launch tube in front of us.

1201
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,295
We might die of our injuries
before we get to the vacuum.

1202
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:05,966
I don't like you.

1203
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:07,467
I understand that.

1204
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:10,428
Do you really believe
it was a mistake
to attack the humans?

1205
01:45:10,972 --> 01:45:12,889
Rather intensely, yes.

1206
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,558
You know that
when we download
among the others,

1207
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:18,061
your strange ideas
will be shouted down.

1208
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:21,481
Ideas only seem strange
until you try them on,
Brother.

1209
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:24,317
We had a temper tantrum
in the form of a cataclysm

1210
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:28,321
because we wanted them
to treasure us, the Ones,
more than humanity.

1211
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:30,615
More than their
own history and blood.

1212
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:34,995
(SCOFFS) We didn't want
to be loved. We wanted
to be treated fairly.

1213
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:37,664
We wanted to be
held to a bosom,

1214
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:41,918
to be petted and perfumed
and told we were
the princes of the universe.

1215
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:44,629
(SCOFFS) Yes, well,
if the humans were gone...

1216
01:45:44,714 --> 01:45:46,840
Our parents
would mourn them.

1217
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,591
They'd love them more,
anyway.

1218
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:53,722
I am going to see to it
that you get boxed.

1219
01:45:53,806 --> 01:45:57,976
And then I'm going
to prepare to wipe out
humanity once and for all.

1220
01:46:01,147 --> 01:46:04,232
The anticipation
is really unpleasant.

1221
01:46:07,028 --> 01:46:08,111
Yes.

1222
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,129

I don't want to be human!

1224
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:33,094
I want to see gamma rays.

1225
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:36,222
I want to hear x-rays,
and I want to...

1226
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:38,725
I want to smell dark matter.

1227
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:41,061
I want
to reach out with something
other than these

1228
01:46:41,145 --> 01:46:43,480
prehensile paws

1229
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:47,358
and feel the solar
wind of a supernova
flowing over me.

1230
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:51,196
I'm a machine,

1231
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,324
and I could know much more.
