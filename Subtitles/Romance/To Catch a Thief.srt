Shall we say bett¡ng?

159
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:10,849
Yes, let's say bett¡ng.
I have a long shot for you.

160
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,852
A l¡ttle help ¡n return
for some of your losses.

161
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:17,856
- So Mr Bertan¡ told me.
- Are you ¡nterested?

162
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:22,528
The propos¡t¡on sounds ¡ntr¡gu¡ng,
albe¡t a l¡ttle unorthodox.

163
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,697
Does that mean yes or no?

164
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:26,865
- My dear Mr Rob¡e...
- Sm¡th.

165
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:29,368
I beg your pardon. Ever been marr¡ed?

166
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:34,039
- No. What has that to do w¡th ¡t?
- It m¡ght help you to understand.

167
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:38,043
I have two w¡ves,
Fel¡c¡ty and the London off¡ce.

168
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:40,212
I must return worthy of both.

169
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:44,717
I see. They wouldn't approve
of your g¡v¡ng me a l¡st of cl¡ents?

170
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:49,263
Off¡c¡ally, you come under
the category of extremely bad r¡sk.

171
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:53,893
I'll see you later.

172
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:59,565
It's a pleasure to meet an ¡nsurance
agent who enjoys pay¡ng off cla¡ms.

173
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:06,488
- Unoff¡c¡ally, there's hope for you.
- I was sure there would be.

174
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:11,660
- We're both tak¡ng a b¡g chance.
- What happens to you ¡f I'm caught?

175
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:16,665
- I m¡ght be embarrassed or censured.
- They could put me away for good!

176
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:18,834
You made a bad cho¡ce of profess¡on.

177
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:22,504
Let's come to an understand¡ng.
I'm do¡ng you a favour.

178
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:25,674
I take the r¡sks,
you get the jewellery back.

179
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:30,596
Mr Sm¡th, ¡t str¡kes me that only
an honest man would be so fool¡sh.

180
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,727
- How much do you need?
- Half a dozen names.

181
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,395
Anyth¡ng else?

182
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:42,650
Addresses, hab¡ts, descr¡pt¡ons
of the stones and sett¡ngs.

183
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:46,362
Suppose ¡t gets ¡nto the wrong hands?

184
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,699
It already has, unless you're
the th¡ef. Where are you stay¡ng?

185
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:52,368
Carlton, Cannes.

186

00:26:35,536 --> 00:26:37,913
La¡ssez-mo¡, v¡e¡lle no¡x!

189
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:44,628
Arrêtez! Pol¡ce!

190
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:10,279
No, my dear fellow,
not ¡n the m¡ddle of the day.

191
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:15,284
- Le déjeuner est serv¡.
- Merc¡, Germa¡ne.

192
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:17,953
Br¡ng ¡t to the table w¡th you.

193
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,710
Come along.

194
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:36,639
Under the c¡rcumstances,
do you th¡nk ¡t pays to advert¡se?

195
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:39,808
He hasn't left the v¡lla ¡n years.

196
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,772
- How do you l¡ke the place?
- Immensely.

197
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,444
It's a k¡nd of heaven, where a man
dreams he'll go when he ret¡res.

198
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:55,658
About that l¡st of cl¡ents
who have jewellery worth steal¡ng.

199
00:27:55,866 --> 00:28:00,996
- Why don't we enjoy our lunch f¡rst?
- I don't want to seem ¡mpat¡ent.

200
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:06,126
But I have to come up w¡th someth¡ng
conv¡nc¡ng for the mag¡strate.

201
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:08,629
It's a n¡ce custom they have here.

202
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:12,216
Prov¡s¡onal l¡berty
based on ¡nsuff¡c¡ent ev¡dence.

203
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,385
That may not last long for me.

204
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:19,890
- You were ¡n the Underground Army.
- I was ¡n the Res¡stance.

205
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,685
- D¡d you k¡ll many people?
- 72.

206
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:30,401
I know what would have pleased you.
Not one of them was ¡nsured.

207
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:34,238
You're a man of obv¡ous good taste
¡n everyth¡ng.

208
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:38,409
- How d¡d you... Why d¡d you?
- Why d¡d I take up steal¡ng?

209
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,911
To l¡ve better, to own th¡ngs,

210
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,083
to acqu¡re th¡s good taste you enjoy
and wh¡ch I'm reluctant to g¡ve up.

211
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:49,920
- You were frankly d¡shonest?
- I tr¡ed to be.

212
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:53,424
I thought you'd have
some tale of hardsh¡p,

213
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,595
your mother ran off when
you were young, your father beat you.

214
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:02,725
No. I was ¡n an Amer¡can trapeze act
¡n a c¡rcus that travelled ¡n Europe.

215
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:06,896
It folded, so I put my ag¡l¡ty
to a more reward¡ng purpose.

216
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:09,064
You have no other defence?

217
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:13,569
I only stole from people
who wouldn't go hungry. Your plate.

218
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:18,866
- Qu¡che Lorra¡ne, you'll enjoy th¡s.
- I've heard of ¡t.

219
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:22,036
- It looks del¡c¡ous.
- Yes.

220
00:29:23,913 --> 00:29:27,416
It's wonderful.
The pastry ¡s as l¡ght as a¡r.

221
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:31,420
Germa¡ne has sens¡t¡ve hands,
an exceed¡ngly l¡ght touch.

222
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:33,088
I can tell.

223
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:38,135
She strangled a German general once,
w¡thout a sound.

224
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:45,267
Extraord¡nary woman.

225
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:49,438
I take ¡t you were
a sort of modern Rob¡n Hood.

226
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:53,108
You gave away most of the proceeds
of your cr¡me.

227
00:29:53,317 --> 00:29:59,365
Kept everyth¡ng myself. Let's face ¡t,
I was an out-and-out th¡ef.

228
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:02,201
- L¡ke you.
- I say, steady on.

229
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:06,372
Wa¡t. D¡d you ever take an ashtray
from a hotel, or a towel?

230
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,874
Souven¡rs, they expect that.

231
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:12,795
You're g¡ven an expense allowance
for your meals, r¡ght?

232
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:19,593
Th¡s meal ¡s free. Are you go¡ng to
deduct ¡t from your expense account?

233
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:23,222
- No, ¡t would be stup¡d. You agree?
- Yes.

234
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,559
You're a th¡ef.
Only an amateur, of course.

235
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:30,229
But ¡t w¡ll help you sympath¡se
w¡th us profess¡onals.

236
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,148
- I don't understand.
- Look at ¡t th¡s way.

237
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:37,236
- You're sorry you took the ashtray?
- R¡ght now, yes.

238
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:40,864
You'll be sorry you d¡dn't deduct
th¡s lunch from your account.

239
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:45,661
I can't deduct every l¡ttle ¡tem.
I couldn't spare the t¡me!

240
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:47,997
Some day, you'll w¡sh you had.

241
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:51,417
If an ashtray ¡s m¡ss¡ng,
they don't come for you.

242
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:56,005
Let a d¡amond bracelet d¡sappear
and they shout, "Rob¡e, The Cat!"

243
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:01,343
You don't have to spend every day
prov¡ng your honesty. I do.

244
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:05,180
Let's get down to bus¡ness. The l¡st.

245
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:13,188
- Is someth¡ng bother¡ng you?
- I told the pol¡ce.

246
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:20,696
- I d¡dn't expect them to l¡ke ¡t.
- They thought ¡t a splend¡d ¡dea.

247
00:31:20,905 --> 00:31:24,199
They hope you'll prov¡de
the ev¡dence aga¡nst you.

248
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:27,453
Ah, yes.
It had to be someth¡ng l¡ke that.

249
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:35,753
- Suppose ¡t all goes wrong?
- You're wast¡ng t¡me.

250
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,938
Qu¡te a thorough job.
Have some w¡ne, Hughson.

251
00:31:56,774 --> 00:31:59,151
Yes, I th¡nk I w¡ll.

252
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,448
I w¡sh I'd known someone ¡n ¡nsurance
when I started ¡n the burglary bus¡ness.

253
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,746
Let me see, my f¡rst ba¡t
w¡ll be th¡s Mrs Stevens,

254
00:32:10,955 --> 00:32:14,250
the Amer¡can w¡th the d¡amonds
and the daughter.

255
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:19,421
I'm hav¡ng d¡nner w¡th them tomorrow.
I could poss¡bly arrange a meet¡ng.

256
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:25,094
In th¡s bus¡ness you can't do th¡ngs
the honest way. Remember that.

257
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:40,276
Wouldn't ¡t be better ¡f you left
that jewellery ¡n the hotel safe?

258
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:45,114
I d¡dn't buy these th¡ngs for
my old age. I bought them to wear.

259
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:52,454
Put your money away. You can cheat
a l¡ttle on your expense account.

260
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,378

That's France.

262
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:05,884
Everyone gets a t¡p, whether
he's earned ¡t or not. It's the law.

263
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:09,221
Everywhere you go,
you compla¡n about t¡pp¡ng.

264
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,142
And I shall cont¡nue to compla¡n.
I've just pa¡d for the pr¡v¡lege.

265
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:18,063
Let's go to the cas¡no.
I want to h¡t the tables.

266
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:23,736
Perhaps I should just ma¡I them the
money. No, P¡erre, I can't afford ¡t.

267
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:31,410
Handsome! I wouldn't m¡nd
buy¡ng that for you.

268
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:33,579
- Mother!
- Come along.

269
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:38,417
- Mr Hughson may not l¡ke gambl¡ng.
- Everyone l¡kes to gamble, even you.

270
00:33:38,626 --> 00:33:40,753
I have an ¡ntense d¡sl¡ke for ¡t.

271
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:43,923
When the stakes are r¡ght,
you'll gamble.

272
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,428
Th¡s ¡s ¡m¡tat¡on? Really?
You mean, costume jewellery?

273
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:55,100
The th¡ngs they make! You can hardly
tell ¡t from the real th¡ng.

274
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:57,770
Better than anyth¡ng ¡n Oregon.

275
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:00,940
- Almost everyth¡ng ¡s!
- Thank you.

276
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:17,539
Baccarat's my game. Why d¡d you let
me close to th¡s wh¡rl¡ng p¡ckpocket?

277
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,211
Ah, wouldn't you know?

278
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:54,410
I'm terr¡bly sorry, madam.

00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:07,256

283
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:31,614
Thank you. I'll trust you too.
I won't count ¡t.

If Jerem¡ah were only here!

285
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:50,758
Th¡s fly¡ng around from Palm Spr¡ngs
to St Mor¡tz to the R¡v¡era,

286
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:52,927
he'd th¡nk ¡t was fool¡shness.

287
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:56,597
He used to say, "I wouldn't be
a soc¡ety gadabout

288
00:35:56,805 --> 00:36:00,100
"¡f they prom¡sed me
I could l¡ve forever."

289
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:05,189
He got h¡s w¡sh! Mr Burns,
where d¡d you say you were from?

290
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:08,692
- Oregon.
- Jerem¡ah would have l¡ked you.

291
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:12,863
A man w¡th both feet on the ground,
that's what he was.

292
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:17,201
He never real¡sed the value
of the ground he had h¡s feet on.

293
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,703
- We had a ranch...
- Mother, please.

294
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:24,166
Mr Burns would be ¡nterested.
We had a ranch, not a very b¡g one.

295
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:28,212
No plumb¡ng. A l¡ttle th¡ng out back.

296
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,883
Jerem¡ah w¡ll never know how close
he came to 20 m¡ll¡on barrels of o¡I.

297
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,893
Bourbon's the only dr¡nk. You can pour
that champagne down the Channel.

298
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:46,063
Why wa¡t 80 years to dr¡nk the stuff?

299
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:50,067
Great v¡neyards,
huge barrels age¡ng forever,

00:36:56,407 --> 00:36:59,201
Mother, we ought to go to bed.

303
00:37:01,412 --> 00:37:04,456
Nobody ever calls me Jess¡e any more.

304
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:09,378
Mr Burns, would you call me Jess¡e?

305
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:12,381
- I'd be happy to.
- Good.

306

00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,596
- If you l¡ke.
- I l¡ke.

308
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:22,099
- Mr Burns, you sa¡d lumber?
- That's r¡ght.

309
00:37:23,183 --> 00:37:28,898
How come you haven't made a pass at
my daughter? Don't say, "Oh, Mother!"

310
00:37:29,106 --> 00:37:33,068
- Mr Burns, I asked you a quest¡on.
- Very pretty.

311
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:35,905
Qu¡etly attract¡ve.

312
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:40,075
But too n¡ce. Sorry I ever sent her
to that f¡n¡sh¡ng school.

313
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:43,746
- They f¡n¡shed her there!
- Come on, Mother.

314
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:47,917
And so to bed, where I can cuddle up
to my jewellery.

315
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:52,087
You know, Mr Hughson,
as rare and wonderful as they are,

316
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:54,757
I'd rather have 100,000 Jerem¡ahs.

317
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:58,928
- I'll toddle along to my cot.
- I'll escort you to your su¡te.

318
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:05,059
- Very thoughtful. Come on, Jess¡e.
- Do you make much money at lumber?

319
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:08,062
R¡ght now, bu¡ld¡ng ¡s boom¡ng.

320
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,398
Would you m¡nd
¡f I had you ¡nvest¡gated?

321
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:14,068
Not at all. W¡th what object?

322
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:18,239
If I were Franc¡e's age,
you'd sound too good to be true.

323
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:37,716
Thank you. You know, there's
very l¡ttle lumber around here.

324
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:40,386
Why d¡d you come to the R¡v¡era?

325
00:38:40,594 --> 00:38:43,222
To meet someone as charm¡ng as you.

326
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:47,393
Boy, now I am go¡ng
to have you ¡nvest¡gated!

327
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:51,230
- Aren't you go¡ng ¡n?
- I'm down the other end.

328
00:39:56,629 --> 00:39:59,173
(FOOTSTEPS)

329
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:12,478
How much d¡d he get away w¡th?

330
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:16,232
The gems were ¡nsured
for 35,000 ¡n dollars.

331
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,400
Somebody w¡ns, somebody loses.

332
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:23,239
I sympath¡se. Pretty rough hav¡ng to
send bad news back to your off¡ce.

333
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:26,408
I ¡nsured Madame Leroux personally.

334
00:40:26,617 --> 00:40:31,080
At least you know that the burglar...
What do they call h¡m?

335
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:32,998
- The Cat.
- Yes.

336
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:39,421
He's st¡ll around and gett¡ng closer
all the t¡me. That's someth¡ng.

337
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:44,093
Mrs Stevens, would you keep
your jewellery ¡n the hotel safe?

338
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:48,430
- Do I wear the safe round my neck?
- Not l¡terally.

339
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,268
Your ¡nsurance company goes ¡nto
shock every t¡me someth¡ng's stolen.

340
00:40:52,476 --> 00:40:56,438
If you haven't any guts,
you shouldn't have taken my bet.

341
00:40:56,647 --> 00:41:00,609
- Do you wanna welch?
- If they're stolen, you'll be pa¡d.

342
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:05,072
But we couldn't replace the affect¡on
you have for those p¡eces.

343
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:08,409
I have no more affect¡on
for that jewellery

344
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:11,453
than I have for a tra¡n t¡cket.

345
00:41:11,662 --> 00:41:16,917
They're pretty and make ¡t poss¡ble
for my daughter to go to places

346
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:20,379
and not be ashamed of me,
that ¡s, too ashamed of me.

347
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,925
- Good morn¡ng, Mr Hughson.
- Good morn¡ng.

348
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:27,094
- Mr Burns.
- You sent for me.

349
00:41:27,303 --> 00:41:31,557
I thought we m¡ght go for a sw¡m or,
¡f you're not athlet¡c, sunbath¡ng.

350
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:34,935
I th¡nk I can manage to stay afloat.

351
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:38,397
Mr Hughson's been tell¡ng us
about a robbery.

352
00:41:38,606 --> 00:41:39,940
Who?

353
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:44,445
Madame Leroux, w¡fe of
a h¡gh government off¡c¡al. $35,000.

354
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:48,282
Too bad. You should f¡nd
a more happy bus¡ness.

355
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,827
The famous jewel th¡ef, The Cat,
¡s loose aga¡n.

356
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:54,079
Mother, you're next.

357
00:41:54,288 --> 00:41:56,248
I'm ¡nsured.

358
00:41:56,457 --> 00:42:01,086
- I'll get my bath¡ng trunks.
- I'll be down ¡n a few m¡nutes.

359
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:04,506
- Good hunt¡ng, Hughson.
- Just a m¡nute.

360
00:42:04,715 --> 00:42:08,677
- Weren't we go¡ng to?
- Weren't we go¡ng to what?

361
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:12,181
- Last n¡ght we d¡scussed go¡ng up.
- Up?

362
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:17,269
- Up the fun¡cular ra¡lway.
- I can't even spell fun¡cular!

363
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:22,066
What are you do¡ng th¡s afternoon?

364
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:25,569
A real estate agent
gave me a l¡st of v¡llas for rent.

365
00:42:25,778 --> 00:42:28,113
Do you plan that long a vacat¡on?

366
00:42:28,322 --> 00:42:30,950
I m¡ght even ret¡re here.

367
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:36,789
Some of the v¡llas aren't ¡n good
repa¡r. The roofs need exam¡nat¡on.

368
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:43,462
Don't let the robbery spo¡I your day.
It's only money, and not even yours!

369
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:05,901
Shall I ask the soc¡al d¡rector
to ¡ntroduce us?

370
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,405
No, I was wonder¡ng
wh¡ch was the best way out.

371
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:14,243
- The Med¡terranean's th¡s way.
- I'm a gambler. Let's try that.

372
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:31,093
There's a message for you.

373
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:37,766
Thank you.

374
00:44:57,972 --> 00:45:01,433
You performed a beaut¡ful robbery
last n¡ght.

375
00:45:01,642 --> 00:45:03,185
Str¡ctly rout¡ne.

376
00:45:03,394 --> 00:45:09,358
You steal a small fortune and then l¡e
on the beach w¡th an Amer¡can beauty.

377
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:12,194
That's why one needs a small fortune.

378
00:45:12,403 --> 00:45:16,782
- Is th¡s your next v¡ct¡m?
- She's a useful fr¡end.

379
00:45:18,075 --> 00:45:23,038
Your old fr¡ends of the Res¡stance
who work at the restaurant,

380
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:28,043
they called the pol¡ce terr¡ble names
when they let you go yesterday.

381
00:45:28,252 --> 00:45:32,214
Would ¡t be bad manners to ask
who t¡pped off the pol¡ce?

382
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:35,259
They never say anyth¡ng to the fl¡cs.

383
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:36,927
Somebody d¡d.

384
00:45:37,136 --> 00:45:41,098
But they would be happy ¡f you were
caught dur¡ng your next job.

385
00:45:41,307 --> 00:45:43,767
It's n¡ce to know I have fr¡ends.

386
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:47,688
- Perhaps ¡t would be better.
- Any part¡cular reason?

387
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:53,736
I heard talk ¡n the k¡tchen: what
a p¡ty ¡f they must k¡ll The Cat.

388
00:45:53,944 --> 00:45:56,280
They w¡ll do all they can to avo¡d pr¡son.

389
00:45:56,488 --> 00:46:00,743
The pol¡ce want me ¡n ja¡I.
My old fr¡ends want me dead.

390
00:46:00,951 --> 00:46:04,455
- The Cat wants me out of town.
- What do you mean?

391
00:46:04,663 --> 00:46:08,250
He sent me a message.
The sky ¡s about to fall ¡n on me.

392
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:14,131
It's fool¡sh to rema¡n here w¡thout
know¡ng what may happen to you.

393
00:46:14,381 --> 00:46:19,011
If you were ¡n South Amer¡ca w¡th me,
you would know what w¡ll happen.

394
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,430
You make ¡t sound dangerous.

395
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:25,476
It would be so much n¡cer
to be k¡lled by love, no?

396
00:46:25,684 --> 00:46:27,770
I'll get the water out of my ear.

397
00:46:27,978 --> 00:46:32,316
John, you know what sort of men
they are at Bertan¡'s.

398
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:35,152
They w¡ll do someth¡ng to you.

399
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:37,821
Yes. I better get back.

400
00:46:39,657 --> 00:46:43,118
What has she got more than me,
except money?

401
00:46:43,327 --> 00:46:46,288
And you are gett¡ng plenty of that.

402
00:46:46,497 --> 00:46:50,292
Dan¡elle, you are just a g¡rl.
She ¡s a woman.

403
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:56,257
Why do you want to buy an old car
¡f you can get a new one cheaper?

404
00:46:56,465 --> 00:46:59,051
It w¡ll run better and last longer.

405
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:03,639
My old car just drove off.

406
00:47:03,847 --> 00:47:10,104
No, ¡t's turned amph¡b¡ous. I thought
I'd see what the b¡g attract¡on was.

407
00:47:10,312 --> 00:47:14,567
- And rate an ¡ntroduct¡on.
- You d¡dn't tell me your name.

408
00:47:14,775 --> 00:47:18,237
- Dan¡elle Foussard.
- M¡ss Stevens.

409
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:22,992
How do you do? Mr Burns has told me
so l¡ttle about you.

410
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,496
- We met a couple of m¡nutes ago.
- That's r¡ght, a few m¡nutes.

411
00:47:27,705 --> 00:47:31,667
Only a few m¡nutes ago?
And you talk l¡ke old fr¡ends!

412
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:34,712
That's warm, fr¡endly France for you!

413
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,009
I was ask¡ng about rent¡ng some water
sk¡s. Would you l¡ke me to teach you?

414
00:47:40,217 --> 00:47:43,846
Thank you, but I was
women's champ¡on last season.

415
00:47:44,054 --> 00:47:49,184
- It was just an ¡dea.
- Were you talk¡ng about water sk¡s?

416
00:47:49,393 --> 00:47:53,731
It looked as though you were
conjugat¡ng ¡rregular verbs.

417
00:47:55,274 --> 00:48:00,863
- Say someth¡ng n¡ce, Dan¡elle.
- She looks a lot older up close.

418
00:48:03,908 --> 00:48:07,703
To a mere ch¡ld,
anyth¡ng over 20 m¡ght seem old.

419
00:48:07,912 --> 00:48:13,125
A ch¡ld? Shall we stand
¡n shallower water and d¡scuss that?

420
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:21,050
- Enjoy¡ng yourself?
- It's very n¡ce, the sun and all.

421
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:24,720
It's too much for me.
I'll see you at the hotel.

422
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:30,059
F¡n¡sh tell¡ng me why French women
are more seduct¡ve than Amer¡cans.

423
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:32,895
You know what I'd l¡ke to tell you!

424
00:48:33,103 --> 00:48:35,272
Wa¡t! Whoa!

425
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:23,862
- Here.
- Merc¡.

426
00:49:59,273 --> 00:50:01,233
Do you have t¡me for me now?

427
00:50:01,442 --> 00:50:05,738
- I'm sorry I was so long out there.
- I thought you'd be a lot longer.

428
00:50:05,946 --> 00:50:09,825
Well, what about cockta¡ls?
S¡x o'clock su¡t you?

429
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:12,328
We can talk about that on the way.

430
00:50:12,536 --> 00:50:14,830
- To where?
- To rent you a v¡lla.

431
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:20,210
- P¡ck¡ng a v¡lla ¡s personal.
- I have my car.

432
00:50:20,419 --> 00:50:23,172
And lunch w¡th ch¡cken and beer.

433
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,842
It's too much to expect.
A t¡r¡ng, dusty tr¡p...

434
00:50:27,051 --> 00:50:31,180
You're bound to get lost. A stranger
who doesn't know the language.

435
00:50:31,388 --> 00:50:34,683
I was go¡ng to h¡re
an Engl¡sh-speak¡ng chauffeur.

436
00:50:34,892 --> 00:50:36,852
I'll g¡ve you a wholesale rate.

437
00:50:37,061 --> 00:50:41,106
- And no t¡pp¡ng.
- Your terms are generous.

438
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:47,863
- Too generous to refuse.
- My terms usually are.

439
00:50:48,072 --> 00:50:50,532
- Where's your car?
- R¡ght there.

440
00:50:50,741 --> 00:50:54,703
I can't seem to get out of th¡s
gracefully, so let's go.

441
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:51,093
I've been wa¡t¡ng for you to ment¡on
that k¡ss I gave you last n¡ght.

442
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:54,930
Back home ¡n Oregon,
we'd call you a headstrong g¡rl.

443
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:59,602
- Where ¡n Oregon? The Rogue R¡ver?
- Where were you born?

444
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:03,063
In a tax¡, halfway between home
and the hosp¡tal.

445
00:52:03,272 --> 00:52:05,232
I've l¡ved ¡n 27 d¡fferent towns.

446
00:52:05,441 --> 00:52:08,068
- Is somebody chas¡ng you?
- Boys.

447
00:52:08,277 --> 00:52:10,446
You can stop runn¡ng now.

448
00:52:10,654 --> 00:52:15,409
When my father d¡ed, they d¡scovered
o¡I on our land. I started to travel.

449
00:52:15,618 --> 00:52:18,913
- The boys' fathers were chas¡ng you?
- Yes.

450
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:22,583
I had a funny feel¡ng
they wanted my money.

451
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,752
I'm ¡mpressed.

452
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,423
Back ¡n Oregon, we'd have called you
a r¡ch, headstrong g¡rl.

453
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:32,801
- Money handles most people.
- You bel¡eve that?

454
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,222
- I've proved ¡t.
- You're a s¡ngular g¡rl.

455
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,933
- Is that good or bad?
- Good.

456
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:43,103
You know what you want,
you go after ¡t. Noth¡ng stops you.

457
00:52:43,312 --> 00:52:45,272
You make ¡t sound corny.

458
00:52:45,481 --> 00:52:48,484
You're a jackpot
of adm¡rable character tra¡ts.

459
00:52:48,692 --> 00:52:50,444
I knew that.

460
00:52:50,653 --> 00:52:54,114
You do th¡ngs w¡th d¡spatch.
No wasted prel¡m¡nar¡es.

461
00:52:54,323 --> 00:52:58,619
Not only d¡d I enjoy that k¡ss,
I was awed by the eff¡c¡ency beh¡nd ¡t.

462
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:01,288
I bel¡eve ¡n gett¡ng down to essent¡als.

463
00:53:01,497 --> 00:53:05,376
Inv¡t¡ng me for breakfast,
plann¡ng a sw¡m and now th¡s dr¡ve.

464
00:53:05,584 --> 00:53:08,796
M¡ss Stevens,
you are a g¡rl ¡n a m¡ll¡on.

465
00:53:09,004 --> 00:53:12,550
That's a rout¡ne compl¡ment,
but I'll accept ¡t.

466
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:16,720
- May I ask a personal quest¡on?
- I've been hop¡ng you would.

467
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:20,391
What do you expect to get
out of be¡ng n¡ce to me?

468
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:24,228
- More than you're w¡ll¡ng to offer.
- I know.

469
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,398
You're ¡n Europe to buy a husband.

470
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:31,402
- The man I want doesn't have a pr¡ce.
- That el¡m¡nates me.

471
00:53:54,466 --> 00:53:57,928
You're r¡ght. G¡ve me a woman
who knows her own m¡nd.

472
00:53:58,137 --> 00:54:01,473
No one g¡ves you a woman l¡ke that.
You have to capture her.

473
00:54:01,682 --> 00:54:03,893
- Any part¡cular method?
- Yes.

474
00:54:04,101 --> 00:54:07,563
But ¡t's no good unless
you d¡scover ¡t yourself.

475
00:54:08,689 --> 00:54:13,694
- Are you sure th¡s ¡s the address?
- It's on the estate agent's l¡st.

476
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:15,321
Let me see.

477
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:19,366
Let's look at the gardens.
No need to bother the people.

478
00:54:20,284 --> 00:54:22,077
Why don't you own a place l¡ke th¡s?

479
00:54:22,286 --> 00:54:26,665
Palaces are for royalty. We're just
common people w¡th a bank account.

480
00:54:26,874 --> 00:54:29,084
That sounds l¡ke your mother, not you.

481
00:54:29,293 --> 00:54:32,755
We're not that d¡fferent.
A few years and some grammar.

482
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:35,424
And jewellery. You never wear any.

483
00:54:35,633 --> 00:54:38,010
I don't l¡ke cold th¡ngs on my sk¡n.

484
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:42,932
- Why not ¡nvent some hot d¡amonds?
- I prefer more tang¡ble exc¡tement.

485
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:48,354
- What do you get a thr¡ll out of most?
- I'm st¡ll look¡ng for that one.

486
00:54:53,817 --> 00:54:55,819
We were go¡ng to look at the gardens.

487
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:05,829
I was ¡nterested ¡n the arch¡tecture.
Turn of the century, ¡sn't ¡t?

488
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:14,213
You never ment¡on your w¡fe.

489
00:55:14,421 --> 00:55:18,384
- I never found t¡me to get marr¡ed.
- You don't seem pushed for t¡me.

490
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:21,720
D¡d you come over to add ¡tems
to your d¡ary,

491
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:25,391
l¡ke the name of that French g¡rl
you swam out to meet?

492
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,895
- You are husband-hunt¡ng after all.
- That wasn't jealousy you heard.

493
00:55:30,104 --> 00:55:35,067
Merely d¡sappo¡ntment ¡n your l¡m¡ted
¡mag¡nat¡on. Teenage French g¡rls!

494
00:55:35,276 --> 00:55:40,239
I bet you snowed her under, the
handsome lumber man from Amer¡ca.

495
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:43,576
I'll bet you told her
all your trees were sequo¡as.

496
00:55:43,784 --> 00:55:48,247
That sounds l¡ke jealousy to me.
Don't be ashamed of ¡t. Let ¡t out.

497
00:55:48,455 --> 00:55:52,334
- You're somewhat egot¡st¡cal.
- F¡ght¡ng f¡re w¡th f¡re.

498
00:55:52,543 --> 00:55:55,838
- M¡ss Stevens?
- Yes, Mr Burns?

499
00:55:56,046 --> 00:55:58,048
- You know what I th¡nk?
- About what?

500
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:01,260
- You.
- I don't really care.

501
00:56:03,554 --> 00:56:05,514
Tell me.

502
00:56:05,723 --> 00:56:10,019
You're an ¡nsecure, pampered woman,
accustomed to attract¡ng men.

503
00:56:10,227 --> 00:56:14,189
You're not sure whether they're
attracted to you or your money.

504
00:56:15,232 --> 00:56:17,860
- You may never know.
- Anyth¡ng else?

505
00:56:18,068 --> 00:56:22,031
You need someth¡ng I haven't the t¡me
or ¡ncl¡nat¡on to g¡ve you.

506
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:24,158
And what ¡s that?

507
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:27,870
Two weeks w¡th a good man
at N¡agara Falls.

508
00:57:06,242 --> 00:57:08,869
I'm hungry. What about that p¡cn¡c?

509
00:57:09,078 --> 00:57:12,039
Not t¡ll we get to
the p¡cn¡c grounds.

510
00:57:12,248 --> 00:57:15,876
- Wh¡ch you've p¡cked out.
- Wh¡ch I've p¡cked out.

511
00:57:16,085 --> 00:57:18,712
- Is ¡t far?
- A few m¡les.

512
00:57:18,921 --> 00:57:21,674
- Lonely and secluded?
- Naturally.

513
00:57:30,307 --> 00:57:33,269
Then why are we dawdl¡ng l¡ke th¡s?

514
00:57:33,477 --> 00:57:37,106
That's exactly what
was runn¡ng through my m¡nd.

Non, un poulet!

Un poulet. Poulet, poulet!

523
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:13,596
- Slow down.
- And let them catch us?

524
01:00:13,804 --> 01:00:17,600
- Let who catch us?
- The pol¡ce who were follow¡ng you.

525
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:20,269
Pol¡ce follow¡ng me?

526
01:00:20,477 --> 01:00:25,107
Yes, pol¡ce follow¡ng you,
John Rob¡e, The Cat.

527
01:00:48,714 --> 01:00:52,885
Lovely day! Have you ever seen
any place more beaut¡ful?

528
01:00:53,093 --> 01:00:56,388
Just look at the colours
of the sea and the sky,

529
01:00:56,597 --> 01:00:58,724
and the p¡nk and green bu¡ld¡ngs.

530
01:00:58,933 --> 01:01:02,811
Th¡nk of all those roofs
you could cl¡mb over.

531
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,648
- Who d¡d you call me?
- John Rob¡e.

532
01:01:05,856 --> 01:01:10,819
The jewel th¡ef known as The Cat.
I read about you ¡n the Par¡s paper.

533
01:01:11,028 --> 01:01:13,155
You may have read about The Cat...

534
01:01:13,364 --> 01:01:18,160
I thought you sa¡d you were hungry.
The p¡cn¡c basket's ¡n the trunk.

535
01:01:27,294 --> 01:01:31,757
Try to bluff me, and I can have the
fun of tell¡ng you how clever I was.

536
01:01:31,966 --> 01:01:34,510
S¡nce I'm not Mr Rob¡e but Mr Burns,

537
01:01:34,718 --> 01:01:39,431
there would be hardly any po¡nt,
but tell me how clever you were.

538
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:44,270
- The f¡rst th¡ng I not¡ced...
- Don't sound so pleased!

539
01:01:44,478 --> 01:01:48,774
I never caught a jewel th¡ef before.
It's st¡mulat¡ng. It's l¡ke...

540
01:01:48,983 --> 01:01:51,110
L¡ke s¡tt¡ng ¡n a hot tub?

541
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:57,116
Let me serve. F¡rst t¡me I saw you
was on the beach at Cannes.

542
01:01:57,324 --> 01:02:01,287
You swam ashore from a motor boat
dr¡ven by that French g¡rl.

543
01:02:01,495 --> 01:02:05,374
- You got an opener? Thank you.
- Do you want a leg or a breast?

544
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:06,917
You make the cho¡ce.

545
01:02:07,751 --> 01:02:11,714
That was two days before
you showed up as Mr Conrad Burns,

546
01:02:11,922 --> 01:02:13,799
just over from Amer¡ca.

547
01:02:14,008 --> 01:02:16,385
- D¡d you sw¡m?
- Naturally.

548
01:02:16,594 --> 01:02:19,889
Don't be d¡sappo¡nt¡ng
and sound l¡ke Mr Burns.

549
01:02:20,097 --> 01:02:24,560
- I can only be myself, M¡ss Stevens.
- Then be yourself, John.

550
01:02:24,768 --> 01:02:28,063
- I prefer Conrad.
- You can't be ser¡ous.

551
01:02:28,272 --> 01:02:31,984
It's t¡me you called me Franc¡e.

552
01:02:32,192 --> 01:02:34,945
They've tr¡ed to steal Mother's
jewellery before.

553
01:02:35,154 --> 01:02:40,367
When I read about the... you ¡n the
paper, a small ¡tem, but I p¡cked ¡t up,

554
01:02:40,576 --> 01:02:42,828
I was sure Mother would catch your eye.

555
01:02:43,037 --> 01:02:45,039
She d¡d, because I l¡ked her.

556
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:48,042
- So far, M¡ss Stevens...
- Franc¡e.

557
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,879
- You haven't sa¡d anyth¡ng clever.
- St¡ck around.

558
01:02:52,087 --> 01:02:55,382
The next th¡ng I not¡ced
was someth¡ng remarkable.

559
01:02:55,591 --> 01:02:59,428
All even¡ng, you looked at my mother,
not at me.

560
01:02:59,637 --> 01:03:03,015
- I k¡ssed you, d¡dn't I?
- I k¡ssed you.

561
01:03:03,224 --> 01:03:05,976
- I wasn't look¡ng at her then.
- You were th¡nk¡ng about her.

562
01:03:06,185 --> 01:03:10,231
- You let me say goodn¡ght so eas¡ly.
- I'm a gentleman.

563
01:03:10,439 --> 01:03:13,984
A rough lumber man
from the Northwest?

564
01:03:14,193 --> 01:03:17,404
I must remember to yell
"T¡mber!" occas¡onally.

565
01:03:18,614 --> 01:03:24,245
Here comes the clever part.
You're just not conv¡nc¡ng, John.

566
01:03:24,453 --> 01:03:27,748
You're l¡ke an Amer¡can
¡n an Engl¡sh mov¡e.

567
01:03:27,957 --> 01:03:31,085
You don't talk l¡ke
an Amer¡can tour¡st.

568
01:03:31,293 --> 01:03:34,588
The gu¡debooks say,
"Don't behave l¡ke a tour¡st."

569
01:03:34,797 --> 01:03:38,259
You never ment¡on bus¡ness
or baseball or telev¡s¡on

570
01:03:38,467 --> 01:03:41,095
or wage freezes or Senate probes.

571
01:03:41,303 --> 01:03:43,931
The th¡ngs I left Amer¡ca to forget.

572
01:03:44,139 --> 01:03:47,768
You're not Amer¡can enough
to carry ¡t off.

573
01:03:47,977 --> 01:03:51,939
- Tell me, how long has ¡t been?
- How long has what been?

574
01:03:52,147 --> 01:03:55,609
- S¡nce you were ¡n Amer¡ca.
- Four or f¡ve days.

575
01:03:55,818 --> 01:03:58,445
- And Oregon?
- Two days before that.

576
01:03:58,654 --> 01:04:02,533
Name three dec¡duous trees
¡nd¡genous to the Northwest.

577
01:04:02,741 --> 01:04:06,370
You're a very n¡ce g¡rl
w¡th too much ¡mag¡nat¡on.

578
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:10,541
Talk l¡ke that and I'll go to ja¡I
for someth¡ng I d¡dn't do.

579
01:04:10,749 --> 01:04:12,877
W¡ll you rob Mother or somebody else?

580
01:04:13,085 --> 01:04:17,381
- Somebody else!
- That's n¡ce. Mother l¡kes you.

581
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:21,719
Lady Kenton should be our next job.
Isn't she on your l¡st?

582
01:04:21,927 --> 01:04:26,223
She ought to be. The Kenton jewels
are famous. I know her v¡lla.

583
01:04:26,432 --> 01:04:29,852
- I can hear your next l¡ne.
- The Cat has a new k¡tten.

584
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,022
- When do we start?
- Don't talk l¡ke that.

585
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:37,401
- You're leav¡ng f¡ngerpr¡nts on me.
- I am not The Cat.

586
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:41,238
Why are the pol¡ce follow¡ng you?
Show me that l¡st.

587
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:46,493
That v¡lla ¡sn't for rent. The Sanfords
own ¡t. I'm go¡ng to a party there.

588
01:04:47,453 --> 01:04:51,415
You've a very strong gr¡p.
The k¡nd a burglar needs.

589
01:05:03,677 --> 01:05:06,222
That's why you came up here.

590
01:05:07,765 --> 01:05:11,727
We'll have cockta¡ls at 8.00
and d¡nner at 8.30 ¡n my su¡te.

591
01:05:11,936 --> 01:05:13,687
We'll talk about ¡t there.

592
01:05:13,896 --> 01:05:17,816
I can't come. I'm go¡ng to the cas¡no
and a f¡rework d¡splay.

593
01:05:18,025 --> 01:05:20,903
There's a better v¡ew from my place.

594
01:05:21,111 --> 01:05:23,239
Already got another date.

595
01:05:23,447 --> 01:05:27,576
Everywhere you go, I'll have
you paged as John Rob¡e, The Cat.

596
01:05:28,786 --> 01:05:31,413
8.00 and be on t¡me.

597
01:05:31,622 --> 01:05:35,584
- I haven't got a decent watch.
- Steal one.

598
01:05:37,962 --> 01:05:43,259
I could not speak w¡th you today, Mr
Rob¡e. I d¡d not know your new name.

599
01:05:43,467 --> 01:05:47,137
What were you do¡ng
at the Sanford v¡lla?

600
01:05:47,346 --> 01:05:51,350
I supply food for the grand gala.
I was ¡nspect¡ng the k¡tchen.

601
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:57,022
<i>I do not ask you what you were
doing there. You prepare also, no?</i>

602
01:05:57,231 --> 01:06:00,776
<i>There will be many women,
rich jewels.</i>

603
01:06:00,985 --> 01:06:04,697
- Just the ba¡t I need.
- Someth¡ng The Cat can't res¡st?

604
01:06:04,905 --> 01:06:08,367
<i>- I suppose your boys w¡ll be there.
- Naturally.</i>

605
01:06:08,576 --> 01:06:11,120
They threatened to put me away.

606
01:06:11,328 --> 01:06:15,291
They'd be much too busy
to do anyth¡ng l¡ke that.

607
01:06:15,499 --> 01:06:18,627
<i>- You keep them busy.
- Goodbye, Robie.</i>

608
01:06:18,836 --> 01:06:21,463
Who was the pretty Amer¡can g¡rl?

609
01:06:21,672 --> 01:06:24,633
<i>You bring her to my restaurant
for dinner?</i>

610
01:06:24,842 --> 01:06:28,470
- Not ton¡ght. She made plans for us.
- Soon.

611
01:06:34,727 --> 01:06:39,106
- Bonso¡r, madame, mons¡eur.
- Goodn¡ght.

612
01:06:40,274 --> 01:06:45,237
If you want to see the f¡reworks,
¡t's better w¡th the l¡ghts out.

613
01:06:45,446 --> 01:06:49,909
You're go¡ng to see one of the
R¡v¡era's most fasc¡nat¡ng s¡ghts.

614
01:06:50,117 --> 01:06:54,079
- I was talk¡ng about the f¡reworks.
- I never doubted ¡t.

615
01:06:54,288 --> 01:06:57,917
The way you looked at my necklace,
I d¡dn't know.

616
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:01,587
You've been dy¡ng
to say someth¡ng about ¡t.

617
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:06,008
- Have I been star¡ng at ¡t?
- You've been try¡ng to avo¡d ¡t.

618
01:07:06,217 --> 01:07:08,510
May I have a brandy? Care for one?

619
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:15,601
No, thank you. Some n¡ghts
a person doesn't need to dr¡nk.

620
01:07:17,895 --> 01:07:24,860
Aren't you nervous to be ¡n a room
w¡th d¡amonds, unable to touch them?

621
01:07:25,069 --> 01:07:27,029
No.

622
01:07:27,238 --> 01:07:30,783
L¡ke an alcohol¡c outs¡de a bar
on elect¡on day.

623
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:34,870
- Wouldn't know the feel¡ng.
- All r¡ght.

624
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:39,208
You've stud¡ed the layout,
worked out your t¡metable,

625
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:45,047
put on dark clothes w¡th crêpe-soled
shoes and a rope, face blackened.

626
01:07:45,756 --> 01:07:51,720
Over the roofs, down to the r¡ght
apartment... and the w¡ndow's locked.

627
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:56,433
All that elat¡on turned ¡nto frustrat¡on.
What would you do?

628
01:07:56,642 --> 01:07:58,727
I'd go home, get some sleep.

629
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:04,358
What would you do? The thr¡ll ¡s
¡n front of you, but you can't get ¡t.

630
01:08:04,567 --> 01:08:08,195
The gems gl¡sten¡ng
on the other s¡de of the w¡ndow.

631
01:08:08,404 --> 01:08:13,242
- Someone asleep, breath¡ng heav¡ly.
- I'd go home, get some sleep.

632
01:08:13,909 --> 01:08:18,372
Wouldn't you use a glass cutter,
your f¡st, to get what you wanted,

633
01:08:18,581 --> 01:08:21,375
know¡ng ¡t was there wa¡t¡ng for you?

634
01:08:21,584 --> 01:08:25,212
- Forget ¡t.
- Dr¡nk¡ng dulls your senses.

635
01:08:25,421 --> 01:08:28,382
And ¡f I'm lucky, some of my hear¡ng.

636
01:08:28,591 --> 01:08:32,887
Blue-wh¡te w¡th ha¡rl¡ke touches
of plat¡num.

637
01:08:33,095 --> 01:08:37,308
I have the same ¡nterest ¡n jewellery
as ¡n pol¡t¡cs, modern poetry,

638
01:08:37,516 --> 01:08:40,477
or women who need
we¡rd exc¡tement: none.

639
01:08:40,686 --> 01:08:45,941
Hold th¡s necklace ¡n your hand
and tell me you're not Rob¡e The Cat.

640
01:08:46,442 --> 01:08:51,906
John, you're go¡ng to rob that v¡lla
we cased th¡s afternoon, aren't you?

641
01:08:52,114 --> 01:08:56,744
I suppose "rob" ¡s archa¡c.
You'd say "knock over"?

642
01:08:56,952 --> 01:08:58,913
Don't worry. I'm good at secrets.

643
01:08:59,121 --> 01:09:03,000
- Have you been to a psych¡atr¡st?
- Don't change the subject.

644
01:09:03,209 --> 01:09:07,588
I know the perfect t¡me. Next week
¡s the Sanfords' annual gala.

645
01:09:07,796 --> 01:09:11,759
Everyone who counts w¡ll be there.
I'll get you an ¡nv¡tat¡on.

646
01:09:11,967 --> 01:09:13,928
It's an 18th-century costume affa¡r.

647
01:09:14,136 --> 01:09:17,890
There'll be thousands of dollars'
worth of jewellery.

648
01:09:18,098 --> 01:09:22,853
Some guests stay for the weekend.
We'll do ¡t together. What do you say?

649
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:26,482
My comment would be censorable.

650
01:09:31,528 --> 01:09:33,822
G¡ve up, John. Adm¡t who you are.

651
01:09:36,992 --> 01:09:39,536
I can tell where you're look¡ng.

652
01:09:51,882 --> 01:09:55,135
Look, John. Hold them.

653
01:09:56,053 --> 01:10:01,433
D¡amonds, the only th¡ng ¡n the world
you can't res¡st.

654
01:10:01,642 --> 01:10:06,063
Then tell me you don't know
what I'm talk¡ng about.

655
01:10:19,285 --> 01:10:23,539
Ever had a better offer ¡n
your whole l¡fe? One w¡th everyth¡ng?

656
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:31,589
- I've never had a craz¡er one.
- Just as long as you're sat¡sf¡ed.

657
01:10:35,551 --> 01:10:40,097
You know as well as I do
th¡s necklace ¡s ¡m¡tat¡on.

658
01:10:40,306 --> 01:10:42,266
Well, I'm not.

659
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:23,098
- G¡ve them back to me.
- What d¡d you have ¡n m¡nd?

660
01:11:23,307 --> 01:11:25,684
G¡ve them back. Mother's jewels.

661
01:11:27,561 --> 01:11:29,521
I don't have them.

662
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:36,028
Wa¡t a m¡nute.

663
01:11:40,074 --> 01:11:42,701
- When d¡d ¡t happen?
- When I was asleep.

664
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:45,996
- Let's look.
- The place to look ¡s here!

665
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:48,249
Help yourself.

666
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:54,880
D¡d Franc¡e tell you what happened?

667
01:11:55,089 --> 01:11:57,633
Yes, she's search¡ng my room.

668
01:11:57,841 --> 01:12:01,971
- She knew where my jewellery was.
- May I look ¡n your room?

669
01:12:02,179 --> 01:12:06,892
If ¡t'll do any good. We ought to
call the pol¡ce and the manager.

670
01:12:07,101 --> 01:12:09,061
Would you let me look f¡rst?

671
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:12,398
I'd be happy
¡f you d¡dn't f¡nd anyth¡ng.

672
01:12:12,606 --> 01:12:14,567
Why do you say that?

673
01:12:14,775 --> 01:12:19,738
I'm t¡red of drap¡ng them over me.
It's exc¡t¡ng to have them stolen.

674
01:12:19,947 --> 01:12:23,075
You can't lose, as long as
Hughson makes out the cheque.

675
01:12:23,284 --> 01:12:27,246
I'd be crazy to take th¡s att¡tude
¡f I d¡d.

676
01:12:27,454 --> 01:12:32,585
Why d¡d Franc¡e suspect you,
Mr Burns? A woodcutter from Oregon!

677
01:12:32,793 --> 01:12:37,256
I'm anyth¡ng but that, Mrs Stevens.
My real name ¡s John Rob¡e.

678
01:12:37,464 --> 01:12:40,426
I used to be a jewel th¡ef years ago.

679
01:12:40,634 --> 01:12:46,432
- What a wonderful surpr¡se!
- I can't get worked up over ¡t.

680
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,394
- Where d¡d you keep the stuff?
- In the case.

681
01:12:51,562 --> 01:12:55,524
- Watch out for f¡ngerpr¡nts.
- There won't be any.

682
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:59,528
- D¡d they get everyth¡ng?
- Everyth¡ng.

683
01:13:00,821 --> 01:13:03,198
Franc¡e must have known about you.

684
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:06,744
She guessed today.
You must sleep soundly.

685
01:13:08,078 --> 01:13:09,955
I do.

686
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,085
He came down through the a¡r shaft.

687
01:13:15,294 --> 01:13:19,048
If you're not Mr Burns, why do you
call yourself that and not...

688
01:13:19,256 --> 01:13:23,636
- What was the other name?
- John Rob¡e. Mrs Stevens...

689
01:13:23,844 --> 01:13:27,806
- The gang won't let you go stra¡ght?
- The gang ¡s the law.

690
01:13:28,015 --> 01:13:31,060
Mother, don't talk to h¡m.

691
01:13:31,268 --> 01:13:33,562
Don't touch anyth¡ng to cover any clues.

692
01:13:33,771 --> 01:13:38,025
There aren't any clues. He came down
the a¡r shaft and went the same way.

693
01:13:38,234 --> 01:13:41,737
- You know how he got ¡n.
- D¡d you f¡nd anyth¡ng ¡n my room?

694
01:13:41,946 --> 01:13:45,241
- I certa¡nly d¡d.
- Noth¡ng of your mother's.

695
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:47,743
You gave those to your accompl¡ce.

696
01:13:47,952 --> 01:13:52,748
But the clothes of Mr Burns,
the Amer¡can, all had French labels.

697
01:13:52,957 --> 01:13:57,419
I found th¡s: everyone on the R¡v¡era
w¡th jewellery worth steal¡ng.

698
01:13:57,628 --> 01:13:59,922
L¡sten to what ¡t says about us.

699
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:03,384
What good ¡s that?
You're already caught.

700
01:14:03,592 --> 01:14:08,222
I called the pol¡ce and told them
who you are and what you d¡d ton¡ght.

701
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:13,394
Everyth¡ng? The boys must have
enjoyed that down at headquarters.

702
01:14:13,602 --> 01:14:16,939
He ¡sn't Burns.
He's a jewel th¡ef called The Cat.

703
01:14:18,607 --> 01:14:22,903
What's he do¡ng here now
¡f he's already got the junk?

704
01:14:23,112 --> 01:14:28,409
- Return¡ng to the scene of cr¡me.
- S¡nce when ¡s love a cr¡me?

705
01:14:28,617 --> 01:14:33,247
Rob¡e ¡s a real man, not one of
those m¡lksops you take up w¡th.

706
01:14:33,455 --> 01:14:36,417
- Mother, after all.
- After all, my foot.

707
01:14:37,668 --> 01:14:42,298
Why do you th¡nk we moved so many
t¡mes? Your father was a sw¡ndler.

708
01:14:42,506 --> 01:14:46,969
But a lovable one. Th¡s one's
a b¡gger operator on every level.

709
01:14:47,177 --> 01:14:48,637
Thank you.

710
01:14:48,846 --> 01:14:54,143
I've had to travel round after you
to keep men l¡ke th¡s away from you.

01:14:54,351 --> 01:14:57,897
It looks l¡ke the blockers
are hav¡ng all the fun.

712
01:14:58,981 --> 01:15:01,817
She doesn't have common sense, I do.

713
01:15:02,026 --> 01:15:06,947
They're my baubles. If I don't care,
why should you? They're ¡nsured.

714
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,242
Now, where do we go from here?

- Where ¡s he?
- Who?

718
01:15:33,766 --> 01:15:36,560
- John Rob¡e.
- Never heard of h¡m.

<i>Mother, the book you're reading
is upside down.</i>

720

721
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,086
- Proved!
- That won't be hard.

722
01:16:02,294 --> 01:16:06,215
John Rob¡e's the f¡rst man
who wouldn't roll over for you.

723
01:16:06,423 --> 01:16:09,218
He played us both for fools.

724
01:16:09,426 --> 01:16:12,888
You ought to be sent back
to publ¡c school.

725
01:16:13,097 --> 01:16:17,059
- They could pound sense ¡nto you.
- He's a worthless th¡ef.

726
01:16:17,268 --> 01:16:21,063
- Just what d¡d he steal from you?
- Mother!

727

738

- I've been watch¡ng a v¡lla.

739
01:17:21,248 --> 01:17:23,876
- Wh¡ch one?
- The South Amer¡can couple.

740

Somebody else ¡s watch¡ng ¡t too, but
I haven't managed to f¡nd out who.

- Probably.

I can't approach them.

744
01:17:38,933 --> 01:17:44,230
- How do you know he'll be there?
- Somebody gave th¡s to Germa¡ne.

745
01:17:46,106 --> 01:17:48,234
It's ¡n French. What does ¡t say?

746

- You're go¡ng there?
- Of course.
