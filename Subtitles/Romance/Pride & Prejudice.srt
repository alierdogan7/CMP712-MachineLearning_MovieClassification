[woman]
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

5
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:58,370
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you
not want to know who has taken it?.

6
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,296
As you wish to tell me, my dear,
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

7
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,891
Kitty, what have I told you
about listening at the door?.

8
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:15,776
There's a Mr Bingley
arrived from the North.

9
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,048
- Five thousand a year!
- Really?.

10
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,812
- He's single!
- Who's single?.

11
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:23,546
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

12
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,523
How can that possibly affect them?.

13
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:27,755
Mr Bennet,
how can you be so tiresome?.

14
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:30,188
You know he must marry one of them.

15
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,317
That is his design in settling here?.

16
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,632
You must go and visit him at once.

17
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:37,616
Good heavens. People.

18
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:43,857
For we may not visit if you do not,
as you well know, Mr Bennet.

19
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:48,060
- Are you listening?. You never listen.
- You must, Papa! At once!

20
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,699
There's no need. I already have.

21
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:53,241
- You have?.
- When?.

22
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:56,793
Oh, Mr Bennet,
how can you tease me so?.

23
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,305
Have you no compassion
for my poor nerves?.

24
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,911
You mistake me, my dear.
I have the highest respect for them.

25
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:06,241
They've been my constant companions
these twenty years.

26
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:07,420
Papa!

27
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:08,811
- Is he amiable?.
- Who?.

28
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:11,222
- Is he handsome?.
- He's sure to be.

29
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:14,443
With 5,000 a year,
it would not matter if he had warts.

00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:15,972
Who's got warts?.

31
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:19,200
I will consent to
his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

32
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,415
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?.
- I believe so.

33
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,301
- Mr Bennet!
- [Kitty] I have to have your muslin!

34
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,211
- I'll lend you my green slippers!
- They were mine.

35
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,943
- I'll do your mending for a week.
- I'll retrim your new bonnet.

00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:36,839

[girl] I think one of
my toes just came off.

If every man does not end the evening

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,148
then I'm no judge of beauty.

43
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,197
- Or men.
- No, they are far too easy to judge.

44
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,875
They're not all bad.

45
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:53,753
Humourless poppycocks,
in my limited experience.

someone will catch your eye,

and then you'll have
to watch your tongue.

How good of you to come.

49
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:22,881
Which of the painted peacocks
is our Mr Bingley?.

00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:25,678
He's on the right.
On the left is his sister.

51
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:30,614
- The person with the quizzical brow?.
- That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

52
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:35,034
- He looks miserable, poor soul.
- He may be, but poor he is not.

Tell me.

54
00:06:36,473 --> 00:06:39,037
1 0,000 a year,
and he owns half of Derbyshire.

55
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:41,172
The miserable half.

Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

It is a pleasure. I have two others,
but they're already dancing.

I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

And may I introduce Mr Darcy

How do you like it
here in Hertfordshire?.

00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:14,445
Very much.

67
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,767
The library at Netherfield,
I've heard, is one of the finest.

68
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:22,177
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good
reader. I prefer being out of doors.

69
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:24,863
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

70
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,322
And I'm not suggesting
you can't read out of doors.

71
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:32,073
[Jane] I wish I read more, but there
seem to be so many other things to do.

72
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:34,471
[Bingley] That's exactly what I meant.

73
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:41,185
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe
what we're about to tell you.

00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:43,898
- Tell me!
- She's going to take the veil.

- The regiment are coming!
- Officers?.

00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,605
They're going to be stationed
the whole winter, right here.

77
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:52,221
- Officers?.
- As far as the eye can see.

00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:02,143
[Mrs Bennet] Oh, look.
Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:21,255
- Do you dance, Mr Darcy?.
- Not if I can help it.

81
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:42,362
I didn't know you were coming
to see me. What's the matter?.

82
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:47,933
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
are we not, Mr Darcy?.

83
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,303
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

84
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,856
You were dancing
with the only handsome girl.

00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:55,884
She is the most beautiful creature
I have ever beheld.

86
00:09:56,127 --> 00:10:00,207
- But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.
- Perfectly tolerable.

87
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:04,488
Not handsome enough to tempt me. Return
to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

[Darcy]
You're wasting your time with me.

89
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:15,159
Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he
liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

90
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:16,644
Precisely.

91
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:19,405
I wouldn't dance with him
for all of Derbyshire,

00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:21,854

- I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.
- How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:50,114
My daughter Jane
is a splendid dancer, is she not?.

98
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:52,175
She is indeed.

99
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:56,180
Your friend Miss Lucas
is a most amusing young woman.

100
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:58,023
Oh, yes, I adore her.

101
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,110
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.
- Mama!

102
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,652
Oh, but Lizzie
would never admit that she's plain.

103
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,868
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered
the beauty of the county.

104
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,078
Mama, please!

105
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,184
When she was 1 5, a gentleman
was so much in love with her,

106
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,485
I was sure he would make her an offer.

107
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,047
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

108
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,467
And that put paid to it.

109
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,851
I wonder who discovered the power
of poetry in driving away love.

110
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:28,254
- I thought poetry was the food of love.
- Of a fine, stout love.

111
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:31,769
But if it is only a vague inclination,
one poor sonnet will kill it.

112
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,864
So, what do you recommend
to encourage affection?.

113
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:41,462
Dancing. Even if one's partner
is barely tolerable.

114
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:06,404
[hushed] Mr Bingley is just what
a young man ought to be.

115
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,924
- Sensible, good-humoured...
- Handsome, conveniently rich...

116
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,823
Marriage should not be driven
by thoughts of money.

117
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:15,117
Only deep love
will persuade me to marry.

118
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:19,693
- Which is why I'll end up an old maid.
- Do you really believe he liked me?.

119
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,242
He danced with you most of the night,
and stared at you the rest.

120
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,297
I give you leave to like him.
You've liked many stupider.

121
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,608
You're a great deal too apt
to like people in general.

122
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,683
All the world
is good in your eyes.

123
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:34,967
Not his friend. I still can't believe
what he said about you.

124
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:37,469
Mr Darcy?.

125
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:42,165
I'd more easily forgive his vanity
had he not wounded mine.

126
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:45,054
But no matter.
I doubt we shall ever speak again.

127
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:17,351
[Mrs Bennet] He danced with Miss Lucas.

128
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,318
[Mr Bennet] We were all there, dear.

129
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:21,509
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

130
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:24,296
There's a spinster
in the making and no mistake.

131
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,019
The fourth with a Miss King
of little standing,

132
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:29,230
and the fifth again with Jane.

133
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:32,520
If he had any compassion,
he would've sprained his ankle.

134
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,854
The way you carry on,

135
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,924
you'd think our girls look forward
to a grand inheritance.

136
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,303
When you die,
which may be very soon,

137
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:43,764
they will be left without a roof over
their head nor a penny to their name.

138
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,388
- Please, it's ten in the morning.
- A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

139
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:50,911
From Netherfield Hall.

140
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,624
- Praise the Lord. We are saved!
- [laughter]

141
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:59,550
[Mrs Bennet] Make haste, Jane,
make haste. Oh, happy day!

142
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,492
It is from Caroline Bingley.

143
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:08,155
She has invited me to dine with her.

144
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:11,321
- Her brother will be dining out.
- Dining out?.

145
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,390
- Can I take the carriage?.
- Let me see.

146
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:17,062
- It is too far to walk.
- This is unaccountable of him.

147
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,111
Mama, the carriage for Jane?.

148
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:24,544
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

149
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:27,497
[Lizzie & Jane] Horseback!

00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:29,276

151
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:43,991
Lizzie.

152
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:47,349
Now she'll have to stay the night,
exactly as I predicted.

153
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:50,552
Good grief, woman,
your skills in the art of matchmaking

154
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,546
are positively occult.

155
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,072
Though I don't think, Mama,
you can take credit for making it rain.

156
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,140
"My friends will not hear of me
returning home until I am better.

157
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:09,200
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and
a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

158
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:14,331
If Jane does die it will be a comfort
to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

159
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:16,810
People do not die of colds.

160
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:20,221
[Lizzie] But she may perish with the
shame of having such a mother.

161
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,961
I must go to Netherfield at once.

162
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:41,293
Lady Bathurst is redecorating
her ballroom in the French style.

163
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,584
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?.

164
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:49,831
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

165
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:05,127
[Caroline] Good Lord, did you walk here?.

166
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:07,270
I did.

167
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:18,106
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?.
- She's upstairs.

168
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:22,172
Thank you.

169
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:35,892
[Caroline] My goodness, did you
see her hem?. Six inches deep in mud.

170
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:38,205
She looked positively mediaeval.

171
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:42,661
I feel such a terrible imposition.
They're being so kind to me.

172
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:48,153
I don't know who is more pleased at your
being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

173
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:55,549
Thank you for tending
to my sister so diligently.

174
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,957
She's in far better comfort
than at home.

175
00:17:58,183 --> 00:17:59,774
It's a pleasure.

176
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:03,594
I mean, it's not a pleasure
that she's ill. Of course not.

177
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,474
It's a pleasure that she's here,
being ill.

178
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,755
[Mr Bennet]
Not going to be famous, our pig.

179
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:16,089
Black on the back, but not related
to the learned pig of Norwich.

180
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:19,256
- Now that pig is...
- Mr Bennet.

181
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:22,608
It's all going to plan.
He's half in love with her already.

182
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,957
- Who is, blossom?.
- Mr Bingley.

183
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,353
He doesn't mind
that she hasn't a penny.

184
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,676
He has more than enough
for the two of them.

185
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:31,763
- How will we meet them?.
- Easy!

186
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:32,984
Wait for me!

187
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:38,231
[Lydia] You drop something. They
pick it up. And then you're introduced.

188
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:46,703
Officers!

189
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:49,417
[# military march]

190
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:20,800
[Caroline]
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

191
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,993
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

192
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,591
How many letters you must have occasion
to write, Mr Darcy.

193
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:29,527
Letters of business.
How odious I should think them.

194
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:32,446
It is fortunate, then,
they fall to me and not you.

195
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:35,056
Tell your sister I long to see her.

196
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:38,439
- I've already told her once.
- I do dote on her.

197
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:41,720
I was quite in raptures
at her beautiful design for a table.

198
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,999
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures.

199
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,228
I have not room enough
to do them justice.

200
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:50,131
[Bingley]
You young ladies are so accomplished.

201
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,631
- What do you mean?.
- You paint tables, play the piano

202
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:55,203
and embroider cushions.

203
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:58,359
I never heard of a lady,
but people say she's accomplished.

204
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,704
[Darcy]
The word is applied too liberally.

205
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,945
I do not know more than
half a dozen women

206
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,764
- that are truly accomplished.
- [Caroline] Nor l.

207
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,958
Goodness, you must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

208
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,720
- I do.
- Absolutely.

209
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:14,382
She must have a knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing

210
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:17,752
and the modern languages
to deserve the word.

211
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:21,617
And something in her air
and manner of walking.

212
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:24,600
And she must improve her mind
by extensive reading.

213
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:28,339
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing
only six accomplished women.

214
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,711
- I wonder at you knowing any.
- Are you so severe on your own sex?.

215
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:36,161
I never saw such a woman. She would
certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

216
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:41,865
[Caroline] Miss Elizabeth,
let us take a turn about the room.

217
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:02,870
It's refreshing, is it not,
after sitting so long in one attitude?.

218
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,229
It is a small kind of accomplishment,
I suppose.

219
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,535
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?.

220
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,061
You can only have two motives,
and I would interfere with either.

221
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,258
What can he mean?.

222
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:17,507
The surest way to disappoint him
would be to ask him nothing.

223
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:20,361
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

224
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:24,570
Either you are
in each other's confidence

225
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,774
and you have
secret affairs to discuss,

226
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,092
or you are conscious
that your figures

227
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:32,307
appear to the greatest
advantage by walking.

228
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:36,393
If the first,
I should get in your way.

229
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:39,354
If the second,
I can admire you much better from here.

230
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,806
How shall we punish him
for such a speech?.

231
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:45,805
- We could laugh at him.
- No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

232
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:50,463
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy?. And would
you consider pride a fault or a virtue?.

233
00:21:50,753 --> 00:21:53,550
- I couldn't say.
- We're trying to find a fault in you.

234
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,707
I find it hard to forgive
the follies and vices of others,

235
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:58,622
or their offences against me.

236
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:02,135
My good opinion,
once lost, is lost forever.

237
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:07,063
Oh, dear.
I cannot tease you about that.

238
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:09,289
What a shame,
for I dearly love to laugh.

239
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,607
[Caroline] A family trait, I think.

240
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:44,119
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,
a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

241
00:22:44,426 --> 00:22:47,223
Are we to receive every
Bennet in the country?.

242
00:22:49,906 --> 00:22:53,013
What an excellent room you have, sir.

243
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:56,681
Such expensive furnishings.

244
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:59,742
[Mrs Bennet] I do hope
you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

245
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:04,491
Absolutely, I find the country
very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?.

246
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,374
I find it perfectly adequate.

247
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:09,298
Even if society
is a little less varied than in town.

248
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:11,289
Less varied?. Not at all.

249
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:15,313
We dine with four and 20 families
of all shapes and sizes.

250
00:23:15,582 --> 00:23:19,740
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man.

251
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:23,556
And a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

252
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,277
[Lydia] Mr Bingley,
is it true you will hold a ball here?.

253
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,977
A ball?.

254
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:33,570
It would be an excellent way to meet new
friends. You could invite the militia.

255
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,724
- Oh, do hold a ball!
- Kitty!

256
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:38,619
When your sister recovers,
you shall name the day.

257
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:43,094
I think a ball is an irrational way
to gain new acquaintance.

258
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:47,266
It would be better if conversation,
not dancing, were the order of the day.

259
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,386
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

260
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:53,171
Thank you, Mary.

261
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:58,260
What a fine imposing place to be sure,
is it not, my dears?.

262
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:01,645
There's no house
to equal it in the county.

263
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,527
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

264
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:06,378
- There she is.
- I don't know how to thank you.

265
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:09,258
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

266
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:12,445
Thank you for your stimulating company.
Most instructive.

267
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:16,034
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

268
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:20,518
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

269
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:37,114
And then there was one
with great long lashes, like a cow.

270
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,974
Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

271
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:43,395
Just the one, mind.
We're not made of money.

272
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,590
[Mary practises scales]

273
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,498
I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

274
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,381
I've reason to expect
an addition to our family party.

275
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:56,253
[Lizzie] His name's Mr Collins,
the dreaded cousin.

276
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:58,778
- [Charlotte] Who is to inherit?.
- Everything.

277
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:01,690
Even my piano stool
belongs to Mr Collins.

278
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:02,856
When?.

279
00:25:03,088 --> 00:25:05,885
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

280
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:09,197
The estate passes directly to him
and not to us poor females.

281
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:16,543
Mr Collins, at your service.

282
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:29,253
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent potatoes.

283
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:34,207
It's many years since
I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

284
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:38,485
To which fair cousin should I compliment
the excellence of the cooking?.

285
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,092
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

286
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,147
Excellent.

287
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:46,547
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

288
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,225
I'm honoured to have as my patroness
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

289
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:55,923
You've heard of her, I presume?.

290
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:59,888
My small rectory abuts her estate,

291
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:02,648
Rosings Park,
and she often condescends

292
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,320
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

293
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,153
Does she have any family?.

294
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:14,557
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

295
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:16,857
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

296
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:19,952
that her daughter
seemed born to be a duchess,

297
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:25,601
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

298
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:29,451
These kind of compliments
are always acceptable to the ladies,

299
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,758
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

300
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:36,401
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

301
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,975
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

302
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:45,337
Do these attentions proceed
from the impulse of the moment

303
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:47,884
or are they
the result of previous study?.

304
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:50,519
They arise
from what is passing at the time.

305
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:54,873
And though I do sometimes amuse myself
with arranging such little compliments,

306
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:58,533
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

307
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:02,635
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

308
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,786
[Lydia laughs, coughs]

309
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:12,454
After dinner, I thought
I might read to you for an hour or two.

310
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,507
I have with me Fordyce's Sermons

311
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:19,909
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

312
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,310
Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons,
Miss Bennet?.

313
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:33,811
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the
good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

314
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:36,397
a parsonage of no mean size.

315
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:38,606
I have become aware of the fact.

316
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:42,516
It is my avowed hope
that soon I may find a mistress for it.

317
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,971
And I have to inform you
that the eldest Miss Bennet

318
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:49,798
has captured my special attention.

319
00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:52,626
Oh, Mr Collins.

320
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:56,712
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

321
00:27:56,986 --> 00:28:02,813
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
is very soon to be engaged.

322
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:04,383
Engaged.

323
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:06,874
But Miss Lizzie,
next to her in age and beauty,

324
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:10,328
would make anyone an excellent partner.

325
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:14,354
Do not you agree?. Mr Collins?.

326
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:18,704
Indeed. Indeed.

327
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:21,312
A very agreeable alternative.

328
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:38,292
[fiddler plays]

329
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:45,838
[Lizzie] Mr Collins is a man who
makes you despair at the entire sex.

330
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:50,101
- Yours, I believe.
- Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

331
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:53,370
He picked up my handkerchief.
Did you drop yours on purpose?.

332
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:54,977
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

333
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:57,821
- An enchanted lieutenant.
- What are you up to, Liddy?.

334
00:28:58,056 --> 00:29:00,930
- We happened to be looking for ribbon.
- White, for the ball.

335
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:03,582
Shall we all look
for some ribbon together?.

336
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:09,840
- Good afternoon, Mr James.
- Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

337
00:29:10,136 --> 00:29:11,528
I shan't even browse.

338
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:14,300
I can't be trusted.
I have poor taste in ribbons.

339
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:16,901
Only a truly confident man
would admit that.

340
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:18,494
No, it's true.

341
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:21,646
And buckles.
When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

342
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:25,078
- You must be the shame of the regiment.
- The laughing stock.

343
00:29:25,374 --> 00:29:28,248
What do your superiors do with you?.

344
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:33,658
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

345
00:29:34,893 --> 00:29:37,844
- Lizzie, lend me some money.
- You already owe me a fortune.

346
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:42,111
- Allow me to oblige.
- No, Mr Wickham, please...

347
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,583
I insist.

348
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,564
- [Lizzie] I pity the French.
- [wickham] So do l.

349
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,296
- [Jane] Look, Mr Bingley.
- [Lydia] Mr Bingley!

350
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:00,585
[Bingley]
I was just on my way to your house.

351
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,724
How do you like
my ribbons for your ball?.

352
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:07,193
- Very beautiful.
- She is. Look, she's blooming.

353
00:30:07,448 --> 00:30:08,961
Oh, Lydia.

354
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:12,548
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
He is a credit to his profession.

355
00:30:12,807 --> 00:30:15,914
[Jane] You can't invite people
to other people's balls.

356
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,623
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

357
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:23,004
If you'll excuse me,
ladies, enjoy the day.

358
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:28,715
[Lizzie] Do you plan to go
to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?.

359
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:34,129
Perhaps. How long
has Mr Darcy been a guest there?.

360
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:36,190
About a month.

361
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:41,568
Forgive me, but are you
acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?.

362
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:45,886
Indeed, I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

363
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:50,749
You may well be surprised,
given our cold greeting this afternoon.

364
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,824
I hope your plans in favour
of Meryton will not be affected

365
00:30:57,082 --> 00:31:00,852
- by your relations with the gentleman.
- It is not for me to be driven away.

366
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:05,744
If he wishes to avoid seeing me,
he must go, not l.

367
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,392
I must ask, what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?.

368
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,551
My father managed his estate.

369
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,791
We grew up together, Darcy and l.

370
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,635
His father treated me like a second son,
loved me like a son.

371
00:31:25,998 --> 00:31:28,287
We were both with him the day he died.

372
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:32,023
With his last breath,

373
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:35,188
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

374
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,815
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the Church.

375
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:42,183
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

376
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:45,072
- But why?.
- Jealousy.

377
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:49,518
His father...

378
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:52,629
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

379
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:56,242
- How cruel.
- So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

380
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:59,968
Too lowly even to be noticed.

381
00:32:06,672 --> 00:32:08,572
[hums tune]

382
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:15,313
- Breathe in!
- I can't anymore. You're hurting.

383
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:19,634
Betsy.

384
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:22,264
Betsy!

385
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,228
- There must've been a misunderstanding.
- Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

386
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:40,848
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?.

387
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:44,214
I will discover the truth
from Mr Bingley this evening.

388
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:46,641
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

389
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:49,001
Till he does,
I hope never to encounter him.

390
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:51,360
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

391
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:53,605
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

392
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:57,320
And, let us hope,
a rather more willing dancer.

393
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:04,134
[man] There they are, look.

394
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:07,296
- [lady] Oh, yes.
- [man] Billy.

395
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,724
[man] Jane Martin is here.

396
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:44,841
May I say what an immense pleasure
it is to see you again.

397
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,040
- Mrs Bennet.
- Miss Bingley.

398
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:48,227
Charming.

399
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:52,763
I'm so pleased you're here.

400
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:55,035
So am l.

401
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:59,920
And how are you?. Miss Elizabeth?.
Are you looking for someone?.

402
00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:04,416
No, not at all, I was just admiring
the general splendour.

403
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:08,191
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.
- Good.

404
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:20,285
[Mrs Bennet] You might have passed
a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

405
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:24,069
[Mrs Bennet] I've never met a
more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

406
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,664
Did you see how he dotes on her?.

407
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:31,282
[Mrs Bennet] Dear Jane,
always doing what's best for her family.

408
00:34:31,614 --> 00:34:33,283
[orchestra plays]

409
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,036
- Charlotte!
- Lizzie!

410
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:54,719
- Have you seen Mr Wickham?.
- No. Perhaps he's through here.

411
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:10,611
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here.
Apparently, he's been detained.

412
00:35:10,928 --> 00:35:13,957
Detained where?. He must be here.

413
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:18,172
- There you are.
- Mr Collins.

414
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:21,710
Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth.

415
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:25,809
Oh, I did not think you danced,
Mr Collins.

416
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:30,322
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman.

417
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:33,790
Several people, her Ladyship
included, have complimented me

418
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:37,461
on my lightness of foot.

419
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:05,590
[Jane] Apparently, your Mr Wickham has
been called on some business to town.

420
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:12,691
Dancing is of little consequence
to me, but it does...

421
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:16,300
...but it does afford
the opportunity to lavish...

422
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,280
-... upon one's partner attentions...
- [Jane] My informer tells me...

423
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,298
...that he would be less inclined
to be engaged, were it not for...

424
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,695
...the presence
of a certain gentleman.

425
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,858
[Collins] Which is my primary object.

426
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:36,715
[Lizzie]
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

427
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:39,676
[Collins]
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

428
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:42,283
to remain close to you
throughout the evening.

429
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,446
May I have the next dance,
Miss Elizabeth?.

430
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:00,461
You may.

431
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:14,080
- Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?.
- I dare say you will find him amiable.

432
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:19,052
It would be most inconvenient since I've
sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

433
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:27,108
[# solo violin dance]

434
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:37,120
- [Lizzie] I love this dance.
- [Darcy] lndeed. Most invigorating.

435
00:37:41,189 --> 00:37:43,478
It is your turn to say something,
Mr Darcy.

436
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:46,348
I talked about the dance.

437
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:51,093
Now you ought to remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples.

438
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:55,190
I'm perfectly happy to oblige.
What would you like most to hear?.

439
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:57,601
That reply will do for present.

440
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,764
[Lizzie]
Perhaps by and by I may observe

441
00:38:03,026 --> 00:38:05,977
that private balls
are much pleasanter than public ones.

442
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:11,496
For now, we may remain silent.

443
00:38:18,984 --> 00:38:21,858
[Darcy]
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?.

444
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:25,714
No. No, I prefer to be
unsociable and taciturn.

445
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:32,846
Makes it all so much more enjoyable,
don't you think?.

446
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:38,870
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?.

447
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:44,765
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

448
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,773
It's a great opportunity
to meet new people.

449
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:53,307
When you met us, we'd just had the
pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

450
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:59,144
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy
manners, he's sure of making friends.

451
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:01,983
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less so.

452
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:07,581
He's been so unfortunate as to lose
your friendship. That is irreversible?.

453
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:11,785
- It is. Why do you ask such a question?.
- To make out your character.

454
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:14,346
- What have you discovered?.
- Very little.

455
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:17,919
I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

456
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:21,701
I hope to afford you more clarity
in the future.

457
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,199
[chattering]

458
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:09,205
- Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?.
- I believe so.

459
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,119
I must make myself known to him.

460
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:14,048
He's a nephew of my patroness,
Lady Catherine.

461
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,041
He will consider it an impertinence.

462
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:19,653
Mr Darcy.

463
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:21,866
Mr Darcy.

464
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:27,435
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

465
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:30,487
What interesting relatives you have.

466
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:44,864
[sings]

467
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,815
Mary, dear,
you've delighted us long enough.

468
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:54,230
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

469
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,724
[Bingley]...since I was a child,
and then she died.

470
00:40:59,962 --> 00:41:01,553
I have a beautiful grey.

471
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:05,373
Of course, Caroline's
a much better rider than l, of course.

472
00:41:09,282 --> 00:41:13,362
Oh, yes. We fully expect
a most advantageous marriage.

473
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:18,448
And my Jane, marrying so grand,
must throw her sisters in the way.

474
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:44,497
Clearly my family are seeing who can
expose themselves to the most ridicule.

475
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:48,485
- At least Bingley has not noticed.
- No.

476
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,018
- I think he likes her very much.
- But does she like him?.

477
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:56,123
Few of us are secure enough to be
in love without proper encouragement.

478
00:41:56,396 --> 00:41:58,607
Bingley likes her enormously,

479
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,395
but might not do more
if she does not help him on.

480
00:42:01,636 --> 00:42:05,130
She's just shy. If he cannot
perceive her regard, he is a fool.

481
00:42:05,395 --> 00:42:07,684
We are all fools in love.

482
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:10,712
He does not know
her character as we do.

483
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:13,205
She should move fast
and snap him up.

484
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:16,618
There is plenty of time
for us to get to know him afterwards.

485
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,523
[Caroline] I can't help feeling
that someone's going to produce a piglet

486
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:23,617
and make us chase it.

487
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,621
- Oh, dear!
- I do apologise, sir.

488
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:37,559
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

489
00:42:56,428 --> 00:42:58,484
[lady] Emily, please!

490
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:04,065
Mary, my dear Mary.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

491
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:07,298
- I've been practising all week.
- I know, my dear.

492
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:09,798
[Mary] I hate balls.

493
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,197
Mr Bennet, wake up.

494
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:34,813
[Mrs Bennet]
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

495
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:39,434
Charles, you cannot be serious.

496
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:51,432
We'll have a wedding here in less than
three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

497
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:55,690
Mr Bennet!

498
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,740
Mary, please.

499
00:44:11,578 --> 00:44:13,711
[Mr Bennet] Thank you, Mr Hill.

500
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:33,609
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping,
if it would not trouble you,

501
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:38,208
that I might solicit
a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

502
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:43,819
Oh, certainly,
Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

503
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:48,214
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like
a private audience with your sister.

504
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:52,613
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing
to say to me that anybody need not hear.

505
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:56,580
I desire you will stay where you are.
Everyone else to the drawing room.

506
00:44:56,852 --> 00:44:58,288
- Mr Bennet.
- But...

507
00:44:58,491 --> 00:45:00,702
Now.

508
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:06,199
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!
- Jane.

509
00:45:08,891 --> 00:45:11,765
Papa, stay.

510
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,799
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

511
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:42,387
My attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

512
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:44,897
Almost as soon
as I entered the house,

513
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:49,943
I singled you out
as the companion of my future life.

514
00:45:50,285 --> 00:45:52,772
But before I am run away
with my feelings,

515
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:55,568
perhaps I may state
my reasons for marrying.

516
00:45:55,804 --> 00:45:58,093
Firstly, that it is
the duty of a clergyman

517
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:00,811
to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.

518
00:46:01,044 --> 00:46:04,770
Secondly, I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

519
00:46:05,043 --> 00:46:07,762
And thirdly,
that it is at the urging

520
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:11,341
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine,

521
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,814
that I select a wife.

522
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:16,956
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

523
00:46:17,202 --> 00:46:19,102
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

524
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:22,040
for I am to inherit the estate

525
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:25,232
and such an alliance will surely...

526
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:28,227
...suit everyone.

527
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,595
And now nothing remains but for me to
assure you in the most animated language

528
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:37,243
- of the violence of my affections.
- Mr Collins!

529
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:39,497
And no reproach
on the subject of fortune

530
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:44,071
- will cross my lips once we're married.
- You forget I have given no answer.

531
00:46:44,357 --> 00:46:47,696
Lady Catherine will
thoroughly approve when I speak to her

532
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:52,734
of your modesty, economy
and other amiable qualities.

533
00:46:53,037 --> 00:46:57,426
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

534
00:46:58,676 --> 00:47:02,324
I know ladies
don't seek to seem too eager...

535
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:06,051
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.
You could not make me happy.

536
00:47:06,315 --> 00:47:09,731
And I'm the last woman
in the world who could make you happy.

537
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:14,270
I flatter myself that your refusal
is merely a natural delicacy.

538
00:47:14,554 --> 00:47:17,196
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

539
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:21,436
it is by no means certain another offer
of marriage will ever be made to you.

540
00:47:21,753 --> 00:47:25,092
I must conclude that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense,

541
00:47:25,393 --> 00:47:29,473
according to the usual practice
of elegant females.

542
00:47:29,752 --> 00:47:33,091
I am not the sort of female
to torment a respectable man.

543
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:35,717
Please understand me,
I cannot accept you.

544
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,791
[Lydia & Kitty laugh]

545
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:45,702
Headstrong, foolish child.

546
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:58,947
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this
little hiccup dealt with immediately.

547
00:48:00,188 --> 00:48:03,450
Lizzie. Lizzie!

548
00:48:07,508 --> 00:48:11,510
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

549
00:48:11,827 --> 00:48:15,243
You must come
and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

550
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:17,795
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

551
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:21,405
but she vowed she will not have him,
and now the danger is

552
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,307
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

553
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:28,856
- What am I to do?.
- Well, come and talk to her.

554
00:48:29,145 --> 00:48:30,228
Now!

555
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:45,297
- Tell her you insist they marry.
- Papa, please.

556
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:49,345
[Mrs Bennet] You will have this house
and save your sisters from destitution.

557
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:52,374
- I can't marry him.
- Go and say you've changed your mind.

558
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:54,986
- Think of your family.
- You cannot make me.

559
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,585
Mr Bennet, say something.

560
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:04,526
Your mother insists
upon you marrying Mr Collins.

561
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,340
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

562
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:11,305
From this day onward, you must be
a stranger to one of your parents.

563
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:13,868
Who will maintain you
when your father is dead?.

564
00:49:14,138 --> 00:49:17,709
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

565
00:49:17,977 --> 00:49:20,928
and I will never see you again
if you do.

566
00:49:21,177 --> 00:49:22,690
Thank you, Papa.

567
00:49:26,337 --> 00:49:30,649
[Mrs Bennet] Ungrateful child!
I shall never speak to you again.

568
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:33,463
Not that I take
much pleasure in talking.

569
00:49:34,496 --> 00:49:37,060
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

570
00:49:37,295 --> 00:49:40,092
can have no pleasure
in talking to anybody.

571
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:41,966
Jane!

572
00:49:45,175 --> 00:49:49,022
What's the matter?. Jane?.

573
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:44,592
I don't understand
what would take him from Netherfield.

574
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:46,979
Why does he not know when he'll return?.

575
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:48,289
Read it.

576
00:50:57,205 --> 00:51:01,517
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
and we are scarcely less eager.

577
00:51:01,844 --> 00:51:04,563
I do not think Georgiana Darcy
has her equal for beauty,

578
00:51:04,803 --> 00:51:08,451
elegance and accomplishment.
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

579
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:11,243
Is that not clear enough?.

580
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:14,004
Caroline sees her brother
in love with you

581
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:16,729
and has taken him off
to persuade him otherwise.

582
00:51:16,962 --> 00:51:21,584
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

583
00:51:21,922 --> 00:51:26,234
- It's more likely he does not love me.
- He loves you. Do not give up.

584
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:30,382
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

585
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,979
Iet it be known you are there
and I am sure he will come to you.

586
00:51:43,279 --> 00:51:47,591
Give my love to my sister
and try not to be a burden, dear.
