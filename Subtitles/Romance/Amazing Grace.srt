Go on!

Wilber, you're not well enough.

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,435
[Man] Hey.

14
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,710
I've seen him speak in London.
That's William Wilberforce.

[Whinnies]

16

- Welcome home, sir.
- You're so late!

18
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,471
The mud stole half a day.

19
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,679
But Marianne, look.
I have a surprise for you.

20
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,592
- I hope a pleasant one.
- Wilber. Wilber, is that you?

21
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,151
Oh, it is, half of me. My idiotic body
is playing games with me again.

22
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,039
- I promised we'd make him well.
- Eat something.

23
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,351
Breakfast, perhaps.
Not too early. I'm on holiday.

24
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,557
- Isn't that right, cousin Henry?
- [Chuckles]

25
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,793
Don't you talk to each other? Haven't
you told him he's killing himself?

26
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,918
Now he's with us, he'll be fine.

00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,435
This is your 3 a.m. Dose.

33
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,878
So, cousin, you're waking me up
to give me medicine to help me sleep.

34
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,034
Ah. Now you're taking on the medical
profession, as well as everyone else.

35
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,148
Did you sleep?

36
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,959
Sleep is more exhausting
than being awake.

37
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,230
The laudanum will sharpen your dreams.

38
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,235
It replays my life to mock me and shows
me things I should have done but didn't.

39
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,710
Wilber, Parliament doesn't deserve you.

40
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,190
Your last bill was defeated
because four of your loyal supporters

41
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,512
took free tickets to a comic opera
rather than stay to vote.

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,990
In my dreams,
I turned over their tables.

43
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,990
But you know the worst thing?
I can't sing any more.

44
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,151
You remember how well I used to sing?

45
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,517
Marianne and I will find a way
to restore your voice.

The Romans believed this water

Most pump water I've investigated
works in the opposite direction.

50
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,273
So?

51
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,637
- What was so urgent?
- Did I say it was urgent?

52
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,754
Marianne, are you expecting
someone else?

53
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,314
Inside this building, you will find
the secret of health and happy life.

54
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,072
In a glass of water?

55
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,434
You may have noticed,

56
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,229
since I married Marianne,
I have been a picture of health.

57
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,358
- I'm very happy for you.
- It is almost a scientific fact.

58
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,910
Marriage and health are twins.
Inseparable.

59
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,551
Single men wither away and die
in rooms that smell of feet and armpits.

Henry, what are you babbling on about?

61
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,114
Love, Wilberforce.
Come. Come, we're late.

62
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,397
The water has been here a million years.
How can we be late?

63
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,109
- So, what shall we discuss next?
- I don't know.

64
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,511
The abolition of the slave trade.
How about that?

65
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,912
Marianne, if I'd known you were
so starved of political conversation,

66
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,992
I'd have wrapped up a Tory
and sent him to your home by mail

67
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,151
for you to shout at.

68
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,231
Ah, now, look at that.

69
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,233
Here we are discussing
the abolition of the slave trade

70
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,790
and in walks my husband
with William Wilberforce himself,

71
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,714
the most committed abolitionist
in England and also, of course,

72
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,871
the most unmarried.

73
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,512
Oh. Look over there. It's Marianne.

74
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,240
And who's the charming-looking
woman with her?

75
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,675
- Marianne's here?
- Never mind about her.

76
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,991
Look at the woman she's with.
Barbara Spooner.

77
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,515
Very committed to very many good causes.

78
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,116
And also entirely unmarried.

79
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,073
Marianne, you're outrageous!

80
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,957
I do not need you or anyone else
to find a wife for me!

81
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,629
[Thunder rumbles]

82
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,515
[Man] Carriage! Carriage over here.

83
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,357
- I'll never forgive him.
- I'll never forgive her.

84
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,680
However, Mr Wilberforce,
if we had met in other circumstances,

85
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,196
I would have told you how deeply
I admire your tireless efforts

86
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,557
to force our ridiculous Parliament
to abolish the slave trade.

87
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,315
If you had, I would have changed
the subject and talked about botany.

88
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,835
Botany? Why botany?

89
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,470
Anything but politics.
I'm in Bath to be cured of politics.

90
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,915
Well, I would have been bored by botany.

91
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,914
So, even in other circumstances,
it would have been a disaster.

92
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,712
- Good day to you.
- Good day to you.

93
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,837
- [Chains rattle]
- [Fire crackles]

94
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,072
[Wilberforce] Some simple truths
about this horrendous war

95
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,358
need to be restated for the benefit
of my honourable friends.

96
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,640
Simple fact. We have the rebels
on the anvil and a hammer in our hands.

97
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,789
[Cheering]

98
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,554
There is no question
that our military force

99
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,154
is far superior
to that of the Americans.

100
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,632
But we must distinguish
between force and justice.

101
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,836
Where did this terrier spring from?

102
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,468
I believe he's a Yorkshire terrier,
My Lord.

103
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,949
[Wilberforce]... rather
than able statesmen.

104
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,430
Surely it is time for the fat fellow
and his friends opposite

105
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,797
to make way for others
who consider the good of their country

106
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,838
of greater moment
than their own personal interests.

107
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,558
[Cheering, clamouring]

108
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,508
Doesn't he know what dangers await
anyone who talks sense in this place?

109
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,671
Oh, I think he's equal to the dangers.

110
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,197
My honourable friend suggests
we surrender to the revolutionaries.

111
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,558
Revolution is like a pox.
It spreads from person to person.

112
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,156
I bow to my honourable friend's
superior knowledge and experience

113
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,710
- in all matters regarding the pox.
- [Laughter]

114
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,952
Why would we withdraw from America

115
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
when half of the Americans
are loyal to the Crown?

116
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,595
Less than one in four Americans
are loyal.

117
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,072
If he calls that half, I'd hate to be
his wife and share half his bed.

118
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,559
[Laughter]

119
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,959
[Man] Mr Foreign Secretary.

120
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,192
My honourable and young friend
should explain to the House

121
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,273
the difference between
appeasement and surrender.

122
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,716
- [Man] Hear, hear!
- [Muttering]

123
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,315
The difference between appeasement
and surrender is merely a matter of time

124
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,950
and perhaps 10,000 more young lives

125
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,749
- wasted for no reason.
- [Clamouring]

126
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,709
[Man] Go on.

127
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,952
Two guineas.

128
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,317
Sweet Prospero,
why hast thou forsaken me?

129
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,630
Brave in the House,
but at the table a mouse.

130
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,920
Your Grace, you know these merchant boys
are richer than we are.

131
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,278
[Man] Aye. I have ten guineas left.

132
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,829
So ten it is.

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,150
In or out, Wilberforce?

134
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,717
- A pencil and paper.
- No, no, no.

135
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,474
Brooks's Club house rules. No IOUs.

136
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,349
Amongst gentlemen, perhaps,
but Wilberforce is a tradesman.

137
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,114
You gamble with what you have with you.

138
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,398
Wilberforce, will you take my IOU?

139
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,956
- We split the pot and call it evens.
- To hell with that. Payment in kind.

140
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,475
There's nothing you have
I'd want, Your Grace.

141
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,558
Tarleton, fetch my nigger.

142
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,593
My coach driver.
Go and wake him up and bring him in now.

143
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,673
I bought a nigger in Port of Spain.

144
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,718
He eats better than I do,
so he's strong as an ox.

145
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,917
He'd fetch at least 25 guineas
at the West India Dock.

146
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,355
The game is over.

147
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,077
What's wrong, Wilberforce?

148
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,152
If I hadn't brought the boy to London,

149
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,959
he'd have been worked to death
in a sugar cane field.

150
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,590
I saved his miserable life. There.

151
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,913
I raise the stakes.

152
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,473
Wilberforce? In the game or out?

153
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,116
[Man] Evening.

154
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,558
You act as if
you'd never seen slavery before.

155
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,713
For me it's like arsenic.
Each new tiny dose doubles the effect.

156
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,559
- You're not afraid of Clarence.
- Because he's the son of the king?

157
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,111
So, you want "bloody noses
and cracked crowns"?

158
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,034
- Shakespeare, <i>Henry IV.</i>
- A play about England changing.

159
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,078
- As it will soon change.
- Only if we change it.

160
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,236
You don't believe you and I
could change things?

161
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,994
I would change myself first.

162
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,789
[Men singing]

163
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,510
Do you remember, Billy, at Cambridge

164
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,433
I had a reputation
as something of a singer?

165
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,397
I do remember.

166
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,358
So I think I'm going to go
and sing them a song.

167
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,559
[Men continue singing]

168
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,909
- Silence!
- [Singing continues]

169
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,157
Silence!

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,552
[Singing stops]

171
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,429
You sound like a chorus
of bloody tomcats.

172
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,628
Now, let me introduce you to somebody
who does it properly.

173
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,109
[Scattered applause]

174
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,589
I dedicate this song
to my honourable friend,

175
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,036
- His Grace, the Duke of Clarence.
- [Laughter]

176
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,953
It was written by my old preacher.

177
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,839
He was captain of a slave ship
for 20 years.

178
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,356
He repented his sins
and then he wrote this song.

179
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,639
# <i>Amazing Grace</i>

180
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,511
- # <i>How sweet the sound</i>
- Times are hard for the militant boys!

181
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,515
- # <i>That saved a wretch</i>
- [man shouting]

182
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,549
# <i>Like me</i>

183
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,716
# <i>I once was lost</i>

184
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,830
# <i>But now am found</i>

185
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,031
# <i>Was blind</i>

186
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,192
# <i>But now</i>

187
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,511
# <i>I see</i> #

188
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,910
Dear God, I know this is utterly absurd,

189
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,072
but I feel I have to meet you in secret.

190
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,757
[Man coughing]

191
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,833
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
There is a beggar at the kitchen door.

192
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,551
I would turn him away, sir,
but you insisted I always check.

193
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,313
Just give him breakfast.

194
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,353
Very good, sir.

195
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,674
- Richard?
- Sir?

196
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,393
I know that lying down on the wet grass
is not a normal thing to do.

197
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,358
None of my business, sir.

198
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,511
Truth is, uh...

199
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,155
...l've been even more strange
than usual lately, haven't I?

200
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,833
It's God.

201
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,435
I have 10,000
engagements of state today,

202
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,319
but I would prefer to spend the day
getting a wet arse,

203
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,110
studying dandelions
and marvelling at bloody spiders' webs.

204
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,998
You've found God, sir?

205
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,835
I think he found me.

206
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,195
Do you have any idea
how inconvenient that is,

207
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,079
how idiotic it will sound?

208
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,959
I've a political career
glittering ahead of me

209
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,396
and in my heart I want spiders' webs.

210
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,478
"It is a sad fate for a man to die
too well-known to everybody else

211
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,234
and still unknown to himself."

212
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,470
Francis Bacon.

213
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,234
I don'tjust dust your books, sir.

214
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,555
When I was 15,
I almost ran away with the circus.

215
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,314
They said I could have been an acrobat.

216
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,515
- Good morning, Mr Pitt.
- Morning.

217
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,519
[Man] Excuse me, sir.

218
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,877
You read my letter.

219
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,316
The man who wrote that letter
was not you.

220
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,439
It was written by some wild preacher man
that has gotten into your head.

221
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,591
No.

222
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,913
- So did he reply?
- Who

223
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,198
God. You were going to ask God whether
you should take up politics or religion.

224
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,112
You're always too direct, Billy.

225
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,477
I urgently need to know
where your heart lies, Wilber.

226
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,154
- What's urgent?
- I...

227
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,991
I'm planning to become prime minister.

228
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,596
- [Laughs] Some day.
- No, I mean soon. Very soon.

229
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,396
Thanks to your performances in
the House, Fox and North will resign.

230
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,472
Lord Rockingham
will become prime minister.

231
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,839
Lord Rockingham's health is not good.
When he dies, I will make my move.

232
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,837
- You've worked it all out.
- I want you beside me, Wilber.

233
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,638
All the way.

234
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,075
You've read my letter
but not taken in a word.

235
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,392
I would have you in my government
in whichever capacity you choose.

236
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,634
[Sighs] Billy, no one of our age
has ever taken power.

237
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,828
Which is why we're too young to realise
that certain things are impossible.

238
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,114
So we will do them anyway.

239
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,515
I need an answer, Wilber.

240
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,075
Do you intend to use
your beautiful voice to praise the Lord

241
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,834
or change the world?

242
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,796
[Woman] Here. Cut this, will you?

243
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,238
- [Woman 2] I've got too much to do.
- [Woman 3] You take care of them.

244
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,992
Any more flour?

245
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,152
- [Girl] I can't!
- [Woman 1] Put your elbow into it.

246
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,512
Marjorie, Mr Wilberforce
is on his way down.

247
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,229
[Clucking]

248
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,598
Marjorie, I'm expecting
some people for dinner.

249
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,320
[Whimpers]

250
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,869
Marjorie? Marjorie?

251
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,550
- She's been run off her feet, sir.
- How so?

252
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,076
Well, take today, for example.
You have 25 guests for lunch.

253
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,229
Do I?

254
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,515
[Indistinct chatter]

255
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,112
If you remember, you decided
to reward various volunteers

256
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,034
who worked for some
quite precariously financed charities.

257
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,432
Some brought deserving children.
Others brought less deserving relatives.

258
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,077
- I really should get some sort of...
- Diary, sir. Yes. Or more cooks.

259
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,351
[Man] Go on! Go on!

260
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
Is that the appetiser?

261
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,879
No, that's His Grace,
the Duke of Clarence.

262
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,238
Wilberforce, the Reverend John Ramsay.

263
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,913
Reverend.

264
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,548
Edward Hope.

265
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,280
And Michael Shaw. Both friends.

266
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,989
- This is Olaudah Equiano.
- Mr Equiano. Please.

267
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,113
- You've travelled far to be here?
- No distance would be too great.

268
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,271
- And this is Hannah Moore.
- Mr Wilberforce.

269
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,635
Who has travelled
all the way from Clapham.

270
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,917
Finally, let me introduce
Mr Thomas Clarkson.

271
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,755
Beautiful house. Sweet little rabbit.

272
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,796
It's a hare, actually.

273
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,951
Please.

274
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,997
So come on. Who are they?

275
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,549
Why don't you ask them?

276
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,512
Well, I hope the goose is tender.
She was rather old.

277
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,478
I find the older I get,
the more tender I become.

278
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,916
- [Chuckling]
- [Bird squawks]

279
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,155
So, Miss Moore, you live in Clapham.

280
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,311
I hear it's very tranquil there.

281
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,552
When certain issues are raised
amongst my friends and I,

282
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,950
it is anything but tranquil.

283
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,317
Ah. And, uh, which issues are those?

284
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,916
Issues regarding
the making of a better world.

285
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,957
Better in which way?

286
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,079
If you make the world better in one way,
it becomes better in every way.

287
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,231
Don't you think?

288
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,917
Mr Equiano, what business
brings you to London?

289
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,277
My business in London is you,
Mr Wilberforce.

290
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,671
What? You wish
to discuss something with me?

291
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,479
No. We do not want to talk

292
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,519
because we hear that you are a man
who doesn't believe what he hears

293
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,274
until he sees it with his own eyes.

294
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,195
These are for the legs.

295
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,954
These for the arms.

296
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,109
This is for the neck.

297
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,879
Works like so.

298
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,590
When the slaves leave port in Africa,

299
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,558
they're locked into a space
four foot by 18 inches.

300
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,236
They have no sanitation,
very little food, stagnant water.

301
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,793
Their waste and blood fills the holes
within three days and is never emptied.

302
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,318
These irons and chains are to keep them
from throwing themselves overboard.

303
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,998
The chains are not unlocked until
you reach the plantation in Jamaica.

304
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,436
Around half of the slaves
are dead already.

305
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,552
In the markets, they stuff knotted rope

306
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,678
into the anuses of those who are sick

307
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,957
to disguise the dysentery.

308
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,513
When you reach the plantation,
they put irons to the fire...

309
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,597
...and do this.

310
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,834
To let you know that you no longer
belong to God, but to a man.

311
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,590
Mr Wilberforce, we understand
you're having problems

312
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,593
choosing whether to do the work of God

313
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,433
or the work of a political activist.

314
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,636
We humbly suggest that you can do both.

315
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,871
You planned this.

316
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,429
I've seen the literature
you've been reading.

317
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,558
You've stooped to searching
through my desk?

318
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,952
Sir William Dolben told me you'd asked
to be shown round the East India Docks.

319
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,717
So, you would use my private concerns
for your own political ends.

320
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,553
Yes, exactly that.

321
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,950
The principles of Christianity
lead to action as well as meditation.

322
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,192
Allow me to meditate on it
before I decide on any action.

323
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,035
Just think about this, Wilber.

324
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,510
The slave trade
has 300 MPs in its pocket.

325
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,760
It would be just you against them.

326
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,154
But you could do it.

327
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,356
You would do it.

328
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,075
[Indistinct chatter]

329
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,269
Oh, stop moaning.

330
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,551
[Man] Excuse me, sir.

331
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,198
Do you have a penny
for a boy that went to fight the Yanks

332
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,554
and came back half a man?

333
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,235
Hello, Mr Newton. It's me, William.

334
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,071
Hello, John. How are you?

335
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,676
Hello, John. It's me, Wilber.

336
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,511
I'm here to seek your...

337
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,630
[Wilberforce] The beggar at the door
assures me that I'm now old enough

338
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,109
to call you John.

339
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,558
[Laughs]

340
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,915
You're dressing very simply these days.

341
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,393
I'm a simple man. I try to pretend I am
a monk, but I don't have the willpower.

342
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,916
I'm a monk Mondays, Wednesdays...

343
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,835
When I read your name in the papers,
doing these great things,

344
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,912
I still see a tiny boy
with his hair a mess

345
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,548
and ink on his fingers.

346
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,516
So, what do you want
with an old creature?

347
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,240
I'm here to seek your advice.

348
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,870
When you were a child,
you used to ask God for advice.

349
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,874
Then I grew up. And grew foolish.

350
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,871
And now?

351
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,274
Now... slowly, my faith is returning.

352
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
How slowly?

353
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,357
- No bolts of lightning.
- [Chuckles]

354
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,231
God sometimes does his work
with gentle drizzle, not storms.

355
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,313
Drip... drip... drip.

356
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,391
My friend William Pitt
has declared an interest in me.

357
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,993
William who?

358
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,070
He's offering me a place in the world.

359
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,074
Just make sure you're in the world,
not of the world.

360
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,909
There'd be no escape from power
once I have it.

361
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,595
- I would have to see things through.
- Why wouldn't you?

362
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,473
Are you contemplating
a life of solitude?

363
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,034
Wilber, you have work to do.

364
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,239
Besides, people like you too much

365
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,550
to let you live a life of solitude.

366
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,551
Haven't you chosen solitude?

367
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,919
You, of all people,
should know I can never be alone.

368
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,830
There now.

369
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,594
- There now what?
- You're the reason I came.

370
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,999
You told me that you live
in the company of 20,000 ghosts.

371
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,152
The ghosts of slaves.

372
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,479
I was explaining to a child

373
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,158
why a grown man cowers in a dark corner.

374
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,231
I need you to tell me about them.

375
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,278
I'm not strong enough
to hear my own confession.

376
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,510
- I thought time might have changed you.
- It has. I'm older.

377
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,355
Pitt has asked me
to take them on, the slavers.

378
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,273
I'm the last person
you should come to for advice.

379
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,749
I can't even say the name
of any of my ships

380
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,957
without being back
onboard them in my head.

381
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,069
All I know is 20,000 slaves live
with me in this little church.

382
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,279
- There's still blood on my hands.
- Will you help me, John?

383
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,954
I can't help you.

384
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,908
But do it, Wilber. Do it.

385
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,868
Take them on. Blow their dirty,
filthy ships out of the water.

386
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,600
The planters, sugar barons,

387
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,548
Alderman "Sugar Cane",
the Lord Mayor of London.

388
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,712
Liverpool, Boston, Bristol, New York.

389
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,432
All their streets running
with blood, dysentery, puke!

390
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,229
You won't come away
from those streets clean, Wilber.

391
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,756
You'll get filthy with it,
you'll dream it,

392
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,718
see it in broad daylight.

393
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,158
But do it. For God's sake.

394
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,557
Sir, I have Mr Thomas Clarkson.

395
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,719
Forgive me.
Mr Wilberforce was here a moment ago.

396
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,069
I'd better go and find him.

397
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,751
[Whining]

398
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,519
- [Crashing]
- [Barking]

399
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,992
- Good afternoon.
- Sorry if I alarmed you.

400
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,749
I had this box made up in the
exact dimensions of a slave berth.

401
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,353
I thought you could use it
in your practical demonstrations.

402
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,198
Why did you wait until your butler
had left before you got out of the box?

403
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,914
They all think I'm mad already.

404
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,596
As will most people
in the House of Commons

405
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,479
when I present my bill.

406
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,513
<i>[Man] Wilberforce, conditions in Jamaica</i>

407
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,831
<i>are far more brutal</i>
<i>than I could have imagined.</i>

408
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,028
<i>Many children are scalded to death</i>
<i>by the molten lava.</i>

409
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,433
<i>Others die of exhaustion</i>
<i>or roll into the fires in their sleep.</i>

410
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,230
<i>The result in the morning</i>
<i>is a few pounds of pure, refined sugar.</i>

411
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,755
[Knocking]

412
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,517
- [Groaning]
- Wilberforce, are you all right?

413
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,151
Sit up for me.

414
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,951
Here, drink this.

415
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,637
- What happened?
- I read James's letter from Jamaica.

416
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,190
When I fell asleep,
it was as if I were living inside it.

417
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,668
Perhaps the laudanum
the doctor gave you is badly mixed.

418
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,751
I know the effects of opium, Henry.

419
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,270
- This isn't the medication.
- What, then?

420
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,318
I was chosen for this task and I failed.

421
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,880
Some part of me does not accept
the idea that I've given up.

422
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,918
- I'll dilute this.
- Can you dilute what I feel?

423
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,311
You've given your youth
and your health for this cause.

424
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,392
It's time to let someone else try.

425
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,115
So, Mr Wilberforce...

426
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,669
...I understand you have
an interest in botany.

427
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,593
Botany, Miss Spooner? Whatever gives you
the idea that I might be interested

428
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,069
in something as tedious as botany?

429
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,558
[Snorts and coughs]

430
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,712
Sorry. It's a private joke.

431
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,719
Now, Wilber, I know
you're not interested in botany,

432
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,398
but there's a fascinating creeping ivy
up the far end of the garden.

433
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,597
Barbara, you really must
go and see it too.

434
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,751
Go on.

435
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,317
To irritate them,
let's pretend to argue.

436
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,994
- What about?
- Something we disagree on.

437
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,151
Think of something.

438
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,311
The war in France.

439
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,075
I think we should settle
with Napoleon right now.

440
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,152
So do I. Schools.

441
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,073
I'm a member of your movement
for free education.

442
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,869
I agreed with every word you said
on the Dales factory debate.

443
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,031
You read every word?

444
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,874
- No.
- Neither did I.

445
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,917
[Barbara giggles]

446
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,993
- Gin.
- Replace it in the cities with beer.

447
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,229
Absolutely.

448
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,634
I'm definitely alone
in my opinions about animals.

449
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,633
No. I joined your society
for the prevention of cruelty.

450
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,554
Well, I'm extreme. I have a pet fox,
a pet rat and a crow that can't fly.

451
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,109
I used to have a pet hare,
but it died of kindness.

452
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,078
- [Barbara laughs]
- America.

453
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,994
We must reassess the power
of the collective political process.

454
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,149
Agreed.

455
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,470
Oh, and, of course,
we are agreed on slavery.

456
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,110
I'm against flowers in church.
What do you say to that?

457
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,271
I am for them.

458
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,991
As am I.

459
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,150
I shouldn't talk about the slave trade?

460
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,360
I've spent so many years
talking about it.

461
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,750
So, what are a few more minutes?

462
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,150
When Mr Pitt
first became prime minister,

463
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,438
the two of you were like meteorites
shooting through our imagination.

464
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,434
- Whose imaginations?
- Girls my age.

465
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,591
You stopped taking sugar in your tea?

466
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,399
I wore an abolition badge
made by Josiah Wedgwood.

467
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,357
He was a good friend to us.

468
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,308
And I travelled 30 miles in the rain
to hear Thomas Clarkson speak.

469
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,517
- Did he deafen you?
- He opened my eyes.

470
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,910
- I met the African.
- Equiano.

471
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,914
He came to town with a hundred copies
of his book. They sold in an hour.

472
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,674
- You signed our petitions.
- A hundred times.

473
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,118
A hundred times. Three million names,
a million candles to read them by.

474
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,352
- Must have been so exciting.
- Exciting?

475
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,557
It seemed that every spring
the daffodils came out,

476
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,870
every summer the cherries ripened

477
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,749
and every autumn William Wilberforce
would present his bill to the House.

478
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,876
- And still...
- And still...?

479
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,838
And still, after all the badges,
the petitions,

480
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,797
all the speeches and the bills,

481
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,080
ships full of human souls in chains
sail around the world as cargo!

482
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,519
I'm sorry.

483
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,915
- This is why I shouldn't talk about it.
- I think you should.

484
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,879
There. We've found something
we disagree on.

485
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,273
"Am I not a man
whose soul is drawn to heaven

486
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,637
like water
from the dark well of Africa?"

487
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,199
From Equiano's book.

488
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,273
[Sighs] He was a man like no other.

489
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,593
Please, tell me about him.

490
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,791
It seems to me

491
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,670
that if there is a bad taste
in your mouth, you spit it out.

492
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,393
You don't constantly swallow it back.

493
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,632
<i>[Wilberforce]</i>
<i>Not long after I first met him,</i>

494
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,156
<i>he asked me to come</i>
<i>to the East India Dock.</i>

495
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,118
<i>He said there was a ship I should see.</i>

496
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,669
<i>A ship he knew well.</i>

497
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,398
Mr Equiano.

498
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,790
This way.

499
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,031
Thank you, sir.

500
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,317
- [Woman] Hello.
- [Man] Sweetheart.

501
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,352
They make you lie in this space.

502
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,355
The shackles dislocate
your hip or your shoulder.

503
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,239
You are in pain
all the way around the world.

504
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,671
How long is the journey?

505
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,638
Three weeks, if the weather is good.

506
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,473
For amusement, they sometimes
hang the women from these,

507
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,029
by the ankles, to rape them.

508
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,198
In stormy weather,
they take the very sickest

509
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,353
and throw them into the sea
to lighten the ship's load.

510
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,237
How did you survive?

511
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,632
Your life is a thread.
It breaks or it doesn't break.

512
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,349
Before I travelled in a ship like this,

513
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,752
I was a prince,
in many ways not unlike you.

514
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,109
It was a beautiful day like no other,

515
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,874
the last day I saw my home in Africa.

516
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,151
[Wilberforce] It is with a heavy heart

517
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,754
that I bring to the attention
of this House

518
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,516
a trade which degrades men
to the level of brutes

519
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,198
and insults the highest qualities
of our common nature.

520
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,318
I am speaking of... the slave trade.

521
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,358
[Protesting]

522
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,352
I know that many
of my honourable friends in this House

523
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,353
have interests in the Indies.

524
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,116
Others have investments in plantations.
Others are ship owners.

525
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,716
And I believe them
to be men of humanity.

526
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,350
I believe you all to be men of humanity.

527
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,715
- If the wretchedness of any one
- [clamouring]

528
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,678
Of the many hundreds of slaves
stowed in their ships

529
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,515
- could be brought to view...
- [protests drown out Wilberforce]

530
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,029
Order! Order!

531
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,670
I can hardly believe my ears.

532
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,152
- We can hardly believe your mouth.
- [Laughter]

533
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:06,792
It seems my young friend opposite
has a long-term strategy

534
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,394
to destroy the very nation
that spawned him.

535
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,120
[Shouting]

536
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:18,198
While I was in Virginia losing
my fingers in battle with the Americans,

537
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,909
- he was busy appeasing them.
- [Clamouring]

538
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:28,030
Now he would hand over the riches
of the Indies to the bloody French!

539
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,956
Lf... If we didn't have slaves,
there would be no plantations.

540
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:45,672
And with no plantations, how would we
fill the coffers of the king?

541
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,595
Does my honourable friend

542
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,673
really believe
that if we left off the trade,

543
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:00,278
the French wouldn't immediately step
into our place and reap the rewards?

544
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,396
[Clamouring]

545
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,836
All this food. There's only
a handful of people in there.

546
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,912
He's an optimist. Completely incurable.

547
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,390
Our defeat in the House today
was not unexpected.

548
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,028
But our intention
was to flush out the opposition

549
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,873
and discover how many people
would support us.

550
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,998
Yes, well, we certainly found out
who our friends are.

551
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,230
All 16 of them.

552
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,188
I... I sent a note of thanks
to everyone who voted for us.

553
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,157
How sweet of you.

554
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,709
Some of us know
how to take defeat graciously.

555
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,953
- Something to with with breeding?
- On this occasion, it probably is.

556
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,159
Everything that is said at this meeting
is being taken down for our records.

557
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,073
My friend James Stephen
has agreed to be our secretary.

558
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,355
You were saying?

559
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,719
As you can see, not many MPs
have responded to our invitation.

560
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,509
Indeed, outside my own family,
there is only one: Sir William Dolben.

561
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,353
Sir William, what brings you
to this gathering?

562
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:15,116
I recently took passage from
Sierra Leone aboard a slave ship.

563
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,352
What I saw during those 15 days...

564
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,353
But I believe there are plenty of others
in the House who share your feelings.

565
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,080
- They're just afraid to show it.
- Shame on them!

566
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,836
No shame. No shame. Were I the
representative of a port city,

567
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,074
how could I tell those whom I represent
that I'm voting to end their livelihood?

568
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,595
- Exactly so.
- [All talk at once]

569
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,069
How can human beings be commerce?

570
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,553
- It's exactly this pursuit of lofty...
- Nothing lofty about simple humanity.

571
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,711
Please!

572
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,273
Perhaps we should begin this journey
with the first step.

573
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,750
We are talking about the truth.

574
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,959
So we should hand it out to people.
Drop it from church roofs.

575
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,875
Paint pictures of it. Write songs
about it. Make bloody pies out of it.

576
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,871
[Clarkson] Go on.

577
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,873
There is a slave ship at dock in Tilbury

578
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,395
with twice the slave berths
it is insured for.

579
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,348
I know that for a fact.
But how do we prove it?

580
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,714
Wilber.

581
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,349
- Dear God.
- Well, almost.

582
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,037
I've spent 18 months being torn apart
by you in the House, Mr Wilberforce.

583
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,193
I thought I'd find out
what it feels like to be on your side.

584
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,156
I see you've got plenty of food.
Any of you saints drink?

585
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,069
Well, this one bloody does.

586
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,556
Thank you very much.

587
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,678
Agh!

588
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,071
Not fair! Not fair.

589
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,835
I'm not well. My belly.

590
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,389
What's wrong with your belly?

591
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,912
[Wilberforce] Oh!

592
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,958
Besides, you're prime minister.

593
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,156
It is my ministerial duty
to let you win.

594
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,835
[Laughs] So, what will we do with Fox?

595
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,869
- Put him in a box?
- Let him throw the heavy rocks.

596
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,113
- Provide the shocks.
- Put Lord Tarleton in the stocks.

597
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,516
Oh!

598
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,877
Oh, if the House of Lords could hear
the idiotic way we carry on,

599
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,715
they'd ban anyone under the age of 30
from holding high office ever again.

600
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,557
Well, at least with Fox on board,
the world will know we mean business.

601
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,393
The world doesn't know yet.

602
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,357
Nor will it, not until we're ready.

603
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,952
You were born for this, Wilber.

604
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,111
Sometimes I get giddy.

605
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,316
Why is it you only feel the thorns
in your feet when you stop running?

606
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,109
Is that some sort of heavy-handed
metaphorical advice for me, Mr Pitt?

607
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,396
Yes, I suppose it is.

608
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,236
We must keep going, keep going fast.

609
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,399
[Bell rings]

610
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,955
[Indistinct shouting]

611
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,755
[Sheep bleating]

612
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,749
[Playing classical music]

613
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,598
[Indistinct chatter]

614
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,754
Thank you very much.

615
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,395
Gentlemen, would you stop the music,
please? Thank you.

616
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:51,714
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you have
enjoyed our little tour of the estuary.

617
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,271
But now our sojourn is almost over,
I have a confession to make.

618
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,910
This trip wasn't purely arranged
to reward those MPs

619
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,791
who have supported me in the past year,
nor am I the only sponsor.

620
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,076
- What's he doing?
- Ladies and gentleman,

621
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,438
this is a slave ship. The <i>Madagascar.</i>

622
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,911
It has just returned from the Indies

623
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,950
where it delivered 200 men,
women and children to Jamaica.

624
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,399
When it left Africa,
there were 600 on board.

625
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,509
The rest died of disease or despair.

626
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,433
[Sniffing, moaning]

627
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,832
That smell is the smell of death.

628
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,679
Slow, painful death.

629
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,588
Breathe it in. Breathe it deeply.

630
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,595
Take those handkerchiefs
away from your noses.

631
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,795
There, now.

632
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,032
Remember that smell.

633
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,760
Remember the <i>Madagascar.</i>

634
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,072
Remember that God made men equal.

635
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,957
<i>[Wilberforce] All that winter,</i>
<i>we spread out across the country</i>

636
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,350
<i>gathering evidence for Parliament.</i>

637
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,876
Thomas rode to Bristol,
Liverpool, Plymouth,

638
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,474
<i>talking to men</i>
<i>who'd worked the slave ships,</i>

639
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,200
<i>ships' doctors who'd treated them,</i>

640
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,318
<i>slaves themselves</i>
<i>who'd been whipped and branded.</i>

641
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,313
Equiano published his account
of his years as a slave.

642
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,000
<i>He sold 50,000 copies in two months.</i>

643
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,111
Spare a coin, sir?

644
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,638
<i>Our supporters began to only buy sugar</i>
<i>produced without slaves in India.</i>

645
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,990
Or they stopped using sugar altogether.

646
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,071
It seemed our message was everywhere.

647
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,358
At least now there was hope. Real hope.

648
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,034
We had a year to collect enough evidence

649
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,556
to convince Parliament of our case.

650
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,918
The planters and the ship owners
began to spread rumours about us.

651
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,676
They called us seditious, secretly
working to bring down the government.

652
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,434
Clarkson sat in a coach to Birmingham

653
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,593
and overheard someone claim
that I'd secretly married a slave woman.

654
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,118
But the weight of our hope
made it all seem like glorious infamy.

655
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,272
How long have you been taking laudanum?

656
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,154
I recognise its presence.

657
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:09,115
My illness and my crusade
were born around the same time.

658
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,430
What is your illness?

659
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,278
The doctors tell me it's called colitis.

660
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,637
They don't really understand it,
but I do.

661
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,950
You see, sometimes my stomach

662
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,237
gets bored of being a stomach
and decides it's a sailing ship.

663
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,790
Then my heart gets jealous
and decides it wants to be a see-saw.

664
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,872
And before you know it,
my lungs are arguing with one another

665
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,429
whether to be lungs
or sponges full of seawater.

666
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,670
[Chuckling]

667
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,913
Well, at least that's what I tell
my nieces and nephews.

668
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,150
Marianne tells me you like children.

669
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,711
My poor father almost went mad

670
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,678
when I told him
I'd stopped taking sugar in my tea.

671
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,277
I was 14,

672
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,432
reading your name in the papers,
willing you to win.

673
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,112
I told my friends there was actual
slave blood in every lump of sugar.

674
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,549
Has this been so painful to talk about?

675
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,832
It's only painful to talk about
because we haven't changed anything.

676
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,434
But, unlike the slaves,
I have opium for my pain.
