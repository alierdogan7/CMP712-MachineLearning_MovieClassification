1
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:06,198
(thunder rolls)

2
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:40,529
(retching)

3
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:46,591
(toilet flushing)

4
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,059
(water running)

5
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,094
(engine starts)

6
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:41,027
Woman: Evening, handsome.

7
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,264
Man: Hi, Lucille.
How you've been?

8
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,232
Lucille: Okay.

9
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,959
- Waitress: Evening, Hank.
- Hey, Betty, how's your mama now?

10
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,522
She's good.

11
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,891
Lucille: Here you go.

12
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,657
So...

13
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,597
How you been?

14
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:16,360
- Pretty good, and you?
- Pretty good.

15
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,724
How's Sonny?

16
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,557
He's all right, I guess.

17
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:30,497
(humming)

18
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,123
(knock on door)

19
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,326
Vera, how are you doing?

20
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,230
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm good.

21
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,288
Here.

22
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,190
It's all right.

23
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:47,162
- You want a drink?
- Oh yeah, thanks hon.

24
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,858
Sonny: Wild Turkey.

25
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,662
Vera: I'm sore,
so go easy, darling.

26
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:01,960
Yes ma'am.

27
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,656
(panting)

28
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,697
- Thanks, Vera.
- You're welcome.

29
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:47,027
Yeah.

30
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,395
What's the matter, hon?
You look so sad.

31
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,265
Sonny: I'm fine.

32
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:13,822
Hey?

33
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,822
You wanna get something to eat?

34
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,497
- Talk?
- Take care, Sonny.

35
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,727
(folk music playing)

36
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,560
Morning, Pop.

37
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,395
This shit's cold.
I'm gonna get some more.

38
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:41,698
Pop: What the hell are
those niggers doing out there?

39
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,564
I said something to you.
Did you hear me?

40
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,422
Yeah.

41
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,659
Damn porch monkeys.
Be moving in here soon.

42
00:08:56,167 --> 00:09:00,429
Sitting next to me...
watching my TV.

43
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,163
There was a time
when they knew their place.

44
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,428
Wasn't none of this
mixing going on.

45
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,265
Your mother,
she hated them niggers, too.

46
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,991
Tell them to get
the hell off my property.

47
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,292
- You put that thing down.
- Boy: We came by to see Sonny.

48
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,299
I don't give a damn
who you come by to see.

49
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,060
Get them out of here
right now.

50
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,621
Hank: They're your buddies.
Tell them to get out of here.

51
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,065
What are you standing there for?

52
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,662
You watch your ass, all right?

53
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,123
(TV playing)

54
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,722
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.

55
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,330
- Hank: Be careful walking around.
- Yeah, yeah.

56
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,825
(TV playing)

57
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,527
Man:
You see these two boys here?

58
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,523
They're my sons.

59
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:49,427
They were on my property.

60
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,932
No need to be scared of no little boys.
They ain't come to hurt you.

61
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,091
No need to be letting off no shotgun
to tell them to leave, either.

62
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,231
You understand?

63
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,329
Then keep 'em off my property.

64
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:06,195
They're friends to your son, okay?
He invited them here.

65
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,358
They ain't trespassing,
they ain't hurting nobody.

66
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:13,661
Man: Next time you wanna play cowboy,
I'm over here all the time.

67
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,792
Well, you keep them
off my property.

68
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:19,264
- I think you heard me, sir.
- I think you heard me too.

69
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,425
All right?

70
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:23,298
Come on boys, let's go.

71
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,632
Aw, shit!

72
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,360
- You're all right, Dappa.
- Yeah, I'm all right.

73
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,490
- You're sure?
- Yeah. It was loose.

74
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:51,589
Yeah.

75
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:56,464
Did you see what you did, Sonny?

76
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,897
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It was my mistake.

77
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,865
- Yeah, it was.
- It won't happen next time.

78
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,930
Let's just keep going
till we get it right.

79
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,057
(laughter)

80
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,564
That's none of your business.

81
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,531
- (more laughter)
- Woman: Woo!

82
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:21,565
I'm surprised you're
talking like that to me.

83
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:24,895
- You being a woman, you know?
- I'm a liberated woman.

84
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:26,160
Better watch out,
Georgia Ann,

85
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,392
Tommy's gonna sue you
for sexual harassment.

86
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:29,625
Georgia Ann:
Oh, that's okay.

87
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,956
Booter, how you doing?

88
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,031
Just give me the $2.50, Sonny.

89
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,327
I got it, Booter.

90
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,754
- You keep the rest of it.
- Thanks, Mr. Grotowski.

91
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,831
Hank: Just like I said,
no more mistakes, all right?

92
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,696
I wanna make damn sure nobody
makes any mistakes, especially you.

93
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:03,926
So when it gets time for us to do it...

94
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,166
you can't mess up.

95
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,127
That goes for me too,
and the rest of them.

96
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:18,327
You ain't no different then us,
you can't screw it up.

97
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,326
- (Dappa mumbles)
- Yeah.

98
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,763
- That's Hank's boy.
- Georgia Ann: It's in the genes.

99
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,094
Yeah, but he's a boy.

100
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,826
- Yes, he is.
- He will be a man tomorrow.

101
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,060
Man: In England, they give
the guy a party the night before.

102
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,456
They call it the Monster's Ball.

103
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:44,128
They don't want no lawyer, no preacher,
or anything like that around...

104
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,995
So, it's just you and me.

105
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:52,964
We can't think about what he did
or anything else about him.

106
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,999
It's a job.
We have to do our job right.

107
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,762
- (buzz)
- (gate opens)

108
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,089
Man: I've been drawing a lot.
What about you?

109
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,962
Boy: Yeah.

110
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,958
Look here,
we ain't got a lot of time.

111
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,031
I'm going to give you
all my drawings...

112
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,559
all my clothes.

113
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:09,997
When you get older,

114
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,790
they may fit you and you may
want to wear them.

115
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,164
I'm not gonna
see you again after this?

116
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,892
No.

117
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,330
Why?

118
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,493
- 'Cause I'm a bad man.
- Who says?

119
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,226
I do.

120
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,557
But I want you to know something.

121
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,065
What?

122
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:36,796
You ain't me.

123
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:40,628
- Yes I am.
- No, you're not.

124
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,224
You're everything
that's good about me.

125
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,198
You're the best of what I am,
that's what you are.

126
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:52,858
This man you see sitting
here today, you ain't.

127
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,856
Hey, baby.
You look nice, today.

128
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,865
You always look nice.

129
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,524
Tyrell, did you tell your daddy
what you won at school?

130
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,031
Oh yeah, right.

131
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,759
My drawing's getting used
for the school magazine cover.

132
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,799
- You know what I did?
- What did you do?

133
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:20,889
Go on, just tell him.
Don't be playing no guessing games.

134
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:22,432
Tyrell:
I made a picture of you...

135
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,431
sitting alone...

136
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:26,226
in jail.

137
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,929
The theme was solitude.

138
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:37,626
Way to go, Ty. Way to go.
Put it there, boy.

139
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,760
Not too bad.

140
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:52,255
What's going on with the car?

141
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,930
It's leaking radiator fluid.

142
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,126
Take it in right away.
Have them check the hoses.

143
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,825
The car get too hot,
you're gonna be in trouble.

144
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,993
The house?

145
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,099
I'm losing it.

146
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,065
I can't afford to make
the payments no more.

147
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,498
Not no more.

148
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,898
Man: I'm sorry, baby.

149
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:34,025
Ty, let me and your mama
talk for a second.

150
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,156
Okay.

151
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:44,922
Man: Come on, now.

152
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,829
Only reason I'm here,
so you can say goodbye to your son.

153
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,591
Okay.

154
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:57,530
I been coming here
for damn near 11 years, Lawrence.

155
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,263
And I'm tired.

156
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,322
I'm tired of coming here.

157
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:07,696
- Officer #1: Time.
- So soon?

158
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,223
I got to get going, baby.

159
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,456
Time for me to go, Ty.

160
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:34,931
I'm gonna call you.
You wait by the phone, okay?

161
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,989
Come on now.
You got to let go.

162
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,657
Woman:
Come on, Tyrell.

163
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,893
For every time
I hurt you, I'm sorry.

164
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,024
Officer #1: Come on.

165
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,631
Officer #2: Ma'am, let's go.

166
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,097
Let's go.

167
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,929
Officer #2: Ma'am, let's go.

168
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,090
- (door closes)
- I know my way out of here.

169
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,291
Come on.

170
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,562
Hank: He don't have
any outstanding appeal, so...

171
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:22,098
looks like we're definitely
gonna do it tonight.

172
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,063
Everybody okay?

173
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,598
- You all right, Georgia Ann?
- I'm okay.

174
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,828
Hank:
Dappa, is that hood ready?

175
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,092
Yeah, it's fixed

Hank: Tommy?

179
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,890

It calms him down.

180
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,330
Draw?

181
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:46,922
- Yeah.
- Okay.

182
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:50,659
Phil, will you make sure he's got
whatever it is he needs to draw with?

183
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:51,255
Yes, sir.

184
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,592
Hank: Tommy, why don't you
lead us in prayer?

185
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,654
Okay.

save us his anointing.

Ye will hear Him
in His holy Heaven,

of His right hand.

Be careful with this.

192

Don't worry about it, man.

the name of the Lord, our God.

They're brought down and fallen,
but we are risen and stand upright.

Save us, Lord. Let the King

Sky surfing is when you skydive,

200
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:56,888
with a board attached to your feet,
and try to do different maneuvers.

201

A camera flyer flies
with a camera on top of a helmet,

filming the sky surfer...

203
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:05,561

for capturing the moves.

Everything's gonna
be okay, right?

207
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:19,296
Yes, sir.

208
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:27,592
What about my last phone call?

209
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,029
Warden says it's a bad idea.

210
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:34,726
Turn around.

211
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,724
Maybe you could call my son
and tell him that I tried.

212
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:45,797
I don't think so.

213

don't be eating that shit?

You fucked him up!
You fucked up that man's last walk!

How would you like it
if somebody fucked up your last walk?!

299
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:26,353
You're like a woman,
like your fucking mother!

300
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,996
You shouldn't have done that,
you son of a bitch!

301
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:33,657
Get up,

302
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:36,096

304
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:44,154
- Easy, easy!
- Get your fucking hands off me,

305
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,789
- you fucking nigger!
- Hank! Hank!

306
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:51,888
- This ain't you!
- This is me, Phil! This is me!

307
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:54,329
And I'm the man
who could have your job!

308
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,194
Don't let me catch you touching

309
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:01,129

Sonny.

315
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,688
Get up!
Get out of my goddamn house!

316
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:53,861
You get out!
Come on!

317
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:59,493
You lousy piece of shit!

318
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:02,656

320
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:09,363
What are you gonna do?!

321
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:16,763
See? How do you like
that, huh?

322
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:19,127
Are you a tough guy now?
Are you tough?

323
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,695
Say something.

324
00:35:27,765 --> 00:35:29,958
Say something!

325
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:46,130
Get up.

326
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:57,497
You hate me.

327
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,427
Answer me.

You hate me, don't you?

329
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,461
Yeah, I hate you.

330
00:36:20,598 --> 00:36:22,461
I always did.

00:36:23,966 --> 00:36:26,591
Well,
I always loved you.

00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:38,359
Hand me the scissors.

333
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:12,961
Hold on a minute.

334
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:17,157

- I want to put these up.

335

- How much?
- That'll be $2.85.

336
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:12,591
Billy, I'm moving
as fast as I can.

337
00:39:12,665 --> 00:39:14,722
I'll put this dress on
and I'll be right there.

338
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:17,264
- You don't need to.
- Damn car still acting up.

339
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:20,492
It's not just your car.
You've been late every day.

340
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:23,429
I've been trying.
I need this money.

341
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:25,157
- I'll lose my house.
- Look,

342
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:28,322
go home, relax.
Take some time off.

343
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:29,954
You shouldn't be here
right now anyway.

344
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:33,122
That's why you should have
given me the week off.

345
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:36,562
- With some pay.
- We already got a new girl.

346
00:39:58,265 --> 00:39:59,855
Hank?

347
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,459
- Let's get this over with quick.
- Is there a passage

348
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,623
- You'd like me to read?
- No.

349
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:11,324
All I want to hear is
that dirt hitting that box.

350
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:19,223
He was weak.

351
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:29,364
You can say something if you want,
once we've covered him up.

352
00:41:50,764 --> 00:41:52,526
- How are you doing?
- All right.

353
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:56,121
- You want to see a menu?
- No, I know what I want.

354
00:41:58,031 --> 00:42:00,327
What you gonna have?

355
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:02,626
A bowl of chocolate
ice cream...

356
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:05,397
and a cup of coffee.

357
00:42:06,664 --> 00:42:09,597
- Black, sugar, cream?
- No, black.

358
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,361
- That's it.
- Is that it?

359
00:42:21,565 --> 00:42:23,792
(dialing)

360
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:31,063
Hey, Vera, it's Hank.

361
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,858
Is it too late?

362
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:40,094
Chocolate ice cream.
Here you go.

363
00:42:40,165 --> 00:42:43,961
I'll take a plastic spoon
for the ice cream.

364
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:48,427
Oh, Goddamn!
Sorry about that.

365
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:50,589
- It's all right.
- Shit!

366
00:42:50,664 --> 00:42:52,789
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.

367
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:55,092
Bring me some napkins
or something.

368
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:58,188
I'm sorry about that.
And you said a what--

369
00:42:58,265 --> 00:42:59,594
Plastic spoon.

370
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:06,458
- Where's Lucille?
- I'm trying to fill in for her.

371
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:25,426
- Hank: I'm ready to pay this.
- Yep.

372
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:37,529
- (machine beeps)
- What's the deal here?

373
00:43:37,597 --> 00:43:41,189
I don't know.
I just overrang this thing.

374
00:43:43,898 --> 00:43:45,625
If you can't get it open,

375
00:43:45,698 --> 00:43:48,892
tell me how much it is,
and I'll pay you for it.

376
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:50,897
$3.92.

377
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,423
Here's $4.00.
Keep the change.

378
00:43:57,365 --> 00:43:59,490
Thanks.

379
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:03,156
Vera: Hey, cowboy, feel like
some late-night pussy?

380
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:04,662
Hank: I guess so.

381
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:07,788
Haven't seen you
in a while.

382
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:10,422
Yeah, well...

383
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:12,986
I ain't been
feeling too good.

384
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:17,031
Busy with this and that
and the other.

385
00:44:21,864 --> 00:44:23,727
- How have you been?
- All right.

386
00:44:23,798 --> 00:44:25,525
Good.

387
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:33,494
So how's Sonny?

388
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:44,227
I can't do this tonight,
Vera.

389
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:48,253
- Are you sure, hon?
- No, not tonight.

390
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:52,661
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be. Some other time.

391
00:44:54,131 --> 00:44:55,461
All right.

392
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,661
You can keep that money.

393
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:03,526
Vera:
I'm going to.

394
00:45:06,698 --> 00:45:08,164
Adios.

395
00:47:02,664 --> 00:47:05,824
- Man: Have a seat, Hank.
- Thank you, sir.

396
00:47:05,898 --> 00:47:08,728
I appreciate you seeing me.

397
00:47:08,798 --> 00:47:10,889
Man:
What brings you here?

398
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:14,022
Sir, I'm resigning

399
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:18,121
and I wanted to come by
and tell you personally.

400
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:24,590
I appreciate that,
Hank.

401
00:47:28,131 --> 00:47:32,324
Why don't we wait a few weeks
before we submit the paperwork?

402
00:47:32,397 --> 00:47:34,795
That wouldn't do anybody
any good to wait on that.

403
00:47:34,864 --> 00:47:36,727
I've got
my mind made up.

404
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:40,157
All right.

405
00:47:41,898 --> 00:47:44,023
We're gonna miss you.

406
00:47:50,131 --> 00:47:52,722
I brought
my badge in and...

407
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:59,693
- Why don't you keep it?
- I ain't got no use for it.

408
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:29,028
Hank:
There you are, Pop.

409
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:37,626
We got each other...

410
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:39,891
son.

411
00:48:41,564 --> 00:48:44,291
- Remember that.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:55,687
I quit the team.

413
00:49:08,731 --> 00:49:11,197
That was a mistake.

414
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:20,858
I can't do it anymore.

415
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:26,262
You're reminding me
of your mother.

416
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:32,661
I guess that's bad,
right?

417
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:37,162
Your mother wasn't shit.

418
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:41,020
That woman failed me.

419
00:49:45,497 --> 00:49:49,486
I got more pussy
after she killed herself...

420
00:49:50,731 --> 00:49:53,754
than I did when
she was living as my wife.

421
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,459
The point is...

422
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:04,929
she quit on me.

423
00:50:06,065 --> 00:50:08,690
You're doing the same.

424
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:14,659
Leticia:
Goddamnit!

425
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:19,786
Let's go.
Hand me my purse.

426
00:50:19,864 --> 00:50:21,454
Come on. Get out!

427
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:24,258
- Why, Mama, what's wrong?
- We've got to walk.

428
00:50:47,098 --> 00:50:48,996
(honking)

429
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:51,428
Tyrell,
get off that street!

430
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:54,089
You'll get yourself killed.

431
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:57,130
Don't do that!
Don't do that!

432
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:03,463
Hank: This is jim-dandy.
This is just what I'm looking for.

433
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:06,964
Hank: At the same time,
it's the most expensive one.

434
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:10,326
But if you're willing
to talk price a little...

435
00:51:10,397 --> 00:51:12,556
Attendant:
We put quite a bit of work into it.

436
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:14,529
We could talk about it.

437
00:51:14,597 --> 00:51:17,757
Hank: Let me think it over.
You have my number.

438
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:19,990
- Attendant: All right.
- It was a pleasure.

439
00:51:20,065 --> 00:51:22,690
- Hank: Nice seeing you.
- Nice talking to you.

440
00:51:22,764 --> 00:51:24,559
See you.

441
00:51:36,097 --> 00:51:39,120
Come on, T.
Let's go.

442
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:43,487
That's what you think
your mama looks like?

443
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:45,291
Yeah, sort of.

444
00:51:45,364 --> 00:51:47,024
- See you in the morning?
- Yeah.

445
00:51:47,097 --> 00:51:48,427
- You too, young man.
- Bye.

446
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:49,463
Bye-bye.

447
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:23,559
Come on, T.
Get up!

448
00:52:26,064 --> 00:52:28,758
Come on, T.
Get up!

449
00:52:28,831 --> 00:52:31,820
Leticia: Help me!

450
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,386
Help me! Wait!

451
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:35,555
Wait!

452
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:40,256
Come back here!

453
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:42,320
Help us!

454
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:47,258
Please, help us!

455
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,297
Help us!

456
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:02,095
Come on, T.

457
00:53:02,164 --> 00:53:04,858
Come on, baby.
Wake up!

458
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,089
Wake up!

459
00:53:07,164 --> 00:53:10,062
- He was hit by a car!
- It's okay.

460
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,426
We need to get him
to the hospital.

461
00:53:12,497 --> 00:53:15,088
Right now! Right now!

462
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:50,830
We'll need a gurney out here.
There's a kid. I think it's bad.

463
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,921
Hank:
We'll need some help.

464
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:04,787
Are you the boy's mother?
Please, follow me.

465
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,656
Is that your boy?

466
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,596
No.

467
00:54:12,664 --> 00:54:14,220
Guard:
What happened?

468
00:54:15,564 --> 00:54:17,291
I think
he got hit by a car.

469
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:19,455
That was his mother.

470
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:22,019
- She said he was hit by a car.
- Hit and run?

471
00:54:22,097 --> 00:54:24,723
I don't know.
I picked them up--

472
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:28,025
Guard: I need you to file a police
report if it was a hit and run.

473
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:31,825
Hank: Shit, I don't even know them.
I wouldn't know what to write.

474
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:35,022
Guard: Just stay, tell the police
what you did and saw.

475
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:36,654
It'll be five minutes.

476
00:54:55,064 --> 00:54:56,462
Wait!

477
00:54:57,564 --> 00:55:01,690
Wait!
That's my baby!

478
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:09,161
Wait!
That's my baby!

479
00:55:11,664 --> 00:55:14,061
That's my baby!

480
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:18,428
Hank: I know you're not
supposed to move people,

481
00:55:18,497 --> 00:55:21,793
but I didn't know
what else to do.

482
00:55:21,863 --> 00:55:23,988
The boy
was laying there...

483
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:26,758
and the woman
was hysterical.

484
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:29,921
I did the best I could do.
I just lugged him in the car

485
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:33,054
to come here as quick as I could.
That's what I did.

486
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,857
Detective:
You did a good job.

487
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,692
So you were
just passing by?

488
00:55:38,764 --> 00:55:41,821
Yeah, I don't know
the lady at all.

489
00:55:43,897 --> 00:55:46,420
Detective:
I'll give you my card.

490
00:55:46,497 --> 00:55:50,054
We'll do a follow-up
if we get anything.

491
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,119
We might call you as well,
if we need to.

492
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:55,527
- That'd be all right?
- Whatever you need me to do.

493
00:55:55,597 --> 00:55:58,119
I got your number
right there.

494
00:56:01,364 --> 00:56:03,353
Is that it?
Can I go?

495
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,489
Yeah. Thanks.

496
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,522
Will that boy
make it all right?

497
00:56:14,597 --> 00:56:17,392
No, he died.

498
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:48,058
Mrs. Musgrove,
I'll give you my card

499
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,688
and you feel free
to call me anytime

500
00:56:50,763 --> 00:56:53,389
that you can remember
anything about this.

501
00:56:53,464 --> 00:56:55,487
I'm so sorry.

502
00:56:55,564 --> 00:56:57,723
Can I get something
to clean that off?

503
00:56:58,797 --> 00:57:00,786
That's mine.

504
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:11,395
- Here's your purse.
- He's gone.

505
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:13,623
- My baby.
- Yes, ma'am.

506
00:57:13,698 --> 00:57:16,528
He's gone. He's gone.

507
00:57:17,863 --> 00:57:19,693
(Leticia sobs)

508
00:57:22,097 --> 00:57:23,858
Will you
take her home?

509
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:28,158
I don't really know her.

510
00:57:30,064 --> 00:57:33,087
- I'll take her home.
- That's a good idea.

511
00:57:33,164 --> 00:57:34,425
Hank: Yeah,
I'll take her home.

512
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:45,386
Could you do me a favor
and throw that away for me?

513
00:57:45,464 --> 00:57:47,861
- Yes, sir.
- I'd appreciate that.

514
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,729
Hank:
Where do you live?

515
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:12,463
Ma'am, you'll have to tell me
where you live.

516
00:58:14,797 --> 00:58:16,922
Now, I'll go
in your purse.

517
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:19,156
I'm letting you know
I'm going in your purse

518
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,196
to find
an address on you.

519
00:58:59,997 --> 00:59:02,259
You should call
some of your kin people

520
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,126
or a friend or something.

521
00:59:12,464 --> 00:59:15,191
I'm going to have to go.

522
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:17,025
You gonna be all right?

523
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:22,587
They told me to call
the Coroner's Office in the morning.

524
00:59:24,197 --> 00:59:26,060
I'm sorry?

525
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,426
They told me to call
the Coroner's Office.

526
00:59:29,497 --> 00:59:32,327
They said
they gonna do an autopsy.

527
00:59:33,596 --> 00:59:36,892
I don't know why
they'll do an autopsy.

528
00:59:38,064 --> 00:59:40,189
He was hit by a car.

529
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:48,761
I imagine that'll help them
find out who did it.

530
00:59:50,264 --> 00:59:52,786
You really believe
they'll do that?

531
00:59:53,863 --> 00:59:56,489
I believe
they'll try their best.

532
00:59:57,564 --> 01:00:00,223
He's a Black kid.

533
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:02,490
You think
they'll do that?

534
01:00:10,964 --> 01:00:14,294
Here's your bag.
I'll leave it on the floor.

535
01:00:21,264 --> 01:00:23,492
I'm real sorry.

536
01:01:11,663 --> 01:01:13,289
Mr. Grotowski?

537
01:01:13,364 --> 01:01:15,795
Just want to say
sorry about Sonny.

538
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:20,125
- We liked him a lot.
- We feel bad, sir.

539
01:01:24,164 --> 01:01:26,527
Which one of you is Willie
and which's one's Harry?

540
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:28,960
He's Willie.

541
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,825
He's Darryl.

542
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,860
I'll see ya.
I appreciate that.

543
01:01:50,364 --> 01:01:54,194
I'm going over to the cafe.
Do you want a ride?

544
01:01:56,064 --> 01:01:58,461
You sure
you don't mind?

545
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,792
I'm going
that way anyway.

546
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:05,423
(country music playing)

547
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,921
Is this music
all right with you?

548
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:22,319
- 'Cause I can change it.
- No, it's cool.

549
01:02:24,364 --> 01:02:26,829
You ain't got a car?

550
01:02:26,897 --> 01:02:29,159
It's broke.

551
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,321
I'm saving
to get me another one.

552
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:46,457
Leticia:
$8.64. Thank you.

553
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,689
Hank: Thank you.

554
01:02:48,763 --> 01:02:51,286
You have
a good shift, okay?

555
01:02:51,364 --> 01:02:53,193
Leticia: Thanks.

556
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:58,396
- Leticia: Thank you.
- You're welcome.

557
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,525
Hey, Pop?

558
01:03:31,596 --> 01:03:34,790
- Look it here.
- What are those for?

559
01:03:34,863 --> 01:03:37,590
I bought a gas station.

560
01:03:38,964 --> 01:03:41,691
- That right?
- Mmm-hmm.

561
01:03:44,297 --> 01:03:46,286
It's all bought and paid for.

562
01:03:46,363 --> 01:03:48,125
- We own it.
- (Buck sneezes)

563
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:54,255
Don't say ''we.''
You own it.

564
01:03:55,797 --> 01:03:57,660
I didn't buy it.

565
01:03:59,164 --> 01:04:04,460
- Yeah, well...
- I wouldn't have bought no gas station.

566
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,655
Is that right?

567
01:04:09,964 --> 01:04:12,794
I would have stuck
to what I knew best.

568
01:04:12,863 --> 01:04:16,852
- What's that?
- Corrections Officer.

569
01:04:18,363 --> 01:04:20,386
Right.

570
01:04:20,463 --> 01:04:22,861
Well, I ain't
a Corrections Officer no more.

571
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,021
I'm a gas-station owner.

572
01:04:26,297 --> 01:04:29,286
I already made the deal.
It's too late, Pop.

573
01:04:29,363 --> 01:04:31,556
You want me
to fix you something?

574
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,119
No.

575
01:04:38,663 --> 01:04:39,856
Hey.

576
01:04:59,697 --> 01:05:01,287
Here you go.

577
01:05:03,563 --> 01:05:05,189
How are you doing?

578
01:05:06,263 --> 01:05:10,196
I'm doing all right.
Tired.

579
01:05:10,263 --> 01:05:13,457
- You gonna eat something?
- Chocolate ice cream.

580
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:16,257
Plastic spoon.

581
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:19,623
You got it.

582
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,056
Thank you.

583
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:31,161
- You're all set?
- Mmm-hmm.

584
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:35,320
- About time for you to get off?
- Mmm-hmm.

585
01:05:36,697 --> 01:05:39,095
Did you want me
to give you a ride?

586
01:05:40,363 --> 01:05:41,693
No...

587
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:44,025
I really couldn't ask you
to do that.

588
01:05:44,097 --> 01:05:46,358
It's right on the way home.

589
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:55,756
- You sure you don't mind?
- No, I'd be happy to.

590
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,728
Okay.

591
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:03,484
- Hank: It's right on Prospect Street.
- Leticia: Clement's?

592
01:06:03,563 --> 01:06:05,927
- Yeah, Clement's.
- You bought Clement's?

593
01:06:05,997 --> 01:06:07,519
Yeah.

594
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,562
Leticia:
I know Clement.

595
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:13,858
- I can't stand that man.
- He ain't going to be running it.

596
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,021
Leticia:
Well, that's good.

597
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,562
Thanks for the ride.

598
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,892
Can I ask you
a question?

599
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,188
Why did you help me?

600
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:32,860
- What do you mean?
- When you took us to the hospital.

601
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:34,862
Why did you do that?

602
01:06:41,196 --> 01:06:43,719
I don't know. I guess--

603
01:06:43,797 --> 01:06:45,456
I just--

604
01:06:48,064 --> 01:06:51,154
doing the right thing,
I guess.

605
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:01,222
My son died.

606
01:07:04,363 --> 01:07:06,091
And--

607
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:11,254
well, he--

608
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:13,421
he died and then--

609
01:07:16,463 --> 01:07:19,395
I never was
a very good father.

610
01:07:25,496 --> 01:07:27,485
He was a good kid.

611
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:34,589
I guess that somehow
I just--

612
01:07:37,097 --> 01:07:40,187
when I see what you're going
through there

613
01:07:40,263 --> 01:07:44,593
it made me think about something.
I don't know.

614
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,591
You know when you feel
like you can't breathe?

615
01:07:59,396 --> 01:08:03,056
And you can't
get out to--

616
01:08:05,797 --> 01:08:07,786
from inside yourself,
you know?

617
01:08:07,863 --> 01:08:09,351
Really.

618
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,819
Do you want
to come inside?

619
01:08:24,363 --> 01:08:26,727
I like these curtains.

620
01:08:30,196 --> 01:08:33,219
I got these here curtains
on credit.

621
01:08:33,296 --> 01:08:37,592
I never heard of anybody
getting curtains on credit before.

622
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:43,286
What do you think?
Ain't they cute?

623
01:08:43,363 --> 01:08:46,227
I love these curtains.

624
01:08:46,296 --> 01:08:48,728
Hank: They're good
and red all right.

625
01:08:48,797 --> 01:08:50,888
I got--

626
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:55,658
I got these curtains right here
on credit.

627
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:58,696
And the man told me...

628
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:01,524
that I wasn't supposed
to get this deal.

629
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,289
But I think
he liked me,

630
01:09:03,363 --> 01:09:06,727
and he told me I could have
these curtains on credit.

631
01:09:06,797 --> 01:09:08,729
I said,
what the hell?

632
01:09:08,797 --> 01:09:11,024
Red curtains
will be great for my place.

633
01:09:11,096 --> 01:09:12,960
So I said,
I'll take it.

634
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:16,826
- So I got me some red curtains.
- Damn straight.

635
01:09:19,496 --> 01:09:21,985
You sure suck
that whiskey down.

636
01:09:22,063 --> 01:09:24,996
I mean,
Lord have mercy.

637
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:33,589
My husband used to love him
some Jack Daniel's.

638
01:09:35,163 --> 01:09:37,993
Like I said,
it's a good drink.

639
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:45,427
- Wait. I'll show you something.
- Okay.

640
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,393
Sit right here.

641
01:09:58,363 --> 01:10:02,295
What you got?
Some kind of a school annual?

642
01:10:02,363 --> 01:10:03,886
No.

643
01:10:03,963 --> 01:10:05,759
These pictures
right here--

644
01:10:08,697 --> 01:10:12,151
these are my husband's
drawings right here.

645
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:15,757
Lawrence.

646
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:19,193
My husband,
he drew those.

647
01:10:24,029 --> 01:10:28,428
He got himself electrocuted
over there in Jackson.

648
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:32,388
He got himself--

649
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:40,059
These right here,
these are my son Tyrell's.

650
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:45,592
He drew these.

651
01:10:45,663 --> 01:10:47,856
He drew all of these
right here.

652
01:10:52,096 --> 01:10:55,494
He got his talent
from the old man, I guess.

653
01:10:55,563 --> 01:10:56,926
Didn't he?

654
01:10:56,996 --> 01:10:59,724
That's the only thing
that negro ever gave that boy,

655
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,695
was some drawing.

656
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:03,729
Taught him
how to draw.

657
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:06,956
It runs in the family,
sounds like it.

658
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,655
You know...

659
01:11:11,663 --> 01:11:13,720
he was a good kid.

660
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:15,955
He was
a really good kid.

661
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:18,154
He was so good.

662
01:11:18,229 --> 01:11:19,786
He was--

663
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:22,556
he really--
he loved me.

664
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:24,891
He really loved me.

665
01:11:24,963 --> 01:11:26,691
I understand.

666
01:11:29,663 --> 01:11:32,151
He was so fat.

667
01:11:33,396 --> 01:11:35,624
You saw how fat he was.

668
01:11:37,996 --> 01:11:40,360
I don't care what
I brought in this house,

669
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,055
he just ate it up!

670
01:11:42,129 --> 01:11:43,755
I don't care
what it was I brought in.

671
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,796
I bring
some Popeye's chicken,

672
01:11:45,862 --> 01:11:49,522
that boy eat the whole thing
before I can get a bite!

673
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:53,221
He would eat
his ass off!

674
01:11:54,296 --> 01:11:57,729
You haven't seen
nobody eat like--

675
01:11:59,563 --> 01:12:03,154
He would eat candy
and gumballs.

676
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:06,354
He'd make me take him
to the Super K-Mart

677
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:09,918
and he put them quarters
in that gumball machine.

678
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:12,690
He had to wait
till he get the red gumball.

679
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,455
He always had to get
the red gumball.

680
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:21,558
He sounds like a character,
I guess.

681
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:25,892
He'd get
that red gumball

682
01:12:25,963 --> 01:12:28,895
and he'd just eat
on that red gumball.

683
01:12:35,896 --> 01:12:37,226
Hey.

684
01:12:38,763 --> 01:12:40,661
I was a good mother.

685
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:45,560
I did-- every single thing
I can think to do--

686
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,562
I was really good.
I was really good.

687
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,790
- I was a good mother.
- I understand.

688
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:55,453
I didn't want him
to be fat like that.

689
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:57,927
I did not want my baby
to be fat like that,

690
01:12:57,996 --> 01:13:00,258
'cause I know,
a Black man in America,

691
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:02,818
you can't be like that!
And I tried to--

692
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,820
I was trying
to tell him,

693
01:13:06,896 --> 01:13:09,556
''You can't be like that,

694
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,653
you can't be like that
in America, and a Black man.''

695
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:13,491
I was just...

696
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:19,820
I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

697
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:23,362
I want--

698
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:26,123
I want you
to make me feel better.

699
01:13:26,196 --> 01:13:29,094
I want you
to make me feel better.

700
01:13:30,163 --> 01:13:33,493
I want you
to make me feel good.

701
01:13:35,129 --> 01:13:37,254
I want you
to make me feel good.

702
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,558
Can you make me
feel good?

703
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:41,925
Can you make me
feel good?

704
01:13:41,996 --> 01:13:44,224
Can you make me
feel good?

705
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,592
Make me feel good.

706
01:13:50,196 --> 01:13:52,560
I don't know
what to feel good's about.

707
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:56,823
Just make me feel good!
Just make me feel good!

708
01:14:44,496 --> 01:14:46,961
(Leticia wails)

709
01:15:26,862 --> 01:15:28,590
(wailing)

710
01:15:36,463 --> 01:15:38,690
(Hank grunts)

711
01:16:19,296 --> 01:16:21,727
I felt it too.

712
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:25,457
I needed you.

713
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,859
I needed you so much.

714
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:32,495
I needed you so much.

715
01:16:33,996 --> 01:16:36,860
I hadn't felt anything
in so long.

716
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,688
Leticia: Thank you.

717
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:28,393
(retching)

718
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,957
You okay?

719
01:17:45,363 --> 01:17:48,692
Me getting sick doesn't have
anything to do with you.

720
01:18:01,363 --> 01:18:03,295
Pop?

721
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,225
Hey, Pop?

722
01:18:09,296 --> 01:18:12,262
Buck:
I'm in the damn bathroom!

723
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:17,791
Hank: What the hell
happened to you?

724
01:18:17,862 --> 01:18:20,828
I twisted my ankle
trying to take a bath.

725
01:18:21,896 --> 01:18:25,192
Damn it,
I told you to be careful.

726
01:18:28,862 --> 01:18:30,691
Buck: Goddamn!

727
01:18:32,163 --> 01:18:33,958
Hank:
Wiggle your toes.

728
01:18:38,762 --> 01:18:40,251
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

729
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:42,057
Yeah?

730
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:47,588
I'm sinking.

731
01:18:47,662 --> 01:18:51,220
- What are you talking about?
- I ain't worth shit.

732
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,755
- You stop that.
- I can't clean myself.

733
01:18:56,829 --> 01:19:00,125
Can't walk to the kitchen
without falling.

734
01:19:00,196 --> 01:19:04,026
Can't get to the phone
before it stops ringing.

735
01:19:05,196 --> 01:19:08,287
I don't feel
like a man anymore.

736
01:19:10,296 --> 01:19:12,285
You're a man, Pop.

737
01:19:13,363 --> 01:19:17,022
Can't even remember
what a woman smells like.

738
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:24,355
(hammering in background)

739
01:19:42,529 --> 01:19:44,722
Girl:
There's a man here.

740
01:19:44,796 --> 01:19:46,092
Man: Where?

741
01:19:48,996 --> 01:19:50,393
Man: Thank you.

742
01:19:53,063 --> 01:19:56,052
- How are you doing?
- Hey, how are you doing?

743
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:57,685
All right.

744
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:01,921
What can I do for you?

745
01:20:01,996 --> 01:20:05,894
I got this '89 Comanche
out there...

746
01:20:07,129 --> 01:20:09,526
it needs a lube job,
new points and plugs.

747
01:20:09,595 --> 01:20:11,891
I was wondering
if you'd work on it for me.

748
01:20:13,296 --> 01:20:16,228
Yeah.
When do you need it by?

749
01:20:16,296 --> 01:20:18,625
Just as quick
as you can, really.

750
01:20:19,929 --> 01:20:21,451
Maggie!

751
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:23,893
Leave that alone, baby.
Put that down.

752
01:20:28,429 --> 01:20:31,691
I can get that to you
about tomorrow afternoon,

753
01:20:31,762 --> 01:20:33,319
late tomorrow then?

754
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:36,259
I'd appreciate it.

755
01:20:37,762 --> 01:20:41,990
Maybe them boys of yours can--
if they're not doing anything--

756
01:20:42,063 --> 01:20:44,654
wash it and wax it
and everything?

757
01:20:44,729 --> 01:20:46,354
I'm selling it.

758
01:20:46,429 --> 01:20:47,622
All right.

759
01:20:49,163 --> 01:20:51,390
I'll ask them.
I'll tell them about it.

760
01:20:51,462 --> 01:20:53,258
I'm sure
they wouldn't mind.

761
01:20:55,829 --> 01:20:58,022
I can't take this.

762
01:21:00,362 --> 01:21:02,124
It was my son's.

763
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:06,628
It'd mean a lot to him.
He'd want somebody to use it.

764
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:08,992
I ain't saying
I don't want it.

765
01:21:10,362 --> 01:21:12,988
I just can't take it.

766
01:21:13,063 --> 01:21:15,222
I want you to have it.
I really do.

767
01:21:15,295 --> 01:21:17,159
It'd mean a lot to me.

768
01:21:22,662 --> 01:21:25,185
Let's just take it
for a little spin.

769
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:29,285
Come on.

770
01:21:32,063 --> 01:21:36,722
- I ain't even got my shoes on.
- We won't go far. Let's go.

771
01:21:40,163 --> 01:21:42,152
You see how it drives.

772
01:21:52,196 --> 01:21:55,719
- What the hell is this?
- Stick shift.

773
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:27,828
Hank:
Here's the insurance and title,

774
01:22:27,896 --> 01:22:30,124
and all the papers you need.
It's all set.

775
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:34,252
- Okay.
- I'd like to see you tonight.

776
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:38,887
- We should do that.
- Is that all right?

777
01:22:45,762 --> 01:22:48,626
- I'll see you later.
- See you.

778
01:25:15,963 --> 01:25:17,656
Hank?

779
01:25:19,662 --> 01:25:21,026
Hank: That's good.

780
01:25:21,095 --> 01:25:23,152
Hello?

781
01:25:24,262 --> 01:25:25,193
Hank!

782
01:25:27,963 --> 01:25:30,224
It's Leticia.

783
01:25:35,762 --> 01:25:37,751
I'm coming on in,
Hank.

784
01:25:44,796 --> 01:25:46,489
Hank?

785
01:25:47,629 --> 01:25:49,458
Buck:
Who are you?

786
01:25:52,228 --> 01:25:55,524
You just walked
in my house?

787
01:25:55,595 --> 01:25:57,117
My bad.

788
01:25:57,195 --> 01:26:00,093
- I--
- Hank?

789
01:26:00,162 --> 01:26:03,458
- You're looking for Hank?
- Yes.

790
01:26:03,529 --> 01:26:05,791
Is he here?

791
01:26:05,862 --> 01:26:07,623
Who are you?

792
01:26:08,762 --> 01:26:12,285
My name
is Leticia Musgrove.

793
01:26:12,362 --> 01:26:13,726
And...

794
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:16,125
me and Hank is...

795
01:26:17,995 --> 01:26:19,689
friends.

796
01:26:20,762 --> 01:26:22,989
Musgrove?

797
01:26:27,028 --> 01:26:29,221
Please,
little darling...

798
01:26:30,462 --> 01:26:32,984
have you got
a cigarette?

799
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:34,961
Yeah.

800
01:26:36,062 --> 01:26:39,222
But it look to me like
you don't need to be smoking.

801
01:26:43,729 --> 01:26:45,695
Come on.

802
01:26:45,762 --> 01:26:47,819
Have you got one?

803
01:27:03,562 --> 01:27:05,187
Match?

804
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:20,784
So, is Hank here?

805
01:27:22,295 --> 01:27:25,090
Yeah.
He'll be back shortly.

806
01:27:25,162 --> 01:27:27,685
I'm Buck, his father.

807
01:27:29,862 --> 01:27:32,259
Is that for Hank?

808
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:33,761
Yeah.

809
01:27:33,829 --> 01:27:35,488
It's a gift.

810
01:27:38,395 --> 01:27:40,759
I'll see he gets it.

811
01:27:51,562 --> 01:27:53,585
Buck: Woo!

812
01:27:56,329 --> 01:27:57,693
Damn!

813
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,487
Hank must have done
something right

814
01:28:05,562 --> 01:28:08,027
to deserve
a fine hat like this.

815
01:28:10,495 --> 01:28:12,688
I guess he did.

816
01:28:12,762 --> 01:28:17,353
In my prime, I had a thing
for nigger juice myself.

817
01:28:19,062 --> 01:28:21,085
Hank's just
like his daddy.

818
01:28:22,162 --> 01:28:25,094
He ain't a man
till he split dark oak.

819
01:28:42,928 --> 01:28:46,122
Hey, Leticia?
Hang on.

820
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:47,821
Where are you going?

821
01:28:47,895 --> 01:28:50,657
Hey!
Where are you going?

822
01:28:50,729 --> 01:28:53,286
- What happened?
- I met your daddy.

823
01:28:53,362 --> 01:28:55,590
- Get off me!
- You can't do that.

824
01:28:55,662 --> 01:28:58,253
Give me a chance.
Whatever he did--

825
01:28:58,329 --> 01:29:00,352
It don't matter
a whole lot, do it?

826
01:29:00,429 --> 01:29:03,224
- Give me a chance to talk to you.
- Get off me!

827
01:29:22,228 --> 01:29:24,717
Buck:
We're family.

828
01:29:24,796 --> 01:29:27,626
I'm your father.
Remember that.

829
01:29:31,329 --> 01:29:32,693
Hank?

830
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,427
What's your problem?

831
01:29:41,962 --> 01:29:45,122
- Hank: I believe that's it.
- Thank you.

832
01:29:46,195 --> 01:29:49,161
I didn't date
that thing at the bottom.

833
01:29:49,228 --> 01:29:50,717
No problem.

834
01:29:50,795 --> 01:29:53,489
Anything below that line,
I didn't do.

835
01:29:56,729 --> 01:30:00,525
Now, you will take
good care of him?

836
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:04,083
- Woman: Oh, yes.
- Hank: 'Cause...

837
01:30:05,595 --> 01:30:08,152
I want him
to go out in peace.

838
01:30:09,228 --> 01:30:11,750
You must love him
very much.

839
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:16,591
No, I don't.

840
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:20,719
But he's my father.
So, there it is.

841
01:30:41,362 --> 01:30:44,658
They'll get you
a TV set tomorrow.

842
01:30:45,728 --> 01:30:48,217
Finally getting rid
of me, huh?

843
01:30:48,295 --> 01:30:51,022
They'll
take care of you.

844
01:30:51,095 --> 01:30:54,584
There's a telephone at the end
of the hall. You can call me.

845
01:30:54,662 --> 01:30:57,423
This is it.

846
01:30:57,495 --> 01:30:58,960
I guess so.

847
01:31:01,362 --> 01:31:03,021
I'm stuck.

848
01:31:05,095 --> 01:31:07,186
Me too.

849
01:31:09,662 --> 01:31:11,525
Buck: I don't want
to go out like this.

850
01:31:14,095 --> 01:31:15,958
Me neither.

851
01:31:20,529 --> 01:31:22,324
Goodbye, Pop.

852
01:32:19,628 --> 01:32:21,060
What?

853
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:25,759
You want your car back?

854
01:32:25,828 --> 01:32:28,556
No, I don't
want the car back.

855
01:32:28,628 --> 01:32:30,595
I mean for you to keep that.

856
01:32:30,661 --> 01:32:32,321
What?

857
01:32:32,395 --> 01:32:35,361
I want you to know
I sent him away.

858
01:32:38,661 --> 01:32:40,957
I ain't got time to talk.

859
01:32:41,028 --> 01:32:43,823
I wish you would talk to me.

860
01:32:46,262 --> 01:32:48,251
Y'all ready to order?

861
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:24,225
- Hank: How are you doing, Ryrus?
- All right. How are you?

862
01:33:24,295 --> 01:33:27,022
- I'm all right.
- Who's Leticia?

863
01:33:29,162 --> 01:33:31,151
My girlfriend.

864
01:33:35,329 --> 01:33:38,658
Sheriff's Department.
Hello?

865
01:33:51,995 --> 01:33:54,586
- Who's banging on my door?
- The Sheriff's Department.

866
01:33:54,661 --> 01:33:58,150
- Time to go, lady.
- No, no wait.

867
01:33:58,228 --> 01:34:00,091
- Time to go.
- No. Here.

868
01:34:00,162 --> 01:34:02,128
No, I don't take
anything.

869
01:34:02,195 --> 01:34:04,218
You settle with your landlord,
then I go away.

870
01:34:04,295 --> 01:34:05,783
No,
I got the money.

871
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:07,759
I suggest
you get fully dressed.

872
01:34:07,828 --> 01:34:11,920
- I'm going to put you out.
- You ain't putting me out.

873
01:34:12,995 --> 01:34:15,688
I 'bout got the money.
I'm still saving--

874
01:35:21,895 --> 01:35:23,918
I painted
the ceiling and the wall

875
01:35:23,995 --> 01:35:26,586
and fixed it up
a little bit.

876
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:28,889
I figured I ought to.

877
01:35:28,962 --> 01:35:31,757
I'll move your stuff here
so you don't have to worry with it.

878
01:35:35,561 --> 01:35:38,721
I'm going to the kitchen
to get a thing or two

879
01:35:38,795 --> 01:35:43,353
so if you want to relax,
make yourself comfortable.

880
01:35:43,428 --> 01:35:45,054
Whatever you want to do.

881
01:36:33,228 --> 01:36:37,058
- This is Tyrell's.
- I thought I'd put it up there.

882
01:36:37,128 --> 01:36:39,151
That's my boy's room.

883
01:36:41,561 --> 01:36:43,323
All right. Here.

884
01:36:44,962 --> 01:36:47,087
You can go up
if you want to.

885
01:36:53,428 --> 01:36:55,258
Can I look at these?

886
01:36:55,329 --> 01:36:57,261
Yeah, go ahead.

887
01:37:04,661 --> 01:37:06,684
That's him right there.

888
01:37:10,028 --> 01:37:11,891
He don't look like you.

889
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,426
He got his mother in him.

890
01:37:29,328 --> 01:37:32,556
Hank: I don't mind sleeping
across the hall if you want me to.

891
01:37:32,628 --> 01:37:34,617
- Maybe you should sleep by yourself.
- No...

892
01:37:34,695 --> 01:37:36,957
I wouldn't feel good

893
01:37:37,028 --> 01:37:39,516
if you left me in here
all by myself.

894
01:37:40,594 --> 01:37:43,117
I just want you
to be comfortable here.

895
01:37:45,628 --> 01:37:48,355
I want you
to be comfortable too.

896
01:38:14,394 --> 01:38:16,587
Hank:
I want to take care of you.

897
01:38:18,062 --> 01:38:19,994
Leticia: Good.

898
01:38:20,062 --> 01:38:23,687
'Cause I really need
to be taken care of.

899
01:39:00,795 --> 01:39:03,352
Can I touch you?

900
01:39:07,828 --> 01:39:08,987
Yeah.

901
01:40:11,028 --> 01:40:13,459
Did you feel that?

902
01:40:15,261 --> 01:40:16,852
Oh yeah.

903
01:40:26,661 --> 01:40:28,684
Did it feel good?

904
01:40:33,561 --> 01:40:35,186
Yeah.

905
01:40:39,661 --> 01:40:42,126
I didn't hurt you
or anything?

906
01:40:44,127 --> 01:40:46,753
Not in a bad way.

907
01:41:02,895 --> 01:41:04,861
What?

908
01:41:07,028 --> 01:41:09,994
Nothing, I just--

909
01:41:12,995 --> 01:41:15,790
I want to go out
and buy some ice cream.

910
01:41:19,761 --> 01:41:21,784
- Now?
- Yeah.

911
01:41:24,494 --> 01:41:26,687
It just feels right.

912
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:35,324
- Okay.
- Well...

913
01:41:38,094 --> 01:41:40,287
Can you buy me some?

914
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:42,259
Yeah.

915
01:41:42,328 --> 01:41:44,487
What kind do you want?

916
01:41:46,628 --> 01:41:48,287
Chocolate.

917
01:44:55,927 --> 01:44:57,325
Hey.

918
01:44:58,428 --> 01:45:00,758
I bought
some chocolate ice cream.

919
01:45:03,761 --> 01:45:05,522
Are you okay?

920
01:45:08,894 --> 01:45:11,053
You sure?

921
01:45:17,127 --> 01:45:19,093
You look real pretty.

922
01:45:21,494 --> 01:45:23,551
Let's go out on the steps.
You want to?

923
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:27,150
Let's go.

924
01:46:56,227 --> 01:46:59,625
I went by our station
on the way home.

925
01:46:59,695 --> 01:47:01,887
I like the sign.

926
01:47:18,461 --> 01:47:20,790
I think
we'll be all right.
