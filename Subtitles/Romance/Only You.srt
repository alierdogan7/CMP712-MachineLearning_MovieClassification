1
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:24,124
Only you

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,260
Can make this world
seem right

3
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:34,441
Only you

4
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:40,544
Can make the darkness bright

5
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,818
Only you

6
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:46,945
And you alone

7
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,621
Can thrill me like you do

8
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,532
And fill my heart with love

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,535
For only you

10
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:07,398
Baby, only you

11
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:13,841
Can make this change in me

12
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:18,277
For it's true

13
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:23,854
You are my destiny

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,756
Stop pushing it You're supposed to
let it happen, not force it

15
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:32,766
- I'm not pushing it You are
- I am not

16
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,667
You're doing it again
You're pushing it Stop it

17
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:38,171
Mom! Larry's pushing it!

18
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,040
- Larry, don't push it!
- I'm not it's moving itself

19
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,170
Wait
I have to write this down

20
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:50,479
Grandma said everyone has a soul mate
This way I'll know his name

21
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:54,282
The one I'm supposed to wait for
The one that'll wait for me

22
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,597
But, Faith, what if this guy
lived a billion years ago?

23
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,972
- What it he's a dead caveman?
- Don't be stupid, Larry

24
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:19,275
Soul mates are our destiny
They live when we live

25
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:23,340
What it he lives here in Pittsburgh
and you just pass him on the street?

26
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:28,014
It couldn't happen I'd know
Like when bees know how to make honey

27
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:31,115
And you'll know too
'cause you have one

28
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,217
We all do

29
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,535
Look

30
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,172
"Damon Bradley"

31
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,492
My other half?

32
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,558
My soul mate

33
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,415
She wants to know
it she's going to marry Alex

34
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:34,922
I do not!
He doesn't even have a brain

35
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,948
He's got pretty eyes That means
your kids would have pretty eyes

36
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:40,960
He can get a brain later

37
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:42,962
What do you think, Faith?

38
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,397
The most important thing is true love
isn't that right, Kate?

39
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,867
Look out below!

40
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,275
Larry, I hate you!

41
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:57,903
- Bill is gonna be so mad
- I know

42
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:00,846
Next

43
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,257
So, what destiny do you wish
from Madame Divina?

44
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,854
Just basic destiny stuff
I guess

45
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,956
But I don't want to hear anything bad
if that's okay

46
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,751
Something's coming to me

47
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:42,655
I'm getting a name

48
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,026
A name that is very important

49
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,764
David?

50
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,329
No

51
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,936
Damon

52
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,331
His name...

53
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:03,639
is Damon Bradley

54
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,975
Oh, my God

55
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,374
Your destiny is $200

56
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,793
The truth is...

57
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,593
you make your own destiny

58
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:26,963
Understand?

59
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:29,969
Don't wait for it to come to you

60
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:37,908
14 years later

61
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,913
"From the Latin root destinare...

62
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:49,081
meaning, to have destination...

63
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:51,090
to journey...

64
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:55,254
to take a trip where the events
are totally predetermined"

65
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,221
Imagine that

66
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:02,030
The motion
of like attracting like

67
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:06,164
The motion
of a divine preordination

68
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,844
Okay Look
One hand, two hands

69
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,345
Put them together...

70
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,714
and what do they make?

71
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,444
One

72
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:21,682
Right! So, Plato tells us
we began in circles

73
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,749
When we strived to be like the gods
we were punished by a thunderbolt...

74
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:29,626
that struck us and cut us
right down dead center...

75
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:31,221
in half

76
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:34,063
We scattered
to the ends of the earth...

77
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:36,899
searching and searching...

78
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:39,030
for our other half

79
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:41,768
Now, what Plato was saying...

80
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:43,935
is that if we just stop...

81
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:46,070
and go with the flow...

82
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:48,581
and follow our destiny...

83
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:51,584
it'll lead us back to each other

84
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,711
Okay, so following through
on this...

85
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,951
read from your green book

86
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,550
Remember, one Wordsworth
one Keats or one Shelley

87
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,289
Have a great holiday

88
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,875
Don't get up, Leslie
I got everything

89
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:28,183
- Kate, did you want me to help you?
- Oh, no You might strain yourself

90
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,349
- I would've helped
- What is all this? What's going on?

91
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:34,986
Wine, candles
What is it?

92
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:37,357
He proposed

93
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:39,956
Faith, that's great

94
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:42,298
Did he get down on his knees?

95
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,965
Well, no
He turned down his beeper

96
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,100
He's a doctor He's practical
He doesn't have to get on his knees

97
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,110
Did you guys set a date?

98
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:54,978
Well, no I don't think
we should rush into anything

99
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:56,983
Let me see the ring

100
00:07:58,085 --> 00:07:59,848
Where is it?

101
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,047
You don't have it on?

102
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,754
- I'm blind Oh, my goodness
- It's so pretty

103
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:10,763
Where are my sunglasses?
It's gorgeous

104
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:13,265
- I hate you
- Oh, my God

105
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:18,367
I asked him to give me 24 hours
to think about it

106
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,873
I'm never going
to get divorced, so--

107
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,912
I'm telling you
what I told him--

108
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:29,643
that I need time to reflect...

109
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,709
and that I'm going to say "yes"

110
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:36,946
I told my parents
I'm engaged

111
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:39,083
Oh, well
then it's official

112
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,254
- Dwayne What a catch He's a doctor
- He's so intelligent, Faith

113
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:44,889
- He's a doctor What do you want?
- Good sense of humor too

114
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:47,661
- He's got a mild sense of humor
- He's a doctor it's a tradeoff

115
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,033
He can't have a sense of humor too
He saves lives

116
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:51,935
He's a foot doctor

117
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:54,531
He saves feet
Feet are important

118
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,542
Plus, he's tall
Your kids will be tall

119
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,511
Yeah He's a sweetheart
You don't have to sell me on him

120
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,571
He's as good as gold

121
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,583
What is it you're waiting for?

122
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,754
I'm not waiting

123
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:10,757
Hey, Faith, grab me a beer

124
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:13,760
Faith, don't wait
You wait, you'll wind up with nothing

125
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:19,394
Oh, yeah Hi, Larry
Yeah, she's here Hold on

126
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,902
- My brother for you
- Uh-oh

127
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,905
Stop it
Don't eat my crust, Les

128
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,812
You still there?
I thought you'd be heading home by now

129
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,347
- I'm not I'm here
- What are you doing there?

130
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:37,816
Hanging out with your sister and Leslie
What is it? You miss me?

131
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:41,651
Yeah, my heart is breaking for you
Did you forget what night it is?

132
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:43,690
The guys are coming over
for poker

133
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:46,385
Oh I didn't know
you wanted me to play

134
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,659
Very funny Get home, make some
sandwiches and pick up some beer

135
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,599
This is my one night out
The kids are at Gus's

136
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:57,432
- Give me a break
- Kate, I still got lots of work to do!

137
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,336
Well, I've been in class
all day

138
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:01,067
Class?

139
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,440
The guys are gonna be there
without anything to eat!

140
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,445
I'm a woman, not a menu

141
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:08,243
All of a sudden
you're Helen Reddy

142
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,680
Get home!

143
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,684
You're gonna embarrass me

144
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:15,085
Fend for yourself
because I'm not coming home

145
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,817
I gotta go

146
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,054
What?

147
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:22,527
It's Ezio Pinza

148
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:23,688
Ezio who?

149
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:27,029
He was in South Pacific
with Mary Martin

150
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:31,971
Why don't they write songs
like this anymore?

151
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,473
I've gotta get going

152
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:37,477
No, no, no
You gotta stay and watch this

153
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,570
When you feel her call you

154
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,915
Across a crowded room

155
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:48,079
Then fly to her side

156
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:51,886
Saw a psychiatrist on Donahue say
that love songs are just a cruel hoax...

157
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,893
that feed people's fantasies

158
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:57,897
Romance on a daily basis?
Nobody has that

159
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:00,593
Yeah, but, Katy
somebody wrote those songs

160
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:03,398
They came out of
somebody's experience

161
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,538
No, I think they came out of
someone's imagination

162
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:11,334
Once you have found him

163
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,903
Never let him go

164
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:17,473
Once you have found her

165
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,985
Never

166
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,421
Let her

167
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,687
Go

168
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,706
Oh, my gosh

169
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:44,174
Wow

170
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:50,246
- Oh, look how it sparkles
- She's a beauty

171
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,875
Must've cost a lot

172
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:56,048
Yeah, I researched a lot of diamonds
and gemstones for this Learned a lot

173
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:58,057
It's amazing how many variations
there are...

174
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,060
of pure carbon
crystallized into octahedrons

175
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,898
But here's my real gemstone
right here

176
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,197
Sweet

177
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,675
- I know you don't like that I'm sorry
- That's okay is it all off?

178
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,211
- Yeah, I got it all
- Great

179
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,271
You've got to show this
to Aunt Gloria and Aunt Lil

180
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:23,578
They came all the way
from Pottsville

181
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:25,949
- May I see it one more time?
- Oh, Leslie!

182
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,511
Oh, my God!
It's the perfect size!

183
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:30,523
Come on, sweetheart

184
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,286
I feel like crying

185
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:35,123
- I have a headache
- Again?

186
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,322
Yes, but not
one of those headaches

187
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:40,094
I have 50 bobby pins
holding my hair together

188
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,101
What is this?
It's down Put it up

189
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:45,332
It's not exploitation
Everybody wants money, right?

190
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:47,465
That's what makes
this country great, doll

191
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:51,375
- Don't call me doll, okay?
- You used to love it

192
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:53,504
Well, you said it differently then

193
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,248
Faith?

194
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:00,281
- Faith
- Oh Yes

195
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:02,652
I wore it
my daughter wore it...

196
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:05,658
and I want you
to have the same joy

197
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:11,831
And I must say I was thrilled
when Dwayne said you would wear it

198
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:14,867
Dwayne?

199
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:20,832
- Where are you going?
- She's got another of her headaches

200
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:24,776
It's a bobby-pin headache, Mom
Talk to you later, Les

201
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,939
- We're going Can I have the keys?
- I've got the keys Let's go

202
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,279
Well, good night, okay?
Call me early

203
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,683
Faith, I gotta go

204
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,687
Call you tomorrow

205
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,784
- It would mean a lot to her
- It means a lot to me too, Dwayne

206
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,795
- She's not a young woman anymore
- She's already been married twice

207
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,799
Surely we can do this one little thing
for her Will you think about it?

208
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,461
- The thing is, you didn't ask me
- Oh, my God

209
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:53,233
Here comes your crazy uncle Pat
He wants to take another picture

210
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:55,673
- Ask me next time
- Let me fix your hair

211
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:58,906
- It's supposed to be like that
- There Now you're perfect

212
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,674
One more Good one

213
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,688
- Sorry I'm late, Faith
- Don't look!

214
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:17,492
Oh, dear Okay
Guess what I'm tree

215
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,556
My mom and dad took the kids
to the lake for Labor Day...

216
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:23,569
so I was running around
getting that stutf together

217
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:26,435
- Dwayne's not coming over, is he?
- No

218
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,441
He had emergency surgery

219
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,744
You can look

220
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:44,118
Wow!

221
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:48,059
Faith, that's a dress

222
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:50,096
I've decided it's romantic...

223
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:53,099
wearing the gown of the woman
who bore your husband

224
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:56,068
I mean, my daughter
will wear it too...

225
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,535
someday...

226
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,299
maybe... not

227
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:02,206
Wait a second
Put the veil on

228
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,210
It'll be okay

229
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:11,310
- Sweet of her, wasn't it?
- Yes

230
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:14,320
It I had this dress
I'd give it to someone

231
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:18,886
- I look like a muffin
- No, you look fine

232
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:23,692
Did it come with the soundtrack?

233
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:26,289
I think it's built in here
somewhere

234
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:28,596
There's probably
plenty of things

235
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,729
It's the thickness
We'll fix it Don't worry

236
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,739
I'll pin it a little bit

237
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,741
We'll see what we can do

238
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,146
- Life's not like it is in the movies
- No, it's not

239
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:45,617
Although from day one
everyone conspires to tell you it is

240
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:46,948
Your mother, your father

241
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,786
Teachers, priests, everybody

242
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:54,851
Dreams come true The good guy wins
People live happily ever after

243
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,862
All that crap

244
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,797
Then one day you wake up
and realize that...

245
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,732
your life should be...

246
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,463
different

247
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:09,534
Katy, dreams aren't crap

248
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,947
Okay, what about
unforgettable moments?

249
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,413
You can't tell me
you don't have...

250
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:20,214
one memorable
unforgettable moment...

251
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,721
because I know
you've had thousands of them

252
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,686
We're having one right now
I'm in my wedding dress

253
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,325
Those are the things to notice

254
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:38,570
Kate, what's wrong?

255
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,474
I don't know

256
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,245
Faith, I gotta talk to you
about something

257
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:49,407
What?

258
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:53,418
Larry and I, we're just--

259
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:59,824
I'm sorry
I have to answer

260
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,828
Dwayne's having his calls forwarded
Don't move

261
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:12,604
- Dr Dwayne Johnson, please
- He's not in at the moment

262
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:15,699
He's doing an emergency matrixectomy
Can I take a message?

263
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:18,745
- Who's this?
- Faith, his fiancee Who's this?

264
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:22,680
Hi I'm a high school buddy of Dwayne's
Congratulations on your wedding

265
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:25,547
- Thanks
- I'll be in Europe, so I'll miss it

266
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,849
- Aw, that's too bad
- Be careful

267
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,582
What's your name?

268
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:32,716
I can hardly hear you
Can you spell it?

269
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:35,261
Yeah D-A-M-O-N...

270
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:37,627
B-R-A-D-L-E-Y

271
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:46,497
- Hello? Are you okay?
- What?

272
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,872
What's going on?
Who is it?

273
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:53,706
- Damon Bradley?
- Yeah?

274
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,374
- Where are you?
- I'm at the airport Why?

275
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:59,884
- Where are you going?
- To Venice Why?

276
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:02,753
I love Venice!

277
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:06,122
I gotta run now, but maybe someday
we can all get together

278
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,428
He hung up
He hung up

279
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:18,437
It's okay, honey
If he calls you once, he'll call back

280
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:21,702
- Get me out of this
- Hold on There's a million buttons

281
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,642
Whoa! Spin! Spin! Spin!

282
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,414
Jesus
Where are you going?

283
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,473
To the airport
Call a cab

284
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,986
- You can't just go to the airport!
- I'll be downstairs

285
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:36,079
Change your dress!

286
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:45,955
Faith!
It's a coincidence!

287
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:49,434
It is not a coincidence
You don't understand it's fate

288
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,438
I just wanna get a look at him
that's all

289
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,941
Come on, Faith!
This is insane!

290
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:14,952
- Stop!
- Be careful!

291
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,928
- Oh, God
- Watch it

292
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:18,794
Good luck!

293
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,627
Sorry!

294
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,879
Excuse me, sisters

295
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,113
Flight 417?

296
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,125
The flight's closed
Your boarding pass, please

297
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:49,094
I misplaced it

298
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:53,565
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass
we cannot let you on the plane

299
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:56,458
- It's here somewhere
- Great

300
00:19:56,536 --> 00:20:00,063
Until you find it
we can't let you on the plane

301
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,973
Look, this is a real emergency

302
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:07,946
Please let me on for just one second
I really need to see somebody onboard

303
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:11,916
l'm sorry We have very strict rules
They are for your own satety

304
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:14,385
You could aftect my life

305
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:21,217
Just a moment, please

306
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:27,466
This is Eric over at TWA

307
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:30,697
We have a 237 on our hands here

308
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:33,395
Uh-huh

309
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:34,804
Yeah

310
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,137
Thanks

311
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:40,112
It'll be just a moment

312
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,959
The man I was supposed to marry
is on that plane

313
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,405
I'm telling you
it is a miracle

314
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:11,467
There is no such thing
as a coincidence

315
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:15,606
Kate, if I don't get on that plane
I am going to regret it

316
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:19,618
No, not today, but tomorrow
and for the rest of my life

317
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:24,148
It's Labor Day weekend
I don't have classes till Wednesday

318
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,690
Thank you!

319
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:31,660
Okay, my passport's
in the top left drawer

320
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:35,098
Pack all my nice underwear
anything non-wrinkly

321
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,658
Don't forget my blow dryer

322
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:41,799
Oh, Katy, you gotta hurry The plane
leaves in an hour and 12 minutes

323
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,954
Faith! Faith!

324
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,253
- My God, you smashed that lady
- Oh, I didn't hurt anyone

325
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,524
- Nice jacket
- Hi

326
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:06,725
- I'm coming with you
- Are you crazy?

327
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,701
Oh, yeah I'm crazy
Sorry

328
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:12,200
You can't go alone

329
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:14,934
What it you make a mistake
you'll always regret?

330
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:17,909
Do I need to remind you
your wedding is in ten days?

331
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:22,142
Katy, look, I know you think
this is irresponsible...

332
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,480
but think how much more irresponsible
it would be...

333
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,486
to marry the wrong person

334
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:31,581
- I packed jeans and a dress
- God, I wish I had a passport

335
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:34,017
Excuse me

336
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:37,359
I also packed that little red dress
you never have the guts to wear

337
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,091
I got the blow dryer

338
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:42,430
Just get an adapter betore
you plug it in it could blow up

339
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,664
Why are we doing this?
It's insane

340
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,404
What it Dwayne and I aren't meant to be?
It's not fair for me to waste his life

341
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:54,106
She's right
What if he's really her soul mate?

342
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,115
He's not her soul mate
She's never even met this man

343
00:22:57,183 --> 00:23:00,619
She's waited her whole lite for somebody
with a name she got off a board game...

344
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:03,281
when she was 11

345
00:23:03,356 --> 00:23:05,722
You forgot about
the fortune teller

346
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,864
Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry

347
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,025
- We only got five minutes
- Oh, God

348
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,034
Bye, you guys
Have a good time

349
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,708
- Oh, my God
- It's your hoops

350
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,870
- Coming trom or going to the wedding?
- Going Come on

351
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,713
Good-bye

352
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:35,118
So we're gonna fly to Italy and comb the
streets looking for a total stranger

353
00:23:35,188 --> 00:23:37,122
He's going to Venice, right?
Small city

354
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,125
So I called six hotels
and found out where he's staying

355
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:42,718
Let's go, girls
You'll miss the happy day

356
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,230
We'll see him tomorrow
and be back the next day?

357
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,529
Exactly He's registered
at the Hotel Danieli

358
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:51,729
- I can't believe I'm doing this
- We get all kinds here, don't we?

359
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,067
Unbelievable

360
00:24:06,953 --> 00:24:08,784
Hotel Danieli?

361
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:14,886
So many planes
I have motion sickness

362
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:16,826
- Oh, my God
- A boat?

363
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,023
- It's gonna be great
- No, it's not

364
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:22,034
- I don't feel well, Faith I'm tired
- Give me your hand

365
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:25,128
I'm a very good triend
Do you realize that?

366
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:54,633
"The most serene"

367
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:59,138
Where people come looking for something
they can't find anyplace else

368
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,538
- Faith, this is a Lifestyles hotel
- What?

369
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,540
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
We can't afford this

370
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,542
Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here

371
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,396
Kate

372
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,998
He could be anywhere

373
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:40,638
Come on

374
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,742
Reservations
for Faith Corvatch, please

375
00:26:52,552 --> 00:26:55,146
You could put the room
on this

376
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:03,128
Could you please tell us
what room Mr Bradley is in?

377
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:04,629
Yes

378
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:09,868
I can't stand it

379
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:15,800
I'm sorry Mr Bradley
has already checked out

380
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,804
Excuse me?

381
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,051
He just arrived today

382
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:31,884
Mr Bradley left
about half an hour ago

383
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:34,153
Would you preter an interior or--

384
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:37,162
You're saying he checked in
then checked out? No

385
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,165
You must be mistaken
He's supposed to be here now

386
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,230
I'm very sorry
Perhaps you misunderstood

387
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:47,299
Perhaps you misunderstood

388
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:48,965
Please check again, sir

389
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:53,877
It you would check again, we'd really
appreciate it Thank you Damon Bradley

390
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:56,040
With a "B"

391
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:03,413
Room 217

392
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,426
His key has been returned

393
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:10,792
I'm afraid your friend
has departed

394
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:13,024
Did he leave
any torwarding intormation?

395
00:28:14,634 --> 00:28:16,226
Which way did he go?

396
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:20,534
I don't know
We don't usually follow our guests

397
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:24,600
Excuse me, sir
I don't think you understand

398
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:27,874
My friend has traveled a long way
to find this gentleman

399
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:31,576
Anything you can do to help us
we would appreciate Anything at all

400
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,744
What?
I was just getting going

401
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:03,682
Oh, he ate breakfast
Thank God, 'cause I'm starving

402
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:12,618
I think this is the room
Cathy Lee Crosby stayed in

403
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:14,125
Garbage Good idea

404
00:29:14,193 --> 00:29:16,423
Columbo always
goes through the garbage

405
00:29:16,496 --> 00:29:18,760
Butterfinger Butterfinger

406
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:20,128
- Map
- Three Butterfingers

407
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,827
- Banana
- Map? Is anything circled?

408
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:26,167
- Telephone message
- Let me see

409
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:28,002
It's in Italian

410
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:30,508
We'll get somebody to read it
Let's go

411
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,748
This is a phone number in Rome

412
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,751
You'd like me to call this number
and what?

413
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,310
Ask for Damon Bradley

414
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:44,686
- Just ask, that's all
- Okay

415
00:29:44,757 --> 00:29:45,849
Thank you

416
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:49,751
And ask whoever answers
if they know Mr Bradley

417
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,421
Okay

418
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:53,624
- Or where we might find him
- Okay

419
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:58,503
I'd ask for him first
then go on to the other things

420
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:00,038
Okay!

421
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:09,708
Oh, my God
He's a priest?

422
00:30:09,782 --> 00:30:11,147
It's a store in Rome

423
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:31,000
He said some woman he works with
knows him

424
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,970
Her name's Anna

425
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,007
But she won't be in
till tomorrow

426
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:37,372
- Let's go Rome
- Rome?

427
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:39,377
Rome? Tomorrow?

428
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:43,541
Tomorrow is sciopero generale
Everybody will be on strike

429
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,050
Good luck

430
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:53,258
Everybody's on strike?
No planes, buses, trains?

431
00:30:53,326 --> 00:30:56,762
Nobody shows up for work?
What kind of country is this?

432
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,181
The point is, we've been
on the wrong road for an hour

433
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,275
No, no, no
The point is, we're looping

434
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:24,847
We looped back around to that freeway
or turnpike or whatever they call it

435
00:31:36,502 --> 00:31:38,436
- Which way do we loop?
- Right

436
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,006
Left Right

437
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:43,507
Kate!

438
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:08,600
I told you a liter
was less than a gallon

439
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,573
We would've had enough gas
it you hadn't gotten us lost

440
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:19,978
Besides, a kilometer
is less than a mile

441
00:32:20,046 --> 00:32:22,014
Right Less than a mile

442
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:25,517
So we should have been able
to cover more of them

443
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,090
This is great

444
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:50,041
I wonder what time it is
in Pittsburgh

445
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,853
Sorry I got us lost

446
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,894
I'm sorry I'm so edgy

447
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:13,398
I'm afraid we're losing him

448
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:26,511
I didn't tell him I was going
to the lake with the kids

449
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,014
I told him
I was leaving him

450
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,985
Leaving him?

451
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,422
I think he's having an affair

452
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:42,127
- How do you know? Did he say something?
- No

453
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,924
- Did you see him with her?
- No

454
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:46,931
- How do you know?
- I just know

455
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:55,868
Kate...

456
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:58,877
remember in junior high
when I had that Halloween party...

457
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:01,243
and we all played Twister?

458
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:03,509
You started to tall...

459
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,949
and instead of taking the spot...

460
00:34:06,018 --> 00:34:07,952
Larry reached out to catch you

461
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:13,017
He let you win
He never let anybody win

462
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,587
That's when I knew
he was head over heels

463
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:21,599
That was a long time ago

464
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,533
You know what I thought then?

465
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,698
I thought...

466
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:31,368
I hope someday I have somebody
who loves me that much

467
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:37,115
I know he loves you

468
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:42,312
I know he would kill tigers
for you

469
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:22,691
Okay, Mr Cronenworth
Let's check out this big guy here

470
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:24,286
He looks pretty good

471
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:30,632
This is a very simple procedure
Won't take but about five minutes

472
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:33,638
I'm just gonna make
a plaster mold of your foot

473
00:35:33,706 --> 00:35:35,640
Dwayne, I gotta talk to you

474
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:39,235
- Larry, I'm plastering a foot
- It'll just take a second Excuse me

475
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:41,609
- Where's Faith?
- At a teacher's conference

476
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,615
- Get out!
- Did she mention Kate?

477
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,015
- She talks about Kate all the time
- I think they're together

478
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:47,518
What?

479
00:35:48,587 --> 00:35:49,815
Kate left me

480
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,416
I got home and there was a note
saying "I'm leaving" That's it

481
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:56,552
- No explanation, no nothing
- Jesus What happened?

482
00:35:56,629 --> 00:36:00,656
She's been acting kinda weird lately
I should've seen it coming

483
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:03,429
Babbling on and on about communication
like I don't know how to communicate

484
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:05,436
Do you believe this woman?
I'm sorry

485
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,903
Sorry, Mr Cronenworth

486
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,008
- What did you do?
- Nothing

487
00:36:10,076 --> 00:36:11,907
That's what I'm saying

488
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,443
- Have you been fooling around?
- No Of course not

489
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:20,951
Where you get that crazy idea?

490
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,853
I've got to finish this foot mold
I will call you tonight

491
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:25,857
You hear anything
let me know

492
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:27,153
Good luck, sir

493
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:31,362
It's just my future
brother-in-law

494
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,057
Sorry about that

495
00:36:33,132 --> 00:36:35,896
This is going to be
a very nice mold

496
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:14,138
Taxi!

497
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:18,034
- Get in
- I got it Go, go

498
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:25,043
Not a monastery
It's a store

499
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,950
No priests
You know where that is?

500
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,887
- He knows where it is
- I'm just asking to make sure

501
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,892
I don't know why we had to return
the rental car I would've found it

502
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:44,902
We had to return the rental car
because you had us lost

503
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:49,002
- What?
- We're here already?

504
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:51,167
- I told you we were close
- Some trip

505
00:37:51,243 --> 00:37:52,676
Don't tip him

506
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:08,655
Oh, good

507
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:11,525
I'm looking for a woman
named Anna

508
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:13,531
I am Anna

509
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,728
Hi I'm Faith You don't know
how happy I am to meet you

510
00:38:18,804 --> 00:38:22,365
You see, I'm looking for somebody

511
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:25,467
Well, you-- might know him

513
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,786
You know him?

514
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,354
Okay, slow down
What's going on?

515
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:41,985
- What's she saying?
- Something about a pig

516
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:46,454
May I be of assistance?

517
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,124
Yes!

518
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,691
We're looking for somebody
named Damon Bradley

519
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:54,205
Yes Could you ask her
it she knows where we could find him?

520
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,818
He thinks she's going to meet him
at Galeassi Ristorante...

521
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,480
tonight at Piazza
Santa Maria Trastevere

522
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:13,486
But she has a prior commitment

523
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,026

You are looking tor
a place to stay, no?

527
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:24,562
Yeah, as a matter of fact

528
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:27,697
Perhaps I can help

00:39:27,773 --> 00:39:30,173

- Let's go
- Faith

533
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,081
What?

534
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:44,249
I'm tired I'm hung over
I haven't eaten or slept for two days

535
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:46,257
So back oft
I want a room

536
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:52,756
- You were saying?
- It's this beautiful pensione

537
00:39:52,831 --> 00:39:54,765

539
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,883
It's beautiful

540
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,387
It's like the Trevi fountain

541
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,465
Listen, Kate
I must leave town for two days

542
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:30,798
I must go to my other shop in Milano
It was unavoidable

543
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:33,895
But the day after tomorrow
I return...

you'll still be here

Faith, whatever happens tonight
you're gonna be okay

546
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:47,403
Why couldn't we just have
arranged marriages in America?

547
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:51,415
Then you could spend your lite blaming
your parents instead of yourself

548
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,108
Go on up there and ask the maitre d'
if he's here I'll wait

00:42:19,178 --> 00:42:22,113
There he is The maitre d'
Go ask him Go on

if maybe he'd notice me first

551

- I wanted to see it--
- Yeah, I heard you, Faith

554
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,364

555
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,926

00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,504
you can see part of his left elbow

565
00:43:30,716 --> 00:43:32,809
Oh! I can see his sleeve!

566
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,621
Very exciting Progress
This is good

567
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,325
I guess I should just
go introduce myself, huh?

568
00:43:41,393 --> 00:43:45,261
You've traveled 4,000 miles
What's 15 more feet, right?

569
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,431
This is it!

570
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:18,189

00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:30,138
Kate!

573
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,467
What happened?
Are you okay?

574
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:12,237
Where's your shoe?

575
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,245
- I don't know
- Okay, okay

576
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,746
Sit down

577
00:46:17,215 --> 00:46:18,876
Everything's okay

578
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:22,283
- You can't say we didn't try, right?
- Right

579
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:28,485
- Here's what I think
- What?

580
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,825
We rent a truck or a car
either one...

581
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:35,833
we set up a loudspeaker
drive through the surrounding areas...

582
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:37,664
and page him

583
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:42,335
- Oh How nice
- Yes

584
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:44,102
Oh Americans

00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,441
So, what do you think?

00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,785
It's kinda sweet, huh?

588
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:58,322
I meant about my idea

589
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:02,793
Oh Well, I think it's time
we got some professional help

590
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,955
- Like a detective
- Like a psychiatrist

591
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,022
How's a psychiatrist
going to tind him?

592
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,567

00:47:10,635 --> 00:47:12,068

8-B?

597
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:22,447
Well, it's my lite

598
00:47:22,514 --> 00:47:26,348
In the shoe biz, the foot is our naked
canvas I could tell you some things

599
00:47:26,418 --> 00:47:30,149
For instance, this is a Stephane Kelian
knockoff made in Jersey

600
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,156
I know the family
Good quality control

601
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,660
It's impetuous, fun, elegant

602
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,661
Not much for cross-training

603
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,495
I hope it brings you to whatever it was
you were running after just now

604
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:43,500
Her destiny

605
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:47,571

She's looking for the man of her dreams
He's around here someplace

611
00:47:59,117 --> 00:48:02,450
She's never met him, never seen him
If you consider that all right

612
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:08,052
Well, it she's never met him

613
00:48:08,126 --> 00:48:10,321
Oh, I don't know

- He's some kind of celebrity, right?

615
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:14,665
Is he a hero, a mentor?

00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:17,793
No, she got his name
oft a Ouija board when she was 11

617
00:48:18,637 --> 00:48:20,161

Yes, I'm here
I'm very real

642
00:49:59,738 --> 00:50:03,697
What am I trying to think ot?
There's this poem by Goethe

643
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:05,072
Yeah, Goethe

644
00:50:05,143 --> 00:50:07,577
It's about two people
who come from different places...

645
00:50:07,646 --> 00:50:09,580
but they hear
the same bird singing

646
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:12,981
"Perhaps the same bird
echoed through both of us yesterday...

647
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,315
separate, in the evening"

648
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,116
That's it Exactly

649
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:19,622
Wow

650
00:50:22,093 --> 00:50:24,789
Yeah it was Rilke

651
00:50:24,863 --> 00:50:26,922
Rilke Oh

652
00:50:26,998 --> 00:50:29,330
Well, same country

653
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,062
How'd you know that?

654
00:50:31,136 --> 00:50:34,071
I could tell you some things

655
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:11,402
Some enchanted evening

656
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:16,414
You may see a stranger

657
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:20,149
You may see a stranger

658
00:51:20,218 --> 00:51:24,518
Across a crowded room

659
00:51:55,253 --> 00:51:57,187
I love trees

660
00:51:58,456 --> 00:52:01,789
I could do nothing for the rest
of my lite, just grow trees

661
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:06,421
The ancients believed that gods
dwelled in them Did you know that?

662
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:10,659
Maybe they're watching us now
