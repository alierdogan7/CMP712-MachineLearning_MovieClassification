1
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,846
You move over.

2
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,089
Hey, this is Luke. This is my film.
Let me ask you a couple of questions.

3
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,690
Why do you dance?

4
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,246
Because it's like breathing,
it's like walking to me.

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,282
|'m not pretending.
When I dance I don't pretend.

6
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,324
I'm more myself when I dance
than any other moment of the day.

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,443
I dance to become someone else.

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,802
There are so many things in this world
that want to push down on you,

9
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,126
but when you dance you are free.

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,529
We started dancing at the age of seven
in our house, in the living room.

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,404
Just dancing, dancing,
copying Michael Jackson.

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,966
And I'm just like listening to the music
in the grocery store,

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,207
just like dancing through the aisles
and stuff like that,

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,242
and she's like,
"Contain yourself, calm down."

15
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,965
And I'm like, "I oan't stop,
I have to do it, I have to do it."

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,289
After everybody went to sleep I would
open the garage and just practise.

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,006
That's pretty much when I knew
I loved it because I had never dedicated

18
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,202
so much time and effort
into something like that.

19
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,720
It's not us just jumping around.
Dance has vocabulary.

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,250
- Inglewood.
- I'm from Argentina.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,406
I'm from northern Uganda.

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,010
- |\/Iiami, Florida.
- Koreatovvn, Los Angeles.

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,565
There's a lot of gangs and violence.

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,965
I couldn't be stuck there all my life.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,887
My village was attacked.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,649
My parents didn't even want me
around any more.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,045
She actually kicked me out of the house.

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,809
- I had to go.
- Dance saved me.

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,285
Dance definitely saved me.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,561
If it wasn't for dance,
I don't know what we'd be doing right now.

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,886
I didn't have anything,
I didn't have money.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,844
I was living with $15 a week
in New York City.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,645
Dance brought us together too,
all around the world. We're here.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,569
Truth is everybody is a dancer inside.

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,647
We all have a heartbeat.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,206
We all have a rhythm inside.
Boom-boom, boom-boom.

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,005
- VVhat's that one thing you say?
- Yeah, what do you call us?

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,610
- (Luke) Born from a boombox?
- Yes.

39
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,211
- Born from a boombox.
- That's pretty good.

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,366
Born from a boombox.

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,006
(Luke) It sounds stupid,
but I do feel like that.

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,610
And if we listen hard enough,

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,883
we realise that maybe we’re all
plugged into the same song.

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,763
(J' Dance music)

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,088
New York University freshmen,
welcome to Washington Square Park.

46
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,045
It's the central hub of our urban campus,
and to the right...

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,880
Mom? Dad? You guys can really go.

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,002
No! VVe're gonna take you
and Camille out for dinner.

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,610
We promised her parents we'd feed her.

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,483
VVe're already paying for our meal plans.
It's all good.

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,045
Yeah, we're fine, we really are, lVlrs A.

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,809
- We should go.
- All right. One last picture.

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,691
Get together, you're best friends,
you could drive a truck through you.

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,451
- VVe're close.
- Get closer! Put your arm around her.

55
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,925
- OK.
- Good boy.

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,167
All right. Ready? Say, "|\/Iom is pretty."

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,043
- (Both) |\/Iom is pretty.
- Thank you.

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,650
(Laughs) Ready? And... Oop.

59
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,287
Oh. Look at this. Picture of a hat.
I got a hat with hair.

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,370
If my father could see me now saying
goodbye to my son, a future engineer...

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,131
|'m just so happy you're done
with that dance business, I can't tell you.

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,366
Oh, but you have...

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,370
- OK, all right. You make me proud.
- OK. This is it.

64
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,970
Could I get in your backpack? Come on.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,321
- That's too tight. OK. All right.
- Come on.

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,362
I'll make you proud
if I could just go to orientation.

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,607
- No! You're my baby.
- Everybody left already.

68
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,211
- All right. OK.
- I'll call you when I get to the dorm.

69
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,208
- Wear deodorant, deodorant. Every day.
- Come on.

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,730
- OK, honey? It's important.
- Come on, honey.

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,762
- Cos you're a man now.
- Honey, we got to beat the traffic.

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,926
All right.

73
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,964
- Wow! They really...
- Are embarrassing.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,480
- I was gonna say "love you".
- Sorry.

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,684
Hey, Cam, check those out.

76
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,610
Those are the limited edition
gunmetal Nike Dunks.

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,441
Uh-oh. I know that look. OK, |\/loose,
seriously, next on the tour, Union Square.

78
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,166
I just wanna get a closer look.
I'm gonna be right back. OK? Cover me.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,645
I guess.

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,850

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,803
(J' NASA: Vbfhatohadoin?)

82
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,049
(Bookie) All right, let's go, who you got?

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,402
- I want 25 on Kid Darkness.
- 25 on Darkness, let's go, let's go.

84
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,129
(Cheering)

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,929
- Give my money.
- Sorry, guy, I got you.

86
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,088
Oh, snap! Did you see that?

87
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,484
Yo, I want ten on the skinny kid.

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,125
Give me 20.

89
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,567
Give me that 20.

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,210
Yo, you see that?

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,571
Oh, vvhoo-hoo-hoo!

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,483
It's over, it's over, that's it!

93
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,204
Go home! Go home!

94
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,043
Come on, new kid, get in there!

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,649
Come on, let's see what you got.

96
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,842
I think we're done here.

97
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,484
He ain't got no flava.

98
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,205
- Yo, look at the kid!
- He moves pretty good for a geek.

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,811
Buddy, that kid is real!
Been holding out!

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,602
I didn't know that dude
could dance like that.

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,768
Let's go, new kid,
let's see what you got.

102
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,167
Hey, you give me five on that.
Give me five on that.

103
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,405
Let's go, Darkness!

104
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,003

105
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,046

107

VVho's gonna pay for my balloons?
Hey, he's right here!

111
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,648
- Get this guy.
- Stop! Police! Hold it right there!

112
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,445
Come on, man. They're after you.
Go. Come on!

113
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,844
Come on, kid.

114
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,120
Come on, let's go.

115
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,730
All right, man, time-out. I can't.

116
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,649
We don't have time for that. Come on!

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,808
- Police!
- Get out of the way!

118
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,169
What are you doing? What are you doing?

119
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,770
Jump first, fear later.

120
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,806
VVhoa.

121
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,207
- Get out of the way!
- (Luke) Come on, come on!

122
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,087
(Moose) Excuse me!

123
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,043
Out of the way! Out of the way, folks.

124
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,084

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,651
How did you just do that back there?

130
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,889
I mean, you were like freaking flying, man.
You're like a ninja.

131

- Luke.
- No, it's like this. You gotta blow it up.

00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,963
How's that?

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,161
All right.

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,521

by the way.

137

But you can just call me |\/loose.

- I haven't seen you around.
- I'm just starting at NYU.

140
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,440
- I'm actually an engineering major.
- But you're gonna be dancing too.

141
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,925
No, no, no, not any more.

142
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,203
I mean, dancing was cool in high school,
but it's time for me to face the real world.

143
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,642
You really have no idea
what you did back there, do you?

144
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,160
- You're B-FAB.
- VVhat's a B-FAB?

145
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,123
- Born from a boombox.
- (Laughs)

146
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,369
Like, some people learn to dance,
others are born to.

147
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,926
And you're in New York City,
the dance centre of the world.

148
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,403
Check this.

149
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,961
It's the biggest battle ever.
There's never been this kind of prize money.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,207
And those guys in the park,
they're gearing up for this.

151
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,925
You're good enough.
You should be in this.

152
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,571
(Moose) This your oar?

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,444
Oh, my God, that's so sick!

154
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,369
Get in.

155
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,085
What you saw in the park today
is just the beginning.

- Come on.

downstairs to make ends meet.

168
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,281
Around here, dance is your identity.

169
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,971
We live together, work together,
battle together.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,890
But unlike other crews,
we all have different styles.

171
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,686
I found all these guys out in the city.
Crazy talent but no place to go.

172
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,368
VVe've become kind of a pseudo family here

173
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,402
where we can be ourselves
and rules don't apply.

174
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,569
This place is off the chain.

175
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,524
Thing 1 and Thing 2 over there,
that's the Santiago twins.

176
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,689
You, man, you... We saw you dancing
at the park this morning. You were...

177
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,848
- Amazing!
- You are from another planet.

178
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,327
- Your own planet! You're amazing, man.
-I have a question...

179
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,523
No, no, no, guys. Come on. No questions.
I gotta show him around.

180
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,449
Got it! Come on.

181
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,481
You're great!

182
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,488
- Luke.
- Jacob!

183
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,124
VVhat's up, brother?

184
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,447
- Meet |\/loose.
- Pleased to meet you, |\/loose.

185
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,767
This guy right here,
he's the captain of the ship.

186
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,566
|\/lore like the first mate. I heard you did
some impressive work in the park today.

187
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,840
How does everybody know that?

188
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,486
News travels fast when you beat someone
like Kid Darkness.

189
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,364
But, Luke, I need to borrow you
for one second. VVe've got some things...

190
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,846
- Can we wait? I've got to show him around.
- VVe'II take him.

191
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,006
Let us show him around.

192
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,804
- I don't know about that, guys.
- Please!

193
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,649
- Please. What would Jesus do?
- Come on.

194
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,088
- All right. Don't hurt him, all right?
- Promise.

195
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,361
|\/loose, this is the Ticks. Good luck.

196
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,801
(Excited chatter)

197
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,081
This came from the bank today.

198
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,804
VVe're six months late on our payments.

199
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,286
- VVe paid them last month.
- What about the other five?

200
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,641
We're working on it.
The c|ub's not making the money it used to.

201
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,001
The bank doesn't want to hear that.

202
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,328
If they don't get the money they're going
to put the Vault up for public auction.

203
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,761
Listen, don't I always have a plan?

204
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,486
This kid, |\/loose, he beat Kid Darkness
today, and he did it with style.

205
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,171
VVith a little bit of training,
he could be the spark that we need

206
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,602
to win the hundred grand from
the World Jam and pay back what we ovve.

207
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,043
Jacob, we're not gonna lose the Vault,
all right? We vvon't let that happen.

208
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,323
(Tick 2) You don't understand. Nobody ever
smoked Kid Darkness and got it on tape.

209
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,885
(Pirates) VVhoo!

210
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,843
- That was serious.
- You're the man.

211
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,882
You think the Samurais
are gonna let you go like that?

212
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,127
They'II find you and they'll batter you again.

213
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,049
- Sam who?
- The House of Samurai.

214
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,844
The most cut-throat house in the city.

215
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,689
- Our fiercest rival.
- Yeah.

216
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,131
They're gonna find me?

217
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,164
They got technology out there,
like the bears with a little GPS inside.

218
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,407
- Watch out, they're right behind you!
- (Laughter)

219
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,966
Come on, that's enough.
Don't let them freak you out.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,480
- You're with us now.
- And nobody messes with us.

221
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,046

225
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,524
- What?
- OK, you don't get it

226
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,767
but I know what I'm saying.

227

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,841
(Twins) You got it.

229

- That's not boring.

(Chatter continues)

231
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,127
She's back.
The one I've been telling you about.

232
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,248
Hey, Nloose. Come on,
I'll show you round the club downstairs.

233
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,329
- Party pooper!
- (Tick 3) Come on, Luke.

234
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,764

Bubbles and balloons? That's so amateur.

Enough, man. He will finish it
at the World Jam and so will vve.

For bed?

299
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,085
No, for the battle. The World Jam?
We could really use someone like you.

300
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,602
- Are you up for a little competition?
- It's what I live for.

- Been competing my whole life.
- Do you win?

302

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,121

- I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

307
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,411
I had to eat dinner with my freakazoid
roommate who smells so badly.

308
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,728
And she would not stop yammering
about her pet rat's blog.

309
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,001
We should hook our roommates
up together.

He's got the nose and everything,

- he's got, like, the claws. Ugh!
- (Laughs)

this engineering lab.

- What?

(Sighs)

316
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,529

- I don't know. I really don't.

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,368

323
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,402

find boomboxes in the city.

OK. Then where?

329
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,410
Out there.

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,251
I wanna talk to you about,
well, what engineering means to me.

334
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,926
VVhat's your name?

335
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,167
(Teacher) And what hopefully engineering
will mean to you.

336
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,362
Silence, that's my name.

337
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,131
- Silence during class.
- (Teacher) Second of all...

338
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,082
(Phone ringing)

339
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,407
Go answer it, Mr Popular.

340
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,005
(Laughs) What?

341
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,250
Open up the cages, boys. Show these
newbies why we call this the Vault.

342
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,123
(Twin 1) OK.
(Both) Hey.

343
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,481
Moose boy. How are you, my friend?

344
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,205
- Oh. What a beautiful seiorita.
- Por favor.

345
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,366
Nice to meet you.

346
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,567
- Can I give you two?
- (Laughs)

347
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,567
Come on.

348
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,728
- You gonna get mad at me?
- I'm not gonna get mad at you.

349
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,649
I'm just saying hi to her, man.

350
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,887
- I'm introducing myself.
- No, no, no.

351
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,003
You stopped me when I'm introducing
myself to this beautiful...

352
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,281
- Don't listen to him. Don't listen.
- You are so cute.

353
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,322
- (Both speak Spanish)
- OK.

354
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,371
Ladies and gentlemen,
our most prized possessions.

355
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,889
Check it out.

356
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,527
(Twin 2) If dance is our weapon,
then this is our armour.

357
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,722
These are the most beautiful shoes
in the world.

358
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,401
- The way they smell, the way they fit.
- (Twin 1) You're sounding like a girl, man.

359
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,124
You're like, "I love the shoes."

360
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,767
You gotta say, "I love the shoes,"
like a macho man. OK, bro.

361
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,371
Luke's lucky shoes? Smart boy.

362
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,927
(Luke) OK, |\/loose, don't get too attached,
you gotta earn your kicks in this house.

363
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,890
And beyond door number two,
the Graffiti room.

364
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,887
Oh, what?

365
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,287
- VVho's that guy?
- That? That's Jason.

366
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,370
He's our graffiti guru. I'm talking
electronic billboard hacks, LED lights,

367
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,606
anything to mark who we are.

368
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,690
Dudes! Excellent timing. I have been
working on a portable light tagging system

369
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,291
and I can't figure out howto get it to stick
to 12V batteries...

370
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,130
- You got any electrical tape?
- Yeah, there you go.

371
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,243
Tape it right there, wrap it round
and it creates a snug fit.

372
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,408
- You know lights?
- Yeah, I dabble.

373
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,329
Check it out.

374
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,368
You... Yes! Yes! I love this kid!

375
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,846
Fix the LED to the battery to the magnet.

376
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,565
They're beautiful.
Like neon fireflies.

377
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,367
- Neoflies.
- Yeah, neoflies.

378
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,243
Neoflies. I like it.

379
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,290
(Chatter)

380
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,731
Cool. Check it out.

381
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,411
Yeah, we could do something with this.

382
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,325
- (Carlos whistles)
- Neoflies.

383
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,364
Listen up. World Jam
is right around the corner,

384
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,722
but to get there, we got to get through
the two qualifying rounds, which means...

385
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,650
Which means
we got a lot of work cut out for us.

386
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,967
|\/loose, Natalie. Are you guys in?

387
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,525
(Plays suspenseful music)

388
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,970
Erm...

389
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,048
I don't know,
I mean, I have to go to school...

390
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,491
VVe'|| figure something out.

391
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,285
Pirates... Pirates...

392
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,042
(Chanting) Pirates! Pirates! Pirates!

393
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,811
- I can do one battle, guys.
- (Cheering)

394
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,490
All right, all right. Natalie?

395
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,681
House of Pirates!

396
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,245
(Cheering)

397
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,203
(J' Chromeo: Fancy Footwork)

398
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,921
(He laughs)

399
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,163
(Twin 2) Go, go, go, go, go.

400
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,967
(Tick) Owvvw!

401
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,641
VVhoo!

402
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,247
Yeah!

403
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,161
VVhoo!

404
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,926
Whoo-hoo!

405
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,807
(Anala) I’m more of myself when
I dance than any other moment of the day.

406
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,320
(Vlado) I dance to become someone else.

407
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,802
(Jacob) They always think that we are just
a bunch of kids with no direction,

408
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,049
but what we do is very hard.
We make it look easy.

409
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,289
You spin and your equilibrium is off
and you stand up,

410
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,847
and all you have to rely on
is how well you know your body

411
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,487
and you place your Iwo feet on the Hoon
Ending your horizon within yourself

412
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,249
- Wow.
- Hey.

413
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,123
- This is quite the setup.
- Thanks.

414
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,288
I collect footage of dancers who inspire me.

415
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,602
Clearly. (Laughs)

416
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,086
What are you gonna do with it all?

417
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,486
I don't know. Nothing.
I just play around with it.

418
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,363
(Jason beatboxing)

419
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,009
Check this out... Check...

420
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,963
Check-check...

421
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,365
I dance...dance...

422
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,164
"become someone else.

423
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,804
We were born...

424
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,569
b-b-born from a boombox.

425
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,410
-I had no idea.
- They're amazing, aren't they?

426
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,165
I mean you.

427
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,248
You're a film-maker.

428
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,561
- VVhat's wrong?
- Nothing, I...

429
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,250
usually don't show people this stuff.

430
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,202
It's just me.

431
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,287
All right.

432
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,163
- You're gonna show me?
- Yeah.

433
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,123
OK.

434
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,323
- Promise not to laugh?
- Oh, I promise.

435
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,681
..or to choose a hobby,
or something like that.

436
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,008
It’s another thing for that thing
to choose you.

437
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,721
- (Laughter)
- Jitterbug... Booty shake!

438
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,841
- Yes!
- OK, OK.

439
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,406
This is... This is our teacher in fifth grade.

440
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,488
- Face-lift!
- Yes!

441
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,488
Go. What are you?

442
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,682
- Raptor!
- Yes!

443
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,000
VVhoo!

444
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,329
How do you guys even do that?

445
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,886
We can read each other's minds.

446
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,049
Aw, you guys are so cute.
How long have you been dating?

447
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,367
- Oh. No, no, no. It's not like that.
- (Phone rings)

448
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,641
VVe're justmfriends.

449
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,841
(Clears throat) No.

450
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,965
- Correction, everyone. We're best friends.
- (Both) Aw.

451
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,446
Anyvvay, sorry, guys,
I have to go, I'm in a rush.

452
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,166
- You're leaving? We just started.
- I'll call you later, though. Have fun.

453
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,565
You guys lost.

454
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,250
(Girls) Whatever!

455
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,611
Uh... OK...

456
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,281
Gotcha.

457
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,887
Oh, wow. It's so obvious,
it makes so much sense now.

458
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,207
- What?
- You're totally in love with him, aren't you?

459
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,005
- No! No, no, no. It's...
- Yes, yes, yes.

460
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,724
_.not like that, we're just...

461
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,526
Like, one of those, we grew up together.
No, that would be really weird.

462
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,680
Um... (Clears throat)

463
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,085
I think it's your turn.

464
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,167
-So...
-Me?

465
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,089
Yeah, you're up. You're up.

466
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,440
- OK.
- You go first.

467
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,450
Um... Squirrel. Kangaroo?

468
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,286
Keep trying.

469
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,882
Hey. Look who's up early now.

470
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,082
Actually, I haven't been to sleep yet.

471
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,487
- Can I join you?
- Sure.

472
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,125
- What are you looking at?
- I come out here to listen.

473
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,321
The river, the traffic, the birds.

474
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,365
Make me feel like
|'m part of something bigger.

475
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,246
Traffic makes you feel like
you're a part of something bigger?

476
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,009
That is deep.

477
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,361
Like I said, I've been up all night.

478
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,323
So I've been thinking about your video
from last night.

479
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,046
Like, I think you should finish it.
And you should show it to people.

480
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,445
- Yeah, I don't know about that.
- Clearly you love it, right?

481
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,449
Look at you, you've been up all night
and you're like...

482
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,563
I don't know,
you're glowing or something.

483
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,129
I see a glow.

484
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,610
We should get to Red Hook.

485
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,925

504
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,684
(Crowd cheering)

505
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,490
Back up.

506
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,000
And the winner is...

507
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,690
the Pirates!

508
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,205
The Pirates are now into the next round

509
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,846
of the World Jam!

510
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,005
(Crowd chants) Pirates! Pirates! Pirates!

511
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,601
(Luke) No, no, no.
(Twin 1) Yeah. Yeah!

512
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,725
Now it's time for you to be in front
of the camera, my good-looking Pirate.

513
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,683
Do you want some make-up, baby?

514
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,643
(Laughter)

515
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,602
- (Natalie) So, Captain Luke...
- Gimme the camera.

516
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,325
- (Twins) No, no, no.
- It's not that easy on this side, huh?

517
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,523
- It's uncomfortable.
- (Luke) Yeah, why don't you keep walking?

518
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,006
- (Jason) Oh, look at this guy.
- (Natalie laughs)

519
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,963
What do you love about dance?

520
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,927
I don't know. Dance music,
it's just always been there for me, I guess.

521
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,443
(Natalie) Is that it?

522
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,449
What? (Laughs)

523
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,369
(Laughs) I know you can do better than that.

524
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,843
My parents used to be dancers.

525
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,770
And they started this place
for people like them,

526
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,371
but that didn't just want to be
backup dancers.

527
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,047
You know, do their own thing,
build their own respect.

528
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,930
I thought that was cool, so I wanted
to carry on the tradition, in my own way,

529
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,883
but for them, you know?

530
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,086
So what do they think of you
turning this place into a madhouse?

531
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,483
They never got to see it.

532
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,925
I'm so sorry.

533
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,327
No, don't be. It's OK.

534
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,687
So that's why you're
so devoted to this place,

535
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,245
carrying on what your parents wanted?

536
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,851
Family is family, you know?

537
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,326
The Vault used to be their life,
and now it's mine.

538
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,126
It's amazing what we do for family
sometimes.

539
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,810
So, tell me about your parents.

540
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,046
(Laughs)

541
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,287
They split up a while back.

542
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,769
And me and my older brother, we were sort
of the dice that got rolled between them.

543
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,404
VVhere's your brother now?

544
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,728
We're still close.
I mean, he pretty much raised me.

545
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,127
So I owe him everything.

546
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,209
So, Tarantino, are you planning on
blackmailing us with all that footage?

547
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,685
No.

548
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,131
Just you.

549
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,245
Hi. So, I'm sorry for being late, OK?
I won't...

550
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,442
Oh! I'm so sorry.

551
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,687
I thought you were somebody else.
I'm sorry.

552
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,763
- OK...
- (Girls chatting)

553
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,121
- Do you know that trick when they take...
- Really?

554
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,448
They kinda look alike,
I think they're twins.

555
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,245
Camille! VVhat's going on?
I thought we had lunch.

556
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,805
Is it lunch time?

557
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,171
VVhoa! Um...

558
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,409
Wow, we got so carried away
with the costumes, I lost track oftime.

559
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,930
Costumes for what?

560
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,170
It's for the dorm Halloween party. People
plan their costumes like all semester.

561
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,487
All right. So what are we going to go as?

562
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,726
Oh, um...

563
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,285
VVe||, actually...

564
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,368
I tried calling you but you didn't pick up,

565
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,927
so Kristin and I are gonna be
the Olsen Twins.

566
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,244
VVait, wait, wait. Kristin?

567
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,290
Kristin?

568
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,322
Camille, Kristin?

569
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,322
What about |\/loose?

570
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,123
Go ahead, you guys.

571
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,965
You haven't exactly been around lately.

572
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,890
I mean, I couldn't wait forever.

573
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,085
OK, well, hey, Camille,
look, I'm here now.

574
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,004
Come on, what do you say?

575
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,249
You know you're gonna have
way more fun with me than...

576
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,327
Kristin.

577
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,001
Are you asking me to the dance?

578
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,169
(Scoffs)

579
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,888
Camillian? You know that I was born
to be the Ashley to your |\/Iary-Kate.

580
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,127
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

581
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,807
OK, OK, fine.

582
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,127
- I'll cancel with Kristin.
- Yes!

583
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,121
I'll see you later.

584
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,481
Guess I'll see you later, then.
Get back to your frie...

585
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,491
- Hey, Kristin! In your face!
- Bye.

586
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,247
(Luke) OK, you gotta stop complaining.
(Natalie) I'm sorry.

587
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,250
I just feel ridiculous holding this giant cup.

588
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,649
Whoever said it was OK to have a small,
medium, large and then ginormous?

589
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,966
Hey, look.

590
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,127
- That's you.
- What are you talking about?

591
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,242
- This guy looks exactly like you.
- He doesn't.

592
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,250
He's got a camera popping out of his head,
pretty little cheekbones.

593
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,727
It does not look like me, and I would not
be caught dead with those culture vultures.

594
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,843
I've seen your work,
and you don't fool me.

595
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,770
Yeah, but it's just for fun.
It's nothing professional.

596
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,929
VVell, what if the Pirates
and the rivalry didn't exist?

597
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,928
VVou|dn't you give your film-making a shot?

598
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,361
That film academy sounds amazing.

599
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,927
Yeah, but it's not an option,
so I don't think about it.

600
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,883
The World Jam's our main focus.

601
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,288
- OK, so, tell me, then, how do you do it?
- Do what?

602
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,607
Get all your amazing footage.

603
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,803
I don't know. I just try to see things
that people don't normally see.

604
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,323
Show me.

605
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,241
All right, come here.

606
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,486
(Natalie laughs)

607
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,170
Where are you taking me?

608
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,521
(Luke) Just trust me. Come on.

609
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,801
- Hurry up.
- All right.

610
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,203
(J' Laza Morgan: This Girl)

611
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,362
- Just wait for it.
- For what?

612
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,886
- VVhat? (Laughs)
- Watch this.

613
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,208
How did you do that? I'm going to do it.

614
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,526
- OK.
- Try it.

615
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,721
OK.

616
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,361
See that? I did it!

617
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,609
- There's Slurpee everywhere!
- (Laughs)

618
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,320
Oh, my God, my straw! I lost my straw!

619
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,169
I think it was just being in my living room,

620
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,205
and me and my brother
were just playing around together

621
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,847
- and I always tried to...
- (Phone ringing)

622
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,803
_.match him.

623
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,729
- |\/loose.
- Yo. Hey, what time is the battle, again?

624
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,809
- Eight o'c|ock. Why? You ready for it?
- Eight o'c|ock?

625
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,969
It all goes down in Chinatown.
This is the House of Gwai.

626
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,571
They’re champions of Asia,
so I hope you’re prepared.

627
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,571
- VVe've got a problem.
- No, this is round two. You gotta be there.

628
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,524
We can’t have any missing links or we
could get eliminated from the World Jam.

629
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,087
I know, I know.
I have a test on the same exact day.

630
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,485
I don't know if I can...

631
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,525
Listen, we need you.
Do whatever you can to make it work.

632
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,647
(Teacher) I'm sure I don't need to
remind you how much this test counts.

633
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,650
This is worth 25 per cent of your grade.

634
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,524
Take your time. You may begin.

635
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,891
(Phone vibrates)

636
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,244
(Cheering)

637
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,291
- Yo, where's Moose at?
- I don't know, man.

638
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,803
(J' Nladoon: Beggin')

639
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,482
- Show me something.
- (Speaks Spanish)

640
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,451
(Cheering)

641
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,248
(Cheering)

642
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,404
(Cheering)

643
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,404
(Shouting)

644
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,767
I'll go get a towel. I'll be right back.

645
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,049
Where you been, bro?
You just ruined the floor.

646
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,724
(Cheering)

647
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,967
(Screams)

648
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,365
(Groaning, jeers)

649
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,650
(Cheering)

650
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,322
What? What?

651
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,283
(Cheering)

652
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,685
You the man.

653
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,324
(Announcer speaking
in foreign language)

654
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,690
(Singing
Hit I\/Ie With Your Best Shot)

655
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,327
VVhoo!

656
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,161
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

657
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,321
- Alone?
- Yeah, hold on.

658
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,001
Yo, hold up. Cut the music.

659
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,530
- Cut the music.
- (Music stops)

660
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,483
You guys need to see this.

661
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,167
(Tick 1) What is this?
(Anala) Our entire routine.

662
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,601
(Twin 1) It's online?
(Jason) They know our whole set.

663
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,961
- Who would do that?
- Julien and the Samurai.

664
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,890
- How could they get our rehearsal footage?
- Does everyone have their DVDS?

665
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,684
- You have the DVD?
- Yeah, I put them in the room.

666
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,770
(Luke) VVe're still in this, all right?
We just got to figure something out.

667
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,805
OK, see there? If you could just let go
of that spin, we can land this thing.

668
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,322
Those guys may have our tapes,
but that won't stop us. Trust me.

669
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,642
Luke, I don't know.
Maybe somebody else should do it.

670
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,844
If we pull this off, we'll kill it on stage.
Julien won't even know what hit him.

671
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,567
Whatever happened between you two?

672
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,523
I\/Ie and Julien?

673
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,962
He used to be a Pirate.
We used to be best friends back in the day.

674
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,002
But as time went on, things changed.

675
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,883
How do you mean, they changed?

676
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,570
We found out he had a gambling problem.

677
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,924
He wound up in debt. He bet against our
house and threw the battle to win the bet.

678
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,962
He threw a battle to win a bet?

679
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,721
The whole house was devastated,
so we had to kick him out.

680
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,603
He's been trying to take us down
ever since.

681
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,486
The crazy thing is, if we don't win
the World Jam he could actually do it.

682
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,403
Hey.

683
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,606
- Welcome home.
- You lied to me.

684
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,370
You told me Luke kicked you out
because he was jealous.

685
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,244
But it wasn't that, was it?
You threw a battle for a bet?

686
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,409
- Natalie...
- Don't! I went in there for you, Julien.

687
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,761
I can't believe you stole that DVD
and put it online.

688
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,724
What are you talking about?
VVhat kind of BS did he say about me novv?

689
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,082
Luke was jealous. He wanted to be
the leader, so he kicked me out.

690
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,043
He used me and he kicked me out.

691
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,001
I'm sorry.

692
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,520
We have to stick together,
Natalie, you know that.

693
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,927
I don't like to be lied to.

694
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,806
I just want our house
to win the World Jam. OK?

695
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,411
We have too much in this.
VVe've worked too hard.

696
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,649
Despite what |\/Iom and Dad say,
it doesn't always have to be about winning.

697
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,651
You're starting to sound like him. You need
to remember whose side you're on.

698
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,330
Friggin' ridiculous!

699
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,283
Luke isn't some monster, Julien.

700
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,051
He's a good guy.
He takes care of the people that he loves.

701
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,560
Who are you going to believe?
Him or your family?

702
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,170
You're going to talk to me about family?

703
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,124
When Luke isn't even related to any of
those dancers, he would never lie to them.

704
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,846
Oh. |'m a liar? What about you?

705
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,848
How do you think your precious Luke

706
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,884
is going to feel when he finds out
that you have been playing him?

707
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,764
Actually, now that I think of it...

708
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,245
you should come clean.

709
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,806
That might be what I need
to throw his game off for World Jam.

710
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,571
Thanks, sis. You really helped me.

711
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,561
You're not putting him out on the streets
over some stupid rivalry.

712
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,963
I will not be part of it.

713
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,646
Jacob. You scared me.

714
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,047
You don't seem like a girl
that's easily scared.

715
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,845
Tell Luke I'm sorry.

716
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,360
You have a choice, you know?

717
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,965
It's not that easy.

718
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,924
The most important decisions in life
are never easy.

719
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,042
(Jason) Dance can reveal a lot
about a person,

720
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,765
the way they move,
the way they learn new steps.

721
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,089
Imean, if you’re dancing for real, it comes
from the most truthful part of your soul.

722
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,566
I dance to express how I feel inside,

723
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,490
whether it's anger, happiness,

724
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,965
loneliness.

725
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,446
Once I found the Vault,
it was like coming home.

726
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,724
This is where I feel safe.
This is where I belong.

727
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,444
This is where my family is.

728
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,369
This place is special. It's our world.

729
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,688
I think, finally,
I had somewhere I could be myself.

730
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,963
People say that you don't
really choose your family. We did.

731
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,651
- If you are one of us, Luke will find you.
- Yeah.

732
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,009
- Luke.
- Why would she just leave like this?

733
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,806
I don't know. But for the moment,
we've got bigger problems than that.

734
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,802
The bank's put our house up for auction.

735
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,842
- What?
- They're selling it.

736
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,086
I'm going to deal with this, all right?

737
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,922
- VVhat the hell, Vvalter?
- Hey, Luke. How are you? Sit down.

738
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,530
I don't want to sit down.

739
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,164
I understand how hard this must be.

740
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,567
If you can just wait a few days,
we'll have the money.

741
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,409
You're five months behind
on your mortgage.

742
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,044
Unless you catch up with your payments,

743
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,481
I'm afraid there's nothing more
I can do for you.

744
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,284
The warehouse sits on prime property.

745
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,687
The bank is well aware
what it's going to go for at auction.

746
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,849
- I need more time.
- I'll see if I can suspend the foreclosure.

747
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,008
But don't get your hopes up.

748
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,486
They could take
your warehouse today, Luke.

749
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,251
That's not gonna happen
cos it's not for sale.

750
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,728
What does it mean?

751
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,808
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

752
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,883
- Come with me.
- Who, me?

753
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,446
- Yeah, I need you.
- I have a Halloween party tonight.

754
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,528
I mean, I would, but I can't miss it.

755
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,801
College parties start late.
I'll get you back in time.

756
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,081
I'm supposed to be Ashley Olsen, man.

757
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,246
Ashley Olsen?

758
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,250
Yeah. You know how long it takes
to straighten this hair?

759
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,203
Come on. You're my boy.

760
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,527
It's been a long day, man.
I need a good friend right now.

761
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,605
All right, I got your back.

762
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,328
Oh. Invitations, please.

763
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,763
- Invitations? I got one on my cellphone.
- No invite, no entry.

764
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,404
Can you guys push off, please?

765
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,250
- Just over there.
- My name's right there. |t's Jeff Bernstein.

766
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,203
- Check...I\/Ir Bernstein.
- You know what?

767
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,130
Thank you.

768
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,083
Hey, how are you doing?

769
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,971
There's got to be another way.

770
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,329
Let's go.

771
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,929
(Announcer) And now, the broken tango.

772
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,724
Take it away.

773
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,970
(Luke) Look, at this place, |\/loose. Come on.
(|\/loose) Where you going? Luke? Luke!

774
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,489
(J' Jazmine Sullivan:
Bust Your Windows)

775
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,003
- Luke.
- I got you.

776
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,843
Come with me.

777
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,211
(Phone rings)

778
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,526
(Chatter)

779
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,205
Hey, Camille, we're all ready for the party.
You coming?

780
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,403
I'm gonna meet you guys there.
lVloose'II be here like any minute.

781
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,489
Giddy up, girl! Yee-ha!

782
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,323
I got something for you.

783
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,851
I hope you like it.

784
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,484
Your film?

785
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,449
- You did it?
- Yeah.

786
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,561
Luke.

787
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,449
I'm so happy you finished it.

788
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,243
Let's get out of here.

789
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,250
- No one can see us. We're fine.
- No, I mean |et's leave.

790
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,049
We could go any\/\/here. California, even.

791
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,731
Come on, you can go to film school.
We can start fresh.

792
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,367
(He sighs)

793
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,927
Luke. I'm so glad you made it.

794
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,647
You know, I was a little concerned
that you wouldn't get the invitation in time.

795
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,570
- What are you doing here?
- Julien, you invited him?

796
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,127
What? Ijust wanted to invite him
to come celebrate the birthday

797
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,686
of my amazing and lovely sister.

798
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,327
He's... He's joking, right?

799
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,930
Wow.

800
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,927
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

801
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,122
- This was all a lie, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.

802
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,367
- Shut up, Julien.
- Why? It was.

803
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,521
Listen, at first it was,
and then I got to know you, OK?

804
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,210
And I...

805
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,730
I started to fall for you.

806
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,081
And that was real,
that's why I had to leave.

807
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,568
I'm... I'm so sorry.

808
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,763
- Please tell me you believe me.
- Don't touch me.

809
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,451
Luke, you...

810
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,922
- You don't need to deal with...
- Don't, Julien!

811
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,324
Natalie, are you really
getting mad about that?

812
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,523
Camille.

813
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,291
- Camille, I thought that you...
- I'm over it.

814
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,448
You clearly have better things to do.

815
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,529
- No, Camille, it's not like that.
- (Sighs)

816
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,245
- Come on, I got caught up.
- Great. Thanks.

817
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,886
I... I've been dancing.

818
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,091
Before school, during school and after.

819
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,851
So you've been lying to me
and ditching me for some secret life?

820
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,042
I mean, you could have at least told me.

821
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,202
But I guess |'m not important enough
in your new cool life to know.

822
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,851
I should have just told you. I know.

823
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,530
But I'm sorry, OK?

824
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,322
And it's all over now.

825
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,409
You're right. It's over now.

826
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,883
- Luke. Luke, Luke.
- What the hell?

827
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,446
- Hey, man, this is bullshit.
- (Jason) We tried to stop them,

828
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,209
but there was nothing we could do.

829
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,288
(Luke) We gotta get in there!
They can't do this to us!

830
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,368
Luke! Hey.

831
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,289
I grabbed as much as I could.

832
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,243
It's Julien.

833
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,489
- Julien's trying to buy the house.
- So what are we going to do now?

834
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,251
Can't you see? VVe're finished.

835
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,647
But the World Jam is just around the corner.

836
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,809
- But if vve have nowhere to rehearse...
- We have nowhere to sleep.

837
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,367
We're fooling ourselves,
thinking this place was going to last.

838
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,964
I'm out.

839
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,363
Anyone else?

840
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,405
Hey, it's not your fault.
Julien started this.

841
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,442
You guys deserve better than this.

842
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,290
There's nothing more I can do.
I screwed up.

843
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,607
The Pirates are done.

844
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,207
We tried.

845
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,890
(J` Jessie J Cornish: Who You Are)

846
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,610
Hi.

847
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,483
Hi.

848
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,123
So, on a scale of one to ten...

849
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,443
how much do you hate me?

850
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,403
I don't hate you, |\/loose.

851
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,881
I miss you.

852
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,010
And what's worse,
feeling like you don't miss me at all.

853
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,691
I don't even matter to you any more.

854
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,047
We spent all senior year
talking about NYU,

855
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,721
the real world, facing it together.

856
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,529
What changed?

857
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,683
You're my best friend
in the whole wide world, Camille.

858
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,486
And I never want to let that go.

859
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,169
My mom just sent this in the mail.

860
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,685
(Laughs)

861
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,205
Oh, wow.

862
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,810
That's priceless.

863
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,763
Cam...

864
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,643
I'm sorry.

865
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,521
I missed dancing,

866
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,608
but...

867
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,847
I'm going to have to say
I miss you more.

868
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,966
Really?

869
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,085
Really, really.

870
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,085
(Faint music)

871
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,327
- You hear that?
- What?

872
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,328
- Do you hear that right now?
- What?

873
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,727
- Come here.
- What?

874
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,921
What?

875
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,121
Are you serious? No, back of the line.

876
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,969
Just one second, little girl. One moment.

877
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,002
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, can you turn that song up a bit?

878
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,042
Do I look like a jukebox to you, pal?

879
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,565
Um...

880
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,601
How about five bucks?

881
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,723
- Give me that. I'll be right back.
- OK.

882
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,125
(Music gets louder)

883
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,446
(They laugh)

884
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,289
- Oh, my gosh.
- MSA freshmen year. We met...

885
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,560
(Both) To this song!

886
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,206
- This is ridiculous.
- (Moose) Remember the choreography?

887
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,447
- Step forward... Come on, let's try it.
- No, not a chance.

888
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,403
Dance with him! Please!

889
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,841
- Go.
- You heard the kid. Come on.

890
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,243
All right.

891
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,643
(J' I VVon't Dance)

892
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,921
|\/loose, stop! Oh, my gosh!

893
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,683
OK, not in public.

894
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,403
I'm sorry.

895
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,363
I'm not doing this.

896
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,801
VVhoa! (Laughs)

897
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,683
Moose!

898
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,489
Hey!

899
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,443
Give me my hat back!

900
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,641
VVhoo!

901
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,366
What are you doing? Get out of here!

902
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,051
Oh, man, you know what?
I'm gonna squirt you.

903
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,970
I'm gonna squirt you! Get out of here!

904
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,323
- Get outta here!
- Hey!

905
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,691
I'm sorry.

906
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,563
Come on! Come on! Get outta here.

907
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,047
- Come on, gimme your scooter, kid.
- Hey, that's my scooter!

908
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,281
You dented it, you freak!

909
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,280
(She laughs, he cheers)

910
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,882
Oh, my gosh,
you have leaves all over you.

911
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,325
Oh, wow.

912
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,204
(They sigh)

913
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:53,245
You can never give it up.
You were born to dance.

914
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,124
Give it up. You suck!

915
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,085
Really?

916
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,684
- Don't listen to them.
- (Laughs)

917
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,009
- I know, but you gave it up.
- Yeah, cos I'm not like you.

918
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,844
I'm a good dancer,
but, Nloose, you're a great dancer.

919
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:15,448
- My parents gave up everything...
- So you vvou|dn't have to. I know, I know.

920
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,005
We can figure this out.

921
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,963
Together.

922
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,841
OK.

923
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,523
(Makes explosive sound)

924
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,643
- OK.
- Come on. Like my new hat?

925
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,361
Hey, Vince,
I need a coffee on table eight.

926
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,521
Everything all right?

927
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,562
What do I have to do to get a menu here?

928
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,967
- What are you doing here?
-I have two things to say to you.

929
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,525
I'll have an egg salad sandwich,

930
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,881
and I still think we can win the World Jam
and get the house back.

931
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,888
I'm out of egg salad sandwiches
and you're out of your mind.

932
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,924
- I thought that's why you liked me.
- You're crazy. We have nobody left.

933
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,770
But I'm here. Means we got one back.

934
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,567
Luke, you're the only one that can get
everybody back together to save your house.

935
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,171
- The Pirates just need your leadership.
- They don't need me.

936
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,168
I took what my parents gave me
and threw it away.

937
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,611
You don't know what you've done.

938
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,247
Luke, you gave these people a place
where they can live out their dreams.

939
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,408
- Sit down, man.
- Dude, I got tables to work.

940
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,408
No, no, no, just take a seat.

941
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,081
- This better be quick.
- You never asked why I wanted to dance.

942
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,849
You want to know why?

943
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,406
I dance
because dance can change things.

944
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,851
One move can set
a whole generation free, like Elvis.

945
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,167
Uh-huh.

946
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,329
One move can make you believe there's
something more. Remember this one?

947
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,727
OW!

948
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,001
Nloose, sit down before
you make a fool out of both of us.

949
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,006
And some moves...

950
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,850
can give a skinny, curly-haired kid...

951
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,486
that just wants to dance...

952
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,682
somemsome hope.

953
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,683
Hope that he's actually special.

954
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,323
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello? Coffee?

955
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,522
Decaf, don't want it. Regular.

956
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,968
|'m sorry, I can't. I can't do regular.

957
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,082
I tried. It's just not me.

958
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:12,205
- |'ve been waiting here for 30 minutes.
- Hey, he can't do regular, the man said.

959
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,449
Great, Fred Astaire. I didn't pay
for a floorshovv. I paid for some coffee.

960
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,203
OK, that's cool, Nloose, but how are we
going to get everyone together?

961
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,129
I had to get everybody here somehow.

962
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,404
Man, did I miss you guys!

963
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,761
My mornings are way too quiet
without you guys yapping.

964
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,249
- You see? I told you he would miss us.
- Yeah, OK, OK, you're right.

965
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,807
Look, I know the odds are against us.
We have no house, no routine.

966
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,002
Hell, I don't even know
how we're going to do this.

967
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,247
But I believe in us, and I know you do too.

968
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,930
That's what I'm talking about.

969
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,443
VVe've come way too far to stop now.
I know we can win this.

970
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,165
(All sing) We be the Pirates!
We be the Pirates!

971
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,531
We be the Pirates!

972
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,688
We still don't have a place to rehearse.

973
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,610
Don't worry about it.
Moose said he found us a place.

974
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,725
Moose!

975
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:11,607
- Kido!
- Doggone! There you are!

976
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,363
(Both make explosive sound)

977
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,767
- VVhat's up?
- I miss you.

978
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,802
I miss you. Come here, give me a hug.

979
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:24,045
Guys, hey, this is Kido.
We used to dance together in high school.

980
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,210
Am I missing something? What do these
games have to do with the World Jam?

981
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:31,449
You said you needed space, right?
I got you, brother.

982
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,761
- Brother?
- Come on.

983
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,288
Nice to meet you.

984
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:44,731
Come on. This way, watch your step.
You're gonna like this place.

985
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,922
Just come.

986
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,041
Da-da!

987
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,003
See, I told you.

988
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,691
Whoo-hoo! OK, I like it, man.

989
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,041
(Tick 1) I used to love this game
when I was little.

990
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,082
Who do they belong to?

991
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,886
Oh, me. I watch them after school
because their parents work here.

992
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,207
(Tick 1) I don't know.
Do you think this is gonna work?

993
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,449
And there's so much junk. There's no room,
and we barely have any dancers.

994
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,687
Yeah, and the Samurai,
they outnumber us two to one.

995
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,291
- (Buzzer)
- He has a point.

996
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,402
(Buzzer continues)

997
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,169
Hold that thought.

998
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,203
Come on.

999
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,003
(J` J. Cole: Who Dat)

1000
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,290
Oh, my God! MSA Crew!
Long time, no see!

1001
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,130
Kido! You ruined our slow-motion thing!

1002
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,688
Guys, I thought you might need
some extra dancers.

1003
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,927
Pirates, meet the MSA Crew.

1004
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,928
Hey, let's show them what we got.

1005
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,768
(Moose) A highly good idea, Kido.

1006

I'm so sorry.

1075

Look, I know I lied to you.

1076

But everything we had was real.

1082

but come with me.

1083
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,888
What makes you think
I would trust you again?

1084

But is it enough
to upset the mighty Samurai?

Only time will tell.

01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,441
(Caz) There it is! There it is!

1177
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:12,280
The winners ofthe first annual World Jam

1178
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:16,006
is the House of Pirates!

1179
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,481
(Moose) You know,
some famous guy once said,

1180
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,171
”To travel is better than to arrive. ”

1181
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,923
And I was like, "What?"

1182
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:31,325
Because I used to think that there is only

1183
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,523
one path to take to where you want
to get to be in life.

1184
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,130
But if you choose that one path,

1185
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,561
that doesn’t mean you have to
abandon all the other ones.

1186
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:43,367
I realise that it’s actually what happens
along the way that counts.

1187
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,608
The stumbles

1188
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:50,291
and the falls

1189
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,766
and the friendships.

1190
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,282
It’s the journey, not the destination.

1191
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,042
You just gotta, I guess,

1192
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:03,607
trust that the future will work itself out
like it’s supposed to.

1193
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:08,320
I mean, I guess I'm asking the school
to kinda go freestyle with me here,

1194
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,725
but I'm ready to jump.

1195
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,922
What you're asking for here

1196
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:15,521
is a double major in engineering...

1197
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,204
and dance.

1198
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,810
Yeah.

1199
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,241
VVe||, it's certainly a first.

1200
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,927
So?

1201
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:40,330
Yeah, I mean, I...
I'm a double major, so...

1202
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:44,160
No way, |\/loose! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! I can't believe it.

1203
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:47,010
I can't believe it.
What do you mean, you can't believe it?

1204
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,849
Cam, thank you,
thank you for being there.

1205
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,680
You're welcome.

1206
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,768
(Man over PA)
May I have your attention, please?

1207
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,371
Westbound train 745 to Los Angeles,

1208
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,129
r7naI destination Los Angeles,

1209
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,970
will be departing in 15 minutes
from track eight.

1210
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:18,245
What happened? Did you forget something?

1211
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:21,045
- I think you forgot to say goodbye.
- Yeah.

1212
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,811
Don't leave me, don't leave me, please!

1213
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,367
Seiorita, please.
Come to Buenos Aires...

1214
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,722
- Don't listen to him.
- No, listen. I kissed your hand, remember?

1215
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,967
I'm going to miss you guys.

1216
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,843
Give me a hug, give me a hug.

1217
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,206
Come on, don't cry. Don't cry.

1218
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,603
VVhere's Luke?

1219
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,642

1221
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,724
He goin' hard!

1222
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,525
- (Laughs)
- All right, all right.

1223
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:44,370
Crazy. Don't listen to them, OK?

1224
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:49,642
(Pirates) Oh.

1225
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,687
VVhoa!

1226
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,563
Oh! What?

1227
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,691
Can I kiss somebody right now?

1228
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,491
Hang on a second, OK? I'll be right back.

1229
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,767
This is for you, man.

1230
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,802
I'll see you soon. Blow it up.

1231
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,170
(Makes explosive sound)

1232
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,567
You're B-FAB. Remember that.

1233
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,523
Take care of the house, guys.

1234
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,646
Open it.

1235
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,124
(Pirates) Ooh.

1236
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:37,643
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1237
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,964
