But no one's looking
for another brand of tequila.

10
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,936
They've got the three... What is it?

11
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,973
The Cuervo, the other one,
and the third one.

12
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,677
And they don't need more tequila.

13
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,675
- If I can't sell it, it's not gonna sell.
- People want the new-new.

What if I could sell this tequila
to a customer?

18
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,414
- Would I have your order then?
- (LAUGHS) Yeah, sure.

Excuse me, sir.

21

Do you enjoy the taste of tequila?

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,890
(IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT) Why, yes, I do.

23
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,264
But I only drink my particular brand,
and you will not convince me otherwise.

24
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,401
- It's a perfect candidate.
- Because it's your brother!

I know that's your brother.

26
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,234

Look, mate, I don't know your niece.

28
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,406
- Okay.
- But if I did...

29
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,376
I'd say she was a little clingy,
and she'd freak a lot of people out.

177
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:15,582
MIKE: Jeanie, we love you.

178
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,400
We want this to be
the best day of your life.

179
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,468
Yeah.

180
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:19,636
You, too, Eric.

181
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:20,922
- Oh.
- Oh. Thank you.

182
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,205
Mostly you, though, Jeanie.

183
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:23,273
(CHUCKLES)

184
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,308
If you want us to bring dates,
we're bringing dates.

185
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:26,458
All right, it's settled then.

186
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:29,301
Wedding dates!

187
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:32,196
Dave, buddy, let me talk to you
for a second, okay? Listen.

188
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:34,433
I'm sorry to lump you in with Mike...

189
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:36,270
but if I only told your older brother
to bring a date...

190
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,037
he'd get all weird about it.

191
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,339
I just feel like he's holding you back.

192
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,039
Dad, I don't mind
being lumped in with Mike.

193
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:43,615
Do you remember
the fifth grade bake sale...

194
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:44,808
when Mom made those cupcakes...

195
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:46,247
and I called them moist?

196
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,719
- Mm-hmm.
- Everyone called me Moist...

197
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,789
till Mike took a cupcake...

198
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:53,587
and shoved it in Tom Ginty's face.

199
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,062
He said, "Now you're moist, Moist."

200
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,294
That's the kind of guy Mike is.

201
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,094
So, think on that...

202
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,233
Dad.

203
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,635
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to end that
on such a weird note, Dad.

204
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,803
- I love you. And thanks.
- Good. I don't want you to be mad.

205
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:12,023
I'm not even mad. I'm not even upset.

206
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:13,138
We're gonna find some dates.

207
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,842
TATIANA: I gotta say, some nights,
I am not looking my best.

208
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:19,054
But tonight is not one of those nights!

209
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:20,164
(LAUGHS)

210
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:21,450
- Do you like my hair?
- Yeah, girl.

211
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,114
- You look good.
- No.

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,452
We're gonna make a lot of tips tonight.

213
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:26,626
Good. We need it. We don't have any money.

214
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,589
Uh, you got money for this ride, don't you?

215
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:30,408
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

216
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:31,475
(WHISPERING) 'Cause you have money?

217
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:32,576
I thought you had money.

218
00:08:32,656 --> 00:08:33,644
I don't have any money.

219
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:34,713
You know I don't have money.

220
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,330
Yeah, y'all are whispering like people
that don't got money.

221
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:38,941
Check it out. I'mma pay you right now.

222
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:40,752
Boop. I Apple Paid.

223
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:41,970
I don't even have Apple Pay.

224
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:44,008
Yo, Siri, pay this man.

225
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:45,290
He's already paid.

226
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,358
God damn it!

227
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,850
I'm not gonna take shit from you,
because this my cab.

228
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,429
You shouldn't take shit from us.

229
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,731
- You should kick us out!
- You should kick us out of this cab.

230
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,901
You know what? I'm gonna kick you
the fuck out of this cab.

231
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,203
Yeah, just go three more blocks up
on the right...

232
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,318
and then kick us out!

233
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:01,459
- (BRAKES SCREECHING)
- Here we are!

234
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,821
Get out of my cab.

235
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:04,296
Thank you. You're a really good person.

236
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:05,491
Okay, God bless you.

237
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:08,137
I'm just gonna start driving for Uber.
Fuck it.

238
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:09,594
Ooh. I got a good idea.

239
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,434
Let's pop off, get a couple of drinks
before work.

240
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:13,668
Just a few,
because I don't want to get hammered.

241
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,335
Yeah, of course not. Just a light buzz.

242

243
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:23,318
Hey, hey, hey!

244
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,012
Welcome to Sake Bombers...

245
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,385
where your first Sake Bomb is on us!

246
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:29,458
- Kaboom!
- You're drunk, Alice.

247
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,304
You're doing that thing
where you're whispering,

248
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,522
but you're really yelling.

249
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:33,993
Because I'm upset with you.

250
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:35,188
Oh, what the hell?

251
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:37,677
ALICE: I don't understand why you just
started yelling at me for no reason.

252
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,564
- What the hell is going on here?
- Your little buddy is shit-faced.

253
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:45,506
Straight up.
Her fiancé just left her at the altar.

254
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:46,786
She's been going through a hard time.

255
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:48,955
- Are you guys talking about me?
- No, baby girl.

256
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:50,514
You know how many times
I have come in here...

257
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,619
and she is drunk off her fucking ass,
dancing on the tables?

258
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,915
Only when Rihanna comes on,
because it's my jam.

259
00:09:58,078 --> 00:09:59,819
I am a strong independent woman.

260
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,653
And I will get on a table
and shake my shit to RiRi.

261
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,806
Because it's my right. America!

262
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:06,887
Feminism!

263
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:08,499
You just push your tits up
and say feminism?

264
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,032
Yeah. Read a Twitter.

Who put her jam on?

269
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:21,536
Queen RiRi, forever!

270
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:23,613
I'm really sorry that I got us fired.

271
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,077
I'm just sort of surprised
it didn't happen sooner...

272
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,685
- but I'm still really sorry.
- Hey!

273
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:31,088
Alice, you do not apologize
right now, okay?

274
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,283
You didn't do one thing wrong.

275
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:34,754
- Okay.
- People need to get in line with you.

276
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,953
Right. You're right.

277
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,859
Alice, why are you watching
your wedding video?

278
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,509
FATHER MIKE ON VIDEO:
And Alice... do you take Luke?

279
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:42,610
I do.

280
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,566
ALICE: Because it's therapeutic.
The more I watch it, the less I feel.

281
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:46,763
FATHER MIKE: And do you, Luke, take Alice?

282
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:47,962
I do...

283
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:49,397
not.

Oh, fuck that guy.

00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:56,443
Fuck him right in his dick.

No!

289
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:01,582
Because now I'm picturing his dick
getting fucked by another dick.

290
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,154
And it makes me want to protect it.

291
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,959
Oh, my God, girl! Damn!

292
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:08,788

vodka pot brownies with me...

295
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,632
for the junior high science fair?

296
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,929
Or gave us water balloon tits and we won
that wet T-shirt contest in Mexico?

297

Oh, yeah, they were so nice.

they get really good homes.

But it's not a vacation. It's a wedding.

Do you really think a wedding's
the best place for me?

00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,163
We got a pulse! Okay.

523
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:10,464
Don't let her die!

524
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:12,285
Don't you fucking let her die, Mike!

525
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,483
Just shut the fuck up, Dave!
You, too, shut up!

526
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:16,386
Both of you, shut up! Okay?

527
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:17,484
I'm gonna save her life!

528
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:19,293
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

529
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:21,588
Plug the nose.

(GASPS)

531
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:26,326
MIKE: Oh!

532
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:28,873
Are you okay?

533
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:30,736
(PANTING) I am now.

534
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,101
- I saved her life!
- ALICE: She's okay!

535
00:19:34,268 --> 00:19:35,747
- She's okay?
- I saved her life!

00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:36,890
(ALL CHEERING)

537
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,472
Thank you! Thank you!

538
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:40,984
- OFFICER: You're under arrest.
- MAN: She hit my car!

539
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:42,397
TATIANA:
No, you guys, I'm totally fine, really.

540
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:43,615
It happens all the time.

541
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:46,190
That was a vicious hit.
We should take you to the hospital.

542
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:48,190
It's crazy.
It's almost like I owe you my life.

543
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:50,926
- Almost.
- Yeah. Technically, yeah.

544
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:53,156
- Let me help you with that ice.
- I do.

545
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:54,375
Oh, no.

546
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:56,162
Seems like it's going pretty well
with your guy.

547
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:59,032
Dude, I'm fucking crushing it! So hard!

548
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,503
- (LAUGHS)
- Check this out.

549
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:03,605
The kids in my class
are gonna love this story.

550
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:05,369
I'm a school teacher.

551
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,612
You're a school teacher? (CHUCKLES) Wow.

552
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:12,513
Oop. I think they spelt "frittata"
wrong on the menu.

553
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:14,381
I always notice words and spelling...

554
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:16,215
because I'm a teacher...

555
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:18,218
and that's what I do.

556
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:19,855
(CHUCKLES) That's...

557
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:22,518
So, Alice, um, what do you do?

558
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:24,490
Manage a hedge fund.

559
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,958
You manage a hedge fund?

560
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:28,226
I don't even know what a hedge fund is.

561
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,893
Oh. So there's a regular fund,
and then there's a hedge fund.

562
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,131
And our fund...

563
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:35,033
Uh, we hedge it.

564
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:36,532
We hedge it hard.

565
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:37,700
Oh, wow.

566
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,004
I get in, in the morning, and I'm like...

567
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:42,979
"How's the hedging coming?
You been hedging? You hedged much?"

568
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,446
And it's like, too big to fail.

569
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,585
Corporate greed, bailouts.

570
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,848
In a New York minute,
everything can change.

571
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:53,024
On the floor of the NASDAQ and the U.N.

572
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:54,387
And then, Fannie Mae.

573
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,394
Bernie Mac and D.L. Hughley...

574
00:20:57,553 --> 00:20:58,726
- Alice, you want some water?
- Yeah.

575
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:00,797
- That's so smart.
- That is.

576
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,813
(IMITATES LIAM NEESON)
"But what I do have...

577
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:05,081
"is a particular set of skills.

578
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,732
"Skills I have acquired
over a very long career.

"Skills that make me a nightmare

580
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:13,739
Click. That's it.

581
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:15,091
That was amazing.

582
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:16,616
It was like Dave was not even here...

583
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:18,684
and I was just standing in a bar
with Liam Neeson.

584
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:20,287
Like, "Hello, Liam Neeson's over here."

585
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:22,955
You're a professional comedian
or something?

586
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:25,923
What? No. I sell liquor with my brother.

587
00:21:26,082 --> 00:21:27,083
- Oh.
- Yeah.

588
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,057
- I do like to draw.
- Oh, yeah?

589
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,698
Yeah, I have drawings here
I could show you.

590
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:32,625
Oh, shit, not that. Sorry.

591
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:34,928
Here. So, they're like The Avengers...

592
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:36,798
but they're different types of alcohol.

593
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:40,132
So, you have Tequila,
and then he's got his pet worm right there.

594
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:42,206
And his name is Lil' Mez.

595
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:43,978
Because he'll "Mez" you up.

596
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:45,823
The next one right there, that's Gin.

597
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:48,059
(IMITATES ALI G) When he flips his cap off,
dawg, he's just like...

"Yo, I'll pop you off. Guaranteed.
One knock." (GRUNTS)

599
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,445
Done.

600
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,055

(IN NORMAL ACCENT) Thanks.

605
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,594
What's the hardest thing
about being a teacher?

606
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:04,255
I don't know.

607
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:07,459
Oh, um...

608
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,514
The hardest thing about being a teacher...

609
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:11,698
is teaching cursive.

610
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,270
That's awesome.

611
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:15,172
- What about you?
- Yeah?

612
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,109
- Are you seeing anyone?
- No.

613
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,591
My ex is gone. Long gone.

614

What do you mean?

615
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,683
He died. Of cancer.

616

Oh, my God.

617
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,143
And AIDS.

He died twice?

00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,289
(EXHALES) And then he died
in a plane crash, so...

620

Whoo! That's a lot to take in.

621
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,863
I know!

We should take these girls
to the wedding. Right?

626
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,269
Mine's a sexy school teacher...

627
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,774
and yours... hedges funds.

628
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,310
- Just keep doing sexy eyes.
- Okay.

629
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,879
Keep doing sexy eyes.

630
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,944
I like Alice.

631
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,483

suddenly we're not losers.

in Hawaii...

if you guys wanted to come with.

- Um... (LAUGHS)
- Um...

639
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,732
Can you just give us a second to...

640
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,536
Of course.

641
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:21,645
Okay, so just whisper
like we're talking it over...

642
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:22,889
like we're not sure if we wanna go or not.

ALICE: Oh, like...

644
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,812
What the fuck are you doing?

645
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,498
ALICE:
I don't understand why we're arguing!

646
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,750
I thought we wanted to go.

647
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,135
All right, fuck it. Let's go to Hawaii!

648
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,250

Head west, red Lex

You make me feel so good

Aloha, and welcome.

- Hi.
- Aloha.

662
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,162
For real?

663
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,778
Let me get you gentlemen checked in, yeah?

664
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,956
Holy shit, this place is nice!

665
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,221
It's gonna be more nice.

666
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:13,626
Nice girls don't show off their ecstasy.

667
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,096
One of these is a multivitamin.

668
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,257
Is this shit free?

I can smoke weed out of this,
I can smoke weed out of this...

670
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:22,467
Look at that teacher,
grabbing her apple a day.

671
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:25,741
Look at that personality from behind.

672
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,846
It is, dare I say...

673
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,481
- well-rounded.
- Mmm-hmm.

674

TATIANA: Look at Mike.

675
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,911
He looks like a funhouse mirror version
of a better looking dude...

676
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:35,216
but he is just that dude.

677
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:38,448
Dave, it is so on this weekend.

678
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:40,991
(LAUGHS) I am not touching this guy
the whole weekend.

679
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:43,438
He thinks just because he brought me here
I'm gonna sleep with him?

680
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:44,519
Check it out.

681

- (LAUGHING)

683
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:50,258
I'd get close, but I'd never touch it.

684
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:53,268
They have such beautiful flowers here.

685
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:55,818
She's throwing out
serious vibes right now.

686
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:57,053
I'm like, I'm hungry.

687
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,339
I'm gonna butter them biscuits.

688
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,274

Every time he says something sweet...

693
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:10,214
I wanna get some rope and chain
in bulk from Home Depot...

694
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,290
and just see where it takes us, you know?

695
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,223
That is messed up.

696
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:16,626
Ladies, your wedding itineraries.

697
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:18,240
# DoingItForJeanie.

698
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,197
DAVE: Today, we have
the meet and greet by the pool.

699
00:25:20,322 --> 00:25:22,311
And then after that,
we have a dolphin excursion.

700
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:23,879
Friday is the rehearsal dinner.

701
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,047
Mmm-hmm.

702
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,249
That's where Dave and I are gonna be
doing our big speech.

703
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,366
(CLEARS THROAT)
Will there be any downtime?

704
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:31,205
ALICE: Yeah, 'cause I gotta
keep in touch with the office.

705
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:33,557
I gotta call my stocks
about the state of my bonds.

706
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:34,638
It happens a lot.

707
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:37,351
Mm-kay, I think we are right up here.

708
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:40,850
Great. So which one
is me and Alice's room?

709
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:43,467
Uh...

710
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:46,892
I don't know.
Are you and Alice gonna share a room?

711
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,339
Or I was thinking that maybe you and I...

712
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,160
would stay in the same room.

713
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:56,162
That sounds interesting...

714
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:58,328
but I don't think it would be a good idea.

715
00:25:59,663 --> 00:26:00,664
Why not?

716
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,736
(WHISPERING) Because I don't
trust myself around you.

717
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:07,677
You can trust me.

718
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:10,078
I do trust you.

719
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:12,183
Let's trust each other.

720
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:15,415
There's so much trust.

721
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:17,956
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

722
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:20,204
I respect you so much,
I can't wait to get you alone.

723
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:22,540
Yeah, we're gonna cover
all the room charges and stuff...

724
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,108
for up to $50 per day.

725
00:26:24,188 --> 00:26:25,292
Oh, my God. You don't have to do that.

726
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,561
I'm a very strict teacher.

727
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:31,535
You be Michelle Pfeiffer
from Dangerous Minds, and I'll be...

728
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:32,970
I'll be Coolio.

729
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,076
- Coolio's not in that movie.
- Oh.

730
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:39,277
He is in song and spirit.

731
00:26:39,503 --> 00:26:42,177
I'm gonna call
a parent-teacher conference...

732
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:45,049
and tell them what a bad boy you are.

733
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:46,483
Please don't tell my mommy.

734
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:48,065
Please don't tell my daddy.

735
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:50,134
I think Wi-Fi is included, too, so...

736
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:51,421
- That's always nice. Yeah.
- Yeah.

737
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:55,674
If I were to give you a grade,
I'd give you a D.

738
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:56,960
A big, hard D.

739
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:58,497
Why? I deserve an A.

740
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,092
- What are you talking about?
- Oh.

741
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:01,294
Nothing.

742
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,803
In conclusion...

743
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:05,339
I'm gonna stay in the room...

744
00:27:05,497 --> 00:27:06,567
with Alice.

745
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,668
That one, with Alice.

746
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:11,178
Cool, cool. No doubt.

747
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:16,744
Somebody overcooked the soft pretzel.

748
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:20,199
My dick is hard. That's what I'm saying.
Give me five minutes.

749
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,816
Oh, my God. Ew!

750
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:25,021
(SINGING) Lift it, drop it, shake it

751
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:27,757
It's going down for real

752
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,168
It's going down for real

753
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,106
Grandma, I'd like you to meet Alice.

754
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:39,953
She's super smart, great conversationalist,
and she works on Wall Street.

755
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,376
But I'm one of the good ones.

756
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,945
(LAUGHS) I think she is.

757
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:46,878
TATIANA: I am a teacher, yeah.

758
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:49,814
And you know what?
The key to teaching children is repetition.

759
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:51,887
You'd be surprised how stupid they are.

760
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:01,159
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

761
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,722
Jeanie!

00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:04,495
(GASPS)

763
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,066
- Hey, you!
- Hi! Hi!

764
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,064
I'm so proud
to introduce our wedding dates...

765
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,868
- Tatiana.
- And Alice.

766
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,406
Hi!

767
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,474
- Oh, the bride. The gorgeous bride.
- Ow! Hi.

768
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:21,346
This weekend is all about you
being happy and not shattered.

769
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:23,631
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.

770
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:25,884
Check out your arms.
You got some Michelle Obama arms.

771
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,569
How'd you get those guns
on the plane, girl?

772
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:29,670
(ALL LAUGHING)

773
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,138
Eric...

774
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:32,925
you are two points hotter
just being next to this woman.

775
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:34,642
TATIANA: Try 10 points hotter.

776
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:36,810
- Try a million.
- That's too many points.

777
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,013
- Wow, and Jeanie, nice snag.
- Thank you.

778
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,595
TATIANA:
You guys look great together, really.

779
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:44,151
I'm liking this. Huh? Maybe you two
will keep these two in check a little bit.

780
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:46,074
- (ALL LAUGHING)
- I think we can.

781
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,574
I'll just keep him on a leash.

782
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:49,491
- Maybe don't hurt him.
- (CHOKING)

783
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:51,050
I like these girls.

784
00:28:51,206 --> 00:28:52,276
They're so fun.

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,545
Unlike my maid of honor.

786
00:28:54,743 --> 00:28:55,813
She's having a time.

787
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,048
How is ol' Becky Grammerstein?

788
00:28:57,245 --> 00:28:58,246
(SHUSHING) She's coming.

789

- Jeanie.
- Hey.

790
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:01,225
I'm in crisis mode.

791
00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:03,021
I ordered Prosecco for the Mani-pedis...

792
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:04,288
and all they have is champagne!

793
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:05,453
Aren't they the same thing?

794
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:08,099
- No. No, they're not. No.
- No?

795
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:10,396
Hello, Michael.

796
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:11,559
Hi, Dave.

797
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:15,530
Look, I'm trying to make your dreams
come true, okay?

798
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,765
- Right.
- What?

799
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:18,720
If this is bad news,
I'm gonna eat your ass.

800

- Sorry.
- Okay.

Purple. It better be purple.

802
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,283
I should probably go see to that.

803
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,440
- You'll come?
- Yeah.

804
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:26,881

that you saved her life.

I most certainly did, Father.

You see how great it is
to have nice girls around?

827

- I mean, these are nice girls.
- Aw!

to finally make you all my ohana...

Kale maluna!

858
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,312
Which translates loosely
into "bottoms up." (LAUGHS)

859
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:08,184
But more closely translated,
it actually means...

860

"your butts to the sky"...

861
00:31:10,882 --> 00:31:12,486

from a john...

"I'm an undercover cop"...

and they, like, beg that you don't tell
their children and their wives...

and they piss themselves,
and you've got the whole thing on video.

and then there's the Auto-Tune remix.

1384
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:38,034
He's so clingy.

1385
00:53:38,196 --> 00:53:41,019
When we were kids,
if I fell asleep before Mike...

1386
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:43,170
he would always wake me up
so he wouldn't feel alone.

1387

- That's kinda sweet.
- Yeah.

I don't know. I just...

1389

Do you ever get that feeling...

1390
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,814
that you're not good enough
to get what you really want...

1391
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,789

- Like, all the time. It's terrifying.

- It is, it's terrifying.
- Yeah.

When you invite someone to a wedding...

1403
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:35,474
they obviously are supposed to
finger diddle your family members.

1404
00:54:35,554 --> 00:54:36,555
That's common courtesy!

1405

Okay, hold up. I am a grown-ass woman.

1406

1407

does not make it okay.

Yes, obviously.

You are so hot. And you smell good.

sex with you...

01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:26,794
Don't you judge me, David.

1901
01:14:26,874 --> 01:14:28,629
I don't think you're supposed to
go into the mystery bag...

1902
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:29,780
the night before the wedding.

1903
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:32,084
We brought you here
because we thought you were nice girls.

1904
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:34,090
But Mike was right about you two.

1905
01:14:34,249 --> 01:14:36,490
This whole wedding weekend
is just going to shit!

1906
01:14:36,652 --> 01:14:38,461
Dave, I'll be honest with you.

1907
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,758
I need some clothes.

1908
01:14:40,789 --> 01:14:42,268
I can't continue to wear this horse.

1909
01:14:42,424 --> 01:14:43,960
Oh, my God.

1910
01:14:44,493 --> 01:14:45,801
Oh, the wind feels so nice.

1911
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:47,235
Come on, come on, come on.

1912
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:50,886
(GASPS) We should go in the ocean.

1913
01:14:50,966 --> 01:14:53,088
I'm so thirsty! Dave,
we should get in the ocean.

1914
01:14:53,168 --> 01:14:56,325
(SHUSHING) Please, please, please,
just be quiet.

1915
01:14:56,405 --> 01:14:57,893
I love this song.

1916
01:14:57,973 --> 01:14:59,316
There's no music playing.

1917
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:01,443
JEANIE: Baby, wait.

1918
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,521
Don't worry. Only our butts touched.

1919
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,625
Stop it. Don't freak out anymore, Pumpkin!

1920
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:07,818
Don't freak out? Don't freak out?

1921
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:09,360
Tell me one thing.

1922
01:15:09,586 --> 01:15:10,792
Did you enjoy it?

1923
01:15:11,354 --> 01:15:12,958
No.

1924
01:15:13,923 --> 01:15:15,311
That is such a "yes" no.

1925
01:15:15,391 --> 01:15:16,446
No.

1926
01:15:16,526 --> 01:15:18,915
I'm gonna ask you again. Did you enjoy it?

1927
01:15:18,995 --> 01:15:19,983
Yes! Oh.

1928
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:21,098
Well...

1929
01:15:21,364 --> 01:15:22,934
Cat's out of the frigging bag, isn't it?

1930
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:25,010
JEANIE: I went for a normal massage...

1931
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:27,205
but Alice, she had asked
for a little special treat.

1932
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,281
And then it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming, and...

1933
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:31,544
Who are these fucking girls
your brothers brought to this wedding?

1934
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:34,512
You are clearly on drugs.

1935
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:36,156
And we're getting married tomorrow!

1936
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,823
I'm scared, Pumpkin.

1937
01:15:38,982 --> 01:15:40,222
Aren't you scared?

1938
01:15:40,383 --> 01:15:42,192
Well, yeah, now I am.

1939
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,027
JEANIE: It's just that...

1940
01:15:44,721 --> 01:15:49,171
I'm just a little worried that you are...

1941
01:15:50,694 --> 01:15:51,695
boring.

1942
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,573
What are you saying?

1943
01:15:54,732 --> 01:15:55,938
You don't want to marry me?

1944
01:15:57,368 --> 01:15:58,369
(CRYING)

1945
01:15:58,636 --> 01:15:59,876
(BOTH GASP)

1946
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:08,084
Well...

1947
01:16:08,245 --> 01:16:09,849
No, she doesn't mean that.
She's just confused...

1948
01:16:10,014 --> 01:16:11,254
because she's just rolling
super hard right now.

1949
01:16:11,415 --> 01:16:12,519
You rolled her!

1950
01:16:12,683 --> 01:16:14,754
- You're the roller!
- I'm so sorry.

1951
01:16:14,918 --> 01:16:17,330
I was gonna draw Rum for you.
But not anymore.

1952
01:16:17,488 --> 01:16:19,468
(IN JAMAICAN ACCENT)
Everything is not irie, man!

1953
01:16:21,892 --> 01:16:24,498
You've made me so, so sad.

1954
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:28,442
But a little bit mad.

1955
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,611
But mostly just sad.

1956
01:16:31,603 --> 01:16:32,604
Oh!

1957
01:16:34,572 --> 01:16:35,880
- Dad!
- Don't!

1958
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,452
Mike, for once in your life...

1959
01:16:37,609 --> 01:16:40,590
please don't say a fucking word.

1960
01:17:05,036 --> 01:17:06,812
I hate them sometimes.

1961
01:17:06,972 --> 01:17:08,227
Fucking love them and they're dicks.

1962
01:17:08,307 --> 01:17:10,048
Sometimes I love them,
sometimes I hate them.

1963
01:17:18,117 --> 01:17:19,118
Everything okay over there?

1964
01:17:19,285 --> 01:17:21,697
I can't find my other sock.
It's pissing me off.

1965
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,331
Did you take my sock, bro?

1966
01:17:26,492 --> 01:17:27,562
No.

1967
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,438
I think you took my fucking sock, bro.

1968
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,134
God damn it.

1969
01:17:33,265 --> 01:17:35,370
I can't believe Jeanie and Eric
aren't getting married...

1970
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:37,310
and it's all our fault.

1971
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:40,951
It's slightly our fault.

1972
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,853
It's totally our fault. Fuck.

1973
01:17:44,009 --> 01:17:46,354
We got selfish. We got distracted.

1974
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:50,758
I don't think we were
#DoingltForJeanie at all.

1975
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:52,794
We weren't #DoingltForJeanie.

1976
01:17:52,953 --> 01:17:55,797
Our fucking little sister.
Our little Jeanie Beanie Weanie.

1977
01:17:56,456 --> 01:17:58,333
She is Stanglita.

1978
01:17:58,492 --> 01:18:01,268
The one little girl
we used to let into our Stang Hangs.

1979
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:02,416
The Stangle Dangle.

1980
01:18:02,496 --> 01:18:04,032
The smallest plane in the Stangar.

1981
01:18:04,197 --> 01:18:05,335
Don't do it, dude.

1982
01:18:05,499 --> 01:18:06,807
We're supposed to be her protector.

1983
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:08,503
Don't you cry.

1984
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:09,669
We're supposed to look out for her.

1985
01:18:09,836 --> 01:18:11,008
Stop it.

1986
01:18:11,171 --> 01:18:14,118
We're supposed to be the two dudes
that have her back no matter what.

1987
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:15,719
If you start, I'm gonna start.

1988
01:18:15,876 --> 01:18:18,152
We broke up her marriage.

1989
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:23,860
Of course I'm fucking doing it, man.
We ruined Jeanie's wedding.

1990
01:18:24,017 --> 01:18:25,463
I'm doing it, too.

1991
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,397
- (BOTH CRYING)
- I hate it.

1992
01:18:27,955 --> 01:18:29,195
(BAWLING)

1993
01:18:40,067 --> 01:18:42,690
Oh, man, we fucked up this wedding.

1994
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:43,771
Yeah.

1995
01:18:43,938 --> 01:18:46,111
We fucked it in the dick.

1996
01:18:46,374 --> 01:18:47,362
(GROANS)

1997
01:18:47,442 --> 01:18:49,097
You know I don't like it when you say that.
That's just...

1998
01:18:49,177 --> 01:18:51,885
I know, but we fucked it so hard. Fuck.

1999
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:55,136
I think the reason we get ourselves
into so much shit is...

2000
01:18:55,216 --> 01:18:57,287
we're always telling each other
we're so awesome...

2001
01:18:57,552 --> 01:19:00,556
when we're definitely not being awesome.

2002
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:02,029
That's deep.

2003
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah, you know what? Um...

2004
01:19:05,594 --> 01:19:07,437
I wanted you to feel better...

2005
01:19:07,596 --> 01:19:09,769
and get your groove back...

2006
01:19:09,932 --> 01:19:13,072
but not all the way better to where...

2007
01:19:14,503 --> 01:19:16,505
you wouldn't need me anymore.

2008
01:19:16,672 --> 01:19:19,585
Because if you don't need me...

2009
01:19:21,076 --> 01:19:23,750
then nobody needs me, and, um...

2010
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:27,690
Anyway, that's what I was thinking
when I was knuckles deep into Cousin Terry.

2011
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:30,296
Dude, we're always gonna need each other.

2012
01:19:30,919 --> 01:19:31,920
Okay.

2013
01:19:32,187 --> 01:19:36,230
Okay, here's the thing.
I don't wanna stop being us.

2014
01:19:36,391 --> 01:19:38,462
But I think occasionally...

2015
01:19:38,627 --> 01:19:42,872
we should think about
how we make other people feel.

2016
01:19:45,168 --> 01:19:46,156
Like Jeanie?

2017
01:19:46,236 --> 01:19:47,442
Yeah, like Jeanie.

2018
01:19:47,904 --> 01:19:49,611
- Oof.
- Or like Eric.

2019
01:19:50,073 --> 01:19:51,108
Oh, fuck.

2020
01:19:51,274 --> 01:19:52,912
This feels fucking terrible.

2021
01:19:53,076 --> 01:19:55,283
This does not feel good.

2022
01:19:55,478 --> 01:19:58,220
Like, Dave's so special and...

2023
01:19:58,948 --> 01:20:01,326
He must be so mad at me.

2024
01:20:01,751 --> 01:20:02,821
Poor Mike.

2025
01:20:02,986 --> 01:20:06,331
He's less special,
but I played him so hard.

2026
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:07,934
They must be so mad at us!

2027
01:20:08,091 --> 01:20:10,298
They must hate us. Fuck! I would hate us.

2028
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,269
I would fucking hate us!

2029
01:20:12,428 --> 01:20:14,772
I hate us, man. I hate us!

2030
01:20:14,931 --> 01:20:16,069
I hate us, too!

2031
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:17,939
But you're the best, dude. I love you.

2032
01:20:18,101 --> 01:20:20,445
Don't lump yourself in with me.

2033
01:20:20,603 --> 01:20:22,083
I'm like a little troll...

2034
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,015
who lives on nothing but
river water and squirrel meats.

2035
01:20:25,175 --> 01:20:27,587
Your drawing?
I could never do anything like that.

2036
01:20:27,745 --> 01:20:29,934
- So go. You go right now.
- What?

2037
01:20:30,014 --> 01:20:31,068
Go!

2038
01:20:31,148 --> 01:20:34,527
Don't let your loser older brother
hold you back.

2039
01:20:37,988 --> 01:20:39,331
You are not a loser.

2040
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:41,659
Thanks, Dave.

2041
01:20:41,825 --> 01:20:43,327
Dude, you introduced me
to the Ninja Turtles.

2042
01:20:43,494 --> 01:20:45,337
Taught me Donatello was a pussy.

2043
01:20:45,496 --> 01:20:47,373
That Raphael was actually dope...

2044
01:20:47,531 --> 01:20:49,511
because he didn't give a fuck
what people thought.

2045
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:50,941
He's cool, but rude.

2046
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:52,341
Exactly.

2047
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:54,541
When all those kids kicked at me
and they called me "Moist"...

2048
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:57,517
you stopped eating muffins
at the school lunch for a year.

2049
01:20:57,675 --> 01:20:59,348
They were too moist.

2050
01:21:00,477 --> 01:21:02,389
Made you an easy target.

2051
01:21:02,547 --> 01:21:06,051
You're my brother. And I love you.

2052
01:21:06,217 --> 01:21:07,787
Heroes in a half shell.

2053
01:21:07,953 --> 01:21:09,057
Turtle power.

(YELLS)

2055
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,332
We're not going anywhere...

2056
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:20,169
until our little sister,
Jeanie Beanie Weanie...

2057
01:21:20,332 --> 01:21:22,039
is getting married.

2058
01:21:22,968 --> 01:21:23,969

2059

(GASPS)

2060
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:28,979
You just killed the TV.

2061
01:21:29,507 --> 01:21:31,248
I was aiming for it.

2062
01:21:33,712 --> 01:21:36,522
MIKE: We are such idiots. We are so stupid.

2063
01:21:36,681 --> 01:21:38,183
We ruined your whole wedding...

2064
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:40,058
and we finally just realized that.

2065
01:21:40,219 --> 01:21:42,199
All right. Please just stop talking, okay?

2066
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:45,529
Not another word. My head hurts so bad.

2067
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:46,897
Jeanie, Eric.

2068
01:21:47,059 --> 01:21:49,767
We can't let you not get married
just because we fucked everything up.

2069
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:51,067
DAVE: We love you so much, Jeanie.

2070
01:21:51,163 --> 01:21:53,234
We love you, Eric.
We just want you guys to love each other.

2071
01:21:53,332 --> 01:21:54,320
- Just love each other.
- That's it.

Jeanie, Eric.

2074

We can't let you not get married.

2075

we fucked everything up?

2076

I mean, we want you guys
to love each other.

2077

The point is, this shit is all our fault.

2083

No, it's our fault.

2084
01:22:16,756 --> 01:22:18,429
No, it's definitely our fault.

2085

It is our fault for sure.

2086

No, no, no. For real.

2087

keep on fucking with my shit.

- that's kind of on you...
- Mike!

2099
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,012
I'm using hyperbole.

2100

I don't know what that means,
and I think you know that I don't.

- Yeah.
- I know.

- MIKE: That's pretty spot-on.
- ALICE: We just figured that out.

- Those are not good qualities.
- We're gonna work on it.

2110

- It's been a long time.
- It's been so many years.

for anything she said last night.

I've done so much stupid shit on E.

2117
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,534
I got so dehydrated that
I was drinking puddle water...

2118
01:23:31,699 --> 01:23:32,871

2121
01:23:37,371 --> 01:23:39,628

TATIANA: One time I got high.

2123
01:23:41,543 --> 01:23:44,046
I read the back of a shampoo bottle
for 13 hours.

2124

Because it said "repeat."

2125
01:23:46,315 --> 01:23:47,851
- Rinse and repeat.
- I get it.

2126

Jeanie, I know you think
that Eric can be boring...

walked across the hallway,
saw a second movie.

- What'd you say?
- Yeah.

2139
01:24:18,148 --> 01:24:19,684
- You're right. We were wrong.
- That was pretty boring.

2140

But my biggest fear...

2151
