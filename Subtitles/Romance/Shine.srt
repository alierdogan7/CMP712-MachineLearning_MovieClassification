between winning or losing.

164

From the record.

Ah, yeah. It's...
It's very difficult.

Won't you, David?

what are we going to do?

- Yes?
- Mr Rosen, I have decided.

193
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,909
I would like you
teach David.

194
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,712
This.

195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,230
Rachmaninoff?
Don't be ridiculous.

196
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,476
But he can
play it already.

197

He's just a boy. How can he express
that sort of passion?

You are a passionate man,
Mr Rosen.

199
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,393
You will teach him, no?

200
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,751
No. I will teach him
what I think is best.

201
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,348
Rachmaninoff is best.

202
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,752
But... you're his teacher.
I'll let you decide.

203
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,314

Nothing wrong with Schubert.

Except syphilis.
Was it syphilis? I think it was.

221
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,589
Then he got typhoid on top of that,
so that was the end of him. We lost him.

222
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,154
That was a bit careless of us.
Ha! We lost him.

and seemed a bit lost, so...

to a special school in the States...

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,276
Oh.

504
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,676
He was forever busy
in his study.

505
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,758
"Go away, Kattie, I'm writing,"
he'd always say.

506
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,480
One day,
oh, I was very young,

507
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,909
I got so annoyed...

508
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,191
that I upset the ink pots
all over his desk...

509
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,279
and scrawled on his work,
pages of it.

510
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,109
When he saw it, he just stood there
seething with anger.

511
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,196
I could feel it.

512
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,596
"What are you doing?"
He shouted.

513
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,553
Well, there was this
terrible silence.

514
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,075
And I just stared at him and said,
"Go away, Daddy, I'm writing."

515
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,395
[Laughing] Well, he ran at me
and he picked me up...

516
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,159
and he cuddled me breathless!

517
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,389
My first literary effort,
he always called it.

518
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,072
David, what is it?

519
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,989
Royal College of Music.

520
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,917
A scholarship.

521
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,674
Oh, David,
that's marvellous.

522
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,996
Daddy won't cuddle me,
Katherine. Oh, no.

523
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,509
He can't stop you, David.

524
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,835
He's such an angry lion, Katherine.

525
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,316
Oh, nonsense. He's a pussycat.
[Chuckling]

526
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,956
I'll miss you.

527
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,949
These were for my son,
but you'd better have them.

528
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,231
It gets very, very cold
in London.

529
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,756
David?

530
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,677
Where have you been?

531
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,597
Uh, I missed the train.

532
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,110
That Prichard woman.

533
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,232
- What is this? The gloves.
- [Cat Meows]

534
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,635
Look at me.

535
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,557
Look at me!

536
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,912
[Laughing]

537
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,749
And you think you can
just do as you please?

538
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,669
- Uh, I wa... I wanna go,
and y-you can't stop me.
- What?

539
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,189
- I'm your father...
- [Grunts]

540
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,233
Who has done everything
for you... everything!

541
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,157
You cruel,
callous boy!

542
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,635
- Mom! Margaret! Mom!
- Stupid! Stupid boy!

543
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,593
- Leave him! Leave him!
- Leave me alone.

544
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,759
[Rachel Yelling,
Peter Grunting]

545
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,270
Go, go, go, go. Let him go!
If you want to go, go!

546
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,834
- I'll call the police!
- [Grunting]

547
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,235
[Suzie]
Stop it!

548
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,912
[Panting]
He's all right.

549
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,873
Are you all right, David?

550
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,798
Are you all right?
Yeah? Come on, David.

551
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,876
It's all right.

552
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,436
I'm old enough
to make up my own mind.

553
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,994
He thinks he's going
to London.

554
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,271
I've been accepted into
the Royal College of Music.

555
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,755
What do you think is going to happen
to you in London?

556
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,075
[Sighs]

557
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,031
David.

558
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,957
If you go,

559
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,799
- you will never come back
into this house again.
- [Crying]

560
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,037
You will never be
anybody's son.

561
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,754
The girls will lose
a brother.

562
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,871
Is that what you want?

563
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,195
You want...

564
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,959
You want to destroy
the family?

565
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,390
I'm so... I'm sorry.

566
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,877
David. David, if you love me,
you will stop this nonsense.

567
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,356
You will not step out
that... that door.

568
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,789
David.

569
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,276
If you go,
you will be punished...

570
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,429
for the rest of
your life, my David.

571
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,357
Don't go.

572
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,871
[Sniffles]

573
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,118
[Whispering]
Sorry. I'm sorry.

574
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,399
David! Don't make me do it!

575
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,149
He has the most fantastic hands.

576
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,033
Not connected to anything
above his shoulders.

577
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,153
- Oh, he's a bit fragile, certainly.
- "Chopinzee."

578
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,875
I've seen enough to suggest that he can
make the finals in the concerto trials.

579
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,116
What have you seen, Cecil?

580
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,517
- Moments of genius.
- Genius?

581
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,437
Really.

582
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,311
[Laughing]

583
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,477
Come on, David.
Boldness of attack.

584
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,875
- [Slams Hand On Keyboard]
- Ohh!

585
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,797
- Diablerie!
- Whoa.

586
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,195
- The devil, David.
- Mustn't break the piano, eh?

587
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,153
- Liszt broke plenty of strings.
- Right, right, right.

588
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,478
- [Piano]
- Come on. Fill in for this
useless arm of mine.

589
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,751
The notes first.
The interpretation comes on top of them.

590
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,677
On top. Yes, yes, yes.

591
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,597
You agree, do you?

592
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,517
Oh, yes. I always
agree, Professor.

593
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,269
- Is that wise?
- I-I don't know. Is it?

594
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,278
Don't forget...
it's on the page!

595
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,518
Yes. Well, the notes are on the page,
but, uh, not the feeling.

596
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,790
The emotion.
That's what I feel.

597
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,718
You mustn't sacrifice everything to
emotion. It's all a question of balance.

598
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,355
Ah, yes. Is that
the question, Professor?

599
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,516
Precisely.

600
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,519
I thought so.
That's what I thought.

601
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,195
- Mr Helfgott? Your allowance cheque.
- Thank you, Mr Wright.

602
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,676
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'll just stand still if you like.

603
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,917
- Be careful, David.
- Ohh. By all means, Sarah.

604
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,190
- You look lovely today, Sarah.
- Thank you, David.

605
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,108
- You too, Muriel.
- Ease up, Helfgott, hmm? Sarah!

606
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,993
David, you missed
the bank. Pity.

607
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,917
You'll have to wait
until tomorrow.

608
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,190
- Can't bank on the bank.
- We know someone who can cash it.

609
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,117
- Do we, Robert?
- What are friends for?

610
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,913
Before this dance

611
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,917

00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,078

614
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,111
My love I'll send

615
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,869
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bah
Ba-ba-ba-bah

616
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,956
I just hope and pray

617
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,193
That I'll find
the way to say

618
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,276
Can I dance with you

619
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,392
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bah
Ba-ba-ba-bah

620

[Cooing]

621
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,151
[David] Gotta concentrate, Kath...
Gotta concentrate, Katherine.

622
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,475
Gotta practise, practise,
practise.

623
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,388
Because there's three important
things Professor Parkes says,
and that's work, work, work.

624
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,795
[On Tape] A-A-And, uh,
so that's what I have to do...

625
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,673
if I'm gonna, uh, m-make the finals
to the Concerto Medal...

626
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,268
because the winner of which gets
to play at the Royal Albert Hall,

627
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,197
which is
right outside the window.

628
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,880
[David]
So I bought a piano, Katherine.

629
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,310
A-A beautiful piano. It's,
it's a suffering piano, like yours.

630
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,677
[Clears Throat]
I-I wrote to Daddy,

631
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,597
so, uh, that's, uh,
a positive.

632
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,995
It's, uh, a positive,
isn't it, because, well...

633
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,829
It seems to be because, uh, he didn't
write back, but... [Giggles]

00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,433
Now, how on earth did we manage
to get in the finals, dear David?

637
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,357
- You're a conductor's nightmare.
- It's true, it's true.

638
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,277
And what are we gonna do?

639
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,834
We're gonna win, actually, Robert.
We're gonna win.

640
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,436
[Parkes]
Rachmaninoff? Are you sure?

641
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,916
Uh, kind of. I'm-I'm never really sure
about anything, Mr Parkes.

642
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,429
The Rach 3.

643
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,551
It's monumental.

644
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,036
It's, uh, it's a mountain. It's the, uh,
hardest piece you could "Everest" play.

645
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,436
Well, no one's ever been
mad enough to attempt the Rach 3.

646
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,638
Um, am I mad enough,
Professor?

647
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,557
Am I?

648
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,513
[Piano]

649
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,478
Think of it as two separate melodies
jousting for supremacy.

650
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,510
The hands... giants.
Ten fingers each.

651

[Continues]

652
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,155
Performing's a risk, you know.
No safety net.

653
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,316
Make no mistake, David.

654
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,193
It's dangerous.
People get hurt.

655
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,949
- [Continues]
- You have to learn to be able
to play it blindfolded.

656
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,509
The page, for God's sake!
The notes!

657
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,915
Sorry, I was, uh,
forgetting them, Professor.

658
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,271
Would it be asking too much
to learn them first?

659
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,356
- And then forget them.
- Precisely.

660
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,596
[Parkes]
Just give me the fingering.
