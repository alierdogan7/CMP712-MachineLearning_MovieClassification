And now I'm delighted to have
as my guest in the studio

128
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,423
a very brave young
lady indeed, Tessa Scott.

129
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,524
Tessa's been living with leukemia
for the past four years,

130
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,928
and she's here with
her dad to talk about it.

131
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,996
Tell us, when did you realize
that Tessa was first ill?

132
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,626
Four years ago.

133
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,705
She had, well,
we thought it was the flu,

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,068
Tessa's mum and I.

135
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,734
But the flu just
wouldn't clear up.

136
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,433
The blood test
confirmed our worst fears.

137
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,104
The doctors told
us they couldn't

138
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,805
hold out any hope
for her survival,

139
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,349
which brought us
to the point where

140
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,951
Tessa felt like
she had no choice

141
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,247
but to end her
chemotherapy entirely.

142
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,721
Tessa, you chose to
give up the treatment.

143
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,587
That's a big
decision for a 17-year-old.

144
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,722
If I may...

145
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:10,885
The more aggressive treatments,

146
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,951
they would have only slightly

147
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,691
prolonged Tessa's life.

148
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,957
There are other ways
to maintain her health.

149
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,728
Dad... For example,
studies have shown

150
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,600
that good nutrition can
rebalance a system entirely.

151
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,072
That's why we're here really,
to raise awareness, and...

152
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,164
Dad...
What?

153
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,011
He's gonna have
to stop sometime.

154
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,809
Stop what, Tessa?

155
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,705
He knows it's gonna happen.

156
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,615
But he can't stop
hoping that it won't.

157
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,781
It's true that if
I kept going with the chemo,

158
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,189
I'd probably live a bit longer.

159
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,523
But it made me feel so bad.

160
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,662
And there are things
I want to do before I die.

161
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:49,960
Things?

162
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,663
Yeah. I've got a list.

163
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,362
Oh. Your dad
didn't mention that.

164
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,203
That's 'cause
he doesn't know about it.

165
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,670
Most of what's
on it is illegal.

166
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,643
I'm almost scared to ask.
(CHUCKLES)

167
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,211
Well, I nearly
had sex last night,

168
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,579
which isn't actually technically
against the law of course,

169
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,742
but it was so crap the guy
should be arrested anyway.

170
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,979
Okay, I think that's
all we've got time for.

171
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,280
Next I'm planning
to take drugs.

172
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,550
Do you have
any advice which ones?

173
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,647
That's enough, Tessa.

174
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,124

there is a young lady
taking life by the horns.

178
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,031
Thank you very much,
Tessa and her dad.

179
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,927
Thank you.

180
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,999
And now the weather.
Squally this morning,

181
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,938
rounding up this afternoon
and clearing

182
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,567
for the rest of the week.

183
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,449
She's out.
No.

184
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,712
Dad...

185
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,146
Wait.

186
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,752
Bad night?

187
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,121
There's no such thing.

188
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,726
Hello, darlings. Come on in.

189
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,194
Hi, Mum.

190
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,157
You look stressed.

191
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,894
Blame her. Back at 4:00.

192
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,539
It's a new trick, Mum.
I can make a coin disappear.

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,904
Do you want to see it?

194
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,276
No, darling.
Not before coffee.

195
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,309
Nothing before the coffee.
Show your sister.

196
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,944
She's never interested.
She doesn't care.

197
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,755
I'm sure she does.

198
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,586
I really don't.

199
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,760
Why don't you go and watch
CBeebies or something?

200
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,952
Because I'm nine.

201
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,823
(SIGHS)

202
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,894
I heard you on the radio.

203
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,662
You met a boy.

204
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,662
Tessa, promise me
you'll always use a condom.

205
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,499
I know the smell of
rubber can be off-putting,

206
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,600
but, then, so is gonorrhea.

207
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,341
Please stop. My panic attack
is having a panic attack.

208
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,609
And don't have casual sex.

209
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,309
Really?

210
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,544
No, darling.

211
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,283
You must always, always
try as hard as you can.

212
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,421
(BOTH LAUGHING)

213
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,427
I've got to get a tattoo.

214
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,862
And I want one and all.

215
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,764
Over my whole body, of myself.

216
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,361
And taller, with bigger tits.

217
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,367
What's up?

218
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,668
He's such a bloody liar.

219
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,266
Who?
Scott.

220
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,368
Said he had a stall here.

221
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,037
Is that why we came?

222
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,444
I can't believe
he'd blow me off.

223
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,879
I gave him
the ride of his life.

224
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,144
Zo...
Wanker.

225
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,277
Zo...
What?

226
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,116
He's right there.

227
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,491
Hey, handsome.

228
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,548
What's up?

229
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,658
I don't know. You tell me.

230
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,992
Or better yet, show me.

231
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,297
(ZOEY GIGGLING) Hey.

232
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,896
Hey.

233
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,133
How are you?

234
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,102
I'm fine.

235
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,474
I know I left you hanging the
other night and I just wanted...

236
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,636
No, it was my fault.

237
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,244
What?

238
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,873
I just...
I could've been a bit more...

239
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,144
She told you.

240
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,678
What?

241
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,823
You did, didn't you?
You told him about me.

242
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,220
Shouldn't have done that.

243
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,150
Tessa, wait!

244
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,429
Tessa!

245
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,145
Hey. You missed lunch.

246
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,718
You eat it.

247
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,364
What are you
doing with all this?

248
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,367
There's a bonfire in
the garden next door.

249
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,639
Don't do that.
Please don't do that.

250
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,470
If you don't want
these things, I do.

251
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,802
That's Spain.
You were in remission.

252
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,045
A boy whistled at me,
and you took that.

253
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,115
Said I'd never want to
forget my first whistle.

254
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,583
Yeah.

255
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,883
But I do.

256
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,665
ADAM: What are you doing?

257
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,975
Do you mind?

258
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,970
Feel very free.

259
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,538
I'm Adam.

260
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,180
And you're Tessa.

261
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,118
I've seen you around,
since we moved here.

262
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,952
I meant to
introduce myself, but...

263
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,284
They're not love letters.

264
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,790
It's none of my business.

265
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,790
I'm just saying. I didn't
get dumped or anything.

266
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,522
I wouldn't have thought so.

267
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,398
Anyway,
I've got more stuff to burn.

268
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,871
Cool, whack it on.

269
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,035
This is going.

270
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,906
Probably best.
That's a dangerous dress.

271
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,556
Are you okay?

272
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,001
Tessa?

273
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,708
All right, don't move. Don't
move. I think you fainted.

274
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,510
Are you diabetic?

275
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,675
Do you need sugar?

276
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,111
Have some of this.

277
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,081
It's flat.

278
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,449
You're tough to please.

279
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,115
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

280
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,258
Okay, excellent. Not embarrassed,
not embarrassed at all.

281
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,228
No, it's cool, all right?

282
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,724
I mean, I've never had that
effect on someone before.

283
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,563
I kind of like it.

284
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,061
(EXHALES)
This is a nice garden.

285
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,534
Thanks. It's kind of my thing.
It keeps my mum happy.

286
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,804
How about your dad?

287
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,368
It's just the two of us.

288
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,780
I should get home.
All right. You need help?

289
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,450
It's not exactly far.

290
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,256
So, anytime you've got
something to burn...

291
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,991
Or I just want to pass out
in front of someone...

292
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,561
You know where to come.

293
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,625
Yes, I do.

294
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,042
When Tessa dies,
can we go on holiday?

295
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,570
Cal, that's an awful
thing to say.

296
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,308
I don't even
remember going to Spain.

297
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,844
It was so long ago,
it might not even be true.

298
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,475
Cal, that's enough.
Go to your room.

299
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,946
Dad...
What's wrong?

300
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,283
Get out!

301
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,755
What did I say that was wrong?

302
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,089
It's all very confusing.

303
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,991
No, it's not.

304
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,496
This is your day.

305
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,298
And what does that mean?

306
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,698
That I'll do whatever you want.

307
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,365
Buy more things?

308
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,699
Sure.

309
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,331
Where does the money come from?

310
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,035
A credit card.

311
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,873
Buy now, pay later.

312
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,707
Or you know, not.

313
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,372
Watch where you're flying. You
almost poked the guy's eye out.

314
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,712
I wish I could fly for real.

315
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,444
Yeah?

316
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,046
(WIND WHOOSHING)

317
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,818
(CHUCKLING)

318
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,065
CAL: Amazing!

319
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,402
That was better than
the best thing ever!

320
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,872
Can I go again?

321
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,373
I think it's your sister's go.

322
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,172
I'm good, I'm just watching.

323
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,644
Are you sure?
Yeah.

324
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,306
She's sick. She can't
do this kind of thing.

325
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,911
All right, mate, well, let's
get you hooked up again.

326
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,078
Actually, you know what?

327
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,754
I will have a crack.

328
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,589
Ready?
Ready.

329
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,323
Tessa, I don't know
if this is a good idea.

330
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,748
Is she okay?

331
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,884
She's fine.

332
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,189
She just doesn't
want it to end.

333
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,837
It wasn't your money.

334
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,567
She's late.

335
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,440
Do you hear what I'm saying?

336
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,705
She promised she'd come.

337
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,307
Tessa...

338
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,746
Do you want Cal to
return everything?

339
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,943
Why should he be punished?

340
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,915
What are you doing?

341
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,079
Is this to do with your list?

342
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,178
I don't have a list.

343
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,985
You told that
radio guy you had a list.

344
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,387
He was a knob.

345
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,857
Yeah, he was a knob.

346
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,192
You were still more honest
with him than you are with me.

347
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,594
How do you think
that makes me feel?

348
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,028
I don't give
a crap how you feel.

349
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,534
She's not coming.
Let's do this.

350
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,668
Tessa, there'll be
a slight pinch and burn,

351
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,106
then the anesthetic
will kick in. All right?

352
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,377
Good.

353
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,782
Now, I wiggle up and down

354
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,845
to break the tissue
around the insertion point.

355
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,050
She may feel a slight tugging
across the chest,

356
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,120
but once the line
detaches from the cuff,

357
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,718
it will simply slide away.

358
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,555
Now, of course I can
reinsert the catheter

359
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,656
should you wish to
recommence your treatment.

360
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,799
I'm saying you can
change your mind.

361
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,667
I won't change my mind.

362
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,800
(SIGHS) Dad?

363
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,033
She won't change her mind.

364
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,401
All right then.

367
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,381
Good girl.

368
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,856
Do you want to slap my rump?

369
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,556
What? No.

370
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,090
Then don't talk to me
like I'm a horse.

371
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,897
Yes.

372
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,998
Sorry.

373
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,006
Hey, it's done now. It's done.

374
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,540
NURSE: You know
what to look out for?

375
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,347
DAD: Yeah. Chill, fever,
stiff neck or headache.

376
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,120
Drainage, bleeding,
loss of strength.

377
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,918
You're good. (CHUCKLES)

378
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,751
Thanks for all your help.

379
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:26,958
She likes you.

380
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,393
I doubt that.

381
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,558
I mean it.
You're bang in there.

382
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,068
You should definitely
ask her out or something.

383
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,073
Tessa! Tessa, wait, I'm here.
I'm coming. Stay there.

384
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,075
Oh, God, did I miss it?
I left on time.

385
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,448
But there was
this insane traffic.

386
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,917
I definitely left on time.
I just...

387
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,647
Sure, whatever.

388
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,916
Tessa...

389
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,252
I don't care.

390
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,759
Oh, don't be like that.

391
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,091
How do you expect her to be?

392
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,994
I'm sorry, this has
what to do with you?

393
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,759
Is that a serious question?
Yes, it's a serious...

394
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,323
Enough.

395
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,968
You both suck.

396
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,005
One of you is this
cancer obsessive,

397
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,301
and the other
can't even face showing up

398
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,568
at the hospital, which is fine,

399
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,837
I get it.

400
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,879
But neither of you
are what I need.

401
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,039
You're just wasting my time.

402
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,756
All I'm saying... This is
not gonna be all you say.

403
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,255
All I'm saying is...
There'll be another thing.

404
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,258
All I'm saying is, you don't
have to stay in on my account.

405
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,195
You could go out and see
your friends more often.

406
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,699
And that's all I'm saying.
Okay. Okay.

407
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,874
I've just taken drugs.

408
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,201
Excellent.
Have you met my mum?

409
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,406
Hi.

410
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,506
Hi.

411
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,012
Mushrooms is all I did,
which are natural.

412
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,947
If not strictly legal.

413
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,619
My friend did
buy some ketamine,

414
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,091
but she thought
the dealer was a bit skanky,

415
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,527
so we've gone with
the shrooms instead.

416
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,860
See you inside.

417
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,630
That went well.

418
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,697
I thought so.

419
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,571
How much did you take?

420
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,906
Not much.

421
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,076
I don't know, I'm not really
that clued up on the stuff.

422
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,241
Yeah, me neither.

423
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,651
Look, I'll drive you somewhere.
Keep you out of trouble.

424
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,610
I'm not sure how long
it takes to kick in.

425
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,629
About that long.

Take nothing personally. She was
rude to last week's nurse, too.

00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,032
Sian, I think she was called.

Don't pretend you've forgotten
her name, Dad.

00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:55,230
You asked her to stay
for supper. She said no.

518
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,188
So why not talk
to her about all this?

519
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,594
Because she died.

look at me like that.

with another question?

this at the minute.

And now you can't
put it back together.

533

What do you mean?
I can, no trouble.

534
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,915

00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:02,115
Was this on the list?
Shoplifting?

716
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,787
What are you doing, Tessa?

717
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,016
What are you doing?

718
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,425
As much as I can.
As fast as I can.

719
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,853
I wish you'd stop.

720
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,665
You'd prefer I spend
the rest of my life

721
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,132
huddled in
a blanket on the sofa,

722
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,691
with my head on your shoulder.

723
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,563
Yeah, I would.
Can you blame me?

724
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:25,698
(ENGINE STARTS)

725
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,399
Yes, I would.

726
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:36,480
My point is... Well, my point
is, I like a strong woman.

727
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,881
You've always wanted
to be carried to bed.

728
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,988
I have always wanted
to be carried to bed.

729
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,250
What I don't do,
is bring to a mate's party

730
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,316
an, admittedly perfectly
formed, young pixie warlock.

731
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,822
Yeah, she's isn't a warlock.

732
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,123
I mean you can't just go around

733
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,687
starting fights every which way

734
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,061
and shaking
things up like that.

735
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,936
Apparently you can.

736
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,851
What are you doing here?

737
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,315
I've been stalking you all day.

738
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,423
I only just now plucked up
the courage to reveal myself.

739
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,584
Really?

740
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,486
No.

My dad's in the health food store.
He could drive past.

743
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,868
It's nice to see
your mates again.

745
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,200
Yeah. Always a pleasure.

746
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,215
Well,
I'll see you around, maybe.

747
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,788
Sure, yeah.

748
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,523
I know you're looking.

749
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,593
I'm not looking.

750
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:58,827
Liar.

751
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,472
DAD: Perhaps you should think
about going back to school.

752
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,637
A bit of
normality in your life.

753
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,875
I'm not going back to school.

754
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:16,247
There's got to be some perks
to terminal illness.

756
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,356
I'm killing you, right?

757
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:23,886
Every day.

Watch out, mate.

760
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,691
Bloody idiot.

761
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,931
What's this guy up to?

(INAUDIBLE)

TESSA: That was good.

767
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,271
A ride on a motorbike.

768
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,807
Should have been on my list.

769
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,671
What is? Name one.

770
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:50,004
Fame.

771
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,581
How famous do you want to be?

772
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,781
Enough for the whole world
to stop what it's doing

773
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,254
and personally come and say
goodbye to me when I die.

774
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,116
I think it's good you're not
asking too much there.

775
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,295
I just want to have my name
out there somewhere, you know.

776
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,463
You don't have to worry
about being forgotten, Tess.

777

Anything else?

778
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:27,708
Yeah.

I just thought of another.

781

You're not gonna swim naked.

782
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:41,119
No way. You think I'm crazy?

783
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,292
Not naked.

784

See, the great thing is,

803
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,784
I have actually always wondered

804
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,445
if it was possible to
dry yourself with a sock.

805
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,322
Thanks for doing that with me.

You can't save me.

When you were a baby,

829
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:40,125
me and your mum used to lie awake
at night watching you breathe.

830

We were convinced
that if we stopped looking,

831

you'd forget how to do it.

a different kind of worry.

overrated anyway.

spread to your spinal fluid.

quickly than we first thought.

further down the line.

in an man's life

brings a boy home.

find her attractive,

916

done is told you everything.

Because at your age, you shouldn't
have to be nursing someone.

do us all a favor,

what's left of her life.

to lend you the car?

speaking to him.

01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,042
When he's not with me,
I think I've made him up.

1072
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:34,605
He didn't call or come
after us, or anything?

1073
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:37,778
No.

1074
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,585
Maybe I did make him up.

1075
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,955
Good God.

1076
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:49,354
What?

1077
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,463
There, on the bridge.

1078
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,073
That's odd.

1079
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:08,909
You're everywhere, Tessa!

1080
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,067
TESSA: He's done it.

1081
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,573
He's put my name in the world.

1082
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,946
Juggling clubs!
You brought me juggling clubs!

1083
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,816
Happy birthday.

1084
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:49,981
Can you do these?

1085
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,689
Yeah. A bit, yeah.

1086
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,453
I'll help you
practice later if you want.

1087
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:55,556
Dad, can Adam stay for dinner?

1088
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:56,788
No.

1089
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:58,590
Mum...

1090
01:10:58,654 --> 01:10:59,826
I don't live here, do I?

1091
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,795
DAD: Thank you.

1092
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:02,995
But let him stay.

1093
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:04,971
It's a conspiracy.

1094
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,002
CAL: All right,
on with the magic show.

1095
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,168
Pick a card.

1096
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:13,803
Five of hearts.

1097
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,139
No.

1098
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:17,682
One day I'll get the right one,

1099
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,183
and you'll all crap yourselves.

1100
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:21,948
Oh, nice. He's allowed
to say that, is he?

1101
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:23,752
It's only "crap."

1102
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:26,815
(MOUTHING)

1103
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,450
TESSA: Well, that's another
one to cross off the list.

1104
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,885
(LAUGHS)

1105
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,851
How's the list going?

1106
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:01,322
Things I thought mattered
don't matter so much anymore.

1107
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,727
How about you? Got anything
you wanna put up there?

1108
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,499
I'm fine.

1109
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,200
I mean, there are
things I've kind of,

1110
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:16,334
you know, opted out of I guess.

1111
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,405
No, I'm not like you like that.

1112
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,484
I don't...

1113
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,209
Adam?

1114
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,412
Yeah.

1115
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:31,321
You've got to get in the game.

1116
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,496
So have a think.

1117
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:41,695
What are your hopes,
your dreams?

1118
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,566
Right now?

1119
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:48,434
Yeah.

1120
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,845
CAL: Let go of my hand.
Let go of my hand.

1121
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:01,410
I'll wipe out.

1122
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:03,013
Yeah, but I'll be miles away.

1123
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:07,020
Go on, all the way across.
Just lean forward and run.

1124
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:08,686
You can do it.

1125
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,955
Lean and run, got it.

1126
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:16,465
Get in!
Tessa Scott is in the house!

1127
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:21,630
Cal, how do you stop?

1128
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:22,731
Use the wall.

1129
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:24,607
Cal!
Use the wall!

1130
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,575
Hi, babe.

1131
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,478
Hey.

1132
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,580
You looked good out there.

1133
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:39,150
I kept falling down.
My bum hurts.

1134
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,292
You should put some ice on it.

1135
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,801
I'm keeping the baby.

1136
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:55,803
Really?

1137
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,902
Yeah. Yes.

1138
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,449
It's a girl.
I'm having a girl.

1139
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,288
And I'm gonna call her Lauren.

1140
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,915
That's what I'm gonna do.

1141
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,925
I want to be there.

1142
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,726
If you don't want me
in the birth,

1143
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,528
then I can sit outside
and come in afterwards.

1144
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:25,703
I want to be one
of the first people

1145
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,763
in the world to
ever hold your baby.

1146
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,011
It's five months away.

1147
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:37,381
Then it's something to aim for.

1148
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:11,379
You see, some people would
find this beautiful.

1149
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,817
But all I can think is, it's
killing my poor vegetables.

1150
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,619
(CHUCKLES)

1151
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,022
Hey, what's up, Tess?

1152
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:23,691
It's not enough. Us. This.

1153
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,256
How do you mean?

1154
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:29,899
Stay with me. Stay the nights.

1155
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,939
What do you want from me, Tess?

1156
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:41,742
Nighttime. Sleeping together.
Waking up together. Breakfast.

1157
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:46,044
What do you really want?

1158
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,453
I want you to be
with me in the dark.

1159
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,352
To hold me.

1160
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,695
To keep loving me.

1161
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,602
To help me when I get scared.

1162
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,770
To come right to the edge
and see what's there.

1163
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,441
What if I get it wrong?

1164
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:23,086
It's impossible to get wrong.

1165
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,272
For you.

1166
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,176
It's a snow angel.

1167
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,990
<i>No. No, no and no.</i>

1168
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:00,990
Dad...
Is this on the list?

1169
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:04,087
A boy staying over?
Forget it. No.

1170
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,189
You know, this is
not easy for me to ask.

1171
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:08,264
Well, it's very easy
for me to answer.

1172
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,032
I thought you wanted to talk.
Not about this.

1173
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,102
I won't permit it.
End of discussion.

1174
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:14,933
Don't pull rank on me.

1175
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,504
I have rank. I'm your father.

1176
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:21,110
Not for much longer.

1177
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,448
Are you ready?

1178
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:33,550
(PANTING) It's too far.

1179
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:34,616
Just jump.

1180
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:36,356
It's too bloody far.

1181
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,158
Good night then.

1182
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,893
Wait.

1183
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:42,558
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:43,792
Psyching myself up.

1185
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,031
Oh, is that gonna take a while,

1186
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,332
'cause I quite
fancy a cup of tea.

01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,569
Are you all right?
No.

1190
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,041
I've broken my arm.

1191
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:55,570
Both arms.

1192
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,015
I've broken everything.

Ow.

01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,554
But you're here.

DAD: He's in there, isn't he?

1197
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:51,363
Yes.

1198
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,067
I told you I didn't want that.

1199
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:57,937
I know.

1200
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,212
You know why?

1201
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,174
I think so.

1202
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,273
He's a good kid, Tessa.

1203
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,551
But a kid is all he is.
You can't rely on him.

1204
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,953
He might let you down.

1205
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:12,550
He won't.

1206
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:15,589
What if he does?

1207
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:22,592
Then I'll still have you.
Like always.

I think they fry
the onions in hair oil.

1211
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,786
Because we're worth it.

1212
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,975
I wish I could do that.

1213
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,203
You can't?

1214
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:05,870
No.

1215
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,278
I can do like two
and then they just die.

1216
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:09,974
I'll teach you.

1217
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,511
I'll put it on my new list.

Along with what?

1219
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,052
Too many things.

1220
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:24,728
Spring. Daffodils and tulips.

1221
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:28,527
A long train journey.

1222
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,335

Listening to you
snore for years and years.

1226
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,612
I don't snore. Do I snore?

1227
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:42,072
You will when you get old.

1228
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,915
To go to a parents' evening,
and our child's a genius.

Being with you.

Being with you.

corners of Tessa's bed.

1249
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:37,396
Which is pretty bloody gross,
but I figure...

1250
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:40,432
What?

1251
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,269
What is it?

1252
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:49,875
Tessa?

1253
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:53,913
Where's your father?

1254
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:58,989
Telling my mum something.
What's he telling her?

1255
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,628
Let's wait for them
to join us, shall we?

1256
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:07,226
It's me that's sick, not them.

1257
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:11,899
How sick, please?

1258
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:18,802
Your latest
blood counts are very low.

1259
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:23,339
Your immune system
is in collapse.

1260
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:28,284
The cancer is now everywhere.

1261
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,985
How much longer do I have?

1262
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,660
I don't want to be
drawn into time scales.

1263
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:41,624
I won't sue you
if you're wrong.

1264
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:47,971
My best friend's due in April.

1265
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:51,842
Will I get to meet her baby?

1266
01:22:57,605 --> 01:22:58,675
No.

1267
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:38,122
Adam?

1268
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:55,333
Is Adam here?

1269
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:58,305
Oh, no, I'm sorry, darling. He
won't be back till this evening.

1270
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,207
That's too late.
Where's he gone?

1271
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,976
He's on the train.
For the Open Day.

1272
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,745
Open Day?
Yeah, at the university.

1273
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,880
I was so thrilled
when he said he was

1274
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:12,582
taking up his
place in September.

1275
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:14,750
There were times when I thought

1276
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:16,261
we'd be waiting
another 12 months.

1277
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:20,660
No one wants to be the oldest
kid in the class, do they?

1278
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:25,565
No. No one wants that.

1291
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:25,822
You should've shown me.

eat much from now on.

you handle these last few days
