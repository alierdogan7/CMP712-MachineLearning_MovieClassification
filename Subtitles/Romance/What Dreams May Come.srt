What am I on? You're real fuzzy.

00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:52,345
You're losing your fear.

179
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:53,995
Fear?

180
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:56,750
[Doc] That you disappeared.

181
00:16:56,837 --> 00:17:00,989
You didn't. You only died.

182
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:08,073
A woman...who lost her children
just four years ago.

183
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:11,706
Every day in the Lord's Prayer.

184
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,676
Celia...come on. Whoa.

185
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,586
Shhhhh...

186
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,906
This one is a present...for me.

187
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:26,228
It's our Double D-anniversary.

188
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:29,514
Kind of our special day.

189
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:32,475
It's her version of our place.

190
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:35,151
- Your place?
- Where we first met.

191
00:18:36,597 --> 00:18:40,476
Where we were
going to retire, I guess.

192
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:44,391
Live out our lives.
Be old farts together.

193
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:47,037
Right there.

194
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:50,154
That's our dream house.

195
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:52,273
That one's me, I guess.

196
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:58,991
The blurry one is Annie.
Looks a little familiar, Doc.

197
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:02,752
[Laughs]

198
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:12,222
The funeral is over. Why is
this going on past the funeral?

199
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,813
[Annie] 'Dear Diary,

200
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:20,612
'l'm writing because
my shrink is crazier than me.

201
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
'He thinks you're therapy.

00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:26,972
'lf two babies can

204
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:31,853
'He's so stupid.

00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:34,855
'He thinks he pulled me

00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:39,253
'Always. Only Chris.'

208
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:40,776
Jesus...

209
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:43,457
'l was looking through
his postcards.

210
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:45,659
'Paintings were his obsession.

'He used art to love me,

00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:52,775
'To keep us always together.

00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,494
I'm here, babe.

214
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,813
I still exist.

215
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,093
You're thinking of me.

216
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,651
Keep thinking of me.

217
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:10,496
Come on, with me.

218
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,380
You were always with me.

219
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:17,173
The people who finished each
other's sentences. Remember us?

220
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:21,495
I still exist.

221
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:25,342
I still exist!

222
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:30,859
(l still exist.)

223
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:33,059
Just write it down.

224
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:38,257
Write it down.

225
00:20:40,223 --> 00:20:42,657
[Chris] "This is Chris."

226
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:48,293
"This...is...Chris."

227
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:56,220
"I...

"exist."

230
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:16,778
Read it.

231
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:18,535
READ it.

232
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:52,097
[Chris]
Christ, when does it end?

233
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:55,453
[Chris]
Christ, when does it end?

234
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:58,005
[Doc] There's no rules, Chris.

235
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:00,292
It ends when you want.

236
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:04,086
- Where were you?
- Someplace else.

237
00:22:04,177 --> 00:22:06,532
You think I'm a figment
of your imagination?

238
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:10,166
She's real. You're real.
It's all real.

239
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:13,567
That's the point
if there is one.

240
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:17,650
It's over when you stop
wanting to hurt her.

241
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:34,095
Forever...

242
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:47,776
Don't worry, baby...

243
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:50,690
I'm not leaving you alone.

244
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:52,893
I'm not going anywhere.

245
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:54,774
[Screams hysterically]

246
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,127
Goodbye, babe.

247
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,447
[Birds singing]

248
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:26,775
[Barking]

249
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:41,297
Katie, it's you !

250
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:43,845
You're young again!

251
00:24:47,577 --> 00:24:49,647
Come here, Katie! [Laughs]

252
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:52,171
Katie, Katie!

253
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:58,611
Come on, hey!

254
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:04,209
Boy, I screwed up.
I'm in dog heaven.

255
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:17,413
A place where we all go
can't be bad, can it, girl?

256
00:25:43,617 --> 00:25:46,609
Maybe I'm not
in your heaven after all!

257
00:25:46,697 --> 00:25:48,289
Maybe you're in mine!

258
00:25:48,377 --> 00:25:50,413
[Katie barks]

259
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:58,653
Annie!

260
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:32,333
[Doc]
What the hell have you done?

261
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:35,017
That's not how
you use a stethoscope!

262
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:36,616
Albert Lewis?

263
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:41,299
Last time you saw me
I was 63, on a cardiac ward!

264
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:44,295
You thought I was old
and decrepit, huh?

265
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:47,056
Talking about "Ah, can't go on!"

266
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:51,136
Who wants to be 63
throughout eternity?

267
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:55,262
- Look at you on the water!
- Well, hello! Come on...

268
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:58,221
walk along, feel the beat!

269
00:26:58,303 --> 00:27:01,295
Dancing on water!
Smooth as ever!

270
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:05,411
And that was you...

271
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:09,052
just now, when...when I died.

272
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:13,261
I thought you recognised me,
because you called me "Doc".

273
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:16,221
Me being your favourite doc.

274
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:21,423
Could you lend me a hand? I'm
up to my ass in problems again.

275
00:27:21,503 --> 00:27:24,620
Oh, Chris...

276
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:27,495
Come here.

277
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:30,017
You are still kinda ugly.

278
00:27:31,623 --> 00:27:35,741
You taught me a lot, Chief.
Nice place you got here.

279
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:38,383
No, no.
Nice place you got here.

280
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:42,422
- Me?
- Sure, you're making all this.

281
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:46,655
We're insecure at first,
so we need safety and comfort.

282
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:50,577
We all paint our surroundings,
but you use real paint!

283
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:54,212
There's so much here
she didn't paint.

284
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:56,981
Like that bird.

285
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:02,093
Annie gave you a start,
like holding onto handrails.

286
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:03,935
You're creating a world.

287
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:08,494
From your imagination,
from anything you want.

288
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:12,576
- Why doesn't it move?
- It will when you want it to.

289
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:21,339
Oh-hoh! You go, boy!

290
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:24,256
- Can I make it dive?
- You're the painter!

291
00:28:24,343 --> 00:28:26,903
[Doc] It's your world!

292
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:31,499
[Doc] Look at it go!

293
00:28:32,783 --> 00:28:36,093
- How about turquoise wings?
- Turquoise!

294
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:39,414
[Chris]
And a little mauve, all right!

295
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:57,774
- I didn't do that.
- No, I did.

296
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:00,821
When we're together
it's like dual controls.

297
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:05,419
- Can I make elephants fly?
- Didn't Annie paint a house?

298
00:29:10,463 --> 00:29:14,217
Yeah, it's our dream house.

299
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:18,820
[Doc] Just a stroll
across the water.

300
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:21,133
Let's take the shortcut.

301
00:29:25,183 --> 00:29:28,698
- Nice shortcut.
- It's easy, look at me!

302
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:32,742
- I'm gonna drown.
- You're already dead.

303
00:29:32,823 --> 00:29:35,542
Am l...am I really here?

304
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:40,492
What do you mean by "you"?
Your arm or your leg?

305
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,653
- Partly.
- Really?

306
00:29:42,743 --> 00:29:46,452
- And if you lost your limbs?
- I'd still be me.

307
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:50,138
- What is the "me"?
- My brain, I suppose.

308
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:53,579
Your brain?
Your brain is a body part.

309
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:57,656
Like your fingernail
or your heart. Why is that you?

310
00:29:57,743 --> 00:30:01,656
Because "I" am a voice
in my head.

311
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:03,620
The part that thinks, feels.

312
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:06,263
That is aware that I exist.

313
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:15,779
[Doc] So if you're aware
you exist...then you do.

314
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:17,979
That's why you're still here.

315
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:35,461
[Doc] No windows. What aren't
you ready to see, I wonder?

316
00:30:37,863 --> 00:30:42,254
Drink it. Think it's
coffee and it will be.

317
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:44,174
OK.

318
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:46,823
It's coffee...

319
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:48,973
Paint!

320
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:50,416
Acrylic.

321
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:54,382
- [Doc] Why is it so hard?
- What?

322
00:30:54,463 --> 00:30:57,739
Your brain is meat.
It rots and disappears.

323
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,815
You thought that's all
there was to you?

324
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:06,054
Like you're in your house now.

325
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:09,374
You're IN your house,
you AREN'T your house.

326
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:12,899
The house falls down,
you walk away.

327
00:31:12,983 --> 00:31:14,974
But I rebuilt, huh?

328
00:31:15,063 --> 00:31:17,623
You see your body
because you like seeing one.

329
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:21,491
We're seeing
what we choose to see.

330
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,938
Let me show you something.

331
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,415
Ha!

332
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,697
[Chris] It's real.
Where is the paint?

333
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:02,334
[Doc] You don't need it any
more. This is your world now.

334
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:06,257
Thought is real.

335
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:11,701
Physical is the illusion.
Ironic, huh?

336
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:18,053
- Where's God in all this?
- He's up there.

337
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:22,022
Somewhere...
Shouting down that he loves us.

338
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:25,300
Wondering why we can't hear him.
You think?

339
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:30,700
Drink your coffee.

340
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:34,014
- Needs milk.
- Don't push your luck.

341
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:47,885
'What do you think, Christy?

342
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:50,115
'What do you think, Christy?

343
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,518
'Right here.

344
00:32:56,445 --> 00:32:59,039
'Like this? You think?

345
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:17,795
'They say we live
in our minds anyway.

346
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:24,279
'Having you with me,
like this, keeps me happy.

347
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:29,917
'Why do I believe
you can hear me?

348
00:33:30,005 --> 00:33:33,077
'Why do I think
you can see this?'

349
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,720
[Chris] What's that purple tree?
I never saw that.

350
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:45,878
Let's look. Think you can
get there in eight seconds?

351
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:49,514
Eight seconds? Over there?

352
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:52,756
Yeah, I just need
a little incentive.

353
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:14,083
Yeah... I can fly...

354
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,474
- No!
- Can't I do what I want?

355
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:20,558
I think you'd be more
comfortable keeping it real.

356
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:23,955
Think of running fast,
like the Road Runner, OK?

357
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:32,157
I can handle this.

358
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:37,320
Adios, muchacho.

359
00:34:38,765 --> 00:34:40,756
Oh... Wait ! Chris !

360
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,198
Annie!!

361
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,804
I bet you're thinking
"Oh, shit!" now!

362
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:53,035
Aaaaahhhh!

363
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:10,074
- Yeah!
- Go, boy!

364
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:18,078
Go, Chris, go!

365
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:45,043
Albert!

366
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:47,559
Albert!

367
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:59,843
It's completely new. The canvas
was blank when I was alive.

368
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:04,635
How can I see
this drawing after I'm dead?

369
00:36:04,725 --> 00:36:08,240
For an expert
you look pretty surprised.

370
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:12,159
- You two. A long courtship?
- No, actually.

371
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:15,601
- From the first moment...
- Soulmates.

372
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:19,234
It's extremely rare,
but it exists.

373
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:23,284
Like twin souls.
Tuned in to each other.

374
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:26,118
Apparently, even in death.

375
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:30,119
You're reaching each other
through her painting.

376
00:36:30,205 --> 00:36:33,595
It's nothing
I've ever seen.

377
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:37,923
'You can't see it, can you?

378
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,640
'And you never will.'

379
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,882
I love you!

380
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:09,713
[Chris]
Whose footprints are these?

381
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:12,070
Don't ask,
you put 'em here.

382
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,868
Annie...

383
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:28,264
- Annie!
- [Doc] Chris!

384
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:39,153
Fantasy is not what you need.

385
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:43,194
No, you're right. I need Annie.

386
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:49,464
- That'll change in time.
- Oh, come on, Einstein!

387
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:54,424
Time's not on my watch any more!
Time does not exist here!

388
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:58,224
Wherever it went, it won't
make me need Annie less.

389
00:39:00,235 --> 00:39:03,193
You'll feel differently,
and so will she.

390
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:06,824
Man... You don't know us.

391
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:10,353
Wish I did.

392
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,468
[Chris] Marie...

393
00:39:18,555 --> 00:39:20,511
Marie!

394
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:30,026
Look, it's Tigger!
It's my daughter's!

395
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:32,993
Katie tore it up once, and...

396
00:39:36,715 --> 00:39:38,785
She's here, right?

397
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,389
Where is she?

398
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:46,949
"Here" is big enough
for all to have their universe.

399
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:52,830
That's not why you
haven't seen them yet, is it?

400
00:39:54,235 --> 00:39:57,068
What does that mean, Buddha?

401
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:59,874
I wanna see my children, Albert!

402
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,153
When you do, you will.

403
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:22,792
Does that hurt?

404
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,024
Mm-mm.

405
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:25,264
That?

406
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:26,708
Mm-hm.

407
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:28,672
How about that?

408
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:32,031
I'm gonna keep doing this
till you tickle.

409
00:40:35,635 --> 00:40:38,786
You've got a fever.
It's going down, though.

410
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,673
Don't you have to go somewhere?

411
00:40:43,115 --> 00:40:44,787
Wanna play chess?

412
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,946
I could teach you.

413
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:53,710
Would you teach me that?

414
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:22,826
Excuse me.

415
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:29,034
Albert has to work.
He asked me to meet with you.

416
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:32,073
Will that be all right?

417
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:35,352
Leona...
That's a very beautiful name.

418
00:41:35,435 --> 00:41:37,790
He said you've been isolated.

419
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:42,312
Do you wanna see others?
Perhaps a city?

420
00:41:42,395 --> 00:41:45,307
I would,
but travel makes me nauseous.

421
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,074
Close your eyes.

422
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:57,465
I didn't mean forever.

423
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,465
[Laughs] What do you think?

424
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:12,785
I'm a little under-dressed.

425
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,354
You look fine.

426
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:18,587
Till now you've been painting
your world. This is mine.

427
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:23,954
In our city across the river
we have to have a common vision.

428
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:39,751
So, there's work.

429
00:42:39,835 --> 00:42:40,790
Mm-hm.

430
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,308
I like that.

431
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:46,149
Albert is sort of a missionary.

432
00:42:46,235 --> 00:42:49,432
- He saves lost souls.
- Like me.

433
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:54,270
Hardly. They are the ones
who can't get here.

434
00:42:54,355 --> 00:42:56,073
You mean, from hell?

435
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:59,352
In a way.
It's not what you think.

436
00:42:59,435 --> 00:43:02,791
My work is with animals.

437
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:07,550
Katie is an old friend.

438
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:09,034
'Dearest Christy.

439
00:43:09,115 --> 00:43:11,868
'l don't know how
this day unravelled.

440
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:17,188
'l was proud of how I held
together through this afternoon.

441
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:21,473
'But, coming home,
I began to lose it.

442
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:24,228
'lf I had walked out that night,

443
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:26,875
'you wouldn't have been
in the tunnel.

444
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:31,824
'A whole family lost
in car crashes.

445
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:33,906
'Enough to make a person
buy a bike.'

446
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:40,312
[Chris] Where are they going?

447
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:44,792
- To help others be reborn.
- Really? Reincarnation?

448
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,754
Albert says to cheer you up.

449
00:43:55,841 --> 00:44:00,153
- You have difficulty...
- ..losing my wife, yeah.

450
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:05,998
- And your children?
- They died years ago.

451
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:08,754
That's why I'm worried
about my wife.

452
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,591
They died
in a terrible collision.

453
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:15,798
The nanny was driving.
It wasn't her fault.

454
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:18,395
And your wife?

455
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:22,156
My daughter
had asked her to drive.

456
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:25,119
[Children's laughter]

457
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,634
It was a trucker's fault.

458
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:44,191
But my wife believed
that if she'd been driving,

459
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,273
her protective instincts
would have...

460
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:01,510
Are you OK?

461
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:09,751
Come on, Katie!

462
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:25,638
[Leona] Where were you just now?

463
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:28,758
Your mind's been wandering
all afternoon.

464
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:31,275
Thinking of someone.

465
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:36,993
Your wife must have loved
her children very much.

466
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:38,560
Very much.

467
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:44,591
But you don't have to break
in half to love somebody.

468
00:45:44,681 --> 00:45:48,469
Tell me a memory of your own.

469
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:51,200
Say, with your daughter.

470
00:46:08,481 --> 00:46:12,997
Hey...
That's somebody else's art.

471
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:16,198
What's the difference?
You weren't looking anyway.

472
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:22,119
Your move.

473
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:27,471
Is this where we go when we die?

474
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:35,517
It's a dream, baby.
It's beautiful,

475
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:39,879
- but you know, dreams...
- ..l know, aren't real.

476
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:47,119
- It's after midnight.
- I haven't won yet.

477
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:49,795
- It's your first time.
- No, I like that.

478
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:55,478
Means you're not cheating.
And when I win, I really win.

479
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:57,791
I wanna play till I do.

480
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:01,556
- Unless you wanna stop.
- No. Let's play till you win.

481
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:07,598
'She died three months later.'

482
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:10,593
We played every night.

483
00:47:12,401 --> 00:47:14,961
It meant the world to me.

484
00:47:16,281 --> 00:47:18,556
She never won.

485
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:48,275
I didn't look like this
in the body, you know.

486
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,759
We flew to Singapore once.
And...

487
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:57,993
..my daddy smiled at
the flight attendant who...

488
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:03,278
Iooked like this
and wore this name tag.

489
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,474
He said Asian women are so...

490
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:15,118
Iovely...and graceful...

491
00:48:15,201 --> 00:48:18,557
- and intelligent.
- He didn't mean only.

492
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:20,871
I know.
It was something he said.

493
00:48:20,961 --> 00:48:25,591
And I thought, when I grow up,
I wanna be that.

494
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:30,474
You still play chess?

495
00:48:38,881 --> 00:48:42,112
I think I waited for my partner.

496
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:26,717
'l swear that California
is the strangest place.

497
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:28,630
'They push you into it

498
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,428
'so you can do it before
your shrink commits you.

499
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:35,716
'Thoughtful legislation there.

00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:38,154
'Mine is suspicious.

501
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:40,309
'Another week,
he might commit me.

502
00:49:40,399 --> 00:49:42,276
'For my own safety.

503
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:47,995
'l had the husband

'And the truth is, simply...

'that it's over.

'Just this one loose end

510
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:21,555
'l don't get to say goodbye.

511
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,908
'But I'll tell you what -

'across whatever

00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,674
'l send you my love.'

514
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:48,390
Hey.

515
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:53,033
- Where were you?
- Far away.

516
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,749
I got called back.
I was working.

517
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,717
There are no words
to thank you.

518
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:02,755
For finding Marie.

519
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,797
[Sighs]

520
00:51:05,879 --> 00:51:07,995
- Is she OK?
- She's fine.

521
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,434
You'll see her soon.

522
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:14,797
She sends her love.
Especially now.

523
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:26,350
We'll go through
something very hard right now.

524
00:51:26,439 --> 00:51:29,112
I'm with you. You're not alone.

525
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:33,435
Annie is dead.

526
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:39,554
She killed herself.

527
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:47,513
It's nothing I ever expected.

528
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,157
Like I said, you don't know us.

529
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,396
Is that an occupational hazard
of soulmates?

530
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:00,073
One's not much
without the other?

531
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:04,914
But she's OK.

532
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:07,593
Because her pain is over.

533
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,512
- You don't understand.
- She won't cling like me.

534
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:13,557
- When do I see her?
- Never.

535
00:52:16,279 --> 00:52:20,113
You'll never see her.
Suicides go somewhere else.

536
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:23,874
- Why are you punishing her?
- It's not punishment.

537
00:52:23,959 --> 00:52:27,315
- She's suffered enough.
- There are no judges or crimes.

538
00:52:27,399 --> 00:52:30,038
Everybody's equal.
That's the way things work!

539
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,917
And suicides go to hell?

540
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:36,548
No goddamn judgment in that!

541
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:38,630
You wanna fight?

542
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,470
You can hide from it
or understand it.

543
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,916
"Hell" is for those
who don't know they're dead.

544
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:52,436
They can't realise what
they've done or what's happened.

545
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:55,750
- Too self-absorbed that they...
- Self-absorbed?!

546
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,558
That doesn't apply
to Annie, all right?

547
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:03,388
No, it doesn't.
Suicides are different.

548
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:07,791
They don't go to hell because
they're immoral or selfish.

549
00:53:07,879 --> 00:53:12,714
There's a natural order
to our journey.

550
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:15,154
Annie has violated that.

551
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:17,799
She won't face it.

552
00:53:17,879 --> 00:53:22,669
She won't realise,
accept what she's done.

553
00:53:22,759 --> 00:53:25,353
She will spend eternity
playing that out.

554
00:53:25,439 --> 00:53:30,069
- You still say she's in hell.
- Everybody's hell is different.

555
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:32,832
Real hell
is your life gone wrong.

556
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:55,117
I'm her soul mate.
I can find her.

557
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,948
- You don't understand how...
- It's not about understanding!

558
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:09,394
It's about not giving up.

559
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:14,470
You said there are no rules.
And the tree?

560
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,349
You were pretty surprised then.
Hey, if there are no rules,

561
00:54:19,439 --> 00:54:22,192
how can you say
ALL suicides are the same?

562
00:54:22,279 --> 00:54:24,634
- I can't, I can't.
- OK.

563
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,711
-Or she doesn't know she's dead?
-I can't.

564
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:31,872
No one has ever seen
a suicide brought back!

565
00:54:31,959 --> 00:54:34,757
Stick around, Chief.
You ain't seen nothing yet.

566
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,584
OK. You deserve your chance.
We'll find a tracker.

567
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:04,588
Hey!

568
00:56:11,155 --> 00:56:13,510
This the guy
who doesn't give up?

569
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:18,306
Anyone tell you too much
persistence can get stupid?

570
00:56:18,395 --> 00:56:21,546
- Constantly.
- I hear the same thing.

571
00:56:21,635 --> 00:56:24,672
I also hear I read too slow.

572
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:29,624
I don't need glasses. Eyes being
a figment of my imagination.

573
00:56:29,715 --> 00:56:33,071
You'll hear a lot
of smart stuff here.

574
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:34,634
It's usually right.

575
00:56:34,715 --> 00:56:37,229
- Don't let it screw you up.
- I won't.

576
00:56:37,315 --> 00:56:41,228
Your wife love you as strong?

577
00:56:48,515 --> 00:56:50,426
We'll find her.

578
00:56:50,515 --> 00:56:53,393
But when you find her...

579
00:56:53,475 --> 00:56:56,785
nothing will make her
recognise you.

580
00:56:56,875 --> 00:57:00,072
Nothing will break her denial.

581
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:02,032
It's stronger than her love.

582
00:57:02,115 --> 00:57:05,630
In fact, reinforced by her love.

583
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:09,151
You can say everything
you long to say.

584
00:57:09,235 --> 00:57:11,954
Including goodbye.

585
00:57:12,035 --> 00:57:15,471
Even if she can't understand it.

586
00:57:15,555 --> 00:57:19,434
You'll have the satisfaction
that you didn't give up.

587
00:57:21,035 --> 00:57:22,991
That has to be enough.

588
00:57:23,075 --> 00:57:25,987
Get me there.
I decide what's enough.

589
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:30,267
When do we leave?

590
00:57:31,635 --> 00:57:33,785
Close your eyes.

591
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:48,229
- [Chris] Albert's a sweet kid.
- [Tracker] He is that.

592
00:57:48,315 --> 00:57:51,466
There's a tenderness
I never knew in life.

593
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:54,194
I didn't know him
when he was young.

594
00:57:54,275 --> 00:57:57,551
Were you proud of your own kids?

595
00:57:58,635 --> 00:58:01,069
Of course.

596
00:58:01,155 --> 00:58:04,352
That's an easy bullshit answer.

597
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:07,953
Think about it.

598
00:58:09,355 --> 00:58:12,427
I said "Of course."

599
00:58:12,515 --> 00:58:14,346
I like this sore point.

600
00:58:14,435 --> 00:58:17,233
It's juice, juice is strong.
It connects.

601
00:58:17,315 --> 00:58:21,024
Makes you
a better receiver for Annie.

602
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:27,232
She's the transmitter,
sending thoughts of you.

603
00:58:50,835 --> 00:58:55,067
- What did you do when alive?
- You mean the last time?

604
00:58:55,155 --> 00:59:00,229
We can be reborn.
But only if we choose to.

605
00:59:00,315 --> 00:59:05,070
- I did the same work...
- You were a shrink!

606
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:07,715
Fairly perceptive.

607
00:59:13,555 --> 00:59:16,945
- Oh, my God.
- You expected physical danger?

608
00:59:21,995 --> 00:59:24,828
What could it do, kill you?

609
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:28,544
No, in hell,
there's real danger.

610
00:59:28,635 --> 00:59:31,468
Of losing your mind.

611
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,423
[Screaming]

612
01:00:09,235 --> 01:00:12,944
[Annie] Because
he's drowning, that's why.

613
01:00:16,595 --> 01:00:19,826
- He's 13 years old!
- I know.

614
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:22,588
He needs to hang out
with his friends.

615
01:00:22,675 --> 01:00:28,193
Veg out in front of the TV,
read a fucking book he likes!

616
01:00:28,275 --> 01:00:31,551
- He doesn't wanna let me down?
- No, it's worse...

617
01:00:31,635 --> 01:00:34,911
He's so into you, he feels
he's letting himself down.

618
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:37,748
He thinks he's shit.

619
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:39,473
How sick is that?

620
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,867
How can you take me
out of school?

621
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:50,946
How can you?

622
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:52,753
This is my life!

623
01:00:52,835 --> 01:00:55,395
Don't you think
I can make it?

624
01:00:55,475 --> 01:00:59,548
- If I really dig in...
- You have to show me more!

625
01:00:59,635 --> 01:01:02,513
Come on! You're blowing it, lan!

626
01:01:02,595 --> 01:01:04,267
I'm not you!

627
01:01:29,817 --> 01:01:31,694
[Moaning]

628
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:12,692
[Chris] Shipwrecks...
What is this place?

629
01:02:12,777 --> 01:02:14,369
[Tracker]
The gateway to hell.

630
01:02:17,897 --> 01:02:21,685
How are we doing?
Picking up any signals?

631
01:02:21,777 --> 01:02:25,247
Actually...not a ripple.

632
01:02:25,337 --> 01:02:28,693
That's because
I was thinking of somebody else.

633
01:02:35,217 --> 01:02:39,972
It's a slap in the face
when you see kids taking a test

634
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:42,287
and they're breezing through it.

635
01:02:42,377 --> 01:02:45,653
And for you
it just...kinda goes.

636
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:47,887
Every day I see...

637
01:02:47,977 --> 01:02:51,652
how I'm not as good
as you and everyone else.

638
01:02:52,737 --> 01:02:56,127
But that doesn't mean I give up.

639
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:02,691
[Doc] Hey!

640
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:45,405
[Doc] "Cerberus" - the guardian.

641
01:03:59,057 --> 01:04:01,366
How do you feel?

642
01:04:01,457 --> 01:04:05,655
More than I want you
in and out of school,

643
01:04:05,737 --> 01:04:09,047
I want to know
how you feel at night.

644
01:04:11,257 --> 01:04:13,134
Real scared.

645
01:04:14,777 --> 01:04:17,211
I know I believe in you.

646
01:04:19,017 --> 01:04:21,611
If I was going through
fucking hell,

647
01:04:21,697 --> 01:04:25,656
I'd only want one person
in the goddamn world with me.

648
01:04:35,217 --> 01:04:36,696
[Choir sings]

649
01:04:43,657 --> 01:04:45,534
There's a man...

650
01:04:46,697 --> 01:04:49,575
Ian never got to know.

651
01:04:51,297 --> 01:04:55,575
The man...
he was growing up to be.

652
01:04:59,457 --> 01:05:02,813
He's a good-looking,
clear-eyed young fella...

653
01:05:02,897 --> 01:05:04,888
..about 25.

654
01:05:07,097 --> 01:05:09,327
I can see him.

655
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:15,975
He's the type of guy
men want to be around.

656
01:05:16,057 --> 01:05:18,446
Because he has integrity,
you know?

657
01:05:20,297 --> 01:05:24,006
He has character.
You can't fake that.

658
01:05:27,777 --> 01:05:31,656
And he's a guy
women want to be around, too.

659
01:05:34,137 --> 01:05:36,287
Because there's
tenderness in him.

660
01:05:37,577 --> 01:05:39,727
Respect...

661
01:05:39,817 --> 01:05:41,728
Loyalty...

662
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:43,409
Courage...

663
01:05:45,577 --> 01:05:48,216
And women respond to that.

664
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:53,655
Makes him a terrific husband.

665
01:05:55,097 --> 01:05:58,851
I see him as a father.

666
01:05:58,937 --> 01:06:01,326
That's where he really shines.

667
01:06:05,097 --> 01:06:09,773
See, when he looks
in his kid's eyes -

668
01:06:11,497 --> 01:06:15,536
and the kid knows
that his dad really sees him -

669
01:06:15,617 --> 01:06:18,290
he sees who he is.

670
01:06:18,377 --> 01:06:23,770
Then that child knows
that he is an amazing person.

671
01:06:25,177 --> 01:06:27,532
He's quite a guy...

672
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:30,495
..that I'll never get to meet.

673
01:06:32,897 --> 01:06:35,331
'l wish I had.'

674
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,249
[Doc] Let's do it!

675
01:06:43,737 --> 01:06:47,093
[Doc]
Come on, she could be in there!

676
01:06:49,137 --> 01:06:50,490
[Violent shouting]

677
01:07:02,137 --> 01:07:04,048
No!

678
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:07,977
No! Don't!

679
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:11,447
Don't... Don't do this!

680
01:07:11,537 --> 01:07:13,653
Your mother's not in there, lan!

681
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:22,932
Your mom is not in there, son.

682
01:07:38,057 --> 01:07:41,288
There's not another man
I'd go through hell with.

683
01:07:44,697 --> 01:07:47,052
Elevator to hell. Going up.

684
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:53,093
- Come on.
- So long. Wish us luck.

685
01:07:53,177 --> 01:07:56,374
- [Doc] I'm coming.
- I'm not giving you a choice.

686
01:07:56,457 --> 01:07:58,766
[Chris] What are you saying?

687
01:07:58,857 --> 01:08:01,371
Since you suspected
Albert was your son,

688
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:04,608
- you lost your wife's signal.
- I'll concentrate harder!

689
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:07,257
You're all mouth and no chops!

690
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:10,090
All you're good for
is she loves you.

691
01:08:10,177 --> 01:08:13,453
- Your boy is a distraction.
- Damn shrinks!

692
01:08:13,537 --> 01:08:17,371
-You love shoving people around!
-We're going. His last chance.

693
01:08:17,457 --> 01:08:19,288
He's never been in such a place.

694
01:08:19,377 --> 01:08:23,609
You haven't. It's better
watching one than two.

695
01:08:23,697 --> 01:08:26,530
- You want him clear?
- Screw him, lan!

696
01:08:26,617 --> 01:08:29,529
He doesn't know us!
He's not family!

697
01:08:29,617 --> 01:08:32,290
No! I'm not leaving him!

698
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:37,568
If he never sees her?

699
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:39,773
Never says goodbye?

700
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:44,257
[Chris] We do it without him.
Let's go!

701
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:47,374
Dad! No! Listen to me.

702
01:08:50,217 --> 01:08:54,096
When you get there,
don't listen to him.

703
01:08:54,177 --> 01:08:57,408
You find her...

704
01:08:57,497 --> 01:08:59,852
and you bring her back.

705
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:03,134
You can do it.

706
01:09:03,217 --> 01:09:05,936
I believe in you.

707
01:09:15,897 --> 01:09:18,969
D'you ever think
why I chose to be Albert?

708
01:09:19,057 --> 01:09:22,652
He was the only guy
you ever listened to.

709
01:09:22,737 --> 01:09:26,366
Listen to me now!
Think about Mom!

710
01:09:26,457 --> 01:09:30,052
Think about what happened
when we died!

711
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:34,927
Think about what you said
to her to bring her back!

712
01:10:17,497 --> 01:10:19,055
'Think about Mom.'

713
01:10:23,577 --> 01:10:26,535
'Think about when we died.'

714
01:10:32,897 --> 01:10:35,127
[Annie]
I'm teaching myself to smoke.

715
01:10:37,057 --> 01:10:40,686
The doctors call it
an affirmation of life.

716
01:10:44,457 --> 01:10:47,813
Well, it beats the statue thing.

717
01:10:50,897 --> 01:10:55,175
You said "divorce".
You got my attention.

718
01:10:58,177 --> 01:11:01,567
I think that
we're too different...

719
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,729
..to stay together.

720
01:11:05,817 --> 01:11:07,455
I mean...

721
01:11:09,497 --> 01:11:12,614
Well, for one thing,
why aren't you in here?

722
01:11:14,177 --> 01:11:17,294
Why didn't you go crazy?

723
01:11:18,537 --> 01:11:20,846
Your children died.

724
01:11:20,937 --> 01:11:23,451
I remember.

725
01:11:23,537 --> 01:11:27,450
I remember the silence
in the house.

726
01:11:27,537 --> 01:11:30,927
I thought I was supposed
to be strong.

727
01:11:33,297 --> 01:11:37,210
- For me?
- For me. For us.

728
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:40,016
Just on general principles.

729
01:11:40,097 --> 01:11:45,330
I loved them, Annie.
But they're gone.

730
01:11:48,857 --> 01:11:50,654
You've got a choice.

731
01:11:50,737 --> 01:11:52,773
Life either goes on...

732
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:56,329
or not.

733
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:59,375
And you choose life.

734
01:12:02,897 --> 01:12:07,015
Sometimes,
when you win, you lose.

735
01:12:18,059 --> 01:12:20,334
[Heads talking]

736
01:12:23,259 --> 01:12:26,057
[Man] This hasn't been
a good day.

737
01:12:28,259 --> 01:12:31,057
C'mon. It's our private deck.

738
01:12:36,379 --> 01:12:39,689
[Woman] I never took more
than 30 percent from clients.

739
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:42,293
This must be it.

740
01:12:42,379 --> 01:12:45,815
- [Woman] Mister! I'm here!
- [Man] I'm coming!

741
01:12:49,059 --> 01:12:51,050
[Man]
Watch where you're stepping!

742
01:12:51,139 --> 01:12:53,334
Sorry! Excuse me!

743
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,009
[Man] Anybody got a cure?

744
01:12:59,099 --> 01:13:02,648
- No, man!
- Excuse me.

745
01:13:04,939 --> 01:13:07,692
Sorry.

746
01:13:07,779 --> 01:13:11,533
- Welcome. Welcome, son.
- Papa?

747
01:13:11,619 --> 01:13:14,850
- Son.
- Papa?

748
01:13:14,939 --> 01:13:19,296
- You're close. Welcome.
- No.

749
01:13:19,379 --> 01:13:23,577
- Welcome, welcome.
- You're not my dad, sorry.

750
01:13:23,659 --> 01:13:27,538
It's all right. They never come.

751
01:13:27,619 --> 01:13:30,895
Don't worry.
It's only a matter of time.

752
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:42,891
[Laughter]

753
01:13:42,979 --> 01:13:46,096
You don't think
it looks like a dog?

754
01:13:46,179 --> 01:13:48,693
You always take the easy ones.

755
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:52,328
That one looks like
a 24-piece dining set.

756
01:13:52,419 --> 01:13:54,535
With a soup tureen.

757
01:13:54,619 --> 01:13:56,257
Or a bunny rabbit.

758
01:13:56,339 --> 01:13:59,615
A very complex bunny rabbit.

759
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:03,049
Or a Rubenesque breast.

760
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:06,734
You always think
they're breasts.

761
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:08,457
All kinds of breasts.

762
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:11,451
I love them. Yours.

763
01:14:11,539 --> 01:14:16,852
- We'll be late for the dance!
- What's the rush?

764
01:14:18,419 --> 01:14:21,013
I know what you're doing.

765
01:14:21,099 --> 01:14:26,093
This is all just a stall.
I know why you don't wanna go.

766
01:14:26,179 --> 01:14:30,889
- Busted.
- Why don't you dance just once?

767
01:14:32,419 --> 01:14:36,651
- Other husbands are as clumsy.
- Oh, thank you.

768
01:14:40,819 --> 01:14:45,813
It's just that when everybody's
dancing I feel like I'm alone...

769
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:48,618
..in a sea of faces.

770
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:55,809
[Silent]

771
01:14:58,299 --> 01:14:59,652
Ahhh!

772
01:15:33,339 --> 01:15:36,012
Angel Falls...

773
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:38,294
[Whistles]

774
01:15:38,379 --> 01:15:40,847
It's a little expensive, yeah.

775
01:15:40,939 --> 01:15:45,694
But it's our first Double D.
Shouldn't it be incredible?

776
01:15:48,059 --> 01:15:51,938
I've never seen
anything like it.

777
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:56,171
That's my role.
To bring adventure to your life.

778
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:03,251
You...taught me...

779
01:16:03,339 --> 01:16:07,617
the only thing
I should always remember.

780
01:16:07,699 --> 01:16:10,054
Which is?

781
01:16:12,139 --> 01:16:14,334
I forgot.

782
01:16:19,499 --> 01:16:22,252
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...

783
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:25,769
It was, never give up.

784
01:16:28,339 --> 01:16:30,853
Never give up.

785
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:35,775
Never.

786
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:44,975
[Tracker] She's here.

787
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:51,097
You found her.
Impressive.

788
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:54,091
That jolt of fear for her.
It connected.

789
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:57,649
[Chris]
My God, is that our house?

790
01:17:17,139 --> 01:17:19,573
- It's like our home.
- Don't think that.

791
01:17:19,659 --> 01:17:23,208
[Tracker] It's an illusion.

792
01:17:23,299 --> 01:17:26,575
The whole place...her illusion.

793
01:17:26,659 --> 01:17:28,536
Suicides can get tortured,

794
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:30,769
committed to
punishing themselves.

795
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:32,770
Don't push her that way.

796
01:17:32,859 --> 01:17:34,611
You want to see her.

797
01:17:34,699 --> 01:17:37,896
Tell her what's in your heart.
And then go.

798
01:17:39,379 --> 01:17:41,335
- No pressure.
- Wait!

799
01:17:42,739 --> 01:17:46,049
I knew you'd find her.
You're a competitor.

800
01:17:46,139 --> 01:17:49,575
How d'you know
the first thing about me?

801
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:53,368
You called your son Albert.
Who is that?

802
01:17:53,459 --> 01:17:56,690
First doctor I interned under.

803
01:17:58,179 --> 01:18:00,613
He was like a father to me.

804
01:18:00,699 --> 01:18:03,259
His words were gold.
A brilliant mind.

805
01:18:03,339 --> 01:18:06,490
What did he practice
before turning to pediatrics?

806
01:18:09,259 --> 01:18:12,968
- Child psychia...
- ..psychiatry.

807
01:18:13,059 --> 01:18:16,449
And he was always...
a slow reader.

808
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:22,215
But these...used to be rimless.

809
01:18:22,299 --> 01:18:27,692
And the rest of me...
used to be black.

810
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:41,733
You know why we chose to look
different? Me, the children?

811
01:18:41,819 --> 01:18:44,652
Package doesn't count?
One's as good as...

812
01:18:44,739 --> 01:18:47,572
No. The old roles of authority.

813
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:50,048
Who's the teacher,
who's the father...

814
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:55,452
gets in the way of who
we really are...to each other.

815
01:18:55,539 --> 01:19:00,374
I've waited for years for
a chance to watch out for you.

816
01:19:00,459 --> 01:19:03,974
And I'm watching
out for you now.

817
01:19:04,059 --> 01:19:06,527
But this isn't like
the rest of hell.

818
01:19:06,619 --> 01:19:10,612
You've got no defence
against Annie.

819
01:19:10,699 --> 01:19:14,977
If losing yourself or
being swallowed by hell itself

820
01:19:15,059 --> 01:19:19,416
could save her,
I'd be there cheering you on.

821
01:19:20,779 --> 01:19:23,771
You've got
your children back now.

822
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:25,690
They need you.

823
01:19:25,779 --> 01:19:30,569
Three minutes... Any more,
you could lose your mind.

824
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:32,934
[Chris]
How can you lose your mind?

825
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:35,089
[Tracker]
Once her reality becomes yours,

826
01:19:35,179 --> 01:19:38,694
there's really no way back.

827
01:19:54,109 --> 01:19:56,065
[Ian] 'Think about Mom.'

828
01:19:57,669 --> 01:20:00,547
'What you said
to bring her back.'

829
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:15,619
Hello?
Your door's open. [Echoes]

830
01:20:48,909 --> 01:20:52,379
Sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

831
01:20:54,669 --> 01:20:59,379
- Who...who are you?
- I'm your neighbour.

832
01:20:59,469 --> 01:21:02,666
I bought the Gorman's place
two months ago.

833
01:21:02,749 --> 01:21:04,626
I just moved in.

834
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:08,145
I never heard
they sold their place.

835
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:12,541
You're Annie Nielsen, right?

836
01:21:12,629 --> 01:21:15,143
They told me a lot about you.

837
01:21:15,229 --> 01:21:17,424
Like what? What did they say?

838
01:21:17,509 --> 01:21:20,467
That you're
a very talented artist and...

839
01:21:20,549 --> 01:21:23,507
work for a museum, right? And...

840
01:21:23,589 --> 01:21:25,227
you're a widow.

841
01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:28,624
Mrs Gorman admires your roses...

842
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:32,224
very much.

843
01:21:32,309 --> 01:21:35,301
They were so handsome.

844
01:21:36,909 --> 01:21:40,299
But now there's no water
pressure in the neighbourhood.

845
01:21:40,389 --> 01:21:46,021
There's no electricity
and no gas.

846
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:49,226
There are other things
missing, too.

847
01:21:49,309 --> 01:21:52,699
Like clean clothes
and books I want to read.

848
01:21:52,789 --> 01:21:54,108
And, um...

849
01:21:54,189 --> 01:21:58,899
some of my favourite
paintings I have to work on.

850
01:22:02,029 --> 01:22:03,587
Aahh!

851
01:22:04,869 --> 01:22:08,384
- What is it?
- They're everywhere now!

852
01:22:10,189 --> 01:22:12,145
I got it!

853
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:15,787
It's gone.

854
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:23,628
Thank you.

855
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,946
You're welcome.

856
01:22:28,029 --> 01:22:30,304
You say your paintings
are missing.

857
01:22:30,389 --> 01:22:33,904
Some of my most precious panels.

858
01:22:33,989 --> 01:22:35,866
The ones that remind me.

859
01:22:43,429 --> 01:22:46,546
Remind me of my husband
and my children.

860
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:50,542
That's why I never leave.

861
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:53,507
Because they might return?

862
01:22:55,989 --> 01:22:58,708
I hope that's true
with all my heart.

863
01:22:58,789 --> 01:23:01,223
It's not, you know.

864
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:05,825
When you're dead, you disappear.

865
01:23:07,709 --> 01:23:12,305
My wife committed suicide
after our children died.

866
01:23:12,389 --> 01:23:14,425
After l...

867
01:23:14,509 --> 01:23:18,422
She was the loveliest person.

868
01:23:18,509 --> 01:23:20,386
Don't you think that's sad?

869
01:23:20,469 --> 01:23:23,620
- Don't you have to leave?
- No.

870
01:23:23,709 --> 01:23:27,907
- But if you want me to go...
- I do.

871
01:23:27,989 --> 01:23:31,823
The last day I saw my wife
it was our anniversary.

872
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:34,139
- Aren't you leaving?
- In a minute.

873
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:37,983
I was sticking around in case
there was another problem.

874
01:23:38,069 --> 01:23:40,219
It wasn't a wedding anniversary.

875
01:23:40,309 --> 01:23:43,824
It was a very
special kind of day...

876
01:23:45,389 --> 01:23:48,904
..no one else knows about.

877
01:23:57,909 --> 01:23:59,945
[Annie humming]

878
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:05,463
[Chris] I need to talk to you.

879
01:24:05,549 --> 01:24:08,382
And you don't have to respond.

880
01:24:14,909 --> 01:24:19,346
This is a one-way ticket...
for me.

881
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:24,101
My hanging around here
is not helping you.

882
01:24:24,189 --> 01:24:26,305
And it's killing me.

883
01:24:26,389 --> 01:24:29,301
Today is kind of a D-Day.

884
01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:33,939
"D" for decision, I guess.

885
01:24:36,549 --> 01:24:38,699
About divorce.

886
01:24:39,989 --> 01:24:42,378
That'd be two D's,
wouldn't it?

887
01:24:47,789 --> 01:24:50,098
I stand corrected.

888
01:24:55,069 --> 01:24:59,142
Look what happens when you
don't say anything for a month.

889
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:02,700
Cindy called.

890
01:25:02,789 --> 01:25:05,257
She said
everything is waiting for you.

891
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:12,343
The artists and curators will
see you when you're better.

892
01:25:12,429 --> 01:25:15,307
And I told her...

893
01:25:15,389 --> 01:25:20,258
it was the museum
and one of those meetings

894
01:25:20,349 --> 01:25:23,147
that kept you
from driving that day.

895
01:25:25,949 --> 01:25:29,988
And if you went back,
it'd mean you weren't sorry,

896
01:25:30,069 --> 01:25:34,620
you weren't wrong and you'd
be betraying your children.

897
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:38,258
She called you crazy
and I called her a bitch!

898
01:25:38,349 --> 01:25:42,467
And I hung up!
That didn't go very well!

899
01:25:46,629 --> 01:25:49,701
What's true in our minds
is true.

900
01:25:49,789 --> 01:25:53,020
Whether some people
know it or not.

901
01:25:54,509 --> 01:25:58,582
That's when I realised
I'm part of the problem.

902
01:25:58,669 --> 01:26:02,298
Not because I remind you.

903
01:26:02,389 --> 01:26:05,699
But because I couldn't join you.

904
01:26:05,789 --> 01:26:09,225
So I left you alone.

905
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:16,740
Don't give up, OK?

906
01:26:29,349 --> 01:26:30,828
OK.

907
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:33,946
OK.

908
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:36,906
It's OK.

909
01:26:53,629 --> 01:26:55,426
[Annie] So you reconciled.

910
01:26:58,229 --> 01:27:00,618
That's very romantic.

911
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:03,979
She still killed herself.

912
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:08,901
- She gave up.
- There's nothing wrong with it.

913
01:27:08,989 --> 01:27:11,457
- Her husband thought so.
- He was a coward!

914
01:27:11,549 --> 01:27:15,178
Being strong, not giving up...

915
01:27:15,269 --> 01:27:17,737
that was his place to hide.

916
01:27:17,829 --> 01:27:20,707
He pushed away the pain so hard,

917
01:27:20,789 --> 01:27:24,907
he disconnected himself from
the person he loved the most.

918
01:27:27,149 --> 01:27:30,983
Sometimes,
when you win, you lose.

919
01:27:37,869 --> 01:27:39,939
When he saw
his children again...

920
01:27:40,029 --> 01:27:42,338
I thought
your children were dead.

921
01:27:43,789 --> 01:27:46,906
You can see the dead.
In your dreams.

922
01:27:46,989 --> 01:27:49,742
If you want to.

923
01:27:52,469 --> 01:27:55,302
I wanna see Christy.

924
01:27:56,749 --> 01:27:59,343
I can show you.
It's not hard.

925
01:27:59,429 --> 01:28:03,183
All you have to do...
it's like painting a picture.

926
01:28:03,269 --> 01:28:05,419
We do it together.

927
01:28:05,509 --> 01:28:09,582
Just close your eyes. (Please.)

928
01:28:09,669 --> 01:28:12,342
(Don't be afraid.)

929
01:28:14,549 --> 01:28:17,302
Remember where you were married?

930
01:28:23,389 --> 01:28:25,584
Christy!

931
01:28:25,669 --> 01:28:27,148
Christy...

932
01:28:28,549 --> 01:28:32,462
Who else would you
be marrying in your dreams?

933
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,743
[Annie] I missed you.

934
01:28:37,829 --> 01:28:39,626
Annie...

935
01:28:39,709 --> 01:28:42,348
This is real.

936
01:28:45,269 --> 01:28:47,385
The man in the garden.

937
01:28:50,869 --> 01:28:53,064
It's me.

938
01:28:55,829 --> 01:28:57,421
No!

939
01:28:57,509 --> 01:28:58,908
No!

940
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,341
Whoever you are,

941
01:29:02,429 --> 01:29:06,468
did you think
you could take him from me?

942
01:29:19,069 --> 01:29:21,185
I'm sorry, babe.

943
01:29:21,269 --> 01:29:23,829
There's some things
I have to say.

944
01:29:23,909 --> 01:29:27,379
I've only got
a few moments left.

945
01:29:29,029 --> 01:29:32,863
I'm sorry for all the things
I'll never give you.

946
01:29:32,949 --> 01:29:36,988
I'll never buy you another
meatball sub with extra sauce.

947
01:29:37,069 --> 01:29:40,266
And always the big one.

948
01:29:40,349 --> 01:29:42,863
I'll never make you smile.

949
01:29:45,229 --> 01:29:48,027
I just wanted us
to be old together.

950
01:29:48,109 --> 01:29:53,263
Two old farts laughing at each
other as our bodies fell apart.

951
01:29:53,349 --> 01:29:55,260
Together at the end.

952
01:29:55,349 --> 01:29:58,466
By that lake in your painting.

953
01:29:58,549 --> 01:30:01,507
That was our heaven, see?

954
01:30:01,589 --> 01:30:04,149
There's lots of things to miss.

955
01:30:05,589 --> 01:30:08,706
Books...naps...

956
01:30:08,789 --> 01:30:12,543
kisses...and fights.

957
01:30:12,629 --> 01:30:16,304
Oh, God, we had
some great ones!

958
01:30:16,389 --> 01:30:18,949
(Thank you for those.)

959
01:30:20,469 --> 01:30:23,188
Thank you for every kindness.

960
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:27,098
Thank you for our children.

961
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:29,828
For the first time I saw them.

962
01:30:31,469 --> 01:30:36,145
Thank you for being someone
I was always proud to be with.

963
01:30:37,909 --> 01:30:39,979
For your guts,

964
01:30:40,069 --> 01:30:41,468
for your sweetness.

965
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:43,779
For how you always looked,

966
01:30:43,869 --> 01:30:46,781
for how I always wanted
to touch you.

967
01:30:48,269 --> 01:30:51,227
God, you were my life.

968
01:30:53,069 --> 01:30:57,062
I apologise for every time
I failed you.

969
01:30:57,149 --> 01:30:59,788
Especially this one.

970
01:31:20,823 --> 01:31:25,260
- Didn't you think I'd make it?
- You were in there a while.

971
01:31:25,343 --> 01:31:29,131
Took me a while to realise
you were right.

972
01:31:29,223 --> 01:31:32,454
Nothing you can do
could help her.

973
01:31:32,543 --> 01:31:34,613
This trip was for you.

974
01:31:36,903 --> 01:31:39,815
- Did you come close...
- ..to losing it?

975
01:31:39,903 --> 01:31:41,859
Oh, yeah.

976
01:31:41,943 --> 01:31:45,060
Pushed it right to the edge.

977
01:31:45,143 --> 01:31:48,294
That's why
I had to come out now.

978
01:31:48,383 --> 01:31:50,578
I'm giving up.

979
01:31:53,023 --> 01:31:54,934
Not the way you think.

980
01:31:59,023 --> 01:32:00,536
Go home, Al.

981
01:32:01,823 --> 01:32:05,179
Will you tell my children
I love them?

982
01:32:06,343 --> 01:32:08,777
And I won't leave their mother.

983
01:32:12,983 --> 01:32:14,894
(Thanks.)

984
01:32:21,023 --> 01:32:22,695
Where are we headed?

985
01:32:24,983 --> 01:32:30,455
In one minute I won't know you
any better than you'll know me.

986
01:32:30,543 --> 01:32:34,092
But we'll be together.

987
01:32:34,183 --> 01:32:36,299
Where we belong.

988
01:32:38,103 --> 01:32:42,494
Good people go to hell because
they can't forgive themselves.

989
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,653
I know I can't.

990
01:32:44,743 --> 01:32:47,541
But I can forgive you.

991
01:32:47,623 --> 01:32:50,820
For killing my children?

992
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:54,577
And my sweet husband?

993
01:32:54,663 --> 01:32:56,972
(No.)

994
01:32:57,063 --> 01:33:01,102
For being so wonderful, a guy
would choose hell over heaven,

995
01:33:01,183 --> 01:33:03,697
just to hang around you.

996
01:33:08,143 --> 01:33:10,896
Not because I remind you...

997
01:33:10,983 --> 01:33:13,941
but because I couldn't join you.

998
01:33:14,023 --> 01:33:17,413
Sorry I left you alone.

999
01:33:19,183 --> 01:33:22,095
Don't give up, OK?

1000
01:33:39,983 --> 01:33:42,451
Christy?

1001
01:33:46,903 --> 01:33:49,212
Christy.

1002
01:33:52,423 --> 01:33:54,334
What happened to this place?

1003
01:33:57,823 --> 01:34:00,735
It's cold.

1004
01:34:12,623 --> 01:34:14,500
Christy?

1005
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:17,541
God, no! No, no, no, no!

1006
01:34:17,623 --> 01:34:20,091
Don't give up!
Don't give up! Christy!

1007
01:34:20,183 --> 01:34:23,380
Don't give up!
Don't, don't give up!

1008
01:34:23,463 --> 01:34:25,215
Christy!

1009
01:34:28,383 --> 01:34:30,817
[Fading] Stay with me,
don't give up...

1010
01:34:51,223 --> 01:34:52,053
[Annie] Christy!

1011
01:35:28,221 --> 01:35:29,700
Hey!

1012
01:35:31,821 --> 01:35:33,891
Remember me?

1013
01:35:43,621 --> 01:35:46,579
Sometimes, when you lose...

1014
01:35:46,661 --> 01:35:48,174
you win.

1015
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:42,692
How did we get here?

1016
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:49,930
Travel here
is like everything else.

1017
01:36:50,021 --> 01:36:52,296
It's in your mind.

1018
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:56,374
You only have to
close your eyes.

1019
01:36:56,461 --> 01:36:59,931
If you know
where you're going...

1020
01:37:00,021 --> 01:37:03,297
Looks like we did.

1021
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:06,612
Where you were...

1022
01:37:08,301 --> 01:37:11,179
I tried everything.
Nothing worked.

1023
01:37:12,941 --> 01:37:14,932
Until...

1024
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:17,615
you tried trailing me.

1025
01:37:22,181 --> 01:37:25,935
What some folks
call impossible...

1026
01:37:26,021 --> 01:37:29,377
is what
they haven't seen before.

1027
01:38:08,621 --> 01:38:10,054
Excuse me, lady.

1028
01:38:12,981 --> 01:38:15,290
Ready for that surprise
I promised?

1029
01:38:15,381 --> 01:38:16,860
Yeah.

1030
01:38:21,701 --> 01:38:23,259
That's not the surprise!

1031
01:38:23,341 --> 01:38:24,820
Mommy?

1032
01:39:11,781 --> 01:39:14,341
[Annie] I want us
to grow old together.

1033
01:39:14,421 --> 01:39:15,934
Can we do that here?

1034
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:17,295
Mm-hm.

1035
01:39:17,381 --> 01:39:21,613
I want it all.
As long as it's with you.

1036
01:39:21,701 --> 01:39:24,261
It will be.

1037
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:30,653
But what about going back?

1038
01:39:30,741 --> 01:39:33,096
Being reborn?

1039
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:37,060
That's the one thing
we can't have here.

1040
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:40,451
Finding each other
all over again.

1041
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:42,054
Falling in love.

1042
01:39:44,501 --> 01:39:47,299
Make different choices.

1043
01:39:50,781 --> 01:39:54,171
- Try again.
- Yeah.

1044
01:39:54,261 --> 01:39:56,297
Avoid sharp objects.

1045
01:39:58,821 --> 01:40:01,540
Don't worry about the kids.
They'll be here.

1046
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:05,011
They want us to go.

1047
01:40:05,101 --> 01:40:08,138
A human life
is just a heartbeat here.

1048
01:40:08,221 --> 01:40:11,657
And we'll all be together.
Forever.

1049
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:16,972
How will I find you?

1050
01:40:17,061 --> 01:40:20,770
I found you in hell.
I'll find you in Jersey.

1051
01:41:21,621 --> 01:41:25,455
'When I was young... I met this
beautiful girl by a lake.'

1052
01:41:28,135 --> 01:41:28,335
# We follow the river

1053
01:41:28,335 --> 01:41:30,690
# We follow the river

1054
01:41:31,295 --> 01:41:33,968
# Down into the stream

1055
01:41:34,695 --> 01:41:39,405
# That's where my dream began

1056
01:41:40,975 --> 01:41:44,047
# I left my worries

1057
01:41:44,135 --> 01:41:46,888
# To the people who stare

1058
01:41:47,335 --> 01:41:52,568
# And dreamed without a care

1059
01:41:53,415 --> 01:41:59,331
# That I'd always be beside you

1060
01:42:00,175 --> 01:42:05,090
# To watch the day and night

1061
01:42:06,055 --> 01:42:12,210
# And we'll listen
to the sunrise

1062
01:42:12,895 --> 01:42:18,049
# And feel its glowing light

1063
01:42:19,415 --> 01:42:24,330
# And peace will come inside

1064
01:42:25,535 --> 01:42:31,451
# So quiet

1065
01:42:45,135 --> 01:42:47,774
# Wherever we're going

1066
01:42:48,575 --> 01:42:50,884
# I don't know

1067
01:42:51,335 --> 01:42:57,285
# For a million years
our love keeps growin'

1068
01:42:57,815 --> 01:43:00,887
# The mystery deepens

1069
01:43:01,495 --> 01:43:03,963
# Day by day

1070
01:43:04,135 --> 01:43:10,051
# But trust my love
and hear me say

1071
01:43:10,135 --> 01:43:15,573
# That I'll always be beside you

1072
01:43:16,895 --> 01:43:21,730
# To watch the day and night

1073
01:43:23,015 --> 01:43:29,284
# And we'll listen
to the sunrise

1074
01:43:29,935 --> 01:43:34,850
# And feel it's glowing light

1075
01:43:36,055 --> 01:43:41,129
# And peace will come inside

1076
01:43:42,215 --> 01:43:47,164
# So quiet

1077
01:44:14,495 --> 01:44:19,011
# Peace will come inside

1078
01:44:20,375 --> 01:44:25,210
# So quiet

1079
01:44:26,495 --> 01:44:31,967
