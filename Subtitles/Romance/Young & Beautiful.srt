00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:33,284
- What is it?
- Felix is looking for you.

2
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:36,397
- Did you see him?
- Yes, he came by the house.

3
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:39,625
- Did mum see him ?
- Yes, of course.

4
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:43,522
- Did she say something?
- That he was very handsome.

5
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:52,831
- Will you promise me not to tell mum?
- Yes.

6
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:55,701
- Why do you not want to say something?
- She has nothing to do with it. It is my life.

7
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:58,149
Sure if you say so,
I am not saying anything.

8
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,306
I do not want her to ask me questions:
What do you do, how did you meet? ...

9
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:03,925
Where does he come from?
- Are you in love?

10
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,792
Tell me, Isabelle!
Are you in love?

11
00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:09,466
- And how about you?
- I do not know. I am a guy.

12
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,175
YOUNG & PRETTY

13
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:25,290
Come on, let us clear the table.
Guys, can you help us, too?

14
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:28,184
- Let's go swimming!

15
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:31,002
- You have to tidy first,
we go for a swim later.

16
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:34,081
- Mum, can we go to the beach?
- Not now. You have to digest before.

17
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:37,200
- Please, Mum .
- You are going at four, after the nap.

18
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,987
- We do not do siesta,
we are not kids.

19
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:43,146
- I am no child,
but just take siesta!

20
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:45,625
Let me!
Let me go!

21
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,683
- Your German friend came.

22
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,759
- He seems nice. He is called Felix, right?
- Yes.

23
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,052
- You should invite him to dinner.

24
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:07,369
- No. It is too silly .

25
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,414
- Did you saw him?
- Yes, there he is.

26
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:55,417
- Where?
- There, he is playing tennis on the beach.

27
00:04:56,474 --> 00:04:58,063
Right there

There he comes.

31
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,976
Turn around or you will not see him!

- Are you fine?
- Yes, very fine, and you?

36
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:43,346
- I think, very well. With beach,
sun ... everything is perfect!

37
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:48,272
Tonight we go to a disco ...

44
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,785
- Is it alright? Do you like it?

00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:33,023
- Do you think?
- Clear. Look at me!

46
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:38,592
- Gentle!

47
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:41,748
- That is better.

48
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:46,900
- I am going. Are you going
to our parents now, so I can leave?

49
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:49,511

- Is it good?
- Coming from a German, yes.

56
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:15,021
- Put on your pyjamas and go to bed.
- Okay.

57
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:18,228
- In any case, I have been to the
beach the whole day ...

58
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:21,384
... with Milan, who I introduced to you ...

59
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:24,512

- the city is not far - ..."

171
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:41,776
"brings aromas of vine
and beer."

172
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:45,200
"Night of June: 17.
You let yourself be intoxicated."

173
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:48,394
" The sap is champagne
that goes to your head, ramble."

174
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:52,255
"You feel a kiss on your lips;
throbbing like an animal."

175
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:54,902
"Your crazy heart, Robinsonea
through novels ..."

176
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:57,430
"when clarity
a pale lantern ..."

177
00:21:57,464 --> 00:21:59,657
"spends a Miss
lovely look."

178
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:03,312
"To her, you seem very naive,
and trotting with his small boots ..."

179
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:05,775
"turns, alert ,
and a living movement ..."

180
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:07,896
"on your lips,
poems then die."

181
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:09,878
"You arere in love,
laughs at your verses."

182
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:12,485
"All their friends are ,
you are unbearable."

183
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:14,238
"And one night , your love
deigned to write."

184
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:17,299
"That night,
coffee again dazzled."

185
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:21,951
"You order beer or lemonade.
At seventeen you can not be formal ..."

186
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,778
"when there is lime green
on the road."

187
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:30,358
- You can see that Rimbaud speaks
drunkenness of nature.

188
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:33,334
- And the excesses that lead to love.

189
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:36,418
- Because being young,
Love goes through excesses, disinhibition ...

190
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:39,553
- At 17, one can fall in love
only during the holidays ...

191
00:22:39,554 --> 00:22:44,491
- live a story, and to return to high school
have much to tell ...

192
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:47,616
- because we fell in love
and that summer was cute.

193
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:51,992
Falling in love, is revealed as a man.
Spend youth to be an adult.

194
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:56,770
It is the intoxication of summer
insouciance, freedom ...

195
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:58,697
- happiness, joy.

196
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,028
In the third stanza,
"Robinsonea" is a neologism?

197
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:04,752
Is he referring to Robinson Crusoe?

198
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:08,022
- We're adventurous two months
and finally we are alone.

199
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:14,695
- Begins and ends the same.
Life is like a circle, something infinite ...

200
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:16,152
repeating,
whatever happens.

201
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:19,654
- Not necessarily a poem
about the meeting ...

202
00:23:20,178 --> 00:23:26,766
It's more like a diagnosis,
on the dreams of young love.

203
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:31,218
<i> Okay, tomorrow 5 pm, 300 Euros.
Which address?</i>

204
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:33,429
- Isabelle, are you coming to lunch?
- I am coming.

205
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,873
- You write to your boyfriend?
- How do you know?

206
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,228
- Easy to note.
You are radiant.

207
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:40,750
- Is he not in high school?
- No, you are crazy.

208
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:42,588
- How old is he?
- 32 years old.

209
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,735
- I understand,
just assholes around here.

210
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:48,455
- What does he do?
- He works as a lawyer.

211
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:52,121
- Do you remember the old guy
we talked to in front of high school?

212
00:23:52,424 --> 00:23:53,982
- Yes.

213
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:57,258
- It happened again to a friend of my sister.
But she did go through then.

214
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,423
- Oh, really?
- Just to buy a Prada bag, can you imagine that?

215
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:09,452
- Why is Isabelle always
in that bad mood?

216
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:15,560
- Too bad you did not keep the
old guy's number.

217
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:19,622
- Are you serious?
- No, I am just kidding.

218
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:22,242
And also I do not like Prada handbags.

219
00:24:34,614 --> 00:24:35,900
- I am leaving.

220
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:39,594
- What time are you coming back?
- During evening, I am going to see Claire.

221
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:41,105
We are working
on a presentation.

222
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:44,811
- Did you take my grey silk blouse?
- No.

223
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:47,956
- Are you sure?
- Of course, do not bother me, I said no.

224
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:51,003
- Hey, mind your tone!

225
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:55,333
Have a nice day
and you work well!

226
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:59,822
- Did you get how she speaks?

227
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,861
- Excuse me.

228
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:55,495
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

229
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:57,056
- Have a seat!

230
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:03,409
- What is your name?
- Lea.

231
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:07,449
- Very good choice.

232
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:12,689
- How old are you?
- 20 years.

233
00:26:15,894 --> 00:26:19,345
- And you are studying?
- 2nd year humanities.

234
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:21,858
- Where?
- In La Sorbonne.

235
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:55,302
- Do you feel good?
- Yes, I am fine.

236
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:03,932
- Do it to you yourself!

237
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,882
In a natural way.

238
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:22,434
Do not look at me!

239
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:27,712
Turn around and
show me your ass!

240
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:39,141
On your knees.

241
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:53,410
Here.

242
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:01,732
- Can I shower?
- No.

243
00:28:15,697 --> 00:28:17,797
- What is it?
- My money.

244
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:19,584
I am coming.

245
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,783
It should be 300 Euros.

246
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,375
- Sorry, no proof.
- We said 300.

247
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,436
- Come on, get out!
Or I will tell your parents you are a whore.

248
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:18,250
<i>Okay, now, 500 Euros.</i>

249
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:31,849
I want my money up-front.

250
00:29:33,851 --> 00:29:36,684
Okay, but for 500 you suck me
without a condom.

251
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:39,581
- I do not know.
- Do not worry, I am married!

252
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:22,602
- Do you work only this?
- No, I do something different sometimes .

253
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,928
- You know the saying?
- No.

254
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:28,655
"A whore today,
a whore forever."

255
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:14,183
- Did you know, that Isabelle is here?
- No, I have not heard her.

256
00:31:14,184 --> 00:31:18,655
- And she is taking a shower at this time.
- It is a woman thing.

257
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,643
Are you working?
- Yes, I have a paper to finish.

258
00:31:29,644 --> 00:31:32,143
- You know you can work all day on Sunday.
- Do not worry, I will do this.

259
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:40,018
- Do you not forget the theater tonight?
- Why do you not ask Victor?

260
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:43,819
- Because he stays at his friend
Patrick and we would like you to come with us.

261
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:46,546
- So I am stuck in.

262
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:49,378
- You have to take a breath.

263
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:53,111
- I, at your age ...
- I know, going to parties, cheesier ...

264
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,070
- Hurry up! It will not be long
until we go to the restaurant.

265
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:32,582
- How are you?
- How long have you been waiting?

266
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:36,397
- We have to go now, it will start soon.
- We are ...

267
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,088
- In the gallery.
- We are there. See you later.

268
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,047
- See you in the break.
- See you.

269
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,152
- Where are they?

270
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:13,495
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,
please return to your seats!</i>

271
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,982
- Did you see your mother?
- No.

272
00:34:21,044 --> 00:34:22,354
- It will start now.

273
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,813
- Excuse me,
excuse me.

274
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:44,907
<i>See you on Wednesday.
Same time. Room 6095. G.</i>

275
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:17,628
- Do you like the theater?
- Not much.

276
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:23,342
- Did you come with your parents?
- Yeah, well, he is my stepfather.

277
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:27,149
- Your mother is a beautiful woman.

278
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:32,171
- Do they not suspect something?
- No.

279
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:34,501
- Better not.

280
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:39,273
You would not lie about your age,
right?

281
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:47,171
- You are an adult, at least?
- Of course, I turned 18 this summer.

282
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:01,760
Thank you.

283
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:07,791
- Do ou see many more?

284
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:13,259
<i>Like you,
I have a heart ...</i>

285
00:37:14,254 --> 00:37:16,777
<i> can not promise anything ... </i>

286
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,204
<i> scared to love ... </i>

287
00:37:20,898 --> 00:37:23,518
<i> but maybe loves you. </i>

288
00:37:24,282 --> 00:37:30,886
<i> Why hide it? </i>

289
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:37,891
<i> Why avoid it? </i>

290
00:37:38,987 --> 00:37:42,804
<i> I have nothing to give you ... </i>

291
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,631
<i> what my eyes see . </i>

292
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,735
<i> not want to suffer ... </i>

293
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:54,014
<i> but who never suffers? </i>

294
00:37:54,875 --> 00:38:00,164
<i> Why avoid it? </i>

295
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:07,558
<i> Why leave? </i>

296
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:16,396
<i> By staying in your ivory tower ... </i>

297
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:22,354
<i> seeing everything pink
or all black . </i>

298
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:28,639
<i> Solo.
Solo. </i>

299
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:33,706
<i> not be very unhappy ... </i>

300
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:39,127
<i> one forgets that it is not very happy. </i>

301
00:38:39,996 --> 00:38:44,320
<i> Solo.
Solo. </i>

302
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,766
- Is there anyone home?

303
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,268
- Mum told me you had a girlfriend.
- Nothing to tell.

304
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:29,132
- You can tell your older sister.
- And you, did you write your German guy?

305
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,125
- No.
- Do you not want to see him again?

306
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:36,139
- What for? He does not live here.
And Felix was nothing.

307
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:39,421
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- Yes, it was nice.

308
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,437
- Nice is not enough.

309
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:46,803
So, how is your love ...
or your lover?

310
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:49,765
- Nothing for you.
- I said, I am like you, I did not fall in love.

311
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:51,801
- What do you know?

312
00:39:56,025 --> 00:40:00,364
Do you masturbate now?
- Now, stop! You are a sexual freak.

313
00:40:00,872 --> 00:40:02,413
- Do you stumble?
- Shut up!

314
00:40:02,414 --> 00:40:04,923
- Do you not watch stuff on the internet?
- I amm going to watch TV.

315
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:28,190
- Wait!

316
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:31,388
- Do you not want to?

317
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:49,839
Are you married?
- Yes.

318
00:40:50,597 --> 00:40:52,451
- Was it that woman in the theater?

319
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,943
- No. She was my daughter.

320
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:04,170
I was never a good father.
Did not care that much.

321
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:09,376
She was resentful for long time, but then ...
now, we are better.

322
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:12,981
Approached towards each other.
We go to the theater or to the movies together.

323
00:41:12,982 --> 00:41:14,663
And she likes me, too.

324
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:17,293
- And as a husband?

325
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:21,977
- I'm trying.

326
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:25,931
And you?
- What?

327
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:29,189
- Your father?
- There is nothing to say. It is my father.

328
00:41:36,445 --> 00:41:38,772
- You can undress now.

329
00:42:14,294 --> 00:42:15,938
- Georges?

330
00:42:16,983 --> 00:42:19,077
Georges?

331
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:21,682
Georges?!

332
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:32,879
Georges?

333
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:49,162
Georges!

334
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,508
What the fuck?!

335
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:05,259
- How did you do this?
- I told you: I fell after showering.

336
00:44:06,437 --> 00:44:09,634
- I went through this obsession ...
showering all the time.

337
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,700
I will put a patch
and have a small scab.

338
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:19,047
- Will it last long?
- For the time to heal.

339
00:44:19,932 --> 00:44:22,299
There it is.
A cute patch.

340
00:44:22,888 --> 00:44:25,797
I remember your childhood
always coming back angry from the bloody school.

341
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:29,566
Like a maniac.

342
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:44,843
- Winter -

343
00:44:49,448 --> 00:44:51,285
- Excuse me, good morning.
- Good morning.

344
00:44:51,286 --> 00:44:53,681
- Can wee talk to Mrs. Bontal, please?
- Do you have an appointment?

345
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:54,777
- No, we are with the police.

346
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:59,194
- My daughter, Isabelle?
- Isabelle ... or "Lea".

347
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:05,551
- Lea? That is the name of my mother,
I do not know what you are talking about.

348
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:09,229
- This is your daughter, right?

349
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,603
No?
- Yes, I think.

350
00:45:17,604 --> 00:45:20,747
- Georges Ferrière often met
your daughter, "Lea".

351
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:24,267
- Your daughter has a double life.
As a prostitute.

352
00:45:25,644 --> 00:45:28,711
- She is 17, you must be wrong.
- No. It is her, no doubt.

353
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:32,561
- About your daughter ... she is
as a witness not in danger.

354
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:34,888
And the law consider her to be
a victim of this man.

355
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,134
However, there is an investigation
ongoing, whether these acts ...

356
00:45:39,135 --> 00:45:41,802
happened on own will or are
linked to a network of pimps.

357
00:45:49,117 --> 00:45:54,026
Today with the internet any child
can access porn sites.

358
00:45:54,027 --> 00:45:56,366
You have no idea, unless you install
parental control.

359
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:59,214
- Did you never checke her messages
on her mobile phone?

360
00:45:59,836 --> 00:46:00,748
- No.

361
00:46:00,749 --> 00:46:02,931
- Ms. Bontal, do you know about this?

362
00:46:15,094 --> 00:46:17,775
- Did you know?
- No.

363
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,743
- Are you going to the party at Benoit?
- I do not know yet.

364
00:46:31,968 --> 00:46:34,535
- Her parents left the department
for the entire weekend.

365
00:46:35,121 --> 00:46:37,748
- I do not know.
- Etienne is supposed to be there.

366
00:46:38,308 --> 00:46:40,436
I think it is an opportunity ...
sometime happens to one, do you not think ?

367
00:46:40,437 --> 00:46:41,210
- Yes.

368
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:44,337
- You can go come your boyfriend, if you want to.
- No, we are done.

369
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:49,802
- Sorry, are you sad?
- No, it is better that way. There was this big age difference.

370
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,840
- Are you leaving, Muna?
- Yes, your mother came.

371
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:56,875
- What is it?
- It is not my business.

372
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:01,620
- What is wrong?
- I do not know.

373
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,280
See you tomorrow.

374
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,320
You have returned so soon?
- Go to your room, I have to talk to your sister!

375
00:47:18,981 --> 00:47:20,245
Come here, please!

376
00:47:30,962 --> 00:47:34,521
I know everything.
About Lea.

377
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:37,468
Stay here!

378
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,093
The police came.
Why did you not say anything?

379
00:47:43,845 --> 00:47:45,996
- Say what?
- Say what?!

380
00:47:46,486 --> 00:47:48,786
What you are doing?
A whore?

381
00:47:49,321 --> 00:47:51,574
You are a whore?
Is that funny to you?

382
00:47:54,128 --> 00:47:57,701
And the death of this man,
do you see?

383
00:47:57,702 --> 00:48:01,346
Do you see?
You are disgusting!

384
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:04,754
Do you realise how bad this?
Do you see?

385
00:48:05,828 --> 00:48:08,635
Do you not think?
What is on your mind?!

386
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:11,494
What is it with you?
Why did you do that?

387
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,005
All that ...

388
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,661
Isabelle, please.

389
00:48:34,175 --> 00:48:39,397
Isabelle, I am sorry.

390
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:42,671
Forgive.

391
00:48:45,577 --> 00:48:46,773
What happened?

392
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:06,450
Why?

393
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:15,461
Did you use condoms, at least?
- Yes.

394
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:23,839
- Promise me, you left it!
- Of course.

395
00:49:31,279 --> 00:49:33,374
- Can you bring the potatoes,
please, Victor?

396
00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:35,434
Everyone to the table!

397
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,050
- I have good news.
- What?

398
00:49:45,558 --> 00:49:48,231
- For rentals.
- Did it work?

399
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,866
- Yes, the cottage is available
the second week of February.

400
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:53,742
- Are we going skiing?
- Yes, you can improve your level.

401
00:49:53,743 --> 00:49:56,880
- Sure, I 'm better than you.
- We will see.

402
00:49:58,518 --> 00:50:00,287
- Will you come with us, Isabelle?

403
00:50:02,305 --> 00:50:04,927
- Of course. Why do you ask?

404
00:50:13,626 --> 00:50:18,175
- What did I do wrong?
- Stop accusing yourself!

405
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:21,123
- But why?
- It does not help you.

406
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:24,111
- I do not understand that I have not seen anything.

407
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,926
- It is that your daughter is so pretty.

408
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,137
- What do you mean?
- It is normal for this such "requests".

409
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,171
- Are you kidding?
- What?

410
00:50:38,172 --> 00:50:40,221
- Does it seem normal to be a whore
because someone is pretty?

411
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,578
- It was not what I said.
- Do not be silly then!

412
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:48,560
- What did she say exactly?

413
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,423
- Nothing. It explains nothing.

414
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:56,660
The police told me, I needed time
to understand what she had done.

415
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,846
- At least with the death of this man,
it is over.

416
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:04,937
- What if he had not died?

417
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,319
She would have continued.
Do you understand?

418
00:51:09,956 --> 00:51:13,052
- I think she needs more authority.
Maybe you should send her to her father.

419
00:51:13,053 --> 00:51:15,191
- Not with this father.
We have enough problems.

420
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:19,590
- Okay, listen, tomorrow the police wants
to hear your statement ...

421
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:22,723
and you have to go see a psychologist and
then you will decide what to do with her.

422
00:51:22,724 --> 00:51:24,219
No use in dramatising.

423
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,159
-Do you think I am dramatising now?

424
00:51:26,696 --> 00:51:29,184
Do you realise, what she has done?
- Yes, of course.

425
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,702
We must be firm,
watch her and punish her.

426
00:51:32,461 --> 00:51:34,437
No more computer, mobile phone,
no going out.

427
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:36,278
And your son,
does he understand?

428
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:41,131
- I imagine. He was there when the police came
and heard me speaking to Muna.

429
00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:43,603
I will talk to him tomorrow .

430
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:46,158
- Very well.

431
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:52,001
- Really, do you think I am
about that now?

432
00:51:52,682 --> 00:51:54,507
- What is it? I thought, you just need a hug.

433
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,574
- I am sorry.

434
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:04,795
- A man followed me in front of high school
and offered me money.

435
00:52:05,173 --> 00:52:06,950
- Did you take it?
- No.

436
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:12,026
I said, I would think about that and he left me
his number, in case I am changing my mind.

437
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:14,518
- 06 23 21 46 37.

438
00:52:18,565 --> 00:52:20,935
- After how long did you call?

439
00:52:21,367 --> 00:52:23,400
- A week later.

440
00:52:23,918 --> 00:52:25,277
- Where did you meet together?

441
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:29,164
- At the Intercontinental Hotel,
near the Opera.

442
00:52:30,764 --> 00:52:32,157
- Did you like it?

443
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:35,796
- Not right away.

444
00:52:37,498 --> 00:52:40,658
At first I was disgusted, but
then I wanted to do it again.

445
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,718
- Why did you do it again?

446
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:47,278
- I saw a documentary on TV
about students who need money.

447
00:52:51,633 --> 00:52:54,523
I bought another phone
and so it began.

448
00:52:57,837 --> 00:53:00,377
- Do you intend to follow that again?
- I do not know.

449
00:53:01,764 --> 00:53:05,015
It was just an experience.
- An experience that can be very dangerous .

450
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:07,872
You never know who you will be with.
There is no one to take care of or defend you.

451
00:53:08,374 --> 00:53:10,117
Being a minor,
you are an easy prey.

452
00:53:10,597 --> 00:53:14,490
Most prostitutes are assaulted
or raped, left alone to murderers.

453
00:53:14,654 --> 00:53:17,955
It is easy money.,Soon you can
be in a vicious circle.

454
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:22,169
Talking about G. Ferrière.

455
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,082
Had you noticed anything in particular,
did you know he had heart problems?

456
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:28,197
- No. He was taking drugs.

457
00:53:28,484 --> 00:53:30,086
- What drugs?

458
00:53:30,637 --> 00:53:31,792
- I do not know. Viagra.

459
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:35,984
- Did you practice sadomasochistic games,
degenerated erotic games ...

460
00:53:35,985 --> 00:53:38,250
strangulation, wives,
violence ...?

461
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,451
- No, it was normal.

462
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:45,686
- Why did you run away without telling anyone?
- I ran. I did not know what to do.

463
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:51,605
- Seeing how he was dead,
how long after that did you leave?

464
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,969
- I do not know. I was in shock. He was dead.

465
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:56,917
- Are you sure he was dead?
- Yes.

466
00:53:58,404 --> 00:54:02,264
- Have you ever seen a dead man before?
- No, or yes, my grandfather, but it was different.

467
00:54:02,802 --> 00:54:07,194
- Did you take the money?
- Yes, what we agreed.

468
00:54:09,051 --> 00:54:12,082
- Does all the money stay with me?
- No, being a minor it goes to your mother.

469
00:54:15,644 --> 00:54:17,350
- Did you finish your yoghurt?
- Yes.

470
00:54:17,351 --> 00:54:19,717
- Go brush your teeth before bed!
- Okay.

471
00:54:22,648 --> 00:54:25,075
- I am going to let you alone.
- No, please stay, it is important.

472
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:34,395
I went to the hospital and ...

473
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,328
someone advised me very good.
- I am not sick .

474
00:54:37,863 --> 00:54:39,844
- I did not say that, but I think you need
to talk to someone.

475
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:40,796
- I do not want to talk.

476
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:43,584
- No alternatives, Isabelle.
With what happened, you have to follow a treatment ...

477
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:44,531
psychotherapy.

478
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:45,974
- I do not. You can not force me.

479
00:54:45,975 --> 00:54:46,957
- Listen to me!

480
00:54:47,399 --> 00:54:50,309
Either that or you will be sent to
a psychiatric hospital. Do you prefer that?

481
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:58,611
- It is for you, Isabelle.
It can not hurt you, why not trying?

482
00:55:00,517 --> 00:55:02,437
- And what about my money?

483
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,673
- I thought to give it to a charity.

484
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:11,046
Something for the reintegration of prostitutes
- Yes , that is fine.

485
00:55:11,828 --> 00:55:12,885
- Bastards.

486
00:55:28,597 --> 00:55:31,255
- For me , it was a surprise,
I did not understand and ...

487
00:55:31,717 --> 00:55:33,598
still do not understand.

488
00:55:34,215 --> 00:55:36,802
Isabelle always had what she wanted.

489
00:55:37,255 --> 00:55:40,886
I make my life very well,
providing good for the children.

490
00:55:41,315 --> 00:55:45,118
I give her money when she needs it
to buy whatever she wants to.

491
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,380
- Do you need money?
- No.

492
00:55:48,965 --> 00:55:51,615
- Why charge then?
- Did you want to know your price?

493
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:53,495
- No, that way it was simpler, clearer.

494
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:56,052
- How can you say this?
- Let me talk!

495
00:55:57,276 --> 00:56:01,113
- Were they older men?
- Exactly.

496
00:56:01,595 --> 00:56:03,080
- About the age of your father?

497
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,203
- Or yours.

498
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:11,486
- Can you tell me about him?
- There is nothing to say.

499
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,892
- What I can tell, we split up 7 years ago.

500
00:56:16,436 --> 00:56:19,252
He works hard and lives in Italy.
Hhe remarried four years ago ...

501
00:56:19,253 --> 00:56:20,582
and have got a son one year ago.

502
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:22,396
Isabelle and her brother ...
they see him during the holidays.

503
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:25,034
- Do you get along with him?
- Normal, it is my father.

504
00:56:25,505 --> 00:56:27,194
- Do you miss him?
- No.

505
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:30,994
- You know youh have the right to resent or be sad?

506
00:56:32,164 --> 00:56:36,484
Do you get a pension?
- Yes, everything is clear between us.

507
00:56:37,076 --> 00:56:41,091
- And you, Isabelle, does he give you money?
- Yes, for my birthday, Christmas.

508
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,155
- Enough?
- Yes.

509
00:56:43,156 --> 00:56:48,283
- How much?
- 500 Euros for Christmas and my birthday.

510
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:51,556
- This year, he forgot.
- No, he sent me a check.

511
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:53,401
- You did not tell me.

512
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,624
Well, Isabelle, can we now
define when we meet together?

513
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:01,799
Are you fine about coming here
once a week?

514
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,803
- How much?
- 70 Euros.

515
00:57:05,804 --> 00:57:09,374
- No more?
- It is my rate.

516
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:17,044
- Well, I can pay with the money I earned.

517
00:57:17,045 --> 00:57:19,365
- That does not sound like a good idea.

518
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:21,637
Well, I do not know. No?

519
00:57:25,194 --> 00:57:29,326
- Isabelle is right. it is her money, she earned it.

520
00:57:34,515 --> 00:57:36,201
- Hello Isabelle.
- Hello Peter.

521
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,396
Hi kids.
Hello Lucie.

522
00:57:44,598 --> 00:57:47,765
- And?
- Everything seems ok, as usual.

523
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,451
How are you liking it?

524
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,115
- ... the mosquito, pork ...
- Hello, Isabelle.

525
00:57:52,648 --> 00:57:56,600
- Hello Vero, are you okay?
- Still tired, she grows teeth, Sophie.

526
00:57:57,042 --> 00:57:59,955
- Do I give her the bottle if he wakes up?
- Yes, I left everything in the kitchen.

527
00:58:01,483 --> 00:58:02,766
- Bye, mum.
- Goodbye, my love.

528
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:03,823
Just warm ...

529
00:58:04,997 --> 00:58:07,259
but should not wake her
before we get there.

530
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,641
- Do you want to see my drawings?

531
00:58:08,642 --> 00:58:11,653
- Do not bother Isabelle too much
and within an hour, everyone to sleep!

532
00:58:12,195 --> 00:58:15,216
- If you want to eat something, help yourself with the fridge!
- Okay.

533
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,715
- Good luck. No going back now, anyway.

534
00:58:17,906 --> 00:58:19,034
-Thanks, have a good time.

535
00:59:21,568 --> 00:59:22,773
- Good night.

536
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,852
- Good night, I fell asleep .

537
00:59:26,323 --> 00:59:29,438
- Everything alright?
- Yes, fine.

538
00:59:29,926 --> 00:59:33,578
- Is Sophie awake?
- No, I went to see her and she slept deeply.

539
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:37,459
- How good. Is now 1 am, she arrived at 7 pm,
so it is six hours.

540
00:59:39,718 --> 00:59:41,807
Peter? You have change? I have only 50 Euros.

541
00:59:43,195 --> 00:59:45,183
- How much?
- 10 Euro.

542
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,914
- Here.
- Thank you.

543
00:59:48,915 --> 00:59:51,113
- Can I take you home, Isabelle?
- Yes.

544
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:57,161
- Peter, wait!
- What?

545
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:58,913
- I am going to take her.

546
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:01,200
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

547
01:00:06,794 --> 01:00:11,907
- Why you did not want Peter to take me?
- I told you: He has to get up early.

548
01:00:12,328 --> 01:00:15,034
- Do you not trust me?
- Of course.

549
01:00:15,553 --> 01:00:18,415
- So you do not trust him?
- What are you presuming, Isabelle?

550
01:00:19,528 --> 01:00:21,672
- I know that my mum told you everything.

551
01:00:22,237 --> 01:00:24,724
In any case, I am not the danger.

552
01:00:25,879 --> 01:00:27,219
- What are you implying?

553
01:00:37,392 --> 01:00:40,714
- Good evening.
- Hey, are you okay?

554
01:00:40,913 --> 01:00:43,330
- Yes, I gained 60 Euros.
- What?

555
01:00:43,753 --> 01:00:45,840
- As a nanny.

556
01:00:46,653 --> 01:00:48,314
- Very funny.

557
01:00:48,844 --> 01:00:52,287
- What are you watching?
- Nothing in particular, just nonsense.

558
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:55,231
- You have been waiting for me?
- No.

559
01:00:57,273 --> 01:01:02,050
- Mum is sleeping?
- Yes, she is very tired. It is not easy for her.

560
01:01:02,474 --> 01:01:06,396
- Why?
- Do not play innocent, Isabelle! You know why.

561
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,652
- What is it?
- Nothing. You make me laughing.

562
01:01:11,353 --> 01:01:13,242
- What is there to laugh?

563
01:01:14,285 --> 01:01:18,153
- You remind me of a guy I went to bed.
A customer .

564
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:32,800
- What are you playing, Isabelle?
- I am not playing.

565
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:37,122
- You should be careful with your mum. She is fragile.

566
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:40,439
You need to talk. She needs to understand.

567
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:44,122
- It is hard for your mother, you know?
- I have nothing to say , it is my life.

568
01:01:44,777 --> 01:01:47,930
- Make an effort, be nice! She is very shocked.

569
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:51,631
- And you, are you shocked?
- Yeah, me, too.

570
01:01:52,105 --> 01:01:53,912
But I do not care, I am not your father.

571
01:01:53,913 --> 01:01:55,606
- But precisely, what do you think?

572
01:01:57,239 --> 01:02:01,820
- I think you are in a phase of adolescence,
where you want to experience ...

573
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:04,758
know your limits, transgress.

574
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:09,152
- Did you sleep with a hooker before?
- I do not think, that is any of your business.

575
01:02:09,511 --> 01:02:12,008
- Come on, tell me, I will not say anything to mum!

576
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:12,995
- What are you doing?

577
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:18,091
- Nothing. we are talking.

578
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:20,726
- Go to bed at once!

579
01:02:31,223 --> 01:02:33,269
- I am sorry, but ...
- I know, do not say anything!

580
01:02:36,008 --> 01:02:38,320
- You could send her to a boarding school, right?

581
01:02:38,951 --> 01:02:40,803
- I do not know.

582
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:44,507
- You are accepting her vice.
- What are you saying ?

583
01:02:44,912 --> 01:02:50,042
- I was watching you.
- You are exaggerating. She just wants to provoke.

584
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,085
- It is my daughter and it disgusts me.

585
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:57,172
- You have to talk calmly.

586
01:02:59,217 --> 01:03:00,891
Where are you going?

587
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:07,192
- What are you doing ?
Did you see what time it is?

588
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,887
- I want to propose something.
- What?

589
01:03:22,944 --> 01:03:25,341
What do you think the two of us
go to London for a weekend?

590
01:03:25,342 --> 01:03:29,488
For shopping. Peter's parents have an apartment there.

591
01:03:29,489 --> 01:03:32,404
We could go see a musical.

592
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:35,850
I do not like musicals.

593
01:03:38,853 --> 01:03:41,240
What did we do to make you act like this ?

594
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:47,323
I do not understand. Before you told me everything.

595
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:49,932
- Is it Patrick?
- Of course not.

596
01:03:52,606 --> 01:03:54,453
- What did the psychologist say?
- Nonsense.

597
01:03:54,454 --> 01:03:56,959
- Is it bad?
- I do not want to talk about this with you.

598
01:03:58,779 --> 01:04:01,914
- But I can understand. I also had your age
and did stupid things.

599
01:04:01,915 --> 01:04:04,003
- You, too? You were a whore?

600
01:04:12,344 --> 01:04:16,101
I am your mother, Isabelle. It is normal to worry
and try to fix things.

601
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,643
- I know what is between you and Peter.

602
01:04:23,281 --> 01:04:25,031
- What are you talking about?

603
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:28,345
- You have sex.

604
01:04:31,588 --> 01:04:34,873
- If I say yes, what would that change?

605
01:04:35,474 --> 01:04:37,991
- That you trust me.

606
01:04:38,706 --> 01:04:42,254
- You scare me, Isabelle.

607
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:57,009
- What I liked was to arrange appointments.

608
01:04:58,023 --> 01:05:01,427
Chat online, talking on the phone.

609
01:05:02,211 --> 01:05:06,944
Listen to the voices, imagine things.

610
01:05:09,259 --> 01:05:12,358
Then go, discover the hotel ...

611
01:05:13,222 --> 01:05:15,657
not knowing who I would find.

612
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:18,524
It was like a game.

613
01:05:19,527 --> 01:05:21,730
A game ... dangerous.

614
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,821
No. Or maybe a little.

615
01:05:26,525 --> 01:05:29,864
At the time I almost felt nothing.

616
01:05:31,685 --> 01:05:34,749
But then, when remembered at home ...

617
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:36,876
or in high school ...

618
01:05:38,158 --> 01:05:40,432
wanted to do it again.

619
01:05:41,602 --> 01:05:43,229
With another one.

620
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,312
- What about the death of this man?

621
01:05:47,487 --> 01:05:49,258
- Yes.

622
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:53,130
Georges.

623
01:05:54,209 --> 01:05:58,279
- Did you see him several times, that Georges?
- Yes.

624
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,118
- Why?

625
01:06:04,689 --> 01:06:07,007
- He was friendly.

626
01:06:09,403 --> 01:06:11,090
With him it was more tender.

627
01:06:15,053 --> 01:06:17,460
Not asking much, just ...

628
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:24,844
caress ... looking at me.

629
01:06:30,048 --> 01:06:33,549
Except the last time.
He asked me to get up ...

630
01:06:35,673 --> 01:06:37,353
and died.

631
01:06:45,556 --> 01:06:47,426
After this, I had no desire.

632
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:53,448
I felt dirty.

633
01:06:54,304 --> 01:06:56,949
- Dirty? Why?

634
01:07:00,828 --> 01:07:02,275
- Because killing him.

635
01:07:30,253 --> 01:07:33,119
What is it?
- I slept with Etienne.

636
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,020
- That is great, it is what you wanted.
- No.

637
01:07:36,682 --> 01:07:40,424
I did very badly.
Now he is ignoring me.

638
01:07:41,008 --> 01:07:43,750
I saw him, acting as if nothing had happened.

639
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:47,228
- What was wrong?
- It lasted 3 minutes.

640
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:50,154
I felt nothing, even when he had ejaculated.

641
01:07:50,155 --> 01:07:54,323
- Do not worry! At least, you did it.
Something less to do.

642
01:07:56,581 --> 01:07:58,437
Do not cry. 

643
01:07:59,464 --> 01:08:02,316
It is always like the first time.

644
01:08:02,327 --> 01:08:04,123
- What do you know? You are still a virgin!

645
01:08:06,072 --> 01:08:08,118
- Did you sleep with your lawyer?
- No.

646
01:08:08,764 --> 01:08:13,025
I read many stories on the subject
and it is always the same story.

647
01:08:17,455 --> 01:08:20,225
Etienne? Are you coming to the party at
Benoit on Saturday?

648
01:08:22,517 --> 01:08:25,114
If you want, I will go with you.

649
01:08:27,252 --> 01:08:28,822
- Thank you.
- It is alright.

650
01:08:32,829 --> 01:08:36,179
- Mum agrees?
- Yes, she talked to my psychologist.

651
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:39,154
- Who will come?
- Students in my class.

652
01:08:42,514 --> 01:08:44,247
Are not I too ugly ?

653
01:08:45,244 --> 01:08:46,454
- No, it is fine.

654
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:49,537
Are not you going to make up?
- What do you think?

655
01:08:49,538 --> 01:08:50,812
- Yes, a little, at least.

656
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,290
There is a girl in my course.
You know what she does?

657
01:08:54,072 --> 01:08:56,081
- What?
- She gives kisses with tongue for five Euros.

658
01:08:56,449 --> 01:08:57,424
- Not expensive.

659
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:02,504
- Did you pay?
- Are you crazy? I am not in need.

660
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:05,771
- It is not shameful. It is good to practice.

661
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,529
- Do you like my friend Marco?
- Yes, I think.

662
01:09:13,308 --> 01:09:16,508
- I would like to sleep with a girl.
- Forget it! You do not have enough money.

663
01:09:17,229 --> 01:09:18,532
- Did you not quit?

664
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:22,232
- Sure. I am kidding.

665
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,754
It is for me. Do not say anything!

666
01:09:30,745 --> 01:09:32,201
- Hello.
- Hello.

667
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:34,291
- Ready?

668
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:36,308
- Good evening, Claire.
- Good evening, Madame.

669
01:09:36,694 --> 01:09:38,228
- Everything alright with you?
- Yes, and you?

670
01:09:38,812 --> 01:09:40,997
- Do not come too late
and call me if you have a problem!

671
01:09:40,998 --> 01:09:41,957
- Yes, I call.

672
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:43,508
- Thanks, have a good time, girls.
- Good evening.

673
01:09:44,045 --> 01:09:45,588
- Goodbye, girl, have fun!

674
01:09:49,222 --> 01:09:51,470
Do not worry, everything will be fine,
you have to trust her!

675
01:10:13,696 --> 01:10:14,854
- Hello.

676
01:10:16,531 --> 01:10:18,068
- How are you doing?
- Well, and you?

677
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:21,476
- Well, where are you going?
- I am walking.

678
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:23,842
- Hello, Isabelle.
- Hello.

679
01:11:24,509 --> 01:11:27,544
- Too hot, too?
- No, I needed some air.

680
01:11:28,407 --> 01:11:31,387
- Yeah, me too.
I think, I took too much.

681
01:11:34,606 --> 01:11:36,530
I did not know you were coming.
You do not usually go to parties.

682
01:11:36,531 --> 01:11:39,187
- Claire insisted.
- Good.

683
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:45,545
Do you want a cigarette?
- Yes, thank you.

684
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:03,876
- If I say I want to kiss you ...
are you going to send me to hell?

685
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:11,165
Sorry, I am very silly.

686
01:12:14,896 --> 01:12:16,847
- Okay, kiss!

687
01:12:19,115 --> 01:12:21,683
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

688
01:12:52,413 --> 01:12:53,808
- Isabelle, what are you doing?

689
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:56,611
Come, come!

690
01:13:17,013 --> 01:13:20,166
<i> I 'm alone in my room ... </i>

691
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:27,570
<i> dreaming of him to come ... </i>

692
01:13:30,414 --> 01:13:34,423
<i> to take me a day of childhood ... </i>

693
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:41,321
<i> and who would leave me ... </i>

694
01:13:42,884 --> 01:13:45,277
<i>away! </i>

695
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:51,461
<i> If I had to have described ... </i>

696
01:13:54,547 --> 01:13:58,963
<i> I would undoubtedly wrong . </i>

697
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:05,557
<i> But I already liked his smile ... </i>

698
01:14:08,588 --> 01:14:12,409
<i> have known before . </i>

699
01:14:29,112 --> 01:14:30,388
- Do you want to go home?

700
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,546
- Not the first night.

701
01:14:46,618 --> 01:14:50,937
<i> When I saw him ,
It was a bit like that ... </i>

702
01:14:53,466 --> 01:14:58,063
<i> had nothing
anyone. </i>

703
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:04,748
<i> But I knew he was ... </i>

704
01:15:08,544 --> 01:15:12,589
<i> and none other. </i>

705
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:16,870
- Spring -

706
01:15:20,945 --> 01:15:22,318
- Lunch is ready, Victor.

707
01:15:24,432 --> 01:15:25,320
Shit.

708
01:15:36,184 --> 01:15:38,555
- Are they coming?
- Yes, we can begin.

709
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:42,450
- You know it is the first day of summer today?
- Yes, I know.

710
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:09,314
Sorry, I do not know what is wrong with me.

711
01:16:20,477 --> 01:16:22,804
- What are you doing?
- Now let me handle this!

712
01:16:58,027 --> 01:17:00,335
- Good morning.
- Hi Alex, come sit!

713
01:17:00,915 --> 01:17:02,965
- Isabelle is coming?
- Yes, she is showering.

714
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:05,663
- And you, do not you shower?
- Not yet.

715
01:17:06,505 --> 01:17:08,556
- Do you bother?
- No, it smells.

716
01:17:09,226 --> 01:17:12,004
- What are you drinking? Coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

717
01:17:12,592 --> 01:17:15,839
- How was the concert last night?
- Great, I love this band.

718
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:17,808
There was a party afterwards,
but we were not going to.

719
01:17:18,392 --> 01:17:20,620
- Why?
- Because Isabelle wanted to return early.

720
01:17:20,621 --> 01:17:22,838
- I am not guilty.
- I know.

721
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:25,357
She is too serious, just thinking about studying.

722
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:45,904
- Isabelle, what are you doing?
Come, get yourself a croissant!

723
01:17:47,908 --> 01:17:49,396
- Where will we go for vacation this summer?

724
01:17:50,496 --> 01:17:52,432
- It is a sensitive issue.

725
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:56,008
- At Clos !
- Me , I would like to go back to Al Clos.

726
01:17:56,447 --> 01:17:59,237
At least, a couple of weeks.

727
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,908
- What are you reading?
- Lesmois.

728
01:18:04,488 --> 01:18:07,580
- What is it?
- Now you need to be quiet, I want to read in peace .

729
01:18:08,071 --> 01:18:10,022
- Do you not want to quit?
- Yes, but later.

730
01:18:14,116 --> 01:18:15,586
- So you are ignoring me?

731
01:18:20,119 --> 01:18:21,944
- It is over, Alex.

732
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:24,464
- What? What ended?
- We.

733
01:18:25,062 --> 01:18:26,713
- Why do you say this?

734
01:18:31,045 --> 01:18:32,870
- Because I am not in love with you.

735
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,762
- Why, and what did I do?

736
01:18:38,358 --> 01:18:41,682
- Nothing. I am. It is so.

737
01:18:49,117 --> 01:18:51,757
- We are good together.
We had fun, right?

738
01:18:51,758 --> 01:18:52,717
- Yes.

739
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:56,828
- Then? Give us time!

740
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,111
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

741
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:02,461
- Want to play PlayStation?

742
01:19:03,707 --> 01:19:04,691
- Go!

743
01:19:13,394 --> 01:19:15,834
- Where is Alex?
- He left.

744
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:21,742
- Why was he not saying goodbye to me when leaving?
- I do not know. He looked sad.

745
01:19:24,345 --> 01:19:26,797
- What did he say ?
- Nothing. He did not want to play.

746
01:19:28,379 --> 01:19:30,382
- Did you tell him?
- No.

747
01:19:31,069 --> 01:19:33,169
- Perhaps he suspects?
- Not that.

748
01:20:37,148 --> 01:20:38,895
- Good morning, Miss.
- Good morning.

749
01:20:50,514 --> 01:20:53,723
- Good morning, Miss. Do you want a drink?
- I am waiting for someone.

750
01:21:13,968 --> 01:21:16,550
- Good morning.
- Can I sit?

751
01:21:16,551 --> 01:21:17,886
- Yes.

752
01:21:25,808 --> 01:21:29,113
- What do you take?
- Like you.

753
01:21:29,258 --> 01:21:30,917
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

754
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:34,044
- Please, two whiskey.

755
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:40,944
- I found your number in one of his agendas.

756
01:21:41,445 --> 01:21:44,298
- Lea.
- It was my nickname.

757
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,390
- I know.

758
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:49,092
- I wanted to meet.

759
01:21:49,633 --> 01:21:54,591
Learning how the last girl was
to see my husband before he dies.

760
01:21:54,681 --> 01:21:56,389
- Sorry.

761
01:21:56,701 --> 01:21:59,316
You do not have to reproach yourself.
He was sick.

762
01:22:01,257 --> 01:22:04,076
Die making love is a cute death, right?

763
01:22:15,998 --> 01:22:19,671
You are young. And very pretty.

764
01:22:20,794 --> 01:22:22,203
- Thank you.

765
01:22:23,643 --> 01:22:27,102
- Too pretty. Did not imagine that.

766
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:30,505
- Neither imagined you so.
- Oh, yeah?

767
01:22:31,402 --> 01:22:34,246
- Have you talked about me?
- No, never.

768
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:48,001
- How old are you really ?
- 17 years.

769
01:22:48,636 --> 01:22:52,401
- 17. What a lovely age.

770
01:22:53,141 --> 01:22:56,582
I also was 17 when I met Georges.

771
01:22:57,629 --> 01:23:00,558
I knew he saw other women.

772
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:03,526
At first it hurt, but ...

773
01:23:05,622 --> 01:23:08,039
finally I settled me.

774
01:23:09,909 --> 01:23:12,676
I was always melancholic.

775
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:20,422
If I had been brave, less shy ...

776
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:25,568
I wish men paid to make love to me.

777
01:23:29,124 --> 01:23:30,780
But I never dared.

778
01:23:33,021 --> 01:23:35,202
I thought at times. As a fantasy.

779
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:42,359
Now, I am older, too. I would have to pay.

780
01:23:52,756 --> 01:23:55,826
You did it in room 6095, right?

781
01:23:57,041 --> 01:23:58,123
- Yes.

782
01:23:59,071 --> 01:24:03,966
- It is booked. And I would like you to accompany me.

783
01:24:06,423 --> 01:24:10,030
300 Euros. That was your rate?

784
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:39,083
So, it was here?
- Yes.

785
01:24:43,236 --> 01:24:45,116
- I needed to see this room.

786
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:55,219
We love to the end.

787
01:24:56,472 --> 01:24:58,360
Always with the same tenderness.

788
01:24:58,942 --> 01:25:00,871
- You want to talk or undress me?

789
01:25:04,565 --> 01:25:07,971
- It will not be necessary.
- Sorry.

790
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:13,122
- Come to bed with me!

791
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:34,789
- I also needed to see this room.

792
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:42,504
Thank you.
