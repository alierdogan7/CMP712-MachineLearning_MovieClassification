1
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,758
Stop.

2
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,559
This is coming down.

3
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,557
What? Why?

4
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,275
No, I love the idea of the mirror
on the ceiling, but that's just ugly.

5
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,313
But the thing is,
you look beautiful in it.

6
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,354
Now, see, if we're gonna take it down,
we gotta at least try it out...

7
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,596
...christen the new house.

8
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,598
And what do you suggest we use
for a bed?

9
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,397
We don't need a bed, because we got
this fine carpet right here.

10
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,479
So I guess we'll have fine carpet
tattoos all over our asses.

11
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,232
Wait, baby,
don't you have to go to work?

12
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't want any 30-second nookie.

13
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,595
I told them I'd be late. Now what?

14
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,313
- What about the movers?
- The movers?

15
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,954
- Yeah.
- They're gonna be here in an hour.

16
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,997
Which is just enough time.

17
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,792
Derek. You are so bad.

18
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,036
Like that isn't why you married me?

19
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,916
What about Kyle?

20
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,398
He'll be all right.
That boy will sleep through anything.

21
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,514
Gage Bendix?

22
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,069
Excuse me?

23
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,189
I couldn't help but notice
we were both going to 22.

24
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,198
Gage Bendix, yeah. I work there.

25
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,272
I thought that you might.

26
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,119
You have an appointment with us?

27
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,118
Why, do I look like a client?

28
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,715
Actually, you do.

29
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,959
Well, well, I hate to shatter the illusion,
but I'm a temp.

30
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,559
You're a temp?

31
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,879
Girl's gotta pay the rent.

32
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,749
I would've never guessed a temp.

33
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,035
Let me help you out.

34
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,071
There you go.

35
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,351
There you go.

36
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,511
Thanks. I owe you one.

37
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,472
- Good morning.
- Morning.

38
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,589
Are you following me?

39
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,837
No, I'm taking these files
to Mr. Charles's office.

40
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,395
- Derek Charles?
- Yeah, I guess you probably know him.

41
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,795
Yeah, I know who he is
and he's an asshole.

42
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,197
Takes himself way too seriously.
But don't tell him I said that, okay?

43
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,675
- I could get you in trouble?
- Oh, yeah. Big trouble.

44
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,199
My lips are sealed.

45
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,994
- Patrick.
- Good morning, Derek.

46
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,519
- Hey.
- How's the new house?

47
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,951
Chaos, man, chaos. I got out
just as the movers showed up.

48
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,388
Sharon must have loved that.

49
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,955
Yeah, if she calls mad,
you tell her I'm in a meeting.

50
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,515
Hey. Remember who used to sit
at this desk, huh?

51
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,278
She'll know I'm lying.

52
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,312
Can I help you?

53
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,509
That's Derek Charles?

54
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,269
Yes.

55
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,550
Better watch out, girl, he's married.

56
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,513
- The good ones are always married.
- Right. Or straight.

57
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,630
Did you talk to our German friend,
Herr Ganz?

58
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,956
Actually, I just got off the phone
with him.

59
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,513
- And?
- He doesn't like the way...

60
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,508
...the stock market's gyrating, thinks
the hedge-fund wave is about to crest.

61
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,188
- You think he's right?
- No, no. I don't think he's right.

62
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,549
He's wrong. You know Ganz.

63
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,115
He gets paranoid when
anything goes mainstream.

64
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,548
So he makes a lot of noise...

65
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,514
...but I managed to talk him
into a private-equity portfolio instead.

66
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,277
To the tune of 155 million.

67
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,271
I want you to throw Derek
your support on this.

68
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,471
I am just honoured
to exist in Derek's world.

69
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,999
Whose legs are those?

70
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,475
- Never seen them before.
- I think she's a new temp.

71
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,432
I think you mean temptress.

72
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,029
Always nice to have a girl
around the office, isn't it?

73
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,152
Derek married the last eye candy
we had, took her off the market.

74
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,272
Yes, sir.
Miss us a little Sharon around here.

75
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,469
I don't think you do.

76
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,392
- Patrick, forward my calls.
- Will do.

77
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,875
- Okay. Good night, Marge.
- Bye, Derek.

78
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,596
D, you cutting out early? I grabbed us
a couple tickets to the Lakers tonight.

79
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,074
You're killing me. I'm moving.

80
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,508
- I gotta get home.
- So?

81
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,915
So do I look like a man
who wants to get a divorce?

82
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,429
Why don't I call her and say
we got a work emergency?

83
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,358
- No, thanks, I'll stay married.
- Coward.

84
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,073
Yeah.

85
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,035
Goodbye, Mr. Charles.

86
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,753
- You punked me.
- I'm sorry, but you set me up.

87
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,394
I'll get my revenge.
You might like to know...

88
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,797
...that everybody disagrees with you.
- About what?

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,991
About Derek Charles
being an asshole.

90
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,997
They say he's the nicest guy
in the firm.

91
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,758
Yeah, well, I've got them fooled.

92
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,359
I'm Lisa, by the way.

93
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,199
Hey, Lisa By The Way.

94
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,152
Good luck at your next job.

95
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,759
Hold the door, please.

96
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,837
They're keeping me on
for a few more days...

97
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,713
...so I might see you on Monday.

98
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,518
Sharon!

99
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,755
Your turn.

100
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,712
No, I think it's your turn!

101
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,150
Don't even try it.
It's definitely your turn.

102
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,839
Looks like I'm stuck, huh?

103
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,598
Huh, Kyle?

104
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,358
Come here.

105
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,396
Oh, my God.
What is your mom feeding you?

106
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,149
What do you think about giving
that magic mirror another test drive?

107
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,797
Sharon, you're so bad.

108
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,230
Like that's not why you married me.

109
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,079
- Morning, Marge.
- Morning, Derek.

110
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,759
Hi.

111
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,389
Remember me?

112
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,508
Lisa By The Way, right?

113
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,075
Very good, I'm impressed.

114
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,874
Hey, Marge, where's Patrick?

115
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,479
Out with the flu.

116
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,477
I did some trading
with the other temps...

117
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,398
...and I wrangled your desk.

118
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,875
I hope that's okay.

119
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,317
No, that's fine. Why don't you
grab a pad and a pen, follow me?

120
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,194
Here's a memo
for the Christmas party this Friday.

121
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,197
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

122
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,918
Sit down.

123
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,837
So why don't they invite spouses?

124
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,993
What?

125
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,316
To the party. It says no spouses.

126
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,832
Yeah, it's Joe Gage's rule. Actually,
it's like that at a lot of companies.

127
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,952
I guess they figure you're not gonna
kick back and let loose...

128
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,232
...if your spouse is there.
The reason of having the party, right?

129
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,113
- So does this party get pretty wild?
- Oh, not usually.

130
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,869
Well, that's no fun.

131
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,913
I called Patrick. He said that
you like it black with two sugars.

132
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,916
If it's cold, I can go nuke it
in the kitchen.

133
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,032
No, actually, it's perfect. Thank you
very much. Let's get started.

134
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,719
- Ready when you are.
- It's Monday.

135
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,753
- First things first.
- Took care of that.

136
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,109
Took care of what?

137
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,356
On Mondays
you always send your wife flowers.

138
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,791
This week you sent her
a dozen long-stemmed red roses.

139
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,036
I called to confirm
they've been delivered.

140
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,559
Thank you.

141
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,112
So how long have you two
been married?

142
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,789
Three years in March.

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,434
And you still send her flowers
every week. Lucky girl.

144
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,313
Yeah, it's kind of a tradition.

145
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,830
Patrick said that you started back
when she was your assistant.

146
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,031
You and Patrick had quite
a conversation.

147
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,673
- Let's run some calls.
- Fire away.

148
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,677
Why don't we start
with Phil Trendle?

149
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,075
See if you can get a lunch
appointment next week...

150
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,475
...but push for The Water Grill.
I like the fish.

151
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,910
- The Water Grill's fantastic.
- Terry Mills.

152
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,793
- Am I going too fast?
- I'm just waiting on you.

153
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,998
Are you always this efficient?

154
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,428
Does that surprise you?

155
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,108
Yeah. Yeah, most of the temps
we get here, they're like...

156
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,709
I think you'll find
I'm not your typical temp.

157
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,957
We were at the grocery store,
I look over...

158
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,628
...and Kyle is flirting
with the checkout girl.

159
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,389
<i>She's about 16, and he's 2.</i>

160
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,309
<i>He was giving her the same look
you give when you see a pretty girl.</i>

161
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,069
I think you've been teaching my baby
how to flirt. Like father, like son.

162
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,832
<i>So, anyway, on the way home,
I stopped by campus today...</i>

163
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,919
<i>... and I pick ed up a catalogue
for next semester's curriculum.</i>

164
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,270
<i>Let me tell you, I cannot wait.</i>

165
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,229
Do you need me?

166
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,233
<i>I'm gonna show it to you tonight.
I need your opinion on my courses.</i>

167
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,793
Are you listening to me?

168
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,477
Baby.

169
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,752
If I bundle Managerial Economics
and Operations Management...

170
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,315
...then I won't take Management
Information Systems...

171
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,511
...until next semester, right?

172
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,675
School?

173
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,757
- Derek.
- It's like an online degree?

174
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,679
Come on, baby, not tonight.
You know this is important to me.

175
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,313
Well, it's important to me too...

176
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,274
...but I was kind of hoping you liked
being a mom, staying home with Kyle.

177
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,869
You know I love being a mom.

178
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,430
We got all this room. I make
enough money for you and I to...

179
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,437
It's not about the money.

180
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,595
We had an agreement.

181
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,156
You said that you'd work hard, I'd have
the baby, you'd get your promotion.

182
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,349
Then I'd get my degree.

183
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,039
- I said that?
- Yes, you did.

184
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,629
You have something to talk about
when you get home.

185
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,319
I need some things to talk about.

186
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,273
- So Kyle's gonna be an only child?
- Let's get him a puppy.

187
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,675
A female that looks
like your side of the family...

188
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,713
...and tell him it's his sister.
- Can we call her Little Sharon?

189
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,273
Hey, Little Sharon. Come here.

190
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,233
You know exactly
who I'm talking about.

191
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,479
You know what, I wanna see you
say that in front of her face.

192
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,878
D? Why didn't you
call me back today?

193
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,957
- What time did you call?
- Around 4.

194
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,993
- You should leave a message.
- I did leave a message.

195
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,674
Oh, Patrick was sick,
and, you know, the temp...

196
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,552
We had a temp and she said...

197
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,228
...Shannon called
but didn't leave a number.

198
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,750
She? I thought we had an agreement,
no female assistants.

199
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,428
Baby, I don't control
temp availability.

200
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,039
Is she pretty?

201
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,117
Pretty plain.

202
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,437
Actually, you know what,
she did a better job than Patrick.

203
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,198
Except for messing up
your message.

204
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,595
- I want her fired immediately.
- Immediately.

205
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,870
- I'm serious.
- I promise.

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,195
Good night, Shannon.

207
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,998
Hope we're not interrupting
anything.

208
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,350
No, no, it's a treat to have you here.

209
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm taking Kyle to The Grove today
to see Santa.

210
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,950
You wanna come?
Get your picture taken on Santa's lap?

211
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,718
No, I would, but I'm swamped.

212
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,797
You need me back in the office,
don't you?

213
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,434
Excuse me.
Here's your coffee, freshly nuked.

214
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,154
Hey, Lisa.

215
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,558
This is my wife, Sharon. Sharon,
this is Lisa. She's temping for Patrick.

216
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,274
It is such a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Charles.

217
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,994
- Hi.
- Hi. And this must be Kyle.

218
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,148
I can already tell
he's gonna be a heartbreaker.

219
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,828
Hi, Kyle. I'm Lisa.

220
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,109
Say hi, Kyle.

221
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,551
Oh, he can say hello. He's usually
not this shy around strangers.

222
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,752
What a handsome boy.
He looks just like you.

223
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,435
You think so?

224
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,514
Most people think he looks
like the beautiful Sharon.

225
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,119
Talk about the perfect family.

226
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,959
The three of you should be
on the cover of a magazine.

227
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,549
It's a good thing you won't be here
too long.

228
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,830
I know my husband
can be very demanding.

229
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,190
Actually, I'm learning a lot
from your husband.

230
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,470
I bet you are.

231
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,554
Joe Gage needs to see you
when you have a moment.

232
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,034
Great.

233
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,830
It's nice to meet you, Sharon.

234
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,075
You too, Liz.

235
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,273
- It's Lisa.
- Excuse me?

236
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,436
It's Lisa. You said Liz.

237
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,473
Sorry. Lisa.

238
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,439
- Sharon.
- Wasn't me. Blame Shannon.

239
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,596
- What's the deal with her?
- What do you mean?

240
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,153
"Looks just like you, Derek."

241
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,277
But he is kind of handsome like me.

242
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,708
You said she was plain.

243
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,876
That girl may be a lot,
but she ain't plain.

244
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,231
I wouldn't know.
I only have eyes for you.

245
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,715
And you really think
that's gonna work?

246
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,478
Come on.

247
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,830
Take you around the office.
You can see the gang.

248
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,393
I know that you must miss it.

249
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,319
- When is Patrick coming back?
- Tomorrow.

250
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,832
You better hope so.

251
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,398
Crudo.

252
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,955
Wow, look at the tree.

253
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,992
Christmas already.

254
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,397
- Hey, Stan.
- Good morning, Mr. Charles.

255
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,556
- I'm back.
- Patrick.

256
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,638
- Feeling better?
- Yeah, thanks.

257
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,479
You know it's gonna take a lot more
than some stomach bug...

258
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,591
...to keep me away
from that Christmas party.

259
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,755
Yeah.

260
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,077
Not sure we can say the same
for Marge.

261
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,594
You get around, don't you?

262
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,193
Poor girl called in sick
with the stomach bug.

263
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,549
She caught it from Patrick.

264
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,751
That's what she gets
for using my lip gloss.

265
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,313
All right, girls.
Behave yourselves out here.

266
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,439
So how many times did you get busted
listening in on Derek's calls?

267
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,392
As if you don't.

268
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,397
I'm way too smooth
to ever get caught.

269
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,875
- I bet you are.
- How long have you been here?

270
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,071
- Ten years in April.
- I bet you know more...

271
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,635
...about what happens
behind these doors than anybody.

272
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,671
Sweetie, you have no idea.

273
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,189
My nickname around here is 411.

274
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,597
411. Well, maybe we can grab
a cocktail after work sometime.

275
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,392
You can catch me up with girl talk.

276
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,070
If you think you can pump me for
information with a couple of Cosmos...

277
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,679
...you're right.

278
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,516
I'm sorry, I thought everyone
was at lunch.

279
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,718
- I should go.
- No.

280
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,873
You stay. Okay?

281
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,710
I'm gonna just grab my lunch and...

282
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,070
...head on back to my office.

283
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,639
Okay?

284
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,793
- You okay? You wanna talk about it?
- It's nothing.

285
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,399
Nothing?

286
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,874
You know, most people I know
don't cry over nothing.

287
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,036
You think I'm crying?

288
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,078
This is just allergies.

289
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,555
Oh, allergies, okay.
What are you allergic to?

290
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,355
Men, apparently.

291
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,193
Can I sit down?

292
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,872
Yeah.

293
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,795
You having boyfriend troubles
right now?

294
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,837
I'm beginning to think
there's something wrong with me.

295
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,315
There's nothing wrong with you.

296
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,150
I wish I could believe that.

297
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,115
Maybe you haven't met
the right guy yet.

298
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,469
I'm beginning to think
all the good ones are taken.

299
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,069
I'm no expert, but, you know,
if it didn't work out...

300
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,669
...then maybe it wasn't meant to be.

301
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,835
Maybe.

302
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,918
And then, you know,
you're gonna meet the right guy...

303
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,519
...you'll know immediately.

304
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,551
Is that how it was
with you and Sharon?

305
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,750
Yeah. Yeah, it does happen.

306
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,236
- Great. Now I'm jealous.
- Why?

307
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,917
She has everything.

308
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,078
Perfect husband, perfect child,
perfect marriage.

309
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,113
No. No, nothing's perfect.

310
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,629
You know, there are problems
in every relationship.

311
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,717
The most important thing
is to move forward.

312
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,956
You gotta keep moving forward,
you know?

313
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,192
Hey, Lisa, look, don't beat yourself up
over this guy.

314
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,960
Look at you, you're a bright,
attractive woman.

315
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,188
Any man would be lucky
to have you.

316
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,469
Yeah, right.

317
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,672
No. Honestly, if I were single...

318
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,111
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

319
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,355
Is it working?

320
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,237
Yes.

321
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,399
Good.

322
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,238
You hang in there, okay?

323
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,675
It's gonna be just fine.

324
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,552
Thanks, Derek.

325
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,036
Mister... Mr. Charles.

326
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,596
I'm sorry, excuse me.

327
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,314
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

328
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,079
What was that all about?

329
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,272
Oh, man, her boyfriend dumped her
and I was being nice.

330
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,392
I'll take up that slack.
That is one smoking hot piece of ass.

331
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,750
- Stop it, Ben.
- Come on. Like you haven't noticed.

332
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,632
No, dude,
I'm not in the game anymore.

333
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,956
I'm retired and coaching, as are you.

334
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,596
I'm still in the game. I'm just
on the bench, waiting to play again.

335
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,552
Careful, D.
It's not like the old days...

336
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,036
...where you could get away with
office nookie and not get nailed for it.

337
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,195
Careful, D?

338
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,231
You went and married yours,
that's all.

339
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,919
If you're thinking of that girl...

340
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,917
- You saw her first.
- You are a fool.

341
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,590
Sadly, I don't think I'm her type.
Now, you, on the other hand...

342
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,991
All I'm saying
is that these single gals...

343
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,316
...see the workplace
as their hunting ground.

344
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,479
And I think this one has got you
in her cross hairs.

345
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,115
Sharon. Hey.

346
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,470
I just put him to sleep, baby.

347
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,275
Red? Blue?

348
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,629
- Red? Blue?
- The red one.

349
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,398
- What you doing tonight?
- The usual. Formula, oatmeal.

350
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,074
How do I look?

351
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,556
- You look all right.
- I look all right.

352
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,991
Remember the last time you went
to that party and got drunk.

353
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,793
Kyle.

354
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,558
Eat something.

355
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,718
I will. I'm gonna grab a burger
at Jake's.

356
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,230
- Okay. I love you.
- Okay. I love you too.

357
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,156
Fourth quarter, Derek Charles
puts it up, three seconds to go.

358
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,030
- I love you, baby.
- Bye. Eat something, baby.

359
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,271
- This seat taken?
- Yeah.

360
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,833
No, I'm kidding.

361
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,439
Be my guest.

362
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,276
- Look at you.
- It's a Christmas party.

363
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,239
Oh, yeah. You look great.

364
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,908
Thank you.
You grabbing a bite before?

365
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,348
Yeah. You too?

366
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,959
Brilliant minds think alike.

367
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,754
Thank you, John.
Still the best burger in town.

368
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,279
Really?

369
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,433
Hey, John? John?

370
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,919
John.

371
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,271
- Can I have one too?
- Fix her up. The special.

372
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,156
- That was delicious.
- I told you.

373
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,831
You know, we used to come back here
after a hard day's work and cut loose.

374
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,234
- Work hard, play hard?
- Yeah.

375
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,273
Back in the day,
I would throw them back too.

376
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,032
Hey, how's your boyfriend trouble?

377
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,520
- Keep moving forward, right?
- Exactly.

378
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,679
- All right.
- So, what's the grand plan, Derek?

379
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,677
Run the company by 35...

380
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,953
...jet by 40, retire on my private island
and own the Lakers by 50.

381
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,355
- I'm a Sixers fan.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

382
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,710
I'll bring you around to my team,
okay?

383
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,513
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

384
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,109
Can...? Can I please have
a dirty martini?

385
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,275
Sure.

386
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,311
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

387
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,949
Oh, come on. Big talker.

388
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,115
No, thanks.

389
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,995
- It's Christmas time. Work's dead.
- John, no.

390
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,275
- Bring one for my friend.
- How dirty do you want it?

391
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,355
Make it filthy.

392
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,917
This is for you.

393
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,195
Patrick? Patrick. Patrick.

394
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,358
Once again, great job as the head
of the decoration committee.

395
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,838
- You're like Santa's Little Helper.
- Well, I wouldn't let your people do it.

396
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,117
Hey, don't try this at home, huh?
You'll hurt yourself.

397
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,069
What's up?

398
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,793
What's going on?
You look beautiful.

399
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,673
I'll be right back.

400
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,668
I'm coming for you, Derek.

401
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,471
- I'm coming for you.
- No. I don't dance.

402
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,240
No, come on, you don't wanna
with me. Okay, okay.

403
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,919
Yeah. All right.

404
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,835
- Is this you, Marge?
- That's me.

405
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,235
Let me get some of that boogie.

406
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,910
- Didn't know you could move like that.
- Because I'm stuck behind a desk.

407
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,715
- Okay, you do have legs under there.
- Oh, yes, I do.

408
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,798
- All right. You are smooth.
- Smooth, baby, real smooth.

409
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,433
- Really smooth.
- I'm coming in.

410
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,995
All righty, baby. He's all yours.

411
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,031
- Hey, Office Asshole.
- That's Mr. Office Asshole to you.

412
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,639
Tequila?

413
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,719
Beer, three martinis, and tequila?
No, I don't think so.

414
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,399
Coward.

415
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,272
Bring it on.

416
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,277
You've got the moves.

417
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,835
That's Soul Train for you, baby.

418
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,678
- What you got?
- Wanna see what I got?

419
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,916
- Let's go, let's go.
- Bring it.

420
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,556
You got some moves. Okay, temp.

421
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,399
- Nasty, nasty.
- Hey.

422
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,038
You know,
I wasn't gonna come tonight.

423
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,912
Why not?

424
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,396
I haven't been here that long and...

425
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,910
I'm sure everybody here is happy
that you showed up.

426
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,194
Even you?

427
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,710
What do you mean, "even me"?
I'm your biggest supporter here.

428
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,398
You wanna put one on the cheek?

429
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,110
If you don't, people will
really think something's going on.

430
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,272
Well, we're gonna have
to take that chance then, huh?

431
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,829
Whoa, where you going?

432
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,237
This evening's just getting started.
Sally Sloane. We got Sally Sloane.

433
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,237
You remember her?
She gave us lap dances!

434
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,839
- Sally.
- Derek has singles!

435
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,600
- He has singles!
- I gotta go home, sober up.

436
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,756
You wanna get out of here
and go find trouble?

437
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,191
- No, thank you. No, thank you.
- Where is your holiday spirit?

438
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,992
With my wife and kid.

439
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,510
Gotta take a leak, then I'm sneaking
out of here, all right?

440
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,553
You're no fun, D. No fun at all.

441
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,869
Lisa, Lisa.

442
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,789
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop.

443
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,479
Come on, stop, no.

444
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,273
<i>Fuck.</i>

445
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,437
<i>You need to stop it.</i>

446
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,717
Who's there?

447
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,118
Stop. Okay. Okay.

448
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,352
Lisa, Lisa.

449
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,473
Oh, God, Lisa, Lisa. Stop. Stop.
Don't do that. Don't...

450
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,954
Stop, stop.

451
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,715
Stop.

452
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,711
Lisa, stop.

453
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,399
Stop.

454
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,310
Stop.

455
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,919
Stop it.

456
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,759
- What? Derek.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

457
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,758
What's wrong? Derek!

458
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,916
If you don't feel like you can drive,
I have cab vouchers.

459
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,032
Cab vouchers for anybody
who can't drive. Don't want you hurt.

460
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,912
Come on, don't be shy.

461
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,558
Freak.

462
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,873
Well, well, well.
Living dangerously, aren't we?

463
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,275
Patrick, you silly old queen.

464
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,673
Dance with me.

465
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,873
Dance with me.

466
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,558
How was it?

467
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,472
The usual, baby.

468
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,116
Anything interesting happen?

469
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,232
No.

470
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,919
Good morning.

471
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,599
Hey. Morning.

472
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,512
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

473
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,790
Man, you should've stayed.

474
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,833
Roger from Acquisitions tossed
his cookies on the Christmas tree.

475
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,439
Sorry I missed that.

476
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,838
Bad time?

477
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,596
No.

478
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,872
Joe wants to know when you'll
be done with the Ganz portfolio.

479
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,714
Tell him I'll have it to him
by the end of the day.

480
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,959
Thanks.

481
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,951
Sure.

482
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,477
Joe really likes the ladies, huh?

483
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,950
I wouldn't know.

484
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,951
Hey. All right if I take off?

485
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,674
- Yeah. Go home.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

486
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,518
Okay.

487
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,073
Hey, Lisa.

488
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,598
Hey.

489
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,759
I owe you an apology
for the Christmas party.

490
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,673
I think that I sort of took you
by surprise.

491
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,317
Yeah, you know,
we both had a few drinks.

492
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,919
So let's just forget about it.

493
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,113
What if I can't?

494
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,876
Lisa, nothing happened.

495
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,875
All right, have it your way.
Nothing happened.

496
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,393
All right, get out of my car.

497
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,953
Get out of my car right now.

498
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,433
Get out of my car.

499
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,189
Relax.

500
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,755
- Derek, relax.
- Come on. Out of my car.

501
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,510
- Get out of here.
- No one's around to see us.

502
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,829
God. I almost went insane today.
Having to pretend...

503
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,952
...like I was concentrating on work,
when all I could think about...

504
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,310
Lisa! Get out of my car now!

505
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,030
Derek, what's wrong?

506
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,835
- What did I do?
- Hey, hey.

507
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,554
I don't know what's wrong,
whether you're dense or what...

508
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,832
...but let me tell you something.
There's nothing going on between us.

509
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,476
Nothing! Okay? I wouldn't jeopardise
my job. For chrissakes, I work here.

510
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,830
Stop! Don't touch me. Just get out.

511
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,234
Get out.

512
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,714
Get out.

513
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,235
- Get out! Come on!
- God!

514
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,876
- Maybe you are an asshole.
- Yeah, all right. Get out.

515
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,392
Sharon?

516
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,954
Shar?

517
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,990
Something I need to tell you.

518
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,275
What's wrong?

519
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,472
I spent the last hour and a half
talking my sister off the ledge.

520
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,671
- Sheila?
- Can you believe Tim's been having...

521
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,350
...an affair with some random
woman at work for a year and a half?

522
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,117
- How did she find out?
- Tim just blurted it out.

523
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,073
He said he was leaving her.
With three kids.

524
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,638
- Yeah, that's tough.
- It's a disaster. If it were me...

525
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,673
No, that would never be you,
because I would never cheat on you.

526
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,595
I know.

527
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,638
Tim is an asshole.

528
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,912
Tell me about it.

529
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,960
So, what were you gonna tell me?

530
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,513
What?

531
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,870
You said you had something
to tell me. What is it?

532
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,118
No.

533
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,915
Just a problem at work.
Nothing I can't handle.

534
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,756
Why didn't you tell me?

535
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,471
Honestly, there was nothing to tell.

536
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,672
She grabbed your package,
flashed you in your car.

537
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,598
Come on.
I thought we were best friends.

538
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,995
I cannot believe
you didn't tell me sooner.

539
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,350
- Ben, you think this is funny?
- Yes, I do.

540
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,757
I kind of thought maybe she was
into you a little. I just never figured...

541
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,394
I don't get it. You know, I...

542
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,318
Honestly, Ben.

543
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,034
"Hey, how are you?" I didn't...
I was just being nice.

544
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,193
That's all.

545
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,595
You sure you didn't lead her on?
Just a little?

546
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,270
- No. Not a goddamn thing. Honestly.
- That girl is hot.

547
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,953
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Report it to Human Resources.

548
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,834
You're gonna get her fired?

549
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,754
- I don't have a choice.
- Let's just be careful about this.

550
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,110
What if she says
that you came onto her?

551
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,275
No way.

552
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,948
We're talking history
of behaviour here, Derek.

553
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,118
When's the last time you had
a female assistant at your desk, huh?

554
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,435
People are gonna wonder.

555
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,079
- Morning, Mr. Charles.
- Hey.

556
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,599
- Hank back there?
- Go right in.

557
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,189
- Hey, Hank.
- Derek, hey.

558
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,595
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

559
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,155
I have... I have a personal matter
I gotta talk to you about.

560
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,998
You know Lisa Sheridan, the temp?

561
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,634
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She worked your desk for a while.

562
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,400
Yeah, that's right. She did.

563
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,355
Hank, this is awkward, okay?

564
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,233
If you're here to file a complaint
about her performance...

565
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,634
...you can save your breath.

566
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,115
Her agency called,
said she's not coming back in.

567
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,912
They already sent a replacement.

568
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,791
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

569
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,314
They say why?

570
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,308
No.

571
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,518
Why, was there some sort
of problem?

572
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,039
Problem?

573
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,119
No. No problem. No problem.

574
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,994
I just thought she was way in
over her head, that's all.

575
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,637
- But if she already quit, then...
- She beat you to it.

576
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,989
Yeah.

577
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,474
Yeah.

578
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,911
Yeah.

579
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,349
- Was there anything else?
- No. Guess not.

580
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,949
- How's the new house?
- You know, couldn't be better.

581
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,673
- Tell Sharon I said hi.
- I will.

582
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,792
Actually, you guys should come by
once we settle down. Come by.

583
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,479
- That sounds great.
- All right.

584
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,511
- See you, Hank.
- Bye-bye.

585
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,357
- So?
- She quit.

586
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,629
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

587
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,353
Do you have a horseshoe
up your ass?

588
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,437
You are the luckiest bastard I know.

589
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,914
Looks that way.

590
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,758
Not a bad early Christmas present.

591
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,757
All right.

592
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,229
Thank you.

593
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,715
Thank you. I'm getting
all these gifts. Look at this.

594
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,829
Friedrich?

595
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,870
Hey, it's Derek Charles.

596
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,629
Hey. How was your Christmas?

597
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,151
No, mine was great.
I had a great time with my family.

598
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,238
No, I'm in the office working
for you right now.

599
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,950
Absolutely. That's what we do.
That's what we do.

600
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,720
Hey, you take a look
at that prospectus for me?

601
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,031
I told you.

602
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,195
I told you.

603
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,835
<i>Yeah. No, I think we're gonna have
a great New Year.</i>

604
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,951
Baby, it's after 3?

605
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,675
That's the last time I'm celebrating out
on New Years.

606
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,715
Next year, we'll celebrate at home.
Just you, me, and Kyle.

607
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,157
Aren't you gonna get that?

608
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,396
No. It'll wait till the morning.

609
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,397
What if it's Ganz with the approval?

610
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,918
It's noon in Munich. Go on, lazy.

611
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,753
Ganz?

612
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,915
No.

613
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,033
What was that?

614
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,358
Nothing. I just gotta get a
new spam blocker.

615
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,749
And then Joe was like:

616
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,953
"Oh, we're not drinking. This is a
retreat. We're gonna stay sober.

617
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,718
Do some bonding."

618
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,673
If Joe said that, he must've
been drunk at the time.

619
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,792
Right? So I'll call you later
and check on you and Kyle.

620
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,955
Okay.

621
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,155
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lap dance. Lap
dance. Who brought up lap dance?

622
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,591
This is... This is a business retreat.
This is work.

623
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,553
We are clocked in.
Unless it was Joe's idea.

624
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,069
Well, it's a brilliant idea,
so it must've been mine.

625
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,033
All righty. Well, then,
let's see a show of hands...

626
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,437
...of who wants to see
some hot, oily breasts...

627
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,438
...being jammed into their faces?
Derek, are you in?

628
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,675
I'm a married man.

629
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,836
- I don't have to pay for it.
- You're paying.

630
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,792
- You just don't know it yet.
- Hear, hear.

631
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,116
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's this?

632
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,514
A dirty martini.

633
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,678
- No, I didn't...
- It's from the lady at the bar.

634
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,792
I do have to say I'm kind of a fan
of the waitress staff around here.

635
00:47:09,873 --> 00:47:11,545
We should hit one of those clubs.

636
00:47:11,753 --> 00:47:13,584
Derek, are you okay?

637
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:16,466
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought I saw
somebody I know.

638
00:47:16,673 --> 00:47:19,983
Somebody you know,
or somebody you'd like to know?

639
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:21,387
He can't be tempted.

640
00:47:21,593 --> 00:47:23,185
Can't blame him.
Too scared of Sharon.

641
00:47:23,393 --> 00:47:27,306
Speaking of Sharon, I said
I'd call her. I'll be right back.

642
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:32,313
Hey. Hey, babe.

643
00:47:32,513 --> 00:47:34,708
<i>How's the male bonding?</i>

644
00:47:34,913 --> 00:47:37,108
As you can guess,
everybody's wasted.

645
00:47:38,073 --> 00:47:41,349
In about half an hour, I'll be able...

646
00:47:42,153 --> 00:47:43,825
<i>Derek, are you there?</i>

647
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:46,786
<i>Wait, I think Kyle wants
to say good night.</i>

648
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:48,949
<i>Derek, are you still there?</i>

649
00:47:49,153 --> 00:47:51,986
<i>- Babe, I gotta call you right back.
- It'll just tak e a second.</i>

650
00:47:52,193 --> 00:47:54,946
<i>- Say good night to Daddy.
- They're calling for me to come back.</i>

651
00:47:55,153 --> 00:47:58,065
<i>- Honey, I'm gonna call you right back.
- Derek?</i>

652
00:47:59,073 --> 00:48:00,062
Derek?

653
00:48:00,273 --> 00:48:01,422
Was that Sharon?

654
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:03,988
I can always tell from
the pained look on your face...

655
00:48:04,193 --> 00:48:06,070
...when you've been talking to her.

656
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:08,951
How did you know I'd be here?

657
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:11,508
What's wrong? You don't look happy
to see me.

658
00:48:11,713 --> 00:48:13,908
I'm not happy to see you.

659
00:48:14,113 --> 00:48:15,148
What are you doing here?

660
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:17,867
You said that you would
never jeopardise your job.

661
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:22,143
That's why I quit,
so that we could be together.

662
00:48:22,353 --> 00:48:23,866
You misunderstood me.

663
00:48:24,073 --> 00:48:29,193
I'm married, happily married.
There will never be us...

664
00:48:29,393 --> 00:48:31,543
...together, ever.

665
00:48:31,753 --> 00:48:34,825
You're worried what Joe and Ben
might think.

666
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:36,466
I'll tell you what they'll think.

667
00:48:36,673 --> 00:48:39,346
They'll think that we arranged it
and we did.

668
00:48:40,713 --> 00:48:42,305
What are you talking about?

669
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:45,431
I see what you're doing.

670
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:49,308
One of us has to take charge,
and I guess that's gonna be me.

671
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:54,109
So you go back and you say your
good nights to the boys, and...

672
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:55,985
...l'll be waiting in my room, 610.

673
00:48:56,193 --> 00:48:57,421
I'm not coming to your room.

674
00:48:57,633 --> 00:49:00,306
- You want me to come to yours?
- You're sick.

675
00:49:00,873 --> 00:49:03,512
- You need help.
- I know.

676
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,067
Help me, Derek.

677
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,585
You stay away from me.

678
00:49:13,273 --> 00:49:14,501
<i>- Sharon?
- Sharon?</i>

679
00:49:14,713 --> 00:49:16,988
<i>It's Ben.
Dude, you done for the night?</i>

680
00:49:17,193 --> 00:49:19,627
No. I'm coming back.

681
00:49:23,553 --> 00:49:24,952
<i>Hey, come on, D, it's early.</i>

682
00:49:25,153 --> 00:49:27,621
Let's hit my room, plunder the minibar,
charge it to Joe.

683
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:32,907
No, I, I can't. That last drink
totally kicked my ass, man.

684
00:49:33,113 --> 00:49:36,628
All right, drunky. Don't forget,
9 a.m. tomorrow, Tiffany Room.

685
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:38,949
Joe's big rah-rah to the troops.

686
00:49:39,153 --> 00:49:41,667
Yeah, 9 a.m.

687
00:49:41,873 --> 00:49:43,670
Lightweight.

688
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:24,268
Out.

689
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:26,987
Baby.

690
00:50:29,713 --> 00:50:31,192
No.

691
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,388
Does that feel good?

692
00:50:39,593 --> 00:50:41,185
No.

693
00:50:51,153 --> 00:50:52,632
Hush, baby.

694
00:51:06,593 --> 00:51:09,027
No, please, stop.

695
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:18,790
Does that feel good?

696
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:35,825
Housekeeping.

697
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:37,830
- Sharon?
- Oh, sorry.

698
00:51:40,873 --> 00:51:42,943
Oh, God.

699
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:52,231
Oh, shit.

700
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,425
Of course,
we here at Gage Bendix...

701
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:58,863
...have a couple advantages
over the competition...

702
00:51:59,073 --> 00:52:02,190
...not the least of which is the fact
that we are privately held.

703
00:52:02,393 --> 00:52:06,022
We don't worry about the transparency
required of public companies.

704
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,793
Thank God, I was thinking
of sending out a search party.

705
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:11,348
I'm sorry. I overslept.

706
00:52:11,553 --> 00:52:12,906
You overslept.

707
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:15,581
The second great advantage
is that most of our clients...

708
00:52:15,793 --> 00:52:17,988
...are high-net-worth individuals
more concerned...

709
00:52:18,193 --> 00:52:22,550
...with preservation of capital than in
outsized gains in any single year...

710
00:52:22,753 --> 00:52:24,391
You all know
how to read a bar chart.

711
00:52:24,593 --> 00:52:27,585
What is important here
is putting your clients at ease.

712
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:30,830
One of the things I suggest
going forward in this difficult time...

713
00:52:31,033 --> 00:52:33,593
...the credit crunch,
whatever you want to call it...

714
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:35,988
...is that they understand
that America is on sale.

715
00:52:36,193 --> 00:52:38,229
Excuse me, sir, your wife is here.

716
00:52:42,153 --> 00:52:44,109
- It's Sharon.
- What about her?

717
00:52:44,313 --> 00:52:45,507
She's here.

718
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:46,702
Excuse me, Joe.

719
00:52:49,353 --> 00:52:53,232
At any rate, I want to make sure that
you can go with confidence and say...

720
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,824
Here's your wife, sir.

721
00:53:12,193 --> 00:53:14,946
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you woke up. I went to the spa.

722
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:16,268
What are you doing?

723
00:53:16,513 --> 00:53:18,185
I thought you'd need an excuse
to get out of there.

724
00:53:18,393 --> 00:53:19,826
- You wanna get some lunch?
- Lunch?

725
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,388
Yeah, it's gorgeous outside.
I made a reservation...

726
00:53:22,593 --> 00:53:24,231
Hey.

727
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:26,230
What do you think this is?

728
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:28,264
The morning after.

729
00:53:28,953 --> 00:53:30,625
We didn't do anything last night.

730
00:53:31,873 --> 00:53:33,386
You don't remember?

731
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:36,471
- Last night was perfect.
- Nothing happened!

732
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:39,346
Baby, not so loud.
It'll cause a scene.

733
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:40,747
A scene?

734
00:53:40,953 --> 00:53:43,183
Right. That's exactly what we need.

735
00:53:43,393 --> 00:53:45,623
- What are you doing?
- I wanna give you a scene.

736
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:48,791
I'll take you into Joe and the rest
so you can tell them all that...

737
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,029
- Why ruin this?
- There is no "this."

738
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:52,746
Don't say that.

739
00:53:52,953 --> 00:53:54,466
Goddamn it, come here.

740
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:01,512
What's wrong with you?

741
00:54:02,913 --> 00:54:04,505
Why are you acting like a stranger?

742
00:54:04,713 --> 00:54:08,786
That is exactly what I am to you, a
stranger, somebody you do not know.

743
00:54:09,473 --> 00:54:10,986
Now either you go in there...

744
00:54:11,193 --> 00:54:14,230
...and you tell them your lies,
or you leave me the hell alone.

745
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:18,868
Don't you put this all on me, Derek.

746
00:54:19,073 --> 00:54:22,065
We both knew what we were getting
into from the very beginning.

747
00:54:22,273 --> 00:54:23,308
What?

748
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:25,185
The first time we met in the elevator.

749
00:54:26,353 --> 00:54:27,468
Our dirty martini.

750
00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:30,142
The Christmas party.

751
00:54:30,753 --> 00:54:34,063
You said that you wished you were
single so that we could be together.

752
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:35,501
No. No, I did not.

753
00:54:35,713 --> 00:54:37,385
- You did! You said it!
- No! I did not!

754
00:54:37,873 --> 00:54:38,942
Derek, you said it.

755
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:40,632
You said it.

756
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:49,670
If I go in that room and tell them,
it'll be the truth.

757
00:54:50,713 --> 00:54:51,987
Is that what you want?

758
00:54:52,753 --> 00:54:55,665
You want me to tell them the truth?

759
00:54:58,793 --> 00:55:00,943
Ready when you are.

760
00:55:01,313 --> 00:55:03,304
Hey, hey.

761
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:05,188
Listen to me!

762
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,312
What are you doing?

763
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:12,142
Hit me. You can do
anything you want to me.

764
00:55:14,913 --> 00:55:16,141
You know what?

765
00:55:16,673 --> 00:55:20,461
It doesn't matter what you do or what
you say or what goes on in that brain...

766
00:55:20,673 --> 00:55:24,461
...because there's never gonna be
anything between us, never.

767
00:55:24,673 --> 00:55:25,901
Okay, Lisa?

768
00:55:26,113 --> 00:55:27,705
Derek.

769
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,392
Derek?

770
00:55:36,913 --> 00:55:38,426
Derek?

771
00:55:49,193 --> 00:55:50,626
I realise we went a little long.

772
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:53,870
I thought some of the questions you
raised were worth going over...

773
00:55:54,073 --> 00:55:55,825
...and I apologise for the length of it.

774
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:59,628
Those of you with tee times, and I
have one myself, we will still make...

775
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,551
Everything okay?

776
00:56:13,313 --> 00:56:15,269
- Top you off.
- Thank you.

777
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:18,071
- D?
- Oh, no, no, thanks.

778
00:56:18,273 --> 00:56:19,467
You're not drinking?

779
00:56:19,673 --> 00:56:22,710
No, not this evening, man.
I'm sticking to the iced tea.

780
00:56:25,153 --> 00:56:26,552
That's a first.

781
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:30,344
- You feeling all right?
- Yeah.

782
00:56:30,593 --> 00:56:32,072
He's just growing up.

783
00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:34,585
Man.

784
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:55,431
No goddamn way. Come on.
No. Hey. Hey, get up.

785
00:56:56,153 --> 00:56:58,064
Hey. Lisa.

786
00:56:58,273 --> 00:57:00,343
Come on, get up, get up.
You can't stay here.

787
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:03,021
Come on. I'll drag you out of here.
Let's...

788
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:08,151
No. No, no, no.

789
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:16,271
I need a paramedic up here at 583.
I have a woman in the room.

790
00:57:16,473 --> 00:57:19,033
I think she's overdosed on some sort
of prescription pills.

791
00:57:19,233 --> 00:57:20,791
Yeah, yeah. Hurry! Now, please!

792
00:57:20,993 --> 00:57:22,472
Okay.

793
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:26,703
Breathe. Breathe.

794
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:28,062
Bitch, breathe.

795
00:57:35,993 --> 00:57:38,553
- Derek. What's going on?
- I'll call you.

796
00:57:55,793 --> 00:57:56,748
Hello?

797
00:57:56,953 --> 00:57:58,545
Hi, Ben. It's Sharon.

798
00:57:58,753 --> 00:58:00,425
Hi, Sharon, hi.

799
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:02,225
<i>I'm sorry to disturb you.</i>

800
00:58:02,433 --> 00:58:05,186
I was trying to reach Derek,
and he usually calls me by now.

801
00:58:05,393 --> 00:58:07,190
I can't reach him on his cell phone.

802
00:58:07,393 --> 00:58:09,509
I was hoping he might be with you?

803
00:58:13,473 --> 00:58:17,261
Yeah, there... There was
a kind of incident.

804
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:18,952
Is he all right?

805
00:58:21,553 --> 00:58:22,827
Ben?

806
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:26,070
I think he should tell you himself.

807
00:58:27,313 --> 00:58:30,464
Ben, you're scaring me now.
Where is he?

808
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:37,751
Excuse me. Is she okay?

809
00:58:37,953 --> 00:58:40,421
The doctors are still working on her.

810
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:45,745
Derek. Oh, my God. I've been worried
out of my mind. Are you okay?

811
00:58:45,953 --> 00:58:49,104
What are you doing here? It's okay,
it's okay. I'm good, I'm good.

812
00:58:49,313 --> 00:58:50,985
- Where's Kyle?
- Julie is watching him.

813
00:58:51,193 --> 00:58:52,262
- What happened?
- Sharon.

814
00:58:52,473 --> 00:58:54,145
Mr. Charles. How you doing?

815
00:58:54,353 --> 00:58:56,947
My name is Monica Reese.
I'm the investigating detective.

816
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:59,428
- Detective?
- Yeah. This is my wife, Sharon.

817
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:02,067
- She just got here.
- So you haven't told her?

818
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:04,309
- What?
- Would you prefer to talk in private?

819
00:59:04,513 --> 00:59:08,791
- In private? What's happening, Derek?
- It's okay. Please, we can talk.

820
00:59:08,993 --> 00:59:12,190
I've gone over the initial statement
you gave to the police on the scene.

821
00:59:12,393 --> 00:59:14,623
I just need to clarify a few things,
okay?

822
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:16,312
Let's sit down.

823
00:59:20,193 --> 00:59:24,903
Detective Reese, 0300 hours,
January 15th.

824
00:59:26,913 --> 00:59:30,064
This young woman, Lisa Sheridan,
she works in your office?

825
00:59:30,273 --> 00:59:32,150
Lisa the temp?
What happened to her?

826
00:59:32,353 --> 00:59:33,706
Yeah, she tried to hurt herself.

827
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:35,665
Why? What? Well, what did she do?

828
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:37,750
Mrs. Charles, I'm sorry.

829
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:40,547
I need to get the story
in your husband's own words.

830
00:59:40,753 --> 00:59:41,822
Apparently, so do I.

831
00:59:43,073 --> 00:59:45,109
Mr. Charles, this Lisa Sheridan...

832
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:47,588
Yeah, she worked with us
two weeks.

833
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,749
What, you've only known her
for two weeks?

834
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:50,988
Approximately two weeks.

835
00:59:51,193 --> 00:59:54,390
Long enough for her to fantasize
that you two were having an affair?

836
00:59:54,593 --> 00:59:57,153
- What?
- No. No.

837
00:59:57,353 --> 01:00:00,231
She came on to me
at the Christmas party...

838
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:04,551
...and then in the parking garage.

839
01:00:04,753 --> 01:00:06,550
And then she showed up
at the retreat...

840
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:08,871
...at my hotel, and I rejected her.

841
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:11,985
And when... Excuse me.
And when you rejected her...

842
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:15,583
...she tried to commit suicide, naked,
in your bed, in your hotel room.

843
01:00:15,793 --> 01:00:19,388
Wait, wait, wait. She was naked
in your bed, Derek?

844
01:00:19,593 --> 01:00:21,982
- Mrs. Charles.
- She was naked in your hotel room?

845
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:23,182
Please.

846
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:25,987
- Would you say this affair was...
- There was no affair.

847
01:00:26,193 --> 01:00:27,626
There was no affair.

848
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,870
You're saying she made the thing up
in her head with no help from you?

849
01:00:31,073 --> 01:00:32,791
That is exactly what I'm saying.

850
01:00:32,993 --> 01:00:35,029
Why do you think she'd pick you?

851
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:39,021
I don't know. Maybe I said something
that she took the wrong way.

852
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:40,871
- Baby, come on.
- Like what? Like what?

853
01:00:41,073 --> 01:00:43,792
What exactly did you say
that she took the wrong way, Derek?

854
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:47,349
- I'm gonna have to ask you to le...
- No, no, she's not going anywhere.

855
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:50,909
I didn't say anything to her.
I did not lead her on.

856
01:00:51,113 --> 01:00:52,831
You had no idea she'd be
at the hotel?

857
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:54,546
I don't know how she got
in my room.

858
01:00:54,753 --> 01:00:58,382
She told the hotel clerk she was your
wife and she wanted to surprise you.

859
01:00:58,593 --> 01:01:00,504
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Stop, Sharon.

860
01:01:00,713 --> 01:01:03,625
- Did you have sex with her?
- No, I did not...

861
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,266
...have sex with her.

862
01:01:06,673 --> 01:01:09,585
Sharon, come on. I need for you and I
not to fall apart right now.

863
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:11,988
- Mr. Charles. Please.
- Hold on.

864
01:01:13,313 --> 01:01:16,464
Just stay here.
Please just stay here.

865
01:01:21,393 --> 01:01:23,748
Look, I don't care if you're doing
this girl or not.

866
01:01:23,953 --> 01:01:26,751
I'm not doing this girl, okay?
Never have.

867
01:01:26,953 --> 01:01:28,784
- Okay.
- Okay.

868
01:01:30,513 --> 01:01:31,502
Detective?

869
01:01:31,713 --> 01:01:33,829
It's the doctor. I'll be right back.

870
01:01:35,073 --> 01:01:36,142
Sharon.

871
01:01:36,353 --> 01:01:38,867
I swear to God
this is just a misunderstanding.

872
01:01:39,073 --> 01:01:40,301
A misunderstanding.

873
01:01:40,513 --> 01:01:44,222
A girl tries to kill herself because of
you, it's just a misunderstanding?

874
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:45,866
You think I'm gonna believe that?

875
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:47,984
- Do you believe me?
- No, I don't believe you!

876
01:01:48,193 --> 01:01:50,753
- You didn't even call your son back...
- Sharon, listen.

877
01:01:50,953 --> 01:01:53,023
Seems they pumped her out in time.

878
01:01:53,233 --> 01:01:55,508
Probably tomorrow they'll take her
out of the ICU...

879
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:59,103
...and take her up to the fifth floor
for psychiatric evaluation.

880
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:01,588
That's great news. Okay, thank you.

881
01:02:01,793 --> 01:02:05,581
She was lucid enough to give a name
to the doctor in case of emergencies.

882
01:02:13,153 --> 01:02:14,984
You still wanna stick to your story?

883
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:12,261
Sharon. Sharon,
you gonna talk to me?

884
01:03:12,473 --> 01:03:15,067
Thanks, Julie. I'll call you tomorrow.

885
01:03:15,273 --> 01:03:16,467
Sharon, is everything okay?

886
01:03:16,673 --> 01:03:18,743
Julie. Hey, thank you.

887
01:03:18,953 --> 01:03:20,432
Sharon.

888
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:24,352
Sharon.

889
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:26,751
Hey.

890
01:03:26,953 --> 01:03:28,306
Sharon.

891
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:30,707
Can we talk?

892
01:03:31,913 --> 01:03:34,711
Sharon, I just... Now listen,
Sharon, all I wanna do...

893
01:03:34,913 --> 01:03:37,746
What, what, what, Derek? What?
What do you want?

894
01:03:37,953 --> 01:03:39,989
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Now you wanna talk.

895
01:03:40,193 --> 01:03:43,026
- Sharon, you know me.
- No, I don't know you.

896
01:03:43,233 --> 01:03:45,906
I don't know you. I know the Derek
that told me everything.

897
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:48,627
- Oh, come on.
- But you? I have no idea who you are.

898
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:49,788
Sharon, I was wrong.

899
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:52,348
If I hadn't gone to the ER,
if I hadn't called Ben...

900
01:03:52,553 --> 01:03:54,066
...would you have even told me?

901
01:03:54,273 --> 01:03:56,150
What are you, crazy?
Of course I would have.

902
01:03:56,353 --> 01:03:58,423
Like you told me
about the Christmas party, huh?

903
01:03:58,633 --> 01:04:00,146
Or what about the parking garage?

904
01:04:00,353 --> 01:04:03,663
Yes, you told me about you being
in a parking garage with this woman.

905
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,465
What else haven't you told me,
Derek?

906
01:04:05,673 --> 01:04:07,664
All I'm hearing
are things you haven't told me.

907
01:04:07,873 --> 01:04:10,262
I was wrong. I should've told you
the truth from the...

908
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:12,065
You should have! Why didn't you?

909
01:04:12,273 --> 01:04:14,992
Because I didn't think
it was a big deal in the first place...

910
01:04:15,193 --> 01:04:16,467
...and then I was embarrassed.

911
01:04:16,673 --> 01:04:20,461
- How do I say it without looking...?
- Guilty? Guilty?

912
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:24,712
I'm your wife, Derek. You're supposed
to trust me. You let this happen.

913
01:04:25,753 --> 01:04:26,947
You think I encouraged this?

914
01:04:27,153 --> 01:04:31,226
Don't give me that innocent bullshit.
I was there at your desk. I saw you.

915
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:33,993
I saw how you played games
and you played those girls...

916
01:04:34,193 --> 01:04:37,071
...but you never did that to me.
Until now.

917
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:41,142
What is this? Is this about me
wanting to go to school?

918
01:04:41,353 --> 01:04:42,866
God, Sharon, it is not like that.

919
01:04:43,073 --> 01:04:45,462
This woman is sick, okay?
Nothing happened between...

920
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,312
Do I ever ask you for anything?
I don't ask you for anything.

921
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:50,026
All I asked you was to be honest.

922
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:51,427
- I told you the truth!
- No.

923
01:04:51,633 --> 01:04:52,952
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

924
01:04:54,233 --> 01:04:57,305
- I told you the truth.
- No, you didn't. You lied.

925
01:04:57,513 --> 01:04:59,583
We made a vow
on our wedding day...

926
01:04:59,793 --> 01:05:02,227
...that we would tell each other
everything.

927
01:05:02,753 --> 01:05:05,904
No matter how ugly
or uncomfortable it might be.

928
01:05:08,353 --> 01:05:11,265
I specifically asked you,
"Did anything happen at that party?"

929
01:05:11,473 --> 01:05:12,872
And what did you tell me?

930
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:14,745
- You said no.
- I know.

931
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,944
- I don't know what to believe right now.
- Okay.

932
01:05:17,153 --> 01:05:18,108
Hey, hey, hey.

933
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,781
I think I need to be alone.
I think I need to be alone.

934
01:05:20,993 --> 01:05:22,984
Stop, stop, stop. Okay?

935
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:25,184
Come on. Sharon. Please?

936
01:05:25,913 --> 01:05:28,143
- Sharon, come on.
- Get out of my house!

937
01:05:28,353 --> 01:05:31,186
This is crazy, Sharon!
Don't you see what's happening?

938
01:05:31,393 --> 01:05:32,951
Get out of my house.

939
01:05:40,193 --> 01:05:42,070
Nothing happened with this...

940
01:05:44,513 --> 01:05:46,071
Okay. You know what?

941
01:05:46,273 --> 01:05:49,743
You just tell me what you want me
to do and that's what I'll do!

942
01:05:49,953 --> 01:05:52,308
Well, first, I suggest you pack
your toothbrush.

943
01:05:52,513 --> 01:05:55,550
Then I want you to get your socks,
your shaving kit, your underwear...

944
01:05:55,753 --> 01:05:58,062
...your prophylactics, if
you need them, and get out!

945
01:05:58,273 --> 01:06:00,309
- And go where, Sharon?
- To hell.

946
01:06:01,113 --> 01:06:04,150
But until then,
I suggest maybe the Four Seasons.

947
01:06:09,073 --> 01:06:10,586
Sharon!

948
01:06:24,993 --> 01:06:26,221
Miss Sheridan?

949
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:30,305
Hey, I'm Monica Reese.
I'm a detective assigned to your case.

950
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,425
- Come in.
- Thanks.

951
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:36,382
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

952
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:39,903
They won't let me take a shower
or wash my hair.

953
01:06:40,113 --> 01:06:42,752
Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.

954
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:48,144
So you feel like talking
about the other night?

955
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:50,701
Have you spoken to Derek?

956
01:06:50,913 --> 01:06:52,141
Yeah.

957
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:54,152
And he's all right?

958
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,549
Relatively speaking.

959
01:06:56,753 --> 01:06:58,311
When can I see him?

960
01:06:58,513 --> 01:07:01,107
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

961
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:03,986
- Why?
- Miss, I don't mean to upset you...

962
01:07:04,193 --> 01:07:07,026
...but I don't think Mr. Charles
wants to speak to you...

963
01:07:07,233 --> 01:07:10,350
...or continue any kind of contact.

964
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:13,064
Then why did he send me these?

965
01:07:16,513 --> 01:07:18,071
He sent you flowers?

966
01:07:18,673 --> 01:07:21,585
Lilies. My favourite.

967
01:07:21,793 --> 01:07:22,748
Beautiful.

968
01:07:27,473 --> 01:07:28,952
Yeah.

969
01:07:31,793 --> 01:07:35,229
Miss Sheridan, could you tell me
what happened at the hotel?

970
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:37,389
- Why you were there?
- Didn't Derek tell you?

971
01:07:37,593 --> 01:07:41,029
Yeah, but I'd really like
to get your version.

972
01:07:41,913 --> 01:07:44,063
Well, there's not much to tell.

973
01:07:45,113 --> 01:07:47,991
He asked me to meet him
at the hotel.

974
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:49,672
And you agreed?

975
01:07:50,113 --> 01:07:51,671
Of course.

976
01:07:51,873 --> 01:07:53,226
And then what happened?

977
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:56,547
I think you can guess what we did.

978
01:07:57,233 --> 01:07:59,189
Yeah. You... You slept together.

979
01:07:59,393 --> 01:08:00,621
Yes.

980
01:08:01,793 --> 01:08:03,306
Well, Derek denies it, so...

981
01:08:05,113 --> 01:08:07,343
He's just trying to protect me.

982
01:08:08,273 --> 01:08:09,422
He's being a gentleman.

983
01:08:10,113 --> 01:08:11,228
Right.

984
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:16,791
The next day, he told me that his wife
wouldn't give him a divorce.

985
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:19,109
You know the kind of woman
that will never let go?

986
01:08:19,313 --> 01:08:20,951
Yeah.

987
01:08:21,153 --> 01:08:23,348
Then he said
that we couldn't see each other.

988
01:08:24,193 --> 01:08:25,911
I overreacted.

989
01:08:26,593 --> 01:08:29,665
I didn't realise at the time
that he was just being noble.

990
01:08:30,433 --> 01:08:33,266
Noble? What do you mean, "noble"?

991
01:08:33,473 --> 01:08:36,670
He was thinking about his little boy,
Kyle.

992
01:08:36,873 --> 01:08:38,864
What the break-up would do to him.

993
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:43,301
Lisa. Can I call you Lisa?

994
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,386
Yeah.

995
01:08:45,593 --> 01:08:47,663
How would you, you know...

996
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:51,343
...characterise your relationship
with Derek?

997
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:54,069
- Lovers.
- Yeah, I got that.

998
01:08:54,273 --> 01:08:58,391
But I mean, do you really believe
he's in love with you?

999
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,470
I'm not a home wrecker.

1000
01:09:02,273 --> 01:09:06,061
Monica, I'm not stealing him away.
Their marriage is over.

1001
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:12,385
I do feel bad about his wife, though.

1002
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:14,186
Well, how so?

1003
01:09:14,393 --> 01:09:15,826
Well, it can't be easy...

1004
01:09:16,033 --> 01:09:19,503
...to find out that your husband's
in love with someone else.

1005
01:09:19,713 --> 01:09:21,431
Right.

1006
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:24,788
I just hope that she doesn't do
something stupid.

1007
01:09:27,393 --> 01:09:29,748
I don't have to tell you the impact
this could have.

1008
01:09:29,953 --> 01:09:32,945
- Even a whiff of impropriety.
- Impropriety. There is no impropriety!

1009
01:09:33,153 --> 01:09:35,906
This is just a sick fantasy
from a very disturbed girl.

1010
01:09:36,113 --> 01:09:38,547
Who might retaliate
with a sexual harassment lawsuit.

1011
01:09:38,753 --> 01:09:40,550
I was the one
who was sexually harassed.

1012
01:09:40,753 --> 01:09:43,825
I can't believe this is happening
to me. This is like a nightmare.

1013
01:09:44,033 --> 01:09:46,149
By now you're probably wishing
you had banged her.

1014
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,230
Goddamn it, Joe!

1015
01:09:49,593 --> 01:09:53,142
Derek, calm down. I believe you,
and I'll back you all the way on this.

1016
01:09:53,353 --> 01:09:55,344
If we find out
there was something going on...

1017
01:09:55,553 --> 01:09:57,544
That's not gonna happen.
There's nothing.

1018
01:09:57,753 --> 01:10:00,631
Good. Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

1019
01:10:01,233 --> 01:10:04,828
- I'm putting Ben on the Ganz account.
- No. Ganz is my client...

1020
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:05,988
- Look...
- No, Joe.

1021
01:10:06,193 --> 01:10:07,706
I'm not losing my client over this.

1022
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:11,588
Take a little time off, just until
this blows over. Focus on Sharon.

1023
01:10:11,793 --> 01:10:13,067
Oh, Jesus.

1024
01:10:14,353 --> 01:10:15,672
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1025
01:10:15,873 --> 01:10:18,387
Derek, there's a Detective Reese here
to see you.

1026
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:22,222
<i>Come on.
You think I sent her flowers?</i>

1027
01:10:22,433 --> 01:10:26,506
My assistant has all my personal
information in his computer.

1028
01:10:27,073 --> 01:10:29,906
She must have accessed them
when she temped for me.

1029
01:10:32,193 --> 01:10:36,345
This is Lisa's journal.
It's a sort of diary, I guess...

1030
01:10:36,553 --> 01:10:38,271
...that she was keeping.
- Okay.

1031
01:10:38,473 --> 01:10:40,782
It's a rather graphic
and detailed account...

1032
01:10:40,993 --> 01:10:44,508
...of your various sexual liaisons
together.

1033
01:10:44,713 --> 01:10:47,386
- My what?
- I have to warn you, it's...

1034
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,232
"We..."

1035
01:11:01,233 --> 01:11:02,871
This is bullshit.

1036
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:05,907
None of this happened.
I've never been to her apartment.

1037
01:11:06,113 --> 01:11:07,626
I've never touched her.

1038
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:11,587
Well, according to these entries,
you are quite the accomplished lover.

1039
01:11:11,793 --> 01:11:15,229
Oh, and apparently,
you made some promises to her.

1040
01:11:15,433 --> 01:11:17,025
Promises to divorce your wife and...

1041
01:11:17,233 --> 01:11:19,463
Okay, detective.

1042
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:21,345
You seem smart.

1043
01:11:22,073 --> 01:11:23,586
You can't possibly believe that.

1044
01:11:23,793 --> 01:11:27,183
Look, the only thing that matters
is that she believes this.

1045
01:11:27,393 --> 01:11:30,783
So there has to be something I can do
to protect myself, right? My family?

1046
01:11:30,993 --> 01:11:33,302
Sure.
You could file a restraining order.

1047
01:11:33,513 --> 01:11:34,582
Let's do that.

1048
01:11:34,793 --> 01:11:36,670
- But that might not be necessary.
- Why not?

1049
01:11:36,873 --> 01:11:39,182
Because Lisa's sister flew down
from San Francisco...

1050
01:11:39,393 --> 01:11:42,146
...and took Lisa back with her
earlier today.

1051
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:48,384
I can't say I'm unhappy to hear that.

1052
01:11:49,553 --> 01:11:52,067
Maybe now she'll get the help
that she needs.

1053
01:13:33,473 --> 01:13:36,112
You ready? Let's go for it.

1054
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:40,622
- Hey.
- Kyle. Hey, baby.

1055
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,949
It's my birthday next week.

1056
01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:02,792
Happy birthday.

1057
01:14:04,993 --> 01:14:07,507
Sharon, are you gonna make me
spend my birthday alone?

1058
01:14:13,473 --> 01:14:15,429
Have dinner with me?

1059
01:14:18,073 --> 01:14:19,665
Come on, Sharon.

1060
01:14:22,153 --> 01:14:23,984
Move your foot, Derek.

1061
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:54,307
What do you think?

1062
01:14:55,553 --> 01:14:56,781
Be honest.

1063
01:15:02,113 --> 01:15:04,388
Derek, your menu. Your menu.

1064
01:15:04,593 --> 01:15:07,061
- Oh, my menu, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1065
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:14,144
Sharon, this means a lot to me.

1066
01:15:15,873 --> 01:15:16,988
I missed you.

1067
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:20,742
And, I don't know, there's just so much
I wanna tell you.

1068
01:15:21,153 --> 01:15:23,109
It's your party, birthday boy.

1069
01:15:28,593 --> 01:15:29,582
You look beautiful.

1070
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,546
I love you.

1071
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:36,104
Sharon, I just wanna be home.

1072
01:15:36,593 --> 01:15:38,185
Okay, it's been three months.

1073
01:15:38,393 --> 01:15:43,421
And I'll do whatever it takes to fix this,
to make us work again...

1074
01:15:43,633 --> 01:15:46,591
...your studies, you and Kyle,
I mean...

1075
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:49,182
...you name it, I'll do it.

1076
01:15:57,673 --> 01:15:59,186
I got you something.

1077
01:16:01,873 --> 01:16:03,511
- Should I just...?
- No.

1078
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:07,301
Let's see how
the rest of the evening goes.

1079
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:10,986
<i>And welcome to "Fact or Fiction."</i>

1080
01:16:11,193 --> 01:16:13,661
<i>I'm your host, Rod Bak er.</i>

1081
01:16:13,953 --> 01:16:18,504
<i>And on today's show, let's welcome
back our champion, Bunny!</i>

1082
01:16:33,993 --> 01:16:36,143
Hi. I'm Sharon's friend, Kate.

1083
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:37,982
You're...?

1084
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:41,465
Samantha. Mrs. Charles is at dinner.

1085
01:16:41,673 --> 01:16:44,346
Sharon told me to drop by.
I have this present for Kyle.

1086
01:16:44,553 --> 01:16:45,906
I'm just gonna run it up to him.

1087
01:16:46,113 --> 01:16:47,512
Oh, you can't, he's sleeping.

1088
01:16:47,713 --> 01:16:48,668
I won't wake him.

1089
01:16:48,873 --> 01:16:50,625
Maybe you should come back
another time.

1090
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,425
But I'm here now.

1091
01:16:52,633 --> 01:16:54,112
I...

1092
01:16:54,793 --> 01:16:57,910
I get it, you're just doing your job.
Good.

1093
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,104
Do you need me to call Sharon?

1094
01:17:00,593 --> 01:17:01,708
Yeah.

1095
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:03,665
Okay.

1096
01:17:11,153 --> 01:17:13,621
Sharon. Hey, it's Kate.

1097
01:17:14,473 --> 01:17:17,829
Where am I? I'm at your house,
of course. You told me to drop by.

1098
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:19,422
She forgot.

1099
01:17:20,793 --> 01:17:22,829
No, Samantha just wanted me
to give you a call.

1100
01:17:23,033 --> 01:17:24,466
She was a little bit concerned.

1101
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:28,632
No. No, no, no.
Don't be upset with her.

1102
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:31,825
No, God, come on,
she was just doing her job.

1103
01:17:32,793 --> 01:17:35,910
Great. All right, have an
amazing dinner. Tell Derek I said hi.

1104
01:17:36,113 --> 01:17:37,466
Oh, Sharon, hold on.

1105
01:17:37,673 --> 01:17:39,072
Do you need to talk to her?

1106
01:17:39,273 --> 01:17:40,786
No, no, I'm fine.

1107
01:17:41,433 --> 01:17:44,630
All right, I'll catch up with you
in the morning. Bye, honey.

1108
01:17:45,673 --> 01:17:47,026
I'll be back in a sec.

1109
01:17:47,873 --> 01:17:48,862
Yeah.

1110
01:18:06,753 --> 01:18:10,587
Sharon, you know,
I miss you and I love you...

1111
01:18:10,793 --> 01:18:12,863
...and I know that you miss me too.

1112
01:18:15,513 --> 01:18:18,869
I do miss you, but I don't know
if that's enough.

1113
01:18:25,673 --> 01:18:27,345
We're not talking about divorce,
right?

1114
01:18:27,553 --> 01:18:30,067
I don't come from a family of divorce.

1115
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:33,424
Mom and Dad'll be celebrating their
30th anniversary in three months.

1116
01:18:34,273 --> 01:18:36,468
I look at them and I wonder
if that can ever be us.

1117
01:18:36,673 --> 01:18:39,824
It is us. It can be us, will be us.

1118
01:18:51,913 --> 01:18:54,905
I need you to understand
that nothing happened with that girl.

1119
01:18:55,113 --> 01:18:59,550
I know I should've been honest
with you from the beginning...

1120
01:18:59,753 --> 01:19:01,345
...and I wasn't.

1121
01:19:02,513 --> 01:19:04,788
And that will never happen again.

1122
01:19:05,313 --> 01:19:06,871
But I love you.

1123
01:19:07,073 --> 01:19:11,032
I mean, I love you with all my heart,
and I love my son too.

1124
01:19:17,193 --> 01:19:18,831
I guess Kyle does miss his daddy.

1125
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:22,548
Does Sharon... miss Daddy?

1126
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:26,712
I will do anything, anything.

1127
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,743
- Anything?
- You name it.

1128
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:35,791
Oh, I guess the evening's
going good.

1129
01:19:39,273 --> 01:19:40,991
What about the Benz?

1130
01:19:42,353 --> 01:19:44,389
- The Benz.
- My Benz?

1131
01:19:44,593 --> 01:19:47,824
I just... Oh, yes.
I got that key right here.

1132
01:19:49,033 --> 01:19:50,591
You know, it's...

1133
01:19:54,993 --> 01:19:55,982
Missed you.

1134
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:12,381
See you later!

1135
01:20:12,593 --> 01:20:13,867
You too!

1136
01:20:28,513 --> 01:20:29,866
Okay, it works, it works.

1137
01:20:30,073 --> 01:20:32,348
Welcome home, baby.

1138
01:20:33,353 --> 01:20:34,502
You driving my car.

1139
01:20:34,713 --> 01:20:37,386
- You guys got back so fast.
- Hey.

1140
01:20:37,593 --> 01:20:38,628
Any trouble with Kyle?

1141
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:41,427
No, he was a doll.
But you just missed your friend.

1142
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:43,703
- What friend?
- You know, your friend Kate?

1143
01:20:43,913 --> 01:20:44,868
I don't know a Kate.

1144
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:46,825
She was here.
She had something for Kyle.

1145
01:20:47,033 --> 01:20:48,466
Oh, my God! Where's Kyle?

1146
01:20:48,673 --> 01:20:50,470
- His crib.
- Somebody was inside the house?

1147
01:20:50,673 --> 01:20:52,186
- Yeah.
- How long were they here for?

1148
01:20:52,393 --> 01:20:55,988
Just a few minutes. What's wrong?
You said it was okay!

1149
01:20:56,193 --> 01:20:57,387
Kyle?

1150
01:20:58,873 --> 01:20:59,988
She took my baby.

1151
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:02,229
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1152
01:21:03,673 --> 01:21:04,788
What happened? Tell me.

1153
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:07,348
She said she had something for Kyle
and then she left.

1154
01:21:07,553 --> 01:21:09,589
She left? Kyle's not in his room!

1155
01:21:09,793 --> 01:21:11,624
Call 911! Now!

1156
01:21:12,593 --> 01:21:14,185
Kyle?

1157
01:21:21,953 --> 01:21:23,944
Kyle?

1158
01:21:24,153 --> 01:21:27,589
Kyle? Son?

1159
01:21:31,073 --> 01:21:32,745
Kyle!

1160
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:40,742
Oh, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

1161
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,191
Kyle, oh.

1162
01:21:48,673 --> 01:21:52,029
She couldn't have got far.
She couldn't have got far.

1163
01:22:03,713 --> 01:22:05,988
We'll wait for the blood work.
It appears he's fine.

1164
01:22:06,193 --> 01:22:08,423
I don't see any reason
why you can't take him home.

1165
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,544
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

1166
01:22:13,873 --> 01:22:15,306
Hey.

1167
01:22:15,913 --> 01:22:17,346
How's he doing?

1168
01:22:17,553 --> 01:22:18,952
Doctor says he's fine.

1169
01:22:19,153 --> 01:22:22,862
Well, I'm not fine.
She was in our house.

1170
01:22:23,073 --> 01:22:24,984
And now our son
is in a hospital bed.

1171
01:22:25,193 --> 01:22:27,502
You said she was in San Francisco.
Why is she back?

1172
01:22:27,713 --> 01:22:29,431
And how did she even know
we'd be out?

1173
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:31,225
Obviously she was watching
your house.

1174
01:22:31,433 --> 01:22:32,786
We need you to find her.

1175
01:22:32,993 --> 01:22:35,063
I will do everything in my power
to find her.

1176
01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:37,582
One of you better do something
about this woman.

1177
01:22:38,593 --> 01:22:39,992
Or I will.

1178
01:22:43,553 --> 01:22:45,191
So, what am I supposed to do now?

1179
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:46,826
- Buy a gun?
- Please.

1180
01:22:47,033 --> 01:22:48,591
We'll have our unit tracking her.

1181
01:22:48,793 --> 01:22:51,261
In the meantime, you better beef up
your security system.

1182
01:22:51,473 --> 01:22:54,067
She could have hurt my son.
My son.

1183
01:23:14,793 --> 01:23:17,261
Okay. You don't wanna go to sleep?

1184
01:23:17,473 --> 01:23:19,350
- Kyle. It's okay, baby.
- It's okay.

1185
01:23:21,193 --> 01:23:22,706
Oh, no.

1186
01:23:22,913 --> 01:23:25,302
Oh, no. God.

1187
01:23:27,353 --> 01:23:28,866
Jesus.

1188
01:23:29,753 --> 01:23:31,311
This psycho.

1189
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:32,707
She never left.

1190
01:23:44,513 --> 01:23:47,983
Yeah, I need to speak
to Detective Reese immediately.

1191
01:23:48,193 --> 01:23:49,990
My name, Derek Charles.

1192
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:51,871
Yeah, she knows me.

1193
01:23:52,073 --> 01:23:54,029
This is an emergency.
I need to speak to her.

1194
01:23:54,233 --> 01:23:58,670
<i>Hi, it's Lisa, sorry you missed me.
Leave me a message after the beep.</i>

1195
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:03,428
You listen to me.
You know exactly who this is.

1196
01:24:04,073 --> 01:24:07,827
You came into my house,
you touched my child...

1197
01:24:08,753 --> 01:24:10,789
...and you think you're crazy?

1198
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:12,312
I'll show you crazy.

1199
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:14,907
Just try me, bitch!

1200
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:21,672
You're set. You ready for me
to show you how the system works?

1201
01:24:21,873 --> 01:24:23,511
Definitely.

1202
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:27,822
Simple.

1203
01:24:28,033 --> 01:24:31,184
You just punch in your code,
now it's armed.

1204
01:24:31,393 --> 01:24:34,783
Case of an emergency,
this is the panic button.

1205
01:24:34,993 --> 01:24:37,666
You touch this,
the police are knocking at your door.

1206
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:39,750
There's also one in your master.

1207
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:57,990
Okay, so you packed everything?

1208
01:25:58,193 --> 01:25:59,262
What time you taking off?

1209
01:25:59,473 --> 01:26:03,352
This afternoon after I pick Kyle up
from my sister's.

1210
01:26:03,553 --> 01:26:05,111
- Okay, well, drive safely.
- Okay.

1211
01:26:05,313 --> 01:26:07,144
- I'll be there in the morning.
- All right.

1212
01:26:07,353 --> 01:26:09,184
- Set the alarm.
- You don't have to tell me.

1213
01:26:09,393 --> 01:26:10,985
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1214
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:13,991
Bye.

1215
01:26:21,713 --> 01:26:22,987
Derek Charles's office.

1216
01:26:23,193 --> 01:26:24,308
<i>Patrick.</i>

1217
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:27,505
Lisa? Oh, my God, it's been forever.

1218
01:26:27,713 --> 01:26:29,351
What, like six months?

1219
01:26:29,553 --> 01:26:32,351
<i>I know. We've got a lot of gossip
to catch up on.</i>

1220
01:26:32,553 --> 01:26:36,341
Well, I'm not supposed to talk to you.
I could get fired.

1221
01:26:36,553 --> 01:26:38,669
<i>Trust me, you're not getting fired.</i>

1222
01:26:38,873 --> 01:26:39,908
What do you mean?

1223
01:26:40,113 --> 01:26:41,751
<i>Derek didn't tell you.</i>

1224
01:26:42,873 --> 01:26:44,147
Tell me what?

1225
01:26:44,353 --> 01:26:46,389
<i>He's leaving Sharon.
They're getting a div orce.</i>

1226
01:26:46,593 --> 01:26:49,266
<i>- A divorce?
- Lik e that's a surprise.</i>

1227
01:26:49,473 --> 01:26:52,192
Look, that's not gonna happen, Lisa.

1228
01:26:52,393 --> 01:26:54,588
<i>Patrick, come on.
I know what I'm talking about.</i>

1229
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:58,672
Then why are they driving to San
Diego for her parents' anniversary?

1230
01:26:58,873 --> 01:27:00,352
<i>Derek's not going.</i>

1231
01:27:00,553 --> 01:27:02,669
Yeah, actually, he is.

1232
01:27:02,873 --> 01:27:05,990
Sharon's leaving this afternoon,
Derek's driving down in the morning.

1233
01:27:07,873 --> 01:27:09,829
Lisa? Did you hear me?

1234
01:27:10,033 --> 01:27:11,022
<i>Patrick, I have to go.</i>

1235
01:27:11,233 --> 01:27:12,461
No, you just called.

1236
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:47,508
My purse.

1237
01:28:52,753 --> 01:28:55,108
Joe needs these by 5.

1238
01:28:55,313 --> 01:28:57,827
- Yeah. Sharon's on one.
- Okay.

1239
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:03,347
- Hey.
- Hey, baby, I just left the house.

1240
01:29:03,553 --> 01:29:06,067
- Okay, good. You set the alarm?
- The ala...

1241
01:29:06,273 --> 01:29:07,911
Oh, God, I forgot.

1242
01:29:08,113 --> 01:29:10,388
Don't worry. I'm gonna get out soon.
I'll do it.

1243
01:29:10,593 --> 01:29:14,222
No. I'm just down the hill. I'll swing
back around, and I'll call you after.

1244
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:16,264
Hey. Call me back.

1245
01:31:14,913 --> 01:31:16,505
Did you not get my message?

1246
01:31:16,713 --> 01:31:20,342
I'm so sorry. We didn't want you
to find out this way.

1247
01:31:21,873 --> 01:31:23,431
I knew it would come to this.

1248
01:31:23,633 --> 01:31:28,787
I know how hard it must be to have
someone fall out of love with you.

1249
01:31:28,993 --> 01:31:30,472
I know.

1250
01:31:32,993 --> 01:31:35,109
You are completely delusional.

1251
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:38,712
I'm gonna have the cops
deal with your crazy ass.

1252
01:31:38,913 --> 01:31:41,427
- Wait, it doesn't...
- Don't touch me.

1253
01:31:42,313 --> 01:31:45,589
- We can talk.
- I told you, don't touch me!

1254
01:31:54,033 --> 01:31:55,830
Crazy!

1255
01:31:56,353 --> 01:31:57,468
Get off of me!

1256
01:32:22,033 --> 01:32:24,024
<i>You have reached
the Charles Residence.</i>

1257
01:32:24,593 --> 01:32:26,026
Sharon.

1258
01:32:26,233 --> 01:32:27,586
Are you there?

1259
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:33,146
- Derek.
- Lisa?

1260
01:32:33,353 --> 01:32:35,867
<i>What are you doing in my house?</i>

1261
01:32:36,073 --> 01:32:37,506
Sharon.

1262
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:39,991
Sharon?

1263
01:32:41,193 --> 01:32:43,343
Derek, I'm gonna call you back.

1264
01:32:51,073 --> 01:32:53,428
I need to speak to Detective
Reese, right now, please.

1265
01:32:53,633 --> 01:32:55,589
Yeah. No, it's an emergency.

1266
01:32:56,833 --> 01:32:57,902
Come here, bitch.

1267
01:32:59,393 --> 01:33:01,907
I'm gonna wipe the floor
with your little skinny ass.

1268
01:33:02,113 --> 01:33:05,310
Oh, you want to hold on?
You screaming now, huh?

1269
01:33:12,673 --> 01:33:14,391
Come here!

1270
01:33:14,593 --> 01:33:17,471
Didn't I tell you not
to come to my house?

1271
01:33:17,673 --> 01:33:19,186
Nobody touches my child.

1272
01:33:54,273 --> 01:33:56,343
Come on. Come here!

1273
01:36:08,113 --> 01:36:09,751
Come on, this what you want?

1274
01:36:09,953 --> 01:36:11,830
Come on.

1275
01:36:25,153 --> 01:36:26,472
Come a little closer.

1276
01:36:28,433 --> 01:36:29,627
You almost got it, come on.

1277
01:36:30,273 --> 01:36:31,945
Come on.

1278
01:36:39,633 --> 01:36:41,942
You want some of me?
You almost got me.

1279
01:36:46,753 --> 01:36:47,981
Come on, bitch.

1280
01:37:17,953 --> 01:37:19,511
Take my hand.

1281
01:37:19,713 --> 01:37:21,351
Come on, take my hand.

1282
01:37:23,393 --> 01:37:24,508
I got you.

1283
01:37:30,913 --> 01:37:32,505
Come on, come on.

1284
01:37:36,273 --> 01:37:37,752
Crazy bitch.

1285
01:37:54,033 --> 01:37:55,751
Get off of me.

1286
01:38:29,233 --> 01:38:30,712
Oh, God.

1287
01:38:58,033 --> 01:38:59,830
Oh, God.

1288
01:39:46,553 --> 01:39:48,191
Sharon? You all right?

1289
01:39:50,033 --> 01:39:51,102
What happened here?

1290
01:39:51,313 --> 01:39:53,349
I think you know what happened.

1291
01:39:55,313 --> 01:39:57,065
Stay here.

1292
01:39:58,273 --> 01:40:00,787
- Oh, baby.
- You okay?

1293
01:40:02,273 --> 01:40:04,912
- It's over.
- It's over.
