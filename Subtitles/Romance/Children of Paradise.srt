595
00:00:01,077 --> 00:00:02,874
Listen, Baptiste.

596
00:00:02,946 --> 00:00:05,073
I should have told you sooner.

597
00:00:05,148 --> 00:00:07,810
That woman is Garance.

598
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:12,219
She's back, but not for long.

599
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:16,153
She'd like to see you,
you understand?

600
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,613
What's wrong?

601
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:33,800
Good evening, my angel.

602
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:36,532
- Pierre-François!
- Who?

603
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,800
Ah, yes, Pierre-François.

604
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,242
Forgive me. I lose track
of all the names I use.

605
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:45,706
A childish precaution.
The police are so inept.

606
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:49,242
Unlike me.
I am well informed.

607
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,879
For example,
I knew about your return at once.

608
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:55,618
I learned where you were living,
and with whom.

609
00:01:56,626 --> 00:01:58,321
Nothing escapes you.

610
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:02,694
And I know they've put
my angel in a gilded cage.

611
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:04,461
I'm not throwing stones.

612
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:08,163
I've been in prison myself lately,
and in the provinces!

613
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:13,038
Not even a hint of a smile?
I used to amuse you.

614
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,138
Have you lost your gaiety,
or it so unpleasant to see me?

615
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:22,341
On the contrary,
I'm glad to see you.

616
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:25,750
- Yes, it reminds me of--
- An entire era!

617
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,847
Yes, the easy years,

618
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:32,027
the happy days, the good life.

619
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:34,290
Never look back at the past,
my angel.

620
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:37,765
It leaps at your throat
like a mad dog.

621
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:40,029
Still, fortunately, I was happy.

622
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:42,095
- Despite all.
- Back then.

623
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:45,664
Don't be silly.
Then as now.

624
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:47,573
Time has nothing to do
with happiness.

625
00:02:47,644 --> 00:02:50,511
Really?
And the man in white?

626
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,515
Do you think your friend,
the mime, is happy?

627
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:57,614
To think I had
the absurd notion of killing him.

628
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:59,746
Comical, no?

629
00:02:59,823 --> 00:03:02,951
One might as well stab
at a breeze or a moon beam.

630
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:06,051
And the other one: Frédérick.

631
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:08,330
I considered him too, my angel.

632
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:11,367
I even called on him
on an amusing pretext.

633
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:13,095
Which was?

634
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:16,935
To ask this complete stranger
for money. He'd refuse and--

635
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:20,533
- And he gave it to you?
- A large sum. Amazing!

636
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:23,137
Unselfish people still exist.

637
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,238
People!

638
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:29,149
Actors aren't people.
They're every man and no man.

639
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,813
People of high society:
Those are people!

640
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,518
Like Count de Montray,
one of France's richest notables.

641
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:41,192
- You've changed, Pierre-François.
- Have I?

642
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,290
Yes. You used to speak of yourself,
rarely of others.

643
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:48,433
But what's become of you?

644
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:51,036
I've become famous.

645
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:53,507
Yes, a few sensational crimes.

646
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:56,704
The name Lacenaire has been
in the crime columns.

647
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:59,543
Hunted by police in the provinces,

648
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,484
while he is here in Paris
with his guardian angel.

649
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:07,645
- You're a celebrity.
- I'm becoming one.

650
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:11,490
But upon reflection,
I'd have preferred literary success.

651
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:13,886
Never satisfied, Pierre-François.

652
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:18,195
They say the count
is a generous patron of the arts.

653
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,993
I'd enjoy meeting him.

654
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,633
- Do you really need to?
- Don't worry.

655
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,769
It's just to meet the man
who laid the icy hand of wealth

656
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:30,005
on the pale shoulder of my angel.

657
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,282
There were no strings attached.

658
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,250
I'm still free.

659
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:41,082
Perhaps.
That's what bothers me.

660
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,829
It's so painful to see you again,

661
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,221
and find you unchanged.

662
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:53,267
I'd prefer to find you
ravaged, submissive,

663
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,099
rendered stupid bywealth.

664
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:58,865
Then I could have lived
with an easy conscience,

665
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,604
and my fine idea of mankind.

666
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:04,105
My poor Pierre-François!

667
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,444
You think I'm a monster,
don't you?

668
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:11,219
Possibly,
but you're not the only one.

669
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,652
Alas.

670
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,214
- Edouard de Montray, I presume?
- In person.

671
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,485
I was so anxious to meet you.

672
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:52,790
- And now I have. I'm delighted.
- How amusing.

673
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,562
Amusing and unexpected.
And to whom--

674
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:59,123
No one.
It's ofno importance.

675
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:03,866
You do realize that I find
your manner most distasteful.

676
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:06,241
Who are you, Monsieur?

677
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:10,144
Is it not absurd to ask people
who they are?

678
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:13,649
- Excuse me?
- That's why they're so evasive.

679
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,678
They give you the easy reply:
a name, a title.

680
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,356
But who they are really,

681
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:23,151
who they are deep down,

682
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:26,457
they conceal with great care.

683
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:30,727
- You speak for yourself.
- No, everyone. You as well.

684
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,667
I find your ways quite indiscreet.

685
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,328
You don't know me,
yet you ask who I am. The gall!

686
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,932
Enough.
Where can my seconds--

687
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:45,037
Pointless! I'm not a man who duels.
Absolutely not!

688
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,605
That explains things in part.

689
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:51,119
Or if I do,
the choice of arms is always mine.

690
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:54,390
I choose one, just one,

691
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:58,282
and I keep one for me, on me,

692
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:01,219
and I kill when I'm sure,
when it pleases me.

693
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:03,890
Obviously, more expedient.

694
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,866
To each his own method.

695
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:08,097
Quite.

696
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:10,969
I presume
you have nothing more to say.

697
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,837
Valentin!

698
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:16,170
I warn you I am not a man
one throws out.

699
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,611
I would regret
having to kill a servant.

700
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:22,048
Valentin is an old retainer
whom I'm fond of.

701
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:25,611
Valentin,
will you show Monsieur out?

702
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,446
Good evening, Garance.

703
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,952
Good evening, my friend.

704
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,887
How strange.
When I'm not home you sing,

705
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,756
but when I come in,
you fall silent.

706
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,225
You only like serious music.

707
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:45,800
Sadly, our tastes differ.

708
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:48,496
May I askwhere you spent
the evening?

709
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:50,662
At the Funambules.

710
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,071
Again!

711
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:56,134
And you,
at those ghastly animal fights.

712
00:08:56,212 --> 00:08:57,941
"Ghastly" is too strong a word.

713
00:08:58,014 --> 00:09:01,745
A mangy bear tossed like a bone
to three mastiffs.

714
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:05,852
It wasn't sport, but butchery.
A most dreary evening.

715
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:07,913
And the Funambules?

716
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:11,420
I won't be going back again.

717
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:13,155
I'm delighted.

718
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,891
Don't be little the Funambules.

719
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:18,525
You forget we met there.

720
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:23,698
Which no doubt explains
your pious nightly pilgrimage?

721
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,240
No, my friend.

722
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,242
The contrary would surprise me.

723
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,802
May I know the name of that man
whojust left?

724
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,179
Were you at the Funambules
with him?

725
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:37,013
That man?

726
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:38,644
Oh, him.

727
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:41,349
An old acquaintance.
He came to say hello.

728
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:45,383
A most peculiar individual.
What does he do?

729
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,122
He writes.

730
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:50,256
To be honest, when I knew him,
he was also a thief,

731
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,364
and a bit of a murderer.

732
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:56,769
I hope there was nothing

733
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,534
between you and this individual.

734
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,337
I trust you entirely.

735
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:04,607
That does you no credit.
I've never had occasion to lie to you.

736
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,307
True enough.

737
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:10,580
But please oblige me by seeing
such people as seldom as possible.

738
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,678
Actors, perhaps,

739
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:16,316
but thieves, murderers--
isn't that rather appalling?

740
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:22,126
Remember the young Scot
you challenged to a duel in Edinburgh?

741
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,359
I remember quite well.
Why?

742
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,127
He wasn't nearly
as good a shot as you.

743
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:30,798
Of course.
Everyone knew it.

744
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:32,773
But you killed him anyway.

745
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:35,834
Feelings, Garance,
in an affair of honor!

746
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,175
All because I smiled at him.

747
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:41,648
Yes.
In public, and frequently.

748
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:44,982
But I told you
I was thinking of another.

749
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,119
Please understand
how much I want your love.

750
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,229
- For yourself.
- Don't torment me, Garance.

751
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:58,291
You know what I'd do for you,
because of you.

752
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:01,796
- Because of me!
- I love you as no man--

753
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:04,897
Could ever love me.
So why complain?

754
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:08,599
I want you to love me.

755
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,437
I do love you, my friend.

756
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,979
You're charming, rich, witty.

757
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,482
Friends admire you,
foes fear you.

758
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:21,450
You appeal to women.
Everyone loves you, Edouard.

759
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:24,056
How could I not do the same?

760
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:25,787
Stop it, Garance.

761
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,726
You know what I desire,
what I want.

762
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:30,265
You're incredible, Edouard.

763
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:32,495
Not only are you rich,

764
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:35,298
but you want to be loved
as if you were poor.

765
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,300
But what about the poor?

766
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:40,740
Be reasonable.
Don't deprive them of everything.

767
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,807
- Understand me--
- I do.

768
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,940
And I'll continue to do
my best to please you.

769
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:49,985
But don't ask the impossible.

770
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,716
However, if you like,

771
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:54,818
if it makes you happy,

772
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,519
tomorrow all Paris will know
I'm mad about you.

773
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:01,323
Yes, mad.

774
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:04,322
I'll shout it from the roof tops.

775
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:08,833
But to you, privately,
my friend, I say this:

776
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:12,537
I loved a man,
and I still love him.

777
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,103
I came back to Paris to see him.

778
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,245
He let me know
he'd forgotten me.

779
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,909
All I can think of now

780
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:24,782
is to leave once again, to get away.

781
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:45,970
THE RAG MAN
NO PERFORMANCE

782
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,477
Come in.

783
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:57,915
Your dinner, Mr Baptiste.

784
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:01,721
Thank you, but I'm not hungry.

785
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:04,150
You're being unreasonable.

786
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:06,524
True, I'm unreasonable.

787
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:11,126
Shutting yourself up like a monk!

788
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,828
No, monks pray.

789
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:15,803
I sleep, I dream.

790
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:17,702
Everyone's looking for you.

791
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:19,297
Hardly everyone.

792
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,242
The Funambules is closed.

793
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:25,940
Your wife, your son, your father,
the whole troupe--

794
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:29,542
you can'tjust forget them
like that!

795
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:35,781
But I couldn't go on living
like a fool in an asylum,

796
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:38,622
with everyone around me
whispering,

797
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,662
"What's wrong? Is he ill?"

798
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,829
I even saw a doctor for them.

799
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:48,967
- What did he say?
- That I was fit as a fiddle.

800
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:51,802
"Mild depression, overwork.
It's nothing!"

801
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,308
And what was his prescription?

802
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,837
"Go see Baptiste.
He'll cheer you up."

803
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:01,380
What if I don't want to cheer up?

804
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:05,483
- What's today?
- Thursday.

805
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:11,456
Tonight's the premiere
of Othello, with Mr Frédérick.

806
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,586
You should go.
It will cheer you up.

807
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:15,357
Oh, sorry!

808
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:19,467
Othello would make
a nice pantomime.

809
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:23,027
A man kills his beloved

810
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,873
and it kills him, poor man!

811
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,137
A sad, absurd tale,
like so many others.

812
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:34,310
Like mine or yours,
Madame Hermine.

813
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,518
You spend your empty days
in your empty rooms

814
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,747
with your poor empty heart.

815
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,792
It's all so sad and absurd.

816
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:47,552
Like me.

817
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:51,529
Years ago,
I stood here by this bed,

818
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:54,331
in this very room.

819
00:14:56,171 --> 00:15:00,403
And she stood there,
smiling, happy,

820
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,842
so lovely in the fresh night air.

821
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,710
And she said,

822
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,908
"Love is so simple."

823
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:11,345
And I didn't listen!

824
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:14,452
I didn't take her in my arms!

825
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,683
I set conditions:
"Love me as I love you."

826
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,557
And I shut the door,

827
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,529
forever, between my love and me.

828
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:27,029
What are you doing here?

829
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,195
I'm talking to myself.
Not to you.

830
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:34,837
Forgive me.
I didn't mean to be unpleasant.

831
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:38,971
You've helped me
and been so discreet.

832
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,845
It's only natural.

833
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,789
I can't--

834
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,153
I can't stay here any longer.

835
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:55,593
All alone.

836
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:59,699
I have to get out.
I have to walk.

837
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:11,708
Did he eat?

838
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,839
- He will.
- Good.

839
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:18,046
Thank you for telling me.
I was so anxious.

840
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,645
It's only natural,
between women.

841
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:23,584
He needs to be alone.

842
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,752
We mustn't disturb him.
He's not like other men.

843
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,420
Ofcourse not.

844
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:31,989
He's like a sleepwalker on a roof.

845
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:36,134
If you call to him, he falls.
That's Baptiste.

846
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,973
We mustn't call him.

847
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,807
We have to leave him,
wait until he's calm

848
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:44,807
and wakes on his own.

849
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:48,006
When he wakes,

850
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,518
he'll come back.

851
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:10,961
Get me some poison, Iago,
this night.

852
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:14,735
I'll not expostulate with her

853
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,004
lest her body and beauty

854
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,714
unprovide my mind again.

855
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,781
Do it not with poison.

856
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:26,082
Strangle her in her bed,

857
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:28,589
even the bed
she hath contaminated.

858
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:32,451
Let her rot

859
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,459
and perish

860
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,129
and be damned tonight,

861
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:42,867
for she shall not live.

862
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:49,938
Such savagery
and lack ofdecorum.

863
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,142
I can't say I like
this Monsieur Shakespeare.

864
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,444
True, one goes to the theater today
not for the play,

865
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:58,509
but for the actors.

866
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:02,148
You insisted on coming,
my friend.

867
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,989
No doubt I had my reasons.

868
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,096
Hang her!

869
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:11,064
I do but say what she is.

870
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,161
The pity of it, Iago!

871
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:17,865
The pity ofit!

872
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,518
- May I?
- Ofcourse.

873
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:41,863
"Desdemona came tonight.

874
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,866
Othello is no longer jealous.
He is cured. Thank you."

875
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:48,396
You see?

876
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,904
I assure you, you're wrong.

877
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:53,541
Naturally, I'm wrong

878
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,434
and you're innocent.

879
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,376
Othello, too.

880
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,512
Please tell me the truth.
Is it him?

881
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:02,812
No, my friend, it's not him.

882
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:33,645
That handkerchief which
I so loved and gave thee

883
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,411
thou gavest to Cassio.

884
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:40,717
No, by my life and soul.
Send for the man and ask him.

885
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:42,787
Sweet soul,

886
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:45,851
take heed.

887
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:50,158
Take heed of perjury:
Thou art on thy death bed.

888
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:53,497
Dying: easily said,
and just as easily done.

889
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,499
Why do you laugh?

890
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,938
Because if we duel in the morning

891
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:02,465
he won't be here to talk of death
in the evening.

892
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,875
You're mad, Edouard!

893
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:08,439
Why should you care,
if it's not him you love?

894
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,853
Kill me tomorrow:
Let me live tonight!

895
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,389
Nay, if you strive--

896
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:17,288
But half an hour!

897
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,156
Being done,
there is no pause.

898
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,253
But while I say one prayer.

899
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,161
It is too late!

900
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:54,958
The play's not over!

901
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,396
We're getting some air.

902
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:03,466
I really must congratulate
this remarkable actor.

903
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:07,135
If you do,
I'll never see you again.

904
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,541
Nor him either,
for that matter.

905
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:28,022
Come!

906
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,754
Where?

907
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:32,391
I don't know. Anywhere.

908
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:54,817
Monsieur, you play
the bloodthirsty brute so naturally.

909
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:57,720
You're too kind.

910
00:21:57,793 --> 00:22:01,786
I merely played him
as Shakespeare wrote him,

911
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,457
as naturally as possible.

912
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,400
A peculiar fellow,
this Mr Shakespeare.

913
00:22:08,136 --> 00:22:12,505
I hear he made his literary debut
as a butcher's apprentice.

914
00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:13,905
Why not?

915
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:17,810
Which would explain
the bestial nature ofhis plays,

916
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:21,508
and his popularity among dockers
and carters.

917
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:22,880
And kings!

918
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:26,944
I see why I found this play
so distasteful and shocking.

919
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:30,585
I'll buy my coachman a seat.

920
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,752
It's worth trying.

921
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:36,021
Then allow me
to offer you a box

922
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:37,992
for your horses.

923
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,193
It's worth trying.

924
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,538
I thought you'd forgotten me.

925
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:47,166
I thought I'd lost you forever.

926
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,972
I've never forgotten you.

927
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,180
You were even in my dreams.

928
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,179
You saved me from growing old,
dull and used up.

929
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:04,088
My life was so empty.
I felt so alone.

930
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,285
But I kept thinking:
I've no right to be sad.

931
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:10,026
I'm happy.
Someone loved me.

932
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,226
But I still love you.
I always have.

933
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:15,399
And do you love me?

934
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,439
No, don't answer.

935
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,471
I won't ask for anything.

936
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,804
You're here.
That's all that matters.

937
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:26,672
Here, alive in my arms,

938
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,739
like the first time.

939
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:31,212
No, I ask for nothing.

940
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:33,483
Only...

941
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:37,080
the warmth of your body
against my body,

942
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,959
this mouth of yours.

943
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,125
These eyes of yours.

944
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,614
My compliments, Frédérick.
You were superb.

945
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,876
- May I introduce--
- No need.

946
00:24:36,952 --> 00:24:39,785
We met once before.
Once too often.

947
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,550
Amusing!

948
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:45,218
These gentlemen seek
a quarrel with me,

949
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,523
all very politely, I admit.

950
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:49,894
We all must kill time in some way.

951
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:54,565
Gentlemen, you're wrong
about my friend here.

952
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,000
I haven't known him long,
but in his way,

953
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:01,832
he's a remarkable fellow,

954
00:25:02,444 --> 00:25:04,435
and not lacking in talent.

955
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:06,978
All kinds of talents, no doubt.

956
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:10,245
It takes all kinds to make a world,
or unmake it.

957
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:11,580
Amusing.

958
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:13,644
An amusing pleasantry.

959
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:17,590
- Quite.
- You really find him amusing?

960
00:25:18,693 --> 00:25:20,786
Then let us amuse ourselves.

961
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:23,353
Besides, we run no risk.

962
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:25,422
The gentleman doesn't fight duels.

963
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,025
Absolutely not.

964
00:25:28,837 --> 00:25:32,705
How do you ply your talents
these days?

965
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,472
Since you ask,

966
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:37,808
I'm putting
the finishing touches

967
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:41,679
on something
that will cause a sensation.

968
00:25:43,318 --> 00:25:44,979
A tragedy, no doubt.

969
00:25:45,053 --> 00:25:47,544
No, a comedy, a farce.

970
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:50,182
Or a tragedy, if you prefer.

971
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,227
It's all the same.
There's no difference.

972
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:54,955
Or very little.

973
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,464
For example,
if a king is deceived,

974
00:25:57,532 --> 00:26:00,626
it's a tragedy of infidelity.

975
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:02,693
He's deceived not by his wife--

976
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:05,831
- But by Fate.
- Yes, Fate.

977
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:10,342
But if it's a poor devil like you or me,
Monsieur de Montray--

978
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:13,341
and I use "me" as a figure of speech--

979
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:16,179
it's no longer a tragedy,

980
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:20,878
but mere buffoonery,
a sorry tale of cuckolds.

981
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,052
Yet it's the same matter
under the pauper's cap or the crown.

982
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:30,455
The dead matter of love

983
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:32,591
rotting in the heads
of the unloved.

984
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:37,162
Always the same matter,
the same stories, the same tears.

985
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:42,040
So the genre is nothing.
My play need only amuse.

986
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,670
Starting with the author.

987
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,405
- Ifit's performed.
- Don't worry, gentlemen.

988
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,007
It will be.

989
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:53,350
It's in progress as we speak.
If you'd like a part...

990
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:56,151
- Very funny.
- Yes, it is very funny.

991
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:59,586
But, I warn you,
there are murders,

992
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:04,622
and at the final curtain,
the dead won't rise for a bow.

993
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:07,293
This man is tedious.

994
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:09,462
- Shall we throw him out?
- Good idea!

995
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:13,098
Don't try to humiliate me.

996
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,233
I'm not some character
out of a farce.

997
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,937
But you are!

998
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:19,475
And I'll prove it!

999
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:30,282
What have you done?

1000
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,784
It doesn't concern you.

1001
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:38,726
Gentlemen, I've just savoured
a most exquisite moment.

1002
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,564
Too bad for you.

1003
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:47,369
I said I wasn't a man
to be thrown out with impunity.

1004
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,652
Again, this doesn't concern you.

1005
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,351
How do you know?

1006
00:28:04,426 --> 00:28:07,520
Jealousy belongs to all
ifa woman belongs to none.

1007
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:11,260
- They're going to duel.
- Because of us?

1008
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,699
No, because ofme.

1009
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,499
But not before tomorrow.

1010
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,004
So?

1011
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,007
We have the night before us,

1012
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,508
with us,

1013
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:24,571
for us.

1014
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:30,241
IfI'm not home, I'll be at the baths,
where I'll be expecting--

1015
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:32,650
My seconds.

1016
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:36,018
You do me a great honor,

1017
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:41,123
by sending offto the next world
a man alien to yours.

1018
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:09,621
You see before you a man
who's been ousted unceremoniously.

1019
00:29:11,393 --> 00:29:14,954
But the mere thought of them

1020
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:17,691
killing one another
over a woman, because ofme,

1021
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:19,666
comforts me.

1022
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:21,998
So we'll be seconds again?

1023
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,197
I doubt we'll be asked this time.

1024
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:26,433
Too bad! I like duels.

1025
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:28,169
That can be arranged.

1026
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:33,044
If not a duel, you may
be witness to something else.

1027
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:36,680
Because in this affair of honor

1028
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:39,481
I, Lacenaire,
am the offended party.

1029
00:29:39,554 --> 00:29:42,489
Offended, insulted,
even humiliated,

1030
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:45,117
because they contemptuously
threw me out.

1031
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,514
How lovely the moonlight is.

1032
00:30:11,753 --> 00:30:13,482
Look, Baptiste.

1033
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:16,657
It's shining for us,
like that first night.

1034
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:23,294
And like that first night,
the window is wide open.

1035
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:29,767
It's wonderful.

1036
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:33,302
Everything is the same.
Nothing has changed.

1037
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:37,767
The table in the same place.

1038
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:48,115
The bed I slept in.

1039
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:55,789
You haven't changed either,
Garance.

1040
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:58,192
The same gentleness in your voice.

1041
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,032
The same light in your eyes.

1042
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:04,631
A little glimmer.

1043
00:31:17,218 --> 00:31:19,743
Your heart beating
against my hand.

1044
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:24,257
You were right, Garance.

1045
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:26,293
Love is so simple.

1046
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,474
Carnival time!
Life is beautiful.

1047
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,973
A bath, gentlemen?

1048
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:16,806
We merelywish
to see Count de Montray.

1049
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:19,008
At this hour? He's resting.

1050
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,911
He's expecting us.

1051
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,878
In that case,

1052
00:32:23,017 --> 00:32:25,679
please follow me.

1053
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:01,212
- What is it?
- Two gentlemen.

1054
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,450
They say you're expecting them.

1055
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:05,321
Two gentlemen.

1056
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:07,584
Yes. Show them in.

1057
00:34:00,314 --> 00:34:02,214
My poor Avril.

1058
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,551
The play is over.

1059
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:06,780
You can go now.

1060
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:10,288
You'd be wise to go
to the country for a while.

1061
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:14,389
What about you?

1062
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:17,524
Oh, me!
I'm staying here.

1063
00:34:17,865 --> 00:34:21,824
I won't risk losing my head
to a country executioner.

1064
00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:23,393
Absolutely not!

1065
00:35:34,976 --> 00:35:37,308
It was a wonderful night.

1066
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:39,971
But I must go now.

1067
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:42,481
I can't let Frédérick die
because of me.

1068
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:45,311
- What will you do?
- Find Edouard.

1069
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,288
Tell him I lost my head.

1070
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:50,187
I'll beg him not to duel.

1071
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:52,453
- Will he listen?
- Yes.

1072
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:56,090
If I say I love him,
and him alone.

1073
00:35:56,164 --> 00:35:58,724
You're incapable of lying.
He won't believe you.

1074
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:01,628
He doesn't care
if it's not true.

1075
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,431
I know him.

1076
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:06,405
All he really wants
is to hear me say it.

1077
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:09,337
What matters
is not that I love him,

1078
00:36:09,443 --> 00:36:11,638
but that I love no one else.

1079
00:36:12,814 --> 00:36:14,509
That's love to him.

1080
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:17,016
What if he asks you
to leave with him?

1081
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:19,052
I'll go.

1082
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:21,417
Perhaps I'll come back.

1083
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:24,019
I'd have to leave someday.

1084
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:25,854
Why?

1085
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:28,662
You know why.

1086
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:32,328
You have a sweet little boy.

1087
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,061
Stop it!

1088
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:37,327
You love your little boy,

1089
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:40,438
and you love your work.

1090
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:43,134
And Nathalie.

1091
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:45,702
It's you I love, Garance!

1092
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,050
- Wait here and be good.
- Will you be long?

1093
00:36:55,122 --> 00:36:57,056
No, I'll come back for you.

1094
00:36:57,124 --> 00:37:00,150
- What for?
- It's a surprise.

1095
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:19,142
Don't leave me.
I can't bear it.

1096
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:21,647
What about me?
I have only you.

1097
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:43,093
Excuse me, Baptiste.

1098
00:37:43,604 --> 00:37:45,595
I came by--

1099
00:37:45,673 --> 00:37:47,868
I thought you'd be alone.

1100
00:37:47,942 --> 00:37:49,842
All alone.

1101
00:37:51,412 --> 00:37:55,610
You see, it's carnival today.

1102
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:58,543
Our son was so happy.

1103
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,918
So I came by--

1104
00:38:02,857 --> 00:38:05,155
He's dressed up as a cavalry man.

1105
00:38:06,027 --> 00:38:07,961
A lovely cavalry uniform.

1106
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:15,230
Please don't let me
stand here like this.

1107
00:38:15,303 --> 00:38:17,237
It's awful!

1108
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:19,000
Speak to me at least.

1109
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:22,171
Answer me! Say something!

1110
00:38:22,243 --> 00:38:24,234
Anything!

1111
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:26,974
Tell me to go away,
laugh in my face!

1112
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:32,318
Is that all you can say?

1113
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:41,787
I really must go.

1114
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,887
Again!

1115
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,060
How easy it must be.

1116
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,430
How easy what must be?

1117
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:52,165
Easy to go, then come back.

1118
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:54,574
You go. You're missed.

1119
00:38:54,642 --> 00:38:56,610
Time works for you.

1120
00:38:56,844 --> 00:39:00,007
Then you come back,
embellished by memory.

1121
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:04,749
Yes, that must be easy.

1122
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:08,921
But to stay and live
with someone,

1123
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:11,818
share his everyday life--

1124
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,555
that's something else.

1125
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:17,597
You can't fight that.

1126
00:39:18,032 --> 00:39:21,024
I've lived with him for six years.

1127
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:24,371
So have I.

1128
00:39:26,273 --> 00:39:29,299
- You, too?
- Yes. Me, too.

1129
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:32,205
Anywhere, everywhere,
every day.

1130
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,680
And every night.

1131
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:39,516
All those nights spent at another's side,
I was with him.

1132
00:39:41,122 --> 00:39:43,181
Let her finish.

1133
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:45,316
I want to know
everything about you two,

1134
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:48,184
know what's left for me.

1135
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:50,797
If there's enough to live on.

1136
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:54,059
What do I care
if you love him?

1137
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:56,863
You don't count.
You don't exist for me.

1138
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:02,937
Listen to me, Baptiste.
Answer me.

1139
00:40:03,644 --> 00:40:07,580
I'm not afraid to suffer.
Everybody suffers.

1140
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:11,713
But I must know.
Tell me now.

1141
00:40:12,053 --> 00:40:14,112
Without thinking about it!

1142
00:40:14,422 --> 00:40:16,322
Look at me!

1143
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,784
Were you always thinking ofher
while living with me?

1144
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:25,221
You don't dare answer.

1145
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:29,265
But your silence tells me
a lot ofthings,

1146
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:31,330
things I do understand.

1147
00:40:35,409 --> 00:40:36,842
Answer me!

1148
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:39,607
Were you always thinking of her?

1149
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,474
Even at night? Answer me!
Even at night?

1150
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:49,985
What about me, Baptiste?

1151
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:51,718
What about me?

1152
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:38,102
The game's up!
Time to go home.

1153
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:40,072
- Let me go!
- For shame!

1154
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:43,008
As sure as I'm called Old Maid,

1155
00:41:43,077 --> 00:41:46,308
Wise Counsel, Prim and Proper,

1156
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,610
for my sense ofmorality.

1157
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:50,343
Let go!
You make me sick!

1158
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:38,158
Out of my way!
