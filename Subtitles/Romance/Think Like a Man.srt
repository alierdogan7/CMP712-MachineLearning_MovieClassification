00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,647
I'ma go on and leave.

181
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,232
Hey.

182
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,319
She's crazy. And I don't like her knees.

183
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,696
Excuse me, Miss, I noticed
that you were...

184
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,698
(GROANS) Honestly, I couldn't care less

185
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,241
about whatever it is you have to say.

186
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,368
And I can appreciate that.

187
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,994
I just know that I've seen you here before

188
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,371
and you're usually so stunning...

189
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,164
And you'll always have those memories.

190
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,833
In fact, why don't you walk
away and pretend this...

191
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,502
I don't know what I did to
make you so defensive.

192
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,337
All I'm saying is, whatever it is,

193
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,880
it's no reason to let yourself
go, that's it.

194
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,548
Let myself go?

195
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,758
I didn't mean any disrespect...

196
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,176
Let me tell your tired ass something.

197
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
Something's changed.

198
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,762
Usually, there's an aura,

199
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,430
there's a glint about you
that I'm not seeing.

200
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,682
And I don't know if it's a relationship

201
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,519
or if it's job related, it's just...

202
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,812
Is that it?

203
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,398
It's work related?

204
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,485
Well, to be honest,

205
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,030
I was laid off from my job
about two months ago.

206
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,115
This damn economy.

207
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,908
How'd it go? CEDRIC: Not good, man.

208
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,119
Yo, I literally have nothing
to say anymore.

209
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,328
I don't know what's going on.

210
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,913
And my breath ain't right. (GROANS)

211
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,540
Drink a beer. You smell it?

212
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,999
You can't let that steal your smile,

213
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,376
'cause that smile that I'm talking about,

214
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,461
that's gonna get you that
next CEO gig, you get it?

215
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,712
See now? See? You're smiling.

216
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,589
Now I'm smiling.

217
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,757
I'ma walk away from here like a fairy now,

218
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,925
'cause I'm all happy.

219
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,802
A fairy? (LAUGHS) Yeah.

220
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,470
Have a good evening.

221
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,721
Thank you.

222
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,933
Got shot down.

223
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,017
(MOUTHING) Two, one...

224
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,102
Wait.

225
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,983
She calling him back for another
episode of crazy.

226
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,401
Here.

227
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,862
She probably shot him down. Twice.

228
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,655
Crazy, right? Man.

229
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,116
Talking about Jesus and she don't
speak English and stuff, right?

230
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,284
Luck of mine.

231
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,452
She actually gave me her damn number.

232
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,536
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

233
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,580
The Dark Knight strikes again.

234
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,831
How great is Kristen, man?

235
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,915
Nice.

236
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,083
She's a phenomenal girl.

237
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,668
I just don't understand why
she's with this dude.

238
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,503
CEDRIC: Nobody does. How
good is your credit?

239
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,839
It's up. Low 400s, 430?

240
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,966
Goddamn! A 430?

241
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,010
You can't even get a Discover Card!

242
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,636
Don't white people start off
with a 500 credit score?

243
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,181
Five-fifty, 475 if you're a mulatto.

244
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,599
GAIL: Cedric!

245
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,933
Yes, Gail.

246
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,602
Gail, listen to what I'm trying to say!

247
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,769
Gail, I don't care!

248
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,480
I don't care what you take out the garage!

249
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,898
Gail, you can take the whole damn garage.

250
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,649
Let me tell you something.
Here's what I want,

251
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,151
and this is what's... (PHONE BEEPS) Hello?

252
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,360
Gail?

253
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,570
Y'all, I swear...

254
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,447
She didn't let me finish my sentence.
I don't like that.

255
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,657
Hey, Ced. When's the divorce
gonna be final?

256
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,242
Goodness, if I had to guess,

257
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,203
I'd say like four weeks, 367 hours,

258
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,787
22 minutes, 32 seconds.

259
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,914
That's just a guess.

260
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,624
Who's counting? ZEKE: But you
know what we should do?

261
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,876
We should take Cedric out for
celebration game night.

262
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,336
I can't do Sunday. This Sunday,

263
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,421
dinner with my ma. Little
casserole action...

264
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,547
JEREMY: That's every Sunday.

265
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,009
I can't do Sunday either. Jonah's
got a violin recital.

266
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,470
My God, dude, your kid has
way too many recitals.

267
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,056
Wait a minute, hold on, wait.
Your son play the violin?

268
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,933
And the cello. Yo, he's gay.

269
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,017
Playing the violin doesn't make him gay.

270
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,185
Yes, it does.

271
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,353
Name me one gay violinist.

272
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,479
Your son.

273
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,647
Listen to this.

274
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,024
Cedric is about to be released from
the shackles of Gail-Hell.

275
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,109
Forever. And we're about
to miss it for what?

276
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,486
Another Jonah recital.

277
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,613
By the way, he sucks. BENNETT: Really?

278
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,448
I'd expect that from them, not you.

279
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,741
What do you mean, "them"?

280
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,034
Like what, like black people or what?

281
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,369
Absolutely.

282
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,412
I don't get mad because he's
bold enough to say it.

283
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,331
Seriously, you have ears. Kid's tone-deaf.

284
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,875
This is his big solo. They're
playing the Gap Band.

285
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,335
You know, Dropped a Bomb on Me,

286
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,128
and he's got the last...
(MIMICS PLAYING) "Baby!"

287
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,839
Look, I got a great idea. I'll
have my mom cook for us.

288
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,758
She'll make some chocolate chip
cookies, a big casserole.

289
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,926
We'll do it the right way.

290
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,970
Mike, I almost punched you in
your damn face just now, man.

291
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,096
And I was gonna add a head butt.

292
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,597
I'm not going over your mom house

293
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,974
to celebrate my damn divorce party!

294
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,141
We gotta eat. We can start there...

295
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,393
I don't wanna eat with your mom!

296
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,769
I ain't going over his mom house.

297
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,563
Look, she just got the new Tyler Perry,

298
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,189
For Colored Girls on Blu-ray.

299
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,774
We'll just have a nice
little fellas night,

300
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,984
a chill-out night.

301
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,152
Let me tell you what happens, Janet
Jackson gets AIDS at the end

302
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,697
and some crazy guy throws his kids
out the window. You good?

303
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,448
Can we party now? Let's do it! I hate you.

304
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,576
All right, put 'em up! Yes, sir.

305
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,912
Fine, I'm in, man.

306
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,416
Life is great, fellas.
May it never change.

307
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,501
CEDRIC: None of us could have known

308
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,919
that the first bomb had been dropped.

309
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,421
The war had been declared.

310
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,047
And hard-worn secrets

311
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,966
had now fallen into the
hands of the enemy.

312
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,010
We had been betrayed by one of our own.

313
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,219
A man.

314
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,971
I'm talking about a man with a penis.

315
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,723
Someone who should know better.

316
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,642
And because of those actions,
a blitz was now on its way,

317
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,228
that would affect my entire
Band of Brothers.

318
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,522
VICKI: We have another question
in the audience, Steve.

319
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,815
Steve, I keep hooking up with guys

320
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,025
who don't want a relationship.

321
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,443
Why don't you stop hooking up?

322
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,652
Did you hear that?

323
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,406
Listen, men respect women
who have standards.

324
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,699
Just get some.

325
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,534
Exactly.

326
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,745
WOMAN 2: Steve, I'm a partner
in my law firm,

327
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,996
I own my own home,

328
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,040
but I've been single for three years.

329
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,834
Why can't I seem to find a man
to live up to my standards?

330
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,961
Maybe you need to adjust
them a little bit.

331
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,963
Bullshit. VICKI: Are you saying
that we should settle?

332
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,633
Look, you make six figures.
Does he have to?

333
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,717
Yes.

334
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,136
You own your own home. Does he have to?

335
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,304
Yes and yes.

336
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,014
VICKI: We have another question
here in the audience.

337
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,642
Hi, Steve. I'm currently dating

338
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,934
and I just wanna know

339
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,436
when is the right time for me

340
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,064
to introduce my man to my kid? Oh!

341
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,775
I know that single women
don't want to have

342
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,818
a parade of men coming through the house.

343
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,070
Exactly! I get that.

344
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,197
But if a guy is a serious contender...
What up, Momma?

345
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,531
Excuse you?

346
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,492
...bring him in as soon as
possible. Morning, Mom.

347
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,494
Because if you invest six months in a man

348
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,329
and then you introduce him to the kids

349
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,916
and he's not feeling the
kids, or vice versa,

350
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,710
then guess what? You just
wasted six months.

351
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,754
That's true. Did that.

352
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,306
Alex?

353
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,686
Alex!

354
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,145
Wake up!

355
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,318
Look, babe, I got us two
double-shot lattes.

356
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,612
Thanks, baby. Here.

357
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,615
Figured we needed some caffeine
after last night.

358
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,576
It was amazing. Mmm-hmm.

359
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,039
I'm gonna go and freshen up.

360
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,668
So, I'll be right back.

361
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,545
I'll be right here.

362
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,424
Don't move.

363
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,633
Don't worry, I won't.

364
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,345
So, babe, I was thinking

365
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,514
maybe we could go on our first real date.

366
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,391
We could go see a movie? Yeah, babe.

367
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,517
We should do that.

368
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,186
Things between us are gonna start
getting real serious, baby.

369
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,107
MYA: Okay, so I was thinking maybe we could
go see the new Tyler Perry movie.

370
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,275
You know, the one where the guy's,

371
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,484
like, mean to his girlfriend,

372
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,653
and a nice guy comes and rescues her

373
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,864
and at the end, they both find Jesus.

374
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,368
Alex? So, yes to the Tyler Perry movie?

375
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,620
Alex!

376
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,498
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

377
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,627
"Michelle"?

378
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,048
It's Mya, asshole!

379
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,967
Mya.

(SIGHS)

381
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,972
Did this nigga take my coffee?

382
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,724
CEDRIC: It was like some long-hidden truth

383
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,058
had finally been released

384
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,269
in hardcover and paperback.

385
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,188
For my book club.

386
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,898
For me! For my mom!

387
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,650
For the first time in their
lives, women all over

388
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,612
stopped turning to other women
for relationship advice.

389
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,821
Really?

390
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,072
I got one too many.

391
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Thank you.

392
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,494
Instead, they went straight
to a man, Steve Harvey.

393
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,996
He had made his name as a comedian,

394
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,372
but this shit here? This wasn't funny.

395
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,124
And because of this,

396
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,667
things would never be the same.

397
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,691
Excuse me?

398
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,443
Yeah, hi.

399
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,320
Hey, did you by any chance
go to Fairfax High?

400
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,780
Yes.

401
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,406
I went there as well. Michael Hanover.

402
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,408
Candace Hall. Yeah, I remember.

403
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,035
I had classes with your sister Lisa.

404
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,412
CASHIER: Next in line. I'm sorry,
I don't recognize you.

405
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,957
Well, yeah, I was, like, five feet tall,

406
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,291
99 pounds when we graduated.

407
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,627
I had the glasses and the buck teeth.

408
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,671
Oh. (LAUGHS)

409
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,339
That look familiar, maybe down here?

410
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,841
Yeah, you do.

411
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,552
I don't know if that's a good
thing or a bad thing.

412
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,886
You dissing me already?

413
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,055
Well, you've grown up. Quite nicely.

414
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,558
And you haven't changed a
bit. You look amazing.

415
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,395
Well, you need to put those
glasses back on, obviously.

416
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,856
No, actually, I'm nearsighted.

417
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,900
Besides, I mean, how could
I forget my teenage crush?

418
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,945
I used to look at you
walk down the hallway

419
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,823
and just fall into your smile.

420
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,827
I'm rambling, I do that when
I get nervous. Mmm.

421
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,495
CASHIER: Next in line.

422
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,206
Well, it was nice meeting,
I mean, seeing you.

423
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,334
It's nice finally being seen.

(CLEARS THROAT) CASHIER:
Next in line, please.

425
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,303
Candace?

426
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,347
Could we go grab a cup of
coffee or something?

427
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,099
We could maybe catch up on
old times we never had.

428
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,352
I can't, actually. I have to pick up my...

429
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,770
Husband? No...

430
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,689
You got a boyfriend? No, I have a son.

431
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,025
Oh...

432
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,364
Well, how about dinner?

433
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,329
Yeah.

434
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,584
KRISTEN: I finally get it. GINA: Get what?

435
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,503
Getting Jeremy to propose is like getting
Jeremy to paint the kitchen

436
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,963
or put the toilet seat down.

437
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,508
It's not gonna happen until
I require him to.

438
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,344
And I haven't required him
to do a damn thing.

439
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,428
Hmm.

440
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,472
You know we still go halfsies
on everything?

441
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,890
I thought that was your idea.

442
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,141
Yeah, in college.

443
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,310
He was work study and
I felt sorry for him.

444
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,562
And I am still paying for it, to this day.

445
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,105

449
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,655
Yeah, and we can't wait.

450
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,531
Thank you.

Here, come on.

452
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,077
Watch your step.

00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,578
See, that is a man with a plan.

454
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,914
He knows what he wants,
he knows what he has.

I sell beautiful homes for a living

456
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,169
and we live in a frat house for the boys.

457
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,588
Last Valentine's Day, the boys were there.

458
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,881
So, you're saying, you're...

459
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,675
My God, I'm one of the boys,

460
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,760
except I have a vagina!

461
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,346
I swear to God, Frodo Baggins
had it easier.

462
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,555
I'm sorry, who?

463
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,015
Frodo, from The Hobbit.

464

I don't do hobbits.

00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,602
Right, no, me neither. That's so lame.

466
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,187
Jeremy had a chess set.

467
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,522
It's totally stupid.

468
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,773
Okay, so what are you gonna do?

469
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,441
You're gonna trick him into
giving you a ring?

470
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,737
I'm not gonna trick him. I'm
going to require him.

471
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,531
It's been nine years. Uh-huh.

472
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,533
So, what makes you think
it's gonna change now?

473
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,034
I've got some new information.

474
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,369
Oh, you do?

475
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,914
Yeah, because Steve says "Don't
hate the Player..."

476
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,041
Change the game.

477
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,252
BENNETT: It's your shot. Wait!

478
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,420
You gotta raise your left leg.

00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,428
H-O, you're a ho.

481
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,721
Really? I'm a ho?

482
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,389
I've been with the same
woman for nine years.

483
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,391
I'm the Stedman Graham of
relationships, all right?

484
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,309
Bro, I'm not saying ho like "whore."

485
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,477
I'm saying ho,

486
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,729
like punk bitch that's been henpecked,

487
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,272
so he ain't got no more nuts,

488
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,481
'cause his girl runs the house. Oh!

489
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,900
Speaking of which, how's Kristen?
She's incredible.

490
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,070
We were up till 2:00 a.m. playing Call
ofDuty last night. She loved it.

491
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,156
She does it... She does it for you.

492
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,532
I know my woman, okay?

493
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,492
Fantasy? Science fiction? Action figures?

494
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,119
All the stuff I love, she loves, too.

495
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,162
No, she does that shit

496
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,913
for you, trust me. Deep down
inside, she's thinking...

497
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,791
This is some silly-ass shit.

498
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,169
What the hell?

499
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,004
No wonder Jeremy hasn't proposed yet,

500
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,297
he hasn't gone through puberty.

501
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,175
It's time for a little spring cleaning.

502
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,179
You first.

503
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,181
No, no. That's your problem, Gail.

504
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,183
You don't never want to listen,
you just want to talk.

505
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,851
What'd I say? I said I'm
gonna be there tomorrow.

506
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,270
No, no, no. Listen, Gail...

507
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,772
I'm not gonna go back and
forth with you. Oh, man.

508
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,357
'Cause I'm trying to talk and you ain't
gonna let me say what I... Hello?

509
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,734
Gail?

510
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,986
Did it again. Hung up on me again.

511
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,988
What do you call the three
rings of marriage?

512
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,198
No clue.

513
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,992
The engagement ring, the wedding
ring, and the suffer-ring.

514
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,952
Oh, and, in your case, the beat-ing.

515
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
This is not the time.

516
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,830
You know, y'all underestimate
me because I'm short.

517
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,998
No, it's 'cause you a fool.

518
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,875
What up? What's happening, baby?

519
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,502
The hell's wrong with you?

520
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,253
You're stoned. Yeah, you're high!

521
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,379
(GRUNTS)

522
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,422
Either you're high,

523
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,382
or everything on my eHarmony
profile is true.

524
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,884
I'm high off life, gentlemen.

525
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,636
I met this girl.

526
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,889
No, matter of fact, she's not even a girl.

527
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,349
I met a woman.

528
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,017
But you are a woman.

529
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,482
Order up!

530
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,485
Hey, guess who's back. Table eight.

531
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,780
(EXCLAIMS IN SPANISH)

532
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,824
She is way out of your league, Dom.

533
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,826
Ain't no such thing, playboy.

534
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,036
All right, she probably spends
more here in one night

535
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,496
than you make in a month.

536
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,082
That's true, but, you know,

537
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,042
just think how much she'll
save if I cook for her.

538
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,335
Oh, you crazy.

539
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,087
Dominic. Scallions?

540
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,839
All right, Chef, coming up.

541
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,923
Well, you look cute. What's going on?

542
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,007
I do?

543
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,093
Yes. Thank you, that was nice of you.

544
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,845
Just, you know, Duke made Little League,

545
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,429
got a new laptop, met a guy.

546
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,723
I think I'm gonna try the white sea bass.

547
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Met a what?

548
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,726
A guy.

549
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,186
A real one? Not a blow-up doll?

550
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,730
Okay, don't look so surprised.
It's not that...

551
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,357
Honey, I'm just saying,

552
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,025
it's been two years since your divorce.

553
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,695
And three, maybe four, since you had sex.

554
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,446
I said I met a guy, Lauren,

555
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,031
I didn't say I was changing my last name.

556
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,199
Yet.

557
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,536
I need all the details,
honey. Now. Spill it.

558
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,955
Is she hot? Whoo! Pure fire.

559
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,123
Does she got real big titties?

560
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,208
Yeah, what's the rack like?
Tell us about the rack.

561
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,544
The rack. Definitely some white boy shit.

562
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,713
It is white boy shit. We love breasts.

563
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,715
You're not even white,
Bennett. You're clear.

564
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,134
He's got kind eyes. Soulful. Yes!

565
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,302
He's sensitive.

566
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,887
I know she got a fat ass.

567
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,556
She got that JLo, Serena Williams mash up.

568
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,350
Ass so big, I could hide underneath
it if it was raining.

569
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,060
That's way too much ass. No such thing.

570
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,770
Damn right, it ain't. The
bigger, the better.

571
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,232
But it wasn't just a physical attraction,

572
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,609
it was intellectual.

573
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,236
He loved The Immortal Life
of Henrietta Lacks.

574
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,072
He bought one for his mom's book
club. Isn't that sweet?

575
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,532
Yeah, and kind of gay.

576
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,617
He's a gentleman.

577
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,036
Yo, she a ho. I know she a
ho. Oh, definitely a ho.

578
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,871
Both of you, you both watch
your mouth, all right?

579
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,414
This one's not a ho.

580
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,624
She's a lady.

581
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,876
JEREMY: Whipped already. CEDRIC:
Enjoy it while it lasts, Mike.

582
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,920
Let me tell you something, it
ain't gonna last forever.

583
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,379
They all start out happy.

584
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,089
See, but here's when it gets real.

585
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,217
When you wake up in the morning,
and you go in the living room,

586
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,594
and you catch her pissing
inside of your Jordans.

587
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,054
And not the regular Jordans.

588
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,014
I'm talking about the ones with
the patent leather on the side,

589
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,224
where the pee don't come out.

590
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,434
Don't listen to them, Mike. Relationships
are beautiful.

591
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,602
(GROANS IN DISGUST)

592
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,354
Just saying. So, when are
you guys going out?

593
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,563
Saturday night.

594
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,565
She got to find a sitter,
first, and then...

595
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,775
What, like a dog sitter?

596
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,109
No, she has a son.

597
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,778
What? She has a child.

598
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,446
All right, well, be careful
dating a baby mama.

599
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,530
Why?

600
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,115
Because she's the baby mama.

601
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,450
Dude, she ain't looking
for a couple laughs

602
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,618
and some butt-naked sex.

603
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,453
She been a couple laughs
and some butt-naked sex.

604
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,996
Preach. She looking for a husband.

605
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,206
A father for her son.

606
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,499
Speaking of which, where's the baby daddy?

607
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,459
Oh, good question, Zeke. Thank you.

608
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,543
JEREMY: Could be a psycho.

609
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,629
Just got paroled for killing
her last boyfriend.

610
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,090
Or he could be one of those guys
that like to hide in a bush

611
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,258
waiting for a strange guy

612
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,509
to come to his baby mom's house.

613
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,970
And when he gets there,
he pops out the bushes

614
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,972
hits this guy on the back
of the head with a brick.

615
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,223
Without even realizing

616
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,308
that this guy's relationship with
his baby mom was platonic.

617
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,810
They ever catch that guy?

618
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,103
No, it's a cold case.

619
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,688
The cops won't even revisit the case.

620
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,022
They said they couldn't find the brick.

621
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,609
I'm just saying, I'm just saying.

622
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,112
None of that matters. ZEKE: Really?

Oh, shit. All right! Okay.
Good night, Mike.

CEDRIC: Talking to you about bricks!

626
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,828
You wanna go talk about a smile.

627
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,204
There is one thing, though.

628
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,622
I knew it, he was born a woman.

629
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,749
No. (GIGGLING)

630
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,710
He's, you know, he's... He's what?

631
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,961
A little younger.

632
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,671
You have kidnapped a cub, haven't you?

633
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,839
No, I'll have you know,

634
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,257
he seems very mature, actually.

635
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,425
Mmm-hmm.

636
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,010
Wait a minute, why am I
getting all worked up?

637
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,303
We haven't even had a date yet.

638
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,847
I still need to qualify if
he's even a contender.

639
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,265
Qualify?

640
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,766
You know, like... What are
his long-term goals?

641
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,685
What are his short-term
goals? Can he provide?

642
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,478
Don't hit him with all that at once.

643
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,690
I know, don't worry. I
intend to be stealth.

644
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,692
You? How?

645
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,405
By acting like a lady, but
thinking like a man.

646
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,699
Oh, you fell for that sexist crap?

647
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,035
He's actually giving insight
into a man's perspective.

648
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,162
Why should I have to lower my standards

649
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,580
to get a man? Who does that?

650
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,206
I'm sorry. Now, what man?

651
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,583
I just want my equal.

652
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,377
Okay? Or at least an attractive,
cultured man.

653
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,296
Who's over six feet tall,
makes six figures,

654
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,882
and isn't intimidated by my success.

655
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,301
Okay, girl. Quit chasing the ghost
of James Merrill's past.

656
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,386
He is married and long gone.

657
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,596
Mmm. That man was fine.

658
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,057
Here we go. Let's do a
little research, here.

659
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,184
Ah! This is you. Please, I don't...

660
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,728
"Strong, independent, and lonely women."

661
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,481
I don't need some bald-headed
man on a book

662
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,232
telling me I am strong and independent.

663
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,359
Honey, that's a given.

664
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,610
But you forgot lonely.

665
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,070
You are a bitch.

666
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,404
You're too strong, Lauren.

667
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,656
There's no such thing as too strong.

668
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,866
And you know what?

669
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,659
If I were a man,

670
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,287
being the youngest COO of
a Fortune 500 company

671
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,789
would actually be a good thing.

672
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,123
Women would flock.

673
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,042
Yeah, but men flee when
you lead with that.

674
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,794
And it's not just your job, Lauren.

675
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,171
Remember what Marcel said
on your last date,

676
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,297
after you trumped his wine choice?

677
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,423
It was a better choice.

678
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,633
What were his words again?

679
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,928
"You don't need a man, Lauren,
you are a man."

680
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,889
Happy belated birthday. For you.

681
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,559
I'm just saying, all this
waiting for better?

682
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,769
It's making you bitter.

683
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,441
Hey, babe?

684
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,612
I stopped off for a beer, but
picked us up some dinner.

685
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,947
Oh!

686
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,031
Oh, my God.

687
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,952
Oh, my God! My anime posters!
We got robbed!

688
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,746

689
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,623
Yes. Where's the fire? What's going on?

00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,291
Have you not noticed that
we've been robbed?

691
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,585
I just tidied up a little bit. Relax.

692
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,587
Tidied up? Yeah.

693
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,631

00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,966
Where are they? Are they okay?

695
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,801
They are safe. They're fine.

697
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,847
I just thought we could
paint the living room.

(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

699
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,516
Paint.

700
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,144
Okay. And redecorate.

701
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,605
Redecorate? Yeah.

702
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,982
I thought you loved that stuff.

00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,400
Why would you want to do that?

704
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,527
Because it looks like we live
in a frat house, Jeremy.

705
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,612
Oh, stop it. We are adults,
for Christ's sakes.

706
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,864
We make a decent living.

707
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,158
I think it's time to invest
and make this a real home.

708
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,494
With matching dishes and glasses

709
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,290
and a new couch.

710
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,167
Well, what's wrong with my couch?

711
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,463
Baby, you pulled it out of a dumpster.

712
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,630
Yeah.

713
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,383
I'm pretty sure Annalisa was impregnated,
like, right there.

714
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,260
It's got cigarette burns, bong spills,

715
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,803
there was the scabies scare of '06.

716
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,346
You're being dramatic. No, I'm really not.

717
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,432
Your aunt who tinkles when she laughs?

718
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,476
She pissed all over the
couch last Christmas.

719
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,686
It's disgusting. We're like animals.

720
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,564
I cleaned up the bong spill
and the cigarette burns.

721
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,024
This couch has history.

722
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,193
And now it is history.

723
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,113
So, here are some new ideas.

724
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,741
I thought we could look it over.

725
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,451
Research some new styles.

726
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,203
Gotta zero in on a color palette.

727
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,331
I know you like mauve. You know?

728
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,708
There was that period you went through,

729
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,335
where you were partial to salmon.

730
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,129
Yeah, I'd rather watch Letters
to Juliet with you again.

731
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,757
I know you would. 'Cause you cried
at the end when they got reunited.

732
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,592
I wasn't crying, okay?

733
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,303
I was having an allergic reaction
to the perfume in the theater.

734
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,387
You bought the soundtrack.

735
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,473
It's a good soundtrack.

736
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,226
Look, I'm really bad at this. Okay?

737
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,685
Please, can you do this?

738
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,187
Without me? Really?

739
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,897
Really.

740
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,232
By myself?

741
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,192
Yeah.

742
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,445
I trust you. Awesome.

743
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,821
MYA: Okay, let me ask you a question.

744
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,908
Where is the last guy that you slept
with in less than 90 days?

745
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,076
You mean, John?

746
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,285
Hey! Baby!

747
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,620
'Sup, girl?

748
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,247
Hey, I had a great time the other night.

749
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,414
Oh, did you, Alex?

750
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,874
Yeah, Melanie. I was gonna call you...

751
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,418
Melanie? It's Mya, negro.

752
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,462
Yeah. I gotta go. So, I'll call you.

753
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,423
I know you did not just call her Melanie.

754
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,759
It's okay. I'm not even gonna
let him get to me.

755
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,095
(SIGHS) I am in a better place
and I am on another level.

756
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,182
I don't know, Sonia. I feel
like I have X-ray vision.

757
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,850
Like, Man Goggles.

758
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,686
You know, we spend all
this time complaining

759
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,479
about how guys don't want
to be in relationships,

760
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,814
they just want to hook up.

761
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,732
But really, all along,
we've had the power.

762
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,026
Right. We have?

763
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,904
Yes! We control the cookie.

764
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,781
She who controls the cookie
controls the game.

765
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,826
Oh, okay, I got it. What's the cookie?

766
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,787
It's a metaphor. For what?

767
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,372
For...

768
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,917
Oh. (GASPS) Oh!

769
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,128
Yes. The cookie! The cookie!

770
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,379
I got it. The cookie!

771
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,298
MYA: I'm telling you, the
power's in the cookie.

772
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,675
So, how do we control the cookie?

773
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,427
By putting it in the cookie jar,

774
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,971
clasping the lid on tight,
and leaving it in there.

775
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,139
Okay.

776
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,058
Until some little boy actually
grows up and earns it.

777
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,184
I get it.

778
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,020
It's kind of like when my cousin
had the five-date rule.

779
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,354
It was similar to that.

780
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,647
Oh, no. That's child's play.

781
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,733
I'm thinking something a
little bit more radical.

782
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,234
See, this is why you need to get the book,

783
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,861
because it has a whole chapter on it.

784
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,822
"Getting The Respect That You
Deserve: The 90-Day Rule."

785
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,948
Are you high?

786
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,950
No. Who is waiting 90 days?

787
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,411
If it's good enough for the
Fortune 500 company,

788
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,787
it's good enough for me.

789
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,581
See, when I worked at Ford Motor Company,

790
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,666
there was a 90-day probation rule.

791
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,835
I had to be on the job for 90 days

792
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,503
before they gave me a benefit package.

793
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,798
Ford figured this, "Let's
see how he performs.

794
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,926
"If he comes in on time,
if he proves himself,

795
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,845
"then we'll give him benefits."

796
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,640
So if Ford Motor Company waits 90 days

797
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,975
to pass out their benefit package,

798
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,685
why won't women wait?

799
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,895
You see, that's our problem.

800
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,647
It's that we keep giving it away

801
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,440
to some Axe body spray wearing man-ho

802
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,691
who thinks my name's Melanie.

803
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,527
But it doesn't matter, because
a girl's got needs.

804
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,862
Listen to yourself.

805
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,531
Do you really think you
could wait 90 days?

806
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,659
Yes. I spent six months dreaming

807
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,702
about a guy that I met once
at a wedding weekend.

808
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,537
The one you had sex with at the beach?

809
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,790
Yes, who never called.

810
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah, so, I definitely think
I could do 90 days.

811
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,211
Matter of fact, I could do
90 days before 90 days.

812
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,962
I am so sick and tired of men.

813
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,506
Maybe I should start dating women.

814
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,966
My God, I'll give you 50
bucks if you guys kiss.

815
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,219
But there has to be tongue.
Boy, get out of here!

(LAUGHING) Like, what?

819
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,268
I ask myself that same question every day.

820
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,604
Whatever happened to respect for women?

821
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,107
Whatever happened to decorum?

822
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,901
May I have the honor of buying
you two lovely ladies a drink?

823
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,237
Absolutely. And thank you for asking.

824

We would like... Why?

825
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,616
Is it that you crave scintillating
conversation?

826
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,159
Or that you want to discuss the politics

827
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,577
and nuances of the Chechnyan War?

828
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,955
You know, I don't really discuss
politics on the first encounter.

829
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,124
And neither do we. This is why I'm...
Oh, no, I know what it is.

832
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,421
you wanted to get into my pants?

833
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,547
Absolutely not.

00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,173
Yeah, but then, what is it?

Thank you.

Funny guy, huh?

1054
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,525
I do okay.

1055
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,198
Hey, look, I think there's
a few basic questions

1056
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,574
that every woman should ask a man

1057
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,284
to determine two things,

1058
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,911
if this guy has a plan for you,

1059
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,664
or if this guy is just
gonna play with you.

1060
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,250
My short-term goals?

1061
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,377
What, you mean like tomorrow?

1062
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,631
I need a bong hit.

MICHAEL: To answer your question,

1064
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,760
I guess my long-term goals and short-term
goals are the same thing.

1065

CANDACE: How so?

1066
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,097
Well, my entire life,

1067
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,684
it's always been about hard
work and improving myself

1068
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,228
and I guess what I'm looking for now is,

1069
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,397
you know, someone I can share it with.

1070
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,732
So... So, have you...

1071
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,234
You go ahead, you go. You go.

get right to dessert.

1077

you know? Really?

1078
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,875
This is a great choice.

1079
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,086

1081

What do you do?

1082
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,757
I'm in management.

Yeah. But I don't wanna talk about
me, my work. Long week.

1085
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,932
So, tell me about you. What do you do?

1086
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,436
Um... I'm a chef.

1087

Really? Where?

1088
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,606
Well, I'm actually

1089
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:44,070

offers. That good, huh?

1090
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,364
Yeah. But I don't wanna...

Sorry, that's work.

1104
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,605
No, that's a dream.

1105
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,691
We can talk about dreams. Dreams are good.

1106

It's nice to hear a woman
actually say that.

any dream come true

hard enough to get it.

the future, Jeremy?

This bitch is crazy.

1230
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,454

1232
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,926
Morning, beautiful.

1233
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,053
Hi.

1234
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,514
Thanks.

1235
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:27,598
I, um...

1236
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,058
I made you breakfast.

1237
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,435
Seriously?

1238
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,019
Yeah.

1239
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,605
From my kitchen? Let me take that.

1240
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,984
It's a simple eggs Florentine,
but with a twist,

1241
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,695
because I used the ingredients
from your Thai takeouts.

1242
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,988
Simple? This looks amazing.

1243
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,239
Well, let me know what you think.

1244
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,617
Mmm.

1245
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,369
This is so good.

1246
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,496
Yeah? Well, I love a woman who can eat.

1247
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,375
And I love a man who can cook.

1248
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,711
Maybe you'll let me do it
again for you sometime.

1249
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,171
(COUGHS)

1250
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,714
Juice, please?

1251
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,550
A little spicy?

1252
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,847
Thanks.

1253
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,559
Who's that?

1254
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,061
That's my best friend, Candace.

1255
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,563
Okay. And my godson, Duke.

1256
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,609
You know, you're not exactly
what I picture

1257
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,819
when I hear the word "godmother."

1258
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,197
Thank God for that.

1259
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,249
You let yourself in again, huh?

1260
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,460
I didn't expect you to be here.

1261
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,086
I figured you'd be tiptoeing
around her place.

1262
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,547
Well, first of all, I live here, not you,

1263
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,925
and second, she has this five-date rule

1264
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,176
before I get invited up.

1265
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,344
Can you believe that?

1266
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,471
I'm the Negro Gigolo, the original Nigolo.

1267
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,680
Five dates?

1268
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,432
What, is she some type of Farrakhan
Muslim or something?

1269
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,600
She's a diva.

1270
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,851
She literally refuses to
walk through a door

1271
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,977
unless I open it for her.

1272
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,354
Gail used to do that.

1273
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,855
Gail used to get on my nerves with that.

1274
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,858
"Get the door for me. How am I walk
in and you ain't open the door?"

1275
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,778
"My hands hurt. You better
open that goddamn door!"

1276
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,029
That's why I'm gonna end it right now.

1277
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,155
Yeah, you need to.

1278
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,281
'Cause you don't need her.

1279
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,741
You got me, and what we got is special.

1280
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,660
Open her door. (SCOFFS)

1281
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,538
It's 2012. Come around and open my door.

1282
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,373
I don't know, Sonia, I just felt
like a different woman.

1283
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,417
I felt so in control and strong, and...

1284
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,794
What about him?

1285
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,920
Well, I think...

1286
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,129
Oh.

1287
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,633
It's him.

1288
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,970
"Are you available for dinner
tomorrow night?"

1289
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,096
Well, are you?

1290
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,848
Well, I do believe that I am.

1291
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,476
But I do not go out with guys
who ask me via text.

1292
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,729
She trippin'.

1293
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,815
You know, Gail always suggested
them egg whites,

1294
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,275
she said they was better for you.

1295
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,819
Hey, can you put a shirt on
while you cooking, man?

1296
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,487
(WHOOPS)

1297
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,738
Look at these hours.

1298
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,866
What you come in here glowing
for like you're pregnant?

1299
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,242
My boys.

1300
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,871
Hey, you got some. Oh! On the first date?

1301
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:55,997
Homie scored.

1302
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,707
DOMINIC: Yeah, I did.

1303
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,084
And I'm totally screwed.

1304
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,627
We never once talked about my job.

1305
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,338
You really like him. I really do.

1306
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,883
I don't even know how much he makes.

1307
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,051
Whoa! And you know what? I don't care!

1308
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,720
I believe in his dreams.

1309
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,847
She thinks I'm a chef on the rise.

1310
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,056
With a cold-ass Benz.

1311
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,850
And a sexy limo driver. I
looked good last night,

1312
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,184
I had the hat cocked to the side.

1313
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,104
Guys, she's going to run when
I tell her the truth.

1314
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,106
Whatever you do, you don't
tell her the truth.

1315
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,232
Thank you. You delay.

1316
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,192
Hell, I wouldn't tell her until
she was in her third trimester.

1317
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,986
Yeah, I can't do that. ZEKE:
Dom, I know you, okay?

1318
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,529
And you're trying to grow
a conscience here.

1319
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,864
Trust me on this one.

1320
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,365
Honesty is overrated, man.

1321
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,409
Hey, that's in the Bible. Old Testament.

1322
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,787
I just don't want a relationship
based on lies.

1323
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,122
That's called marriage.

1324
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,832
Dom, you don't fool me.

1325
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,459
I know what this is about.
This is about sex.

1326
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,210
You didn't do what you were supposed
to do in the bedroom.

1327
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,378
That's why you walk through here

1328
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,713
with your shoulders all slouched

1329
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,381
and your self-esteem all low.

1330
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,133
It's true. When you don't smash right,

1331
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,509
the insecurities come out on you.

1332
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,386
You know what he did? He gave it a LD.

1333
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,888
Lazy Doodle. That's exactly what he did.

1334
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,307
Right. You gotta put it down
like the right enforcement.

1335
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,185
I can't do this no more. I'm
done. I'm done with this.

1336
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,354
Like, dude, put a shirt on. It's us!

1337
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,439
There's no one else here, just us!

1338
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,233
So, you're telling me she's got a son?

1339
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,277
Yeah! Duke. He's six years old.

1340
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,737
An amazing kid, full of energy.

1341
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,948
That's an awful lot of
responsibility, baby.

1342
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,116
Well, she's a really responsible
woman, Ma.

1343
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,285
I'm not talking about her,
I'm talking about you.

1344
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,580
You really think you got what it takes

1345
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,123
to date a single mother?

1346
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,417
Well, I was raised by a single
mother, wasn't I?

1347
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,502
(CHUCKLES)

1348
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,796
Oh, but I'm one of a kind, baby.

1349
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,549
Trust me, Ma. You are going to love her.

1350
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,802
(MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE
TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1351
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,345
Thank God!

1352
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,931
Somewhere familiar.

1353
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,265
Some place that hasn't changed,

1354
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,433
that still looks the same.

1355
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,310
Yo, J, what's wrong with you?

1356
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,437
My Fortress of Solitude has morphed

1357
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,064
into a damn Bed, Bath and Beyond.

1358
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,232
What does that mean?

1359
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,441
I'm telling you, he talks in code.

1360
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,402
Listen, Kristen, she redecorated.

1361
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,362
CEDRIC: Redecorated? Why
didn't you say that?

1362
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,072
No, no, no, she didn't redecorate.

1363
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,407
She obliterated.

1364
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,368
Every trace of my identity,
gone! My anime posters,

1365
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,412
Battlestar Galactica shot glasses
that you used to like,

1366
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,705
it's all gone.

1367
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,914
May I?

1368
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,165
Wait a minute. She ain't even ask you?

1369
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,458
She just threw your stuff out?

1370
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,711
That's some takeover shit right
there. That's crazy.

1371
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,046
I was starting to feel like someone else.

1372
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,550
Someone warm and modern with
a smattering of vintage.

1373
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,969
That's probably your lips
tingling. It's a STD.

1374
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,762
You just put your mouth on Zeke's drink.

1375
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,723
Oh! And she threw away
my couch! Thank God!

1376
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,391
(ALL CHEER)

1377
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,976
Hail Kristen!

1378
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,310
That couch has a lot of memories, guys.

1379
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,395
CEDRIC: Is that what that smell was?

1380
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,980
Yeah, all of us got laid on that couch.

1381
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,106
Twice.

1382
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,691
You've had that couch since
college, right? Yes!

1383
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,900
That's some white boy shit.

1384
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,277
No, that's some Jeremy shit.

1385
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,403
ZEKE: No, that's some white boy shit.

1386
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,613
I graduated college, I
got rid of my couch.

1387
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,948
What college did you go to?

1388
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,784
DeVry, Class of February. Valedictorian.

1389
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:39,994
Whose side are you on?

1390
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,163
Ain't no brother on the planet
gonna let no fine-ass sista

1391
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,914
sit on no stinky-ass couch from college.

1392
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,958
Preach, boy! It don't matter what happen,

1393
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,376
you go and you find a way
to get that furniture,

1394
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,627
figure how to pay for it later.

1395
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,422
Yeah, don't do that, though. That's called
negro shit. Don't ever do that.

1396
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,673
BENNETT: That is negro shit!

1397
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,799
You guys do that a lot.

1398
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,967
You pay for something you can't afford.

1399
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,470
Ced, you couldn't even
afford your wedding!

1400
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,180
I'm making my payments.

1401
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,431
Listen, Kristen is a great girl.

1402
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,100
Don't mess up something good over
a damn couch, all right?

1403
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,685
Something's up.

1404
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,771
CEDRIC: The game was on,

1405
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,397
but not the one we were watching.

1406
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,399
While we were sitting there on our asses

1407
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,609
watching the game,

1408
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,235
our team was getting destroyed.

1409
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,571
The other team was drawing up plays,

1410
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,031
planning their strategies,

1411
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,325
and plotting their next moves.

1412
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,786
Hey, you.

1413
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,329
JEREMY: You still up?

1414
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,872
I thought you were sleeping.

1415
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,084
I couldn't put this down.

1416
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,293
Mmm. Yeah.

1417
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,879
CEDRIC: Jeremy didn't even
know he was under attack.

1418
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,715
Hey, uh... God, it was such a trip.

1419
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,259
I ran into Sarah's little brother. Oh.

1420
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,845
And he told me he got a job at Neversoft.

1421
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,306
Cool.

1422
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,474
Yeah.

1423
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,602
Weren't you offered an
internship there once?

1424
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,480
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Turned it
down for a real job.

1425
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,983
Right, yeah, that junior level
one that you're still in.

1426
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,485
What?

1427
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,780
(SIGHS)

1428
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,867
CEDRIC: My brothers didn't even
know they were at war.

1429
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,954
They were lost in the honeymoon phase.

1430
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,705
They were too busy enjoying the ride.

1431
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,958
All right, who's hungry?

1432
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,293
I'm hungry, but, babe, babe!

1433
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,920
Damn! Look at that ass!

1434
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,296
ZEKE: That's nice. She's hot.

1435
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,589
Guys, come on, that's somebody's daughter.

1436
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,091
Wait, that's the baby mama?

1437
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,425
Mmm-hmm. That's Candace?

1438
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,718
That is Candace.

1439
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,220
I know the baby mama.

1440
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,307
No, she's Lauren's best friend.

1441
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,269
LAUREN: So, apparently they play basketball
three times a week at the Y,

1442
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,689
and Dominic says that Michael is the
most successful guy he knows.

1443
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,649
Really? (LAUGHS) You scored!

1444
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,776
I did well? You know what,

1445
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,404
Michael said Dominic is
a really amazing chef.

1446
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,115
I know, I know! I love food.

1447
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,825
Oh, no, bitch. What?

1448
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,618
We can double date.

1449
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,078
(BOTH SCREAM)

1450
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,664
Oh, that's not good.

1451
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:49,957
That's not good at all.

1452
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,375
Let's go play basketball, guys.

1453
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,501
Yeah, let's do that.

1454
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,086
ZEKE: Whatever you do, don't double date.

1455
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,422
That's right. Damn, Ced.

1456
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,382
Really?

1457
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,176
I was in the middle of getting dressed.

1458
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,219
J, you're losing the game for us!

1459
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,722
Me? Yo, you are killing us right now.

1460
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,182
I'm setting screens, you gotta
be using the screens.

1461
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,433
You shot one for 27.

1462
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,143
The shot I made was a game changer, J.

1463
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,644
That's it, I'm done. New teams next week.

1464
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,188
I'm not being on his team anymore.

1465
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,814
I'm not the one that's not
coming off the picks!

1466
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,399
Excuse me, y'all done here?

1467
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,817
We want to play some full court.

1468
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,943
Oh, yeah. Y'all take it.

1469
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,737
No, no, no, we're not.

1470
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,780
Got a lot more basketball to
play over here, fellas,

1471
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,074
so looks like you picked the wrong
court to try and come and take.

1472
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,534
We just ran three games! Uh-uh!

1473
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,536
MICHAEL: Yeah, Ced, we're
good. No, we're not.

1474
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,830
We are not good. Sorry.

1475
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,957
Yo, so y'all stepping off or what?

1476
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,375
Yeah, we were stepping.
I was stepping on...

1477
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,502
Stepping off? Who are you, Shaft?

1478
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,046
How about you get some language
from this year?

1479
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,965
So why don't you, and the stronger
version of Prince,

1480
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,175
go back down to that side of the court

1481
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,384
and do what y'all was doing?

1482
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,719
'Cause if y'all want the court,

1483
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,179
you'll play us for the
court like real men.

1484
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,430
So y'all want to play for it.

1485
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,806

00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,309

Turn around and say you're sorry.

It's too late. We're in it. Apologize.

No, I'm not apologizing for shit.

I really tried to take it. It was obvious.

1507

I really did. I swear to God,
I gave it everything I had.

1508

I sprained my esophagus in the last game,

1509
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,520
so I'm gonna sit this one out.

have to play with five.

You sleep over?

1578
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,384
Just on Sunday nights, baby. It's nothing.

1579
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:15,013
And Sunday nights have always
been reserved for his mother.

1580
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,683
And they always will be.

1581

about our childhoods and art and music,

1659

01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,349
May I remind you, Miss Thing,

1706
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,184
that we were both waitresses

for two years at Olive Garden?

1708
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,647
Candace, we were in college.

1709
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,941
I'm talking about a grown-ass man,

1710
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,695
who admitted that he was valet-parking
the Benz he chased me down in.

1711
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,280
It's kind of romantic.

1712
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,031
It's kind of pathetic.

1713
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,616
I thought you didn't care
about how much he made.

1714
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,201
I thought you believed in his dreams.

1715
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,578
But not his pipe dreams. Come on!

1716
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,829
Okay, fine.

1717
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,415
Dump the first guy who puts
you before anything else

1718
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,624
because he doesn't make six figures.

1719
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,294
Please, he doesn't even make four.

1720
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,546
And I can't invest that kind
of time in something

1721
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,840
that I know won't yield
tangible dividends.

1722
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,216

not a stock portfolio.

1724

1725
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,348
there's no such thing as the perfect man.

1726
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,058
You have to compromise on something.

1727
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,351
What do you have to lose?

1728

My youth.

1729
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,646
So, wait. She just canceled on you?

1730
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,982
She was about to. Then she got
interrupted by her boss.

1731
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,984
It's messed up. You know what?

1732
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,737
Who needs her whole fancy presentation

1733
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,322
and her board of directors?

1734
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,699
I make an honest living
and I pay my taxes.

1735
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,909
Most of the time.

1736
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,535
Let me tell you something,
Dom. I agree with you.

1737
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,704
I'm an American, too and I agree
with your plight, brother.

1738

01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,508
He already has a woman in his life.

1746
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,426
Oh, that son of a bitch. Who is it?

1747
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:27,677
His mama.

enough for your mom.

root for is the baby mama?

that you don't want to come in
between him and his mother

and that if he wants to
continue dating you,

1766
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,382
then you must be a priority in his life.

I can't compete with that.

I know. I'm gonna get you a plate,

1913
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,497
but clear all this off, first.

1914
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:48,706
All right, all right.

1915
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,834
And make sure that sweet potato pie...

1916
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,878
LORETTA: I will, little boy,
you just clear the counter.

1917
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,672
Mom, what is this?

1918
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,133
That's that book by that big-head boy

1919
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,176
that's on that Family Feud thing.

1920
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,011
Act Like something, Think
Like something else.

1921
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,221
It's the new read for my book club.

1922
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:05,056
CEDRIC: Every war has its turning point.

1923
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:08,560
In the Civil War, it was the
Battle of Gettysburg.

1924
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,271
World War Il,

1925
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,022
it was the Invasion of Normandy.

1926
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,401
The definitive turning point in this war

1927
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:17,735
was that night at Loretta's house.

1928
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,112
It was like finding the Holy Grail.

1929
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,115
Jeremy. Tell them to turn the bus around.

1930
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,992
CEDRIC: The power had just
shifted in our favor.

1931
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:25,285
But we didn't know that yet.

1932
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,203
"Why Men Do What They Do."
Look at this, guys.

1933
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,872
Steve Harvey is a traitor.

1934
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:31,624
Hey, look, "Mama's Boys."
Chapter 7. That's you.

1935
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:32,876
I'm not a Mama's Boy.

1936
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,210
Jer, you don't think I'm
a Mama's Boy, do you?

1937
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:35,712
Nah. ZEKE: Listen to this.

1938
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,297
"Men respect standards, get some."

1939
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:38,882
I prefer my women not to have standards.

1940
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,133
In fact, if I've got to choose,

1941
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,843
I'm gonna choose the woman
who has no standards.

1942
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,596
Hold up. "Until a man achieves his
goals, or is on the road to,

1943
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,806
"you will never be number
one in his life."

1944
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,308
See, that's not even true.

1945
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,059
I've achieved absolutely nothing

1946
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,477
and I still put my women first.

1947
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,396
This is sick. It's brainwashing,
I'm telling you.

1948
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,523
She's trying to push me towards my dreams

1949
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,192
and help me accomplish my goals.

1950
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,526
Why would she do this?

1951
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,944
Shit, at least you're getting some.

1952
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,821
Ninety days, that's not a probation,

1953
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,072
that's a death sentence.

1954
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,449
CEDRIC: Hell, yeah, I want
to taste your yams.

1955
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,826
Hey, Mike, how old is your mom?

1956
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:07,952
What?

1957
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:09,412
No, not like that.

1958
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,623
No, it is. It is like
that. How old is she?

1959
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,083
I come in the house, she's like, "You
want to eat?" I said, "Eat what?"

1960
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,585
Yo, first of all, put my plate down

1961
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:16,794
and stop hitting on my mom, man.

1962
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,463
Don't get mad at me! I don't
even wanna be here.

1963
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,590
Y'all the ones that wanna be here,
I want to go to the strip club!

1964
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:21,925
Man, wrap this up.

1965
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,177
I got a bunch of ones, and
somebody gonna get them.

1966
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:27,931
Ms. Loretta! I'm ready for
the rest of the tour.

1967
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,227
You guys are so screwed.

1968
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,270
And honestly, there's nothing
you can do about it.

1969
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:35,480
Maybe we can.

1970
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,148
They got our playbook, man.

1971
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,691
They know all of our maneuvers.

1972
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:40,818
Yeah, but they don't know

1973
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,779
that we know that they know our maneuvers.

1974
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,530
You see why I don't hang out
with Jeremy by himself?

1975
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:45,949
I don't ever know what he's talking about.

1976
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:47,825
Guys! It's like the Patriots,

1977
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,203
when Bill Belichick stole the Jets' plays.

1978
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,372
Right, and they got busted. Yeah,
but they won the game.

1979
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:55,375
And where'd they end up? The Super Bowl.

1980
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,960
I wish I knew what you was talking about.

1981
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,128
We use Steve Harvey's words against them.

1982
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:00,755
We pretend to give them what they want

1983
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,173
so we get what we want.

1984
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,549
We lie to them.

1985
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,343
Exactly.

1986
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,137
This is war, gentlemen.
There are no rules.

1987
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:10,974
CEDRIC: Like the great Khan
once said, not Genghis,

1988
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:13,309
I'm talking about the Latin
guy from Star Trek Il.

1989
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,812
"Revenge is a dish best served cold."

1990
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,481
CANDACE: Michael, I need to
get something off my chest.

1991
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,817
You know what? Before you get
something off your chest,

1992
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,652
I gotta get something off my chest.

1993
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,737
You know I can be a bit of a Mama's Boy?

1994
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,824
I think it really all started
when my dad died.

1995
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:31,536
It was a rough time for us, you know?

1996
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:35,248
And my mom just started relying
on me for so many things.

1997
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:36,666
Too many things.

1998
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,419
You know, I had to be the man of the house

1999
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:41,045
at a really young age

2000
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,714
and I guess maybe that's
why we're so close.

2001
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,840
Michael.

2002
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,217
And I guess, I guess what I'm
trying to say is this.

2003
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,680
I want you to be the number
one woman in my life.

2004
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:51,931
CEDRIC: It was like taking a test

2005
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,308
you already had the answers to.

2006
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:56,686
You're my priority, Candace. All right?

2007
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,021
Yeah.

2008
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,898
All right. Now, you said you wanted
to talk about something.

2009
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:03,735
Did I?

2010
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,862
CEDRIC: The women had no chance.

2011
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:08,114
They were like putty in our hands.

2012
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:12,910
So, I just updated my résumé,
and sent it off to Neversoft.

2013
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:14,912
Really? Mmm-hmm.

2014
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,122
You're serious?

2015
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,874
I was intrigued by a job posting

2016
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,542
I saw in Adweek and I thought,

2017
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,918
"Why not go for it, Jeremy?

2018
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,378
"You have nothing else to lose."

2019
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,213
Baby, that's awesome, that's wonderful.

2020
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,882
I'm so proud of you.

2021
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,717
Oh, my God. Don't get too excited, okay?

2022
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,093
It's just a feeler.

2023
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,720
Probably won't even call me in.

2024
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,263
No, you're selling yourself short.

2025
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,307
Jeremy, you were the best
in your class at Parsons,

2026
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:35,892
you're a brilliant designer.

2027
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,895
No. You're a brilliant artist.
They'd be lucky to have you.

2028
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,772
I'm lucky to have you.

2029
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,649
You are? Mmm-hmm.

2030
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:46,652
You know what I was just thinking?

2031
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:47,779
What?

2032
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,572
Nobody's had sex on this couch yet.

2033
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:50,990
What?

2034
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,909
No, it's a virgin couch. Really?

2035
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:53,993
Mmm-hmm.

2036
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,328
What do you think we should do about that?

2037
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,121
There's about 10 things I think
we can do about that.

2038
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,247
Only 10?

2039
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:00,583
You'll be crying out like
a bitch after three.

2040
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,085
Now I'm scared.

2041
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,461
I love this couch.

2042
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:04,921
CEDRIC: After careful study,

2043
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,839
Dominic realized there was only one man

2044
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,257
who could impress the Alpha Female.

2045
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:10,134
"The Guy With Potential." Zeke.

2046
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,345
What? I have to show her
I'm a man with a plan.

2047
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,180
Well, just make some shit up, dude. No.

2048
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,807
Remember that restaurant idea I had? Yeah.

2049
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,767
I need you to help me
with a business plan.

2050
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,602
Cook for her. Dummy.

2051
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,938
I already did. Breakfast.

2052
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,981
I ain't talking about no breakfast, boy!

2053
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,525
Something fancy, Dom.

2054
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:29,362
Like, like one of them dishes
with an apostrophe in it.

2055
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,613
Is that your robe?

2056
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:32,490
ZEKE: Yeah.

2057
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:33,616
Man, you here again?

2058
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:37,453
Yes! Ass Factory don't open up 'til
10:00, so I got time to waste.

2059
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,580
Bitch, move in already. What'd you say?

2060
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:40,706
Huh?

2061
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:41,958
I'm sorry if I want to
be around my friends

2062
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,459
when I'm going through a divorce.

2063
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:44,710
What was I thinking?

2064
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,170
You're something else, boy.

2065
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:49,257
Look, Gail used to love it when I would
cook for her. It turned her on.

2066
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,092
You can do all types of
things in the kitchen.

2067
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,802
We had a little food thing
that we would do.

2068
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,221
I would go and get some chocolate-covered
strawberries, right?

2069
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:58,433
Then I would come downstairs,
I have a G-string on.

2070
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,935
You know what I'm talking about.
She used to love it.

2071
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,147
So, the game was "Balance the Berry."

2072
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:06,691
I would put it on the...

2073
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:08,734
But the way it's...

2074
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,571
The berry ain't gonna stay there for long.

2075
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:13,322
The berry wouldn't stay on, so...

2076
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:18,161
The point that I'm making is this, Dom.

2077
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,997
Food is your art. Stick
with what you know.

2078
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:22,999
Mmm.

2079
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,459
It's good milk, Zeke.

2080
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:27,587

a 90-day probation.

I was gonna tell you. Oh,
were you gonna tell me?

2403
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:22,332
Yes, I was gonna tell you. But then,
I thought I might amend it.

'Cause I thought you might
actually be the one.

Michael Atwater's phone?

2423
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:18,096
Tandace?

2424
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:19,181
Loretta?

2425
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:24,227
Listen, I'm calling to tell Michael that
I don't need him to take me to church.

2426
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:27,481
Deacon Johnson will be
driving me to church.

2427
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:29,733
Let me talk to him. Is he free?

2428
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,401
He will be.

2429
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:33,737
MICHAEL: Here we go! Oh, slam dunk!

2430
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,238
Michael.

2431
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:37,741
Can I talk to you for a minute?

2432
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:38,992
Uh-oh.

2433
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:40,368
Uh-oh. What?

2434
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:41,536
Ha! You'll see.

2435
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:42,787
Duke, get in the house.

2436
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,915
Baby, did you see that boy's skills?

2437
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:46,208
If I keep on...

2438
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:47,542
What's wrong, baby? What's up?

2439
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:50,295
Your, uh, work just called.

2440
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:53,215
And I thought it might be an
emergency, so I picked up.

2441
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:54,925
But it was just your mom.

2442
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:58,303
Really? You know, the T-Mobile
Top Five be acting up...

2443
01:31:58,471 --> 01:31:59,804
Don't bullshit me, Michael.

2444
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:01,932
Baby, listen, I know how that looks,
but trust me, this isn't...

2445
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:04,142
Trust? I believed you.

2446
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,230
I can't compete with your
mother. And I won't.

2447
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:09,564
You don't have to...

2448
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:11,691
Then why did you look me
in my face and lie?

2449
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:16,530
You need to go.

2450
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:18,532
Baby, listen I...

2451
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:20,200
Get out of my face, Michael.

2452
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,961
CEDRIC: And Candace wasn't the only
one who was all business that day.

2453
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:32,337
Hey, beautiful.

2454
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,965
Hi. How are you?

2455
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:37,175
Um, I have a 2 o'clock, so...

2456
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:38,593
You look stunning.

2457
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:40,095
Thank you.

2458
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,764
So, you said you had some news?

2459
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:45,976
Yeah. My investor friend that
I told you about? Mmm-hmm.

2460
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:49,813
Read your prospectus, loves it, and
wants you to give him a call.

2461
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:51,523
You serious?

2462
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:53,400
I told you it was brilliant.

2463
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:55,860
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2464
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,739
Okay, we gotta go celebrate.
Let's go out tonight.

2465
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:01,658
I'm not free tonight.

2466
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:04,494
Okay, well, what about
tomorrow night, then?

2467
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:07,455
Dominic, I'm gonna hit you
with the headline, okay?

2468
01:33:07,623 --> 01:33:10,709
I recently reconnected with an ex-boyfriend
of mine from college.

2469
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:12,043
Anyway, he just got a divorce

2470
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:13,587
and is moving back to LA and I...

2471
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:14,671
Whoa, whoa.

2472
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:16,590
You breaking up with me?

2473
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:19,968
No! No, I'm not breaking
up, just taking a break.

2474
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:21,511
I need some space. Space.

2475
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,179
Yeah, because we were moving too fast...

2476
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,015
Yeah, you sound like a guy.

2477
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:26,224
What did you say?

2478
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:28,018
I said you sound like a guy.

2479
01:33:28,519 --> 01:33:32,147
Is that why you invited me to this
place? For a business lunch?

2480
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:33,565
So you can have an out-time?

2481
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,150
Dominic, look, I really like you.

2482
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:39,654
Okay? I didn't want to string you
along. Let's just be friends.

2483
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:42,115
Yeah, I don't really need
any more friends, Lauren.

2484
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:46,661
You know, and I really don't need
your friends to let me down easy.

2485
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:48,580
Okay, don't be stupid, Dominic.

2486
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:49,956
That's business, not personal.

2487
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,627
Do you even know the difference?

2488
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:55,003
You know, Lauren, I...

2489
01:33:56,088 --> 01:34:00,967
I never even had a prospectus, you
know? I did it all to impress you.

2490
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:06,431
You inspired me, you motivated me to do
something for myself for the first time.

2491
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:10,310
And all this time, I thought
you were too good for me.

2492
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:13,855
(LAUGHS HUMORLESSLY)

2493
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:27,952
Kris? Picked up some pizza.

2494

(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

2496
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:05,740
What I don't get is just like the book,
I was the guy with potential.

2497
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:09,035
I told her the truth, I put myself out
there, and it still wasn't enough.

2498
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:11,329
At least you didn't get caught
in a flat-out lie.

2499
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,790
Y'all should see how bad things
are with Candace right now.

2500
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:17,210
Kristen wouldn't even look at me
when I showed up at Gina's.

2501
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:18,837
She'll change her mind.

2502
01:35:19,004 --> 01:35:22,298
Nah. You did not see the way
she looked at me. Such...

2503
01:35:22,466 --> 01:35:23,717
Hate? Hurt.

2504
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,636
It's hate. Women will hate you fast.

2505
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:29,597
Either way, fellas. I think we
brought this upon ourselves.

2506
01:35:29,765 --> 01:35:33,727
It was self-defense. They attacked
first! We had to strike back.

2507
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:36,396
We were just protecting our natural-born
right to be men. Am I right?

2508
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:37,939
Right. Right.

2509
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:39,774
Love us or leave us, right?

2510
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:41,359
ALL: Right!

2511
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:43,194
And they left us. Ha!

2512
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:45,613

Your right. My left.

2533
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,678
Not my type.

2534
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:55,266
That's how we do it, Zeke. I line
them up, you mow them down.

2535
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:57,477
Can I have my tab?

a substitute teacher.

(ALL LAUGHING)

2542
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:28,591
I finally sent my résumé over to Neversoft.
I had my meeting today.

2543
01:37:28,759 --> 01:37:31,761
And they just called. I got the job.

2544
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:33,137
Is that right?

2545
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:34,222
Congratulations, man!

2546
01:37:34,306 --> 01:37:37,475
I'm a senior designer at Neversoft.
With full benefits.

2547
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,893
Damn right, and the next step
is the expense card.

2548
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,061
I gotta call Kris.

2549
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,148
She not talking to you, huh?

2550
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:46,025
No. Well, you should call her anyway.

2551
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:48,444
She's the reason it happened, right?

2552
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:50,572
Yeah.

2553
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:51,656
That's good advice, right there.

2554
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,782
How's that project going along?

2555
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,409
It's going great. In fact,

2556
01:37:54,493 --> 01:37:57,328
I'm gonna have to get out of here
soon and go get some work done.

2557
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:59,747
You know what we should do?
We should celebrate, right?

2558
01:37:59,915 --> 01:38:02,208
DOMINIC: Nice. Yes. New job,
first round's on Michael.

2559
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:03,376
Yes. I like that.

2560
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:04,752
No, no. I just had the last round...

2561
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:05,962
This is nice, just the fellas.

2562
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,630
Just like old times.

2563
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:10,550
No, it's not like old times because
I don't have a curfew this time.

2564
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,887
Speaking of curfew, I gotta
go. My night to cook.

2565
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:15,305
CEDRIC: Bennett, you sound like a bitch.

Come on, man!

2568
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,395
I'm not cooking 'cause I have to,

2569
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:23,855
I'm cooking 'cause I want
to, that's my wife.

2570
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:25,148
Come on, now, Bennett.

2571
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:27,275
I'm not saying it like that, I'm
saying just, right now...

2572
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:28,776
Don't be mad at me 'cause I
got a wife at the house.

2573
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:31,362
That means sometimes I can't hang
out all night with you guys,

2574
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:33,698
I gotta go home early then
that's what I gotta do.

2575
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:35,617
I'm just saying.

2576
01:38:35,868 --> 01:38:37,410
I got this round.

2577
01:38:38,203 --> 01:38:39,329
I'm happy for you, congratulations.

2578
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:40,455
Thank you.

You're $20 short, Bennett.

2581
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:47,921
Yeah, no, I used to cook for Gail
on Thursdays. That was my day.

2582
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:50,006
I'm happy we're free. I really am.

2583
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:52,050
I'm telling you right now, we're
better off without them.

2584
01:38:52,217 --> 01:38:53,635
Yeah, I mean, who needs to
put up with their shit?

2585
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,511
And their demands, the nagging...

2586
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,641
The expectations. Expectation is
the catalyst for all of that.

2587
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:00,850
Here we go. CEDRIC: You know what's funny?

2588
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:04,771
Gail used to love it when I cooked
Bolognese sauce from scratch.

2589
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,105
Like, that was her favorite, so...

2590
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:09,359

didn't do it for my benefit.

I did. At first.

2713
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:12,453
But somehow, through all the pretending,

2714
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:15,456
I figured out I wanted it for me.

2715
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:19,293

You were the first person I wanted
to call when I got the news,

2717

and the fact that I couldn't
drove me crazy.

before I go to sleep at night, Kris.

the game. She did what?

No! I was just hoping it would be a start.

You know what? You know, you can't
change a person's nature, Zeke.

That is not true. I know for
a fact that that's not true.

How? Because I want to start over.

2770
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,545
Without sex?

2771
01:47:07,712 --> 01:47:09,630
If that's what it takes.

2772
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:12,091
I don't want the sex, Mya. I want you.

2773
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:13,884
That's bullshit.

2774
01:47:15,971 --> 01:47:18,055
Okay, that's bullshit. Yes!
Of course I want the sex.

2775
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:21,600
But the difference is the sex is all
I wanted before I met you. Now,

2776
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:23,352
I want you.

2777
01:47:24,354 --> 01:47:25,354
Okay?

01:47:25,897 --> 01:47:28,357

Actually, the three of us are going
to Dominic's grand opening.

Oh. He found a backer for his restaurant?

was... It was great.

on the Far East.

day. You know Warren Buffett?
