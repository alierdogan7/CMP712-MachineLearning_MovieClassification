Get... Get...

3
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Up!

4
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,500
You missed!

5
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,800
You missed this time,
you little menace!

6
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,800
I beat you!

7
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Morning.

8
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,800
Honey, you're getting
all upset over nothing.

9
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,100
- I'm not getting...
- Here.

10
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,900
A nice breakfast
will cheer you up.

11
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,900
I am not
getting upset over...

12
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,400
- What is that?
- It's bacon.

13
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
I know it's bacon.

14
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,300
What have you done to it?

15
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,300
You said you didn't like
all the grease from fried bacon...

16
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,700
so I boiled it.

17
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,300
What is Lane doing up
at this hour on a Sunday?

18
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,500
Doesn't he turn to dust
if the sun hits him before noon?

19
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,100
It's tryouts
for the high school ski team.

20
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,600
He's going up
to Mt. Brody with Beth.

21
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,500
Sure he's going up with Beth.

22
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
He can't do anything
without that girl.

23
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,300
I tell you, Jenny,
that boy is obsessed.

24
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Now, honey...

25
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,100
obsessed?

26
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,200
Do we not throw things away
when they're empty?

27
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,200
What in the name
of all that's holy...

28
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,200
Badger likes the prizes
you can get...

29
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,700
from cutting the coupons
from the boxes.

30
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,700
He's mailing them today.

31
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,200
Can't you wait until the...

32
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Lane, a closet door can be closed
as well as it can be opened.

33
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,300
Sorry, Dad.

34
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,800
Dear, your breakfast
is getting cold.

35
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
It's all right, Mom. I can't
have breakfast today. I got tryouts.

36
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,500
Nervous stomach. Don't wanna
throw up from the chairlift again.

37
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Had to buy that guy
a new hat last time. Bye, Dad.

38
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,400
Memorandum. I would like to
take a meeting with you tonight...

39
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,600
to discuss that vehicle
you purchased several months ago...

40
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,500
yet has darkened our driveway,
immobile, ever since.

41
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Okay, Dad. Noted.

42
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Talk to you tonight.
I gotta pick up Beth.

43
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,200
Ricky.

44
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,700
Don't be so shy. Come on.

45
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,600
Monique, this is Ricky.

46
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,100
Ricky, this is Monique...

47
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,500
the French foreign exchange student
who'll be staying with us.

48
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,400
It's an awesome spectacle...

49
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,100
and a vicious display
of seething opponents...

50
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,800
once again paralleled
in an obstinate attempt to prove...

51
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,500
superiority of the roads
unequal in our lifetime.

52
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,000
The crowds swell with anticipation
as the lights turn green!

53
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,100
You stupid bonehead!
I'm gonna activate your dental plan!

54
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Come here, you idiot!
Get out of this car!

55
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,100
If he asks me out,
of course I'm gonna go out with him.

56
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,900
I mean, he skis the K-12.

57
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,700
Yeah. He's so boss.

58
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,600
I'll tell him after tryouts. You
know how he gets when he gets upset.

59
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Yeah. From the chairlift.

60
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,000
He had to buy the guy
a new hat last time.

61
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,200
Lane's here. I gotta go.
I'll call you later. Bye.

62
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,800
He's the only person
in Greendale...

63
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,100
that's ever skied the K-12
from the glacier and lived.

64
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,000
Man, what a hunk.

65
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,000
Listen up.
Your running time has to be...

66
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,800
under 58 seconds to even
be considered for the team.

67
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,600
Your time will be gauged
along with a rating...

68
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,200
of one to ten on your style,
which will be judged solely by me...

69
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,800
and my vast expertise
of skiing technique.

70
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Why don't we have you sorry-looking
lot of hopefuls make your way up.

71
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,100
You future members of the girls'
ski team can all keep me company...

72
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,400
until it's time
for you to take the track.

73
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,600
- Who'd like to hold my clipboard?
- Me! Me!

74
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,100
You'll make a fine little helper.
What's your name?

75
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,900
- Charles De Mar.
- Shut up, geek.

76
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,500
- What's your name?
- Beth.

77
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,500
That's my favorite name.

78
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,800
- Buenos dias. Roy Stalin.
- Hola. Lane Myer.

79
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,700
I can see you and I
share one common desire...

80
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,800
the desire to be a part
of the well-oiled machinery...

81
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
that is the Greendale
High School ski-racing team.

82
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,500
- The desire for victory.
- Well, l...

83
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,700
Right on! Get up there,
and let's see what you got.

84
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,200
- Ready up there?
- Yeah. We're all set.

85
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
What is the next victim's name?

86
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,800
"Myer. Lane Myer."

87
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,600
Is that as in Oscar Mayer?

88
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,500
That's a roger, dude.

89
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,200
You were standing with Oscar.

90
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,800
Is he your main wiener man?

91
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,500
Don't listen to Stalin, kid.
He's a punk.

92
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,500
Now, you show 'em, Rock.

93
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,400
You show 'em how a skier
really skis.

94
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,000
- We're sending him down.
- That's a roger. Counting down.

95
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,000
Drei, fry. Go!

96
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,200
Too bad. Real close. Next.

97
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,600
Listen. I think we should talk.

98
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
We've been seeing an awful lot
of each other lately...

99
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,500
and I really think
it's in my best interest...

100
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,200
if I went out
with someone more popular...

101
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,000
better looking,
drives a nicer car.

102
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,800
Six months! Six months,
and she dumps me for him.

103
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,100
For Stalin.Just like that.

104
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,100
Six damn months!

105
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Truly a sight to behold...
a man beaten.

106
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,700
The once-great champ...

107
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,600
now a study in mawkishness.

108
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
No longer
the victory-hungry stallion...

109
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,900
-All right.
-we've raced so many times before...

110
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,800
but a pathetic...

111
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,600
washed-up, aged ex-champion.

112
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,100
Let's go!

113
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
Someone's gonna see God.

114
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,900
I'm gonna break
your goddamn neck!

115
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Get outta the car!

116
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,800
Get outta the car!

117
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,500
Hello. How was your day?

118
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,400
- Beth broke up with me.
- That's nice.

119
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,400
We're through. That's it.

120
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,200
What the hell?
Wait a minute here.

121
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,300
Wait. This is death here.

122
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
I haven't even been
to New York City.

123
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,500
Jesus. I haven't
even been anywhere.

124
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,600
Suicide is never the answer,
little trooper.

125
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,400
Greendale is a bodaciously
small town.

126
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,800
It's a flyspeck on the map...

127
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,900
a rest stop on the way
to a ski slope.

128
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,400
I can't even get real drugs
here.

129
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,700
Stalin's a hero, the only one
in this town who can ski the K-12.

130
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,100
You're a great skier,
but he's incredible.

131
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,400
What if I ski the K-12?
You think she'd take me back?

132
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
I'm back to suicide again.

133
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,300
I think we're all going
to enjoy this little treat.

134
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,100
I got the recipe
from the Ladies'Home Journal.

135
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,600
The mail got wet in the rain,
so some of the pages ran together.

136
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,700
But what I couldn't read
I improvised with my own ideas.

137
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,400
You see, it's got raisins in it.

138
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,500
You like raisins.

139
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,500
There is still one more thing
I would like to discuss with Lane.

140
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,900
The subject is...

141
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,300
is the mystery car.

142
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,100
Thank you, honey.

143
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,400
Which even as we speak...

144
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,100
darkens our domain
under a moldy tarp.

145
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,800
You do know the car
of which I speak?

146
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,300
- Yeah. I just never...
- Let me refresh your memory.

147
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,700
Cast your mind back.

148
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,200
It's a crisp September morning.

149
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,400
You borrowed $200 from me
to purchase the car...

150
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,700
mainly because
your girlfriend Beth said it was...

151
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,100
I believe the term was "tasty."

152
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,100
Since then, that "tasty" car...

153
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,500
has slept in an auto cocoon
on my front lawn.

154
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,300
I'll get around to it.

155
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,400
Have you seen the exchange student
who's staying at the Smiths's house?

156
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,600
Perhaps you should go over
and welcome her to our town.

157
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,600
I think she would like that.

158
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,000
Mrs. Smith probably got her
so that weirdo son...

159
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
could see what
a real girl looks like.

160
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,100
You know,
he never goes outdoors.

161
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Just sits in that house,
crochets all day long.

162
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,800
The Chapmans had
their exchange student...

163
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,800
stay with them for six months.

164
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,300
He practically became a son
to Jules and Irene.

165
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,300
You mean that kid
from El Salvador?

166
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,900
Can I be excused?
I'm not feeling well.

167
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,900
I'm just gonna be excused.

168
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,900
I can't figure it out, Badger.

169
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,600
You seem smart. Why waste your time
with all this kid-stuff garbage?

170
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
You're almost eight.

171
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,600
It was love at first sight.

172
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,300
Red dog! Red dog!

173
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,500
92, 7 4, 16, 43!

174
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Bring it home, mama!

175
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
Got it! Got it!

176
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
So, how do you
like Greendale?

177
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,600
Fine.

178
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,400
And the school system,
you find it adequate?

179
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,900
School hasn't started yet.

180
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,700
She itched her nose.
I wonder if that was...

181
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,700
some kind of message to me
that there's something on my nose.

182
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,500
That's funny.
He wiped his nose after I did.

183
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,700
Maybe I got dirt on my nose
when I itched it.

184
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,500
God, he's too embarrassed
to tell me.

185
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,000
I must look sickening.

186
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,000
There she goes again.
What could it be?

187
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Dirt? Relish?

188
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,100
Relish on my nose? How gross.

189
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,100
- She might think it's...
- Usually Nazis.

190
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,800
Not that. Please don't
let it be a booger.

191
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,600
Not now. Please, God.

192
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,500
I don't get it. How could...

193
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
How could she
throw away six months?

194
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,800
I mean, six months?

195
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,500
Just like that?

196
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,100
No explanation, no reason.

197
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,100
Just throw it away.

198
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
Doesn't...

199
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
How can you just
throw away six months?

200
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,100
I mean, when you're
in love with someone...

201
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,900
Six months is just...
I'm history.

202
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,400
Just bam!
Like that, I'm gone.

203
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,900
She's probably just testing me.

204
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,900
A big test.

205
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,700
That's probably... That's her.

206
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,300
That's her.

207
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,000
-Johnny.
- Four weeks.

208
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,900
Twenty papers.
That's two dollars.

209
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,600
- Plus tip.
- I don't have a dime. Sorry.

210
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,100
Didn't ask for a dime.

211
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,500
Two dollars.

212
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,900
Well, it's funny, see.
My mom had to leave early...

213
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,300
to take my brother to school
and my dad to work 'cause...

214
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,100
Two dollars. Cash.

215
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
The problem here is...
my little brother, this morning...

216
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,900
got his arm caught
in the microwave and...

217
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,700
and my grandmother dropped acid
and freaked out...

218
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,500
and hijacked a school bus
full of penguins.

219
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,500
So it's kind of a family crisis.

220
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,500
So come back later? Great.

221
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,100
Breakin'up is hard to do

222
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,800
Don't take your love...

223
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,300
- To me, and she's gone
-And she's gone

224
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Fifty ways to leave your lover

225
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Hurts so bad

226
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,200
They say that breakin'up
is hard to do...

227
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:10,200
The three cardinal
trapezoidal formations...

228
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,500
hereto made orientable
in our diagram...

229
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
by connecting
the various points...

230
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,700
HIGK, PEGQ and LMNO...

231
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,000
creating our geometric
configurations...

232
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,500
which have no properties,
but with location...

233
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,500
are equal to
the described triangle CAB...

234
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,000
quintuplicated.

235
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,500
Therefore...

236
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,600
it is also
the five triangles...

237
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,400
composing
the aforementioned NIGH.

238
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,600
Each are equal to the triangle
CAB in this geometric concept.

239
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,100
Therefore, in a like manner...

240
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,500
the geometric metaphors...

241
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
can derive
a repeated vectoral sum.

242
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,100
This was your assignment...

243
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,800
and I would like
to see the results.

244
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,900
Please, take them out.

245
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,600
Oops.

246
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,100
Sophia.

247
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,100
- And Buster.
- Please!

248
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,700
- Me! Me!
- And... Beth.

249
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,100
- And...
- Please! Please!

250
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,700
- Please, please!
- Mr. Myer.

251
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,700
Please join us
at the blackboard...

252
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,200
and show us your solution
to this paltry geometric dilemma.

253
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,700
Sorry.

254
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,100
For God's sakes,
would you relax?

255
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,300
- It's just our virginity.
- Yeah, I agree totally.

256
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,500
I feel like we should tell someone
or do something.

257
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,100
I can get my dad's Polaroid
or something.

258
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
- What was that?
- What was what?

259
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,600
I heard something.

260
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,300
We're in the most secluded place
in the Northern Hemisphere.

261
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,800
I assure you
we are totally alone.

262
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,100
Come on.

263
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,600
What's wrong?

264
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,200
That thing I put on me...
it broke.

265
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,900
Broke? It broke?

266
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,800
- Take it easy. I'll buy a new one.
- I don't want a new one!

267
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,100
- Do you know what that means?
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

268
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,100
Now, now.
I'll see you all tomorrow.

269
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Just remember to memorize pages
39 to 110 for tomorrow's lesson.

270
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,400
- All right!
- Cool!

271
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,900
I just can't wait
till tomorrow.

272
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Wait for me at my locker.

273
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,500
Listen...

274
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,900
I've been thinking about what
you told me last night...

275
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,100
and I've decided
I'm gonna help you.

276
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,600
How?

277
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,300
I've been going to this high school
for 7 1/2 years.

278
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,100
I'm no dummy.

279
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,400
I know high school girls.

280
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,100
Two things. One...

281
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
how about your sax?

282
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,800
The thing about Roy is
he plays the guitar.

283
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,400
- He does?
- Yeah. Girls love that.

284
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,500
- Why don't you take up sax again?
- Number two?

285
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,600
The K-12, dude.

286
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,000
You make a gnarly run
like that...

287
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,400
and girls will get sterile
just looking at you.

288
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,400
Would you stay behind?
I'd like a word with you.

289
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,200
We'll do this.

290
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,000
Talk to you later.

291
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,300
Yes, sir?

292
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,800
This is a bit awkward.

293
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,300
Yes, sir.

294
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,300
Well...

295
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,700
I've heard a few things, and...

296
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Well, I was wondering...

297
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
if you would mind
if I took out Beth.

298
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
And I love you so much

299
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,200
'Cause I met you
in first grade

300
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,100
Yes, I love you

301
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
What'd you go
and do that for?

302
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,100
Really. Why?

303
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,400
That's sick.

304
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,900
"Sick"? I love you.
How could you dump me for him?

305
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,400
Face it.
You're a no-show, a loss.

306
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,800
You're immature. You can't do
a single thing by yourself.

307
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,100
You're a spastic Nerf bag
all the time.

308
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,900
And besides,
Roy can ski the K-12.

309
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,400
How could I enjoy high school
with you as a boyfriend?

310
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Any girl in this school would be
overwhelmed to go out with me.

311
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Chris Cummins?
You haven't got a chance.

312
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,000
- She'd go out with me in a second.
- Listen, you forget.

313
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,500
Chris Cummins dates
the basketball team.

314
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,700
Not certain members of the team.
The whole team.

315
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,000
You so much as talk to her,
you're dead.

316
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
So let's just say
you give it up.

317
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Yeah, Oscar Mayer.
I think that's a fine idea.

318
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,800
I will not give it up!

319
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,300
You'll be sorry.
Someday you'll want me back!

320
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,900
Sorry.

321
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,500
I'm gonna get some milk.

322
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,400
Just one milk.

323
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,200
I'll be okay.

324
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,400
Watch this.

325
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,200
- Can I borrow these a minute?
- What's the idea?

326
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,700
Just for a minute.

327
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,200
Here. Buy yourself another leotard.
Be back in a minute, okay?

328
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,400
Excuse me.

329
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,700
I was thinking...

330
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,700
you skate, I skate...
we skate.

331
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,600
- Maybe we could get together and...
- You're a jerk.

332
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,600
be a skating team.

333
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,300
- I was saying before...
- See you later, guys.

334
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,500
Let's go! Let's go!

335
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,800
- What?
- What are you doing?

336
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,800
- Nothing.
- Yes, you are.

337
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,900
Buck up, little camper.

338
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,500
- We'll beat that slope together.
- Yeah?

339
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,700
Yeah.

340
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm right behind ya, buddy.

341
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,100
Man, it's a real shame
when folks be throwin' away...

342
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,500
a perfectly good white boy
like that.

343
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,000
If I could get past this first lip,
the rest would be a breeze.

344
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,700
I'm telling you...

345
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,200
Hold on!
Wait one second.

346
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,300
I think I'm on
to something here.

347
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,200
This is pure snow.
It's everywhere.

348
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,300
Have you any idea what the street
value of this mountain is?

349
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,100
Wait a minute. Hold it.

350
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,700
Outrageous.

351
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,800
I think I froze
the left half of my brain.

352
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,600
Look. I can't move
my right arm.

353
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
- Will you get serious?
- Look, dude...

354
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,800
it's Christmas Eve.

355
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,200
I could be home right now
drinking this monster eggnog...

356
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,200
my brother makes
with lighter fluid.

357
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,100
You've been staring
over that edge for hours.

358
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,500
People die down there.

359
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,900
And dying
when you're not really sick...

360
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,900
is really sick, you know?

361
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,200
This is very important to me.
I mean, really.

362
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,600
If I don't believe in myself,
I'm nothing.

363
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
I'll be as bad as Ricky Smith.

364
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,800
He sits around crocheting all day
and snorting nasal spray.

365
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,500
- I gotta do it!
- He snorts nasal spray?

366
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,400
Know where I can score some?

367
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,300
- Are you gonna help me or not?
- All right. All right.

368
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,300
I'll tell you what to do.

369
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,900
Go that way really fast.

370
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,700
If something gets
in your way, turn.

371
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,900
What a coach.

372
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
I'm gonna do it.

373
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,200
All right! Now turn!

374
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,500
Hello, Beth? Hey, it's Christmas.

375
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,200
I was thinking
maybe me and you could...

376
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,900
No, we didn't open
our presents yet.

377
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,300
You did.

378
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
The cutest thing ever.

379
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,000
From Roy.

380
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,600
A giant teddy bear
bigger than you.

381
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Sounds great.

382
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,400
It really does sound good.

383
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Look, I gotta go.
The Christmas tree's on fire.

384
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,100
Now open this one next.

385
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,200
I remembered
how much you liked...

386
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,700
the chocolate-nut brownie
in this one.

387
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,900
And look, corn in seasoned sauce.
He likes corn.

388
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,900
Now, come on. Don't be shy.
Give her your present.

389
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,700
Come on.
Give her your present.

390
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Come on.

391
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,400
That's a Christmas present.

392
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,300
Do you have Christmas
in France?

393
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,200
Christmas.

394
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Christmas.

395
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,700
Yeah. It's from Ricky.

396
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,500
You can take that
wherever you go...

397
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,800
to always remember your trip
to the United States.

398
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,200
How come you're so small?

399
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,000
Now. Everyone's gonna be
wearing one of these this year.

400
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,100
Honey, what have you done?

401
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,700
There.

402
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,800
It's real aardvark fur.

403
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,800
Really?

404
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,800
Well, honey, it's sure...

405
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,200
warm.

406
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,000
- Now for the best part.
- What?

407
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,000
The hood.

408
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,900
Everybody's gonna be
wearing one of these.

409
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,900
Isn't it fun?

410
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,700
- What is it?
- I'll show you soon. Almost there.

411
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
- You'll see it in a second. Ready?
- Yeah.

412
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,800
- Okay?
- Okay. All right.

413
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,100
Al, you fixed the windows.

414
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,100
It's a Christmas miracle.

415
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,300
Wait a minute, Mr. Bear. This
is crazy. I bet we get her back.

416
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,200
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

417
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,200
Your book on how to
pick up trashy women came today.

418
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,700
Tell me something.

419
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,700
What's a little boy like you
doing with big-boy smut like this?

420
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,300
Hi. I was just wondering...

421
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,800
I know that we don't
even know each other...

422
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,800
but I know that you were going out
with that girl Beth.

423
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,800
I can see that you're not
going out with her anymore...

424
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,000
and I was wondering if perhaps
I could just be with her...

425
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,300
go to the movies,
have a soda.

426
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,200
- Can I talk to you for a moment?
- Yeah.

427
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,200
Come in here and sit down,
please, young man.

428
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,700
- Look, I'm sorry about the garage.
- Let me give you the bottom line.

429
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,100
It would be entirely beneficial...

430
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,100
if you were to reenter
the sociological mainstream...

431
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,900
by reengaging in the ritual act of
dating members of the opposite sex.

432
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,300
I don't wanna date other girls.
I wanna date Beth.

433
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,800
I'm sorry to inform you that you are
going to start dating other girls.

434
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,400
- Starting tonight.
- Oh?

435
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,400
Tonight at 6:00,
you're picking up Joanne Greenwald.

436
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,200
- Your law partner's daughter?
- That's right.

437
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,800
The one with the big antenna
on her face?

438
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,000
Come on.

439
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,100
Mellow off.

440
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,300
It's a brand-new year.

441
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,900
There's a New Year's Eve dance
at your school.

442
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,700
- You kids love this disco thing.
- Disco? Come on, Dad.

443
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,800
You are really...
bringing me over, man.

444
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
- 6:00.
- Right off.

445
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,600
- On.
- On. Right...

446
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,100
All right, Joanne Greenwald,
you horrible thing...

447
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,600
here's your one chance
to go out with a real stud.

448
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,600
One night with me, and she'll
probably go blind with ecstasy.

449
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,100
Poor creature.

450
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,700
I hope she doesn't
grab on to my leg and start...

451
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,700
crying when the date's over.

452
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,700
God, what do you do?

453
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
All right, Joanne Greenwald.

454
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,200
Hi, Joanne.

455
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,700
Pal, let's get something straight.
I don't wanna go out with you...

456
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,700
and I'm just doing this
as a favor to my dad, right?

457
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,100
- I know you're happy to be...
- Right.

458
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,600
So let's make it a whole lot
easier on ourselves, shall we?

459
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,100
First, we'd have gone out to dinner.
That's ten bucks apiece.

460
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,400
Unless you're a cheapskate...

461
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,600
but I'm willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

462
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,200
-Thanks.
-I would've ordered double desserts.

463
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,200
That's $22 altogether.
Tax and tip... 25.

464
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,000
Making it a grand total
of $26.37.

465
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,200
Half of which
is approximately $13.67.

466
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,300
Why don't you give me that 13.67,
and we'll call it a night?

467
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,500
- Do you take checks?
- Sure.

468
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,100
You never know if you're
the victim or the fool

469
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,400
Only know I can't stop
thinkin'about you

470
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,400
Love was good until
you took it on the run

471
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,900
But I fell too hard
I guess I ain't the one

472
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,900
Starin'the night away

473
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Don't know where you are

474
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,700
Callin'out your name

475
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,000
This crazy feelin'

476
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,400
Of a one-way love

477
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,900
You want a sandwich?

478
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,800
Sure?

479
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,900
Face to face
I had no secrets to hide

480
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,700
Well, you sure got my vote
for cutest couple.

481
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,200
Better shave her a little closer
before you kiss her good night.

482
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,900
"You better..."

483
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,000
"You better shave..."

484
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,600
I've been searchin'every day

485
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,500
Tryin'to find another way

486
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,900
I'd be better off dead

487
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,500
Than to live without you

488
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,900
I'd rather be a fool

489
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,500
I'd be lost
with someone new

490
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,500
I'd be better off dead

491
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,800
Than to live without you

492
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,000
I've been searchin'every day

493
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,100
Tryin'to find another way

494
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,300
I'd be better off dead

495
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Than to live without you

496
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,700
I'd rather be a fool

497
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,700
I'd be lost
with someone new

498
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,700
I'd be better off dead

499
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,200
Than to live without you

500
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,200
I've been searchin'every day

501
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,400
Tryin'to find another way

502
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
I'd be better off dead

503
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,400
Than to live without you

504
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,000
I'd rather be a fool

505
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,000
I'd be lost
with someone new

506
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,200
I'd be better off dead

507
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,100
Than to live without you

508
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,400
I'd be tempted

509
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,400
I'd be tempted

510
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,700
I'd be better off dead

511
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,700
Than to live without you

512
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:19,300
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me

513
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,700
I knew right away

514
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,800
I knew right away

515
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,000
It's okay.

516
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,000
I was planning on having my nose
flattened by a professional anyway.

517
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,400
You're that French kid staying with
the dorkheads... Smiths next door.

518
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,600
We're neighbors.

519
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,100
Me Lane.

520
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,200
Monique Junet.

521
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,400
I can't believe
you're here tonight

522
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,900
Who told me dreams
don't work out great

523
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,900
You do speak English,
don't you?

524
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,300
That's okay.
I don't speak French.

525
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,900
I had no idea
where you'd gotten off to.

526
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,900
You shouldn't make me worry.

527
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,600
I see you've made Monique's...
acquaintance.

528
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,500
A number of times, yes. She's
a delightful girl with a firm grip.

529
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,700
Mother will pick us up
at the entrance of the school.

530
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,000
She'll be very disappointed
if we aren't right...

531
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,600
at the entrance
of the school.

532
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,800
Tell you what. Why don't you wait
in the front of the school?

533
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,400
And when Mom gets here,
you have her honk the old horn.

534
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,900
Monique and I would like
to continue our conversation.

535
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,400
You should not upset Mother...

536
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,900
ever.

537
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,100
I guess people do a lot
of handshaking in France.

538
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,300
I wanted to let you know there's
an opening on the water ballet team.

539
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,600
I can make a call if you want.
Come on.

540
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,600
All right.
Studs and babes with Roy!

541
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,400
Why aren't you with Ricky?

542
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,500
Well, nice meeting you.

543
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,000
Good night.

544
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,000
Why weren't you there
as I told you?

545
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,600
- I told her, Mom.
- I know.

546
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
Don't you understand English?

547
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,000
Bye.

548
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,600
Two dollars.

549
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
Two dollars.

550
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,400
- Two dollars.
- Two dollars.

551
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,600
Keys!

552
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,000
Hi. How was your date?

553
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,100
They're out there.
They're after me.

554
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,900
Happy New Year.

555
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,500
- Honey, where's Lane?
- He just came in.

556
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,100
He went skiing this morning
with Charles De Mar.

557
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,300
I think he's in the shower.

558
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,300
In me, you see

559
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:19,100
A man alone

560
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,900
What's taking him so long?

561
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,900
It's his first day at work.
I don't want him to be late.

562
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,400
A man who listens

563
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,400
To the trembling of the trees

564
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,500
With sentimental ease

565
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,300
In me, you see

566
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:50,000
A man alone

567
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,800
Behind the wall

568
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,600
He's learned to call his own

569
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,100
A man who still goes

570
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,600
Walkin'in the rain

571
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,700
- Expecting love again
- You better...

572
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,700
- So you're Al Myer's kid.
- Yes, I am.

573
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,800
- You look pretty stupid to me.
- Thank you.

574
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,900
Let's see if you have any brains.
First you take the meat.

575
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,500
- You understand?
- Yeah.

576
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,400
Then you pat it
in the pig mold.

577
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,200
- Push it in the pig mold.
- This is a push.

578
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,200
This is a pat.

579
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,900
Then take the pig mold
and put it on the tray.

580
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,500
Now put on this hat.

581
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,500
See that sign up there?

582
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,600
You wear it with pride.
Put it on!

583
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,300
You gotta have pride and class
in this business. Understand?

584
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,800
Now...

585
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,100
What's that?

586
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,300
Those are the keys
to this establishment.

587
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,000
I want you in here at 6:00 a.m.
Saturday morning.

588
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,900
This place has to be mopped up
before the breakfast crew get here.

589
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,100
- Roger.
- All right.

590
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,600
- Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna go wash my hands.

591
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,100
- I gotta mold and pat.
- Wash your hands on your own time.

592
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,100
- Now, get to work.
- Yes, sir.

593
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,700
- Fat pig.
- What?

594
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,500
Pat. Pat pig.

595
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Everybody wants some.

596
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,300
I'll show you
what everybody wants.

597
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,400
They call me mad!
Mad! Mad!

598
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
Me, a fool?

599
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,300
It's alive!

600
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,500
Oh, yeah

601
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,800
Yeah, yeah

602
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,000
You can't get romantic
on a subway line

603
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,100
Conductor don't like it

604
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,700
Says you're wastin'your time

605
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,900
But everybody wants some

606
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,300
I want some too

607
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,200
Everybody wants some

608
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,200
Baby, how 'bout you

609
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah

610
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,700
I seen a lot of people
lookin'for a moonbeam

611
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,100
Yeah, ya spent a lot
Ya got lost in the jet stream

612
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,000
Everybody wants some
I want some too

613
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,400
Oops.

614
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,500
Lookin' really good today, buddy.

615
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Lookin' real good.

616
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Goon.

617
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,700
All right.

618
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,300
This is it.

619
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,900
- Look, Barney, a falling star.
- Yeah.

620
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,800
- Let's make a wish.
-A wish?

621
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,300
If you wish on a falling star,
your wish will come true.

622
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,200
No kiddin'?

623
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,900
- What did you wish for, Betty?
- Can't tell ya.

624
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,900
It would spoil the wish.

625
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,900
- Don't tell me your wish either.
- I won't.

626
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,700
Hey there. I know this is awkward,
me being a cartoon and all.

627
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,700
I was just wondering how you'd feel
if I took out Beth.

628
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,100
Matches.

629
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,300
Where have you been?
We've all been waiting for you.

630
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,300
You come and sit
right down here.

631
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,600
- Have you met Monique?
- Hi.

632
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:46,400
Now, in honor of our special guest,
I've created "Dinner Mon Dieu."

633
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,400
First we have...

634
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,700
"Fraunch" fries.

635
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,900
And...

636
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,900
"Fraunch" dressing.

637
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,500
And "Fraunch" bread.

638
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,000
And to drink... ta-da!

639
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,000
"Peru."

640
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:14,500
You really do go to the outer limits
to make an impression.

641
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,300
Monique, enjoying your stay
in our town?

642
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,200
I say, are enjoying your stay
in our town?

643
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,000
- She doesn't speak English, Dad.
- Of course she does.

644
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,000
- Are you enjoying your stay...
- It's no good, Al.

645
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,200
- She don't speak a word.
- Wait a minute.

646
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,600
I thought foreign exchange students
had to speak some English.

647
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,800
Well, as we're discovering
around our household...

648
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,600
you don't need words
to speak the international language.

649
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,900
Right, Ricky?

650
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,100
The international language.

651
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:02,000
You know... love.

652
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,700
The language of love.

653
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,700
I think Monique and our little Ricky
have a regular...

654
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,500
cross-continental romance
brewing here.

655
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,100
- Him? And her?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

656
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,100
That makes sense.

657
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,600
What does that mean?

658
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,100
I think she wants
to use the bathroom.

659
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:35,400
It's down the hall,
second door on the left.

660
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,500
Jennifer,
this is fabulous liqueur.

661
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:49,100
Reminds me of the moonshine
Ricky's dead pappy used to make.

662
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,700
- God bless him.
- Mrs. Smith! No! Wait!

663
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,400
I'm real sorry your mom blew up,
Ricky. Doctor said she'll be okay.

664
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,100
I guess she just won't be able
to eat any spicy foods for a while.

665
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,000
Not now.

666
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,200
- What do they want?
- They want a race.

667
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:26,700
- Lane Myer, the kid from Greendale.
- Here's a good example.

668
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,400
- I don't know.
- Brothers. One speaks no English.

669
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,900
The other learned English from
watching the Wide World of Sports.

670
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,000
You tell me which is better...
speaking no English at all...

671
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
or speaking Howard Cosell.

672
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,100
The chances seem slim that
this once-great has the nerve...

673
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,400
the desire to win,
that he once had.

674
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,800
You must obey the proper
speed limits. A car is not a toy.

675
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,700
- We'll take these guys!
- It's a close race.

676
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,100
Myer takes the lead.
This could go in Myer's favor.

677
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,900
You're exceeding the speed limit.
Lane Myer, slow down.

678
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,000
Myer takes the lead.
This could go in Myer's favor.

679
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,300
It looks very, very close.

680
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,100
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Ricky's dead.

681
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,700
Ricky, are you dead?
I think he's dead. Monique.

682
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,800
Monique, I'm sorry.

683
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,900
I'm telling my mom.

684
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,000
See you later.

685
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,000
Ever since I got my license, those
kamikaze pilots have been after me.

686
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,200
If I only had my Camaro running.
If I had my Camaro running...

687
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,800
I would blow those boys
off the street... vroom.

688
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,800
That thing goes so fast.
It's got an engine...

689
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,500
Looks good, huh?

690
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,700
I guess after my mom's cooking,
you'll probably tolerate anything.

691
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,500
Have a Ding Dong. They're good.

692
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,600
There they are.

693
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,300
Don't get me wrong.
My mom means well, she really does.

694
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,700
Cooking's her new thing.
She cooks all the time now.

695
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:36,300
- It's better than it used to be.
- Hey! Buenos dias.

696
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,700
I stopped by to tell you I'm gonna
be picking a new captain...

697
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,600
for the ski team on Sunday.

698
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:52,500
All you gotta do to be captain,
Myer, is beat me.

699
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:56,700
The tryouts won't be the same
if you're not there, champ.

700
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,100
So what are you and Myer
talking about?

701
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,100
Is he telling you
what a great lover he is?

702
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,500
She only speaks French, Roy.
She doesn't speak "imbecile."

703
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:16,100
There's one language I speak
that all women understand.

704
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,400
Just ask your last girlfriend.

705
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,100
Would you like
to learn some new words?

706
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,100
Shit! Stupid!

707
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,100
- What's going on here?
- Nothing!

708
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,700
Myer's new frog girlfriend here
is just as much of a clod as he is.

709
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,700
Hold on. You think you're such a big
tough guy because you're captain.

710
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,700
The truth is, I could
out-ski you any day of the week.

711
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,700
- Really?
- You want a race, I'll take you on.

712
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,800
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- From the K-12, champ.

713
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,800
- Chicken?
- What did you say?

714
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,600
- Anytime. You name it.
- You're diggin' your own grave.

715
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,500
No one has to know.
Just me and you.

716
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,100
Sunday. High noon.

717
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,600
You're on.

718
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,900
This just in. Lane Myer
will be racing Roy Stalin...

719
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,200
down K-12 this Sunday at noon.

720
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,200
I must be brain-damaged.
I'm gonna race. I'm gonna lose.

721
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,200
And I'm gonna die.

722
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:32,500
That? Is my car. The Camaro.

723
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,500
Remember? I was telling you
about it before? It doesn't work.

724
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,800
My little brother, he's building
a space shuttle out of appliances.

725
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,100
That thing's going to work. I can't
get that out of the driveway.

726
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,600
I'll talk to you later.
I gotta go.

727
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,500
Smitty? Yo, Smitty!

728
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,300
How's it going?
Here's the ski you called about.

729
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,700
My God. What happened to you?
You're all mangled.

730
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:31,900
- You get hit by a truck?
- I was trying to ski the K-12.

731
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,100
After the Olympics,
everything looked so damned easy.

732
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,900
You gotta be a real moron
to try to ski that run, you know?

733
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,200
Yeah.

734
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,200
- Charge it.
- Have a nice day.

735
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:52,000
This is as bad
as it will ever get.

736
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,600
I want my two dollars!
Two dollars!

737
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,100
I want my two dollars! Two dollars!

738
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,800
I want my two dollars!

739
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,800
No! I can't swim!

740
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,500
Something wrong, Monique?

741
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,700
Nice talking to you.

742
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,400
Hell, yes, something is wrong!

743
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,600
This, how you say, "dorkhead"...

744
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,800
is an unleashed sex fiend.

745
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,400
Look. He will not leave me alone.
He thinks because I stay here...

746
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:28,800
I am his love goddess,
his prostrate.

747
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,800
No. Prostitute.

748
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,900
Holy shit.
You big faker. You speak English.

749
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,800
But of course I speak English.
I speak very good English.

750
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,800
I will not, however,
speak Mrs. Smith's...

751
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,600
international language of love
with this reptilian son.

752
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,800
Well, honk my hooter!

753
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:56,200
I don't believe it. You've
understood everything we've said?

754
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,800
Look, Lane. If you were living
with a family like that...

755
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,300
the less you spoke, the happier
you would be, I promise you.

756
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,500
God, I never thought of that.

757
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,600
I thought if Casanova and I
had nothing to say to each other...

758
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,700
he'd get bored, go away.

759
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:16,000
Instead, he used it as a chance
to put his testicles all over me.

760
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,100
His what?

761
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,000
How you say... octopus, testicles?

762
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,400
Tentacles. "N-t." Tentacles.

763
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,400
- Tentacles.
- There's a big difference.

764
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:33,400
All I want is to come to the States
and see Dodger Stadium.

765
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:40,300
Now all I see is that... that face
in my door every time I move.

766
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Dodgers, huh? I notice
you have a pretty good pitching arm.

767
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,200
What else is there that is
of interest in the States...

768
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,300
but the Brooklyn Dodgers?

769
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,500
I don't know.
You might find a nice friend.

770
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,000
You do have friends in France?

771
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,700
You know... friend.

772
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,200
Friend.

773
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,500
- Then you will not tell?
- That you're a Dodgers fan?

774
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,700
No. That I speak English.

775
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,400
- Cross my heart and hope to die.
- Do you?

776
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,700
Not at the moment.

777
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,400
What are you doin' out here?
Do you know what time it is?

778
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,800
Get in here before
you catch your death.

779
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,800
Jesus.

780
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,400
You are my friend. Good night.

781
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,800
Good luck.

782
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,200
Is that Myer boy bothering you?

783
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,200
Little Ricky's been lookin'
all over for you.

784
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,200
We've been worried sick.

785
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,300
Damn.

786
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,500
Hello? Hello?

787
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,500
No, thanks. I already had breakfast.
What are you doing to my car?

788
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,300
What are you doing to my Camaro?

789
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:54,100
Monique, what are you doing
to my car? It's already screwed up.

790
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,400
- "Screwed up"?
- Yeah. Very.

791
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:07,500
You got my car running! You brought
my car back from the dead.

792
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,300
- From the dead?
- Yeah.

793
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:14,200
- Not entirely.
- Can you put that back in?

794
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,700
Together? Where it goes?

795
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,100
If I cannot,
I am sure you will.

796
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,300
I have a great fear of tools. I once
made a birdhouse in wood shop...

797
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,600
and the Fair Housing Committee
condemned it.

798
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:28,400
"I cannot do it"
is your middle name.

799
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,500
Come. Help me push this
into the garage.

800
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:37,100
I think you're kind of remarkable.
How'd you learn to do all this?

801
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,200
Some things are not that hard
to understand, Lane.

802
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,700
Like you, for instance. You think of
these ways of killing yourself...

803
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,700
yet you never do it.

804
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:51,500
- Why is this?
- Isn't that kind of personal?

805
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:57,300
But I told you the sordid details
of my intimate sex life with Ricky.

806
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:01,000
I just figured you could
explain this dramatic death wish.

807
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,900
I used to go out
with this girl named Beth.

808
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,800
I really thought I loved her,
and she dumped me.

809
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,700
And I guess I thought I couldn't
live without her or something.

810
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:20,100
You would die to get the attention
of this woman?

811
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,200
You know, Lane, there are better
ways of getting attention.

812
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:28,900
Yeah. When she dumped me, she
dumped me for this real slimebag...

813
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,600
a guy named Stalin.

814
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,800
I race Stalin tomorrow. Oh, my God.
I have to get to a cave right now.

815
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,000
No. This is what I speak of.

816
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:45,100
This is good way of getting
this attention, when we beat him.

817
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,600
- Beat him? I can't beat him.
- Yes!

818
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,800
I think all you need
is a small taste of success.

819
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:54,500
You will find it suits you.

820
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,000
Step up.

821
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,100
One minute.

822
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,100
Voila.

823
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,700
Hold that thought.

824
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,200
I got these for Christmas.

825
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,000
Bon appetit.

826
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,100
Monique, I just wanted
to thank you for everything.

827
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,800
Merci buckets.

828
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,700
Wait. I forgot
the most important thing.

829
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,300
Look at this! How am I supposed
to live through this?

830
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,400
All you've got to do
is go that way really fast.

831
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,000
If something gets
in your way, turn.

832
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:24,300
Watch. It's no sweat.

833
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,100
Now you!

834
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,700
Hell, if you can do it...

835
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,200
Lane, are you all right?

836
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,600
You're mad about me, aren't you?

837
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:46,000
I'm okay, really. Nothing's broken.
It's just a little... Thank you.

838
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:56,600
I'm telling you, practically everybody
in the state of Northern California...

839
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:02,100
is around this particular mountain
waiting to see one Lane Myer...

840
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:07,600
tackle this totally
untamed slope, dead or alive.

841
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:11,500
So get the lead out.
That is all.

842
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,400
- Well, I guess this is it.
- Please hurry.

843
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,800
We have unfinished business.
Do not forget.

844
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,700
- Language lessons.
- You gonna teach me French?

845
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,500
The international language.

846
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,400
Kick his ass.

847
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,400
Shit!

848
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,400
I want my two dollars!

849
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,600
Oh, my God.

850
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,900
Two dollars!

851
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,200
- I want my two dollars!
- Of course the guy chickened out.

852
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:35,600
He's just a geek. Listen,
the wet wimp ain't gonna show up.

853
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:38,900
Of course not. So what do you
want us to do? Pack it up?

854
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,200
I tell you what. While I'm up here,
might as well break one more record.

855
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,800
- We'll set the synchros for ya.
- Ten-four.

856
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,100
Spencer, we're gonna
send Roy down alone.

857
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,100
- Looks like Myer is not gonna show.
- Count me down.

858
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:56,400
- Myer, you don't know when to quit.
- Myer's on the hill!

859
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,700
- Two dollars!
- Go!

860
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,200
Go!

861
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,500
- He's skiing on one ski!
- What?

862
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,200
Two dollars! Two dollars!

863
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:34,000
- There's something following them.
- What?

864
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,800
Two dollars!

865
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,200
I want my two dollars!

866
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,000
- I want my two dollars!
- Not now.

867
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,800
Two dollars!

868
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:58,900
Get out of here! Get lost! Get
out of here. Take a hike, brat.

869
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,200
Two dollars.

870
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,900
They're coming
out of the woods!

871
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:09,500
Come on, little buckaroo!
Come on!

872
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:05,600
You fiend! Man, you're
the hottest thing since sunburn!

873
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
- Nice try.
- Get lost.

874
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,800
Lane, you really are the best.

875
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,800
- We've been worried about you.
- What are you doing up here?

876
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:30,300
Do you know how long a drive
it is to get here?

877
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,200
Get her skis.
We're goin' home.

878
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,900
Excuse me.

879
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:41,300
This was a sublime metamorphosis
of the Lane Myer...

880
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,000
I think the crowds
were expecting to see here...

881
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,500
at Brody Mountain today.

882
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,800
Perhaps you can tell us
what brought on...

883
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,300
such an enchanting,
exhilarating fate?

884
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,300
Language lessons.

885
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,800
Language lessons.

886
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,500
Inspired words from a man
who knows how to ski.

887
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,900
You're nothing but a little tramp,
you know.

888
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,800
I don't know what Ricky
even sees in you.

889
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,900
- What are you doing with her?
- She's coming with me.

890
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,900
- She's coming with us.
- Wrong.

891
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,400
You would be wise
to do as Mother says, Myer.

892
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,000
Do something to him.

893
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,500
Son of a bitch!

894
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,800
Come on, honey!
Nail the sucker!

895
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,000
What are you doing to him?

896
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,100
Come on. That's a boy.

897
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,800
Come on.

898
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,000
Ricky, where are you going?

899
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:35,600
