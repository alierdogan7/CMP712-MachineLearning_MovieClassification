<I> MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA
JUNE 18, 1991 </I>

3
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,422
Okay, put everything under the bed.

4
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:56,632
Hurry!

5
00:03:58,687 --> 00:03:59,832
Hurry up!

6
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,107
Hi Nick. Get ready.
Pablo wants to see you.

7
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:17,405
Now what?

8
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:24,167
Tell my brother to stop
tickets one day, right?

9
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,319
OK.

10
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:27,954
Do not worry.

11
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,267
Follow Me.

12
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:27,166
I see you have two sandwiches.

13
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,585
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

14
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:39,262
For Nick ...

15
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,229
I need you to town ...

16
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:44,530
Ituango.

17
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,279
We're right here.

18
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:54,706
Fifteen Tomas, you're on here.

19
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:58,711
And right here is the people. Ituango.

20
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:03,758
When you get to the Main Plaza,
park opposite the church.

21
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,737
A local farmer will go through you.

22
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:09,666
Be your guide.

23
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:12,786
It will ask what is the number?

24
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,929
And you say "seventy-two".

25
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,784
- Seventy-two.
- Yes.

26
00:10:19,808 --> 00:10:21,530
- Do not forget this number.
- Okay.

27
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,711
Then it will take you to the cave ...

28
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:27,588
and you shall put all
inside. In that cave.

29
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:29,733
Once all this insurance.

30
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:32,803
The peasant fly entry.

31
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:34,982
When the sealed cave,

32
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,014
You can return to the mountain.

33
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,338
Now ...

34
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,787
When you see the people of Ituango ...

35
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,130
and you know you can
return by yourself,

36
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:48,294
will stop the car ...

37
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:52,712
And say to the farmer who
Have a problem with a wheel.

38
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:55,179
Ask him to exit the car,

39
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,557
and then you walk up to him ...

40
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,368
and you shoot in
head with this ...

41
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:06,117
Is a 9 mm.

42
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:09,128
It is loaded right?

43
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:13,512
Insurance is placed ...

44
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:19,419
Uninsured ... With insurance ...

45
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,798
Now, let me put this
here right under your thigh.

46
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:28,429
You get to always take it.

47
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:32,437
Then you drive up to the main square.

48
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,141
Opposite the church, there is a restaurant.

49
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,425
Inside the restaurant, there is a phone.

50
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:41,506
I want you to call me ...

51
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,182
this number.

52
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,362
And you confirm that everything went well.

53
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:48,548
Now ...

54
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,836
When you fire the peasant,
be sure to put the ...

55
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:54,383
gun very close to
his head, okay?

56
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:01,165
Now, Nick, listen.

57
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:03,588
It will be easy to kill ...

58
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:05,676
if you know nothing about it.

59
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,360
So do not make conversation.

60
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:19,208
Are you okay?

61
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,442
I never did anything like this before.

62
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,644
We are all making sacrifices Nico,

63
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,069
and I am very proud of you.

64
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:40,275
You're like a son to me.

65
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,197
It will end soon.

66
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:21,282
<I> A FEW YEARS BEFORE ... </ i>

67
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:35,956
I got this.

68
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:17,135
Transport ... We never talk
transport money.

69
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:18,491
What are you talking about?

70
00:14:31,242 --> 00:14:33,383
Nick! Wait.

71
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:35,027
This guy tries to deceive.

72
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:37,105
Wants more money for transportation.

73
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:42,538
Okay, this is everything
we have right? Take it.

74
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,719
Sorry!

75
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,416
- Do you speak English?
- Yes!

76
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,391
Great.

77
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,203
I wonder if we can
renting your truck.

78
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:09,216
¿Rent?

79
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,306
Yes. To help us
our timber transport.

80
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,790
How?

81
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:18,915
Eh, I could ... I could ...
Give you surf lessons in return?

82
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:27,528
Do you plan to import more Yankees here?

83
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,798
¿Yonquis?

84
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,362
Yankees!

85
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:33,019
Yeah, well ... maybe.

86
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:35,967
Seriously. No rento my truck.

87
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,797
You can use it for free.

88
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:41,276
Are you serious?

89
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:44,775
That's incredible. Thank You!
It helps a lot!

90
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:50,226
By the way, we are not
Yankees, we are Canadians.

91
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:52,098
- There is a difference.
- Is there?

92
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:55,335
Thank You.

93
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:32,843
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

94
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:34,742
What are you doing ?! Do not do that.

95
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,138
- Hey, can we talk?
- Are you the boss?

96
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:43,692
Yes! Yes, I'm the boss.

97
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:16,278
Business ...

98
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:18,462
You must pay.

99
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,496
What was that, Dylan?

100
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:01,865
- What did they want?
- What do you think they wanted?

101
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:03,501
They wanted money!

102
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,686
So guys we met
local thugs.

103
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,109
Do not worry bro ...

104
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,218
Forget about us.

105
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:40,928
Looking for someone?

106
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:42,863
Yes.

107
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,626
I seek you.

108
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:49,798
Yes.

109
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:50,931
The truck helped a lot.

110
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,870
- Toma.
- Thank You.

111
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,032
- Because of you.
- Thank You! Flowers! Thank You!

112
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,951
By the way, I'm Nick Brady.

113
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:03,668
It's a beautiful name.

114
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,544
Is this your house?

115
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:10,768
Yes. Well, until
clinical finish.

116
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,052
We charity
poor communities.

117
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:15,292
- It's great.
- Yes.

118
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,603
- You and who else?
- My Uncle.

119
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:19,402
And work for him.

120
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:24,888
- Ah, Uncle Pablo!
- Yes.

121
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:30,219
Can I have a glass of water?

122
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,517
Yes, I am ...

123
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:34,264
I'm very thirsty.

124
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:43,155
<I> So what do you have against the Yankees? </ I>

125
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,736
I don't get it, I don't get it!

126
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:47,820
Sorry ... I was rude!

127
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:50,157
Yes! Very rude! You were like ...

128
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:55,424
Are you going to import more "Yankees" here?

129
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,769
It's just that foreign ...

130
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:03,940
come and think
found paradise.

131
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:07,681
I only see what is wrong here.

132
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:10,265
Malnutrition ...

133
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,491
illiteracy, poverty.

134
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:16,129
Many people need help here.

135
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:24,007
There are more satisfying ways
of living here, if you want.

136
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,354
What do you mean?

137
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:28,836
I do not know ...

138
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:32,208
I say that surfing ...

139
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:34,992
is not the only option.

140
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:37,669
Who said I came to surf?

141
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:47,947
You know, my brother ...

142
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,120
He lost the ability to surf.

143
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:55,549
But I always had this dream.

144
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:58,516
Back and live here.

145
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,441
I just want to see him happy again.

146
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:21,219
Okay ...

147
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:25,582
I get up tomorrow at five.

148
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
It's early.

149
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,140
All right.

150
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,014
Thank You.

151
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:35,717
That was ...

152
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:37,915
an excellent glass of water.

153
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:43,644
- Good night.
- Good night.

154
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:13,599
You know, it's a ...

155
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:16,724
It is a long walk
back to dark.

156
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:21,183
You're a big boy.

157
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:23,473
You can do it.

158
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:53,689
Mary!

159
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:56,285
You almost had! You almost had!

160
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:58,892
No, Nick! I do not want
I do it right?

161
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,659
I hate surfing seriously
and you are very bad teacher!

162
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,647
I'm not bad teacher! Come on!
Almost what you had, if you stop now ...

163
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,882
I have to go, I
I have to go, okay?

164
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,672
You're killing me! You're killing me ...

165
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:09,881
Oh ... you come?

166
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,441
- I do not know.
- Please say yes, yes ...

167
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:13,972
- Maybe.
- Yes!

168
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah, maybe.

169
00:25:15,044 --> 00:25:16,896
- Yes, maybe?
- Yeah, maybe. That.

170
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:17,986
Well, now.

171
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:20,474
Going!

172
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:21,498
I'll kill you!

173
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:22,307
Are you going to kill me?

174
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:24,132
- Yes! You must be there.
- OK! Goodbye.

175
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:25,383
Bye, bye!

176
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,749
Why did not you come?

177
00:27:38,536 --> 00:27:40,539
No bermuda, you know ...

178
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:41,970
All right. You're right.

179
00:27:42,112 --> 00:27:43,502
It is somewhat dated.

180
00:27:44,104 --> 00:27:45,779
You really want to know!

181
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:47,602
That's good ...

182
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:50,607
What is good?

183
00:27:56,494 --> 00:27:57,971
I'm not ready to let ...

184
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,199
Nick ... Everything will be
well for us ...

185
00:28:04,158 --> 00:28:05,188
I know.

186
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,499
Come on man!

187
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:22,276
- It is beautiful right?
- Very beautiful!

188
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:36,208
I really want you to know.

189
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,984
It is my uncle, Dr. Prieto.

190
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:51,505
His wife. And all my cousins.

191
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:21,433
- We will ask Pablo.
- OK.

192
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:22,541
- OK?
- Yes.

193
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:13,255
Well, Mary speaks well of you.

194
00:32:14,096 --> 00:32:15,096
Thank You.

195
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:18,261
- Happy birthday, Mr. Escobar!
- Call me Pablo.

196
00:32:29,195 --> 00:32:30,195
Goodbye.

197
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,143
My uncle is obsessed with gold.

198
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:53,252
An obsession face!

199
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:05,790
How did all your money?

200
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:10,666
Cocaine.

201
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,258
The people here in Colombia ...

202
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,289
has chewed coca leaves from
the beginning of time.

203
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:26,217
Pablo only exports
natural product ...

204
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:29,435
Almost all his money
ago, is for the poor.

205
00:35:31,202 --> 00:35:33,932
Go to the neighborhoods and ask there ...

206
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:37,169
They love it!

207
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:40,638
Come on.

208
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:42,523
Dance with me ...

209
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:05,979
Sorry Nick did I wake you?

210
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:07,258
All right.

211
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:13,941
Is that Mary wants us ...

212
00:36:14,617 --> 00:36:15,820
He has been saying ...

213
00:36:16,028 --> 00:36:22,127
Uncle Pablo, Nick this, Nick
the other, Nick, Nick, Nick ...

214
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:23,462
Nick this, Nick the other.

215
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,707
All is well?
Your room is ok?

216
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,546
Yeah yeah. It's great, thanks.

217
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,941
So what Mary tells me you
brother lives on the beach?

218
00:36:37,782 --> 00:36:39,200
What do there?

219
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,461
Have a small business,

220
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:43,955
selling food and drinks.

221
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:45,901
And I, I surf lessons.

222
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:47,773
A kind of surf camp.

223
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:48,858
Oh, how cute!

224
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:49,909
Yeah yeah!

225
00:36:49,947 --> 00:36:51,832
- Yes.
- That's nice.

226
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,760
It's cute.

227
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:02,901
- Nick do you believe in God?
- Yeah yeah.

228
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:04,612
That's good.

229
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,220
Do you take drugs?

230
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:09,407
Do Not.

231
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:12,152
No. I mean, not
It is really for me.

232
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,292
- That's good.
- Yes.

233
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:19,544
I have seen devouring drugs,
the souls of many great men.

234
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:24,935
Well, listen Nick.

235
00:37:26,063 --> 00:37:30,252
I just wanted to say that Mary
it's like a daughter to me ...

236
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:34,259
and I will be very happy if
find a good partner.

237
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,110
All Right.

238
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:37,721
That's good.

239
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:42,350
Are you serious about what of it?

240
00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:44,095
Yes, absolutely.

241
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:46,965
Do you love her?

242
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,145
- Yes, more than anything.
- All Right.

243
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,647
- That's the best!
- Yes!

244
00:38:03,896 --> 00:38:04,896
All Right.

245
00:38:05,977 --> 00:38:07,172
What happened to your arm?

246
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,358
Eh ... I attacked a dog.

247
00:38:14,482 --> 00:38:15,923
That was a big dog ...

248
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:17,356
What happened?

249
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,627
Some local ... wanted
to pay on the beach and ...

250
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:22,889
And we did not gave in.

251
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:27,111
- And that was your dog?
- Yes.

252
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:34,401
Nick do you like the song
I sang my wife tonight?

253
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,381
Yes! It was great!

254
00:38:38,022 --> 00:38:40,304
I did not understand it all. But it was beautiful.

255
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,581
I'll get a translation!

256
00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:44,669
Perfect!

257
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:48,646
Maybe one day sing to Mary?

258
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:51,557
In front of all your friends ...

259
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:53,328
Maybe!

260
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,851
- It was a good talk.
- Yes.

261
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,249
Get some rest.

262
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,114
See you in the morning.

263
00:39:42,723 --> 00:39:43,795
Bésense again!

264
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:58,198
Nick and Mary were married soon.

265
00:39:58,468 --> 00:40:02,187
They give many babies his family.

266
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:04,181
Is not Nick?

267
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:06,718
Yeah yeah! Hopefully!

268
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:12,335
You better hurry or you
extradite to Canada!

269
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:46,689
<I> You told Escobar ... </ i>

270
00:40:46,842 --> 00:40:49,272
<I> whatever, on
the Roldano? </ i> Brothers

271
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:53,268
They killed! Two days ago!

272
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,059
The hung upside
down and burned alive!

273
00:40:56,959 --> 00:41:00,214
Everyone in the city say
Escobar and his men did!

274
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:09,936
Not true brother.

275
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:13,938
I would never do something like that.

276
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,448
He offered me a job at the ranch ...

277
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,003
Wait ... what did?

278
00:41:19,882 --> 00:41:21,948
I want you to wear
happy for me okay?

279
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:27,079
Nick, Nick must listen to this!

280
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,528
Nick!

281
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:03,726
Good Morning!

282
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,286
Follow! Follow! Follow!

283
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:21,913
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

284
00:42:21,937 --> 00:42:22,937
Yes?

285
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:23,961
Yes.

286
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,737
No, friend! I can not.

287
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,333
Look at his face!

288
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,282
- Your turn.
- Me?

289
00:42:31,306 --> 00:42:32,249
I do not want.

290
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:33,284
Yes, it's your turn.

291
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:35,542
- OK.
- OK.

292
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:47,836
- Hey Nick?
- Yes.

293
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:51,498
If well. I'm just going
by Luis pony.

294
00:42:53,585 --> 00:42:54,747
All right. I can do it.

295
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,559
Come here, come here.

296
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:07,636
My name is Drago Gutierrez
work for the employer as well.

297
00:44:09,117 --> 00:44:10,949
I know Mary from
I was a little girl.

298
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:16,156
All is well?

299
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:17,923
Yes.

300
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:19,170
Yes, I'm fine.

301
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:20,768
Look At Me.

302
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,083
You know who died in this car?

303
00:44:51,142 --> 00:44:52,185
Clyde Barrow.

304
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:54,160
Who?

305
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:56,180
Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker.

306
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,639
Yeah yeah.

307
00:44:57,674 --> 00:44:58,674
Bonnie and Clyde.

308
00:44:59,894 --> 00:45:00,894
Get In.

309
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:19,386
Bonnie Parker died
right where you're sitting.

310
00:45:20,908 --> 00:45:23,397
He was fifty holes
bullet in your body.

311
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,940
Someone close betrayed,
and they fell into the trap.

312
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,836
If I fall into a trap
Bonnie and Clyde ...

313
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:40,988
That's not good ...

314
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,434
So I trust
everyone around me.

315
00:45:49,821 --> 00:45:52,180
So if you see something strange around here...

316
00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:54,459
You come and tell me, okay?

317
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,378
Not a word to anyone.

318
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,421
Neither Mary.

319
00:46:03,855 --> 00:46:05,119
Do you understand?

320
00:46:10,249 --> 00:46:11,325
I Understand.

321
00:46:14,114 --> 00:46:16,523
Meet with her.

322
00:46:16,847 --> 00:46:18,867
The enemy is listening.

323
00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:21,169
Hello.

324
00:47:29,552 --> 00:47:31,269
You did not sleep all night.

325
00:47:32,178 --> 00:47:33,528
Is everything okay?

326
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,207
Back to the beach.

327
00:47:42,216 --> 00:47:43,592
Please.

328
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:46,254
Strange that life Mary.

329
00:47:47,627 --> 00:47:49,289
Trust me, we must return there.

330
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:51,942
I thought you liked being here.

331
00:47:52,196 --> 00:47:53,611
It is very different.

332
00:47:54,065 --> 00:47:55,750
Come with me, please.

333
00:48:00,532 --> 00:48:02,090
This is my family, Nick.

334
00:48:10,172 --> 00:48:11,599
What is it, Nick?

335
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:15,982
Are not you happy with me?

336
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,233
Would I want to leave?

337
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,216
No, Mary ...

338
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:23,919
I can not imagine a life without you.

339
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,038
So what happens?

340
00:48:27,057 --> 00:48:28,766
Everyone here loves you.

341
00:48:34,054 --> 00:48:35,600
You're part of my family.

342
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:56,816
Nico, come and stand next to your fiancee.

343
00:49:52,045 --> 00:49:54,401
The Minister of Justice
wants to take the pattern ...

344
00:49:54,484 --> 00:49:56,091
to a prison in the United States.

345
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:21,866
As you can see, move to
all outside the hacienda.

346
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:22,901
Yes.

347
00:50:22,941 --> 00:50:23,941
For long.

348
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:26,197
You and Mary can
stay with your brother.

349
00:50:26,465 --> 00:50:28,145
Until we find
place in Medellin.

350
00:50:31,964 --> 00:50:34,739
Drago will show you how to use all
what's inside this bag.

351
00:50:34,774 --> 00:50:35,774
OK.

352
00:50:40,197 --> 00:50:41,197
Nick ...

353
00:50:57,632 --> 00:50:58,988
What's this?

354
00:51:02,717 --> 00:51:04,415
It is for self-defense, Dylan.

355
00:51:04,537 --> 00:51:05,862
Are you kidding?

356
00:51:06,685 --> 00:51:08,498
I do not want a gun in my house.

357
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:12,191
What's up?

358
00:51:13,311 --> 00:51:15,723
Is it money? Is that it?

359
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:19,654
Is it worth it to be like them?

360
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:22,083
I'm not like them.

361
00:51:24,132 --> 00:51:25,515
I break my heart man.

362
00:51:28,457 --> 00:51:31,198
Anne knows I do not want any of this.

363
00:51:31,785 --> 00:51:34,541
Then you invent something,
pack your bags.

364
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:35,641
And you go.

365
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:37,773
Do not make a scene.

366
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:39,200
Guys?

367
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:42,835
Guys, come to the radio.
They killed the Minister of Justice.

368
00:51:53,621 --> 00:51:55,309
They say it was Pablo.

369
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:01,191
They say he stated
war on the government.

370
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:41,824
This is your room.

371
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:43,662
Linda.

372
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:46,432
This is the kitchen.

373
00:52:48,068 --> 00:52:50,545
And this is the room
Pablo and Pablo bath.

374
00:52:51,275 --> 00:52:52,455
And this is the money of Pablo.

375
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,551
Do not touch it.

376
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:55,925
Needs to move these days.

377
00:52:56,068 --> 00:52:58,068
But do not worry, this
war will end soon.

378
00:53:06,555 --> 00:53:07,555
Keys.

379
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,080
Have fun!

380
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:07,622
<I> 31 March 1991 </ i>

381
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:43,044
Hi Nico, I only see the
game and then I'll go.

382
00:56:44,852 --> 00:56:46,612
Drink a beer.
Drink a beer. Here.

383
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:50,904
How does it feel Mary?

384
00:56:53,424 --> 00:56:54,424
She is fine.

385
00:56:56,888 --> 00:56:57,958
Is it only right?

386
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,724
Yes. All right.

387
00:57:02,403 --> 00:57:03,842
Maybe pregnant.

388
00:57:05,392 --> 00:57:07,035
No, definitely not.

389
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,784
What do you expect, Nico?

390
00:57:09,178 --> 00:57:11,928
Attacks, attacks Nico, attacks ...

391
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:13,223
I'm working on it.

392
00:57:14,716 --> 00:57:16,294
He's working on it.

393
00:57:17,454 --> 00:57:18,987
It should not be working, Nick ...

394
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,644
It should not be working.

395
00:57:24,857 --> 00:57:27,348
Your brother has a son, okay?

396
00:57:27,474 --> 00:57:30,054
If, and are expecting another.

397
00:57:30,423 --> 00:57:31,609
You can do it.

398
00:57:34,507 --> 00:57:38,165
In fact think of returning to Canada.

399
00:57:39,843 --> 00:57:43,140
She misses her home
and want to return there.

400
00:57:46,608 --> 00:57:47,608
I wanted to ask ...

401
00:57:47,623 --> 00:57:51,297
but I think it would be good for
Maria and my back also ...

402
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,721
at least for a while until
everything gets cold around here.

403
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,560
That's not a good idea Nico, not now.

404
00:58:03,144 --> 00:58:04,408
Did Mary know that?

405
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:08,357
Yes, we talked about it.

406
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:24,781
Why do you want to return your brother?

407
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,913
Have you had problems at the beach?

408
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:30,741
No, that was over, thank God.

409
00:58:32,082 --> 00:58:33,314
Thank God?

410
00:58:35,994 --> 00:58:37,670
How to "thank God"?

411
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:42,281
It's nothing, it's figuratively.

412
00:58:44,015 --> 00:58:45,287
OK ...

413
00:58:49,483 --> 00:58:51,617
Because God had nothing to do,

414
00:58:53,720 --> 00:59:01,720
Nick was you, was your
intervention that killed those people.

415
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,675
You're as guilty as I am.

416
00:59:14,716 --> 00:59:15,848
Ve ...

417
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:26,419
Sorry.

418
00:59:33,228 --> 00:59:34,228
¿Dylan?

419
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:36,339
Hello.

420
00:59:37,018 --> 00:59:38,867
It's what I could, it is
almost impossible to escape.

421
00:59:38,935 --> 00:59:40,175
How do we get to the airport?

422
00:59:40,207 --> 00:59:42,131
Do not worry, purchase the tickets
for Friday, right?

423
00:59:42,516 --> 00:59:43,756
- See you there.
- OK.

424
00:59:45,018 --> 00:59:46,498
Glad to have you back, brother.

425
00:59:46,522 --> 00:59:48,123
Dylan I love you ... I love you.

426
00:59:48,138 --> 00:59:49,538
I love you too. Get out of here.

427
00:59:49,554 --> 00:59:50,672
Goodbye.

428
00:59:50,707 --> 00:59:51,707
OK.

429
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,960
Hi Nick ...

430
01:00:24,216 --> 01:00:28,331
It will be easy to kill,
if you know nothing about him.

431
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:36,615
We all make sacrifices Nico,
and I am very proud of you.

432
01:00:40,647 --> 01:00:42,057
You're like a son to me.

433
01:00:52,661 --> 01:00:56,553
<I> ITUANGO </ i>

434
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:48,812
Who are you?

435
01:02:54,076 --> 01:02:57,236
My Father ... Broke
leg ... not coming.

436
01:02:58,209 --> 01:03:00,162
I Martín, I carry.

437
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:08,310
I've ...

438
01:03:08,645 --> 01:03:09,666
I'm taking.

439
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:12,883
What is the number?

440
01:04:48,698 --> 01:04:49,698
<I> Hello? </ I>

441
01:04:49,722 --> 01:04:51,802
I need to talk to the
man who gave me this number.

442
01:04:53,825 --> 01:04:55,662
<I> Nico, tell me ... </ i>

443
01:04:56,678 --> 01:05:00,209
I'm in church, the peasant
did not come because he has a broken leg,

444
01:05:00,289 --> 01:05:03,683
so sent his
son, seems to know everything,

445
01:05:05,454 --> 01:05:06,528
but it's just a kid.

446
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:10,510
Should I do the same?

447
01:05:12,254 --> 01:05:14,302
Until the end?

448
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,520
<I> Call me when you're done. </ I>

449
01:08:15,115 --> 01:08:16,303
It already makes hungry.

450
01:08:17,587 --> 01:08:20,501
My wife prepares good food ...

451
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:24,460
You have a wife?

452
01:08:30,578 --> 01:08:32,666
This is ... my wife.

453
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,271
That's my son.

454
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:42,239
How old are u?

455
01:08:42,991 --> 01:08:43,991
15,

456
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:49,911
We have to work, eat later.

457
01:09:35,978 --> 01:09:37,366
What's inside?

458
01:09:39,691 --> 01:09:40,943
Wait for me outside.

459
01:09:42,491 --> 01:09:43,491
Ve ...

460
01:10:56,321 --> 01:10:57,321
Yes.

461
01:11:25,984 --> 01:11:27,090
Good job.

462
01:11:30,572 --> 01:11:31,780
Would you like to drive?

463
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:32,932
No, I drive.

464
01:11:56,584 --> 01:11:57,825
Are you okay, Nick?

465
01:11:58,717 --> 01:11:59,717
I'm fine.

466
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:49,291
Back in the car.

467
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,785
Come over.

468
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:09,041
You have to listen, is
very important, right?

469
01:13:09,732 --> 01:13:14,347
Your life is in danger, right?

470
01:13:15,693 --> 01:13:16,693
OK?

471
01:13:19,246 --> 01:13:23,364
I'll take you home,
have five minutes ...

472
01:13:23,619 --> 01:13:27,018
to take your
Family and leave Ituango.

473
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,063
Leave Ituango.

474
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:36,694
Mira.

475
01:13:39,802 --> 01:13:41,456
Take, take.

476
01:13:48,285 --> 01:13:51,713
But you have to leave Martin,
you have to go now.

477
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:58,344
Those boxes.
Those boxes ...

478
01:13:59,863 --> 01:14:01,525
No, no, no, you have to forget ...

479
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:07,098
Listen Martin!

480
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,353
You have to leave Ituango now!

481
01:14:11,974 --> 01:14:16,835
Please Understand Me
Martin, listen please.

482
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,214
I have family.

483
01:14:39,432 --> 01:14:41,209
I have friends.

484
01:14:41,632 --> 01:14:42,770
I work.

485
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:54,927
I keep it.

486
01:15:22,698 --> 01:15:23,730
Would you like to drive?

487
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:31,939
If, flip the car.

488
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,995
Now if I drive!

489
01:16:17,596 --> 01:16:18,596
Stop!

490
01:16:18,597 --> 01:16:20,096
Stop, I want to help ...

491
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,009
I want to help, no ...

492
01:16:28,356 --> 01:16:31,619
You have to go, take
your family and go.

493
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:32,786
Do you understand me?

494
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:34,839
Do you understand me?

495
01:16:34,874 --> 01:16:37,046
I'll kill you, I swear to God I'll kill you.

496
01:16:37,522 --> 01:16:38,990
Do you understand?

497
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,645
Where do you ... Where?

498
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:48,410
I need another way.

499
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,830
You have 5 minutes to pull
your family and go, okay?

500
01:17:56,278 --> 01:17:57,278
Do you understand?

501
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:15,276
Well, go and see you in
5 minutes okay?

502
01:18:15,845 --> 01:18:17,788
Go and be stupid
I'm watching.

503
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:20,028
Go, go.

504
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:58,910
Nick?

505
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,038
Mary, I think I'm in trouble,
I could not do what Pablo I ...

506
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:06,401
My God, I'm so happy,
so happy to hear your voice.

507
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,516
Calm down, what happens?

508
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:12,542
All were killed today.

509
01:19:13,995 --> 01:19:16,941
Juanita's father
called me and told me ...

510
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:20,300
<I> that you were with him, Felipe and Juan. </ I>

511
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:25,249
And now they are all dead
Nick, I thought you were dead.

512
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:28,036
<I> I thought you were dead Nick. </ I>

513
01:19:58,506 --> 01:19:59,894
<I> Nick? </ I>

514
01:20:01,391 --> 01:20:05,292
Mary, I need you to hear me
and you do not believe me crazy right?

515
01:20:07,142 --> 01:20:09,146
I think Pablo tries to kill me.

516
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,772
What are you talking about?

517
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,394
<I> I do not have time to
explain okay? </ i>

518
01:20:12,495 --> 01:20:13,616
<I> have to leave the house. </ I>

519
01:20:13,746 --> 01:20:15,987
You have to leave the
home right now, not sure.

520
01:21:01,799 --> 01:21:03,773
See you in Bogota, tomorrow ...

521
01:21:03,836 --> 01:21:05,637
at 9 a. m. front
the Canadian Embassy.

522
01:21:05,647 --> 01:21:07,369
<I> No, no, there is a
church in front of ... </ i>

523
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:09,150
<I> the Embassy, ​​we
See you there at 9 a. m. </ i>

524
01:21:09,736 --> 01:21:11,266
I'll be there, I promise.

525
01:21:13,195 --> 01:21:16,598
- I'm afraid, Nick.
- Me too.

526
01:21:17,694 --> 01:21:18,893
I love you so much.

527
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:22,174
I love you too.

528
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:50,614
I want to talk to him ...

529
01:21:51,533 --> 01:21:52,992
<I> Talk to me, where are you? </ I>

530
01:21:53,722 --> 01:21:55,027
I want to talk to him now!

531
01:21:55,379 --> 01:21:57,270
<I> I want to know why all
they left me dead. </ i>

532
01:21:57,867 --> 01:21:59,598
Why do not you call the restaurant?

533
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,881
How do you know that no
I call the restaurant?

534
01:22:09,155 --> 01:22:11,515
Because no one has called
confirm that killed me, right?

535
01:22:12,044 --> 01:22:16,583
<I> Is that not? Are you still there? </ I>

536
01:22:17,176 --> 01:22:18,992
- I thought you said.
- I did not say shit.

537
01:22:19,346 --> 01:22:21,091
Put Pablo Escobar in
the phone right now.

538
01:22:21,126 --> 01:22:22,759
Tell your treasure is in danger.

539
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:28,822
I know. Do Not ...
I know, I know.

540
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:33,960
I need to talk to your daddy now.

541
01:23:41,797 --> 01:23:43,065
Do you love me dead?

542
01:23:47,709 --> 01:23:48,732
Where are you man?

543
01:23:48,961 --> 01:23:51,122
Pablo, the man who answered
the phone was wrong.

544
01:23:52,556 --> 01:23:54,345
How did not
restaurant called?

545
01:23:55,442 --> 01:23:58,244
Who awaits me there? Answer Me.

546
01:23:59,222 --> 01:24:03,442
Nick, child, read
The Jungle Book?

547
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:04,546
Leave the nonsense and answer me.

548
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:07,257
I am responding
Nick, just listen.

549
01:24:08,534 --> 01:24:12,953
Remember the end, when leaves
his friends in the jungle ...

550
01:24:13,505 --> 01:24:15,977
and goes to the village
where humans are.

551
01:24:16,868 --> 01:24:19,327
Well today, I Mowgli.

552
01:24:20,292 --> 01:24:25,004
Unfortunately, you are one of
those friends that I have to leave behind.

553
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:30,259
You said it was like
a son to you.

554
01:24:30,874 --> 01:24:33,687
Nick, there are laws of nature ...

555
01:24:33,706 --> 01:24:37,522
and when they take control,
you have to accept them.

556
01:25:16,662 --> 01:25:18,591
- I see Drago
- Just say hello.

557
01:25:18,626 --> 01:25:20,520
I just greet him and go to him.

558
01:25:21,519 --> 01:25:23,449
<i> Nick, Mary will be fine. </ i>

559
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:31,190
Can you open this?

560
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:33,133
I know ... Please ...

561
01:25:34,315 --> 01:25:35,828
Please open ...

562
01:25:36,616 --> 01:25:37,827
I know, I know, not going to work.

563
01:25:37,901 --> 01:25:40,157
Please, please ...

564
01:25:40,192 --> 01:25:41,192
Come on.

565
01:25:42,092 --> 01:25:43,582
Come on, come on.

566
01:27:52,387 --> 01:27:53,428
Such is near.

567
01:35:23,111 --> 01:35:24,534
Do not move or I'll kill you.

568
01:35:31,115 --> 01:35:32,159
Here ...

569
01:35:32,194 --> 01:35:33,317
Espósate yourself.

570
01:35:37,575 --> 01:35:38,575
Hide behind.

571
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:39,926
Hide behind ...

572
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:24,951
Do not kill anyone, do not kill anyone.

573
01:38:04,015 --> 01:38:05,886
Outside, put forward.

574
01:38:11,087 --> 01:38:12,087
Here ...

575
01:38:12,111 --> 01:38:16,882
Espósate the wheel,
We're fast, fast.

576
01:38:21,523 --> 01:38:23,243
If I do not return by yourself,
someone will find you.

577
01:38:53,275 --> 01:38:55,182
- Hi ...

It is not certain, their lives
you are in danger you know?

586
01:39:17,087 --> 01:39:18,328

Where do you think you're going, Nico?

609
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:08,803
Nobody escapes from Pablo Escobar.

610
01:45:15,047 --> 01:45:16,560
We will kill you.

611
01:45:18,496 --> 01:45:20,264

I'm still alive.

613
01:51:40,819 --> 01:51:43,590
