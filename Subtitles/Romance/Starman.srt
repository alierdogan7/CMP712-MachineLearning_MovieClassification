00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:05,362
<i>Come on, honey. Good girl.</i>

2
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:07,807
<i>Take that stand.</i>

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,198
<i>Count!</i>

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:13,248
<i>- 10, 9, 8, 7...</i>
<i>- Ignition.</i>

5
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:14,887
<i>...6...</i>
<i>- Prepare for lift-off.</i>

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,278
<i>- Main-stage.</i>
<i>...5, 4, 3...</i>

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,088
<i>... 2, 1, 0.</i>

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,202
And so Voyager II <i>is no</i>w <i>a part of history.</i>

9
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,566
<i>Rocketing into space from its launchpad</i>
<i>here at Cape Kennedy...</i>

10
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,005
<i>... on this historic date: August 20, 1977.</i>

11
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,686
<i>Onboard the space probe</i>
<i>are photographic images of Earth...</i>

12
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:41,522
<i>... verbal greetings</i>
<i>and a medley of musical compositions.</i>

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,802
Voyager II <i>is our invitation</i>
<i>to other intelligent species in the universe:</i>

14
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:49,528
<i>Please come and visit our planet Earth.</i>

15
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:57,079
<i>As the Secretary General</i>
<i>of the United Nations...</i>

16
00:00:57,169 --> 00:01:00,525

17
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,080
...w<i>ho represent almost all</i>
<i>of the human inhabitants of planet Earth...</i>

18
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:09,681
<i>... I send greetings on behalf of the people</i>
<i>of our planet.</i>

19
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:10,282
<i>Hello from the children of planet Earth.</i>

20
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,287
<i>I love you.</i>

21
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:51,487
Don<i>'</i>t do this to yourself, Jenny.
Go to sleep.

22
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:38,878
That<i>'</i>s very good.

23
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,880
- Mr. Director.
- Yes.

24
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:44,199
Would you excuse me, please?

25
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,047
- Sounds like Soviet space garbage.
- The MOLINK people say no.

26
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:01,439
- What does the Kremlin say?
- <i>Na zdorovije.</i> They don<i>'</i>t know nothing.

27
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,605
<i>This is Delta Yankee,</i>
<i>two miles and closing, locked on target.</i>

28
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:20,203
<i>- Permission to launch.</i>
<i>- Permission granted.</i>

29
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:22,678
<i>Delta Yankee executing launch.</i>
<i>Missiles a</i>w<i>ay.</i>

30
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:30,080
Interceptor Delta Yankee reports a hit, sir.

31
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,757
No change in speed,
but another alteration of course.

32
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:36,444
New estimated point of impact:
North Wisconsin by Chequamegon Bay.

33
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,407
Get Mark Shermin.

34
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,842
<i>Tony takes a pass,</i>
<i>Murray drives to the left, he blo</i>w<i>s it.</i>

35

<i>He's do</i>w<i>n. No harm, no foul.</i>

36
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:56,846
<i>Just under three minutes left to play.</i>

37
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:00,884
<i>Cheeks picks up Johnson at mid-court.</i>
<i>Frank is looking for Greeney.</i>

38
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:03,847
<i>No</i>w <i>he's into the top of the key</i>
<i>and finds Johnson all alone.</i>

39
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,807
<i>He's up and in for a deuce.</i>
<i>And he</i> w<i>as fouled on the play.</i>

40
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,642
Call me back in 20 minutes, will you?

41
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:11,483
Yes, sir.

42
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,287
Sorry about that.

43
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:18,598
What?

44
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,719
Chequamegon Bay? Yes, sir.

45
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:29,567
No problem.

46
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,398
Scott?

47
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,247
You<i>'</i>re not Scott.

48
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:22,078

Boy, what a weird dream.

73
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,848
Who are you? What do you want?

74
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:58,558
We go.

75
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:10,444
I can<i>'</i>t get the engine started.

76
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:41,723
Where?

77
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:44,447
Which way? Left, right?

78
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:05,644
Here.

79
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:09,884
You know where that place is?

80
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:18,523
If this is California and down here is...

81
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:22,558
...Texas, that must be, like...

82
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:26,201
...Arizona, maybe.
- Want to be driven.

83
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:28,518
Arizona maybe.

84
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,721
Ten minutes.

85
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,087
About that time, Mr. Shermin.

86
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:08,887
- Okay.
- Coffee?

87
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,044
Yeah.

88
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:17,999
Sergeant, can you get police bands
on that thing?

89
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:19,727
No problem. Why?

90
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,759
I<i>'</i>m interested in anything that<i>'</i>s weird.

91
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,198
You know, freaky, bizarre.

92
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:14,643
- Hi there.
- Hi.

93
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:18,563
- I<i>'</i>m Major Bell.
- Mark Shermin. Is it clean?

94
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:21,841
Well, no radioactivity.
No readings on bacteria.

95
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:24,365
You attached to National Security?

96
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:27,088
Not very. I just work for them.

97
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:31,447
On loan. Sort of like a library book.
No, actually I<i>'</i>m with SETI.

98
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:33,406
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

99
00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:35,844
So they<i>'</i>re sending you guys out
on meteorites now?

100
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,284
- Only when they change course.
- Change course?

101
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:40,678
- Can they do that?
- This one did.

102
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:42,327
So they tell me. Twice.

103
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:47,279
Either that or some airhead over at NORAD
misread a glitch on his monitor.

104
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:50,089
It also came down slower
than suborbital speed.

105
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,603
Naturally, they decided to fire
some missiles at it.

106
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:58,442
- What the hell are they doing?
- Taking a core sample.

107
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:01,282
- Nobody authorised that.
- Damn thing sounded hollow to me.

108
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:03,280
There<i>'</i>s no such thing as a hollow...

109
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:09,521
Jesus Christ!

110
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:11,882
You were about to say?

111
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:15,839
<i>Up and at 'em, folks, this is station WDLU,</i>
<i>in Madison, Wisconsin...</i>

<i>According to the A.P.</i> w<i>ire,</i>
<i>one of the biggest meteorites...</i>

00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,482
<i>... to strike the planet Earth</i>
<i>in the past 80 years...</i>

117
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:33,198
<i>... hit last night near Ashland,</i>
<i>not far from Chequamegon Bay.</i>

118
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,765
<i>So you folks</i> w<i>ho called in</i>
<i>to say you sa</i>w <i>a flying saucer...</i>

119
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:43,325
That<i>'</i>s about you, isn<i>'</i>t it?

120
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:48,283
You really are some kind of Martian
or something, aren<i>'</i>t you?

121
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,647
What do you want here?

122
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:54,560
What are you doing?

123
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:58,682
What do you want with me?
Where are you taking me?

124
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,280
Why do you look so much like Scott?

125
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:04,607

127
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,358
That does it.

128
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:22,244
Help!

129
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:25,281
You crazy sons of bitches.

130
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,922
What<i>'</i>s the matter with you?

131
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:28,358
Help!

132
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:29,598
Help me!

133
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:31,641
Help me, please.

134
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:33,521
I<i>'</i>m being kidnapped.

135
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:35,048
I send greetings.

136
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:36,882
What<i>'</i>s going on here?

137
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,687
I<i>'</i>m being kidnapped.

138
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:40,638
Greetings.

139
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:44,404
You<i>'</i>d better let her go.
I<i>'</i>ll give you greetings.

140
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,328
How<i>'</i>d you do that?

141
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,520
Those little grey jobs?

142
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,803
Communications Central,
this is Project Visitor...

143
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:12,325
...at the Chequamegon sighting.
I have Mr. Shermin for you.

144
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,519
The director<i>'</i>s on the line.

145
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:17,597
All right, what is it?

146
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,003
I<i>'</i>ll know more in two hours.

147
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:21,808
We<i>'</i>re taking it out now
and setting up a lab in Madison.

148
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:25,479
This meteor, the Chequamegon sighting,
appears to be hollow?

149
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:29,080
No, not <i>"</i>appears to be<i>."</i> It is hollow.

150
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,648
I think the balloon has just gone up, sir.

151
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:49,645
Do you have to keep that thing
on your lap like that?

152
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:53,046
Those things<i>...</i>
Guns make me a little bit jumpy.

153
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,924
Define <i>"</i>little bit jumpy<i>."</i>

154
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,127
That<i>'</i>s a little bit.

155
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:03,959
Jumpy<i>'</i>s like nervous, afraid.

156
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:06,407
You know that word <i>"</i>afraid<i>"</i>?

157
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:08,161
<i>"</i>Afraid<i>."</i> Yes.

158
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,805
How much English do you understand?

159
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:15,479
I understand greetings
in 54 planet Earth languages.

160
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:21,239
I understand English language little bit.

161
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:29,448
Nothing much in there.
It<i>'</i>s just a lot of junk.

162
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:32,166
That<i>'</i>s my wallet.

163
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,479
That<i>'</i>s my driver<i>'</i>s license.

164
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:49,800
That<i>'</i>s me. My name, Jenny Hayden.

165
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,568
<i>"</i>Jenny Hayden<i>."</i>

166
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,281
What do you want, anyway?

167
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:57,480
Why did you come here?

168
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,123
Oh, my God.

169
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:05,047
I look like Scott.

170
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:11,437
Yeah, you do.

171
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:17,081
I look like Scott...

172
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,680
...so you do not be little bit jumpy.

173
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,919
Listen, about those police calls,
you did say anything weird, right?

174
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:16,523
- You got something?
- Just picked up one from Ashland.

175
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:18,088
Happened sometime this morning.

176
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:22,162
A guy name Heinmuller had a collision
with an orange and black <i>'</i>77 Mustang.

177
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:24,524
The gal driving claimed
she was being kidnapped.

178
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:28,278
But when Heinmuller went to help her,
the kidnapper...

179
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:30,958
...yelled, <i>"</i>Greetings<i>"</i>
and melted his lug wrench.

180
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,845
Yelled, <i>"</i>Greetings<i>"</i>
and melted his lug wrench?

181
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:35,521
Weird you want, weird you get.

182
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:37,287
How do you melt a lug wrench?

183
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:39,724
I just copy them down,
I don<i>'</i>t explain them.

184
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:45,240
- Did anybody get a license number?
- Wisconsin plates, Papa X-ray Victor 2-3-7.

185
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:47,684
We<i>'</i>re checking the owner
through DMV now.

186
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:14,726
What the hell is that thing?

187
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:17,963
Well, it<i>'</i>s sort of an invitation, Major.

188
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:20,882
Remember that package
we sent up with the <i>Voyager</i> probe?

189
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,564
There was a gold anodised disk...

190
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,726
...with greetings from Earth
in 54 different languages.

191
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:29,801
Complete with a nice little speech
from Kurt Waldheim:

192
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:34,326
<i>"</i>To whom it may concern.
Come and see us sometime<i>."</i>

193
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:39,967
We<i>'</i>re coming to a gas station.

194
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:43,405
- We<i>'</i>re gonna need some gas. Okay?
- <i>"</i>Gas<i>"</i>?

195
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:44,998
Gas.

196
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:48,245
For the car. Fuel.

197
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:50,162
Energy.

198
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:55,367
I step on the gas, the car goes,
I take my foot off, it stops. Understand?

199
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:58,443
No. I do not understand.

200
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:02,883
How can car need energy so soon?

201
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:06,966
I don<i>'</i>t know.
I<i>'</i>m just telling you, this is the gas gauge.

202
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:11,361
When the needle gets to E, that<i>'</i>s <i>"</i>Empty<i>."</i>
No gas. The car stops. Period.

203
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:12,998
Okay.

204
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:14,797
Get gas.

205
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:34,445
- Here you go.
- Take it easy.

206
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:36,679
Yeah. Take it easy.

207
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:42,244
Hi.

208
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:44,763
- Fill her up, unleaded.
- Gas.

209
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:47,163
Gotcha.

210
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:01,162
Yeah, I know.

211
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:03,959
I have to go to the bathroom.

212
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,364
The ladies<i>'</i> room. The restroom.

213
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:11,761
It<i>'</i>s when a person has to<i>...</i>

214
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,606
The hell with it,
you figure it out for yourself, I<i>'</i>m going.

215
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:56,120
<i>"</i>Women<i>."</i> Me.

216
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:01,560
<i>"</i>Men<i>."</i> You.

217
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:04,122
Understand?

218
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:18,402
Can<i>'</i>t get her out?

219
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:20,604
Gas.

220
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:23,683
Yeah, well, I know just how she feels.

221
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:47,367
Every goddamn place you go.

222
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,162
Take it easy.

223
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:55,683
Up yours.

224
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,688
Take it easy.

225
00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:08,808
Up yours.

226
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,848
Hi, let<i>'</i>s go.

227
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:29,719
Nothing of interest in here.

228
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:00,961
You wanna sign that for me, Ms. Hayden?

229
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:30,041
Kidnapped.

230
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:33,524
What?

231
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,321
What is...

232
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,603
<i>..."</i>kidnapped<i>"</i>?

233
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:56,244
You want to know what kidnapped is?

234
00:35:57,169 --> 00:36:00,479
It<i>'</i>s being dragged out of your house
in the middle of the night...

235
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:02,924
...by some whatever you are.

236
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:07,646
Being forced to drive all night at gunpoint
and not knowing where you<i>'</i>re going...

237
00:36:07,729 --> 00:36:10,607
...or what<i>'</i>s going to happen to you
when you get there.

238
00:36:10,689 --> 00:36:13,886
So if you<i>'</i>re going to shoot me, go ahead.

239
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:18,958
Because I<i>'</i>d rather be shot
than go on being scared to death.

240
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:25,808
Go ahead.

241
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:42,881
I mean you no harm, Jenny Hayden.

242
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:59,285
<i>Here's OI' Blue Eyes, Francis Albert.</i>

243
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:20,722
<i>"</i>Start spreading the news

244
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:24,807
<i>"</i>I<i>'</i>m leaving today

245
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:29,278
<i>"</i>I want to be a part of it

246
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:33,843
<i>"</i>New York, New York<i>"</i>

247
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:36,888
I<i>'</i>m sorry.

248
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:39,047
I did awaken you.

249
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:49,560
Do they sing a lot where you live?

250
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:53,758
Yes. We sing.

251
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:57,764
Do you ever get hungry?

252
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:02,806
Empty here?

253
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,079
Like a car needs gas?

254
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:08,003
Yes.

255
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,488
This body has a terrible emptiness.

256
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,521
This is called <i>"</i>hungry<i>"</i>?

257
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:19,079
Yeah, and when people get hungry
they have to eat food.

258
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:22,484
Eat. Yes, we must do that.

259
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:27,438
We will stop at food station.
You have hungry too?

260
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,722
I<i>'</i>m starving.

261
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:32,405
I haven<i>'</i>t eaten since<i>...</i>

262
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:36,758
Oh, my God.

263
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,046
Look out! What are you doing?

264
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:49,284
Okay?

265
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:51,800
Okay? Are you crazy?

266
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:53,880
You almost got us killed.

267
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,962
You said you watched me.
You said you knew the rules!

268
00:38:58,049 --> 00:38:59,448
I do know the rules.

269
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:02,726
For your information,
that was a yellow light back there.

270
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:07,085
I watched you very carefully.

271
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:13,563
Red light: Stop. Green light: Go.
Yellow light: Go very fast.

272
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:18,447
- You better let me drive.
- I will drive.

273
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:23,799
Do you seriously expect me
to tell the President...

274
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:26,279
...that an alien has landed...

275
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:31,324
...assumed the identity of a dead
housepainter from Madison, Wisconsin...

276
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:34,526
...and is presently out
tooling around the countryside...

277
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:38,808
...in a hopped-up
orange and black 1977 Mustang?

278
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:42,197
We have the following givens:

279
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:47,400
That man, Scott Hayden, died last April.
He<i>'</i>s dead and buried, that<i>'</i>s verified.

280
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:49,679
He has no brothers or lookalike cousins.

281
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:52,124
But still, this morning,
at approximately 6:00...

282
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:55,042
All right, we have been through all of that.

283
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,718
I<i>'</i>m going to ask you now,
how could it happen?

284
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:00,683
We think it might be
some kind of a cloning deal...

285
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:03,488
...replication of an entire organism
from a single cell.

286
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,764
We found some hairs
from Scott Hayden<i>'</i>s head.

287
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:06,918
Is that possible?

288
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:10,445
I mean, can you clone a living organism
from the hair of a dead man?

289
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:13,164
Human hair consists of keratinised cells.

290
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:16,161
But in order to determine
whether replication is possible...

291
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:18,007
I asked you a question.

292
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,677
You mean us?

293
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:22,044
- In our present state of technology?
- Yes.

294
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:25,123
- No.
- What the hell are we talking about?

295
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,325
We<i>'</i>re hypothesizing a technology...

296
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:30,048
...that<i>'</i>s probably
100,000 years ahead of us.

297
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:32,279
We<i>'</i>re the ancients, Mr. Fox.

298
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:34,278
<i>"</i>Ancients<i>"</i>?

299
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:37,122
Technologically, yes. We<i>'</i>ve just started.

300
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:40,957
Even if you<i>'</i>re right, I still have problems.

301
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:42,448
His knowledge of English.

302
00:40:43,169 --> 00:40:44,966
Okay, listen to this.

303
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:49,525
I helped put this package together.

304
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:52,169
This was designed
so that an intelligent species...

305
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,479
...could get
a working knowledge of English.

306
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:55,968
Enough to get by, anyhow.

307
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:58,927
A couple-of-hundred-word vocabulary,
a rough idea of syntax.

308
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,964
Think of what it would mean to talk
to a being from a civilisation like that.

309
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:04,960
Think of what we could learn.

310
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:06,767
<i>... of 147 member states...</i>

311
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:11,127
...w<i>ho represent almost all</i>
<i>of the human inhabitants of planet Earth...</i>

312
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:12,444
<i>... I send greetings...</i>

313
00:41:12,529 --> 00:41:15,441
<i>"</i>Greetings,<i>"</i> that<i>'</i>s what he said
to Heinmuller on the road.

314
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:18,129
It<i>'</i>s also what the cannibal said
to the missionary...

315
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,245
...just before he ate him.

316
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:23,878
Now the question in this case is:
Who is the missionary...

317
00:41:24,129 --> 00:41:25,608
...and who are the cannibals?

318
00:41:28,729 --> 00:41:30,401
When do you have to be there?

319
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,278
What?

320
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:36,327
In Arizona. When do you have to be there?

321
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:40,919
Do you see this little star?

322
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,883
Star? What star? Where?

323
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:49,638
There.

324
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,606
We call that the sun.

325
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:56,805
When this little<i>...</i>

326
00:41:57,569 --> 00:41:59,207
When the sun...

327
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:04,965
...appears mid-sky three more times,
I must be at Arizona.

328
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:08,928
You mean, 12:00 noon,
three days from now?

329
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:10,358
Yes.

330
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:14,127
What happens
if you don<i>'</i>t get there in time?

331
00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:17,045
Then they will go.

332
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,718
- Without you?
- Yes.

333
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:22,367
What will you do then?

334
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:24,758
Then I will die.

335
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:26,518
Die?

336
00:42:33,649 --> 00:42:35,002
Understand?

337
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:43,645
You look for food station.

338
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:18,484
What?

339
00:43:21,249 --> 00:43:22,364
A deer.

340
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:25,082
A dead deer.

341
00:43:26,649 --> 00:43:28,207
<i>"</i>Dead deer,<i>"</i> why?

342
00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:33,082
People hunt them to eat for food.

343
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,567
Do deer eat people?

344
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:38,164
No.

345
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,917
Do people eat people?

346
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:43,404
No, of course not.
What do you think we are?

347
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:47,727
I think you are a very primitive species.

348
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:52,559
What are you, softhearted?

349
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:55,041
Cry when you saw <i>Bambi</i>?

350
00:43:55,489 --> 00:43:57,320
Define <i>"</i>Bambi<i>."</i>

351
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:59,969
He doesn<i>'</i>t understand.
He<i>'</i>s not from around here.

352
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:02,838
You don<i>'</i>t speak any English?

353
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:07,921
Steer clear of that bozo.

354
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:10,601
Define <i>"</i>bozo<i>."</i>

355
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:12,278
Jerk.

356
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,639
From Denver, here<i>...</i>

357
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:24,766
It<i>'</i>s south on Interstate 25.

358
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:28,322
Then you pick up l-40 westbound
at Albuquerque.

359
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:32,288
Will you forget the deer for a second?
I<i>'</i>m trying to show you something.

360
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:36,362
Where exactly in Arizona
are you supposed to meet your friends?

361
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:43,967
West of Winslow.

362
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:47,242
I see a little speck on the map,
but there<i>'</i>s<i>...</i>

363
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:48,957
Crater?

364
00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:52,919
Is that where you<i>'</i>re supposed
to meet them? Where the meteor hit?

365
00:44:53,009 --> 00:44:54,442
Why do you do this?

366
00:44:56,689 --> 00:44:59,726
Better safe than sorry.
Just in case something happens to me.

367
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:01,561
There<i>'</i>s one more thing.

368
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:04,247
The credit card, for the gas.

369
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:07,958
- You know how that worked?
- Why should something happen to you?

370
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,768
Who knows?

371
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:18,602
The way you drive, travelling with you
could be detrimental to the health.

372
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:28,078
That<i>'</i>s...

373
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:32,284
...me and Scott on our honeymoon.

374
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:36,567
A honeymoon is...

375
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:40,365
...what you call it when...

376
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:44,887
...two people first get married and they...

377
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:48,284
...go off together
after they<i>'</i>ve fallen in love.

378
00:45:49,609 --> 00:45:50,803
Define <i>"</i>love<i>."</i>

379
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:57,168
Love is<i>...</i>

380
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:03,805
It<i>'</i>s when you care...

381
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:09,166
...more for someone else
than you do for yourself.

382
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:12,798
But it<i>'</i>s not just that, it<i>'</i>s<i>...</i>

383
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:19,366
It<i>'</i>s when someone is a part of you.

384
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:22,808
And when they<i>...</i>

385
00:46:27,089 --> 00:46:28,204
What?

386
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:32,528
Scott is dead.

387
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:35,286
He was killed in an accident.

388
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:41,079
When someone you love...

389
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:44,607
...dies<i>...</i>

390
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:48,397
Shit.

391
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:54,808
Define <i>"</i>shit<i>."</i>

392
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:59,527
Don<i>'</i>t say that, that<i>'</i>s not a nice word.

393
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:02,878
Shit.

394
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:07,844
Don<i>'</i>t mind him,
he<i>'</i>s just learning to speak English.

395
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:10,125
He<i>'</i>s got a hell of a start on it.

396
00:47:10,209 --> 00:47:12,643
Who<i>'</i>s the devilled egg on white toast?

397
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:13,718
His.

398
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:16,922
Right. And a superburger.

399
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,805
Two orders of fries, two choc malts...

400
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:23,723
...and two Dutch apple pie
with whipped cream.

401
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:26,645
I had a wedge of it myself.

402
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:29,602
It<i>'</i>s terrific. Enjoy.

403
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:33,768
Dig in.

404
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:40,204
Wait. No. That<i>'</i>s your dessert.

405
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:43,160
You eat that with a fork.

406
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:47,206
This thing. Here.

407
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:48,848
Like this.

408
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:54,207
No, but you eat that last.

409
00:47:54,529 --> 00:47:56,679
Sandwich first, dessert last.

410
00:47:57,969 --> 00:47:59,038
Why?

411
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:03,282
I don<i>'</i>t know, that<i>'</i>s just how it<i>'</i>s done.

412
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:13,041
What<i>'</i>s the matter?

413
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:16,641
Dutch apple pie.

414
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:18,964
Good?

415
00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:22,528
It<i>'</i>s terrific.

416
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:30,164
For a primitive species we have our points.

417
00:48:30,249 --> 00:48:34,561
Anybody for Lincoln, Omaha or Chicago,
the bus leaves in five minutes.

418
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:47,126
I<i>'</i>ve got to go to the<i>...</i>

419
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:52,007
I<i>'</i>ll be right back.

420
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:07,405
Excuse me,
is there a back way out of here?

421
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:10,043
Yeah, sure, through the kitchen. Why?

422
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:14,797
- You know that fellow I came in with?
- Yes.

423
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:18,998
Could you give these things to him
after the bus leaves?

424
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:22,365
It<i>'</i>s just a map and some car keys
and a credit card.

425
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:26,328
- You sure, honey?
- Yeah, I<i>'</i>m positive. Thanks.

426
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:30,122
Hey, honey.

427
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:32,878
I wouldn<i>'</i>t go out
through the back door right now.

428
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:36,484
That friend of yours,
he<i>'</i>s out there in the parking lot.

429
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:39,803
Thanks.

430
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:45,206
Excuse me, miss.
You strike me as a meat-eater.

431
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:47,519
I could fix you up
with a nice haunch of venison.

432
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:49,839
Maybe even a shot of pork if you could<i>...</i>

433
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:53,767
Why, that son of a bitch.

434
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:55,118
No.

435
00:50:59,529 --> 00:51:02,248
Hey, what happened to the goddamn deer?

436
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:05,684
He went there, to the woods.

437
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:07,602
Okay, comedian.

438
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:10,918
Bingo.

439
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,166
Stop it. You leave him alone!

440
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:16,166
- Butt out, girlie.
- He doesn<i>'</i>t understand.

441
00:51:16,249 --> 00:51:18,968
- He<i>'</i>s a foreigner and doesn<i>'</i>t speak English.
- So what?

442
00:51:19,049 --> 00:51:20,118
Hey!

443
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:23,798
<i>"</i>Bingo<i>."</i>

444
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:50,440
Here, you<i>'</i>re losing your English, boy.

445
00:51:57,249 --> 00:51:59,717
Pick up your garbage and get going.

446
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:11,087
Oh, Jesus. You okay?

447
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:15,367
I thought guns make you a little bit jumpy,
Jenny Hayden.

448
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:17,724
You make me a little bit jumpy.

449
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:22,685
I thought I told you to stay away
from those bozos.

450
00:52:25,929 --> 00:52:28,318
It<i>'</i>s okay. I think I understand.

451
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:43,200
It looks better that way.

452
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:45,200
Thank you, Jenny Hayden.

453
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:52,758
All part of our friendly service.

454
00:52:56,489 --> 00:52:57,604
You okay, honey?

455
00:52:57,689 --> 00:52:58,804
I<i>'</i>m all right.

456
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:02,359
I wanted to tell you
that eastbound bus is about to go.

457
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:04,485
Want me to try to hold it?

458
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:11,963
No, thank you. Never mind.

459
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:14,279
Thanks, but never mind.

460
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:16,528
Good luck.

461
00:53:29,449 --> 00:53:32,407
I<i>'</i>m gonna get that bastard, Donnie Bob.
Right now.

462
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:41,368
Hey, look out!

463
00:53:44,729 --> 00:53:45,844
Take it easy!

464
00:53:46,129 --> 00:53:47,881
Up yours.

465
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:50,121
I<i>'</i>m gonna get that son of a bitch.

466
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:17,197
It<i>'</i>s their fault, the Mustang.
Son of a bitch hit me and just took off.

467
00:54:17,289 --> 00:54:18,358
Anybody get his number?

468
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:23,125
No, but it won<i>'</i>t be too hard to pick up.
1977 Mustang, Wisconsin plates on it.

469
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:33,804
That Mustang them State boys wanted<i>...</i>

470
00:54:33,889 --> 00:54:36,528
- Orange and black <i>'</i>77, Wisconsin plates?
- Yeah.

471
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:39,919
Well, kick her in the ass,
I think we got the bastard.

472
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:51,160
We<i>'</i>ve been here since 6:30 p.m.
When can we leave?

473
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:55,083
As soon as the Federals say so,
and not one damn minute before.

474
00:55:05,729 --> 00:55:07,765
Everybody tells it
pretty much the same way.

475
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:11,603
She had chances to get away from him,
but they left together with her driving.

476
00:55:11,689 --> 00:55:14,647
Does that sound like any kind
of kidnapping you ever heard of?

477
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:15,838
Mr. Shermin!

478
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:18,762
They spotted an orange and black
Mustang, Wisconsin plates...

479
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,282
...going west near Big Springs.

480
00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:21,518
Great.

481
00:55:24,649 --> 00:55:28,688
Scott and I met two winters ago
up at Iron Mountain, ice-skating.

482
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:33,122
I had on this little tight skating outfit.

483
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:39,078
I was showing off. He kept staring at me.

484
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:44,083
One thing lead to another
and a few months later...

485
00:55:44,169 --> 00:55:45,887
...we were on our honeymoon.

486
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:48,601
Honeymoon is nice?

487
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:51,519
Yeah, ours was beautiful.

488
00:55:54,209 --> 00:55:55,847
Define <i>"</i>beautiful<i>."</i>

489
00:55:56,169 --> 00:56:00,924
Beautiful is better than terrific...

490
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:04,843
...better than Dutch apple pie.

491
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:08,282
The best.

492
00:56:09,689 --> 00:56:11,008
The best.

493
00:56:30,769 --> 00:56:34,239
Gotta get a couple of hours sleep.
Just a couple, okay?

494
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:02,998
<i>Do not approach them.</i>

495
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:05,808
<i>Keep them under surveillance</i>
<i>until the Feds get there.</i>

496
00:57:06,129 --> 00:57:08,085
But what if they approach us?

497
00:57:08,169 --> 00:57:10,922
<i>In a life-threatening situation,</i>
<i>defend yourselves.</i>

498
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:13,159
<i>Otherwise,</i> w<i>ait for the Feds.</i>

499
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:15,008
Wait for the Feds.

500
00:57:15,089 --> 00:57:18,798
They get the 6:00 news,
and we get the shit end of the stick.

501
00:57:18,889 --> 00:57:20,447
That<i>'</i>s the way it is.

502
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:23,362
Yeah, well, it doesn<i>'</i>t have to be that way.

503
00:57:23,489 --> 00:57:28,199
I got a hunch, this might just develop
into a life-threatening situation.

504
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:33,161
Hi. We<i>'</i>d like a room for the night.
As far away from this as possible.

505
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:37,844
Boy, am I whipped.

506
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:43,643
My mom always said there wasn<i>'</i>t a thing
wrong with the world that a hot bath...

507
00:57:43,729 --> 00:57:46,118
...and a good night<i>'</i>s sleep couldn<i>'</i>t fix.

508
00:57:51,169 --> 00:57:52,761
What am I doing?

509
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:54,762
I must be getting punchy.

510
00:57:54,849 --> 00:57:57,841
It<i>'</i>s just that in that light
you look so much like Scott.

511
00:57:57,929 --> 00:58:01,126
- I wasn<i>'</i>t thinking.
- You said the nose is different.

512
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:02,198
What?

513
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,804
You said, <i>"</i>Your nose is different.

514
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:09,480
<i>"</i>He broke his twice and there<i>'</i>s something
else, something spooky about your eyes<i>."</i>

515
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:11,566
That<i>'</i>s word for word.

516
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:14,284
You remember everything you hear
word for word?

517
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:17,560
Everything I hear, everything I see.
Everything<i>...</i>

518
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,124
Everything this body feels.

519
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,237
The tub.

520
00:58:30,689 --> 00:58:33,840
<i>The questions are</i> w<i>orth 30 points apiece.</i>
<i>Jane, tell us about it.</i>

521
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:35,328
<i>Your final category today is...</i>

522
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,243
<i>Believe me, General.</i>
<i>I kno</i>w w<i>hat</i> w<i>ent</i> w<i>rong.</i>

523
00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:45,126
<i>The X-factor</i> w<i>asn't red.</i>

524
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:32,037
<i>I never kne</i>w <i>it could be like this.</i>

525
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:34,763
<i>Nobody ever kissed me the</i> w<i>ay you do.</i>

526
00:59:35,089 --> 00:59:36,283
<i>Nobody?</i>

527
00:59:36,649 --> 00:59:38,162
<i>No, nobody.</i>

528
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:42,246
<i>Not even one?</i>
<i>Out of all the men you've been kissed by?</i>

529
00:59:43,689 --> 00:59:45,759
<i>Well, that'll take some figuring.</i>

530
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,487
<i>Ho</i>w <i>many men you think there've been?</i>

531
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:49,639
<i>I</i> w<i>ouldn't kno</i>w.
<i>Can't you give me an estimate?</i>

532
00:59:49,729 --> 00:59:53,517
<i>Not</i> w<i>ithout an adding machine.</i>
<i>You have your adding machine</i> w<i>ith you?</i>

533
00:59:53,609 --> 00:59:55,406
<i>I forgot to bring it.</i>

534
00:59:55,609 --> 00:59:58,442
<i>Then I guess you</i> w<i>on't find out,</i> w<i>ill you?</i>

535
00:59:59,009 --> 01:00:01,318
Hey there, buddy. Are you in there?

536
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:09,244
It<i>'</i>s none of my business, but if that<i>'</i>s
your Mustang in the parking lot...

537
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:11,559
...there<i>'</i>s two cops trying to jigger the lock.

538
01:00:32,289 --> 01:00:34,359
The bastards ran one on us!

539
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:44,761
Papa Charlie 3.

540
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,488
Suspects in Mustang heading south
on Big Springs<i>'</i> bypass.

541
01:00:47,569 --> 01:00:48,922
We are in pursuit.

542
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:07,323
He<i>'</i>s got a gun.

543
01:01:09,929 --> 01:01:10,964
No!

544
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,608
Jenny Hayden?

545
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:27,198
Jenny Hayden?

546
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:35,079
<i>Papa Charlie 3.</i>

547
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:38,718
<i>Suspects on l-80 proceeding northbound.</i>
<i>Still in pursuit.</i>

548
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:01,089
It sounds impossible,
but I have people that say...

549
01:03:01,169 --> 01:03:04,081
...they saw him carrying her out
of the burning wreckage.

550
01:03:04,169 --> 01:03:06,000
Then they disappeared in the smoke.

551
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:09,684
I<i>'</i>ve had the police check the entire area
and there are no bodies.

552
01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:11,122
Oh, thanks.

553
01:03:11,249 --> 01:03:14,685
I assume that they<i>'</i>re still alive
and they<i>'</i>re probably headed west.

554
01:03:14,769 --> 01:03:16,839
I<i>'</i>m going to Grand Junction, Colorado.

555
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:21,241
The Army is setting up some kind
of a roadblock on l-70. I<i>'</i>m going.

556
01:07:21,649 --> 01:07:22,968
Hey, Mark!

557
01:07:24,849 --> 01:07:27,647
- You<i>'</i>re wanted on the horn. Urgent.
- Okay.

558
01:07:32,529 --> 01:07:35,566
Hello? I<i>'</i>ve probably been cut off. Hello?

559
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:38,240
Hello, I was talking to the police.

560
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:40,439
<i>I'm not the police, Mrs. Hayden.</i>

561
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:42,599
<i>My name is Mark Shermin,</i>
<i>National Security.</i>

562
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:45,125
You wanted to talk about kidnapping?

563
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:49,277
Yeah, that<i>'</i>s why I<i>'</i>m calling.
You see, there<i>'</i>s been a mistake.

564
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:51,564
There hasn<i>'</i>t been a kidnapping.

565
01:07:51,769 --> 01:07:53,999
We<i>'</i>re worried about you, Mrs. Hayden.

566
01:07:54,089 --> 01:07:55,886
<i>I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.</i>

567
01:07:56,009 --> 01:07:58,842
I wanted to clear it up.
There hasn<i>'</i>t been a kidnapping.

568
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:00,761
Where are you talking from?

569
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:03,599
I don<i>'</i>t know. A truck stop somewhere.

570
01:08:03,689 --> 01:08:05,919
<i>Can I pick you up?</i>
<i>I gotta ask you some questions.</i>

571
01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:07,567
- Miss?
- Hold on a second.

572
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:09,243
You looking for a fella?

573
01:08:09,329 --> 01:08:12,048
About yea tall, red plaid shirt
and kind of nice looking?

574
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,278
Have you seen him?

575
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:16,520
He hitched a ride west with our night cook
about half an hour ago.

576
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:18,361
Thank you, thank you very much.

577
01:08:18,449 --> 01:08:20,599
Look, I<i>'</i>m hanging up now. I<i>'</i>ve gotta go.

578
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:22,919
If you want,
call me in Madison in a few days.

579
01:08:23,009 --> 01:08:25,603
<i>- I'm in the phone book.</i>
- Wait, Mrs. Hayden.

580
01:08:25,849 --> 01:08:29,888
Do you know who or what
you were kidnapped by?

581
01:08:31,369 --> 01:08:33,678
He doesn<i>'</i>t want to hurt anybody.

582
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:37,162
Really, can<i>'</i>t you just leave him alone?

583
01:08:37,889 --> 01:08:40,687
Hello? Damn it!

584
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,325
I need a ride west, fast.

585
01:08:47,049 --> 01:08:50,007
I<i>'</i>ll take you. Come on, let<i>'</i>s go.

586
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:08,927
What<i>'</i>s your line?

587
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:11,122
- <i>"</i>Line<i>"</i>?
- Work.

588
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:14,003
What do you do
when you<i>'</i>re not hitching rides?

589
01:09:14,089 --> 01:09:15,727
I make maps.

590
01:09:16,409 --> 01:09:17,922
Make any money?

591
01:09:20,409 --> 01:09:21,808
I make maps.

592
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:26,361
You don<i>'</i>t get rich cooking, either,
believe me.

593
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:30,039
I got a girl, she<i>'</i>s getting ready
to go to college this fall.

594
01:09:30,129 --> 01:09:32,563
My wife had to go back nursing
to help me pay for it.

595
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:34,480
Here, you wanna smoke?

596
01:09:36,849 --> 01:09:38,487
Yeah, my little baby.

597
01:09:38,569 --> 01:09:41,288
Says she wants to be a doctor.
I don<i>'</i>t know.

598
01:09:41,569 --> 01:09:44,845
Costs an arm and a leg
to raise up kids these days.

599
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:46,727
<i>"</i>An arm and a leg<i>"</i>?

600
01:09:46,969 --> 01:09:49,563
Bread. Geetus. Money. And lots of it.

601
01:10:07,929 --> 01:10:09,362
You all right?

602
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:13,845
You<i>'</i>re not from around here, are you?

603
01:10:33,849 --> 01:10:35,328
What the John?

604
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,958
Some kind of roadblock, I guess.

605
01:10:40,089 --> 01:10:41,807
<i>"</i>Roadblock, I guess<i>."</i>

606
01:10:55,569 --> 01:10:58,037
Keep them in line.
They<i>'</i>re slipping around the end.

607
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:00,085
Yes, sir. Sergeant, you heard the man.

608
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:03,719
Right away, sir. Get in line. Line up.

609
01:11:09,209 --> 01:11:11,677
Move to the right and stay in line.

610
01:11:15,369 --> 01:11:19,123
Stay in line. All you pedestrians, line up.

611
01:11:30,409 --> 01:11:34,197
Line up. Move to the right and stay in line.

612
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:42,244
Oh, no.

613
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:47,764
You gotta help me, okay?

614
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:09,918
Stop him! After that car! After him!

615
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:49,639
Thank God! How did you get here?

616
01:12:49,969 --> 01:12:52,244
I hitched a ride with a cook.

617
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:57,043
It<i>'</i>s good to see you, Jenny Hayden.

618
01:13:02,289 --> 01:13:04,757
We gotta get out of here. Come on.

619
01:13:34,809 --> 01:13:37,482
I<i>'</i>ve done something wrong, Jenny Hayden?

620
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:46,359
I wake up alone. You<i>'</i>re gone.

621
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,486
Not a word. Nothing.

622
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:54,604
You were right.
To be with me is not good for your health.

623
01:13:56,449 --> 01:14:00,442
You could have at least told me
where you were going. Said goodbye.

624
01:14:02,929 --> 01:14:04,157
<i>"</i>Goodbye<i>"</i>?

625
01:14:05,169 --> 01:14:06,397
Goodbye.

626
01:14:10,169 --> 01:14:12,000
You don<i>'</i>t know what<i>...</i>

627
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:14,128
Teach me this.

628
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:18,598
Well, I don<i>'</i>t know. It<i>'</i>s a custom.

629
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:21,078
It<i>'</i>s...

630
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,963
...how you tell somebody
that you<i>'</i>ll miss them...

631
01:14:27,049 --> 01:14:29,768
...that you wish them well.

632
01:14:31,409 --> 01:14:33,400
That you hope<i>...</i>

633
01:14:35,449 --> 01:14:37,963
Her tooth coming in<i>. Pobrecita.</i>

634
01:14:42,369 --> 01:14:44,644
Can anyone have babies?

635
01:14:48,129 --> 01:14:49,482
Just women.

636
01:14:51,489 --> 01:14:54,925
I understand the reproductive process
as you know it.

637
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:58,168
As we know it?

638
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:04,041
You have a baby?

639
01:15:05,609 --> 01:15:06,644
No.

640
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,088
No babies.

641
01:15:12,289 --> 01:15:13,517
Why not?

642
01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:20,999
Scott and I wanted to have a baby.

643
01:15:22,049 --> 01:15:25,837
It just turned out I couldn<i>'</i>t.

644
01:15:28,249 --> 01:15:31,719
I<i>'</i>m one of those lucky ladies that just...

645
01:15:33,969 --> 01:15:35,687
...can<i>'</i>t have one.

646
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:06,359
Here, a blanket! It<i>'</i>s dry.

647
01:16:35,129 --> 01:16:37,882
You better get out of those wet clothes.

648
01:16:39,169 --> 01:16:40,761
Better get warm.

649
01:16:42,129 --> 01:16:44,438
You know what pneumonia is? No?

650
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:48,477
Well, you<i>'</i>re gonna find out
unless we get you dry in a hurry.

651
01:16:56,209 --> 01:16:57,881
Here, put this on.

652
01:19:06,849 --> 01:19:07,486
Hi there.

653
01:19:07,569 --> 01:19:10,129
Mr. Fox has been delayed.
He<i>'</i>s going to be late.

654
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:11,324
What<i>'</i>s going on here?

655
01:19:11,409 --> 01:19:15,960
According to our estimates, that object
was headed for someplace in Arizona.

656
01:19:16,129 --> 01:19:19,519
Intelligence thinks the visitor is on his way
to make a rendezvous.

657
01:19:19,609 --> 01:19:22,203
Go on inside. Make yourself at home.

658
01:19:49,489 --> 01:19:51,445
Welcome to planet Earth.

659
01:20:17,249 --> 01:20:18,682
Where are we?

660
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:23,488
I think we are coming to Winslow soon.

661
01:20:38,409 --> 01:20:40,286
Why didn<i>'</i>t you wake me?

662
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:42,405
I like to watch you sleep.

663
01:20:44,609 --> 01:20:46,201
I don<i>'</i>t know why.

664
01:20:47,569 --> 01:20:49,002
It<i>'</i>s strange.

665
01:20:50,009 --> 01:20:52,967
I think I am becoming
a planet Earth person.

666
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:56,604
Do you have to go back?

667
01:20:58,809 --> 01:21:01,642
Isn<i>'</i>t there some way you could stay?

668
01:21:03,089 --> 01:21:05,205
No. I must go back.

669
01:21:14,009 --> 01:21:17,604
But there is something I must tell you.

670
01:21:19,769 --> 01:21:21,805
I gave you a baby tonight.

671
01:21:24,369 --> 01:21:25,404
No.

672
01:21:26,729 --> 01:21:29,368
That<i>'</i>s impossible. I can<i>'</i>t have a child.

673
01:21:29,609 --> 01:21:32,965
I<i>'</i>ve been to a doctor, a couple of them.

674
01:21:33,049 --> 01:21:35,005
Believe what I tell you.

675
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:39,042
A boy baby.

676
01:21:42,129 --> 01:21:45,599
He will be human,
a baby of your husband, but...

677
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:47,919
...also he will be my baby.

678
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:55,238
He will know everything I know and when
he grows to manhood he will be a teacher.

679
01:22:02,049 --> 01:22:04,358
If you do not want this baby...

680
01:22:05,569 --> 01:22:07,844
...tell me now, I will stop it.

681
01:22:38,729 --> 01:22:41,687
Which is your star?
Can you see it from here?

682
01:22:42,009 --> 01:22:43,078
Why?

683
01:22:44,609 --> 01:22:47,601
I want to show him
where his father came from.

684
01:22:55,889 --> 01:22:57,038
There.

685
01:22:58,689 --> 01:22:59,724
No.

686
01:23:01,849 --> 01:23:02,918
Wait<i>...</i>

687
01:23:07,329 --> 01:23:08,523
There...

688
01:23:08,929 --> 01:23:10,362
...low in the sky.

689
01:23:12,169 --> 01:23:13,318
There.

690
01:23:14,569 --> 01:23:15,843
I see it.

691
01:23:22,009 --> 01:23:24,000
You<i>'</i>d better get dressed.

692
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,240
We are coming to Winslow.

693
01:23:29,169 --> 01:23:31,763
I hope to God we<i>'</i>re on the right train.

694
01:23:31,849 --> 01:23:35,364
I don<i>'</i>t know,
that looks awful big for Winslow, Arizona.

695
01:24:01,289 --> 01:24:02,483
No.

696
01:24:05,769 --> 01:24:07,088
Las Vegas!

697
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:09,204
What?

698
01:24:11,089 --> 01:24:14,206
I think we<i>'</i>ve gone
about 300 miles past Winslow.

699
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:17,844
We<i>'</i>re still going to be okay.

700
01:24:18,089 --> 01:24:20,728
All we gotta do is rent a car,
and with a little luck...

701
01:24:20,809 --> 01:24:23,164
...we<i>'</i>ll be back there
before noon tomorrow.

702
01:24:24,209 --> 01:24:26,962
Just try not to be too conspicuous, okay?

703
01:24:27,249 --> 01:24:28,477
Come on.

704
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:37,679
$500,000, folks!
Who<i>'</i>s gonna take it home?

705
01:24:37,769 --> 01:24:40,920
Hit the giant jackpot
and your troubles are over!

706
01:24:41,129 --> 01:24:42,608
$500,000, folks.

707
01:24:42,689 --> 01:24:45,044
Define <i>"</i>giant jackpot<i>."</i>

708
01:24:45,329 --> 01:24:47,684
A giant jackpot is a lot of money.

709
01:24:47,769 --> 01:24:51,205
Money? Geetus, bread, an arm and a leg?

710
01:24:51,289 --> 01:24:52,688
Where did you get that?

711
01:24:52,849 --> 01:24:55,079
We don<i>'</i>t have time
to fool with the slot machines.

712
01:24:55,169 --> 01:24:57,444
We gotta find a rent-a-car place and<i>...</i>

713
01:24:59,569 --> 01:25:01,241
Where<i>'</i>s my wallet?

714
01:25:01,809 --> 01:25:03,288
- My wallet.
- What is wrong?

715
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:05,519
Where the hell is my wallet?

716
01:25:07,449 --> 01:25:08,768
What are we gonna do now?

717
01:25:09,209 --> 01:25:10,437
Is all right.

718
01:25:10,529 --> 01:25:13,680
But you don<i>'</i>t understand.
No credit card, no money, no car.

719
01:25:13,769 --> 01:25:16,363
- We<i>'</i>re never going to get there on time.
- Is all right.

720
01:25:23,689 --> 01:25:24,758
Now.

721
01:25:31,129 --> 01:25:32,244
Damn!

722
01:25:48,089 --> 01:25:51,604
That<i>'</i>s a handy talent you got there
but you better spread it around.

723
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:55,762
These guys get kind of curious
if you hit too many jackpots at once.

724
01:26:26,809 --> 01:26:30,165
Choppers from the Air Cav
will search the area on a quarter-mile grid.

725
01:26:30,249 --> 01:26:32,444
- Good, I<i>'</i>m glad you<i>'</i>re here.
- What is this about?

726
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:34,446
You<i>'</i>re a man
of some scientific attainment.

727
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:37,880
Don<i>'</i>t you recognise an emergency
autopsy room when you see one?

728
01:26:38,289 --> 01:26:39,608
With leather tie-straps?

729
01:26:40,169 --> 01:26:42,205
You behave yourself, Mark.

730
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:44,638
Is this your latest update?

731
01:26:44,729 --> 01:26:46,242
According to NORAD...

732
01:26:46,329 --> 01:26:50,242
...his original course and rate of descent
would have taken him here...

733
01:26:50,609 --> 01:26:51,519
...south of Winslow.

734
01:26:51,609 --> 01:26:53,122
I see. Anything else?

735
01:26:53,209 --> 01:26:55,120
The Cobra guys
were asking about ammunition.

736
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:58,246
Helicopter attack units
will carry live ammo at all times.

737
01:26:58,529 --> 01:27:01,123
- This is to be considered a combat mission.
- Right.

738
01:27:04,049 --> 01:27:07,405
Listen, Mr. Fox,
I<i>'</i>d like to be a team player...

739
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:10,128
...but I want to call something
to your attention.

740
01:27:10,209 --> 01:27:13,121
If there<i>'</i>s one thing I don<i>'</i>t need,
it<i>'</i>s a lecture on morality.

741
01:27:13,209 --> 01:27:15,165
All right, okay, screw morality.

742
01:27:15,249 --> 01:27:17,922
What happened to good manners?
We invited him here.

743
01:27:18,009 --> 01:27:20,477
- I have no time for this.
- I<i>'</i>m trying to make a point.

744
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,048
So am I, damn it.

745
01:27:22,289 --> 01:27:25,565
You make a great show of being a rebel,
but the fact is this:

746
01:27:26,009 --> 01:27:28,523
You are a GS-11 public servant.

747
01:27:29,089 --> 01:27:31,603
Anytime that becomes
too much of a burden...

748
01:27:31,729 --> 01:27:36,041
...you can go back to Cornell,
or wherever it was that we found you.

749
01:27:36,129 --> 01:27:38,802
And let<i>'</i>s see you get by
on an instructor<i>'</i>s salary.

750
01:27:38,889 --> 01:27:41,084
Now shape up or get out.

751
01:27:41,609 --> 01:27:42,678
Is that clear?

752
01:27:42,769 --> 01:27:45,806
Mr. Fox, there<i>'</i>s been
a possible sighting in Las Vegas.

753
01:27:46,049 --> 01:27:50,679
- They<i>'</i>re probably headed in this direction.
- Let<i>'</i>s set up a command post in Winslow.

754
01:27:52,849 --> 01:27:54,362
You<i>'</i>d better get out there...

755
01:27:55,049 --> 01:27:57,847
...providing you still want to be
a member of the team.

756
01:27:58,489 --> 01:27:59,604
You do, don<i>'</i>t you?

757
01:28:02,129 --> 01:28:04,040
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then get going.

758
01:28:05,329 --> 01:28:07,399
Get rid of that damn cigar.

759
01:28:16,529 --> 01:28:19,839
We ought to be coming to the crater
anytime now.

760
01:28:21,089 --> 01:28:23,478
You<i>'</i>re gonna make it.
You<i>'</i>re gonna go home.

761
01:28:25,689 --> 01:28:27,361
You want to, don<i>'</i>t you?

762
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:29,122
Yes, of course.

763
01:28:38,089 --> 01:28:39,886
What<i>'</i>s it like up there?

764
01:28:40,809 --> 01:28:42,401
It is beautiful.

765
01:28:43,489 --> 01:28:45,241
Not like this, but it is beautiful.

766
01:28:46,529 --> 01:28:49,805
There is only one language.
One law. One people.

767
01:28:49,929 --> 01:28:51,840
And there is no war, no hunger...

768
01:28:51,969 --> 01:28:54,722
...and the strong
do not victimise the helpless.

769
01:28:55,169 --> 01:28:59,765
We are very civilised,
but we have lost something, I think.

770
01:29:01,609 --> 01:29:04,328
You are all so much alive. All so different.

771
01:29:06,489 --> 01:29:09,799
I will miss the cooks
and the singing and the dancing.

772
01:29:11,249 --> 01:29:12,443
And the eating.

773
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:30,240
And the other things.

774
01:29:54,169 --> 01:29:56,285
Morning, folks. What<i>'</i>ll you have?

775
01:29:57,049 --> 01:29:58,243
Coffee.

776
01:29:58,489 --> 01:29:59,524
Dutch apple pie?

777
01:30:00,289 --> 01:30:03,565
- How about some nice cherry cobbler?
- That<i>'</i>ll be fine.

778
01:30:08,129 --> 01:30:09,403
And whipped cream.

779
01:30:09,489 --> 01:30:11,081
Coming right up.

780
01:30:11,409 --> 01:30:13,479
How long does it take to get to the crater?

781
01:30:13,569 --> 01:30:16,561
Driving? Not long. Five, six minutes is all.

782
01:30:17,369 --> 01:30:19,803
I want you to try this cherry cobbler.

783
01:30:19,929 --> 01:30:23,399
And if you don<i>'</i>t like it,
you don<i>'</i>t have to pay for it.

784
01:30:28,009 --> 01:30:29,158
It<i>'</i>s delicious.

785
01:30:29,249 --> 01:30:30,841
My wife made it.

786
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:33,282
Is very good.

787
01:30:55,729 --> 01:30:57,401
Do you have somebody?

788
01:30:59,089 --> 01:31:00,363
A wife, like...

789
01:31:01,209 --> 01:31:02,483
...up there?

790
01:31:03,609 --> 01:31:04,644
No.

791
01:31:05,609 --> 01:31:06,678
No?

792
01:31:08,769 --> 01:31:10,282
I wish<i>...</i>

793
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:12,928
I wish<i>...</i>

794
01:31:14,169 --> 01:31:15,284
What?

795
01:31:21,889 --> 01:31:24,357
Morning, folks.
Is that your Cadillac outside?

796
01:32:21,209 --> 01:32:22,961
All right, go ahead.

797
01:32:25,969 --> 01:32:27,482
Yeah, hold it. Yeah, okay.

798
01:32:36,489 --> 01:32:38,605
I<i>'</i>d like to talk to these people alone.

799
01:32:38,769 --> 01:32:41,363
I<i>'</i>ll be right outside if you need me.

800
01:32:42,649 --> 01:32:46,927
George Fox just called in on the radio,
said to say they<i>'</i>re on their way over.

801
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:10,084
I<i>'</i>m Mark Shermin, SETI,
the Search for Extraterrestrial<i>...</i>

802
01:33:13,209 --> 01:33:16,201
Mrs. Hayden, we talked on the phone.

803
01:33:17,249 --> 01:33:19,001
This is just such a<i>...</i>

804
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:23,203
Do you mind if I sit down?

805
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:31,842
There<i>'</i>s so many questions I<i>'</i>d like to ask,
I hardly even know where to begin.

806
01:33:33,049 --> 01:33:34,880
Is there anything I can do for you?

807
01:33:35,329 --> 01:33:36,728
You can let him go.

808
01:33:37,489 --> 01:33:38,717
I can<i>'</i>t.

809
01:33:39,609 --> 01:33:41,918
Really, I can<i>'</i>t. I<i>'</i>m sorry.

810
01:33:42,729 --> 01:33:43,718
Is it<i>...</i>

811
01:33:43,969 --> 01:33:46,164
Are you supposed to meet someone here?

812
01:33:46,249 --> 01:33:47,238
Yes.

813
01:33:47,329 --> 01:33:49,684
You don<i>'</i>t understand,
there isn<i>'</i>t much time.

814
01:33:49,769 --> 01:33:51,885
Why here? Why the crater?

815
01:33:53,689 --> 01:33:55,964
Have people from your world
been here before?

816
01:33:56,409 --> 01:33:57,762
Before, yes.

817
01:33:58,449 --> 01:34:01,327
We are interested in your species.

818
01:34:02,529 --> 01:34:05,123
You mean you<i>'</i>re some kind
of an anthropologist?

819
01:34:05,329 --> 01:34:07,889
Is that what you<i>'</i>re doing here?
Just checking us out?

820
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:09,840
You are a strange species...

821
01:34:10,809 --> 01:34:11,924
...not like any other.

822
01:34:13,489 --> 01:34:15,844
And you would be surprised
how many there are.

823
01:34:16,209 --> 01:34:18,120
Intelligent but savage.

824
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:24,162
Shall I tell you
what I find beautiful about you?

825
01:34:28,249 --> 01:34:31,366
You are at your very best
when things are worst.

826
01:34:32,969 --> 01:34:34,880
Let him go, Mr. Shermin, please.

827
01:34:39,089 --> 01:34:40,568
If he stays here...

828
01:34:41,529 --> 01:34:42,518
...he<i>'</i>ll die.

829
01:34:46,169 --> 01:34:48,364
Can<i>'</i>t you see he<i>'</i>s dying now?

830
01:34:58,009 --> 01:34:59,328
Thank you.

831
01:35:07,329 --> 01:35:08,648
Thank you.

832
01:35:34,649 --> 01:35:36,162
Wrong ones?

833
01:35:36,329 --> 01:35:38,559
They sure as hell fit the description.

834
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:42,198
No. The guy we<i>'</i>re looking for
is a lot older.

835
01:36:05,929 --> 01:36:08,489
Where are they?
What have you done with them?

836
01:36:08,569 --> 01:36:12,721
- Trooper, where are your prisoners?
- Wrong ones. We had to let them go.

837
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,083
You what?

838
01:36:26,409 --> 01:36:28,445
Shermin, you are finished.

839
01:36:28,729 --> 01:36:31,323
I will have you eviscerated for this.

840
01:36:31,729 --> 01:36:34,846
Well, as much as I hate
to stoop to symbolism.

841
01:37:24,209 --> 01:37:25,847
I hear something.

842
01:37:38,929 --> 01:37:40,123
Give me your hand.

843
01:39:10,009 --> 01:39:14,207
All units, this is Fox.
I want warning fire only.

844
01:39:14,609 --> 01:39:15,962
When ready, roger that.

845
01:39:16,649 --> 01:39:18,162
I copy. Here we go.

846
01:40:03,529 --> 01:40:08,125
<i>Mrs. Hayden, you and your companion</i>
<i>must stop immediately.</i>

847
01:40:08,969 --> 01:40:11,767
<i>Stop</i> w<i>here you are or</i> w<i>e</i> w<i>ill open fire.</i>

848
01:40:12,569 --> 01:40:15,527
<i>I repeat, stop</i> w<i>here you are.</i>

849
01:40:15,969 --> 01:40:18,119
<i>We have orders to open fire.</i>

850
01:40:21,289 --> 01:40:23,644
<i>Last</i> w<i>arning, Mrs. Hayden.</i>

851
01:40:23,729 --> 01:40:26,880
<i>You and your companion</i>
<i>must stop immediately.</i>

852
01:40:27,129 --> 01:40:29,689
<i>We have orders to open fire.</i>

853
01:40:55,089 --> 01:40:56,841
<i>Last</i> w<i>arning, Mrs. Hayden.</i>

854
01:40:56,929 --> 01:41:00,080
<i>For your o</i>w<i>n safety,</i>
<i>you must stop</i> w<i>here you are.</i>

855
01:41:30,929 --> 01:41:32,487
What the hell is that?

856
01:43:38,689 --> 01:43:40,008
I must go.

857
01:43:42,409 --> 01:43:44,047
Take me with you.

858
01:43:44,169 --> 01:43:46,080
- I cannot.
- Please.

859
01:43:46,209 --> 01:43:47,801
You will die there.

860
01:43:47,889 --> 01:43:49,561
I don<i>'</i>t think I care.

861
01:43:49,649 --> 01:43:50,843
I care.

862
01:43:51,049 --> 01:43:52,198
Now...

863
01:43:53,329 --> 01:43:57,004
...tell me again how to say goodbye.

864
01:44:00,129 --> 01:44:01,448
Kiss me...

865
01:44:03,769 --> 01:44:05,839
...and tell me you love me.

866
01:44:07,489 --> 01:44:08,842
I love you.

867
01:44:15,689 --> 01:44:18,362
I<i>'</i>m never going to see you again, am I?

868
01:44:20,289 --> 01:44:21,324
No.

869
01:44:25,769 --> 01:44:27,122
I love you.

870
01:44:37,449 --> 01:44:39,360
Tell the baby about me.

871
01:44:41,729 --> 01:44:42,923
I will.

872
01:45:00,409 --> 01:45:02,479
What should I do with this?

873
01:45:03,289 --> 01:45:05,007
The baby will know.

874
01:45:10,289 --> 01:45:12,086
Goodbye, Jenny Hayden.

875
01:45:19,169 --> 01:45:20,397
Goodbye.
