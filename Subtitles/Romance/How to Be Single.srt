00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:41,848
at least you can do me a favor

179
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,182
and not write shit like,

180
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:45,150
"I want to wake up
with my best friend."

181
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:46,818
Unless you want
my dick to fall off.

182
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,519
And then maybe we could
become best friends,

183
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,354
and that'd be awesome.

184
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:53,223
Look, I spent half of last
year creating an algorithm

185
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,225
that trolls dating apps
for the best candidates

186
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:57,193
and downloads them
into an Excel spreadsheet.

187
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:59,995
So, I know
what I'm looking for.

188
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,830
Yeah, that's not weird at all.

189
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,598
What are you
really doing online?

190
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,333
I mean, you're a pretty girl.

191
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:06,801
This is New York City.

192
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:08,102
There's like a billion
people outside that door.

193
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:10,204
Yeah, but how many
eligible people?

194
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:14,440
Here. Okay, there are eight
million people in this city.

195
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:15,641
Sounds like a lot, right?

196
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:16,675
It does.

197
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:18,076
But, half of them are women.

198
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:20,411
And as hard as
I tried in college,

199
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:21,879
I don't swing that way.

200
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:23,547
How hard did you try?
Let it go.

201
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:24,681
Okay.

202
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,049
So, four million men.

203
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:27,617
And then you got to
have some age limits.

204
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:29,352
Let's say over 20.
Gotta keep it legal.

205
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:31,120
Under 40. Keep it sexy.

206
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:32,287
Now, it's a million.

207
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:35,690
Right. We're talking
about a million guys.

208
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:38,626
But half of them are married.

209
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,694
10 percent are gay.

210
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,495
I want someone
college educated.

211
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:44,597
Not too ugly.

212
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,764
So...

213
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,031
There's your boyfriend.

214
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,766
I wish.

215
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:51,435
He's got to be
taller than me...

216
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,437
(CHUCKLES)

217
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,705
And he's got to want kids.

218
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,506
So, yeah, I'm on 10 different

219
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:59,307
dating websites to
increase my odds.

220
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:00,808
So, what do you say?

221
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,476
You let me treat this bar
like it's my living room

222
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:05,318
and I won't call the cops every
night with a noise complaint.

223
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:09,048
Okay. Very cute.
These are the women?

224
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,082
Hmm.

225
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:11,149
Thanks.

226
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:14,118
Mmm. Mmm.

227
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,552
See you around.

228
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:16,853
Stupid.

229
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:18,054
Um, have a nice night.

230
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:20,456
Wait. What?
Where are you going?

231
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,657
I'm going home.

232
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,991
What?

233
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,859
I never want to
hear you say that again.

234
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:25,926
Ugh!

235
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:29,596
You're single now, okay?
You do not go home!

236
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:30,863
You shouldn't even have a home.

237
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:32,397
You should just
have 500 square feet

238
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,465
where you keep some clothes
and occasionally bathe.

239
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,534
Well, okay, technically,
I'm not, like, single.

240
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,202
We're just on a break.

241

Uh, there's no such thing as
a "break," Season-3 Ross.

242
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:43,339
No, we really are on a break.

243
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,973
We're just taking
a little bit of time apart

244
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:47,275
to make sure we really
want to be together.

245
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:49,844
Oh, so you're on some
kind of sexual rumspringa?

246
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:51,946
No.
Why didn't you say anything?

247
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:53,714
I could've made you
take a half-day!

248
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:54,781
It was my first day at work.

249
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,082
Rumspringa!

250
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:58,284
What? No! Where
are we going? (LAUGHS)

if you think you're gonna die.

Thank you, prom. (CHUCKLES)

goals or life goals.

Rum and Coke? Really?

I didn't think you'd want to do

00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:49,524
a Rum and Coke with
me on our first date.

Um, rum and Coke?
I got to find a live hamster.

trap a street rat.

Okay.

No. That was a trick.

293
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,244
You don't buy the drinks.
Boys buy the drinks.

294
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:22,614
It's kind of like a sexual
currency that they use,

295
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,583
so they're not actually
paying you to hook up.

Hey, uh, you know we're only
sleeping together for fun, right?

322
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:14,985
Because I'm not interested
in long-term relationships,

323
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:16,853
so I think I'm gonna
start seeing other people

should move on, too.

There's no reason to
stick around in the morning,

make an omelet.

and win themselves a prize?

1054
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:40,651
Doris, I'm coming
to you first, baby.

1055
00:45:42,988 --> 00:45:46,389
Whoa! It is a hole-puncher!

1056
00:45:46,391 --> 00:45:49,024
You have won
Kathy's credit card.

1057
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:50,358
Let's go, dance circle!

1058
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,193
Bridget, come on
in here, you slut!

1059
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:59,132
How many sliders does it take
to equal a whole burger?

1060
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:01,633
What?

1061
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:04,268
How many little burgers does it
take to make a whole burger?

1062
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,703
(SNORTS) You're crazy.

1063
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:07,904
Don't call me crazy.

1064
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:10,072
Don't ever call
a pregnant woman crazy.

1065
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:11,873
Okay. All right.
Not ever. Never.

1066
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,341
Okay.

1067
00:46:13,343 --> 00:46:15,276
How many little meats
make up a whole big meat?

1068
00:46:15,278 --> 00:46:17,277
I don't know, maybe four?

1069
00:46:19,014 --> 00:46:20,279
I've had seven.

1070
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:21,813
Eight. I meant eight.

1071
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:23,147
Is it four, or is it eight?

1072
00:46:23,149 --> 00:46:25,716
It's eight, or more.
Everyone knows that.

1073
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:26,817
Who told you that?

1074
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,185
The slider guy.

1075
00:46:30,055 --> 00:46:32,889
Please blink,
so I know you're in there.

1076
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:34,257
I'm sorry. (EXHALES) God.

1077
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:36,659
I just have blood pumping
through my body

1078
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:38,160
in an uncomfortable way

1079
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,729
and it feels like it's all
accumulating right here.

1080
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,131
Don't touch yourself like
that in my workplace.

1081
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,532
I need a man.

1082
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:45,766
A man?

1083
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:47,400
I don't know...
I don't know what's happening.

1084
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:49,135
It's, like, the hormones
or something.

1085
00:46:49,137 --> 00:46:53,973
Actually, the new guy has sort
of been checking you out.

1086
00:46:53,975 --> 00:46:55,855
Which one? He's...

1087
00:46:59,506 --> 00:47:00,946
Did you get it? No.

1088
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:03,081
All right. He's like...

1089
00:47:04,717 --> 00:47:06,216
Right over there.

1090
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,686
No. No. Why?

1091
00:47:10,688 --> 00:47:12,521
Because he's too young.

1092
00:47:12,523 --> 00:47:14,623
All young guys want to
do is have sex all day.

1093
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:17,993
All I need is just
a quick 10 minutes,

1094
00:47:17,995 --> 00:47:21,096
and then a really long nap.

1095
00:47:21,098 --> 00:47:22,964
<i>How old is that
little niblet, anyway?</i>

1096
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:26,367
Like, twenty-f... Seven?

1097
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:28,102
The only reason a guy like
that would ever talk to me

1098
00:47:28,104 --> 00:47:30,104
is to get a prescription
for medical marijuana.

1099
00:47:30,106 --> 00:47:31,705
So, no.

1100
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:33,606
I think he's coming over.
Yeah, he's totally wanting it.

1101
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:35,374
Wait, he might be
going to the food.

1102
00:47:35,376 --> 00:47:37,676
Don't look over there.
No, he's coming.

1103
00:47:38,578 --> 00:47:40,110
He's here.

1104
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:41,611
Just saw you looking
at me over there.

1105
00:47:41,613 --> 00:47:44,981
I thought I'd come over,
say "What's up."

1106
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:46,248
Hmm. Or...

1107
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,115
(CHUCKLES)

1108
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:49,716
Oh, my God, did I misread that?

1109
00:47:49,718 --> 00:47:51,651
(STUTTERS) Were you not...
Were you just talking about...

1110
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:54,053
Um, did you not
want me to come over?

1111
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,590
Hey, I'm Ken.

1112
00:47:59,592 --> 00:48:02,392
Hmm. (CHUCKLES)
You must be Alice's sister.

1113
00:48:02,394 --> 00:48:03,659
Um, do you want a drink? No.

1114
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:04,726
Can I get you...

1115
00:48:04,728 --> 00:48:07,495
I had a lot of
drinks earlier today.

1116
00:48:07,497 --> 00:48:08,996
(CLICKS TONGUE) (EXHALES)

1117
00:48:08,998 --> 00:48:10,530
Have you heard anything
about an after-party?

1118
00:48:10,532 --> 00:48:12,832
Or even, like,
another part of this party?

1119
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:17,502
Because this feels like
a longer day at work, than...

1120
00:48:17,504 --> 00:48:19,003
Oh, my God, am I boring you?

1121
00:48:19,005 --> 00:48:20,571
Is that... Are you
trying not to yawn?

1122
00:48:20,573 --> 00:48:22,606
Mmm-mmm. That's just your face?

1123
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:26,176
No, I'm sorry. I'm a doctor,
and I'm just really tired.

1124
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:28,411
What is it you were
saying you do?

1125
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:31,913
I wasn't, but I
work here, for now.

1126
00:48:31,915 --> 00:48:33,381
But, um...

1127
00:48:33,383 --> 00:48:36,050
Oh, my God,
are you having a stroke?

1128
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:37,551
Seriously, this is
the honeymoon.

1129
00:48:37,553 --> 00:48:39,519
Like, we just
met 30 seconds ago.

1130
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:41,587
Honestly, like, if we're not
gonna make it through this,

1131
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:43,455
I don't think we're
gonna make it at all.

1132
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:45,890
So, why don't you just,
like, let her rip?

1133
00:48:45,892 --> 00:48:47,852
Okay. Like, let it all out.

1134
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,426
Yeah.

1135
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,594
(YAWNS) How awesome was that?

1136
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,862
That feels so good.

1137
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,930
Right? (CHUCKLES)

1138
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,798
Who are you, again?

1139
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,932
I'm, uh, Ken.

1140
00:48:58,934 --> 00:49:00,633
And what's going on here?

1141
00:49:00,635 --> 00:49:02,067
Is this... (CHUCKLES)
I don't...

1142
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:03,635
Is this one of those
fetish things?

1143
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:07,238
Where you're, like,
a foot fetish. Am I the foot?

1144
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,506
Do you want to be the foot?

1145
00:49:09,508 --> 00:49:13,175
I'm not into feet, but I would
like to go out with you.

1146
00:49:13,177 --> 00:49:14,709
Oh.

1147
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:16,177
Yes. Why?

1148
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:18,145
Really? I...
Do you not want me to?

1149
00:49:18,147 --> 00:49:21,947
I do! I... That's not what I was saying.
No, I was just wondering why.

1150
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:23,782
Because I think you're hot.

1151
00:49:23,784 --> 00:49:26,050
(LAUGHS)
And I think you're funny.

1152
00:49:26,052 --> 00:49:28,585
And I like the face you make
when you're trying not to yawn.

1153
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:30,920
And then you have an
awesome yawn after that, so...

1154
00:49:30,922 --> 00:49:33,255
I mean, that's always something
I've looked for in a girl.

want the sandwich.

I really care about you.

And I just don't know if we want to
think too much in the long term,

1193
00:51:08,627 --> 00:51:11,894
only because I don't know
if I see a future with you.

1194
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:14,997
Normally, I break up with
people before the holidays,

just so, you know,
they don't get the wrong idea.

1196

But I just thought, since
we're dating other people,

1197

I would just wait and break up with
you on Martin Luther King Day.

means, but it sounds vaguely racist.

it's the easiest holiday

to break up with
someone on, you know?

no family obligations,

Valentine's Day.

you're seeing other people?

I'll tell you how it ends.

1222
00:52:31,124 --> 00:52:36,694
He kisses her, and she wakes
up and finally feels loved,

1223
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:38,996
and understood, and wanted.

1224
00:52:38,998 --> 00:52:41,999
But then, her friend sees him
dining with the peach lady

1225
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:44,134
and before she knows it,
she's kicked out

1226
00:52:44,136 --> 00:52:45,969
of the castle. (BOOK CLATTERS)

"The peach lady"?

1228
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:49,304
You bet your sweet ass
"the peach lady."

1229
00:52:49,306 --> 00:52:54,108
And now, you know, she's
fixating on all her mistakes

1230
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,511
and all the money
she spent on makeup

1231
00:52:57,513 --> 00:53:00,747
and blow-outs, and the heels!

1232
00:53:00,749 --> 00:53:03,116
The heels!
Walking around on these.

1233
00:53:03,118 --> 00:53:06,285
And I'm not supposed
to have any hair here.

1234
00:53:06,287 --> 00:53:08,954
No hair here,
but tons of it here.

1235
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:11,056
I'm supposed to have
a ton, a ton of it here.

1236
00:53:11,058 --> 00:53:12,357
You think this is all real?

1237
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,359
You think that it's all real?
No.

1238
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,993
And Spanx!

1239
00:53:15,995 --> 00:53:18,829
Girls. Never wear Spanx.

1240
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:20,330
Because the endgame
is to take them off, anyway

1241
00:53:20,332 --> 00:53:23,333
and then the prince is gonna
see all your dumplings

1242
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:25,001

GEORGE: Hey, hey. Okay.

These are kid scissors.
They don't work.

1251
00:53:39,013 --> 00:53:40,912
If your Spanx were made of
construction paper, they would.

1252
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:44,148
And that's how the story ends.

you to sign something

Oh, that was terrible.

1260

You scared all the kids,
terrified a lot of parents.

1261

kind of awesome.

For you. I'll take that.

Oh, no. That's Robin's.

Yeah. I like to keep
this on my own rack.

No, it's okay. I'm glad
you guys could come.

I know it's tough to be single
around this time of year, so...

1274
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:37,420
Why do people always say that? The
holidays is he best time to be single.

1275

Parties every night,
free-flowing booze.

00:54:47,163 --> 00:54:48,428
Thanks for having us.

1281
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:52,164
Yeah, sure. I know it's
been tough for you.

1282
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,598
For me? Yeah.

1283
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,333
No, I'm good.

Yeah. Yeah, I know,
she's really mature.

And, um, also, I told
her you're my cousin.

I brought you hot chocolate.

For what?

1297
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,154
For drinking.

Oh, I have to be back
at work in eight minutes.

bourbon in there.

a real-life spit take?

one in real life.

(GIGGLES) Yeah.

00:55:54,544 --> 00:55:56,143

1316
00:55:56,145 --> 00:56:00,447

00:56:17,462 --> 00:56:20,095
Okay. I mean, I don't
get Christmas trees, but...

1325
00:56:20,097 --> 00:56:23,364
Oh, are you Jewish? No, I just
don't get Christmas trees.

Oh, so, you're a monster.

I would definitely kill it.

No.

1329

And then those needles
fall into the rug

1330
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:33,471
and stab your feet
when you walk on them.

1331

We load him up with
a bunch of water,

1336
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:45,713
stuff one of those self-pouring
cat bottles on the side,

1337
00:56:45,715 --> 00:56:47,347
you're good to go for,
like, three weeks.

1338
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:49,015
I'm telling you, you're gonna
be begging this guy to die.

1339
00:56:49,017 --> 00:56:50,616
Yeah. Then, in three weeks

1340
00:56:50,618 --> 00:56:52,584
we throw this guy
out on the street,

1341
00:56:52,586 --> 00:56:54,252
and get ready
for Valentine's Day.

1342
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:55,853

for Valentine's Day?

Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's not...

1345
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:03,392
Listen, in three
weeks from now,

1346
00:57:03,394 --> 00:57:06,895
I think the novelty of this
whole thing will have worn off

1347
00:57:06,897 --> 00:57:11,633
and I think, the reality will set in,
which is that I work all the time

1348
00:57:11,635 --> 00:57:13,301
and I probably would
never see you,

1349
00:57:13,303 --> 00:57:16,637
and I'd probably have to
cancel all of our dates.

1350
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:19,239
And, when I did
finally see you,

1351
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:21,574
I would probably just
fall asleep on your face.

1352
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:23,042
Oh... Yeah, and then,

1353
00:57:23,044 --> 00:57:24,710
.you would go off,
and meet some girl at the gym.

1354
00:57:24,712 --> 00:57:27,646
Because you obviously have a lot
of time to spend at the gym

1355
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:29,214
and so would she, and

1356
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:30,848
I don't even know why we're
having this conversation.

1357
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,649
I mean, you are
obviously not a real thing

1358
00:57:32,651 --> 00:57:35,785
and I feel like we're wasting
air even talking about it.

1359
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:38,154
And I have hip problems,
real hip problems,

1360
00:57:38,156 --> 00:57:40,055
and not from doing fun things,

1361
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:42,791
like having sex,
but from gravity.

1362
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,492
And what we had was great.

1363
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:48,562
Thank you for
helping me out with that.

1364
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:49,863
That was fun.

1365
00:57:49,865 --> 00:57:52,799
But you will find
a girl your own age

1366
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:54,133
and then you can do fun things

1367
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:55,968
like look for trees
and whatever.

1368
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:59,404
But that's not what's happening
here, between you and me, so...

1369
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:00,571
Just so you know.

1370
00:58:00,573 --> 00:58:02,472

01:09:34,654 --> 01:09:36,587
I just thought I'd
grab some pancakes,

1564

This was our place.

1565
01:09:38,824 --> 01:09:39,989
Okay.

Who are you here with?

1567

JOSH'S DAD: Oh, my God.

something like that?

a problem with that?

with that. It's your body.

about that. It is beautiful!

thing I need to know.

home and take care of a baby?

and take care of a baby.

have a lot of fun together

1690
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:06,115
and then, one day, we would be
on this road trip together.

1691
01:14:06,117 --> 01:14:08,550
And I would be driving,
and then I'd get tired

1692

to let you drive.

I would feel very safe,

01:24:31,023 --> 01:24:32,922
But, probably not.
So, don't be offended.

1906
01:24:32,924 --> 01:24:34,690
I'm glad we had this talk, man.

1907
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,593
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
ALL: Whoo!

1908
01:24:41,064 --> 01:24:42,129
Whoo!

1909
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:45,598
DAVID: <i>Uh...</i>

1910
01:24:46,467 --> 01:24:48,467
You trying to hide from me?

1911
01:24:48,469 --> 01:24:50,936
Are you hiding from me? Hi.
Huh? Hi.

1912
01:24:50,938 --> 01:24:53,338
I didn't see you,
right over there.

1913
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,605
It's a good hiding spot.

1914
01:24:55,274 --> 01:24:57,440
Uh, listen.

1915
01:24:57,442 --> 01:24:58,874
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

1916
01:24:58,876 --> 01:25:01,009
Look, David, I'm sorry, I...

1917
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:02,443
I can't do this.

1918
01:25:02,445 --> 01:25:05,446
You made it so clear to me,
that you didn't want to, so...

1919
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:06,980
That's not why
I came here at all.

1920
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:10,249
I just came here
to apologize to you

1921
01:25:10,251 --> 01:25:12,050
for being such an asshole.

1922
01:25:12,052 --> 01:25:13,151
Oh.

1923
01:25:13,153 --> 01:25:14,318
Yeah.

1924
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,119
(BOTH CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY)

1925
01:25:16,121 --> 01:25:17,653
Well, you were right
about Phoebe.

1926
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:19,454
Oh, good. Did you talk to her?

1927
01:25:19,456 --> 01:25:22,323
Well, um, you know,
I'm working on it.

1928
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:25,392
But, uh, are you okay?

1929
01:25:25,394 --> 01:25:26,926
(CHORTLES)

1930
01:25:29,163 --> 01:25:30,595
I'm working on it.

1931
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:36,966
Happy Birthday.

1932
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:46,308
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

1933
01:25:51,481 --> 01:25:53,581
See? I told you
this would be fun.

1934
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:56,016
Although, I thought one of them
was, like, gonna punch each other

1935
01:25:56,018 --> 01:25:57,584
and that hasn't happened yet.

1936
01:25:57,586 --> 01:26:00,153
Robin, this isn't a joke.
This is my life.

1937
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,755
But you know what? I guess you
wouldn't actually understand that,

1938
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,723
because you've
never really cared

1939
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:06,157
about anybody enough
to ever get hurt.

1940
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,759
So, this type of thing
doesn't affect you.

1941
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:11,294
Okay. I'm sorry I invited them,

1942
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,495
but who gives a shit about me?

1943
01:26:12,497 --> 01:26:14,129
I do, because you're my friend!

1944
01:26:14,131 --> 01:26:16,798
Am I? Because
as far as I can tell,

1945
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,100
you only ever want to hang out
with me when you get dumped

1946
01:26:19,102 --> 01:26:20,868
and you need someone
to cheer you up.

1947
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:22,202
Well, you only ever
hang out with me

1948
01:26:22,204 --> 01:26:24,404
when you need me
to be your little sidekick.

1949
01:26:24,406 --> 01:26:28,174
The reason why I don't hang around with
you when you're in a relationship,

1950
01:26:28,176 --> 01:26:33,245
is because you just turn into this
lame-ass shell of a human being.

1951
01:26:33,247 --> 01:26:34,512
Nice.

1952
01:26:34,514 --> 01:26:35,446
Yeah, do you want
some real advice?

1953
01:26:35,448 --> 01:26:36,680
Yeah, what?

1954
01:26:36,682 --> 01:26:38,882
You're not gonna
find the right guy

1955
01:26:38,884 --> 01:26:41,351
by bumming free drinks
and slutting it up.

1956
01:26:41,353 --> 01:26:42,952
Where is this coming from?

1957
01:26:42,954 --> 01:26:44,920
This whole time, you've
been the one that's like,

1958
01:26:44,922 --> 01:26:47,856
"Oh, yeah, parties
and dicks and shots.

1959
01:26:47,858 --> 01:26:50,124
"Let's put shots
all over our bodies."

1960
01:26:50,126 --> 01:26:51,725
"More sparkles, bitch!"

1961
01:26:51,727 --> 01:26:53,927
It's about me
being sick of you just

1962
01:26:53,929 --> 01:26:56,262
meeting guys and
falling into their dick-sand.

1963
01:26:56,264 --> 01:26:57,396
Falling into their what?

1964
01:26:57,398 --> 01:26:59,197
Their dick-sand.

1965
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,866
It's like, every time
a guy just looks at you,

1966
01:27:01,868 --> 01:27:03,801
you just forget
who you are, and,

1967
01:27:03,803 --> 01:27:06,203
like... (MOCKINGLY) "Oh!"

1968
01:27:06,205 --> 01:27:08,805
You get sucked
into their world.

1969
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,640
At least when I do
decide I want a boyfriend,

1970
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,209
I'm gonna find someone who
likes me for who I really am,

1971
01:27:13,211 --> 01:27:16,612
because I know
who the fuck that is.

1972

(EXHALES)

1973
01:28:00,221 --> 01:28:01,486
Hey.

1974
01:28:01,488 --> 01:28:02,887
Oh, my God.

1975
01:28:03,456 --> 01:28:05,155
Happy Birthday.

(SCOFFS)

1977
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:08,724
It's your birthday!

1978
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,893
And I drank some of your gift.

1979
01:28:20,602 --> 01:28:22,101
You okay?

1980
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,439
No. No.

1981
01:28:35,314 --> 01:28:37,914
God, you look pretty
when you're pissed.

1982
01:28:46,123 --> 01:28:48,256
I missed these. (CHUCKLES)

1983
01:28:51,153 --> 01:28:53,394
What are we doing?
We're about to have sex.

1984
01:28:53,396 --> 01:28:54,477
What?

1985
01:28:55,022 --> 01:28:57,062
God. What?

1986
01:28:57,064 --> 01:29:00,398
So, ever since I saw you,
I feel like we fucked up.

1987
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,899
I shouldn't have let you go.

1988
01:29:03,435 --> 01:29:06,469
Because Michelle
and I are still together,

1989
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:08,204
and we're actually engaged

1990
01:29:08,206 --> 01:29:10,339
and I feel like we're fucking up.
What? What?

1991
01:29:10,341 --> 01:29:14,142
We're getting married, but I don't
know if I want to do it yet.

1992
01:29:14,144 --> 01:29:15,176
Oh, my God.

1993
01:29:15,178 --> 01:29:17,878
Wait! I'm just telling...
Oh, my God.

1994
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,379
Oh, my God.
Come here, come here.

1995
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:21,447
You just let me make out
with somebody else's fiance.

1996
01:29:21,449 --> 01:29:24,082
No, it's not cheating, since
we've already been together.

1997
01:29:24,084 --> 01:29:25,950
What are you doing?
Wait, just...

1998
01:29:25,952 --> 01:29:27,484
You told me you missed me!

1999
01:29:27,486 --> 01:29:29,752
I... That's the whole point,
I miss you all the time.

2000
01:29:29,754 --> 01:29:35,423
I saw you and you were so beautiful,
and you are so beautiful.

2001
01:29:35,425 --> 01:29:37,224
And I just need closure.

2002
01:29:37,226 --> 01:29:38,592
I think we need...
Is that what this...

2003
01:29:38,594 --> 01:29:40,226
This is closure for you? Yeah.

2004

down with somebody else?

(SIGHS) That's not...

2007
01:29:47,567 --> 01:29:50,301
I'm sorry, all right?

2008
01:29:50,303 --> 01:29:51,535
Uh, Alice.

2009
01:29:51,537 --> 01:29:52,669
No, you know, what?

2010
01:29:52,671 --> 01:29:55,271
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

2011
01:29:55,273 --> 01:29:58,073
I spent so much time
wanting you back

2012
01:29:58,075 --> 01:30:00,408
that, when I thought
that you wanted me back,

2013
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:03,978
it's like I lost
my mind for a second.

2014
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,913
Oh, my God. This is it!
This is the dick-sand.

2015
01:30:05,915 --> 01:30:07,681
I'm falling into your
dick-sand right now.

2016
01:30:07,683 --> 01:30:08,948
What?

2017
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:09,982
It's like quicksand,
but with dicks.

2018
01:30:09,984 --> 01:30:11,416
I don't have dick-sand.

2019

I'm so obsessed with
the idea of being in love,

2020
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:18,455
that I just, it's like...
I completely lose myself.

2021
01:30:18,457 --> 01:30:22,225
Like, I forget what I want
and I just disappear.

I'm like the horse
in <i>The Neverending Story.</i>

I don't think it's coming out
like it's inside your head.

Josh. I want to be alone.

2025

I know that
I've said that a lot.

2026
01:30:34,435 --> 01:30:36,435
But, for the first time
in my life,

2027
01:30:36,437 --> 01:30:40,405
I really, really,
truly mean it.
