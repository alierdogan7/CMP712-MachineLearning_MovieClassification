1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,039
I baptise thee, Catherine,

2
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,759
in the name ofthe Father, and the Son...

3
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,759
(Baby cries)
- ..and the Holy Ghost...

4
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,119
No-one who had ever seen Catherine Morland
in her infancy

5
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,879
would have supposed her
born to be a heroine.

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,039
Her situation in life,

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,039
the character of herfather and mother,

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,639
and her own person and disposition,

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,519
were all equally against her.

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,039
Afamily often children, of course,

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,719
will always be called a fine family,

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,599
where there are heads and arms
and legs enough forthe number.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,679
But the Morlands were, in general, very plain,

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,439
and Catherine, for many years of her life,
as plain as any.

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,479
Neitherwas it very wonderful

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,959
that Catherine, who had, by nature,
nothing heroic about her,

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,959
should prefer cricket and baseball
to dolls and books.

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,919
But by the age of 15,
appearances were mending.

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,439
Catherine Morland was in training for a heroine.

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,479
Yes!

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,039
Whoo! Whoo!

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,439
You know,
our Catherine has turned out rather well.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,439
- Come on, Catherine, let's carry on.
- No, later. Later.

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,679
She's quite a good-looking girl.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,359
Well, she is almost pretty today.

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,919
MRS MORLAND: And she has grown very fond
of reading of late.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,039
I wonder if it can be good for her, my dear,
to read quite so many novels?

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,439
Why ever not?

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,119
What could be a more innocent or harmless
pastime for a young girl than reading?

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,879
(Catherine reads) "He was interrupted
by a noise in the passage leading to the room.

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,519
It approached. The doorwas unlocked. A man
entered, dragging behind him a beautiful girl,

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,639
herfeatures bathed in tears
and suffering the utmost distress."

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,079
Take her!
Convey her where I shall never see her more!

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,479
Cathy!

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,919
What are you doing?

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,279
Nothing.

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,399
What do you want, anyway?

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,159
Mr and Mrs Allen are here.
Mother says you have to come straight away.

39
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,719
(Sighs)

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,959
No, said Dr Malleson, no other place will do
so well for a gouty constitution like Mr Allen's.

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,759
No other place will do so well for...

42
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,799
Ooh!

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,759
..for squandering money.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,439
Oh, fie, Mr Allen!

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,399
You know you love to see me happy.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,959
- And thinking ofthat...
- Catherine is young to go.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
But with Mr and Mrs Allen for protection,
I see no danger in it.

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,759
She's a good girl. I think we can trust her.

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,399
Why, Catherine, how you've grown!

50
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,879
Quite the young lady, isn't she, Mr Allen?

51
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,199
Mr and Mrs Allen come with an invitation,
Catherine.

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,439
MRS ALLEN: We would like you
to accompany us to Bath for a time.

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,879
Forwhen a young lady is to be a heroine,

54
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,079
something must and will happen
to throw adventure in her way.

55
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,199
(Snores)

56
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,999
(Reads) "Atumult of emotions stirred
in the bosom of Adeline. Fear gripped her heart,

57
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,959
that, at any moment,
ruffians would fly upon the carriage

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,959
and return herto the ignominy
of her captive state."

59
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,959
Ya!

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,799
Whoa!

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,199
My God, Mrs Allen!

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,279
Ohh!

63
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,959
(Clash of steel)

64
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,839
Argh!

65
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,799
Aaaargh!

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,719
(Laughs)

67
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,639
DRIVER: Whoa! Steady there!

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,999
- Come on!
- Not long now.

69
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,319
Come on!

70
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,599
Pulteney Street is not quite
the smartest address,

71
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,199
but, for myself,
I love to be at the centre ofthings.

72
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,599
So do I!

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,279
There's a little peach that's ripe for plucking.

74
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,679
So many people!

75
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,999
I wonder who they can be,
and what their stories are.

76
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,839
Hardly worth knowing, I should say,
ifthey choose to roam the streets

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,839
when they could be sitting at home
by a good fire.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,239
Oh! Mr Allen is so droll.

79
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,119
He always says the opposite ofwhat he means,
for he loves good company.

80
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,559
When shall we go into society, Mrs Allen?

81
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,639
I suppose it is too late this evening?

82
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,919
Bless you, my child,
we neither of us have a stitch to wear.

83
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,159
I did bring my best frock,
and my pink muslin is not too bad, I think.

84
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,359
No, no, no!

85
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,959
Would you have us laughed out of Bath?

86
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,919
Resign yourself, Catherine.

87
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,199
Shops must be visited. Money must be spent.

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,719
Do you think you could bear it?

89
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,199
Very easily, sir.

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,319
- That's it.
- My lady.

91
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,839
And more.

92
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,719
That's the last, madam.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,879
There.

94
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,559
MRS ALLEN:
Did you ever see anything prettier, Mr Allen?

95
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,639
Other than yourself, do you mean, my dear?

96
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,359
Oh, fie, Mr Allen!

97
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,919
- But Catherine...
- Ah, she looks just as she should.

98
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,839
Now...might we make our way, do you think?

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,279
I entertain high hopes of our arriving
at the rooms by midnight.

100
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,799
How he teases us, Catherine.

101
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,959
Midnight, indeed!

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,119
Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, there!

103
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,799
- Stay.
- Good evening, sir.

104
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,799
This way. Mind how you go now, sir.

105
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,079
(Groans)

106
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,599
DOORMAN: This way, ladies.

107
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,439
Heidi! Good to see you!

108
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,599
Sedley!

109
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,599
Sedley! There you are! Is there anyone here?

110
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,039
Not a soul, John! There's no-one here at all!

111
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,919
What could he mean?

112
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,279
If I mightjust... Thank you.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,079
Excuse me.

114
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,839
Card room, I think.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,439
- MrAllen!
- See you later, my love.

116
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,039
Come this way, Catherine.

117
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,079
Oh!

118
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,959
(Sniggers) Pardon me, miss.

119
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,999
Excuse me.

120
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,479
Perhaps we should go through to the tea room.

121
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,759
Mmm.

122
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,719
Quick - there are two places!

123
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,799
(Conversation dies)

124
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,759
(Murmuring)

125
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,839
How uncomfortable it is not to know anybody.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,919
Yes, my dear, very uncomfortable indeed.

127
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,039
But then, you see, one can't speak to people
unless one has been introduced.

128
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,279
- But who will introduce us?
- I'm sure I've no idea.

129
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,799
I don't know. Mother and daughter, I'd guess.

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,879
Had we not better go away?

131
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,879
There are no tea things for us,
and I think we are unwelcome here

132
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,039
Yes, it's most disagreeable.

133
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,759
I wish we had a large acquaintance here.

134
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,799
I wish we had any.

135
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,559
(Laughs)

136
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,759
Mrs Allen.

137
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,599
- Ooh! Have a care, sir!
- A thousand apologies, ma'am.

138
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,839
Catherine, do take this pin out of my sleeve.
It was not your fault, sir.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,879
Allow me, ma'am.

140
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,039
Thank you kindly, sir.

141
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,399
Though I'm afraid it's torn a hole already.

142
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,359
There. Nothing too disastrous, ma'am.

143
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,399
I shall be sorry if it has, for it's a favourite gown.

144
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,759
- Really, Mrs Allen, one would hardly notice.
- Though it cost but nine shillings a yard.

145
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,919
Nine shillings?

146
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,119
- That is exactly what I should have guessed.
- Do you understand muslins, sir?

147
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,679
I understand them very well.

148
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,039
My sister has often entrusted me
in the choice of a gown.

149
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,599
I bought one for her only the other day.

150
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,959
Five shillings a yard, and a true Indian muslin.
What do you make ofthat?

151
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,479
Well!

152
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,199
And I can never get Mr Allen
to tell one of my gowns from another.

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,119
But tell me, sir,
what do you think of Miss Morland's gown?

154
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,119
Miss Morland's gown...

155
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,759
Miss Morland's gown is very pretty.

156
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,799
Though I don't think it will wash well.

157
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,879
I am afraid it will fray.

158
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,359
How can you be so...?

159
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,839
Presumptuous? Indeed.
Without so much as an introduction.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,519
You must allow me to make amends, Mrs Allen.

161
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,519
Gentlemen.

162
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,479
- Thank you.
- Very kind indeed.

163
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,999
One moment.

164
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,119
What a very...

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,559
Really, I shouldn't have allowed you
to speak to him, as a stranger.

166
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,599
But he had such an understanding of muslin.

167
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,519
I wonder where he's gone.

168
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,759
Here he comes again.
And he has brought Mr King with him.

169
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
The Master of Ceremonies himself!

170
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,119
Mrs Allen.

171
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,119
Miss Morland.

172
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,959
Allow me to present to you Mr Henry Tilney,

173
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,999
just lately arrived in Bath.

174
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,359
Mrs Allen, Miss Morland.

175
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,719
Delighted to make your acquaintance.

176
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,119
Mr King.

177
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,399
Now we may talk to one another.

178
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,519
But we've already been talking.

179
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,959
You mustn't allow anyone
to hear you say such things,

180
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,239
or we shall all be expelled from polite society.

181
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,439
Let it be our secret.

182
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,199
And now, if your card is not already full,
Miss Morland,

183
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,479
might I request
the pleasure ofthe next dance with you?

184
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,999
With me?

185
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,919
Thank you.

186
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,119
(Courtly dance)

187
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,319
Forgive me, I have been very remiss
in the proper attentions of a partner.

188
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,719
What are they?

189
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,759
Oh, I ask you how long you have been in Bath,

190
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,439
have you been to the theatre,
and the concert, and so on.

191
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,999
Wouldn't that be rather dull?

192
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,399
Of course.

193
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,199
But we must do our duty. Are you ready?

194
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,319
Yes.

195
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,399
How long have you been in Bath, madam?

196
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,239
Not long at all, sir.

197
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,399
- And were you never here before?
- Never, sir.

198
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,919
Indeed! And have you been to the play?

199
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,639
Not yet, sir.

200
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,199
Astonishing. The concert?

201
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,839
(Laughs) No.

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,439
Amazing. Now tell me...

203
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,879
Are you altogether pleased with Bath, madam?

204
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,319
Yes.

205
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,959
I like it very well.

206
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,199
Excellent.

207
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,719
Now I must give you one smirk,
and then we can be rational again.

208
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,439
(Laughs)

209
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,919
Do you know that gentleman?

210
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,359
Not at all.

211
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,799
I wonder why he keeps looking at us.

212
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,759
I imagine he likes what he sees.

213
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,119
What?

214
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,719
Do you mean me?

215
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,079
Why not?

216
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,119
(Music finishes)

217
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,119
So, tell me,
what will you write in yourjournal tonight?

218
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,159
"Friday, went to the Lower Rooms,

219
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,959
wore my sprigged muslin dress
with blue trimmings,

220
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,919
and looked very pretty, though I say so myself."

221
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,399
- The next dance! Lord Byron's...
- "Danced with one man,

222
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,479
was stared at by another
much more handsome."

223
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,039
Indeed, I shall say no such thing.

224
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,519
Then what shall you say?

225
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,159
Perhaps I don't keep a journal at all.

226
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,759
DRIVER: Come on!

227
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,439
A most agreeable young man.
Was he not, Catherine?

228
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,839
Yes.

229
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,359
He was very kind, and very amusing.

230
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,199
I liked him very much.

231
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,959
Well, Mr Allen?

232
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,599
No, I...

233
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,639
I didn't mean anything like that.

234
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,239
He can't have thought of me like that,
he is much too...

235
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,119
He is quite grown-up.

236
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,599
(Clears throat)
Catherine, I feel I should warn you

237
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,839
that Bath attracts
all manner of scoundrels and adventurers,

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,839
and one cannot be too careful
when making new acquaintances.

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,359
Mr Tilney, a scoundrel?

240
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,039
Mr Tilney, an adventurer?

241
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,839
He understands muslin, Mr Allen.

242
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,119
He has a sister.

243
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,919
Well, upon inquiries,

244
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,879
I did discover that Mr Tilney is a young man
of very good family, and a clergyman to boot.

245
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,959
A clergyman?

246
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,239
No doubt you'd prefer him to be a brigand?

247
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,679
His father's a man of consequence, though.

248
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,119
General Tilney, of Northanger Abbey.

249
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,039
Northanger Abbey?

250
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,679
Is it haunted?

251
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,479
No doubt, no doubt.

252
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,599
These abbeys usually are.

253
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,639
(Horse neighs)

254
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,279
Whoa!

255
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,039
(Thunder rumbles)

256
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,359
..wearing the same old things
that one wouldn't have thought of.

257
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,079
Mrs Allen?

258
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,319
And this must be Miss Morland.

259
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,639
Mrs Thorpe. Your brother James
told me to look out for you.

260
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,359
- You know James?
- Indeed. He is up at Oxford with my son, John.

261
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,919
Mrs Thorpe! My old schoolfellow!

262
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,639
Yes, he went to you at Christmas.

263
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,519
And I may say he endeared himselfto us all.

264
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,039
Ah, here come my girls now.

265
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,159
Isabella, my eldest, and Maria and Anne.

266
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,839
Isabella, this is Mrs Allen,
and Miss Catherine Morland.

267
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,759
James's sister.

268
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,319
James's sister!

269
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,919
How do you do, Miss Morland?

270
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,599
I have so long wished to meet you.

271
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,639
Your brother has spoken of you
so affectionately.

272
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,319
I am sure that we will be the very best offriends.

273
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,359
I am so pleased
you love Mrs Radcliffe's novels, too.

274
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,439
I wish I were you,
just beginning to read Udolpho for the first time.

275
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,839
Is it really very horrid?

276
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,199
You can't even imagine.

277
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,239
But I wouldn't tell you for the world.

278
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,919
Well, perhaps one incident
to whet your appetite.

279
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,959
(Gasps)

280
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,839
Can such things really happen?

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,639
Well, just think of Lord Byron.

282
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,519
I have heard that he is very wicked.

283
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,559
But I don't know exactly
what he is supposed to have done.

284
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,439
Oh!

285
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,319
And I have heard that he is here, in Bath.

286
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,079
Shall we go to the Pump Room
and see ifwe can see him?

287
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,359
Perhaps your Mr Tilney will be there, too.

288
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,799
He's not my Mr Tilney, Isabella.

289
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,039
Indeed, you mustn't say he is!

290
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,839
Isn't he?

291
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,039
Well, there's a certain person
who will be very glad to hear that.

292
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,039
Who do you mean?

293
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,799
Never you mind.

294
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,679
(Whispering)

295
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,199
ISABELLA: Oh.

296
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,559
I do so hate it when strangers listen
to one's private conversations.

297
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,439
No, his name's not there.

298
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,079
I think he must be gone from Bath.

299
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,879
And yet he never mentioned
his stay would be so short.

300
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,239
Perhaps it's just as well.

301
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,319
My brother John says
the whole family is very bad.

302
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,639
The eldest son as bad as Lord Byron,
John says.

303
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,839
Surely he's mistaken. Mr Tilney couldn't have
been kinder or more gentleman-like.

304
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,799
Appearances often deceive, you know.

305
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,599
But he is a clergyman.

306
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,159
That signifies nothing these days.

307
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,959
(Men laugh)

308
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,759
Insufferable!

309
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,959
Come, let's walk outside.

310
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,719
Nice. Both girls.

311
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,639
STREET-SELLER: Nosegays! Buttonholes!

312
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,919
Posies! Buttonholes!

313
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,679
Are they following?

314
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,119
No, they are going towards the churchyard.

315
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,399
Good. We are rid ofthem.

316
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,519
Now, ifwe turn down there,
it will bring us to Milsom Street.

317
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,359
But shouldn't we come upon them again
ifwe did that?

318
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,639
Oh, never mind that. Come, make haste.

319
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,399
Posies!

320
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,239
(Drivers gee on horses)

321
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,279
Oh, these odious carriages! How I detest them!

322
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,839
Make way! Make way!

323
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,879
- Isabella!
- Oh, how delightful!

324
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,959
Mr Morland and my brother John!

325
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,039
James!

326
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,119
I didn't know you were coming to Bath.

327
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,599
Thorpe's idea.

328
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,959
When I remembered you were here, and you,
Miss Thorpe, nothing would have kept me away.

329
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,199
I am very happy to see you again.

330
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,839
And I, you.

331
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,479
- Miss Morland.
- My good friend John Thorpe.

332
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,839
Enchanté.

333
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,079
I had the pleasure
of seeing you dance the other evening.

334
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,119
Yes, I remember.

335
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,759
I hope I may have the pleasure
of dancing with you myself before too long.

336
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,559
- We were walking towards Edgar's Buildings.
- Were you?

337
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,919
Damn it, we'll walk with you! Miss Morland?

338
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,839
- Are you fond of an open carriage?
- Oh, yes, very.

339
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,879
Well, would you permit me to drive you
up Lansdown Hill one day this week?

340
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,919
Thank you. You are very kind.

341
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,759
But...would it be proper?

342
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,679
Damn it, this is Bath.

343
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,239
You know?
Everything's more free and easy in Bath.

344
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,879
(Courtly dance)

345
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,839
Penny for your thoughts, Miss Morland?

346
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,359
I was just...
Have you ever read Udolpho, Mr Thorpe?

347
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,239
Udolpho? Lord!

348
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,999
No, I never read novels.
I leave all that to Isabella.

349
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,919
- I read The Monk the other day, though.
- The Monk!

350
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,519
Is it as shocking as everybody says?

351
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,199
You can borrow it, if you care to.

352
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,359
Hot stuff, you know.

353
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,079
(Music finishes)

354
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,919
(Murmur of conversation)

355
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,839
- Isn't this altogether delightful, Catherine?
- Yes!

356
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,959
What say? Jig it again?

357
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,879
MASTER OF CEREMONIES:
Take your partners for the next dance!

358
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,959
A Prodigal Fellow!

359
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,239
Miss Morland.

360
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,399
Allow me to introduce...

361
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,919
Eleanor.

362
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,319
My sister.

363
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,479
Your sister!

364
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,479
Oh...

365
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,279
Yes, I am very happy to meet you, Miss Tilney.

366
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,039
And I, you.

367
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,999
Henry has told me so much about you.

368
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,039
You can't imagine how surprised I was
to see your brother again.

369
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,599
I felt so sure of his being quite gone from Bath.

370
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,639
Yes, when he saw you, he was here to engage
lodgings for us. He only stayed the one night.

371
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,439
Oh, I see.

372
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,559
He, your brother, dances very well.

373
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,919
- Yes.
- And he is very amusing.

374
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,599
Yes, he is, when he cares to be.

375
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,679
Do you know that gentleman
talking to Mr Tilney?

376
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,959
That's our father, General Tilney.

377
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,919
He looks as if he were displeased with us.

378
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,839
It is only his way.

379
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,119
And is your mother here with you
in Bath as well?

380
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,119
Our mother is dead.

381
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,919
So this is your first time in Bath?

382
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,639
Do you like it?

383
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,399
Very much indeed.

384
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,799
There are some very pretty walks round about.

385
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,719
Henry and I walk most mornings.

386
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,479
Should you care to join us one day?

387
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,079
Yes.

388
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,039
More than anything in the world.
I love long walks.

389
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,999
Though I can't persuade my friend to join me.

390
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,639
She thinks it a waste oftime when there are
so many other things to do in town.

391
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,839
- I can see that she might.
- (Laughs)

392
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,199
She does the most appalling things.

393
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,119
In that case, shall we say tomorrow at 12,
unless it rains?

394
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,479
Yes.

395
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,799
Catherine. You simply must hear this.

396
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,479
Come, quickly!

397
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,799
Excuse me.

398
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,639
Of course.

399
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,799
Make haste, Miss Morland!
Put on your hat, there's no time to lose!

400
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,879
- We are going to Blaize Castle!
- Mr Thorpe!

401
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,519
- How do you do, Mrs Allen?
ISABELLA: My sweetest Catherine.

402
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,519
Isn't this delightful?
Blaize Castle, nothing could be more romantic.

403
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,879
Yes, I'm sure, but I am very sorry,
I can't come with you.

404
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,759
I am expecting Miss Tilney and her brother
to call on me to take a country walk.

405
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:54,199
Not they! I saw them five minutes ago. Doesn't
he drive a phaeton with a pair of chestnuts?

406
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,959
I don't know, indeed.

407
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,799
I saw him large as life, on the Lansdown Road,
with a smart-looking girl by his side.

408
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,519
But perhaps they mean to call later.

409
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,879
No, they don't.

410
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,159
I heard Tilney hallooing to a man
they were going as far as Wick Rocks.

411
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,399
I don't understand it at all.

412
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,479
Miss Tilney promised.

413
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,799
In this false world, people often make promises
they have little intention of keeping.

414
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,879
Remember, we are your true friends.

415
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,839
- We keep our promises.
- Yes.

416
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,719
But what ifthey should come after all?

417
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,119
My dear scatter-brained sister, haven't you just
heard him say they're halfway to Wick Rocks?

418
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,799
Then...

419
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,519
perhaps I should come with you.

420
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,359
Please, Miss Morland.

421
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,959
Goes very nice, doesn't she? Smooth as silk!

422
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,639
How do you do, sir?

423
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,559
Scoundrel!

424
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,999
(Laughs)

425
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,839
Pleasant old gentleman.

426
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,879
Mr Allen? Yes, and so good natured.

427
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,599
- And rich as Croesus, or so I hear.
- I believe Mr Allen is very rich.

428
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,479
- And no children at all?
- No, none.

429
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,799
- But you're quite a favourite, though, I gather?
- Mr and Mrs Allen are very kind to me, yes.

430
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,119
- Ever since I was a baby.
- Excellent. Excellent!

431
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,679
Oh, Miss Tilney!

432
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,879
Stop! Stop now! It's Miss Tilney and her brother!

433
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,239
- There'll be hell to pay if I tried to stop him now!
- Please stop, Mr Thorpe!

434
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,559
- I'll get down! I will!
- It's not possible!

435
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,839
Oh!

436
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,959
Whoa, there!

437
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,519
How could you deceive me so?

438
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,559
Well, what if I did? Where would you rather be?
In a spanking gig driving to Blaize Castle

439
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,559
or trailing about in the dirt
with some canting prig of a parson?

440
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,839
Mr Tilney is not a canting prig!

441
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,559
You have made it seem
as if I had broken my promise to them.

442
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,999
Whoa, there. Look here!

443
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,439
Miss Morland...

444
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,159
I might not have been completely straight
with you, but I had good reason.

445
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,879
You think of your brother's happiness,
and Isabella's.

446
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,759
They couldn't go off unchaperoned.

447
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,879
And I was thinking of you, too.

448
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,799
I'm not altogether happy
to see you with the Tilneys.

449
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,919
The whole family has a terrible reputation.

450
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,559
Something very strange
about the mother's death.

451
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,999
But you can't mean...?

452
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,359
We must be careful making new acquaintances.
We're not all as honest as you and I, eh?

453
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,279
But Mr Tilney and his sister
have been so kind to me.

454
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,559
Truly sorry, Miss Morland,
if I have caused you any distress.

455
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,519
But you can set it all right tomorrow.

456
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,079
Let's at least try and enjoy ourselves today.

457
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,639
Damn it, I've been looking forwward to driving you
out more than anything. What do you say?

458
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,959
- Very well.
- Whoa!

459
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,119
- Everything all right, Thorpe?
- Absolutely.

460
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,519
Walk on.

461
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,919
(Sheepdogs bark)

462
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,919
- Go on!
- Walk on.

463
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,959
- I say, sir, can you move your sheep, please?
- Oh, go on!

464
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,279
SHEPHERD: Hi, hi, hi!

465
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,199
It's just a spot of rain, it will clear up in no time.

466
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,519
We'd better go back. Your sister thinks so, too.
We're not halfway to Blaize Castle.

467
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,399
Very well, as you wish! It's all one to me!

468
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,439
If your brother hadn't such a damned beast to
drive, we'd have been there this half hour gone.

469
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,959
Will you move your sheep? I need to turn.

470
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,839
I'll take my bloody time!

471
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,839
Come on, girl!

472
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,039
(Patter of rain outside)

473
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,119
(Sighs)

474
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,639
Lord! What would the men think
ifthey could see us now?

475
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,519
How can I ever face the Tilneys again?

476
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,919
You mustn't be cross with John, dearest one.

477
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,319
Do you know, he told me he liked you better
than any girl he had ever seen.

478
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,679
And he thinks you're the prettiest girl in Bath.

479
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,759
- I don't know why he should think that.
- No need for false modesty!

480
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,039
Now, how far have you got on with Udolpho?

481
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,959
- I've just got to the black veil.
- The black veil!

482
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,279
I won't tell you what's behind it, not for the world.

483
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,959
When you have finished it,
you will read The Monk, my brother's favourite.

484
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,839
Oh, yes, he spoke of it. Is it really very horrid?

485
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,959
It is the most horrid, shocking thing
in all the world.

486
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,559
Ambrosio the Monk begins very holy,
but is drawn into vice by Matilda.

487
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,359
She gives him a magic branch
so he can pass through walls...

488
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,159
(Whispers) ..and into Antonia's bed chamber.

489
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,279
(Gasps)

490
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,119
But it is too shocking. I should blush to tell you.
You must read it yourself.

491
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,079
(Thunder rumbles)

492
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,999
(Reads) "The Friar pronounced the magic words
and a thick smoke arose overthe magic mirror.

493
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,799
At length, he beheld Antonia's lovely form.

494
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,799
She was undressing to bathe herself

495
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,559
and the amorous monk
had full opportunityto observe

496
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,799
the voluptuous contours
and admirable symmetry of her person

497
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,639
as she drew off her last garment.

498
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,159
At this moment, a tame linnet flew towards her,

499
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,879
nestled its head between her breasts
and nibbled them in wanton play.

500
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,639
Ambrosio could bear no more.

501
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,799
The blood boiled in his veins
and a raging fire rushed through his limbs.

502
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,079
'I must possess her!' he cried."

503
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,679
No, no, Ambrosio.

504
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,679
I shall no longer be able to combat my passions.

505
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,199
I am convinced with every moment,
that I have but one alternative...

506
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,799
I must enjoy you, or die!

507
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,839
♪ MOZART: Der Hölle Rache
from The Magic Flute

508
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,359
(Whispers)

509
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,079
Damn fine-looking woman.

510
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,079
But she's nothing to you, you know.

511
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,079
(Applause)

512
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,319
Miss Morland, Mrs Allen, Mr Allen.

513
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,679
Mr Tilney, you must have thought me so rude,
but they told me you had gone out.

514
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,879
When I saw you, I begged Mr Thorpe to stop,
but he only went faster.

515
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,959
If only he had slowed down,
I would have jumped out and run back to you.

516
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,359
Please believe me, I would ten thousand times
rather have been with you!

517
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,399
Are you and Miss Tilney very angry with me?

518
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,439
I must confess, I felt a little slighted.

519
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,279
But my sister was quite sure
there was some misunderstanding.

520
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,279
Eleanor, you were right, as usual.

521
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,319
Miss Morland is not to blame.
She was abducted by force!

522
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,159
No, not exactly,
but truly I did try to make him stop.

523
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,919
Don't tease her. You were cast down when you
thought she preferred the company of others.

524
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,879
Perhaps she still does.

525
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,279
No, indeed!

526
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,999
That is...

527
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,919
Then may I renew our invitation?

528
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,279
Shall we say the day after tomorrow
for our walk?

529
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,199
Yes.

530
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,199
THORPE: Miss Catherine Morland,
a very amiable girl, very rich, too.

531
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,159
Ward of a Mr Allen, who made a fortune in trade.

532
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,399
And with no-one to spend it on but her,

533
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,599
she'll bring a deal of money to her marriage.

534
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,439
When the old man pops off, she'll be one
ofthe richest women in the country.

535
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,199
Obliged to you, sir.

536
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,399
Thorpe, John Thorpe.

537
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,519
Delighted to have been...

538
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,279
Yes, it was beautifully sung.

539
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,639
Mr Thorpe, perhaps you'd introduce me
to the young lady.

540
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,679
Miss Morland, this is General Tilney.

541
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,719
Charming.

542
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,759
And did I overhear a country walk proposed?

543
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,199
Yes, sir, the day after tomorrow.

544
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,639
Perhaps you would do us the honour
of spending the rest ofthe day with us,

545
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,959
after your walk?

546
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,319
If Mr and Mrs Allen can be persuaded
to spare you?

547
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,159
I'm sure they'd be happy to spare me, sir,
and I'd have great pleasure in coming.

548
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,119
Excellent.

549
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,039
I shall look forwward to making
your better acquaintance, Miss Morland.

550
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,599
Ooh!

551
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,039
ELEANOR: What do you think, Catherine?
- It's wonderful.

552
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,239
It reminds me ofthe South of France.
The Languedoc, you know?

553
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,039
ELEANOR: Yes!

554
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,639
Have you travelled much in France?

555
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,039
No.

556
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,879
Not at all, I've never been there.

557
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,639
But I've seen pictures. And it's just
as Mrs Radcliffe describes it in Udolpho.

558
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,199
Ah! Mrs Radcliffe.

559
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,439
CATHERINE: But I suppose
you don't read novels?

560
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,959
HENRY: I read Udolpho straight through
in two days,

561
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,639
with my hair standing up on end the whole time.

562
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,959
I often think there's more life,

563
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,559
and truth,

564
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,399
and feeling in a good novel
than in a hundred dull sermons.

565
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,039
Do you really believe that?

566
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,879
Oh, go on, don't wait for me.

567
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,119
Why should you think I don't believe it?

568
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,039
Because I think you like to tease me.

569
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,839
And because the real world is different
from the world in stories.

570
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,079
Is it?

571
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,799
Of course it is!

572
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,359
I love to read Mrs Radcliffe,

573
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,239
but I don't think the real world's
full of murders and abductions

574
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,799
and ghosts with clanking chains

575
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,999
and seductions and everything.

576
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,719
Well, not in Fullerton, anyway.

577
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,959
Perhaps not quite so many murders
and abductions.

578
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,919
But broken hearts? Betrayals?

579
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,199
Long-held grudges? Schemes of revenge?

580
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,359
Fear?

581
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,959
And hatred? And despair?

582
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,359
Are they not part of all of our lives?
Even in Fullerton?

583
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,639
I don't know.

584
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,679
I would like to think not.

585
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,959
Well, then, I hope your experience of life
is the exception that proves the rule.

586
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,319
Tilney!

587
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,639
Forgive me, Tilney, for interrupting your walk.
I've no time to lose.

588
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,959
Of course. You were expected.

589
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,799
Ma'am.

590
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,759
Come, let's walk on a little.

591
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,559
That gentleman is a close acquaintance of ours,
a very good friend.

592
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,559
He is obliged to leave the country
at short notice.

593
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,359
He was able to make his farewells to me
last evening,

594
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,679
but was no doubt anxious
to say goodbye to my sister, too, before he left.

595
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,359
I see.

596
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,439
There is no reason
why the matter should come up.

597
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,839
But my sister and I would be very grateful
if you did not mention to my father

598
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,039
that we saw that gentleman here today.

599
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,319
No, of course.

600
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,959
Thank you.

601
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,599
CATHERINE:
The Monk reeled from the unholy sight.

602
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,039
"Receive this talisman," she replied.

603
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,879
"While you bearthis, every doorwill fly open
and walls will melt away.

604
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,679
It will procure you access tomorrow night
to Antonia's bed chamber.""

605
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,199
Miss Morland.

606
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,279
Nothing to be ashamed of.

607
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,639
It's all God's creation.

608
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,479
Come.

609
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,519
Catherine!

610
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,919
MRS ALLEN: Catherine!

611
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,039
I absolutely knew
the second you came to the house. I could tell.

612
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,719
And the way you spoke to my mother,
I could just... It was almost like fate.

613
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,999
(Knock on door)

614
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,279
Catherine?

615
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,279
No, no, sit down.

616
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,079
Can you guess?

617
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,279
Your brother has made me
the happiest girl on Earth!

618
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,599
You mean, you and James...

619
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,799
Are in love!

620
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,279
He confessed as much to me this afternoon.

621
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,599
And you know my nature,
I could never trifle with a man's affections.

622
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,559
In short, I told him his love was returned.

623
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,039
(Laughs delightedly)

624
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,559
Catherine!

625
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,079
He's waiting downstairs.

626
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,399
I know I needn't ask
whether you approve, Catherine.

627
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,839
No, indeed!

628
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,399
Though I am surprised.
It has all happened so quickly.

629
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,039
Not so. I believe I have been in love with
your friend since the first time I set eyes on her.

630
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,639
And I.

631
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,439
The very first day he came to us last Christmas,
the very first moment!

632
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,559
I remember I wore this yellow gown.

633
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,799
- My hair was up in braids.
- I am come to say goodbye, Catherine.

634
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,079
I am going straight to Fullerton
to seek our parents' consent.

635
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,839
Ah, Morland, there you are.

636
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,279
Miss Morland,

637
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,439
I, too, must take my leave for the present,
just for the present.

638
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,679
I'm going to accompany James to Fullerton,
and then onto town to help him choose a ring.

639
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,079
Perhaps I might look for one for myself
while I'm there. Do you think I should?

640
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,879
A famous good thing, this marrying scheme.
What do you think of it?

641
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,959
I think it's a very good thing, too.

642
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,119
I'm so pleased to hear you say that.

643
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,959
Did you ever hear the old song,
"going to one wedding brings on another"?

644
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,279
Perhaps you and I might try the truth ofthat?

645
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,199
I shall think of you, when I'm in town!

646
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,679
Come on, James, we must tear ourselves away!

647
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,879
Go.

648
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,479
Go, perhaps, forever.

649
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,119
Isabella! Whatever do you mean?

650
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,239
Your mother and father, what will they say?

651
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,119
I'm sure they'll be very happy for James.

652
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,279
But my fortune will be so small.
How could they consent to it?

653
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,559
Your brother, who might marry anybody.

654
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,079
I wouldn't think the difference in fortune
would be anything to signify.

655
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,639
Oh! My sweetest Catherine, in your generous
heart, I'm sure it would not matter at all.

656
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,959
But I mustn't expect everyone to think the same.

657
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,119
I only wish our situations were reversed.

658
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,959
If I had the command of millions,

659
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,639
if I were mistress ofthe whole world...

660
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,199
..your brother would still be my only choice.

661
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,199
Now, Catherine,
you know I'm only here for your sake.

662
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,359
You know my heart is forty miles away.

663
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,279
And as for dancing, don't mention it, I beg you.

664
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,079
It is quite out ofthe question.

665
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,279
I dare say Charles Hodge will plague me
to death about it.

666
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,399
But I shall cut him very short, I can tell you.

667
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,359
I wonder where he is.

668
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,799
- It's General Tilney.
- I do believe he's coming to talk to you.

669
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,079
Miss Morland.

670
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,879
Delightful.

671
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,999
You will excuse me now.

672
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,919
Excellent.

673
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,079
Miss Morland, allow me to introduce my brother,
Captain Tilney.

674
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,199
Charmed.

675
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,559
Don't let my brother's ill manners offend you.
That's how he is, I'm afraid.

676
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,959
He was ill-mannered as a baby.

677
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,679
I'm surprised at you being so disrespectful
to your older brother.

678
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,959
How could you know
what he was like as a baby?

679
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,239
When he was a baby, you were not yet born.

680
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,079
True enough.

681
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,959
My mother told me of it.

682
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,719
I hope you're not already engaged
for the next dance?

683
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,799
No, indeed.

684
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,999
- My rival having left Bath.
- Indeed he is not...

685
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,239
You mustn't tease me.

686
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,159
So do you not know Mr Thorpe at all?

687
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,959
No, not at all.

688
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,999
That's strange. He seems to know
a great deal about your family.

689
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,599
And none of it to our credit?

690
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,919
Well, I have always found

691
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,239
that ignorance and prejudice hold no bar
to forming the strongest of opinions.

692
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,959
You think him ignorant and prejudiced?

693
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,319
I know he doesn't always tell the truth,
but he has been very kind to me.

694
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,319
You think he isn't to be trusted?

695
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,519
Dear Miss Morland,

696
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,199
has it not occurred to you
that I might not be the best person

697
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,279
to consult on the matter of Mr Thorpe?

698
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,839
MASTER OF CEREMONIES:
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

699
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,599
the next dance will be On A Summer's Day.

700
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,879
Good God, Henry. You're not going
to stand up in that maul, are you?

701
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,279
I certainly am.

702
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,599
That being so...

703
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,959
..do you think your friend might dance with me?

704
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,159
No! I am sorry. I know for certain that she has
a very particular reason not to dance tonight.

705
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,039
Is that so?

706
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,039
Pity.

707
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,119
(Music starts)

708
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,839
- Why are you smiling?
- Look there.

709
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,199
I don't wonder at your surprise.

710
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,119
I refused him for as long as I possibly could,
but he would not take no for an answer.

711
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,799
He's the eldest son, you know,
the heir to Northanger Abbey.

712
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,399
Not that that weighs anything with me.

713
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,079
I am in love with the best man
in the whole world.

714
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,279
Did you think him handsome?

715
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,079
- Who?
- Captain Tilney, silly!

716
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,599
Oh.

717
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,039
Yes, very handsome.

718
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,719
(Snores)

719
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,759
But didn't your brother say he was very bad?

720
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,079
As bad as Lord Byron?

721
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,079
Oh, John will say anything
that comes into his head.

722
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,959
I hardly ever take any notice of him!

723
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,999
But then, how is one to know what to believe?

724
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,679
One thing you can be certain of - my affection.

725
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,039
For you and your dear, dear brother.

726
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,759
(Thunder crashes)

727
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,999
Catherine! Catherine, help me, for God's sake!

728
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,879
(Town crier's bell)

729
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,279
You have heard from James?

730
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,959
And my parents have consented?

731
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,599
Yes, your father has been very good.

732
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,839
James is to have a living worth £400 a year

733
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,839
as soon as he is old enough to take it.

734
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,199
But that won't be for another two years,
so we must wait that long before we marry.

735
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,439
It seems it wasn't possible for your father
to do anything for us immediately.

736
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,559
I'm sure Mr Morland has behaved
vastly handsome.

737
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,039
If he finds he can do more, by and by,
I dare say he will.

738
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,959
And Isabella's wishes are so moderate.

739
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,559
ISABELLA: For myself, it's nothing.

740
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,399
I never think of myself.

741
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,359
But poor James!

742
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,999
£400 a year is hardly enough
for the common necessaries of life!

743
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,439
But I suppose everybody has the right
to do what they like with their own money.

744
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,759
I am very sure that my father has promised
as much as he can afford.

745
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,799
But Mr Allen, I was sure,
would do something for James.

746
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,759
Perhaps he does not approve
of his choice of bride.

747
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,439
Why should Mr Allen do anything for James?

748
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,439
Or for any of us?

749
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,039
It was very kind of Mr and Mrs Allen
to bring me to Bath,

750
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,039
but none of us has any expectations
from Mr Allen.

751
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,399
My dear, sweet Catherine,

752
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,839
you know I care nothing for money.

753
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,319
Ifwe could only be married tomorrow,
I would be happy to live on £50 a year.

754
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,839
But that's the sting.

755
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,439
That's why you find me so cast down.

756
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,959
The two years we must wait
before dear Morland can have the living!

757
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,759
Catherine...

758
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,039
How will I endure it?

759
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,879
I can well understand how she feels.

760
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,039
Two years is a long time.

761
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,119
But at least she can marry the man she loves.
Not everyone is so fortunate.

762
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,279
No, I suppose not.

763
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,759
How sad that is.

764
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,719
Yes, it is.

765
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,079
But how many couples marry for love?

766
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,279
I believe my mother and father love each other
even more than they love us,

767
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,119
and they love us very much.

768
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,519
When I was a little girl,
I used to think it was like that for everyone.

769
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,639
It was only when I started to read novels
that I realised it was not.

770
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,799
I shouldn't have thought
one would have to read novels to find that out.

771
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,879
I think you have had
quite a dangerous upbringing.

772
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,879
- Dangerous? How?
- Well, it's as Henry says.

773
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,959
You've been brought up to believe
that everyone is as pure in heart as you are.

774
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,799
I don't think I'm very pure in heart.

775
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,479
Really? Why?

776
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,959
I have the most terrible dreams sometimes.

777
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,599
(Both giggle)
- What's the joke?

778
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,159
Nothing to concern you.

779
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,159
I love our walks.

780
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,919
I think I should like to stay in Bath forever
and go walking with you every day!

781
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,119
Unfortunately, that won't be possible.

782
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,239
Oh?

783
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,719
Our father told us this morning he's determined
on quitting Bath by the end ofthe week.

784
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,759
Oh.

785
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,279
GENERAL TILNEY: Miss Morland!

786
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,959
Capital!

787
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,519
Excellent.

788
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,079
Can you, Miss Morland, be prevailed on

789
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,039
to quit this scene of public triumph

790
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,839
and oblige us with your company
at Northanger Abbey?

791
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,999
Northanger Abbey?

792
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,519
Well, Miss Morland...

793
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,039
..what do you say?

794
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,399
I am very honoured, sir.

795
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,839
If Mr and Mrs Allen agree,

796
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,959
I should be delighted to accept.

797
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,959
Northanger Abbey?

798
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,039
Aren't you frightened to go there on your own?

799
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,079
I confess I am, a little.

800
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,919
Well, I dare say, it will be very thrilling for you.

801
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,959
But I do hope you don't forget me, Catherine.

802
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,359
Or our dearest John.

803
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,839
No, indeed.

804
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,959
No need to be coy.

805
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:18,079
I heard from him today
that you and he are as good as engaged.

806
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,639
Indeed we are not!

807
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,279
Useless to dissemble, my dear.
Your secret's out.

808
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,799
He says in his letter, not half an hour before he
left Bath, you gave him positive encouragement.

809
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,839
He says he as good as made you an offer.

810
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,719
No!

811
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,559
No, there must be some mistake.

812
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,199
Your brother must have
misunderstood me, and...

813
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,319
I certainly had no idea
he thought he was making me an offer.

814
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,199
Please, undeceive him, and beg his pardon.

815
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,959
Oh.

816
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,159
Well, I dare say we should all be allowed
a little harmless flirtation.

817
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,839
But there was no flirtation, not on my side.

818
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,039
And if no-one were allowed
to change their minds, where would we all be?

819
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,399
Perhaps it's for the best, after all.

820
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,799
Isabella,
please understand me, once and for all...

821
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,279
Sh! Here he comes!

822
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,959
- Who?
- Tilney, of course!

823
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,559
Oh, I wouldn't have this happen for the world.

824
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,639
Look away, perhaps he's not seen us.

825
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,599
What, always to be watched?

826
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,639
In person or...

827
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,759
..by proxy?

828
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,239
Nonsense.

829
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,079
My spirit, you know, is pretty independent.

830
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,999
I wish your heart were independent.
That would be enough for me.

831
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,799
My heart?

832
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,999
What can you have to do with hearts?

833
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,039
None of you men have hearts.

834
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,079
But we have eyes.

835
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,999
And they give us torment enough.

836
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,399
I think Mrs Allen and your mother
are expecting us.

837
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,919
Will you come, Isabella?

838
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,879
You go.

839
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,919
And tell them I'll follow.

840
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,639
And if I shouldn't see you, write and tell me
all your news from Northanger.

841
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,959
Do take a care, sir!

842
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,079
Whoa, there!

843
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,839
Whoa!

844
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,399
Come along now. Four minutes late already
coming from Milsom Street.

845
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,079
I'm sure Miss Morland
won't keep you waiting, Father.

846
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,679
Oh, Catherine, my dear, quickly, they are here!

847
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,999
How grand!

848
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,919
A chaise and four!
You never aspired to that, Mr Allen!

849
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,799
No, indeed.

850
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,559
Well, Catherine, we shall miss you.

851
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,839
Thank you for all your kindness.

852
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,919
It has been such a happy time.

853
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,919
There, there, my dear.

854
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,759
I should be sharp about it.

855
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,799
These great folks don't like to be kept waiting.

856
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,079
Miss Morland,
a thousand pardons for our late arrival.

857
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,679
My eldest son must bear the blame.
He stays on in Bath.

858
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,159
Now, my dear Miss Morland, I have a proposal.

859
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,799
As it is a fine day,

860
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,879
how should you like to travel in the curricle
with my son, Henry?

861
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,239
You will enjoy the air
and be better able to see the country.

862
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,359
It is, of course, entirely up to you.

863
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,879
I should like that very much.

864
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,279
Did your father say
that Captain Tilney stays on in Bath?

865
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,639
- Yes.
- Oh.

866
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,759
You're disappointed? You were hoping for
my brother's company at Northanger, perhaps?

867
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,799
No!

868
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,439
No, not at all!

869
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,159
That is, I should have
no objection to his company...

870
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,039
Then what is it? Come.

871
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,719
I am anxious
about your brother and Miss Thorpe.

872
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,279
I think he cannot know
that she is engaged to my brother.

873
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,039
I suppose he thinks he has a chance with her.

874
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,479
But doesn't he realise how wrong it is of him
and what pain it must give to my brother?

875
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,959
I don't think you should distress yourself
too much, Miss Morland.

876
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,759
Your brother shall be returning to Bath
very soon.

877
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,279
And my brother should be leaving
to rejoin his regiment.

878
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,839
And that will be the end ofthat.

879
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,839
Now, look there.

880
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,639
It's exactly as I imagined.

881
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,959
It's just like what one reads about.

882
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:02,199
Are you prepared to encounter all of its horrors?

883
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,719
Horrors?

884
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,839
Is Northanger haunted, then?

885
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,279
Oh, that's just the least of it.

886
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,519
Dungeons and sliding panels,

887
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:16,879
skeletons, strange unearthly cries in the night
that pierce your very soul.

888
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,439
And vampires?

889
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,359
Don't say vampires!

890
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,519
I could bear anything, but not vampires.

891
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,839
Miss Morland,
I do believe you're teasing me now.

892
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,119
But if I were to say there is a kind of vampirism...

893
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:41,079
No, let's just say that all houses have
their secrets, and Northanger is no exception.

894
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,519
- Let me help you down.
- Thank you.

895
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,879
Miss Morland, welcome to Northanger Abbey.

896
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,639
I hope you will be comfortable.

897
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:28,719
Do, please, I beg you, make as little alteration
to your dress as possible.

898
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,399
My father is most particular about meal times.

899
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,919
I'm sorry to have to ask you.

900
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:35,999
No...

901
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,679
No, that's quite all right.

902
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,839
I'll see you in a few minutes, then.

903
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,999
(Doors creak and groan)

904
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,919
If you please,

905
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,839
Miss Tilney says, do you need any help, miss?

906
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,319
Oh, no.

907
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,999
No, thank you.

908
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,759
Are you ready?

909
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,719
So sorry.

910
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,199
Miss Morland. Charming.

911
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,599
Dinner should be on the table directly!

912
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,359
(General clears throat)

913
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,359
GENERAL TILNEY: I hope you find our simple
style of living to your taste, Miss Morland.

914
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,839
No doubt you have been used
to better-sized apartments at Mr Allen's?

915
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,999
No, indeed, sir.

916
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,799
MrAllen's dining parlour
is only halfthe size ofthis room.

917
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,799
Well now, I suppose
I care as little as any man for such things,

918
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,799
but a tolerably-large eating room
is one ofthe necessaries of life.

919
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,119
Hm?

920
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,359
Tolerably large, indeed, sir.

921
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,279
But I don't think I've ever been
in so large a dining room as this one.

922
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,199
You have not?

923
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,079
Well, no doubt the rooms in Mr Allen's are...

924
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,319
exactly the true size...

925
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,919
..for rational happiness.

926
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,479
(Rumble ofthunder)

927
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,439
(Thunder crashes)

928
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,919
(Creaking)

929
01:01:45,080 --> 01:02:03,279
(Thunderclap)

930
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,719
Oh!

931
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,879
Oh, why...

932
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,999
What... Whatever are these old things?

933
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,879
No!

934
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,679
No, leave them, please.

935
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,039
Shirts,

936
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,639
stockings,

937
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,679
cravats.

938
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,959
Laundry lists.

939
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,679
This was my mother's favourite place.

940
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,679
I used to walk so often here with her.

941
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,839
Though I never loved it then
as I have loved it since.

942
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,159
Her death must have been a great affliction.

943
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,319
A great and increasing one.

944
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,359
What was she like? Did she look like you?

945
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,239
I wish I could show you her portrait.

946
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,639
It hangs in her private chamber.

947
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,759
I suppose you were with her to the last?

948
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,799
No.

949
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,039
I was away from home when she died.

950
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,959
Her illness was sudden and short,
and before I arrived, it was all over.

951
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,279
So you didn't see her body?

952
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,599
No.

953
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,599
I wish I could have done.

954
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,879
Perhaps it would help me
to think of her at peace.

955
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,839
Yes.

956
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,319
I should like to see her room,
if you are willing to show me.

957
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,079
We never go there. It is my father's wish.

958
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,239
But to see her picture?

959
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,959
Yes.

960
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,959
Why should you not see it?

961
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,839
What do you do there?

962
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,919
I was going to show Miss Morland Mother's...

963
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,039
There is nothing to interest Miss Morland
in this part ofthe house.

964
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,479
I am surprised at you, Eleanor.

965
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,159
CATHERINE: Mydearest Isabella,

966
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,719
I long to hear your news.

967
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,719
I hope everything is well with you and James

968
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,199
and that your brother
is nottoo much offended with me.

969
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:06,879
Northanger Abbey is all that I expected it to be,
and Eleanor and her brothervery kind.

970
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,759
Oh, Isabella, I fearthat this house
holds a terrible secret

971
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,599
relating to the death of Mrs Tilney.

972
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,759
ELEANOR: Catherine?

973
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,199
Here I am!

974
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,519
I cannot write more now.

975
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,799
Send me your news,
your loving friend, Catherine.

976
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,559
This is a sad day, Miss Morland.

977
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,799
A sad day for me, that is.

978
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,279
I have to go up to town for several days
on business.

979
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,599
I trust you'll be able to entertain our guest
properly while I am gone?

980
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,759
Nothing would give me greater pleasure, sir.

981
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,919
Come along!

982
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,719
(Laughs)

983
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,879
What are you giggling about?

984
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,679
One for me, Henry!

985
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,999
This is the last one.

986
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,559
(Laughter)

987
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,399
Ooh! Ah!

988
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,559
I thought I might show you Woodston tomorrow,
if you'd like to.

989
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,799
It's nothing to Northanger, of course,
just a country vicarage.

990
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,959
But I'm very fond of it.

991
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,279
I'd love to.

992
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:09,919
Look.

993
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,159
Is that your home?

994
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,799
- It's lovely.
- I'm very glad you think so.

995
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,959
(Thunder rumbles)

996
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,479
I fear we may be about to get a little damp.

997
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,439
Come on, I'll race you back.

998
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,039
Come on! Come on!

999
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,919
(Door opens)

1000
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,919
Look at the state ofthe pair of you!

1001
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,399
I'll go and get Richards to draw your bath,
Catherine.

1002
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,559
When we were coming to Northanger Abbey,
you said that the house held secrets.

1003
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,959
Did I? And have you discovered
any dreadful revelations yet?

1004
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,839
No, but I'd like to know what you meant.

1005
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,959
I think that shall have to remain a secret.

1006
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:51,119
A secret once explained loses all of its charms,
and all of its danger, too.

1007
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:56,879
Why don't you imagine the worst thing you can,
and write your own Gothic romance about it?

1008
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,479
"Northanger Abbey" would make
a very good title, don't you think?

1009
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,879
Now you're mocking me.

1010
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,679
But I can't help feeling
that this house is not a happy one.

1011
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,359
Not since our mother died.

1012
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,879
And even before then.

1013
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,119
I envy you your happy childhood.

1014
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,559
My brother Frederick is well enough, I think,
sowing his wild oats,

1015
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:25,119
but soon he shall have to make
an advantageous match.

1016
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,559
My sister is not happy.

1017
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,959
Remember the man we met
on our country walk?

1018
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,239
He is a good friend of mine,
but he is a lot more than that to my sister.

1019
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,679
But our father has refused to sanction the match.

1020
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,959
Edward is only a second son.

1021
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,159
And Eleanor must marry the heir to a rich estate.

1022
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,639
And... And you?

1023
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:52,079
Well, if I'm to retain my father's favour,
I must marry a fortune, too.

1024
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,199
And shall you?

1025
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,919
I always hoped I'd be lucky,

1026
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,399
that the girl I fell in love with
would come with a fortune attached.

1027
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,479
And...if she should not?

1028
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,839
Then that would be a very...

1029
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,599
stern test of my character.

1030
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,999
Perhaps we'd better head back.
I want to set offfor Woodston before nightfall.

1031
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,879
See you tomorrow for dinner!

1032
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,319
Oh!

1033
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,879
Might I ask how you come to be here all alone?

1034
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,239
I wanted to see your mother's room.

1035
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,359
Eleanor was going to show me,
but your father prevented us.

1036
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,319
And so you thought
you'd come and see it for yourself?

1037
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,079
Yes.

1038
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,999
I suppose Eleanor has talked to you
about our mother?

1039
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,759
Yes.

1040
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,679
But that is not very much.

1041
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,359
What she did say was...

1042
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,239
Her dying so suddenly,
and none of you being at home,

1043
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,879
I thought...

1044
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,439
perhaps your father
had not been very fond of her.

1045
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,679
And from these circumstances you infer...

1046
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,359
..some negligence?

1047
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,079
Or something even worse?

1048
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,959
Then let me reassure you, Catherine.

1049
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,039
My mother's illness was sudden,

1050
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,959
and Eleanor was from home,

1051
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,279
but I was here throughout.

1052
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,239
And so was my brother Frederick.

1053
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,919
Our mother received every possible attention.

1054
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,439
Our physician was satisfied
that nothing more could be done for her.

1055
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,319
The matter was deeply distressing,

1056
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,039




- as you may imagine.
- Yes, of course.

1057
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,799
But your father, was he distressed?

1058
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,039
For a time, greatly so.

1059
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,519
She had had to bear a great deal from him but...

1060
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,359
..when she was dead, he felt her loss.

1061
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,359
I am very glad of it.

1062
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,719
It would have been very shocking if he had...

1063
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,039
- if he had...
- If he had what?

1064
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,239
If I understand you rightly, you have been
suspecting my father of a crime so dreadful...

1065
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,039
You said yourselfthe house was full of secrets!

1066
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,599
And so you decided
that my father must be a murderer...

1067
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,119
..when to you, at least,

1068
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,279
he has shown nothing but kindness?

1069
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,439
Catherine...

1070
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,599
how could you?

1071
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,959
What sort of a fevered imagination
must you have?

1072
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:07,639
Perhaps, after all,
it is possible to read too many novels.

1073
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,959
(Catherine sobs)

1074
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,839
Look, Catherine.

1075
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,319
Oh, whatever is the matter?

1076
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,199
I can't tell you.

1077
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,799
Please don't make me.

1078
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,119
I have been so wickedly foolish
and your brother knows of it.

1079
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,319
And now he will hate me for it,
and so will you when he tells you.

1080
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,279
Oh, my dear Catherine, I'm quite sure that
nothing you could do could make me hate you,

1081
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,839
or Henry either.

1082
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,599
I saw his face. I know.

1083
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,959
He will never, ever respect me again.

1084
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,679
Come, come.
Perhaps it's not as bad as you think.

1085
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,039
Look, here is a letter for you.

1086
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,079
It will be from Isabella.

1087
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,119
Oh.

1088
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,519
No, it is my brother's handwriting.

1089
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,239
JAMES: Dear Catherine,
I think it my dutyto tell you

1090
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,799
that everything is at an end
between Miss Thorpe and me.

1091
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,439
No!

1092
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,519
I shall not enter into particulars.
They would only pain you more.

1093
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,039
You will soon hear enough
to know where the blame lies.

1094
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,959
I am ashamed to think how long I bore it.

1095
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,639
Dear Catherine,
I hope yourvisit at Northanger may be over

1096
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,039
before Captain Tilney
makes his engagement known.

1097
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,959
Captain Tilney?

1098
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,199
Frederick?

1099
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,679
Yes.

1100
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,399
It's just what I feared!

1101
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,839
- Oh, poor, poor James. He loved her so much.
- But Frederick!

1102
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,919
And they are engaged?

1103
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,439
- Yes.
- No, I can't believe that.

1104
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,999
Look here.

1105
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:21,239
"Dearest Catherine,
beware how you give your heart."

1106
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,439
Dear Catherine, I am sorry for your brother,

1107
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,559
sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy.

1108
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:33,119
But my surprise would be greater at Frederick's
marrying her than at any other part ofthe story.

1109
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,839
Why do you say that?

1110
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,759
What are Miss Thorpe's connections?

1111
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,119
What is her fortune? Are they a wealthy family?

1112
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,799
No, not very.

1113
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,279
I don't believe Isabella has any fortune at all.

1114
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,839
You think your father will forbid the match?

1115
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,079
I doubt ifthe matter will reach his ears at all.

1116
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,759
Why? Whatever do you mean?

1117
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,319
Catherine, your friend has dealt very badly
with your brother.

1118
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,199
But I fear she is far out of her depth with mine.

1119
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,399
OFFICER: Look at the size ofthese! (Laughs)

1120
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,119
Come on!

1121
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,119
(Women's laughter outside)

1122
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,439
And...are we engaged?

1123
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,039
Make yourself decent, Miss Thorpe.

1124
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,039
I must return you to your friends
before you're missed.

1125
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,599
ISABELLA: Mydearest Catherine,

1126
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,959
thank God we leave this vile place tomorrow.

1127
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,159
Since you went away, I have had no pleasure
in it, and everybody one cares for is gone.

1128
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,079
I am quite uneasy about your dear brother

1129
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:13,039
and am fearful of some...misunderstanding.

1130
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,559
You will write to him and set everything right?

1131
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:20,159
He is the only man I ever did or could love,
and I know you will convince him of it.

1132
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,999
CATHERINE: I most certainlyshan't!

1133
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,959
So, Frederick is safe from her.

1134
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,599
I can't say I'm surprised.

1135
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,119
Aren't you? I am, very!

1136
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,919
I wish I had never known her.

1137
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,079
It will soon be as if you never had.

1138
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,999
There is one thing I can't understand.

1139
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,959
What has Captain Tilney been about
all this time?

1140
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:47,439
Why should he pay her such attentions
and then fly off himselr?

1141
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,279
He has his vanity, as well as Miss Thorpe.

1142
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,679
And he is accustomed to...

1143
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,599
..having his way.

1144
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,679
Though I am surprised he should have stooped
to such an easy conquest.

1145
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,119
Really?

1146
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,359
Then I am sorry for Isabella.

1147
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,959
I am sure she will be over it soon enough.

1148
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:15,999
I hope I don't need to tell you
that his brother has a very different character.

1149
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,959
Henry has the best and truest heart in the world.

1150
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,799
(Growls)

1151
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,959
Damned little adventuress!

1152
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,079
Eleanor!

1153
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,119
Now!

1154
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,159
I said now!

1155
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,479
Eleanor, whatever can the matter be?

1156
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,319
Come.

1157
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,599
Sit down. You are not well?

1158
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,399
My dear Catherine, I am well.

1159
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,919
God, how shall I tell you?

1160
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,919
It's not concerning Henry?

1161
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,559
No, no, not Henry.

1162
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,919
It is my father himself.

1163
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:16,519
My father has recollected an engagement
that takes our whole family away on Monday.

1164
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,959
Explanation and apology are impossible.

1165
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,719
My dear Eleanor...

1166
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:25,039
Don't be so distressed. I am not offended,
I can be ready to leave on Monday.

1167
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,279
No, that won't be possible.

1168
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,759
Oh, God.

1169
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,719
My father insists on your leaving immediately.

1170
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,719
As soon as you can make yourself ready.

1171
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,919
The carriage will take you to meet
the public stagecoach.

1172
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,359
No servant will accompany you.

1173
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,679
I am to travel all night?

1174
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,199
Alone?

1175
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,879
Have I offended the General?

1176
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,639
I have never seen him more angry.

1177
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,439
Your brother must have been so angry with me,
he told your father what I did...

1178
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,839
..what I suspected.

1179
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,199
I deserve to be sent home in disgrace.

1180
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,039
You are wrong.

1181
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,039
I know my father's reasons
and they do him no credit.

1182
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,519
To turn you out in the middle ofthe night!
Truly, I fear for your safety.

1183
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,639
The journey is nothing.

1184
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,919
But have you enough money to pay your way?

1185
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,079
Oh.

1186
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,079
I never thought ofthat.

1187
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,799
There, at least, I can help you.

1188
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,679
Oh, Catherine. I am so sorry.

1189
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,879
I deserve it.

1190
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,999
I deserve it all.

1191
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,719
ELEANOR: (Whispers) Catherine,
I implore you, please take it...

1192
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,959
Bye, Catherine.

1193
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,599
(Dog barks)

1194
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,799
(Man shouts in distance)

1195
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,999
DRIVER: Newbury! Newbury coach.

1196
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,439
Come on, get that luggage off!

1197
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,599
(Women cackle)

1198
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,999
It's Cathy!

1199
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,279
Hello! How are you?

1200
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,959
Mother, Catherine's back! She's back!

1201
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,959
These great men can be very strange
and sudden in their behaviour.

1202
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,039
Well, we must live and learn.

1203
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,479
And the next new friends you make
I hope will be better worth keeping

1204
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,119
than the ones you made at Bath.

1205
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,839
No friend can be better worth keeping
than Eleanor.

1206
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,679
And Mr Tilney is not to blame.

1207
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,919
Such a pleasant, agreeable young man,
I thought him.

1208
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,639
He found us a chair, you know.

1209
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,639
And he understands muslin ever so well.

1210
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,959
That's greatly to his credit, I'm sure.

1211
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,199
But has he written?

1212
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,879
Has he offered any kind of explanation?

1213
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,639
No.

1214
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,319
Well...

1215
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,279
I dare say there's no harm done in the end.

1216
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,479
You did very well to manage thatjourney
all on your own, Catherine.

1217
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,679
You always used to be
such a scatter-brained little creature.

1218
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,319
I'm quite proud of you.

1219
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,999
Indeed, I am not proud of myself.

1220
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,679
What was the Abbey like? Was it very scary?

1221
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,999
Were there ghosts?

1222
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,879
It was very big and strange,

1223
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,559
with lots of empty rooms and secret passages.

1224
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:20,359
And I did think there might be ghosts.
But there weren't any ghosts, really.

1225
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:25,999
People who read too many stories imagine all
sorts of horrid things about ghosts and murders.

1226
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:29,399
It is very wrong ofthem to do so,
and it can get you into serious trouble.

1227
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,559
So let me not hear of any of you being so silly.

1228
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,679
Now, what else would you like to hear about?

1229
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,599
What games did you play?

1230
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,839
Um...

1231
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,399
We played I Spy and charades.

1232
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,959
We went horse-riding
and got ourselves very muddy indeed.

1233
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,599
Was Mr Tilney very handsome, Cathy?

1234
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,599
Yes, I think so.

1235
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,839
Very handsome and very kind
and everything he should be.

1236
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,159
Do you love Mr Tilney, Cathy?

1237
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,999
No, of course not.

1238
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,159
Don't talk such nonsense.

1239
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,999
Now...into your beds, all of you.

1240
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,119
That's it.

1241
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,839
Night-night, Cathy.

1242
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,919
GIRL: Night, Cathy!

1243
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,799
What did you do
to make them send you home, Cathy?

1244
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,039
Did you do something very naughty?

1245
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,839
Come on, back into your bed.

1246
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,999
MRS MORLAND: Cathy?

1247
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,199
What is it?

1248
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:00,079
I did love him!

1249
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,559
I do love him!

1250
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,599
Now I shall never see him again
and it is all my own fault.

1251
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,119
Ten...

1252
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,799
..men ran to the fen

1253
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,879
- to get Ben!
- Very good.

1254
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,319
- Cathy!
- Cathy! Cathy!

1255
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,959
It's a man on a white horse!

1256
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,599
Go and tell Mama that Mr Tilney is here.

1257
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,559
BOTH: Mr Tilney!

1258
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,959
Now!

1259
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,599
Go on, boys. In you go, quickly.

1260
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,599
It's Mr Tilney! He's here!

1261
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,639
I am so ashamed ofwhat I said, what I thought...

1262
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,119
No, it is I who should apologise.

1263
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:57,599
There's nothing you have said
that could justify the way you were treated.

1264
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,439
But you were angry with me, and rightly so.

1265
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,959
I was angry with you, but that is long past.

1266
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,799
Your imagination may be overactive.

1267
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,959
But your instinct was true.

1268
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:11,639
Our mother did suffer grievously,
and at the hands of our father.

1269
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,439
Do you remember
I spoke to you of a kind of vampirism?

1270
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,039
Yes.

1271
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:22,079
Perhaps it was stupid to express it so,
but we did watch him drain the life out of her

1272
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,719
with his coldness and his cruelty.

1273
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,959
He married her for her money, you see.
She thought it was for love.

1274
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,079
It was a long time
until she knew his heart was cold.

1275
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,079
No vampires, no blood.

1276
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,559
The worst crimes are the crimes ofthe heart.

1277
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:43,399
But it was stupid and wicked of me
to think such things as I did.

1278
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,159
Cathy!

1279
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,439
Mama says, will you bring Mr Tilney
to the drawing room?

1280
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,519
Come on.

1281
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,119
Mrs Morland,

1282
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,479
after what has happened, I have little right
to expect a welcome at Fullerton.

1283
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,079
You had no part in what happened, Mr Tilney.

1284
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:28,119
And Catherine is as you see her -
no harm done.

1285
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:32,079
Any friends of our children are welcome here.

1286
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,639
Shall we agree to say no more about it?

1287
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,399
You are very good.

1288
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,559
Er...

1289
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,399
Are Mr and Mrs Allen now at Fullerton?

1290
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,039
They are, sir.

1291
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,879
I should like to pay my respects.

1292
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:57,319
Perhaps Miss Morland might show me the way?

1293
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,919
But you can see their house from the window!

1294
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,439
Hush, Lucy.

1295
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,999
I'm sure Catherine will be happy to show you,
Mr Tilney.

1296
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,239
He thought I was rich?

1297
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,879
It was Thorpe who misled him at first,
Thorpe, who hoped to marry you himself.

1298
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:20,559
He thought you were MrAllen's heiress, and
he exaggerated Mr Allen's wealth to my father.

1299
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:24,199
You were only guilty
of not being as rich as you were supposed to be.

1300
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,679
For that, he turned you out ofthe house.

1301
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:30,439
I thought you were so angry with me
you told him what you knew,

1302
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,839
which would have justified any discourtesy.

1303
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,599
No, the discourtesy was all his.

1304
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,519
I have broken with my father, Catherine.

1305
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,559
I may never speak to him again.

1306
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:47,119
- What did he say to you?
- Let me instead tell you what I said to him.

1307
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,079
I told him that I felt myself bound to you,

1308
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,959
by honour, by affection,

1309
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:56,959
and by a love so strong that
nothing he could do could deter me from...

1310
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,999
- From what?
- Before I go on, I should say,

1311
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,679
there's a pretty good chance he'll disinherit me.

1312
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,999
I fear I may never be a rich man, Catherine.

1313
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,839
Please, go on with what you were going to say.

1314
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,119
Will you marry me, Catherine?

1315
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,359
Yes!

1316
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,719
Yes, I will!

1317
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:14,879
Yes!

1318
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:21,759
NARRATOR: To begin perfect happiness
at the respective ages of 26 and 18

1319
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,199
is to do pretty well.

1320
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,359
Catherine and Henry were married.

1321
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,519
And in due course, the joys of wedding
gave wayto the blessings of a christening.

1322
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,959
The bells rang and everyone smiled.

1323
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,839
No-one more so than Eleanor

1324
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,119
whose beloved's unexpected accession
to title and fortune

1325
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,639
finally allowed them to marry.

1326
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,359
I leave itto be settled

1327
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,479
whetherthe tendency ofthis story

1328
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,599
be to recommend parental tyranny

1329
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,439
or reward filial disobedience.

1330
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,199
(Thunder crashes)
