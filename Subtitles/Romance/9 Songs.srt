1
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:22,305
When I remember Lisa, I don't think about our clouds

2
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:26,400
or her work, or where she was from or what she said.

3
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:29,665
I think about her smell, her taste

4
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:32,379
her skin searching mine

5
00:00:43,387 --> 00:00:45,901
The first time I met her was the Brixton Academy

6
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:55,831
# Artist(Band):B.R.M.C.(Black Rebel Motorcycle Club) #

7
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:02,698
# You want a part of me #

# You want the whole thing #

9
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:06,906

# You want it badly You want it tangled #

11
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,903

14
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:19,824
# I gave my heart to a simple chord #

15
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:23,145
# I gave my soul to a new religion #

16
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:25,537
# Whatever happened to you? #

17
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,942
# Whatever happened to our #

# She wants it hallow #

21
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:42,386
# She wants it tainted #

22
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:45,181
# She wants to feel something more than she was naked #

23
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:48,660
# You want to hide away You're scared to touch it #

24
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:50,977
# I want to feel something more than #

25
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:55,220

00:02:12,827 --> 00:02:15,785
# to my rock'n'roll? #

33
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:27,942
# You can't have it crying #

34
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:33,305
# Neither with your disguise. #

35
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:40,026
# Was so sweet, yes #

36
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,985
# She's not the leader of religion #

37
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,938
Go save your soul, ok?

38
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:29,666
Where are you going?

39
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:34,145

A continent of ICE

44
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:57,984
A place where no man had ever been until its 20th century

45
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:41,107

00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:35,236
Ahh...isn't this romantic?

00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:50,302
Beautiful morning...

188
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:56,078
No it's not....it's gray

189
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:07,485
Hang on..I don't want to...scared to death..

190
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:32,019
The only reason I would screaming marriage is about I really loved it

191
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:34,258

192
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:45,184

194
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:57,899

The ICE sheet can be 4 km a date

235
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,861
The ICE found that can be half-million years old.

236
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:23,421
The air trapped in the ICE..

237
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:26,055
We called the climate when the ICE was formed

238
00:25:27,446 --> 00:25:29,778
The Antarctic is a planet's memory

239
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,137
a memory of time before there were the people

240
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:24,296
She is 21...beautiful..egotistical

241
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:26,938
careless and crazy

242
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:32,096
Hey!

243
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,895
listen to this

244
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:40,385
Immediately after I undressing I was 
a little embarrassed discouvered that I had a hard-on

245
00:26:40,587 --> 00:26:42,225
And I lay down on my stomach beside her

246
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,698
One of the misshaped pubic hair

247
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:47,381
You can easily make out of slender delicate slit.

248
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:52,257
I really go for that type of pussy Valery said low voice

249
00:26:53,027 --> 00:26:55,018
It make you feel like slipping  your finger inside?

250
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:59,701
As she lay down..I can make out of the thick plump lips of pussy

251
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:03,862
I heard footsteps approaching accross 
the sand and I closed my eyes again.

252
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,503
It sounds very hard on your skin

253
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:17,904
Don't weigh that belt on my face

254
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,306
You know I got hurt once

255
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:22,856
while wave of fart in front of my face.

256
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,098
Oh..no, don't put me stockings on

257
00:27:30,307 --> 00:27:31,581
No..I can't see..

258
00:27:33,707 --> 00:27:34,981
Forget who you are

259
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:38,986
Forget where you are

260
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,103
You are on a beach in Silent

261
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:12,619
Your eyes closed

262
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,145
So you can't see them

263
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:28,059
You feel them watching you

264
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,904
There's a couple behind me

265
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,261
Am I right?

266
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:11,057
I can feel them looking at me

267
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,457
And I put my hand between my legs.

268
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,026
I am so wet.

269
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:33,581
she slide down her boyfriend body

270
00:29:48,227 --> 00:29:51,503
she has most amazing breast

271
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:58,465
And she is rubbing them

272
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:17,538
And she's covered with the oil

273
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:31,981
She leans toward ...to her...rr

274
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:33,866
her boyfriend

275
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:41,020
she grabs his balls.

276
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,098
Put his cock in her mouth

277
00:30:54,427 --> 00:30:56,099

Its own fucking interesting when you start taking pills this time a day

381
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:16,255

386
00:45:39,147 --> 00:45:40,102

Explorering Antarctic..

444
00:52:37,307 --> 00:52:38,820
is almost like exploring space

445
00:52:39,507 --> 00:52:40,860
You enter a void

446
00:52:41,547 --> 00:52:43,291
Thousand of mile with no poeple..

447
00:52:43,443 --> 00:52:45,421
no animals..no plants

448
00:52:46,107 --> 00:52:47,620
You isolated on a vast...

449
00:52:47,787 --> 00:52:48,981
empty continent

450
00:52:49,147 --> 00:52:51,786
Claustrophobia and Agoraphobia is in a same place

451
00:52:53,227 --> 00:52:54,945
like a two people in a bed

452
00:53:54,907 --> 00:53:59,082
We spend my birthday in a hotel where friend of Lisa worked

453
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:05,267
Lisa gave me a book on Antarctic as my present

454
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,703
The Ice is everywhere and everything

455
00:54:12,507 --> 00:54:15,305
It spreads to all sides unbounded void of

456
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:17,617
alien whiteness in geometric rigor

457
00:54:18,427 --> 00:54:21,737
The Antarctic is highest, windest, driest continents

458
00:54:22,507 --> 00:54:24,737
Its topography and dynamics is simpliest on earth

459
00:54:24,907 --> 00:54:26,863
An exercise of reductionism

460
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:34,507
The iceberg is the microcosm of the Antarctica

461
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:38,906
Its fragment torn loose from the continents both substance and symbol

462
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:42,896
within it's ICE the burg contains record of all ICE terrains

463
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:46,544
As it moves away from the massive ICE it gradually disintegrates

464
00:54:47,627 --> 00:54:50,061
Most burgs last less than two month in an open sea

465
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,545
so your back...

466
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,783
It's just this ...back & forth

467
00:55:06,187 --> 00:55:07,939
But you have to move your ass more

468
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,699
- Do you love it? //- Turn around

469
00:55:20,347 --> 00:55:21,496
Bend over

470
00:55:25,427 --> 00:55:26,621
What time is it?

471
00:55:27,027 --> 00:55:28,062
I don't know

472
00:55:29,547 --> 00:55:30,900
Souldn't have a light?...

473
00:55:37,787 --> 00:55:39,300
That's so attractive

474
00:55:41,187 --> 00:55:42,506
Yeah...

475
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:45,860
We will save the rest for late

476
00:55:48,427 --> 00:55:50,987
It is Michael Nyman's 60th birthday concert

477
00:56:35,147 --> 00:56:37,297
That was the night she told me she's going back to America.

478
00:56:41,787 --> 00:56:42,936
You looks like a gangster, you like that?

479
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:45,025
Trying look like a gangster

480
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:50,456
You look ugly

481
00:56:52,907 --> 00:56:54,195
Trying look ugly

482
00:56:54,354 --> 00:56:58,408
it's just for a year..um..?

483
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,578
Sometimes you have to have faith in people

484
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:44,375
- You miss me? //- Always

485
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:02,103
There's only a week before her flight to home

486
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:05,302
She was like a tourist on holiday In London

487
01:00:05,827 --> 01:00:08,057
she bought souvenirs and Christmas presents

488
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:10,825
She was happy to be leaving

489
01:00:13,787 --> 01:00:15,266
- Are you ready? //- Yeah!

490
01:00:15,547 --> 01:00:16,821
- One, two, three! //- Heee..Ya

491
01:00:18,707 --> 01:00:20,306
- Ha..ha I like this //- Yeah...

492
01:00:20,307 --> 01:00:22,582
I see in your future

493
01:00:24,267 --> 01:00:25,256
Hey

494
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:34,656
The day she left was the first time she invite me to her apartment

495
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:38,825
She didn't want me to come in the airport mount the station with her

496
01:00:39,547 --> 01:00:41,185
She didn't want any long goodbyes

497
01:01:11,787 --> 01:01:15,496
That you fly over the continet you see the journey of the ice in reverse

498
01:01:15,827 --> 01:01:18,102
The sea, the Iceberg, the see Ice,

499
01:01:18,267 --> 01:01:20,701
the Ice-shelf and the Ice sheet

500
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:24,461
Each year the Ice inches its way from the heart of the continent

501
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:27,095
to the see into which it finally melts

502
01:01:33,627 --> 01:01:34,855
It's beautiful!
