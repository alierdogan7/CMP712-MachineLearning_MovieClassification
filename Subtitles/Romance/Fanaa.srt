1
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,485
Our India is the best..

2
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,993
of all the world by far

3
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:52,170
Our India is the best..

4
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:56,668
..of all the world by far

5
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,773
We are it's buds.

6
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:05,443
It is our garden, all ours, ours.

7
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,484
Our India is the best..

8
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,490
..of all the world by far

9
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,487
This way.

10
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,830
Our tomorrow is based on our today

11
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,336
What we choose to do today will decide..

12
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,740
..what happens to us tomorrow.

13
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,171
The choice isn't between good and evil.

14
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,513
That's easy.

15
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,179
The real choices of life
are choosing between..

16
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:45,220
..the lesser of two evils,
or the greater of two goods.

17
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,155
Now what do you choose,
Zooni, what's your choice?

18
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,461
Oh, leave my little girl alone!

19
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,991
Just listen to your heart dear..

20
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,567
..not your father's philosophy!

21
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,164
Try and take some decisions..

22
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,171
..from the heart rather than the brain, Zulfi

23
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:08,013
If I'd used my brain you wouldn't be here,
Nafisa my love.

24
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,945
So? Zooni?

25
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,785
Papa, Mama, I really can't decide.

26
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,051
I'll do whatever you say.

27
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,454
So that's it. It's decided.

28
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,561
Zooni will not go to Delhi.

29
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:36,575
I found my prince.
When will Zooni find hers?

30
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,473
When will some footballer
hit her head with a ball?

31
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,237
Any regrets?

32
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,643
Regrets?

33
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:51,347
I praise God every day that the
great Zulfikar Ali Beg's..

34
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:52,855
..penalty kick missed the goal..

35
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,625
..and hit me, square on the head.

36
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,455
It was my worst kick ever!

37
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,721
Any regrets?

38
00:04:59,132 --> 00:04:59,962
Regrets?

39
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,733
That's why I tended to you
in the hospital for a week.

40
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,740
We must accept that Zooni..

41
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,173
..may have to live her life without
that special someone.

42
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,245
That perhaps she will never marry.

43
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:24,548
And when we're gone
who will look out for her?

44
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,451
We must give her the
chance to live her life.

45
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,294
We need to support her independence.

46
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:37,096
Be her strength, not her weakness.

47
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,585
Madam Mehbooba

48
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,619
Bobo, the name is Bobo not Mehbooba

49
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,294
Whatever you command your highness.

50
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,123
By the way, your bags weigh
more than your brain!

51
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,126
Obviously! Haven't you heard that saying?

52
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,860
Which one?
- “The buffalo is bigger than the brain.”

53
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,298
No dummy, it's “Is the brain bigger
or the buffalo?”

54
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,474
Fatty! - Not Fatty, Fatima.

55
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,075
Don't know why you girls insist on
distorting perfectly good names.

56
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,213
Yes, Ruby. - Not Ruby, Rubina.

57
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,549
Come on.. take the bags at least!

58
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,492
We have to represent Kashmir,
at a Republic Day performance..

59
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,025
..at the President's Palace,
in front of the Chief Minister of Delhi..

60
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,356
..and what do I have to pull this off?

61
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,693
A bunch of wild cats!

62
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,270
If we're a bunch of wild cats
what does that make our leader?

63
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:49,536
Who said that?

64
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,539
You've carried your knitting?

65
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,146
When we're upset,
we say things to distract

66
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,212
“Have you taken your knitting?

67
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,644
Kept your ticket safely?

68
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,310
Don't get off at a station on the way.”

69
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,814
God keep you safe.

70
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:09,460
Papa.. papa! When papa's upset,
not just his voice

71
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,026
His walk also changes.

72
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,530
Yes, and he can't even cry in front of all these girls.

73
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,938
But I have no such problem!

74
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:28,044
I know you have to do this..

75
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,706
..but I don't know why, I'm afraid.

76
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:32,951
Afraid of what ?

77
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,048
Loosing me to some prince?

78
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:35,753
Oh, I wish!

79
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,422
One look at you,
and he'll be on his knees

80
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,920
Heaven forbid! Will he be a porter?

81
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,649
Kneel to get my bags? - Hush!

82
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:45,430
Not a porter, not your bags,
he'll take your heart away.

83
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,999
With some poetry maybe..

84
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,268
..”Every once in a while
I get this feeling in my heart..

85
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,834
..that you were made for me, all apart.”

86
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,769
“You were living in the
mountains somewhere..

87
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,271
..before there was me.”

88
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,878
“You have been called down
to this earth, only for me.”

89
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,918
God keep you safe, my child,
God keep you safe!

90
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,090
God keep you, mama.

91
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,756
Have a safe journey.

92
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,265
Be sure to say a prayer for me
at the Jama Masjid. - Yes, mama.

93
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,933
Take Zooni for an eye test in the big city..

94
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,863
..and you, Rubina take care of my baby!

95
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,263
Relax Aunty.

96
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,097
Don't worry, I'm here aren't I?

97
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,773
That's what I'm afraid of Fatima.

98
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,100
It's Fatty, aunty.

99
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,437
Bye dear, Bye Zooni!

100
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,515
Mama! Mama!

101
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,318
Yes, my child !

102
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,448
If the Prince recites poetry
what should I say?

103
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,992
“May my life's breath find refuge in your heart..

104
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,826
..destroyed in your love may my life depart.”

105
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,499
Bye Mama!

106
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,159
Why do you do this?

107
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,596
You can say something as well.

108
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,995
Now listen up Rao.
We're here for just 7 days.

109
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,501
5 days to the show, and 2 for holidaying.

110
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,675
I want to sight- see Delhi,
not your bald head.

111
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,740
Stand straight like a man!

112
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,170
I'm not even a man any more Madam.

113
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,608
After years of bowing to
government officers..

114
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,179
..I have come to this sorry state.

115
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,011
Today if I have children,
even they will be born bent over.

116
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,756
I have no interest in your
family planning program!

117
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:51,955
Where is that tour guide?

118
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,625
I am the Balwaan.
Not the Cartoon Network.

119
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,337
You are exactly what you look like!

120
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,799
Now tell me what's the problem here?

121
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,070
Where do I start?

122
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,398
From the head light to the exhaust..

123
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,475
..there are problems and more problems.

124
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,846
I mean your tour guide.
Where on earth is he?

125
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:28,625
“Don't look around the city
Forget the wasteland too”

126
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:34,792
“Behold God's greatest creation.
Rehan is just above you.”

127
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,640
You Mr. Romeo. Stop this cheap poetry!

128
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,453
You didn't applaud me, now at least help me

129
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,348
Oh, you're blind.

130
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,392
Yes, you didn't see that?
Are you blind too?

131
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,194
Thank God, I'm not.

132
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,470
That's a nice thing to say to a blind person.

133
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,502
If I was blind, I couldn't have seen..

134
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:19,140
..the most beautiful thing in the world, you.

135
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:27,709
“Your beauty made God make a mistake,
what more can I say ?.

136
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,512
So that you don't caste an evil eye on yourself,
he took your eyes away.”

137
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,854
Zooni, where are you?

138
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,023
I'm coming Fatty.

139
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,094
Fatty? Is that your name or your dog's?

140
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,026
Come on Balwante..

141
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,031
..hit the gas!

142
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,695
Heavenly!

143
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,941
If wish I was a roll of wool..

144
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,547
If wish I was a roll of wool..

145
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,919
..wrapped around her fingers..

146
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,757
If you were a roll of wool,
with the needles.. I'd..

147
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,929
I wish she'd make a sweater out of me,
wear me, even in the summer.

148
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,594
Wow! What a thought!

149
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,929
Zooni, stop encouraging his nonsense.

150
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,873
“I am not the flower jasmine,
I am the flower rose.

151
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,009
I am your lifelong admirer,
not of your friend sitting close.”

152
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,813
Hey Mr. Guide, your cheap poetry
is going to get you nowhere.

153
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,250
So, who are you knitting this sweater for?

154
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,089
She's knitting it for a prince,
not for a devil like you.

155
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,595
And if she was interested in you ..

156
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,926
..she would speak up not sit silent.

157
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,329
Oh, so she does speak ?

158
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,835
I knew she was blind,
thought she was mute too

159
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,342
Zooni! Don't talk to him,
You don't know these men..

160
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,436
Looks like you know men very well.

161
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,344
Stupid guide

162
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,718
“If you sit there in silence, regret it you will.

163
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,292
So often after silence love
has awakened, stronger still.”

164
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,603
“There is no limit to human desire..”

165
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,101
“There is no limit to human desire, no dearth.

166
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,273
After 2 yards of burial cloth,
we still want 2 yards of earth.”

167
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,276
Superb!

168
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,107
Superb! Outstanding!

169
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:20,154
“I'll look pain square in the eye,
face every test laid out for me.

170
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,662
For the sake of your friendship,
dear friend, I'll even love my enemy.”

171
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,667
Oh yeah, I love your style!

172
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,509
The emperor Shah Jahan once walked
these lanes of the Red Fort.

173
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:47,752
And so did Mumtaz,
his very, very beautiful wife.- Careful!

174
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,221
I can manage myself.

175
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,118
But how will I manage myself, around you.

176
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,060
Shall we?

177
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,331
Bobo, tell me, what does he look like?

178
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,840
Killer, girl, a real killer.

179
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,519
He's simply obnoxious!

180
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,054
He looks ok, so I thought
he must be a nice guy..

181
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,322
..but he called me a stupid girl.. so..

182
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,894
And forget all his sweet talk..

183
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,396
.. the way he looks at women, it's shameful!

184
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,696
And he told me he doesn't believe in God,
can you imagine that?

185
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,232
Look even the crows are cawing.
It's a sign.

186
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,000
Stay away from that Rehan guide.

187
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,912
“How can you stay away from me and go?

188
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,412
How can your heart forget me so?

189
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,813
That fragrance on your breath is me.

190
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,791
How ever will you stop, not breathe?”

191
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,395
Great! Fabulous!

192
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,563
Come on, let's go.

193
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,390
Come.

194
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,619
If the moon was to recommend me.

195
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,795
This is what he'd say to you.

196
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,464
I want to drop the veil of decency.

197
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,636
I want to cross the line with you.

198
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,304
I insist on destroying myself.

199
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,137
On destroying myself in you.

200
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,142
If the moon was to recommend me.

201
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,352
This is what he'd say to you.

202
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,020
I want to drop the veil of decency.

203
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,521
I want to cross the line with you.

204
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:10,520
Your charms are like a gentle breeze.

205
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,520
Let them touch me as you pass.

206
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,256
Your every move a graceful branch.

207
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,465
Please move into my heart.

208
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,367
Come into my arms,
any excuse will do.

209
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,200
For I must, I must destroy myself in you.

210
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,208
If the moon was to recommend me.

211
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,381
This is what he'd say to you.

212
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,185
I want to drop the veil of decency.

213
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,879
I want to cross the line with you.

214
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,098
If I tell you my true intentions.

215
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,330
I'm sure they'll make you blush.

216
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,112
If I make you hear my heartbeats.

217
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,281
I'm sure they'll leave you flushed.

218
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,945
But I cannot hide my feelings true.

219
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,987
For I must, I must destroy myself in you.

220
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,922
If the moon was to recommend me.

221
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,154
This is what he'd say to you.

222
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,661
I want to drop the veil of decency.

223
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,005
I want to cross the line with you.

224
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,603
I insist on destroying myself.

225
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:17,679
On destroying myself in you.

226
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:42,399
Stand straight. Looking at you
I'm getting a backache.

227
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,575
And you Mr. Cartoon Network..

228
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,074
..we have to leave for rehearsal
at exactly 9 AM tomorrow.

229
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,074
So then leave.

230
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,577
It's me. Rehan.

231
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,523
I know. Only you can be so impudent.

232
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,229
I want to be even more impudent.

233
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,064
I want you to run away with me.

234
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,407
I want to show you Delhi.

235
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:26,740
Without your bodyguards,
don't say no, not without thinking at least

236
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,284
You'll anyway be thinking about me so...

237
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,953
God forbid, the crows are cawing.

238
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:47,462
I'll wait for you after the rehearsal tomorrow.
With these crows.

239
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:00,408
You have had more girls in your life
than there is mileage on my bus.

240
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,116
Why do you want this blind girl?

241
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,092
What can I do Balwante,
everyone wants the moon.

242
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:13,297
There's just one headlight in the sky,
that shows us the way.

243
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,965
Now you want that too?

244
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,969
“They say in love you always loose sleep.

245
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:26,311
I wish someone would love me,
I bloody sleep and sleep and sleep.”

246
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:28,808
Let's go.

247
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,812
Zooni! You must be tired, go to sleep.

248
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,690
I am awake after so many years.

249
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,698
I can't sleep now. I can't sleep now.

250
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:58,203
I want to be even more impudent,
I want you to run away with me.

251
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,642
Why aren't you concentrating?

252
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,646
Can I use your phone ?

253
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,646
Pick up, mama!

254
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,191
This is one decision you'll have
to take on your own Zooni .

255
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,527
Oh Lord, how silly of me.

256
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,201
Of course there's no point in your..

257
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,700
..going sightseeing when you can't see.

258
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,704
Okay. You can go back to the
hostel after rehearsal.

259
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,715
Fine! At least you'll be away from
that Rehan guide.

260
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,591
Brother, tell me something.
You stand here all day.

261
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:54,424
Don't you wish you were inside
on the President's chair?

262
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,095
Why should I think that?

263
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,767
In the police we regularly get promoted.

264
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,201
But once you're President,
there's no scope of promotion at all!

265
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,367
You're a very jolly man!

266
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,872
All thanks to my grandfather.

267
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,711
Grandfather?
- My grandfather worked for the British.

268
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,382
All day long he would hear them say
'Jolly Good' this and 'Jolly Good' that.

269
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,211
When I was born he was losing his memory.

270
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,421
All he remembered was 'Jolly Good'.

271
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,089
So that's what he named me. Jolly Good.

272
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,591
Yes, yes have a laugh at me.

273
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,260
Even the officers that pass by here say..

274
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,760
..”Jolly Good..Singh” laugh and move on.

275
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,259
I think that's great.

276
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,263
Thanks to you, the country
is run in good spirits!

277
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:43,777
“I felt God himself had blessed me.

278
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:49,120
When all she did was to address me.”

279
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,427
Look, I sent Rana with Balwaan and the bus.

280
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,262
No, I'm not coming today.

281
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,430
So what if I didn't tell you earlier.
I'm telling you now.

282
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,775
Let's go.
- You left work without permission?

283
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,443
So?

284
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,777
My father says that if a person
can't be loyal to their work..

285
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,607
..they can't be trusted for anything.

286
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,622
I've left work for you and you're
giving me a speech on loyalty?

287
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,325
My mother says there is
nothing bigger than loyalty.

288
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,487
If you're done with your mother and
father's sermons can we go?

289
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,163
Why am I saying all this to you ?

290
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,330
Why are you saying all this to me?

291
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,497
So that I go back to work?

292
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:39,499
Yes.

293
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,507
Think about it, if I go today
I won't come back tomorrow.

294
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,015
I'll go back to the guest house,
you'll go back to work.

295
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,847
Tomorrow you'll take the day off
and then we'll go, ok?

296
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:06,830
You've heard what your parents
have said. Now hear me.

297
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,668
If I go today I will not come back tomorrow.

298
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,834
You'll come. Let's go.

299
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:27,007
“I don't live the life of the selfless,
nor do I grab another's wine.

300
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,550
If she has love let her come and declare it..

301
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:35,055
..to ask her, to follow her, I decline.”

302
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,390
God be with you.

303
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:56,913
Greetings Ms. Zooni.

304
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,407
Greetings Mr. Jolly

305
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,345
You know what happened yesterday?

306
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,557
Yesterday I said good morning to 20 people..

307
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,725
..and they all said good evening to me instead.

308
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,727
How can so many people be wrong?

309
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,396
It was my watch that was wrong.
It stopped in the morning..

310
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,066
..so I said 'good morning' to
people all day long!

311
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,060
I can't see Rehan today.

312
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,900
I can't see him either.

313
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:29,245
I think he's like me.
Completely clean at heart..

314
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,075
..and completely muddled in the head.

315
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,412
“I couldn't quench my thirst with water
so I set off for the bar.

316
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,747
I gave up complaining to God about you..

317
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,124
..for He is the most smitten by you, by far.”

318
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,633
I'm with you now.

319
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,633
So, how are you going to
show Delhi to a blind girl?

320
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,735
Can you see me?

321
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:03,906
No.

322
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,620
What's my voice like?

323
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,292
Like the thunder before the storm.

324
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,632
What do I smell like?

325
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:31,142
Like the earth after the first rain.

326
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,809
What do I feel like?

327
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,022
Like a prince in a beggar's clothing

328
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,033
And just like this you will see Delhi.

329
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,315
Watch out! This is the Gateway of Blood.

330
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,144
The emperor Aurangzeb had his brother..

331
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,479
..Dara Shikoh beheaded,
and hung his head up here. - there.

332
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,518
Exactly where you are standing.

333
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,355
And the British government
killed two sons and..

334
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,358
..a grandson of Bahadur Shah Zafar,
right there, behind you.

335
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,692
Please. That's enough.
Let's leave from here.

336
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,699
This is the bloody history of Delhi.

337
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:39,709
The Mughals, the British,
a lot of bloodshed had happened here

338
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,545
That's why, till today, tears of
blood flow from these walls.

339
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,045
Scared? What did you think?

340
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,253
I wouldn't get back at you for yesterday?

341
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,587
And what did you think,
I'd get scared so easily?

342
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,586
When I have never seen any colors..

343
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,262
...how can the color of blood scare me?

344
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,654
Now you're scared.

345
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,673
I'm going. I'm going to Delhi,
to get her back.

346
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,671
It's been 4 days.
That's enough to understand life.

347
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,337
What'll be happening to her without us?
Just think?

348
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,487
She's brought up on home food,
she must be starving.

349
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:11,993
The Delhi crowds,
who will look out for her?

350
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:12,999
I'm not there.

351
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,182
I can't take her agony any more, I'm going.

352
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,385
Are you going for her sake or for your own?

353
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,724
You were right, Rehan.

354
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,894
You did show me Delhi.

355
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,913
They say, the feelings one
gets for the country..

356
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,412
..in front of the Eternal Soldier Flame..

357
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,246
..one gets for love in front of the Taj Mahal.

358
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,786
Feelings, love, that's all just talk.

359
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:49,633
When it comes down to basics
then needs are everything.

360
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,796
Needs of the stomach, needs of the body

361
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,473
So you believe needs are everything..

362
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,971
..and feelings are nothing? - Yes.

363
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,404
So all this time you're spending with me..

364
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,740
..is this also to fulfill some need?

365
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:14,615
You shouldn't tease a man like me.
My needs are great.

366
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,451
Even one chicken is not enough.

367
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,119
Even one girl is not enough.

368
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,310
So, Mr. Rehan, how are things with you?

369
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,309
And how are you Zeenat?

370
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,351
Forgotten how I am?

371
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,815
Come and meet me, I'll remind you.

372
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:53,522
It's my fault actually.
He's been busy with me.

373
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,525
That's what makes Rehan guide so special.

374
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,303
So, when do you plan on
being busy with me again?

375
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,477
“I can't explain the ways
of this market to you,

376
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,645
He who is sold, can't ever be a buyer anew.”

377
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:20,521
You'll never improve. Ever.
Good evening.

378
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,532
You seem to know her very well.

379
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:37,539
That's me.

380
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:44,047
I told you I only believe in needs..

381
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,048
..not in feelings or love.

382
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,211
And I only believe in love.

383
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,861
Meeting that guide on the sly.

384
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,538
Forget Helen,
I can't believe you lied to me!

385
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,364
This is just why I lied to you.

386
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,370
You're less of a friend and more of a Hitler.

387
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,373
Hitler? I was just protecting you.

388
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,045
Not me. You were protecting
my blindness.

389
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,382
Zooni, how do I explain it to you?
He just isn't right for you.

390
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:30,560
Perhaps, but when I'm with him
I feel happy, feel alive.

391
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:34,928
And this feeling is special.
Very special.

392
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,265
But I don't like that Guide.
Not one bit.

393
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,436
And I don't care what you say.

394
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,435
I'll never let you go with him.
Never.

395
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:49,610
Turn off your light.

396
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,096
Jolly Singh! Could you please allow
my good luck to come in? Please?

397
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,591
Don't insist.
This tough Sikh has a soft heart.

398
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,598
I'm sorry but rules are rules and
rules are never Jolly Good.

399
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,607
It's ok. I know you're only doing your duty.

400
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,441
But still, I will be singing for him.

401
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,328
People say that after so many years
of independence..

402
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,661
..our Republic Day has lost all meaning.

403
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,997
That it's just another holiday.

404
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,671
But it's not just a holiday for me.

405
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,837
This day marks the birth of my country.

406
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,011
They say that the state
of our country is like..

407
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,150
..that of our old monuments.

408
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,443
What's beautiful was only in the past.

409
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,321
I am blind so I don't see the
faults in my country..

410
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,663
..but why can't those who see,
see the beauty here?

411
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,158
What Emperor Shah Jahan had said
of my home state of Kashmir..

412
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:20,164
..we believe that's true for all of India.

413
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,830
If there is a heaven on earth..

414
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,169
..it is here, it is here, it is here.

415
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:04,848
The earth here changes color at every step.

416
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:09,348
The language here has all the colors best.

417
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,886
The earth here changes color at every step.

418
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,562
The language here has all the colors best.

419
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:23,233
The climes wear green on their head.

420
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:28,063
The sky lays a blue sheet over it's bed.

421
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,072
Golden river, Green ocean,
Every part so dressed.

422
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,576
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

423
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:41,080
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

424
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,421
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

425
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:50,759
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

426
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:08,744
Motherland, I bow to you.

427
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:17,785
The sun with its rose-tinted
neck plays around.

428
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:26,456
The yellow scarf of flowers
covers the shy ground.

429
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,964
Color in the veil, color on the mound,
bright, bright color all around.

430
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:35,466
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

431
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:40,810
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

432
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:07,860
Bright red faces all around,
smiling and glowing in fervour.

433
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:16,539
Colorful laughter, colorful happiness,
relationships full of color.

434
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:20,880
Color in promises, color in memories,
color, color, more color.

435
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:25,213
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

436
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:30,586
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

437
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:13,094
The color of love here runs so deep,
once its on it's there for keeps.

438
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:22,271
The color of true love so still
simply glistens does not spill.

439
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,449
Color in charm, color in manner,
all colors full of flavor.

440
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:31,150
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

441
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:35,651
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

442
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:40,330
The earth here changes color at every step.

443
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:44,830
The language here has all the colors best.

444
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:49,665
The climes wear green on their head.

445
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:54,003
The sky lays a blue sheet over it's bed.

446
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:58,344
Golden river, Green ocean,
Every part so dressed.

447
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:02,776
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

448
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:07,820
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

449
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:15,991
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

450
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,336
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

451
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:24,504
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

452
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:29,679
My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color.

453
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,728
Go Zooni, he's waiting outside for you.

454
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,901
He said I am the cutest of all the girls.

455
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,904
After you of course, Zooni. Go.

456
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,837
Stop. You're not going anywhere.

457
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,511
Certainly not like this.

458
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,345
With your hair all over the place.

459
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,344
You haven't even worn your stole properly.

460
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,883
I can't let you go like this.

461
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,052
You're really..

462
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,223
Ok, Ok, that's enough of that.

463
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,221
Go now.

464
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:28,734
Let's go.

465
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:39,241
“The fire is in the sun,
but it's the earth that does the burning.

466
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,119
The eyes fall in love,
but it's the heart.

467
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,616
..that does the suffering.”

468
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,123
You're looking exceptionally
beautiful this evening.

469
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,128
Really?

470
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,463
You're looking exactly the same to me.

471
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,907
You have brought me here? You ?

472
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,912
I thought you don't believe in God.

473
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,120
Will you just keep quiet for a bit?

474
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,787
Shut your eyes now.

475
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,126
Rehan, my eyes are always shut.

476
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,971
Rest your eyelids

477
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,807
They say this blessed water does miracles.

478
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,688
I hope that's true.

479
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,954
No one has ever asked for
such a blessing for me.

480
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,636
I'm not asking for you,
I'm asking for myself.

481
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,968
Perhaps if your eyes are open
you'll keep your mouth shut!

482
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,517
It's so loud!

483
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,351
This is the real Delhi.

484
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,020
The quiet museums, Red Fort,
that's not the real Delhi.

485
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,520
This is the sound of Delhi.
the essence of Delhi

486
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,189
I wish I was deaf as well ...

487
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,862
Just a minute. Wait here.

488
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,862
Yes, it's me.

489
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,867
Yes, yes, I got it alright.

490
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,199
Rehan, you're watching me, aren't you?

491
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,048
What's this madness?

492
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,879
I just wanted to show you.

493
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,086
Show what? That you're such a fool?

494
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,212
- I'll call you later.

495
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,523
Boys, and girls you know..

496
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:07,856
..they impress each other
on their first dates. So I too.

497
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:13,701
Your life is very precious Zooni..

498
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,534
..don't waste it on anyone.
Certainly not on me.

499
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,376
My mother says, to gain something
you have to loose something.

500
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,039
Oh God!

501
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,046
Mother says this, father says that..

502
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,252
..where is Zooni in all this?
What does Zooni say?

503
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,380
Nobody's ever asked Zooni

504
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:34,715
I'm asking you. Tell me.

505
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,592
I like you.

506
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:47,428
Let's go.

507
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,254
Now you're scared.

508
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:20,595
Our destiny has brought us
these precious moments today

509
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:32,278
Look at me up close,
imbibe me in every way

510
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,116
You're still scared.

511
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:44,658
Just in case your fate has
another card to play

512
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:52,995
Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed

513
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,499
I'll manage from here.

514
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:08,942
Come in to my arms, hold me close,
we may never again have this night's repose

515
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:20,153
Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed

516
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:31,501
Come in to my arms, hold me close,
we may never again have this night's repose

517
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:42,343
Think we'll never meet again, just suppose,
not till this lifetime is forever closed

518
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,847
Where is Rehan the gorgeous?

519
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,053
What's the time, Bobo?

520
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,550
Ten thirty

521
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,555
My watch is fine, why is he late?

522
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,557
It's our last day.

523
00:48:56,867 --> 00:49:00,325
Maybe he's getting you a gift, so he's late.

524
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,329
He himself is a gift.

525
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,002
No news?

526
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,338
No.

527
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,220
No Fatty. Nothing yet.

528
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:23,558
Mama.

529
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,727
How are you my child?

530
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:31,057
We saw the performance on TV.

531
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,893
It was fantastic.

532
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:37,232
When everyone stood up to clap.
Your father and me..

533
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:41,069
I want to speak to you about something.

534
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,243
What is it? Tell me.

535
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,745
When papa and you first met.

536
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,913
After he tended to you in the hospital..

537
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:54,954
..if he had suddenly disappeared.
What would you have done?

538
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,457
I would have asked him why
he was misbehaving.

539
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:01,789
And told him to stop his
nonsense immediately.

540
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,626
Misbehaving? Who is misbehaving?

541
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,630
So is that what I should do?

542
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,134
Who is he?

543
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:08,963
Who is who?

544
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,304
So do you love him?

545
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,808
Do you love him? What are you saying?
Give me the phone.

546
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,641
Just a minute. - Give me the phone.
I'll deal with this.

547
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,682
So what have you decided?

548
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:30,158
Nothing. I don't think he loves me.

549
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,854
Just remember one thing dear..

550
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:36,532
..give your life for the one
who gives you his love..

551
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:40,031
..but give your self-respect only to..

552
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,363
..the one who is willing to be
destroyed for your love.

553
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,546
This is Humayun's tomb.

554
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,046
It was constructed for him
by his wife Hamida.

555
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:57,047
Take a look at what a wife
made for her husband.

556
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,083
And you can't even make me breakfast.

557
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:03,349
Don't worry, I'll start building
your tomb right away.

558
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:08,356
Come... - I am blind and you are the
one who can't see me...

559
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,694
“If by mistake I have made a mistake..

560
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,530
..then please consider it a
mistake and forget it.

561
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,704
But only forget the mistake..

562
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,373
..even by mistake don't ever forget me.”

563
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,876
Heard that? Great!

564
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:28,706
Take them ahead.

565
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,919
Let's go. - But our guide?

566
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:43,257
Move it! Look here, the Qutub Minar.

567
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:51,438
No Zooni, Fatty was right.

568
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:58,104
You should love a prince,
not a devil like me.

569
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,880
It's too late now.
Now this devil is my prince.

570
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,086
I can't give you anything.

571
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:19,259
Remember I told you, I believe in needs,
not in feelings or love.

572
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:29,267
Women are like cities for me.
I spend some time in one.

573
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,277
I get to know it, get immersed in it and..

574
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:33,608
..and then move to another city.

575
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:40,053
This is me, and I can't change.

576
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:50,155
Look Rehan, all this stuff about princes
is good in dreams and stories.

577
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,994
In reality I have found you.

578
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,831
We haven't met by chance,
we've met by destiny.

579
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,166
If not the rest of our lives, we can spend..

580
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,777
..the next 12 hours together, can't we?

581
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:09,947
Perhaps that's all we have,
just today, just now.

582
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:21,662
Don't come close to me,
this storm will destroy you.

583
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:29,338
“May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart

584
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:36,007
May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart.

585
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:40,007
Destroyed in your love may my life depart.”

586
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:53,059
How can you love me so much?
How can anyone love another so much?

587
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,670
I promise you this Zooni Ali Beg..

588
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:11,338
..the next 12 hours will be the
most beautiful of your life.

589
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,237
The raindrops have a conspiracy.

590
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,073
They have a silent wish, a plea.

591
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,080
The raindrops have a conspiracy.

592
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,910
They have a silent wish, a plea.

593
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:29,284
Look, just see.

594
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:35,794
Look, just see.

595
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:39,130
Softly, slowly this gentle breeze.

596
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,963
Says so much, listen please.

597
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:48,303
Why the distance between you and me.

598
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:53,149
Look, just see.

599
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:59,851
Look, just see.

600
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:36,852
Never again will the winds be this shameless.

601
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:42,865
Never again will our steps falter so blameless.

602
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:49,034
Never again will the winds be this shameless.

603
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:54,876
Never again will our steps falter so blameless.

604
00:56:56,279 --> 00:57:01,478
This rain is not so straight, it has a twist.

605
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:06,518
It's telling us something as it pours and mists.

606
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,693
Just understand it.

607
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:17,859
Just understand it.

608
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,535
Softly, slowly this gentle breeze.

609
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,705
Says so much, listen please.

610
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:29,871
Why the distance between you and me.

611
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:34,209
Look, just see.

612
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:41,753
Look, just see.

613
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:26,935
Desire, like a fire-fly, glows bright then dim.

614
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:32,775
It's such a sweet predicament that we're in.

615
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:38,439
Desire, like a fire-fly, glows bright then dim.

616
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:44,449
It's such a sweet predicament that we're in.

617
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:51,651
Don't discard the request
from our lips like this.

618
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:56,327
Don't call this wish of
our breathe remiss.

619
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,269
Just touch, Feel this.

620
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:07,769
Just touch, Feel this.

621
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,605
Softly, slowly this gentle breeze.

622
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,778
Says so much, listen please.

623
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:19,317
Why the distance between you and me.

624
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,656
Look, just see.

625
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,330
Look, just see.

626
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:29,997
Look, just see.

627
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,831
Look, just see.

628
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:44,172
Look, just see.

629
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:13,541
Rehan! Wake up. Wake up.

630
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,439
My train is at 10.
If you don't wake up I'll miss it.

631
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,480
I spoke to Fatty and she's bringing
my things to the station.

632
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,681
We don't have to go to the guest house.
How much you sleep?

633
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,211
Wake up! Don't you have to
go to work as well?

634
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,354
And don't you dare miss work today

635
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:33,128
See I forgot, Mama had told me
to get the eye test done.

636
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,229
And Papa has asked for a chess set.

637
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,026
Can we stop and get one on the way?
Do we have time?

638
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,897
Rehan! Are you listening?

639
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:51,307
Oh, I didn't even say goodbye
to Jolly Good Singh.

640
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:59,144
You please tell him for me.
Here's my address...

641
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,214
Will you write to me?

642
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,051
Your wife's first visit home after marriage?

643
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,408
I want to say..

644
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:32,417
No, Rehan. You made no promises
and I will not ask you for anything.

645
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:39,020
I always wanted love to be the
most important thing in my life..

646
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:48,202
..and now, thanks to you, it is.
You were wrong Rehan.

647
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:53,536
I am not destroyed in your storm
I am rejuvenated.

648
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,350
Now your picture will
remain with me always.

649
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,754
And now I can't leave.

650
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,825
Not until you step off my stole.

651
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:39,046
God be with you Rehan, be happy.

652
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,633
Now can I say I told you so

653
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:30,096
No

654
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:35,339
I won't say it. I'll never say it.

655
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:41,442
“May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart.”

656
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,883
“May my life's breath find
refuge in your heart.”

657
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,392
“Destroyed in your love
may my life depart.”

658
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:10,840
Fatty! If not for me at least
pull the chain for Zooni.

659
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:14,110
With pleasure.

660
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,381
What's going on?
What is the guide doing here?

661
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,625
The brave heart is taking the bride.

662
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:40,800
He wants to marry you?

663
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,341
What? Who is he?
Where is he from?

664
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:44,944
What does he do? What does he look like?
He wants to marry her!.

665
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:47,172
They love each other.

666
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,084
So what did you say?

667
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:52,788
What could I say?
I said he must ask my parents.

668
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:53,885
What did she tell him?

669
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:55,181
She's our daughter..

670
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,653
..she wouldn't give any answer
without our consent.

671
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:02,921
Zooni, I have complete faith in your choice.

672
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,258
Yes, my darling, tell him yes.

673
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:09,562
And we're coming to Delhi
right away to get you married.

674
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,672
Come quickly mama, I miss you.

675
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,504
Now where are you off to?

676
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,335
We're going to Delhi aren't we?
We'll need tickets.

677
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,747
As usual he runs away the moment
there are tears in his eyes.

678
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,680
God keep you mama, God keep you.

679
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,323
God keep you my child, God keep you.

680
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,500
Our daughter has found her prince.

681
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,137
She has found her prince.

682
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:54,815
When did you get your eyes checked last?

683
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:58,079
I don't remember.
Many years ago in Srinagar.

684
01:05:58,354 --> 01:05:59,184
This is the problem.

685
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:05,025
We doctors go on about checkups
and no one listens.

686
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,554
These days science has
progressed so much.

687
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,891
What was impossible 5 years ago
is today possible.

688
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,328
What do you mean?

689
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,662
Retinal replacement can help you.

690
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,338
The chances are very slim..

691
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,402
..I warn you, but there is still a chance.

692
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,168
Are you saying Zooni will be able to see?

693
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,241
There's a chance..

694
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,909
We'll take the chance doctor.

695
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:32,677
I'll check the first available date.

696
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:42,694
There won't be any problem doctor?

697
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,966
The operation must go well.

698
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,634
Don't worry our best team is on it.

699
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,870
I'll meet you after the operation.

700
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:05,085
Rehan! You're hugging me
for the 10th time.

701
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:12,355
I'm not complaining but please don't worry.
I'll be fine.

702
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:17,462
If you're so worried then why didn't
we wait for mama and papa?

703
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,065
We could have done this after the wedding?

704
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,131
Let's go, it's time.

705
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:32,406
Don't forget to get mama and papa
from the station.

706
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,306
And Jolly Good wants to
come here later as well.

707
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,652
You're going to the
President's Palace, right?

708
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:38,853
Yes.

709
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,543
I love you very much.

710
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:09,979
I know.

711
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,019
After the bomb blast in Peshawar..

712
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,691
..Pakistan the independent Kashmir Front
has demanded..

713
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,122
..that both India and
Pakistan leave Kashmir.

714
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:21,351
They want an independent Kashmir..

715
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:26,864
..or else there will be many more
attacks to come.

716
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,751
The Chief Minister is alive..

717
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:49,754
..but as per early reports,
8 security officers have been killed.

718
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,984
And at least 15 others are
badly wounded.

719
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:56,093
The main building has not been
harmed very much..

720
01:08:56,332 --> 01:09:00,200
..but the left side of it has been
completely destroyed.

721
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:01,525
2 terrorists have been captured and..

722
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,705
..the IKF have claimed responsibility.

723
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:08,376
Their demand is that India
and Pakistan leave Kashmir.

724
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,374
And let it be an independent country.

725
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,273
My Child

726
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,779
Mama I can see, I can see.

727
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:50,484
Yes, my darling.

728
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:58,649
Papa I can see.
You can cry in front of me now papa.

729
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:07,161
I can see you cry. But where is Rehan?
He's not with you?

730
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,269
Didn't he get you from the station?

731
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,003
Papa, where are they taking us?
