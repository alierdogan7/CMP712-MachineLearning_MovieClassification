00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,605
- Bro, I'm busy.
- Word, what you doing?

958
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:07,910
Right. Just 'cause you don't pick
up your phone don't make you busy.

959
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:13,715
- You smashed up somebody's car?
- Who told you that?

960
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:18,554
Kerry's sister said she heard you
broke through some guy's window.

961
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:20,322
- Well, did you?
- The guy was a fucking asshole.

962
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:22,124
- What did he do?
- Why you taking his side?

963
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:24,059
- I'm not taking his side.
- You are.

964
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,129
Stop and think for a second.
Stop and think for a second.

965
00:59:27,131 --> 00:59:30,566
I don't care about that guy, I don't
give a damn about his car. Fuck him.

966
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:32,301
What do you think
I'm doing here, man?

967
00:59:32,303 --> 00:59:35,103
- You wanna have a seat?
- Bro, honestly...

968
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:37,573
Man, sit your ass down.

969
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,582
- All right, what happened with your girl?
- Fuck that bitch.

970
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:49,051
- You said that already. What, she drop you?
- No.

971
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:51,820
No? You drop her? After all
that, she cheat on you?

972
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:53,822
- No!
- So, what happened?

973
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,724
Nothing! It's so fucking stupid.

974
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:57,259
That's what I'm saying,
she's a bitch.

975
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,961
She did drop your ass.

976
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:01,597
- What did you do, man? You cheat on her?
- No!

977
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,300
All right, you wanna hear this
shit? It's so fucking retarded.

978
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:07,769
She caught me watching porn.

979
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,005
- That's it?
- Right?

980
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,341
- That's bullshit.
- Swear to God.

981
01:00:12,343 --> 01:00:16,645
Oh, my God! OK, hold on,
hold on, all right.

982
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:21,116
So after all that obligatory shit, the
friend mixing and meeting her folks,

983
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:24,786
she just walks in on you, you know,
beating your meat to a little video

984
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,655
- and she's out?
- You don't know her.

985
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:29,358
- She's crazy, she's a princess.
- Goddamn!

986
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:33,261
- I know.
- No, for real, that's some crazy bullshit right there.

987
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:37,332
- Fuck that bitch.
- Yeah. Fuck that bitch.

988
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:42,704
But you still gonna
finish that class?

989
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:44,773
- Really?
- What are you, my mom?

990
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:47,376
No, I just thought it was almost done.
How much longer you got?

991
01:00:47,378 --> 01:00:51,680
TEACHER: All right, everyone,
three more weeks until the final.

992
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:56,318
If you have any questions or concerns, please
feel free to e-mail me. Have a good night.

993
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:18,040
- JON: Hey.
- ESTHER: Hi.

994
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:21,443
- JON: Where you going?
- ESTHER: To my car.

995
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:25,047
(MOANING)

996
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:27,249
- JON: Oh, shit!
- ESTHER: OK.

997
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:30,218
JON: No, we're fine,
we're fine, we're fine.

998
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,821
(JON GRUNTING)

999
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:35,090
Oh, my God!

1000
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,735
Should've smoked this before,
you might've relaxed a little.

1001
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:49,371
What's that supposed to mean?

1002
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:53,975
I'm playing with you. Trust me, I'm
a perfectly satisfied customer.

1003
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:57,312
- You want some?
- Thanks.

1004
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,985
So I'm parked all the way on the other side.
I don't know if you want...

1005
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:08,156
I know, you wanna get back, so let me enjoy
this and I'll drive you back to your car.

1006
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,125
OK.

1007
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:16,231
- So, what happened with your girlfriend?
- Fuck that bitch.

1008
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,901
- That bad? She find somebody else?
- No.

1009
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:23,505
Wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

1010
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:26,808
She snooped around on my computer,
she found out I watch porn.

1011
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,778
I told her every fucking guy watches
porn, she didn't believe me.

1012
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,049
She acted like I was cheating on
her or something, which I wasn't.

1013
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:36,418
So... we broke up.

1014
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,221
And you know what?
I'm glad we did.

1015
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,924
- Just porn?
- Yeah.

1016
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,961
- No, I don't buy it.
- I'm telling you. That's all.

1017
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:49,464
Was it just once? Oh.

1018
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:54,002
OK. So she caught you once, which is why
you're watching it on your phone at school,

1019
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:56,471
'cause you're hiding it from her,
but she caught you the second time.

1020
01:02:56,473 --> 01:03:00,809
I don't know. Am I right?
I'm just guessing, but...

1021
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:05,981
Oh, God, you're like
a junkie. You can't stop.

1022
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,383
- How often do you watch it?
- What the fuck do you care?

1023
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:13,922
- No, like every day?
- Every guy watches porn every day.

1024
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:18,160
All right. When was the last
time you went a day without it?

1025
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:20,295
- I don't know.
- No, come on, try and think.

1026
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,964
- Seriously, I have no idea.
- Like this week, like this month?

1027
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:26,968
No. I like my porn, OK? I watch it every day.
I always have.

1028
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,539
Maybe when I was a kid, like before I
had a VCR in my room and I couldn't,

1029
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,942
but even then
I had <i>Playboys,</i> so...

1030
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:36,378
- Have you ever thought about quitting?
- Quit...?

1031
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:42,050
- You're talking about it like... No, why would I?
- OK, let me ask you this.

1032
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:45,487
You're a good-looking guy, I'm sure
you attract a lot of young ladies.

1033
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:48,123
Why bother with porn when you
can have the real thing?

1034
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:50,458
Nah, see, it's not
the same thing.

1035
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,261
I mean, real pussy's all good,
but, no offense...

1036
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:58,834
No, no, no offense taken. So
you like porn better than sex?

1037
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,406
Well, what is it?
What do you get from porn

1038
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:07,442
that you don't get from sex
with an actual person?

1039
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,980
- I lose myself.
- You lose yourself.

1040
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:14,983
Yeah, just... goodbye.

1041
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:18,987
- And that doesn't happen when you have sex.
- I wish it did.

1042
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:23,024
Sure, don't we all? Um...

1043
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:26,862
OK. One more question,
then I'll drive you back.

1044
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:31,032
- You ever jerk off without porn?
- What do you mean?

1045
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:56,925
- (COMPUTER CHIMES)
<i>- JON: I'm not like a junkie. Come on, that's stupid.</i>

1046
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,628
<i>It's porn,</i>
<i>it's not fucking heroin.</i>

1047
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:05,066
<i>I knew a few guys in high school who
actually smoked crack, like all the time.</i>

1048
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:10,639
<i>That's like a junkie. They couldn't stop.
I could stop if I wanted to. I could.</i>

1049
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,630
- Hi.
- Hey.

1050
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:12,267
- Somebody's excited.
- Yeah. Come on.

1051
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:16,404
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah? What about?

1052
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,474
Don't you wanna...?

1053
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,611
Don't you wanna wait
till after class?

1054
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,514
OK.

1055
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,255
All right. (LAUGHS)

1056
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:51,072
You're... You're intense today.
What's going on with you?

1057
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:53,475
- I gotta talk to you.
- I didn't think you meant that

1058
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:55,443
- when you said it.
- Well, I did.

1059
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:59,214
Well, I'm flattered.
What do you wanna talk about?

1060
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:02,317
- (LAUGHS)
- Um...

1061
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,019
So you were right.

1062
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:05,653
- About what, your girlfriend?
- No.

1063
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:08,456
I'm sorry.
I was right about what?

1064
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:11,559
- I stopped watching porn.
- Oh, yeah? That's great!

1065
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,194
- I don't know if it is.
- No, it is.

1066
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,530
I wasn't gonna stop,
but then I was thinking about

1067
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:19,467
what you asked me before,
if I ever jerk off

1068
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:22,437
without watching porn,
and I tried to...

1069
01:07:22,439 --> 01:07:26,441
- Yeah? And you couldn't?
- No, I couldn't.

1070
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:29,411
I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been
trying for a week, it's really fucked up.

1071
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:35,683
- Oh, my God! You haven't cum in a week?
- Mm...

1072
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:40,789
OK, wait. No. I want to
hear the rest of the story.

1073
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,627
- So you haven't watched porn in a week.
- Yeah.

1074
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:49,697
- That's good.
- What do you mean? You said you watched porn.

1075
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:53,435
Uh, yeah, but that movie
that I gave you was totally...

1076
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:55,403
- Did you ever watch it?
- No.

1077
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,273
OK. It's totally unlike the stuff
that I imagine you watch every day.

1078
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:01,109
- That is not healthy.
- What do you mean? How do you know?

1079
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:04,245
Oh, my God, please!
That stuff is ridiculous

1080
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:08,149
and it's nothing to do with actual sex.
That's why you have trouble with real women.

1081
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:12,454
- No, I get off fine with real girls.
- Yeah, you definitely do.

1082
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:15,757
Yeah, I just couldn't get off
beating it with my eyes closed.

1083
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:20,795
But didn't you tell me last week that
you like porn better than real sex?

1084
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:26,167
Well, honey, I'm gonna be honest with you,
'cause it seems like that's what you want.

1085
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:29,704
Look, the way you have sex,
it's like totally one-sided.

1086
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:32,540
It's like I'm not even there.

1087
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:36,211
I mean, look, it's fine with me.
I'm not complaining.

1088
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:38,847
It just so happens that meaningless sex
is something that I want in my life now,

1089
01:08:38,849 --> 01:08:42,550
but you said that you
wanna lose yourself in sex.

1090
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:46,821
If you wanna lose yourself, you have
to lose yourself in another person.

1091
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:51,593
And she has to lose herself
in you. It's a two-way thing.

1092
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,201
You know what?
I shouldn't have said that.

1093
01:09:00,203 --> 01:09:02,570
- No, it's fine.
- No, no, no. I'm sorry. I am.

1094
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:06,574
- What are you talking about?
- No. I'm really sorry.

1095
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,843
I'm... I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

1096
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:12,313
- You didn't. That's fine.
- No, I really didn't.

1097
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,851
You know what?

1098
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:18,920
Let's take a bath.

1099
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:23,191
- What? Nah!
- No, come on. It'll be nice. It'll be nice.

1100
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:26,427
Come on, let's take a bath.

1101
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,401
I'm gonna get you a towel.

1102
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,366
(SOBBING SOFTLY)

1103
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,706
Hey, where were you?

1104
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,342
I used one of the towels that was
in there, hope you don't mind.

1105
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:49,344
Yeah, that's fine.

1106
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:52,847
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1107
01:10:54,817 --> 01:11:00,722
- You don't live here alone, do you?
- I actually do.

1108
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:06,494
There's some kind of...
bad marriage situation here?

1109
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:09,297
