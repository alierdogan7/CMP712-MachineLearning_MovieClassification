Yeah, what's going on?

1196
01:23:20,544 --> 01:23:23,229
It's about a man
named Daniel Parmitt.

1197
01:23:26,984 --> 01:23:28,793
Oh, I don't know even
how to use this thing.

That's why I always get coffee.

1199
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,874
What...
What about Mr. Parmitt?

1200
01:23:34,584 --> 01:23:35,585
Do you know him?

1201
01:23:35,904 --> 01:23:37,588
Yeah, he's in town from Texas.

1202
01:23:37,664 --> 01:23:40,315
I, uh, I showed him
some places,

1203
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,746
and he turned out to
be a real time-waster.

1204
01:23:48,744 --> 01:23:50,864
I happened to be driving
past Sloan's Curve yesterday,

1205
01:23:50,904 --> 01:23:52,827
and I saw you
talking to someone.

1206
01:23:53,104 --> 01:23:54,754
Yep, that was him.

1207
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,628
I showed him a condo.

1208
01:23:57,704 --> 01:24:00,465
You think you can get the other list
of all the places you showed him?

1209
01:24:00,544 --> 01:24:02,672
Sure. I'd have to get
it from the office.

1210
01:24:02,784 --> 01:24:03,865
Why?

1211
01:24:04,584 --> 01:24:07,030
Well, if there's a vacant
place that he knows about...

1212
01:24:07,144 --> 01:24:08,225
(WHIMPERING) He may
just get it in his head

1213
01:24:08,304 --> 01:24:10,910
to make himself at home
for a while.

1214
01:24:12,384 --> 01:24:14,307
Shoot. Can you please
get that for me?

1215
01:24:14,944 --> 01:24:16,309
Oh, damn dog.

1218
01:24:32,104 --> 01:24:36,746

room with a fellow. The fellow went over

1219
01:24:36,824 --> 01:24:38,553
the balcony and he's dead now.

We assume Mr. Parmitt
was hurt pretty bad.

1224
01:24:48,864 --> 01:24:51,947
He ran out of the hotel, stole a car.
No one's seen him since.

1225
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,670
Well, I guess I can kiss
that commission goodbye.

1226

card in his room.

1227

1228
01:25:03,824 --> 01:25:05,667

give you the heads-up.

01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,511

all alone with him.

01:25:24,584 --> 01:25:26,552
I mean, he could've killed me.
