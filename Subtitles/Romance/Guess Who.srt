1
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,050
All right. Cut it.

2
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,450
All right. Hold it.

3
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,350
What is that idiot doin'?

4
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,050
What's that idiot doing?

5
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,850
-I just asked the same question.
-What's the answer?

6
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,250
I don't know.
I didn't tell him to--

7
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,650
Don't know?
Look, you're the director.

8
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,350
It was your idea to bring him
over here from lndia.

9
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,450
Now, you'd better start
telling him what to do...

10
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,650
or we're gonna be
out of business. Now, go ahead.

11
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,250
Come on.

12
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,950
-Charlie.
-Yeah?

13
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,550
You ready? Action!

14
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,250
Cut, damn it! Cut!

15
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,550
-Mr. Bakshi.
-Yes, sir.

16
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,050
Has it occurred to you...

17
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,950
that the period
of our picture is 1878?

18
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,850
Yes, indeed, sir.
I am well aware...

19
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,450
that that is the period
of the film. 1878.

20
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,350
Mr. Bakshi,
are you also aware...

21
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,650
that in 1878 they weren't
wearing underwater watches?

22
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,450
Yes, sir. I know that.
They had not even been invented.

23
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,350
You got the time?

24
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,250
Yes, it's...oh, my God.

25
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,350
All right.
Lunch everybody.

26
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,450
That's forty-two on the crew,
one hour for the cast.

27
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,650
OK, guys.
The cue for the demolition...

28
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,150
is when I lower my hand
like this, OK?

29
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,250
-Yes, sir.
-Guys, we got one shot at this.

30
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,250
Let's get it right.

31
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,350
OK, Kenny. Let's go.

32
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,650
All right. Places everybody.

33
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,850
Marty. Look, I just talked
to Clutterbuck on the phone.

34
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,850
He says if we don't wrap this
location today, it's your neck.

35
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,650
No problem. All we have left
is to blow up the fort.

36
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,150
OK. Great.

37
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,950
OK, Ken. Let's go.

38
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,350
All right. Carol. Earl.

39
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,650
All right. Stand by.

40
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,650
You.

41
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,850
Yes, you.

42
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,350
You get off of my set
and get out of my picture.

43
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,450
Off. Out. You're through.

44
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,350
You're washed up.
You're finished.

45
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,350
I'll see to it you never
make another movie again!

46
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,850
Does that include
television, sir?

47
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,950
I'll kill him !

48
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,250
Mr. Divot calling
from location on six.

49
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,450
All right.

50
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,050
Yeah, Charlie.

51
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,650
What?

52
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,150
The whole damn thing?

53
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,050
Well, how the hell could
a thing like that happen?

54
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,650
What's his name?

55
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,850
Spell it!

56
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,150
Hrundi V.

57
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:50,250
B-a-k-s-h-i.

58
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,350
I'll see to it he never
works again in this town.

59
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,850
Your wife called about
the guest list for the party.

60
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,350
Yeah, on the desk.
You know where to reach me.

61
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,250
I need an address
for Hrundi V. Bakshi.

62
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,350
B-a-k-s-h-i.

63
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,650
-= T H E   P A R T Y =-

64
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,250
Hello.

65
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,050
Vodka or scotch, sir?

66
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,950
No. I...

67
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,950
I never touch it.
Thank you.

68
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,650
Twenty-week layoff
that you've never seen--

69
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,950
No, thank you.

70
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,950
Hors d'oeuvres, sir?

71
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,150
Well, I'm on a diet,
but the hell with it.

72
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,850
-Pool.
-Pool.

73
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,950
-Pool is water, no?
-No, billiards.

74
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,150
Says the father,
"Oh, my goodness.

75
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,950
"We got the wrong baby,"
and the father says...

76
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,550
"Shh. It's a better buggy."

77
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,950
I never heard that one before.

78
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,250
Oh, yes. You...

79
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,650
I missed the middle part,
but I can tell from the way...

80
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,850
that you are
enjoying yourselves...

81
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,850
it must have been
a very humorous anecdote...

82
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,450
because the way
you are laughing...

83
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,050
just shows how much
you enjoyed it.

84
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,350
I love a good laugh, don't you?
It makes the world go round.

85
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:09,050
It's good to have a laugh.
Wonderful.

86
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,150
Very good.

87
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,350
I shall remember that one.

88
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,850
They were bound and gagged
for six hours.

89
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,450
They took everything...

90
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,550
even the gold watch
my daddy'd left me.

91
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,350
They took the gold watch
that your father left you?

92
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,950
I'm sorry.

93
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,550
It is utterly fantastic.

94
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,950
What a wonderful thing
for anyone to do.

95
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,150
Take everything,
including the father's watch.

96
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,250
It's wonderful.

97
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,450
I tell you, tonight
is one big round of laughter.

98
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,250
All fun and laughter.

99
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,850
The congressman
was just telling us...

100
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,450
about the time he was robbed.

101
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,050
Who's the foreigner?

102
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,250
I don't know.

103
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,050
Someone my mixed-up wife
invited.

104
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,350
Oh, dear.

105
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,950
Hello, dog.
What do you want?

106
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,650
What do you want, eh?
You like my feet, do you?

107
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,150
Have your fill, and away you go.

108
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,050
Feet are considered a delicacy
among certain animals.

109
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,050
Go on, you've had enough now.
Off. Chow!

110
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,850
In fact, there are
certain man-eating animals...

111
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,350
who will eat only the feet,
leave everything else.

112
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,650
Would not touch one other thing.

113
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,150
Get away. Down, now.
Chow, dog.

114
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,450
Get away.

115
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,050
Get away from me, dog.

116
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,250
Vodka or scotch, sir?

117
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,350
Get away.
No, thank you.

118
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,550
Get away.

119
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,350
Oh, good evening, Mr. Divot.
How are you?

120
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,950
How are ya?

121
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,650
Smile, baby.

122
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,950
Good evening, General.

123
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,850
I'd like to have you meet
Miss Michele Monet.

124
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,650
Mr. Clutterbuck,
Mrs. Clutterbuck.

125
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,950
How are ya, Alice?

126
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,450
I'll introduce my guests,
if I may.

127
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,850
Here, Mrs. Dunphy.

128
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,550
I've heard some wonderful things
about you.

129
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,850
Well, sir, you seem to have
a wonderful party going here.

130
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,950
-How do you like it so far?
-Fine.

131
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,050
Have a drink. Go ahead.

132
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,750
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

133
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,750
And good evening.

134
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,150
Good evening.

135
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,950
What a beautiful evening it is.

136
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,250
To be sure.

137
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,050
What's in there?

138
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,850
What, in here?

139
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,950
Oh, there is nothing in there.

140
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,350
Yes, there is.

141
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,950
I don't know.
I don't think so.

142
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,750
-Let's see now. No.
-Don't you see it?

143
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,650
No, there is definitely
nothing in there.

144
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,550
If there were something,
it's gone away now, anyway.

145
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,250
Well, I can see it.

146
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,850
What is it?

147
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,550
I don't know,
but I don't like it.

148
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,550
Pardon me, sir.

149
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,050
It's quite all right, fella.

150
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,050
I'm so sorry.
I beg your pardon.

151
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,650
Come on over here, honey.
We'll...try it over here.

152
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,450
Right here, on the corner.
This is an easy shot now.

153
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,550
First things first.
Get in the saddle.

154
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,850
Just like I taught you,
that's it.

155
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,250
No, I feel silly because--

156
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,850
Oh, no, hon,
you can do it this way.

157
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,350
I was here the other day.

158
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,250
Now, just relax, and you--

159
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,650
Just relax. Just--

160
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,150
Pay no attention to me, sir.
I am merely spectating.

161
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,650
Oh. Fine.

162
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,850
I can see that you are
an experienced player.

163
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,350
One of the best, feller.

164
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,950
Sir, excuse me.

165
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,550
What is the name of a game...

166
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,150
that has a multitude
of colored balls like that?

167
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,650
-Pool.
-Poo?

168
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,050
-What?
-Poo?

169
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,850
No, not poo. Pool.

170
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,450
-Pool!
-Pool.

171
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,450
-Oh, like swimming pool.
-You got it, honey.

172
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,150
I never heard of
a game called poo.

173
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,450
Fine game.

174
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,950
And so,
what is the object of it--

175
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,950
to disperse these colored balls
strategically around the table?

176
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,550
Get the balls in the holes.
All except for the white one.

177
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,050
Oh, that is the art?

178
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,650
The art is not
to have the white one in?

179
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,850
-Right.
-Good.

180
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,150
And how many people can play?
One, two, three, or what?

181
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,250
Oh, whole bunches,
or twos and threes.

182
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,850
With a group--
groups of people can play.

183
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,250
By yourself. Yes.

184
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,950
Thank goodness.
How wonderful.

185
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,550
Keep your eye
on the white ball--

186
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,650
Oh, excuse me.

187
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,450
Excuse me, sir, but...

188
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,150
you are, are you not...

189
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,450
Wyoming Bill Kelso,
the famous film star?

190
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,250
That's me, in the flesh.

191
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,450
Oh, God,
what a moment in my life.

192
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,250
Oh, sir, I've seen
every one of your films.

193
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,050
Oh, well, that's wonderful!

194
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,050
What a wonderful,
strong grip you've got.

195
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,250
Yes, I do.

196
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,850
My goodness, I would
have been disappointed...

197
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,350
if you hadn't crushed my hand.

198
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,650
Oh, listen.
Will you do me the honor...

199
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,950
to sign me an autograph?

200
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,650
Oh, sure. Here, hold this.
I'll be glad to.

201
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,350
I am also in the acting
profession, you know.

202
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,350
-Oh, you are?
-Yes, indeed.

203
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,450
I am not in your quality,
but I was around.

204
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,450
Well, what's your name?

205
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,150
Hrundi. H-r-u-n-d-i.

206
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,950
Wait till I tell them
at home that I met him.

207
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,050
They'll never believe me.

208
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,050
-Where you from?
-I am from lndia.

209
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,950
Got you covered, lnjun!

210
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,550
How do you--
Bang! Howdy, pardner.

211
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,150
Well, I'm pretty quick
on the draw there, right?

212
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,550
Never I believe
in all my whole life...

213
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,050
I would meet him, and he
would go, "Bang, pardner!"

214
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,350
Listen to me.

215
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,250
"White man speak
with, uh, forked tongue!"

216
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,050
And look, mmm-mmm...

217
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,950
You old horned toad, buddy!

218
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,350
Cute little feller, isn't he?

219
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,850
I know all your sayings.
I know all of them.

220
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,950
Good. Hrundi, say hello--

221
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,350
The one where you walk along,
and then you go--

222
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,450
Hrundi, say hello
to Signorina here.

223
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,050
Hello, partner.

224
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,350
Piacere.

225
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,950
Bakshi.

226
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,150
-There you go.
-Oh, thank you.

227
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,950
This is a wonderful thing
you have done for me.

228
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,150
My pleasure.

229
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,250
Thank you, and I will--
thank you.

230
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,350
I would love to say
that it has been...

231
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,550
the greatest moment in my life.

232
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,350
Bang! Aha, got you!
I was quick on the draw.

233
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,350
You beat me that time, pal.
That's right.

234
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,450
-Goodness me.
-Lots of luck to you.

235
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,150
And the same to you, sir.

236
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,250
Howdy, pardner!

237
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,550
That was so groovy.

238
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,550
-That was a short dance.
-That's right.

239
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,050
And they don't go on
for long, do they?

240
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,550
-No, they don't.
-Yes, we just started, and--

241
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,850
Well, anyway,
thank you very much.

242
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,050
Thank you.

243
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,450
Perhaps we can
dance again later.

244
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,950
If your carnet du bal
is not full up.

245
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,650
Oh, I'd love to.
Thank you.

246
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,350
What is that ring
on your finger, chopped liver?

247
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,450
Hello, Polly.

248
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,150
Pretty one.

249
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,950
Hello.

250
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,550
Would you like--

251
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,650
Would you like
some food, Polly?

252
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,550
Pretty Polly.

253
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,850
Where is the--oh.

254
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,250
Birdie num num.

255
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,650
-Hello.
-Birdie num num.

256
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,950
Have birdie num num.

257
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,450
-Go on.
-There were four of us.

258
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,350
Four, yes.

259
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,650
I'll give you a num num.

260
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,950
He's having
the birdie num nums.

261
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,850
Sure, look.
He's waiting for more num num.

262
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,450
All gone.
Num num is gone.

263
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,950
Pretty Polly.

264
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,250
Num-num.

265
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,250
Birdie num-num.

266
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,850
What in the world is that?

267
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,150
I can't imagine.

268
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,850
Howdy, partner.

269
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,350
What is that?!

270
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,050
What is that?

271
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,450
Would you mind getting--

272
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,550
This is 469-6151.

273
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,650
Please remain connected
to the telephone.

274
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,150
There is a call for you, sir.

275
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,150
Please hold on
to the connection.

276
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,350
Please, one second.

277
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,850
I wonder if you could--

278
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,350
Let me hold here.

279
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,350
Could you just let my hand go?

280
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,950
You've got my hand.
Thank you.

281
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,450
Now I take this from you.

282
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,050
Hold on one moment.

283
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,050
Oh. Excuse the mess up here.
It is birdie num-nums.

284
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,250
Put them under my feet.

285
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,550
Look. Just one second.

286
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,950
If you can take this
around you...

287
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,350
Just lift the ashtray, please.

288
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,950
You're--you--

289
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,350
Yes. Thank you.

290
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,350
Oh, Benny.

291
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,350
Yeah, well,
I'm having a few people in.

292
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,050
The picture?

293
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,250
It was going fine until
some idiot blew up the set.

294
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,750
Vodka or scotch, sir?

295
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,850
No, nothing, thank you.

296
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,050
This picture's a very good one.

297
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,850
-Is it?
-It's gonna be great.

298
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,850
-Caviar?
-No, thank you.

299
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,850
-Sir?
-I don't think so. Thanks.

300
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,350
Eat, eh?

301
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,150
Oh, eat.

302
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,450
Sure, honey, we're gonna eat...

303
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,150
but they gotta ring
the little bell first.

304
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,550
Bell?

305
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,150
Bell. Dingy dingy.

306
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,850
Ding?

307
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,650
But first, let's have
a little tiddly at the bar.

308
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,150
-Hello.
-Oh, howdy, little buddy.

309
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,850
That's my old cowboy crusher.
Injun grip.

310
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,250
Oh, you really crushed
my old lndian hand.

311
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,850
Sorta smarts, don't it?

312
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,850
Friendliest little critter
I ever met.

313
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,450
It's an honor to have
had my hand crushed...

314
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,050
by Wyoming Bill Kelso.

315
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,550
Wait till I tell them back home.

316
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,250
Can't...

317
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,250
Pardon me.

318
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,550
It's OK.

319
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,750
Hello.

320
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,950
Hello.

321
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,150
Oh, it was occupied.

322
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:52,250
-Hrundi V. Bakshi.
-Pardon?

323
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,650
That is what my name is called.

324
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,550
Oh! Michele Monet.

325
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,450
Oh, how do you do?

326
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,850
Are you having a good time?

327
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,050
Good.

328
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,450
Are you having a good time?

329
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,550
Oh, yes.
I am having a good time.

330
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,150
It's good to be
having a good time.

331
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,250
You're an actress?

332
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,050
Oh, yes. I can tell.

333
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,250
Oh? How?

334
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,850
Because I am an actor.

335
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:27,050
Actors can tell when
actresses are actresses.

336
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,450
It is a thing
that we have together.

337
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,950
You are also French.
I know that.

338
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,950
-How do you know that?
-Well, your name...

339
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,450
and also the way you
are speaking English.

340
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,450
Oh, that's right.
Do you speak French?

341
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,550
Well, just enough
to get myself into trouble.

342
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,350
I'll tell you what I can say.

343
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,450
Ou est la direction
de la Tour Eiffel...

344
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,950
s'il vous plait?

345
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,150
-That's pretty good.
-Thanks.

346
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,050
-You do speak French.
-You speak Hindustani?

347
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,350
Well, you're not
missing anything.

348
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,850
Oh, dear.

349
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,450
I am here at the moment
taking part...

350
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,350
in Mr. General Clutterbuck's...

351
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,450
Iatest motion picture
extravaganza.

352
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,950
Oh, that's wonderful.

353
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,150
It is a main featured role...

354
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,550
and I am very glad
to have the opportunity...

355
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,150
to come here and do it.

356
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,250
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

357
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,850
You are doing something
in a movie?

358
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,550
Working on a movie?

359
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,050
But next week I'm doing
a test for Mr. Divot.

360
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,450
Oh, Mr. Divot.

361
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,650
-What?
-Oh, listen, l--

362
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,150
OK, let's get to the bar.

363
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,550
-Mr. Divot, how do you do?
-Yeah, right, fella.

364
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,650
Good-bye.

365
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,250
Who is that guy?

366
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,450
A very nice man...

367
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,950
with a completely
unpronounceable name.

368
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,450
I know him from someplace.
Well, how are you, General?

369
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,850
Remember
Miss Michele Monet here?

370
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,850
Have you heard her sing yet?
We're giving her a test.

371
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,050
She sings like a bird--
a nightingale.

372
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,250
Fine. I'll look forward to that.

373
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,450
We're going over to the bar
to have a little nippy.

374
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,250
-Dinner is served.
-Good.

375
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,350
Dinner is served.

376
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,250
Alice, do you know
where Miss Monet is sitting?

377
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,050
Right around here, dear.

378
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,250
Excuse me for a minute,
sweetheart.

379
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:13,550
Dear.
I believe you're over there.

380
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,950
Right down there.

381
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,350
Here. Bakshi, right?

382
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,550
Oh, yes. Mr. Bakshi.

383
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,150
There's no chair.

384
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,350
Oh, Mrs. Clutterbuck,
everybody needs to move over.

385
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,350
Darling, would you mind
moving up just one?

386
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:57,850
Hey, fella! I believe
you've got my tiddly, there.

387
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,950
I'm sorry, darling.

388
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,550
You're gonna have to move back.
A mistake.

389
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,850
I'm awfully sorry.

390
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,950
Levinson, will you get
the gentleman a chair?

391
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,950
No, it was a mistake.

392
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,950
He's going to bring you a chair,
and then you'll be all right.

393
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,450
All right? Good.

394
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,650
My goodness! What happened
to your little face?

395
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,950
Nothing, except that it is...

396
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,350
somewhat nearer
to the table now.

397
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,050
My chair is lower
than your chair.

398
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,150
Do you like the strawberry soup?

399
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,150
Oh, strawberry soup.
I haven't had it lately.

400
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,050
Lovely in the summer,
don't you think?

401
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,250
Yes, it's--oh.

402
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,050
It's lovely right now.

403
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,050
Good. I'm so glad.

404
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,550
Hey, give me some of that,
will you, pal?

405
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,550
How's the chow?

406
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,650
It's excellent.

407
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,350
No wine, please.

408
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,150
Please, no wine.

409
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,250
I know you would
like me to have it...

410
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,850
but I don't want it.

411
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:44,550
All right. I don't drink.
I don't smoke. No wine.

412
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,450
Are you all right?

413
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,950
I'm so sorry.

414
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,350
Yes, I will be
perfectly all right.

415
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,550
I won't be in anybody's way.

416
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,150
Now, you're sure
you're comfortable?

417
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,850
Absolutely. I'm getting
out of the way here...

418
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,550
then the door won't bang me.

419
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,050
All right. Excuse me.

420
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,350
They should be finished
with the soup by now.

421
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,050
Get the plates.

422
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,350
Mrs. Clutterbuck...
shall I serve the salad?

423
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,350
Excuse me, what are you doing?!

424
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,050
Get in the kitchen.

425
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,350
That is just outside Bombay.

426
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,850
And Bombay is in lndia?

427
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,250
Oh, that is very much
in lndia, yes, indeed.

428
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,850
And that is indeed
the gateway to lndia.

429
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,050
When all--

430
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,650
I think that one
of these bearers...

431
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,550
does not like
the other one.

432
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,650
You have a very hard time
finding good help these days.

433
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,850
Yes, you certainly do.

434
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,650
Did you ever hear the one
about the trapeze artist...

435
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:21,950
who got divorced?

436
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,350
Caught his wife in the act.

437
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,350
That's terribly funny.

438
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,350
Yeah, it's been terribly funny
for about twenty years.

439
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,950
Please, no more drinking.

440
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,650
Gore, are you sure
it's all right?

441
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,850
It's not all right.
It's divine.

442
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:03,350
You are too kind.

443
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,950
If you want to keep
the women's vote...

444
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,950
you've got to start
with education.

445
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,350
That's where
you spend the most--

446
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,950
Oh, Mrs. Clutterbuck.

447
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,850
Please, can I take
this opportunity...

448
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,450
to apologize to you formally...

449
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,250
for what happened
at the dining room table.

450
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,050
Oh, my dear, just forget it.
It wasn't your fault.

451
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,450
Thank God.
What embarrassment.

452
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:29,650
Oh, I know.

453
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,850
It was that ridiculous
little chair they put you on.

454
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,550
It was awful,
but at the same time...

455
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,850
I feel that it is my
duty to say this to you.

456
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,550
I just think we should all
forget all about it.

457
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,650
Indeed, you are right...

458
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,350
but before that I would
also go to your husband...

459
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,150
and say to him that I'm sorry.

460
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,550
Oh, that's not necessary.
Really.

461
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,850
It's on my conscience.

462
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,950
Well, if you want to, go ahead.

463
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,950
-Thank you.
-All right.

464
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,550
It's a wonderful story.

465
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:13,450
General, excellent aroma.

466
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,350
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

467
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,550
I still have a few left over
from the pre-Castro days.

468
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,150
General Clutterbuck.

469
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:22,250
Sir.

470
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,250
Please, I would like
to formally apologize to you...

471
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,250
for any inconvenience
that I may have caused you...

472
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,250
or your guests
at the dining room table.

473
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,850
It's understandable.

474
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,250
I'm very sorry, and it
will never happen again...

475
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,450
should you wish to have me
on your list of guests...

476
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:37,650
on some other occasion.

477
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:38,950
It's all right.

478
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,550
When I saw what havoc
that I wrought...

479
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,850
my poor old knees went to water.

480
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,450
-God, what a state I was in.
-Yes, I can imagine.

481
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,150
But now that I have
apologized to you--

482
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,350
It's all right.

483
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,950
Spoken to your good lady,
and I've told her, sir...

484
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,250
that it is a terrible thing
to have happened...

485
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,850
and I'm sorry.

486
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:57,050
-Deep down inside.
-Enjoy yourself.

487
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,250
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

488
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,550
Thank you for listening to me.

489
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,550
It's all right.

490
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,150
General, about this Wac.

491
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,050
I asked her to go out
with me one night.

492
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,350
A Wac?

493
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,050
She was a buck sergeant, too.

494
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:11,450
We were going down Manila Bay.

495
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,550
Brandy or creme de cocoa, sir?

496
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,450
Oh, beg your pardon.

497
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,650
It's all right.

498
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,850
It is occupied.

499
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,150
Speak Hindustani?

500
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,950
Oh, excuse me, please.

501
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,650
Hey, close the door, man.

502
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,350
Look, I told the General
you were gonna sing.

503
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,450
Well, I'd rather not
do it tonight.

504
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,150
Why not?

505
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,350
The orchestra is gone.

506
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:05,350
Well, there's a guitar.
You play the guitar?

507
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,650
All right, then you play
the guitar and you sing.

508
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:07,950
That's all, honey.

509
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,450
Hey, waiter, come over here.

510
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:12,950
Look, you're gonna be a smash.
Don't worry about a thing.

511
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,250
Come here.

512
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:17,350
See that guitar?
Go get it.

513
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,150
Get the guitar.

514
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:12,250
Nothing to lose

515
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:16,250
If we are wise

516
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:25,450
We're not expecting
rainbow-colored skies

517
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,350
Not right away

518
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:38,350
Nothing to lose,
it might be fun

519
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:46,750
No talk of spending
lifetimes in the sun

520
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:50,650
Although we may

521
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:59,150
Both you and I have seen
what time can do

522
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,250
We'll only hurt ourselves

523
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:10,050
If we build dreams
that don't come true

524
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,850
What can we lose?

525
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,850
We know the score

526
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:20,950
Let's wait before we talk

527
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:25,250
Of evermore

528
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:29,650
One day we may

529
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:35,050
Nothing to lose,
but much to gain

530
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:42,450
If love decides to stay

531
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:55,450
Both you and I have seen
what time can do

532
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:58,650
We'll only hurt ourselves

533
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:05,150
If we build dreams
that don't come true

534
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:09,150
What can we lose?

535
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:13,450
We know the score

536
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:17,050
Let's wait before we talk

537
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:21,650
Of evermore

538
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:26,550
One day we may

539
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:30,650
Nothing to lose,
but much to gain

540
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:38,850
If love decides to stay

541
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:43,150
Nothing to lose

542
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:45,450
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

543
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,050
Well, how do you like her,
General?

544
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,050
-All right. Very good.
-How do you like her, Bernie?

545
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,550
She's great!

546
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:07,050
I think she's really great.

547
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,450
Hi.

548
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,050
All right, you win, partner.

549
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,950
I'm telling you, he loved you.
He thought you were terrific.

550
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,450
We talked about it after
you finished the number.

551
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,050
He was very impressed.

552
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:38,950
He thought you were
beautiful, you know?

553
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:40,950
So tomorrow will be
just a formality, the test.

554
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:43,450
We want to see what you
look like on film, that's all.

555
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,450
Trust me.
Will you just trust me?

556
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:47,050
Here, we can talk.
It's a little quieter in here.

557
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:49,050
Oh, Charlie,
this is the bedroom.

558
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:51,150
Oh, this is the bedroom.

559
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,550
Come on,
let's sit over there, baby.

560
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,450
-I wanna tell you something.
-Why don't we go downstairs?

561
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,850
Too much noise downstairs.
Let's just sit on the bed. Sit.

562
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,350
Look, why do you think
I brought you to the party?

563
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:01,450
Let's sit down. That's it.
That's a good girl.

564
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:04,350
It's what I brought you
to the party for.

565
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:05,950
Just one little kiss.

566
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:07,950
Don't do that.
Let's go. Charlie!

567
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:13,850
-Give me my gun.
-Thank you, partner.

568
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,150
Where you going?

569
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,850
Attention!

570
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,350
Oh, God.

571
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:23,050
Just forget it.

572
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:32,150
Knock it off and hit the sack!

573
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:42,350
Cookie!

574
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:14,650
Wait.

575
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:20,950
Who's in the head?

576
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,350
Help! Somebody!

577
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:21,050
Help, anybody!

578
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:24,350
Please, come and help me.
Somebody's in the pool.

579
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:25,750
Honey, what can I do for you?

580
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:28,150
-Hurry up, please. It's--
-Oh, hey, little buddy!

581
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,150
American aid, partner.

582
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:32,250
Great night for a dip.
You know that little fella...

583
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:35,450
just has a heap of talent
wherever he goes.

584
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:37,350
He's drowning?
Buddy, you drowning?

585
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:41,350
Great leapin' pollywogs,
that little gal can swim !

586
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,550
Get him, gal!
Grab him by the wigwam !

587
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:46,050
I'll wait right here for ya!

588
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:49,350
Come on, honey,
bring him over here.

589
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:51,350
Get ahold of him.
Get out of there.

590
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:53,950
Here we go.
Come on, little buddy.

591
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,550
Bartender, we've been fishin'.

592
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:13,850
Caught ourselves
a little lnjun here.

593
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,050
Oh, God, he's gonna catch
a death of cold.

594
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:17,550
Oh, no, I don't drink.

595
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:19,450
Come on. Good, just a little.

596
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:22,250
There we go.
Right down the old hatch.

597
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:25,150
There you go, that'll
straighten you right out.

598
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,150
You'll feel better, huh?

599
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,650
-But I don't drink.
-You need a little more.

600
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,150
There you go, huh?

601
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,350
That straighten you out
all right?

602
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:32,650
How 'bout a little more?

603
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:33,850
No, I'm perfectly all right now.

604
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:35,550
All right, good.

605
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:37,050
Oh, up! Got him.

606
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:38,650
Looks like little buddy
went bye-bye.

607
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,450
Get ahold of him, Bill.
You got him?

608
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:44,050
Hang on, here we go!

609
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:46,350
Poor darling, I'm so sorry.

610
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:48,250
You stay there and, well,
I don't know what we can do.

611
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,450
But perhaps we can
at least dry it out for you.

612
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:53,750
Oh, dear, honestly.

613
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:56,450
Come in!

614
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:57,950
This tie looks like
a salamander's tongue...

615
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:00,550
that got stepped on.
Oh, hiya, honey.

616
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:02,050
Is he all right?

617
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,050
Oh, he's all right.
He's just a little wet.

618
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,650
You got some dry duds
we can put on him?

619
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:06,150
Oh, surely, yes.
I'll get something of Fred's.

620
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,450
I sure would appreciate that.

621
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:11,250
Here, darling, put this on him.

622
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,150
Oh, thank you
very much, ma'am.

623
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:17,350
I love the wet clothes!
Thank you for a marvelous party!

624
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,650
Let's go, buddy.

625
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,950
Fred, darling, I had
to loan him your terry.

626
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:25,250
He's soaking wet.
This is hers, not his.

627
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:26,950
Oh, and, darling, do hurry

628
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,950
because the Russians
will be here any minute!

629
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,250
The Russians?

630
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,650
The dancers, darling,
the ballet.

631
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:40,450
Come on, sidekick.

632
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:45,850
Now, what's--
Kelso, would you mind?

633
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,050
What are you doing up there?

634
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:49,350
-I am not doing anything.
-You're wetting the bed.

635
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,350
-I'm not wetting the bed.
-Yes, you are. It's wet.

636
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,550
My clothes are wetting the bed.
I am not wetting the bed.

637
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,150
This is the big chief here.

638
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,650
Oh, big chief speak
with forked tongue.

639
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,950
Try to get his clothes off.

640
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:04,650
I'll hold him, boss.
You get his pants down.

641
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,150
All right, come here.
Don't do that, no.

642
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:07,950
Come here, lovely man.
I love you!

643
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:09,950
I got something dry over here.

644
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:13,050
Listen, you take off--

645
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:15,250
Hey, he invited me.

646
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,250
We'll take off your clothes,
and you take off...

647
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:22,350
Have you got him?

648
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:23,950
Loosen his belt, Kelso.

649
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:25,850
I'm trying, sir.

650
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,950
For crying out loud,
let's get 'em off.

651
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:32,650
Get up off the floor.

652
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:35,050
I got him !
Come on there!

653
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,050
Oh, you naughty boy.

654
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:42,850
Now, here, put this on.
Put these on.

655
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:43,950
Wait!

656
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,350
Come on now.
Can you handle it?

657
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:48,850
-I have to go downstairs.
-All right. I'll handle it.

658
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,250
Partner, why do you want--

659
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,550
Little sidekick,
put these dry clothes on.

660
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:55,250
All right, I will put them on.
And then I'll--

661
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,550
Good idea.
I gotta get downstairs...

662
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,850
before Conchita cools off.

663
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,450
You come downstairs
with wet clothes on...

664
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,850
I'm gonna stomp you
and the horse you ride in on.

665
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:05,050
You got that?

666
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:07,050
Tongue buddy, partner buddy.

667
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,850
I'll see ya, little buddy.

668
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:13,050
Oh, you got me right
in the pantaloons, partner.

669
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:15,050
Adios!

670
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:17,550
Hold on, Conchita!
I'm comin'!

671
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:19,650
Adios, partner.

672
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:25,150
I do like these Americans.

673
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,150
They really are...

674
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,550
Hello.

675
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:13,550
Hello.

676
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:15,850
You're having some difficulty?

677
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:21,150
You sure?

678
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:29,150
Well. Excuse me.

679
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:43,350
You know that I don't think...

680
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:46,250
you're being
entirely honest with me?

681
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:03,150
We have a saying in lndia.

682
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:12,850
Well?

683
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:15,150
Well, what?

684
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:25,250
You were saying
something about a saying.

685
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:32,250
What is it?

686
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:39,850
"Wisdom...

687
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:43,150
"is the province of the aged...

688
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:47,250
"but the heart of a child
is pure."

689
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,050
That's very pretty.

690
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,250
I'm not sure I know
what it means.

691
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:59,950
Neither do l.

692
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:06,150
What does it have
to do with me?

693
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:09,150
Well, it has everything
to do with you.

694
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,550
For one thing, you see,
it stopped you crying.

695
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,950
It's true.
I feel better.

696
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:15,450
Thank you very much.

697
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,450
Don't thank me.
Thank my saying.

698
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:19,850
Thank you, saying.

699
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:23,650
Do you want to hear
another one of my sayings?

700
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:25,050
This is
a particularly good one...

701
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:27,150
because it will help you
always to remember...

702
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:29,250
how many days there are
in each month.

703
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,850
It goes like this:
"Thirty days hath September...

704
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:33,850
"October, June, and February.

705
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:35,950
"All the rest got twenty-nine...

706
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:39,050
"except my brother
who got six months."

707
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:47,150
Just what I thought.

708
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:48,950
I've been looking
all over for ya.

709
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:51,050
Go get your clothes,
we're gonna leave.

710
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:52,650
Oh, I don't think so.

711
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,250
Look, you came with me,
you're gonna leave with me.

712
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:56,250
Now get your clothes.

713
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,350
No.

714
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:59,650
Don't say no to me.
Now get your stuff.

715
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,950
-Go on!
-Mr. Divot, please--

716
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,050
Look, will you stay
out of this, buddy.

717
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:06,350
If Miss Monet wishes to remain,
that is her right.

718
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:07,950
Just who do you think you are?

719
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:09,650
In lndia, we don't
think who we are...

720
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:10,850
we know who we are.

721
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:12,050
You're meshugah!

722
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:13,650
I am not your sugar.

723
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:16,450
OK, look, baby, you decide.

724
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:18,450
You wanna come with me,
or you wanna stay with this guy?

725
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,650
I want to stay.

726
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,250
You're gonna stay with him, huh?

727
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,150
Nobody ever does this to me!

728
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,450
You hear that?

729
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:28,050
And forget about
that test tomorrow, baby.

730
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:30,250
You're finished in this business
before you even start!

731
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:32,050
You're wiped out!
You're finished!

732
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:41,050
That was a short career,
wasn't it?

733
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:43,550
Oh, don't worry about that.

734
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:49,150
I better find something
to put on and call a cab.

735
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,150
No, don't call a cab.

736
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:52,550
Stay at the party and after...

737
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:55,050
I'll take you home
in my three-wheeler Morgan.

738
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,250
No, that would be nice,
but I can't stay.

739
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,550
Why not?

740
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:02,950
I got myself into
a funny situation.

741
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:05,850
What, with old Divot?

742
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,950
Is that why you were crying?

743
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,150
Yes, but it's
not really his fault.

744
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,350
He's a terrible man.

745
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:14,450
Please, stay at the party.
Let's have a wonderful time.

746
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:17,250
I'd love to, really,
but I have nothing to wear.

747
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:20,150
That's no problem. They have
millions of clothes here.

748
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:23,250
And anyway...l've got an idea.

749
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,450
Who goes there?

750
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:33,050
Mr. Bakshi
and a damsel in distress.

751
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:34,850
What do you want?

752
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:37,250
You look like
a man of the world.

753
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:40,350
This poor lady is urgently
in need of some dry clothing.

754
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:43,450
And I perceive that you are both
approximately the same size.

755
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:17,250
Marvelous! Just marvelous!

756
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,150
Everyone, let's have a toast
for our wonderful friends.

757
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:52,550
Fred, we need to move the bar.

758
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,550
Oh, I know how to do that.
I'll do that for you.

759
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,650
Oh, no, I'd rather do it myself.

760
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:58,650
Fred, stop him.

761
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:55,650
Come on, it's fine.

762
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:57,150
Molly, are you sure
it's all right?

763
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,650
Yes, will you please come?
It's fine!

764
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,150
But your mother's
having a party.

765
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,650
Can you think of a better time
to shake 'em up?

766
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:05,150
You've done some pretty stupid
things in your life, but this--

767
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,850
Wow! What a house!

768
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:26,550
Hi.

769
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:38,350
-Hello, Mom.
-Oh, darling!

770
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:39,950
I thought you were
out protesting.

771
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:42,150
No, it's a love-in. I wanted you
to meet some of my friends.

772
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,050
I can't now, darling.
I've got all these wet Russians.

773
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,550
But I'll come back,
and I'll meet your friends.

774
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:51,450
Oh, there they are over there.

775
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:02,350
General, your wife
just fell in the pool.

776
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:04,050
Get her jewelry.

777
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,450
Molly, what was that?

778
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:09,850
An elephant.

779
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:14,050
An elephant?! Oh, my God!

780
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:17,150
Molly, how could you do this?
This is perfectly dreadful!

781
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:18,950
Well, I didn't mean
to offend you.

782
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,050
Now, listen here, young lady...

783
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:21,850
you get that elephant
out of this house!

784
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:24,950
Yes. Oh, Mother!

785
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:37,450
-Hello.
-Hello.

786
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:37,950
How are you?

787
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:39,150
I'm all right.
Is this your elephant?

788
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,450
Yeah. This is Jongo.

789
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:42,950
You've done a proper old
paint job on this, haven't you?

790
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,050
What's wrong with it?

791
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:45,350
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

792
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,050
-Why?
-This is a symbol of my country.

793
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:48,650
Don't you paint them in lndia?

794
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:52,050
Yes, but we don't
paint slogans all over them.

795
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:54,150
Look, he has got "the world
is flat" on his forehead...

796
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,950
"Socrates eats hemlock"
on the side...

797
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,150
and "go naked" all over his bum.

798
01:24:58,150 --> 01:24:59,450
I'm terribly sorry.

799
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:01,150
We didn't mean
to be disrespectful.

800
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:03,350
I know, but it's humiliating.
They know, you know.

801
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:05,150
I mean, how would you
like it if an lndian person...

802
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:07,250
such as myself
came along and drew...

803
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:09,350
a mustache and a beard
on your Lady Bird.

804
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,250
It's the same thing, isn't it?

805
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,350
I'm awfully sorry.
What do you suggest we do?

806
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:15,450
-Get some water and wash it off.
-Wash it?

807
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:17,050
Wash it, scrub it, get it off.

808
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:18,850
Hey, gang!

809
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:20,550
We're gonna wash the elephant.

810
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:22,950
What do you mean
wash the elephant?

811
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:56,250
All right! That's it! Get out!

812
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:16,450
Wash it off!
Get it all off!

813
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:18,550
Bakshi!

814
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:23,350
I knew I knew that guy!

815
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:25,250
I knew it!

816
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:35,450
Hello?
Buggercult--I--

817
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,350
I wanna talk to the General.
This is C.S. Divot.

818
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:41,950
No! You cannot--

819
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,850
What's going on there?

820
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:50,650
Paint on the ear.

821
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:57,050
Do you believe that child of
mine bringing home an elephant?

822
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:58,950
-Dirty.
-Oh, really!

823
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:04,250
All right, that got it!

824
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:07,150
That's enough.
We take him outside now.

825
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:09,950
And wash all the soap off.

826
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:37,350
Oh, what do you suppose
that awful racket is?

827
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:38,850
-I'll be right back.
-Darling, I'm not finished.

828
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:42,050
I've got to see. God only knows
what's happening now.

829
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:51,550
Mom, what are you doing?

830
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:58,650
You and me gotta find
someplace to be alone.

831
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:05,550
Wells, save the paintings!

832
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:18,950
Oh, Mom, are you all right?

833
01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:30,950
Get the paintings!
Don't stand there!

834
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:41,550
I should never, ever
in all my life...

835
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:05,050
Not that one, you idiot!
Just the good stuff.

836
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:06,250
Put it back.

837
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:06,350
We gotta get this
stuff out of here.

838
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:08,850
-Turn on the air conditioner.
-I'll never make it.

839
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:10,250
There's a control
in the master bedroom.

840
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:12,350
-Go get it on.
-Yes, sir.

841
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:12,150
Just a minute, sir.

842
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:14,150
Hey, look, I'm C.S. Divot,
the producer.

843
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:15,450
I'm a friend
of Mr. Clutterbuck's.

844
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:16,650
I gotta tell him something
right away.

845
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,750
Divot, C.S.?

846
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:19,150
That's right, buddy.
Thanks. Divot.

847
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:21,950
Hey, what's with
the ambulance here?

848
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:28,950
Honey, let's go stroll
in the straw, huh?

849
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:30,850
You're a little late, mac.

850
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:33,550
What the hell is
going on around here?

851
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:38,450
Do you believe it?
The party isn't over!

852
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:39,650
Hey, General!

853
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:41,350
I don't even know how
the hell it got started.

854
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:44,350
We gotta put something
in our report.

855
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:46,550
General, I gotta
tell you something.

856
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:48,150
It was crazy. You should've--

857
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:49,650
Alice, baby,
are you all right?

858
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:51,650
Do you feel better?

859
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:53,950
Oh, I'm fine! I'm going
to be in the aquacade.

860
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:56,350
That's nice.
Don't drop her.

861
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,650
Congressman, Mrs. Dunphy...

862
01:33:57,850 --> 01:34:00,450
I don't know how to tell you--

863
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,850
It's quite all right.

864
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:04,050
Call me if there's
anything I can do.

865
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:14,650
Mr. Clutterbuck...

866
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:18,350
May I apologize to you
for the discomfort--

867
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:19,650
It's all right.

868
01:34:19,650 --> 01:34:21,050
General, it's him !

869
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:23,250
-Who?
-Bakshi!

870
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,650
The idiot
who blew up the location!

871
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:29,150
General, you got the wrong guy!

872
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:38,250
Hey, little buddy,
hold on a minute.

873
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,950
Here's one of my old Stetsons.

874
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:41,650
Look at that. It just fits.

875
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,850
And here's an autographed
picture of me and my horse Fang.

876
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:36,550
This is where I live.

877
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:38,550
You have a beautiful home.

878
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:44,150
I would ask you to come up,
but it's a little late.

879
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,250
Or early. I don't know.

880
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:50,950
Anyway, I have to
get back to feed Apu.

881
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:53,250
-Apu?
-Yes, my monkey.

882
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:56,250
Oh. It's a lovely name.

883
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:59,250
For a monkey, anyway.

884
01:35:59,350 --> 01:36:01,650
-He's used to it by now, anyway.
-Oh, good.

885
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:07,450
I would like to say that...

886
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:09,350
I enjoyed myself
very much last night.

887
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:11,950
I did, too, very much.

888
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:15,150
Especially I thought that
your song was very beautiful.

889
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:17,250
-You did?
-Yes.

890
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:18,650
Thank you.

891
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,150
Good-bye.

892
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:25,450
Good-bye.

893
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:27,350
Oh, here's your hat.

894
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:31,050
Oh, look. You keep it.

895
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:34,150
But you may need it.

896
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:36,950
No, I'd like you to keep it.

897
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:39,250
All right.

898
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:42,350
If you think that you should
want it or need it sometimes...

899
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:44,650
Well, if I need it...

900
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:48,150
I could always come,
perhaps, and pick it up.

901
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:49,950
That would be very nice.

902
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:53,950
When would you be available
for me to pick up my hat?

903
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:58,350
Maybe next week.

904
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:01,050
I'll come and get it then.

905
01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:03,050
For I'd love
to have my hat back.

906
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:04,050
Good-bye.

907
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:05,250
Bye-bye.
