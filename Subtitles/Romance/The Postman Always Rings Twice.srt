before I sock you.

501
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:41,162
You know, it's after 7:00. We've got
to get this place going for business.

502
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:44,666
FRANK: That was the happiest week
I'd ever spent in my life.

503
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,292
I wouldn't let myself think.

504
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,296
And Cora wouldn't even discuss what
was gonna happen when Nick came home.

505
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:52,882
All I cared about was her being happy.

506
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,637
And as for me,
I felt as if I was riding on a cloud.

507
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:01,975
Look at that, a battery
and a whole set of plugs.

508
00:46:02,142 --> 00:46:05,395
I'll say everything's fine around here.
One sale.

509
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:10,358
Will Mrs. Smith be tickled pink! Say, how
about a nice cold drink on the house?

510
00:46:10,526 --> 00:46:12,819
No. Nope, I've got to hurry.

511
00:46:13,112 --> 00:46:15,572
- So your boss is coming home?
- Any day now.

512
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:19,075
Today, you mean. Sure, I just passed
the car coming from town.

513
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,452
That gorgeous blond
was driving careful...

514
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,997
...and the old boy has a bandage
on his head.

515
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:26,499
Oh, that poor little pussycat.

516
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:30,587
- Sure killed her.
- Yep. Deader than a doornail, remember?

517
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,463
Yeah.

518
00:46:39,722 --> 00:46:43,141
FRANK: It was for her sake as well
as mine that I knew I had to move on.

519
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:45,810
If I waited for them,
I couldn't convince her...

520
00:46:45,978 --> 00:46:48,271
...to give up the place
and go away with me.

521
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:52,025
And if I stayed there,
I could see where she and I were headed.

522
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:55,403
But after a couple weeks in L.A...

523
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:58,573
...I sunk low enough to hang around
a wholesale market...

524
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:03,828
...where they bought a lot of their stuff,
hoping I'd run into her.

525
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:09,751
I just couldn't get her out of my mind.
It kept nagging me all the time.

Hey, Frank!

00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:32,982

all over for weeks!

- We're going back to Twin Oaks.
- I can't.

00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:40,406
Something important's
happening tonight, and you're in on it.

531
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:43,117
Besides, I wanna tell you
about my accident.

532
00:47:43,702 --> 00:47:45,119
That's the truth.

533
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:48,164
Yes, sir, I can show you
the doctor's bill receipted.

534
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:53,086
That little business in the bathroom
that night cost me $322, believe it or not.

535
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:56,381
- That's a lot of hamburgers.
- Yeah-- Aw, no....

536
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:05,431
Well, where did you come from?

537
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,600
I found him near the market.

538
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:12,522
Hello, Mrs. Smith.
How have you been?

539
00:48:13,315 --> 00:48:16,693
Splendid, thank you.
You're quite a stranger.

540
00:48:18,737 --> 00:48:21,781
Well, I've got work to do.
Hope it was cooler in town.

Uh-oh. It's a customer. Just a minute.

Have you been thinking about me, Cora?

544
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:47,432
I couldn't forget you that quick.

00:48:54,189 --> 00:48:57,525
- How have you been?
- All right.

00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:04,949
Have you got a little kiss for me?

547
00:49:05,117 --> 00:49:08,953
We're going to have dinner in a few
minutes, and you'd better get ready.

548
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:14,542
As a homecoming, this is the worst flop
I ever saw in my life.

549
00:49:25,554 --> 00:49:28,181
NICK: Of course, they took a lot
of x-ray pictures...

00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:31,184
...but this is the one
that makes it look worse, see?

00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:35,021
- What's this? A family album?
- Sure.

552
00:49:35,522 --> 00:49:39,358
There's my first license to sell food
in Los Angeles County.

553
00:49:39,526 --> 00:49:43,154
And that's a snapshot of Cora and me
the day we were married.

554
00:49:43,322 --> 00:49:44,822
Wasn't she cute?

00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,450
Just a minute. I'll put the other light on.

00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:56,334
Which one of you two is working
for the electric light company?

557
00:49:56,502 --> 00:49:59,170
NICK:
Put on the lights again, Cora, please.

558
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:02,632
All right, waste your money.

559
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:07,595
The next time the electric light bill
comes in, I'm not gonna be here to pay it.

- You're not going to be here?
- No.

Oh, now you've made me
tell the big surprise before I was ready.

562
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:15,770
I'm selling the Twin Oaks.

563
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:18,564
Well, that's not a very good joke.

564
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:20,441
It's not a joke.

565
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:23,820
A fellow named Stanton said
they're turning this road into a highway.

566
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:25,905
He's offering a big price for the place.

567
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,283
Why sell now when it might turn out
to be a gold mine?

568
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:33,120
Somebody's bound to open up
a better place and put us out of business.

569
00:50:33,288 --> 00:50:37,250
But mainly, Cora, so as you can
stop work and take it easy.

570
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:40,545
Stop work? Where? Doing what?

571
00:50:40,712 --> 00:50:44,757
- We're going back to live with my sister.
- Your sister?

572
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:48,427
Nick, you never even told me
you had a sister.

573
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:51,514
Well, I didn't want to worry you
about her. You see...

574
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:54,767
...she hasn't been very well
for a good many years.

575
00:50:55,394 --> 00:50:58,312
- Where is she?
- In northern Canada. She's got a house.

576
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,107
Of course, half of it belongs to me.

577
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:05,903
Nick, this is pretty sudden.

578
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:09,657
- Let me tell you what I think about it.
- No, Cora.

579
00:51:09,825 --> 00:51:12,660
- This is best.
- But, Nick, please.

580
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:16,789
- Let's talk this over.
- No. There's nothing to talk over.

581

I've given it a good deal of thought.
My mind's made up.

582
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:24,422
You thought it over and your mind's
made up. Without even talking to me...

583
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,924
...your mind's made up. Well, mine isn't!

584
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:32,805
That's too bad.

585
00:51:37,144 --> 00:51:39,562

became paralyzed.

Oh, she's going to live
for a long time yet. I hope.

Yeah. Goodbye, Mr. Stanton.

you'll thank me for this.

But isn't there any other way
out for us?

641
00:56:54,502 --> 00:56:58,047
You were just gonna put a knife
in him, weren't you?

642
00:57:02,761 --> 00:57:04,637
No.

643
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:08,140

991
01:22:25,323 --> 01:22:29,660
Cora Smith, to the crime of manslaughter,
how do you plead?

992
01:22:32,831 --> 01:22:34,248
Guilty.

993
01:22:44,342 --> 01:22:45,634
Guilty.

994
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:55,227
Your Honor, we waive time for sentence.
We're ready for sentence now.

995
01:22:55,979 --> 01:23:00,024
It is the sentence of the law
and the judgment of this court...

996
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:04,278
...that you be confined in the state
institution for women at Tehachapi...

997
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,530
...for the term prescribed by law.

998
01:23:06,698 --> 01:23:10,701
If Your Honor please, I recommend
leniency be granted this defendant.

999
01:23:13,872 --> 01:23:19,001
It seems to me that considerable leniency
has been given this defendant already.

1000
01:23:19,336 --> 01:23:23,547
May we approach the bench
and explain the facts to Your Honor?

1001
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:26,675
Very well.

1002
01:23:39,022 --> 01:23:41,649
I am personally satisfied
of the defendant's guilt...

1003
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:43,567
...beyond a reasonable doubt...

1004
01:23:43,735 --> 01:23:48,405
...but there are many practical and legal
difficulties in proving the case against her.

1005
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:51,951
In these circumstances,
I deemed it wise to follow this course...

1006
01:23:52,118 --> 01:23:57,331
...thus saving the people of the state of
California the expense of a protracted trial.

1007
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:00,125
Return to your places.

1008
01:24:07,259 --> 01:24:10,010
JUDGE: Having full confidence
in the district attorney...

1009
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:11,720
...I follow his recommendation.

1010
01:24:11,888 --> 01:24:14,306
The court summarily grants probation.

1011
01:24:14,474 --> 01:24:17,518
And suspends execution of the sentence.

1012
01:24:21,898 --> 01:24:23,607
That's it. You're free.

1013
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:29,613
It's all right, Mrs. Smith.
Everything's gonna be all right now.

1014
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:34,785
That's what you think.

1015
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:42,209
That was a brilliant piece
of strategy, laddie.

1016
01:24:42,961 --> 01:24:44,128
Thank you, Kyle.

1017
01:24:44,296 --> 01:24:47,965
But you're crazy if you think I'm
through with those two murderers.

1018
01:24:50,135 --> 01:24:52,303
Well, that's the whole story.

1019
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:56,640
Except that if either one of you even
parks a car alongside a fire hydrant...

1020
01:24:56,808 --> 01:24:59,560
...Mr. Sackett will see
that you get 20 years.

1021
01:25:07,485 --> 01:25:10,738
Just a minute.
There's one other little matter.

1022
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:12,448
Yes?

1023
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:16,702
That insurance policy.

1024
01:25:16,995 --> 01:25:20,456
This 10,000 bucks you get
for knocking off your husband.

1025
01:25:20,665 --> 01:25:23,459
Oh, sure. That's how I knew
Sackett was bluffing.

1026
01:25:23,627 --> 01:25:27,212
If the company with the smartest
detectives couldn't find evidence...

1027
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,840
...it's a cinch the DA couldn't.

1028
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,842
- I....
- Uh....

1029
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:36,347
In an exceptional case like this,
I ought to keep it all.

1030
01:25:38,725 --> 01:25:40,434
But this time...

1031
01:25:40,852 --> 01:25:42,728
...you take it.

1032
01:25:43,229 --> 01:25:47,983
I don't want that 10 grand.
Besides, I got 10 grand.

1033
01:25:48,777 --> 01:25:52,696
I've been trying to figure things out,
and I still don't know what to say.

1034
01:25:52,864 --> 01:25:56,533
Don't say thanks. You did me a favor.
Look what I got out of it:

1035
01:25:56,701 --> 01:26:00,037
I won 100 bucks from Sackett.
I made him write me a check.

1036
01:26:00,205 --> 01:26:02,498
I'm gonna frame it
and hang it over my desk.

1037
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:04,833
- Let's get going, Kennedy.
KENNEDY: Back to town, Sammy.

1038
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:06,585
Okay, boss.

1039
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:18,597
Well, goodbye, Mr. Yellow.

1040
01:26:18,765 --> 01:26:21,558
I don't know what you're going to do
and I don't care...

1041
01:26:21,726 --> 01:26:24,728
...but I'm going in
and open up my lunchroom.

1042
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:31,110
Cora. Cora, look...

1043
01:26:31,277 --> 01:26:34,571
...maybe-- Maybe you
could sell the place and...

1044
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:38,492
...we can go away somewhere and
start fresh, where nobody knows us.

1045
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,119
Oh, no.

1046
01:26:40,286 --> 01:26:43,080
You've tried to make me a tramp
since you've known me.

1047
01:26:43,248 --> 01:26:45,207
But you're not going to do it.

1048
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:47,584
I stay here.

1049
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:50,004
All right.

1050
01:26:52,048 --> 01:26:54,258
I'm gonna stay too.

1051
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:58,429
Let me tell you something.
If you do stay...

1052
01:26:58,596 --> 01:27:02,891
...there's going to be a lot of hard work,
because I've got ideas for this place.

1053
01:27:03,059 --> 01:27:05,477
I'm going to fix a nice spot
under the trees...

1054
01:27:05,645 --> 01:27:07,438
...then I'm going to sell beer--

1055
01:27:07,605 --> 01:27:12,484
- You're in the hamburger business--
- I'm going to amount to something!

So if you want to keep your job...

1057
01:27:16,614 --> 01:27:20,367
...you'll have this place clean and open
for business tomorrow at 7.

1058
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:22,161
Okay.

1059
01:27:23,455 --> 01:27:26,165
Okay, Mrs. Smith.

1060
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:31,336
That expresses it perfectly.

1061
01:27:33,923 --> 01:27:36,091
FRANK: Things stayed that way
for several weeks.

1062
01:27:36,259 --> 01:27:39,386
I had to watch her like a hawk
because I didn't trust her.

1063
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:43,474
People started flocking to the Twin Oaks
just to see what she looked like.

1064
01:27:44,184 --> 01:27:46,602
WOMAN:
Oh, Mrs. Smith?

1065
01:27:49,355 --> 01:27:52,483
Mrs. Smith, would you kindly
give me your autograph?

1066
01:27:56,446 --> 01:27:58,280
Oh, thank you.

- Hello.

01:28:16,508 --> 01:28:19,551
- Hello, Mr. Sackett.
- Mrs. Smith.

01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:21,553
Something I can do for you?

1072
01:28:21,721 --> 01:28:24,181
- Only some beer at the moment.
- I see.

Suppose I handle this table.

1075
01:28:28,311 --> 01:28:30,604
You shouldn't mind
my handling anything for you.

1076
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:39,530
- Hello, Frank.
- Hi, Mr. Keats.

1077
01:28:55,213 --> 01:28:57,214
- Maybe it doesn't mean a thing.
- What?

1078
01:28:57,382 --> 01:28:59,800
Maybe the district attorney's
gonna take action.

1079
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:03,554
He claims folks are talking
about you two living here like this.

1080
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:06,098
- Talking about it?
- That's a laugh.

1081
01:29:06,266 --> 01:29:10,561
Is it? An unmarried man and woman
living together under the same roof?

1082
01:29:10,728 --> 01:29:12,813
In Los Angeles,
they held a murder suspect.

1083
01:29:12,981 --> 01:29:16,191
When they couldn't hang it on him,
they threw him in the can...

1084
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:19,361
- ...under 47 different laws.
- I'm way ahead of you, Mr. Keats.

1085
01:29:19,529 --> 01:29:21,655
And I'll handle this.

1086

Don't wipe it off, Mr. Keats.
You look stunning in my lipstick.

1087
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:32,374
This kind tastes good too.
What flavor do you call it, Frank?

1088
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:35,419
- I can't remember that far back.
- As far as I'm concerned...

1089
01:29:35,587 --> 01:29:39,548
- ...you imagined it even then.
- Oh, dry up.

1090
01:29:41,926 --> 01:29:44,011
- Thanks.
- Notice his necktie, Mr. Keats.

1091
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:46,388
It's my wedding present to him.

1092
01:29:46,556 --> 01:29:49,850
The way he wears it, you'd think
it was a noose around his neck.

1093
01:29:50,018 --> 01:29:54,730
Well, I can only think of 15 or 20 reasons
why you two should never be happy.

Well, there you are, my dear.

1095
01:29:57,192 --> 01:30:00,777
Thanks. We'll paste it
right alongside of our beer license.

1096

Say, this came
while you were getting prettied up.

1097
01:30:04,115 --> 01:30:06,867
Hope it's congratulations from Sackett.

1098
01:30:07,035 --> 01:30:08,911
- Would you?
- Bad news?

01:30:09,078 --> 01:30:11,371
You hope.

a drink. You could use a pickup.

1153
01:33:39,497 --> 01:33:42,207
- I'm not drinking anymore.
- Well, what's the matter?

1154
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:46,336
I have a lot to tell you. I think you and I
will get along better from now on.

1155
01:33:46,504 --> 01:33:49,548
- Well, what is it?
- Not now. Tonight, maybe after dinner.

1156
01:33:49,715 --> 01:33:51,508
Here we are.

1157
01:33:51,676 --> 01:33:54,177
Where'd you get the new car?

1158
01:33:55,555 --> 01:33:57,013
Oh.

[TIRES SCREECHING]

1160
01:34:07,358 --> 01:34:09,192
Hello.

1161
01:34:09,944 --> 01:34:11,319
Remember me?

1162
01:34:15,867 --> 01:34:19,119
Yeah, sure, I remember you.

1163
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:21,746
Come on in.

1164
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:31,882
How you been, Mrs. Chambers?

1165
01:34:32,049 --> 01:34:33,508
Fine, thanks.

1166
01:34:33,676 --> 01:34:36,887
Oh, Frank, why don't you take
Mr. Kennedy into the living room?

1167
01:34:37,054 --> 01:34:38,597
I'll get you a couple of beers.

1168
01:34:38,764 --> 01:34:42,184
- Yeah, you'll be more comfortable there.
- Thanks.

1169
01:34:42,351 --> 01:34:45,520
- How's Mr. Keats?
- Me and him had a little argument.

1170
01:34:45,688 --> 01:34:48,023
- I walked out.
- Yeah?

1171
01:34:48,191 --> 01:34:51,902
Well, if there's anything we can do,
just say the word.

1172
01:34:52,069 --> 01:34:53,778
I was wondering...

1173
01:34:53,946 --> 01:34:57,282
...if you could let me
have a little money.

1174
01:34:57,450 --> 01:35:01,995
Well, I don't keep very much
money here, but if $20 will help....

1175
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:04,206
I was hoping you could make it more.

1176
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:08,210
- All right, Kennedy, what is it?
- That paper...

1177
01:35:08,377 --> 01:35:11,755
...the one I wrote up for you,
Mrs. Chambers.

1178
01:35:12,215 --> 01:35:14,508
You mean that daydream
she called a confession?

1179
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:18,303
Yeah. It was still in the files
when I left Keats...

1180
01:35:18,471 --> 01:35:22,182
...so I took it. I was thinking
maybe you'd like to get it back.

1181
01:35:22,391 --> 01:35:25,268
- How much do you want for it?
- How much would you pay?

1182
01:35:25,436 --> 01:35:29,064
We don't need that confession now.
We might give you $100 for it, though.

1183
01:35:29,232 --> 01:35:31,608
Sure. I'd pay that for it.

1184
01:35:31,776 --> 01:35:34,611
I was thinking it was worth more.

1185
01:35:36,948 --> 01:35:39,783
I was figuring on about...

1186
01:35:39,951 --> 01:35:41,785
...$15,000.

1187
01:35:41,953 --> 01:35:44,788
- Are you crazy?
- Well, you got 10 grand from insurance...

1188
01:35:44,956 --> 01:35:47,123
...and the publicity's
making you a fortune.

1189
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:50,418
Maybe 5 grand more.
That makes 15.

1190
01:35:51,295 --> 01:35:54,214
- You'd clean us out just for that paper?
- It's worth it.

1191
01:35:54,382 --> 01:35:57,092
- Why you--
- Now, don't start anything, Chambers!

1192
01:35:58,261 --> 01:36:00,887
In the first place,
I haven't got the paper with me.

1193
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:04,432
I'm not starting anything. I....

1194
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,601
I guess you got us.

1195
01:36:06,769 --> 01:36:09,437
Yeah, but, you're figuring too high.

1196
01:36:09,605 --> 01:36:12,190
- Keep talking.
- Well...

1197
01:36:12,358 --> 01:36:15,777
...we made $4000, not $5000,
but we spent a couple of thousand.

1198
01:36:15,945 --> 01:36:18,780
And I had to go East and of course,
it cost quite a lot.

1199
01:36:18,948 --> 01:36:20,657
FRANK:
Her mother died.

1200
01:36:20,825 --> 01:36:22,993
And then we've been
fixing up the place.

1201
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:25,161
All right.

1202
01:36:25,329 --> 01:36:27,706
Ten and two makes 12.

1203
01:36:27,873 --> 01:36:30,333
- Twelve grand.
- The whole 12?

1204
01:36:30,501 --> 01:36:33,837
Twelve thousand,
or the confession goes to Sackett.

1205
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:38,883
Well, it looks like
we'll have to give it to him, Frank.

1206
01:36:39,051 --> 01:36:42,679
- It's tough, but he's got us.
- Yeah.

1207
01:36:43,347 --> 01:36:46,057
I'll phone you at 5:00.
That'll give you time...

1208
01:36:46,225 --> 01:36:50,353
...to go to the bank and get it.
At 5, if you got it, I'll come right out.

1209
01:36:50,521 --> 01:36:54,024
If you haven't got it, Sackett.

1210
01:36:54,859 --> 01:36:58,778
You know, Mr. Kennedy, it's really
too bad that Frank was here...

1211
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:01,865
...because if we had been alone,
I feel...

1212
01:37:02,033 --> 01:37:05,285
...that I could've talked you out of it.

1213
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:17,213
All right, snap out of it
and get your friends on the phone.

1214
01:37:17,381 --> 01:37:18,923
I got no friends.

1215
01:37:19,091 --> 01:37:21,635
I'm the only one that knows--

1216
01:37:23,262 --> 01:37:26,014
- You're gonna call your friends?
- I ain't got no friends.

1217
01:37:26,182 --> 01:37:28,224
I'm the only one that knows about it.

1218
01:37:28,392 --> 01:37:31,603
- You're gonna call your friends?
- I got no friends. I tell you--

1219
01:37:38,402 --> 01:37:39,861
Don't hit me no more!

1220
01:37:40,029 --> 01:37:43,573
- I tell you, I only got one friend.
- All right.

1221
01:37:43,741 --> 01:37:46,034
Get him on the phone.
Come on, in the kitchen.

1222
01:37:46,202 --> 01:37:48,495
KENNEDY:
All right! All right!

1223
01:37:48,663 --> 01:37:50,330
Here.

1224
01:37:51,248 --> 01:37:52,999
Thanks.

1225
01:37:55,252 --> 01:37:58,088
Cora, bring the extension phone,
will you?

1226
01:37:59,965 --> 01:38:03,176
There it is, Kennedy.
Make it a good story.

1227
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:05,428
Here.

1228
01:38:05,596 --> 01:38:08,139
If he tries to pull a fast one,
I'll give you the sign.

1229
01:38:08,307 --> 01:38:09,766
Okay.

1230
01:38:09,934 --> 01:38:11,935
Come on.

1231
01:38:18,109 --> 01:38:19,651
Say--

1232
01:38:26,742 --> 01:38:28,618
Is that you, Willie?

1233
01:38:28,786 --> 01:38:31,955
This is me.
Listen, it's all fixed.

1234
01:38:32,123 --> 01:38:35,291
How soon can you get out here
with it? Yeah.

1235
01:38:35,459 --> 01:38:38,586
Yeah, Chambers is on his way
to the bank now to get the dough.

1236
01:38:38,754 --> 01:38:41,631
Willie, get this.
He knows we got him, see.

1237
01:38:41,799 --> 01:38:45,719
But he's afraid if she finds out he's gonna
pay all that dough, she won't let him.

1238
01:38:45,886 --> 01:38:47,345
You get it?

1239
01:38:50,182 --> 01:38:53,435
Well, maybe it sounds to you
like a funny way to do it, Willie...

1240
01:38:53,602 --> 01:38:55,812
...but I got my reasons.

1241
01:38:57,356 --> 01:38:59,315
Okay.

1242
01:39:01,318 --> 01:39:04,320
Willie's gonna bring the papers
out here.

1243
01:39:04,488 --> 01:39:06,573
He's awful suspicious.

1244
01:39:06,741 --> 01:39:09,159
Willie's a bad hombre
when he gets suspicious.

1245
01:39:09,326 --> 01:39:12,328
Yeah? Thanks.

1246
01:39:13,956 --> 01:39:17,250
That's so you'll act right
when he gets here.

1247
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:23,590
And that's for playing along, Cora.
I think we better open the place up...

1248
01:39:23,758 --> 01:39:26,301
...just the beer garden,
better not let anyone inside.

1249
01:39:26,469 --> 01:39:27,677
All right, Frank.

1250
01:39:33,517 --> 01:39:36,519
I think that's your friend Willie,
but if it's not Willie...

1251
01:39:36,687 --> 01:39:39,689
...I'm gonna give you
another going over just for luck.

1252
01:39:40,858 --> 01:39:42,942
Gesundheit.

1253
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:02,629
- What gives?
- This. Keep moving.

1254
01:40:05,424 --> 01:40:07,926
All right, Cora, his pockets.

1255
01:40:09,595 --> 01:40:12,555
- Here it is!
FRANK: The other pockets!

1256
01:40:12,723 --> 01:40:15,016
- This is it.
- Here.

1257
01:40:17,144 --> 01:40:19,229
Photostats!

1258
01:40:19,396 --> 01:40:20,772
And the negative.

1259
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:23,149
So they meant to keep on
blackmailing us.

1260
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:25,109
Yeah, but not anymore.

1261
01:40:25,277 --> 01:40:26,945
Thanks, boys.

1262
01:40:27,112 --> 01:40:31,366
Come on, I'll show you out.
Come on!

1263
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:35,954
Come on, come on, come on. Out!

1264
01:40:48,676 --> 01:40:50,718
Well, we did it, didn't we?

1265
01:40:53,264 --> 01:40:56,724
- That's the last of the Photostats.
- Oh, no, it isn't.

1266
01:40:57,309 --> 01:41:00,770
That isn't the last of the Photostats.
I got a million of them here.

1267
01:41:00,938 --> 01:41:04,190
- So you got a million of them.
- Just one is enough for Mr. Sackett.

1268
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:07,569
You're not foolish enough
to stick your nose in that gas chamber...

1269
01:41:07,736 --> 01:41:09,112
...just to get even with me.

1270
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,447
No, you didn't understand
Mr. Keats at all.

1271
01:41:11,615 --> 01:41:14,784
Once they made it manslaughter,
they can't do anything more to me!

1272
01:41:14,952 --> 01:41:17,161
What's the matter with you, Cora?

1273
01:41:17,454 --> 01:41:19,956
This! While you were
wet-nursing Kennedy...

1274
01:41:20,124 --> 01:41:23,209
...your friend dropped in outside.

1275
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:27,505
So you're an outlaw,
and you just love Mexican food.

1276
01:41:27,673 --> 01:41:31,467
I hope your broken-down sweetie
brings you plenty to the death house...

1277

- What did you think I was doing?
- I didn't think anything.

1281
01:41:52,031 --> 01:41:55,366
Don't worry, when it's time
to call Mr. Sackett, I'll let you know.

1282
01:41:55,534 --> 01:41:59,370
In the meantime, just take it easy.
You're gonna need all your strength.

1283
01:42:09,632 --> 01:42:12,216

to keep up my strength, dearie.

01:42:12,384 --> 01:42:14,844
- That's nice of you.
- What'd you think I was doing?

1285
01:42:15,012 --> 01:42:16,387
I didn't think anything.

1286
01:42:16,555 --> 01:42:19,599
Don't worry, when I'm ready to skip out,
I'll let you know.

1287
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:22,936
Just take it easy,
you may need all your strength.

1288
01:42:26,482 --> 01:42:28,358
FRANK:
That's the way it kept up all day.

1289
01:42:28,525 --> 01:42:31,694
Me following her around
for fear she'd call Sackett.

1290
01:42:31,862 --> 01:42:35,657
Her watching me like a hawk,
for fear I'd....

1291
01:42:36,617 --> 01:42:39,202
Both of us hating each other
like poison.

1292
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:41,162
Finally, she went up to bed.

1293
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:45,124
I went to my room,
but I knew I didn't dare sleep.

1294
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:47,168
Then all of a sudden....

1295
01:42:56,303 --> 01:42:58,388
- Get away from there or I'll--
- Or you'll what?

[PHONE RINGS]

1297

Hello? Yellow Cab?

1298
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:05,520
We changed our mind.
We don't need a cab now, thanks.

1299
01:43:05,688 --> 01:43:08,022
- Or you'll what?
- Sock you in the jaw maybe.

1300
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:11,567
Something else, wasn't it?
You've been thinking of a way to kill me.

1301
01:43:11,735 --> 01:43:13,403
- I've been asleep.
- Don't lie to me!

1302
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:15,989
- Because I'm not gonna lie to you.
- All right, I was.

1303
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:19,325
You were gonna duck out and hand me
over to Sackett, so we're even.

1304
01:43:19,493 --> 01:43:21,869
Right back where we started.

1305
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:24,831
Not quite, Cora.

1306
01:43:24,999 --> 01:43:27,417
That other girl...

1307
01:43:27,584 --> 01:43:30,003
...she didn't mean anything to me.

1308
01:43:30,254 --> 01:43:32,714
She told me you were going away
with her.

1309

Why didn't I? I planned to,
and never come back.

1310
01:43:35,759 --> 01:43:37,927
Why didn't I go away
and never come back?

1311
01:43:38,929 --> 01:43:41,305
Because we're chained
to each other, Cora.

1312
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:44,642
- Don't tell me you love me.
- But I do.

01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:48,646
- Oh, but love when fear comes into it....
- Then you hate me?

1314
01:43:49,606 --> 01:43:51,357
I don't know.

1315
01:43:52,401 --> 01:43:55,028
But we've got to tell the truth
for once in our lives.

1316
01:43:55,195 --> 01:43:57,572
All right, why were you gonna
run away then?

1317
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:02,243
I told you I had something to tell you.

1318
01:44:05,581 --> 01:44:06,956
Frank...

1319
01:44:07,124 --> 01:44:09,625
...I wasn't going to Mr. Sackett tonight.

1320
01:44:10,627 --> 01:44:12,045
I was running away...

1321
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,547
...for good.

1322
01:44:14,798 --> 01:44:17,550
So that you
wouldn't ever see me again.

1323
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,303
Me or....

1324
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:23,806
- Me or....
- Cora.

1325
01:44:24,808 --> 01:44:28,102
Oh, no, don't, Frank.
I've got to tell you all about it.

1326
01:44:28,353 --> 01:44:29,854
We....

1327
01:44:30,522 --> 01:44:32,440
We took a life, didn't we, Frank?

1328
01:44:32,608 --> 01:44:35,818
Well, now we can give one back.
Then maybe God will forgive us...

1329
01:44:35,986 --> 01:44:38,071
...and maybe it'll help square us.

1330
01:44:38,363 --> 01:44:40,114
Maybe it will.

1331
01:44:40,282 --> 01:44:43,493
Maybe it'll help.
We've been all mixed up.

1332
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:46,662
Oh, Frank, I couldn't
turn you in to Sackett.

1333
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:51,375
I couldn't have this baby and then
have it find out I'd sent its father...

1334
01:44:52,002 --> 01:44:54,796
...into that poison gas chamber
for murder.

1335
01:44:55,547 --> 01:44:56,881
Was...?

1336
01:44:57,049 --> 01:44:59,509
Was the baby the only reason?

1337
01:45:01,345 --> 01:45:02,845
No.

1338
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:07,141
Oh, Frank. Please, there's one thing
I have to be sure of.

1339
01:45:07,309 --> 01:45:09,060
No, don't ask me any questions.

1340
01:45:09,228 --> 01:45:13,147
Just take me down to the beach.
We've been so happy there.

1341
01:45:13,315 --> 01:45:15,733
And let's be happy again...

1342
01:45:15,901 --> 01:45:17,276
...just once more.

1343
01:45:17,444 --> 01:45:21,155
And then I promise that everything will
be settled, one way or the other...

1344
01:45:21,323 --> 01:45:23,324
...before we come back.

1345
01:45:24,493 --> 01:45:26,702
I'll get the car, Cora.

1346
01:45:37,756 --> 01:45:38,840
Frank.

1347
01:45:39,007 --> 01:45:41,801
All the hate and revenge has left me...

1348
01:45:41,969 --> 01:45:44,220
...but is it all out of you?

1349
01:45:44,388 --> 01:45:48,391
I'm trying to find some way
I could prove it to you.

1350
01:45:49,768 --> 01:45:51,894
Maybe I know a way.

1351
01:45:52,563 --> 01:45:55,439
Let's swim out there, way, way out...

1352
01:45:55,607 --> 01:45:58,901
...until we're so tired that
we'll just barely be able to get back.

1353
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:01,154
- How is that gonna prove--?
- Please, Frank.

1354
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:03,489
Come on, I'll show you.

1355
01:46:26,763 --> 01:46:28,389
This is far enough.

1356
01:46:28,557 --> 01:46:32,268
- Are you tired?
- Very tired. How about you?

1357
01:46:32,436 --> 01:46:34,187
I'm still all right.

1358
01:46:34,354 --> 01:46:35,730
Frank...

1359
01:46:35,898 --> 01:46:38,107
...what I wanted to be sure of was...

1360
01:46:38,275 --> 01:46:40,902
...whether you trust me.

1361
01:46:41,236 --> 01:46:44,655
If you don't believe
that I can never turn on you again...

1362
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:48,951
...and if you don't want me to go back
with you...

1363
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:51,787
...you could swim back by yourself.

1364
01:46:52,039 --> 01:46:54,832
I'm too tired,
I could never make it alone.

1365
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,417
Nobody will ever know.

1366
01:46:56,585 --> 01:47:00,963
Cora, Cora, don't say another word.
Darling, save your strength.

1367
01:47:01,131 --> 01:47:02,965
I'll take you in.

1368
01:47:40,879 --> 01:47:42,880
Are you sure now?

1369
01:47:44,549 --> 01:47:45,967
I'm sure.

1370
01:47:55,352 --> 01:47:58,521
I've been waiting a long time
for that kiss.

1371
01:47:58,855 --> 01:48:02,566
When we get home, Frank,
then there will be kisses.

1372
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:05,319
Kisses with dreams in them.

1373
01:48:05,529 --> 01:48:09,031
Kisses that come from life,
not death.

1374
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,117
I hope I can wait.

1375
01:48:12,744 --> 01:48:14,537
Darling.

1376
01:48:19,209 --> 01:48:20,626
Look out!

1377
01:48:20,794 --> 01:48:22,295
Frank!

1378
01:48:32,889 --> 01:48:34,056
Cora.

1379
01:48:44,568 --> 01:48:47,069
SACKETT: This man, Frank Chambers,
and the dead woman...

1380
01:48:47,237 --> 01:48:50,406
...first murdered her husband
to get his estate.

1381
01:48:50,574 --> 01:48:53,951
Then Chambers murdered her
so that he'd have it all to himself.

1382
01:48:56,413 --> 01:48:58,956
The jury was out five minutes.

1383
01:48:59,124 --> 01:49:00,833
The judge said in sentencing me...

1384
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:03,252
...that he was giving
the same consideration...

1385
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:05,046
...he'd show any other mad dog.

1386
01:49:05,213 --> 01:49:06,714
I see.

1387
01:49:07,007 --> 01:49:08,507
I see.

1388
01:49:09,092 --> 01:49:10,634
And now, Father...

1389
01:49:10,802 --> 01:49:13,346
...comes the important thing
you can do for me.

1390
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:14,972
Do you think she knows?

1391
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:17,933
Knows that you didn't kill her?

1392
01:49:18,101 --> 01:49:19,935
She must know it.

1393
01:49:21,188 --> 01:49:24,231
But that's the awful part
when you monkey with murder.

1394
01:49:24,775 --> 01:49:26,275
Somehow...

1395
01:49:26,902 --> 01:49:30,613
...maybe it flashed through her head
when the car hit...

1396
01:49:30,781 --> 01:49:32,740
...that maybe I did do it.

1397
01:49:32,908 --> 01:49:35,242
Father, do you think she knows
the truth?

1398
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:37,370
We can hope.

1399
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:40,164
We got off to a wrong start,
and somehow or other...

1400
01:49:40,332 --> 01:49:42,458
...we never got back on the right track.

1401
01:49:42,626 --> 01:49:44,710
But I didn't kill her.

1402
01:49:44,878 --> 01:49:48,339
I loved her so much,
I tell you, I would have died for her!

1403
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,806
I just talked to the governor.

1404
01:50:00,811 --> 01:50:02,269
But, I....

1405
01:50:02,437 --> 01:50:03,813
I didn't do it.

1406
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:06,524
- I didn't do it, I tell you!
- Wait a minute!

1407
01:50:06,691 --> 01:50:08,567
All right, suppose you didn't do it.

1408
01:50:08,735 --> 01:50:12,446
Get me a new trial. I'm not gonna
go in that gas chamber for killing her!

1409
01:50:12,614 --> 01:50:17,284
Suppose you got a stay of execution, new
trial, acquittal of killing Cora. Then what?

1410
01:50:17,828 --> 01:50:21,330
Last night they auctioned off the fixtures
at the Twin Oaks.

1411
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:26,168
A man who bought the cash register
found a note in the back of the drawer.

1412
01:50:26,336 --> 01:50:29,880
He brought it to me.
It's addressed to you.

1413
01:50:30,048 --> 01:50:31,841
Cora wrote it.

1414
01:50:40,725 --> 01:50:43,102
It's a very beautiful note, Frank...

1415
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,772
...written by a girl
who loved a man very much.

1416
01:50:47,441 --> 01:50:50,693
I imagine it was written
earlier the very night she died.

1417
01:50:50,861 --> 01:50:53,028
A note of farewell, isn't it?

1418
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:56,740
She did try and run away that night.

1419
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:02,538
And since she had no idea anyone
would ever see that note but you...

1420
01:51:02,706 --> 01:51:05,541
...it therefore has
just enough of a confession...

1421
01:51:05,709 --> 01:51:08,627
...to convict you of helping her
kill her husband.

1422
01:51:10,213 --> 01:51:13,549
So if you were to leave this room
because you didn't kill her...

1423
01:51:13,717 --> 01:51:17,595
...you'd soon be back here again
for helping her kill Nick.

1424
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:19,346
What's the use?

1425
01:51:23,393 --> 01:51:24,894
Then....

1426
01:51:25,061 --> 01:51:29,440
Then what's gonna happen to me
is not because I killed her?

1427
01:51:29,608 --> 01:51:32,443
No, laddie, for killing Nick.

1428
01:51:34,571 --> 01:51:36,238
You know...

1429
01:51:36,656 --> 01:51:39,408
...there's something about this
that's like....

1430
01:51:39,576 --> 01:51:41,202
Well, it's like...

1431
01:51:41,953 --> 01:51:43,412
...you're expecting...

1432
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:46,415
...a letter that you're just crazy
to get...

1433
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:50,586
...and you hang around
the front door...

1434
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:54,215
...for fear you might not hear him ring.

1435
01:51:54,591 --> 01:51:57,760
You never realize
that he always rings twice.

1436
01:51:58,595 --> 01:51:59,637
What's that?

1437
01:51:59,804 --> 01:52:02,223
Well, he rang twice for Cora...

1438
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:05,392
...and now he's ringing twice for me,
isn't he?

1439
01:52:07,562 --> 01:52:09,021
That's about it.

1440
01:52:09,189 --> 01:52:12,858
The truth is, you always
hear him ring the second time.

1441
01:52:13,026 --> 01:52:15,861
Even if you're way out in the backyard.

1442
01:52:17,614 --> 01:52:19,114
Father.

1443
01:52:19,991 --> 01:52:21,784
You were right.

1444
01:52:21,993 --> 01:52:23,661
It all works out.

1445
01:52:23,828 --> 01:52:27,790
I guess God knows more
about these things than we do.

1446
01:52:27,958 --> 01:52:29,833
Somehow or other...

1447
01:52:30,001 --> 01:52:32,753
...Cora paid for Nick's life with hers.

1448
01:52:33,338 --> 01:52:35,339
And now I'm going to.

1449
01:52:36,591 --> 01:52:37,633
Father...

1450
01:52:37,801 --> 01:52:40,970
...would you send up a prayer
for me and Cora?

1451
01:52:41,137 --> 01:52:43,722
And if you could find it in your heart...

1452
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:47,476
...make it that we're together,
wherever it is.
