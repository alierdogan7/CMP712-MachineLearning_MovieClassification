comes in and picks at his food.

showing up. It's ungentlemanly.

- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Marvelous, old boy.

Mm, yes, but what is it?

59
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,747
Well, it has to do with time.

60
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,226
Oh. I've always maintained
that this nation...

61
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,064
needs a reliable timepiece.

62
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,302
Mm, the navy needs one. Heh.

63
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,304
The army needs one
for the artillery.

64
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,944
You couldn't do better, George.
That's why you've been in hiding?

65
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,628
Very clever of you indeed.

66
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,945
I don't think George is
referring to a new timepiece.

67
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,590
No, David.

68
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,390
When I speak of time, I'm referring
to the fourth dimension.

69
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,104
Go on, George.

70
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,628
The fourth dimension
cannot be seen or felt.

71
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,150
If you don't mind, will you refresh
me on the first three dimensions?

72
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,589
Oh, really, Filby. Surely they taught
you something in school. Heh-heh.

73
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,629
Suppose you explain it, doctor.

74
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,624
Huh? Oh, certainly.

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,147
Heh.

76
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,670
For example, when I move in a
line, forward or backward...

77
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,106
that's one dimension.

78
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,668
When I move left or
right, two dimensions.

79
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,141
When I move up or down...

80
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,944
three dimensions.

81
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,308
For instance, that box.

82
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,425
That box has three dimensions:
length, breadth and height.

83
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,188
What is the fourth dimension?

84
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,790
Oh, well... That's mere theory.
No one really knows if it exists.

85
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,266
GEORGE: On the contrary.

86
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,187
The fourth dimension is as real
and true as the other three.

87
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,906
In fact, they couldn't
exist without it.

88
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,107
What do you mean?

89
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,185
Let's take that box.

90
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,706
It has the first three dimensions.

91
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,471
- What's inside?
- I'm coming to that.

92
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,429
Let's consider this first.

93
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,711
Why do we ignore the fourth dimension?
Because we can't move within it.

94
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,866
We can move in the other three. Up,
down, forward, sideways, backward.

95
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,785
But when it comes to
time, we are prisoners.

96
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,547
Do you follow me, Bridey?

97
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,781
No.

98
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,541
George, you've given a lucid explanation,
but I'm afraid I don't understand.

99
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,384
There are many things you
don't understand, yes?

100
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,951
Quite a number.

101
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,950
Yet you don't refuse
to believe in them?

102
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,429
- Not if I can see the proof myself.
- Good, Walter.

103
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,549
Gentlemen, all I'm asking you...

104
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,829
is to witness a demonstration
of movement...

105
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,187
within the fourth dimension.

106
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,306
- Doctor, can I have your help?
- Certainly. Ahem.

107
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,826
Ah, it's beautiful!

108
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,381
- Remarkable.
- Very nice, George.

109
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,424
Fascinating.

110
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,911
What is it?

111
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,586
This is only an experimental model.

112

- To carry a man? Where?

113
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,628
Into the past or into the future.

114
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,830
This is a time machine.

115
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,022
Okay, George, you've had your joke.
Tell us what this contraption is for.

116
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,387
I've already told you.

117
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,141
The larger model can carry
a passenger through time.

118
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,906
Not through space,
but through time.

119
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,031
If you go to the future, won't
you mess things up for us?

120
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,862
The future's already there.
It cannot be changed.

121
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,871
I wonder.

122
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,347
That's the most important
question I hope to answer.

123
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,671
Can man control his destiny? Can he
change the shape of things to come?

124
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,229
If you've gone mad, I forgive you.

125
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,910
- But if you're wasting our time...
- No! You're here as witnesses.

126
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,621

- To see? What?

about to perform.

128
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,784
Let me tell you how it works. The
time traveler sits in the saddle.

129
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,669
In front are the controls.

130
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,864
Let's do this properly. You
can spare a cigar, I trust?

131
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,946
Now, let us imagine
that this cigar...

132
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,471
is the time traveler.

133
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,745
The lever in front of
him controls movement.

134
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,149
Forward pressure sends
it into the future...

135
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,951
backward pressure, into the past.

136
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,865
The harder the pressure,
the faster it travels.

137
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,549
Our little experiment can
be performed only once.

138
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,831
If it succeeds, I lose my model.
That's why I need witnesses.

139
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,265
Go ahead, George.

140
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,786
Ready, gentlemen?

144
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,980
It worked.

145
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,543
- Where did it go?
- Go?

146
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,061
Nowhere, in the usual
sense. It's still here.

147
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,221
But it's no longer in the present.

148
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,344
It's traveling through time.
To the future, to be exact.

149
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,901
You expect us to believe that?

150
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,267
Well, you just... Certainly.

151
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,583
- You said it hadn't really moved.
- That's correct.

152
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,902
Then why can't we see it?

153
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,309
Because we're in this room
on December 31, 1899...

154
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,146
but the model is perhaps a
hundred years away by now.

155
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,702
This house may not be
here in a hundred years.

156
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,268
But the time machine occupies
the same space that it did...

157
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,263
a moment before its journey.

158
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,347
If it's occupying the same
space, why can't I feel it?

159
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,391
The space you're putting your
hand through is today's space.

160
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,982
You can't put your hand
into tomorrow's space.

161
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,507
Space doesn't change!

162

The same space that's here
now should be here forever.

How much would it cost?

commercial possibilities?

235

- It's not for man to trifle with.
- You carry on like Hillyer and Kemp.

236
