1
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:58,384
This is Paris.

2
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:01,053
And I'm an American
who lives here.

3
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:02,805
My name, Jerry Mulligan...

4
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,723
... and I'm an ex-G.I.

5
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:08,269
In 1945, when the Army
told me to find my own job...

6
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:09,520
... I stayed on.

7
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,063
And I'll tell you why.

8
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:12,690
I'm a painter.

9
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,901
All my life that's all
I've ever wanted to do.

10
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:18,863
For a painter,
the mecca of the world for study...

11
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:20,906
... for inspiration and for living...

12
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:26,078
... is here on this star called Paris.

13
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:27,830
Just look at it.

14
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,459
No wonder so many artists
have come here and called it home.

15
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,464
Brother, if you can't paint in Paris,
give up and marry the boss' daughter.

16
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:40,926
We're on the Left Bank now.
That's where I'm billeted.

17
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:43,095
Here's my street.

18
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,722
In the past couple of years...

19
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:47,099
... I've gotten to know
practically everyone on the block.

20
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:50,060
And a nicer bunch
you'll never meet.

21
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:53,105
Back home everyone
said I didn't have any talent.

22
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:55,566
They might be saying
the same thing over here...

23
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:58,444
... but it sounds better in French.

24
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:01,864
I live upstairs.

25
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,076
No, not there.

26
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:07,912
One flight up.

27
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:43,174
Jerry!

28
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,885
Those are three of my pals.

29
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:49,221
Etienne, Maurice and Jacques.

30
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:54,518
I'm their man because
I give them American bubble gum.

31
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:57,855
I have a lot of
good friends in Paris.

32
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:00,524
A lot of very good friends.

33
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,276
And I am one of them.

34
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:04,320
Adam Cook is my name.

35
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,905
I'm a concert pianist.

36
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:10,242
That's a pretentious way of
saying I'm unemployed at the moment.

37
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:15,748
I live in the same brick pile
with young Rembrandt.

38
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:17,708
That's not me.

39
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,710
He's too happy.

40
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,337
I'm here on a scholarship.

41
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:25,132
Last year, I won the Hackenwall prize
and was sent abroad to study.

42
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:28,511
That's the eighth fellowship I've won.
And you know something?

43
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,596
I'm getting pretty homesick.

44
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:37,103
Not only that, but I'm beginning to feel
like the world's oldest child prodigy.

45
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:42,149
One time I ran out of fellowships
and had to go to work for a living.

46
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,819
I had to stop because
I discovered I liked it...

47
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:48,697
... and I didn't want to become
a slave to the habit.

48
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,950
It's not a pretty face, I grant you.

49
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,330
But underneath its flabby exterior
is an enormous lack of character.

50
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,124
I like Paris.

51
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:00,209
It's a place where you don't
run into old friends.

52
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:03,462
Although that's never
been one of my problems.

53
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:07,341
Strangely enough, I made a friend
over here once. I worked for him.

54
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:09,343
His name was Henri Baurel.

55
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:11,929
You know, the French music hall star?

56
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:14,807
Do you remember him?

57
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,477
I do, because that's me.

58
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:22,690
Adam was a fine accompanist.
I wish he were still with me.

59
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,027
My, how nice to be
in the old quarter!

60
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,157
You see?
Everybody recognizes me.

61
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:33,200
I guess I haven't changed
so much after all.

62
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,453
They've known me a long time.

63
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:37,246
But now, don't misunderstand.

64
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,331
I don't mean
to imply that I am old.

65
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:42,334
I'm not.
After all, I am only...

66
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:45,212
Well, what's the difference?

67
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:49,800
No, that's not me.
I am not that young.

68
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,302
Let's just say...

69
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:55,890
... I am old enough to know what to do
with my young feelings.

70
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,726
Right?

71
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:05,524
- Georges!
- Henri Baurel!

72
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:15,034
- Henri!
- Mathilde!

73
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,964
Adam?

74
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,231
You used to
sing it a tone higher.

75
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:48,150
I'm a big boy now.
My voice is changing.

76
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,611
- Shall I come up?
- No, I'll be right down.

77
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:54,115
Hey, Georges,
some coffee!

78
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:59,703
Henri, I'm going to
make you an "omelette á la confiture".

79
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,416
Don't kiss me.
You'll spoil my makeup.

80
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,667
You look great, Hank.

81
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,627
What're you doing?
Taking injections?

82
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,087
Something much better.

83
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,422
I hear your show's a big hit.

84
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:12,091
It is, "naturellement".

85
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:13,801
- When did you get over?
- Last March.

86
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,302
I phoned you,
but there was no answer.

87
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:17,763
I'd have phoned again, but I was
afraid you might be in.

88
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,849
March? I wasn't in Paris then.

89
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,727
Lise and I were
visiting friends in Juan-les-Pins.

90
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:27,440
- Some coffee, please.
- What are you working on?

91
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,984
- Same old concert.
- When will you give it?

92
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:33,904
When I can't figure out
any more reasons not to.

93
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:36,657
Some coffee, please.

94
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:40,411
I took Lise to hear
Weingarten play the other night.

95
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:44,123
It was her first concert,
and her eyes were shining two days.

96
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:47,543
Why didn't you take her to an eye
doctor? Incidentally, who's Lise?

97
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,503
That's the second time
that name has come up.

98
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:51,964
Adam, I am very happy these days.

99
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:53,299
I'll show you her picture.

100
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,301
- Are you married?
- Not yet.

101
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,386
Pretty. Very pretty.

102
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,639
- She looks familiar.
- She's Jacques Bouvier's daughter.

103
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,809
Jacques Bouvier?

104
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:10,274
My coffee.

105
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,321
Poor Jacques.
He was caught in the Resistance.

106
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:19,033
I took care of Lise all through
the occupation. She lived in my house.

107
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:20,409
Your house?

108
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,827
Shocking, but generous.

109
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,537
She was a little girl then.

110
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:27,249
We only became
in love after she left.

111
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,126
She's a little young for you,
isn't she?

112
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,587
No, not really. She's 19.

113
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,672
She's getting on.
What's she like?

114
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:37,051
Well, she has great vitality
and "joie de vivre".

115
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:41,222
She loves to go out, have fun and
dance. She could dance all night.

116
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:43,390
Sounds tiresome.
Kind of a wild kid, huh?

117
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:46,852
Wild?
Whatever gave you that idea?

118
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:48,312
No, she's very simple.

119
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:50,189
Very simple.

120
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:53,192
She works all day
at the Maison Nicole, the perfume shop.

121
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:56,028
I prefer not to
discuss the matter any further.

122
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:57,863
Be serious.

123
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:00,157
She's an enchanting girl, Adam.

124
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:06,122
Not really beautiful,
and yet, she has great beauty.

125
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:27,560
Very spiritual type, huh?

126
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,894
Not at all.

127
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:32,857
She's an exciting girl, Adam.

128
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:56,046
She seems to be
a lusty young lady.

129
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:59,717
No! She's sweet and shy.

130
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:14,732
An old-fashioned girl, huh?

131
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:16,233
Course not!

132
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:20,321
She's vivacious and modern.

133
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,204
Always yakking it up?

134
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,750
Don't be silly!
She reads incessantly.

135
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:05,116
Doesn't all that reading
make her moody?

136
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:10,454
Never.
She's the gayest girl in the world.

137
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:53,622
Look, let's start
all over again, shall we?

138
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,917
What's she like?

139
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:00,004
Good morning, Therese.

140
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:01,338
How are you today, "monsieur"?

141
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:03,090
I could be better, Therese.
I'm broke.

142
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,384
- Broke?
- That means I have no money.

143
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:09,013
When I'm broke I don't eat.
Then I get tired and depressed.

144
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:11,849
When that happens, the only thing
that helps is wine and women.

145
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:14,894
That should be very simple.
You are in Paris.

146
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:17,062
But even in Paris
that takes money...

147
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:21,692
...which is what
I don't have in the first place.

148
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:23,819
This isn't music!

149
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,238
It's uncivilized.
It's noise.

150
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:28,282
- Hi!
- Hi.

151
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:31,285
Jerry, this is Henri Baurel.
Jerry Mulligan.

152
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:32,953
How do you do?
I know you.

153
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:35,414
I've heard you sing a thousand times.
You're wonderful.

154
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:36,665
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

155
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,751
Do you have
300 francs on you?

156
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,878
I'm going to Montmartre.
I need lunch money.

157
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:43,714
Sorry. Bought a postage stamp
and it broke me.

158
00:13:43,964 --> 00:13:44,924
Please allow me.

159
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:46,175
No, thanks.

160
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,136
I never touch a guy
unless I've known him 15 minutes.

161
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:54,266
I've known him 15 years.
Lend me 300.

162
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,147
I wouldn't lend him money if I were
you. He's a bum risk.

163
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:04,485
Adam! For this you win a scholarship?

164
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,279
What's the matter?
Evidently the man doesn't like jazz.

165
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,156
- He's against it.
- What else is there?

166
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,119
I know what he likes.
He's strictly a three-quarter man.

167
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:14,495
Old Vienna.

168
00:14:14,745 --> 00:14:16,997
Franz Josef!

169
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:19,875
The Palace of Schönbrunn.

170
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:24,588
- Kaffee with Schlagsahne.
- And Wienerschnitzel.

171
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,510
- Dog!
- Pig!

172
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:14,430
My card!

173
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,293
Gentlemen!
The Emperor!

174
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:34,064
Relax, sister.
I'm from Perth Amboy, New Jersey.

175
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:38,694
I can see disregarding perspective
to achieve an effect, but I believe...

176
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,363
Why don't you be
a good little girl and move on?

177
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,575
You won't buy anything.
You're just blocking out the sunshine.

178
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,952
I just wanted
to discuss your work.

179
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:49,330
I don't want you
to discuss my work.

180
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,166
I'm not interested
in your opinion of my work.

181
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,668
If you say something nice
I won't feel better...

182
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:56,087
...and if you don't
it'll bother me.

183
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:59,673
Thank you. Good day.

184
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:02,968
Do you mind if I look...

185
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,012
...or will you chew
my head off too?

186
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:06,472
Go ahead.
You're okay.

187
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:07,765
Thank you.

188
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:10,309
She's a third-year girl
that gripes my liver.

189
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,644
Third-year girls?

190
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,229
You know, American college kids.

191
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,315
They come here to take their third
year and lap up some culture.

192
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:17,858
They give me a swift pain.

193
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:19,610
Why?
They're harmless enough.

194
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,320
They're officious and dull.

195
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,909
They always make profound
observations they've overheard.

196
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:28,953
Say, do you have
a cigarette?

197
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:31,872
- I think so.
- Thanks.

198
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:33,958
Don't you like criticism?

199
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:39,213
Who does? Tough enough getting
it from those who know.

200
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:44,385
My first today.

201
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:46,762
My guess is the business
isn't very good.

202
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,683
Your guess is
right on the nose.

203
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,363
You know...

204
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,323
...I like these two.

205
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:08,284
Thanks. So do I.

206
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,537
I want to buy them.

207
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:14,665
How much are they?

208
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,250
Gee, I don't know.

209
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,752
You don't know?

210
00:21:18,002 --> 00:21:22,089
I never thought I'd come to the point
where that would be an issue.

211
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:24,133
Offer me something.

212
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,553
15,000 francs.

213
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:30,055
For each.

214
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:31,932
Will that be satisfactory?

215
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:34,602
That'll be
good and satisfactory.

216
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:36,312
You sure you know what you're doing?

217
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,732
What do you care?

218
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:41,901
That's about $50 apiece,
isn't it?

219
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:44,570
I don't know.
I haven't changed money lately.

220
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,780
Oh, dear!

221
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,617
- What's the matter?
- I haven't got enough with me.

222
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:52,912
Come back tomorrow.
It's a cinch they'll still be here.

223
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:56,457
Why don't you come to the hotel?
I can pay you there.

224
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:58,125
Fine. Is it far?

225
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,712
Would you care if it were?

226
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:09,470
- What's your name?
- Jerry Mulligan. Yours?

227
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,138
Milo Roberts.

228
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:15,184
- Milo?
- Yeah, as in "Venus de".

229
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,270
Venus de.

230
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:22,358
Is this yours?

231
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:27,154
Maybe I should have
charged you more.

232
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:44,755
I'll be back.
Make yourself at home.

233
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,188
Here.

234
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:02,773
Thanks.

235
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:07,570
- Would you like some sherry?
- All right.

236
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,406
How'd you come by
these worldly possessions?

237
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,241
A rich husband or father?

238
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,534
A father.

239
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:15,745
- What's he do?
- Oil.

240
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,455
I should have known.

241
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:19,206
Suntan oil.

242
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:22,585
Really? I didn't know
there was so much in that racket.

243
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,880
- There's a lot of red skin in America.
- There must be.

244
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,966
Let's see now.
Where shall I hang these?

245
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:30,426
Maybe over on...

246
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:33,053
Here's a good place.
Good light.

247
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:34,764
Not too much sun.

248
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,891
That'll be fine.

249
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:39,518
By golly, you know, these are good!

250
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:41,562
I've seen hundreds of paintings
by young artists...

251
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,064
...and not one has
impressed me till these!

252
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:46,817
I'm glad.
Makes it easier to give up.

253
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,069
Give up?

254
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,447
It's kind of hard
for an artist to sell.

255
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:55,284
A writer, a composer can
buy a copy of what they create.

256
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,620
With a painter,
it's the original that counts.

257
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,164
Once that's gone,
it's out of his life.

258
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:02,917
I never thought of that.

259
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:06,212
Excuse me for a minute.

260
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:08,964
Hello, Tommy.

261
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,508
No, dear.
Don't come up.

262
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:13,427
Be a darling and wait
for me in the dining room.

263
00:24:13,677 --> 00:24:16,263
I'll be right down.

264
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:18,182
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stay long.

265
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,184
Don't apologize.
I wanted you to.

266
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:22,978
I wish we had more time to talk.

267
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,731
Goodbye, and thanks again.

268
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:27,650
By the way...

269
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,443
...what are you going to do tonight?

270
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:30,653
Why?

271
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,155
I'm giving
a small party here.

272
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:36,117
There'll be an extra girl.
Why not come?

273
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:37,326
I don't know.

274
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,724
Do you have a date?

275
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,872
Well, then come.

276
00:24:42,123 --> 00:24:44,583
You'll find the company very easy.
Nothing formal.

277
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,461
- Be here at eight.
- Okay.

278
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:52,383
My car can take you home.
He has nothing to do.

279
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,386
Thanks.

280
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:09,692
Me, me!

281
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:30,004
Jerry, do you have any bubble gum?

282
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,345
"Demain." Tomorrow.

283
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:41,849
Tomorrow.

284
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:57,114
- Répétez aprés moi. "Door."
- Door!

285
00:25:57,364 --> 00:25:59,283
- Street.
- Street!

286
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,577
- Lady.
- Lady!

287
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,537
- Window.
- Window!

288
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:07,500
- Flowers.
- Flowers!

289
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:16,801
"Monsieur le" wise guy.

290
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:19,261
A very hard word.

291
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:22,473
Massachusetts!

292
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,021
An American song.

293
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:33,609
- I got.
- I got.

294
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,821
Good.

295
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:46,992
Charleston!

296
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,925
Choo-choo train!

297
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,143
Soldier!

298
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:22,820
Napoleon!

299
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,906
Cowboy!

300
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:30,494
Hopalong Cassidy!

301
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:55,895
- Charles!
- Charlie Chaplin!

302
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:03,444
Airplane!

303
00:30:11,368 --> 00:30:14,872
More!

304
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:35,434
- Good evening. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Good evening.

305
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:37,144
The moment I went to dress...

306
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:40,147
...the phone started ringing
like a steeple on Sunday.

307
00:30:40,397 --> 00:30:41,398
Would you like one of these?

308
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:43,150
Fine, fine.

309
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,070
I've never seen so many
Americans in Paris before.

310
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,532
The Champs Elysée looks
just like Main Street.

311
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:51,283
Do you live here
all the time?

312
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:57,456
I usually go home to Baltimore
for Christmas and Thanksgiving.

313
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:01,085
That's quite a dress
you almost have on.

314
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:03,629
- Thanks.
- What holds it up?

315
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:04,964
Modesty.

316
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:08,092
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

317
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:11,220
I see it's a formal brawl
after all.

318
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,471
What makes you think that?

319
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:15,558
The more formal the party is,
the less you have to wear.

320
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:18,686
No, you're quite wrong.
It's most informal.

321
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:20,813
Where is everybody?

322
00:31:21,063 --> 00:31:22,273
Here.

323
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:24,525
Downstairs?

324
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:27,820
No, here in this room.

325
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:31,365
What about that extra girl?

326
00:31:31,615 --> 00:31:34,368
That's me.

327
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,372
- The party's you and me?
- That's right.

328
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:42,001
I see. It's kind of
a little joke, isn't it?

329
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:44,962
In a way.

330
00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:47,339
Well, lady...

331
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,801
...here's your dough back. I'll take my
pictures and run along.

332
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:52,136
Wait a minute.

333
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:53,554
Wait, my foot!

334
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:56,015
You must be
out of your mink-lined head!

335
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:58,309
I know I need dough, but
I don't need it this badly.

336
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,852
If you're hard up for companionship...

337
00:32:00,102 --> 00:32:02,104
...they have guys in town who
do this for a living.

338
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,440
Call one of them.

339
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,691
What's so funny?

340
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:08,694
You! You're so righteous.

341
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:11,405
Stop defending your honor
so assiduously...

342
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:13,532
...and listen to me for a minute.

343
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:16,202
I don't need a paid escort.

344
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:20,372
And I'm not trying to rob you
of your precious male initiative.

345
00:32:20,623 --> 00:32:23,709
I'm interested in your work
and want to know you better.

346
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,419
Is that such a crime?

347
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:28,714
Well, it certainly is
a roundabout way to do it.

348
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:33,302
Would you have accepted
a normal invitation?

349
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:34,428
I want to help you.

350
00:32:34,678 --> 00:32:38,224
I think you have
a great deal of talent.

351
00:32:38,474 --> 00:32:41,185
It doesn't hurt to have
somebody rooting for you, does it?

352
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:45,981
- It'll be the first time anybody ever did.
- Then let me.

353
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:48,818
Please?

354
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,280
How's the food downstairs?

355
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:56,283
- Very good.
- And probably very expensive.

356
00:32:56,534 --> 00:32:59,203
Would it embarrass you
if I signed the check?

357
00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:00,955
Let's go someplace I can afford.

358
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:04,083
How about the Café Flodair
on Montparnasse?

359
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,544
I feel like "jazz hot".
It's not expensive.

360
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:08,254
It better not be.

361
00:33:08,504 --> 00:33:13,008
I'd like to show a little profit
at the end of the day.

362
00:33:31,652 --> 00:33:33,237
How long did it last?

363
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:35,281
About two years.

364
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:36,907
I lost him in the war.

365
00:33:37,158 --> 00:33:38,576
I'm sorry.

366
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:40,661
To another woman.

367
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:43,038
Somebody he met in California
while he was in training.

368
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,957
If he was the dog you
said he was...

369
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:46,834
...you must have been glad
to be rid of him.

370
00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:49,128
I was, I guess, except that I...

371
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:51,714
Except it would have been
more satisfactory...

372
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,174
...if you could have kissed him off.

373
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:54,508
I guess.

374
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,886
You should get married again.
You need it.

375
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,262
- Why?
- Everybody does.

376
00:33:58,512 --> 00:34:00,389
Everybody must
have someone to account to.

377
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:03,517
Especially when you don't work.
It keeps the personality together.

378
00:34:03,768 --> 00:34:05,436
No, thank you.
Not for me.

379
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:07,855
- Besides, I have work to do.
- What?

380
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:09,982
Well, for the moment, you.

381
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:12,526
I want to bring you
to the attention of dealers.

382
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:14,945
They know me.
I'm a big customer.

383
00:34:15,196 --> 00:34:16,781
We have a large collection at home.

384
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:18,824
I could sponsor you...

385
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:21,410
...talk about you, encourage you.

386
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,039
When you've done enough canvases
I could arrange your first show.

387
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:27,416
That is, if you'll let me.

388
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,211
It sounds great,
but what's in it for you?

389
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:33,714
Just the excitement of
helping somebody I believe in...

390
00:34:33,964 --> 00:34:37,301
...and finding out if I'm right.

391
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:40,179
- Milo, darling.
- Tommy! I knew you'd turn up here.

392
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,639
This is Jerry Mulligan.

393
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:45,392
This is Tommy Baldwin.
He's on the "Paris Telegram".

394
00:34:45,643 --> 00:34:49,188
Milo, I'm showing the Jansens
around and need your help.

395
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:51,357
What do you say?
Shall we go to his rescue?

396
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:52,566
Anything you like.

397
00:34:52,817 --> 00:34:57,571
Follow me. You need radar to
find your way in this smoke.

398
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:06,580
- Who are the Jansens?
- Magazine illustrators.

399
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:10,459
- What're they like?
- Death.

400
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:17,883
- Look what I found.
- What a pleasant surprise!

401
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:22,012
- Jack, say hello to Milo.
- Hello, Milo.

402
00:35:22,263 --> 00:35:24,181
This is Jerry Mulligan.
Jerry, the Jansens.

403
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:25,558
How do you do?

404
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:30,104
Isn't this the chap you
told me about at lunch?

405
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:32,648
Waiter, two more glasses, please.

406
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:34,775
Milo says you're quite wonderful.

407
00:35:35,025 --> 00:35:36,569
I'd love to see
some of your pictures.

408
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:40,156
I'm having a private showing
tomorrow on a corner in Montmartre.

409
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:41,741
You paint?

410
00:35:41,991 --> 00:35:44,410
So do we. Jack and I.
We work together.

411
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,828
Well, that's cozy.

412
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:48,748
Dance, you two.
I want to talk to Milo.

413
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:50,750
Come on, Jack.

414
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,252
Have fun.

415
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:57,298
There's a special doll over there.
Do you know who she is?

416
00:35:57,548 --> 00:36:00,426
No. But she is lovely,
isn't she?

417
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:02,094
She sure is.

418
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:04,597
I'm very anxious
for you to see Jerry's work.

419
00:36:04,847 --> 00:36:07,141
If you like it, you can get
him a mention on the art page.

420
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:08,559
Nothing to it.

421
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:10,102
- Lise.
- What?

422
00:36:10,352 --> 00:36:13,022
Her name is Lise.

423
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:17,735
Let's dance.
We haven't for years.

424
00:36:18,235 --> 00:36:21,113
Excuse me, Jerry.

425
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:32,583
You're going to have trouble
with that one.

426
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:36,337
No, I'm not.
He's just not housebroken yet.

427
00:36:36,587 --> 00:36:39,090
When will you stop involving
yourself with young artists?

428
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,800
It never works.

429
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,719
If they're no good, you're ashamed.
If they are, they get too independent.

430
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,596
Just dance, Tommy, please.

431
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:47,932
All right. But I warn you,
he'll be out in four months...

432
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:51,977
...just like the composer
and the sculptor.

433
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:12,331
Lise! I didn't
see you sitting here!

434
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:13,999
What a pleasant surprise!

435
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,210
My wife and I were talking...

436
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,754
...and were wondering
what happened to her.

437
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:23,300
Let's go around the floor
for old time's sake. Do you mind?

438
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,931
You're certainly not
without your nerve!

439
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:32,226
Don't get angry.
This was perfectly harmless.

440
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:36,063
I haven't been able to take
my eyes off you since I walked in.

441
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:39,108
I only let you do this because
I didn't want a disturbance.

442
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:40,776
And I don't have a wife.

443
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:43,237
I threw that in to
make it look respectable.

444
00:37:43,487 --> 00:37:45,322
That was very considerate.

445
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,992
Please, I would like to
return to my table.

446
00:37:48,242 --> 00:37:50,995
In a minute.

447
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:05,926
I revise my estimate.

448
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:09,346
Make that two months.

449
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:16,479
This is the first time
I've done anything like this.

450
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:20,608
At least as a civilian.
I just had to meet you.

451
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:24,028
I don't know what type of girl
you think I am, but I'm not!

452
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:26,864
And now I would like
to return to my friends.

453
00:38:27,114 --> 00:38:29,867
I thought you were bored with them.
You sure looked it.

454
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:33,245
You should see me now.

455
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:37,625
The music has stopped.

456
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:41,420
The elements are against me.

457
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:45,299
It was swell seeing you again.
I'll tell Elaine to call you.

458
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:47,218
What was your phone number?

459
00:38:47,468 --> 00:38:49,512
It slipped my mind
the moment you said it.

460
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,722
Opera 2-5-7-4.

461
00:38:51,972 --> 00:38:55,684
No, Lise. 2-4-7-5.

462
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:58,687
Thank you.

463
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:01,607
Good night.

464
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:12,326
Well, I'm tired.
Good night.

465
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:14,161
Good night, darling.
I'll call you.

466
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:15,621
Say good night to Milo.

467
00:39:15,871 --> 00:39:17,289
- Good night, Milo.
- Good night, Jack.

468
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,041
Don't I owe you something
for the wine?

469
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,294
Forget it. You do it next time.
If there is one.

470
00:39:22,545 --> 00:39:24,547
Good night.

471
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:27,716
Good night.

472
00:39:35,182 --> 00:39:36,934
- That was fun, wasn't it?
- Was it?

473
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:39,019
That's a fascinating place.

474
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,021
I'd like to hang around
and paint it.

475
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:43,357
I can imagine
all the work you'll get done.

476
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:45,317
You've already painted
a Montmartre dive...

477
00:39:45,568 --> 00:39:47,570
...and it wasn't successful.
- Wait a minute.

478
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,697
Don't tell me how
and what to paint.

479
00:39:49,947 --> 00:39:52,199
I didn't like
your exhibition tonight!

480
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,534
I thought you were very rude.

481
00:39:53,784 --> 00:39:56,203
Rude? I didn't mean
to be. I'm sorry.

482
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:58,164
Picking up stray women
is your own affair...

483
00:39:58,414 --> 00:40:01,041
...but don't do it with me.
Is that clear?

484
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:03,794
That's clear. That's very clear.
Stop the car.

485
00:40:04,044 --> 00:40:06,589
Sensitive artists!
You're touchy about yourself...

486
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,299
...but oblivious of others.

487
00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:10,342
You don't understand
how they feel.

488
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:11,802
It's been fun.

489
00:40:12,052 --> 00:40:13,554
Sorry you're stuck
with the pictures.

490
00:40:13,804 --> 00:40:18,017
- I still like the pictures.
- Thanks a lot.

491
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:35,367
Jerry Mulligan.

492
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:38,662
I met you at the Café Flodair
last night. Remember?

493
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:40,289
You!

494
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:41,916
Yeah, me.

495
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:45,377
It's a beautiful day and I thought
I could drop by and...

496
00:40:45,628 --> 00:40:48,714
Well, now, one moment, Mr. Mooligan.

497
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:50,007
Mulligan.

498
00:40:50,257 --> 00:40:51,801
Last night you were an annoyance.

499
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:54,095
But today you're growing
into a nuisance.

500
00:40:54,345 --> 00:40:59,350
Now please leave me alone and don't
call me again, ever.

501
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:29,964
Good morning.

502
00:41:30,214 --> 00:41:32,007
Good morning.

503
00:41:32,258 --> 00:41:33,342
Would you care for...

504
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,011
No, thanks.
I've had my breakfast already.

505
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:37,972
I've been up for hours...

506
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:40,349
...working, I might add, for you.

507
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,560
Do you know Jules Parmentier,
the art dealer?

508
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,769
I know of him.

509
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:48,274
He came to the hotel
and had coffee this morning.

510
00:41:48,357 --> 00:41:51,026
I showed him your pictures.
He was very impressed.

511
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:53,404
He thought you
had great individuality.

512
00:41:53,654 --> 00:41:55,030
He thought they were fresh.

513
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:56,866
- That's wonderful.
- Not only that...

514
00:41:57,116 --> 00:41:59,076
...but he wants to talk
about your show.

515
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:01,787
- That's a long way off.
- Maybe not such a long way.

516
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:04,165
I don't have near enough
for an exhibition.

517
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,042
- What I do have, I'm not sure...
- That's not important.

518
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:10,504
Then I went to the Marais Galleries
and talked to Louis Dufond.

519
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:12,298
He's a very old friend of mine.

520
00:42:12,548 --> 00:42:15,926
He's coming tomorrow
to see your pictures.

521
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:20,514
You don't waste any time, do you?

522
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:24,185
I hope not.

523
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:28,022
Come with me and we'll
talk about it over lunch?

524
00:42:28,272 --> 00:42:30,941
I've something to do
this morning...

525
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:32,651
...but I could meet you.

526
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:35,905
How about the Restaurant Paul
on the Avenue de la Paix?

527
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:39,492
I'll see you there at one.

528
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:43,621
I'm sorry about that
little tiff last night.

529
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:46,749
I was tired I guess.

530
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:48,751
Forget it.

531
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:53,339
- I did.
- You did? That's not very nice of you.

532
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:56,467
See you at one.

533
00:43:11,816 --> 00:43:15,361
Very nice for a summer perfume.

534
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:21,283
This is a little heavy.

535
00:43:21,534 --> 00:43:23,536
I'll show you something else.

536
00:43:23,786 --> 00:43:25,871
What's that one on the right?

537
00:43:26,122 --> 00:43:30,000
- This one?
- No, the other.

538
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:34,088
This is very nice.
It's called...

539
00:43:34,338 --> 00:43:36,715
It's called Escapade.

540
00:43:36,966 --> 00:43:40,511
There's a saleslady free at the
other end of the shop, "monsieur".

541
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:43,389
Thank you, but what I want
is at this end.

542
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:47,518
I don't know which to choose.
They're both lovely.

543
00:43:47,768 --> 00:43:49,728
I wish my husband were here.

544
00:43:49,979 --> 00:43:52,314
He's so fussy about the way I smell.

545
00:43:52,565 --> 00:43:55,317
Why don't you bring him later
and decide then?

546
00:43:55,568 --> 00:43:56,861
That's an excellent idea.

547
00:43:57,111 --> 00:43:59,363
He's in Milwaukee.

548
00:43:59,613 --> 00:44:02,324
Dear, oh, dear.
I hate decisions.

549
00:44:02,575 --> 00:44:05,661
I always get a rash if I
have to decide something.

550
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:07,371
Let me help you.

551
00:44:07,621 --> 00:44:09,457
I'd have the man's point of view.

552
00:44:09,707 --> 00:44:11,834
Yes, that's a good idea. Here.

553
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:15,463
See which one you like.

554
00:44:16,464 --> 00:44:19,216
Not bad.

555
00:44:20,843 --> 00:44:21,969
This is it.

556
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:24,096
"Nuit d'Amour." Night of Love.

557
00:44:24,346 --> 00:44:26,223
- No contest, lady.
- Really?

558
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:30,269
Wear that and the Frenchmen will
never let you go back to Milwaukee.

559
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:31,771
I'll take it.

560
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:34,482
Would you send it to my hotel,
collect?

561
00:44:34,732 --> 00:44:39,111
I'm Mrs. Edna Mae Benstrom.
I'm at the Granville.

562
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,863
Here's my card.

563
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:42,239
Thank you.

564
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,451
I think I'll put a little on.

565
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:47,453
It is good, isn't it?

566
00:44:47,703 --> 00:44:49,163
You'll need protection.

567
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,248
I hope so.

568
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:53,918
You've been very kind.
Thank you.

569
00:44:54,168 --> 00:44:55,961
Thank you both. Good day.

570
00:44:56,212 --> 00:44:57,797
Good day.

571
00:44:58,047 --> 00:45:00,132
Now, "monsieur", what
can I do for you?

572
00:45:00,382 --> 00:45:03,052
You know what you can do
for me. Go out with me.

573
00:45:03,302 --> 00:45:04,762
How do you know I'm not married?

574
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:08,766
That finger on your left
hand is awfully naked.

575
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:11,811
It's a pity you don't have as much
charm as persistence.

576
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:14,355
I do. You've only seen
my aggressive side.

577
00:45:14,605 --> 00:45:16,982
I have a lighter side.
I'm loaded with charm.

578
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:20,319
I go to parties, put on hats
and do funny things.

579
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:24,115
You see? What do you say?
Come on.

580
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:26,992
All right. You win.

581
00:45:27,243 --> 00:45:29,161
You can take me for lunch.

582
00:45:29,412 --> 00:45:32,039
I can't. How about dinner?

583
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:33,666
No. That's not possible.

584
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:35,376
You have a date?

585
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:40,464
What about after dinner?
Say, nine o'clock?

586
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:42,758
I guess it would be all right.

587
00:45:43,008 --> 00:45:46,887
- I'll pick you up.
- No. I'll meet you somewhere.

588
00:45:47,138 --> 00:45:48,889
Do you know the Café Bel-Ami?

589
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,474
By the bridge?

590
00:45:50,724 --> 00:45:54,979
- I'll see you there at nine.
- Fine.

591
00:45:55,604 --> 00:45:58,858
There is no happier man in Paris
than "Monsieur" Mulligan.

592
00:45:59,108 --> 00:46:02,027
At this moment.

593
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:19,962
Madame, you're delicious!

594
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,905
One's company, two's a crowd.
You get it?

595
00:46:50,993 --> 00:46:52,787
Disappear!
Don't you see I'm busy?

596
00:46:53,037 --> 00:46:56,165
Hit the boulevard!

597
00:48:46,734 --> 00:48:49,820
Look! One hand.

598
00:50:20,536 --> 00:50:22,288
Hello. What's new?

599
00:50:22,538 --> 00:50:23,706
Who is this?

600
00:50:23,956 --> 00:50:25,750
- Guess.
- Oh, Adam!

601
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,419
You always call at the wrong moment.

602
00:50:28,669 --> 00:50:31,922
Wrong moment? You make me feel
like a rejected child.

603
00:50:32,173 --> 00:50:34,258
When's the new number
going into the show?

604
00:50:34,508 --> 00:50:36,302
The new number goes in tonight.

605
00:50:36,552 --> 00:50:38,137
What? Tonight, Henri?

606
00:50:38,387 --> 00:50:39,889
Yes, darling, tonight.

607
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:42,433
Are you having a party?
Need an extra man?

608
00:50:42,683 --> 00:50:45,561
No, I was talking to Lise,
my dinner guest.

609
00:50:45,811 --> 00:50:48,314
Give me a rundown on that menu.

610
00:50:48,564 --> 00:50:49,982
What're you having to eat?

611
00:50:50,232 --> 00:50:51,942
Magnificent pheasant.

612
00:50:52,193 --> 00:50:54,695
I can drop everything
and be up in ten minutes.

613
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:56,739
That is, if I'm not intruding.

614
00:50:56,989 --> 00:51:01,202
No, no. I see you later at the cafe.
Goodbye.

615
00:51:01,452 --> 00:51:03,746
I'm hungry.

616
00:51:03,996 --> 00:51:05,915
That Adam.
He'll never change.

617
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:09,168
What's the matter, darling?
Can't you come tonight?

618
00:51:09,418 --> 00:51:11,796
If you can't,
it's all right, darling.

619
00:51:12,046 --> 00:51:13,047
Don't worry.

620
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:18,052
- No. Of course, I want to come.
- You are a doll.

621
00:51:35,528 --> 00:51:37,822
Would you...

622
00:51:38,072 --> 00:51:41,075
Yes, thank you.

623
00:51:42,535 --> 00:51:44,203
I wasn't sure you'd come.

624
00:51:44,453 --> 00:51:47,206
I thought maybe you said yes
to get rid of me.

625
00:51:47,456 --> 00:51:50,209
Not that it would have.

626
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:53,712
What would you like?

627
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:57,591
Would you mind if we didn't sit here?

628
00:51:57,842 --> 00:52:01,929
- Why, no.
- Anything wrong, "monsieur"?

629
00:52:07,309 --> 00:52:08,436
I'm sorry.

630
00:52:08,686 --> 00:52:13,774
That's all right. I didn't feel
like sitting there anyhow.

631
00:52:20,406 --> 00:52:22,074
Let's walk along the river.

632
00:52:22,324 --> 00:52:24,952
All right.

633
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:39,467
I have a big thing for this spot.

634
00:52:39,717 --> 00:52:41,552
One of these days
I'll paint it.

635
00:52:41,802 --> 00:52:44,138
You're a painter?

636
00:52:44,388 --> 00:52:46,140
You don't look like a painter.

637
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:49,143
There are those who'll say
I don't paint like one either.

638
00:52:49,393 --> 00:52:52,646
But that doesn't bother me.
Discouragement stimulates me.

639
00:52:52,897 --> 00:52:55,649
That much about you, I know.

640
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,651
Yes, you do, don't you?

641
00:52:57,902 --> 00:52:59,945
But mark me well,
one of these days...

642
00:53:00,196 --> 00:53:02,823
...the world will ring
with the name Mulligan.

643
00:53:03,074 --> 00:53:06,243
Picasso will be remembered
as the forerunner of Mulligan.

644
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:10,873
This tree will be famous because
it was painted by Mulligan.

645
00:53:11,123 --> 00:53:13,959
And when will this
golden age of art be?

646
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:17,171
Well, it's hard to say.
It's hard to say.

647
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:22,551
Civilization has a natural resistance
against improving itself.

648
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:24,512
It might take quite a while.

649
00:53:24,762 --> 00:53:28,015
Quite a while.

650
00:53:32,103 --> 00:53:34,480
- How do you feel now?
- Why?

651
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:38,025
A moment ago you were acting like
the police were after you.

652
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:40,528
I was, wasn't I?

653
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:42,780
Why?

654
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,865
No. Never mind, never mind.

655
00:53:45,116 --> 00:53:47,535
Don't try to think up
what to tell me.

656
00:53:47,785 --> 00:53:52,206
I don't have to know.
It's your business.

657
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:54,687
Candy. Would you like some?

658
00:53:54,722 --> 00:53:57,086
I couldn't eat a whole one.

659
00:53:57,336 --> 00:53:59,964
Go ahead. Try.

660
00:54:00,214 --> 00:54:03,050
The night's young.

661
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,846
We should live dangerously.

662
00:54:21,944 --> 00:54:24,697
Tell me some more.
