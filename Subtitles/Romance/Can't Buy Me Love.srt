- I think that's Ronald Miller.
- No way!

331
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,426
It must be a... transfer.

quite talkative this morning.

00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:43,260
Cindy, what were you doing
with the lawn boy?

361
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,963
- We're friends.

Excuse me, Cindy.
"Friends"? Come on.

I know that lunch was Part
of our deal, but I didn't think
it meant the same table.

373
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,366
Well, I thought it would be
a little more believable.

374

- Yeah, I guess you're right.
Anyway, you did treat.
- Yes.

Ronnie, do you want me
to give you a ride home after school?

495
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,430
- Yes, Please. Thank you.
- Okay, I'll see you then.

496
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:40,000
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

497
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,946
- How was your weekend?
- It was great. How was yours?

498
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,974
Well, uh, Friday, uh...

499
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:52,216
I nearly got my face
rearranged by a visiting fan
trying to save ya a seat.

500
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,919
And Saturday,
you stood us uP for cards.

501
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,928
And, hey, Sunday, never
returned any of my calls.

502
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,328
- Damn. I'm sorry.
- Yeah? For which one?

503
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,265
I said I'm sorry.
Can we Please terminate this?

504
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,734
Fine.

505
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,671
Hey, hey, Kenneth.
Kenneth, Kenneth, Kenneth!

506
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,504
Let's do somethin' this weekend,
just me and you.

507
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,510
Okay, Friday night.

508
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,638
- I can't.
- Saturday.

509
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,682
Well, I was thinkin'
more like Sunday afternoon.

510
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,514
Great. I'll call you
for an aPPointment.

511
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:26,148
Oh, great. All right.
I'll see you Sunday.

Yo, gentlemen. Hey!
How's it goin'?

[Laughs]

514
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:37,968
You know, when I offered you
a ride home, it wasn't
to get you to wash my car.

515
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:42,837
- I don't mind.
Actually, I kind of like it.
- You're a hard worker.

516
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,068
Work's not really my thing.

517
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,475
Cheerleading's hard work.
You do it well.

518
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:51,811
I guess. But what I mean is
that I don't do much else...

I believe that.

523
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,470
Um, I'll be right back.
Do you want anything from
the kitchen or anything?

out one of my favorite Places.

The Navy found this one last year
off the coast of JaPan.

He came back a few weeks ago
to take a look at this.

at this thing the whole day.

mountains up there.

there that looks like a star saPPhire?

- What's that?
- Tycho.

and broke the moon.

- Broke the moon?
- Yeah.

593
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:31,754

a hundred times the size
of the Grand Canyon.

is our future world.

I'm new at all this. I'm gonna
have to rely on your exPerience.

Right.

00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,656

whoever believed it.

Us going out?
You, me? Yeah, right.

621
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:34,003
Yeah, it does seem
kind of unrealistic.

622
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:38,606

Okay, so, how shall we do it?

623
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,878
Stage a big fight?
A lovers' quarrel?

624
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,648
No, we don't have anything
to fight about.

625
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:48,556
Oh, that's okay. We can
make something uP. Let's see.
What do PeoPle fight about?

- RePutation?
- I think a small, dignified ceremony...

- is probably the best way...
- Me?

629
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,133
- to end it.
- With a rePutation.
Whoo! Yeah!

a little thinking too!

No, actually!
I did quite a bit of thinking!

you're breaking me.

01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:38,555
Pow!

1308
01:22:40,191 --> 01:22:42,125
[Cindy]
Would you stop it?

1309
01:22:42,193 --> 01:22:44,252
StoP it! The neighbors, man!

1310
01:22:44,329 --> 01:22:47,355
Listen, all right?
Hold on!Just turn it off!

1311
01:22:47,432 --> 01:22:51,835
My mother was calling
the Police, until I told her
you had a chemical imbalance...

1312
01:22:51,903 --> 01:22:53,996
and you are seeking
Psychiatric helP!

1313
01:22:54,072 --> 01:22:56,006
- [Panting]
I need to talk to you.
- Fine.

1314
01:22:56,074 --> 01:22:58,508
Every time I called,
you were either taking
a bath, washing your hair.

1315
01:22:58,576 --> 01:23:01,602
Or you were out of the country.
That was a good one, by the way.

1316
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:05,171
I tried to get you alone at school,
but I got a month's detention.

1317
01:23:05,249 --> 01:23:08,013
Yeah, you're very big
in bathrooms, aren't you?

1318
01:23:09,954 --> 01:23:15,449
Cindy, just hear me out.
And then I'll leave you alone. Okay?

1319
01:23:18,129 --> 01:23:21,826
Oh! You t... You demolished me
New Year's Eve.

1320
01:23:23,534 --> 01:23:29,166
But see...
I realize you did me a favor.
You brought me back to reality.

1321
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:33,438
All I ever wanted to do
was get close to you.

1322
01:23:35,546 --> 01:23:40,108
And then, when I finally got
there, it wasn't me anymore.

1323
01:23:41,853 --> 01:23:46,051
Cindy... Oh, Cindy.

1324
01:23:46,124 --> 01:23:49,582
I was just hoPing we could
sort this out, you know?

1325
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:54,996
The real me and the real you.
That's all.

1326
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,134
[Exhales]

1327
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:02,172
Okay.

1328
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,232
- But not at 6:00 in the morning.
-Okay.

1329
01:24:05,309 --> 01:24:07,903
I'll come back at 11:00.

1330
01:24:09,947 --> 01:24:14,611
I'll be washing my hair...
out of the country.

1331
01:24:14,685 --> 01:24:16,653
That's my favorite one.

1332
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:19,155
[Laughs Weakly]

1333
01:24:22,794 --> 01:24:25,820
[Starts, StoPs Lawn Mower]

1334
01:24:25,897 --> 01:24:28,798
Tell your mom I'm sorry.

1335
01:24:35,273 --> 01:24:37,468
[Sighs]
Is that right?

1336
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:40,033
- Good job.
- Really? Oh, my God!

1337
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:49,982
- What's haPPening, guys?
- Hey, nerd alert, man.
He's in our quadrant, too.

1338
01:24:50,054 --> 01:24:52,784
Kenneth Wurman with Patty?
No way!

1339
01:24:52,857 --> 01:24:56,156
Thanks so much! I swear,
I don't know what I would have
done without you. Really.

1340
01:24:56,227 --> 01:25:00,323
- No Problem.J-Just, uh, take
your time and follow the stePs.
- Okay.

1341
01:25:00,398 --> 01:25:04,164
Kenneth Worm-man is trying to
Pull a Ronald McDonald Miller
scam on us.

1342
01:25:04,235 --> 01:25:07,363
- He's probably trying
to pay her off.
- Relax, man. He's harmless.

1343
01:25:07,438 --> 01:25:09,668
I'm sending him back
to the minor leagues.

1344
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,674
- Be cool, man.
- Hey, calm down.

1345
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:15,470
Oh, man. He's gonna make
a fool of himself.

1346
01:25:15,546 --> 01:25:18,777
- Hey, what do you think you're
doing over here, twimP?
- H-HelPing her with some math.

1347
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:22,013
- No, bullshit. You're trying
to Pull a Ronald Miller scam.
- A what?

1348
01:25:22,086 --> 01:25:27,023
You better get back to your own
side, or I'm gonna send you back
to Geeksville in a milk carton!

1349
01:25:27,091 --> 01:25:30,356
Would you guys do something?

1350
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:38,667
- Oh, return of the living dread.
- Why don't you lay off?

1351
01:25:38,736 --> 01:25:41,500
- Why don't you go back
where you belong, hosehead?
- Take your hands off Kenneth.

1352
01:25:41,572 --> 01:25:43,506
Or I'll break your arm.
Your Pitching arm!

1353
01:25:43,574 --> 01:25:46,236
Oh yeah? Well, don't make me
laugh, lawn boy.

1354
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:48,904
Let go.

1355
01:25:50,248 --> 01:25:53,081
Now!

1356
01:25:57,622 --> 01:25:59,681
You broke your arm
once before, remember?

1357
01:25:59,757 --> 01:26:03,591
You fell out of our tree house.
Kenneth Picked you uP...

1358
01:26:03,661 --> 01:26:08,928
and we carried you 12 blocks
to the hosPital.
Yeah, you cried all the way.

1359
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,561
We were all friends then, remember?

1360
01:26:12,637 --> 01:26:15,231
And now you want to end his life...

1361
01:26:15,306 --> 01:26:19,037
because he's talking to Patty
on your side of the cafeteria.

1362
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:23,740
Oh, man, that's stupid. I know, 'cause
that's where I wanted to be.

1363
01:26:23,814 --> 01:26:28,183
On your side, with your crowd.
But I messed uP.

1364
01:26:28,252 --> 01:26:31,153
See, I tried to buy my way in.

1365
01:26:31,222 --> 01:26:35,022
But Kenneth...
he's not trying to buy anybody.

1366
01:26:36,294 --> 01:26:40,731
He's just trying
to make friends. Being himself.

1367
01:26:40,798 --> 01:26:44,461
Cools, nerds,
your side, my side.

1368
01:26:44,535 --> 01:26:49,097
Man, it's all bullshit.
It's just tough enough to be yourself.

1369
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:01,448
It's all right.

1370
01:27:15,533 --> 01:27:17,694
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1373
01:28:17,528 --> 01:28:20,190
This should cover it.

1374
01:28:31,776 --> 01:28:33,767
I saw a crack in the moon last night.

1375
01:28:33,844 --> 01:28:36,176

in advance: Will you go

1393
01:30:08,739 --> 01:30:12,106
Not if you do
