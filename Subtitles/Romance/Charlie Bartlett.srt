He's obviously highly motivated.

00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,672
Len, do you feel like making 50 bucks
after school today?

344
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,080
Fifty bucks.

345
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:25,988
(TIRES SQUEALING)

346
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,725
Hey!

347
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,333
What the hell is this?

348
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,997
- Charlie wants to talk to you.
- Suck this, mongoloid.

349
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,664
Get the hell off me! Fuck!

(GRUNTING)

351
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,941
Hi, Murphy. How are you?

352
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,571
You must have a fucking death wish!

353
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,276
Charlie says you gotta be nice.

354
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:50,082
Look, Murph, I think we got started off
on the wrong foot.

355
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,680
- I want to work things out.
- I'm gonna put you in the fucking hospital.

(GROANS)

357
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,087

- Fuck.

358
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,221
Len.

359
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,701
Listen, Murph, I've had a lot of time
to think about what you did to me.

360
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,535
Yeah? What did you come up with, genius?

361
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,337
I think you're angry, man.

362
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,003
What have I got to be angry about?

363
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,350
Maybe you got slapped around
one too many times

364
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,908
for lunch money on your way to the bus.

365
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,285
Maybe your pop's gotta
booze himself up every morning

366
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,688
so he can plow roads
with a sense of humor.

367
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,885
Then when he gets home, you're just

368
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,088
a distant third to Sloppy Joes
and a bad sitcom.

369
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:36,222
Maybe the cheerleaders call you
a scumbag behind your back.

370
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,296
Maybe it's because the school's
got you placed on the remedial track

371
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,535
and your teachers are really good
at making you feel like an idiot.

372
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,380
Maybe it's none of these things.

373
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,784
Maybe it's all of them.

374
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:02,688
- What do you want from me?
- I wanna be your friend, Murphy.

375
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,260
Okay, maybe you're not a total tool,

376
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:12,201
but guys like you and guys like me
can't be friends.

377
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,471
- Why's that?
- I take the train tracks home.

378
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,601
- You drive around in a limo.
- I guess you're right.

379
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:24,275
Look, I got 90 pills of Ritalin
that we could sell at the dance.

380
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,149
Maybe we're just gonna have to
settle for being business partners.

381
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,277
What do these do?

382
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,551
Floods the brain
with norepinephrine and dopamine.

383
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,286
It gets you high.

384
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,751
So, I figure $10 a pill, right?

385
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:38,887
We split the profit,

386
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,957
which means you make almost 500 bucks
without spending a nickel.

387
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,807
Business partners, huh?

388
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,037

389
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,105
What? What happens at 1:00?

390
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,152
- My curfew, at 1:00.
- Where are you going?

391
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:05,053
The dance, Dad. I'm going to the dance.
I told you last week.

392
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,124
- Have you given up your singing?
- No. Why?

393
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,889
I don't know, just...
You've got a great voice.

394
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,759
I used to love coming home
to hear you singing in the other room.

you were happy, I guess.

Have fun.

401
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,139
- I will. So, 2:00, right?
- Nice try.

when you were a history teacher.

- I'll see you guys in a minute.
- Okay.

- Hey, Susan.
- Hey.

of a dance tonight, or...

- Well, it's gone.

- Gone?
- All of it. Every last pill.

that we could maybe talk in private?

Yeah, I guess. Why? What's going on?

449
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,936
I'm, like, totally depressed.

450
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,532
I've been having these spells,
and trouble breathing,

451
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,201
mostly in class.

452
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,945
What does it feel like?

453
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,543
It feels like a heart attack.

454
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:30,014
But I'm thinking, you know,
it's probably mental.

455
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,114
And I can't go to my parents about it,

456
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,887
because they already think I'm a freak,
so I just thought that you...

457
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,588
Look, I'm not a doctor, but...

458
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:42,227
I don't know if Ritalin's gonna help you.

459
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,094
Do you know what would?

460
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,636
I'm not sure.

461
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,300
But I'm gonna find out.

462
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,301
I'm gonna work this out, I promise.

463
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,440
Yeah.

464
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,071
Thanks.

465
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:31,507
I get short of breath and dizzy,
you know, nausea, blurred vision.

466
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,710
I mean, sometimes it feels like
a heart attack.

467
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,186
Yeah, we call that a panic attack.

468
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,984
Oh, is that what they call it?

469
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,422
Well, what can we do?

470
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:44,928
Well, I think maybe
I'll put you on a low dose of

471
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,794
Xanax and Zoloft.

472
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,294
Okay, so, here's the thing.
In everything that I've read,

473
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,274
there's not one case of anyone dying
of a panic attack.

474
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,744
- No?
- No. Not one.

475
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,647
So the next time you start to feel anxious,
you just tell yourself,

476
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,949
"Hey, I'm having a panic attack.
I'm not gonna die.

477
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,752
"In fact, in 15 minutes,
I'll probably feel fine."

478
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,256
What do I do until then?

479
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,162
CHARLIE: Murph, start him on
50 milligrams of Zoloft

480
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,292
and half a milligram of Xanax as needed.

481
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,235
Here, Kip, this should provide you
with some relief

482
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,707
and we'll just meet next week,
same time, same place, okay?

- Thank you, Charlie.
- No problem. Be nice, Murphy.

485
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,796
Charlie, I spoke to Dr. Weathers today.

486
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,663
He said you may have not only ADD,

487
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,769
but a whole battery
of psychological disorders

488
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,500
that will likely plague you for life.

(SCOFFS)

490
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,976
Sounds a bit melodramatic,
don't you think?

491
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,637
That's what I said.

492
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,809
Then he went on to imply that
you may have inherited it from me.

493
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,483
I was rather perturbed.

494
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,886
I mean, look at me.
I'm as fit as a fucking fiddle.

495
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,325
Can't argue with that.

496
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,962
Are you making any friends at all?

497
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,022
Working on it.

498
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,637
He says he doesn't want to see me.

499
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,764
I can't stop crying.

500
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:41,505
Well, sometimes people say one thing
and they really mean another, like...

501
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,844
He called me a loser,
and last night he hit my mom.

502
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:49,243
You have to understand that
what he's doing isn't because of you.

503
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,379
He hates his life so much that...

504
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,222
All I wanna do is drop acid.
I just can't handle this place.

505
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,622
Duh, dude. This place sucks.

506
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,328
But I just worry that one day
we're gonna look back at high school

507
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,526
and wish we'd done something different.

508
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,659
So maybe you should...

509
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:05,827
Get breast implants.

510
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,837
I mean, a lot of my friends
are getting them.

511
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,305
Well, that's up to you,
but speaking as a guy,

512
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,002

00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,393
I don't know, but now I do. Okay?

00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,128
What does he want?

687
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:33,728
Are you drunk?

688
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,704
Do you expect me to qualify that
with an answer?

689
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,468
Be really careful right now.
I'm not kidding.

690
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,236
I met this kid. I was a teenage boy once...

691
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,867
You know what? I would understand
if you were drunk, Dad,

692
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:43,538
- because you're acting like a jackass!
- Sweetie, be open to the possibility

693
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,445
that he would love
to tell his friends how he...

694
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,381
Oh, how he what?

695
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,814
You know.

696
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,448
- No. How he what?
- Yes. You know what.

703
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,903
Sure did.

00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,962

How was your 72-hour meditation?

Pretty enlightening.

Yeah, I'm proud to say
I'm completely rehabilitated.

Very interesting resume, Charlie.

722
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,970
Is there a private school
you haven't been kicked out of?

- Don't flatter yourself.

As you know, I'm the principal,
and as principal I will do my best

to help you graduate with
what you will need to survive in the world.

728

Sometimes I'm other things.

Well, thank you.

Because if I were one of those dads,

is a distant second to my daughter,

So, how does this work?
Do I just talk, or... Does Murphy listen?

Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

It's not like
I'm your fucking business partner.

752
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,490
So, what did my dad want?

753
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,961
He just wanted to welcome me back.

754
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,406
He didn't say anything about me
hanging out with you?

755
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:07,708
Not really.

756
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:12,446
Maybe the way to do this
is to ask a question.

757
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,907
What question?

758
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,445
Charlie, I don't know.
You're the professional.

759
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:23,759
All right. Well, I guess the obvious one is
how do you feel about your dad?

760
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:27,763
You mean, besides the fact that this
stupid job turned him into an alcoholic?

761
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:28,923
Okay.

762
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,393
How do you feel about that?

763
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,432
I think it actually bothers him
more than me, to be honest.

764
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,633
But there was the night.

765
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,405
What's "the night"?

766
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,580
The night he found out
my mother was having an affair.

767
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:51,246
He was plastered, waving this.38 revolver
around, threatening to kill himself.

768
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:54,746
Wow.

769
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,025
So, your mom left and you stayed, right?

770
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,394
Yeah, pretty much.

771
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,766
Well, he promised to get rid of the gun,

772
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,239
and then he went into treatment
for a while.

773
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:15,870
And then, for whatever reason,
he decided he was into boats.

774
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,675
You know, it's like someone said,

It kind of sucks having one parent ditch
and then the other one lose their mind.

to turn out even remotely functional?

01:32:20,067 --> 01:32:24,504
<i>If you wanna say no, say no</i>

1354
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:30,410
<i>There's a million ways to go</i>

1355
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:34,881

<i>(AUDIENCE CHEERING)</i>

1358
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:52,628
I must say, of all the kids
applying for a summer internship,

1359
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:55,362
you have quite a checkered history.

1360
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:58,166
I understand. And I'm sure
you have a whole stack of people

1361
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:02,573
with perfect backgrounds
and no disciplinary record.

1362
01:33:05,713 --> 01:33:08,807
Really, I'd do anything to work here.

1363
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:13,513
Well, let's get on with the interview.
I've got a hell of a day ahead of me.

1364
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:16,487
Would you like to talk about it?

1365
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:21,694
<i>Do you know what it's like</i>
<i>to fall on the floor?</i>

1366
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:24,491
<i>And cry your guts out</i>
<i>till you got no more?</i>

1367
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:28,260
<i>Hey, man</i>
<i>Now you're really living</i>

1368
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:31,566
<i>Have you ever made love</i>
<i>to a beautiful girl?</i>

1369
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:34,534
<i>Made you feel like</i>
<i>it's not such a bad world?</i>

1370
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:38,508
<i>Hey, man</i>

1373
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:48,749
<i>Now you're really living</i>
<i>what this life is all about</i>

1374
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:53,226
<i>Well, I just saw the sun</i>
<i>rise over the hill</i>

1375
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:55,952
<i>Never used to give me</i>
<i>much of a thrill</i>

1376
01:33:56,030 --> 01:34:00,023
<i>But hey, man</i>
<i>Now I'm really living</i>

1377
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:13,213
<i>Do you know what it's like</i>
<i>to care too much</i>

1378
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,942
<i>'Bout someone that you're</i>
<i>never gonna get to touch?</i>

1379
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:20,084
<i>Hey, man</i>
<i>Now you're really living</i>

1380
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:23,089
<i>Have you ever sat down</i>
<i>in the fresh-cut grass</i>

1381
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:26,058
<i>And thought about the moment</i>

<i>Now you're really living</i>
<i>what this life is all about</i>

1386
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:44,534
<i>Now, what would you say</i>
<i>if I told you that</i>

1387
01:34:44,612 --> 01:34:47,513
<i>Everyone thinks</i>
<i>you're a crazy old cat</i>

1388
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:51,415
