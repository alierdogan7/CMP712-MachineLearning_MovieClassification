1
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,986
(instrumental music playing)

2
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,989
Thank you.

3
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,080
(elevator dings)

4
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,460
Wait, wait, wait.

5
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,297
Man:
Oh, great.

6
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,508
Thanks.

7
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,764
Excuse me.

8
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,937
Don't touch that dial.

9
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,814
It's not Texaco's hour
at the Metropolitan.

10
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,274
It's Dr. Abby Barnes
with "The Truth About Cats & Dogs"

11
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,109
and you're on the air.

12
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,736
- Woman: Hello?
- Hi.

13
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,780
Oh, hi. This is Charles
from San Pedro.

14
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,449
And, okay, my question is
I'm worried about

15
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,660
my basset hound, Clothilde.

16
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,079
- She doesn't wanna seem to eat.
- Doesn't wanna eat.

17
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,288
Well, you know what, Charles?

18
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,290
Usually, Basset hounds
don't wanna eat what they can't smell.

19
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,377
- Does she have a cold by any chance?
- Oh, she is coughing a little bit.

20
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,588
Okay. Is it a dry,
wheezing like...

21
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,966
(wheezing)
...type of cough,

22
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,427
or is it a wetter,
phlegm-based cough?

23
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,222
It's like the first one,
more like the wheezy one.

24
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,141
- Okay. Can you put her on?
- The dog? On the phone?

25
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,310
- Yeah.
- (laughs) Okay.

26
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,354
Clothilde, come here, baby!
Come here.

27
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,065
Okay, here she is, Doctor.

28
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,608
- (Clothilde coughing)
- Oh, baby!

29
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,818
Yeah, she's got a cold, Charles.

30
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,987
You're gonna have to
take her to the vet.

31
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,989
- Right now?
- Right away.

32
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,699
- Man: Yes. Hello?
- Hello?

33
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:24,120
Yes, my name is Dan, okay?
And I have a cat.

34
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,124
And he licked up and down my face,
and now I got this awful-lookin' rash.

35
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,292
You see what I'm sayin'?

36
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,961
- You're allergic to his saliva, Dan.
- No, no, no, I'm not.

37
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,796
I mean, you know,
I never have been

38
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,007
prior to this occasion
is what I'm talking about.

39
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,260
But you're saying he licked your face
and now it's all gross, correct?

40
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,678
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

41
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,847
How long did this tongue-bath last?

42
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,099
Well, let's see, it started at 1:00...

43
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,351
(mumbling)

44
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,188
- About three hours.
- Oh, Dan.

45
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,024
No, no, it doesn't seem
to hurt him any.

46
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,984
Abby: Right, because that's...
he's a fur person, Dan.

47
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,487
He chases imaginary bugs up the wall.
Are you gonna do that, too?

48
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,198
- Imaginary? No.
- No, no.

49
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,867
Okay, this is a good time
to talk about limits.

50
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:07,413
You can love your pets,
but just don't... love your pets.

51
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,082
You know what I mean?
Repeat after me.

52
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:19,050
Us, them.

53
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,144
- (pop music playing)
- Hi, babyhead!

54
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,021
(cat meows)

55
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,732
- How are you?
- (meows)

56
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,234
Wanna come read with me, huh?

57
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,780
Sweetest of all possible
sweet cats in the world?

58
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,406
(meows)

59
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:46,786
- Huh? Huh, sweetie?
- (purring)

60
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,251
I think we're gonna paint
this weekend. Yes.

61
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,420
You're going to paint,
and I'll watch.

62
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,756
Now you can watch me read.

63
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,094
Well, can I have a kiss?
You didn't kiss me when I came home.

64
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,387
- Kiss.
- (purring)

65
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,348
Thank you.
Thank you, my lovely.

66
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,225
- (knocking at door)
- Man: Noelle?

67
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,602
Down the hall!

68
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,771
- (knocking at door)
- Come on, baby, open up.

69
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:18,359
- It's me.
- Ass. What an ass.

70
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,781
- You're not Noelle.
- Not today, no.

71
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,908
But try again tomorrow.
Who knows?

72
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,077
- You might get lucky.
- Is she... I mean, is she...

73
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,830
- (hisses)
- (sneezes)

74
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,708
Noelle:
Over here, Roy!

75
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,298
(sneezes)

76
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,800
Aw, man.

77
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,636
- Noelle: Sorry.
- It's okay.

78
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,932
Woman over phone: Hello.
My fish, he's depressed.

79
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,559
My vet said to bring in
a blood sample,

80
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,645
so I tranquilized him
in a 10% diazepam solution,

81
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,355
but he's not moving now.

82
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,482
And I wanna know if you think
I should take him out.

83
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,735
Absolutely. You're sedating him,
not poaching him.

84
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,902
You gotta get him out of there.

85
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,154
We're gonna take a little break,

86
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,822
and then answer
some more of your calls.

87
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,824
Don't go away.

88
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,828
- Ready?
- Bring it on.

89
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,749
Fan mail, fan mail, fan mail,
horse too fat.

90
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,711
- Oh, my God.
- Bad dog, mad dog, sad dog.

91
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,547
- Stinky cat problems.
- We're back in 30, Abby.

92
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,340
Thank you.

93
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,264
Oh, my gosh.

94
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,184
Hey, hey, Mario.
I know her.

95
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,312
No, you don't.
Women like that don't really exist.

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,189
Yeah-huh.
This one exists in my building.

97
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,443
Abby, you've got a caller on line 3
who says his dog is hysterical.

98
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,904
Hi, this is Dr. Abby Barnes.
You're on the air.

99
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,864
- (dog barks)
- This is Brian from Venice.

100
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,032
Hi, Brian. What's up?

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,283
(British accent)
Well, I've got a dog here

102
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,202
that's a bit out of sorts.

103
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,453
Mm-hmm.

104
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,954
(imitates British accent)
And what's wrong with your dog?

105
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:58,417
- This is gonna sound strange...
- (dog barking, growling)

106
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,628
He's wearing roller skates.

107
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:04,423
I see. And how did your dog
end up in roller skates?

108
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,966
Well, actually, he's not my dog.

109
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,426
I got him from the pound
this morning.

110
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,262
I'm a photographer and it's all part
of this shoot that I'm doing.

111
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,056
I thought you said this guy
was a professional.

112
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,557
Oh, no, no, no.
He is a professional.

113
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,519
He's just used to dealing
with Chihuahuas and poodles.

114
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,396
It's the dog that's unprofessional.

115
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,983
- (barks)
- Everyone, it's gonna be fine...

116
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,195
- if we all just stay calm, okay?
- (objects breaking)

117
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,030
You've got to help me here.

118
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,825
All righty, let's help the dog first,
and then we'll help you.

119
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,910
Right now your dog is feeling
very, very threatened,

120
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,912
so if you wanna get close enough
to take the skates off,

121
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,248
you're going to have to approach him
in the submissive position.

122
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,458
- I'm sorry?
- Get down on all fours.

123
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,836
(laughs)

124
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,421
You want me to help you,
you have to do what I say.

125
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,840
(barks)

126
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,843
Okay.

127
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,303
(growling)

128
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,098
Okay.

129
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,643
All right, now crawl toward him
with your head hanging down

130
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,563
and cocked to one side,
and do not make eye contact.

131
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,315
Don't make eye contact.
Okay.

132
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,281
(dog growling)

133
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,955
- Okay, how are you doing?
- He seems interested in me.

134
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,832
(snarling)

135
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,794
Now, you have to make him
feel comfortable.

136
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,796
You're gonna have to soothe him
with your voice.

137
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,091
You hear how I can make my voice
sound very, very soothing?

138
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,635
- (barks)
- Yes.

139
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,596
- (barks)
- Good boy.

140
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,222
(growling)

141
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,683
(barks)

142
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,644
Okay, now reach out your hand with
your fingers curled under like a paw

143
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,021
and try and touch his coat.

144
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,899
(dog growling)

145
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,654
Shit.

146
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,411
- (barking)
- Jesus.

147
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,374
Are all your digits intact, Brian?

148
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,753
- Yep.
- Okay, now move forward.

149
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,838
Just gently stroke his ears,
putting pressure at the tips.

150
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,506
That's an acupressure point.

151
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,552
Okay, just take it easy.

152
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,431
You're doing good.

153
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,433
Okay, careful.
Go for the ears.

154
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,019
- Go out to the tips of the ears.
- Okay.

155
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,730
- Gently. Okay?
- (chuckles)

156
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,317
- That sounds good.
- It's incredible.

157
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,569
Good boy.

158
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,530
Thank you,
but we'll be leaving now.

159
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,032
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to leave.

160
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,909
You've gotta understand
what these dogs are getting paid.

161
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,869
They're in the union now.
They're hard to work with.

162
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,205
- We appreciate the opportunity.
- Can you leave the child?

163
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,831
- No, I don't think so.
- You can't turn your back on art.

164
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,668
Let's get these things off you.
Who put these things on you, eh?

165
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,629
Brian, I'd like to take this opportunity
to congratulate you

166
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,673
on the newest addition
to your family.

167
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,217
What?
No, I can't have a dog.

168
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,595
- Well, why is that?
- Well...

169
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,973
Well, I live alone.

170
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,975
Trust me, you're gonna
like this a lot better.

171
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,478
- Maybe, but it's a big responsibility.
- Is that a bad thing?

172
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,982
No, not necessarily.
It just depends on what you want.

173
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,067
He's a big dog,
which is gonna take a lot of...

174
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,360
Give Eric your name,
and we're gonna send you

175
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,237
some pamphlets
on canine dental care.

176
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,073
...which I obviously
haven't got time to do if I want to...

177
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,993
- And, Brian?
- Yeah?

178
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,662
I forgive you.

179
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,416
Yo, come on, man, let's roll.
We're ready to roll.

180
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,668
You've got the shot.
You've got millions of shots.

181
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,254
No, I think this is better
than the thing with the boy.

182
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,006
(camera clicks)

183
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,799
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna meet us over there later?

184
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,092
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.

185
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,094
I've got to make him his dinner,
then get his bed ready,

186
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,595
and then I don't think
he should spend

187
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,930
his first night
in a strange place alone.

188
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,016
- Do you?
- Don't get too attached to this dog

189
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,726
and get weird on me, all right?

190
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,436
And plus,
his mouth is all juicy

191
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,771
like his gums sprang a leak
or something.

192
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,607
It's meant to be juicy.
They dribble when they're hungry.

193
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,028
- Hank.
- (camera clicks)

194
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,195
So what do you think?

195
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,072
What would a girl
find more romantic...

196
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,824
tulips or roses?

197
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,951
- Well...
- Forget it. Susan will know.

198
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,953
- A messenger just dropped this off.
- Thank you.

199
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,288
- And line 2's for you.
- Thank you.

200
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,332
- What?
- What's more romantic...

201
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,459
tulips or roses?

202
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,254
Oh, that's so cute!

203
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,131
This is Abby.

204
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,300
- Hello, this is Brian.
- Yes?

205
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,719
We slept together.

206
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,597
Me and Hank.
Did you get the picture?

207
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,308
Yeah, yeah.
I'm looking at it right now.

208
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,686
- He spent the night.
- Oh, that's so great. How's it going?

209
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,774
Yeah, well, he snores,
which was a problem.

210
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,776
- But we solved it.
- How'd you do that?

211
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,819
Well, he slept on my face
and I couldn't hear him anymore.

212
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:36,987
(Abby laughs)

213
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,656
That's a good solution.
I'm glad he decided to keep you.

214
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,825
Yeah, so am I.
I just wanted to say thank you.

215
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,702
Oh, you're welcome.
It was my pleasure.

216
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,997
And I'd really like
to say it in person.

217
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,417
How about you meet us
for a drink?

218
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,378
Um...

219
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,130
Or a walk,
a walk along the canals.

220
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,091
Why would I meet a listener
I know nothing about

221
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,301
except he puts roller skates
on his dog?

222
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,969
Good question, good question.

223
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,348
Well... I didn't want
to say this upfront,

224
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,517
but I've got this really bad
case of mange.

225
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,894
And it's terribly itchy, you know.
I just can't stop licking it.

226
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,687
- Oh, hmm.
- So, I was wondering if you could

227
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,981
recommend an ointment
or at least have a look at it.

228
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,149
What the hell?

229
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,777
Okay, how about
the Washington entrance at 5:00?

230
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,571
- Great. Well, I'll see you there.
- Okay. Me, too.

231
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,865
Great. Okay. Bye.
No, wait, wait.

232
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,284
I forgot to ask you
what you look like.

233
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,870
Why do you need to know that?

234
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,164
Just so I can recognize you.

235
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,543
Oh. What do you think
I look like?

236
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,878
I don't know... if the voice
is anything to go by, you look great.

237
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,885
I'm 5'10", blonde, thin...

238
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,680
hard to miss.

239
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,974
Okay. I'll see you there.

240
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,810
Okay.

241
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,271
No, you won't.

242
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,130
(violin music playing)

243
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,925
(meows)

244
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,684
- (footsteps)
- Noelle: Can we just go?

245
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,854
(indistinct arguing)

246
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,864
Roy: Just go back inside
and change your dress, please.

247
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,658
Noelle: I look fine.
Your friends aren't gonna complain.

248
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,452
Roy: What are you doing?
You look fat.

249
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,454
Noelle: No, come on.
Don't be like that. Let's just go.

250
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,207
- Noelle, shut up and get back inside.
- What are you doing?

251
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,833
- Get back inside.
- Look, I've already

252
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,752
changed my dress three times,
and I just really...

253
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,004
No, I know,
but you look fat in that thing.

254
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,298
So go in and change the dress,
and do it now!

255
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,592
- Roy... ahh!
- Dumb bitch!

256
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,345
- Did you call me?
- What?

257
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,014
I'm sorry, I heard "dumb bitch."
I assumed you were speaking to me.

258
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,390
No, I'm talking to her.

259
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,684
You're kidding.
Your name is Dumb Bitch, too?

260
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,686
No wonder I've been
getting all your mail.

261
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,979
Do you think we could be related?

262
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,524
Because there are a lot of us
dumb bitches here in LA. Hi.

263
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,068
Hey, cat lady,
mind your own business.

264
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,320
Why don't you leave
before I use this bow on you

265
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,572
in a way you've only imagined?

266
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,413
Here. Imagine that.

267
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,586
You know what?

268
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:43,048
You're not just a dumb bitch,
you're an ugly dumb bitch.

269
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,341
Oh.

270
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,176
And you...

271
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,970
later.

272
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,601
Wow, that was...

273
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,687
I don't know what that was.

274
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,731
- You all right?
- Yeah.

275
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,025
(motorcycle departing)

276
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,404
God, I'm sorry about the violin thing.
I'll buy you another one.

277
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:10,075
- That was your boyfriend?
- I go out with him.

278
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,077
The thing is he's also my manager.

279
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,996
You pay him 10%
to treat you like that?

280
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,914
15.

281
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,625
Hey, he says that's normal.

282
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,129
I don't know.
He used to be sweet.

283
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,214
What are you supposed to do?

284
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,008
I mean, you gotta have
a boyfriend, don't ya?

285
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,010
Otherwise it's just you and a cat,

286
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,887
and the next thing you know,
40 candles on your birthday cake.

287
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,890
- What does that mean?
- Oh, no!

288
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,643
- No, I didn't mean you.
- Forget it.

289
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,353
This is absolutely
none of my business

290
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,481
and I will not
be interfering again.

291
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,567
Sorry.

292
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,903
I didn't mean you.

293
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,076
Man: Do you have
a computer yourself?

294
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,580
Woman: No. My husband does.
And he's on the thing all the time.

295
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,665
He doesn't even play
with the kids anymore.

296
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,208
Man: What does he do
with the computer?

297
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,253
- She's right over here. Okay?
- Okay. Uh-huh.

298
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,425
Hi.

299
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,427
Did you know violin bows
were like cars?

300
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,762
Meaning?

301
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:16,058
Well, they go from your basic
low-end bows...

302
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,728
something like a Geo or a Hyundai,
which I personally drive,

303
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,064
all the way
to your high-performance

304
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:27,069
Porsche-like bows,
which play like the devil.

305
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,530
I... I got you this...

306
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,616
well, it's like a Toyota,

307
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,119
which was all I could afford.

308
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,456
Aw, thank you.

309
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,376
Just give me some time
and I'll upgrade your bow.

310
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,252
Don't worry about it.
It wasn't your fault.

311
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,588
This is really nice.

312
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,966
- Wow.
- Yeah. You wanna sit down?

313
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,677
- Can I?
- Sure.

314
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,141
- Promise not to laugh?
- Sure.

315
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm taking
broadcasting lessons myself.

316
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,937
That's great!

317
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,232
Newscasters... you know,
they're so dignified.

318
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,733
They always know everything.

319
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,778
Yeah, it's the news.
They get the information beforehand.

320
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,906
No kidding.
That's why it's so cool.

321
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,200
You find out before everyone.

322
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,619
- Usually, I'm the last to know.
- Oh.

323
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,289
Hey, how about you play hooky

324
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,000
and we go score ourselves
a cappuccino?

325
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,420
All right.
That sounds pretty good.

326
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,256
These are leaking on me, though.
I'm gonna get a vase.

327
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,007
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

328
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,435
(barks)

329
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,186
Come here, come here.
Let's go.

330
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,409
(barks)

331
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,330
Testing.

332
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,376
Good evening, Riverside.
This is the news at 5:00.

333
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,301
(silent)

334
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,271
(door opens)

335
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,041
- Okay.
- (barks)

336
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:49,169
Hey!

337
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,171
I know that dog.

338
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,215
I don't think he likes me.
Can you get him away?

339
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,884
Abby:
Come here!

340
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,763
Hi, sweetie!

341
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:04,226
Why do I know you?
Why do I know your sweet face?

342
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,144
Oh, my God.
Oh, my...

343
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,188
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

344
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,941
Um, um, um...
you have to help me.

345
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,859
There's a guy out there
and I was supposed

346
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,361
to have a date with him,
and this is his dog.

347
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,696
And I just want you to be me
when he comes in here, okay?

348
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,907
(silent)

349
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,117
(door buzzes)

350
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,957
Sorry.

351
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,417
He ran in and then
the door was locked and...

352
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,878
- Sorry.
- Brian, right?

353
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,631
- Yeah. Hi. Abby?
- Yeah.

354
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,260
- Hi.
- Hi. It's lovely to meet you.

355
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,388
You, too.
This is my friend, Madon...

356
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,889
- Donna.
- Hi.

357
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,642
Hello.

358
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,603
Hank.

359
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,147
You didn't show up yesterday.

360
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,858
No, I'm sorry.

361
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,610
We had this emergency thing,
didn't we, Donna?

362
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,446
- Yeah, cat emergency.
- Dog... it was a situation.

363
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,951
- Feline panleukopenia.
- It happens, but it's okay now.

364
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,788
- What?
- Nothing. Sorry.

365
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,416
It's just you sound
completely different on the air.

366
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,336
Oh! You should hear me
in the shower.

367
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,966
Microphones, darling...
they work wonders.

368
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,426
Yeah, I've heard that.

369
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,678
I just didn't want you to think
that I was some weirdo.

370
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,013
Oh, no.

371
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,141
And that's why
you didn't come yesterday.

372
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,476
It's just that what you said
to me on the radio

373
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:33,356
was so clever and perceptive.

374
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,526
And if you hadn't said
what you said,

375
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,987
then I wouldn't
have kept Hank here.

376
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,948
And...

377
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,285
I just wanted to say thank you.

378
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:49,581
- That's so great.
- Yeah, that's great.

379
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,626
Thanks. I've taught him a trick.
Do you want to see it?

380
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,002
Mmm.

381
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,630
Okay. Come on, Hank.
Up you come.

382
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,174
Yes! Good boy.

383
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,801
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss, come on.

384
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,553
Come on.

385
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,019
Yeah, I've gotta do something
about his breath.

386
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:15,106
Anyhow, I don't suppose
you want the drink now?

387
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,234
- Guess again.
- Great.

388
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,403
How about tonight?

389
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:25,784
There's a bar on the corner
of Main and Pier.

390
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,119
Meet me there 7:00?

391
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,789
Wild horses couldn't stop me.

392
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,041
See you there.

393
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,377
- Come on, Hank. Come on.
- (barks)

394
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,253
You like him and he likes you.

395
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,714
- Don't pretend you don't.
- I don't!

396
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,926
Did you hear what he said to you?
I wish a guy would say that to me.

397
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,428
- He did say it to you.
- No, he really said it to you.

398
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,930
And now you've gone
and confused everything

399
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,556
'cause you're a scaredy-cat.

400
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,517
I may be somewhat
trepidatious, yes.

401
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,768
I'm not some big, dumb dog

402
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,853
that goes bounding after
the first guy she sees.

403
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,732
- I'm not dumb.
- I didn't mean that.

404
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,943
- Besides, you're the dummy.
- I am?

405
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:04,280
Yeah. A nice guy like that
with that accent, arty,

406
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,324
and you won't even have
a drink with him?

407
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,035
He has a preconceived notion: You.

408
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,454
Then he sees me.
Over.

409
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,707
I love the way you look.
You've got a pretty face.

410
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,001
- Oh. No.
- You're a celebrity.

411
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,628
I don't expect you
to understand this.

412
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,797
You burp and guys think
it's adorable.

413
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,133
You puke and they line up
to hold your hair back.

414
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,136
I can tell you for a fact
that's not true.

415
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,304
- (bicycle bell ringing)
- Whoo hoo hoo!

416
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,224
(car horn honking,
tires screech)

417
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,727
Man:
Nice trick, moron.

418
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,147
- What?
- "What?" Oh, my God!

419
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,150
Really?
Three years, no sex?

420
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,111
One can survive, you know.
This is the electronic age.

421
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,405
Noelle: But even cats have
more sex than that, don't they?

422
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,324
Not mine.
Are you gonna eat that?

423
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,576
I don't eat.

424
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,286
You don't eat?
You ordered it.

425
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,955
I love to order,
I love menus,

426
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,915
but I gotta keep
the calories down.

427
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,793
- God, how can you live like that?
- I know.

428
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,588
- Do you believe you are what you eat?
- I guess.

429
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:02,839
See, that's what scares me.

430
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,884
I don't eat anything
so I can look good on the outside.

431
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,970
But on the inside there's nothing.

432
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,306
Oh, I see.

433
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:16,144
Whereas you, on the other hand...
you're very rich.

434
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,812
Thank you.

435
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,314
(buzzing)

436
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,776
- Do you hear a bzzing? Bzzz?
- Just a bee.

437
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,612
Is that a b-bee...
bee bee bee bee!

438
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,197
- Aah aah!
- I'll get it.

439
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,948
Aah!

440
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,331
Hey! Hey...

441
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,042
What are you...
You! Stop!

442
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,298
(stomping)

443
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,802
- (buzzing stops)
- It's dead.

444
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,678
No kidding.

445
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,390
- I killed it.
- You certainly did.

446
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,976
You're gonna be
all right now, so...

447
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,020
She's fine. We're fine.

448
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,440
Everybody's fine, right?
Great. Thank you.

449
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,943
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

450
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,986
(mouths words)

451
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,947
What's wrong, Abby?

452
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:13,118
Nothing that a rooftop
and an AK-47 won't take care of.

453
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,247
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

454
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,707
Good, good. It'll be fun.

455
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,960
It'll be easy. No problem.

456
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,337
- Hey!
- Don't want to see him.

457
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,174
Come on.

458
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,260
- It'll be fine.
- It's not gonna be fine.

459
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,929
It'll be just fine.

460
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,765
(grunts)

461
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,642
What is this?
Is this cat hair?

462
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,061
I'm shedding.
I'm extremely nervous.

463
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,815
Okay, just head up.
Be proud.

464
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,817
- Feeling good.
- Yes, sir.

465
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,652
This makes all the difference.
Thank you.

466
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,988
(music playing over dialogue)

467
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,206
- Hello.
- Hi.

468
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,458
- Remember?
- Hi.

469
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,252
- Donna.
- Right.

470
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,131
- I'm gonna go and, um, freshen up.
- Okay.

471
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:13,803
Oh, and Donna's got
this loopy story to tell you.

472
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,680
Actually, it's funny.

473
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,099
Maybe you can help her
with the punch line?

474
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,518
Okay.

475
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,230
- I'll have a J&B and a Corona.
- Okay.

476
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,357
Can I have a J&B
and a Corona, please?

477
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,526
- Sure.
- Thanks.

478
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,699
Of course.
Of course I would do that.

479
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,203
So, what's the funny story?

480
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,665
Oh, I don't know if it's funny
so much as interesting.

481
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,002
Men and women
and how they interact.

482
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,423
We have societal pressures
and even the media feeds into it

483
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,800
and we have our own insecurities,

484
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,928
me especially.

485
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,306
You have a little fuzz.

486
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,186
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Thanks.

487
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:07,106
- So, you're wondering why I'm here.
- No. I mean, y... no, not at all.

488
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,359
I mean, I think I know
why you're here.

489
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,946
- You do?
- Mm. And it's fine.

490
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,490
That's great, 'cause I was...

491
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,533
I think it's really nice
that you've come along

492
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,370
to screen me for Abby.

493
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,871
Abby. Right.

494
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,707
There's a lot
of very odd people around,

495
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,168
particularly the types
who phone into radio shows

496
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,170
and then ask the presenters
out for a drink,

497
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,714
which is honestly... it's not
something I normally do, but...

498
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:36,469
- I really like this woman.
- You just met her.

499
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,013
I know, but you know
when you speak to someone,

500
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:42,225
and then you meet them?

501
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,811
And then there's really no choice.

502
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,730
Nothing you can do about it.
You just feel it.

503
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,402
So what do you do, Donna?
Do you work at the radio station?

504
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,406
- I make cheese.
- Cheese?

505
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,573
- Yeah.
- Really?

506
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,952
I've never met a cheesemaker before.
So, what sort?

507
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,328
Goat cheese.

508
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,205
Oh, that's the stuff
that smells of vomit.

509
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,207
- No, that's Parmesan.
- Yeah, of course.

510
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,085
Mine's more of a fromage, really.

511
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,463
And it comes from
the south of France, the Pyrenees,

512
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,590
where I have acquired
a number of goats

513
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,843
through a freakish inheritance.

514
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,137
Occasionally
I'll take trips out there

515
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,222
and sometimes
Abby accompanies me

516
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,434
to check on the general health
and well-being of my goats.

517
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,602
- Really?
- Yeah.

518
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,689
- Hi.
- Hi.

519
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,108
Everything out in the open?

520
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,985
Oh, you mean about?
Yeah, sure.

521
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,446
Totally understandable.

522
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,197
You see?

523
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,867
She thought you'd be
all bent out of shape about it.

524
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,076
Not at all.

525
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,703
I think friends should
look out for each other.

526
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:47,248
Although, flying across the Atlantic
to check up on her goats is...

527
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,001
You know, when you come with me
to check on the goats

528
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,129
for the goat cheese
that I make for a living.

529
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,722
Her cheese balls make
excellent Christmas gifts.

530
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,767
- Here we are.
- Great.

531
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,729
I don't know... I was mesmerized
by his eyebrows.

532
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,314
They say so much
about a person.

533
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,400
Did they say "goat cheese" on them?
Why didn't you just tell him?

534
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,651
I don't know!
I was staring at him.

535
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,653
He was so uninterested
in staring back at me.

536
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,489
I don't want that kind
of disappointment.

537
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,366
Disappointment doesn't kill.

538
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,369
Right. Rejection kills,
disappointment only maims.

539
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,537
Brian:
Okay, here we are.

540
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,835
Just go through.

541
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,383
- This is it. Château Brian.
- Abby: Nice.

542
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,093
Hi, baby!

543
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,053
Ooh. The dog really likes Donna.

544
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,596
I can't seem to get ahold of him.

545
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:47,225
He's just jealous.
Dogs, they can sense... you know.

546
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,852
- Really?
- Yeah.

547
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,563
Oh, are these yours?

548
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,608
Yeah. Don't look at those.
They just pay the rent.

549
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,736
There's not a lot of art
in a catalogue shoot

550
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,947
unless roller-skating dogs qualify.

551
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,616
Dada meets Fido.

552
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,785
That was funny.

553
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,414
- Roller-skatin' dogs.
- Hey!

554
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,165
- I'd like to see that.
- Hey, look at these.

555
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,293
- These are beautiful.
- Yeah, but they don't pay the rent.

556
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,006
Hmm.

557
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,386
Brian:
What do you think?

558
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:27,390
Ask Donna. She knows more
about this arty kind of stuff.

559
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,643
Abby:
Brian, this is a beautiful shot.

560
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,728
- This one? Really?
- Yeah.

561
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,273
Yeah. I love those textures
right there.

562
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,191
- Yeah? That's one of my favorites.
- (door opens)

563
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,528
Yo! Can we come in?

564
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,823
Of course you can.
Ed, this is Abby.

565
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,950
- Hi, Abby. How are you doing?
- Hi. Abby.

566
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,077
- And Donna.
- How are ya?

567
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,829
Yeah, all right, all right.

568
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,415
Oh, this is my niece, Emily.

569
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,208
- (clears throat)
- What?

570
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,711
- (whispers)
- Oh, yeah. You can ask her yourself.

571
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,131
- Is it okay?
- I forgot to ask.

572
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,177
Ha.

573
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,597
Hi. What is it, sweetie?

574
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,266
Aah! Oh.

575
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,477
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

576
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,270
When they heard that there was
gonna be a real vet in the house,

577
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,981
I just assumed
they could come over.

578
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,359
- That's a really beautiful tortoise.
- He's got pneumonia.

579
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,820
- Aw.
- Ed: Yeah, we took him to the vet

580
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,198
and he gave us this hypodermic
full of antibiotics.

581
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,033
We're supposed to give him
a shot underneath his arm,

582
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,701
but we can't seem to keep him
out of his shell.

583
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:32,163
So we were thinking
that you could help us out.

584
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,876
Sure, you can.
You can do that.

585
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,378
Of course.

586
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:43,466
Um, let me just go wash my hands.

587
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,635
Donna?

588
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:52,141
She is all that and a bag of chips.

589
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:56,604
- Who's the other one?
- She makes cheese.

590
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,357
- I hate needles. I hate turtles.
- Shh!

591
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,984
(sighs)
Why don't we just tell him now?

592
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,779
He was definitely into you when you
were talking about his photographs.

593
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,573
He's amiably tolerating my presence
till he can be alone with you.

594
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,492
Now, all you have to do
is grab the turtle's leg,

595
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,495
hold it steady,
and give the shot.

596
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,081
- How do I get ahold of his leg?
- Very simple.

597
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,667
You're gonna poke him
in the butt with your finger.

598
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,880
You want me to stick my finger
up a turtle's ass?

599
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,184
(squishing)

600
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,231
(grunting)

601
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,487
Hey, what's this?
Your palms, they're sweating.

602
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,365
- Malls make me nauseous.
- I did the turtle for you.

603
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,534
Yes, you did,
and you did a brilliant job.

604
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,661
You and I combined
make the perfect woman.

605
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,038
No, you and I combined
make the perfect political prisoner.

606
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,375
What we really do well
is act self-righteous and starve.

607
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:02,378
- Hello.
- Hi.

608
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,630
Okay.

609
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,217
We need the spring-bride blush

610
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:12,138
and the Absentia pore minimizer.

611
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:15,057
I'd actually like a pore maximizer
if you have one,

612
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,728
because sometimes you just wanna
put loose change somewhere, or keys.

613
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,231
There's this TV station in Riverside.

614
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,899
They're looking
for a weekend anchor.

615
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,860
They've asked me if I'd audition
for them next week.

616
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,904
That's so cool!
That's great.

617
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,283
Would you listen
to my audition piece?

618
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,452
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

619
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:46,005
79 people drowned
and another 200 were in...

620
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,800
Wait. Okay.
Just cool. Okay.

621
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,389
79 people drowned
and another 200 were injured

622
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,516
when a passenger ferry
caught fire last night

623
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,518
just off the coast of Scotland.

624
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,480
Stymied by a dense fog,
rescuer workers could only hear

625
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,149
the desperate screams
of the victims

626
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:10,446
as their four-mile journey
turned into a tragic and watery end.

627
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,573
That was good.
That was really good.

628
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,910
But you might wanna make
the carnage a little less upbeat.

629
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,871
Oh, I know.
I just get tense and I...

630
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,207
You're right, you're right.

631
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:24,919
No, it was great.
And you might wanna breathe more.

632
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:28,464
This is nice,
but it's a little bit smelly.

633
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,842
We also have this new face cream
which neutralizes the free radicals

634
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,303
- that attack the skin.
- Ooh.

635
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,348
Let me ask you...
what's your skin regime?

636
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,891
- My regime?
- Mm-hmm.

637
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,143
The regime from which
the radicals are trying to get free?

638
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,938
Are we selling face cream
or staging a coup?

639
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,107
Let me show you something.

640
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,488
Do you see how dry
and discolored you are?

641
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,282
Do you see
the irreversible sun damage?

642
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,451
You haven't been
taking care of your skin,

643
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,454
and it's only going to get worse.

644
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,415
(crying)
God, I can't believe it.

645
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,084
I can't believe
I let her do this to me.

646
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,211
I know exactly what she was doing.

647
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,505
Shit.
Do you have a tissue?

648
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,299
I think she might have
put one in the bag

649
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,843
with your gift-with-purchase.

650
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,511
Oh, God!

651
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,680
Men don't go around
buying all this expensive crap,

652
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,640
hoping women will want them,
you know.

653
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,560
If I was a guy, I think women would be
lining up to go out with me.

654
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,103
I'm smart,

655
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:27,022
I have a good sense of humor,
I make a great living.

656
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,858
I'd fuck ya.

657
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,026
Thank you, honey.
I know you would.

658
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,529
I'm just confused.

659
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,905
One minute she's one thing,

660
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,408
and the next minute
she's something else completely.

661
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,660
Yeah, but women
are like that, though.

662
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,246
No, but I mean there's something
off-balance about her.

663
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,124
On the radio
she's confident and articulate.

664
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,460
And then you get her in person,
and she's just...

665
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,712
I don't know... she's scatty.

666
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,964
- (British accent) Oh, she's scatty?
- Yeah.

667
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,593
Anybody that fine...
it doesn't make any difference.

668
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,804
- Yes, it does.
- I'm telling you, it doesn't.

669
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,474
You know what your problem is, right?

670
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,228
You're letting your brain
do too much of your thinking.

671
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,067
I've got something for you.

672
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,903
"Loser Guys and How to Spot Them."

673
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,907
No. "Low Self-Esteem:
Are You a Victim?"

674
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,160
- No.
- Wait. Question one:

675
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:24,580
"Do you feel you need to be punished
for how you look?"

676
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,291
I don't need to be punished.
I am punished.

677
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:31,587
That's why you can't tell Brian.
It's low self-esteem.

678
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,882
I don't even care about Brian.
That is history.

679
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,718
- I think it's more of a current affair.
- What does that mean?

680
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:42,223
Last night before we were leaving,
I told him to call me.

681
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,350
To call me?
You gave him my number?

682
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,520
- Your number.
- Why would you do that?

683
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,273
Why did you do that?
You like him. You like him.

684
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,317
- I have a boyfriend.
- Oh, right.

685
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,945
Who'd want Brian
when you could have Roy?

686
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,905
- Here you go.
- He likes you.

687
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,741
You know, the way you talk,
the things you say.

688
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:04,912
- You're the voice. I'm just the body.
- And what a body it is.

689
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,040
(laughs, snorts)

690
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,418
(ringing)

691
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,341
Hello?

692
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,553
Hello, this is Brian.
Could I speak to Abby, please?

693
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,683
(high-pitched)
This is she.

694
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:29,728
- What are you up to?
- Nothing. Just hanging.

695
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,981
Well, listen, I was thinking
maybe I could come round

696
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,524
and take you out for dinner.

697
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,068
How does that sound to you?

698
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,989
Oh, that's not possible.

699
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,324
Right.
Go for a walk?

700
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,327
Sorry. Can't do that, either.

701
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,581
Well, how about we just talk?

702
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,584
Talk. Okay.

703
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,127
Fine. Let's talk.

704
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,296
But could you talk to me
in that radio voice of yours?

705
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,089
Could you do that?

706
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,716
(normal voice)
Yeah.

707
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,676
- Yeah, that I can do.
- Great.

708
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,178
You know what kills me about him
is he just lays there

709
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,972
and lets me rub his stomach.

710
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,475
He's totally trusting,
knows I'm not gonna hurt him,

711
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,186
loves me unconditionally.

712
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,898
That kills me.
People are never that cool.

713
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,192
No, they hardly ever
let you pet their stomachs.

714
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,028
Mm-mm.

715
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,197
And I really like smelling
his cat breath when he yawns.

716
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,825
- You think that's weird?
- No, not at all.

717
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,452
(muffled)
I've done the very same thing...

718
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,495
probably... once.

719
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,539
Your voice is muffled.
What are you doing?

720
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,917
I just took my shirt off.

721
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,294
- Really?
- Really.

722
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,005
Is that portentous
or merely noteworthy?

723
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,341
It's rank, actually.

724
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,719
I went for a run earlier
and I have this remarkably manly,

725
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:47,056
animal-like, pungent stench.

726
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,771
Look, I know we're not
eating or walking,

727
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,065
but what would you say
to having a bath?

728
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,570
- I was shy, too.
- You're kidding.

729
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,489
You don't strike me as the shy type.

730
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:07,910
Brian: No, I was, really...
painfully and desperately shy.

731
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,704
And thinking about it, I suppose
that's why I ended up taking pictures,

732
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:14,583
as sort of a detachment thing,
you know what I mean?

733
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,460
Ah, yes.

734
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,713
- (barks)
- Oh, he knows you're talking to me.

735
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,507
He's probably jealous.

736
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,301
(laughing)
I doubt it.

737
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,805
Salt, pepper, granulated garlic,
mayonnaise, of course.

738
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,392
Of course.
Now for the important question:

739
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,602
Do you have a position on pickles?

740
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,938
It's more of a deeply held belief,
actually.

741
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,773
Oh, really?
A pickle conviction?

742
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,274
- Mm-hmm.
- Go ahead.

743
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:43,612
When it comes to tuna fish,
I am emphatically anti-pickle.

744
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,282
Hmm.

745
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,327
Do you know,
I knew I could trust you.

746
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,554
(violin continues)

747
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,979
"My mother leant herself
to the photograph.

748
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,189
Fearing that refusal
would turn to attitude,

749
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,650
she triumphed over this ordeal
of placing herself

750
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:25,029
in front of the lens
with discretion."

751
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,059
Now you.

752
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,022
So, you are?

753
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,983
Yes. Are you?

754
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,404
Yeah.

755
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,203
Say something.

756
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,664
I want to make love to you.

757
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,461
Sorry. Never on
the first phone call.

758
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,004
No, don't... don't do that.

759
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,465
If you do that,
we'll chicken out

760
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:30,552
and we won't do
what I think we're about to do.

761
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,472
Okay, just let me do one thing.

762
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,893
(muffled groaning)
Oh, God!

763
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,024
Okay, hi.

764
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,484
Hi.

765
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,120
Okay. So, where's your hand?

766
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,003
It's nowhere.

767
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,631
Where's yours?

768
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,850
Nowhere.

769
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,050
(Abby moans)

770
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,597
- (Brian moans)
- (grunts)

771
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,268
(sighs)

772
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,437
Wow.

773
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,940
Hello?

774
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,568
Abby?

775
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,486
(sighs)

776
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,323
Abby?

777
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,575
Abby? Hello?

778
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,413
Sorry. Sorry.
I dropped the phone.

779
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,834
I was afraid you'd met
somebody else.

780
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,880
God. Just give me a second
to collect myself.

781
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,548
Man.

782
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,800
I've never done that before.

783
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,469
Me, neither.

784
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,805
It's almost time for breakfast.

785
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,062
- Yeah.
- I wish you were here.

786
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,565
- I wish you were here, too.
- Okay.

787
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,443
- (phone clicks)
- Brian?

788
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,905
- Brian.
- (dial tone)

789
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,448
Brian!

790
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:59,076

- Hi.
- Hi.

802
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:48,500
Look, I brought some...
some breakfast.

803
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,963
- Can I come up?
- No.

804
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,423
Why not?

805
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,051
Because first, it will be awkward,
and then strange,

806
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,971
and then weird and then awful.

807
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,057
- What?
- Tonight has been so perfect.

808
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,393
Let's wait for another night
to screw it up.

809
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,021
Can I at least
see your face before I go?

810
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:13,108
No. I have
a pore-minimizing mask on.

811
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,278
Well, then, throw something to me.

812
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,989
Throw something you've
been wearing, and then I'll go.

813
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:44,348
Wow, it's a Ked.

814
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,975
- Woman: Will you shut up?
- What's your problem?

815
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,394
- It's 4:00 in the morning.
- You'd better go.

816
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,563
Okay.

817
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,318
Good night, sweet Abby.

818
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,783
Pleasant dreams.

819
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:16,338
79 people drowned
and another 200 were injured

820
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:19,091
when a passenger ferry
caught fire last night just off...

821
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:23,512
Roy: Sleeping here, Noelle.
Can't you see I'm sleeping?

822
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,015
Sorry, Roy. Sorry.

823
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,186
Just off the coast of Scotland.

824
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,188
Stymied by dense fog,

825
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,608
rescue workers could only hear
the desperate screams...

826
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,528
I said shut up, Noelle!

827
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,365
Jesus!

828
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,434
- Hi.
- Hi.

829
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,061
I had the most amazing conversation
with Brian last night.

830
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:14,604
We spoke for about seven hours.

831
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,275
- And I'm telling him today.
- Seven hours.

832
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,488
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

833
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,492
What? Tell me.

834
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,536
It turns out Roy is a loser.

835
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,997
Tell me something I don't know.

836
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,666
(sniffling)

837
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:39,087
Oh, oh, I was kidding.
I'm sorry.

838
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:42,007
Oh, no, no.
Don't cry.

839
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,967
Oh.

840
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,927
It's okay.

841
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,979
You are no longer allowed
to read this destructive literature.

842
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,900
- (laughs)
- Don't read that.

843
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,069
Oh, no.
Please don't cry.

844
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,241
You're okay.

845
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,120
- How are you gonna tell him?
- God, I don't know.

846
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,663
I was thinking about it all last night.

847
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,790
I just wish there was a way
I could do it

848
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,584
without actually
having to doing it.

849
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,504
- Is your show on today?
- Yeah.

850
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,507
I'll go to his house
and I'll turn on the radio.

851
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,342
And?

852
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,303
Have you ever noticed
how Superman and Clark Kent

853
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,931
are never in the same room
at the same time?

854
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:38,230
Hi.

855
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,357
Can I come in?

856
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,692
Yeah, of course.
Come in.

857
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,702
- Oh!
- Sorry.

858
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,872
- So... you came over.
- Yep.

859
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,959
Last night was...

860
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,127
- Yeah, it was, I know.
- Wasn't it?

861
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,174
So...

862
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:07,968
Buttons?

863
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,886
- What?
- Sew buttons?

864
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,429
- I don't... What?
- It's nothing.

865
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,598
It's just something
my grandmother used to say.

866
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,267
- Really?
- Yeah.

867
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,728
So... buttons...

868
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,772
could I get you something to eat?

869
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,567
- Tuna sandwich or something?
- I don't eat tuna.

870
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,945
- Yes, you do. You ate it last night.
- I did? I did, I did.

871
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,364
In the car,
on the way over, I quit.

872
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,244
- Dolphins.
- Dolphins. Right.

873
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,582
Well, there's plenty of dolphin-friendly
food in the kitchen.

874
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,042
- Good.
- I'll be right back.

875
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,836
Okay. Can I turn
some music on?

876
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:44,004
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

877
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,172
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

878
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,099
(radio turns on, tuning stations)

879
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:01,396
Man over radio:
"Afternoon Becomes Eccentric."

880
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,399
KRWW... talk radio and more.

881
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,526
(mellow music playing)

882
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,786
What do you think of that?

883
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,080
What do I think?

884
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,249
Yes.

885
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,462
- It's nice.
- Mm.

886
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,467
- It's kind of dark.
- Yes. You know,

887
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,511
I was in a dark mood that day
when I took that.

888
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,392
If you'd let me, I'd really like
to take your picture.

889
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,896
Maybe tonight.

890
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:45,398
Maybe.

891
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,567
Or whenever.

892
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,821
This stuff's left over
from a shoot that I did.

893
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,866
I hope you like sweets,
'cause that's all there is.

894
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,868
Oh!

895
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,831
I don't eat that stuff.
I order it, but I can't eat it.

896
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,124
Of course you can.

897
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,086
You take it one bite at a time
and it all goes down.

898
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,254
- No.
- No, really.

899
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,389
- Mm.
- Is that nice?

900
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,307
Mm.

901
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,103
Mmm!

902
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,190
Mm.

903
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,537
(moaning)

904
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,208
This is so good.

905
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,043
More?

906
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,380
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm, mm.

907
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:56,803
- (moaning)

908
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:01,099

916
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,418
I've got something for you.
I forgot.

917
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:45,101
- It's a book.
- Yeah.

918
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:50,148
It's the letters Simone de Beauvoir
wrote to Sartre.

919
00:51:56,322 --> 00:52:00,158
What? You haven't
got it already, have you?

920
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:03,119
No, I don't have it already.

921
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,121
It's just that...

922
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,124
no one's ever given me a book before
that didn't have pictures in it.

923
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,292
(snickers)

924
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,169
Well, I'm glad you like it.

925
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:14,214
I love it.

926
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,176
Wow, I mean... it's...

927
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,845
- A book.
- A book!

928
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:27,477
It's funny how self-conscious
we both are, considering...

929
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,021
What do you mean, self-conscious?

930
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,649
I mean,
you have to admit

931
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:36,486
you're not the same person you were
on the phone last night.

932
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:40,073
- That's true.
- Why?

933
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:44,661
Is it because we did?

934
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:48,540
It's because I'm stupid.

935
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,667
Well, me, too.

936
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,794
Completely feeble-minded.

937
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:57,173
All you have to do is get near me
and I turn into this gibbering idiot.

938
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:04,013
You're so clever and funny
and modest and sweet.

939
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,768
And you're so...

940
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:14,232
You're really so bea...

941
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,193
I mean, my God.

942
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,532
Look at you.

943
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,243
You're an angel.

944
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,210
♪ You do something to me ♪

945
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,257
♪ Somewhere deep inside... ♪

946
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:44,596
- I can't do this. I can't.
- Just try and see what happens.

947
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,352
Man over radio:
Next up is Dr. Abby Barnes

948
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,062
with "The Truth
About Cats and Dogs."

949
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,440
Oh, no. No.

950
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,191
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- It's okay.

951
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,735
You've got five...
you've got five minutes.

952
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,862
I can get you there in time.

953
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,906
- It's...
- I've got...

954
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,741
- I've gotta tell you something.
- What?

955
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,659
- I'm...
- What?

956
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,578
I'm... I'm late.

957
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,459
(tires screeching)

958
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:15,668
What am I doing?

959
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,629
What, you think we should stop
and call or something?

960
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,632
- No calls!
- Okay, okay.

961
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,177
- I've messed up really bad.
- Well, you're only two minutes late.

962
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:28,765
It can't be that bad.
Let's just see what they're doing.

963
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,142
No! Let me.

964
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,936
- Oh!
- Give me that.

965
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,604
- Shit.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

966
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,397
It's okay, it's okay.
I can get another one.

967
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,775
It's all right. Leave it.
I can get another one somewhere.

968
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:41,527
I think they still sell them in Bolivia.

969
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,529
God, you should clean this place up.

970
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,115
- (thumps)
- Oh.

971
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,621
(tires screeching)

972
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,465
Thanks for the ride.

973
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:07,553
Here's your button.

974
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,562
Abby over radio:
So she's been licking her belly.

975
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,147
Is she really sensitive in that area?

976
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,150
- Woman: No, not really.
- She's not sensitive in her belly.

977
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,021
Sorry.

978
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:18,249
Hey, on Tuesday's show
I wanna talk about potbellied pigs.

979
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,710
- Come, come, come.
- (door buzzes)

980
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,392
(silent)

981
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:42,565
(door buzzes)

982
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,442
Noelle:
That was scary.

983
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,402
We started with the show on tape.

984
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,071
It's okay.

985
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,574
Uh, Abby?
You're on in 60.

986
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,786
Is it okay if I hang around
and watch?

987
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,080
Women:
No!

988
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,083
- You need to concentrate.
- You need to concentrate.

989
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,752
- (thumps)
- You... you need to concentrate.

990
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,963
- I need to concentrate.
- Okay, I understand.

991
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,800
- I'll see you later, then.
- Bye.

992
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,927
So I guess you didn't tell him.

993
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,601
Take him.
I don't want to fight.

994
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,729
I refuse to degenerate
into some misogynistic cliché.

995
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,606
Having said that,
how could you do this to me?

996
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,608
I was gonna tell him.
I was all set to do it.

997
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,360
The show was starting
and I just couldn't.

998
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,695
- Why not?
- Well, he wouldn't listen.

999
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,823
- What was he doing?
- Nothing.

1000
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,283
Then why didn't you let him find out
when the radio show started?

1001
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,244
Maybe it was all the cake
he fed me.

1002
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,412
What is that?
The Twinkie defense?

1003
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,627
He gave us a book.

1004
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,629
Which one?

1005
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:50,133
Simon somebody's letters
to John Paul somebody.

1006
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,968
Simone de Beauvoir's letters
to Jean-Paul Sartre?

1007
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,261
- Exactly.
- Aw!

1008
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,637
Don't you see?
He said I was smart.

1009
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,348
Nobody's ever said that
to me before.

1010
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,642
I just couldn't stand
to tell him it wasn't true.

1011
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,186
Smart and beautiful, though, right?

1012
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,647
Okay, I've got two ideas
how we can fix this.

1013
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,274
We find out
how he really feels about us,

1014
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,817
but in a roundabout kind of way.

1015
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,527
So we go over to his house,

1016
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,530
and I just sort of casually
ask him something like:

1017
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,615
If you were stranded
on a desert island...

1018
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,159
- Trite!
- Okay.

1019
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:20,204
If you were stranded
in that bubble thing in Arizona...

1020
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,790
- Biosphere?
...who would you take with you?

1021
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:26,460
"Time" magazine's Woman of the Year
or "Playboy"'s Playmate of the Year?

1022
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,755
I object to those categories
on both our behalves.

1023
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,174
What's idea number two?

1024
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,260
We go over there, get shit-faced
and see what happens.

1025
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,012
Okay.

Hello. What...?

1028
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,521
- Not so fast. Hello.
- Hi.

1029
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,691

If you were trapped in Biosphere 2
for three years,

1099
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,536
who would you bring:

1100
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:14,498
"Time" magazine's Woman of the Year
or "Playboy"'s Playmate of the Year?

1103
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,234
Abby, where are you going?

1104
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:45,404
I am hammered.
I gotta go home.

01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,031
Oh, I'll go home with you.

No, you're having fun.
He really likes you.

What? What about you?

1108

No, I don't even...

1109
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,709
- You don't what?
- Is everything okay?

1110
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,420
Yeah. I just remembered
I have to be somewhere.

1111
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,924
- Secret rendezvous?
- You know it.

1112
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,513
What about you?
Are you gonna stay?

1113
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:57,226
Hi. My dog, Casey-Kay,
she's getting kinda old and slow

1114
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,228
and just not what she used to be.

1115
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,771
And I was wondering
if there was something...

1116
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:03,107
Right, so you're telling me
she's no longer young and attractive,

1117
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:05,317
so you're seeking my approval
to have her put to sleep?

1118
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:08,904
Well, no. Actually, I was gonna
ask about vitamins or something...

1119
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,739
You know who I think
should be put to sleep?

1120
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,741
People like you
who only want cute dogs.

1121
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,660
And I hope that aesthetically
unpleasant dog of yours

1122
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,245
bites you in the ass
and moves on.

1123
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,998
- Wait a minute. You got the wrong...
- Next caller.

1124
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,376
(ringing)

1125
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:25,337
(over machine) Hi, this is Abby.
Please don't hang up.

1126
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,923
I hate hang-ups.
Leave it.

1127
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,800
(beeps)

1128
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:32,595
Noelle over phone: Good evening
and welcome to the 6:00 news.

1129
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,264
Noelle Slusarsky
suffered a major setback

1130
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,017
in her ongoing quest
to become an adult this week

1131
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:42,062
when she tried to steal
her best friend's boyfriend.

1132
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,273
Abby, please pick up
if you're there.

1133
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,276
There's something I need to tell you,
but not on the machine, okay?

1134
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,863
Okay, I'm going out
of town on a job.

1135
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:52,114
I'll call.

1136
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,284
(yelling in German)

1137
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,873
Noelle over phone:
Hi. It's me, Noelle.

1138
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:03,292
Please pick up the phone, Abby.

1139
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,253
Abby?

1140
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:09,089
(sighs)

1141
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:12,134
Okay, so you're not
gonna pick up the phone.

1142
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:15,220
This is what I had to tell you.

1143
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,514
I didn't sleep with him.

1144
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:24,146
We started wrestling around
and kissing,

1145
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,231
but he kept calling your name.

1146
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:29,443
"Abby, Abby, oh, Abby!"

1147
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:32,696
And I could hear it in his voice.
He meant it.

1148
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:36,450
So, I stopped.

1149
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:41,664
I told him it was all
moving too fast for me.

1150
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,501
And I haven't called him since.

1151
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,838
Hi. Did you ever
look in the mirror so long

1152
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,508
that your face doesn't
make sense anymore?

1153
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:55,552
It just becomes all these shapes.

1154
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,847
Just shapes.
Not good or bad.

1155
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,395
Remember when he took
our pictures?

1156
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,897
You looked really good.

1157
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:09,149
Did I tell you that?

1158
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:19,535
I'm reading two books at the moment,
if you can believe that...

1159
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,370
the one that Brian got us
and a dictionary

1160
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,540
so I can understand
the one that Brian got us.

1161
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,542
I'm avoiding a guy
who calls me "Abby"

1162
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,585
and I'm very frightened
that I screwed up a friendship

1163
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:31,672
with the nicest woman
I've ever met.

1164
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,718
When I come home,
I'm gonna fix things.

1165
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,886
I'm gonna fix everything.

1166
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:44,518
I'm sorry.
I just miss you.

1167
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,771
- Hello? Hello?
- (dial tone)

1168
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,071
And deep cleanser.

1169
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,532
Abby: I really appreciate
you taking this back.

1170
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,659
And I really appreciate
your attitude taking this back.

1171
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,327
Donna.

1172
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,205
Donna. Donna.

1173
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:09,084
- Donna?
- Hi.

1174
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,627
I was calling your name.

1175
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:14,465
Oh, I must be in a daze.
I didn't hear you.

1176
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:15,799
Department stores.

1177
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,050
- I get that, too.
- Yeah.

1178
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:20,179
- Sorry, you were buying something.
- No, I was returning something.

1179
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:24,641
Oh. Well, I just bought
a present for Abby.

1180
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,435
Look at this.

1181
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:29,438
It's a photo album
and I had her initials embossed.

1182
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:30,689
See? Abby Barnes.

1183
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,484
- Oh, that's pretty.
- Do you think she'll like it?

1184
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,445
- I do, yeah.
- Great. Are you finished?

1185
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,698
- Mm-hmm.
- Right. Can I walk you out?

1186
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:42,576
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1187
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,496
(seagulls screeching)

1188
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,123
Did she tell you that she's not
talking to me for a week?

1189
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:51,627
- Is that right?
- Yeah. It's driving me mad.

1190
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:53,629
You see her all the time.

1191
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:55,589
I don't suppose she's mentioned
anything about...

1192
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,132
Mm-mm, she hasn't said
a word to me.

1193
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,676
No, of course not.

1194
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,637
I heard her on the air today.
She was brilliant.

1195
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:04,014
- (laughs) Brilliant?
- Yes.

1196
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,517
Oh, that's a bit much,
don't you think?

1197
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,060
Are we getting jealous?

1198
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,813
No, trust me,
that's not even possible.

1199
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,815
You know, before I listened
to Abby on the radio,

1200
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,317
I never really would have
given a cat the time of day.

1201
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,946
I think I'm beginning
to understand them a bit more.

1202
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,240
- Or maybe not.
- Whoops.

1203
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,702
Well, you look like a cat-lover
from way back.

1204
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,997
- Hi.
- I think she likes you, too.

1205
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,167
- Do you know much about animals?
- A little bit.

1206
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,837
Of course. You've got
all those goats, haven't you?

1207
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,672
When you go to college,
do you have this thing in England

1208
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,173
called the Freshman 10?

1209
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,842
- No, we don't.
- Do they have that?

1210
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:44,346
It's traditionally where most girls
who go off to college gain 10 pounds.

1211
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,015
- Although, when I went, I gained 40.
- 40?

1212
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,309
40 pounds, and I'm 5'1 ".

1213
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:51,311
So four times the required amount?

1214
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:54,982
So you can imagine how popular I was
with all the 18-year-old boys.

1215
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,651
What has happened to me in the past
is that I meet a woman...

1216
01:09:57,819 --> 01:09:59,278
- Do you mind that I'm telling you this?
- No, sir.

1217
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:02,698
I meet a woman I'm attracted to
and hopefully she's attracted to me.

1218
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:04,408
And it's very exciting,

1219
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:07,911
and then I get to know her,
and we have nothing in common.

1220
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,580
Or the opposite happens.

1221
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,915
There's lots in common,
fabulous woman,

1222
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,376
but there's no excitement,
there's no sparks.

1223
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:17,045
Okay, so say you meet
one of these no-sparks women

1224
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,964
and you really take the time
to get to know her,

1225
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:21,174
and then you become
intellectually stimulated by her.

1226
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,385
You just really enjoy
her personality,

1227
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,388
thereby igniting
all your lust and passion.

1228
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,891
Have you ever thought about that?

1229
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,187
Are you going to eat that?

1230
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,036
- Are you cold?
- No, I'm fine.

1231
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:52,080
You're shivering.
Here, wear my coat.

1232
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,584
- So chivalrous.
- Yeah.

1233
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:59,212
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1234
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,882
Seriously.
I'll just get the buttons.

1235
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:10,182
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

1236
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:13,018
Your hands are freezing.
Come here.

1237
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,939
(blowing)

1238
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,908
Put them in the pockets.

1239
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,494
There's nothing disgusting
in there, is there?

1240
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:34,456
- Who did that?
- (laughs)

1241
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,959
Who put that piece of chocolate
in my pocket?

1242
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,171
You're missing it.
Look.

1243
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,763
- Brian: Are you warm enough?
- Getting there.

1244
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,984
Do you always watch sunsets
with your eyes shut?

1245
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,444
- Yeah, it's kind of a religious thing.
- Really?

1246
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,488
No.

1247
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,492
Do you know,
if you listen very carefully,

1248
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:14,830
you can hear the moment
when the sun hits the hills?

1249
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,416
Shh.

1250
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:25,590
Not today, obviously.

1251
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,096
- I'm having a...
- What?

1252
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:37,185
- Nothing. I had a really nice time.
- Oh, me, too.

1253
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,275
I gotta go.

1254
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,736
Okay.

1255
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,863
Okay. Thank you.

1256
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:50,657
- Thanks for the walk.
- Thanks.

1257
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:52,617
Bye.

1258
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,620
- Donna?
- Yeah?

1259
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:59,875
If you see Abby, tell her...

1260
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,213
tell her I miss her face.

1261
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,095
Yeah.

1262
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:24,566
Abby? Hi.

1263
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:27,611
I just need to talk to you.
10 minutes. 10 minutes.

1264
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:31,073
So we can clear everything up.

1265
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,118
5:00?

1266
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:37,871
Your place.
Great, great, great.

1267
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,290
All right. See ya. Bye.

1268
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:58,266
Aah!

1269
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,268
Jesus, you scared me.

1270
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,145
I thought you'd be coming
from over there.

1271
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,940
- Mm-mm, I was watching you.
- You weren't.

1272
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:07,567
I was practicing looking relaxed.

1273
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:11,113
- You looked relaxed.
- Did I? You look gorgeous.

1274
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,240
- It's my job.
- Is it?

1275
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,408
Speaking of work...

1276
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,247
This was a little bit
too much for me.

1277
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:21,790
- Was it?
- Mm.

1278
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,000
I had to read each page,
like, three times.

1279
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:27,587
I'm more of a mystery kind of girl,
or maybe a romance.

1280
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,131
I bet you wouldn't have
guessed that about me.

1281
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,966
No, but that's okay.

1282
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:33,510
I mean, romance would be fine.

1283
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:34,678
Did I ever tell you

1284
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:36,513
I used to only date guys
who couldn't speak English?

1285
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,056
I've missed you so much.

1286
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,850
It took ages to find out
it wasn't working

1287
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,434
'cause I couldn't understand
what they were saying.

1288
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:44,563
- I speak English.
- And then I dated this guy, Roy.

1289
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:48,316
- I hated everything he liked about me.
- You have the most beautiful mouth.

1290
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,318
We have to stop.

1291
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,113
Abby, I love you.

1292
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:55,824
You love a girl I could never be.

1293
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,035
- You don't love me.
- Yes, I do.

1294
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,580
I don't understand what you're saying.
Just tell me what's going on.

1295
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,039
- You need to know.
- Yes.

1296
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:04,791
You do.
So make a list.

1297
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:06,459
Make a list of everything
you love about me.

1298
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:07,627
A list?

1299
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:10,463
Oh, I gotta go.
I have an audition in 20 minutes.

1300
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:12,132
- An audition?
- Yes, for the news.

1301
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,300
I wanna read for the news.

1302
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:17,179
- What about "Cats and Dogs"?
- The cats and dogs are covered.

1303
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,181
So make a list.
Bring it.

1304
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,683
5:00, my place.

1305
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,478
(all reading)
79 people drowned

1306
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:26,646
and another 200 were injured...

1307
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:30,108
...their four-mile journey
came to a tragic and watery end.

1308
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:34,446
79 people drowned
and another 200 were injured...

1309
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,751
(blues music on radio)

1310
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,840
(knocking at door)

1311
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,884
- Brian: Abby?
- (knocking continues)

1312
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,594
- Abby!
- Coming.

1313
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,597
- (music blaring)
- Hang on, I can't hear you.

1314
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:02,140
- It's me.
- (turns off radio)

1315
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,267
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1316
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,729
Hi.

1317
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,607
- Donna. Where's Abby?
- She's not here.

1318
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:11,900
No, what are you talking about?

1319
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,652
I just heard her voice.
I know she's here.

1320
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,862
Right. She's not here here.

1321
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,864
She's in the bathroom
taking a bath.

1322
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:20,909
But I will tell her
that you came by, okay?

1323
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,036
I've got an appointment.

1324
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:28,792
I don't know that that would be
a very good idea right now.

1325
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,669
Uh, but I'll tell her
that you're here

1326
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,421
and perhaps she will
come out... eventually.

1327
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,425
It's Brian.
He wants to talk to you.

1328
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,885
(high-pitched)
Tell him to come back in half an hour!

1329
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:40,095
(normal voice)
I don't think he can be dissuaded.

1330
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,263
(high-pitched)
Tell him if he doesn't come back

1331
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,931
in half an hour,
I will call the whole thing off!

1332
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,308
(normal voice)
You're the boss.

1333
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:50,981
What did she say?
She was acting so strangely before.

1334
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,941
- Is she all right?
- She's a little bit out of it.

1335
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,152
- I think that she'll call you later.
- Okay.

1336
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:58,863
Abby, it's me.

1337
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:02,284
I wrote down the things
that you asked me to.

1338
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,497
Listen, could you do me a favor?

1339
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:10,875
She's worried
that I don't love her, so...

1340
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,296
Sit down. You be Abby.

1341
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,340
- I'm Abby.
- I've made this list.

1342
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,218
It's a sort of lover's list.

1343
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:23,221
Now, if I could just run it
by you once

1344
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,223
to get a female opinion on it,

1345
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:27,934
then we can make any adjustments
you think that it might need.

1346
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:29,978
Sure.

1347
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:35,275
One: I love the way you walk
into a room and it lights up.

1348
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,988
Two: I love your eyes.

1349
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:41,948
When they fix on mine,
they burn into me,

1350
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,451
and I forget what it is
that I wanted to say.

1351
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:49,205
Three: I love the way we think
of things at the same time.

1352
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:53,001
Four: I love the way you make
a tuna fish sandwich an event.

1353
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,880
Five: The way you talk to me
on the phone and...

1354
01:17:57,048 --> 01:17:59,341
- (crumples paper)
- Shit, this is ridiculous.

1355
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,842
No, four and five aren't bad.

1356
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,971
You know, maybe she's right.
Maybe I am rushing things.

1357
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,517
No, I'm not.

1358
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,814
Abby...

1359
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,858
I love you,

1360
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:21,863
because I can't stop thinking
about you for one second,

1361
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,490
and because I stay at home
every afternoon

1362
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:27,327
when I should be working,
just to hear you on the radio.

1363
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,497
And because I want
to read you to sleep every night

1364
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:33,208
and wake up to you
playing violin every morning.

1365
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,382
And because you're so beautiful.

1366
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,510
You forgot to say, "I love you
because you're so beautiful."

1367
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:45,887
No, I didn't.

1368
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:48,973
And yes, she is,
but that's not why I love her.

1369
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,893
I love her for who she is.

1370
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,687
And if she weren't,
it wouldn't matter.

1371
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,815
Of course it matters.
It always matters.

1372
01:18:56,982 --> 01:19:00,110
- No, the truth is...
- The truth is Helen of Troy.

1373
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:04,406
- What?
- Helen of Troy... men die for that shit.

1374
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,033
The truth is you would not be
so enamored with Abby

1375
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:10,703
if she looked like...
if she looked like...

1376
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,997
What?
What are you talking about?

1377
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:17,168
Look, you know how someone's
appearance can change

1378
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:18,711
the longer you know them,

1379
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:21,256
how a really attractive person,
if you don't like them,

1380
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:23,007
can become
more and more ugly,

1381
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:26,219
whereas someone you might
not even have noticed,

1382
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:30,932
that you wouldn't look at
more than once,

1383
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,809
if you love them,

1384
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:36,187
can become the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

1385
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:39,607
All you want to do is be near them.

1386
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,776
I love Abby.

1387
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,197
It doesn't matter
what she looks like.

1388
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,911
(sniffling)

1389
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,873
What's the matter?

1390
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,876
I'm happy that you said that.

1391
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:01,045
Well, I'm glad you like it,

1392
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,964
'cause she hasn't said a word.

1393
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,926
(thuds)

1394
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,666
It was you on the phone that night.

1395
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:41,461
Yep.

1396
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:45,089
That's your window...

1397
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,844
your violin.

1398
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,346
Yeah.

1399
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:54,766
And that's your cat.

1400
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,185
(clears throat)

1401
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:59,020
Hi.

1402
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:03,733
Is this a joke?

1403
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,903
Abby:
It was a mistake.

1404
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,948
- Who are you?
- That's Noelle.

1405
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,450
- Noelle?
- Slusarsky.

1406
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:15,245
- Who's Donna?
- There is no Donna.

1407
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:16,579
What is this?

1408
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:20,542
Is this some kind of weird game
you two play for kicks?

1409
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,169
You pick up a guy together and see
how much you can screw him up?

1410
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,256
- No, it was just a mistake.
- A practical joke.

1411
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:27,632
- A joke?
- No, no, no, not a joke.

1412
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,385
- Not a joke funny ha-ha.
- Funny strange, if anything.

1413
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:31,844
No, I get it.
You're a comedy duo.

1414
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,388
Actually, we never met until just...

1415
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:37,058
You're dumb and beautiful,
and you're smart and...

1416
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,521
I have to go.

1417
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:56,369
Brian!

1418
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:06,254
Abby:
He doesn't wanna see me.

1419
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:08,423
He doesn't wanna see you.

1420
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:10,508
Why did you send him
back to me

1421
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,510
when you could have had him
for yourself?

1422
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,512
I know you wanted him.

1423
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,307
Because I wanted my friend back.

1424
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:24,022
Besides, he's got
this small personal habit

1425
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,232
that just drives me crazy.

1426
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,776
What's that?

1427
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,945
He loves you.

1428
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:45,960
- Well, how'd your audition go?
- It didn't.

1429
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:48,254
Didn't make the cut.

1430
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:51,341
Still not dignified enough
for the news.

1431
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:54,218
Well...

1432
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:55,928
they're looking
for someone at the station.

1433
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:59,474
It's not the news,
but I think it's interesting.

1434
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:03,436
- Are you serious?
- They're expecting your phone call.

1435
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,446
- Thank you.
- You should give it a shot.

1436
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,911
You should give it
one more shot, Abby.

1437
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,830
Just go and talk to him,

1438
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,791
you dumb bitch.

1439
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,669
- I'm a dumb bitch?
- That's right.

1440
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,296
Well, you're a dumb bitch,
too, you know.

1441
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:33,049
Yeah, I know.
We're related.

1442
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,198
- (barks)
- Hi, sweetie.

1443
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,075
I'm glad you're here.

1444
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,209
Hi.

1445
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:11,337
- I came to return your jacket.
- Thank you.

1446
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:14,132
You can just leave it
on the stool there.

1447
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,636
I'm really sorry that I lied to you.

1448
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:21,639
It's just the situation
got completely out of control.

1449
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:30,231
It's mentally exhausting,

1450
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,569
feeling really bad about something
you can't do anything about.

1451
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:37,029
Right.
That explains everything.

1452
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:39,532
- No, Brian...
- What? What do you want?

1453
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,617
I want you to look at me.

1454
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,749
I'm looking at you.

1455
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,420
You know the conversations
that we've had

1456
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:55,590
and the violin
and the radio show

1457
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:59,677
and that incredible night
on the phone?

1458
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:03,598
That really meant something to me.
It was really important to me.

1459
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:08,561
But all of that stuff doesn't come
in a perfect package.

1460
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:13,483
It comes in this one.

1461
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:17,904
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

1462
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:20,990
I didn't feel confident
that you'd give me a chance.

1463
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:25,703
Now we'll never know, will we?

1464
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,771
- Okay.
- Okay.

1465
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:08,079
I'm at the mechanic's
and I'm getting my tune-up,

1466
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,498
and I look up on the wall

1467
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,334
and there she is
looking back at me.

1468
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,211
But you know what tipped it off

1469
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:19,090
was when she was dealing
with that turtle and she was like...

1470
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:21,259
That ain't professional.

1471
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:24,470
You're right.

1472
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,057
But then, we didn't have much
to compare it to.

1473
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:30,852
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
But you know what?

1474
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:34,981
It's not your fault, brother.
I mean, who knew?

1475
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:52,623
Woman over phone:
My German shepherd

1476
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:53,791
is driving me insane.

1477
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:55,960
I left him home alone for one afternoon
and you know what he did?

1478
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:59,380
- He peed on your bed.
- No, in my bed. He peed in my bed.

1479
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,716
He took his teeth,
pulled back the sheets first.

1480
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:04,719
That's very considerate of him,
but are you sure that's all he did?

1481
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:06,971
Have you checked
inside your favorite shoes yet?

1482
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:09,015
No. Hold on.

1483
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,892
I'll go look over there right now.

1484
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,268
(door opens)

1485
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:15,229
- Woman: Oh, my God!
- (Abby laughing)

1486
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:17,773
- Pinky, you're a bad, bad, bad dog!
- Listen... ok... okay, listen.

1487
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:20,026
Don't worry about it.
I wanna explain something.

1488
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,570
Dogs don't like to be left alone.

1489
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:25,072
It's not like when you leave,
he goes "Great.

1490
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,866
Time to finish writing my novel."

1491
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:30,745
No. When their humans leave,
dogs get depressed and they show it.

1492
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:33,122
- Yeah, in your shoes.
- Mm-hmm.

1493
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:37,126
Listen, people are very good
about hiding their misery.

1494
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:38,836
But your dog tearing up
your apartment...

1495
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,755
he was trying
to tell you something.

1496
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:42,798
What?

1497
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:48,554
- I wanna be with you.
- You do?

1498
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,809
- With me?
- (barking)

1499
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:56,854
No, I don't wanna be with you.

1500
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:59,065
Woman: What am I supposed
to do about this dog?

1501
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,691
Am I just supposed
to put on my poo shoes

1502
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:03,402
- and go out shopping?
- I have absolutely no idea.

1503
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,363
Pinky, Pinky, you sit there
and listen to the doctor!

1504
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,573
I have absolutely
no idea what to do.

1505
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:10,952
- Wrap it up!
- Oh, wrap it up!

1506
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,039
We're gonna wrap it up
and I will talk to everyone tomorrow.

1507
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,749
Woman:
I've been waiting 45 minutes!

1508
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,128
- Hi. Hi. Do you think he's here?
- I didn't see him.

1509
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,965
He could be here, right?

1510
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,509
- (growls softly)
- (gasps)

1511
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:32,640
Okay.

1512
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:39,146
- (Abby yelling)
- (Hank barking)

1513
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,440
Stop. Please, please, please.

1514
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:46,112
Oh, my God!

1515
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,906
Whoa! Oh!

1516
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:51,659
Whoa. Okay, okay.

1517
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,121
(whistles)

1518
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:59,333
Whoa!

1519
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,002
Oh!

1520
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:05,339
- It's cool, it's cool.
- Sorry. Sorry.

1521
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:11,345
Okay?

1522
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:15,641
- Can I take these off now?
- Yeah, of course.

1523
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:17,685
Over here. I'll help you.

1524
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,855
Thanks.

1525
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:23,315
- I'm fine. Thank you.
- Right.

1526
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,360
Ahhh!

1527
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,695
Now, should I get down
on all fours

1528
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,364
and then gently apply pressure
to the tips of your ears?

1529
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:33,034
- I won't bite you.
- No.

1530
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,622
So, is this humiliation on skates

1531
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,416
staged for your amusement,
or am I missing...?

1532
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:42,418
No, no, of course not.

1533
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:46,047
I just wanted to get you
out here in private

1534
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,507
to discuss a few things.

1535
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:53,220
The humiliation was just a bonus.

1536
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,186
What are we discussing?

1537
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:02,730
Well, there's the issue of Hank,

1538
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:06,567
who's in a terrible state
without you.

1539
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,569
Weren't you, Hank?
Hank.

1540
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,321
Come on, boy.
Come on.

1541
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:13,240
- Terrible state.
- (groans)

1542
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,452
- Abby: Oh! Oh.
- (barks)

1543
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,996
No, this is beneath you.
Never stoop.

1544
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:21,207
Brian:
No, really, he couldn't sleep.

1545
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:22,958
And he kept me up all night,

1546
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:24,835
wanting to talk about
why it took us so...

1547
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:27,254
why it took me so long

1548
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,091
to understand
what was really going on.

1549
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:35,387
And then we wrote some
extraordinarily bad poetry together.

1550
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:40,101
No, no, mine wasn't that bad.
Hank's was... pathetic.

1551
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:42,436
And then we fought over
which one of us

1552
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:45,606
got to carry your shoe around
in his mouth.

1553
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:47,691
And...

1554
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:01,080
Abby...

1555
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:05,209
I only ever loved one woman,

1556
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:08,170
and I don't want to lose her twice.

1557
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,830
I gotta tell you something.

1558
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,583
What?

1559
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,377
That night on the phone?

1560
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:49,962
Yeah?

1561
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,923
I'm pregnant.

1562
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:59,138
Darling...

1563
01:32:21,995 --> 01:32:23,996
Brian:
Are you sure it was me?

1564
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:28,292
Abby: Actually, I don't know.
I made a lot of calls that night.
