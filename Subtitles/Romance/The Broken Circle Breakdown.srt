00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,997
Ghent, June 2006

2
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,672
Round your arm.

3
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,558
Look at Mummy.

4
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,352
It'll feel a bit tight.

5
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,878
Keep still, sweetie.

6
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,279
Don't cry.

7
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,758
All done. All done.

8
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,593
Don't do that. It's all done now.

9
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,793
Right. The doctor will see you now.

10
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,993
And I'll stay with this little lady.
- Be good, eh?

11
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,752
Hello, little lady.

12
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,110
What's this?
- My rucksack.

13
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,396
No, it's a giant ladybird.
- It's a rucksack!

14
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,589
A giant ladybird!

15
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,636
Hello, doctor.
- Come in.

16
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,070
Can you watch on your own for a moment?
Mummy and Daddy are just popping out.

17
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,788
There's a good girl.

18
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,430
Can we agree on one thing?

19
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,509
We do our crying at home.
When we're in here we're positive, OK?

20
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,235
OK.

21
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,035
Come on.

22
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,114
Look at her.

23
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,998
She's fine.
- Yeah...

24
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,509
Isn't she?

25
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,789
We're going to shoot it dead tomorrow.

26
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,757
What are we going to do?
- Shoot the cancer dead.

27
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,114
Yes!
- Yes!

28
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,078
Bump heads!

29
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,355
Go to sleep now, you silly sausage.
- That'll do.

30
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,437
7 years previously

31
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,275
Does all that belong to you?
- Yes.

32
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,558
Wow! Very nice!
- But it needs a lot of work done to it.

33
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,912
Still...
- So for now I sleep... there.

34
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,433
In that caravan?

35
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,789
You're a real cowboy after all!
- I do my best.

36
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,594
Is that horse yours too?
- Yes, that's Earl.

37
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,752
Chickens!

38
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,430
Is he bad-tempered?
- No, he's very sweet-natured.

39
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,877
J.D. Crowe and The New South.
Then the Tony Rice Unit.

40
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,158
Manzanita is definitely
my favourite CD ever.

41
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,232
He used to have a fantastic voice.

42
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,676
But he lost It.
It's such a shame.

43
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,595
I don't know how. Following an illness
or something. Or a bit too much whisky!

44
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,556
Why do you play the banjo?

45
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,510
I'm too stupid to play the guitar
and too dumb to play the mandolin.

46
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,955
No, no. I used to be a punk rocker

47
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,398
and a banjo sort of snarls,
which reminds me of punk rock.

48
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,113
I love it.

49
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,834
How come you've got so many tattoos?

50
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,113
Elise?

51
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,831
Hi, cowboy.

52
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,028
Seeing as you don't want a tattoo...

53
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,435
Do you like it?

54
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,592
Yes.

55
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,550
Good afternoon.
- Shhh, shhh.

56
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,313
Here we are with lunch.

57
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,399
She's just fallen asleep.
- The hospital has its set times.

58
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,394
Maybelle is ill!
- Sweetheart...

59
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,955
Ill!
- Sweetheart...

60
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,511
You could say something too, Didier.
- Say what? Eh? What?

61
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,953
Sorry.

62
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,993
Sorry.

63
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,148
Hey, Maybelle.

64
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,232
Sorry, sweetie.
Mummy shouldn't shout like that, eh?

65
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,393
Sorry.

66
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,148
Sorry.
- It's alright.

67
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,149
Now we're going to do our best to sit
very still. You'll feel a little prick.

68
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,312
Well done.

69
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,077
OK, ready?

70
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,875
That hurt.

71
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,112
You knew, eh? Who gave it to me?
- Your mummy.

72
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,036
Before that it belonged to
my mummy's mummy.

73
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,875
And before that to
my mummy's mummy's mummy.

74
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,235
And now I'm giving it to you.

75
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,557
Because I'm your mummy.

76
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,797
And when you're grown up,
you can give it to your little girl.

77
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,114
But until then I want you to hold on
tightly to it when you feel sad,

78
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,431
or when you're scared
or when you feel lonely.

79
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,031
Then close your eyes
and think of something nice.

80
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,679
Shall we give it a try?

81
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,552
Dirt-poor fortune-hunters
from all over the world

82
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,393
were there on the Appalachians,

83
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,797
on that slate
that was bloody difficult to mine.

84
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,677
The Spaniard had a guitar,
the Italian a mandolin,

85
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,718
the Jew a violin
and the African a banjar,

86
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,872
from which the banjo is descended.

87
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,516
To combat the hunger and the misery,
they started singing songs

88
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,877
about their dreams of a promised land,

89
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,192
often about their fear of dying,

90
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,397
their hope for a better life
in the hereafter

91
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,628
and their sorrow, their hard life.

92
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,119
Didier?

93
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,598
Didier?

94
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,311
Elise, can you come and help me,
sweetheart?

95
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,748
Where are you?

96
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,438
Didier?

97
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,155
What?

98
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,878
What's the matter?

99
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,078
Are you alright, sweetheart?

100
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,309
I'm pregnant.

101
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,352
Three months.

102
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,598
What?

103
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,393
Maybe I don't want that.

104
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,796
How did that happen?
How come?

105
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,556
I... I've never been regular.

106
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,352
What do you think?

107
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,793
That I knew?
That I've tricked you into this?

108
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,794
Maybe I don't want to make decisions
about someone else's life.

109
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,518
I didn't know.

110
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,431
D'you expect us to carry on
living in that caravan with a baby?

111
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,188
Hello, Maybelle.
- Hello, doctor.

112
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,396
I love your face.

113
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,036
You can go home tomorrow.
- Yes!

114
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,956
Great, eh? But you have to
come back in a few weeks.

115
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,758
Like I told you, eh?
- Yes.

116
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,071
Then we can see
if Captain Chemo won the fight.

117
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,673
Thank you, doctor.

118
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,877
What are you?
- A tiger.

119
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,234
A tiger.

120
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,634
And what is Mummy?
- A butterfly.

121
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,391
What do tigers do?

122
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,034
What's that?

123
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,599
Can you hear what I can hear?
There's someone in our house.

124
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,957
Do you dare go and take a look?
Cos I don't. Go and see.

125
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,199
Are you going to go and see?

126
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,270
Well? Can you see anything?

127
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,639
Funny, aren't they?

128
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,275
I'm so pleased you're back.
- Welcome home.

129
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,313
That's beautiful!

130
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,670
Do you like it?
- Yes.

131
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,595
Go on.
- What?

132
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,239
Carry on.

133
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,159
Hey, darling.
- Yeah?

134
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,313
How about building a veranda
onto the front of the house?

135
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,798
A what? A veranda?

136
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,509
There's nothing more useless
than a veranda.

137
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,070
You never sit in it.
You bought some steak tartare.

138
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,869
But it'd be great, wouldn't it?
- A veranda is great.

139
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,715
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
In summer you go outside when it's hot

140
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,270
and in winter you stay indoors
by the stove.

141
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,319
But we live in Belgium,
where it's a bit too cold to sit outside

142
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,556
and a bit too hot to stay indoors.

143
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,910
You really bought some steak tartare?

144
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,388
That's not steak tartare!
- It's vegetarian. Nice, isn't it?

145
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,238
Bloody hell! Come on!

146
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,188
I don't like sitting in the wind
and neither does our baby.

147
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,674
So it's decided, you need a veranda.

148
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,354
OK, you'll get your veranda but this is
the last time you use that argument.

149
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,310
Thanks.
- What? It's only a veranda.

150
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,719
Well? Do you know what it is yet?
- A baby, I reckon.

151
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,510
But I can't be sure. With Didier being
such a stallion, it could be a foal.

152
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,355
Shit.

153
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,595
It's coming. My water has broken.

154
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,077
Keep calm. Sit down.
- No.

155
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,992
Keep calm, keep calm.

156
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,751
Elise has had the baby. It's a girl.

157
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,831
Yes, it's really...

158
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,150
Maybelle. Maybelle.

159
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,390
Yes, like Maybelle Carter.

160
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,712
You know nothing about names!

161
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,154
No, no. Hands down.

162
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,068
What's that?

163
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,395
What?

164
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,388
That's not a veranda, sweetheart.
- No... No, it's a 'terranda'.

165
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,918
The perfect combination of
a terrace and a veranda.

166
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,398
It's lovely. It's wonderful. Thank you.

167
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,310
Go on. Go on. That's it!

168
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,517
Go on. That's it!

169
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,157
Look. Oh, watch out...

170
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,955
<i>It is the worst terrorist attack</i>
<i>ever experienced by the United States...</i>

171
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,319
Look, look.

172
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,713
Happy New Year!

173
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,431
Are you going to become a cowgirl too?
- Yes.

174
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,756
Daddy!

175
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,794
Put that down, Maybelle.
Give it to me, sweetie.

176
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,993
Don't cry.
Give it to me, sweetie.

177
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,395
Why is the birdie dead, Daddy?

178
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,078
Well, sweetie...
the birdie flew into the glass...

179
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,949
Birds don't know what glass is.

180
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,680
They think that
if they can see through it,

181
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,196
they can fly through it.
Not very clever of them, eh?

182
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,876
Where does the birdie go when it's dead?

183
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:59,069
We... We just have to throw it away now.
Eh, Maybelle?

184
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,553
We mustn't put it on the compost heap.
It's like a chicken,

185
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,119
it's got bones in it.

186
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,397
We'll throw it in the dustbin. Come on.

187
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,272
No, Daddy.

188
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,350
It's dirty, darling.
Give it to me, sweetie.

189
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,994
I'll throw it away for you, OK?

190
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,075
Do you want to throw it away?

191
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,839
Give it to me. Come on.

192
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,593
Come on. Give it to me.
Give it to me.

193
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,079
No!

194
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,833
Maybelle!

195
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,872
The chemo isn't working.

196
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,678
Her bone marrow is producing
abnormal white blood cells again.

197
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,111
Which isn't very good news, of course.

198
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,352
But, as we've already discussed,
we're not giving up yet.

199
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,670
We will simply move on to
the next stage in the treatment,

200
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,718
a stem cell transplant.

201
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,634
First, we will destroy
her own bone marrow

202
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,997
with more chemo and radiotherapy,

203
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,711
then we will replace it with
new stem cells from a donor.

204
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,599
A donor who is
as close to Maybelle as possible.

205
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,797
Unfortunately, parents can't
be considered as donors.

206
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,278
How did it go?

207
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,190
It was a difficult afternoon.
- How come?

208
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,998
Just after you'd gone

209
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,713
she was doing some drawing outside and
another bird flew into our terranda.

210
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:21,433
I came out and she was standing there
crying, with a dead bird in her hands.

211
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,877
That wouldn't happen with a veranda.
- It'd happen even more! Stupid birds!

212
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:34,195
You'd think that it would eventually
be written in their genes.

213
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,639
That it'd become a sort of instinct
passed on from mummy bird to chick,

214
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,272
that when they see a frame they realize
it's dangerous to try to fly through it.

215
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,559
But innumerable generations of birds
obviously need to

216
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,996
fly into that window
before it starts to get through to them.

217
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,195
Bye.
- Bye.

218
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,149
You should try explaining to a child

219
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,717
how come the bird isn't moving anymore.

220
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,754
It's difficult.
- I know.

221
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,789
You want to say people have come up with
all kinds of ways of dealing with it.

222
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,077
That some people believe
the bird has a soul

223
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,312
that doesn't die and goes up to heaven.

224
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,275
That it'll see it's mummy and daddy
again there and will fly around forever

225
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,274
in a place where the sun always shines
and there aren't any windows.

226
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,873
That other people believe
the bird is a martyr

227
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,270
in the fight against windows.

228
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,116
And after his death he'll be given lots
of female birds that have never mated

229
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,840
and he can do what he wants with them.

230
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,789
But Daddy doesn't believe in
any of that.

231
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,238
Daddy thinks that...

232
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,990
that everything just dies
and stays dead.

233
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,349
But...

234
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:11,715
But you can't say that.
- No, you can't say that, Didier.

235
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,117
Her natural resistance will be
destroyed completely first

236
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,633
and she'll be very weak.

237
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,793
Which is why we're putting her in
a sterile, pressurized room.

238
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,794
The new blood cells may attack her body.

239
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,999
That doesn't happen with
identical stem cells

240
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,438
but you only find those in the case of
identical twins or cloned embryos.

241
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,313
Unfortunately, science
hasn't got that far yet.

242
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,196
Her chances are very good.

243
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,716
She has a very good chance of
being completely cured.

244
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,713
Don't lose heart.

245
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,789
Thank you.

246
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,235
Daddy?
- Yes?

247
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,069
That birdie has become a star now.

248
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,233
OK, sweetie.

249
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,393
If you want to believe that
that birdie is a star now, then it is.

250
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,390
I'll tell you what, choose one.

251
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,872
That one.

252
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,309
That one?
That big shiny one up there?

253
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,670
That one? OK.

254
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,076
Bye-bye, birdie.
- Bye-bye, birdie.

255
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,355
I love you.
- I love you too.

256
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,073
Clever girl.

257
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,550
And that, that's blood.

258
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,554
The stem cells are In there.
Stem cells are little soldiers

259
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,271
who will march down that tube
into your blood.

260
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,313
And those little soldiers mean business.

261
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,315
Understand? Eh?

262
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,192
They are going to cure you.

263
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,829
Hey.
- Hello.

264
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,754
We're allowed to go home.
- Are you?

265
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,754
Milan's levels are perfect
- Great!

266
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,236
Congratulations.

267
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,351
Is it a plane? Is it a bird?

268
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,916
No, it's not.
- Maybelle...

269
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:37,313
It's Mega Mindu.
- It's too early. Get some more sleep.

270
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,752
You're far too lively for me.
- Is it a plane? Is It a bird?

271
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,117
No, it's not.
- How about getting some more sleep?

272
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,431
No, I'm 6, I was allowed to
wake you up early.

273
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,589
Oh yes, of course,
it's your birthday.

274
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,320
No, don't tickle me! Don't!

275
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,159
Don't, don't tickle me!
- Happy birthday!

276
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,312
6 years old! Happy birthday, sweetie.
- Happy birthday.

277
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,592
You look... You look lovely.

278
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,512
In your pink costume.

279
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,036
How about getting some more sleep?
- No.

280
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,349
Yes. Come on.

281
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,909
Right, have you almost finished?

282
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,798
Come on, sweetie.

283
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,191
Rinse your mouth.

284
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,796
That's it. Come on, put your shoes on.

285
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,270
Come on, sweetie, get a move on.

286
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,878
Now what? Get the other one. Come on.
- I'm tired, Mummy.

287
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,350
So am I, sweetie. We're all tired.

288
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,279
But we have to get a move on, eh?

289
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,396
Kiss.
- The bus is there. Come on.

290
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,350
Coat.
- You're bleeding round your teeth.

291
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,951
How often have I told you not to
scrub so hard with your toothbrush?

292
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,509
Rucksack.
- Right.

293
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,831
Let her go now.
- Alright.

294
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,753
Didier?
- Yes?

295
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,319
Just one.

296
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,679
I'll open the door in a minute.
- Yeah, yeah.

297
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,989
She's got more bruises on her arms.
- I know, I saw them.

298
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,035
Hi.

299
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,269
Hi.

300
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,359
Here.

301
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,350
Thanks.

302
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,190
Shall I light the stove?

303
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,070
No. No, it's OK.

304
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,870
Sweetheart...
Can we go and see my mum Sunday?

305
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,039
Yes... I think so.

306
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,199
It's... It's Mother's Day on Sunday.

307
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,838
She'll be pleased to see you.

308
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:18,069
Fuck! Fuck! You're going to
pull through, sweetheart. Goddammit!

309
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,228
Her heart has stopped.
Stop the ambulance.

310
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,590
What the fuck is happening now?

311
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,319
Adrenalin, OK?
- What's happening?

312
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,196
What's happening?
- We're losing her.

313
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,432
You're not losing her.
D'you hear me? You're not!

314
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,950
Don't let her go! D'you hear me?

315
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,839
Don't let her go.
- Move back and calm down, please.

316
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,158
We're going to shock her.
OK, shocking. Watch out.

317
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,034
Everyone stand clear.

318
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,236
Three, two, one.

319
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,674
Let's check. The monitor, please.
Thank you.

320
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,959
Take it easy, take it easy. Calm down.

321
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:21,275
Calm down, OK?
We'll just check.

322
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,915
She's back.
- OK, let's go.

323
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,633
Go go go.

324
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,793
Elise...

325
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,438
You need to do something, sweetheart.
Things can't go on like this.

326
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,077
Things... Things need to change.

327
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,037
You'd like things to be
like they used to be, eh?

328
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,555
Yes, of course.

329
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:33,192
Before we had Maybelle.
You never wanted the child, did you?

330
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,032
Elise, that...
That's not fair, sweetheart.

331
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,198
I should've listened to you.
You didn't want kids.

332
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,038
I did. You being pregnant just
took me by surprise, sweetheart.

333
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,078
I'd never given kids a thought.

334
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,789
But once she was there
I was the happiest man in the world.

335
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,555
So happy that you started drinking.

336
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,876
You just want to pick a fight.
- You were drunk when she was born.

337
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:11,273
And once she was there you had to head
for a bar with your pals to celebrate.

338
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,398
You were gone for ten days.
- You're exaggerating.

339
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,592
You only came home when you developed
jaundice from drinking.

340
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,594
That wasn't from drinking...
- It was from drinking.

341
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,675
And because of that
I had to stop breastfeeding.

342
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,311
I could only breastfeed her
for two weeks because you had jaundice

343
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,308
and it's full of antibodies that are
Important for a little mite like that.

344
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,071
You can talk. For the first three months
you were pregnant...

345
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,797
Go on, say it. Say it.
It's true. It's true.

346
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,909
I smoked and drank
during the first three months

347
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:54,916
but I didn't know I was pregnant.
- It's not your fault, sweetheart.

348
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,913
A baby is formed
during the first three months.

349
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,755
The brain is already fully formed
after 6 weeks.

350
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,718
Stop it, Elise! Stop it!
- I didn't know.

351
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,915
Stop!

352
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:12,553
People die for the stupidest of reasons.
Maybe this place was too dirty for her.

353
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,951
Maybe she ate something
she shouldn't have done

354
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,908
or we should've changed her sheets more.
- What are you saying?

355
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,674
Who changed her sheets?
- I didn't mean anything.

356
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,755
Who fed her? Cooked for her?
Fresh food, organic food, every day.

357
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,593
I did. And who cleaned the place? I did!

358
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,356
I just said the first things that came
into my head, I could've said anything.

359
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,152
You're blaming me, aren't you?

360
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,356
I'm not.
- You're blaming me.

361
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,393
You're blaming me.
- I'm not!

362
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,752
I can have a go at you too.
- What?

363
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,870
There isn't any cancer in my family,

364
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,350
but there is in yours.
Two uncles and your dad.

365
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,958
Fuck you, Elise!

366
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,271
Yeah... Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

367
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,716
Yeah, fuck you.
- Fuck you!

368
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,032
You were never for it. Never!
- What did you say?

369
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,671
Fuck you! You bitch!
You fucking bitch!

370
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,633
Sorry.

371
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,355
These are the coolest tattoos
I've ever seen.

372
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,994
Come in, I'll do you one.
- No, no.

373
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,550
Come in.
- It's not my kind of thing. Honestly.

374
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:58,032
What could possibly be worth putting
on your body and never be removed?

375
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,034
Don't you regret any of your tattoos?
- Of course I do.

376
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:07,320
But it's not a problem. If you no longer
like one, you put another one on top.

377
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,112
Really?
- Look.

378
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,149
The name of my first love, Billy,
used to be here

379
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:19,599
And here, Joey. Joey was a nice boy.

380
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,638
And here Tommy. See?
- Yes, yes.

381
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,268
You can still see him a bit.
Tommy, the surfer.

382
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,116
And then, Mathieu.
That's fairly recent.

383
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,392
Sorry, um...

384
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,034
I don't know
what's the matter with me today.

385
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,957
We were talking about something else.

386
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,236
We were talking about you.
- Me?

387
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,234
Oh yes, that there's nothing in
your life worth putting on your body.

388
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,710
There are loads of
worthwhile things in my life.

389
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,998
But putting them on my body...
- So tell me, what are they then?

390
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,591
I've been crazy about America
all my life.

391
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,275
America?
- Yes, America.

392
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,908
It's the best place on earth.

393
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,517
No matter where you're from, when you
get there you can start all over again.

394
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,557
It's a country of dreamers.

395
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,628
An eagle.
- Yeah, yeah.

396
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:32,157
You really do want to give me a tattoo.
- I need to earn a living.

397
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,753
Elvis.

398
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,319
What d'you mean, Elvis?
- A tattoo of Elvis.

399
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,159
Elvis is the greatest musician
of all time.

400
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,595
Elvis? Elvis Presley?

401
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,988
Yes.
- For goodness' sake!

402
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,759
That's fantastic.
That's one of the best songs ever.

403
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,434
But it isn't by Elvis.
It's by Hank Williams.

404
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,837
Hank... The cowboy?
- The cowboy, yes. Hank Williams.

405
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,993
Elvis is a pansy!
The greatest musician in the whole world

406
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,914
Is Bill Monroe.
- Who?

407
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,832
Bill Monroe.

408
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,192
Bill Monroe.
- Never heard of him.

409
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,193
The father of bluegrass music.

410
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,920
Bluegrass.
- Something to do with country music?

411
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,991
It's country music at its most pure.

412
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,870
A violin, an upright bass, a mandolin,
a guitar and a banjo.

413
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,270
Just strings, purely acoustic.

414
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,876
And voices.
It's absolutely sublime.

415
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:34,310
A very good bluegrass band is
performing near here Friday evening.

416
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,992
I will definitely be there.

417
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,428
My name's Didier, by the way.
- Elise.

418
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,348
You're right.

419
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,351
Things have to change.

420
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,758
Sweetheart...

421
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,113
Darling.

422
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,879
Come on.

423
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,838
Just a moment.
- No, no.

424
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,993
Let me through.
- Sir.

425
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,116
I need to stay with my wife.

426
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,078
Come on, sir.

427
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,428
What are you doing?

428
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,676
What's that?
- It's...

429
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:33,231
It's a sticker of a hawk.
A hawk sticker from the DIY store.

430
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,914
It's supposed to frighten the birds away

431
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,436
so that they no longer fly into
the glass in your terranda.

432
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,148
Cool, eh?

433
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,554
What?

434
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,394
Nothing.

435
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:56,233
You do realize that doesn't solve
anything for the birds in the long term?

436
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,231
Eh, sweetheart?

437
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,593
You're serious, aren't you?
- Of course I am.

438
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,799
How are the birds ever going
to learn what glass is?

439
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,317
Now they're scared of the hawk but
that's cheating, it's an illusion.

440
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,991
Why do you always have to...
- It isn't a hawk, it's a sticker.

441
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:21,314
There's glass here.
- This is a solution, OK?

442
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,835
There's a solution for every problem.

443
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,792
Hey, guys.
- Look who it is. Hi.

444
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,399
Back home.

445
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,349
You look lovely in your underpants.
- He does, eh?

446
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,870
Who was the beer for?
- There was one for me.

447
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,439
Did you have a ticket?
- Yes.

448
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,712
Me too, I ordered one.
- No way.

449
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,236
You only had three tickets.
- Last week I...

450
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,198
Last week what?
- I bought everyone loads of drinks...

451
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,270
For months we were
surrounded by stem cells

452
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:15,673
and we had the feeling that
medical science wasn't going far enough.

453
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,149
That the brakes had been applied.

454
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,949
It's a feeling you can't explain
and your child dies...

455
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,032
And then you hear that
bastards like that

456
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,953
have been slowing
everything down for years.

457
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,351
For religious reasons.

458
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,678
Didier...

459
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,838
That's America.

460
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:45,514
It is allowed here, it's just that
they haven't got that far yet.

461
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,559
Because those bastards have been
slowing everything down for years.

462
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,396
But what gives them
the right to do that? Eh?

463
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,517
They call themselves pro-life.

464
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,069
Technology for killing people
knows no bounds,

465
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,913
but technology for curing people
is a different story.

466
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,789
Because embryos are grown
outside of marriage.

467
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,428
Embryos the size of a pinhead.

468
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,676
The hypocritical bastard!

469
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,875
Pro-life? My arse, arsehole!

470
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,875
Bunch of extremist fundamentalists!
Stick your cross up your arse!

471
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,793
Next to your brain. Goddammit!

472
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,392
Didier...

473
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,110
Don't.
- Bloody hell, Elise.

474
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,840
The whole world is
obsessed with religion.

475
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,958
The whole world has gone crazy!
And so have you.

476
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,590
D'you think I don't know?
That I'm stupid? Do you?

477
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,513
D'you think I don't know
why that sticker is there?

478
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,194
Because you believe
Maybelle may come back to see you

479
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,318
and fly into that glass?

480
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,152
Is that it?

481
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,839
Sweetheart...

482
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,238
Stop a moment. Stop a moment.

483
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,188
Stop a moment. Stop. Just a moment.

484
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,431
I want to ask you something.

485
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,915
If Johnny's allowed to do it, so am I.

486
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,508
Elise, will you marry me?
- No.

487
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,669
Please.

488
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,071
Help me, ladies and gentlemen. Elise!
- No!

489
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,591
Pass me a pln.

490
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,150
Just stick it in.
- That's what I'm doing.

491
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,393
Do you?

492
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,714
I'll just be a moment.

493
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,670
Hi.
- Hi.

494
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,275
How's things?
- OK.

495
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,753
Are you sleeping here now?

496
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,554
Yes, for now.
I've got a mattress upstairs.

497
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,960
It's only temporary, eh, sweetheart?

498
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,076
Elise, I...

499
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,273
What would I do without you, Elise?

500
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,351
It's not Elise anymore.

501
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,956
I've changed my name.

502
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,550
I'm called Alabama now.

503
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,953
What?

504
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,951
Alabama.

505
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,552
Alabama?

506
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,875
Yes. I've changed mv name, like
the Indians do when they feel like it.

507
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:37,635
When they feel they've taken
another step in their life.

508
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,519
Come on, Elise, don't be so silly.

509
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,832
Just call me Alabama. OK?

510
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,831
Will I see you Saturday?

511
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,393
Are we still performing together?
Or is that over too?

512
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,913
Well? Will you be there?

513
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,998
Yes.

514
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,072
Why does she always call me?

515
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,912
You were too nice to her.

516
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,952
Hello, Elise.
- Hello.

517
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,269
Everything OK?
- Sure.

518
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:54,309
So he's still allowed to say Elise?
Or haven't you told them yet?

519
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,429
No.
- No? She's not called Elise anymore.

520
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:05,272
She's officially changed her name.
She's now called Alabama.

521
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,556
Really?
- Is that true?

522
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,631
On your passport and everything?
- Yes.

523
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:15,432
So we have to call you Alabama now?
Seriously?

524
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,189
Hello, Alabama.
- Alabama.

525
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:25,551
Hey, Alabama...
May I ask you something?

526
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,232
Who am I?

527
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,793
If you're Alabama, who am I?

528
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,834
Monroe.

529
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:54,433
Oh, Bill Monroe.
- No, Marilyn Monroe.

530
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,631
I want a cool bluegrass name too.

531
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,189
Go on, give him a name...
I know, Linda.

532
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,193
Simple. You're Linda.
- Come on, guys.

533
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,954
What?
- You're never happy, are you?

534
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,910
Do you know...

535
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,394
Do you know who I feel sorry for?

536
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:46,754
The scientists who, since Darwin,
have spent their time studying biology.

537
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:53,236
Who have tried to explain this wonderful
world, to describe it and study it.

538
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:58,428
Who've spent their whole life doing it
in the most difficult conditions.

539
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:03,236
And who now hear that
there are still spastics

540
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,960
who question the theory of evolution.

541
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,439
Because it was Yahweh.

542
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:11,394
Yahweh created everything
and he did it in six days.

543
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,955
And not in 4.5 billion years.

544
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:17,635
It's enough to make you puke.
Bunch of imbeciles!

545
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:23,429
But let me tell you something.
Yahweh,

546
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:28,589
the God from the Old Testament, the God
that 80% of the world kneels before,

547
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,878
is by far the most evil person
in literature.

548
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,749
Check out your Bible.
Read it carefully.

549
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:42,711
Yahweh is a manipulator, a sadist,
a killer, a racist,

550
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,668
a misogynist, a homophobe,
who is narrow-minded and vain,

551
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,876
who carries out ethnic cleansing,

552
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:54,034
who demands child sacrifices and plays
sadistic games to test people's faith.

553
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:58,557
A dictator who apparently created
heaven and earth and mankind on purpose

554
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:02,190
so we'd fall humbly
to our knees before Him

555
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:05,989
and deferentially sing His praise.

556
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,628
Well, I wasn't created in that image.

557
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,635
I'm not taking orders from
a God like that. I'm better than that.

558
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,713
I'm...

559
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,312
I'm a monkey.

560
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,359
And I'm scared.

561
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:27,917
I know I have to be nice to my fellow
man or I'll get a punch in the kisser.

562
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,071
I don't need a God for that.

563
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,676
We created gods
because we were scared.

564
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,075
Out of fear, out of ignorance.

565
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:41,792
If someone were to say today that
lightning is God expressing his anger,

566
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:46,829
what would you say?
You'd laugh in their face.

567
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,551
One more God to go.
One more God to go.

568
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,671
One more God to go.

569
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:20,995
My daughter, Maybelle...
My little daughter died

570
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:25,950
because certain experiments are regarded
as unethical by the religious community.

571
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,190
But that's a mere detail.

572
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,430
Millions of people die every year

573
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:34,758
cos the scumbag they call the Pope says
you can't use a condom when having sex.

574
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,912
It's only a mere detail,
historically speaking,

575
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,311
but not to me.
Not to me.

576
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,399
Elise.
- Alabama.

577
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,270
Alabama.
- Yes?

578
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:09,359
If I want to believe that
Maybelle is a star up in the sky,

579
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,152
I will.

580
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:16,392
If I want to believe she's a bird
that perches on our window sill,

581
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,670
or a butterfly that sits on my shoulder

582
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,277
or a bloody frog that...
- Maybelle is dead, sweetheart.

583
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,671
She's dead, she's gone!
She's not here anymore.

584
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,956
But we are still here.
I'm still here.

585
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:33,352
We have to carry on together.
- I've covered up your name, Didier.

586
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,798
You're a coward.
You're nothing but a coward.

587
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,916
A coward!

588
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,635
Maybelle wouldn't have wanted that.
Why did you do it? Why?

589
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,792
I knew.

590
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,317
In fact, I've always known.

591
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,831
That it was too wonderful to be true.

592
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,233
That it couldn't last. That life
isn't like that, life isn't generous.

593
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:20,511
You mustn't love someone,
you mustn't become attached to someone,

594
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,033
life begrudges you that.

595
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:27,991
It takes everything away from you and
laughs in your face. It betrays you.

596
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:32,915
Sweetheart, don't...
- Don't call me that, Didier.

597
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,799
I'm not your sweetheart anymore!

598
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,439
It's over!

599
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,673
Are you alright, pal?

600
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,359
No... but...

601
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,229
Thanks.

602
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,035
What are we going to do?
- Play.

603
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,439
Where's Elise?

604
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:23,515
Daddy, can you tell me
about the stars again?

605
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,359
What about them?

606
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,110
About how they've gone out.

607
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,193
Gone out?

608
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,108
You told me before.

609
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:48,349
Right. A little star like this one is,
in fact a?

610
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,791
A sun.
- A sun. Yes, well done, Maybelle.

611
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:59,397
It's a sun that is
a very, very long way away.

612
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:05,357
And its light has to travel
a long way for a long time

613
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,279
to reach your eyes.

614
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:16,518
So sometimes it's possible that
the little star has already gone out

615
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:21,231
before the light reaches your eyes.

616
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:28,069
So you see something
that is no longer there.

617
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,511
But that doesn't matter, because
the light from a little star like that

618
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,150
carries on travelling, past your eyes.

619
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,436
Further and further.

620
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:42,757
So that little star will exist forever.

621
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,992
Forever and ever and ever.

622
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,918
Elise!

623
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:23,908
Goddammit!

624
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,394
Madam.

625
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,068
Madam.
Can you hear me?

626
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,671
OK, intubate, intubate.

627
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,755
Elise!

628
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,589
Move back, please. OK.

629
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:48,600
OK. Adrenalin.
Adrenalin, please.

630
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,959
No way.
Don't let her go.

631
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:55,351
I'm not letting you go, sweetheart.

632
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,793
Don't let her go.

633
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:09,078
The circle is broken.
You won't see Maybelle again.

634
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,833
Stand back, please.

635
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,320
Three, two, one.

636
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,555
Elise!

637
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,990
We've done all the tests.

638
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,954
She's got serious brain damage.

639
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:11,272
We are keeping her alive for now.
But she is clinically dead.

640
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:18,358
The medical team's advice is
to let her go.

641
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,033
I'm sorry.

642
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:28,997
Can I see her?
I want to see her.

643
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:25,039
Goodbye, sweetheart.

644
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,315
Will you...

645
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,714
Will you say hello to Maybelle for me
if you see her?

646
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,792
