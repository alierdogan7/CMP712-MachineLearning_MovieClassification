189
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,014
Lifting me in his arms.

190
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,790
I thought it a dream at first.

191
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:58,594
There was a place,

192
00:11:58,662 --> 00:12:03,132
removed from the grounds of his villa,

193
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,503
where wagons were crafted and repaired.

194
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:14,911
He applied his many tools inside me.

195
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:17,147
[ screaming ]

196
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,617
Before turning them to outward flesh.

197
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,958
I wish I had power to seize memory,

198
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:34,663
and with hands strip it from life.

199
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:37,667
It is not the one that shadows mind.

200
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:41,438
What I saw in morning light,

201
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:43,573
forever darkens thought.

202
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:46,376
The man himself,

203
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:52,449
greeting his wife with
kiss and warm smile.

204
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:57,488
His daughters laughing upon his knee.

205
00:12:57,555 --> 00:13:01,692
The beast from
the previous night transformed,

206
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:08,265
into a man who held no threat.

207
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,402
I have no words.

208
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,140
You do not need them.

209
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,275
Knowing, you are at my side

210
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,144
gives comfort enough.

211
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:23,112
I will always stand so.

212
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,426
All the fucking stalls
bear same misfortune.

213
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:38,394
And of the remainder?

214
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:39,662
How long will it see us fed?

215
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,863
Two weeks.

216
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:41,964
Perhaps more, if we're cautious

217
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:43,866
and our numbers do not swell.

218
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:46,769
Fuck the gods.

219
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:48,737
Spartacus.

220
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:50,239
Ships weigh anchor off our coast.

221
00:13:57,348 --> 00:14:00,751
It seems we have drawn notice.

222
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,686
Sanus.

223
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,188
What do your eyes fall upon?

224
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,624
Four men approach.
Armed.

225
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,893
One with cask perched atop shoulder.

226
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,927
Romans?

227
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:12,496
Not fucking likely, by appearance.

228
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,400
Raise the gate.

229
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:32,516
What shit is this?

230
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,584
Brigands of Cilicia.

231
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:36,119
Pirates?

232
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:39,722
I would speak with the man

233
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,591
that has claimed this city.

234
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:47,629
Your words fall upon his ear.

235
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,168
What business do you break?

236
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:54,937
You are Spartacus?

237
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:57,540
I stand so named.

238
00:14:57,607 --> 00:14:58,741
The same fiend that brought down

239
00:14:58,808 --> 00:15:00,643
the arena in Capua?

240
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,879
Defeated Glaber at Vesuvius?

241
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:06,515
Wrought untold suffering

242
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,051
upon the Republic and its people.

243
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,887
All deeds claimed with pride.

244
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,497
Then I call you fucking brother!

245
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:30,606
Let us share gift of wine,

246
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:33,709
and break words towards common enemy!

247
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:52,528
Gaius!

248
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:54,363
It has been too many years.

249
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,199
They have been
unkind to you, old friend.

250
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,266
[ laughing ]

251
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:00,103
At least I do not
stand woolly fucking goat!

252
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,538
Crassus denies me sharpened blade.

253
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:04,173
Under what purpose?

254
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,175
A personal matter,

255
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:08,911
concerning only those
within his confidence.

256
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:11,981
Regrettably none stand so here.

257
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,083
You have received message

258
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,585
in advance of our arrival, Mummius?

259
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:18,255
We stand ready to march
upon your command.

260
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:21,192
<i>Have use of my tent until such a time.</i>

261
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:22,293
Come!

262
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:24,595
I would leave these boys
to their plotting

263
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:27,698
and hear of your
adventures with Antonius.

264
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:31,636
Impudent shit.

265
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:33,071
He brushes you aside in favor

266
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:35,807
of swallowing Caesar's cock.

267
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:37,975
Let us pray he chokes upon it.

268
00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:41,412
Adherbal!

269
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,314
Break open cask so we may share drink.

270
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:44,916
I would break words in advance.

271
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,885
While mind is yet unclouded.

272
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,887
Heracleo is your guest,

273
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,655
and I am at your will.

274
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:52,690
It is an honor for me
to be across from the man

275
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,926
who steals an entire fucking city!

276
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,329
It was the fucking Romans
who stole freedom from us.

277
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,631
We merely seize what is owed.

278
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,299
I favor turn of your reason,

279
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,101
brothers.

280
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:07,071
Some Romans yet live within Sinuessa?

281
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,105
A few.

282
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:09,640
The Aedile among them?

283
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:16,080
He does not.

284
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,081
You are sure of this?

285
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,849
His villa now stands ours.

286
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,385
His claim to it severed by my own hand.

287
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,120
Then I too have been injured.

288
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:27,825
This man speaks in fucking riddles.

289
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:29,026
<i>Hmm.</i>

290
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:33,265
Straighten tongue,

291
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:37,103
or fall from presence.

292
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,540
The Aedile and I had an arrangement.

293
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,542
He brokered such with men
of your calling?

294
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,614
Openly, no.

295
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:50,583
Yet many things are
born of dark corners.

296
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:52,118
The seas are fraught with dangers...

297
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,086
especially for those who,

298
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:57,823
consider themselves his competitor.

299
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,992
In return for your "services"?

300
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,764
Knowledge of time and route
of unfortunate vessels.

301
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:07,700
All goods aboard, added to my own,

302
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:10,636
with the seal of the Aedile

303
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:12,872
pressed upon new manifest.

304
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:16,375
What cause does thief upon wave

305
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,243
<i>need of parchment and seal?</i>

306
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:22,814
<i>The official seal removes</i>
<i>unwanted attention when</i>

307
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:26,384
trading acquisitions in respected ports.

308
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:29,488
Advantage snatched from hand,

309
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:32,825
by fucking action of your own.

310
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:34,761
<i>To shit with this grinning cunt.</i>

311
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:35,796
Agron.

312
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:37,998
What threat does he hold?

313
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:40,166
Pissing on us from the sea?

314
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:41,167
You would be surprised

315
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:43,503
by the reach of my stream, boy.

316
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:46,573
Let's us take breath then,

317
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,309
remove ourselves from heated words.

318
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,811
There is yet drink to be had.

319
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:54,547
Return when sun gives way to moon.

320
00:18:54,615 --> 00:18:58,485
And discover if there
stands cause to share cup.

321
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:02,489
As you command, King Spartacus.

322
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:03,824
As you command.

323
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,067
The man swings cock
to rival Jupiter himself.

324
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:17,771
Close gate upon ass,
and be done with him.

325
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:20,607
He may yet be of use.

326
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,509
Find Aedile's seal,

327
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,045
and let us weigh advantage it brings.

328
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,713
<i>Cilicians!</i>

329
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,283
Shit rises to fill mouth.

330
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,119
Have you laid eyes upon it or not?

331
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:35,823
I forge steel,
not trade at fucking ports.

332
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,125
What need would I have of Aedile's seal?

333
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:39,927
Words I would have greeted sooner.

334
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:41,962
Is that what it was like,

335
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,030
before you gained your freedom?

336
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:46,800
Were you made to fight
as an animal would,

337
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:49,169
as you made poor Ulpianus?

338
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:50,637
I prompted no contest.

339
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,505
Yet you did not stop it.

340
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:54,574
What fate did you believe

341
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:56,509
when deciding to aid in taking the city?

342
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:58,178
I held no fucking choice.

343
00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:00,914
Every man holds such at time's end.

344
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,884
You hold no love
for these people, Attius.

345
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,186
Do not now raise vaunted concerns now.

346
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:07,754
"These people."

347
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:10,057
Am I not Roman, as they were?

348
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,328
As some yet are?

349
00:20:14,395 --> 00:20:16,930
You stand for yourself alone.

350
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:20,534
As I once stood.

351
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,236
You are proof then.

352
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,305
That basest clay

353
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:27,408
may yet be molded into
something of worth.

354
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,447
Turn from past,

355
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,716
set eye toward new horizon,

356
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:37,118
far from this place
and the man that you were.

357
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:57,671
Praise fucking gods,
I've found men of worth.

358
00:20:57,738 --> 00:21:00,106
What crude form do you deposit at feet?

359
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:01,508
Sinuessa.

360
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:04,911
Spartacus has taken Sinuessa en Valle.

361
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:07,147
Summon Mummius.

362
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:08,281
Wine.

363
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,086
Gratitude.

364
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:15,488
Repay favor with gift of words.

365
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:17,124
I have few of note.

366
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:19,193
We thought the gate secure.

367
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,462
Yet Spartacus is of the underworld,

368
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,965
able to spirit himself
through wood and stone.

369
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,466
He is but a man.

370
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,836
I've laid eyes upon him.

371
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,237
Bathed in blood and gore.

372
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:31,406
The city trembling in his wake.

373
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,308

00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:52,103
how such small a weight
bears such heavy burden.
