You're talking about kids.

55
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,841
Of course I am.

56
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,640
- OK.
- "OK", you want kids?

57
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,676
I love kids.

Come with me.
Just get right to the back.

00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,332
- Straight back to the kitchen.
- I'm sorry.

73
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,960
- Goddamn sausages at Pinwheels.
- Yeah?

So, er...
we're in a bit of a bind here, Henry.

our first baseman.

But as you can see,
he's not exactly game-ready.

- Nothing.
- You can't be thinking nothing.

Let me guess. You're thinking,
"How in hell did I get here?"

I don't know.

We committed crimes, Henry.

135

But we committed to the wrong thing.

136
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,419
See, that was a mistake.
We never fulfilled our potential.

137

See this guy here in the middle?

138
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,674
Don't stare at him.

And he could have been a good one.

Well, good or bad, I don't know.

142
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,185
But he chose not to fulfill
his potential. Now look at him.

comes and says,

183
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,880
"OK, Max, what are you going to do
for us this time if we let you out?"

184

I get the old twitch working,

185
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,258

186

187
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,386
"I'm going to break into your house

- Yeah, so?
- So you can get out of here.

354
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,774
- it's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

355
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,564
- it's not.
- It is.

356
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,700
No, it is not.
This is my home, buddy.

357
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,862
This is not a home, Max.
it's a prison.

358
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,905
Call it what you like. I'm happy here.

359
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,449
Max.

360
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,168
You can't die in this place.

361
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,295
I can die
pretty much wherever I want.

362
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,207
I'm asking for your help.

363
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,092
I need your help.

364
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,552
- I got cards, kid.
- Max.

365
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,809
Come on. Look, I've thought about...

366
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,856
# I got a thing on my mind

367
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,692
# Sure enough gonna find it

368
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,327
# I got a thing on my mind

369
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,407
# Sure enough gonna find it

370
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,252
# Don't let nobody tell me

371
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,039
# My thing, it won't come true

372
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,126
# Cos I ain't lying down

373
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,129
# Till I get my dues

374
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,716
# I got a thing on my mind

375
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,473
# I'm sure enough gonna find it... #

376
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,069
God knows, I love my country.
I love it deeply.

377
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,701
I couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much.

378
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,081
(LAUGHS) But I must drink my coffee.

379
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,040
Firs, coffee. Firs?

380
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,705
Where's Firs?

381
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,919
I'm sorry, Firs is sick today.

382
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,708
- What?
- He's... He's sick.

383
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,128
He's sick. You know it. Continue.

384
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,638
Fine, I'll pretend Firs is here.

385
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,766
Thank you, Firs, you dear old man.

386
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,599
I'm so glad to find you still alive.

387
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,731
I said I'm so glad
to find you still alive.

388
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,562
He's a little deaf.

389
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,185
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich

390
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,947
says that I'm an upstart,
a money-grubber.

391
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:56,403
He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care. A bit.

392
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,329
I just want you to believe in me.
Like in the old days.

393
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,587
I just want your wonderful tender
eyes to look on me like they used to.

394
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:11,376
(RUSSIAN ACCENT) No, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop. It just is bloody.

395
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,010
No! Simone.

396
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,675
It's too small. it's too safe.

397
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,435
- Stop showing me that safe face.
- Good, I won't.

398
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,473
No, I'm not talking about you.
You're doing the best you can.

399
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,266
I'm talking to you.

400
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,309
- What are you doing?
- Me?

401
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,898
Yes.

402
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,322
Well, l... I'm listening.

403
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,611
Listening?
Well, it looks like you're...

404
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,781
"hearing, and to hear is to be weak.

405
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,791
To listen is to be strong.

406
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,045
Why? Because to listen is an action.

407
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,043
No. What... What is that?

408
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,007
It's an action. I'm listening.

409
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,930
I mean, is that what you want?
Is that what you mean?

410
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:06,017
- No, Djula.
- Mm-hm. GK.

411
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,181
Then what do you want?

412
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,771
You're performing, you're performing.

413
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:15,314
Nothing comes out.
You're just performing. Performing.

414
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,982
Well, that's what I do, Derek.

415
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,526
I'm an actress.

416
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,696
You can call yourself
whatever you want,

417
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,583
but so far
you haven't shown me anything real.

418
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,118
You see, here on stage,

419
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:32,040
every moment, every word,
every breath should be a risk.

420
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,381
Where is your risk, Djula?

421
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,216
I don't know, Darek. In your ass?

422
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:43,426
Good! Finally she's listening! Hah!

423
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,515
From the top, everybody.

424
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,054
I'm going to grab some coffee.

425
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,315
Well, you do that, Djula.
Go and grab a coffee.

426
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:55,731
Let's all have coffee and think about
what we're willing to risk in life.

427
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:59,116
What are you doing here?
You here to sue me?

428
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,322
- No.
- Good.

429
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,283
(DAREK) 20 minutes. I don't care.

430
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,823
- Is it always like that?
- What?

431
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,616
- That.
- In rehearsal?

432
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,036
- Yeah.
- it's a process.

433
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,585
Looks complicated.

434
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,170
Yeah, it is.

435
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,389
- Madame Julie.
- Coffee, Pierre.

436
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,677
("JE VEUX VIVRE" FROM
GOUNOD'S "ROMEO ET JULIETTE")

437
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,524
You want one?

438
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,355
- Sure.
- Deux.

439
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,145
- Deux Cafés.
- Oui.

440
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,988
Thanks.

441
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,526
(SIGHS)

442
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,365
You looked like you were listening.

443
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,782
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

444
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,370
Really?

445
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,160
In a way.

446
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,499
Yeah. Yeah, I wasn't.

447
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,835
I wasn't. I was playing it safe.

448
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,596
You know, "The Cherry Orchard"
was Chekhov's last play.

449
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,931
He was dying when he wrote it.

450
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,892
It's kind of perfect.

451
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,149
- Why?
- Because it's my last play, too.

452
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,275
Here in Buffalo.

453
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,359
I'm leaving. Right after this.

454
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,071
So who are you?

455
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,114
You mean my name?

456
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,409
OK.

457
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,953
I'm Henry.

458
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,797
Well, I wanna thank you
for not suing me, Henry.

459
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,380
Au revoir, Madame Julie.

460
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,011
Ciao, ciao.

461
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,475
Mr Saltzman, please tell the Board

462
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,769
why you believe
we should grant you a parole.

463
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,946
Come on, Mr Saltzman.

464
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,952
What have you got for us this time?

465
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,329
Mr Saltzman?

466
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,420
Come on, Max.

467
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,555
(DOOR BUZZER)

468
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,178
See you, George.

469
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,311
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah.

470
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,144
Um...

471
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,983
..where is your car?

472
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,944
I don't have a car.

473
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,528
You don't have a car?

474
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,193
I sold it.

475
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,112
Well, what is the matter with you?

476
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,576
You come to pick me up
and you don't have a car.

477
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,787
That is not the way
you pick up a person!

478
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,420
Yes, it is. I'm here.
I'm picking you up.

479
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,498
Look, I really don't know about this.

480
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,963
I think I'm making
a pretty big mistake.

481
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,720
Look, Max,
the bus station's just a short walk.

482
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,301
Bus station?

483
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,387
Don't worry, Max.

484
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,177
Carl? Hey, Dave!

485
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,765
Let me in, will you? Open up!

486
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,896
Max, it's gonna be OK.

487
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,109
Are you kidding me?
This is your plan?

488
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,825
An old cartoon in a pissoir?

489
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,786
- it's a start.
- No, this is 80 years ago.

490
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:40,121
Wait. I tell you what we do.
We do it the old-fashioned way.

491
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,039
- We go in with guns.
- No guns.

492
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,253
- Why?
- Someone could get hurt.

493
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,552
That's very sweet of you, Henry.

494
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,888
Maybe the tunnel's still there, Max.

495
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,640
Yes, I'm sure it is, right (!)

496
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,927
- Maybe it is.
- Maybe it is.

497
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,848
But maybe it's not.
I tell you what we do.

498
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:02,814
First we go to this bank of yours
and see if that's there.

499
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,353
It is.

500
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,648
I'm sure it is. But maybe it's not.

501
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,503
Now, which kind of account
would you like to open?

502
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,414
Well, which kind have you got?

503
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,959
Er... savings, interest-only,
commercial...

504
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,752
Excuse me for interrupting.

505
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,341
I was just thinking,
it's such a small world.

506
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:37,011
My uncle... My uncle, he put all his
money in your vault when I was a kid.

507
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,475
I mean, after we came from Europe.

508
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,061
Before the War.

509
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,227
The brownshirts and...

510
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,566
Well, what was my point, anyway?

511
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,947
I... Yes, and I remember him,
my uncle, telling me

512
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,783
that your vault
would probably be here for 300 years.

513
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,666
- Well, we hope he's right.
- The man was never wrong.

514
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,078
Er...
how long has that vault been here?

515
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,497
Er... since 1891.

516
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:10,215
Wow. And I'm just assuming
it's in the same spot.

517
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,345
Oh, yeah, yeah. Exact same spot.

518
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,882
History, son. it's all about history.

519
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,471
As I was saying,
we have savings, interest-only...

520
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:21,639
Again, pardon me,
but you'll have to just give us

521
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:25,059
a little time to decide
which of those we prefer.

522
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,603
But I want to thank you so very much.

523
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,239
- Oh, well, no, thank you.
- No, thank you for being so kind.

524
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,073
OK, we'll get in touch with you.

525
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,832
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

526
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,919
The vault is somewhere in here.

527
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,713
The tunnel runs somewhere under here

528
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,678
and ends up somewhere in there.

529
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,308
It's virtually robbing itself,
isn't it?

530
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,936
Goddamn Chekhov shit!

531
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,602
Jesus. Henry?

532
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,645
Hi.

533
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,656
Julie, Max. Max, Julie.

534
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,442
How do you do?

535
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,827
- What are you doing here?
- Er...

536
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:22,742
I was er... I was just showing Henry
the place where I used to perform.

537
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,625
Oh. What?

538
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,833
- That's lunch, Julie.
- Oh. Thank God.

539
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,124
Yes,
Chekhov can be extremely difficult.

540
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,463
It sometimes takes
a cast-iron stomach.

541
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,253
- Why, you know Chekhov?
- Of course.

542
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,175
Next to Gorbachev,
he's my favourite Russian.

543
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,971
Excuse me, would you mind terribly
if I er... took a look inside?

544
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,981
It's been maybe 30 years
since I've been in there.

545
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,687
- Really?
- Yes.

546
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,187
Well, er... yeah, sure.

547
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,105
Very kind of you.

548
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,155
How are you doing?

549
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,070
Great (!) I'm in hell.

550
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,458
Home again.

551
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,710
- What shows did you do?
- Ma'am?

552
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,471
What productions were you in?

553
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,723
Ah.

554
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,850
Er... some of the greats.

555
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,137
Er... Shakespeare, of course.

556
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,308
Er... Ibsen, er... Yeats, Williams.

557
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,148
Yeats. Yeats?
What play did Yeats write?

558
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,564
No, it was about Yeats,
when he was a young man.

559
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,452
Julie. Excuse me. Julie,
Mary wants to fit your wig at four

560
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,489
and Darek says to stay hungry.

561
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,534
- Fuck him.
- Got it.

562
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,043
Um...
can I be a bit of a nuisance, please?

563
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:52,251
I'd very much appreciate
a small tour around the old place,

564
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,790
if you wouldn't mind.

565
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,085
He used to perform here.

566
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:59,505
- I suppose it's OK. We're on a break.
- Oh, thank you.

567
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,469
- Henry?
- Sure. Go ahead.

568
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,474
Julie, thanks so much.

569
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,098
Is that your dad?

570
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,486
- No, he's a friend.
- Really? Cos he seems like your dad.

571
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,949
It's peaceful out here.

572
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,706
Ah, the inner Sanctum.
Like it was yesterday.

573
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,246
Down here.

574
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,460
People often make the mistake
of going down

575
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:40,300
but in Chekhov,
you must always, always go up.

576
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,007
- Bring back some memories?
- Oh, indeed.

577
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,477
Let me tell you something.

578
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:53,563
Did you know that there used to be
a Speakeasy here during Prohibition?

579
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,729
And they hid the booze in the bank.

580
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,317
Exactly.

581
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,982
Did you know there was a tunnel?
There was a tunnel.

582
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:06,701
I know that. I know that.
As a matter of fact, that tunnel...

583
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,616
That tunnel was um...

584
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,876
I know where it is.

585
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,628
- I'll show it to you.
- Really?

586
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,629
- Mm-hm.
- Um...

587
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,587
You did some acting yourself,
didn't you?

588
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,673
I could tell.

589
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,258
"The Cherry Orchard".

590
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,594
So what's it about?

591
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:31,059
A woman returns to her family estate
in the Russian countryside

592
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:36,818
and she realises that she has
to sell her beloved cherry orchard,

593
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,729
which is
the magical place of her youth.

594
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,524
It's the only place
she's ever felt safe.

595
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,577
And it's about um...

596
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,073
being forced to let go of the past

597
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:56,205
and create a new life
in order to survive.

598
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,252
We're going to have to be quick

599
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,716
because Arnold hates
people in his dressing room.

600
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,597
- Arnold?
- Oh, Lopakhin.

601
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,133
Of course.

602
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,972
Hello?

603
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,148
And I think it was right here.

604
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,560
Yeah.

605
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,483
Huh. Amazing.

606
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,398
(TAPS ON HOLLOW WALL)

607
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,532
Oh, boy. Lots of whisky.

608
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,490
Filled with ladies and gentlemen.

609
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,494
The good old days. Can you imagine?

610
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,160
- (TAPS THE WALL)
- I think they sealed it up in 1931

611
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,203
when they built the theatre.

612
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,872
Yeah, times have changed.

613
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:44,670
Well, all good things
must come to an end, unfortunately.

614
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,760
So what's your story, Henry?

615
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,641
- My story?
- Like, what do you do?

616
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,347
I'm figuring that out.

617
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,888
Does that mean you don't have a job?

618
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,399
I er...

619
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,105
..just got out of prison.

620
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,691
- Prison?
- It sounds worse than it is.

621
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,824
Really? Cos prison sounds bad.

622
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:09,236
Why were you there?
Are you a murderer or something?

623
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,406
No. Do I look like one?

624
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,075
- No.
- What do I look like?

625
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,996
Oh, this place is
just full of treasures.

626
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,756
Thank you so much.
It was great. Thank you.

627
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,217
- And thank you, Simon.
- My pleasure.

628
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,720
- And I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

629
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,927
Max has offered
to volunteer at the theatre.

630
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,682
Oh.

631
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,218
Work.

632
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:37,514
Work. it's time to work,
you lazy Americans.

633
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,057
(TAPS ON STAGE)

634
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,646
Even you, Djula. Top of act two.

635
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,911
What are you doing afterwards?

636
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,538
- Why?
- You like Chinese?

637
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,698
- Yeah.
- Jinlan?

638
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,084
- Yeah, it's OK.
- Eight o'clock?

639
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,210
Sure.

640
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,417
- Great.
- Great.

641
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,675
Djula, can we please start?

642
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,844
Stay out of prison.

643
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,381
- Djula, please.
- Yes, yes!

644
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,265
- Can we start?
- I'm here!

645
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,802
Good. You're coming in stage right.

646
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,055
I can see it all, Henry.

647
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,644
The bank,

648
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,519
the vault, the theatre, the tunnel.

649
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,315
See,
we got all the pieces of the puzzle

650
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,279
sitting right there on the table.

651
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,820
Now all we gotta do
is put 'em in the right order.

652
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,081
The only thing is the dirt.

653
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,790
Where does the dirt
from the tunnel go?

654
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,545
What about the vault?

655
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:47,083
- I'm thinking dirt right now, Henry.
- OK.

656
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,465
(EXHALES)

657
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,548
How do I look?

658
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,594
- Huh?
- How do I look?

659
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,762
You look like Henry.

660
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,315
You gonna be all right?

661
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,902
Yeah, we had a great day, kid.
Have yourself a nice dinner.

662
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,478
Julie.

663
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,646
Sorry I'm late.

664
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,649
That guy's a total dick.

665
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,188
Hi, Henry.

666
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,073
Hi. So how was the rehearsal?

667
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,829
I feel like duck.

668
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,668
Yeah, I think I'm good.
The reviews are mostly good.

669
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:10,709
But the problem is I don't just
wanna be good. I wanna be great.

670
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,549
And I don't just
wanna be great in Buffalo.

671
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,798
Where, then?

672
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,384
Don't laugh.

673
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,768
Hollywood.

674
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,977
I guess that's where people go.

675
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,023
Yeah.

676
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:39,238
You know, I just don't want my legacy
to be a Buffalotto commercial.

677
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,030
You know what? it's not going to be.

678
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,666
Because the moment
this thing is done, I'm out of here.

679
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,954
I'm just... I've gotta get out
before it's too late.

680
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,586
Sounds like a plan.

681
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,376
Yeah.

682
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,265
I hate fortune cookies.

683
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,691
I like 'em.

684
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:20,198
Are we going anywhere in particular?

685
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,988
Mm-hm.

686
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:27,247
You want some?

687
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,378
- No.
- No?

688
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:33,542
Come on, take a chance.
Take a chance on life.

689
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:53,607
There's a whole bunch of bodies
down there just churning around,

690
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,281
caught in the current.

691
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,588
So what did you do before jail,
Henry?

692
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,719
I worked at a tollbooth.

693
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,051
- Yeah? Which one?
- Eden.

694
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,590
'No!
'Yes.

695
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,510
Yay! I had family on the other side.

696
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,556
We must have seen
each other 100 times.

697
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,440
So, er... wow.

698
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,569
You were one of those guys
in the tollbooth with the er...

699
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,526
those weird... those rubber gloves.

700
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,156
Yeah.

701
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,827
What's so funny?

702
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,737
It's just...

703
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:47,373
You were watching everyone
go someplace

704
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,705
and you were going nowhere.

705
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,121
- That's funny?
- Yeah.

706
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,005
It's funny-sad.

707
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,215
So what did you go to jail for,
Henry?

708
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,678
- Trying to rob Buffalo Savings Bank.
- What?

709
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,096
I thought I was on my way
to a softball game but l... wasn't.

710
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,231
- But now I'm gonna rob it for real.
- What?

711
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,518
I'm going to rob it for real.

712
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,607
You're going to rob the bank
that you went to jail for robbing?

713
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,738
Yeah.

714
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,608
- There's a tunnel.
- What tunnel?

715
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,777
It runs from the bank to the theatre.

716
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:27,367
- My theatre?
- Yeah.

717
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,250
Fucking hilarious, Henry.

718
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,548
You know what?

719
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,959
- What?
- I'm hungry.

720
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,094
- For what?
- Ice cream.

721
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,880
Ice cream.

722
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,476
Let's get some ice cream.

723
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,325
I can't believe I'm sitting here.

724
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,907
Neither can I.

725
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,665
I want to dance and clap my hands.
I think I must be dreaming.

726
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,754
You know,
"God knows, I love my country.

727
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,292
"l love it deeply.

728
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,258
"l couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much."

729
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,923
Page 21.

730
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,975
Could you read Lopakhin?

731
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,688
Sure.

732
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:47,785
"l have to go to Kharkov on the
five o'clock train. Such a bother.

733
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,616
"l wanted to stay and talk to you.

734
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,657
"You're as wonderful as ever."

735
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,575
Read the next line.

736
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,207
"Even more beautiful,

737
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,214
"and dressed like a Parisian...
You could blow me down."

738
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:05,052
Um...

739
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,179
could you say it like you feel it?

740
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,715
Like it's real.

741
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,009
Just say it to me.

742
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,852
OK.

743
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,731
"Even more beautiful.

744
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,063
"And dressed like a Parisian...

745
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,070
"You could blow me down."

746
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,487
You're good. That's really good.

747
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:36,751
You know what, I want you to keep
reading, but get up and walk around.

748
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,170
- "Your brother Leonard..."
- Leonid.

749
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,835
- Leonid.
- Leonid.

750
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,596
"Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber."

751
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,053
Yes, you are, Henry.
You're a bank robber.

752
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,762
"He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care a bit.

753
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,648
"l just want you to believe in me
like in the old days."

754
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,480
Again.

755
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,103
"l just want you...

756
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,319
"l just want you to believe in me
like in the old days.

757
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,529
"l just want
your wonderful, tender eyes

758
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,410
"to look at me like they did then."

759
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,492
Say it without the book now.

760
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:25,925
"l just want
your wonderful, tender eyes

761
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,801
"to look at me

762
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,804
"like they did then."

763
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,056
Oh, I'm so glad I ran you over.

764
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,521
Me too.

765
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,760
Good morning.

766
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,885
Good morning.

767
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,446
Good morning.

768
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,629
- Henry!
- Morning, Max.

769
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,763
Hey, listen. I figured it out.

770
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:58,768
The dirt from the tunnel
goes on the roof.

771
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,850
Ah, company.

772
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,017
- Good morning, Max.
- I'm sorry about the um...

773
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,857
- it's all right. She knows.
- She does?

774
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,240
I didn't know the dirt
from the tunnel goes on the roof.

775
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:17,279
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anyone.

776
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,742
Could I just have a second with you?

777
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,375
Pardon us, will you?

778
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,458
- What do you mean, you told her?
- I told her.

779
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,592
- You told her everything?
- Yeah.

780
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,096
Henry, it's a crime.
A crime's supposed to be secret.

781
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:39,725
- it's OK, Max.
- No, it is not. It's not kosher.

782
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,808
How do you like your bacon?

783
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,479
Crispy.

784
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:56,068
- What were you in prison for, Max?
- I was a confidence man.

785
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,906
You mean a con man?

786
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,617
I um... l don't like that word.

787
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,328
Er, "confidence"
is a little more elegant.

788
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:08,291
"Confidence" comes from the Greek
"fides", meaning faith and belief.

789
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,422
Greek?

790
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,424
I thought it was Latin.

791
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,757
Well, yes, it is... it is now.

792
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:24,058
So, essentially, you make people
feel good and then you rip 'em off?

793
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,190
Yes. But I was always a little better
at the feeling good part

794
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,318
than I was with the ripping off part,
hence jail.

795
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,199
Aren't you worried
about getting caught?

796
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,156
Well, it's kind of
a win-win situation for me.

797
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,787
Why?

798
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,039
I like jail.

799
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:47,202
What about you, Henry?

800
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,744
You like jail?

801
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,584
No.

802
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,498
I like it out here.

803
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,587
So why would you take the risk?

804
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:58,091
Or is it the money?

805
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,426
Well, it must be the money.

806
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,601
Boy, you are a criminal.

807
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,933
You're a greedy little criminal.

808
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:10,440
Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

809
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,151
But I don't care a bit.

810
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,029
I just want you to believe in me
like in the old days.

811
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:19,032
Cute! You remember. Good!

812
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,123
Excuse me.

813
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,783
- Excuse me.
- What?

814
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,328
- Um... what exactly was that?
- It was Chekhov.

815
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,039
Chekhov?

816
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:36,334
- Oh, of course. Yeah.
- We read it last night.

817
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,379
Yeah. He was so good.

818
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:43,220
- You're really good. He's a natural.
- He is.

819
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:46,636
Um... l thought you guys
were out on a date last night.

820
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,224
We were.

821
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,435
So now
going on a date is reading Chekhov?

822
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,191
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

823
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,069
I gotta get to the theatre.

824
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,282
Um... excuse me. Excuse me.

825
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,486
Um... can you give me a ride
to the theatre?

826
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,039
Why?

827
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,370
I'm a volunteer now.

828
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,165
You were never in any of those plays,
were you?

829
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,584
No.

830
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,218
But can you give me a ride?

831
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:32,098
- (CRYING)
- Why didn't you listen to me? Why?

832
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:35,564
We can't turn back the clock now,
poor dear

833
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,774
Crying, crying, crying.

834
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,109
Oh, God. This is driving me crazy.

835
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:42,900
- What?
- We could be digging right now.

836
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,866
- We could?
- If we were in that dressing room.

837
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:51,660
- it's rehearsal. There are people.
- Right. Just pissing me off.

838
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,044
Well, what can we do, Max?

839
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,793
What?

840
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,429
- I got an idea.
- What?

841
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,464
What if you played Lopakhin?

842
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,350
- What?
- If you played Lopakhin,

843
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,478
we could
get into that tunnel any time.

844
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,356
They have a Lopakhin.

845
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,017
- What if they didn't?
- What do you mean?

846
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:21,610
What do I mean?
What if they didn't have a Lopakhin?

847
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,400
I can't be Lopakhin.
I'm not an actor.

848
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,160
You're not a bank robber
and you're doing that.

849
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,696
Max, come on.

850
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,991
- She said you were a natural.
- So?

851
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,627
So a natural is a natural.
And a natural means you can do it.

852
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:39,541
- It doesn't.
- You're gonna be Lopakhin.

853
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:43,210
- There has to be another way.
- No. This is the way.

854
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,635
- I don't know, Max.
- You want the bank, don't you?

855
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,096
- Yeah, I do.
- Then you're gonna be Lopakhin.

856
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,602
End of story. You're gonna be great.

857
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,604
I swear to you.

858
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,811
- it's crazy.
- You're gonna be great.

859
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,521
I'll call you back.

860
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:02,484
Darek, she's taking
a phone call in the middle...

861
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:07,152
I did not take it.
It's exactly what I did not do.

862
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,449
Listen, I was thinking here,
you could step backstage.

863
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,492
(SHOUTING>

864
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:24,210
- What's going on?
- You unprofessional...

865
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:27,220
- Mr Milodragovich.
- ..shit!

866
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,756
Arnold's quitting.

867
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,095
- What?
- He's quitting.

868
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,102
We're talking about Willie Loman.

869
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:37,561
The West End.
A Ken Waterstone production.

870
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,272
Ooh, a Ken Waterstone production!

871
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:41,902

Goodbye, Darek. I'm sorry.

We could have auditions
this afternoon.

- That's a shit list!

What do you want me to do?

882

I can't hear you when you're yelling.

883
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,993
What?

884
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,285
No, no, no, sorry.
I can't give you a ride.

885
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:38,917
I know, no. Before I start,

886
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:43,001
I just want you to remember
that you said he'd be a natural.

887
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,834
Stan, let me call you back.

888
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,466
- What?
- Henry.

889
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,472
- Henry what?
- He'd be perfect.

890
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,383
Perfect for what?

891
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,768
For Lopakhin.

892
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,476
You mean
Henry should play Lopakhin?

893
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,437
- Yes.
- What the fuck! He's not an actor!

894
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,648
Exactly. He's natural.
He'd just be playing himself.

895
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:09,031
Just give this a little thinkage.

896
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,362
The man is Lopakhin.

897
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,199
I mean, he's a man
who's come from nothing,

898
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:18,241
he's a man who's not afraid to create
a new life, put his past behind him,

899
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,625
and he's a man in love with you.

900
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,003
Er... Madame Ravinsky.

901
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,788
Ranevsky.

902
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,502
- What did I say?
- Ravinsky.

903
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,338
- I did?
- it's Ranevsky.

904
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,922
That's weird. OK.

905
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:35,182
Can you maybe
get him in to see Darek?

906
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,932
What's going on here, Max? Hm?

907
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:41,062
What's going on? What are you doing?

908
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:44,646
Listen. The truth is,
you need a Lopakhin

909
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:48,233
and Lopakhin needs a dressing room.

910
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,148
You did this, didn't you?

911
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,623
OK, that... that's fair enough.

912
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,375
OK. OK.

914
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:15,639
- Now, get out.
- I was just... I was getting out.

01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,932
Thanks.

916
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,150
You have no training,

917
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:28,106
you've never been in a production.

918
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,895
You don't even know the play.

says I'm an ups...

How can you perform Chekhov
and not be able to say Andre-ye-vich?

925
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,264
- Say it.
- Andreyevich.

Good. Got the name right. Continue.

01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,315
- A money-grubber.

931

- No.
- No?

01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:20,328
- No!
- No? But convince her, not me.

933

Convince her!

to destroy her life.)

01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:51,373
# You got to fight
for a love that's true

1048
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,669
# Climb every mountain

1049
01:10:57,462 --> 01:11:01,308
# To see every trial
and tribulation through

1050
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,480
# And I'm here to tell you

1051
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:12,937
# Ooh, that's only half the lesson,
yeah

1052
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:18,241
# Now if you want a girl
to come to you

1053
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:23,701
# You've got to leave
a little room for guessing, yeah

1054
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,788
# Whoa, just be easy, baby

1055
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:34,383
# That girl'll come a-running to you

1056
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:38,670
# If you'll just be easy, baby

1057
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:43,933
# Ah, she'll be easy too

1058
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:53,856
# Don't you know, I don't want
a man down on his knees, no

1059
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:58,364
# Runnin' her down
like a mouse at the cheese

1060
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:04,154
# You got to be metal
if you want her affection

1061
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:10,293
# You get too excited
and she's off in another direction

1062
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:13,671
# So be easy, baby

1063
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:19,385
# That girl'll come a-running to you

1064
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:24,133
# If you'll just be easy, baby

1065
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:29,687
# She'll be easy too

1066
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:35,026
# Whoa, be easy, baby... #

1067
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:37,945
What do you guys think?

1068
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:42,575
- If it's a boy, do I out him or not?
- If you mean his dick, yeah.

1069
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,610
You!

1070
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,702
First I see you guys in the bank,

1071
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,666
then I see you guys
in the alley next to the bank,

1072
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:02,508
now I see you coming out
of the theatre behind the bank.

1073
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,173
I know what you're up to, gentlemen.

1074
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,817
So what's on your mind, Frank?

1075
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:25,034
Indigenous currency retrieval
and exchange.

1076
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:28,492
Once a month,
a truck goes to all our partner banks

1077
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,328
across the border to Canada,

1078
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,710
takes up all the currency
and brings it back home.

1079
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:37,873
Let's say, on average,

1080
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:41,509
eight to twelve million
held in our vault for a short time

1081
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,216
before it's picked up
for redistribution.

1082
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:50,226
Only a bunch of fools
would rob that bank any other time.

1083
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,887
I could give you the dates.

1084
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:57,309
I could help you with the alarms,
I could be your guy on the inside.

1085
01:13:57,475 --> 01:14:00,319
Um... hypothetically,

1086
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:03,607
let's just say you were right
about what we were doing,

1087
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,821
which you're not, of course,

1088
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:11,410
um... why would you help us
rob your own bank?

1089
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:16,669
- Got my reasons.
- This sounds like a set-up, man.

1090
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:21,048
I don't fuck around, kid.
Like I said, I got my reasons.

1091
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,336
Well, you'll just
have to forgive us, Frank.

1092
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:27,051
We have to hear 'em.

1093
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,686
Wife got sick a few years ago.

1094
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:36,814
Insurance wouldn't pick up
all the cost so I went to the bank.

1095
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,317
They wouldn't help
cover the difference.

1096
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,655
We were going to retire to France.
The Loire valley.

1097
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:49,827
We had to use all of our savings
to cover the bills.

1098
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,201
Spent everything we had.

1099
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,373
Then she died.

1100
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,636
I been 30 years at that place.

1101
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,673
I'm sorry.

1102
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,138
November 23rd.

1103
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:17,813
The money's dropped off at eight
and picked up at midnight.

1104
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:20,725
(SIGHS) I retire in two weeks.

1105
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,436
This is it.

1106
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,865
You set up that table,

1107
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,072
I'll make sure dinner arrives hot.

1108
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:39,252
Look,
why should I be ashamed to say it?

1109
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,962
Oh. Why Should.._

1110
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:46,213
Why should I be ashamed to say it?
I love him. I love him.

1111
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:50,050
My love is like a stone round my neck

1112
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,886
and it's dragging me down
to the bottom.

1113
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:56,223
But... l love my stone.

1114
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,683
I... l can't live without it.

1115
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,349
For God's sake,
the man has robbed you!

1116
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,358
Oh, no, no, no. Don't say that!

1117
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,940
He's a scoundrel.
Everybody sees it but you.

1118
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,946
A petty scoundrel. A user.

1119
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,199
And you are what? 26 or what?

1120
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:14,237
Ah, please, please,
please, please, stop.

1121
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,701
No. Look. (GROANS)

1122
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,871
Djula, I can hear you
because you're acting very loudly.

1123
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:26,416
But I can't feel you.

1124

(SNIFFS)

1125
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,922
Can I ask you a question?

1126
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,263
- It is very personal.
- Mm-hm.

1127
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,723
Have you ever been in love?

1128
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,189
- Of course.
- Huh. Liar.

1129
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,850
Fuck you, Darek!

1130
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,518
Then show us!

1131
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,527
Show us what love is all about.

1132
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,405
How it rips you apart
and then puts you together.

1133
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:54,660
It carries you to the heavens
and then smashes you to the ground.

1134
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,368
Now, if you want
to become a great actress,

1135
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:00,249
then you
have to reveal something, Djula.

1136
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:03,877
What are you so afraid of, huh?

1137
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:08,166
Maybe you want to die
old, alone, unemployed.

1138
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,585
Is that what you want, hm?

1139
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,170
Djula!

1140
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:18,013
Oh, that's right, Djula.

1141
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:22,305
Run, Buffalotto. Run.

1142
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,018
You're very good at that.

1143
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,854
Five minutes, people.

1144
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:27,393

- Are you OK?
- (WHIMPERS)

1148
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,709
I... hate him.

1149
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,507
I'm a good actress.
I am a damn good actress.

1150
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:57,845
What, I have to love someone
to be a great actress? Horse shit.

1151
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:04,681
I've heard it my whole goddamn life.

1152
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,441
- What?
- That I'm cold.

1153
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,983
No, you're not.

1154
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,500
Ice cold.

1155
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,964
Arctic cold.

1156
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,234
Mm.

1157
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,402
This is it. I got the place.

1158
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,446

1159
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,990
Incredible.

I'm talking palm trees,

1161
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,708
all-you-can-eat sunshine,
nice sandy beach,

1162
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:13,420
surrounded by grapefruits
the size of your head.

1163
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,552
Now, is that living it?
Is that living it? What?

1164
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:20,385
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, that's living it.

- Who the hell's that?

- I'll check.
- Grapefruits, Henry, grapefruits.

1167
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,725
Large, large grapefruits.

1168

- Who is it?
- it's me. Joe.

1169
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,151
I'm sorry, Henry.

1170

Hello. Um...

01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,684
Who's this guy?

1178
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,724
I'm your new partner.

1179
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,113
- Who's this guy?
- I know the whole story.

1180
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:22,823
Joe told me you guys need someone
to help get you into that vault.

1181
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,408
And I don't dig. Dig?

1182
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:28,324
I'm sorry, Max.

1183
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:33,038
Somebody tell me,
who the hell is this guy?

1184
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:36,002
I'm in... or you're out.

1185
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,094
Henry, how about a cold one, huh?

1186
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,304
Let me explain something.

1187
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:49,892
This poor guy
doesn't know what he's talking about.

1188
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,227
He's a drunk bum.

1189
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:54,441
He makes mistakes.

1190
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,604
Drunken bums make mistakes.

1191
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:01,365
Now, you'll please
get the hell out of that chair.

1192
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,781
Henry and I go way back.

1193
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,913
We went to high school together,
right, Henry?

1194
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:11,451
- Yeah, I knew you.
- So just relax, old man.

1195
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,789
Max! Max, Max, it's OK. Max.

1196
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,708
- I know him. I know him.
- All right. All right.

1197
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:29,764
I appreciate
you keeping your mouth shut, Henry.

1198
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:34,933
If there's one quality
I admire in a man, it's loyalty.

1199
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,021
What do you want, Eddie?

1200
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,155
The American dream.

1201
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,949
Deb says we can't have sex
till the baby is born.

1202
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,490
She says the kid'll know.

1203
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:56,208
Get the fuck out of here, Joe.
Just shut up and go home, please.

1204
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,507
So, Henry, what about that beer?

1205
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,138
Shit.

1206
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,678
Opening night.

1207
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,222
Shit, What?

1208
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:17,062
- Opening night.
- Yeah, so?

1209
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:18,601
It's soon.

1210
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,735
Correct. So let's go dig it.

1211
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:23,067
I'm gonna have to leave her.

1212
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:27,906
Of course you have to leave her.
You're robbing a bank.

1213
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:29,615
Max, maybe we should wait.

1214
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,701
Wait for what? A bus?

1215
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:34,458
What are you talking about?
it's a one-time deal.

1216
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,368
The guy's retiring. We can't.

1217
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:38,287
What is the matter with you, anyway?

1218
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,297
Come on.

1219
01:22:56,805 --> 01:23:01,060
What?

1220
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:02,978
I can't do it.

1221
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,989
- You can't do what?
- I can't leave her, Max.

1222
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,991
Leave who? Do what?

1223
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:12,321
- I can't do this.
- Henry.

1224
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,073
Henry, listen.

1225
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,586
You forced me out of jail to help you

1226
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,123
and I'm gonna goddamn help you.

1227
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:28,838
See, I got through my whole life with
my mouth, you know, bullshitting.

1228
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,053
I've been nothing
but a fucking coward.

1229
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:35,595
But now I am going to do something.

1230
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,729
So here's the deal, Henry.

1231
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:42,146
We're gonna dig this tunnel.

1232
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,522
Then we're gonna rob the bank
and we're gonna take the money,

1233
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:50,067
we're gonna put it in a car
and then we are going to drive away.

1234
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:55,827
Do you understand, Henry?

1235
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:01,375
Yeah.

1236
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,380
(SIMON) Henry to the stage, please.

1237
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,843
Henry to the stage.
Lopakhin to the stage.

(LAUGHTER ON TELEVISION)

1239
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,234
I'll be right out.

1240
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,904
Take a chance on life.

1241
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,161
Take a chance on (SINGS) Buffalotto.

1242
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,163
Oh, I hate this commercial.

1243
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,829
- I like it.
- Why?

1244
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:46,294
You're in it.

1245
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,304
Come on. I'm starving. Let's go.

1246
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:57,718
We have to do it opening night.

1247
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:00,888
- What?
- it's the only time we can get in.

1248
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,769
- But that's in two days.
- Yeah.

1249
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,441
So you're leaving?

1250
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,740
Yeah.

1251
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:17,404
Wow.

1252
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,120
Oh, wow.

1253
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,080
Fuck.

1254
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,121
Fuck, Henry.

1255
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,719
- I was thinking we could meet.
- What?

1256
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,222
I was thinking California.

1257
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,350
You were thinking
we could meet in California?

1258
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,226
Yeah.

1259
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:49,395
You know what?
You really are a thief, Henry.

1260
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,814
I mean, California?

1261
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:56,656
Why would I go anywhere with you?
You can't cross a fucking street.

1262
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,286
You wreck my play,

1263
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:00,288
you make me an accessory to a crime.

1264
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,791
I should call the cops
and you should go to hell.

1265
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:07,170
- I didn't know it would be this way.
- Henry, you're a bank robber.

1266
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:10,003
You're a bank robber. Henry.
You're a bank robber.

1267
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,668
Th... I mean,
you knew that you had to leave?

1268
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,713
- No.
- That's exactly what you wanted.

1269
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:20,885
- So that we could be together.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

1270
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:36,321
You know what?
We screwed a couple of times.

1271
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:38,030
Right? So what?

1272
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:43,040
- It was more than that.
- No, really, just a couple of times.

1273
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,290
We both knew
this would never work out, right?

1274
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,874
- I didn't.
- I did.

1275
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:57,842
Go rob your bank.

1276
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,428
Go!

You're a good man, Henry.

Yeah, Max.

1281
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:00,826
Enjoy the show.

1282

Enjoy the show.

1283
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:09,334
Tonight, my dear players,

1284
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:13,248
we can show our audience
that the future is something

1285
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:16,508
we really need to fear.

1286
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:20,296
And to recognise that
knowledge itself is never more real

1287
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:24,387
than in the beauty
of our imagination.

1288
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,477
No, no, no.

1289
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:32,770
Shh, Shh, Shh.

1290
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:37,271
As we say in my home country,

1291
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:40,236
go out there and break some dicks.

- Almost two.

- How you doin', Frank?
- Doing good, Bernie.

Oh, my dear, sweet,
beautiful nursery.

1304
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,735
I used to sleep here
as a little girl.

1305
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:09,951
Your train was two hours late.
How do you explain that?

1306
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:11,911
Is that good management?

1307
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,701

You ever think what you could do
with all that money, Frank?

1310
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:42,445
I know what you'd do.

1311
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:45,073
You'd buy the Bills
and put them in first place.

1312
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:48,110
- It'd take more money than that.
- (LAUGHS)

1313

Hey, get in there, get in there.

1314
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:08,055
I guarantee it, I'd get 'em back into
the Super Bowl within two seasons.

1315
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,591
Perfect. Another chance to lose.

Oh, my childhood,
my innocent childhood.

I used to sleep in this nursery.

I looked out from here
into the garden

- Oh, thank you, guys.
- We wanted it to be from France.

Where is he?

01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:01,900
Where is that old geezer?

It stinks in here.

I tell you every day. Every day
I say the same thing over and over.

You must rent out the cherry orchard

while I went up ten.

Well, it didn't take very long.

- Yes, it is.

and put it in the car. Now.

- it's money, Henry, money.
