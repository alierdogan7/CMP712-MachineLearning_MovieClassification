174
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,917
Some say the reason it's taken him
this long to get married is his fear...

175
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,789
of making just this speech,
but he's making it now!

176
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,523

I know he can do it.

195

And I know I'll know him for the rest ofit.

He's my best friend.

even though the passage can be rough.

198
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,797
But Heck and I were mates
and then lovers.

199
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,459
And it's been smooth all the way.

200
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,709
Maybe that's a better kind of fairytale.

-Hear, hear!

Sort of, toastschmoast won 't do all that.

203
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,413
But if you could all just wish us luck,
Heck and I would appreciate it very much.

How much do I wish it was just us tonight.

337
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,725
He'll definitely be into her, right?

338
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,998
-Coop? He'll fancy Luce?
-She's got a pulse, hasn't she?

339
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:44,041
No, but, I mean.... You do. You would?

340
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:48,169
Well, she's not really my bag of chips,
darling, but, yeah, I suppose.

341
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:53,148
-Oh, what do you think?
-Of her? I haven't really--

342
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,947
Oh, no, no. The shirt?

343
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,222
Oh, uh....

344
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,783
-It's gorgeous. You're gorgeous.
-Yeah?

345
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,225
Want to fool around?

346
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,022
[Doorbell ringing]

347
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,156
Saved by the bell.
But you're in a lot of trouble later.

348
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,464
HECK: Hey.
LUCE: Hey.

349
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,663
[Kissing]

350
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,332
-Come in. You look fab.
-Thank you.

351
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,842
-Guess what I brought?
-Oh, bless you. RacheI'll flip.

352
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,070
-Sweetheart.
-Here I am.

353
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,448
-Hey.
-Hi.

354
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,513
-So, come check out our new sofa.
-Our expensive new sofa.

355
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,057
-You can't put a price on comfort.
-You see, a woman after my own heart.

356
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,750
Listen, do you believe in reincarnation?

357
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,988
It's just that Rach thought
you guys had met before.

358
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:41,862
-That's not quite what l--
-I'd have remembered, I think.

359
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,760
Well, let's hang these flowers
and get that jacket in some water.

360
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,133
-I'll do it.
-Ta.

361
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,467
-Thanks.
-Thank you, darling.

362
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,408
HECK: Well, so, basically,
the book I've wanted to write is...

363
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:57,141
a guide to wherever is the coolest place
on the planet at the time.

364
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,376
If it's February, it's the Rio Carnival.

365
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,420
And if it's, I don't know, May,
it's bulls in Pamplona.

366
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,149
So, if you...

367
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,751
want a holiday/party, then,
you know, you open the book...

368
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,351
and there's me telling you where to go.

369
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,021
'Cause you've been there.

370
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,157
Yeah, that was the plan, but, you know...

371
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,767
Rach, life, work.

372
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,300
-Rach.
-Some day.

373
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,141
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

374
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,438
Anyway, how about you? Married?

375
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,677
Ever been married,
ever gonna be married?

376
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,808
No. No.
Maybe now the laws have changed.

377
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,179
-How do you mean?
-Well, I'm gay.

378
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,053
[Chuckling]

379
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,882
Mmm.

380
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,050
Lovely. Well done.

381
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,955
[Doorbell ringing]

382
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,128
-That'll be Cooper.
-Cooper's coming.

383
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,631
Yeah.

384
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,242
[Rachel clearing throat]

385
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,571
Mmm.

386
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,014
Heck?

387
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,440
-This is absolutely revolting.
-You think so?

388
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,883
It is, sweetheart. It's atrocious.

389
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:12,218
Anyway, more importantly, listen.
It's been three weeks now.

390
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,321
Let's have it.
How much better is sex after marriage?

391
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,190
-Please.
-Because, when I've had sex...

392
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,958
with people after they were married,
they have said that it's fantastic.

393
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,933
-Rach?
-Get wed and find out yourself.

394
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,366
Come on, Cooper couldn't make
that commitment.

395
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,165
We're talking about two or three years
of his life.

396
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,762
Well, not a one-person person.

397
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,341
You really don't think
your other half's out there?

398
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,138
-Or, you know, in here?
-Actually, Rach--

399
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,610
What, there's some
gorgeous women around.

400
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,114
Yes, there are, and I'm trying to
sleep with as many as I can.

401
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,649
And you never fail, do you?

402
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,776
You know, they teach the birds
and the bees about me.

403
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,349
[Laughing]

404
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,287
It'll all change when you meet Miss Right.

405
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,188
And how am I supposed to know
when I do that?

406
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,989
You don't know, not straight away.
It just feels...

407
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,191
warm and comfortable...

408
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,430
and you hang in there and give it a chance,
before you know it, you're like...

409
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,302
"Yeah, this is it. Must be love."

410
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,741
-Yeah, I'm with her.
-I'm with her, too. Give me that.

411
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,873
LUCE: I don't agree.

412
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,308
I think you know immediately.
You know, as soon as your eyes....

413
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,344
Then everything that happens
from then on, just proves...

414
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,820
that you had been right
in that first moment.

415
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,120
When you suddenly realized you had
been incomplete and now you are whole.

416
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,062
-Actually, I'm with her, I'd say.
-I'm with her, too.

417
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,530
Sorted. So, who's for pudding?

418
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,930
-Yes.
-No.

419
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,127
-No?
-No.

420
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,728
If you think that, you think that
everyone that doesn't have all that...

421
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,037
business is settling for less.

422
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,237
-That's not what I'm saying.
-That kind of is what you're saying.

423
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,472
I think she said it a bit nicer.

424
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,275
Trifle?

425
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,210
You look tired, chief.
You have a good day at work?

426
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,415
-Shite. I'm quitting.
-Did you check out flower girl back there?

427
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,786
Made that speech for me.

428
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,360
Later on tonight,
we're gonna fall madly in bed.

429
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:59,021
-Oh, it's going well for you guys?
-It's going very well.

430
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,262
She's a lesbian.

431
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,399
Is that right? Cool.

432
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,271
You don't think that slightly impedes
your plans for seduction?

433
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,303
Anyone can change teams.

434
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,745
Not anyone. I wouldn't....
'Cause, you know.... But anyone, I mean....

435
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,854
What are you doing?

436
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,295
-It's gorgeous.
-It's raining.

437
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,532
Heck won't come up here.

438
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,002
They say it's subconscious fear
you'll throw yourself off...

439
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,978
but he freaks when I go near the edge, too.

440
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,206
Sorry about dinner.

441
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,777
I've eaten worse.

442
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,226
-Kind of went off.
-You didn't go off.

443
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,762
You went a little way off.

444
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,460
-You're wet.
-I'm fine.

445
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,264
-And you're cold.
-I'm fine!

446
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,770
-You can have it. Really, you can have it.
-I'm so fine.

447
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,204
-It's fine. Well--
-Okay, now you're cold.

448
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,969
Hey, what are you guys up to?

449
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,202
Nothing.

450
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,142
Well, Coop wants to play
strip poker or strip Cooper...

451
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,148
and I really want him to go home.

452
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,647
-Good night.
-See you soon.

453
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,947
-Two.
-Thanks for dinner.

454
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,489
Bye.

455
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,282
Cheers, Coop.

456
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,831
LUCE: Next left.
COOP: It's one option, yes.

457
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,233
COOP: How about instead, we just go
straight back to my place?

458
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,862
LUCE: Coop, take the next left.

459
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,640
-You all right, Luce?
-Why, 'cause I don't want to shag you?

460
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:58,206
You're welcome not to shag me,
just don't sit in my car all bored like that.

461
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,549
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,746
Really.

463
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,589
You've got something on your mind,
that's obvious.

464
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:14,222
You know what you should do?
You should share with me.

465
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,231
Because beneath this rugged exterior...

466
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,571
there beats a sensitive soul.

467
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,971
-No, there doesn't.
-No, there doesn't, but tell me anyway.

468
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,607
Bet it's a girl thing, no, right?
I mean, it's got to be.

469
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:33,514
It's a hot and horny scene.
It's you and another vagetarian.

470
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,753
Come on. Tell Uncle Cooper all about it.
Spare me no detail.

471
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:42,487
Have you ever met someone and just....

472
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,760
-But there was someone else already?
-Yeah, sure.

473
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,599
Hot ones are always taken.

474
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,630
-So, what do you do?
-What do I do?

475
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,667
I shag them.

476
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,736
Partner is their problem, it's not mine.

477
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,712
Yeah, I think you don't mess
with other couples.

478
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,183
Don't cause that pain, ever.

479
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,219
You just face facts that it can't happen...

480
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,385
walk away.
Hook up with someone available instead.

481
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,523
Well, your place or mine? Come on, let's....
I'm so good in bed.

482
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,226
So, you promise me the whole
matchmaking thing is over, right?

483
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,396
Last night was a big success.
They left together.

484
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,771
That distant sound you hear
is wedding bells.

485
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,173
What, you didn't twig?

486
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,878
-Oh, damn, you are so uncool.
-What? Twig what?

487
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:41,884
Well, the thing you didn't know about
Luce is the fact that she's...right here.

488
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,783
-Hey, hey.
-Hey, hi!

489
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,980
-Hello.
-Hi.

490
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,751
Weirdest thing,
we were just talking about you.

491
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,450
Oh, all nice, I hope.

492
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,691
-Oh, sorry. Heck, this is Edie.
-Edie.

493
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,593
-Heck.
-And Rachel.

494
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,790
-Rachel.
-Edie.

495
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,801
-Luce?
-Good.

496
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,469
-So, Saturday shopping?
-ls right.

497
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,133
Great.

498
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:08,242
Enjoy it. And listen, thanks for dinner.
We should definitely--

499
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,506
-Definitely.
-We will.

500
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,742
-Okay. Well, have a nice rest of shop.

00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,378
"You have won a share of £1 million."

672
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,046
Excellent.

673
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,587
-Oh, you are home.
-Hi.

674
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,150
Oh, God. Am I glad to see you.

675
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,987
The morning I've had.
I just had to get away, you know?

676
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,800
-Shall I burn some lunch?
-Please.

677
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,132
Hey, you got some vids.

678
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,537
-Yeah, don't bother looking. I just got--
-This one's great.

679
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,042
This one's pants, but whatever.

680
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,805
And here's one I haven't seen before.

681
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,575
Which, are you....

682
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,444
[Exclaiming]

683
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,580
They gave me the wrong one. That....
Oh, my God! That....

684
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,023
The woman at the video store.

685
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,661
-I'll take it back.
-Yeah, take it back. That's excellent, yeah.

686
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:30,222
I mean, what, it's porn, right?
It's degrading.

687
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,562
-It's offensive.
-God, yes.

688
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,660
Yeah. Let's watch it anyway.

689
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,295
Come on, Rach, I mean,
things have been getting...

690
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,398
a bit slack in that department recently.

691
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,967
-I know it's my fault and it's.... Yeah.
-No, it's mine. I....

692
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,108
But I don't wanna watch this.

693
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,716
-Why?
-lt doesn't turn me on.

694
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,055
Makes one of us.

695
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,360
[Crowd chattering]

696
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,533
I love the smell of hot dog in the evening.

697
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,363
Smells like...

698
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,543
-hot dog.
-Yeah.

699
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,410
The thing is, Ned,
what I wanted to ask was--

700
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,847
-Two, please.
-I was just wondering if it was a bit...

701
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,817
odd for you guys,
you know, after you got married?

702
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,378
If the interplay between you two...

703
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,481
got a bit...

704
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,082
-clutchy?
-Do you want onions?

705
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,593
No, thanks.

706
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,391
-Because what I'm finding--
-Mustard? Ketchup?

707
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:37,899
-I can recommend both.
-No, I'm trying to talk to you here.

708
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:41,961
-Oh? What about, dear boy?
-Well, it's just.... I'm just.... Well....

709
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,270
I'm finding it a bit tricky at the moment
with Rachel--

710
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,708
Oh, God, you mustn't discuss her with me.
Never do that.

711
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,279
-Sorry?
-Well, that's our problem, you see.

712
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,349
Two of us,
we can be most pleasant to each other...

713
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,216
talk of sport or weather
till our throats hurt.

714
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,447
-Yeah, yeah.
-Never mention Rachel.

715
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,118
As soon as you do,
the only concrete thought...

716
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,453
running through my mind is...

717
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,492
that hound is putting it up my daughter.

718
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,135
Rach.

719
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,227
[Crowd cheering]

720
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,375
TESSA: Darling, I don't know
what to do about your father.

721
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,349
He's never been
the last of the red hot lovers...

722
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:32,354
but, recently, it's got to the point
where he's jealous of stiff wind.

723
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,480
HECK: Hey, you guys.

724
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,082
-Thank God you're here.
-You have no idea.

725
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,251
Good. Got you both.

726
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,522
Now, how are my grandchildren
coming along?

727
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,892
Could you get me away from her, please?

728
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,465
Just hinting, darling.

729
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,569
One wants to have them while
one's still young enough to pick them up.

730
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,833
[Exclaiming]

731
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,947
You know, what I do with your parents
is remind myself...

732
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,643
that if it wasn't for them,
I wouldn't have you.

733
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,121
What's up, baby?

734
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,865
Let's go home.

735
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,160
Now, remember,
try not to look like you're my child, okay?

736
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,204
Because it puts men off.

737
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,001
But keep your eyes peeled,
and if you spot anyone, you think...

738
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,042
-you know, "Well, he looks nice--"
-Hi.

739
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,270
-Luce!
-Hey, hey.

740
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,815
-How you doing?
-This is my friend, Beth. She's on her own.

741
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,112
Now you've found a friend, can I go home?

742
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,378
No.

743
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,613
-Trying to find her a man.
-There aren't any.

744
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,087
Trust me, I've looked. Oh, careful.

745
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,057
-Sorry, Mrs....
-Don't call me "Mrs."

746
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,621
Hello.

747
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,925
All right?

748
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,040
Brilliant.

749
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,369
LUCE: [Singing] You've got a boyfriend
You've got a boyfriend

750
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,573
No, I haven't. Not yet.

751
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,849
I can't wait till you get a boyfriend.

752
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,321
-You probably can, actually.
-You could even get a husband.

753
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,324
You're old enough. Find one like Heck.

754
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,327
H, I should explain something to you.

755
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,991
I do believe I will be with one person
for the rest of my life...

756
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,534
but that person will be a woman.

757
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,395
I understand.

758
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,306
You do?

759
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,698
My best friend is Natalie Curtis.

760
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,573
I'd rather spend the rest of my life
with her than any boy.

761
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,234
There you go.

762
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,308
It doesn't mean
that you're a lesbian or anything.

763
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,717
H: Come on, let's go.

764
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,118
[Humming]

765
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:51,055
-I'll put the kettle on, babe.
-I'll have a beer instead.

766
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:52,919
Really?

767
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,797
-I was gonna offer, but....
-But what?

768
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,394
Rach, are you pregnant?

769
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,342
No. No, I'm not, no.

770
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,241
I just thought
it might explain your recent....

771
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,746
Whatever. Nothing.

772
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:20,785
Unless....

773
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,382
Unless what?

774
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,024
Mmm.

775
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,022
Do you want to get pregnant?

776
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,233
You and my mum.

777
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:37,071
Listen, I know we said
we were going to wait...

778
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,836
but until what,
you know, we're even more settled?

779
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:41,767
Come on, what do you think?

780
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,581
[Cell phone ringing]

781
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,287
I got to take it.

782
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,083
Rob, hey, what's up?

783
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,321
No, I've a minute.

784
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,995
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They're in my briefcase, hang on.

785
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,274
[Children laughing]

786
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,843
[Cell phone ringing]

787
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,477
Hello.

788
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,011
Hello.

789
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,126
Hey, gorgeous.

790
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:35,187
That was Rob.
Look, I'm really sorry about this but....

791
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,166
No, of course you should still go.

792
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:44,001
You know, I wouldn't put you through
my evening for all the coke in Colombia.

793
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,941
You know, it'll be the usual bollocks,
everyone will get pissed.

794
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,068
I'll get pissed...

795
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,145
[Phone ringing]

796
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,680
and start singing country and western
songs badly like I always do.

797
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:52,874
Hello?

798
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:57,285
-Heck, it's Luce.
-Hey, Luce. How's it going?

799
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,587
It's Luce. What's up?

800
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,287
Nothing. My phone just rang and--

801
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:05,361
Sorry, you busy Tuesday night?

802
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,295
Do you fancy
escorting my wife somewhere?

803
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,889
It's just, like, I've got this
wanky work thing which I can't get out of.

804
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,299
You know, it'll be really great
if you could look after Rach for me.

805
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,597
Go on, say yes. Go on.

806
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,196
-Then, yes.
-Brilliant. Brilliant.

807
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,743
Well, Rach will ring you with the details...

808
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,835
and be safe.

809
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,314
You, too.

810
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,052
You shouldn't have done that.
I hardly know her.

811
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,746
Yeah, but she's your...

812
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,447
soul-mate-for-life type thing.
You'll have a belter.

813
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,526
Beer.

814
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,095
Does she know where we're going?

815
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,320
[Crowd yelling]

816
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,890
Go on, hound him!
Hound his legs, chop him!

817
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,570
-Over there!
-On the left side!

818
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,133
-You know, you're kind of shrill.
-What?

819
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,973
When you shout.

820
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,570
You want them to hear your abuse better,
you've got to project it.

821
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,149
-Teach me.
-Okay.

822
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,721
First off, tighten your stomach muscles.

823
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,451
-I don't think I've got any.
-Yeah, you do.

824
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,789
-You really do. They're right here.
-There?

825
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:11,883
Mmm-hmm.

826
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,656
-Tighten.
-Tighten.

827
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,621
-Tense them.
-They're pretty tense.

828
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,257
Okay, next, broaden your diaphragm.

829
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,527
-My what?
-It's here.

830
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:23,740
Oh.

831
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,438
Okay, push it out against my hand.

832
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,005
You feel my hand?

833
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,807
Maybe if you put them both there.

834
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,389
Okay.

835
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,657
And now, for the big one.

836
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:48,029
Imagine the roof of your mouth
is a cathedral.

837
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,367
-No, you've lost me.
-Oh, come on.

838
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,460
No, the muscles,
the diaphragm, I'm there, but--

839
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:55,731
It's a space thing.

840
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,673
All right, your mouth is that big
that you have to fill it with sound.

00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,067
MAN: It's a pretty little corner space...

1014
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,899
-north, right?
-These, these. On the house. Go.

1015
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,270
Okay, so do you see? You have to see.

1016
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,939
I can't do this. I can't actually do this.

1017
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,949
So whatever it is or was,
it's got to stop, and it's got to stop now.

1018
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,040
Do you understand?

1019
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:37,811
It's over.

1020
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,784
Ow!

1021
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,363
-What, what?
-Thorns in my bum.

1022

[Both giggling]

1024
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,494
I'm sorry.

1025
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:30,702
[Door opening]

1026
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:34,936
It's another customer.

1027

[Both giggling]

1028
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,108
HECK: Hello?

1029
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:44,647
Luce?

1030
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,747
Luce, you in the back?

1031
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,186
Don't come in, Heck, l....

1032
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,829
I was stock taking.

1033
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,027
You know, counting the....

1034
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,630
-Hey.
-Hey, yourself.

1035
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:06,802
What do you want, Heck?

1036
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,008
Buy some flowers. What else?

1037
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:15,180
-Flowers, of course.
-Not for me, for my wife, Rachel.

1038
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,643
HECK: Recently, she's just been a bit....

1039
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:19,510
I don't know.

1040
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,689
But you know what they say...

1041
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,553
there's nothing quite so cheering
as a well-timed bloom.

1042
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:25,085
So, I thought
one of your finest arrangements.

1043
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,183
Absolutely.

1044
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:29,288
-What does she like?
-You know what she likes.

1045
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,035
Lilies. She likes lilies.

1046
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:39,239
-Lilies? Right, well, that's simple.
-Yeah.

1047
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,077
So, did you enjoy the football
the other night?

1048
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,009
It was an experience.

1049
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,478
[Heck chuckling]

1050
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,181
How did you find Rachel?

1051
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,146
Fine. I mean, I wouldn't....

1052
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:54,318
Fine.

1053
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,716
I don't suppose she....

1054
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,358
No. Well...

1055
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:03,023
I was just wondering
if she said anything about...

1056
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:03,566
me or....

1057
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:04,897
me or....

1058
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,407
I just think I'm doing something wrong,
is all.

1059
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:14,533
I mean, that's what I think.

1060
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,337
HECK: And if she said what it is...

1061
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,715
that I'm doing, or not doing,
then I can stop it.

1062
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:25,085
Or start, or whatever, you see.

1063
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:26,513
And then we can....

1064
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,091
Like before.

1065
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,018
We can get back to being like before.

1066
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,759
-She didn't say anything.
-No.

1067
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:39,890
And I've embarrassed you.

1068
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:44,500
And myself, which is normal, very normal.

1069
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,470
-These are beautiful. How much do l....
-No, they're on the house.

1070
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,472
Thanks.

1071
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,508
You should ask her, you know. Not me.

1072
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,845
Bless you, but...

1073
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:01,446
I can't ask Rachel
if there's anything wrong.

1074
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:03,752
I mean, that's way too scary.

1075
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,652
Why?

1076
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,264
What if there is?

1077
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:13,895
Thanks.

1078
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,281
Rachel!

1079
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:35,456
-Rachel, wait!
-Luce, please!

1080
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,890
-Just talk to me.
-What do you want me to say?

1081
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:41,191
I heard him.
Jesus, I'm lying there, and I heard him...

1082
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:42,730
and he's blaming himself.

1083
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,424
You can put an end to this.

1084
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,865
-How?
-Tell me to go.

1085
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,204
Tell me that's what you want,
and I will walk away...

1086
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,297
and you will never see me again.

1087
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:57,746
Is that what you want?

1088
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:01,784
I want you.

1090
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,521
I know.

1091
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:14,351
I can't....

1092
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:16,958
I know.

1093
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,797
We'll be okay.

1094
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,405
Don't forget me.

1095
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,911
I won't remember anything else.

1096
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:22,089
Come on, Jeff, you scratch my back
and I'll kiss your arse.

1097
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,527
Okay, can you repeat that, please?

1098
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,400
Okay, 41 flat.

1099
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:30,404
Okay, well, let me just factor that into
the computer and crunch some numbers.

1100
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,031
He can't go any higher.
I mean, he hasn't got it. He can't.

1101
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:36,334
Yeah, the screen's flashing red
at me here, Jeff.

1102
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,913
It's not gonna cut it.
In fact, the figure that I'm reading is....

1103
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,209
Yeah, but the figure I'm reading
is forty-one and a half.

1104
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,048
That's 41.5. Any lower just can't be a go.

1105
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,179
That's way too much. It's too much.

1106
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,813
[People chattering]

1107
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,686
So let's do it, Jeff. Let's work our way up.
Give me 41.1. Give me that.

1108
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,660
We're feeling no pain there,
and you know what?

1109
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,892
If we're at 0.1, let's have some fun.
Let's double down.

1110
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,368
Yeah. Yeah, there you go.

1111
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,664
All right, keep on coming.

1112
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:08,903
Keep on coming. Give me three, three is
well in. You give me that right now....

1113
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,707
You will?
Well, then go one more. Go to four.

1114
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,408
I really, really, really don't wanna do it.

[Sighing]

1116
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,179
Yeah, yeah. Jeff, you know,
don't take that tone with me.

1117
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,053
You know, I'm giving you a chance here.
Now, do you wanna be a big dog...

1118
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,751
or do you wanna play on the porch
with the puppies?

1119
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,762
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I feel that.
Okay, last one, my friend.

1120
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,662
Over the cliff. I'm holding your hand,
I'm cupping your balls.

1121
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:33,929
I'm there with you, and I'm there for you.
You've gotta ask yourself, Jeffrey...

1122
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,664
do you trust me? Do you trust me?

1123
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,033
Congratulations. We can deal.

1124
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:47,314
My boy, for that,
you get a bonus as big as my knob.

1125
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,405
Well, screw your bonus.

1126
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,451
I wish I could.
Now, where d'you wanna go for a drink?

1127
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,781
Screw you, too, Rob.

1128
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,053
Hecky, what is it?

1129
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:58,658
It just.... It makes me sick, you know.
You lie. You just lie.

1130
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,322
Well, so do you.

1131
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,667
Not anymore.

1132
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,599
Heck. Hecky. Hecky, come back!

1133

-Hi.
-Afternoon.

I'm looking for a breakup plant.

1135
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,353
-A what?
-A breakup plant.

1136
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:28,683
Explain.

1137
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,657
Well, I don't like my girlfriend.
I wanna break up with her...

1138
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,626
via the means of plant.

1139
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,960
Well, it should be a breakup bouquet,
and it should be hydrangeas.

1140
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,534
They mean,
"It's over, but think well of me."

1141
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,330
Perfect. I'll take one.

1142
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,997
-One bouquet?
-One hyer-whatsit.

1143
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,969
But that's not a lot.

1144
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,838
Well, I don't care if she thinks well of me.

1145
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,912
D'you know what? Piss off!

1146
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:53,038
-Pardon?
-Out! Get out of my shop.

1147
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,811
She's well rid of your fat arse, anyway.

1148
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,501
Mum?

1149
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:17,936
ELLA: I'll be right out.

1150
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,799
Take your time.

1151
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,853
Oh, sweet shit in a bucket,
what's wrong with you?

1152
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,460
Blow your nose, then explain.

[Sniffling]

1154
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:46,957
I met this girl.

1155
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,334
She's with someone else.

1156
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:53,700
And does she love you?

1157
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:56,778
I don't know.

1158
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,036
No.

1159
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,077
Yes.

1160
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,249
But it doesn't matter.

1161
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,657
Oh, it's all that matters.

1162
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:14,725
She's with someone else. She can't....

1163
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:19,761
[Sighing]

1164
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:21,999
When Dad left you, he broke your heart.

1165
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,600
It mends again.

1166
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,640
Look at you, you look fantastic.

[Chuckling]

1168
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,911
I may be older than God,
but I can still make an effort.

1169
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,288
A date? Does my mother have a date?

1170
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:43,057
I'm going to eat food with a man, yes.

1171
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,349
And how do you feel?

1172
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,254
Oh.

1173
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,989
Well, you know,
when you're holding a hot cup of coffee...

1174
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,693
and you realize you're going to sneeze?

1175
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,163
That's how I feel.

1176
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:59,104
Come here.

1177
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:01,109
ELLA: Well, yippee.

1179
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,623

Never fails.

1182
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,502
Eight pints of water before bed,

But it's such a short time.
How can you be sure?

1362

I knew after three seconds.

1363

You're quite wrong, you know.
You've always been enough for me.

1390
