1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:03,919
Here's to the one year anniversary
of you ** wedding.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,830
At least we're finally using
the free honeymoon.

3
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:08,475
Yeah, not exactly what I thought
we'll be using it.

4
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:15,674
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary!

5
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:18,968
I'm glad you all could be here
to commemorate the worst day of my life.

6
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:21,928
No. I thought the worst day
was **.

7
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:24,479
***

8
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:27,224
what about the day when
** upside down?

9
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:30,747
♪♪ right now.

10
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,633
Remember that time
when I got my **?

11
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,999
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Why am I participating in this?

12
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:37,915
- Who wants an oyster?
- Me. - Me. - Me.

13
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:40,567
No. None for me. I'm extremely
allergic to selfish.

14
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:48,391
Ah, yes. She gets all puking
and I gotta take her ** very rewarding.

15
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:51,425
Wait, wait, wait, keep them away from
Dave also because he's super allergic.

16
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:52,792
Yeah. Super allergic.

17
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:55,745
Why **?
This is too much work.

18
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:58,127
Penny, you're sweet
but so so dumb.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,894
You want to eat your oysters
as soon as they've been **.

20
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,866
Now, when ** an oyster you really
wanna make sure that you get in there.

21
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:08,125
*** ahh!

22
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,875
You stabbed me, dude!

23
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:14,927
I stabbed you, dude!

24
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:17,870
- Oh my God.
- Guys!

25
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:19,864
What do I do?
I got it.

26
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:22,116
G-get my epipen. It's in my purse.
On the chair. Okay.

27
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:25,470
Somebody get this knife out of me!
Oh, God. Ohh.

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,753
I got it! I got it!

29
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:28,785
I got it. What do I do?

30
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,095
Dave. Dave, Dave, Dave! You
can't touch shellfish either.

31
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:32,480
Oh, right.

32
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:35,115
What do I do? I only have one shot!

33
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:36,254
Throat's closing up.

34
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,027
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:38,574
Aah! What do I do?!

36
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,850
Oh, all right! Okay!
I'm not allergic to shellfish.

37
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:41,820
What?

38
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,690
D-- Oh, God.
Here comes the puke.

39
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:44,987
Well, why did you lie?

40
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,557
When you do it, it makes me...
I know. I know. I know.

41
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,364
I-I can't hear the sound.

42
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:49,325
Okay, everybody chill!

43
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:49,915
Aah!

44
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:52,483
Aah!
Aah!

45
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,112
Ohh. Ohh.

46
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,197
Oh!

47
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:58,903
Oh. Ohh.

48
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,655
Should we order a movie?

49
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:02,937
"Lincoln Lawyer."
I love these opening credits.

00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:18,221
Ladies and gays,
welcome to my new home!

52
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,477
Excuse me, but Max is
the only gay <i>aqui.</i>

53
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:23,505
I don't know. A lot of people
think you're on the low.

54
00:02:23,584 --> 00:02:25,759
This is surprisingly nice.
Hmm?

55
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:26,736
Agreed.
Yeah.

56
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,111
Yeah. Wow.
It's two bedrooms,

57
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:30,487
2 1/2 baths,
Italian marble countertops.

58
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,352
In a word, <i>amah-zing.</i>

59
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:32,954
- Oh, just gonna ride that
into the ground, huh? - Again?

60
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:34,007
- No, <i>please</i> stop.
- No.

61
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:36,202
Guys, it's always been
my dream to be a homeowner,

62
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,965
and I decided, why do I have
to wait to get married

63
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:39,505
to buy my first place?

64
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,859
We are so proud of you.

65
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:43,056
This is gonna be
the year of Penny.

66
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:45,109
Who wants to twirl with me?

67
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,778
Whoo! Whoo!

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,096
Whoo!

69
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,223
Hooray!

70
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,119
What?

71
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:58,099
Oh, now a brother can't twirl?

72
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:00,008
Dude, you psyched
for movie night?

73
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,576
I got all the best
black-and-white classics.

74
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:03,417
I got "Lethal Weapon,"
"Trading Places,"

75
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,470
"Beverly Hills Cop."

76
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,835
No, "Beverly Hills Cop"
is black and white <i>and</i> white.

77
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:08,197
What about "men in black"?

78
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,947
No, that's black and white
<i>in</i> black.

79
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,213
What about "Erin Brockovich"?

80
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:12,316
That's just white as hell.

81
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:13,178
"Royal Tenenbaums"?

82
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:13,884
Come on, bro.

83
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:15,093
That's white, white,
white, white,

84
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:16,307
white, white,
white, white, white,

85
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,666
black...

86
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:20,829
Brown...

87
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:22,329
Then wack.

88
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:23,525
- Damn, trick.
- Listen, man,

89
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,148
I'm not gonna be able
to make it to movie night.

90
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,296
Just gotta work late.

91
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,491
What? This is, like,
the third time

92
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:28,749
you bailed on me in two weeks.

93
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:29,747
We never get to hang out
anymore.

94
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,658
Dude, it's just getting crazy
over there, you know?

95
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:34,324
Is this 'cause I stabbed you?
I said I was sorry.

96
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:35,795
You did <i>not</i> say you were sorry.

97
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:36,665
I did say-- I said I was s--

98
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,067
No, you said,
<i>"comme ci comme ca.</i>

99
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,532
"That was pretty cool
how it went in your leg.

100
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,950
I thought there would be
more blood."

101
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:44,541
That's my version of an apology,
and it's pretty heartfelt.

102
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:46,768
Come on. Let's hang out.

103
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:48,927
Come on. I don't do well
when I'm alone.

104
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:52,930
So...
How's Penny's new place?

105
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:55,409
Oh, it's awesome, but you're
probably allergic to it.

106
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,092
Listen, Al, I only lied to you
because I didn't have

107
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,568
the heart to tell you
that your jambalaya

108
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,347
is the most disgusting thing
I've ever tasted.

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,563
- No offense.
- Offense.

110
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:05,326
Guys, every couple has little
lies they tell each other.

111
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,252
I mean, not Brad and me.
We're perfect, but my point is--

112
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,192
Last year Brad bought
a motorcycle, crashed it,

113
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,476
and then sold the parts
to his cousin Randall.

114
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:14,572
Pfft. (Laughs) I knew that.

115
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:17,790
I mean, he is a... wild hog.

116
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:20,820
Anyway, you two have a chance
to start over as friends,

117
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:23,717
- so why don't you just clean the slate...
- Uh...

118
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,941
- And just be honest with each other
from now on? - I guess we could try.

119
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:27,461
Trust me, you will feel better.

120
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:29,865
Okay. Um...
Yeah.

121
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,029
I never really liked
your goatee.

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,574
Oh. Didn't-- Was not
really aware of that.

123
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:37,568
Um... okay. Uh, I don't really
love your favorite perfume.

124
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,320
I hate your mom.

125
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,285
Oh, ho ho ho!
Uh...

126
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:40,353
Okay. (Chuckles) Well...

127
00:04:40,435 --> 00:04:41,233
Okay, I think that's a...

128
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,016
- No. No, no, no.
- Good start for today.

129
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:44,462
She wants to play.
I can play.

130
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:45,324
All right.

131
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:46,757
I'm not really afraid of dogs.

132
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,767
I was just afraid of what
would <i>happen</i> to a dog

133
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:50,248
if you owned one.

134
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,547
Okay.

135
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,225
You know those stupid webbed
barefoot running socks?

136
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:55,665
They weren't bad
for your calves.

137
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,678
They were bad for my ability
to want to have sex with you.

138
00:04:57,772 --> 00:04:59,237
Ohh!

139
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:01,129
That's funny.

140
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,652
Okay. Richard Gere is not
a hurricane Katrina denier.

141
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:04,437
- What?
- Yeah.

142
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:05,724
I just said that to you
so we didn't have to watch

143
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,584
"pretty woman"
for the 74th time.

144
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:08,768
Well, you know
your friend Glazer?

145
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:11,149
He didn't actually steal my bra
and sell it on craigslist.

146
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,534
I just couldn't spend
another Sunday

147
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,872
- watching you two play <i>frolf.</i>
- Frolf?

148
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:16,100
Frisbee golf.
Frisbee golf.

149
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:17,772
Okay, you know that thing
under your mantel

150
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:19,983
that I told you was
a tiny brick closet?

151
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,707
It's actually
a working fireplace.

152
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:23,474
I was afraid you were gonna
burn the building down.

153
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,226
Okay, well, I hated
that song you wrote for me.

154
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,554
"Love to the power of love"?
You said it made you cry.

155
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,196
It was 12 minutes long,
oh, and terrible.

156
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,553
- Oh, you want to know terrible?
- Yeah.

157
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:33,927
That stupid hula-hoop dance
that you do.

158
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:34,615
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

159
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:36,573
Yeah, this one here,
where I take the hula-hoop,

160
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:37,447
and I put it on, and I do this,

161
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,395
and I shake it,

162
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:40,217
- shake it, shake it?
- Still terrible.

163
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,687
Bring it up. On the neck.
Look, I take it to the neck.

164
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,688
- Hey, let's-- Let's...
- And you don't like this?!

165
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:46,229
- Hoop it on down.
- You don't like this?!

166
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:47,299
Hoop it on down.

167
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,882
Wow! That was healthy.

168
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,318
God, now that
you guys aren't together,

169
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:54,143
you are able to sing your songs
and hoop around

170
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,655
and watch your Gere movies
and play your frolf.

171
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,801
I mean, whew.
You feel great?

172
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,554
Yeah.
I feel great.

173
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:02,436
I might get bangs.
Mm.

174
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:03,621
No, I'm not.
I'm not gonna do that.

175
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,781
I'm not.
Jane, you crazy.

176
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:05,794
You know, I'm gonna go
back to work.

177
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,014
Go to work!

178
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,294
Thanks for helping me
pick out this lamp, Jeremy.

179
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,413
Thanks for your number.

180
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,608
Thanks for asking for it.

181
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:13,231
I'd say this afternoon
has been il...

182
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,867
Luminating.

183
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:16,098
Okay, we're gonna quit
while you're behind.

184
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:17,110
'Cause it's a lamp.

185
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:18,491
- Yeah.
- See?

186
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:19,972
Year of Penny is firing
on all cylinders.

187
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,245
I buy a condo to prove
I don't need a guy

188
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:22,684
to get on with my life--
Boom!

189
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,633
I meet a guy I wouldn't have met
if I hadn't bought a condo

190
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,235
to prove I don't need
to get on with my life.

191
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,306
We get it.
You have a condo.

192
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:28,708
Well, it's a pretty big deal.

193
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:29,579
What the hell?

194
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,331
What?

195
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:31,899
Brad said he was gonna be
working late.

196
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:32,703
So?

197
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,721
So if that's work,
then I should be considered one

198
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,486
of "Chicago business" weekly's
top 30 under 30.

199
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,003
He's just hanging
with some guys.

200
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,734
Don't make a big deal
out of this.

201
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:41,148
Are you gonna make
a big deal out of it?

202
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,737
Well, I don't think
that's a very bright...

203
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,513
Idea.

204
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:46,987
I gotta go buy a bulb and take
this lamp bit to the next level.

205
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:48,639
I am on fire!
Year of Penny. Suck it.

206
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,943
Get outta here with that, man.

207
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,197
Crazy, man.

208
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:53,273
Thanks for that beer.

209
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,455
That's what's up, man.
Hey, keep it cool, brother.

210
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:56,906
All right.
That's what's up.

211
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:57,759
Whoa.
I'm sorry. I'm s--

212
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:00,790
L'Bradford! I do declare.

213
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:02,513
You must be
coming from your office.

214
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,076
This is a really nice office.

215
00:07:04,163 --> 00:07:05,415
Is this your fax machine
right here?

216
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,478
You mind if I have a sip
of your fax machine?

217
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:08,636
Okay.

218
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:11,851
What a delicious fax machine!

219
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:12,684
Just calm down.

220
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:14,977
You lied to me, man, and now
I find you at a sports bar

221
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,819
with a bunch
of very attractive black men,

222
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,132
one who looks like Dwyane Wade.

223
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,870
Why can't I hang out with you?

224
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,022
'Cause I'm white?

225
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,657
No, Max.
This is a networking thing.

226
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:26,079
I didn't not invite you
because you're white.

227
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,140
It's because
you're not professional.

228
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,274
Well, I could be professional.

229
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:32,506
Yeah.
You have a better chance

230
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,628
of being black
than professional.

231
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:34,840
That's not a challenge.

232
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:36,423
- That is not a challenge.
- I feel you.

233
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,136
- What was that?
- Shy city.

234
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,411
- Just don't do that.
- Ah, ha ha.

235
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:40,950
The rock is definitely
in the building.

236
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,797
- Unnecessary.
- Watch the throne, son.

237
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:44,668
- Watch the throne, you know what
I'm sayin'?- Watch your step.

238
00:07:44,753 --> 00:07:46,894
- I don't know this man!
- It's in my blood!

239
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,105
Africa! Africa!

240
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:53,386
Welcome. You are
my first gentleman caller.

241
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:54,625
That made me sound like
a prostitute.

242
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:55,557
I'm not a prostitute.

243
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:58,609
Wow.
This place is amazing.

244
00:07:58,718 --> 00:07:59,622
Thanks.

245
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:01,674
Do you have any roommates?

246
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:02,597
Nope.

247
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,251
It is just me and you.

248
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:08,071
Really? Wow.
I live with five guys.

249
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:09,190
Ooh. I love guys.

250
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,404
Again, not a prostitute.

251
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,460
Is this Italian marble?

252
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,937
S-sure.

253
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,640
Yeah. I guess.

254
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:21,204
How many square feet
is this place?

255
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:22,666
Oh, I don't know.

256
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:23,798
You really have your life
together.

257
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:24,945
Is that a bad thing?

258
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:27,084
No. I just need to... go...

259
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,571
Work on my resume, and...

260
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:30,463
Oh, no, no, no, Jeremy.
I'll...

261
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,894
Jeremy, wait.
I know it seems like

262
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,964
I have my life together,
but I am a mess, okay?

263
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,021
Psycho.
I will, like, friend your mom on Facebook

264
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:38,453
and start showing up at events
I was not invited to, okay?

265
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:39,230
Look, you know what?

266
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:40,279
These cabinets
are not even that nice.

267
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,967
I mean, look at this.

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,570
Ooh!
Is that a wine fridge?

269
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:46,319
Jer? Jer Bear?

270
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:49,190
Hon, Jeremy was clearly
a loser.

271
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,277
Yeah, most guys would kill
to date a girl

272
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:52,655
- with a place like this.
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:53,958
Last girl I dated
lived on a boat...

274
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,128
That's romantic.

275
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,741
Docked in the parking lot of
the pet store where she worked.

276
00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:59,736
Okay, I-I don't know
where you find people.

277
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:00,880
You know what?
You guys are right.

278
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,130
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

279
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,260
I mean, this place is great.

280
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:05,325
I'm great.

281
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:08,011
Year of Penny back on track!

282
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:09,302
- Mm. Yes.
- Year of Penny!

283
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:12,424
I am gonna take these
into the bedroom.

284
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:14,829
What's happening?

285
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,496
These are the running socks that
Alex didn't want me to wear.

286
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:19,469
Can you believe that she hated these?

287
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,555
Hate? No.

288
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,366
Those are, uh... great.

289
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,290
- Right?
- Uh, yeah.

290
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:28,126
So... I got you a pair...

291
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,417
- Ohh.
- Just to say thank you

292
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,253
for freeing us from our lies.

293
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:32,629
Wow.

294
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:33,453
Let's go for a run.

295
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:34,480
Oh! Good. Yeah.

296
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:35,966
What's this--
What's this color?

297
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:36,983
Like, an aquaflage?

298
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:38,135
Yeah.
I hope you like the color.

299
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:40,958
Oh, yeah. No, Jane loves
a good aquaf--

300
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,661
I'm gonna go try--
I'm gonna give 'em--

301
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,739
I'm gonna try 'em on.

302
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:50,085
Hi. I'm Mrs. Sarner from 3G.
Welcome to the building.

303
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,556
It's nice to see a couple
buying this place.

304
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:53,353
- Oh, it's, uh, it's--
- Oh, no. We're not--

305
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:54,279
- No.
- We're not...

306
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:57,594
'Cause the last two ladies who
owned this condo were so sad.

307
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:59,115
They both died alone.

308
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,174
That is something
that was not disclosed to me.

309
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,047
Some people in the building
even think this unit is cursed.

310
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,538
Isn't that crazy?

311
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:09,299
As if a condominium could turn
a gal into a sad spinster.

312
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,227
These cookies are cran-apple.

313
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:14,912
Thanks.

314
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:16,020
Enjoy.

315
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:18,911
Thank you.
See you at the mixer.

316
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:22,536
Penny, relax.
This place is not cursed.

317
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:23,383
Penny.

318
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,694
You didn't
tell me you got a cat.

319
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:26,897
He is so cute.

320
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:28,710
Aw. You <i>are</i> cute.

321
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,620
Wait. I didn't get a cat,

322
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,391
because...
Cats are for spinsters.

323
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,500
Is it cold in here?

324
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,626
I need a housecoat
and a hot tea with lemon.

325
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,007
Should I get
an AOL e-mail address?

326
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:39,132
What's happening to me?!

327
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:41,999
So this isn't your cat?

328
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:43,149
No!

329
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:45,617
Ugh.

330
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:48,107
Max, why do we keep watching

331
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:51,188
- the same "Lethal Weapon" scene over and over again?
- 'Cause I lost my murtaugh.

332
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,935
I don't understand
most of what my friends say.

333
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:53,809
Brad doesn't want me

334
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,251
joining his stupid
professional networking group.

335
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,594
Oh, fuzzy face. Come on.

336
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,506
You said you'd watch all these
Richard Gere movies with me.

337
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,749
I heard "Primal Fear" has
a very cool surprise ending.

338
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:03,823
Gere finds out
that Norton was lying

339
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,004
about his split personality

340
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,484
and that he murdered
the archbishop.

341
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,134
Come on. Okay, uh,
what about "Unfaithful"?

342
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:09,204
Gere bashes
the French guy's head in

343
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:10,354
with a snow globe.

344
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:11,297
You're killing me.

345
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,448
Just like tumors killed
Winona Ryder

346
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,116
in "Autumn In New York."

347
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:15,105
Why are you doing this?

348
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,143
<i>Hello,</i> Alex!

349
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,272
Oh, nice socks.
You look like a gay ninja.

350
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:21,431
I am gonna go for a run
with Jane.

351
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,752
Oh! And I called glaze
earlier.

352
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:25,561
Good convo. Tough, yes.

353
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:27,221
There were tears
because of your lies,

354
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,488
but, uh, I'm gonna go play
some frolf with him,

355
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,327
make him feel better.

356
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:31,621
Well, I wish I could watch
you nerds,

357
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,226
but I've gotta make more
jambalaya.

358
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:34,849
People are going crazy for it
at the store.

359
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:37,460
Really? Women are just going
crazy for trying on clothes

360
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,160
and eating hot seafood soup?

361
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:42,228
They can't get enough
of that hot seafood soup?

362
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:43,508
Yeah.

363
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,816
I've had the worst day ever.

364
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,654
Ew.

365
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,743
Morning started with frolf...

366
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,256
<i>Dave, glaze, myself.</i>

367
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:54,557
- Ohh!
- Ow!

368
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,440
<i>And since I told Alex</i>
<i>she'd be a great dog owner,</i>

369
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,717
<i>we went to the shelter,</i>
<i>but turns out</i>

370
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:59,590
<i>she's only qualified</i>
<i>to take care of a snake.</i>

371
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:01,344
I'm naming him Tyler.

372
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,343
<i>Then I stupidly encouraged Dave</i>
<i>to record his song.</i>

373
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,188
♪ Love times love ♪

374
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:09,084
♪ divided by love ♪

375
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,324
♪ equals love ♪

376
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:13,989
♪ to the power of love ♪

377
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,546
<i>Then it was back to Alex's,</i>
<i>where she wanted to prove</i>

378
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:16,869
<i>she could make a fire.</i>

379
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,517
I'm not... sure
you should be feeding peeps

380
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:21,403
to the snake.

381
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,543
He seems a little bit off.

382
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,463
No, he loves them.

383
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:25,141
What about the flue, al?

384
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,696
Snakes don't get the <i>flu.</i>

385
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,030
Did you even open it?

386
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:28,932
What?

387
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:30,881
Did you use charcoal
to make a fire?!

388
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:33,095
Oh, Jane.

389
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,220
Kind of ironic, isn't it?

390
00:12:34,306 --> 00:12:36,152
You see, you pushed
Dave and Alex to stop lying,

391
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,412
but now all <i>you</i> can do
is lie to them.

392
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:44,027
You're doing exactly what
you don't want them to do.

393
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:45,198
Look at you, all dirty,

394
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:48,066
- just covered in lies.
- Yeah, I see. That's funny.

395
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:50,052
You want to tell me about that
motorcycle you bought last year?

396
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,520
Hmm? What?

397
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,988
Run you a bubble bath?
Okay.

398
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,708
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- All right.

399
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:58,690
A bag of pennies in her face.

400
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:05,356
Maxwell Blum, JD, DDS, esquire.

401
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,307
How's it going?

402
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,335
"JD, DDS"?

403
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,924
You're a lawyer <i>and</i> a dentist?

404
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,814
I like cleaning teeth.
Sue me.

405
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:12,553
Hey, Max, can I talk to you
for a second?

406
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:13,943
Talk is cheap. Am I right?

407
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,601
Let's get down
to some brass tacks.

408
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,068
What's going on
with this debt ceiling?

409
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:18,173
Does China own us?

410
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:19,825
I want to join
your professional group.

411
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:21,015
You guys network so well.

412
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:22,291
Professionals' group?

413
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:24,940
I haven't had a job
in, what, like, five years?

414
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:26,691
Unless you count sleeping
till 1:00

415
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:28,739
and trying to bring back
the phrase "bust a move"

416
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:29,680
as a job.

417
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,007
Oh, my God.

418
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:33,385
You're, like, black Max.
You're-- You...

419
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,861
You're <i>blax!</i>

420
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:36,599
Hold up.

421
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,857
Is this white Daryl?

422
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:42,549
I am not white Daryl,

423
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:43,657
and you lied to me again.

424
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,341
Look, sometimes
I just wanna hang out

425
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:46,161
with the brothas.

426
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:47,200
Why are you talking like that?

427
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,239
'Cause I was hangin' out
with the brothas,

428
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:50,467
and it takes a little while for
it to go away. See? It's gone.

429
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,668
Sometimes I just need a break

430
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,545
from talking about npr
and recycling or...

431
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:56,880
That awesome chest pass

432
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,874
- Steve Nash made.
- Oh, really, fam?

433
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:00,819
- Yeah. - Now you're gonna
pull out that Steve Nash card

434
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:02,518
- on a brotha. - Wait. Why are
<i>you</i> talking like that?

435
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,437
Because we're all, you know,

436
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:04,296
everybody's with the brothers,

437
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,396
and we're all hanging out
and talking like that.

438
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:07,764
Look, I didn't tell you
because you get all crazy

439
00:14:07,865 --> 00:14:09,565
any time you feel excluded
from something.

440
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:10,598
That's...

441
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:11,879
Hey, Brad.

442
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:12,660
If I hook you up

443
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:14,072
with a partially used
borders gift card,

444
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:16,531
you think you would give me
a ride to small claims court?

445
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:18,922
Crap. Damn it.
I <i>am</i> white Daryl.

446
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:23,316
I'm totally fine, Jane.
I took the cat to a shelter,

447
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:25,211
and I know
my apartment's not cursed.

448
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,139
Oh, and I decided
to have a housewarming party,

449
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:29,944
roaring '20s theme,
so it looks like

450
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,803
the year of Penny
is back in full...

451
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:33,619
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

452
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:35,969
What the hell
is with all the cats?

453
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,135
No. Come on.
Just get to steppin'.

454
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,045
Get on now.
Move it along. Come on.

455
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:44,804
Get out! Get out!

456
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:47,262
Shoo! Shoo!

457
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,641
Okay, Penny.

458
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:52,028
Calm down.

459
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,793
Get some wine. Take a breath.

460
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,932
Just watch some tv.

461
00:14:57,031 --> 00:15:00,419
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

462
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:05,819
Why is the DVR filled

463
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:08,263
with "the good wife"
and "the view"?

464
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:09,383
I didn't record these.

465
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:11,982
These are for lonely women
who talk to themselves.

466
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:13,954
Oh, my God! I'm talking to myself.

467
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,647
"Single meals for one"?

468
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,101
"Personal pizzas"?

469
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:30,542
"Personal pizzas."

470
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:37,662
Jane, you're not wearing
your running socks.

471
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,531
Oh, yeah.

472
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:42,440
I am bummed, too, glaze,
but Penny wanted it

473
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,293
to be historically correct
with the 1920s theme, so...

474
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,175
Grr...

475
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:47,357
Ooh, well,
then I'll just go Polish

476
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:49,014
the China
in the servants' quarters.

477
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,835
You don't Polish China.

478
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:55,166
'Sup?

479
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:57,185
'Sup... with you?

480
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,262
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for your big party?

481
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,693
It's already happening.

482
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:07,317
Pen. Pen. You okay?

483
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,576
Like anybody cares.

484
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:09,595
Give me the ice cream.

485
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:12,785
Okay. Got another one.

486
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:13,776
Okay, how did you--

487
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:14,807
Ah.

488
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,978
All right, g-give me
the couch ice cream...

489
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,825
Ohh.
And let's get you dressed.

490
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:20,318
Just leave me alone, Jane.

491
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,551
Give me the ground ice cream...

492
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:22,513
Mnh.

493
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,079
And let's get you dressed.

494
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,445
- Go. Go.
- Come on. Let's go.

495
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:26,974
Hey, <i>Brad.</i>

496
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:30,482
How's it goin'?

497
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:33,363
Oh. Where are my manners?
These are my gay friends.

498
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:35,193
You know, sometimes you just
wanna hang out with your peeps.

499
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,239
Right.

500
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,942
Anyway, this is Connor.
He's enormous.

501
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:39,608
This is Joel. He's silent.

502
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,080
And this is Steve.
We call him gay Brad.

503
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:44,023
No, we don't,
and my name's Ken.

504
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,588
- And he's Asian.
- He's Asian? Pfft.

505
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,762
I don't see skin color
or eye shape.

506
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,098
Anyway, let's get out
of here, guys.

507
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:50,916
These straight folks
are bringing me down.

508
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:52,667
- Let's go talk about gay stuff.
- Ooh!

509
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:54,746
- Gay stuff?
- That's right, Brad.

510
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:57,036
Gay stuff. Come on.

511
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,444
Don't you wish they made
trading cards of designers?

512
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:02,700
Ah.

513
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:04,158
Ohh. Really, Alex?

514
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,313
You're gonna serve
that disgusting jambalaya?

515
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,595
This is a housewarming party,
not a house-clearing party.

516
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,907
Boom! Poetry slam.

517
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:14,908
Oh, uh, heard you went
down to the shelter,

518
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,311
and they wouldn't let you
have a dog,

519
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,079
so you had to get a snake
instead.

520
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,360
Had to? No, no, no, no.

521
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,997
I chose Tyler, okay?
Dogs are played out

522
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,565
with their whole "soft,
cuddly best friend" thing.

523
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,745
Honestly, on a scale of
fur to scales, I prefer scales.

524
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:30,119
Well, things have been going
pretty awesome with me, too.

525
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:31,704
Been frolfing and jamming,

526
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,948
and, uh, my song turned out
so great that

527
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:37,023
glaze put it on his web site--
defglazerecords.com.

528
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:38,123
Dot org was taken.

529
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:39,422
Been getting tons of hits.

530
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:40,677
Don't make a big deal
about it, baby.

531
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:41,357
That's awesome.

532
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,754
Maybe you should play it here
for everyone.

533
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:43,804
- Yeah!
- No.

534
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,314
- Here.
- Bro.

535
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:45,104
- No.
- Yeah.

536
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,443
- Bro.
- Bro.

537
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,610
I didn't bring my guitar.
I-I can't--

538
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,047
That's all right. He's got one.
Why don't you ask him?

539
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:52,563
Uh, yeah, um...

540
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,464
Do you really think
I can pull off

541
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,347
that slim-fit James Perse
crew neck t-shirt?

542
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,361
As long as I can be there
when you pull it off.

543
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,795
What's happening here?

544
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,105
I was just talkin' tees
with my B's,

545
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:02,720
who are "G,"
'cause they like "D."

546
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:04,813
- Oh, yeah.
- Pound it.

547
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,458
No! Gay Brad,
you do not pound Brad Brad.

548
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,109
Gays, inside. Go!

549
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:10,127
You guys can pound me.

550
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,504
Why can't I pound
your friends, man?

551
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:12,914
Because they're not my friends!

552
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:14,284
They're just some guys
I met at the gym

553
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,790
who are way too
into the roaring '20s.

554
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:17,308
What is going on with you, man?

555
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:18,792
- I'm freaking out!
- About what?!

556
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:20,106
We used to hang out
all the time, right?

557
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,403
And then you got married
to Jane,

558
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,357
and you got
this big, fancy job.

559
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:24,920
I-I barely ever see you
anymore,

560
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:25,997
and the free time
you do have--

561
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,353
You spend it with other people.

562
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:28,368
Dude...

563
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:31,301
We're always gonna have stuff
going on in our lives, man.

564
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,736
- Well, me, you know, my life.
- Your life's pretty much--

565
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:35,553
- Of course.
- Yeah, yeah.

566
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:36,908
But you're my riggs, trick.

567
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:38,431
I am, ho?

568
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:39,563
Come on, fella.

569
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,604
You know murtaugh would
never bail on riggs,

570
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,157
even when real-life riggs
gets super racist

571
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:45,962

Thank you, Jane.
You see, Dave? What did I--

597
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,850
Uh, calm down, Al.
Everything you've done

598
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,342
in the past few days
has been pretty stupid.

599
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:38,087
You almost burned down
your apartment.

Is your breakdown sponsored

Look, you're not gonna turn
into an old spinster

603
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:46,023
just because you bought
a condo,

604
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,495

is not cursed.

00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:49,287
Okay, yeah, Jane?

606
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:50,800
Then you want to explain
about all the cats?

607
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:54,345
Wait. You found my cats?
I live next door.

608
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,832
I've trained them to crawl
into vents and open windows.

609
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:59,391
Fair enough. Okay.

610
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:01,473
Then what about all the episodes
of "the view" on my tv?

611
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:03,164
Uh, you didn't erase those,
did you?

612
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,091
'Cause I can't DVR "the view"
at home anymore,

613
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:06,505
'cause my DVR is filled
with episodes of "the view,"

614
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:07,787
so I have to DVR it here.

615
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,446
Okay, then does someone
want to explain to me

616
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,077
this coupon

I don't know any other songs.
