STELLA: The cherry.

You finally got to Glenda. Did she

Glenda is seriously involved

00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,502
MATTTY: A divorce?
NED: Yeah, he's ripe.

337
00:34:41,752 --> 00:34:44,797
No. l signed a prenuptial agreement.

338
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,342
-What?
-He insisted.

339
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:53,013
He blamed it on his sister, Roz.
She hates me, but he wanted it too.

340
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:56,100
-How is it?
-lt's bad.

341
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:59,770
l get some money for a year,
not much. That's it.

342
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:07,570
Does it matter, Ned?
Tell me the truth, please.

343
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:13,451
The truth!
l wish you were going to be loaded.

344
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,329
Does it matter? No.

345
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:27,840
God, you make me happy!

346
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:34,138
lt's time for your present.

347
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:47,568
Now, when it starts coming down on you,
l'll be there to protect you.

348
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,869
Try it on.
l bet l guessed the size right.

349
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:04,627
l love it!

350
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:06,879
NED:
l want to see.

351
00:36:06,921 --> 00:36:07,588
MATTY:
Here.

352
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:32,113
Hello, sweetheart.

353
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:34,615
Have l got a nice present for you!

354
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:37,702
Hi, Aunt Matty.

355
00:36:38,577 --> 00:36:40,162
Heather.

356
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:43,999
EDMUND: What is it again?
HEATHER: Rover.

357
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,461
HEATHER: lt's between first and second.
EDMUND: That's not a shortstop?

358
00:36:47,712 --> 00:36:50,464
No. The shortstop is between
second and third.

359
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:52,550
Good, that's the way l remember it.

360
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:54,677
EDMUND:
Have a good time.

361
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:58,180
You don't really mind, do you?

362
00:36:58,431 --> 00:36:59,682
Roz will pick her up Thursday.

363
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:03,144
Don't worry.
Roz won't stay overnight.

364
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:05,896
She can do whatever she wants.

365
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:49,649
Oh, my God!
You scared me.

366
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:53,903
You shouldn't be here.
Heather's upstairs.

367
00:37:54,153 --> 00:37:55,946
NED: Asleep.
And l know what l want.

368
00:37:56,197 --> 00:38:00,451
l know. l missed you so badly,
but it's too dangerous.

369
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:02,995
-She won't wake now.
-You're so wet.

370
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:05,331
NED:
l waited out there for 2 hours.

371
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:07,416
MATTY:
You're so salty.

372
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:11,462
MATTY:
Let me.

373
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:15,216
Lie back.

374
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:16,759
HEATHER:
Aunt Matty?

375
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:26,852
What do you say?

376
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:29,146
-l did!
MATTY: She did.

377
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:31,357
Thank you, Aunt Matty.

378
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:35,820
-Thanks, Matty. We appreciate it.
-A pleasure, Roz. Any time.

379
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:13,566
-lt's just me tonight, Filomena.
-Okay. Just one minute.

380
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:17,570
Well, hello to you!

381
00:39:19,488 --> 00:39:23,576
Darling, this is Mr. Racine.
l'm sorry, l don't know your first name.

382
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:26,370
Ned.

383
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:28,664
Edmund Walker.
Nice to meet you.

384
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:32,084
Mr. Racine is the lawyer
l told you about.

385
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:35,838
You remember. He had a client
who wanted to buy the house.

386
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:37,882
MATTY: l told him we weren't selling.
-Right.

387
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:39,383
NED:
That hasn't changed, has it?

388
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:42,136
No, we're very happy with it.

389
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:45,431
l can understand that.
lt's a terrific place.

390
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:47,558
Are you going in?

391
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:49,727
l was going to grab a bite.

392
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:52,021
Join us.

393
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:55,650
-No! Thanks, l don't want to interfere.
-No. Don't be silly.

394
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,777
We have room for three, don't we?

395
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:00,488
EDMUND: lt's great,
but you can't get near it on weekends.

396
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:04,408
-l don't get down during the week much.
NED: ls that right?

397
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:09,830
l was a lawyer.
l still am, but l don't practice.

398
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:13,042
-l went to Columbia. And you?
NED: F.S.U.

399
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:17,088
EDMUND: A good school.
l got bored with it quick.

400
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:19,340
l didn't have the temperament for it.

401
00:40:19,924 --> 00:40:22,134
l wanted to make the money faster.

402
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:23,970
EDMUND:
ls there a living in it here?

403
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:27,557
l can afford to send out my shirts. . .

404
00:40:27,807 --> 00:40:31,727
. . .and eat here once a month
if l don't order an appetizer.

405
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:38,776
Honest lawyers don't make much
and the other kind are too slimy for me.

406
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:41,779
l'd rather be up-front
about shafting somebody.

407
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:42,989
MATTY:
Edmund, really!

408
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,616
-lt's his profession.
NED: That's all right.

409
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:47,201
l don't like it much.

410
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:49,412
Call me Ned, will you?

411
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:51,789
EDMUND:
What's to like?

412
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,334
lt's the way of the world.
Most people despise their jobs.

413
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:56,878
Do you?

414
00:40:59,171 --> 00:41:00,464
EDMUND:
No, l love it.

415
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:03,092
But it's not a job.

416
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:05,553
What is it exactly?

417
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:10,600
l do various things.
This and that.

418
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,477
EDMUND: Here and there.
NED: You don't have to be specific.

419
00:41:16,272 --> 00:41:19,358
Finance, basically.
Venture capital, real estate. . .

420
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:21,777
. . .investments.
We're into a few things.

421
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,155
-Around here?
EDMUND: Some.

422
00:41:24,655 --> 00:41:25,573
EDMUND:
Some things here.

423
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:28,034
Edmund's company owns The Breakers.

424
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:32,038
NED: Really?
EDMUND: lt's not that simple, really.

425
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:34,999
We have an interest
in a few places along the shore.

426
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:38,002
For the land, someday.

427
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:40,087
Don't try explaining it to her.

428
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:43,549
l'm too dumb.
A woman, you know.

429
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,303
l'll be right back.

430
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:52,558
Then maybe we can talk about
pantyhose or something interesting.

431
00:41:59,357 --> 00:42:01,025
She's something, isn't she?

432
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:03,277
NED:
She is a lovely lady.

433
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:05,154
EDMUND:
Yes, she is.

434
00:42:05,404 --> 00:42:07,365
And l'm crazy about her.

435
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:10,493
lf l thought she was seeing
another guy. . . .

436
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:12,495
l don't know.

437
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,123
l could understand how it could happen,
the way she is.

438
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:17,792
l could understand it, but. . .

439
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:22,004
. . .l think l'd kill the guy
with my bare hands.

440
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:24,507
That's understanding.

441
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:29,679
NED:
Please.

442
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:33,850
You'd never believe the dorkus
she was with when l met her.

443
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,728
The guy came to us
with a business proposition.

444
00:42:38,771 --> 00:42:40,940
We're always looking for opportunities.

445
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,484
We're willing to take a risk. . .

446
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:46,863
. . .if the downside's not too steep,
if conditions are right.

447
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:50,324
But this guy,
he hadn't done his homework.

448
00:42:50,575 --> 00:42:54,495
He didn't know the bottom line.
That's how l knew he was full of shit.

449
00:42:54,745 --> 00:42:58,166
Got to know the bottom line.
That's all that counts.

450
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,710
But he didn't have the goods,
this guy.

451
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:03,838
Like lots of guys you run into. . .

452
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:08,134
. . .they want to get rich, do it quick,
be there with one score. . . .

453
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:12,597
But they're not willing to do
what's necessary. You know what l mean?

454
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:16,601
l'm not sure. You mean
do the groundwork? Earn it?

455
00:43:18,144 --> 00:43:20,646
No, l mean,
do what's necessary.

456
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:23,441
Whatever is necessary.

457
00:43:27,445 --> 00:43:31,991
l know that kind of guy.
l hate that. lt makes me sick.

458
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:34,202
Me too.

459
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:36,746
l'm a lot like that.

460
00:44:11,864 --> 00:44:14,951
BEVERLY: Some messages are on your desk.
l'll be back in an hour.

461
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,142
Jesus!
Did Beverly see you?

462
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:41,727
l waited until l saw her leave.

463
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:44,605
MATTY:
Please, don't be angry.

464
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:48,359
Angry? l'm not angry.
How did you get in?

465
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:50,111
MATTY:
lt didn't lock.

466
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:53,197
Ned, hold me.

467
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:55,324
Please.

468
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:57,827
MATTY:
Just hold me.

469
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,330
MATTY:
God, l love you!

470
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:05,084
MATTY:
He left this morning.

471
00:45:05,334 --> 00:45:07,587
MATTY: l had to see you.
NED: l know.

472
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:13,843
l couldn't call.

473
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:16,971
l was afraid to. l was afraid
you wouldn't let me come.

474
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:19,015
You mustn't call.
Never call.

475
00:45:19,265 --> 00:45:21,768
Be careful.
The phone company keeps records.

476
00:45:22,101 --> 00:45:23,770
l am careful.

477
00:45:24,145 --> 00:45:25,396
Ned, l hated it.

478
00:45:25,646 --> 00:45:28,691
l hated sitting there with you two.
l thought l'd scream.

479
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:30,777
You called my apartment from the house.

480
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,737
MATTY: No, never.
-Those two times?

481
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:34,614
MATTY:
l went to phone booths.

482
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:36,366
l'm afraid of him--

483
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:40,119
That's good. Be very careful now
about the phones.

484
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,081
-Why say this now?
-We can account for some calls.

485
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:45,041
We've had some contact.

486
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:47,460
Why?
What's happened?

487
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:52,423
Because we're going to kill him.

488
00:45:55,176 --> 00:45:57,470
We both know that.

489
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:01,474
lt's what you want, isn't it?

490
00:46:02,475 --> 00:46:04,310
We knew it was coming.

491
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,146
lt's the only way we can
have everything we want.

492
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:25,873
That man is going to die. . .

493
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:30,670
. . .for no reason but we want him dead.

494
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:35,967
He doesn't deserve it.
Let's not ever say that.

495
00:46:37,552 --> 00:46:42,515
We'll do it for us. You get half of all
he owns, that's what the will says.

496
00:46:46,144 --> 00:46:47,854
NED:
That's it, then.

497
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:53,359
We're going to kill him.

498
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,903
And l think l know how.

499
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:58,614
-lt's real, then?
-lt's real, all right.

500
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:06,706
And if we're not careful,
it'll be the last real thing we do.

501
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:32,000
MATTY: Her mother works plenty hard
to keep Heather on Edmund's mind.

502
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,713
Always bringing her around,
reporting on what she does in school.

503
00:48:37,171 --> 00:48:39,257
That Roz is a smart one.

504
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:43,720
And anything Heather inherits goes
to Roz. Heather won't even see it.

505
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:47,849
That's what seems so wrong,
that half of it should go to her.

506
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,685
There's nothing we can do about it.

507
00:48:50,935 --> 00:48:52,478
Are you sure?

508
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,024
l was thinking that maybe there is.

509
00:48:56,274 --> 00:49:00,028
The will is with Edmund's lawyer
in Miami. l know that.

510
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:03,698
What if l got him to bring it home?

511
00:49:04,198 --> 00:49:07,619
And couldn't we rewrite it?
Change it?

512
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:11,581
Every change would mean a lot for us.

513
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:14,042
You know how to write it.

514
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:16,294
lt wouldn't seem so odd.

515
00:49:16,544 --> 00:49:21,549
l'd say he brought it home and we
decided to make some changes up here.

516
00:49:21,883 --> 00:49:23,760
-And l knew you already--
NED: No!

517
00:49:24,218 --> 00:49:25,470
Forget it.

518
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,305
Why should Heather take half?

519
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:31,643
Nothing strange can happen
in his life now.

520
00:49:31,893 --> 00:49:34,854
Not one thing out of the ordinary.

521
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:37,148
That's the most important thing.

522
00:49:37,398 --> 00:49:40,693
lf it does,
the chances double that we get caught.

523
00:49:41,736 --> 00:49:43,571
You'll get half of everything.

524
00:49:43,821 --> 00:49:47,659
lt'll be plenty, no matter what.
We won't get greedy.

525
00:49:50,245 --> 00:49:52,372
lf we do, we'll get burned.

526
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:57,001
You're right, darling.

527
00:49:58,545 --> 00:50:00,630
l'm sorry.
l know you're right.

528
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:20,066
l know where he is.
lt's not far from here.

529
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,196
-l don't want you with me.
-l thought we settled that.

530
00:50:25,446 --> 00:50:26,823
l'll wait in the car. . .

531
00:50:27,073 --> 00:50:30,827
. . .but l want to take the risk with you.
We're both doing this.

532
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:38,793
(LlP SYNCHlNG)

533
00:50:59,147 --> 00:51:01,649
What's the matter?
Can't think with music?

534
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:06,487
lt's like this, l said.
lt's fast, it's hot, it's simple.

535
00:51:07,405 --> 00:51:10,450
You can use the clock
or rig it to something that moves.

536
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,578
lt starts big.
lt will go with just the mag chips.

537
00:51:13,953 --> 00:51:16,998
You want a little more,
splash a little accelerator around.

538
00:51:17,957 --> 00:51:19,584
NED:
ls it just regular gasoline?

539
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:23,379
Regular, unleaded, supreme.
Whatever you like, Counselor.

540
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:28,134
l got to tell you, though,
this mama has a big drawback.

541
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,011
lt's easy to spot.

542
00:51:30,845 --> 00:51:33,765
Even after the meltdown,
they're going to know it's arson.

543
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,183
l don't care about that.

544
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:37,852
That's all there is to it?

545
00:51:39,604 --> 00:51:43,483
No, that ain't all. You've got
to get in, you've got to get out.

546
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:47,946
You've got to pick the right spot,
the right time. . .

547
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:52,575
. . .and try not to get famous
while you're in the act.

548
00:51:52,826 --> 00:51:55,119
lf that's all,
any idiot could do it.

549
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,496
NED:
l'm sorry.

550
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,540
l want to ask you something.

551
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:01,042
Are you listening to me, asshole?

552
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:04,587
Because l like you.
l got a serious question for you.

553
00:52:05,547 --> 00:52:06,673
What are you doing?

554
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,925
This is not shit for you
to be messing with.

555
00:52:10,218 --> 00:52:14,347
Ready to hear something? l want you
to see if this sounds familiar.

556
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:19,477
Any time you try a decent crime,
you've got 50 ways you can fuck up.

557
00:52:19,727 --> 00:52:24,232
lf you think of 25 of them, you're a
genius. And you ain't no genius.

558
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:27,110
Remember who told me that?

559
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,739
No smoking in here.

560
00:52:32,157 --> 00:52:35,994
Look, why don't you let me
do it for you? Gratis. l'll do it.

561
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:39,122
l wouldn't be on the street
except for you.

562
00:52:40,415 --> 00:52:41,749
Thanks.

563
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,044
l sure hope you know
what you're doing.

564
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:48,465
You better be damn sure,
because if you ain't, don't do it.

565
00:52:49,424 --> 00:52:51,718
Of course, that's
my recommendation, anyway.

566
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,511
Don't do it.

567
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:57,932
Because l'll tell you something,
Counselor. This arson is serious crime.

568

And?

You'll be downstairs.

570
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,955
MATTY:
2:30, l send him down.

571
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:27,462
We won't talk again
after l leave here tonight.

572
00:53:29,672 --> 00:53:33,259
l'll be in Miami Friday.
You won't be able to reach me.

573
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:40,683
When l see you again,
he'll be dead.

574
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:46,648
l'm frightened.

575
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:20,450
EDMUND:
Jesus, take it easy!

576
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,161
EDMUND: l thought l was tense.
MATTY: Where are you going?

577
00:55:23,411 --> 00:55:24,371
EDMUND:
l can't sleep.

578
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,498
-l'm going to get something to drink.
MATTY: Edmund.

579
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,170
l can't sleep, either.

580
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,925
Come back to bed, darling.

00:55:56,528 --> 00:55:57,862
MATTY:
Don't stop.

00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,366

00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:24,806
MATTY:
What's wrong?

585
00:56:25,724 --> 00:56:28,852
l think someone's downstairs.
l heard something.

586
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:30,478
MATTY:
Are you sure?

587
00:56:32,314 --> 00:56:33,940
MATTY:
Want me to call the police?

588
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,693

l'm going to nail this bastard.

589

EDMUND: Quiet!

590
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:41,990
-l've never seen that.
EDMUND: lt's a surprise for this fucker.

591

He has a gun!
