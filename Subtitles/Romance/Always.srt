165
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,955
Here's my point.
I'm talking to this guy.

166
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,459
He tells me about
this tanker school in Flat Rock, Colorado.

167
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,044
A school for fire pilots.

168
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,213
There are no forest fires
in Flat Rock, Colorado,

169
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,299
because there are no trees.

170
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,927
That is why they
call it Flat Rock, you dunce.

171
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,936
I think they
know this, Pete.

172
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,939
That's why they
chose Flat Rock.

173
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,025
So they could start
a few little fires

174
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,985
without burning
down all of Colorado.

175
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,487
The idea...

176
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,948
...is to teach
guys to do drops

177
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,617
and set up test areas
to teach pilots

178

how you fly

Al told me about
a training school in Flat Rock, Colorado.

384
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,261
They need
a commanding officer and I was wondering,

385
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,722
why don't I take you
to Colorado and you could be my girl

386
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,184

geeks to fight fires.

You know, till they could
put out a cigar at 200 feet

home every night

I did? What word?

It's what fliers
and piano players

536

They reach for it. They pray for it.

00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:31,983
And often, just when
they need it most, they get it.

00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,486
It's breathed into them.

It's what the word means.
Spiritus.

Inspiration.

541
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,496

And now it's your

That's how
the whole thing works.

That's how the
whole thing works.

545
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,301
So now I'm supposed
to give inspiration to some flyer?

546

Yes, but you're
not going back as a flying instructor.

You've had your life,

I think you're a pretty
silly-looking guy. What do you think of that?

00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:14,354
It has a mind of its own.
A glitch in the transmission.

Yeah.

First thing you have
to know is what type of plane you're flying.

572
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,587
That determines
how many drops you can make.

Yes, I did.

How did you know?

585
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,672
It says here you
got your ticket back

into why you flew 500 kitchen units...

There's a crawly
thing on your face.

Don't you want to
scratch your cheek? Its legs are tickling you.

590
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,646
You mixed up Burbank
with Van Nuys.

591
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,983

It's a little Lyme tick.

They're laying eggs.

You also violated
military air space.

It'll feel good.

we're both making a big mistake.

with Wing 'N' Prayer?

Hi.

1067
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:29,777
Come in.
Thanks.

1068
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:34,532
Holy cow,
look at this.

1069
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,700
Yeah.

1070
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,118
(CHUCKLES)

1071
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,371
You've been busy.
Kind of.

1072
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,331
I had no idea.

1073
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,129
Everything smells great.
Look what you've done.

1074
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:49,964
She can't do toast.

1075
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:53,884
You've got a little
mashed potatoes right...

1076
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:55,761
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

1077
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,515
Oh, look at me.

1078
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,393
Uh, let me go get
myself fixed up.

1079
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,939
There's something
fishy here and it's not the chicken.

1080
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:13,404
Then there was the time
he delivered a PBY to

1081
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,866
to Michigan or Mexico.
Know what a PBY is?

1082
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,868
Ketchup?
Sure.

1083
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:21,120
He's taking off
in this PBY,

1084
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:24,331
which is a feat in itself.
They're amazing planes.

1085
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,709
TED: It's like
a tugboat with wings.

1086
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,253

you every two weeks?

01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:30,963
What was I
talking about?

1088
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:33,132
Pete, still.

1089
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:36,343
So he's flying this PBY
when he sees this fire.

1090
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:37,428
Forest fire.
Uh-uh.

1091
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,680
Main Street.
Village grocery store.

1092
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,057
The nearest fire engine
is 20 miles away.

1093
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:43,434
Oh, you can
pick up the chicken.

1094
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,727
Anything that flies,
it's okay.

1095
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:46,687
Even in a
good restaurant.

1096
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,272
Mmm-hmm.

1097
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:54,320
He sees this building on fire
and outside of town is this reservoir.

1098
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,071
So he...

1099
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:59,742
Fills the plane with water
and dumps it on the fire.

1100
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:03,454
No, he missed!
He hit the post office next door.

1101
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,289
Took him three tries.
(LAUGHS)

1102
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:08,459
The town was awash.
The groceries were burned.

1103
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:11,128
It was fire,
flood and famine. If he'd managed

1104
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:13,214
the plague, it would've
been the Four Horsemen

1105
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,257
of the Apocalypse
in one PBY.

1106
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,177
I mean, he was unique.

1107
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,974
Why are you
plucking your eyebrows?

1108
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:26,560
Oh, I didn't know I was.

1109
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,440

Want to do the wishbone?

1110
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:32,608
Sure.

1111
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,111
Okay, here we go.

1112
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,493
Your wish.

1113
01:24:46,706 --> 01:24:48,749
He was up in that plane,

1114
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:53,879
doing his dumb stunts.

1115
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:59,093
There would be this
tone in his voice.

1116
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,886
I called it his
"Evel Knievel" voice.

1117
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:04,223
I don't know who he was
when he sounded like that.

1118
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:05,975

it was great.

DORINDA: What did
he think I thought?

1120
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,146
Was he dumb
enough to think

1121
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:16,193
I admired him for it?
For flying like that?

1122
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,945
(SIGHS) Okay.

1123
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:19,822

1124
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:21,949
I wasn't there.

1125

talking about this.

1127
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:33,794
It's your birthday?

No, it's yours.

No, it isn't.

1130

this time last year,

1131

it should be
this year, too. No, no.

I saw him land
a plane once. I saw him dance.

1137
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,239
He had his own
way of doing both.

1138
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,741
He could drive an A-26
around the sky.

1139
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,200
He wasn't dumb.

1140
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:09,079
You were impressed that
he brought that A-26 in on an empty tank.

1141

is the only pain that follows us here.

1412
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:15,000
And the memory
of that love

1413
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:18,921
shouldn't make you unhappy
for the rest of your life.

1414
01:51:23,427 --> 01:51:26,846
I hope you can hear me
because I know this is true,

1415
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:33,894
from
the bottom of my heart, how good your life is.

1416
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:37,773
How good it will be.

1417
01:51:42,112 --> 01:51:43,696
Can you hear me?

1418
01:51:47,284 --> 01:51:50,035
Brush your hair
from your face if you can hear me.

1419
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:52,621
Brush your hair
away from your face one more time,

1420
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:56,709
so I can see your eyes
and say "goodbye."

1421
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,055
(ENGINE DYING)

1422
01:52:13,435 --> 01:52:15,227
I'm losing pressure.

1423
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:20,608
Don't worry.
Try to make it to the water.

1424
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:25,446
You can make it.
You can do it.

1425
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:27,865
The water is easy.

1426
01:53:09,616 --> 01:53:11,075
(SPLASHES LOUDLY)

1427
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:34,598
PETE: Dorinda.

1428
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:36,642
Dorinda.

1429
01:53:38,562 --> 01:53:40,312
I'm right over here.

1430
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:45,317
Look at me.

1431
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:09,967
(YELPS)

1432
01:54:14,764 --> 01:54:16,015
Pete!

1433
01:54:50,967 --> 01:54:52,968
There is the rest
of your life.

1434
01:54:53,053 --> 01:54:56,055
I want you to go to them.
I'm releasing you.

1435
01:54:58,516 --> 01:55:00,684
I'm moving out
of your heart.

1436
01:55:03,396 --> 01:55:04,563
Go on.

1437
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,567
Go on.

1438
01:55:50,318 --> 01:55:51,860
That's my girl.

1439
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:57,616
And that's my boy.

1440
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:27,646
