MORGAN: Because he owed me $825.

did you?

someone did.

SLIM: You said go ahead, didn't you?

That's right. I guess I did.
You were pretty good at it, too.

- I'd like to know.

- All right. I won't do it anymore.

- I didn't ask...
- I know you didn't.

Don't worry.
I'm not giving up anything I care about.

It's like shooting fish in a barrel, anyway.

- Time for what?

- I've been mad ever since I met you.
- Most people are.

That didn't work either.

00:56:50,832 --> 00:56:52,151
That's not so bad.

825
00:56:52,232 --> 00:56:54,871
You wouldn't have that
if you weren't so anxious to give up.

826
00:56:54,952 --> 00:56:56,510
HELENE: Please help get him on the seat.

827
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:59,026
Leave him. I don't want him
bleeding over my cushion.

828
00:56:59,112 --> 00:57:01,706
- Here you are, Harry.
- You can have a drink now.

829
00:57:01,872 --> 00:57:03,100
Thanks, Harry.

830
00:57:04,432 --> 00:57:06,104
Help me off with his coat.

831
00:57:07,912 --> 00:57:09,140
Easy now, boy.

832
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:23,665
All right. Get ready.

833
00:57:23,752 --> 00:57:26,061
The man in that boat
will take you on from here.

834
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:27,904
But I don't understand.

835
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:30,586
Some people spent a lot of time
figuring this thing out.

836
00:57:30,672 --> 00:57:32,708
They know more about it than we do.

837
00:57:43,872 --> 00:57:45,191
This is de Bursac.

838
00:57:45,552 --> 00:57:48,464
He's the other guy
I was supposed to pick up. His wife.

839
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:50,429
- My name is Gerard.
- How do you do?

840
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:53,185
- Easy with him. He's been shot up a little.
- What happened?

841
00:57:53,272 --> 00:57:55,911
We ran into a patrol boat.
They'll tell you about it.

842
00:57:58,872 --> 00:58:01,545
I'll cruise around
and give you a chance to get ashore.

843
00:58:01,632 --> 00:58:03,224
MORGAN: Good luck.
GERARD: Thanks.

844
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:18,824
[Slim singing in background]

845
00:58:21,192 --> 00:58:22,910
Good evening, Mama.

846
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,908
- I thought you said she pulled out.
- I thought she did.

847
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:50,306
Hello, Steve.

848
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:52,384
You were going to put her on a plane.

849
00:58:52,472 --> 00:58:55,509
- What's the matter? Didn't it go?
- It went. But I decided not to.

850
00:58:55,592 --> 00:58:58,629
You did? I went to a lot of trouble
to get you out of here.

851
00:58:58,712 --> 00:59:00,509
- That's why I didn't go.
- Yeah.

852
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:04,983
You dames.
A guy goes out and breaks his neck to...

853
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:07,663
I might have expected it.

854
00:59:10,912 --> 00:59:12,265
SLIM: You're not sore, are you?

855
00:59:12,352 --> 00:59:15,424
- It'd be all right...
- I got a refund on that ticket. Here.

856
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:17,582
That's gonna help a lot.
You better hang onto it.

857
00:59:17,672 --> 00:59:19,344
- We can use...
- She'll buy it for you.

858
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:21,423
- Nothing but beer for him.
- I'll remember.

859
00:59:21,512 --> 00:59:23,468
We'll be all right. I've got a job.

860
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:26,783
- Doing what?
- Frenchy seems to think I can sing.

861
00:59:26,992 --> 00:59:28,391
It's his place.

862
00:59:28,552 --> 00:59:30,861
Sometimes you make me so mad I could...

863
00:59:30,952 --> 00:59:32,101
You could do what?

864
00:59:32,192 --> 00:59:33,591
Harry, I need your help.

865
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:35,106
MORGAN: What is it now?

866
00:59:35,952 --> 00:59:37,305
That's all right. Go ahead.

867
00:59:37,392 --> 00:59:39,269
That man is very badly wounded, Harry.

868
00:59:39,352 --> 00:59:42,264
I looked at him. The bullet hit the gunnel,
it was almost spent.

869
00:59:42,352 --> 00:59:44,912
- All you got to do is take it out.
- Could you do it?

870
00:59:45,032 --> 00:59:48,388
Me? I'm hotter than any doctor.
They would have recognized my boat.

871
00:59:48,472 --> 00:59:49,587
They'll be on my tail soon.

872
00:59:49,672 --> 00:59:52,584
- All I got to do is walk out of here.
- You don't have to go out.

873
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,106
- You didn't bring them here?
- In the cellar.

874
00:59:55,632 --> 00:59:58,544
Why didn't you put them
in a goldfish bowl and be done with it?

875
00:59:58,632 --> 01:00:01,988
We had to do something.
They're watching every road out of town.

876
01:00:02,072 --> 01:00:04,222
See what you got yourself into
by sticking around?

877
01:00:04,312 --> 01:00:05,904
SLIM: I'm ready to go any time you are.

878
01:00:05,992 --> 01:00:08,984
- Please, Harry, will you do it?
- Not a chance, Frenchy.

879
01:00:10,112 --> 01:00:12,546
Your bill here at the hotel, being overdue...

880
01:00:12,632 --> 01:00:15,590
amounts to 6,356 francs.

881
01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:17,590
She's right, Eddie.

882
01:00:17,672 --> 01:00:19,628
You really keep the books, don't you?

883
01:00:19,712 --> 01:00:23,546
We'll be glad to dismiss the whole matter
if you will do this for us.

884
01:00:24,752 --> 01:00:26,663
- Throw her bill in, too?
- Sure thing.

885
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:29,630
- All I got to do is take the bullet out...
- That's all.

886
01:00:30,432 --> 01:00:33,663
You almost had me figured right, Mama,
except for one thing.

887
01:00:33,752 --> 01:00:35,105
I'll still owe you that bill.

888
01:00:35,192 --> 01:00:36,830
Up in my room you'll find a medical kit.

889
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:38,948
It's gray, this big,
has the boat's name on it.

890
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:40,863
MORGAN: Bring it to the cellar.
SLIM: Sure.

891
01:00:40,992 --> 01:00:42,983
Here's the key. Bring some hot water, too.

892
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:44,391
This way, Harry.

893
01:00:47,632 --> 01:00:48,621
EDDIE: Can I help?

894
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:51,385
Just stay out of sight.
If you run across the police...

895
01:00:51,472 --> 01:00:54,703
- don't forget what I told you to tell them.
- What was that, Harry?

896
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:57,623
Just stay out of sight, Eddie.

897
01:00:58,192 --> 01:00:59,261
I remember.

898
01:01:23,552 --> 01:01:24,826
What do you want here?

899
01:01:24,912 --> 01:01:27,107
I'll tell you. I was sort of invited.
He asked me.

900
01:01:27,192 --> 01:01:28,466
- You're not a doctor.
- No.

901
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:30,270
- Where's the doctor?
- Please, be patient.

902
01:01:30,352 --> 01:01:32,627
I have been patient.
How do I know you know anything?

903
01:01:32,712 --> 01:01:34,748
- You don't.
- Wait a minute.

904
01:01:50,072 --> 01:01:51,824
How long has he been unconscious?

905
01:01:51,912 --> 01:01:53,311
Just a few minutes.

906
01:02:05,752 --> 01:02:08,186
He's got some fever
and his pulse is a little low.

907
01:02:08,272 --> 01:02:10,263
He'll be all right
when we get the bullet out.

908
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:13,310
- Don't touch him. Do you hear?
- That's okay. I'm not getting paid.

909
01:02:13,392 --> 01:02:15,701
She doesn't know what she's saying.
She's not herself.

910
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:18,067
- Who is she?
- Harry, you promised.

911
01:02:19,032 --> 01:02:21,990
You want to help your husband, don't you?
Then use your head.

912
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,302
We can't get a doctor
without giving the show away.

913
01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:26,952
Besides, he's got as good a chance
with me as anybody.

914
01:02:27,032 --> 01:02:28,465
I'm not going to let you do it.

915
01:02:28,552 --> 01:02:30,463
Why not?
He's no different from anybody else.

916
01:02:30,552 --> 01:02:34,101
Just a little sicker, that's all.
It means he's not worth so much.

917
01:02:38,272 --> 01:02:40,069
You can have another crack at me later on.

918
01:02:40,152 --> 01:02:41,505
- Hello, Slim.
- Hello.

919
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,025
Miss Browning, <i>Madame</i> de Bursac.

920
01:02:43,112 --> 01:02:45,626
Don't get tough with Slim.
She's apt to slap you back.

921
01:02:45,712 --> 01:02:47,987
<i>That's what you said you'd do, wasn't it?</i>

922
01:02:48,192 --> 01:02:49,784
Bring the water in here.

923
01:02:49,952 --> 01:02:51,908
- Wait a minute...
- He's trying to help you.

924
01:02:51,992 --> 01:02:54,904
- Who are you?
- Nobody. Just another volunteer.

925
01:02:58,272 --> 01:03:00,786
SLIM: Where do you want this water?
MORGAN: In that basin.

926
01:03:01,712 --> 01:03:03,111
MORGAN: Is it hot?
SLIM: Boiling.

927
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:08,543
All right, then.
Pour some of this in it. And drop these in.

928
01:03:11,472 --> 01:03:14,623
- Get out of here. You may not like this.
- I'll be all right.

929
01:03:16,312 --> 01:03:17,540
MORGAN: Then take this.

930
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:20,030
- What is it?
- Chloroform.

931
01:03:20,112 --> 01:03:22,910
Get over by his head.
If he comes to while I'm probing...

932
01:03:22,992 --> 01:03:26,109
pour some of it on a hunk of cotton
and give him a whiff of it.

933
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:28,663
Don't open it till I tell you to.

934
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,869
Take out about four of those.

935
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:39,628
MORGAN: Bring that lamp a little closer
so I can see what I'm doing.

936
01:03:47,632 --> 01:03:48,747
That's good.

937
01:03:52,512 --> 01:03:54,070
All right, Slim.

938
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,384
Hold that a minute.

939
01:04:06,272 --> 01:04:07,500
Easy, boy.

940
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:10,462
<i>All right, open that can</i>
<i>and give him some.</i>

941
01:04:10,552 --> 01:04:13,112
<i>George, see if you can hold his head down.</i>

942
01:04:13,272 --> 01:04:14,591
Come on, hurry up.

943
01:04:16,632 --> 01:04:19,863
That's fine. Don't worry about her.
Pick up that can.

944
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:24,182
- Any of it left?
- I think there's enough.

945
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:31,263
Wait a minute, I don't think we'll need it.
He's out, too.

946
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:34,468
Bring that lamp down a little lower.

947
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,988
Frenchy, bring that basin over here.

948
01:04:41,392 --> 01:04:44,782
And fan some of those fumes away,
will you, or we'll all be out.

949
01:04:58,992 --> 01:05:01,745
There you are, Frenchy, there's your bullet.

950
01:05:02,472 --> 01:05:05,111
I told you it was spent.
It would have smashed the bone.

951
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,023
All right, I don't need that.

952
01:05:21,592 --> 01:05:24,948
All right, you finish bandaging it up.
Adhesive tape in the box.

953
01:05:25,432 --> 01:05:28,549
I got to get nursie out of here,
or she never will come to.

954
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:43,021
What are you trying to do,
guess her weight?

955
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,269
She's heftier than you think.

956
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:54,388
- You'd better loosen her clothes.
- You've been doing all right.

957
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,301
Maybe you'd better
look after her husband.

958
01:06:00,512 --> 01:06:03,106
- He's not gonna run out on me.
- Neither is she.

959
01:06:09,272 --> 01:06:12,309
Is it all right
if I give her a little whiff of this?

960
01:06:24,032 --> 01:06:26,023
[Paul mumbling]

961
01:06:28,512 --> 01:06:30,230
You're with us again.

962
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,228
You were lucky. You passed out.

963
01:06:34,672 --> 01:06:36,549
What happened? We must...

964
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:40,466
We'll talk about that in the morning.
See if you can get some sleep.

965
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:42,661
Thanks.

966
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:02,310
Why did you ever come along with him
on a trip like this?

967
01:07:02,392 --> 01:07:06,101
I love him. I want to be with him.

968
01:07:07,552 --> 01:07:10,624
MORGAN: That's a reason.
HELENE: There's another reason.

969
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:13,947
<i>They told me to come, our people did.</i>

970
01:07:17,312 --> 01:07:21,385
They said no man was much good
if he left someone behind in France...

971
01:07:21,472 --> 01:07:23,747
for the Germans to find and hold.

972
01:07:25,912 --> 01:07:29,427
- That makes sense.
- I told them I'd only be in the way...

973
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:32,584
that I could do no good, that I was afraid.

974
01:07:35,112 --> 01:07:38,900
But the worst of it is that it's been so hard
for him to have me along...

975
01:07:40,952 --> 01:07:44,740
because I've made him that way, too.
Now he's afraid.

976
01:07:47,712 --> 01:07:49,430
He didn't invent it.

977
01:07:50,072 --> 01:07:52,108
HELENE: Invent what?
MORGAN: Being afraid.

978
01:07:55,152 --> 01:07:56,551
Thanks, Mr. Morgan.

979
01:08:13,272 --> 01:08:14,830
The fever's gone.

980
01:08:16,912 --> 01:08:18,903
Do you...

981
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:21,746
I'm no doctor,
but he looks pretty good to me.

982
01:08:23,832 --> 01:08:26,585
If he wakes up,
give him another one of these pills.

983
01:08:41,032 --> 01:08:44,547
HELENE: Mr. Morgan, I...
MORGAN: You're not gonna faint again?

984
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:49,903
No, I'm just having a hard time
trying to say something.

985
01:08:50,032 --> 01:08:52,387
Go ahead, say it. I'm not gonna bite you.

986
01:08:53,552 --> 01:08:56,066
If it hadn't been for you,
Paul might have...

987
01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:59,150
I'm sorry for the way I've acted.

988
01:08:59,232 --> 01:09:02,907
You're not sorry at all, you're just sorry
you made a fool of yourself.

989
01:09:03,792 --> 01:09:05,111
I have, haven't I?

990
01:09:08,832 --> 01:09:11,187
You don't make me angry
when you say that.

991
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:15,183
I don't think I'll ever be angry again
with anything you say.

992
01:09:16,192 --> 01:09:18,342
Another screwy dame.
Now, how can you...

993
01:09:18,432 --> 01:09:22,220
Good morning. I hate to break this up,
but I've brought some breakfast.

994
01:09:24,232 --> 01:09:26,143
HELENE: Morning.
SLIM: How's your patient?

995
01:09:26,232 --> 01:09:28,951
MORGAN: He'll be...
SLIM: Or haven't you looked lately?

996
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:32,308
He'll be all right. I'll be back this evening.

997
01:09:32,872 --> 01:09:35,340
- Lf you need me before then, call me.
- I will.

998
01:09:35,432 --> 01:09:37,787
Yes, and I hope you have everything
you need here.

999
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:39,464
The eggs may be a little hardboiled...

1000
01:09:39,552 --> 01:09:42,988
- That's all right, I like them that way.
- You're lucky. Isn't she?

1001
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:51,620
I'm gonna get some sleep,
I'll see you later.

1002
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:56,941
Thanks.

1003
01:09:58,272 --> 01:10:00,866
- What do you want?
- I could use a match.

1004
01:10:09,432 --> 01:10:12,310
Thanks. Now I need a cigarette.

1005
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:25,944
Here, I can do that. Come on, let me help.

1006
01:10:26,032 --> 01:10:29,388
When I get ready to take my shoes off,
I'll take them off myself.

1007
01:10:30,672 --> 01:10:31,787
All right.

1008
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:35,148
- Want something to eat?
- No.

1009
01:10:36,112 --> 01:10:39,309
- Just a little breakfast?
- All I want to do is get some sleep.

1010
01:10:39,392 --> 01:10:42,065
It's a good idea. I can help you there.

1011
01:10:42,992 --> 01:10:46,667
- Now where are you going?
- I'm going to fix you a nice hot bath.

1012
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:48,784
It'll make you sleep better.

1013
01:10:48,872 --> 01:10:52,421
I don't want you to take my shoes off,
I don't want you to get me breakfast...

1014
01:10:52,512 --> 01:10:54,389
I don't want you to draw me a hot bath...

1015
01:10:54,472 --> 01:10:57,430
- I don't want you to...
- Isn't there anything I can do, Steve?

1016
01:10:57,512 --> 01:10:59,946
MORGAN: Yes, get the...
SLIM: You know, Mr. Morgan...

1017
01:11:00,032 --> 01:11:02,500
you don't make me angry
when you say that.

1018
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:06,141
I don't think I'll ever be angry again
at anything you say.

1019
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,426
How am I doing, Steve,
does it work the second time?

1020
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:15,470
You've been wanting
to do something for me, haven't you?

1021
01:11:21,552 --> 01:11:23,031
Walk around me.

1022
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:26,067
Go ahead, walk around me, clear around.

1023
01:11:37,552 --> 01:11:39,543
- Did you find anything?
- No.

1024
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:45,063
No, Steve.
There are no strings tied to you, not yet.

1025
01:11:59,432 --> 01:12:00,626
I like that...

1026
01:12:04,872 --> 01:12:06,351
except for the beard.

1027
01:12:07,992 --> 01:12:09,744
Why don't you shave...

1028
01:12:12,032 --> 01:12:13,511
and we'll try it again.

[Knocking on door]

1030
01:12:18,992 --> 01:12:20,744
- Later, Frenchy.
- Harry, wait.

1031
01:12:20,832 --> 01:12:23,471
Renard, the Inspector, is downstairs.
You better come down.

1032
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:26,146
- I can't do that, I got to shave.
- He's got Eddie.

1033
01:12:27,352 --> 01:12:29,627
He's giving him drinks
and asking him questions.

1034
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,350
I was afraid of that.

1035
01:12:32,392 --> 01:12:34,223
Good thing you didn't get me in that tub.

1036
01:12:34,312 --> 01:12:38,021
Look out for those strings, Steve.
You're liable to trip and break your neck.

1037
01:12:38,112 --> 01:12:41,787
- Strings? I didn't see any strings.
- They just don't show, Frenchy.

1038
01:12:44,632 --> 01:12:46,065
You ought to have seen that fish.

1039
01:12:46,152 --> 01:12:48,222
It must have weighed 900
if it weighed a pound.

1040
01:12:48,312 --> 01:12:51,031
It was the biggest marlin you ever seen
in all your born days.

1041
01:12:51,112 --> 01:12:52,704
You know, a marlin is a swordfish.

1042
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:55,670
- Good morning, <i>Capitaine.</i>
- Hello, Harry. How's everything?

1043
01:12:55,752 --> 01:12:57,265
- Fine.
- Won't you join us?

1044
01:12:57,352 --> 01:12:59,547
It's a little early for this kind of a party.

1045
01:12:59,632 --> 01:13:00,701
Continue, Mr. Eddie.

1046
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:02,623
Did you hear that? He called me mister.

1047
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,304
Say, you're all right.

1048
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:07,471
- Was you ever bit by a...
- No, he never was, Eddie.

1049
01:13:07,552 --> 01:13:09,144
Go on with what you were saying.

1050
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:12,622
I was just telling him about the big one
we hooked onto last night.

1051
01:13:12,712 --> 01:13:16,148
Sir, that fish was so big
that me and Harry could hardly budge him.

1052
01:13:16,232 --> 01:13:18,792
We pumped on him
until we was all wore out, didn't we?

1053
01:13:18,872 --> 01:13:20,305
MORGAN: That's right, Eddie.

1054
01:13:20,592 --> 01:13:23,026
It was after dark
and we was still playing him.

1055
01:13:23,112 --> 01:13:27,151
He must have weighed
at least 1,000 easy.

1056
01:13:28,312 --> 01:13:32,146
Every time Mr. Eddie takes a drink,
this fabulous fish grows larger.

1057
01:13:32,312 --> 01:13:34,780
He must have started
with a pretty small one.

1058
01:13:35,672 --> 01:13:37,981
How did you finally manage
to land such a leviathan?

1059
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:39,630
We didn't, didn't he tell you?

1060
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:42,226
- We ran into a German submarine.
- A German submarine?

1061
01:13:42,312 --> 01:13:44,621
Whatever it was,
it turned its light on and fired.

1062
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,589
- I didn't wait to find out.
- I do not think...

1063
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,867
You know,
you can't be too careful these days.

1064
01:13:48,952 --> 01:13:51,830
I do not think anybody
could give a more logical explanation...

1065
01:13:51,912 --> 01:13:55,029
for refusing to obey the challenge
of our patrol boat.

1066
01:13:55,512 --> 01:13:57,901
Not to speak of shooting out
their searchlight.

1067
01:13:57,992 --> 01:13:59,186
- Patrol boat?
- Yes.

1068
01:13:59,272 --> 01:14:00,944
That's what it was. You were right, Eddie.

1069
01:14:01,032 --> 01:14:02,943
EDDIE: I'm a good man in the dark,
always was.

1070
01:14:03,032 --> 01:14:06,229
Funny, he kept saying it was a patrol boat,
but I wouldn't believe him.

1071
01:14:06,312 --> 01:14:09,429
COYO: There is one thing that is not clear
to me, Capt. Morgan.

1072
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:10,827
What's that?

1073
01:14:10,912 --> 01:14:14,382
COYO: Why does a professional fisherman
go fishing for his own amusement?

1074
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:19,503
Don't you ever ask any questions?
Don't you ever talk?

1075
01:14:20,912 --> 01:14:23,221
No, I guess you don't.
What were you saying?

1076
01:14:23,312 --> 01:14:27,191
COYO: Does a professional fisherman
go fishing for his own amusement?

1077
01:14:27,792 --> 01:14:29,942
He does if he likes it, and we do, don't we?

1078
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,988
Yeah, remember in Key West
when we went...

1079
01:14:32,072 --> 01:14:35,621
- We don't seem to be getting anywhere.
- It was the Fourth of July...

1080
01:14:35,712 --> 01:14:37,942
I was just saying,
Key West, the Fourth of July...

1081
01:14:38,032 --> 01:14:39,829
three years ago at 8:00. I got that in.

1082
01:14:39,912 --> 01:14:42,028
RENARD: What about your passengers?
MORGAN: 7:00.

1083
01:14:42,112 --> 01:14:44,421
<i>You oughtn't to burn up at him,</i>
<i>you fed him the rum.</i>

1084
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:47,026
RENARD: And your two passengers?
MORGAN: What passengers?

1085
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:48,864
The ones you brought from Anguilla.

1086
01:14:48,952 --> 01:14:51,102
He was waiting on the dock
when we came in.

1087
01:14:51,192 --> 01:14:52,944
You think I got them ashore in my sleeve?

1088
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:55,626
You could have landed them anywhere
on our coastline.

1089
01:14:55,712 --> 01:14:57,065
Right, I could've at that.

1090
01:14:57,152 --> 01:15:00,667
- Would $500 refresh your memory?
- My memory's pretty good.

1091
01:15:01,112 --> 01:15:04,149
I remember that you're the guy
who lifted my passport and my money.

1092
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:07,827
Would your memory become any better if
your passport and money were returned?

1093
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:10,221
Does that include the $825
Johnson owed me?

1094
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:12,820
- Why not?
- And the $500 you just mentioned?

1095
01:15:13,312 --> 01:15:15,542
You drive a hard bargain,
<i>Capitaine</i> Morgan.

1096
01:15:15,632 --> 01:15:18,351
That's no bargain.
If these people are so important...

1097
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:22,220
- they're gonna be pretty hard to find.
- Not for a man of your resourcefulness.

1098
01:15:22,312 --> 01:15:24,621
Think it over and let me hear from you.

1099
01:15:36,192 --> 01:15:38,262
- Did you hear all of that?
- Most of it.

When he cools off, though,
he's gonna start thinking.

He thinks now that you will turn them in.

1103
01:15:45,192 --> 01:15:48,389
- Isn't that what you want him to think?
- What will happen then?

1104
01:15:48,472 --> 01:15:50,747
- He hasn't searched this hotel yet, has he?
- Not yet.

1105

There's your answer.

1106

He doesn't want them,
but the whole setup.

- What shall we do?
- It's not we, it's you.

You can't do anything until that fella
gets strong enough to move.

1109

Until then, you're probably safe.

but they was trying to get me drunk.

- I'll be all right.

- Yeah, Harry?

Keep out of sight
and stay away from the police.

that story you told a second time.

01:19:52,192 --> 01:19:54,228
- I'll be right back.
- Give her my love.

1144
01:19:54,312 --> 01:19:56,542
I'd give her my own if she had that on.

1145
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:59,552
Here's the rest of the lyrics, Slim.
How do you feel?

1146
01:19:59,632 --> 01:20:02,385
- I could use a drink, Cricket.
- Sure, come on.

1147
01:20:04,272 --> 01:20:06,866
- What will you have, Slim?
- Scotch and soda.

1148
01:20:07,312 --> 01:20:08,347
CRICKET: Same.

1149
01:20:18,872 --> 01:20:20,988
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Capt. Morgan.

1150
01:20:21,072 --> 01:20:23,745
- How are you feeling?
- Much better. I'm very grateful to you.

1151
01:20:23,832 --> 01:20:26,221
Forget it. Let me have a look at this.

1152
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:30,670
MORGAN: There's no bleeding.
PAUL: No.

1153
01:20:32,192 --> 01:20:33,944
- Does that hurt?
- Very little.

1154
01:20:34,032 --> 01:20:37,183
My only trouble is when I'm eating.
I'm awkward with my left hand.

1155
01:20:37,272 --> 01:20:40,981
We'll see if we can have you shot
in the other arm next time.

1156
01:20:41,072 --> 01:20:42,824
You won't need me anymore.

1157
01:20:44,232 --> 01:20:45,506
Frenchy, I'm pulling out.

1158
01:20:45,592 --> 01:20:46,945
- When?
- Soon as I find Eddie.

1159
01:20:47,032 --> 01:20:48,511
- Is your friend missing?
- Yeah.

1160
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:49,581
What happened?

1161
01:20:49,672 --> 01:20:51,867
I don't know,
he left the dock and hasn't been back.

1162
01:20:51,952 --> 01:20:54,750
- Usually does what I tell him.
- I'm sorry if anything happened.

1163
01:20:54,832 --> 01:20:57,710
- I won't know until I find him.
- Couldn't you leave him here?

1164
01:20:57,792 --> 01:20:59,544
I don't think Eddie would like that.

1165
01:20:59,632 --> 01:21:01,190
Frenchy, as soon as I'm gone...

1166
01:21:01,272 --> 01:21:03,581
Renard will move in
and turn this place upside down...

1167
01:21:03,672 --> 01:21:06,789
so you better start figuring
how and where you're gonna move him.

1168
01:21:06,872 --> 01:21:10,262
- Wouldn't it be best if we went with you?
- Why do you want to go?

1169
01:21:10,352 --> 01:21:14,027
I'm still trying to get out of the jam
I got into bringing you here.

1170
01:21:14,112 --> 01:21:15,784
Why'd you come here in the first place?

1171
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:18,670
I know why she came, she told me,
but why did you?

1172
01:21:18,752 --> 01:21:20,549
Have you heard of Pierre Villemars?

1173
01:21:20,632 --> 01:21:24,386
Pierre Villemars? Yeah, I read a headline.
He was quite a guy.

1174
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,822
- Vichy got him. He's dead, isn't he?
- No.

1175
01:21:26,912 --> 01:21:29,585
He's on Devil's Island.
They sent me here to get him...

1176
01:21:29,672 --> 01:21:31,503
to bring him back here to Martinique.

1177
01:21:31,592 --> 01:21:34,390
He's a man whom people
who are persecuted and oppressed...

1178
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:36,190
will believe in and follow.

1179
01:21:38,552 --> 01:21:40,861
Just how are you gonna get him away?

1180
01:21:41,792 --> 01:21:44,147
You don't think much of me,
Capt. Morgan.

1181
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:47,542
You're wondering why they've chosen me
for this mission.

1182
01:21:47,632 --> 01:21:48,951
I wonder, too.

1183
01:21:49,352 --> 01:21:51,912
As you know, I'm not a brave man.

1184
01:21:53,672 --> 01:21:56,061
On the contrary, I'm always frightened.

1185
01:21:57,352 --> 01:22:00,071
I wish I could borrow your nature
for a while, Captain.

1186
01:22:00,152 --> 01:22:02,382
<i>When you meet danger,</i>
<i>you never think of anything...</i>

1187
01:22:02,472 --> 01:22:04,508
<i>except how you will circumvent it.</i>

1188
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:08,182
The word failure
does not even exist for you, while I...

1189
01:22:10,352 --> 01:22:13,264
I think always, "Suppose I fail"...

1190
01:22:14,392 --> 01:22:16,064
and then I am frightened.

1191
01:22:16,312 --> 01:22:19,270
Yeah, I can easily see how
it wouldn't take much courage...

1192
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,627
to get a notorious patriot
off Devil's Island.

1193
01:22:21,712 --> 01:22:26,069
But just for professional reasons,
I'd like to know how you're gonna do it.

1194
01:22:26,152 --> 01:22:27,710
We will find a way.

1195
01:22:28,032 --> 01:22:30,785
It might fail, and if it does...

1196
01:22:30,992 --> 01:22:34,109
and I am still alive...

1197
01:22:35,192 --> 01:22:38,628
I will try to pass on my information,
my mission, to someone else.

1198
01:22:39,152 --> 01:22:41,586
Perhaps to a better man,
who does not fail.

1199
01:22:41,872 --> 01:22:44,147
Because there is always someone else.

1200
01:22:45,912 --> 01:22:48,107
That is the mistake
the Germans always make...

1201
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,148
with people they try to destroy.

1202
01:22:51,192 --> 01:22:53,945
There will be always someone else.

1203
01:22:56,752 --> 01:22:59,266
Originally, we planned
to do everything from here.

1204
01:22:59,352 --> 01:23:02,583
But then, because of my own clumsiness,
it was impossible.

1205
01:23:03,192 --> 01:23:05,660
And that's the reason
we have to go with you.

1206
01:23:05,992 --> 01:23:08,870
I couldn't get you on the dock,
there's a man there watching...

1207
01:23:08,952 --> 01:23:11,022
there's one upstairs, they're everywhere.

1208
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:14,104
- How would I get you through the streets?
- How will you go?

1209
01:23:14,192 --> 01:23:15,784
They're watching me to find you.

1210
01:23:15,872 --> 01:23:19,023
As long as I haven't got you along,
I can at least get on the boat.

1211
01:23:19,112 --> 01:23:21,831
There'll be a fog,
and the tide will turn after midnight.

1212
01:23:21,912 --> 01:23:24,187
I can cut loose,
drift out beyond the breakwater...

1213
01:23:24,272 --> 01:23:25,910
before I start my engines.

1214
01:23:26,672 --> 01:23:28,867
I'll still have trouble enough,
even without you.

1215
01:23:28,952 --> 01:23:31,102
- But, Harry...
- Capt. Morgan is right.

1216
01:23:32,792 --> 01:23:34,589
This is not his fight yet.

1217
01:23:35,312 --> 01:23:39,624
Some day I hope it may be,
because we could use him.

1218
01:23:41,112 --> 01:23:42,943
You have done enough for us already.

1219
01:23:43,032 --> 01:23:46,627
Gerard told me of your refusing
Renard's offer to give us up.

1220
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:49,662
How do you know I won't do it yet?

1221
01:23:50,112 --> 01:23:52,467
There are many things a man will do...

1222
01:23:52,792 --> 01:23:57,104
but betrayal for a price is not one of yours.

1223
01:23:59,912 --> 01:24:01,186
Good luck.

1224
01:24:02,232 --> 01:24:04,382
- I hope you find your friend.
- Thanks.

1225
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,110
Goodbye, and thanks.

1226
01:24:11,032 --> 01:24:13,944
Frenchy, I got a few things
to talk to you about before I blow.

1227
01:24:14,032 --> 01:24:16,387
Then I'll be up in a little while, Harry.

1228
01:24:20,632 --> 01:24:21,985
Any sign of Eddie?

1229
01:24:22,832 --> 01:24:25,790
- Your friend's still sitting at his table.
- I know.

1230
01:24:25,872 --> 01:24:28,432
- What's the matter, Steve?
- I don't know.

1231
01:24:28,512 --> 01:24:30,946
I think the whole thing's gonna blow up,
it's too quiet.

1232
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,148
- What will you do?
- We'll leave tonight...

1233
01:24:33,232 --> 01:24:34,790
as soon as I find Eddie.

1234
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:37,989
We're leaving here for good,
the three of us.

1235
01:24:38,872 --> 01:24:41,067
Wait, I want you to know
what you're getting into.

1236
01:24:41,152 --> 01:24:43,143
It'll be rough, I'm broke. If we get out...

1237
01:24:43,232 --> 01:24:45,746
it'll be with a few hundred gallons of gas
and a few francs.

1238
01:24:45,832 --> 01:24:48,062
Just enough to get us
to Port-au-Prince maybe.

1239
01:24:48,152 --> 01:24:49,665
I've never been there.

1240
01:24:50,152 --> 01:24:53,508
I don't know when you'll get back home.
It could be a long time.

1241
01:24:53,832 --> 01:24:56,426
It could be forever,
or are you afraid of that?

1242
01:24:57,152 --> 01:25:00,588
I'm hard to get, Steve.
All you have to do is ask me.

1243
01:25:01,832 --> 01:25:03,948
How long will it take you to pack?

1244
01:25:05,032 --> 01:25:07,865
There's a lot of people around here,
save it.

- All set, Slim?
- Sure, but don't make it sad, Cricket.

1248
01:25:21,632 --> 01:25:24,749
- I don't feel that way.
- You don't look that way, either. Let's go.

Why did you...

1254
01:27:11,032 --> 01:27:13,307
Please, Harry, that's all I will ask.

1255
01:27:14,512 --> 01:27:15,911
Thanks, Harry.

1256
01:27:20,352 --> 01:27:22,422
You shouldn't have come, it's too risky.

1257
01:27:22,512 --> 01:27:23,627
I told you I can't take you.

1258
01:27:23,712 --> 01:27:27,307
I didn't come up for that.
You've already done too much for us...

1259

but there's just one other favor
I'd like to ask.

1260
01:27:29,952 --> 01:27:31,704

If you will not give us
the information we want, perhaps he will.

Before we made the mistake
of giving him liquor...

01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:59,182
And me a lot of time,
if you will tell us where these people are.

1303
01:30:06,232 --> 01:30:08,029
How much were you going to give me?

1304
01:30:08,112 --> 01:30:09,670
More than what's mine already?

1305
01:30:09,752 --> 01:30:13,188
I do not think now
I will have to pay anybody anything.

1306
01:30:16,592 --> 01:30:18,105
You're probably right.

1307
01:30:20,272 --> 01:30:22,467
MORGAN: I haven't got a match.
GUARD: Don't go...

1308
01:30:24,072 --> 01:30:26,381
All right, go on, get them up. Go on.

1309
01:30:27,232 --> 01:30:29,427
Pull your guns, go ahead.

1310
01:30:29,512 --> 01:30:32,151
Get them out. Go ahead and try it!

1311
01:30:34,632 --> 01:30:36,623
- You're gonna get it, anyway.
- Don't.

1312
01:30:36,712 --> 01:30:38,589
You've been pushing me around
long enough.

1313
01:30:38,672 --> 01:30:42,108
You were gonna drive Eddie nuts.
Picking on a poor old rummy that never...

1314
01:30:42,192 --> 01:30:44,786
Slapping girls around.
That's right, go for it!

1315
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:47,463
Your boy needs company.

1316
01:30:54,792 --> 01:30:58,182
Look at that, ain't that silly?

1317
01:31:01,072 --> 01:31:03,028
That's how close you came.

1318
01:31:04,472 --> 01:31:06,542
<i>All right, Frenchy, get their guns.</i>

1319
01:31:17,512 --> 01:31:18,911
Here you are.

1320
01:31:24,432 --> 01:31:27,230
<i>Now get over on that couch.</i>
<i>Go ahead, step over him.</i>

1321
01:31:30,872 --> 01:31:32,066
<i>Sit down.</i>

1322
01:31:35,632 --> 01:31:37,429
All right, come on out.

1323
01:31:40,312 --> 01:31:42,542
That's one of them,
the other one's in the cellar.

1324
01:31:42,632 --> 01:31:44,145
Take her down, get some help.

1325
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:46,792
Have them ready to leave on the boat,
then come back here.

1326
01:31:46,872 --> 01:31:49,102
Slim, you pack.
We'll leave as soon as we get Eddie.

1327
01:31:49,192 --> 01:31:50,181
Okay, Steve.

1328
01:31:50,272 --> 01:31:52,183
- Just how do you think you...
- Shut up.

1329
01:31:52,272 --> 01:31:55,025
You want to know
how I'm gonna get him out?

1330
01:31:55,672 --> 01:31:57,902
That broke as easy as you will.

1331
01:31:57,992 --> 01:31:59,345
There's a phone in the hall.

1332
01:31:59,432 --> 01:32:01,900
You're gonna tell someone to let him go,
send him here.

1333
01:32:01,992 --> 01:32:03,903
<i>Yes, you are, one of you.</i>

1334
01:32:06,192 --> 01:32:08,069
<i>I haven't forgotten you.</i>

1335
01:32:09,952 --> 01:32:12,420
You'll both take a beating
till someone uses that phone.

1336
01:32:12,512 --> 01:32:14,707
So one of you
is gonna take a beating for nothing.

1337
01:32:14,792 --> 01:32:18,501
I don't care which one it is.
I'll start with you.

1338
01:32:20,512 --> 01:32:22,867
You will release him immediately.

1339
01:32:24,632 --> 01:32:28,181
- Tell him you'll explain later.
- I will explain it later.

1340
01:32:28,552 --> 01:32:32,147
Tell him to send him back to the hotel
and do nothing else till you get there.

1341
01:32:32,232 --> 01:32:36,305
Send him back here to the hotel
and do nothing until you hear from us.

1342
01:32:39,912 --> 01:32:43,143
All right, inside.
You've got some harbor passes to fill out.

1343
01:32:46,232 --> 01:32:48,587
And now Paul and <i>Madame</i> de Bursac.

1344
01:32:51,872 --> 01:32:53,828
I'll be right with you, Frenchy.

1345
01:33:03,512 --> 01:33:05,901
- They're all yours now.
- Thanks, Mr. Morgan.

1346
01:33:07,112 --> 01:33:08,306
They are all ready.

1347
01:33:08,392 --> 01:33:10,462
These will get them past the guard
and on the boat.

1348
01:33:10,552 --> 01:33:12,065
Where will you take them?

1349
01:33:12,152 --> 01:33:13,744
- Maybe Devil's Island.
- What?

1350
01:33:13,832 --> 01:33:16,392
Might even get Villemars off,
wasn't that what you wanted?

1351
01:33:16,472 --> 01:33:19,509
Very much. Why are you doing this, Harry?

1352
01:33:21,112 --> 01:33:22,511
I don't know.

1353
01:33:22,992 --> 01:33:26,029
Maybe because I like you,
maybe because I don't like them.

1354
01:33:26,112 --> 01:33:28,467
I'm glad you are on our side, Harry.

1355
01:33:28,552 --> 01:33:30,224
No kissing, Frenchy.

1356
01:33:31,032 --> 01:33:34,547
- You'll have to take care of those guys.
- We will give you plenty of time.

1357
01:33:34,632 --> 01:33:37,271
If you let them go,
they'll come back and burn this place.

1358
01:33:37,352 --> 01:33:39,388
Let them, it will be a very small fire.

1359
01:33:39,472 --> 01:33:43,465
When Villemars comes back,
it'll be our turn. We'll start a bigger one.

1360
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,985
Meet you on the boat.

1361
01:33:46,072 --> 01:33:47,630
GUARD 2: One minute, please.

1362
01:33:47,712 --> 01:33:49,748
MORGAN: That's all right, let him through.

1363
01:33:52,952 --> 01:33:55,750
- How are you, Harry? How's everything?
- It's all right now.

1364
01:33:55,832 --> 01:33:58,392
You look glad to see me.
You know a funny thing...

1365
01:33:58,872 --> 01:34:01,306
Don't know what they wanted,
but they wouldn't give me...

1366
01:34:01,392 --> 01:34:04,384
I'll get you one down on the boat.
We're leaving, Eddie.

1367
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,190
MORGAN: Ready, Slim?
SLIM: In a minute.

1368
01:34:06,272 --> 01:34:07,671
<i>Close that, will you?</i>

1369
01:34:07,752 --> 01:34:11,028
- Say, what is this, is she going with us?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

1370
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:13,182
Harry, you mean... What's she got...

1371
01:34:13,752 --> 01:34:16,903
- Who are you?
- Was you ever bit by a dead bee?

1372
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:19,346
- Was you?
- Yeah.

1373
01:34:19,432 --> 01:34:21,229
You got to be careful of dead bees.

1374
01:34:21,312 --> 01:34:23,223
They can sting you just as bad
as live ones.

1375
01:34:23,312 --> 01:34:25,951
Especially if they was kind of mad
when they got killed.

1376
01:34:26,032 --> 01:34:27,829
I feel like I was talking to myself.

1377
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:30,346
I bet I've been bit 100 times that way.

1378
01:34:31,272 --> 01:34:35,026
- Why don't you bite them back?
- I would. Only I haven't got a stinger.

1379
01:34:36,912 --> 01:34:40,348
I remember you. You're all right.
She can come, it's okay with me.

1380
01:34:40,432 --> 01:34:42,070
I'll have both of you to take care of.

1381
01:34:42,152 --> 01:34:45,110
That's right, Eddie.
You can begin by grabbing these bags.

1382
01:34:45,192 --> 01:34:46,591
Come on, Slim.

Do I have time to say goodbye to Cricket?

1385
01:35:07,072 --> 01:35:08,425
Sure, go ahead.

1386
01:35:16,312 --> 01:35:17,825
- I came to say goodbye.
- What?

1387
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:20,506
We're leaving now. Thanks for everything.

1388
