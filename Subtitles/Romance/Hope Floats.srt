Oh, God.

1181
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:25,463
I know it's so easy
to blame him.

1182
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:29,634
But you know what?
I think it's me.

1183
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,427
I do.

1184
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:36,975
Because he used to look at me
and l used to see myself in his eyes.

1185
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,644
And it was like he saw me.

1186
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,939
And l was audacious, Mama.

1187
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:44,732
I was.

1188
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:49,654
And then, l don't know,
things just started to change.

1189
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:52,991
The harder l tried to be
what he wanted me to be...

1190
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,327
...the less I saw myself in his eyes.

1191
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:00,957
Just one day,
I looked and I was gone.

1192
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,588
I still see her.
No, Mom. No.

1193
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,591
No. It's happening with Bernice too.

1194
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,759
It's happening with Bernice.

1195
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:15,138
She doesn't even look at me
the same way.

1196
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:18,850
It's like there's a wall between us.

1197
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:21,311
There's a wall and it's killing me.

1198
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:24,939
Because the one thing that l said,
when l would grow up...

1199
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:30,153
...if I ever had a daughter of my own,
she would know her mother loved her.

1200
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:33,489
I would hug her
and l would tell her nice things.

1201
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:37,285
And l wouldn't just let the daddy
do all the hugging.

1202
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:51,257
And now I realize that--

1203
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:54,177
I realize that it doesn't matter...

1204
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:57,221
...who or what or when...

1205
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:01,059
...or where the hugging happens.

1206
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,061
Sometimes you just need a hug.

1207

1266
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:20,670
One day, we were playing out back,
down by the river...

1267
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:26,467

I yelled for my mama.
I ran up and I grabbed her...

...and dragged her down there,
just crying and carrying on.

calm me down, so she said:

"Wait, wait. They're not finished.
Not by a long shot."

and sure enough...

I'd just give up. I mean, it's hopeless."

1279

And my mama said, "Yeah, you know,
if there's just one of you.

1280
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,476
But there's lots of ants down there.

I never said any different.

1513
01:49:30,147 --> 01:49:32,190
You sacrifice

1514
01:49:32,483 --> 01:49:36,110
BERNICE: My dad says that childhood
is the happiest time of my life.

1515
01:49:36,278 --> 01:49:40,448
But l think he's wrong.
I think my mom's right. She says--

1516
01:49:40,616 --> 01:49:45,662
BIRDEE: Childhood is what you spend
the rest of your life trying to overcome.

1517
01:49:46,956 --> 01:49:48,998
That's what Mama used to say.

1518
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:52,669
She said, "Beginnings are scary,
endings are usually sad...

1519
01:49:52,836 --> 01:49:55,255
...but it's the middle
that counts the most."

1520
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:58,925
You need to remember that
when you find yourself at the beginning.

1521
01:49:59,093 --> 01:50:03,429
Just give hope a chance to float up.
And it will too.

1522
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:09,352
Put out the sun

1523
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:17,151
When you love someone

1524
01:50:21,365 --> 01:50:26,369
When the rain is blowing in your face

1525
01:50:27,663 --> 01:50:32,875
And the whole world is on your case

1526
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:39,465
I would offer you a warm embrace

1527
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:43,886
To make you feel my love

1528
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:51,811
When the evening shadows
And the stars appear

1529
01:50:53,230 --> 01:50:58,818
And there is no one to dry your tears

1530
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:05,491
I could hold you for a million years

1531
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:09,454
To make you feel my love

1532
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:17,295
Know you haven't made your mind up yet

1533
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:22,508
But I would never do you wrong

1534
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:29,766
I’ve known it from the moment
That we met

1535
01:51:30,309 --> 01:51:35,521
There's no doubt in my mind
Where you belong

1536
01:51:37,775 --> 01:51:42,779
I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue

1537
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:48,659
I'd go crawling down the avenue

1538
01:51:50,412 --> 01:51:54,749
There ain't nothing that l wouldn't do

1539
01:51:56,251 --> 01:52:01,297
To make you feel my....

1540
01:52:01,465 --> 01:52:08,388
Chances are you'll find me
Somewhere on your road tonight

1541
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:14,977
Seems I always end up driving by

1542
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:24,987
Ever since I’ve known you
It just seems you're on my way

1543
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:31,202
All the rules of logic don't apply

1544
01:52:35,499 --> 01:52:39,669
I long to see you in the night

1545
01:52:44,091 --> 01:52:50,012
Be with you till morning light

1546
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:57,937
I remember clearly how you looked
The night we met

1547
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:05,278
I recall your laughter and your smile

1548
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:15,037
I remember how you made me
Feel so at ease

1549
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:22,211
I remember all your grace and your style

1550
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:31,971
You've come to mean so much to me

1551
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,516
-Chances are I'll see you
-Chances are I'll see you

1552
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:39,479
-Somewhere in my dreams tonight
-Somewhere in my dreams tonight

1553
01:53:41,064 --> 01:53:45,776
-You'll be smiling like the night we met
-You'll be smiling like the night we met

1554
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:52,074
-Chances are I'll hold you
-Chances are I'll hold you

1555
01:53:52,242 --> 01:53:55,995
-And I'll offer all l have
-And I'll offer all l have

1556
01:53:57,414 --> 01:54:02,043
-You're the only one l can't forget
-You're the only one l can't forget

1557
01:54:05,547 --> 01:54:10,259
-Baby, you're the best I've ever met
-Baby, you're the best I've ever met

1558
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:28,861
