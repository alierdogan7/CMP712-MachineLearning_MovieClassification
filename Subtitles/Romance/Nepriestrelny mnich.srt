we're still under construction.

363

But we wanted you,
our most generous supporters,

364
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,347
to have a preview of our new exhibit.

365
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,935
You see, out of the rubble that was Europe
at the end of World War II,

366
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:19,814
men and women of good will,
people like yourselves,

367
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:25,277
decided to build an organization dedicated
to the prevention of human rights abuses

368
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,196
all around the Earth.

369
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,865
And today I am here to tell you

370
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,242
we failed.

371
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:37,206
Thanks to all of you
and many others like you,

372
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,667
we are able to continue this fight.

373
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,877
This fight against hate,

374
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,923
violence, oppression, and cruelty
in all its forms.

375
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,097
– Excuse me?
– Yes?

376
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:58,143
Do you ever worry that some of the people
that come here may be inspired?

377
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,855
I hope each and every person
who comes here will be inspired.

378
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,232
I mean, inspired to do it again.

379
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,900
Oh.

380
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,903
Well, granted. There are an awful lot
of sick people in this world.

381
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:11,532
But, thankfully, most of them
don't attend our functions.

382
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,409
I have an idea.

383
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:18,038
How about instead of showing atrocity,

384
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:23,085
you do an exhibit that shows
man's humanity towards man?

385
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:27,256
You don't help anyone
by shielding them from reality.

386

387

00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,266

390

391
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,986
or the one about to do the shooting?

392
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,950
I really must go. It's been a pleasure.

393

396
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,104

408
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,271

409

For 60 years,
I have been chasing the scroll.

410
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,362
It holds the power to rejuvenate me,

411

to make me young again,

412

and to finally cleanse the world
of all inferior races,

413
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:23,455

all those years ago.

Now you show up again
and you're picking my pocket?

The pocket was yours,
but not what I picked.

than follow me around

430

'Cause if I remember correctly,

436
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,695
last night you were using them
to try to teach me ultimate enlightenment.

437
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,867
I was translating universal truth
into words you would understand,

438
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,786
but this.

439
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:48,123
To keep the body pure
one must not kill any living creature.

440
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,460
I didn't kill it. I'm gonna eat it.

441
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:56,465
And by the way, I got the answer
to your little question from last night.

442
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,634
– Yeah?
– Yeah. Check this out.

443
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,470
The reason hot dogs
come in packages of 10

444
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,889
and hot dog buns
come in packages of just eight

445
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,392
is that you always need more buns
for your hot dogs.

446
