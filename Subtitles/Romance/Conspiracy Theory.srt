Hey, Flip, did I ever tell you
that the whole Vietnam War...

174
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,638
was fought over a bet...

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,973
that Howard Hughes lost
to Aristotle Onassis?

176
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,015
I heard that. The two of them
used my legs for a wishbone.

177
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,104
Nearly snapped my butt in half.

information that he's got...

767
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,702
and had a national podium to shout
it from, they'd actually let him do it?

768

No, it's quite clear that he's a
disinformation junkie for him.

769
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,165

says it all. He should be dead.

put a lot of time into it and you seem to...
