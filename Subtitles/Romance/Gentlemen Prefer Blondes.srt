00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:43,563
- We'll go meet on the beautîful shore
- Baby, bye, goodbye

165
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,809
Bye-bye, pretty baby

166
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:51,204
You better remember you're my baby

167
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:55,207
When they gîve you the eye
My, my!

168
00:13:55,453 --> 00:14:00,573
Although I know that you care
Won 't you wrîte and declare

169
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:07,008
Declare that though on the loose
You are stîll stayîng on the square

170
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:09,767
I'll be gloomy

171
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,362
But send that raînbow to me

172
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:16,208
Then my shadow wîll fly

173
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:20,207
Though you'll be gone for a whîle

174
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:27,450
I know that I'll be smîlîn '
Wîth my baby by and by and by

175
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:32,568
Wîth my baby by and by

176
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:51,005
I'll be în my room alone

177
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:55,804
Every postmerîdîan

178
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:59,966
And I'll be wîth my dîary

179
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:06,561
And that book by Mr. Gîdeon

180
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:13,087
Bye-bye, baby

181
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:19,010
Remember you're my baby

182
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:25,931
When they gîve you the eye

183
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:33,209
And just to show that I care

184
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:39,210
I wîll wrîte and declare

185
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:44,607
That I'm on the loose

186
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:50,564
But I'll stay on the square

187
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:56,812
I'll be lonely

188
00:15:57,053 --> 00:16:02,889
But even though I'm lonely

189
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:09,612
There'll be no other guy

190
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:18,929
Though I'll be gone for a whîle

191
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:24,810
I know that I'll be smîlîn '

192
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:30,170
Wîth my baby by and by and by

193
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:33,570
Wîth my baby by and by

194
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:39,012
I'll be gloomy
But send that raînbow to me

195
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:45,208
PORTER: All ashore! Last call!
All ashore! Last call!

196
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:54,403
I know that I'll be smîlîn '
Wîth my baby by and by and by

197
00:16:57,293 --> 00:17:03,163
Bye-bye, baby
Remember you're my baby

198
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,121
When they gîve you the eye

199
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:13,084
Although I know that you care
Won 't you wrîte and declare

200
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:19,050
That though on the loose
You are stîll on the square

201
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,568
- You better go.
- Don't go.

202
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,850
- Step back, please.
- Bye, lover!

203
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:39,930
I know that I'll be smîlîn '
Wîth my baby by and by

204
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,049
And by

205
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:46,684
Wîth my wonderful baby

206
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:55,172
By and by

207
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:11,163
- Hi.
- Hi.

208
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:17,372
- Hi, Miss Shaw.
- All right, guys, keep moving.

209
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:24,692
- "Mr. Amos Jones and valet."
- What are you doing?

210
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:30,447
Çhecking the passenger list.
"Mr. Alfred Loman and valet."

211
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:33,565
"Mr. Eugene Martin and valet."

212
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,532
Why the sudden interest in valets?

213
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:41,363
When a man has "and valet"
after his name, he's worthwhile.

214
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:44,406
I'm trying to find
a gentleman escort for you.

215
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:49,090
Don't bother. I just
provided myself with about 20.

216
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:53,482
Dorothy, did you ever hear
of a rich pole-vaulter?

217
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:58,483
Who cares? I like a man
who can run faster than I can.

218
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:00,809
I hate to think where you'll wind up.

219
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:04,528
You're wasting time on
unrefined persons without money.

220
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:08,442
Did it occur to you that
some people don't care about money?

221
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:11,446
Don't be silly.
We're talking serious.

222
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:15,966
- Do you want a loveless marriage?
- Me, loveless?

223
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:20,804
If a girl spends time worrying
about the money she doesn't have...

224
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:23,686
...how will she have
any time for love?

225
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:28,205
I want you to find happiness
and stop having fun.

226
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:32,685
- That baffles me.
- You'll thank me some day.

227
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:38,013
Here's a good one:
"Henry Spofford III and valet."

228
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:42,684
I remember. The Spofford family
owns practically a whole state.

229
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:46,090
A big one too.
I think it's Pennsylvania.

230
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:49,205
I guess I could settle
for Pennsylvania.

231
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:54,328
- Hello, Mrs. Henry Spofford III.
- Mrs. Henry Spofford III and valet.

232
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:57,605
He won't have anything I don't.
See you later.

233
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:01,362
Don't forget the cocktail party. 5:30.

234
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:09,971
- The whole team?
- Until after the games.

235
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:13,927
- You eat at 6 and go to bed at 9?
- That's right.

236
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,725
Çoach is strict.

237
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:20,404
Holy smoke, 9:00!
That's just when life begins.

238
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,490
- Not for us.
ÇOAÇH: All right you guys.

239
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:24,291
[WHISTLE BLOWS]

240
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:36,171
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

241
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:47,645
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

242
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,850
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

243
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:05,604
Honey, you'll hurt yourself.

244
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:12,168
I can 't play tennîs
My golf's a menace

245
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:15,371
I just can 't do the Australîan crawl

246
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:20,084
And I'm no better at volleyball
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?

247
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,963
Sweet love
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?

248
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:39,293
I'm apathetîc and non-athletîc
Can 't keep up în a marathon

249
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:46,171
I need some shoulder to lean upon
And a couple of arms to hold me

250
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:49,763
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?

251
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:05,765
I'm not în condîtîon to wrestle

252
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:09,972
I've never traîned în a gym

253
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:16,443
Show me a man who can nestle

254
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:20,965
And I'll pîn a medal on hîm

255
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:26,610
Need some chappîe to make me happy
And he don 't have to be Hercules

256
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:31,563
Don 't anyone know about bîrds and bees?
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?

257
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:36,372
Sweet love

258
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:40,361
Aîn 't there anyone...

259
00:22:40,613 --> 00:22:44,572
... here for love?

260
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,172
Doubles, anyone?

261
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:00,963
Çourt's free.

262
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:09,361
Two out of three, anyone?

263
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:17,970
Doesn't anyone want to play?

264
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:23,802
I lîke bîg muscles
And red corpuscles

265
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:27,762
I lîke a beautîful hunk of man

266
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:32,006
But I'm no physîcal culture fan

267
00:23:32,253 --> 00:23:36,212
Aîn 't there anyone here for love?

268
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:40,844
Sweet love
Aîn 't there anyone

269
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,203
Aîn 't there anyone

270
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:53,563
Aîn 't there anyone, anyone
Anyone, anyone

271
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:00,645
For love?

272
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:12,841
- Did you say $50?
- Oui.

273
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:15,647
A tidy sum just to sit at a table.

274
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:21,405
Supply and demand. Many requests
for a seat at Miss Shaw's table.

275
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:27,609
And the price goes up and up and up.
That's inevitable. Je regrette.

276
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:34,166
Je regrette it more than vous.
However, the name's Malone.

277
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,649
Get it down while
I can still afford it.

278
00:24:38,253 --> 00:24:41,404
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
- Are you the headwaiter?

279
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,332
- At your service.
- I'm Miss Lee.

280
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:49,812
Oh, Miss Lee. Well, now I understand.
What can I do for you?

281
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:52,806
Put a certain gentleman at my table.

282
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,971
There's nothing I can do for you.

283
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:59,404
All seating arrangements
are completed, final.

284
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:05,011
In Atlantic Çity, all the men
at my hotel wanted to sit at my table.

285
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:10,486
- I can understand that.
- Some even gave the headwaiter money.

286
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:14,163
That happens. What can one do?
One takes it.

287
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:18,525
- That headwaiter had to give it back.
- Indeed? Why?

288
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:24,012
I had all my meals in my room.
I didn't come to the table at all.

289
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:27,330
Naturally the men wanted their money.

290
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:31,208
- I beg you...
- Do you want me to eat in my room?

291
00:25:31,453 --> 00:25:33,489
That must not be.

292
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:37,732
If Mr. Henry Spofford III
is seated at my table...

293
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:42,051
- It shall be.
- Thank you ever so.

294
00:25:52,453 --> 00:25:56,366
- Hi.
- Hi, Miss Shaw. Nice to see you.

295
00:25:56,573 --> 00:26:01,806
My name is Watson.
Here we are, all ready for you.

296
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:04,169
- I need it.
- What's the matter?

297
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:10,289
The entire Olympic team has to be
in bed by 9:00. What can you do?

298
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:14,008
- Write your congressman.
- Çatch me a pigeon, and I will.

299
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:19,492
May I present Sir Francis Beekman?
A pigeon, if there ever was one.

300
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:21,172
Note the ruby eyes.

301
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:26,003
No reason to run me down.
Jealous. I have a way with ladies.

302
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:31,566
It's that diamond mine of yours.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

303
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:36,807
Çheeky fellow. Good sort, though.
What say we sit down?

304
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:40,608
I understand you're an entertainer.
I'll bet you're good.

305
00:26:40,853 --> 00:26:44,004
Thanks. Say, is that on the level?
Do you own a diamond mine?

306
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:47,250
I do.
Are you interested in diamonds?

307
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:51,731
- Not particularly.
- You must be an extraordinary girl.

308
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:55,084
- Will you do me a favor, sir?
- Çall me Piggie.

309
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,006
- Do me a favor, Piggie?
- Anything.

310
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:03,526
Don't spread it around about your mine.
I don't want my friend to hear.

311
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,485
She doesn't care for diamonds?

312
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:10,608
I'm trying to avoid trouble.
Do not tell her about the diamonds.

313
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,730
Did you say "diamonds"?

314
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:16,608
Well, well, well!
By George, I must say!

315
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:21,165
No doubt about it, no sirree.
No doubt about it at all.

316
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,969
- Miss Lee, meet Piggie.
- Delighted! Delighted!

317
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:31,805
You did say "diamonds." I can tell.

318
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:36,211
I control the second largest mine
in South Africa.

319
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:41,481
But this lady has a friend
she doesn't want to know about me.

320
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,810
- I wonder why.
- Oh, no, you don't.

321
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:50,446
Having heard so much about you,
I expected you'd be much older.

322
00:27:50,693 --> 00:27:55,926
Me? You don't say. By George!
Older than what?

323
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,532
The Pyramids.

324
00:27:57,733 --> 00:28:01,965
I say if a man isn't a certain age,
he isn't interesting.

325
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:04,209
Honey, lay off!

326
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:06,722
Bless my soul. Çare to dance?

327
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:11,688
I'd enjoy to dance.
Thank you ever so.

328
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:15,843
- Another drink?
- No, thanks.

329
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:21,411
- Need a program to tell the players.
- I want to know who the players are.

330
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:26,568
- Like, who just stole second base?
- My name's Malone.

331
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:31,005
Mine's Shaw, Dorothy.
Well, Mr. Malone?

332
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:34,802
You're the most attractive girl here,
so I came over.

333
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:41,208
- Flattery will get you anywhere.
- Then we haven't any problems.

334
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:44,485
I was wondering why
you hadn't shown up before this.

335
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:49,767
- I had some business to attend to.
- Then this isn't a vacation?

336
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:52,732
Not entirely.
There's still a telephone.

337
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:55,606
- In fact, I just had some bad news.
- Oh?

338
00:28:55,813 --> 00:29:01,126
My best 2-year-old will never
run again. He's worth $40,000.

339
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,325
It's not the money.
This might've been good.

340
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:07,650
- You're not one of those?
- One of what?

341
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:10,845
The kind who tells a girl
about his money.

342
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:13,009
What's wrong with money?

343
00:29:13,213 --> 00:29:17,411
Yes, I'm afraid you are.
Go whistle up a rope.

344
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:18,881
Wait...

345
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:22,369
I can't stand rich playboys
who think they...

346
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:27,567
Now wait a minute! I'm not that bad
all the time. Sometimes I'm very nice.

347
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:30,373
Sometimes I speak without thinking.

348
00:29:30,573 --> 00:29:33,212
So you're half sweet, half acid.

349
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:36,610
- Please, I made a mistake.
- Yes, you did.

350
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:41,369
I got some bad information.
Now that I've put my foot in it...

351
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:45,885
...I remember it wasn't you they were
talking about, but your friend.

352
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:49,210
- Lorelei.
- Or am I wrong again?

353
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:53,167
No, money is rather
a hobby of Lorelei's.

354
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:56,526
Oh, Piggie.

355
00:29:56,733 --> 00:30:01,329
- You're worried about her.
- You're very observing.

356
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,364
Am I forgiven?

357
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:06,452

on this craft...

358
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:10,168
Good. We'll start all over again.

359
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,011
We're gonna be interrupted.

360
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:13,732
We had a jolly time.

361
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:19,485
- Mr. Malone, Miss Lee and Piggie.
- How do you do?

362
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:25,290
Piggie is the super-best dancer.
So light on his feet.

363
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:29,406
- I was sure he would be.
- You're trying to flatter me.

364
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:32,252
LORELEl: What's the matter?
- My wife.

365
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:36,128
- I thought it was his mine.
- Won't you join us?

366
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:39,689
- I just have.
- May I present Miss Lee?

367
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:43,050
- Miss Shaw, Mr...
- Malone.

368
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:47,485
- A pleasure, I'm ever so sure.
- Thank you.

369
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:50,412
We're having a jolly time.

370
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:55,403
Lady Beekman, that's the most
beautiful jewelry I've ever seen.

371
00:30:56,613 --> 00:31:01,607
I'm proud of the earrings. Heirlooms.
Been in the family for ages.

372
00:31:01,813 --> 00:31:05,362
You'd never know it.
They look just like new.

373
00:31:06,293 --> 00:31:11,128
You might be interested in my tiara.
I always have it with me.

374
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,483
Afraid to leave it in my room.

375
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:19,370
- But not afraid to show it to Lorelei?
- Stop. She won't know you're teasing.

376
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:25,123
Look! Did you ever?
Anywhere, anything like it?

377
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,769
All blue stones.
Çozy little job, what?

378
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:32,323
- May I just hold it for a minute?
- Of course.

379
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:38,087
- How do you put it on?
- It goes on your head.

380
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:44,084
- You must think I was born yesterday.
- There's no other explanation.

381
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:49,327
No, no, my dear. She's quite right.
Like so. It's a tiara.

382
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:55,608
You do wear it on your head! I love
finding new places to wear diamonds.

383
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:59,726
Excuse me, dear.
Miss Lee has promised me this dance.

384
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:03,130
We've got to dress for dinner.
We must go.

385
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,893
Well, all right. Au revoir.

386
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:09,165
A very pleasant au revoir to you.

387
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,891
My tiara. Thank you.

388
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,852
Poor fella. Two-to-one
she locks him in her closet.

389
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:21,807
- I'd be grateful if she did.
- I think he's cute.

390
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:27,605
You know very well what I mean.
You and that... What are you doing?

391
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:33,166
Just testing. Wonder what I'll
wear it with. How does it look?

392
00:32:33,373 --> 00:32:36,171
Exactly like trouble.

393
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:47,607
I told the coalition leader that we
need a man who can do something about...

394
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:53,526
Finish your story, dear.

395
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:14,332
Your table, madame.

396
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:20,210
Good evening, Miss Lee and Miss Shaw.
This is Mr. Çrossley. Mr. Franklin.

397
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:23,561
- Mr. Mason. How do you do?
- Mr. Brooks.

398
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:24,768
How do you do?

399
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:28,409
- Is Mr. Spofford here?
- No, but this is his chair.

400
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:32,612
- You're here, Miss Lee.
MASON: Miss Shaw, you're here.

401
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:37,284
- Çould my friend have your seat?
- But of course.

402
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:39,723
She gets sick if she rides backwards.

403
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:42,766
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all.

404
00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:49,771
- How are we at the same table?
- I was assigned this seat.

405
00:33:49,973 --> 00:33:54,205
- How much did it cost?
- I can't tell. You'd get conceited.

406
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:56,728
Enjoying the trip, Mr. Franklin?

407
00:33:56,933 --> 00:34:01,131
How many times have you crossed?
Isn't it Ionely on the ocean?

408
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,484
I just adore conversation, don't you?

409
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:08,322
- Mademoiselle, Mr. Spofford is here.
- Oh.

410
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:12,765
Dorothy. Pardon me for whispering.
Try to make a good impression.

411
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:14,048
Okay.

412
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:18,764
Right this way, sir.
Mr. Henry Spofford.

413
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,411
- Hello.
MEN: Hello.

414
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,609
Hello. Hello.

415
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:26,970
Well, are you traveling by yourself?

416
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:30,165
No, I've got a valet,
a tutor and a trainer.

417
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:36,761
Well, having heard so much about you,
I expected you to be much older.

418
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:40,966
I'm old enough to appreciate
a good-Iooking girl.

419
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:44,404
This promises to be quite a trip.

420
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:47,963
Personally, I don't intend
to miss a meal.

421
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,368
How am I doing?

422
00:34:56,893 --> 00:35:01,364
- There's a place.
- Ernie, will you get some cigarettes?

423
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:10,205
I can't get over that passenger list.
Çalling a young boy "mister."

424
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:13,723
A girl could waste
a whole trip to Europe.

425
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:16,083
Think we better give up the idea?

426
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:19,723
If he were 16,
you could marry him in Tennessee.

427
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:24,290
- Drinks seemed like a good idea.
- You're a dear boy.

428
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:28,486
- What's your line, Mr. Malone?
- My line?

429
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:33,409
I tell a girl she has hair
like a tortured midnight...

430
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:36,770
...lips like a red couch
in an ivory palace...

431
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:42,001
...and I'm Ionely.
Then I generally burst into tears.

432
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,966
- Very seldom works.
- You idiot.

433
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:49,411
- What do you do for a living?
- Oh, that kind of line.

434
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:53,447
Nothing, I'm afraid.
Just clip coupons.

435
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:57,971
- Çoupons. That's like money, isn't it?
- Very similar.

436
00:35:58,173 --> 00:36:03,088
I'm so pleased. Dorothy's never been
interested in anyone worthwhile.

437
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:04,408
No taste?

438
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:07,411
No, I'm a hobo collector.
I might find room for you.

439
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:11,162
- She's joking.
- I hope not, I'm counting on it.

440
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:15,008
- Some people don't get her jokes.
- I'm gonna try.

441
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:19,684
Dorothy's the best and loyalest friend
a girl ever had.

442
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:24,125
She'll make a wonderful wife.
You'll find out.

443
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,325
- I've got to be going.
- Going? Where?

444
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:31,208
Don't worry.
I'm only concerned about you two.

445
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:33,921
There's a wonderful moon out.

446
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:38,684
There you are.
Miss Lee, will you dance with me?

447
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:42,812
I'd love to. If you hadn't asked me,
I was going to ask you.

448
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:47,370
Really? Well, by Jove!
I say, will you excuse us?

449
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:56,730
- Do you remember last night?
- Very well.

450
00:36:56,933 --> 00:37:00,482
I mean when we were talking
about the moon.

451
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:04,083
It reminded you of a moon
in Çoney Island.

452
00:37:04,293 --> 00:37:06,727
Çould have been the same one. Why?

453
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,003
I remember I was wondering...

454
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:12,967
...what a rich man like you
were doing in Çoney Island.

455
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,122
Oh, well...

456
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:18,969
I rather thought you'd be
in Bermuda or Palm Beach.

457
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:32,603
Wonder if I should break that up.

458

They're just dancing in public.
Çan't make much of a case of that.

459
00:37:37,853 --> 00:37:39,969
You sound like a detective.

00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,690
Not with me.

463
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,203
Why blame Piggie?
It's not all his fault.

464
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:55,409
No, I...

465
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,691
Just what did you mean
by that remark?

466
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:04,251

be so different and be friends.

You don't mind
if I like you better, do you?

00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:27,802
- We settled that quarrel in a hurry.
- Now what do we talk about?

Let's talk about you.

to meet a really interesting man.

- Poor little thing.

00:39:57,533 --> 00:40:01,367
If you like. We're expecting
Lady Beekman for tea.

488
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:04,804
Here? I just remembered,
I have another appointment.

489
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:09,564
I better pop off. Toodle-Ioo,
chin-chin and all that rot.

490
00:40:10,613 --> 00:40:14,367
- That was mean!
- Shut up and listen to me.

491
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,683
- You're in a jam.
- Me? Why?

492
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:20,209
What were you doing before
Piggie started barking?

493
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:24,486
- He wasn't barking, that's Swahili.
- Before that.

494
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:29,403
Were you doing anything you
wouldn't want Mr. Esmond to see?

495
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:34,528
- Why, no... My goodness, yes!
- What?

496
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:39,124
He was telling me about South Africa.
It's dangerous.

497
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:45,966
Full of snakes called pythons.
It seems a python can grab a goat...

498
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:49,688
...and kill it
by squeezing it to death.

499
00:40:49,893 --> 00:40:52,487
- Get to the point.
- That's all.

500
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:55,412
What's incriminating about that?

501
00:40:55,573 --> 00:41:00,010
Well, Piggie was being the python,
and I was a goat.

502
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:01,845
Oh, Lorelei!

503
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:05,443
Don't worry!
Piggie won't tell anyone!

504
00:41:05,973 --> 00:41:10,364
He won't have to.
When Piggie was squeezing the goat...

505
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:14,805
...Mr. Malone was taking pictures
through that porthole.

506
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:19,768
- Whatever for?
- The Natîonal Geographîc magazine.

507
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:24,125
Wake up, honey.
Mr. Malone has foxed us.

508
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:27,370
He's been shining up to me
to watch you.

509
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:32,567
I'll bet you anything he's a private
detective hired by Mr. Esmond.

510
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:38,208
Gus is jealous without pictures. He sees
that, he'll be absolutely unreasonable.

511
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:40,808
Yes, he will.

512
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:44,812
I was gonna kill him,
but I thought better.

513
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:46,611
Better?

514
00:41:46,813 --> 00:41:49,964
We'll get the photos
if he doesn't know we know.

515
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:52,767
- I'll get them. He's a man, isn't he?
- How?

516
00:41:52,973 --> 00:41:56,932
Çharm won't work.
He's too smart for that.

517
00:41:57,133 --> 00:42:01,411
- And he was such a doll last night.
- Oh, Dorothy!

518
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:05,162
Boy, will I tell him off
once we get the pictures!

519
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:09,252
- The question is, how do we do that?
- Well...

520
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:15,166
The simplest way is to swipe them. We'll
get our warpaint on and go to work.

521
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:57,811
- Where's Lorelei tonight?
- You sound interested.

522
00:42:58,013 --> 00:43:01,050
I am, but not in her.

523
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:06,008
If you are interested,
I know where we could find her.

524
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:07,891

Mr. Spofford, please give me a hand.
I'm sort of stuck.

528
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,926
- Are you a burglar?
- Heavens, no!

529
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:08,727
I got locked in.
I was waiting for a friend.

530
00:44:08,933 --> 00:44:13,211
- Why didn't you ring for him?
- I didn't think of it.

531
00:44:13,413 --> 00:44:18,726
- Lf you're a burglar and I help you...
- Please, help before someone comes.

532
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:23,802
I'm thinking. All right.
I'll help you for two reasons.

533
00:44:24,053 --> 00:44:26,089
Never mind the reasons.

534
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:29,763
The first is, I'm too young
to be sent to jail.

535
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:34,603
The second is, you've got
a lot of animal magnetism.

536
00:44:36,853 --> 00:44:39,970
Look, someone's coming.

537
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:47,572
- What'll I do?
- Hold this around your neck, tight.

538
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,127
Good evening.

539
00:44:56,333 --> 00:45:00,406
I say, whatever are you
doing up there?

540
00:45:00,653 --> 00:45:03,213
I wanted to see the view from here.

541
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:06,650
Are you feeling well, my dear?

542
00:45:06,853 --> 00:45:10,812
Yes, thank you ever so.
But I must have caught a chill.

543
00:45:11,053 --> 00:45:14,807
- What say we get a spot of sherry?
- I can't.

544
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:18,972
- Sherry's the best thing for a cold.
- I couldn't.

545
00:45:19,173 --> 00:45:21,926
You do look flushed.
Let me feel your pulse.

546
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:23,885
No, no, please...

547
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:28,245
No cause for alarm, my dear.
It's purely medical.

548
00:45:28,453 --> 00:45:32,810
- There's no fever, at any rate.
- I'm all right, I'm fine.

549
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:35,607
- Such a little hand.
- Put that back.

550
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:40,933
So sweet, so tiny,
and yet it can hold a human heart.

551
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:43,363

- Beg your pardon?

552

Well l... Why...

553
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:49,366
- Laryngitis, I guess.
- No doubt.

554
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:54,528
- I need sherry. Will you get it?
- I fly on the wings of Mercury.

555
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:58,692
SPOFFORD: Just hurry up.
- All right, my dear.

His intentions aren't honorable.

Help me over here.

You're all bruised? Malone's been
here with me the whole time.

560
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:30,002
- Mr. Spofford pulled me too hard.
- Never mind. Did you get the pictures?

561
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:32,010
- They weren't there.
- Sure?

562
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:36,491
I looked everywhere.
I even looked in the camera shop.

- Then he's got them in his pockets.
- He must, darn it!

564

He wouldn't hide them if
he thinks we're buying his act.

565

Order dinner for three in our cabin

I have a friend named Dorothy,
and she's a really good friend.

anything really wrong.

She's very fond of him.

This becomes more and more confusing.

My decision is this:

The property will be placed
in this court's custody...

give me the tiara.

It was stolen.
