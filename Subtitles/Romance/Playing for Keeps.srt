Well, it was vacation homes in Winnipeg.
I was just a spokesman, so...

169
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,865
And you had a sports bar, right?

170
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,906
Yeah, yeah, I had a bar.
You know, the economy.

171
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,670
Right, right.
Didn't work out.

172
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,110
Actually, I've been thinking
now about something you suggested.

173
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,272
Like sports-casting.

174
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,750
I made a demo.

175
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,788
I thought I would...
You know, I'd show it to you first.

176
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,721
No, I'll definitely
take a look at it. Heh.

177
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,226

to replace me around here.

Oh, shit. Uh...

Hey, look, put this on my desk, all right.
It belongs to my man here.

180
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:56,067
Listen, uh, take care, man.

181
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,299
All right, man.

182
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,637

Always good to see you.

186
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:11,249

with the Revolution this afternoon,

193
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,268

to defense.

194

That's good. Just keep
doing what you're doing.

198
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,430

Kick it with your toes.

199
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,167
Just straight on.

Just use your toes.

00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:19,279

how to shoot?

GEORGE: No, it's fine.

206
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,192

GEORGE:
Okay, go in the goal, okay?

209
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,802
So first of all you need to know
that you don't kick with your toe.

210
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,667
You plant your foot here
and you follow through.

211
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,966
On the laces, okay?

212
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,134
You gotta plant your left foot down
and follow through.

213
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,540

Whoa!

214
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,975

I was in a meeting.

241
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,631
You always were good
at first impressions, weren't you?

242
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,094
What do you mean?

243
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:12,669
Well, you were such a splash at practice
that the parents want you to coach.

Wait, what?
What are you talking about?

you did anything for Lewis?

a couple of hours at the park.

and took a vicious shot to the testicles</i>

335
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,875
<i>so maybe it's best to keep him
as far away from the ball as possible.</i>

336
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,010
Coach? Hi, can I
talk to you for a second?

337
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,209
Yeah.

338
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,448
Oh, I, um... Well, I just...
it'll just take a second.

339
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,059
I wanted to know
how he was doing.

340
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,250
How who's doing?

341
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,626
Billy. I'm Billy's mom. You don't know that.
I'm Barb, hi.

342
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,198
Oh, hey, Barb.
Hi.

343
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:13,360
Um, so I know you watch him play. He's
not very good, but he tries so hard.

344
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:17,440
And so I've been practicing
with him, but I'm so spastic.

345
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,306
And I asked his dad to help too,
but he's just so busy,

346
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:25,574
which is kind of the story of our
marriage and now our divorce and, um...

347
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,810
Hey, Barb, he's doing just fine.

348
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,922
You think so?
Yeah, I do.

have experience anyway, you know?

350

extra help then I'm happy to... I don't...

what you've got, all right?
