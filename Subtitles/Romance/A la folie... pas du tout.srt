1
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,923
One rose for the little lady

2
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:07,563
Please deliver it there

3
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:11,483
Sorry, we don't deliver
such small orders

4
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,843
It's to celebrate our meeting

5
00:01:14,363 --> 00:01:16,163
to surprise him

6
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:18,363
Soon it's his birthday

7
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,003
Please...

8
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:24,848
Dr Le Garrec?

9
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,969
Dr L. Le Garrec
CARDlOLOGlST

10
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,530
Angelique, is that a good likeness?

11
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,210
No. But as long as he's handsome

12
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,130
Isn't he?

13
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:28,051
Maybe, but draw the model

14
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,091
Start all over

15
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:48,171
See you all Wednesday
at the Museum

16
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,012
I have something to tell you

17
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:55,972
I have the results:
you won the Hanska scholarship

18
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:58,492
But now you have to obey the rules

19
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:01,372
You must deliver 15 paintings
by September

20
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:03,372
It'll take you all summer

21
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:08,772
The school will fund your trip
and a studio

22
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:10,812
Start whenever you want

23
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,132
Your dad would be pleased

24
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:28,293
You're late...

25
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,493
I got it. I was accepted

26
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:33,173
Fabulous!

27
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:35,613
How come you're here?

28
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:38,293
My mom's away
Heloise is minding me

29
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:39,334
As usual

30
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:40,814
Miss, please

31
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:44,814
So you'll be famous?

32
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,414
At least people will see my work

33
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,814
Such service! It's a delight!

34
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:51,974
You're right

35
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:53,614
Who's he?

36
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:57,054
A new guy. He's come 3 times

37
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,014
Will they date?

38
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:01,214
Tomorrow night

39
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,174
Can you mind me?

40
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:06,975
Let's go buy those sneakers!

41
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,135
Sleeping here tonight?

42
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,295
No, I'm seeing Loic
Again?

43
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:20,095
We may lose you for good

44
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:22,975
See you tomorrow!

45
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:26,455
It's a very rare plant

46
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:30,176
Grows in the desert
A wedding gift, 6 years ago

47
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:32,176
It only survives here

48
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:34,856
in this glass case
at constant temperature

49
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:36,576
I'll be very careful

50
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:38,816
Taking it with us, would kill it

51
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:42,416
I'm so glad you're minding our house

52
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:44,456
You know it well
and I trust you

53
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:45,736
I should thank you

54
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:48,456
Won't you be lonely here?
No, don't worry

55
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:49,656
Hugo?

56
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:53,456
I hope you enjoy Washington

57
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,777
Anyway, it's only for a year

58
00:06:57,777 --> 00:06:59,737
I'll take care of everything!

59
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,018
I'm interning in Rouen
And you?

60
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:37,378
Staying here

61
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:40,418
Dr. Hebert's taking me in Neurology

62
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:42,338
Excuse me

63
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:48,819
Hi, gorgeous

64
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,899
Is your cardiologist here?

65
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,019
Over there, talking shop

66
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,459
He's foolish
to leave you unattended

67
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,420
It's tricky here
They all know his wife

68
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,580
His wife?
So he's married, too? Great!

69
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,700
She's a lawyer
But he's going to leave her

70
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,500
I just have to be patient

71
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,980
Excuse me a sec

72
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,662
See you later
Later

73
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,183
David?

74
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:30,463
Here, some champagne

75
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,384
No, I'm off too. Some other time

76
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:57,346
A surprise for him?

77
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,706
Know the time?

78
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:04,027
It's 5AM

79
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,507
The contours are perfectly smooth...

80
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:27,547
Doctor's office, hello

81
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:30,428
Hi, I'm Dr Le Garrec's friend

82
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:33,068
Did he get my painting?
Yes, of course

83
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:36,068
It's in his office. It's beautiful

84
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,988
He's in consultation. Should he call?

85
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:41,908
No, I'll see him tonight
for his birthday

86
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:44,348
A big hug from me
Fine, bye

87
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,953
How can you stand it?

88
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:51,073
It's not easy for him, either

89
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:55,113
Still no news from your mom?

90
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:57,633
She'll come back. She always does

91
00:13:58,273 --> 00:13:59,794
Look what I got

92
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:02,874
The Welfare Office
wants to take Lea from her

93
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,594
I may get custody
they're checking me out

94
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:08,834
You'd better be squeaky clean

95
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:12,634
Excuse me a minute

96
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:41,675
I'll do it myself

97
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,515
What's going on?
It's Loic! Let's surprise him!

98
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,516
Rachel!

99
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:02,316
Who's that girl?

100
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:03,436
His wife!

101
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:11,916
Stop it! What are you doing?

102
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:13,036
Leaving him a message. He'll know

103
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:14,717
Don't let her keep us apart

104
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,357
But she's 5 months pregnant!

105
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:26,797
The baby is just to trap him
She flaunts her fat belly!

106
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:30,557
It's just to stop him
from leaving her!

107
00:15:30,757 --> 00:15:34,237
Would a man leave his wife
and kid for a student?

108
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:37,917
We're not just an affair

109
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,238
We care for each other

110
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:43,478
You're not alone. There's the baby now

111
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,198
You can't understand
you play the field

112
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,719
Why don't you sleep here?

113
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,799
I don't know...
What if Loic stops by?

114
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,079
That's his tough luck
May make him think!

115
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,079
And you promised Lea...

116
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,480
As a kid
I lived in my dad's studio

117
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,000
It was a tiny old studio

118
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,200
and I wanted to have a pet

119
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,640
Dad said no: its hairs'd
get on his paintings

120
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,720
So I made myself a cat

121
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
with bits of string, wool and buttons

122
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,520
I used grains of rice for the claws

123
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,240
I called him "Mr Cat"

124
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:57,441
When I was sad, I stroked him

125
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:01,721
Others saw it as a collage

126
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:04,961
but to me it was "Mr Cat"

127
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:48,923
Seen Angelique?

128
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,243
She went off on your moped

129
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,283
She'll give it back at the bar

130
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:55,483
Really?

131
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,203
She's 2 hours late!
She'd better get a watch!

132
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:03,603
She'll come. She's working hard
for her show

133
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:06,083
I'm no patron of the arts!

134
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,483
Here she is! Don't tell me...

135
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,724
Sorry, someone ran into me

136
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:18,244
I'll pay for the repairs

137
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:21,284
Let me see. Does it hurt?

138
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:22,804
What are you up to?

139
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,524
I see. And it's her right arm!

140
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,044
I need a new waitress!

141
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,084
Wait, Gerard!

142
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,405
There

143
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:50,965
Look

144
00:18:53,485 --> 00:19:00,326
That'll rest your elbow

145
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,646
What is it?
Nothing

146
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:10,926
Is it Loic's?

147
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:23,166
I heard about his wife at school

148
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:26,567
A miscarriage at 5 months!

149
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,127
They couldn't save the baby

150
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:32,687
Loic and I are going to Florence

151
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,447
A dream trip: he just suggested it

152
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:39,647
Don't always believe him

153
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:45,647
What else can I believe in?

154
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:48,047
Me

155
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:57,808
He'll do your next bandage
Tell him I used cleansing gel

156
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,370
Coming!

157
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:08,771
It happened!
What?

158
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:11,211
They fought. She left him

159
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,891
We'll be a week in Florence!
I've got the tickets!

160
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:18,371
We leave in 3 days
Mind watering the rose-bush?

161
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,531
What's all this?

162
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:27,691
I'm off. I've got so much to do!

163
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:16,253
Your attention, please:

164
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:21,654
Iast call for passengers to Florence
on Flight 6435

165
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:14,016
Rachel!

166
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:34,501
Loic?

167
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:38,461
Angelique? It's Mrs Dubois-Rollin

168
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,862
Things OK at the house?

169
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:42,702
Everything's fine

170
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,982
No problem with that leak?

171
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,262
We had it fixed before leaving...

172
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:25,946
She thinks he hasn't left her
that he's testing her

173
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,706
She stays home all day
waiting for him

174
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:32,946
And him?
Not a peep out of him

175
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,826
Next!

176
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:41,026
Please sit down

177
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:46,547
It's your first visit
So what's wrong?

178
00:27:46,787 --> 00:27:47,707
Nothing with me

179
00:27:48,027 --> 00:27:50,787
Then who?
A young girl

180
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,947
Who you used and dumped!
That ring a bell?

181
00:27:54,187 --> 00:27:58,067
I love her. I won't let you
treat her that way!

182
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:00,187
I didn't dump her
I was fair to her

183
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:06,867
I warned her it couldn't last

184
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:08,547
Now leave

185
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:12,148
She didn't understand!
It's driving her nuts!

186
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:14,548
You're destroying her career!

187
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:17,708
Be gutsy, tell her personally!

188
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:20,548
I'm sorry she didn't understand

189
00:28:20,788 --> 00:28:22,508
I have nothing to say to her

190
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:26,468
Get out. I have patients waiting

191
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,549
You're a creep!
Sure...

192
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:43,829
You coward!

193
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,109
Going to Anthropology class?

194
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,189
Be right there

195
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,150
You OK?

196
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,510
Can I talk to you?

197
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,590
You're right, David
Now I have to forget him

198
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,310
But I need your help
Really?

199
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,790
I want to give him
a good-bye present

200
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,471
What I need is...

201
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:29,031
To do what?
Never you mind

202
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:30,271
I can't...
Trust me

203
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:31,511
That's impossible

204
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:33,631
I can't

205
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:52,592
OK... I'll find a way

206
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:01,152
I'm not sure it's a good idea

207
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:02,912
Don't worry

208
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:10,272
What happened here?

209
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:12,192
I still have to clean up

210
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:17,633
Wasn't there a table there?
I sold it

211
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:20,393
To buy a nice gift for Loic

212
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:22,273
You can't do that!

213
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:25,833
I'll buy it back. I just pawned it

214
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,473
You're nuts!

215
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:31,193
He's driving you nuts! Give that back!

216
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,673
I mustn't let him destroy me!

217
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:36,233
You told me that!

218
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:40,273
It's the last thing I'll do

219
00:30:40,794 --> 00:30:48,994
Then I'll never
mention him again. I promise!

220
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:02,834
...there are 10,000 visitors every year

221
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:06,755
Our second feature is

222
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:10,675
about the Paris Hanska art gallery

223
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:13,315
and their coming exhibition
of young creators...

224
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,315
With this year's weather

225
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:26,115
harvests will be poor, and damages

226
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:28,755
still have to be assessed

227
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:34,396
A cardiologist accused
of assault and battery

228
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:36,556
It happened today
in Dr Le Garrec's office

229
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:40,036
A patient, Sonia Jasmin
filed a complaint

230
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:43,156
against the doctor
who allegedly assaulted her

231
00:31:43,436 --> 00:31:46,916
Police will question
Dr Le Garrec today

232
00:31:47,276 --> 00:31:49,636
Our reporter is on the spot

233
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,756
Doctor, how do you answer
these accusations?

234
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:58,557
Did you assault that patient?

235
00:32:00,037 --> 00:32:02,077
Is your career over?

236
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:04,557
Please, doctor!

237
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:14,477
I won't yield! I'll get him
struck off the medical register!

238
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:18,037
I can do it, I'm very influential

239
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:21,238
I'll see he never practices again!

240
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:22,798
You bitch!

241
00:32:34,358 --> 00:32:37,958
Radio Bordeaux, 8AM
Today will be sunny all over!

242
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:41,718
Lea, stop that! Drink your cocoa!

243
00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:46,039
I can't wake him
He was sick yesterday, too

244
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,519
More on Dr Le Garrec

245
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,199
Sonia Jasmin
who filed suit against him

246
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,799
was found dead at her home

247
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,479
She had a serious heart illness

248
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,319
had a heart attack

249
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,959
probably after a scuffle...

250
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,719
Wait for me here, Lea

251
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:05,919
It took place only hours
after her fight with the doctor

252
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:09,919
Police are investigating...

253
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,640
What happened to you?
Nothing, I fell

254
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,160
What happened in here?

255
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,281
Look at the plants!

256
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:45,521
Did you do that?

257
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:52,881
Go on

258
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:54,681
Open up

259
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:03,722
I'm Lt. Joffrey. My deputy, Sgt Thivel

260
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:05,842
May we question you?

261
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:07,362
Of course

262
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:15,802
Some coffee?
No, thanks

263
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:21,522
What happened to your cheek?
I fell

264
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:23,282
I slipped on the stairs

265
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,203
Do you know Dr Le Garrec?

266
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:31,763
One of his patients was found dead

267
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,923
Yes, I heard. How awful

268
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:37,443
Where were you from 8 to 1 0 PM?

269
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:40,883
I was here all evening. With Heloise

270
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,203
We tidied up the place

271
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,123
And we're still not through!

272
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:51,203
Was the doctor at home last night?

273
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,044
I think so

274
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:56,884
He called me around 10 PM. Right?

275
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:03,124
Did he act strangely?

276
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:12,084
If you remember anything...

277
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,484
Call us
Sure

278
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:18,005
Be careful on the stairs

279
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:29,285
Did you do it?
What?

280
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:32,165
You went to her place
and killed her?

281
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:35,925
No, it was Loic

282
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:37,805
He asked you to do it?

283
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,205
No, I did

284
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,846
I wanted her to drop the charges

285
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:45,006
We fought, she fell...

286
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:46,806
It'll be OK, I fixed things

287
00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:49,926
I stole things
so it'll seem a robbery

288
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,526
You've gone nuts!
Let's go to the cops

289
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:56,406
I can't let you go on

290
00:35:56,726 --> 00:35:58,966
OK, let's go together

291
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,006
You tell on me, I'll tell
how much you steal at the bar

292
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,086
Too bad, if you lose your job

293
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:07,167
And Lea will enjoy living
in a foster home

294
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:11,847
She's a sweet girl

295
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:15,167
You wouldn't do that to Lea!

296
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,527
Yes, no one will take
Loic away from me!

297
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:21,287
Not you, or Lea. No one!

298
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:28,287
He doesn't even love you!

299
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:42,048
Where were you last night?

300
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:44,688
This way, Le Garrec!

301
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:48,848
Lt, I'm his lawyer!

302
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,808
Let me talk to him

303
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,728
Say nothing until I get there!

304
00:36:58,089 --> 00:36:59,169
OK

305
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:14,289
I love you!

306
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:12,334
One rose for the little lady!

307
00:39:49,215 --> 00:39:50,255
Miss Jasmin

308
00:39:57,776 --> 00:39:58,576
It's for you

309
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:11,376
"My heart is yours forever"

310
00:40:19,177 --> 00:40:20,697
Who's spoiling you?

311
00:40:20,937 --> 00:40:21,817
My wife

312
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:25,137
Well?

313
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:28,017
What's wrong today?
My heartbeat!

314
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:30,977
It's up again. I can't sleep

315
00:40:31,177 --> 00:40:32,337
It hurts there...

316
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:35,537
You came last week
and the week before...

317
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:39,217
Your heartbeat's fine
It's your bad heart muscle

318
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:43,898
Take your pills, and rest
lt'll go away

319
00:40:46,138 --> 00:40:50,058
What are you doing?
Examine me. It's comforting

320
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:51,898
Don't remove it...

321
00:40:53,298 --> 00:40:54,378
Too late

322
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:15,579
How sweet of you, thanks

323
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:17,899
I'll put it in a vase

324
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:27,099
"My heart is yours forever"

325
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,540
And your convention party?
You won't come?

326
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,780
No, I'll go to bed
with a glass of milk, like a grandma

327
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,420
I love grandmas

328
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,940
Didn't you know?

329
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,141
I'll miss you both

330
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:07,141
...It got to be heavy!
After the operation

331
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:10,781
she sent him her appendix in a jar
As a memento!

332
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:17,261
Something similar happened
to a friend of mine last year

333
00:43:16,704 --> 00:43:18,024
Have we met?

334
00:43:18,624 --> 00:43:20,704
I'm at the Dubois-Rollins' place

335
00:43:21,024 --> 00:43:24,544
I'm house-sitting for them
while they're in the US

336
00:43:26,264 --> 00:43:28,544
Right, yes...

337
00:43:31,744 --> 00:43:35,464
Aren't you lonely in that big house?

338
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:39,385
Come have a drink some day

339
00:43:39,945 --> 00:43:42,145
Not just yet: my wife's pregnant

340
00:43:42,385 --> 00:43:45,465
But I'll tell you
as soon as it's convenient

341
00:43:58,185 --> 00:44:01,746
I'm off. Rachel's alone
She's asleep by now!

342
00:44:31,907 --> 00:44:33,947
I could drop you home

343
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,150
OK?... You forgot nothing?

344
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,430
I don't think so

345
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,710
You asked Julien?
About what?

346
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,430
Being the baby's godfather

347
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:54,990
Not yet

348
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,790
Fine, I also thought of Helene

349
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,630
Good idea. Will you ask her today?

350
00:46:17,711 --> 00:46:19,191
Let's go play

351
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,151
No, Arthur, leave us alone

352
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,631
Come on
Arthur, I had an idea

353
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:24,151
Here, catch this

354
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:25,314
Let's go home
Why?

355
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:26,394
We've played enough

356
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:30,594
Answer, when I call you!

357
00:47:30,874 --> 00:47:33,154
You said we'd ride some more

358
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:40,474
Mr. Warnier... No, Mr Beukelear phoned:
he'll stop by today

359
00:47:40,794 --> 00:47:44,074
Call the hospital
about Mrs ThibauIt's operation

360
00:47:44,554 --> 00:47:46,555
Mr Meillor has found his EDG

361
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:47,435
His ECG!

362
00:47:47,755 --> 00:47:50,315
He wants to postpone until next week

363
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:51,635
What's that?

364
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:54,555
A birthday gift from your friend

365
00:47:54,795 --> 00:47:56,675
She called to see if you'd got it

366
00:47:56,875 --> 00:48:00,195
I put it up: it's lovely

367
00:48:00,395 --> 00:48:03,355
What friend? I don't get it

368
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,275
Your friend. That's all she said

369
00:48:05,475 --> 00:48:07,155
She'll see you tonight

370
00:48:09,435 --> 00:48:12,276
I don't get it
Did she leave a number?

371
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,076
She seems to know you well

372
00:48:14,316 --> 00:48:17,156
I told you to always
get people's numbers!

373
00:48:17,356 --> 00:48:19,916
I thought that...
Stop thinking!

374
00:48:22,156 --> 00:48:24,956
No signature, no fingerprints

375
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:26,596
Nothing

376
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:32,036
You look handsome

377
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:35,436
I got another message

378
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:41,317
Thanks for the gift you gave me

379
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:44,557
I breathe you, I feel you

380
00:48:44,837 --> 00:48:46,357
I hold you tight

381
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:48,237
I wear it as a memento

382
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:52,837
of the day you declared your love

383
00:48:55,837 --> 00:48:58,197
This is getting heavy!

384
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:04,478
I haven't told Rachel
Not while she's pregnant

385
00:49:04,718 --> 00:49:07,198
And your slip-up
just before the wedding!

386
00:49:07,398 --> 00:49:10,318
OK, I was drunk
it was a one-night stand

387
00:49:10,558 --> 00:49:12,038
You're right, sorry

388
00:49:12,398 --> 00:49:14,918
Don't tell her. And we know nothing

389
00:49:15,598 --> 00:49:19,198
I'd better get home, or else

390
00:49:19,438 --> 00:49:20,998
Helene will imagine things

391
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:22,878
See you tomorrow

392
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,279
Happy birthday!

393
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,719
My love...

394
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,879
I booked at "Peppino's"

395
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:44,199
Be right there...

396
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,479
Who's that from?

397
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:53,520
A patient, to thank me!

398
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,880
What are you doing?

399
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,920
I want it at home
In our living room?

400
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,000
I want to enjoy it, too!

401
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,800
Listen...
Come on

402
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,120
I came because I have chest pains

403
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,801
It feels like someone's

404
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:23,641
sticking a needle into my heart
It hurts all the way up

405
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:25,841
to my jaws and skull

406
00:50:26,161 --> 00:50:30,321
My heart races, it ends up
like a runaway train

407
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:32,881
I start to choke, I can't breathe

408
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:35,121
I can't hear my heart in my sleep
I wake up in a panic

409
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:36,521
I was close by

410
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:39,281
I wanted to thank you for what you did

411
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:43,282
It's still my racing heartbeat

412
00:50:43,602 --> 00:50:46,642
I can't sleep
I'm at my wit's end

413
00:50:46,962 --> 00:50:48,522
I badly need a pill!

414
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:51,202
I felt that my pressure was up!

415
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:55,282
You should examine me
don't you agree?

416
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:14,083
They're all gone. I'm off

417
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:17,563
You OK, doctor?

418
00:51:18,003 --> 00:51:22,283
Good night, Anita

419
00:52:30,846 --> 00:52:34,446
Sorry, I had a file to complete

420
00:52:34,966 --> 00:52:36,726
Listen to your messages

421
00:52:38,566 --> 00:52:39,806
OK...

422
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:44,326
There are 23!

423
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:51,447
You have 23 messages. Message 1

424
00:53:11,127 --> 00:53:12,768
Is this a gag?

425
00:53:13,088 --> 00:53:15,608
Maybe it's your patient
What patient?

426
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:17,888
The grateful one

427
00:53:20,328 --> 00:53:21,848
She must love you a lot

428
00:53:22,488 --> 00:53:23,808
What do you mean?

429
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,208
Happy birthday, my love

430
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:31,168
What's that?
I'd like to know, too

431
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,488
I'll explain: this painting
came without a word, nothing...

432
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:37,329
So what's this? Nothing?

433
00:53:38,689 --> 00:53:40,849
Wait, Rachel...

434
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:45,129
Listen, recently
I've been getting gifts

435
00:53:45,529 --> 00:53:46,369
Messages, all kinds of things

436
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:51,569
They may be from a patient
I'm not sure

437
00:53:51,809 --> 00:53:54,609
Why didn't you tell me?
Not to upset you

438
00:53:54,889 --> 00:53:57,449
The baby's enough worry

439
00:53:58,329 --> 00:54:00,689
If there's another woman...

440
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:02,450
There's no one

441
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,130
Rachel, you've got to trust me!

442
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,170
I'll try. But it's hard

443
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,690
I waited until morning
I wish you'd been there

444
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:22,330
I feel so close, yet so far

445
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:23,650
I have no one, only you

446
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:27,451
I know she's come between us
she clings to you

447
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:29,851
Be strong, my love

448
00:54:30,171 --> 00:54:34,451
don't let her keep us apart

449
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:36,011
We're ready, doctor

450
00:54:49,691 --> 00:54:51,451
You forgot this

451
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:55,452
Wait

452
00:54:56,452 --> 00:54:57,492
Can I talk to you?

453
00:54:58,132 --> 00:54:58,972
Come...

454
00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:11,812
You OK?

455
00:55:13,612 --> 00:55:15,452
I have to see a client now

456
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:22,293
I've listed the people around me

457
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:26,933
Patients, doctors, nurses
Could be anyone

458
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:28,853
Sorry, I'm in a rush

459
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:30,933
How can I convince you?

460
00:55:32,533 --> 00:55:34,293
Do you really want it?
What?

461
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:36,053
The baby

462
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,173
Rachel, we have to go

463
00:56:13,975 --> 00:56:16,095
Shit!

464
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:18,855
I've been here since 9AM waiting!

465
00:56:19,095 --> 00:56:21,895
That's enough, I want to see the doctor!

466
00:56:22,175 --> 00:56:24,215
You can't treat us this way!

467
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:25,375
What is it?

468
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,855
I had an early appointment!
It's noon!

469
00:56:28,095 --> 00:56:30,135
But we don't see patients Wednesdays!

470
00:56:30,335 --> 00:56:31,295
What?

471
00:56:32,296 --> 00:56:35,816
Anita, you know
I'm at the hospital Wednesdays

472
00:56:36,656 --> 00:56:38,096
Isn't it Thursday?

473
00:56:38,936 --> 00:56:40,856
Forgive us, Mrs Andree

474
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:04,577
Everything OK?

475
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:10,257
Forgive me

476
00:57:15,857 --> 00:57:17,057
It can't go on
You mix up everything:

477
00:57:17,297 --> 00:57:20,417
the files, dates, patients

478
00:57:20,697 --> 00:57:24,058
People wait and complain. I'm sorry

479
00:57:24,498 --> 00:57:28,058
my partners agree:
it can't go on

480
00:57:28,298 --> 00:57:31,138
Yes, but I'm new to this...

481
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:34,418
I promise, I'll...
You always promise!

482
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:37,338
In 6 months, you haven't improved

483
00:57:37,578 --> 00:57:38,978
Please, doctor

484
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:40,938
Give me a chance

485
00:57:41,178 --> 00:57:42,458
I promise...

486
00:57:43,138 --> 00:57:45,338
You goof once more

487
00:57:45,658 --> 00:57:47,059
and you're out!

488
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:50,259
Sorry
No, please

489
00:57:50,499 --> 00:57:51,619
We're through

490
00:57:57,459 --> 00:57:58,859
Did you fire her?

491
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:05,059
She promised
As usual...

492
00:58:06,939 --> 00:58:07,979
You OK?

493
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:09,379
I'm OK

494
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:12,700
Tired, but OK

495
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,420
You seem quite stressed, distant

496
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,780
I knew it. You're all knotted up

497
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,540
You need a massage

498
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,020
I gotta go. RacheI'll worry

499
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:43,861
Something wrong?
No, I'm fine

500
00:58:51,621 --> 00:58:54,621
You took them?
I just want a glass of milk

501
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:49,463
You're crazy
You're becoming paranoid!

502
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:51,904
Did he offer to massage you?

503
00:59:52,144 --> 00:59:53,024
Loic, he's a physical therapist!

504
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:54,304
It'd do you good

505
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:55,624
What's more

506
00:59:55,904 --> 00:59:57,504
he's right
You're really weird these days

507
00:59:57,864 --> 01:00:01,704
Thanks for the brochure in my mailbox

508
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:08,504
I put nothing in a mailbox!

509
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:11,104
Florence and ltaly, are my dream!

510
01:00:11,424 --> 01:00:14,944
I'll leave with you any time
This girl is yours!

511
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:17,345
"This girl is yours"
Can't be Jean-Louis

512
01:00:18,265 --> 01:00:19,545
It's weird

513
01:00:21,105 --> 01:00:25,025
as if the person thought
I'd send messages

514
01:00:34,025 --> 01:00:34,945
What?

515
01:00:35,185 --> 01:00:36,065
Are you in pain?

516
01:00:36,305 --> 01:00:38,785
Rachel's hurt!
I'm off to the hospital!

517
01:00:38,985 --> 01:00:39,945
Wait, Loic!

518
01:00:44,226 --> 01:00:46,306
My wife?
I took care of her. She's fine

519
01:00:46,506 --> 01:00:47,786
She was knocked over by a moped

520
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:52,746
The driver fell off and fled

521
01:00:53,826 --> 01:00:54,866
And the baby?

522
01:00:56,426 --> 01:00:58,226
The shock was terrible

523
01:00:58,426 --> 01:01:01,706
She's had a miscarriage
I'm sorry

524
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:04,386
No, not that...

525
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:11,907
Julien... the baby...

526
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:27,387
I'll spend the morning here

527
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:33,388
Go out, darling

528
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:35,588
You've stayed in for 4 days

529
01:01:40,188 --> 01:01:42,548
Let's have coffee at "Peppino's"

530
01:01:43,628 --> 01:01:45,388
I don't feel like it

531
01:01:50,308 --> 01:01:52,308
Helene'll stop by this afternoon

532
01:01:57,629 --> 01:01:58,909
See you later

533
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,950
My love, I dream of this trip

534
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,430
you suggested. Come join me

535
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:43,030
Stop lying to me!
This key has your name on it!

536
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:45,030
I can't explain it...
So keep it!

537
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:47,111
I don't know
where the key came from!

538
01:02:47,391 --> 01:02:49,031
Or about a trip!

539
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:52,191
That girl is crazy
She wants to destroy us

540
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:56,391
I need peace and quiet
I don't know anymore

541
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:59,111
I do know! We have to stick together

542
01:02:59,671 --> 01:03:00,831
I don't know...

543
01:03:25,992 --> 01:03:27,512
Anyone in?

544
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:31,432
Sorry, I'm wiped out

545
01:03:33,632 --> 01:03:35,672
I'll take her on a trip

546
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,873
That's not a good idea

547
01:03:39,913 --> 01:03:43,633
Let her breathe
Helene's taking good care of her

548
01:03:44,593 --> 01:03:47,913
For you
Get rid of it

549
01:03:48,153 --> 01:03:52,233
Get rid of them all!
I don't want those gifts!

550
01:03:55,513 --> 01:03:58,513
How's her appetite?
Fine, don't worry

551
01:03:59,393 --> 01:04:02,474
Now what?
The hospital, it's urgent

552
01:04:09,234 --> 01:04:10,634
Wait, I'll check

553
01:04:13,714 --> 01:04:15,914
Did you send them
Varnier's file?

554
01:04:16,114 --> 01:04:16,994
Of course!

555
01:04:17,234 --> 01:04:20,234
They had to postpone
his operation today!

556
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:22,114
I'm sure I put it in...

557
01:04:22,514 --> 01:04:24,154
There's the file!

558
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,035
I was sure I put it in there!

559
01:04:27,595 --> 01:04:29,795
I put all the hospital files in there!

560
01:04:30,675 --> 01:04:33,675
You're fired, Anita! Fired!

561
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:56,596
Bordeaux-to-Florence!

562
01:04:57,876 --> 01:05:00,156
He just lost his ticket!

563
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:04,036
The office is closed Wednesday mornings

564
01:05:04,316 --> 01:05:06,476
If you have any questions

565
01:05:06,676 --> 01:05:08,276
please ask
Thank you, doctor

566
01:05:10,276 --> 01:05:11,596
Next!

567
01:05:14,836 --> 01:05:15,836
Come in

568
01:05:23,477 --> 01:05:26,877
It's your first visit
So what's wrong?

569
01:05:27,077 --> 01:05:28,077
Nothing with me

570
01:05:28,437 --> 01:05:30,957
Then who?
A young girl

571
01:05:31,237 --> 01:05:34,677
Who you used and dumped!
That ring a bell?

572
01:05:35,957 --> 01:05:39,437
I love her. I won't let you
treat her that way!

573
01:05:39,797 --> 01:05:43,198
She didn't understand!
It's driving her nuts!

574
01:05:43,518 --> 01:05:45,558
You're destroying her career!

575
01:05:45,798 --> 01:05:48,598
Be gutsy, tell her personally!

576
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:50,278
I'm sorry she didn't understand

577
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:53,238
I have nothing to say to her

578
01:05:53,518 --> 01:05:56,238
Now leave
I have patients waiting

579
01:06:00,518 --> 01:06:02,158
You're a creep!
Sure

580
01:06:03,638 --> 01:06:04,558
Coward!

581
01:06:05,398 --> 01:06:06,238
What's going on?

582
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:09,039
Nothing. He's Anita's boyfriend

583
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:19,399
It's for you, doctor

584
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:23,439
You know, you're due at the hospital
Wednesday at 1 1 AM

585
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:26,999
Mr Barto's stress test
is Friday, not Thursday

586
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:30,119
He was busy Thursday morning

587
01:06:30,919 --> 01:06:34,280
Mr Timbault phoned
about his cyclosporine doses...

588
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,520
What's this?

589
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,240
Get rid of it!

590
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:07,761
You OK, doctor?

591
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:11,681
What do you want, you nutcase?

592
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:14,161
You like it? You gotta have it!

593
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:18,281
What are these gifts?
You want to destroy me?

594
01:07:18,841 --> 01:07:20,121
You want to drive me nuts?

595
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:23,202
With your messages and all that!

596
01:07:23,442 --> 01:07:25,722
Let go of me!
Stop it, Loic!

597
01:07:26,362 --> 01:07:27,602
Leave me alone!

598
01:07:28,322 --> 01:07:30,762
Calm down
You're sick!

599
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:34,082
Calm down
You'll hear from me!

600
01:07:34,682 --> 01:07:37,842
A cardiologist
accused of assault and battery

601
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:40,442
It happened today
in Dr Le Garrec's office

602
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:44,762
A patient, Sonia Jasmin
filed a complaint

603
01:07:45,082 --> 01:07:49,883
Police will question Dr Le Garrec today

604
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:52,403
Our reporter is on the spot

605
01:07:52,683 --> 01:07:54,643
What do you have to say?

606
01:07:55,243 --> 01:07:57,843
Did you assault that patient?

607
01:07:58,763 --> 01:08:00,923
Is your career over?

608
01:08:01,123 --> 01:08:03,523
Please, doctor!

609
01:08:05,163 --> 01:08:07,243
You wish another appointment?

610
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,803
Fine, sir

611
01:08:14,484 --> 01:08:16,084
What time were you due?

612
01:08:17,004 --> 01:08:18,244
That's right

613
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,604
You wish to change it?

614
01:08:23,404 --> 01:08:26,044
Very well. Good-bye, sir

615
01:08:29,604 --> 01:08:32,404
Lt. Bigord. You're under arrest

616
01:08:34,884 --> 01:08:38,085
Here he is! Can we have a statement?

617
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:40,645
This way, doctor!

618
01:08:44,205 --> 01:08:46,365
I'm his lawyer! Let me talk to him!

619
01:08:46,565 --> 01:08:47,365
Make it fast!

620
01:08:49,405 --> 01:08:52,965
I'll be right there. Don't say a thing!

621
01:08:59,085 --> 01:08:59,725
I love you

622
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:08,086
You slapped her
and she said she'd take action

623
01:09:10,326 --> 01:09:13,846
Then she filed a complaint
phoned the press

624
01:09:15,566 --> 01:09:18,086
You went to see her, you fought

625
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:19,966
and she had a heart attack

626
01:09:20,206 --> 01:09:22,326
Stop alleging!
You have no proof!

627
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:24,326
Once more...

628
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:27,327
You went home at 8PM...

629
01:09:27,607 --> 01:09:29,127
I went to my home at 8PM

630
01:09:29,407 --> 01:09:32,247
and I spent the night there

631
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:34,127
Alone?
No!

632
01:09:35,007 --> 01:09:36,247
I was with him

633
01:09:38,847 --> 01:09:39,967
The whole night

634
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:41,447
Aren't you separated?

635
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:42,807
We're reconciled

636
01:09:43,127 --> 01:09:46,487
If you commit perjury...

637
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:50,047
I spent the night in our home
with my husband

638
01:09:51,047 --> 01:09:52,208
May I talk to you?

639
01:09:57,368 --> 01:09:58,528
We asked his neighbor

640
01:09:58,808 --> 01:10:02,808
She saw nothing odd
No one saw him go out

641
01:10:06,808 --> 01:10:08,368
Why did you do it?

642
01:10:08,928 --> 01:10:12,088
You're a lot of things
but not a murderer

643
01:10:25,649 --> 01:10:27,769
This is completely nuts

644
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:31,129
And a burglary, on top of it!

645
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:37,329
Sorry, but in a way
I'm glad she's dead

646
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:40,609
That woman was insane

647
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:45,370
She almost drove us apart

648
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:29,371
I'm a doctor. What's wrong?

649
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:31,291
Suicide, turned on the gas!

650
01:11:33,892 --> 01:11:35,532
Put her down, she's not breathing

651
01:11:40,092 --> 01:11:41,212
There's no pulse!

652
01:11:57,573 --> 01:11:59,613
Get me some oxygen!

653
01:12:08,093 --> 01:12:10,493
Put her on a drip!

654
01:12:26,934 --> 01:12:28,854
She's breathing. We can move her

655
01:13:23,176 --> 01:13:24,896
You know her well, doctor?

656
01:13:25,896 --> 01:13:28,136
No, I just saw her around

657
01:13:30,056 --> 01:13:31,376
He saved me

658
01:13:32,336 --> 01:13:34,176
He revived me

659
01:13:35,576 --> 01:13:38,017
He put his arms around my body

660
01:13:39,017 --> 01:13:41,217
He put his mouth on mine

661
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,817
He snatched me from death

662
01:13:44,457 --> 01:13:46,497
He regrets all that happened

663
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:50,177
We had many misunderstandings

664
01:13:50,377 --> 01:13:53,577
but now I know, it's for good

665
01:13:54,057 --> 01:13:57,617
Great... What can I say?

666
01:13:58,217 --> 01:14:00,257
You'll be happy and have lots of kids?

667
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:04,978
Seen what he did to you?
He saved my life!

668
01:14:08,938 --> 01:14:10,258
I'm going for a coffee

669
01:14:10,898 --> 01:14:12,098
And Heloise?

670
01:14:16,058 --> 01:14:17,178
She won't come

671
01:14:25,938 --> 01:14:27,859
Let's go visit my folks

672
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:31,419
You need rest, fresh air

673
01:14:31,819 --> 01:14:32,699
OK

674
01:14:35,019 --> 01:14:37,699
I'll get in fine shape for Loic

675
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,340
You can leave in 2 or 3 days

676
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,101
Have your folks been told?
No

677
01:15:17,421 --> 01:15:18,861
I have no one

678
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:21,141
We all have someone... No?

679
01:15:22,621 --> 01:15:25,021
She can come off the drip today

680
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:30,461
When you're better, come see me. Bye

681
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:31,741
See you soon

682
01:15:43,182 --> 01:15:45,062
The room 140 file
Thanks

683
01:15:50,862 --> 01:15:52,102
You asshole!

684
01:15:55,422 --> 01:15:57,502
Don't come in here!

685
01:15:57,822 --> 01:16:00,422
Leave her alone!

686
01:16:00,782 --> 01:16:07,903
I forbid you to see her!
It's all your fault...

687
01:16:08,223 --> 01:16:09,583
Will you be alright?

688
01:16:15,503 --> 01:16:17,623
I'm fine

689
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:25,983
She hasn't understood!
It's driving her nuts!

690
01:16:26,223 --> 01:16:28,503
She can come off the drip today

691
01:16:29,903 --> 01:16:31,864
Examine me, it's comforting

692
01:16:32,144 --> 01:16:33,184
Have we met?

693
01:16:33,504 --> 01:16:34,824
They've gone. I'll leave

694
01:16:35,064 --> 01:16:36,104
See you soon

695
01:16:36,544 --> 01:16:38,024
You'll hear from me!

696
01:16:38,224 --> 01:16:39,144
Asshole!

697
01:16:41,184 --> 01:16:46,384
I have no one

698
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:09,785
I feel so near, yet so far

699
01:17:09,985 --> 01:17:12,105
I have no one, only you

700
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:42,351
Next week we do an ECG
or continue the treatment

701
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,311
Your wife's calling
Excuse me

702
01:19:47,591 --> 01:19:48,751
Hi, darling

703
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,432
I've got the results. I'm pregnant

704
01:19:52,752 --> 01:19:56,152
That's fabulous!

705
01:19:56,752 --> 01:20:02,032
I love you!
I'll call you back

706
01:20:02,312 --> 01:20:04,232
See you soon, I love you!

707
01:20:05,312 --> 01:20:06,672
I'm going to be a dad!

708
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,952
See you Wednesday

709
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:26,273
It's for you

710
01:21:06,715 --> 01:21:08,195
Where's the girl in room #1 17?

711
01:21:08,435 --> 01:21:10,035
She left this morning

712
01:21:10,315 --> 01:21:11,595
She wasn't due out!

713
01:21:11,835 --> 01:21:14,635
A medical student signed a release

714
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,075
He took her to the country

715
01:22:27,358 --> 01:22:29,078
What are you doing?

716
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:31,318
I'm leaving

717
01:22:31,998 --> 01:22:33,078
Where to?

718
01:22:33,278 --> 01:22:34,158
Far away

719
01:22:37,358 --> 01:22:38,758
Will you take me with you?

720
01:22:40,758 --> 01:22:44,238
No. I'm taking you nowhere

721
01:22:45,598 --> 01:22:47,079
I don't get it...

722
01:22:49,599 --> 01:22:52,879
Our trip to Florence? Our song?

723
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:55,919
All that we planned...
We planned nothing

724
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:58,519
We've never been together
never will be

725
01:22:58,799 --> 01:23:00,639
You dreamt it all

726
01:23:00,959 --> 01:23:02,359
Now it's over

727
01:23:40,601 --> 01:23:41,841
What happened?

728
01:23:44,161 --> 01:23:45,241
Call an ambulance

729
01:23:56,441 --> 01:23:59,481
After Prof. Bengali's
psychiatric examination

730
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:02,722
Angelique L. was diagnosed as sick

731
01:24:03,002 --> 01:24:04,722
unanswerable for her acts

732
01:24:05,682 --> 01:24:08,562
The accused suffers
from intense erotomania

733
01:24:08,962 --> 01:24:11,122
that developed in a standard pattern

734
01:24:11,362 --> 01:24:13,882
after she met Dr Le Garrec
her neighbor

735
01:24:14,922 --> 01:24:17,082
In view of her condition...

736
01:24:17,362 --> 01:24:19,442
it was decided that Angelique L

737
01:24:19,682 --> 01:24:21,922
should be confined to a psychiatric home

738
01:24:22,362 --> 01:24:25,082
for an indeterminate period

739
01:24:57,604 --> 01:25:02,364
Let go of me!

740
01:25:03,684 --> 01:25:08,484
Let me out of here!

741
01:25:26,085 --> 01:25:29,005
Doctor, come quick!

742
01:25:32,805 --> 01:25:35,165
He's coming out of it

743
01:26:43,928 --> 01:26:47,808
There's a world in my head
an unreal world

744
01:26:49,048 --> 01:26:52,408
In it, Loic loves me and protects me

745
01:26:52,728 --> 01:26:55,528
In it, he's always at my side

746
01:26:57,329 --> 01:26:59,969
Now I know it doesn't exist

747
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:03,809
that it was an illusion
the fruit of my imagination

748
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:08,449
We all dream of a great love affair

749
01:27:10,089 --> 01:27:12,489
I just dreamt a bit harder

750
01:27:15,769 --> 01:27:17,729
I'm happy for you

751
01:27:18,089 --> 01:27:20,569
You've worked hard all these years

752
01:27:20,889 --> 01:27:23,530
We'll all miss you here

753
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,890
But I'm glad you're being released

754
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,170
If you keep taking your medication

755
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,450
you'll be fine

756
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:33,450
I wish you good luck

757
01:28:27,252 --> 01:28:30,332
"Though my love is insane
my reason calms the pain in my heart

758
01:28:30,572 --> 01:28:33,412
It tells me
to be patient and keep hoping..."

759
01:28:33,772 --> 01:28:38,373
An erotomaniac confined
for over 50 years
