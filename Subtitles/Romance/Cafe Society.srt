1
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,754
When the sun starts to dip
on the Hollywood hills,

2
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,550
the light often takes on the saturated
loveliness of color by Technicolor.

3
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,386
The homes of the movie stars,
in the late 1930's,

4
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,638
said to be fabulous, were.

5
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:40,435
An the cocktail and dinner gatherings,
saw the film colony's creme de la creme

6
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:43,104
draining high balls, exchanging rumors,

7
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,690
making deals and trading gossip.

8
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:49,694
No 'A' list affair was complete
without the presence of Phil Stern,

9
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,238
one of the town's most high powered agents,

10
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,115
and his lovely wife, Karen.

11
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:58,787
Brilliant and dynamic,
Stern could invariably be found holding court.

12
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,706
I saw Paul Muni on stage in New York

13
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:05,084
and I was the first one to determine
that he could do films.

14
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:07,864
I have...I pegged it. I saw him...

15
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,964
long before anyone else knew
that he would be a film actor.

16
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:13,134
And you had the idea?
I knew that he would make the transition.

17
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,094
What...what was his quality?

18
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:17,138
Watch...watch the spilling, please.

19
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,265
It's a good party, Phil,
what can I tell ya!

20
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:20,558
Excuse me.
Yes?

21
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,603
Telephone call, Mr.Stern.
Oh! For me?

22
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,606
I gotta take this.
I'm expecting a call from Ginger Rogers.

23
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,691
I told her that I could be reached here.

24
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,487
She is not happy with her
representation, so who knows?

25
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:33,187
Charmed luck!

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,955
Phil Stern, here.

27
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,249
Phil, it's Rose.

28
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,375
Rose?

29
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:46,876
Your sister.

30
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,420
How did you find me here?

31
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,798
Your housekeeper gave me the number.

32
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:53,258
What's wrong?

33
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,511
Bobby quit, Marty's jewelry business.

34
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,680
And he's coming to Hollywood.

35
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:02,308
I was hoping that you could find
something for him in your agency.

36
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:03,768
Who?

37
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,144
Bobby.

38
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:06,646
My son.

39
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,106
Your nephew.

40
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:09,399
Phil? 

41
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:12,443
We're talking to Warner Brothers the next summer,
if they wind up the rights for the book.

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,529
And, Bette Davis would be perfect.

43
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:17,031
When we get the rights
to the book, we'll talk.

44
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:21,494
But Phil, until that happens...try not to
write the deal like lighting a wet match.

45
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,664
OK, let me just get off this call.
Get off the phone, we'll sit down.

46
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:28,664
Uh, huh...hello? Huh?
Hmm, yes?

47
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,045
And he doesn't know a soul out there.

48
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,506
So what the hell is he
comin' out here for?

49
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,426
I mean, I don't know
what I can do for him,

50
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:38,761
meanwhile, this call is
costing you a fortune.

51
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,263
Look,

52
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,681
I...I gotta go.

53
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:45,059
Ginger Rogers is trying
to get in touch with me.

54
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,271
Two weeks later,
a cab from the train station

55
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,733
pulled up in Hollywood
at the Ali Baba Motel.

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,154
And emerging from it, was a young man
hoping to make a life for himself.

57
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,198
This was Robert Jacob Dorfman.

58
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,492
Bobby Dorfman, from the Bronx,

59
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,162
away from home for the first time.

60
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:08,041
The son of the poor jeweler, Marty Dorfman,

61
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,084
and his beleaguered wife, Rose.

62
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:14,047
His parents bickered on all subjects.
Particularly Phil Stern.

63
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,506
He is not a Jewish man.

64
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:16,966
And what are you?

65
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,927
You are no example.

66
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,095
You don't pray. You don't fast.

67
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:24,265
And you don't have
a traditional Jewish head.

68
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,559
You're stupid!

69
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,772
Then there was the middle sister,
Evelyn, the school teacher,

70
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,650
married to Leonard, the intellectual,

71
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,110
the professor, the Communist.

72
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,780
Religion is the opium of the people.

73
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,074
A ponderer of big questions.

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,241
A mensch.

75
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,744
A match made in heaven for Evelyn.

76
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,873
Finally, there was the
eldest brother, Ben.

77
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,751
Simply put, Ben was a gangster.

78
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:52,961
Bobby loved his brother

79
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:57,131
and chose to see Ben's lively-hood
as the restaurant's supply business.

80
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,259
But while Ben serviced
bars and nightclubs,

81
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,804
there was a darker
aspect to his life.

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,312
And so, on a sun drenched
day on Wilshire Boulevard,

83
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,483
Bobby Dorfman approaches the
office of his Uncle Phil Stern.

84
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,786
Hmm, Hi, I'm here to see Phil Stern.

85
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,746
You have an appointment?
I do.

86
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:30,999
I'm..ah, Bobby Dorfman, his nephew.

87
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,126
He is actually in a conference at the moment.

88
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,877
Why don't you have a seat.
Of course!

89
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:52,803
Mr.Dorfman?
Oh, yes?

90
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,857
Mr.Stern will not be available today.

91
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,067
There's a little bit of
a crisis thats come up.

92
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,902
Can you come back Friday?

93
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,196
Ah, that's...that's three days away.

94
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,990
Yes, the nineteenth,

95
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,367
Thank you.

96
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,013
I'm sorry,

97
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,307
Mr.Stern had to leave for Acapulco.

98
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:32,810
He said to tell you, it was a promise
to his wife on her birthday.

99
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,313
Christ! He went from
Chicago to Mexico on business!

100
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,607
I'm here 3 weeks, I can't get near him!

101
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:41,027
It's MGM, it's Ginger Rogers,
it's Ronald Coleman...

102
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:44,280
That's why Phil Stern's a big man.

103
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:47,158
He'll be back, so make the best of it.

104
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:51,162
Here...your brother,
he came over for potato pancakes.

105
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:52,538
Take the phone.

106
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,291
Hey pal, you bored already?

107
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,585
I was there for 3 weeks,
that's why I'll never go back.

108
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:01,214
It's sunny and warm but it's not New York.
I do not know anybody here.

109
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,134
Here they call Danish sweet rolls
and serve coffee first,

110
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,554
the minute you sit down.
Even before the orange juice.

111
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:11,099
Let me give you some
phone numbers, ok? Hang on.

112
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,799
OK.

113
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,603
Toni White, Klondike 0079,

114
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,396
She knows a lotta girls.

115
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,108
Know you're shy.
Can't start a conversation.

116
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,526
Just pay him 20 bucks,

117
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,361
She knows you're cute.

118
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:27,240
Hey! I'm not paying. There's nothing
sexy about a commercial transaction.

119
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:31,202
No, you are right kid. It's the worst.
But some nights, it's the only game in town.

120
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,411
Good bye.

121
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,747
He's a good kid. He'll do okay.

122
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:38,042
Meanwhile the phony brother
is givin' a run around.

123
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,544
He is busy.

124
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:43,005
You don't know,
what it is to be busy.

125
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,425
The man eats with
Fred Astaire and Gary Cooper.

126
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,885
I'm impressed.

127
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:48,845
Here.

128
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,264
Good pancakes.
Buy yourself a hat.

129
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,473
What's this?

130
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,184
$1,500?

131
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:57,395
Hmm...going to Florida for a few days.

132
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:02,567
I don't want this money,
if it came from anything fishy.

133
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,846
My partner and I are
maybe buying a nightclub.

134
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,946
Would it make you feel better if
I was in the night club business?

135
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,449
As...as long as it's all above board...

136
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,286
When will you know?
We've to see if the owner is willing to sell.

137
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,912
We're trying to persuade him.

138
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,431
If asked politely, people listen.

139
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,020
I'm at Ali Baba Motel.

140
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:41,938
It's on Grace and Yucca.
Yes, and ah...

141
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:45,318
it's Room 222, on Bobby Dorfman, so yes.

142
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,777
10:15? Yeah. OK.

143
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,780
That's fine, 10:15,

144
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:51,532
yeah, I don't care. No, of course not!

145
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,160
Blond, brunette...whatever she like.

146
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:56,204
Ah, great, I will be waiting.

147
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,354
This is the room you want.

148
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,147
Your date got my room, by mistake.

149
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:24,398
Oh, God! Sorry.

150
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,692
Come on in.
Oh Sorry. Sorry, OK!

151
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,695
Jesus! What the hell did you do?

152
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,239
I'm sorry! I wrote it down wrong.

153
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,574
You know, I live here,
so everyone has to know.

154
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,369
Do I look a working girl?
Look at yourself! Are you kidding me?

155
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,287
Where were you? I am ready to go to sleep.

156
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:41,707
I know, I know. My car got a flat.
I'm sorry, I'm late. My name is Candy.

157
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,043
Delayed, you get the wrong room...

158
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:45,711
I could use one.
Yeah?

159
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,213
Alright, fine! Help yourself.

160
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,423
You know, I usually don't do this.

161
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,051
Oh! Can you let you in on a secret?
What?

162
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,721
I've never taken money before,
so we're both in the same boat.

163
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,932
Wait a second! You mean this is your first job?

164
00:09:58,766 --> 00:09:59,475
Uh..hmm. It is.

165
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:01,394
So if I seem a little disorganized...

166
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,688
My God! Toni sends you over here!
You're not even a pro!

167
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:04,981
Not yet!

168
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,776
You don't have any qualms going down this road?
Umm, huh.

169
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,319
I need a job.

170
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:12,321
My acting career is not going anywhere.

171
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,615
OK! Yeah, but maybe, think.

172
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,325
I need the money.

173
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,494
Uh! You know what? You don't...

174
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,830
you don't have to sleep with me,
but I'll give you the money.

175
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,290
No, It's OK! I've made up my mind.

176
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,709
No, I don't want it on my conscience.
It's too much for me.

177
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,294
It's alright, it's alright. I'm willing!

178
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,838
Oh! Willing? Thank you very much!
It was like taking medicine?

179
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,507
No! No! You are not some big fat shrieker!
Thank you!

180
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,801
Hey! You are nervous and now
you are making me nervous.

181
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,804
I'm not nervous to goto bed...
actually I got out of a pretty hot romance, OK?

182
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,848
But I never paid anyone
to do it with me, before.

183
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,183
Incidentally, I need the $20 in advance.

184
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:43,978
There is nothing sexy about the
two of us going through the motions!

185
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,646
Here, just take the money and go.

186
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,232
Don't you wanna try me?

187
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:52,194
Listen, I'm so lonely that I would have been
happy to talk but I'm even too tired for that.

188
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,030
Am I not attractive?

189
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,657
You are okay. You are fine!
It's me, I get a headache.

190
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:00,494
Oh? And this town is full of fantastic looking girls?
Yeah!

191
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,539
They come from all over, lookin' to get in movies.
Yeah.

192
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,876
So, you don't wanna go to bed with me?
Yeah.

193
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:11,047
It's just that I'm not in the mood, sorry. I lost it.

194
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,341
Oh Jesus! Don't cry. Don't cry. Cmon!

195
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,469
Oh, come on! Cmon on!
If it's gonna kill you, lets go.

196
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,512
Cmon, we'll do it.
All I ask is that we turn the lights out.

197
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,348
You know what? I got a feelin',
this line of work is not right for you.

198
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,140
Hey look!

199
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:22,808
I came over here a little late,

200
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,852
OK, but its you who is backing down.

201
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,813
Hey! Because you are making me tense.
Give me the bottle. I need another drink.

202
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,066
Maybe if we just took our
clothes off and got into bed?

203
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:33,319
What? No! I can't. It's too mechanical.
Here, just take the 20 bucks.

204
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,696
No! Forget it. I'll just go.
Sorry I screwed everything up.

205
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,908
No, I'm sorry too.
'Cause this isn't really my style.

206
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:42,853
And don't be upset, it's got nothing to do with your looks.
Don't take it personally. Okay?

207
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:47,041
But you don't wanna do it?
Oh, my God! If it's so important to you, we'll do it!

208
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:48,209
Cmon! We'll do it! Let's go.

209
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,127
Come on.
Okay.

210
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,488
Okay!

211
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:53,881
Here, take the money.

212
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,885
So what is your name? Cindy?

213
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,553
Its Candy.

214
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,305
Candy? Its Candy?
Yeah.

215
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,891
It's that real...? What is that? Candice?

216
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,102
No, not really.

217
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,187
But it's a sexy name, don't you think?

218
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:09,397
It's okay..

219
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,650
My real name is Shirley.

220
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,902
Shirley Garfein.

221
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,279
You are a Jew?

222
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,573
Yeah. So?

223
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,575
A Jewish hooker! Is this is a first.

224
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:24,453
Oh, don't act so shocked!
I'm not gonna make a career out of it!

225
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,373
Just take the 20, OK? And please go.
Just go. Thank you.

226
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,041
Oh! What's wrong?
Please.

227
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,709
Nothing, I just can't...let you in.
Let's go.

228
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,170
But, please. Are you sure?

229
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,841
Very sure. It was nice to meet you. Thank you so much.
Just don't talk to anybody on your way out.

230
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,884
That's fine.

231
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:41,804
It's just down this hall.
Great!

232
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:48,978
Come in. Come in.

233
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:51,689
Sorry been so hard to get to.

234
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,358
Hate to tell you, how hard its been going
through with Howard Hawks at Chicago.

235
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,277
Oh! That's okay, Uncle Phil.

236
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,195
Sit.

237
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,284
So...

238
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:05,244
what's the story?

239
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,621
Rose tells me you wanna live out here?

240
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:08,622
Yes...yes,

241
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,417
I could not go on with my father's business.
Sorry...

242
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:14,378
It was stilt defying, I wanna do something
more interesting with my life.

243
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:18,507
Call for you, sir.
Hello? Yeah, hi Paul.

244
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,677
Yeah, its a mess down there.
Adolphe Menjou is threatening to walk off the picture.

245
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:25,097
I'll give you the details at Jacks on Friday.
You will be at the poker game, right?

246
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,599
OK, we'll talk then.

247
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:29,477
Yeah, yep. I'm tied up right now.

248
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,478
Great.

249
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,025
You can't believe last coupla weeks.

250
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:40,362
Oh, Christ! Ben, it's all about ego!
This whole town runs on ego.

251
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:43,240
Yeah. Hi, I'm Bobby.
Ben is my brother though, so its understandable.

252
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,700
So what the hell...

253
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,285
What can I do for you?
Adele calling...

254
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:48,369
Hold on...hello?

255
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,289
Oh, Jesus! What...?

256
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,083
Absolutely. Yes.

257
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,586
Lunch on Friday at the Brown Derby.

258
00:13:55,671 --> 00:14:00,549
Yeah. And bring Harry because I believe
Joel McCrea would be the perfect play to lead.

259
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,426
Absolutely. See you on Friday.

260
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,346
And don't cancel on me with
a cock-a-mame excuse.

261
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:08,182
What do you think of Joel McCrea?

262
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,728
I think he's a great movie star.

263
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:16,273
What I like about Joel McCrea is that he can
play drama and give you the light touch.

264
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,983
Great range.

265
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:24,490
So...what are your plans?
Are you plannin' on staying out here?

266
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,119
Well, I thought maybe if you know somethin' I could get started here maybe.
Maybe something at your agency?

267
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:30,955
Here, like what?

268
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,456
I don't know. Like something I can stay out here.

269
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,959
I kinda...I kinda of need a job.

270
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,420
We have nothing here at the moment,
I mean if you're talking about the mail room.

271
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,589
The Mail room, yeah so thats...

272
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,175
Yeah, sure, to maybe begin with.

273
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,344
If something comes up in the mail room,
I could let you know.

274
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,596
OK so...so there nothing here, now then?

275
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,056
Unless...

276
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,350
put you working for me.

277
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,354
Come up with some cock-a-meme title.

278
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,439
I always have some errands to run.

279
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:58,983
Oh! I'll do anything.

280
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,484
You know anybody in town?

281
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:02,361
No. I don't.

282
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,280
Hotel life, it's worse, right?

283
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,991
Umm, Karen and I will
invite you over to dinner.

284
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,867
And we've these parties.

285
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,288
Sunday brunches. We'll invite you.
You meet some nice people.

286
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,081
Vonnie, come in here. Can you?

287
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,917
Check in with me each day and I will
have some odd jobs for you to do.

288
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,169
This is so nice of you, Uncle Phil.

289
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,005
Stop with The Uncle. It's Phil.

290
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,840
You don't wanna over-emphasize on empathism.

291
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:25,676
Vonnie, this is my nephew...umm...

292
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,228
Bobby. Bobby...Bobby.

293
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,513
He just moved out here.

294
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,474
Maybe you can help him get oriented.
Show him the town?

295
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,976
Right now, he's at sea.

296
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,477
Absolutely.

297
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,272
Anytime this weekend.
Are you free Saturday?

298
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:39,982
Yes! Great. Hmm..umm. And...

299
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,151
Fantastic. Very nice to meet you.

300
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,446
When you leave, I'll get your information.
Okay.

301
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,164
She was nice.

302
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,500
Dear Evelyn, just a note to say hello.

303
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,670
I'd call more frequently but
between mom & dad, you and Ben,

304
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,340
the long distance calls are
probably bankrupting everybody.

305
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,425
Ben sent me a few bucks, so I'm managing.

306
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,676
I gotta job with Uncle Phil.

307
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:12,306
Not much of a job, but he's going to have me at
dinners and brunches, and introduce me to contacts.

308
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:15,351
His secretary is going to
show me around, this weekend.

309
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,102
She is very pretty.

310
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,937
Dear Bobby,

311
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,564
It's raining here today.

312
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,067
Very pretty, but a little melancholy.

313
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,694
Leonard says, its the poignancy of life,

314
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,781
and not only do we have to
embrace its meaninglessness,

315
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,659
and celebrate life because it has no meaning.

316
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,704
Its too deep for me,
but mom always boils it down to:

317
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,040
Live every day like its your last.

318
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,042
And someday you will be right.

319
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:52,388
Hi, thank you so much for driving.
Of course.

320
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,892
So?
So...

321
00:16:58,644 --> 00:16:59,478
So where should we start?

322
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,315
I was thinking, maybe the Beverly Hills homes?
The fancy, spamshy movie stars homes?

323
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,775
Great! I'm game.
Okay.

324
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,736
This is Spencer Tracy's house.
Wow! Hmm...

325
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,031
I think it's one of the prettiest.
But its not done out.

326
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,574
Yeah. Wait! Whose that one?

327
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:13,575
Well that I don't know.

328
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,869
Looks a bit pretentious, don't you think?

329
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,037
Is it?

330
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,665
Well, to me, these all seems
like the Taj Mahal.

331
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,542
I know the feeling.

332
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,921
And here is where Joan Crawford lives.
Oh! My God!

333
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,382
It takes your breath away. Right?
Look at that car!

334
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,552
Know I met Ms.Crawford once.
Really?

335
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,429
She is a client of your uncle's.

336
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,597
What is she like?
Beautiful.

337
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,892
I knew her, before she was a movie star.
She was larger than life.

338
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,896
I can imagine what it would be like,
to be larger than life.

339
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,232
Sure'd be fun for a while.

340
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,527
But I think I'd be happier life-sized.

341
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,743
This is Robert Taylor's house.

342
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,954
OK, if you could chose one house
on the block to live in,

343
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,414
which would you pick?

344
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,502
I don't think I would choose Beverly Hills.

345
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,129
No? Why...why not?

346
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,339
I love living by the beach,
you know...like

347
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,218
my apartment is a short ride to the ocean.
I get to stare it all day.

348
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:19,475
To be honest, I kinda feel sorry for these people.
Needing to feel important in these big houses.

349
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,644
I talk like this now.

350
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,439
But I'm same as every other girl in town.
All with same ambition, but...

351
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,691
What? You wanted to be a movie star?

352
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,277
I loved acting, in school.

353
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,612
Where was school?

354
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,489
Nebraska.

355
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,826
I thought I come to Hollywood and live in
one of these house with swimming pool,

356
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,037
and hop nod with all the glamorous types.
Hmm.

357
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,830
Door openings.
Hmm...

358
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,666
You know, you grow up and...

359
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,212
quickly realize that if you had half a brain,
what a silly life that can be.

360
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,385
Lovely, charming, and un-corrupted
by the values of the seductive city

361
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,347
that worshiped fame and box office records,

362
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,015
Vonnie enchanted him,

363
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,519
although he was too scared to ask,
if she had a boyfriend.

364
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,897
As his philosophy maven
brother-in-law once said:

365
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:10,442
Some questions you don't
wanna know the answers to.

366
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:14,863
Meanwhile, he labored at the trivial
errands his uncle had him doing.

367
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,742
and was the only thought that she would
be free again the following Saturday

368
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,118
and he could see her

369
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,438
that gave him something to look forward to.

370
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,000
(I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU BY FRANK SINATRA)

371
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
* Are the stars out tonight? *
* I don't know if it's cloudy or bright *

372
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:43,000
* 'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear *
* The moon may be high *

373
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:55,053
* But I can't see a thing in the sky *
* 'Cause I only have eyes for you *

374
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,573
Here you go, two beers.
Thank you sir.

375
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,741
Wow! That movie!

376
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,952
I loved it. Did you like it?
Yeah of course.

377
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,704
Barbara Stanwyck is really
one of my favorites.

378
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,915
This place is great! And you were not kidding
when you said this place wasn't a joint.

379
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,042
It's not the Brown Derby or Chasen's,

380
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,421
where you have to make an entrance,
or sit at the right table,

381
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,799
next to Mr.Goldwyn or James Cagney.

382
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,759
Have you ever heard Mr.Goldwyn speak?

383
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,012
He sounds like a wad-will comic.

384
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,890
His accent is so extreme, it's so hilarious.

385
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,391
And I didn't expect that.

386
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,561
What are you thinking?

387
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,105
Just the fact that...

388
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,815
you're very beautiful.

389
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,025
Thank you.
Hmm.

390
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,280
Ah! I don't think its a
very good idea, actually.

391
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:40,782
No?
I'm seeing someone.

392
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:43,535
Oh! I didn't...what's he like?

393
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,829
Doug is a journalist.
Oh!

394
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,167
I just thought, since you had so
much free time in your hands...

395
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,502
He travels a lot.

396
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,214
And I really like spending time with you,
I hope its ok, you know...

397
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,926
you're very sweet.
Have you heard that before?

398
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:03,430
You have this deer in the headlights quality...

399
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,474
Thank you.

400
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,770
Well, if I was your boyfriend,
I would not travel.

401
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,189
Or if I did, I would take you with me.

402
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:14,900
I hope he knows how to kiss you,
all the rest...

403
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,070
That's between us.

404
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,113
I'm just looking out for your best interests.

405
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,823
Thank you!
I am.

406
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,451
What would I do without you?
I dunno.

407
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,670
Honey!

408
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,965
You know Karen.
Actually we never really met.

409
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,675
Phil speaks very highly of you.

410
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,719
Meaning to invite you to one of our
brunches for the longest of times.

411
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,722
Thank you very much.
And I still appreciate everything he's done for me.

412
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,016
I may have some good news for you.
Let's see.

413
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,144
You know, I thought I saw Joan...Joan Blondell here.
Is that possible?

414
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,229
She's around here somewhere.

415
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,190
I hear Louis is going
absolutely outta his mind...

416
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,151
because his new picture is gonna bomb.

417
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,862
Look, Spencer's great. Spencer's always great.
Am I right?

418
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,781
They will never see their money back.

419
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,866
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Say hello to Bobby Dorfman.

420
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,034
Hi, how are you? Poor cheeks.

421
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:09,121
Mike was just saying,
how bad is the take on MGM's new film.

422
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,123
Howard, Rad, Steve! Comon over here.

423
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,333
Is it not the best films you have
ever heard in your lifetime? Am I right?

424
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,210
Howard Fox, Bobby Dorfman.

425
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,878
Howard was the two time Academy Award Winner.

426
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,630
Wow! Congratulations!
Thank you.

427
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,757
You would have never heard of me.
I am a writer.

428
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,300
Rad Taylor, Bobby Dorfman.
Hi, Bobby.

429
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,554
Rad and Steve these are New Yorkers, just like you.
Nice to meet you.

430
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,305
Steve runs our New York law firm.
Nice to meet you.

431
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,683
Right, I do run the New York law firm,

432
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,727
but I have a question for you, Phil.

433
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,604
You said during this trip that
I could see Greta Garbo. Where is she?

434
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,897
Ah...she is impossible.
Greta!?

435
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,150
Greta's gone somewhere, thats where she is!

436
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,861
Bobby, who do you wanna meet?
Ah...Babe Ruth.

437
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:41,987
Ah, I mean present company accepted.

438
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,532
I don't care how many men she sleeps with,
she will never get that part.

439
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,117
Have you seen her in a bathing suit?

440
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:50,829
Huge thighs. They are not Loui B Meyer thighs.

441
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:55,584
This is you faithful Hollywood reporter
calling like he said he would.

442
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,753
Yes...yes it's me.

443
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,465
I think you're actually lucky that your
boss doesn't invite you to these things.

444
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:03,842
It is...it is everything that you can't stand.

445
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:08,055
It's all in-street talk and name dropping 
and caddy back-stabbing.

446
00:23:08,157 --> 00:23:12,017
Yeah, but there are a few faces that
you recognize from the screen.

447
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,018
Oh! Me?

448
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,562
I'm kinda half bored, half fascinated.

449
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:20,567
But I would trade it for tacos with you,
at that little Mexican joint.

450
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,613
Hmm, yeah if we were here together,
we would have a million wicked laughs together.

451
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,449
Oh! No, no. Of course. Go.

452
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,943
I'll speak to you later. Yep.

453
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,926
If you look closely. I'm in there.

454
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:49,930
These, these photos are incredible.
I recognize so many famous faces.

455
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,724
Keep going till you get to
an unknown 10 year old.

456
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,601
What? No! Is that you?

457
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,853
It's me, right next to D.W.Griffith.

458
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,230
Oh, my Goodness!

459
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,691
I grew up in this town but thank God,
I married a confirmed New Yorker.

460
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,319
Oh yeah! Thats right, you lived in New York.
What did you do there?

461
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,071
I ran a modeling agency.

462
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:06,947
Oh really?

463
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,991
Hey! Are there more beautiful girls in
Hollywood or New York?

464
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,327
Why? Is that how y'all decide
where you will live?

465
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,704
No, no, no...I'm just...just curious.

466
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,498
There is more out here.

467
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,668
I'm sure you will have no trouble
finding suitable companionship.

468
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:23,171
Unfortunately, the most beautiful woman
out here already has a boyfriend.

469
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,339
That's life!

470
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,675
That's why Rodgers & Hart get rich.

471
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:30,345
I'm sorry, I think I'm drunk.
I never mixed champagne with bagels and locks before.

472
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,888
Welcome to Hollywood.
Right!

473
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,473
What do you do?

474
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,310
Me? Well medial errands are my specialty.
But I don't see a future...

475
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,919
Steve.
Hey! We met downstairs.

476
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,147
Absolutely.
Bobby.

477
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,650
Here's a New Yorker suffering from unrequited love.
Hmm..uhmm.

478
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,469
It's true!
Oh no!

479
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:49,114
Unrequited love kills more people
in a year than tuberculosis.

480
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,282
I believe that!

481
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,200
I am kidding.
I know, but it sounds...

482
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,579
If you ever find yourself back to New York
and you still broken hearted,

483
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:59,624
call us and I will introduce you to any
number of eligible young goddesses

484
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,918
who believe me, are just as lonely as you,

485
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,795
despite their fabulous measurements.

486
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,214
thank you, OK maybe I'll take you up on that.

487
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,384
Listen, Bobby, if you are bored out here,
we can always invite you to a film we are screening

488
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:13,013
a film in which I have wisely
invested in next week.

489
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,847
I would love to go.

490
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,724
Does that sound good?
Yes. Of course. Thank you so much.

491
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,894
Bring your girlfriend,
if you pry her loose from her lover.

492
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,397
Marty?
There you go! I was looking for you.

493
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,524
I have some good news.

494
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:28,945
Vonnie, Hi.
Hi.

495
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,406
You are free tonight?

496
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:32,574
I'm not.

497
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,285
You sure? I wanted to take you out celebrate.

498
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,329
Celebrate what?
I got a promotion.

499
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,081
And a raise. I'm gonna be reading scripts.

500
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,833
What!? That is fantastic!
Yeah.

501
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,627
Wow! I'm so happy for you!

502
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,838
Thank you. I was hoping to take you out for a screening.
I got invited by some...

503
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,256
big producer.

504
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:49,466
Can I take a rain check?

505
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,594
Yes, of course!
But I was hoping on buying you champagne.

506
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,013
Hmm, how about dinner on Wednesday?

507
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,056
Wednesday?

508
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,390
Yes OK.

509
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:58,808
Dinner it is.

510
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,810
That's great! I'll take you
out some place fancy.

511
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,731
Uh, then I gotta get dressed up
and the whole thing...

512
00:26:04,923 --> 00:26:07,108
Maybe we stay at your place?
And I can cook for us.

513
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:09,236
Really? Well...you cook?

514
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,031
Well I don't make pheasant or soufflé
or anything like that, but...

515
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,450
I can manage spaghetti and meatballs.

516
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,285
Yes! That's great.
okay.

517
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,968
Well you can play me those jazz records,
I've been dying to hear.

518
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:22,123
No! this is great.
Well my mother cooks spaghetti and meatballs.

519
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,292
When a Jew cooks, it's always over cooked.

520
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,544
They wanna be sure to kill all the germs, so...

521
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,505
I think, I'll prefer yours.

522
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:33,218
It was his first experience to a private
screening at a producer's home,

523
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,636
and it was a good movie.

524
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,847
And he wished Vonnie would
have been there to share.

525
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:41,810
But she had warned him from start
that she had a boyfriend.

526
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,589
Sorry I'm late.
There was traffic! Can you believe it?

527
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,926
Late or on time, you always look beautiful to me.
Thank you.

528
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,429
Can I have some white wine, please.
I'm sure its just the Kinder lite.

529
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,514
It is the light of the candles.

530
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,350
I made up my mind.

531
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,063
I'm gonna have a talk with Karen
as soon as she returns from Toronto.

532
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,024
Her mother is much better.

533
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,114
Are you sure, this is really what you want?

534
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,616
I can't go sneaking around,

535
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:42,454
grabbing moments with you
in hotels and dark bars.

536
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,372
I'm in love with you.

537
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:51,046
You have been saying that but I just don't
wanna feel like I've broken up your marriage.

538
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,923
I wanna be honest,

539
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:57,761
Karen and I have a long history
and not a bad one.

540
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,638
Would I walk out on her,
hadn't I met you?

541
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,223
Probably not.

542
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,351
But I did meet you.

543
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,898
Of course I wanna be with you.
I just hate the duplicity of this.

544
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:12,984
I know, it's not fair to you to live like this.

545
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,528
You been so understanding about it.

546
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,572
Too understanding, really.

547
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:21,701
I love you, Vonnie.

548
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,748
My heart beats faster when
you say that to me, it does!

549
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,085
With excitement I hope. Not anxiety.

550
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,420
Yes, with excitement.

551
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,839
I'm excited.

552
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,551
Dare I kiss you?

553
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,430
I dare you not.

554
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,729
Dear Bobby,

555
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:52,816
I understand you met some girl,
you're crazy about.

556
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:56,069
Your last letter said, she had a boyfriend.
A journalist.

557
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,279
My advice is to not give up.

558
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,990
Send her some flowers and keep trying.

559
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:05,787
I know you said, she's not the type that gets impressed
by presents but you know women appreciate little gifts..

560
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,789
Just a word to the wise...

561
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:11,418
As for Ben, he is getting involved
in the nightclub business.

562
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,962
What does he know of running a club?

563
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:18,925
I know, he's up to his neck with union problems.
But so far, he's been able to deal with them.

564
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,687
Ben Dorfman. Benny to his friends.

565
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:33,398
Ten typewriters were stolen over the weekend!

566
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:37,444
He was always in trouble with the law.
Even going back to school days.

567
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:41,281
He grew up in a Jewish neighborhood,
where most children got educated.

568
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,658
And became doctors or lawyers.

569
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,911
But not all. Some where though Jews
and picked the streets.

570
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:49,581
Harry Cantor owes me $6,000

571
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,000
You collect it for me.
I give you a third.

572
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:56,004
If you do it, this week...
I take you to Duffinetti for a nice steak.

573
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:00,842
He wasn't gonna struggle, like his father,
going through one menial job to another.

574
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:05,096
His friend Abe got 20 cents an hour
for lugging big crates of stationary.

575
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:09,517
He got 50 bucks for fixing up some
furs in the garment industry.

576
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,770
Tony Rondalino taught them
to holdup craps games.

577
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:16,316
Being illegally, when they took the money,
they couldn't go to the cops.

578
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,610
He split the money with Tony.

579
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:22,197
One night he was sitting
in his car with Tony.

580
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,115
He had enough to buy a car!

581
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:26,409
A guy came up, calm as could be...

582
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,287
put his gun through the
window and killed Tony.

583
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,540
Education in the streets, came violently.

584
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,251
Now, he and his partners own the club
'The Hangover'.

585
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,045
He wore expensive suits,

586
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:41,132
but under those suits,
he was still Benny from the streets.

587
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,553
Well have a good trip.

588
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,515
I envy you. I miss New York so much right now.

589
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,644
My business can't be without me for
too long or everyone falls apart.

590
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,478
I'm sure they do.

591
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,146
Good luck with everything.
Thank you.

592
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,129
She's coming over to cook spaghetti this week.

593
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,734
I keep...I keep deluding myself...

594
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:03,029
If I have the right wine, right music,
the right candlelight...

595
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:06,074
Oh, take it from me, she likes you
if she spends so much time with you.

596
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:07,825
Hope so.
Steve and I are rooting for you.

597
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:09,994
Thank you.
Stay in touch.

598
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:11,194
You too.

599
00:31:31,094 --> 00:31:32,194
Hello?

600
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:36,980
Hey Bobby! I wanted to tell you that
I can't make it tonight.

601
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,442
Something came up, its an emergency.
I have to re-schedule.

602
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:47,323
But I laid everything out.
I opened the wine to let it breathe.

603
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,994
Can I make it up to you?
I promise, I will.

604
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:54,994
Ok! Ow! Yeah, ok. Okay.

605
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,621
I got our anniversary present.

606
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:36,956
It's...look...

607
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,877
It's a letter written and signed by

608
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,670
Rudolph Valentino.

609
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,049
It's paper.

610
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:48,468
Our first year's papers, so...

611
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,513
I found this amazing memorabilia shop.

612
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,808
I can't do it, Vonnie.

613
00:32:58,436 --> 00:32:59,479
Can't do what?

614
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:02,774
I can't leave Karen.

615
00:33:07,604 --> 00:33:09,739
Bob, it was your idea...

616
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,616
I can't see you anymore.

617
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:17,616
No?

618
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:19,874
This is putting me in an early grave.

619
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,377
I thought I could tell her...

620
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:25,963
But Christ!
We've been married for 25 years, we have kids.

621
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,093
You don't owe me any explanation.

622
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:33,346
I can't lead a double life.
It's not fair to you.

623
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,556
Or to Karen, or to myself.

624
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:36,933
It's okay.

625
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,395
It's not that I do not love you...

626
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:43,147
It's just that...the situation is too difficult.

627
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,403
And its pointless to move on...

628
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:51,989
I...I understand.
That's what you gonna say, right?

629
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,702
Something like that.

630
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,205
Look, I know...

631
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,624
we can't just both...

632
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,085
forget that this all happened.

633
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:09,173
Your secret is safe with me,
if that's what you are worried about.

634
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,175
I would never tell anyone...

635
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,315
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

636
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,234
I'm probably too late for dinner, right?

637
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,277
Dinner? Ah, well...

638
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:30,862
Are you okay?

639
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,906
What's wrong?
I don't want to impose on you like this.

640
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:36,868
I really don't wanna do that.
No, its no imposition. What's wrong?

641
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,703
I can't stop crying, it's so stupid.

642
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,639
Well tell me what happened?
What happened?

643
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,791
My boyfriend just dumped me.

644
00:34:43,902 --> 00:34:48,254
Oh! Oh! Sorry. Was that okay?

645
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,173
Yes, it's over. It's all over.

646
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,592
Oh! I'm so sorry. What happened?

647
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:58,264
I brought him an anniversary present,
it was our paper anniversary, so, one year...

648
00:34:58,354 --> 00:35:02,226
Yeah, yeah...
It was a Valentino letter, it was beautiful...

649
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,562
it was a letter signed and written by Valentino.

650
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:05,730
That's so nice.

651
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:09,734
He cannot leave his wife. And I know that.
I've known that. He can't.

652
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,112
Its just we can't go on forever, like that.
I did not know that he was married.

653
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:17,074
Can I have a glass of white wine?
Yes! Of course.

654
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,661
I mean, if it hasn't evaporated.
Its been breathing for hours.

655
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:24,332
Whoa! Sorry, that happens in this motel.
But it should be over soon.

656
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,251
God! I never suspected
he was married, although...

657
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:29,796
I am slow to pickup on anything.

658
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:33,674
You know, that is one of your sweetest qualities,
you are very naive.

659
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:34,801
Oh! Thank you.

660
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,511
Guess you must have really loved him.

661
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,429
He was very wonderful.

662
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:39,972
Hmm...yeah, I'm sure.

663
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,518
I will forget about it.
Yeah.

664
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:46,604
Yeah, I have to be honest...

665
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:49,148
I'm...I'm in two minds,

666
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:52,985
I feel sorry for you, but I'm also glad
you don't have a boyfriend anymore.

667
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,112
But by pure selfishness.

668
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,450
I have always known
how you felt about me,

669
00:35:59,547 --> 00:36:01,118
and its been flattering.

670
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:04,163
I fell in love with you,
the first moment I laid eyes on you.

671
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,165
And I thought, you were a movie star.

672
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:10,127
Honestly, I don't think I will
ever fall in love again.

673
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,505
No! Well it will happen, you need time.

674
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:15,925
I'll get over this.
I'm not usually a fragile person,

675
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:19,095
I swear, it just that it took me by surprise.
It really did.

676
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,973
Ah! I guess there's always the risk,
if you get involved with a married man.

677
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:24,016
That's what my roommate said.

678
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,227
But he just overwhelmed me.

679
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,437
He's incredibly alive and...

680
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,731
very exciting.

681
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:34,235
Yeah! It's a very imaginative gift, you got.

682
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:37,113
For a paper letter from Rudolph Valentino.
That is very charming.

683
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,614
I...I thought so.
Yeah.

684
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,409
Maybe, next year, I'll be lucky
enough to get you a love letter

685
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,078
from your favorite actress,
Barbara Stanwyck.

686
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,124
That's sweet.

687
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:55,089
Maybe Vonnie was heart broken the way
things turned out with the affair,

688
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,633
but Bobby decidedly was not.

689
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,261
He took it upon himself with great pleasure

690
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,889
to try and help her forget of her former lover.

691
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,807
And try she did.

692
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,976
They spent weekends at the beach

693
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:09,186
and went to the movies almost every night.

694
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:11,856
I'll be there.
You go right ahead Bill, I trust you.

695
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:15,484
They visited all the great
movie palaces in Hollywood,

696
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,570
which were grand and beautiful,

697
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,697
and not very expensive.

698
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:21,866
And as time passed,

699
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:26,787
Vonnie did start to succumb to
Bobby's charm and loving attention.

700
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:30,917
And what began originally as
as a  casual friendship

701
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,045
blossomed into a genuine romance.

702
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,809
Let's move to New York.

703
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:50,603
What?

704
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,440
Yeah. What I really would like to say is:
Marry me and lets move to New York.

705
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,610
It'll be great!
We'll get a spot in Greenwich Ville.

706
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:00,404
I will find work there and I'll spoil you.

707
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:03,491
Yeah. I think it will be great.
Look, the truth is,

708
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:06,410
I've got dis-illusioned with the
whole scene out here.

709
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:10,831
I was like you, I dreamed of a house with
a swimming pool, exiting movie stars,

710
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:15,127
but really kinda of a boring,
nasty, doggy, dog industry.

711
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:18,422
Come on, lets get married and we'll
move to New York, it will be great!

712
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,134
Greenwich Village, that's where all
the poets and painters lived, right?

713
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,930
I can't promise we would ever be rich,
but I promise, we'll have each other.

714
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:28,432
And my brother, Ben, owns a nightclub.
And he has asked me to run it.

715
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,435
I do not know anything about it,
but Ben's a great guy.

716
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:33,104
And I'm a quick learner.

717
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:36,107
And at a night club isn't like
working in a drab office.

718
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:40,277
And even if you had a boyfriend,
you always had feelings for me underneath.

719
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:41,570
You have.

720
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,031
We'd make a great team in New York.

721
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,370
It sounds exciting, it really does.
Yeah.

722
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:51,789
Come here.

723
00:38:58,638 --> 00:39:01,882
Phil? What wrong?
You sounded so upset on the telephone.

724
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,509
You want a drink?

725
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:05,761
No, no thank you.
What's on your mind?

726
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:09,179
Just let me...
Yeah, sure...sure.

727
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:12,560
Are you...are you alright?

728
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,562
Why do you ask?

729
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:17,606
I don't know. Recently, you've been
smoking more and drinking more.

730
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,067
You...you have been actually crotchety at work.

731
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:22,653
I'm not alright.
I know.

732
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,489
Goodness, I hope...I hope you're not ill.

733
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:29,118
I need to talk, Bobby...

734
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:33,113
with somebody I trust.
Yes?

735
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,583
You can certainly talk to me, if you like....

736
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,001
You are family.
Yeah.

737
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,920
Yes, so whats the matter?

738
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:45,965
I've decided I'm gonna leave my wife.
Oh! Okay...

739
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:50,431
I've been back and forth about this decision
many times but the conclusion I come to:

740
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,351
I've fallen in love with another woman
and I can't live without her.

741
00:39:55,395 --> 00:40:00,107
Oh! Wow! I'm no expert in this area.
But of course these things do happen.

742
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,193
Not to me, they don't.

743
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,652
I never cheated.

744
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:06,197
I never looked at another woman in 25 years.

745
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,616
Jesus! You know Karen, she's wonderful!

746
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:09,950
Yes, she is.
She's wonderful!

747
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:12,203
Yeah, she is. I agree.

748
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,246
And then a year ago,

749
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,749
this dream, the angel...

750
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,251
dropped outta the sky.

751
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,212
I became hooked.
Well, yeah...

752
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,547
I'm saying, these platitudes, but...

753
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:27,259
but when it's right, I think you just know it.
I can vouch for that.

754
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,011
Yes, this is right.
Yes.

755
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,347
This is right!

756
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,766
And this woman loves you, I'm assuming?

757
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:35,392
I believe that she does.

758
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:38,687
Although I have jerked
her around for a year

759
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,315
telling her that I was going to leave Karen,

760
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:44,443
then I couldn't and then I would
and then I didn't.

761
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:48,239
I can't tell her I'm gonna do it again, not...

762
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,074
get her hopes up.

763
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:52,576
I just have to do it.
Hope she hasn't met someone else.

764
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,495
No, I'm sure if she really loves you...

765
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:57,039
She is much younger than I am.

766
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,875
So what is age? Nothing really anything
if you are actually in love.

767
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:04,547
I am so consumed with guilt over Karen,
because she's done nothing to alienate me.

768
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,883
She is bright and cheerful and loyal.

769
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,219
Her sex was always very good.
Oh! Nice...yeah.

770
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,388
But with this other woman, it's fantastic!

771
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:13,973
That's good. That's fantastic good, but...

772
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,685
I think people go through crises and
with time they come out ok.

773
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:20,062
I'm sure she will be fine.

774
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,231
Yes.
Yeah.

775
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:24,233
Terribly well taken.
Terribly.

776
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,735
Christ! She'll have everything I'm worth! Thats...

777
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,947
Well listen, if there's anything
I can do for you...ever...

778
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,741
I just wanted to talk.
Okay.

779
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,119
I've been carrying this knot
around my chest for a long time.

780
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:39,165
I'm sorry that you have been burdened by that.
You can always talk to me.

781
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,249
Thanks.
Yeah.

782
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:44,587
So is it true?
Hmm?

783
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,505
Maybe getting a little homesick?

784
00:41:47,116 --> 00:41:52,094
Oh! Yes, I think I needed to move away from Manhattan
to realize what a New Yorker I'm at heart.

785
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:53,345
Do you mind if I...?
No, no.

786
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,267
This is understandable.
People come out here all the time

787
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:00,436
decide life's not for them.

788
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,563
You have a girl back in New York?

789
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,900
I'm hoping I will, I do and if it works,
you can take 10% for it.

790
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,276
For what?

791
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:08,903
For introducing me to Vonnie.

792
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,906
I think she's gonna marry me
and move to Manhattan with me.

793
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:17,578
Phil Stern could not believe
what he was hearing.

794
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:20,623
He had worried that Vonnie
had found someone else

795
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:23,292
but never dreamed it was his nephew.

796
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:26,670
He had been taken with his secretary
from that first day.

797
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:27,963
Veronica Sybel.

798
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,633
I have an astroscreen English lit and drama.

799
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,551
And yes, I can type.

800
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,511
He was smitten with her face,

801
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,096
and, she was captivated

802
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:39,600
by his charm and take charge vitality.

803
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:42,603
And over the next months,
he over whelmed her,

804
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,146
took risks doing it.

805
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:46,482
I wanna send fifty roses.

806
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:48,943
That's right...yes fifty.

807
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,569
Fifty

808
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:51,820
fifty percent.

809
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,491
Yes, fifty red roses.

810
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,826
And I want the card to read...

811
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:01,247
Thanks for a fabulous weekend.

812
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:05,000
I told you you wouldn't get seasick,
with me there.

813
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:07,211
I love you. Philip.

814
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:10,547
Yeah, you know what? Make that a hundred.
A hundred red roses.

815
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:37,741
You are amazing.

816
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:40,160
No you are.
Oh! Thank you though.

817
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,704
I was in the mood.
Really?

818
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:47,626
The thought of two of us in some
great village apartments...

819
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,713
Who would have thought when
I first came out here...

820
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:51,714
I know.

821
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,341
Everybody's lives is so unpredictable.

822
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:55,634
It's funny,

823
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,387
my Uncle Phil, your former employer,

824
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:02,891
who is so dynamic and always full of confidence,
actually confided in me.

825
00:44:02,992 --> 00:44:06,186
He's...he's so hopelessly miserable, lately.

826
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:09,148
Yeah! Apparently he has been having an affair
with a woman who is very much in love with...

827
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:12,568
He has been having trouble bringing
himself to leave his wife.

828
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,821
But apparently, he is in so much
love with this other person

829
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:18,115
that he has decided to leave Karen

830
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,576
and plans to marry this other woman.

831
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,037
And he has been suffering so much

832
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:27,374
because he loves and respects his wife but
he cannot go on without this other woman.

833
00:44:27,474 --> 00:44:28,774
Yeah?
Yeah.

834
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:33,589
I didn't have the nerve to ask
if it was a movie star.

835
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:41,930
Yeah. What's...what's the matter?
He was leaving his wife...

836
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,530
Yeah.

837
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:48,354
Oh yeah! He has tried and backed down
a dozen times, but now he said,

838
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:51,940
he cannot live without this other person,
that's what he said.

839
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:55,569
So, theres no question though, here,
he's very much in love.

840
00:44:55,669 --> 00:44:56,220
Hmm?

841
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,447
What are you thinking? You seem...

842
00:44:58,781 --> 00:44:59,865
seem so lost in thought.

843
00:45:00,032 --> 00:45:01,950
I'm sorry. No, nothing.

844
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:04,745
What are you thinking?

845
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:08,791
Just nothing.

846
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:10,626
Oh no!

847
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:14,838
Oh no! I've made you nervous with my babbling
about marriage and us moving to New York.

848
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:16,006
Is that it?

849
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:17,591
I know.

850
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,176
That is quite a big thought.

851
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:20,302
It is.

852
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:21,470
Sorry.

853
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,282
You have a wonderful night.

854
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,415
Phil, we've gone over this a million times.

855
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:50,999
What are you...things have changed.
What?

856
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,918
Can we go some place and talk?

857
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:56,505
Where? Our usual dark bar?
No! Absolutely not! I work here.

858
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:58,215
I told Karen.

859
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:01,844
That was a little presumptuous, given the circumstance.
Don't you think?

860
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,387
What do you mean?

861
00:46:03,554 --> 00:46:06,682
Are you actually considering moving
to New York with my nephew?

862
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:07,850
Do you know about that?

863
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,976
Who told you?

864
00:46:09,143 --> 00:46:11,019
No secret is safe very long in this town.

865
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:12,354
Ours, was.

866
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,189
Don't tell me you changed your mind?

867
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:15,566
Oh! Hi, Louis.

868
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:19,445
Any word on the MGM thing?
Not yet. But we should know by the end the week.

869
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:25,267
Let me get that. There you go.
Thank you.

870
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,578
I love you.
Is all we meant to each other, nothing?

871
00:46:28,362 --> 00:46:32,583
No, I do not know what I think.
I'm terribly confused. Can you blame me?

872
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:33,500
No. I can't.

873
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,377
Maybe tell me, "Go to Hell".
I will understand, but...

874
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:38,005
I will kill myself, then you will
know where it's coming from.

875
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,508
First you're leaving, then you're not,
then you are, then you can't.

876
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:45,053
I never pushed you to leave her,
in fact I never even asked you to leave her over me.

877
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,722
And now you're telling me, that you left?

878
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:48,182
What am I supposed to do with that?

879
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,976
I know I've been wishy washy,
but the thought of losing...

880
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:54,313
Hi. It's is a white Ermine fur.

881
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:58,734
Oh! Can you imagine the studio requires
us to wear fur in this weather!

882
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,488
Here you go.
That's the one. Thank you.

883
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:06,074
I understand it hasn't been easy.
But if it is so hard,

884
00:47:06,283 --> 00:47:07,326
why should we have to...
Phil?

885
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:09,770
Yes? Hi!

886
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,170
You never got back to me about Bill Powell.
Oh! On what!?

887
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:14,583
William Powell in the Paramount two.
Oh! Right!

888
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,045
Yeah! I think he's gonna pass.
But I will give him a call tomorrow.

889
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:20,881
Vonnie! I don't want you working here.

890
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:24,134
I want to marry you and take care of you
for the rest of your life.

891
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:26,428
I don't believe you cooled on me so quickly!

892
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,764
And Christ sake! With who?
My nephew?

893
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,807
He's a nice kid, but where the hell is he going?

894
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:35,020
You said it yourself that it's possible
to have feelings for two people.

895
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:37,189
You love him too? I don't believe it.

896
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:38,857
Well believe it. I do.

897
00:47:39,066 --> 00:47:39,942
You love me.

898
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:42,110
I don't know. I think so.

899
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,404
I'm not sure. I'm very mixed up.

900
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:47,366
Phil, we on for lunch, Thursday?
Absolutely. Sure. Sure.

901
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:49,826
I'll bring Judy Garland.
You will love this kid.

902
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,454
And I think we can end up representing her.

903
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:54,206
Really? Ok we will bring her along..

904
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:57,000
I met Judy over Billy Wilder's party.
So I know Judy.

905
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:58,210
See you Thursday.
See you Thursday.

906
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,838
I'm not gonna stand here pleading.
I love you.

907
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,466
I have loved you for over a year.

908
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:07,761
I handled the best I could.
Maybe it was handled poorly at times.

909
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:11,473
But in the matters of heart,
people do foolish things.

910
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:16,311
Think of, of my offer.
I want you to be my wife. Now!

911
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,730
I will die if you say no.

912
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:21,316
Goin' home to talk to Karen.

913
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,985
I thought you told Karen?

914
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:28,031
I told her that I would be speaking
a very serious matter this evening.

915
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,077
Charlie, we need to talk to you
about that John Ford movie.

916
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,788
Vonnie was perplexed.

917
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:36,540
Two men were in love with her.

918
00:48:36,707 --> 00:48:39,334
One a dynamic and successful powerhouse.

919
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:42,462
The other, a younger man,
who clearly adored her.

920
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:45,048
She shared her problem with a roommate, Rosalind,

921
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:48,677
who first came down strongly
in marrying Phil Stern,

922
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:51,847
but then wavered that she found
Bobby very likable

923
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:54,391
and passionately in love with Vonnie.

924
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,479
Oh! Sorry, I thought everyone
on this floor had gone home.

925
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,481
Have a drink.
That's ok.

926
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:04,484
Go ahead. We are family.
We can drink together.

927
00:49:04,735 --> 00:49:05,652
Theres something the matter?

928
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:09,197
The part of the only family left,
I left Karen.

929
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:12,409
Did you? I hope it wasn't too painful?

930
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,620
How are things going, with you and Vonnie?

931
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:15,787
It's okay.

932
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,999
Although, she's got a little nervous, lately.

933
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,084
Did she say anything?

934
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,462
No! She's been nervous to get married,
move to New York...it's been...

935
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:25,922
So, I don't push it..
Hmm. Umm, hmm

936
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:28,884
But although she loves me,
I know, she loves me,

937
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:31,011
and I truly believe she's looking
forward to marrying me,

938
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:33,889
because there were ever two people
meant for each other...

939
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:38,143
Cmon! Don't look so glum.

940
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,103
I'm sure your situation
will work itself out too. 

941
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,148
Although I guess, it would have been
prudent before you talk to Karen.

942
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:46,068
Don't lecture me on being prudent! Please!

943
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:50,072
I understand timing!
Timing is everything in life.

944
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:53,075
The worst mistake you can make in business,
is being pre-mature.

945
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,327
Oh! Yeah, I know that...
Just remember!

946
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:58,497
If you marry her, I'm looking for my 10%.

947
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:00,290
Okay, it's a deal.

948
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:04,670
I don't wanna ask you, who you are in love with.
I guess it's some ravishing movie star?

949
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,046
No. She's not a movie star.

950
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,674
I'm not shallow.

951
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,386
I...I'm not seduced by cheap glamor.

952
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:15,138
I value substance and character.
Who the hell do you think I am?

953
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:19,685
I wasn't implying anything like that.
I was just thought it might be Hedy Lamarr,

954
00:50:19,761 --> 00:50:22,270
because how much she adores you.
What!? All of your clients do.

955
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:25,065
That's...that's what makes you such a success.

956
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,986
That was a gift. I had it framed.

957
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:33,615
It's a love letter from Rudolph Valentino.

958
00:50:33,824 --> 00:50:36,993
She gave me on our one year anniversary.
Which is paper.

959
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:50,048
Hi! What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

960
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:53,176
Are you going to marry me,
or my Uncle Phil?

961
00:50:58,348 --> 00:51:00,100
I'm gonna marry Phil.

962
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:21,037
It's how nice to get together for Seder.

963
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,832
I have to say, selfishly,

964
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:27,002
it's so nice that you're
back from Hollywood.

965
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:29,171
And we are all together again.

966
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,715
So much for your brother
taking him under his wing!

967
00:51:31,882 --> 00:51:35,719
Phil is helping him.
But he didn't take to, out there.

968
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:36,845
I knew you hate it out there.

969
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:41,266
If only wish my brother,Phil was in New York.
So that he could come tonight.

970
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,310
I love to meet his new wife.

971
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:44,686
Wouldn't you, Martin?

972
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:48,273
I don't have to.
You know how I feel about your brother.

973
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,275
He is not a Jewish man!

974
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:54,696
What kinda man throws out
his wife after 25 years,

975
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:57,657
and run off with a 25 year-old secretary?

976
00:51:57,824 --> 00:52:02,204
I hate to tell you,
how many go with their secretaries.

977
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,414
Bobby says she was really beautiful.

978
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,291
So is looks everything!?

979
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,169
Where's character? Where's loyalty?

980
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:12,322
(SPEAKS IN HEBREW)

981
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:14,633
You're not a beauty contest winner
but I stuck with you.

982
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,884
Enough wine for you.

983
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:17,427
Look is an emotion.

984
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,137
And emotions are not rational.

985
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:21,264
You fall in love. You fall.

986
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:22,641
You lose control.

987
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:25,101
Leonard...
I have dated many wonderful women,

988
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:28,980
but the minute I laid my eyes on your daughter,
I knew Evelyn was for me.

989
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,482
It was pure luck!

990
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:34,486
If my cab driver hadn't driven through
the plate glass roof of that restaurant,

991
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:36,613
I would never have met Leonard.

992
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,032
He was having coffee.
We barreled right under him.

993
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,116
I didn't spill.

994
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:42,452
Bobby, you met her.

995
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:44,412
Is she so fabulous?

996
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,082
She is very lovely.

997
00:52:47,171 --> 00:52:50,418
She one of those stuck-up
Hollywood movie queens?

998
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:53,338
No, she's a very down to Earth girl.
You will probably like her.

999
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:54,798
I think she will be good for Phil.

1000
00:52:54,874 --> 00:52:56,758
So, I think daddy is right.

1001
00:52:56,925 --> 00:53:01,096
A wife is not like a car.
You just don't trade or rent for the latest model.

1002
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:04,516
Our next door neighbor just kicked
out his wife for a cheap stripper

1003
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:06,268
and knocked her teeth out.

1004
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:07,394
Hmm, he's a lunatic.

1005
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:10,313
We live next door to a crazy man.
I'm scared of him.

1006
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,648
He pushed Leonard.

1007
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:13,108
He didn't push me.

1008
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,902
He is a hot head, he bumped me.

1009
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:18,238
I was trying to explain,
he was blocking our drive way.

1010
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:20,240
Some people only understand
a punch in the nose.

1011
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:23,869
That's not Leonard's style.
Leonard thinks everyone can be reasoned with.

1012
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,830
But we have to accept the
premise of common humanity,

1013
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:29,457
otherwise you are in the
jungle with beasts.

1014
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,127
The idea is always in
getting the first punch.

1015
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:33,420
there's no way for the other guy.

1016
00:53:33,587 --> 00:53:35,630
How do you like working
for your big brother?

1017
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:37,883
I am very lucky. Thank you.

1018
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:41,720
When you came home,
you were a lost soul for a while.

1019
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:44,472
Well I like working at night club.
It's very lively.

1020
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,685
He took to it like fish in water, you should
see him took the room, everyone likes him.

1021
00:53:48,852 --> 00:53:50,186
Not like that first manager.

1022
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,315
Deadbeat wound up stealing for Neil.

1023
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:55,650
He's not around anymore.

1024
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:10,457
Bobby looked up his socialite friends,
Rad Taylor and her husband Steve.

1025
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:15,420
They came to the club and spread the word
with the beautiful models she worked with.

1026
00:54:15,587 --> 00:54:17,422
She got Bobby to redecorate

1027
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:20,258
and change the name of the club,
to more shi-shi....

1028
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:22,177
The Tropic? I love it!

1029
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:25,472
It sounds upscale, international and hot.

1030
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:27,223
I've you who to thank.

1031
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:33,146
Soon 'The Tropic' was known as the place
to always find the driest Martinis

1032
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:35,565
and the prettiest women in Manhattan.

1033
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:39,611
Beautiful girls attracted
celebrities and sports figures.

1034
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:42,364
Socialites mingled with politicians.

1035
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,950
And with the smart set came the Press

1036
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,494
and an ever growing reputation.

1037
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:51,998
And Bobby moved more and more gracefully
amongst the rich and famous.

1038
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:55,085
He learned the ins and outs of
'The Café Society'

1039
00:54:55,251 --> 00:55:00,548
which included any number of prominent figures
from New York's glamorous underworld.

1040
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:07,389
There were the Rhinebeck, came home every night,
to order the finest wines in the world.

1041
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:09,557
They seemed like an ideal couple.

1042
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,477
Except that he was sleeping
with his wife's sister.

1043
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:18,066
And there was no shortage of
Royalty from all over Europe.

1044
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:22,112
Like, Count Henrick Van Goren
who played backgammon for millions.

1045
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,239
And his wife, Countess Van Goren,

1046
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:27,993
who is actually Chickie Sherman
from Passaic, New Jersey.

1047
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:30,620
And that ring on Suzy Bancroft's finger

1048
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:32,831
was a mere 41 carats.

1049
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:36,501
And of course with the elite
came the tabloid scandals,

1050
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:39,129
like Tom Price, the Wall Street genius,

1051
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:43,341
who married the much taller
automobile heiress Linda Ray Harmon.

1052
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:46,511
He ran through a fortune on
race horses and show girls,

1053
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:48,471
until one day, out hunting,

1054
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:50,432
she mistook him for a deer.

1055
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:55,603
And Bobby met them all and shook
their hands and joked with them,

1056
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,897
and heard their sad and happy stories,

1057
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,817
over $1000 Magnums Piper-Heidsieck.

1058
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:02,402
And learned about life

1059
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:06,322
and how in the end,
Rodgers & Hart had it right.

1060
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:11,369
It is so beautiful out here.
And you two have been so great to me.

1061
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:14,956
Oh please! Don't suddenly be
revoltingly sacrament.

1062
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:17,709
You know, your wife hates
to show any emotion.

1063
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:22,088
But your friendship has
meant so much to me...it has.

1064
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:25,300
And Steve, you brought me such
a brilliant financial advisor.

1065
00:56:25,467 --> 00:56:27,802
I know you play up in the millions,
but I'll hold up on the league.

1066
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:31,598
But at the rate I'm going, you may see me
apply for membership at your Golf Club..

1067
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:34,851
To get into his club,
you gotta be a lawyer or a broker,

1068
00:56:35,018 --> 00:56:36,770
and you can't be uncircumcised.

1069
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:39,522
Well, if for nothing else,
I owe you everything.

1070
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:42,692
And I can never repay you
for introducing me

1071
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:44,986
to the most wonderful thing of all...

1072
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:46,112
my wife.

1073
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:47,614
Enter enqueue!

1074
00:56:47,781 --> 00:56:51,284
He was just gonna tell us again,
how lucky Gershwin tuned in, and you walked in.

1075
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:52,368
Stop!

1076
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:54,412
Hi darling. How's you martini?

1077
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,663
Good! You caught me talkin' about you.

1078
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,499
Bobby had found a wife.

1079
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:01,461
After sort of unsatisfying
flirtations and affairs

1080
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:04,672
one night at the club,
in walked in a group.

1081
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:07,342
And his eye was caught on
an elegant young blond.

1082
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:09,135
That's Veronica Hayes.

1083
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:10,845
She just got divorced.

1084
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:13,640
Her husband left for her best friend.
It came as a shock to her.

1085
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:14,474
My Goodness...

1086
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:16,059
She's a great girl.
Yeah?

1087
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,144
We all felt so bad for her.

1088
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:20,772
Maybe we can cheer her up.
You introduce me to her?

1089
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,149
Hi. Veronica! You look beautiful!
You too.

1090
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:24,734
Delighted to see you.
You too.

1091
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:27,570
I like you to meet Bobby Dorfman.
He runs the place.

1092
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,864
I do. I do.
Is this your first time here?

1093
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,951
Yes. yes. The papers are right,
It's got real electricity in here.

1094
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:33,952
It does, right?

1095
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:35,912
We are happy to have you.
Thank you.

1096
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:38,414
Great! My Goodness...she's single?

1097
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:40,375
Beauty! Yes! Yes!
That's in a criminal sense.

1098
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:42,043
So out on your way...
Yes. Yes.

1099
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:43,795
Excuse me. Excuse me?

1100
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,089
What are you doing later?

1101
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:47,215
Later?

1102
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:49,843
There is no later! It's 1:30.

1103
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,928
Yeah! I get off in half an hour.

1104
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:54,430
I'm usually in pajamas by 2:00.

1105
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:56,432
See...I love pajamas.

1106
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:58,184
Ah! What side of the bed do you like?

1107
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,936
Slow down!

1108
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:02,021
He is pushier than you.
See?

1109
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:04,941
My God!
Come on, guys...cmon!

1110
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:09,445
Hey! Do you like jazz music?

1111
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:10,613
At 2:00 in the morning?

1112
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,782
At any time in the morning.

1113
00:58:12,949 --> 00:58:15,034
Yeah! Your name is Veronica, right?
Yeah.

1114
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:17,620
Anybody ever call you Vonnie for short?

1115
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:18,788
Not usually. No.

1116
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:20,290
It's a pretty name...you should.
Thank you.

1117
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,293
But...but do you like jazz, then?
Yes.

1118
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:25,837
Yes?
I love Jazz.

1119
00:58:26,129 --> 00:58:27,463
Well it's fate.
Yes, I would say.

1120
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:29,716
Who doesn't love jazz?

1121
00:58:29,883 --> 00:58:31,467
I met one woman.

1122
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:32,594
That's terrible.
Yeah.

1123
00:58:48,193 --> 00:58:49,485
Oh! This is great.
Hmm.

1124
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,322
I love another Scotch.
Yeah. Sure.

1125
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:55,950
To my one regret in life that
I can't play an instrument.

1126
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:58,995
I knew a sedated musician.
Oh! Did you?

1127
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:01,664
Yeah. Sax player, very brilliant.

1128
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:05,001
He played those sad songs
with so much feeling.

1129
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:06,669
He could make you cry.
Hmm.

1130
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:08,129
That's a great gift.

1131
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:10,506
I would have married him but he was a dope addict.
Really?

1132
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:13,259
You see, I don't really like dope.
It messes you up.

1133
00:59:13,426 --> 00:59:15,637
I tried it a few times when I was with him.
Did you?

1134
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:18,765
We even tried reefers and I tried opium.

1135
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,976
Look at you!
What was the...I can't hear. What was the effect?

1136
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:25,563
Oh! No, I didn't like it.
I'm not an addicted personality.

1137
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,981
It was good?
It was good. Yeah.

1138
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:29,442
But Mongols made me feel sexy.

1139
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:31,694
The Mongols?
The reefers.

1140
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:34,530
But you called them, what?
He did.

1141
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:36,366
So you married a musician?
Hmm.

1142
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:38,868
I married a stock broker.
Hmm.

1143
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:40,203
But you divorced though.

1144
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,331
He divorced me because
my best friend was better in bed.

1145
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:44,874
Was she?
Yep. I guess.

1146
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,668
Well you should have saved
some of the Mongols.

1147
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:50,964
I learned too late grinding
late with a few drinks.

1148
00:59:52,215 --> 00:59:54,092
So what do you...what do you do?

1149
00:59:54,259 --> 00:59:56,261
I work at the City Hall at the Mayor's Office.

1150
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:58,346
Really...in what?
Public relations.

1151
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:00,223
I hope you don't mind a Democratic liberal?
No, no.

1152
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:04,060
My family are Democ...
We are Jews. Goes...

1153
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:05,353
How quaint!
Thank you.

1154
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,689
Please write in my rebellious streak.

1155
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:11,234
You know in Oklahoma, we weren't even
allowed to mingle with Jews growing up.

1156
01:00:11,401 --> 01:00:12,735
Really!
You guys are money lenders.

1157
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:14,529
No, we control everything, actually.

1158
01:00:14,696 --> 01:00:17,282
I didn't even see a Jew
until I moved to New York.

1159
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:18,700
No...no horns.
No.

1160
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:22,078
I find Jews exotic  and mysterious.

1161
01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:23,871
It wouldn't mind, if you had horns.

1162
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:25,081
You wouldn't?
Nah.

1163
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:28,084
Come on. Let's go. Let's go to my house.
What?

1164
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,420
No! I'm not gonna sleep with you.
No?

1165
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:32,672
No! Jew or no Jew, we just met.

1166
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:34,924
Yeah, have one or more drinks.

1167
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:39,012
No thank you. You'll have to wait!
My Goodness!

1168
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:43,933
My God! It's true what they say!
You people are pushy.

1169
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:46,060
Its part of the charm.

1170
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:56,612
I had a great time tonight.
Yeah, me too.

1171
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,990
Well good. You call me again?

1172
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:00,116
Yes I will.

1173
01:01:00,283 --> 01:01:01,909
I'll call you tomorrow.

1174
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:04,871
As it is tomorrow,
I'll call you in 15 minutes.

1175
01:01:05,038 --> 01:01:06,831
So you probably might head home.

1176
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,293
Good night.
Okay.

1177
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:23,431
And all that season,
they saw one another every single day.

1178
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:25,641
And it was a beautiful summer.

1179
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,518
Thank you, Rad. This is the last one.

1180
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:31,105
Then one Saturday afternoon,
some months later,

1181
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,565
she had an announcement...

1182
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:33,941
I am pregnant.
No.

1183
01:01:34,296 --> 01:01:39,781
Yes really. Are you crushed?
No!

1184
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:43,618
No, no. I'm not crushed at all.
It's wonderful.

1185
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:46,120
What's our next move?

1186
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,206
Why I would like to have the baby.
Okay.

1187
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:52,835
Unless you don't want me to.
We could go down Mexico and get done safely.

1188
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:55,213
Vonnie, we are not going to Mexico but...

1189
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,924
we are going to Niagara Falls, anywhere.

1190
01:01:58,508 --> 01:02:01,386
Are you sure is this what you want?
Yes of course.

1191
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:04,972
When we call the little one a bastard,
you don't want them right. Do you?

1192
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,641
You called me Vonnie.
Did I?

1193
01:02:06,808 --> 01:02:08,393
Yeah. You never call me that.

1194
01:02:09,477 --> 01:02:11,979
If I did, it's too much champagne.

1195
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,899
That's what you said your
old girlfriend was called?

1196
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:18,152
Well...OK. Two Veronicas.

1197
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,196
What do you want me to say? I'm lucky.

1198
01:02:20,363 --> 01:02:21,781
Are you gonna marry me or not?

1199
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:23,616
Yes! Yes of course.
Ok! Good.

1200
01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:24,992
That's the right answer.

1201
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:26,869
I'm having a baby!
I love you.

1202
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:27,870
The wedding,

1203
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:32,208
which was a simple affair,
and took place in City Hall two months later

1204
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,793
was a happy event.

1205
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,131
But as Bobby's brother-in-law said:
Life has it's own agenda.

1206
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:41,384
Yes, what do you want?
Ah! What!?

1207
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:46,389
Could you just turn the radio down,
just a little?

1208
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:50,184
I'm not asking you to turn it off,
but my wife gets these migraines.

1209
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:53,646
Don't tell me how to play my radio.
Just your nose out of our business!

1210
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:56,232
She rarely gets them.
Just every now and then.

1211
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:58,109
I am just asking if you can lower it.

1212
01:02:58,401 --> 01:02:59,986
Shes sick. Call your doctor!

1213
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:04,198
Believe me! He did give her something.
Migraines are a terrible curse.

1214
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:08,453
I work hard, I'm gonna listen to my radio.
You don't like it? Too bad!

1215
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:09,662
You are not understanding.

1216
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:13,749
I not asking you not to play it.
Modulate the sound just a little.

1217
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,460
I don't wanna call the police.

1218
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:18,504
You think I'm afraid of the police?

1219
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:20,715
I can play my radio!

1220
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:23,468
What can I say?
He's got the law on his side.

1221
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:25,761
I'm gonna have brother Ben talk to him.

1222
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,265
What!? Ben is a hothead.
I am not looking for trouble.

1223
01:03:29,432 --> 01:03:31,225
Promise me he will not make it into a issue.

1224
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:32,935
He makes this into an issue.

1225
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,313
He needs somebody to read his right act!

1226
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,815
Let's drop it, Evelyn.
It's not that big a deal.

1227
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:40,401
Yeah! You don't have the migraines!

1228
01:03:42,612 --> 01:03:45,281
Bobby and Veronica named the baby Susan.

1229
01:03:45,448 --> 01:03:48,826
And that fall found the perfect
house on the Hudson.

1230
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:50,953
We called the police and they spoke with him.

1231
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,290
And last week, he was drunk,
and puts a dent in our car.

1232
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:57,335
When Leonard speaks in him,
he threatens to beat him up.

1233
01:03:57,502 --> 01:03:58,461
He did?

1234
01:03:58,628 --> 01:04:00,379
I can talk to this character.

1235
01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:02,298
Leonard doesn't want trouble.

1236
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:06,177
But I want someone to tell him,
we can't stand to this anymore.

1237
01:04:06,344 --> 01:04:09,222
And to stop making our lives miserable.

1238
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:12,016
He accuses us of things we never done.

1239
01:04:12,475 --> 01:04:14,519
He threatened to shoot our dog.

1240
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:15,853
He is a crazy man!

1241
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,982
And my husband keeps deluding himself
that he will listen to reason,

1242
01:04:20,149 --> 01:04:21,651
meanwhile, it never stops!
Whoo!

1243
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,486
Threatens to shoot your dog?

1244
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:25,112
I think he has got a gun.

1245
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,657
There is a security guard 
at a lumber yard.

1246
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:30,034
Joe Wojehowitz.

1247
01:04:47,268 --> 01:04:49,512
Hey! You Joe Wojehowitz?
Who wants to know?

1248
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:51,097
Are you Joe Wojehowitz?

1249
01:04:51,264 --> 01:04:52,306
Yeah. What?

1250
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:56,477
Hey Joe! Get in the car.
What!?

1251
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:58,479
What are you doin'?
Get in the car. We wanna talk.

1252
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:00,481
What are you talkin' about?
Get in the car!

1253
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:04,834
What are you doing? Get off!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1254
01:05:20,022 --> 01:05:22,022
(MOUNTAIN GREENERY BY RICHARD RODGERS)

1255
01:05:22,122 --> 01:05:34,022
* In a mountain greenery where God paints the scenery *
* just two grazy people together *

1256
01:05:34,122 --> 01:05:40,722
* While you love your lover *
* let blues skies be your coverlet *

1257
01:05:40,822 --> 01:05:41,422
* When it rains... *

1258
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:46,027
Café Society was called, when Bobby Dorfman
was ridin' the thick of it.

1259
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:49,488
There were these millionaire playboys
like Buddy Winslow Fain,

1260
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,198
who bought anything he wanted,

1261
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:55,328
from the high class models of every
cover on a magazine in town

1262
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:58,789
to the best seats in
shows and sporting events.

1263
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:00,541
Then there were the politicians,

1264
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:04,462
who fixed your streets, your parking tickets
and your tax returns.

1265
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:07,423
As long as the contributions kept coming in.

1266
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:13,304
There was Norton Lockerbee and his
underage fiancé, the dancer Cherry Grace.

1267
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:15,765
And the Remsens, about whom it was said

1268
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:19,226
had stayed a week in Berlin
at the home of Adolf Hitler.

1269
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:22,938
And of course, there are any number
of colorful associates of Ben's,

1270
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:27,193
some of whom were destined to
end up on the front pages of the tabloids,

1271
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,238
reeking blood on the side walk
due to cranial ventilation.

1272
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:35,242
It seems Bobby knew everyone
in Manhattan society.

1273
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:37,912
His wife Veronica now rarely came in,

1274
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:40,498
having succumb to the joys of motherhood.

1275
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:41,749
And then one evening,

1276
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,043
in walked the past.

1277
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:55,221
May I help you?

1278
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:59,350
Yes. I understand my nephews around here.
They own the place.

1279
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:00,476
Mr.Dorfman?

1280
01:07:00,643 --> 01:07:01,936
Bobby, yes. Or Ben.

1281
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:04,522
Bobby is not there but Ben is around.

1282
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:05,731
You like to be seated?
Please.

1283
01:07:05,631 --> 01:07:07,341
Follow me.
After you, dear. Thank you.

1284
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:08,734
Had a very big deal today.

1285
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:11,946
Champagne for the table!
Before they start drinking for real.

1286
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:14,448
Of course.
Fred, how are you? Good to see you.

1287
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:16,117
You remember Vonnie.
Lovely to see you again.

1288
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:19,036
We are in town for a few weeks.
We'll catch up.

1289
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:24,542
It's going to be a very good stock.
I'm tellin' you it's goin' through the roof.

1290
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:26,794
Now is the time to get in on it.
But you didn't hear it here!

1291
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,254
In here what?
Exactly.

1292
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:29,588
Thank you, Marvin.

1293
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:32,007
There are some people to see you.
They say they know you.

1294
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:33,050
Really?

1295
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:34,135
Table 4.

1296
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:35,761
OK. Everybody knows me.

1297
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:45,980
Robert! How you doing?

1298
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:47,606
You remember Vonnie?
Hello.

1299
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:51,152
And this is Gloria and Craig Bennett.
Hello. Good evening.

1300
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:54,697
Have a seat. Join us.

1301
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:58,325
Oh! I wish I could,
but I'm very busy tonight.

1302
01:07:58,492 --> 01:07:59,535
Woh! I can see!

1303
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:02,163
This place has a reputation
all the way across the country.

1304
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,164
Please. Join us.

1305
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,915
Sit down for five minutes.
You're not gonna offend us.

1306
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:06,208
Five minutes. Cmon.

1307
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:12,631
Look at you.
You look well.

1308
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:13,924
He does look well.

1309
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:18,053
Well we are celebrating because I just 
made a deal for Irene Dunne at Universal.

1310
01:08:18,304 --> 01:08:19,054
Oh! I just love her.

1311
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:20,848
How does she break?

1312
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:23,058
She is great, honestly.

1313
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,270
He has a great story on Irene Dunne.
Sorry, honey.

1314
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:28,314
Tell her, tell her.
No, you tell her.

1315
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:31,859
Ok! So we met Irene first
at the Coconut Grove.

1316
01:08:32,026 --> 01:08:35,696
We were with Errol Flynn and
one of his gorgeous young discoveries,

1317
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:37,406
as he likes to call them.

1318
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:39,033
And so...you know,

1319
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,327
his reputation is not so great,

1320
01:08:41,494 --> 01:08:43,537
but we adore him, he's lovely.

1321
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:47,208
He welcomed us off in Catalina on his yacht,
and he couldn't have been a more gracious host.

1322
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:49,293
And Irene, is...

1323
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,544
a bit...

1324
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:54,381
gorgeous in person. Proper.

1325
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,258
So, we were at Busby Berkeley's party and,

1326
01:08:56,425 --> 01:08:59,053
she was asked to have a puff of a cigar.

1327
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:01,889
It was as if she was asked
to take her clothes off!

1328
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:03,974
She was absolutely mortified.

1329
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,894
And then Errol leans in and introduces
us to this teenage starlet.

1330
01:09:07,061 --> 01:09:09,939
And then she asks if she is his daughter.

1331
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:12,525
Without missing a beat,
Errol looks at her and says:

1332
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:16,028
No...my granddaughter.

1333
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,073
I died! Died!

1334
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:21,367
And then in London, he was mobbed.

1335
01:09:21,534 --> 01:09:24,370
I didn't know but he is
a great hero to the British.

1336
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:26,747
I love London.
I could live there.

1337
01:09:26,914 --> 01:09:27,748
So damn civilized.
Really?

1338
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:29,750
I love it. But I love Paris, more.
Yes.

1339
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:33,254
And Venice. We keep fowling to get a place there.
We do...

1340
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,256
Bob Montgomery and his wife had one.

1341
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:36,674
Have you ever met them?

1342
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:40,052
They are lovely.
Just a gorgeous, gorgeous couple.

1343
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,346
Little Bobby...

1344
01:09:43,556 --> 01:09:44,974
Wow! You really made it big, Robert.

1345
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:47,601
I always knew you make it
one way or another.

1346
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:51,772
I was breaking this kid as an agent
and he said he preferred New York.

1347
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:53,774
Which I completely understand.

1348
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:58,779
You know, you'll have to excuse me.
I didn't expect a madhouse tonight.

1349
01:09:58,946 --> 01:10:00,823
We will be in town, 4-5 weeks.

1350
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,492
Oh! And congratulations
on becoming a young dad!

1351
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:04,910
Aw! Absolutely!

1352
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:08,455
Hey Frank, let me have a scotch.

1353
01:10:08,555 --> 01:10:10,274
Hey Bobby! How's your wife?

1354
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:12,585
Oh! Good. She's fine, thank you.

1355
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:13,961
Never see her around anymore.

1356
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:16,380
You know, she's has become very domestic,
since our daughter came.

1357
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:17,756
Yeah. That's what happens.

1358
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:20,426
They become mothers, and everything falls off.

1359
01:10:20,593 --> 01:10:22,261
If you know what I mean.
No, right.

1360
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:24,138
Because of the hormones.

1361
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:25,931
Sometimes they never come back.

1362
01:10:26,098 --> 01:10:28,976
Suddenly, it's diapers all I see.
Night. Night.

1363
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,271
Listen.

1364
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:35,816
If you say I told you, I'll deny it.

1365
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:39,445
But the District Attorney's Office
has had a serious discussion,

1366
01:10:39,612 --> 01:10:41,030
about your brother

1367
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:43,532
... and his business friends.

1368
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:44,867
Meaning?

1369
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:46,994
I don't know yet,

1370
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:50,247
but it's possible things could get hot.

1371
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,041
So, I'm just givin' you a heads up.

1372
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:54,501
Thank you. Can you do something about it?

1373
01:10:55,628 --> 01:10:58,005
Can I help if we had a clean Mayor?.

1374
01:10:58,189 --> 01:11:00,549
Alright so what are they looking at?

1375
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:05,262
Racketeering, extortion, tax evasion...
Hmm.

1376
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:08,015
Maybe worse for Ben.

1377
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,559
My advice to your brother:

1378
01:11:10,893 --> 01:11:13,187
is to go some place for a while.
Yeah.

1379
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:15,564
He likes Havana.

1380
01:11:15,782 --> 01:11:18,651
Yeah, I'll definitely tell him, thank you.

1381
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:20,402
Yeah thank you for the heads-up.

1382
01:11:24,109 --> 01:11:25,866
Hey! Are you looking for something?

1383
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:28,369
Just you. Wanted to say hello.

1384
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:30,746
Yah! Are you kidding me?

1385
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:32,206
Meaning what?

1386
01:11:32,665 --> 01:11:34,458
Meaning, you should listen to yourself?

1387
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:39,004
You've become everything you poked fun,
that you couldn't stand.

1388
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:40,673
Well you know...

1389
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:45,636
time passes, life moves on.

1390
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:46,845
People change.

1391
01:11:47,096 --> 01:11:49,139
Yes, but all that talk of the simple life...

1392
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:52,267
It would be comical if you weren't so sad.

1393
01:11:54,186 --> 01:11:57,773
Well you are not necessarily
the same person either.

1394
01:11:58,817 --> 01:12:01,402
No, no...yes you're right.

1395
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,320
Yeah, life moves on, people...

1396
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:04,905
yeah, people grow.

1397
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:06,949
Have lunch with me.

1398
01:12:07,116 --> 01:12:11,161
Right you can impress me with name dropping
and all the fancy parties you've to go to?

1399
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:14,456
No, I'll behave myself and not
babble on like a Hollywood wife,

1400
01:12:14,623 --> 01:12:18,168
if you promise going easy on me
for running off with Phil.

1401
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:22,381
Let's just...let's just turn back
the clock and take a walk..

1402
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:23,924
You can do it.

1403
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:25,759
Phil's on business and
I have a lotta time on my hands.

1404
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:28,554
I'm dying to know,
what's going on with you.

1405
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:32,307
I'll say, you are still

1406
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:34,101
amazingly beautiful.

1407
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:42,985
I haven't seen our next door
neighbor quite a while.

1408
01:12:43,152 --> 01:12:44,361
Maybe he's away.

1409
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:48,282
He's always out watering the lawn.
It's getting brown.

1410
01:12:48,449 --> 01:12:50,409
And his mail is piling up.

1411
01:12:50,576 --> 01:12:52,119
You think somethings wrong?

1412
01:12:52,286 --> 01:12:54,788
You think he's on the floor with
a heart attack or somethin'?

1413
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,917
Listen, count your blessing!
Serves him right if he drops dead.

1414
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,253
Don't say that! Take that back.

1415
01:13:01,462 --> 01:13:03,297
Do I ask the police come check?

1416
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:06,008
I wouldn't. It's not our business.

1417
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:07,468
Of course, it's our business.

1418
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:09,595
People are responsible for one another,

1419
01:13:09,762 --> 01:13:11,388
even the louse.

1420
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:13,474
I go if I were you.

1421
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:15,517
What's that supposed to mean?

1422
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,228
Is there something you're not tellin' me?

1423
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:22,149
I'm worried, Leonard.

1424
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,109
Why, Evelyn?

1425
01:13:24,526 --> 01:13:26,820
Oh God! I...
Is there something I don't know about?

1426
01:13:28,697 --> 01:13:30,532
I may have done something wrong.

1427
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:32,743
What are you keeping from me?

1428
01:13:34,036 --> 01:13:36,163
When we saw Veronica and Bobby's baby,

1429
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:39,249
I told Ben that we were having a lotta
problems with our neighbor...

1430
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:41,460
and the police were not very helpful.

1431
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:42,586
Ben?

1432
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:45,172
I was scared of him, Leonard!

1433
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:46,799
We have a child.

1434
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:48,342
He was a volatile neighbor,

1435
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:50,928
he was a drinker, he was nasty.

1436
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:55,099
He constantly made trouble, he was a security guard,
so I know he owned a gun.

1437
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:57,684
Who knows if he fly off the handle!

1438
01:13:58,936 --> 01:14:01,438
What!? You didn't have Ben threaten him?

1439
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:02,940
Or, or, or hurt them?

1440
01:14:03,107 --> 01:14:05,484
I just asked Ben, if he could talk to him.

1441
01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:09,154
You tried speaking to him.
but you're so mild mannered!

1442
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:13,408
I thought Ben would tell him
if he didn't start behaving himself...

1443
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:15,077
What Evelyn?

1444
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:16,912
He would start breaking his legs?

1445
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:17,871
Has he broken his legs?

1446
01:14:18,038 --> 01:14:21,083
I just asked Ben to talk to him.

1447
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,251
What!?

1448
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:25,129
Ben is a thug. Ben is a gangster.

1449
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,381
So what did he do?
Did he put him in the hospital?

1450
01:14:27,548 --> 01:14:29,299
I do not know, Leonard.

1451
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:30,717
And I don't wanna know.

1452
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:32,010
It's wrong.

1453
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:33,262
It's wrong.

1454
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:36,014
Is it a proportionate response

1455
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:38,767
that this guy is laying
in the hospital, all beat up?

1456
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:47,192
It's delicious.
Hmm.

1457
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:49,027
And I love this place.

1458
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:52,906
Reminds me of our little Mexican joint.
It's a dump!

1459
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:53,824
It is.

1460
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:57,452
I know it's not the Brown Derby, you know.
Or Busby Berkeley's party,

1461
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:00,247
You are running into Fred Astaire.

1462
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:04,001
How's your wife. Tell me about her.
I'm curious.

1463
01:15:04,782 --> 01:15:06,128
Oh! She is lovely.

1464
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:07,546
What's her name?

1465
01:15:07,838 --> 01:15:08,922
Veronica.

1466
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:10,924
No it's not!
It is.

1467
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:13,844
Stop it!
It's Veronica, she pronounces it differently.

1468
01:15:15,762 --> 01:15:17,306
I'm flattered.
I know...

1469
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,099
life is a comedy

1470
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,602
written by a sadistic comedy writer though.

1471
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:24,146
I loved you and you decided
to marry my uncle,

1472
01:15:24,313 --> 01:15:26,398
which makes you...my aunt. Oh God!

1473
01:15:27,774 --> 01:15:28,942
Aunt Vonnie.

1474
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:32,362
I think I still have a crush on you, Aunt Vonnie.

1475
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:35,782
I'm in here.

1476
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:37,117
Hi!
Hi.

1477
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:40,662
What is that?

1478
01:15:42,122 --> 01:15:43,540
Flowers!?
Yes, yes, yes.

1479
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:47,085
I can't believe you got me flowers.
Why?Why?

1480
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:48,378
What's the occasion!?
What's the occasion?

1481
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:51,924
The occasion is that I haven't
got you flowers in a long time.

1482
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:55,010
Well, you have been up mood all weekend on flowers.
Yeah.

1483
01:15:55,177 --> 01:15:57,387
Did your number just come in?
Or are you guilty of something?

1484
01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:58,081
Well look at that!

1485
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:00,641
A husband can't get his wife wife flowers
without getting the 3rd Degree.

1486
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,392
No. I love them.
Ok.

1487
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:03,685
Of course you can.

1488
01:16:03,936 --> 01:16:04,853
Ok. I love you.

1489
01:16:05,646 --> 01:16:06,563
Thank you.

1490
01:16:09,483 --> 01:16:13,820
With Phil busy, Bobby used every
excuse to spend time with Vonnie.

1491
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,907
He took her to Manhattan,
showed her Coney Island.

1492
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:21,453
And when she remembered she still owed him that
dinner she never gotta cook for him in Hollywood,

1493
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,789
he arranged for her to do it downtown.

1494
01:16:23,956 --> 01:16:26,541
I hope that it's perfect.
I make it the same every time,

1495
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:30,254
but I've been going about it for years now,
I hope it's good.

1496
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:34,591
Listen, I know it will be perfect.
If not we'll go back in the kitchen.

1497
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:36,677
Oh! You cooked the whole thing!
You can put that Giacomo cheese on it.

1498
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:40,305
I know it will be fine.
In fact I've known Pugioni for years, am I right?

1499
01:16:40,472 --> 01:16:42,015
Long time.
How long, Vito?

1500
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:43,183
A real long.
A real long.

1501
01:16:43,517 --> 01:16:47,813
For me, it's a really long time.
So good that you finally made on your promise.

1502
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,147
And cooked for me.
Good wine here.

1503
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,191
Such a great idea.

1504
01:16:51,358 --> 01:16:52,401
Taste it.
Ok.

1505
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:54,736
You don't have to lie. But...

1506
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,154
It was superb.
Ok.

1507
01:16:56,321 --> 01:16:57,447
It was absolutely superb.

1508
01:16:57,614 --> 01:16:58,699
Vito, tell her.

1509
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,742
Delicious.
Thank you. I'm not, would he lie?

1510
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:02,244
Will I lie?
I don't think so.

1511
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:05,205
Where are we going next now?
I don't wanna go home yet.

1512
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:06,581
Ah! Vito, anything?

1513
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:08,583
The craps game in Brooklyn.

1514
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,168
The craps game?
If you are lucky?

1515
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:13,630
That's amazing!

1516
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:15,382
Load the dice!

1517
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:17,092
This is beginner's luck.
It was second in a row.

1518
01:17:17,259 --> 01:17:18,802
So I just keep going and going?

1519
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:20,387
Yes, if you do one up...

1520
01:18:14,191 --> 01:18:16,443
New York really is fabulous.

1521
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:19,988
I wouldn't know it either way.
I'm traveling quite a lot.

1522
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:21,406
I know that. You've mentioned that.

1523
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:24,993
Why would you possible choose anywhere else?
I know Hollywood is occasionally exciting,

1524
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,955
but nothing beats Broadway or 
he cheesecake at Lindy's.

1525
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:32,167
Come listen to you...

1526
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:38,090
Drinking wine in Central Park,
and we haven't slept yet.

1527
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:41,218
You really always had a touch of a poet in you.
Really?

1528
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:43,845
Well, I'm really not...like everybody.

1529
01:18:47,391 --> 01:18:49,601
What could I do?
I had to choose.

1530
01:18:51,478 --> 01:18:54,898
As my brother-law said:
Alternatives exclude.

1531
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:58,735
Yeah, I loved you and I loved Phil.

1532
01:18:58,944 --> 01:19:01,154
I was with him for a year and a half

1533
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:02,656
and you this...

1534
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:06,660
awkward but adorable,

1535
01:19:07,452 --> 01:19:08,620
frantic,

1536
01:19:09,496 --> 01:19:12,082
young, romantic, trying to find yourself.

1537
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:14,334
And I had this big shot.

1538
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:15,877
It was difficult.

1539
01:19:18,672 --> 01:19:22,467
I didn't know if it work out,
or we just both...

1540
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:24,010
I just thought maybe

1541
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:28,390
if you didn't make it the way you wanna make it,
you would be resentful and we be unhappy.

1542
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:29,516
Who knows? I don't know.

1543
01:19:29,891 --> 01:19:32,686
You know, I never stopped thinking about you.

1544
01:19:32,853 --> 01:19:34,396
Not...not for one day.

1545
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:37,107
I still dream about you.

1546
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:40,485
But...

1547
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:44,114
I am Phil's wife.

1548
01:19:44,323 --> 01:19:49,703
He's been very good to me, he loves me,
changed his life for me.

1549
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:52,831
I've been a good wife to him.

1550
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:55,375
And yet you dream about me.

1551
01:19:58,295 --> 01:20:00,839
Well you're a happily
married man, with a child.

1552
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:03,550
You said it yourself.
I know what I said.

1553
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:07,012
But we are alone in Central Park.

1554
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:09,723
The light reflecting off the building.

1555
01:20:27,157 --> 01:20:28,575
Satisfied?

1556
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:02,192
As the investigation of Ben proceeded,

1557
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,111
there was no shortage of evidence or informers,

1558
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:08,823
and indictments followed,
including murder one.

1559
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:12,452
I can't get my mind around it.
The whole thing is so horrible!

1560
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:15,038
I am firmly against all executions.

1561
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:17,624
Thank God they never found
the the neighbor's body.

1562
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,417
What difference does that make?
Oh!

1563
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:22,754
We may not be criminally liable,
but we need to live with our conscience!

1564
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:24,881
I only said Ben should talk to him.
Evelyn. Evelyn.

1565
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:27,175
Don't be naive. You wanted him threatened.

1566
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:28,176
Warned!

1567
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:30,762
I wanted him warned, but...
Evelyn, calm down!

1568
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:32,347
What difference does that make?

1569
01:21:33,098 --> 01:21:34,057
You called your brother?

1570
01:21:34,224 --> 01:21:35,725
Leave me alone.

1571
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:38,395
Somebody had to take care
of that crazy next door...

1572
01:21:38,562 --> 01:21:40,272
It was becoming intolerable.

1573
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:44,109
You don't kill a man, Bobby,
because he plays his radio too loud.

1574
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:48,280
Calm down! She did not realize and they had
more on Ben with or without your neighbor..

1575
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,823
Well..that is a different issue.

1576
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:53,034
Meanwhile, there is a blood sin on our hands.

1577
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:54,536
Oh Christ!

1578
01:21:54,703 --> 01:21:56,079
Don't get so biblical.

1579
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:58,623
Evelyn, calm down. Ok?
Take an aspirin.

1580
01:21:58,832 --> 01:22:01,751
I'm gonna give you the name of
a very good criminal lawyer,

1581
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:03,003
Jake Murray.

1582
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:04,129
He's the best you can do.
Hmm.

1583
01:22:04,296 --> 01:22:05,297
Thank you so much.

1584
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:08,800
She is devastated. I think she's
gonna have a nervous breakdown.

1585
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:10,760
Its driving me crazy.

1586
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:12,429
As if I'm not upset enough.

1587
01:22:12,596 --> 01:22:16,808
Christ! What the hell did you think, Rose?
Everybody seemed to know he was involved in shady activities.

1588
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:19,477
I don't believe he killed anybody.

1589
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:23,732
Father knew he was a wheeler-dealer but when
the details come out, it gets more worse.

1590
01:22:24,274 --> 01:22:27,694
What we need here is a great criminal lawyer,
and I know just the guy.

1591
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:28,987
My old pal Peter Bryce.

1592
01:22:29,154 --> 01:22:30,530
What? But no Jake Murray?

1593
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:33,992
Look! Bryce never loses.
But if you like Murray, we'll take him as well.

1594
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:39,331
I don't know if Bryce can get him to walk but the
trick now is to spare him the electric chair.

1595
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:44,127
The trial went as anticipated.

1596
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:47,088
The evidence against Ben Dorfman
was overwhelming.

1597
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:49,799
And he was found guilty on all charges,

1598
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:52,010
including murder in the first degree.

1599
01:22:52,344 --> 01:22:55,055
Despite the efforts of
two high-priced lawyers,

1600
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:58,767
he was sentenced to die
in the electric chair at Sing Sing.

1601
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:13,031
This is father Brolian.
He's guiding me down the stand to Christianity.

1602
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:16,076
Today, we discussed the six Psalm.

1603
01:23:16,368 --> 01:23:19,621
O Lord! Do not punish me in anger.

1604
01:23:19,788 --> 01:23:22,040
Do not chastise me in anger, right father?

1605
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:24,709
Ben, Ben, I'm flabbergasted!

1606
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:28,588
You know, we didn't have time for this bullshit,
but when the ends near, you need somethin'.

1607
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:31,925
Yeah! And you don't wanna be buried
as a Jew in a Jewish cemetery?

1608
01:23:32,092 --> 01:23:34,386
The Jewish religion doesn't
believe in an afterlife.

1609
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:38,014
Right. I guess but I don't believe
what I am hearing from you.

1610
01:23:38,181 --> 01:23:41,768
I just have to know that all this just doesn't end.
You know what do I mean?

1611
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:45,939
I need to believe that a part
of me keeps goin'.

1612
01:23:46,106 --> 01:23:47,941
We all gotta soul.

1613
01:23:48,108 --> 01:23:49,192
Right, Father?

1614
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:54,614
First a murderer,

1615
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,534
then he becomes a Christian.

1616
01:23:57,826 --> 01:24:00,120
What did I do to deserve this?

1617
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:01,287
Which is worse?

1618
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:02,580
He explained it to you.

1619
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:05,125
The Jews don't have an afterlife.

1620
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,877
We are all afraid of dying, Marty!

1621
01:24:08,128 --> 01:24:11,798
But we don't give up the
religion we are born into.

1622
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,758
I'm not afraid to die.

1623
01:24:14,426 --> 01:24:17,679
You're too stupid to appreciate the implications.

1624
01:24:17,846 --> 01:24:20,140
I didn't say I like the idea.

1625
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:23,143
And I will resist death
with everything I have.

1626
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:27,605
But when the Angel of Death
comes down to cut me down,

1627
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:28,898
I'll go.

1628
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:31,234
I'll protest.

1629
01:24:31,568 --> 01:24:32,652
I'll curse.

1630
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:33,945
You hear me?

1631
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:35,989
I will go under protest.

1632
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,657
Protest to who?

1633
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:41,327
What the hell are you gonna do??
Write a letter to the Times?

1634
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:44,456
I will protest in silence.

1635
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:48,585
Because my whole life,
I pray and I pray

1636
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:50,503
and there's never an answer!

1637
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:55,467
What are you saying?

1638
01:24:55,884 --> 01:24:58,803
No answer, is also an answer.

1639
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:03,808
Too bad the Jewish religion
doesn't have an afterlife.

1640
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:06,686
They get a lot more customers.

1641
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:11,733
In late July, Ben was executed at Sing Sing.

1642
01:25:12,025 --> 01:25:15,695
He died a Christian and
he wanted to be cremated.

1643
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:19,449
Ben had requested his ashes
be scattered in Manhattan.

1644
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:22,285
And Bobby scattered them
outside an establishment

1645
01:25:22,452 --> 01:25:25,538
that had give Ben many evenings of pleasure.

1646
01:25:25,657 --> 01:25:31,057
(JEEPERS CREEPERS BY FRANK SINATRA)
* Jeepers creepers where'd you get those peepers? *

1647
01:25:31,157 --> 01:25:36,157
* Jeepers creepers where'd you get those eyes? *

1648
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:38,676
Bobby's friends, Rad Taylor and her husband,

1649
01:25:38,843 --> 01:25:40,386
stepped up to help Bobby

1650
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:44,057
and arranged financially for him
to take over the club and run it.

1651
01:25:44,224 --> 01:25:46,392
And the scandal of the gangster charisma

1652
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:49,646
actually increased the
publics fascination with it.

1653
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:57,844
* When you turn those heaters on *
* Woe is me ,Got to put my cheaters on *

1654
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:08,844
* Jeepers creepers here'd you get those steepers *
* Oh, those weepers, here'd you get those eyes yeah? *

1655
01:26:08,944 --> 01:26:12,444
* How they hypnotize... *

1656
01:26:12,544 --> 01:26:15,380
Certain investors asked him
to go out to California

1657
01:26:15,547 --> 01:26:18,883
and explore the idea of opening
a nightclub in Hollywood.

1658
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:22,220
This time, he could afford to stay
at the same exclusive place

1659
01:26:22,387 --> 01:26:24,722
where Rad and Steve always stopped at.

1660
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:26,558
Of course, he looked up Vonnie.

1661
01:26:29,978 --> 01:26:33,189
This is exactly the table
where I took your hand, 

1662
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:36,776
and you told me you have a
journalist boyfriend named Doug.

1663
01:26:36,927 --> 01:26:38,778
Oh! I remember.

1664
01:26:38,878 --> 01:26:41,973
Remember that?
Yes!

1665
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:43,825
Wow! So you will be opening
a club here as well?

1666
01:26:43,992 --> 01:26:46,286
No, Hollywood already has it's great clubs.

1667
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:48,913
I don't wanna compete with Coconut Grove.

1668
01:26:49,289 --> 01:26:53,209
Phil and I will be stopping in New York
for a brief time, on our way from London,

1669
01:26:53,376 --> 01:26:55,670
we are gonna spend a Christmas
weekend with Willie Wyler.

1670
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:58,089
The boys wanna go to a New Year's
party in New Orleans.

1671
01:26:58,256 --> 01:27:00,049
I guess I won't be seeing you.

1672
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:04,387
Maybe it's swell if we don't...see each other.

1673
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,140
It always...

1674
01:27:07,682 --> 01:27:09,517
stirs up feelings and...

1675
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:11,352
and then I start dreaming...

1676
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:14,147
You probably start dreaming.

1677
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:15,982
And dreams are...

1678
01:27:17,859 --> 01:27:19,027
dreams.

1679
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:23,823
I guess some feelings don't ever die.

1680
01:27:24,198 --> 01:27:25,783
Is that good or bad?

1681
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:31,831
And as a beautiful dusk sky
enveloped New York,

1682
01:27:31,998 --> 01:27:34,250
the year came to a close.

1683
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:39,839
What do I look?

1684
01:27:40,757 --> 01:27:41,758
Hmm wow! beautiful.

1685
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:44,010
Can you tell I'm pregnant?

1686
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:45,219
No, no...not at all!

1687
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:49,641
In fact, you have the same girlish
figure you always have.

1688
01:27:50,183 --> 01:27:51,184
Stop!
That's true. It's true.

1689
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:52,560
You help me?
Sure.

1690
01:27:57,523 --> 01:27:59,067
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah sure.

1691
01:28:02,278 --> 01:28:03,947
You ever cheated on me?

1692
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:08,952
Why do you ask me that? No! No!

1693
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:14,457
I had a dream when you were in Hollywood,

1694
01:28:14,624 --> 01:28:17,835
you slept with your old girlfriend.
Has my name...

1695
01:28:17,946 --> 01:28:26,465
Well, dreams are dreams. Hmm?
Yeah.

1696
01:28:26,765 --> 01:28:33,877
* In a mountain greenery where God paints the scenery *

1697
01:28:33,977 --> 01:28:36,604
This is the happiest couple that I know.
They seriously are...

1698
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:40,066
It's the perfect marriage.
Please tell us your secret.

1699
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:42,318
What is your secret?

1700
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:44,070
You tell them.

1701
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,114
We share the same interests,

1702
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,991
we like the same movies,

1703
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:49,575
we both love children.
Yeah?

1704
01:28:50,076 --> 01:28:52,161
Other people's children.
Other people's children!

1705
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:55,081
Time flies, another milestone

1706
01:28:55,248 --> 01:28:58,042
on bewildering journey leading where?

1707
01:28:58,209 --> 01:28:59,711
Where? Why?
Hey!?

1708
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:02,547
It's been an awful year.

1709
01:29:02,714 --> 01:29:04,632
Let's turn the page, and move on.

1710
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:06,384
You're right, you're right.

1711
01:29:06,968 --> 01:29:10,096
I was just pondering the relentless of time.

1712
01:29:10,263 --> 01:29:14,684
Socrates said:
The unexamined life not worth living.

1713
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:18,021
But the examined one, is no bargain.

1714
01:29:23,021 --> 01:29:29,301
Turn it down! Turn it down boys!
Here we are!

1715
01:29:29,407 --> 01:29:38,775
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

1716
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:40,710
Happy New Year!

1717
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:57,685
Happy New Year to you. I love you.
Happy New Year to you too. I love you.

1718
01:29:59,479 --> 01:30:00,938
Happy New Year. You too!
Hi. Hi..

1719
01:30:03,566 --> 01:30:05,151
Come with us Bobby.
Happy New Year, Bobby!

1720
01:30:08,905 --> 01:30:11,199
You have a far up look in your eye.

1721
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:13,743
You right?
Yeah. What are you thinking?

1722
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:16,662
Nothing, just that, ah..

1723
01:30:17,205 --> 01:30:19,040
nothing, the year is changing.

1724
01:30:19,624 --> 01:30:20,666
It is!

1725
01:30:44,107 --> 01:30:46,109
Happy New Year my love.

1726
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:49,946
With you, every year is new and happy for me.

1727
01:30:51,531 --> 01:30:53,199
Thank you, that's very very sweet.

1728
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:54,617
What are you thinking?

1729
01:30:55,952 --> 01:30:57,537
Nothing, I am fine.

1730
01:30:58,204 --> 01:30:59,956
Your eye looks so dreamy.

1731
01:31:00,123 --> 01:31:03,165
Do I?
Hello! Hello!
