l want you home at a decent hour.

496
00:42:31,985 --> 00:42:36,581
- End of discussion.
- Fine, end of discussion. Relax.

497
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:45,594
All right, lesson one. See, hip-hop
is more than just like a dance,

498
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:47,633
it's more like--
like an attitude, you know.

499
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,466
You gotta loosen up so you can feel
them and let them flow through you.

500
00:42:54,107 --> 00:42:56,632
Now, what is this ?
Bring your feet out like this.

501
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:59,303
Put your feet forward.
Right, spread 'em, spread 'em.

502
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:01,643
- You all right, then ?
- Yes.

503
00:43:01,714 --> 00:43:05,480
Just hang loose.
Be strong, a tree, right ?

504
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:09,783
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

505
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:20,192
- Make that sound with me. Uhhh !
- Uhhh !

506
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:25,367
What, are you sitting down
for tea or something ?

507
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:27,429
Get up.

508
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:32,469
Boom. That's it.
Just chillin'.

509
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:37,482
You just do it.
Sit down.

510
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,178
Okay.

511
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:49,152
Now we'rejust going to walk. lt's
real simple.Just walk like this.

512
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:55,631
- Okay, now you try, you try.
- Okay.

513
00:43:55,702 --> 00:43:57,693
Now just relax,
let it be natural.

514
00:44:00,907 --> 00:44:04,502
Five, six, seven, eight.

515
00:44:07,747 --> 00:44:10,477
Dig into it more, the balls of
your feet instead of your toes.

516
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:17,414
Bend your knees, bend your knees.
Just slouch a little bit, slouch.

517
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,355
Act like you're
a nasty bitch.

518
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,257
All right, now watch.
Check it, check it, check it.

519
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:27,959
- Got that ?
- Oh, it's come to headbobs ?

520
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:30,264
Okay, it's the same beat,
but then you split it up.

521
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:34,272
Freeze, freeze, freeze.

522
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,275
- Bounce, bounce.
- l am such a dork.

523
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:39,903
No, you're not.
Bounce.

524
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:43,107
- Now l'm cool.
- You're almost there.

525
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:46,575
Yeah, you got that.

526
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:50,689
Areyousure it's okay
that we came here ?

527
00:44:50,757 --> 00:44:53,419
Well, it is now, but ifwe're
going to keep on doing this,

528
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:55,484
we're gonna have to fiind
someplace else to practice.

529
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:01,359
Did you always
want to be a doctor ?

530
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:03,629
Who said l wanna be
a doctor ?

531
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:06,638
Chenille. Everybody.

532
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:10,805
Well, yeah, you know.
l wanna be a doctor,

533
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:13,209
but l gotta
get into college fiirst.

534
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:16,373
What kind of doctor ?

535
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:18,781
Pediatrician.
l like kids.

536
00:45:20,987 --> 00:45:25,754
- Do you have any ?
- No. Do you ?

537
00:45:25,825 --> 00:45:28,817
Oh, l didn't--
l wasn't trying to be smart, Derek.

538
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:32,330
Wouldn't be the fiirst time.

539
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:34,889
Screw you,
l'm brilliant and cool.

540
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:38,403
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

541
00:45:46,379 --> 00:45:48,813
Wow.

542
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:05,762
That was cute, that little thing
you did. Can you show me again ?

543
00:46:05,832 --> 00:46:10,235
- What was that shit you just did ?
- Rond dejambe attitude.

544
00:46:10,303 --> 00:46:14,467
- Ballet. l used to dance.
- You used to dance ?

545
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,475
Used to, as in don't anymore and no,
l don't want to talk about it.

546
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:21,001
So, is that why you brought up that
rond dejambe attitude shit...

547
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,275
because you don't want
to talk about it ?

548
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:25,340
lt's really not
a big deal.

549
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,154
l think it is.

550
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:36,059
This club was so slamming, Lindsay,
the dancing. l'm gonna go again.

551
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,223
You are ? Well, have you
seen anybody get shot yet ?

552
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,994
What ? No, l didn't see
anyone get shot yet.

553
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:44,002
God, l didn't move to Bosnia.

554
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,004
Well, l'm still going to
pray foryou.

555
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:49,508
Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking
ghetto. Forget about the drive-bys,

556
00:46:49,575 --> 00:46:52,408
how are you supposed to
meet anybody ?

557
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:58,212
Um, well, l did actually
meet somebody, l think.

558
00:46:58,284 --> 00:47:00,878
l met this guy,
and he's really cool.

559
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:05,049
-They got white guys at your school?
-Um...

560
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:08,150
no, actually they don't.

561
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,255
Shut up ! Look at me.
l want my money.

562
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,300
[Girl Crying]
ldon't have it.

563
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:18,201
[Malakai] Shut up !
Quit your crying, man.

564
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,205
[Girl]
 ldon't get paid till next week.

565
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:22,207
You wasn 't saying that
when you was smoking it.

566
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:24,474
-l don't have it !
-Well, you better find it somewhere.

567
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,304
- This ain't no lay a way plan.
- Hey ! Hey, stop it !

568
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:31,143
Come here. Where do you
think you're going, huh ?

569
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,410
Aahh !
Bitch !

570
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:43,152
You ain't seen nothing,
so don't say nothing... to nobody.

571
00:48:01,585 --> 00:48:03,519
[Derek]
 l stole a bike here once.

572
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:06,112
- Why'd you do that ?
- 'Cause l didn't have one.

573
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,887
- Oh, okay. Good reason.
- Well, it's not a reason, you know,

574
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,929
l used to do shit like that,
you know-- wild shit.

575
00:48:12,997 --> 00:48:15,431
- With Malakai ?
- Yeah.

576
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:17,990
l don't get you two.
You seem so different.

577
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:23,038
- We're not.
- l think you are.

578
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:25,905
l mean, come on,
Malakai's scary. Very scary.

579
00:48:25,976 --> 00:48:30,413
What you mean by scary ?
Kai's tough, he has to be.

580
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:35,316
But he's still got
a good heart. l know.

581
00:48:35,386 --> 00:48:37,320
Maybe you only think
you know.

582
00:48:37,388 --> 00:48:40,414
Look, Malakai may not be the boy
next door, but he's still my boy.

583
00:48:40,491 --> 00:48:42,618
He does some shit that l'm not
down with sometimes,

584
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:47,756
but l ain't never going to cross
him offand be like everybody else.

585
00:48:47,832 --> 00:48:50,892
So, you're not down with the stuff
he does, but you are down with him ?

586
00:48:50,968 --> 00:48:54,563
- That makes sense. l understand.
- He's my friend, Sara.

587
00:48:54,638 --> 00:48:56,318
You don't have to
understand.

588
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:57,250
You don't have to
understand.

589
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:01,415
Listen, me and him got into some
shit awhile back-- some bad shit.

590
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,425
Broke into a liquor store
and cracked open the cash register.

591
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:06,427
Somebody peeped us
and called five-0,

592
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:08,793
and we barely
made it out of the store.

593
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:12,493
The cops were on our asses. We split
up and ran in different directions.

594
00:49:12,568 --> 00:49:14,502
Now, l must have been going
in the wrong direction,

595
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:16,504
because the cops
were closing in on me.

596
00:49:16,572 --> 00:49:19,837
So, Malakai, he smashed in some
car windows, set off the alarms...

597
00:49:19,909 --> 00:49:22,434
and turned the heat
from me to him.

598
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:25,002
l kept running,
and he got caught.

599
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:28,141
The DA offered him everything but
a Rolls Royce to turn my name in.

600
00:49:28,217 --> 00:49:31,050
But he didn't,
and he never will.

601
00:49:43,532 --> 00:49:46,194
l stole a hat once,
when l was 12.

602
00:49:46,268 --> 00:49:49,237
But my Mom found it
and made me give it back.

603
00:49:49,305 --> 00:49:53,435
Gangsta Sara stole a hat.
Call the F.B.l.

604
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:55,500
Are you gonna
turn me in ?

605
00:49:55,578 --> 00:49:59,446
l think l'll wait
for you to surrender.

606
00:49:59,515 --> 00:50:02,814
So, you get along
with your mom ?

607
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:05,149
You know, you all
tight and shit ?

608
00:50:05,221 --> 00:50:09,419
Yeah. We got along,
tight and shit.

609
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:12,586
-How come you never talk about her ?
-'Cause there's nothing to say.

610
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,891
lt's because you don't
talk about her.

611
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:17,194
What do you want
me to do ?

612
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:19,200
l don't know,
just say something about her.

613
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:22,499
l mean, you don't
say anything about her.

614
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:25,233
Well, she's dead. God,
what do you want me to do,

615
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:28,242
-run through the streets screaming ?
-lf it helps.

616
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,574
Well, it won't,
so drop it.

617
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:34,445
Didn 't mean to press you
about your mom.

618
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:36,007
lt's all right.
Don't worry about it.

619
00:50:36,085 --> 00:50:39,919
Get along with your dad ?
Y'all tight and shit ?

620
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:42,753
Yeah, we're both tight
and shit. Our DNA matches.

621
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:03,004
- [ Sara ] What is this place ?
- Well, in a few months,

622
00:51:03,078 --> 00:51:05,672
it'll be Club Med
for the homeless, but right now...

623
00:51:05,748 --> 00:51:08,876
just an old furniture spot
l used to work at last summer.

624
00:51:08,951 --> 00:51:14,082
Hop, step, back. Okay ?
Real simple, do it with me, right ?

625
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:21,126
Try it one more time. Add on the
next part after that, all right ?

626
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:23,028
Six, seven, eight.

627
00:51:23,098 --> 00:51:28,263
Step, back, break, spin,
out, up, step.

628
00:51:28,337 --> 00:51:30,100
Chilly on that ?
One more time.

629
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:32,572
Okay, on this part ?
lt's like we're battling, right ?

630
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:34,666
lt's like a challenge.
When l step forward like this,

631
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:37,041
you have to challenge me
back into my space,

632
00:51:37,112 --> 00:51:39,137
and l challenge you back
in your space, like this.

633
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:42,184
So, it's back, front,
back, front,

634
00:51:42,251 --> 00:51:44,515
back, front,
like that, that kinda feel.

635
00:51:47,823 --> 00:51:51,224
Step, back, forth, back.

636
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:02,794
Wait, wait. You're making
me dizzy. Stop, stop.

637
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:05,864
Sit on it, sit on it.
Stick your ass out.

638
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:08,136
- Do it.
- [ Both Laugh ]

639
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:25,322
Okay, okay. How am l doing ?
How's my butt ?

640
00:52:25,394 --> 00:52:30,195
[ Chuckles ]
lt's nice. l mean, it's good.

641
00:52:30,266 --> 00:52:32,063
Thank you.

642
00:52:39,074 --> 00:52:41,133
[Sara]
You made that ?lt's really nice.

643
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,007
lt's Tanisha's.

644
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:45,603
That girl's gonna pay my way
through design school.

645
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,414
What about your mom ?

646
00:52:50,486 --> 00:52:52,954
Where is she ?

647
00:52:53,022 --> 00:52:56,822
She was in jail...
for drugs.

648
00:52:56,892 --> 00:53:00,350
For things women do
for drugs.

649
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:03,125
She got out
and took off.

650
00:53:03,198 --> 00:53:06,531
Well, maybe she'll come back.

651
00:53:08,437 --> 00:53:13,602
That is what Derek used to say
when we were little,

652
00:53:13,676 --> 00:53:15,940
when Momma Dean used to
piss us off.

653
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:21,782
But he grew up.
He grew out of it.

654
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:27,555
You like Derek,
don't you ?

655
00:53:27,623 --> 00:53:30,717

985
01:26:11,823 --> 01:26:13,916
Yeah, you know, girls
wear those sometimes.

986
01:26:13,992 --> 01:26:17,155
Stepps.
Main Squeeze Night.

987
01:26:17,228 --> 01:26:20,288
Couples only Saturday night.

988
01:26:20,365 --> 01:26:22,299
We already talked
about this, remember ?

989
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:24,767
Yeah.

990
01:26:24,836 --> 01:26:27,430
We talked about it,
but l didn't know we decided on it.

991
01:26:27,505 --> 01:26:29,666
Well, it's Stepps.
What is there to decide on it ?

992
01:26:31,342 --> 01:26:35,608
l don't know. l just thought that
with the fiight and everything...

993
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,240
that maybe we should cool it
for a little while.

994
01:26:38,316 --> 01:26:40,250
What ?

995
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:46,251
Well, uh,
what are you saying ?

996
01:26:46,324 --> 01:26:48,690
Are you saying that
you don't wanna be with me ?

997
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,092
You don't wanna be seen with me ?
What are you saying ?

998
01:26:51,162 --> 01:26:53,096
l'm just saying
l'm confused, that's all.

999
01:26:53,164 --> 01:26:55,325
Confused about what ?
Me ?

1000
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,130
A little bit.

1001
01:26:58,202 --> 01:27:01,603
l don't know.
Yeah... no... maybe.

1002
01:27:01,673 --> 01:27:03,607
Maybe ?

1003
01:27:03,675 --> 01:27:06,701
So, hold on. What ? Are we talking
about Stepps and school,

1004
01:27:06,778 --> 01:27:11,078
or are you talking about the grocery
store, the sidewalk and museums ?

1005
01:27:11,149 --> 01:27:13,982
Break it down a little bit better
for me, 'cause l don't get it.

1006
01:27:14,052 --> 01:27:16,987
When is it okay for us to be
together ? To be seen together ?

1007
01:27:17,055 --> 01:27:19,216
Why are you getting mad ?
l'm just being honest.

1008
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:21,383
Nobody wants to
see us together.

1009
01:27:21,459 --> 01:27:24,451
We spend more time defending
our relationship than having one.

1010
01:27:24,529 --> 01:27:26,463
lt'sjust... so hard.

1011
01:27:26,531 --> 01:27:29,694
Everything's gotta be easy ? That's
the story ofyour life, not mine.

1012
01:27:29,767 --> 01:27:31,632
You know this much
about my life.

1013
01:27:31,703 --> 01:27:34,171
l know when shit gets rough,
you give up and punk out.

1014
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:36,638
Just the way you punked out
on ballet when your mom died.

1015
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:40,974
You don't know shit about my mother.
How dare you talk about my mom !

1016
01:27:41,045 --> 01:27:42,979
God !

1017
01:27:44,515 --> 01:27:46,881
l'm sorry.

1018
01:27:48,453 --> 01:27:50,387
l shouldn't have
said that.

1019
01:27:52,123 --> 01:27:53,750
lt'sjust that...

1020
01:27:53,825 --> 01:27:56,225
all this shitjust kind of
caught me off guard.

1021
01:27:57,895 --> 01:28:01,228
l mean, it's, like, damn,
you don't wanna be with me.

1022
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:05,167
ls that
what you're saying,

1023
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:07,170
that you don't
want to be with me ?

1024
01:28:07,238 --> 01:28:09,172
No, it's not like that.

1025
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,504
l'm trying to tell you how l feel,
and you're taking it personal.

1026
01:28:11,576 --> 01:28:13,567
Let me tell you
something, Sara.

1027
01:28:13,644 --> 01:28:17,045
l just hit the best friend l have
in the world in the face overyou.

1028
01:28:17,115 --> 01:28:19,310
l've been taking shit
from people l've known all my life.

1029
01:28:19,384 --> 01:28:22,217
People l care about, that care
about me so l could be with you.

1030
01:28:22,286 --> 01:28:24,550
Telling myselfthat
we are in this together.

1031
01:28:24,622 --> 01:28:27,455
So, don't give me this ''nothing
personal.'' l don't wanna hear it.

1032
01:28:27,525 --> 01:28:30,824
Fine. lf l'm messing up
your life so much,

1033
01:28:30,895 --> 01:28:33,523
then maybe we
shouldn't be together.

1034
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,101
You know what ?
l don't need this shit.

1035
01:28:40,671 --> 01:28:42,605
ldon't even know
whylbother.

1036
01:28:42,673 --> 01:28:45,540
l'm out.

1037
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:47,544
The hell with it.

1038
01:28:47,612 --> 01:28:49,546
The hell with you.

1039
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:38,617
Uh, you know, about the other night.
l don't want there to be--

1040
01:29:38,696 --> 01:29:42,325
Don't even worry about it, man.
Myjaw's not made out of glass.

1041
01:29:43,801 --> 01:29:47,032
Yeah, well, you know,
blood's thicker than blonds, right ?

1042
01:29:47,105 --> 01:29:49,471
So, you got my back
on Saturday ?

1043
01:29:51,042 --> 01:29:54,478
Derek... l ain't got
nobody else, man.

1044
01:29:54,545 --> 01:29:56,513
- You got Lip.
- Lip ?

1045
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:59,675
Man, that fool will get
a nigger killed quick, man.

1046
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:03,982
No, l need you there.

1047
01:30:04,055 --> 01:30:06,182
47th Street,
under the El.

1048
01:30:06,257 --> 01:30:08,851
l'll call you, man.

1049
01:30:08,926 --> 01:30:10,826
Are you down ?

1050
01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:14,164
- Yeah, l'm down.
- All right, man.

1051
01:30:15,933 --> 01:30:18,401
Let me get to class,
get some education like you.

1052
01:30:18,469 --> 01:30:20,403
All right.

1053
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:12,053
Uh...

1054
01:31:12,123 --> 01:31:16,924

1055

So, tomorrow's

1056
01:31:20,932 --> 01:31:23,696
Yeah.

1057
01:31:23,768 --> 01:31:27,636
- You scared ?
- Shitless.

1058
01:31:30,141 --> 01:31:34,148
You got a minute foryour old man ?
l wanna show you something.

1059
01:31:34,282 --> 01:31:36,011
Sure.

1060
01:31:56,304 --> 01:31:59,933
Be careful.
That wall, it's, uh,

1061
01:32:00,008 --> 01:32:01,942
still wet.

1062
01:32:19,327 --> 01:32:21,761
That'syourmother
when she was 19,

1063
01:32:21,829 --> 01:32:24,389
when l fiirst met her.

1064

1065
01:32:27,302 --> 01:32:31,432
lt'sjust a start. l mean, l know
you're too old for a twin bed.

1066
01:32:31,506 --> 01:32:35,067
lt's a nice bed, Roy.

1067
01:32:38,513 --> 01:32:41,505
You know, l-l didn't mean
to mess up your life.

1068

Oryour mother's.

1069
01:32:46,788 --> 01:32:51,885
And l don't deserve a second chance
to be your father,

1070
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:54,656
but l'm hoping
you'll give me one anyway.

1071
01:32:56,531 --> 01:32:58,590
You know, wayback when...

1072

But... one day...

wake up, you look around.

1076
01:33:15,683 --> 01:33:19,312
All you got to show

1077
01:33:19,387 --> 01:33:22,151
beautiful, talented,
little girl.

1078
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:25,559
Young woman...

God, everything
isso screwedup.

1084
01:34:00,261 --> 01:34:02,661
Derek is mad at me.

1085
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:04,755
He's not gonna come
tomorrow.

1086
01:34:06,467 --> 01:34:08,401

Whoa ! Hey.

Why are you so quiet ?

1092
01:34:50,011 --> 01:34:51,945
l don't feel like talking.

1093
01:34:52,013 --> 01:34:54,709
Derek, there's something
l oughta tell you.

1094
01:34:54,782 --> 01:34:57,910
l said something to Sara.

1095
01:34:57,985 --> 01:35:00,783
What ?
What did you say ?

1096
01:35:00,855 --> 01:35:03,619
Stuff.

1097
01:35:03,691 --> 01:35:07,491
About how maybe Nikki had a point
about black men and white women.

1098
01:35:07,562 --> 01:35:09,894
What ?
You said what ?

1099
01:35:09,964 --> 01:35:13,798
l'm sorry.
l-l don't even like Nikki.

1100
01:35:13,868 --> 01:35:15,802
l was trippin' off Kenny.

1101
01:35:17,405 --> 01:35:22,001
You can't help who you love, Derek.
You're not supposed to.

1102
01:35:22,076 --> 01:35:25,102
When you love somebody,
you love them.

1103
01:35:25,179 --> 01:35:28,148
Look at me.

1104
01:35:28,216 --> 01:35:31,583

wants you to do.

1109
01:35:42,730 --> 01:35:44,664
Why are you trippin'
off him, Derek ?

1110
01:35:44,732 --> 01:35:47,166
All you're trying to do
is get the hell up out of here.

1111
01:35:47,235 --> 01:35:49,499
Ain't no shame or blame in that.

1112

Take that baby inside.

1120
01:36:50,064 --> 01:36:53,158
-You know what l mean.
-Did you come here to waste my time?

1121
01:36:53,234 --> 01:36:57,136
This shit is nonsense, Kai.
lt's dangerous nonsense.

1122
01:36:57,205 --> 01:37:00,936
Just back up off it, man. Come on.

01:37:14,155 --> 01:37:18,558
Malakai, you are so much
smarter than this shit.

1128
01:37:18,626 --> 01:37:21,925
l know what you can be.
l know what you're capable of.

You wanna bail out
