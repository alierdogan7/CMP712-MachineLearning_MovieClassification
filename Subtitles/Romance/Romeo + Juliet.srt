are no stop to me!

538
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,918
If they do see thee,

539
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,423
they will murder thee.

540
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,130
I have night's cloak to hide me

541
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:02,631
from their eyes.

542
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,636
But thou love me,
let them find me here.

543
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,639
My life were better
ended by their hate

544
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,140
than death prorogued,

545
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,112
wanting of thy love.

546
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,155
Juliet: Thou knowest
the mask of night is on my face,

547
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,657
else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek

548
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,592
for that which thou
hast heard me speak tonight.

549
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,129
Fain would I dwell on form-

550
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,632
Fain, fain deny what I have spoke.

551
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,134
But farewell compliment.

552
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,433
Dost thou love me?

553
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,143
I know thou wilt say "Ay,"
and I will take thy word.

554
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,645
Yet, if thou swearest,
thou mayst prove false.

555
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,773
O gentle Romeo, if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

556
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,614
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon I vow,

557
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,780
that tips with silver
all these fruit-tree tops.

558
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,017
O, swear not by the moon,

559
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,615
the inconstant moon,

560
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,161
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

561
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,164
lest that thy love
prove likewise variable.

562
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,666
What shall I swear by?

563
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,668
Do not swear at all.

564
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,670
Or if thou wilt,

565
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,672
swear by thy gracious self,

566
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,174
which is the god of my idolatry,

567
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,177
and I'll believe thee.

568
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:58,306
If my heart's dear love-

569
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,092
Well, do not swear.

570
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,128
Although I joy in thee,

571
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,721
I have no joy
of this contract tonight.

572
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,629
It is too rash,
too unadvised, too sudden;

573
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,134
too like the lightning,
which doth cease to be

574
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,137
ere one can say "It lightens. "

575
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,638
Sweet, good night.

576
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,140
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath,

577
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,643
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

578
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,235
Good night.

579
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,280
Good night.

580
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,777
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

581
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,324
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

582
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:46,651
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

583
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,668
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it!

584
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,415
<i>Nurse:Juliet!</i>

585
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,587
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

586
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,457
If that thy bent of love be honorable,
thy purpose marriage,

587
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,588
send me word tomorrow by one
that I'll procure to come to thee,

588
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,758
where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite,

589
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,301
and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay

590
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,804
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

591
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,100
<i>Nurse:Juliet!</i>

592
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,870
By-and-by I come!

593
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,467
- Nurse:Juliet!
- But if thou meanest not well,

594
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:35,944
I do beseech thee-

595
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,106
by-and-by I come-

596
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,878
to cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.

597
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,249
Tomorrow will I send.

598
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,152
So thrive my soul.

599
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,665
A thousand times good night.

600
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,668
A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light.

601
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,602
Nurse:Juliet!

602
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,199
<i>Nurse:Juliet!</i>

603
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:10,910
Good night.

604
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,416
Love goes toward love as schoolboys
from their books;

605
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,923
but love from love,

606
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,821
toward school with heavy looks.

607
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,193
Romeo!

608
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,131
What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

609
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,431
By the hour of 9:00.

610
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,632
I will not fail.
'Tis twenty year till then.

611
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,140
Good night.

612
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,378
Good night, good night.

613
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:57,954
[Sighs]

614
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,996
Parting is such sweet sorrow,

615
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,931
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

616
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,933
Nurse:Juliet!

617
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:13,032
The Wannadies:
#And it's always you and me always #

618
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,635
#And forever #

619
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,240
#You and me always #

620
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,580
#And forever #

621
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:26,248
# Ba ba ba ba ba #

622
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:32,091
# It was always
you and me always ##

623
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:36,132
Almighty is the powerful grace
that lies in plants,

624
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,966
herbs, stones,
and their true qualities.

625
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:44,640
For naught so vile
that on the earth doth live,

626
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,575
but to the earth
some special good doth give...

627
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:53,609
and naught so good but,
strained from that fair use,

628
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:57,415
revolts from true birth,
stumbling on abuse.

629
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,614
Virtue itself turns vice,
being misapplied,

630
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:04,388
and vice sometimes
by action dignified.

631
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:08,921
Within the infant rind
of this weak flower

632
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,763
poison is resident...

633
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,769
and medicine power.

634
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:18,604
For this, being smelt,
with that part cheers each part;

635
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:24,375
being tasted,
slays all senses with the heart.

636
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:29,579
2 such opposed kings encamp
them still in man as well as herbs:

637
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,587
grace and rude will;

638
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:34,089
and where the worser is predominant,

639
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:38,652
full soon the canker death
eats up that plant.

640
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,821
Romeo: Good morrow, Father!

641
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,831
Benedicite!

642
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,132
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?

643
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,638
Boys: Good morrow, Romeo.

644
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,139
Romeo: Good morrow.

645
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:54,371
Young son,
it argues a distempered head

646
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,607
so soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.

647
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:01,617
Or if not so,
then here I hit it right-

648
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:05,177
Our Romeo hath not
seen his bed tonight.

649
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:08,247
Romeo: The last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.

650
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,725
God pardon sin.
Wast thou with Rosaline?

651
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,728
Rosaline? My ghostly father, no.

652
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,594
I have forgot that name
and that name's woe.

653
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,098
That's my good son.

654
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,725
But where then hast thou been?

655
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,770
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,

656
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,602
where on a sudden one hath wounded me
that's by me wounded.

657
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,110
Both our remedies within thy help
and holy physic lies.

658
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,078
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.

659
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,614
Riddling confession
finds but riddling shrift.

660
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,914
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set

661
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,978
on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

662
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,581
We met, we wooed,

663
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,889
we made exchange of vow.

664
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,088
I'll tell thee as we pass,

665
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,997
but this I pray,
that thou consent to marry us today.

666
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,971
Holy Saint Francis.

667
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,939
What a change is here.

668
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:02,308
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love
so dear, so soon forsaken?

669
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,371
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,

670
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,939
but in their eyes.

671
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:10,043
Thou chid'st me oft
for loving Rosaline.

672
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,055
For doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.

673
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,225
I pray thee...

674
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,262
chide me not.

675
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:24,596
Her I love now doth grace for grace
and love for love allow.

676
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,602
The other did not so.

677
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,606
O, she well knew thy love
did read by rote,

678
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,642
that could not spell.

679
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:36,145
Boys Choir:
#... father, too bold #

680
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:42,413
# Maybe you're just like my mother #

681
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:47,423
# She's never satisfied... #

682
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:51,587
Friar's Voice:
For this alliance may so happy prove

683
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:57,123
to turn your households' rancor
to pure love.

684
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,135
#This is what it sounds like #

685
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:06,075
#When doves cry... #

686
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,078
Come, young waverer.
Come, go with me.

687
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,047
In one respect I'll thy assistant be.

688
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,711
For this alliance may so happy prove

689
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,221
to turn your households'
rancor to pure love.

690
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,757
O, let us hence!
I stand on sudden haste!

691
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,988
# How could you
leave me standing?... #

692
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,586
Wisely and slow.

693
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,427
<i>They stumble that run fast.</i>

694
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:32,969
# Maybe I'm just too demanding #

695
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,938
# Maybe I'm just like my father,
too bold #

696
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:40,443
# Maybe I'm just like my mother #

697
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,606
# She's never satisfied #

698
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:48,247
#Why do we scream at each other? #

699
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,252
#This is what it sounds like #

700
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,915
#When doves cry #

701
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,688
#Yeah, yeah #

702
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,088
#This is what it sounds like #

703
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,964
#This is what it sounds like #

704
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,502
#This is what it sounds like ##

705
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,302
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?

706
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,275
Came he not home tonight?

707
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,312
Not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.

708
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,611
Why, that same pale,
hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,

709
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,948
torments him so
that he will sure run mad.

710
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,614
Tybalt hath sent a letter
to his father's house.

711
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,281
A challenge, on my life.

712
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,790
Romeo will answer it?

713
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,123
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.

714
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,652
Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
how he dares, being dared.

715
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:38,292
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead!

716
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,131
Stabbed with a white wench's
black eye,

717
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,296
run through the ear
with a love song,

718
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,637
the very pin of his heart cleft with
the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft.

719
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,075
Mercutio: And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?

720
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,373
Why, what is Tybalt?

721
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,471
More than Prince of Cats.

722
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:55,678
He is the courageous
captain of compliments.

723
00:50:55,752 --> 00:51:00,052
He fights as you sing prick-song-

724
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,786
keeps time, distance, and proportion.

725
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,090
He rests his minim rests,

726
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,130
one, two...

727
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,632
and the third in your bosom.
