1
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:12,509
Oh, for a muse of fire...

2
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:17,947
that would ascend the
brightest heaven of invention.

3
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:42,499
A kingdom for a stage,

4
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,268
princes to act...

5
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:49,507
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.

6
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:53,845
Then should the warlike harry,
like himself,

7
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,883
assume the port of Mars...

8
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,548
and at his heels,
leashed in like hounds,

9
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:03,992
should famine, sword and fire
crouch for employment.

10
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,993
But pardon, gentles all,

11
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,936
the flat, unraised spirits...

12
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:13,833
that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold...

13
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,100
to bring forth
so great an object.

14
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:22,075
Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France

15
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,910
or may we cram
within this wooden "o"...

16
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:29,850
the very casques that did affright
the air at Agincourt?

17
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:32,381
Oh, pardon.

18
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:35,554
Let us, ciphers
to this great account,

19
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:38,187
on your imaginary forces work.

20
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:40,922
For it is your thoughts
that now must deck our kings,

21
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:44,501
carry them here, there,
jumping o'er times,

22
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:48,972
turning the accomplishment of
many years into an hourglass.

23
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:54,345
For the which supply,
admit me, chorus, to this history,

24
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:57,673
who, prologue-like,

25
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:00,578
your humble patience pray...

26
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:03,212
gently to hear,

27
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:06,051
kindly to judge...

28
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,517
our play!

29
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,132
My lord, I'll tell you.

30
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,706
That self bill is urged,
which, in the 11th year...

31
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,307
of the last king's reign was
like to have passed against us.

32
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,086
But how, my lord,
shall we resist it now?

33
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:37,084
It must be thought on.

34
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,982
If it pass against us, we lose the
better half of our possession.

35
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,121
But what prevention?

36
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,824
The king is full of grace
and fair regard.

37
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:47,695
And a true lover
of the holy church.

38
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:49,930
The courses of his youth
promised it not.

39
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,266
Since his addiction
was to courses vain,

40
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:55,837
his hours filled up
with riots, banquets,

41
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:59,475
sports and never noted
in him any study.

42
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,508
But, my good lord,
how now for the mitigation...

43
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,844
Of this bill
urged by the commons?

44
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:07,249
Doth his majesty incline
to it or no?

45
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,446
He seems...
indifferent,

46
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:14,282
or rather swaying more
upon our part.

47
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:18,124
For I have made an offer
to his majesty,

48
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:20,632
as touching France.

49
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,235
[Footsteps approaching]

50
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:21,018
Where is my gracious
lord of Canterbury?

51
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:43,778
God and his angels guard your sacred
throne and make you long become it.

52
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,514
Sure we thank you.

53
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:48,046
My learned lord,
we pray you to proceed...

54
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,814
and justly and religiously unfold...

55
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:53,920
why the law salique
that they have in France,

56
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,787
or should or should not
bar us in our claim.

57
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:03,001
And pray, take heed
how you impawn our person,

58
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,065
how you awake
our sleeping sword of war.

59
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:10,774
We charge you,
in the name of God, take heed.

60
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:16,074
For never two such kingdoms did
contend without much fall of blood.

61
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,783
Then hear me,
gracious sovereign.

62
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:27,323
There is no bar to make against
your highness' claim to France...

63
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,793
but this, which they
produce from Pharamond.

64
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,891
"In terram salicam
mulieres ne succedant."

65
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,433
"No woman shall succeed
in Salique land."

66
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,776
Which Salique land
the French unjustly gloze...

67
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,744
to be the realm of France.

68
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,579
Yet their own authors
faithfully affirm...

69
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:56,415
that the land Salique
lies in Germany...

70
00:07:56,556 --> 00:08:00,048
between the floods
of Sala and of Elbe.

71
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:03,387
Then doth it well appear
the Salique law...

72
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:07,023
was not devised
for the realm of France,

73
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
nor did the French possess
the Salique land...

74
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:14,638
until 421 years after
defunction of king Pharamond,

75
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:19,406
idly supposed
the founder of this law.

76
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:25,482
King Pepin,
which deposed childeric,

77
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:29,143
did, as heir general,
being descended of blithild,

78
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:31,380
which was the daughter
to king Clothair,

79
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,549
make claim and title
to the crown of France.

80
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,924
Hugh Capet, also, who usurped the
crown of Charles, the duke of Lorraine,

81
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:41,656
sole heir male of the true line
and stock of Charles the great,

82
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:44,634
could not keep quiet in his conscience
wearing the crown of France...

83
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:48,002
until satisfied that fair queen
Isabel, his grandmother,

84
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,004
was lineal
of the Lady Ermengare,

85
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:54,541
daughter to Charles,
the aforesaid duke of Lorraine,

86
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,348
by the which marriage the line
of Charles the great...

87
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,011
was reunited
to the crown of France.

88
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,085
So it is clear
as is the summer sun.

89
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,354
[Men chuckling]

90
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:15,500
All appear to hold in right
and title of the female.

91
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:19,902
So do the kings of France...

92
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,270
unto this day.

93
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:29,939
Howbeit, they would hold up
this salique law...

94
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:34,985
to bar your highness
claiming from the female.

95
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:40,858
May I, with right
and conscience,

96
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:43,726
make this claim?

97
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:49,397
The sin upon my head,
dread sovereign.

98
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:58,009
Stand for your own.
Unwind your bloody flag.

99
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,411
Your brother kings
and monarchs of the earth...

100
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:02,673
do all expect that you
should rouse yourself...

101
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,409
as did the former lions
of your blood.

102
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:09,880
Never king of England had nobles
richer and more loyal subjects...

103
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,947
whose hearts have left
their bodies here in England...

104
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,184
and lie pavilioned
in the fields of France.

105
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,692
Oh, let their bodies follow,
my dear liege,

106
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,890
with blood and sword and fire
to win your right.

107
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,497
In aid whereof,

108
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:28,738
we of the spirituality
will raise your highness...

109
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:31,740
such a mighty sum
as never did the clergy...

110
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:34,711
at one time bring in to
any of your ancestors.

111
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,851
Call in the messengers
sent from the Dauphin.

112
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:51,393
Now are we well resolved,
and by God's help and yours,

113
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:56,034
the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours,

114
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,493
we'll bend it to our all...

115
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,934
or break it all to pieces.

116
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:19,747
Now are we well prepared to know the
pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin.

117
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:24,153
Your highness, lately sending into France
did claim some certain dukedoms...

118
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,491
in the right of your great
predecessor, king Edward III.

119
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:30,126
In answer of which claim,
the prince, my master,

120
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:32,601
says that you savor
too much of your youth.

121
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:37,775
He therefore sends you, meeter for
your spirit, this tun of treasure.

122
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,647
And in lieu of this, desires
you let those dukedoms...

123
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,546
that you claim
hear no more of you.

124
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:47,251
This the Dauphin speaks.

125
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:53,014
What... treasure, uncle?

126
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,529
Tennis balls, my liege.

127
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,911
We are glad the Dauphin
is so pleasant with us.

128
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:19,684
His present and your pains
we thank you for.

129
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,745
When we have matched
our rackets to these balls,

130
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,055
we will in France,
by God's grace,

131
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:33,092
play a set shall strike his
father's crown into the hazard.

132
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,496
And we understand him well,

133
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:38,266
how he comes o'er us
with our wilder days,

134
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,934
not measuring what use
we made of them.

135
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:45,801
But tell the Dauphin
I will keep my state,

136
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:49,209
be like a king and show
my sail of greatness...

137
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:52,745
when I do rouse me
in my throne of France.

138
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,646
And tell the pleasant prince
this mock of his...

139
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,620
hath turned his balls
to gunstones,

140
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:01,594
and his soul
shall stand sore charged...

141
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:03,926
for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them.

142
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,022
For many a thousand widows
shall this his mock,

143
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,997
mock out of
their dear husbands,

144
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:12,468
mock mothers from their sons,
mock castles down.

145
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,072
And some are yet ungotten
and unborn...

146
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:17,701
that shall have cause
to curse the Dauphin's scorn.

147
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,603
So get you hence in peace,

148
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:24,247
and tell the Dauphin...

149
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:30,016
his jest... will savor
but of shallow wit...

150
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:34,319
when thousands weep
more than did laugh at it.

151
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,493
Convey them with safe conduct.

152
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,962
Fare you well.

153
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,010
This was a merry message.
[Scoffs]

154
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,846
We hope to make the sender
blush at it.

155
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:10,520
Therefore, my lords,
omit no happy hour...

156
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:12,597
that may give furtherance
to our expedition.

157
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,959
For we have now no thought
in us but France,

158
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:19,299
save those to God
that run before our business.

159
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,966
Therefore, let every man
now task his thought...

160
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:27,704
that this fair action
may on foot be brought.

161
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,850
[Chorus] Now all the youth of
England are on fire...

162
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:44,688
and silken dalliance
in the wardrobe lies.

163
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:48,592
For now sits expectation
in the air...

164
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:52,226
and hides a sword,
from hilts unto the point,

165
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:56,738
with crowns imperial,
crowns and coronets...

166
00:14:56,776 --> 00:15:00,439
promised to Harry and his followers.

167
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,814
[Meows]

168
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:18,057
Well met, Corporal Nym.

169
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:21,028
Good morrow,
Lieutenant Bardolph.

170
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,629
[Cat meows]
[Sniffs]

171
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:26,932
[Meows, paws running]

172
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:31,770
What, are you and Ancient Pistol friends yet?

173
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,905
For my part, I care not.

174
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,672
I say little,

175
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,587
but when time shall serve,
there shall be smiles.

176
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:47,118
But that shall be as it may.

177
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,987
Come, I will bestow a breakfast
to make you friends,

178
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:53,798
and we'll be all three
sworn brothers to France.

179
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,063
- Let it be so, good corporal.
- I will do as I may.

180
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:02,468
It is certain, corporal, that Ancient
Pistol is married to Nell quickly.

181
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:06,545
For certainly she did you wrong,
for you were betrothed to her.

182
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:11,710
- [Clattering]
- [Man, woman shouting, laughing]

183
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,255
How now,
mine host Pistol?

184
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,151
Base tyke!

185
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:22,285
Callest thou me host?

186
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:25,262
Now, by this hand,
I swear I scorn the term!

187
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:28,628
Nor shall my Nell
keep lodgers!

188
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,426
No, by my troth,
not long.

189
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:34,165
For we can't lodge or board
a dozen or 14 gentlewomen...

190
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,638
who live honestly
by the prick of their needles,

191
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:39,640
but it shall be thought
we keep a bawdy house straight.

192
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:43,144
- Pish!
- Pish for thee, Iceland dog!

193
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,082
Good Corporal Nym,

194
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:49,252
show thy valor
and put up thy sword.

195
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:51,446
- Will you shog off?
- [Shouts]

196
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:56,022
Pistol, I will prick your guts
a little in good terms, as I may.

197
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:57,958
That's the humor of it.
[Groaning]

198
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,525
- Braggart vile!
- Ahh, hear me when I say,

199
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,701
he that strikes
the first stroke,

200
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,894
I'll run him up to the hilts,
as I'm a soldier.

201
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,336
An oath of mickle might,

202
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:12,602
and fury shall abate.
[Footsteps approaching]

203
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:13,869
My host Pistol!

204
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:16,372
You must come to my master,
and you, hostess!

205
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,449
He's very sick
and would to bed.

206
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:22,946
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his
sheets and do the office of a warming pan.

207
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,214
- Away, you rogue.
- [Sighs]

208
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:28,986
Faith, he's very ill.

209
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,192
By my troth,

210
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,932
the king has killed his heart.

211
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,366
Good husband,
come home presently.

212
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:52,781
[Sighs]

213
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,148
Come, shall I make you two friends?
We must to France together.

214
00:17:57,423 --> 00:18:00,221
Why the devil should we keep
nives to cut one another's throats?

215
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,162
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won of you at betting?

216
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,662
Base is the slave that pays.

217
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,995
By this sword,
he that makes the first thrust,

218
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,935
I'll kill him,
by this sword, I will.

219
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,909
If ever you come of women,
come in quickly to Sir John.

220
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:21,936
He is so shaked with
a burning quotidian fever...

221
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:24,682
that it is most lamentable
to behold.

222
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:27,852
Sweet men, come to him.

223
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:32,923
Poor Sir John.
[Crying]

224
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,650
A good portly man of faith.

225
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,328
[Men chattering, laughing]
## [Medieval]

226
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:45,270
[Man] Aye, to a cheerful look,
a pleasing eye...

227
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:48,436
and a most noble carriage.
[Laughing continues]

228
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:59,348
But do I not dwindle?
[Laughing continues]

229
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,886
My skin hangs about me
like an old lady's loose gown.

230
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:09,827
Company, villainous company
have been the spoil of me.

231
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,628
[Shouts, laughs]

232
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,298
Whoo!
Hey! Hey!

233
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,801
I was as virtuous
as a gentleman need to be. [snickers]

234
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,842
Virtuous enough.
Swore a little.

235
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,512
- [Murmuring in protest]
- [Clears throat]

236
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,648
Diced not above
seven days a week.

237
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,220
Went to a bawdy house
not above once in the quarter.

238
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,481
- Ohhh!
- [Shouting]

239
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,492
Paid money that I borrowed,

240
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:46,094
three or four times.

241
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,025
Lived well
and in good compass.

242
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,566
What? You were so fat,
Sir John,

243
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,600
that you must indeed
be out of all compass.

244
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:01,406
Do thou amend thy face,
and I'll amend my life.

245
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:03,377
[Men laughing]

246
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,674
[Sir John, Nell laughing]

247
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,487
[Exclaims, laughs]
[Laughing]

248
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,552
[Panting]

249
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:21,062
If sack and sugar be a fault,
then God help the wicked.

250
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:25,200
Mmm? If to be old
and merry is a sin,

251
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:28,473
if to be fat
is to be hated,

252
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:33,743
then no, my good lord,
when thou art king,

253
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,950
banish Pistol, banish Bardolph,
banish Nym.

254
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,679
But sweet Jack Falstaff,

255
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,215
Aliant Jack Falstaff,

256
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:50,619
and therefore more valiant
being as he is,

257
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:53,623
old Jack falstaff,

258
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,925
banish not him
thy Harry's company.

259
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:01,639
Banish plump Jack,
and banish all the world.

260
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,539
[Harry's voice]
I do. I will.

261
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:17,716
[Whispering] but we have heard the
chimes at midnight, master Harry.

262
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,660
[Whispers]
Jesus.

263
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:27,789
The days that we have seen.

264
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:33,468
[Harry's voice]
I know thee not, old man.

265
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:49,011
[Hoofbeats passing]

266
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:51,682
[Dog barking]

267
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:58,295
The king hath run
bad humors on the knight.

268
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,892
Nym, thou hast
spoke the right.

269
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,806
His heart is fracted
and... corroborate.

270
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:11,900
The king's a good king,

271
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:14,776
but it must be as it may.

272
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,308
He passes some humors
and careers.

273
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:21,680
Let us condole the knight,

274
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:26,683
for, lambkins,
we will live.

275
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:39,870
The French, advised
by good intelligence...

276
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:42,200
of this most dreadful
preparation,

277
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:43,741
shake in their fear...

278
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:47,907
and with pale policy seek
to divert the English purposes.

279
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:53,073
Oh, England, model
to thy inward greatness.

280
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:56,086
Like a little body
with a mighty heart.

281
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,051
What mightst thou do
that honor would thee do...

282
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,885
were all thy children
kind and natural?

283
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:06,593
But see, thy fault France
hath in thee found out.

284
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:11,228
A nest of hollow bosoms which he
fills with treacherous crowns...

285
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,363
and three corrupted men.

286
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,767
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge,

287
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:18,535
and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham,

288
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:21,976
and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, knight,
of Northumberland,

289
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:25,239
have for the gilt of France...
oh, guilt indeed...

290
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:28,476
confirmed conspiracy
with fearful France,

291
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:32,750
and by their hands
this grace of kings must die,

292
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:34,682
ere he take ship for France.

293
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:36,618
The traitors are agreed.

294
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:38,797
The king is set from London,

295
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,563
and the scene
is now transported, gentles,

296
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:44,760
to Southhampton.

297
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,616
Before God, his grace is bold
to trust these traitors.

298
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,516
They shall be apprehended
by and by.

299
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:05,282
How smooth and even
they do bear themselves,

300
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:09,283
as if allegiance in their bosoms sat
crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

301
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:13,794
The king hath note of all they intend by
interception which they dream not of.

302
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,867
Nay, but the man
that was his bedfellow,

303
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:18,730
whom he hath dulled and cloyed
with gracious favors...

304
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:21,932
That he should,
for a foreign purse,

305
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,101
so sell his sovereign's life
to death and treachery. [clatter]

306
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:36,112
Now sits the wind fair,
and we will aboard. [chuckles]

307
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,995
My lord of Cambridge
and my kind lord of Masham...

308
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,495
and you, my gentle knight,
give me your thoughts.

309
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,530
Think you not that
the powers we bear with us...

310
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:54,367
will cut their passage
through the force of France?

311
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,873
No doubt, my liege, if each man
do his best. I doubt not that.

312
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,711
Never was monarch better feared
and loved than is your majesty.

313
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,008
We therefore have great
cause of thankfulness.

314
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:08,976
Uncle of Exeter, enlarge the
man committed yesterday...

315
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,084
that railed against
our person.

316
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:15,520
We consider it was excess of
wine that set him on, [all chuckle]

317
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:17,455
And on his more advice
we pardon him.

318
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:20,063
That's mercy,
but too much security.

319
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:25,193
Let him be punished, lest example breed
by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

320
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,167
Oh, let us yet be merciful.

321
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,844
So may your highness,
and yet punish too.

322
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:35,812
Sir, you show great mercy
if you give him life...

323
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:38,007
after the taste
of much correction.

324
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:41,812
Alas, your too much love
and care of me...

325
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:44,287
are heavy orisons
against this poor wretch.

326
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,750
If little faults proceeding on
distemper shall not be winked at,

327
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:55,898
how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes, chewed,

328
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:58,525
swallowed and digested,
appear before us?

329
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:03,436
We'll yet enlarge that man,

330
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:06,373
though Cambridge,
Scroop and Grey,

331
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:10,036
in their dear care
and tender preservation...

332
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:13,049
of our person
would have him punished.

333
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,413
And now to
our French causes.

334
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,790
Who are the late commissioners?
[Cambridge] I one, my lord.

335
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,054
Your highness bade me
ask for it today. So did you me.

336
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,954
- And I.
- Then, Richard Earl of cambridge, there is yours.

337
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,665
There yours,
Lord Scroop of Masham,

338
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:32,302
and sir knight, Grey of
Northumberland, this same is yours.

339
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:33,798
Read them...

340
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:35,337
and know...

341
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,942
I know your worthiness.

342
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:44,513
My Lord of Westmoreland,
uncle Exeter, we will aboard tonight.

343
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,020
Why, how now, gentlemen

344
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:55,723
what see you in those papers
that you lose so much complexion?

345
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:59,653
I do confess my fault and do
submit me to your highness' mercy.

346
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:03,667
- To which we all appeal.
- The mercy that was quick in us of late...

347
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,033
by your own counsel
is suppressed and killed.

348
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:10,273
You must not dare for shame
to talk of mercy!

349
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:15,809
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
as dogs upon their masters worrying you.

350
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,845
- [Shouting]
- [All shouting]

351
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:31,990
See you, my princes and my noble
peers, these English monsters.

352
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,363
What shall I say to thee,
Lord Scroop,

353
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,968
thou cruel, ingrateful,

354
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:42,472
savage and inhuman creature?

355
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:45,507
Thou knave thou!

356
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:48,978
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
that knewest the very bottom of my soul,

357
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,073
that almost mightst have
coined me into gold,

358
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:53,649
which thou have practiced
on me for thy use.

359
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,488
May it be possible
that foreign hire...

360
00:27:56,488 --> 00:28:00,857
could out of thee extract one spark
of evil that might annoy my finger?

361
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:02,990
'Tis so strange...

362
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:07,258
that though the truth of it stand
off as gross as black and white,

363
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:09,761
my eye will scarcely see it.

364
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:15,066
So... constant and unspotted
didst thou seem...

365
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:19,007
that this thy fall
hath left a kind of blot...

366
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:22,239
to mark
the full-fraught man...

367
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:26,005
and best indued
with some suspicion.

368
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:33,247
I will weep for thee.

369
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:38,991
For this revolt of thine, methinks,
is like another fall of man.

370
00:28:57,449 --> 00:29:01,215
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Richard Earl of Cambridge.

371
00:29:03,755 --> 00:29:07,486
I arrest thee of high treason by the name
of Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland.

372
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:14,062
I arrest thee of high treason by the
name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.

373
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:21,230
Hear your sentence.

374
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,399
You have conspired
against our royal person,

375
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:27,110
joined with an enemy
proclaimed and from his coffers...

376
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,475
received the golden earnest
of our death wherein.

377
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,809
You would have sold your king
to slaughter,

378
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:34,144
his princes and his peers
to servitude,

379
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:36,117
his subjects to oppression
and contempt...

380
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:39,323
and his whole kingdom
into desolation!

381
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:46,291
Get you therefore hence, poor
miserable wretches, to your death,

382
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:50,832
the taste whereof God of his mercy
give you patience to endure...

383
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:55,234
and true repentance
of all your dear offenses.

384
00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:58,970
Bear them hence.

385
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:01,505
[Men shouting]

386
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:08,342
Now, Lords, for France,

387
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,981
the enterprise whereof shall
be to you, as us, like glorious,

388
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,158
since God so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way.

389
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:18,890
Cheerly to sea.

390
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:21,493
The signs of war advance.

391
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:25,668
No king of England
if not king of France.

392
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:07,836
[Sighs]

393
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:12,710
Prithee, honey-sweet husband,
let me bring thee to staines.

394
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:17,683
No, for my manly heart
doth yearn.

395
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:21,723
Bardolph, be blithe.

396
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:26,353
Nym, rouse
thy vaunting veins.

397
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:30,966
Boy, bristle
thy courage up.

398
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:34,296
For Falstaff is dead,

399
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:37,401
and we must yearn therefore.

400
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:40,843
Would I were with him, wheresome'er
he is, either in heaven or in hell.

401
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,310
Nay, sure,
he's not in hell.

402
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:46,247
He's in Arthur's bosom, if ever
a man went to Arthur's bosom.

403
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:51,281
He made a finer end and went away
an it had been any Christian child.

404
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,328
He parted even
just between 12:00 and 1:00,

405
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:01,732
even at the turning of the tide.

406
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:06,362
For after I saw him
fumble with the sheets...

407
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:11,036
and play with flowers and
smile upon his finger's ends,

408
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:15,105
I knew there was
but one way.

409
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,809
For his nose
was as sharp as a pen,

410
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:26,114
and he babbled of green fields.

411
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:30,252
"How now, Sir John," quoth I.

412
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:31,794
"What, man?
Be of good cheer."

413
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:37,663
So he cried out,
"God, God,

414
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:40,864
God,"

415
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:44,636
Three or four times.

416
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:52,243
Now I, to comfort him, bid him
he should not think of God.

417
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:55,513
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself
with any such thoughts yet.

418
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,418
He bade me put
more clothes on his feet.

419
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:07,029
I put my hand under the bed
and felt them,

420
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:13,130
and they were as cold
as any stone.

421
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:18,003
Then I felt to his knees,

422
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:24,573
and so upward... and upward,

423
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:30,988
and all was as...

424
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:34,982
cold as any stone.

425
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:45,303
They say he cried out for sack.
[Laughs] That he did.

426
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,365
And of women.
No, that he did not.

427
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,897
[Boy]
Yeah, that he did.

428
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,109
He said they were...
devils incarnate.

429
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:54,844
He could never abide carnation.
It was a color he never liked.

430
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:59,074
He said once the devil
would have him about women.

431
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:04,388
Well, he did in some sort...
handle women.

432
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:06,022
[Laughing]

433
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:09,626
But then he was rheumatic and
talked of the whore of Babylon.

434
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:14,124
Do you not remember he saw a flea
stick upon Bardolph's nose?

435
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:17,592
He said it was a black soul
burning in hell. [chuckling]

436
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:20,867
Well, the fuel is gone
that maintained that fire.

437
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:23,098
That's all the riches
I got in his service.

438
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:29,578
Whall we shog?

439
00:34:30,982 --> 00:34:32,779
The king will be gone
from Southampton.

440
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:50,999
Farewell, hostess.

441
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:54,895
I cannot kiss.

442
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,035
That's the humor of it.

443
00:34:58,009 --> 00:34:59,237
But...

444
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:06,916
Adieu.

445
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:23,766
Let housewifery appear.

446
00:35:25,136 --> 00:35:27,468
[Chuckles]
Keep close.

447
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:32,341
I thee command.

448
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:35,638
[Knocking]

449
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:38,480
Farewell.

450
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:51,993
[Whispers]
Adieu.

451
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,497
[Chorus]
Follow, follow.

452
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:06,271
For who is he whose chin is but
enriched with one appearing hair...

453
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:10,313
that will not follow these
culled and choice-drawn cavaliers...

454
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,449
to France?

455
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:38,405
Thus comes the English...
with full power upon us,

456
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:45,577
and more than carefully it us concerns
to answer royally in our defenses.

457
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,445
Therefore,
the dukes of Berri...

458
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:52,913
and of Bretagne,

459
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:57,222
of Brabant and of Orleans
shall make forth.

460
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,493
And you, prince Dauphin...

461
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,156
My most redoubted father,

462
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:05,700
it is most meet we arm us
against the foe.

463
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,768
For peace itself
should not so dull a kingdom,

464
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,703
but the defenses, musters,
preparations should be maintained,

465
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,608
assembled and collected,
as were a war in expectation.

466
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:19,144
Therefore, I say 'tis meet
we all go forth to view...

467
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,480
the sick and feeble
parts of France.

468
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:24,715
And let us do it
with no show of fear!

469
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,225
No, with no more than if we heard
that England were busied with,

470
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:31,453
uh, a Whitsun morris dance.
[Chuckling]

471
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:35,396
For, my good liege, she is so idly
kinged by a vain, giddy, shallow,

472
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:37,967
humorous youth,
that fear attends her not.

473
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:39,567
O peace, prince dauphin.

474
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:42,299
You're too much mistaken
in this king.

475
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,705
Question, your grace,
the late ambassadors.

476
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,080
With what great state
he heard their embassy,

477
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,947
how well supplied
with noble counselors,

478
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:56,778
how modest in exception
and withal how terrible...

479
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:58,853
in constant resolution.

480
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:06,023
Well, 'tis not so,
my lord high constable.

481
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:09,195
Though we think it so,
'tis no matter.

482
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:12,797
In matters of defense, 'tis best to weigh
the enemy more mighty than he seems.

483
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:15,671
Think we king Harry strong.

484
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:22,370
And, princes, look you
strongly armed to meet him.

485
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:26,549
For he is bred
out of that bloody strain...

486
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:29,949
that haunted us
in our familiar paths.

487
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,856
Witness our too-much
memorable shame...

488
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:37,553
when cressy battle
fatally was struck...

489
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:42,399
and all our princes captived...

490
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,131
by the hand
of that black name,

491
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:47,734
Edward,

492
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:50,766
black prince of Wales.

493
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:58,575
This is a stem
of that victorious stalk.

494
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:02,848
And let us fear
the native mightiness...

495
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,487
and fate of him.

496
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:14,529
[Door opens]
[Footsteps approaching]

497
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:29,878
Ambassadors from Harry, king of England,
do crave admittance to your majesty.

498
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:34,244
Go and bring them.

499
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:40,256
You see, this chase
is hotly followed, friends.

500
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:50,897
Good my sovereign,
take up the English short,

501
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:54,672
and let them know of what a
monarchy you are the head.

502
00:39:56,741 --> 00:40:01,201
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile
a sin as self-neglecting.

503
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:04,574
[Door opens]

504
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:20,059
From our brother England?

505
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:24,267
From him, and thus
he greets your majesty.

506
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,835
He wills you, in the
name of God almighty,

507
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,640
that you divest yourself
and lay apart...

508
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:34,870
the borrowed glories
that by gift of heaven,

509
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:36,907
by law of nature
and of nations,

510
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:39,641
belongs to him
and to his heirs.

511
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:43,344
Namely, the crown.

512
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:46,720
Willing you overlook
this pedigree.

513
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,893
And when you find him
evenly derived...

514
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:55,261
from his most famed of famous
ancestors, Edward the III,

515
00:40:55,399 --> 00:41:01,167
he bids you then resign your crown
and kingdom, indirectly held from him,

516
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:04,035
the native and true challenger.

517
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:06,937
Or else what follows?

518
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:10,876
Bloody constraint.

519
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:15,445
For if you hide the crown,
even in your hearts,

520
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:18,052
there will he rake for it.

521
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:21,751
Therefore, in fierce
tempest is he coming,

522
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:24,951
in thunder and in earthquake,
like a Jove,

523
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:28,660
that if requiring fail,
he will compel.

524
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:34,503
This is his claim,
his threatening and my message.

525
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:38,840
Unless the Dauphin
be in presence here,

526
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,376
to whom expressly
I bring greeting to.

527
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:43,713
For the Dauphin,

528
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,940
I stand here for him.

529
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:55,616
What to him from England?

530
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:58,521
Scorn and defiance,

531
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:02,026
slight regard, contempt...

532
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:06,200
and anything that might not
misbecome the mighty sender,

533
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:08,735
doth he prize you at.

534
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,597
Thus says my king.

535
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:16,446
Say, if my father render a fair
return, it is against my will,

536
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:18,606
for I desire nothing
but odds with England.

537
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:22,750
And to that end, as matching
to his youth and vanity,

538
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:25,478
I did present him
with the Paris balls!

539
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:28,555
He'll make your Paris Louvre
shake for it.

540
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:32,621
And be assured
you'll find a difference,

541
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:35,188
as we, his subjects,
have in wonder found,

542
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:38,897
between the promise of his greener
days and these he masters now.

543
00:42:41,072 --> 00:42:42,437
Tomorrow...

544
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,032
Shall you know
our mind at full.

545
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:56,386
[Chorus] Thus with imagined wing
our swift scene flies,

546
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,015
in motion of no less celerity
than that of thought! [explosion]

547
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:05,253
Work, work your thoughts, and
in them see a siege! [men shouting]

548
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:07,020
Behold the ordinance
on their carriages,

549
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,929
with fatal mouths gaping
on girded harflew.

550
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:13,904
Suppose the ambassador
from the French comes back,

551
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,599
tells Harry that the king does
offer him Katherine, his daughter,

552
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:19,505
and with her to dowry, some
petty and unprofitable dukedoms.

553
00:43:19,644 --> 00:43:21,544
The offer likes him not.

554
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:24,772
And the nimble gunner with linstock
now the devilish cannon touches,

555
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:27,908
and down goes all before them!

556
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,785
[Explosion]
[Shouting continues]

557
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:41,487
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends!

558
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:45,828
Once more, or close the wall up
with our English dead!

559
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:47,768
[Explosion]

560
00:43:56,781 --> 00:44:00,376
In peace there's nothing so becomes a
man as modest stillness and humility.

561
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:02,848
But when the blast of war
blows in our ears,

562
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:04,682
then imitate the action
of the tiger!

563
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:07,122
Stiffen the sinews,
summon up the blood,

564
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,824
disguise fair nature
with hard-favored rage.

565
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,053
Then lend the eye
a terrible aspect.

566
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:14,859
Let it pry through the portage of
the head like the brass cannon.

567
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:18,093
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as
fearfully as doth a galled rock...

568
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:20,403
o'erhang and jetty
his confounded base,

569
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:22,698
swilled with the wild
and wasteful ocean.

570
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,105
Now set the teeth
and stretch the nostril wide,

571
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:31,306
hold hard the breath and bend up
every spirit to his full height!

572
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:34,876
On, on, you noblest England!

573
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:36,811
[Explosion]

574
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:44,050
Now attest that those whom you
called fathers did beget you.

575
00:44:44,428 --> 00:44:47,795
And you, good yeoman, whose
limbs were made in England,

576
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:49,627
show us here the mettle
of your pasture.

577
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,133
Let us swear that you are worth
your breeding, which I doubt not!

578
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:58,965
For there is none of you so mean and base
that hath not noble luster in your eyes!

579
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:03,342
I see you stand like greyhounds in
the slips, straining upon the start.

580
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:06,143
The game's afoot!
Follow your spirit,

581
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:10,044
and upon this charge, cry,
"God for Harry,

582
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:14,049
England and Saint George!"

583
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,021
[All] God for harry,
England and Saint George!

584
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:22,961
[All shouting]

585
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:26,795
[Shouts of
encouragement]

586
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:33,874
Up to the breach,
you dogs!

587
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,241
Avaunt, you cullions!

588
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:48,118
[Panting]

589
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,920
Captain Fluellen, you must
come presently to the mines.

590
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:53,153
The duke of Gloucester
would speak with you.

591
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:56,228
Tell the duke it is not so good
to come to the mines.

592
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,836
For look you, the mines is not
according to the disciplines of war.

593
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:03,707
By Cheshu, I think he will
blow up all,

594
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:06,035
if there is not
better direction. [explosion]

595
00:46:07,645 --> 00:46:09,237
The duke of Gloucester,
to whom the order...

596
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:13,042
of the siege is given, is altogether
directed by an Irishman.

597
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:16,718
[Trumpet blowing]
It's Captain Macmorris, is it not?

598
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:20,185
- I think it be.
- By Cheshu, he is an ass in the world.

599
00:46:20,524 --> 00:46:22,515
[Chuckles]
He has no more directions...

600
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:25,957
in the true disciplines of the
wars than is a puppy dog.

601
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:30,330
Here he comes, and the Scots
captain, Captain Jamy, with him.

602
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:34,229
Oh, no, Captain Jamy is a marvelous,
valorous gentleman, that is certain.

603
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:38,799
I say... good day,
Captain Fluellen.

604
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:41,034
Good day to your worship,
good Captain James.

605
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:44,376
How now, Captain Macmorris?
Have you quit the mines? By Christ, la.

606
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:46,479
The workish give over.

607
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:48,151
The trumpets
sound the retreat.

608
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:50,377
By my hand,
'tis ill done.

609
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:53,688
Captain Macmorris,
I beseech you now,

610
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:57,189
a few disputations as partly
touching the disciplines of the war,

611
00:46:57,394 --> 00:46:59,624
partly to satisfy
my opinion...

612
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:02,188
and partly for
the satisfaction of my mind,

613
00:47:02,566 --> 00:47:05,330
as touching the direction
of the military discipline.

614
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:08,638
That is the point. It is no time
to discourse, so Christ save me.

615
00:47:08,672 --> 00:47:10,970
The town is besieged, and the
trumpet calls us to the breach.

616
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:13,234
We talk, and, by Christ,
do nothing.

617
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:16,544
By the mass, ere these eyes of mine
take themselves to slumber,

618
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:20,348
I'll do good service, or I'll
lie in the ground for it.

619
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:23,047
Captain Macmorris,
I think, look you,

620
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,754
under your correction, there
are not many of your nation.

621
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,852
[Explosion]
What is my nation?

622
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,791
Who talks of my nation
is a villain...

623
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:35,057
and a bastard and a knave
and a rascal?

624
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:39,997
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise
than it is meant, Captain Macmorris,

625
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:42,163
peradventure I shall think
you do not use me...

626
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:46,972
with that affability as in discretion
you ought to use me, now look you,

627
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:49,909
being as good
a man as yourself.

628
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:52,839
I do not know you
so good a man as myself.

629
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:56,252
So Christ save me,
I will cut off your head!

630
00:48:00,858 --> 00:48:02,450
[Shouts]
[Rumbling]

631
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:10,066
[Men shouting]

632
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:16,900
[Explosion]

633
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:26,375
How yet resolves
the governor of the town?

634
00:48:27,885 --> 00:48:30,353
This is the latest parle
we will admit.

635
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:34,251
Therefore, to our best mercy
give yourselves,

636
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:37,952
or, like to men proud of
destruction, defy us to our worst.

637
00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:42,256
For as I am a soldier, if I
begin the battery once again,

638
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:44,461
I will not leave
the half-achieved Harflew...

639
00:48:44,802 --> 00:48:47,430
till in her ashes
she lie buried.

640
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:50,731
Therefore,
you men of Harflew,

641
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:53,835
take pity of your town
and of your people...

642
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:56,980
whiles yet my soldiers
are in my command,

643
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:00,784
whiles yet the cool
and temperate wind of grace...

644
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:04,647
o'erblows the filthy
and contagious clouds...

645
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:09,421
of heady murder,
spoil and villainy!

646
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:14,960
If not, why, in a moment
look to see...

647
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,999
the blind and bloody
soldier with foul hand...

648
00:49:19,203 --> 00:49:22,773
defile the locks of your shrill,
shrieking daughters,

649
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:25,298
your fathers taken
by their silvered beards...

650
00:49:25,442 --> 00:49:27,808
and their most reverend heads
dashed to the walls,

651
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:31,770
your naked infants
spitted upon pikes...

652
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:36,648
whiles the mad mothers
with their howls confused...

653
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,378
do break the clouds!

654
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:42,014
What say you?

655
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:46,025
Will you yield and this avoid?

656
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:49,789
Or, guilty in defense,

657
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,398
be thus destroyed?

658
00:49:53,437 --> 00:49:56,998
The Dauphin, of whose
succor we entreated,

659
00:49:57,207 --> 00:50:02,474
returns us that his powers are not
yet ready to raise so great a siege.

660
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,272
Therefore, dread king,

661
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:11,487
enter our gates,
dispose of us and ours,

662
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:16,751
for we no longer
are defensible.

663
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:20,892
[Sighs]

664
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,483
Go you and enter Harflew.

665
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:52,093
There remain and fortify it
strongly against the French.

666
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:56,057
Use... mercy to them all.

667
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:02,735
For us, dear uncle,
the winter coming on...

668
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:05,701
and sickness growing
upon our soldiers,

669
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:08,969
we will retire to Calais.

670
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:15,443
Tonight... in Harflew
will we be your guest.

671
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,213
Tomorrow... for the march
are we addressed.

672
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,671
[Kisses,
whispers in french]//[cooing]

673
00:51:46,383 --> 00:51:47,611
Alice.

674
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:55,282
[Sighs]

675
00:51:57,661 --> 00:51:59,458
Alice,
tu as ete en angleterre,

676
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:01,587
et tu parles bien le langage.

677
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:03,957
Un peu, madame.

678
00:52:05,002 --> 00:52:06,560
Je te prie, m'enseignez.

679
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:09,864
Il faut que j'apprenne
a parler.

680
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:13,275
Comment appelez-vous
la main en anglais?

681
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,440
La main?
Elle est appelee"de" hand.

682
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:20,408
"De hand."
Mm-hmm.

683
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:23,079
Et les doigts?

684
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:26,315
Les doigts?
Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts.

685
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,685
Mais je me souviendrai.
Les doigts?

686
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:32,450
Je pense qu'ils sont appeles
"de fingres."

687
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:38,901
Le main, de hand.
Le doigts, de fingres.

688
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:40,834
Mm-hmm.

689
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:43,705
Je pense que je suis
le bon ecolier.

690
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:45,739
J'ai gagne deux mots
d'anglais vitement. [mutters]

691
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:49,237
Comment appelez-vous les ongles?
Les ongles?

692
00:52:49,346 --> 00:52:51,007
Nous les appelons
de nails.

693
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:53,908
"De nails."

694
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:57,646
Ecoutez, dites-moi
si je parle bien.

695
00:52:57,888 --> 00:53:04,020
De hand, de fingres
etde nails.

696
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:07,189
C'est bien dit, madame.
Il est fort bon anglais. [laughs]

697
00:53:08,565 --> 00:53:10,260
Dites-moi I'anglais
pour le bras.

698
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:12,726
De arm, madame.
Et le coude?

699
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:14,836
D'elbow.

700
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:17,405
"D'elbow."

701
00:53:19,443 --> 00:53:20,637
Je m'en fais la repetition...

702
00:53:20,744 --> 00:53:23,770
De tous les mots que vous
m'avez appris des a present.

703
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:27,181
Il est trop difficile,
madame, comme je pense.

704
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:30,344
Excusez-moi, Alice,
ecoutez: De hand, de fingres,

705
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:34,487
de nails, de "arma,"
de "bilbow."//d'elbow, madame.

706
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:36,955
O, seigneur dieu,
je m'en oublie! D'elbow.

707
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:39,761
Comment appelez-vous
le col?

708
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:41,692
De "nick," madame.

709
00:53:42,032 --> 00:53:44,023
- "De nick."
- Mmm.

710
00:53:44,334 --> 00:53:47,531
Et le menton?
De chin.

711
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:50,030
"De chin."

712
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:53,036
Le col, de nick.

713
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:55,340
Le menton, de chin.

714
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:59,115
Oui, sauf votre honneur,
en verite,

715
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:02,309
vous prononcez les mots aussi
droit que les natifs d'angleterre.

716
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,987
Je ne doute point d'apprendre par la
grace de dieu, et en peu de temps.

717
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:09,156
N'avez-vous pas deja oublie
ce que je vous ai enseigne?

718
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:11,760
Non, je reciterai
a vous promptement:

719
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:16,490
De hand, de fingres.
Tsk. Mmm.

720
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,932
- De "mails"?
- De nails, madame.

721
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:20,660
"De nails, madame."
[Chuckling]

722
00:54:20,771 --> 00:54:24,730
- De arma, de belbow.
- Sauf votre honneur, d'elbow.

723
00:54:25,242 --> 00:54:28,075
Ainsi dis-je:
D'elbow, de nick, [mutters]

724
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:30,807
Etde chin.
Oh.

725
00:54:32,182 --> 00:54:34,241
Comment appelez-vous
le pied et la robe?

726
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:38,684
De foot, madame,
et de coun.

727
00:54:39,156 --> 00:54:42,648
- F-footet 'le coun.
- Mmm.

728
00:54:44,595 --> 00:54:46,722
[Both chuckling]

729
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:48,592
O seigneur dieu!

730
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:52,733
Ce sont mots de son mauvais
corruptible,

731
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:55,966
Gros, et impudique et non pour
les dames d'honneur d'user.

732
00:54:56,473 --> 00:55:00,136
Je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devants
les seigneurs de france pour tout le monde.

733
00:55:00,877 --> 00:55:03,869
De footet 'le coun!
[Laughing]

734
00:55:04,181 --> 00:55:05,842
[Chuckling]

735
00:55:09,252 --> 00:55:12,881
Neanmoins, je reciterai une
autre fois ma lecon ensemble.

736
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:16,758
- De hand, de fingres,
- [chuckling]

737
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:19,661
De nails, de arma, de...
[gibberish]

738
00:55:20,564 --> 00:55:23,897
De nick, de chin, de foot
et 'le coun!

739
00:55:24,968 --> 00:55:26,993
[Chattering, chuckling
continue]

740
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:52,822
'Tis certain...
He hath passed the river Somme.

741
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:57,225
And if he be not fought withal,
my lord, let us not live in France.

742
00:55:57,734 --> 00:56:01,693
Normans.
But bastard Normans!

743
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:04,235
Norman... bastards!

744
00:56:04,374 --> 00:56:08,242
Where have they this mettle is not
their climate foggy, raw and dull?

745
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:11,506
- O, for honor of our land.
- By faith and honor,

746
00:56:11,615 --> 00:56:15,813
our madams mock at us and
plainly say our mettle is bred out!

747
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:23,217
And they will give their bodies
to the lust of English youth...

748
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,228
to new-store France
with bastard warriors!

749
00:56:29,232 --> 00:56:31,700
Where is Montjoy, the herald?

750
00:56:33,203 --> 00:56:34,693
Speed him hence.

751
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,070
Let him greet England
with our sharp defiance.

752
00:56:40,677 --> 00:56:42,076
Up, princes,

753
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:46,243
and with spirit of honor edged
more sharper than your swords,

754
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,578
hie to the field.

755
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:52,087
Bar Harry England,

756
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:55,350
that sweeps through our land...

757
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:58,120
with pennons painted
in the blood of Harflew.

758
00:56:58,895 --> 00:57:02,695
Go down upon him.
You have power enough.

759
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:08,627
And in a captive chariot into
Rouen bring him our prisoner.

760
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:13,268
This becomes the great.

761
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:16,102
Sorry am I his numbers
are so few,

762
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,878
his soldiers sick and famished
in their march.

763
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:21,374
For I am sure when he
shall see our army,

764
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:24,712
he'll drop his heart
into the sink of fear...

765
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:27,619
and, for achievement,
offer us his ransom.

766
00:57:27,824 --> 00:57:33,262
Therefore, lord constable,
haste on montjoy.

767
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:39,792
Prince Dauphin,
you shall stay with us in Rouen.

768
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,704
Not so, I do beseech
your majesty.

769
00:57:42,806 --> 00:57:45,775
Be patient, for you
shall remain with us!

770
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:51,712
Now forth, lord constable
and princes all,

771
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:55,983
and quickly bring us word
of England's fall.

772
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:01,315
[Man shouting]

773
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:29,179
[Man shouting]

774
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:03,282
[Hoofbeats approaching]

775
00:59:11,661 --> 00:59:17,566
[Hoofbeats galloping,
horse whinnies] [man shouts]

776
00:59:18,902 --> 00:59:20,494
Come. Come in.

777
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,770
Captain Fluellen?

778
00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:31,544
Come you from the bridge?
Is the duke of Exeter safe?

779
00:59:32,115 --> 00:59:35,050
De is not...
God be praised and blessed...

780
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:39,913
any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge
most valiantly, with excellent discipline.

781
00:59:41,892 --> 00:59:45,919
Captain! I thee beseech
to do me favors.

782
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:50,122
The duke of Exeter
doth love thee well.

783
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,759
Aye, I praise God, and I have
merited some love at his hands.

784
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:58,139
Bardolph, a soldier firm
and sound of heart...

785
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:00,434
and buxom valor,

786
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:06,444
hath by cruel fate and giddy
fortune's furious, fickle wheel...

787
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,414
Touching your patience,
Ancient Pistol,

788
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,780
fortune is an excellent moral.

789
01:00:13,456 --> 01:00:17,187
Fortune is Bardolph's foe
and frowns on him...

790
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,792
for he hath stolen a pax
and hanged must he be.

791
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:24,325
Therefore, go speak.

792
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:27,762
The duke will hear thy voice.

793
01:00:29,773 --> 01:00:32,606
Speak, captain, for his life,

794
01:00:33,043 --> 01:00:35,477
and I will thee requite.

795
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:39,979
Ancient Pistol, I do partly
understand your meaning.

796
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:43,514
Why, then,
rejoice therefore!

797
01:00:44,821 --> 01:00:47,153
'Tis not a thing
to rejoice at.

798
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:51,486
Look you, if he
were my brother,

799
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:54,321
I would desire the duke
to do his good pleasure...

800
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:56,658
and put him to execution.

801
01:00:58,535 --> 01:01:00,025
[Fluellen]
Discipline ought to be used.

802
01:01:02,872 --> 01:01:04,533
Then die and be damned...

803
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:08,808
and figo for thy friendship!

804
01:01:23,793 --> 01:01:26,318
How now, Fluellen,
comest thou from the bridge?

805
01:01:26,763 --> 01:01:28,492
Aye, so please your majesty.

806
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:32,126
The duke of Exeter hath very
gallantly maintained the bridge.

807
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:35,798
What men have you lost?

808
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:38,530
I think the duke
hath lost never a man...

809
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:46,538
but one that is like to be
executed for robbing a church.

810
01:01:48,685 --> 01:01:51,745
One Bardolph, if
your majesty know the man.

811
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:56,425
[Fluellen] His face is all bubukles and
whelks and knobs and flames of fire.

812
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:59,518
His lips blows at his nose.

813
01:01:59,696 --> 01:02:02,392
[Fluellen] 'tis like a coal of fire...
sometimes blue, sometimes red.

814
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:07,996
But his nose is executed
and his fire's out.

815
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:15,040
Get up!

816
01:02:24,487 --> 01:02:26,682
[Thunder rumbling]

817
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:38,324
[Man]
Shh!

818
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:45,136
[Shouts]
[Cheering]

819
01:02:45,275 --> 01:02:46,970
- Oh!
- [Laughs]

820
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,942
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- [Laughs]

821
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:51,740
[Laughing]

822
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,676
[Laughing]

823
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:04,488
Do not, when thou art king,
hang a thief.

824
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,592
No,

825
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:15,000
thou shalt.

826
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,143
[Thunder rumbling]

827
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:52,174
We would have all such offenders
so cut off.

828
01:03:55,512 --> 01:03:57,503
We give express charge
that in our marches...

829
01:03:57,714 --> 01:04:01,241
through the country there be nothing
compelled from the villages,

830
01:04:01,784 --> 01:04:04,685
nothing taken but paid for,

831
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:10,782
none of the French upbraided
or abused in disdainful language.

832
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:15,994
For when lenity and cruelty
play for a kingdom,

833
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:23,063
the gentler gamester
is the soonest winner.

834
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:51,557
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,

835
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,793
"though we seemed dead,
we did but sleep.

836
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,438
"Tell him we could have
rebuked him at Harflew.

837
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,403
"Now we speak,
and our voice is imperial.

838
01:05:00,476 --> 01:05:03,411
"England shall
repent his folly.

839
01:05:03,746 --> 01:05:05,737
"Bid him, therefore,
consider of his ransom...

840
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:08,250
"which must proportion
the losses we have borne...

841
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:12,013
"which in weight to re-answer
his pettiness would bow under.

842
01:05:12,222 --> 01:05:16,454
"To this add defiance,
and tell him, for conclusion,

843
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:18,718
"he hath betrayed
his followers...

844
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:20,752
whose condemnation
is pronounced."

845
01:05:22,398 --> 01:05:25,856
So far my king and master,
so much my office.

846
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:30,301
- What is thy name?
- Montjoy.

847
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,370
Thou dost thy office fairly.

848
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:38,838
Turn thee back, and tell
thy king I do not seek him now,

849
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:41,883
but could be willing to march on
to Calais without impeachment.

850
01:05:43,186 --> 01:05:45,347
Go, therefore,
tell thy master here I am.

851
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:49,148
My ransom is this
frail and worthless trunk,

852
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:52,859
my army but a weak
and sickly guard.

853
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,929
Yet, God before,
tell him we will come on,

854
01:05:56,332 --> 01:06:00,234
though France himself and such
another neighbor stand in our way.

855
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:03,067
So, Montjoy, fare you well.

856
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:05,770
The sum of all our answer
is but this:

857
01:06:06,276 --> 01:06:09,177
We would not seek
a battle as we are,

858
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,813
nor, as we are,
we say we will not shun it.

859
01:06:17,387 --> 01:06:18,911
So tell your master.

860
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:21,914
I shall deliver so.

861
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,054
Thanks to your majesty.

862
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,810
I hope they will not
come upon us now.

863
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:50,285
We are in god's hand, brother,
not in theirs.

864
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:53,512
[Thunderclap]

865
01:07:06,402 --> 01:07:07,733
March to the bridge.

866
01:07:08,338 --> 01:07:09,862
It now draws towards night.

867
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:12,903
Beyond the river
we'll encamp ourselves...

868
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:15,004
and on tomorrow...

869
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:21,580
bid them march away.

870
01:08:16,072 --> 01:08:18,973
Now entertain
conjecture of a time...

871
01:08:19,142 --> 01:08:22,077
when creeping murmur
and the poring dark...

872
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:25,339
fills the wide vessel
of the universe.

873
01:08:27,016 --> 01:08:30,782
From camp to camp through
the foul womb of night...

874
01:08:30,987 --> 01:08:33,455
the hum of either army
stilly sounds...

875
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:37,090
that the fixed sentinels
almost receive...

876
01:08:37,226 --> 01:08:39,023
the secret whispers
of each other's watch.

877
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:41,821
Fire answers fire,

878
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:43,999
and through their paly flames,

879
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,791
each battle sees
the other's umbered face.

880
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:49,930
Steed threatens steed
in high and boastful neighs,

881
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:51,966
piercing the night's dull ear.

882
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:54,371
And from the tents,

883
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:57,942
the armorers,
accomplishing the knights,

884
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:03,045
with busy hammers closing rivets up
give dreadful note of preparation.

885
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:06,986
Proud of their numbers
and secure in soul,

886
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,549
the confident
and over-lusty French...

887
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:12,059
do the low-rated English
play at dice...

888
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:16,061
and chide the cripple,
tardy-gaited night...

889
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:21,362
who, like a foul and ugly witch,
doth limp so tediously away.

890
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,318
[Horse whinnies]

891
01:09:40,089 --> 01:09:42,614
[Man] I have the best armor
in the world.

892
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,050
Would it were day.

893
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:48,528
[Man #2] you have an excellent armor,
but let my horse have his due.

894
01:09:51,033 --> 01:09:52,933
It is the best horse of Europe.

895
01:09:56,539 --> 01:09:58,166
Will it never be morning?

896
01:09:58,774 --> 01:10:00,708
## [Flute]
[Chattering continues]

897
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:02,870
My lord of Orleans
and my lord High Constable,

898
01:10:03,112 --> 01:10:05,376
you talk of horse and armor?

899
01:10:06,549 --> 01:10:08,779
You are as well provided of both
as any prince in the world.

900
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,249
I will not change my horse...

901
01:10:12,455 --> 01:10:15,083
for any that treads
but on four hooves.

902
01:10:16,959 --> 01:10:19,484
When I bestride him,
I soar.

903
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:24,332
I am a hawk, and he is
pure air and fire!

904
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,095
The dull elements of earth
and water never appear in him,

905
01:10:28,271 --> 01:10:32,173
but only impatient stillness
while his rider mounts him.

906
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:37,141
Indeed, my lord, it is a most
absolute and excellent horse.

907
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:41,141
[Chattering continues]

908
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:44,048
My lord constable,
the armor in your tent tonight...

909
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:45,684
Are those suns
or stars on it?

910
01:10:45,988 --> 01:10:48,354
Stars, Montjoy.

911
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:51,058
Some of them will
fall tomorrow, I hope.

912
01:10:51,294 --> 01:10:53,262
And yet my sky
shall not want.

913
01:10:58,334 --> 01:10:59,596
Will it never be day?

914
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:04,764
I will trot tomorrow a mile,

915
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:07,903
and my way shall be paved
with English faces.

916
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:13,275
I will not say so, for fear I
should be faced out of my way.

917
01:11:22,124 --> 01:11:23,716
I'll go arm myself.

918
01:11:25,394 --> 01:11:27,828
[Chattering continues]

919
01:11:30,433 --> 01:11:31,832
[Horse whinnies]

920
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:37,104
The Dauphin longs for morning.
He longs to eat the English.

921
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:38,996
I think he will eat
all he kills.

922
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:42,876
He never did harm that I heard of.
Nor will do none tomorrow.

923
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,044
Would it were day.
[Chattering continues]

924
01:11:49,118 --> 01:11:52,212
Alas, poor Harry of England.

925
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:56,982
He longs not for
the dawning as we do.

926
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:00,491
If the English had any apprehension,
they would run away.

927
01:12:01,163 --> 01:12:02,323
Hmph.

928
01:12:02,898 --> 01:12:05,560
That island of England
breeds very valiant creatures.

929
01:12:14,644 --> 01:12:16,236
Now is it time to arm.

930
01:12:17,146 --> 01:12:18,738
Come, shall we about it?

931
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:21,145
It is now 2:00.

932
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:25,018
But let me see, by 10:00, we shall
have each a hundred Englishmen.

933
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,590
The poor, condemned English,

934
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:36,531
like sacrifices,

935
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,597
by their watchful fires
sit patiently...

936
01:12:40,803 --> 01:12:44,705
and inly ruminate
the morning's danger.

937
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:57,313
[Chorus]
And their gesture sad,

938
01:12:57,553 --> 01:13:01,614
investing lank, lean cheeks
and war-worn coats,

939
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:04,885
presenteth them
unto the gazing moon...

940
01:13:06,562 --> 01:13:09,053
so many horrid ghosts.

941
01:13:09,498 --> 01:13:11,466
## [Flute]

942
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,565
Ahh.

943
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:32,152
[Laughing]

944
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:44,264
Oh, now,

945
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:48,632
who will behold the royal
captain of this ruined band,

946
01:13:50,005 --> 01:13:53,133
walking from watch to watch,
from tent to tent?

947
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:58,244
Let him cry,
"Praise and glory on his head,"

948
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:03,344
For forth he goes
and visits all his host.

949
01:14:04,353 --> 01:14:06,787
Bids them good morrow
with a modest smile...

950
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:11,786
and calls them "Brothers,
friends and countrymen."

951
01:14:13,262 --> 01:14:15,924
A largesse universal,
like the sun...

952
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:19,093
his liberal eye
doth give to everyone,

953
01:14:20,269 --> 01:14:21,998
thawing cold fear...

954
01:14:22,905 --> 01:14:25,100
that mean and gentle all...

955
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,839
behold, as may
unworthiness define,

956
01:14:29,912 --> 01:14:32,278
a little touch of Harry
in the night.

957
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:36,212
Good morrow, old
sir Thomas Erpingham.

958
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:40,279
A good soft pillow for that good white head
were better than a churlish turf of France.

959
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:44,389
Not so, my liege.
This lodging likes me better...

960
01:14:45,127 --> 01:14:48,290
since I may say,
"Now lie I like a king."

961
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:51,861
[Chuckles]
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.

962
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:56,460
Brothers both, commend me
to the princes in our camp.

963
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:59,607
Do my good morrow to them, and
anon desire them all to my pavilion.

964
01:15:00,342 --> 01:15:01,502
We shall, my liege.

965
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:08,847
Shall I attend your grace?
No, my good knight.

966
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:12,410
I and my bosom
must debate a while,

967
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:15,450
and then I would
no other company.

968
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:19,719
The lord in heaven
bless thee, noble Harry.

969
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,064
God have mercy, old heart.

970
01:15:29,538 --> 01:15:31,335
Thou speakest cheerfully.

971
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,274
[Clears throat]
Qui va la?

972
01:15:44,954 --> 01:15:46,444
A friend.

973
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:48,822
Discuss unto me.

974
01:15:50,226 --> 01:15:51,693
Art thou officer...

975
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:55,359
or art thou base,
common and popular?

976
01:15:56,665 --> 01:15:58,462
I am a gentleman of a company.

977
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:02,599
Trailest thou
the puissant pike? Even so.

978
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:07,540
What are you?
As good a gentleman as the emperor.

979
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,101
Ah, then you are a better
than the king.

980
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:16,440
The king's a bawcock
and a heart of gold,

981
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,088
a lad of life,
an imp of fame,

982
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,825
of parents good,
of fist most valiant.

983
01:16:26,395 --> 01:16:28,158
I kiss his dirty shoe,

984
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:32,696
and from heartstring,
I love the lovely bully.

985
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:39,333
What is thy name?

986
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:43,069
Uh, Harry Le Roy.
Le Roy?

987
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,670
A... a Cornish name?

988
01:16:46,282 --> 01:16:47,977
No, I am a Welshman.

989
01:16:50,753 --> 01:16:53,051
Knowest thou Fluellen?
Aye.

990
01:16:53,956 --> 01:16:58,017
Tell him I'll knock his leek about
his pate upon Saint Davy's day.

991
01:16:58,894 --> 01:17:02,159
Do not wear your dagger in your cap
that day, lest he knock that about yours.

992
01:17:04,466 --> 01:17:05,626
Art thou his friend?

993
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:07,429
And his kinsman too.

994
01:17:08,637 --> 01:17:10,764
The figo with thee then.
I thank you.

995
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:12,633
God be with you.

996
01:17:13,642 --> 01:17:15,769
My name is Pistol called.

997
01:17:16,612 --> 01:17:18,580
It sorts well
with your fierceness.

998
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:27,645
Captain Fluellen.
Shh!

999
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,155
In the name of Jesus Christ,
speak lower.

1000
01:17:39,468 --> 01:17:42,733
If you would take the pains but to
examine the wars of Pompey the great,

1001
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:48,535
you shall find that there is no Tiddle
Taddle nor Pibble Babble in Pompey's camp.

1002
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:51,612
The enemy is loud.
You hear him all night.

1003
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:56,681
If the enemy is an ass and
a fool and a prating coxcomb,

1004
01:17:57,086 --> 01:17:59,247
is it meet that we should
also be an ass...

1005
01:17:59,488 --> 01:18:03,151
and a fool and a prating coxcomb
in your conscience now?

1006
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,119
[Whispers]
I will speak lower.

1007
01:18:08,163 --> 01:18:10,256
I pray you and beseech you
that you will.

01:18:42,297 --> 01:18:44,765
Is not that the morning
which breaks yonder?

1013
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:46,696
I think it be,

1014
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:50,833
but we have no great cause
to desire the approach of day.

1015
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:54,171
We see yonder
the beginning of the day,

1016
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:58,413
but I think we shall
never see the end of it.

[Twig snaps]

1018
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:05,816
Who goes there?
A friend.

1019

Under what captain serve ya?

1020
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:11,419
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

1021
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:21,069
A good old commander
and a most kind gentleman.

1022
01:19:23,105 --> 01:19:26,006
I pray ya, what thinks he
of our estate?

1023
01:19:27,276 --> 01:19:29,471
Even as men
wrecked upon a sand...

1024
01:19:30,446 --> 01:19:32,641
that look to be washed off
with the next tide.

1025
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,744
He hath not told
his thought to the king?

1026
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:38,847
No, nor it is not
meet he should.

1027
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:42,248
I think the king
is but a man as I am.

1028
01:19:43,192 --> 01:19:45,592
The violet smells to him
as it doth to me.

1029
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:48,358
His ceremonies laid by,

1030
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:50,762
in his nakedness
he appears but a man.

1031
01:19:51,867 --> 01:19:54,233
Therefore, when he sees
reason to fear, as we do,

1032
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:57,496
his fears, out of doubt,
be of the same relish as ours are.

1033
01:19:57,673 --> 01:19:59,664
He may show what
outward courage he will,

1034
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:02,500
but I believe as
cold a night as 'tis...

1035
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:05,179
that he could wish himself
in Thames up to the neck.

1036
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:09,074
[Bates] And so I would he were,
and I by him.

1037
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:12,612
At all adventures,
so we were quit here.

1038
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:16,922
I think he would not wish himself
anywhere but where he is.

1039
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:19,255
Then I would
he were here alone.

1040
01:20:22,397 --> 01:20:24,831
Methinks I could not die
anywhere so contented...

1041
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:26,828
as in the king's company,

1042
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:31,036
his cause being just
and his quarrel honorable.

1043
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:34,206
That's more than we know.

1044
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:36,205
Aye, and more than
we should seek after.

1045
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:38,840
We know enough if we know
we are the king's subject.

1046
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:42,714
If his cause be wrong,
our obedience to the king...

1047
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:44,750
wipes the crime of it
out of us.

1048
01:20:48,323 --> 01:20:49,881
But if the cause be not good,

1049
01:20:50,526 --> 01:20:53,393
the king himself hath
a heavy reckoning to make.

1050
01:20:54,763 --> 01:20:57,061
And all those legs
and arms and heads...

1051
01:20:57,232 --> 01:20:58,699
chopped off in the battle...

1052
01:20:58,934 --> 01:21:02,131
will join together at
the latter day and cry all,

1053
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:05,801
"we died at such a place."

1054
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:11,068
Some swearing,
some crying for a surgeon,

1055
01:21:12,214 --> 01:21:15,206
some upon their wives
left poor behind them,

1056
01:21:16,218 --> 01:21:17,845
some upon the debts they owe,

1057
01:21:18,787 --> 01:21:20,846
some upon their children
rawly left.

1058
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,264
I'm afeared
there are few die well...

1059
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:31,527
that die in a battle...

1060
01:21:32,134 --> 01:21:35,704
for how can they charitably
dispose of anything...

1061
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:38,138
when blood is their argument?

1062
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:43,210
Now if these men
do not die well,

1063
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:48,139
it will be a black matter for
the king that led them to it.

1064
01:21:49,818 --> 01:21:53,254
So if a son that is by his father
sent about merchandise...

1065
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:55,481
do sinfully miscarry
upon the sea,

1066
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:58,188
the imputation of
his wickedness, by your rule,

1067
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,894
should be imposed upon
the father that sent him?

1068
01:22:01,897 --> 01:22:03,262
But this is not so.

1069
01:22:03,565 --> 01:22:07,262
The king is not bound to answer the
particular endings of his soldiers...

1070
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:09,434
nor the father of his son,

1071
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:13,299
for they purpose not their deaths
when they purpose their services.

1072
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:19,278
Besides, there is no king,
be his cause never so spotless,

1073
01:22:20,082 --> 01:22:23,848
can try it out with
all unspotted soldiers.

1074
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:28,285
Every subject's duty
is the king's,

1075
01:22:29,057 --> 01:22:33,426
but every subject's soul
is his own.

1076
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:42,770
'Tis certain.

1077
01:22:43,772 --> 01:22:46,866
Eevery man that dies ill,
the ill upon his own head.

1078
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:49,801
The king is not to answer it.

1079
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:52,508
I do not desire
he should answer for me.

1080
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:55,913
Yet I determine
to fight lustily for him.

1081
01:22:57,919 --> 01:23:00,012
I myself heard the king say
he would not be ransomed.

1082
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:03,324
Aye, he said so
to make us fight cheerfully.

1083
01:23:04,293 --> 01:23:07,091
But when our throats are cut, he may
be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.

1084
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:10,862
If I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.

1085
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:12,856
You pay him then!

1086
01:23:17,005 --> 01:23:19,200
You'll never trust
his word after?

1087
01:23:20,976 --> 01:23:23,342
Come. 'tis a foolish saying.

1088
01:23:24,212 --> 01:23:25,907
Your reproof
is something too round.

1089
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:28,641
I should be angry with you
if time were convenient.

1090
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:31,082
Let it be a quarrel between us,
if you live!

1091
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:34,753
Be friends,
you English fools! Be friends!

1092
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,255
We have French quarrels enough!

1093
01:23:57,479 --> 01:23:58,707
Upon the king.

1094
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:03,851
Let us our lives,
our souls, our debts,

1095
01:24:05,187 --> 01:24:07,451
our careful wives,
our children...

1096
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:11,051
and our sins lay on the king.

1097
01:24:12,494 --> 01:24:14,257
We must bear all.

1098
01:24:15,464 --> 01:24:18,262
Oh, hard condition.

1099
01:24:19,868 --> 01:24:21,426
Twin-born with greatness,

1100
01:24:22,471 --> 01:24:24,871
subject to the breath
of every fool.

1101
01:24:26,241 --> 01:24:29,108
What infinite heart's ease
must kings neglect...

1102
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:31,072
that private men enjoy?

1103
01:24:32,514 --> 01:24:35,483
And what have kings
that privates have not too...

1104
01:24:36,485 --> 01:24:38,214
save ceremony?

1105
01:24:39,354 --> 01:24:42,187
And what art thou,
thou idle ceremony?

1106
01:24:44,259 --> 01:24:47,922
What drinks thou oft instead of
homage sweet but poison flattery?

1107
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:52,763
Oh, be sick, great greatness,
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.

1108
01:24:54,169 --> 01:24:57,104
Canst thou, when thou
commandest the beggar's knee,

1109
01:24:57,672 --> 01:24:59,333
command the health of it?

1110
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:11,248
No, thou proud dream,

1111
01:25:12,654 --> 01:25:16,556
that playest so subtly
with a king's repose.

1112
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:20,556
I am a king that find thee,

1113
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:23,487
and I know...

1114
01:25:26,635 --> 01:25:29,570
'tis not the balm,
the scepter and the ball,

1115
01:25:30,472 --> 01:25:33,441
the sword, the mace,
the crown imperial,

1116
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:37,010
the intertissued robe
of gold and pearl,

1117
01:25:37,879 --> 01:25:40,404
the farced title
running fore the king,

1118
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:43,647
the throne he sits on...

1119
01:25:44,419 --> 01:25:46,478
nor the tide of pomp...

1120
01:25:46,888 --> 01:25:49,516
that beats upon the high shore
of this world.

1121
01:25:50,392 --> 01:25:54,260
No, not all these,
thrice-gorgeous ceremony,

1122
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:58,528
not all these,
laid in bed majestical,

1123
01:25:59,234 --> 01:26:02,294
can sleep so soundly...

1124
01:26:03,472 --> 01:26:05,372
as the wretched slave,

1125
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:10,076
Who, with a body filled and
vacant mind, gets him to rest,

1126
01:26:11,213 --> 01:26:13,374
crammed with
distressful bread,

1127
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:16,381
never sees horrid night,
the child of hell,

1128
01:26:16,751 --> 01:26:18,616
but like a lackey,
from the rise to the set...

1129
01:26:18,987 --> 01:26:20,750
sweats in the eye
of Phoebus...

1130
01:26:21,389 --> 01:26:24,324
and all night sleeps...

1131
01:26:24,659 --> 01:26:26,286
in Elysium.

1132
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:30,724
Next day after dawn, doth rise
and help Hyperion to his horse...

1133
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:34,097
and follows so
the ever-running year...

1134
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:36,329
with profitable labor
to his grave.

1135
01:26:37,405 --> 01:26:41,432
And but for ceremony...

1136
01:26:43,778 --> 01:26:45,268
such a wretch,

1137
01:26:45,881 --> 01:26:47,906
winding up days of toil...

1138
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:50,577
and nights with sleep...

1139
01:26:53,154 --> 01:26:56,055
had the forehand
and vantage...

1140
01:26:59,294 --> 01:27:00,556
of a king.

1141
01:27:05,033 --> 01:27:08,093
My lord, your nobles,
jealous of your absence,

1142
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:10,363
seek through the camp
to find you.

1143
01:27:13,308 --> 01:27:14,605
Good old knight,

1144
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:17,677
Collect them all together
at my tent.

1145
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,680
I'll be before thee.

1146
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:28,550
O God of battles,
steel my soldiers' hearts.

1147
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:30,584
Possess them not with fear.

1148
01:27:30,926 --> 01:27:32,985
Take from them now
their sense of reckoning...

1149
01:27:33,228 --> 01:27:35,662
if the opposed numbers
pluck their hearts from them.

1150
01:27:36,264 --> 01:27:39,131
Not today, o God,
oh, not today.

1151
01:27:40,268 --> 01:27:43,294
Think not upon the fault my
father made encompassing the crown.

1152
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:46,069
I Richard's body
have interred new...

1153
01:27:46,241 --> 01:27:48,766
and on it have bestowed
more contrite tears...

1154
01:27:48,944 --> 01:27:51,174
than from it issued
forced drops of blood.

1155
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:54,344
Five hundred poor
I have in yearly pay...

1156
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:56,177
who twice a day
their withered hands...

1157
01:27:56,351 --> 01:27:58,546
hold up toward heaven
to pardon blood.

1158
01:27:58,787 --> 01:28:01,381
And I have built
two chantries...

1159
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:05,115
where the sad and solemn priests
sing still for Richard's soul.

1160
01:28:05,627 --> 01:28:07,356
More will I do...

1161
01:28:08,363 --> 01:28:10,957
though all that I can do...

1162
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:13,766
is nothing worth...

1163
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:17,367
since my penitence comes,
after all,

1164
01:28:18,306 --> 01:28:21,104
imploring pardon.

1165
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:26,439
[Man] My liege!
My brother Gloucester's voice.

1166
01:28:27,882 --> 01:28:29,782
I know thy errand.

1167
01:28:31,152 --> 01:28:33,120
I will go with thee.

1168
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:38,557
The day, my friends,

1169
01:28:39,995 --> 01:28:42,793
and all things...

1170
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:45,163
stay...

1171
01:28:46,735 --> 01:28:48,066
for me.

1172
01:28:59,914 --> 01:29:01,506
[Drums beating]

1173
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:12,290
Hark how our steeds
for present service neigh.

1174
01:29:13,495 --> 01:29:16,396
Mount them and make incision
in their hides...

1175
01:29:16,564 --> 01:29:19,362
that their hot blood
may spin in English eyes.

1176
01:29:20,335 --> 01:29:23,270
Do but behold
yon poor and starved band.

1177
01:29:24,172 --> 01:29:26,697
Your fair show shall
suck away their souls,

1178
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:29,306
leaving them but
the shales and husks of men.

1179
01:29:30,345 --> 01:29:32,472
There is not work enough
for all our hands.

1180
01:29:33,348 --> 01:29:35,282
Why do you stay so long,
my lords of france?

1181
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:39,712
Yon island carrions, desperate of their
bones, ill-favoredly become the morning field.

1182
01:29:40,622 --> 01:29:43,614
They have said their prayers,
and they stay for death.

1183
01:29:45,794 --> 01:29:49,321
A very little little let us do,
and all is done.

1184
01:29:50,532 --> 01:29:53,865
Then let the trumpets sound the
tucket sonance and the note to mount...

1185
01:29:54,769 --> 01:29:57,533
for our approach will
so much dare the field...

1186
01:29:58,573 --> 01:30:02,339
that England shall crouch down
in fear... and yield!

1187
01:30:08,783 --> 01:30:10,546
[Chattering]
