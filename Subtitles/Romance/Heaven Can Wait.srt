00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,877
<i>[Bell Tolling]</i>

2
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,027
- How do you do, Mr. Van Cleve?
- Good afternoon, Your Excellency.

3
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,602
- Very kind of you to receive me.
- Not at all.

4
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,603
- Oh, please. Sit down.
- Thank you.

5
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,299
I hope you'll forgive me,
but we're so busy down here.

6
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,672
Really, sometimes it looks as if
the whole world is coming to hell.

7
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:30,477
Frankly, I haven't had an opportunity
to familiarize myself with your case.

8
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,517
When did it happen, Mr. Van Cleve?

9
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,419
Tuesday. To be exact,
I died at 9:36 in the evening.

10
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,650
I trust you didn't suffer much.

11
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,817
Oh, no, no.

12
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,589
Not in the least.
I had finished my dinner—

13
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,359
- A good one, I hope.
- Oh, excellent, excellent.

14
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,834
I ate everything
the doctor forbade, and then...

15
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,236
well, to make a long story short...

16
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,901
shall we say,
I fell asleep without realizing it.

17
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,380
And when I awakened, there were
all my relatives speaking in low tones...

18
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,417
and saying nothing
but the kindest things about me.

19
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,418
Then I knew I was dead.

20
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,045
I presume your funeral
was satisfactory.

21
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:13,523
Well, there was a lot of crying, so...

22
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,924
I believe everybody had a good time.

23
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,329
It would have been an ideal funeral if
Mrs. Cooper-Cooper, a friend of the family...

24
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,596
hadn't volunteered to sing
"The End of a Perfect Day."

25
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:29,039
<i>You see, all my life I had succeeded in</i>
<i>avoiding Mrs. Cooper-Cooper's coloratura...</i>

26
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,042
and this undoubtedly
was her revenge.

27
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:36,047
Mr. Van Cleve, I can see
that you have a sensitive, cultivated ear.

28
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,707
Oh, thank you.

29
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,047
Then let me warn you.

30
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,179
The music down here
is anything but pleasant.

31
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:48,090
Beethoven, Bach, Mozart —

32
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,424
you hear them only...

33
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,955
above.

34
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,194
Yes. I know.

35
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,797
It won't be easy not to hear
the old masters again.

36
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,774
And there are several people
up there I would love to see.

37
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,973
Particularly one.

38
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,049
A very dear one.

39
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,182
- But I haven't a chance.
- Have you tried?

40
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,781
No, Your Excellency.
I have no illusions.

41
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,620
I know the life I lived.
I know where I belong.

42
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,195
I would like to get it over
as quickly as possible.

43
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,494
Very well. If you meet our requirements,
we'll be only too glad to accommodate you.

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,693
Would you be good enough
to mention, for instance...

45
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,997
some outstanding crime
you've committed?

46
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,938
Crime? Crime?

47
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,703
I'm afraid I can't think of any.

48
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,177
But I can safely say my whole life
was one continuous misdemeanor.

49
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,980
My dear Mr. Van Cleve, a passport to hell
is not issued on generalities.

50
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,543
No. I'm afraid you'll have to wait
until I have time to study your record.

51
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,886
Now look here.
I have to see His Excellency...

52
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,720
<i>and no office boy's</i>
<i>going to stop me.</i>

53
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,865
I beg your pardon, Your Excellency—

54
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,867
- Just a moment.
- I'm Edna Craig.

55
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,665
Oh, yes. I have your record here.
You'll be taken care of in just a moment.

56
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,400
I don't want to seem rude,
but I don't think I belong here.

57
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,476
- In just a moment —
- Please don't misunderstand me.

58
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,476
I think it is a charming place.
Isn't it?

59
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,550
Henry Van Cleve.

60
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,813
You know Edna Craig?

61
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,321
I'm sorry, madam.
I seem to be at a loss.

62
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,087
Oh, Henry.
Think back— many, many years.

63
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,391
The little brownstone house
around the corner from the old Waldorf?

64
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,397
Oh.

65
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,366
Marmaduke Harrison's party.

66
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,437
We were all dressed as children.

67
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,302
And you came as, uh,
Little Lord Fauntleroy.

68
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,898
And they wheeled you in
in a baby carriage.

69
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,412
Little Constantinople.

70
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,912
Oh, Henry.

71
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,544
No girl in New York walked
on two more beautiful legs than you.

72
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,645
Little Constantinople.

73
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:01,420
Well, Henry, I still walk—
and on the same two legs.

74
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,019
- [Giggles]
- And I'm sure they're still as beautiful.

75
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,589
Well, Henry, I'll let you
be the judge of that.

76
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,405
<i>[Edna Giggling]</i>

77
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,738
[Screams]

78
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,515
Those things are better left to memory.

79
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,349
But I must admit you're beginning
to interest me, Mr. Van Cleve.

80
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,358
I think I can spare the time
to listen to your story.

81
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,054
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Please sit down.

82
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,629
Perhaps the best way to tell you
the story of my life...

83
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,934
is to tell you about
the women in my life.

84
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,838
Well, let's start with
the first woman.

85
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,843
My mother.

86
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,743
<i>[Henry Narrating]</i>
<i>A lovely lady, but prejudiced.</i>

87
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,339
<i>She thought I was wonderful.</i>

88
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,351
<i>She was the first woman I ever fooled.</i>

89
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,388
<i>Then there was my grandmother.</i>

90
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,650
<i>She was just as prejudiced</i>
<i>as my mother.</i>

91
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,192
How is the little darling?
Let me hold him.

92
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,421
No. Please, Mother Van Cleve.
Let the baby rest.

93
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,693
- You're just jealous, Bertha.
- I can't stand this any longer.

94
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,360
- I'm going to speak to Randolph about this.
- Yes, Randolph.

95
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:20,838
First you take my son away,
and now you want to alienate my grandchild.

96
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,843
<i>[Henry Narrating] My diapers needed changing,</i>
<i>and already women were fighting for me.</i>

97
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,437
<i>What a way to start a man</i>
<i>on the road oflife.</i>

98
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,315
<i>I was not even two,</i>
<i>and I already got involved in a triangle.</i>

99
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,049
<i>At home, in the presence of my family,</i>
<i>I was the only man in my nurse's life.</i>

100
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,126
<i>I was her honeybunch,</i>
<i>her "oogi-woogi-woo."</i>

101
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,127
<i>But the minute we got to the park</i>—

102
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,129
Hello, Bedelia.

103
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,290
Well, if it isn't Patrick himself.

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,300
- [Giggling]
- [Bawling]

105
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,563
Ah, shut up, you nasty little brat.

106
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,306
<i>[Henry Narrating]</i>
<i>No wonder I became a cynic.</i>

107
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,473
<i>My next lesson</i>
<i>came from little Mary.</i>

108
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,209
- Hello, Mary.
- Don't speak to me, Henry Van Cleve.

109
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,414
You're a bad boy, and my mother says
I shouldn't talk to bad boys.

110
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,821
I bet you don't know
what I've got in this box.

111
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,825
And I'm not interested,
Henry Van Cleve.

112
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,986
Then I won't tell you it's a beetle.

113
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,360
A beetle?

114
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,195
- Do you like it?
- Oh, who doesn't like beetles?

115
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,701
- It's yours.
- Thank you.

116
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,704
Oh, thank you, Henry.

117
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,434
- I wonder if I should take it.
- If you don't want it —

118
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,602
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.
I was just wondering.

119
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,873
Don't worry.
I've got another one.

120
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,677
- Another beetle?
- Uh-huh.

121
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:41,150
Oh, it's beautiful.
It looks rather lonely though.

122
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,451
You know what I think?
I think it wants to be together with mine.

123
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,525
You mean you want this one too?

124
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,722
Henry Van Cleve! Do you think I'm the kind of girl
that would take a boy's last beetle?

125
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,628
Aw, that's all right.
You can have it.

126
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:58,670
Thank you, Henry. Now, if you want to,
you can walk with me to the corner.

127
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,138
<i>[Henry Narrating] From that moment on,</i>
<i>one thing was clear to me.</i>

128
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,802
<i>If you want to win a girl,</i>
<i>you have to have lots ofbeetles.</i>

129
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,009
<i>I was growing rapidly,</i>
<i>and so was New York.</i>

130
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,112
<i>Yes. New York was becoming</i>
<i>cosmopolitan...</i>

131
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,489
<i>and no household was considered fashionable</i>
<i>without a French maid.</i>

132
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:25,086
<i>So, one day a Fifth Avenue coach</i>
<i>stopped in front of our house...</i>

133
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:29,065
<i>and out of the coach</i>
<i>and into my life came Mademoiselle.</i>

134
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,267
Mrs. Van Cleve will be here shortly.

135
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,346
<i>Merci.</i>

136
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,952
That's Mr. Van Cleve.

137
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:54,049
<i>Oh, Monsieur.</i>
<i>Charmant, charmant.</i>

138
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,425
This is Mr. Van Cleve's father.
He lives here too.

139
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,296
Grandpapa.
Sweet. Very sweet.

140
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,369
And who is this darling little boy?

141
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,065
That's the young master.
He's not so darling.

142
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,438
- Bad boy?
- Not good.

143
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,602
- Good morning.
<i>- Bonjour, madame.</i>

144
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,907
How do you do, mademoiselle?

145
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,948
- Your name is, uh —
- Yvette Blanchard.

146
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,949
- Yvette Blanchard.
<i>- Oui.</i>

147
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,077
The agency tells me
that you've just arrived from France.

148
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,315
<i>- Oui.</i>
- And are seeking employment in this country.

149
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,221
<i>- Oui, madame.</i>
- Uh, you have references?

150
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,226
<i>- Oui, madame.</i>
- May I see them, please?

151
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,228
<i>Naturellement.</i>

152
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,992
<i>- Voilà.</i>
- Thank you.

153
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,629
Oh. [Chuckles]
Uh, they're in French.

154
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,765
<i>Oui, madame.</i> But believe me —
<i>toutes les références</i>— <i>excellentes.</i>

155
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,571
Here, my last employer—
Baroness Lalotte...

156
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,647
wishes me to be
such <i>grand</i> success in America...

157
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,512
that I shall never have desire
to return to France.

158
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:56,554
Ah. The French have such a...
continental way of expressing their gratitude.

159
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,319
Um, and here a <i>référence</i>
from the duc de Polignac.

160
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,827
He considers the two years
I spent in his house...

161
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,261
the two most happy years of his life.

162
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,459
Oh, it sounds just like a duke.

163
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,832
Um, what about your wages?

164
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:16,499
Uh, maybe in beginning $20 a month
would give <i>satisfaction?</i>

165
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,577
Twenty dollars a month!

166
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:24,048
You see, I've never gone higher
than $14 a month for a personal maid.

167
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,052
If I could only justify the difference.
Let me see.

168
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,453
- Oh, Mother?
- Come here, dear.

169
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,922
- Mademoiselle, this is my little boy.
<i>- Bonjour, mon petit.</i>

170
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,963
- Hello.
- He studies French.

171
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:43,024
Oh, mademoiselle, you must ask him
something in French. But not too difficult.

172
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,502
<i>Oui. Avez-vous bien travaillé</i>
<i>aujourd'hui, mon chéri?</i>

173
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,664
Huh?

174
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,674
That's what I was afraid of.

175
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,439
Now be a nice boy and go. I have an idea
that I want to discuss with Mademoiselle.

176
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:03,844
[Laughs] A brilliant child,
but a little backward in his French.

177
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,220
- And it just occurred to me that —
- Oh, madame.

178
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,522
It will be pleasure talk only French
to little fellow.

179
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,654
My whole <i>vocabulaire</i>
I make present to your baby.

180
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,792
With me in house, in one month I assure
Madame will not recognize own son.

181
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,302
And only for $20.

182
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,533
Of course, that's six dollars more
than I ever paid before.

183
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,235
- But let's try it.
<i>- Merci, madame.</i>

184
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,437
- Au revoir, madame.
<i>- Good-bye, mademoiselle.</i>

185
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,173
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

186
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,713
<i>Psst.! Hey.</i>

187
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,524
<i>Oui?</i>

188
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,789
You're not gonna work here.
I'll see to that.

189
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,264
What is the matter?
Did I make little boy angry?

190
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,564
Now see here. That's the last time
anybody's gonna call me "little boy."

191
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,571
Oh, so sorry if I hurt feelings,
but <i>maman</i>—

192
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,573
Yes. Mama.
That's the trouble.

193
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,337
Mama and Papa.
And Grandpapa and Grandmama.

194
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,572
It's a conspiracy
to keep me in short pants.

195
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,671
They think they own me,
body and soul.

196
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,719
<i>Ah, je comprends.</i> My understanding
for young man is perfect.

197
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,311
Your soul is bigger than your pants.

198
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,789
Oh, you need very warm friend
with sympathy.

199
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,191
<i>Moi.</i> I will be<i>. Oui?</i>

200
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,402
I bet you couldn't guess in a million years
what I have in my pocket.

201
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,405
No, I do not know, but I am sure it is
something very bad, <i>oui?</i>

202
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,644
- Here.
- Oh, you smoke big black cigar?

203
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,738
Sure, I'm gonna smoke it —
any day now.

204
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,808
Now we have
very bad secret together, <i>oui?</i>

205
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,081
That's nothing.

206
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,420
I can tell you things that would rock
Fifth Avenue to its foundations.

207
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,493
Oh?

208
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,002
- I'm going to get married.
- You, married?

209
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,436
Mmm.
I have to, darn it.

210
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,804
Oh, this is much worse than cigar.

211
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,809
When did disaster take place?

212
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,277
Oh, it all happened pretty suddenly.

213
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,848
There's a girl around the corner.
Well, you know.

214
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,714
But I do not know.
Tell me.

215
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,549
Well, we were walking in the park,
and it started to rain.

216
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,488
<i>- Oui?</i>
- We climbed into a policeman's shed.

217
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,254
- And the policeman?
- He wasn't there.

218
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,524
Well, anyhow,
before I knew it, I lost my head.

219
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,565
I don't know what got into me.

220
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,760
- I took her into my arms and then —
- And then?

221
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,498
I kissed her.

222
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,597
I may just as well
face the consequences.

223
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,867
Excuse my asking question.

224
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,845
This might sound very childish
to grown-up young man...

225
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:45,144
but did you ever consider idea
not marrying girl?

226
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,776
It's out of the question.
It would destroy me socially.

227
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,186
I could never go to Harvard.
Why, when my father kissed my mother...

228
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,225
she knew what he meant,
and he knew she knew it.

229
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,658
<i>Écoute, mon chéri.</i>

230
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,493
In your papa's time,
papa kiss mama and then marry.

231
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,533
But this is 1887.

232
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:07,572
Time of bicycle. The typewriter has <i>arrivé.</i>
Soon everybody speak over the telephone.

233
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,904
And people have
new idea of value of kiss.

234
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,411
What was bad yesterday
is lot of fun today.

235
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,845
There is a wonderful saying in France.

236
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,213
<i>"Les baisers sont comme des bonbons...</i>

237
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,219
<i>qu'on mange parce qu'ils sont bons. "</i>

238
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,949
This mean kiss is like candy.

239
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,855
You eat candy
only for the beautiful taste...

240
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,690
and this is enough reason
to eat candy.

241
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,526
Y-You mean I can kiss a girl once —

242
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,159
Ten times, 20 times.
And no <i>obligation.</i>

243
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,261
Listen, are you telling me the truth
or just trying to keep your job?

244
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,671
I'll swear by the extra six dollar
I get from Madame.

245
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,404
Gosh. This is a wonderful age
I'm living in.

246
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,072
<i>Oui.</i> So you do not
have to worry about little girl.

247
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,308
Oh, I've forgotten about her already.

248
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,181
I guess I'm pretty blasé.

249
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,413
- Listen, Frenchy.
- What is it, my friend?

250
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,854
If that's the way things are in 1887...

251
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,858
what do you think's gonna
happen in 1888?

252
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,056
Aha. We make that the subject
of our first French lesson.

253
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,132
<i>Au revoir, monsieur.</i>

254
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,045
- Mother.
- Yes, my baby.

255
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,618
That girl is worth the extra six dollars.

256
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,220
<i>[Henry Narrating] The pride</i>
<i>of all the Van Cleves was my cousin Albert.</i>

257
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,161
<i>He was the fulfillment of a parent's dream.</i>

258
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:44,201
<i>Always the highest in his class.</i>
<i>Never had he thrown a stone into a window.</i>

259
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,067
<i>Nor did he ever put a mouse</i>
<i>in his teacher's bustle.</i>

260
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,299
<i>His ears were always clean.</i>

261
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,071
<i>This, I think, will give you</i>
<i>a rough idea of Albert.</i>

262
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,170
<i>And I'll never forget</i>
<i>the morning of my 15th birthday.</i>

263
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,715
<i>The presents were waiting for me</i>
<i>in the living room.</i>

264
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,378
<i>But suddenly Father came running</i>
<i>down the stairs, excited and breathless.</i>

265
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,388
Flogdell! Flogdell!

266
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,981
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.

267
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,424
Tell Robinson to go immediately
and get Dr. Macintosh.

268
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,019
- Tell him our little Henry is ill.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

269
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,622
Oh, my poor baby.

270
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:18,760
The boy's acting so strangely, Randolph.
Randolph.

271
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,601
Now, Bertha, Bertha.
We must keep a stiff upper lip.

272
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,609
Randolph, he's talking all the time
as if he were in a delirium.

273
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,169
- What does the boy seem to be saying?
- Well, if I only knew, Randolph.

274
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,749
- He's talking French. Nothing but French.
- French?

275
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,946
Oh, Randolph.
Our boy, delirious in a foreign language.

276
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,580
- [Sobbing]
- Now, Bertha, Bertha. This is an emergency.

277
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,319
We must do everything step-by-step.
The next move is to find out what the boy is saying.

278
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,328
Uh — Uh, Flogdell.

279
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,126
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Tell Mademoiselle to come to</i>
<i>Master Henry's room immediately.</i>

280
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,132
Very good, sir.

281
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:04,273
If only Grandpa would let me rub
just a bit of garlic on his little chest.

282
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,284
Stay away from that boy with your garlic.
The boy's sick enough.

283
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,581
[Hiccups]

284
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,179
Randolph, did you hear that?
Did you hear that, Grandpa?

285
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,952
I'm not deaf.

286
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,323
The child's poisoned.
That's what it is.

287
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,896
Oh, Randolph. What shall we do?
Oh, what shall we do?

288
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,194
Now, now. There's only one thing
to do, Bertha — keep a stiff upper lip.

289
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,292
But that won't help
that poor poisoned boy.

290
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,963
If I had my way,
I know what I'd do.

291
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:31,509
A big glass of cold water right in that boy's face,
and I think he'd start talking English.

292
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,976
- Hugo, you barbarian.
- Oh, no! Please, please!

293
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,842
<i>- You'll give him pneumonia.</i>
<i>- You mustn't do that.</i>

294
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,848
- Please, you mustn't —
- He might —

295
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,145
- [Together] Oh, Mademoiselle.
<i>- Did Madame send for me?</i>

296
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,186
Yes, Mademoiselle.
Our little Henry.

297
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,687
- He's sick?
- Yes, Mademoiselle.

298
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,725
Oh. Excuse, Madame.
I'll be right back.

299
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,189
[Hiccups]

300
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,306
<i>- Oui, Madame?</i>
- Mademoiselle, he's asking for
something in French.

301
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,273
- You must help us find out what he wants.
<i>- Oui, Madame.</i>

302
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,611
- Look. He's smiling.
- He's far, far away.

303
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,913
- Why, he seems to be in another world.
- He's looking at Mademoiselle.

304
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,386
- I wonder what he sees.
- Yes. I wonder.

305
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,687
<i>Oh, je suis si malade.</i>

306
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,320
<i>Mon estomac me fait si mal.</i>

307
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,456
- Is he clear?
- Does it make any sense?

308
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,001
Oh, his French is absolutely perfect.

309
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,003
Such beautiful grammar.

310
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,768
Mademoiselle, at the moment we're not concerned
with the young man's linguistic accomplishments.

311
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,811
- Don't be harsh.
- I'm sorry if I seem to have lost my temper,
but the occasion is a trying one.

312
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,781
- If you could tell us what the child is saying,
it might help us to meet the situation.
- [Hiccups]

313
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,552
[Hiccups]

314
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,714
Must be contagious disease.

315
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,020
Son, step out with me a moment.

316
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,062
- Good morning!
- Morning, Albert.

317
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,063
<i>- [Bertha] Shh.! Hush.</i>
- What's going on?

318
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,999
Now, Son, you still don't know
what's the matter with that boy?

319
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,231
Father, I wouldn't presume
to make a diagnosis.

320
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,332
- After all, I'm not a man of medicine.
- Randolph, how old are you?

321
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,775
What an odd question, Father.
I'm 43.

322
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,440
Well, I think you are definitely old enough
to be told the facts of life.

323
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,883
- What are you driving at, Father?
- Now, Son, don't look at me
with those big wandering eyes.

324
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,047
It breaks my heart, but I'll have to shatter
your childhood illusions.

325
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,887
Randolph, my son,
there is no Santy Claus.

326
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,927
And that child of your—

327
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,656
Listen, don't you really know
what's the matter with him?

328
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,857
- You get out of here!
- Bertha, what is it?

329
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,333
- Randolph, call the police at once.
- Yes. Call the police.

330
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,370
Quiet! Quiet!
We don't need the police.

331
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,032
Bertha, Mother. I wish someone would take
the time to explain to me what this is all about.

332
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,609
Believe me, Monsieur,
the excitement is greatly <i>exagéré.</i>

333
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,611
- How dare you speak.
- Have you no shame?

334
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,739
- Oh, please, Grandpapa.
- Don't you call him Grandpapa!

335
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,374
- Don't you dare call him Grandpapa!
- Girls, girls — Shut up!

336
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,476
Go ahead.
Call me Grandpapa.

337
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,454
<i>Merci, Monsieur. Merci beaucoup, Monsieur.</i>
You are very kind.

338
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,526
Yes, I'm very kind, but you'd better go
and pack your things now.

339
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:05,723
And if you're not out of the house
in a very little while, I'll come down
to your room and help you pack.

340
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,731
I wish you would, Grandpapa.

341
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,131
- Oh, shameless, shameless!
- Leave this house! Go!

342
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:15,537
There is old French saying: If you are
thrown out of house, you better resign.

343
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,542
<i>Au revoir.</i>
[Hiccups]

344
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,705
I still would appreciate it if someone would tell me
what all this has to do with our little Henry.

345
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,045
Fortunately, Uncle Randolph,
French always being one of my favorite subjects...

346
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,917
I was able to understand the incredible
conversation between Henry and Mademoiselle.

347
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,547
- I, uh, don't know how to begin.
- All right, all right.

348
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,626
Henry had a glass of wine.
We all know that.

349
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,626
Henry? Intoxicated?

350
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,788
From what I overheard,
at or about 10:00 last night...

351
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:43,356
Henry and this — this foreign young woman
slipped out of the house.

352
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,529
Before doing this, however, Henry wrongfully
took possession of his father's dress clothes...

353
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,473
including $20 which Uncle Randolph was
negligent enough to leave in his pocket.

354
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,476
Imagine. They went to Delmonico's.

355
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,172
- Did they have a good time?
- They drank champagne.

356
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,249
Our little baby drank champagne.

357
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,750
- Well, thank you, Albert.
<i>- But that's not all, Grandfather.</i>

358
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,310
It seems, from what I could gather,
that Mrs. Asterbrook, of the Asterbrooks...

359
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,323
who was sitting at an adjoining table...

360
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,758
resented bitterly the idea of Henry
dropping a nickel into her décolletage...

361
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:14,389
and complaining to the management because
no chocolate bar dropped out of Mrs. Asterbrook.

362
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,729
Mrs. Asterbrook?
How can I ever face her?

363
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,735
What a disgrace!

364
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,032
[Randolph]
I'm going to teach that boy a lesson.

365
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,302
Yes, that's what he deserves —
throwing nickels around like that.

366
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,277
Knowing the Asterbrooks, I can tell you
right now we'll never see that nickel again.

367
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,679
I have reached my decision.
That boy is going to be spanked — and severely.

368
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,149
Oh, Randolph, don't hurt him.
Please don't hurt him.

369
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,278
- No, no, Randolph.
- Please, please. He's such a baby.

370
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:41,689
- Well, I assume there will be
no further birthday celebration.
- I'm afraid not.

371
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:45,194
I believe I can utilize this time very beneficially,
so I'll say good-bye.

372
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,994
Good-bye, Albert.
You're a real credit to the family.

373
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,069
Thank you, Grandfather.

374
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,994
<i>[Henry Narrating] It was a Sunday morning,</i>
<i>the day of my 26th birthday.</i>

375
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,266
Oh, that boy.

376
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,307
Well, at least poor Grandmother— may her soul
rest in peace —was spared seeing a day like this.

377
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,742
Oh, Randolph. Randolph, where can he be?
Where can he be?

378
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,336
Now, now, Bertha.
I'd like to give you some consolation...

379
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,348
but all I can say is chins up.

380
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,680
Oh, Randolph,
where does he get it from?

381
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,619
I give up, Bertha.
I never gambled in all my life.

382
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,190
I never got entangled
with any girl until I met you.

383
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,317
- Randolph, you call it entangled?
- I mean you entangled my heart.

384
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,760
Oh, of course, Randolph.
We entangled each other's heart.

385
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,560
Believe me, Bertha, I never knew
what a musical comedy girl looked like.

386
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,726
What can he possibly derive
from their company?

387
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,770
To me, they were creatures
from another planet.

388
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,704
Where does he get it from?
Nobody in our family was musical.

389
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,107
To this day I wouldn't know
how to find the stage entrance to a theater.

390
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,203
It's always around in the back
up an alleyway.

391
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,772
There's a sign over the door:
"Stage Entrance." You can't miss it.

392
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,784
But I'm not interested, Father.
I never was.

393
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,480
Where does the boy get it from?
Where does he get it from?

394
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,320
Father built up the Van Cleve
Importing Company from nothing.
When he stopped, I carried on.

395
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,987
Dad, you must admit, from the day I left Harvard,
I earned every dollar I ever spent.

396
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,587
Then why do you give him money
without making him work for it?

397
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:31,157
I have to save the family name. What about you
handing him hundreds of dollars?

398
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,136
- If I'd come to you for money,
would you have given it to me?
- No.

399
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,173
But you give it to him.
Why? Why? Why?

400
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,174
Because I like him.

401
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,744
Does that mean, by any chance, Father,
that you don't like me?

402
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:44,304
Son, I love you.
Now shut up and leave me alone.

403
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,316
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

404
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,386
Good morning.

405
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,883
- Good morning, Aunt Bertha.
- Good morning, Albert.

406
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,891
- Good morning, Grandfather.
- Morning, Albert.

407
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,154
- Good morning, Uncle Randolph.
- Good morning, Albert.

408
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,595
I just came in to bring a little
birthday remembrance for Henry.

409
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,599
Anything wrong?
Isn't he home?

410
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,862
[Chuckles]
11:00 Sunday morning.

411
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,438
If I know my cousin Henry,
he's probably still in church.

412
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,373
I mean that humorously.

413
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:14,002
Albert, I'm struggling successfully
against the gout...

414
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,811
I'm waging a terrific battle with my liver,
and I'm holding my own against asthma...

415
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,045
but I doubt if I have strength enough
to survive your jokes.

416
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,644
You're a successful lawyer.
Let it go at that.

417
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,724
I love you, Albert.

418
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,690
Uh, it was sweet of you
to drop in, Albert.

419
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,787
I hope he'll be here tonight
to thank you.

420
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,697
I hope so too, otherwise I'd be
in the most embarrassing position...

421
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,701
as far as my future
in-laws are concerned.

422
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,636
We're so eager to meet your fiancée.
How does she like New York?

423
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,640
Yes. Is she enjoying herself?

424
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:47,007
Well, she's only been here two days,
so naturally the impression is overwhelming.

425
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,980
I took her to the aquarium. We rode up and down
the elevator in the Flatiron Building...

426
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,050
and naturally,
we ended up in Grant's Tomb.

427
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,085
Naturally.

428
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,086
Uh, and her parents?

429
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,214
Oh, yes. How does the big
Kansas City butcher like New York?

430
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,021
- Now, Father, please.
- I assume that you're referring to...

431
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,791
my future father-in-law, who happens to be
one of the great meat-packers of our time.

432
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,732
Yes, Father Van Cleve. Don't you realize
that every piece of beef we eat...

433
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,395
comes from one of
Mr. Strable's many, many plants?

434
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,531
Does that include the steak
I fought 10 rounds with last night?

435
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,804
Grandfather, you don't seem to have any idea
of the importance of Mr. Strable.

436
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,472
He created the most famous character
in American advertising — Mabel, the cow.

437
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,482
You've seen her, Father,
on billboards.

438
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,018
That big, happy cow
smiling at you over the fence...

439
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,587
and saying in big letters, um, uh —
How does it go?

440
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,817
"To the world my name is Mabel,
which you'll find on every label.

441
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,758
I am packed by E.F. Strable,
for the pleasure of your table."

442
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,297
No cow in its right mind
could have said anything like that.

443
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,765
- Sounds more like Mr. Strable.
- Grandfather, please, I beg of you.

444
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,429
The family understands your humor,
but it's a typical kind of New York humor.

445
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,269
- In other words, it's not for yokels, huh?

will you tell him that as a Van Cleve...

- Good, Randolph. What happened?

00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,925
He asked for a hundred dollars, but I told him.
I told him I'd let him have only 50.

- Randolph —
- And not right away.

For the first time in 27 years of marriage,
I feel like criticizing you.

What do you want me to do?
Spank a 26-year-old boy?

462
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,635
No, but at least I expected
a verbal lashing.

463
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,522
- Are you all right, my boy?
- Yes, Mother.

464

Many happy returns of the day. Ohh.

Mother, I'm sorry
if I made you unhappy.

00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,137
Oh, Grandfather and Father and I
are worried to death about you.

You don't give your family
a single thought.

All you think about
is having what you call a good time.

469

Mother, I went out last night
to raise Cain.

470
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,577
- Son, you mustn't talk like that.
- Don't worry. I didn't.

00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,586
I couldn't.

when you saw Father for the first time,
did you feel that unmistakable something?

00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,032
Did you feel an electric spark
from your head right down to your toes...

477
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,729
that swept over you like a hurricane
and threw you to the ground...

478
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,829
but you bounced up again
and floated over the treetops?

479
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,965
Spark? A hurricane?

480
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,704
Heaven forbid.
I never had such a feeling.

481
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,871
Henry, where do you get it from?

482
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,508
Not from me. And certainly
your father never had any spark.

483
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,916
Mother, all I'm trying to say is...

484
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,988
I met a girl yesterday.

485
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,717
Oh. I hope she comes from
a good family.

486
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:24,056
I don't know.
And frankly, I don't care.

487
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,562
Mother, when one sees a lovely rose —

488
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,189
One can be certain
she comes from a fine rosebush.

489
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,964
Mother, even if this girl's father turned out to be
something of a buttercup, I wouldn't care.

490
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,098
What's her name?
Where does she live?

491
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,199
I wish I knew.

492
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,870
She isn't one of
those musical comedy girls?

493
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,916
Oh, no, Mother.
It's an entirely different kind of music.

494
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:49,248
It's not the hootchy-kootchy.
It's not the cancan.

495
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,289
It's like a waltz by Strauss.

496
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,449
Like a minuet by Mozart.

497
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,720
Henry, where do you get it from?

498
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,163
From you, Mother.

499
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,165
Now, you must be just.

500
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,100
When I was a little boy,
you wanted me to believe in fairy tales...

501
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,137
and now that one
has really happened —

502
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,138
You remember that story
about the young man —

503
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,572
I think he was a shepherd
who was walking in the woods —

504
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,610
Oh, you've been in the country.

505
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:16,145
No, no, Mother.
It happened right on Broadway.

506
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,408
Suddenly the young man
saw a big castle...

507
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,144
and leaning out of the window
was the most beautiful princess.

508
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,016
Nothing could stop him.
He climbed up the parapet of the castle —

509
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,489
Henry. You haven't broken into
the Waldorf again?

510
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,755
Mother, darling,
let's forget the fairy tale.

511
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,762
Well, it's about time you grew up.

512
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,128
I came here to scold you,
and I'm going to do it.

513
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,133
Now, look at your cousin Albert.

514
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,965
Not much older than you are
and already a corporation lawyer...

515
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,699
engaged to a lovely girl
of a well-known family.

516
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:47,574
Henry, now, this may sound severe, but you've
got to pull yourself together and settle down.

517
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,116
Mother, I don't think I'll ever find this girl,
but if I did, then all your troubles would be over.

518
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,879
If she didn't want me to gamble,
I wouldn't look at another card.

519
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,888
I'd stay home every night.
Mother, I might even go to work.

520
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,016
Henry, that's wonderful.

521
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,026
I don't know about the girl...

522
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,461
but the fact that you have the desire
to settle down makes me so happy.

523
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,363
For the first time
you're beginning to sound like your father.

524
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:14,599
Uh, Mother, I don't know where
this girl is, so don't expect too much.

525
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,732
Oh, now listen to your mother.
Don't worry about that girl.

526
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,776
Another girl will come along.

527
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,904
- I'll look for one myself. How's that?
- Fine. Fine, Mother.

528
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,744
And when I find a girl for you,
she'll be Miss Right.

529
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,251
And do you know where we'll find her?
In the home of Mr. And Mrs. Right.

530
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,846
Oh, Henry,
you're making me so happy.

531
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,916
Mother, I was riding around for hours and hours
trying to forget this girl.

532
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,928
Oh, child, don't worry.

533
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,930
Well, it was very expensive.

534
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,932
The cab is still waiting out in front...

535
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,594
and the driver was so nice to me
that I promised him, if—

536
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:49,730
I know. Your heart's always bigger
than your father's pocketbook.

537
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,744
Look under your pillow.
I put something there last night.

538
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,819
Oh, Mother.

539
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,619
Sometimes I wonder
if you're not spoiling me.

- Here, dear.
- Oh, thank you.

543
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,466
Well, this is a great occasion.
You must be proud of your Albert.

544
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,559
- Yes, I think we have a pretty good son.
- Oh.

545
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,072
- I hear the Strable family—
- We couldn't ask anything better for our Albert.

546
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:28,111
- Oh, wonderful.
- Mr. And Mrs. Strable and Miss Strable.

00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:40,784
Good evening, Grandfather, Aunt Bertha,
Uncle Randolph, dear, dear family.

549
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,453
It is my privilege and honor
to present Mr. And Mrs. E.F. Strable.

- How do you do, madam?
<i>- How do you do?</i>

554
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,879
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward
to the pleasure of meeting you.

555
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,009
All my life I've wanted to see
the wide-open spaces.

556
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,816
Well, if Muhammad can't go to the mountain,
the mountain must come to Muhammad.

557
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,857
You're welcome, Mrs. Strable.

558
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,893
- Yes, we're pretty proud of Kansas.
- Naturally.

559
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,429
And you, Mr. Strable,
welcome to our family.

560
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,397
Mr. Van Cleve, we people
from the West don't talk much...

561
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,400
but when we say something,
we mean it.

562
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,027
- Thank you.
- Thank you for giving me the chance...

563
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,106
to meet the man who feeds the nation.

564
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,040
I hope this will be the beginning
of a lifelong friendship.

00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:36,546
May you lie as solidly anchored
in our hearts as you do in our stomachs.

And, uh, Grandfather,
this is Martha.

So, this is Martha, huh?

Well, Martha.

- Yes, Mr. Van Cleve?
- Grandpa.

- Yes, Grandpa.
- If I were about 50 years younger...

I'd take you right away from that s —

splendid young man

573
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,899
and who is going to make you
a wonderful husband.

- Yes, sir.

- Flogdell, is that —
- That's Mr. Strable.

578
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,426
And that spreading chestnut tree
under which Grandfather is standing?

That's Mrs. Strable.

And, uh, where's the lucky girl?

She's just turning round.

Charming young lady,
if I may say so.

584
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,679
Flogdell, I don't think
I can stand this party.

585
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,684
- Get my hat and coat.
- But, sir.

586
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,754

<i>- Thank you.</i>

- Where are you going?
- Out.

590
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,729
I beg you to stay and behave
like a Van Cleve just once.

The Strables know it's your birthday, and they
want to congratulate you. Oh, Martha. Martha.

- Yes, Albert?
- Dearest, I want you to meet Henry Van Cleve.

This is the cousin whose birthday
we're celebrating today.

- Cousin Henry.
- Cousin Henry.

- Thank you, Cousin Martha.
- Well, here she is, Henry.

597

Now I've done my duty bringing some
new blood into the family. It'll be your turn next.

598

- That's most unlikely.
- Oh, nonsense.

599

is to meet the right girl.

600
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,560
That's difficult, Albert.
I'm afraid I'll never have your luck.

Yes. No question about it. I'm lucky.

Don't be afraid.

I should have told him.
It would have been the thing to do.

It shall remain our secret.

00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,701
Hmm.

638
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,574
There you are.

639
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:13,556
I probably should apologize.
I imagine I should have called you madam.

640
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,558
No, it's still miss.

641
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,821
- But not for long, I presume.
- That's quite right.

642
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,828
- How much is the book?
- Oh.

643
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,264
We'll be only too glad to charge it if you would be
kind enough to give me your name and address.

644
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,302
Thank you, but I'd rather pay.
How much?

645
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:29,737
- Uh, it's very expensive.
- Oh, that's all right.

646
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,365
Now, this is against the interests
of Mr. Brentano...

647
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,910
but since I am, so to speak,
your literary confessor...

648
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,912
I must be honest with you.

649
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,914
Don't buy this book.
You don't need it.

650
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,177
I'll tell you something
much more appropriate for you.

651
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,185
Leave your nest
and fly away with me.

652
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,312
Well, I might buy that book too —

653
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,448
Well, we don't have it
in stock right now...

654
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,493
but I'd love to discuss the idea with you,
and if you like it —

655
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,927
I'm afraid I haven't much time.
So, please, will you tell me?

656
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:57,125
How much is
<i>How to Make Your Husband Happy?</i>

657
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:00,260
Look at her. Dr. Blossom Franklin.

658
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,832
<i>Now where could a woman like that</i>
<i>have found out how to make a husband happy?</i>

659
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,433
You certainly don't want to
learn anything from her.

660
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,775
You're so charming, so young
and so beautiful.

661
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,905
I beg your pardon.
You shouldn't say such things.

662
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,246
You see, miss, when selling literature,
one gets poetic.

663
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,287
And you must forgive me
if I take poetic license once in a while.

664
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:21,085
I'd rather not discuss it any further,
and if you don't mind, I'd like to buy this book.

665
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,854
I do mind. Now, imagine
I'm the man you're going to marry.

666
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,861
I couldn't imagine any such thing.

667
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,591
Well, what's the matter with me?
You think I'm that terrible?

668
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,759
Please. I just came in here to buy a book.
That's all.

669
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,999
I understand. But for the sake of discussion,
let's say <i>we</i> are getting married.

670
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,406
Believe me. I don't want anybody
to tell you how to make me happy.

671
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,173
The greatest gift you could bring me
is to be just as you are — adorable.

672
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,407
- All I want is a book.
- Stubborn, eh?

673
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,780
- What?
- Pardon my poetic license.

674
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,252
If you don't change your attitude,
I shall have to complain to your employer.

675
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,687
I'm not employed here.
I'm not a book salesman.

676
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,157
I took one look at you
and followed you into the store.

677
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,490
If you'd walked into a restaurant,
I would have become a waiter.

678
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,156
If you'd walked into a burning building,
I would have become a fireman.

679
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:05,725
If you'd walked into an elevator,
I would have stopped it between two floors,
and we'd have spent the rest of our lives there.

680
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,467
Please forgive me,
but you can't walk out of my life like that.

681
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,545
I think your behavior's outrageous.
It's mad.

682
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,012
- I must insist that you leave me at once.
- Never. Never.

683
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,846
Is this man annoying you, miss?
If he is, just say so. I'll take care of him.

684
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,614
Am I annoying you?
Tell the officer.

685
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:28,783
No. The gentlemen was just
saying good-bye.

686
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,418
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

687
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,892
<i>[Henry Narrating]</i>
<i>This was our terrible secret.</i>

688
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,469
<i>##[Woman Singing Aria]</i>

689
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,009
I'm terribly sorry, Albert.

690
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,079
Dearest, you don't
seem to realize who's singing.

691
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,080
I know. Young Mrs. Cooper-Cooper.

692
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,810
If it were just a relative,
it wouldn't be half so embarrassing.

693
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,115
But Mr. Cooper-Cooper is one of
your most important clients. I haven't forgotten.

694
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,246
But what could I do?
I had to sneeze.

695
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:02,792
But you did it right in the middle of her aria —
and five times.

696
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,054
Because I had to sneeze five times.

697
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,756
Albert, suppose someday in the future
I had to sneeze —

698
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,890
Then you sneeze.
Naturally.

699
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,231
Don't you worry. After all,
I'm taking you for better or for worse.

700
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,305
Do you think
you may have to sneeze again?

701
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:19,035
- I don't know. I can't guarantee it.
- Well, then let's not take any chances.

702
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,510
Why don't you go in the library
and rest a while and see how things develop?

703
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,513
Make yourself comfortable.
Read a book.

704
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,845
[Whispers]
I think I'd better go back for the encore.

705
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,181
- Yes, dear.

<i>##[Continues]</i>

710
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,690
- Cousin Henry.
- Yes, Cousin Martha?

711
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,851
You must never do anything
like that again.

712
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,054
Is that what you came back here
to tell me?

713
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,654
I think it's outrageous.
I hardly know you.

714
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,927
Why, even Albert,
my own fiancé, never dared to —

715
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,902
- Kiss you?
- Of course he kissed me. Why not?

716
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,972
After all, we're engaged.

717
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,769
- But he never kissed me like that.
- Like what?

718
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,474
Oh, I hate you.
I hate you.

719
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,750
I don't even know why
I stay in the same room with you.

720
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,886
Please forgive me,
but can't we be friends?

721
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,355
- Just friends?
- Never.

722
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:18,417
Now, look, we're gonna be related, aren't we?
And we're gonna see each other.

723
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,622
- How can we help it?
- I suppose we can't.

724
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:24,963
And if we meet in the future we don't have to
talk about personal things — about you and me.

725
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,969
Let's talk about something neutral.

726
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,096
- For instance, Albert.
- Why not?

727
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:32,107
By the way, do you love Albert?

728
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,109
I'm marrying him, am I not?

729
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,145
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

730
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,181
No, you're not. You can't.
You haven't got the book.

731
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,444
- What book?
<i>- How to Make Your Husband Happy.</i>

732
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,487
Well, it might interest you to know
that I went back and bought it.

733
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,386
Does it tell you how to
make a man happy whom you don't love?

734
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,391
Now, look here, Cousin Henry.

735
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,394
Albert's a fine man.
Yes, he is.

736
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,624
He's good, and — and he has integrity.

737
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,566
- And he's full of high ideals.
- Do you love him?

738
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:02,366
Well, I'm gonna make him a very fine wife.
At least I'm gonna try my best.

739
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,375
There'll never be a moment in his whole life
when he'll ever regret having married me.

740
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:10,937
And if you ask me one more question, I'm gonna
leave this room, and I'll never come back again.

741
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,516
Never!
[Sobbing]

742
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,514
I still can't understand it.

743
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:24,082
An angel like you and Albert.
It — It doesn't make sense.

744
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:28,631
- Why do you want to marry him?
- [Sobbing]

745
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,667
Well, you see,
I always wanted to live in New York.

746
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,760
I don't want to say
anything against Kansas...

747
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,499
but life on my father's estate —

748
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:40,441
Don't misunderstand me. We have all
the modern conveniences and luxuries, but —

749
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,671
Oh, and you don't know
Father and Mother.

750
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,714
Well, I've — I've only just met them.

751
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,182
- Don't you think they're sweet?
- Well, yes. Very sweet.

752
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:51,948
Yes, they are. But it's not very easy
to live with them.

753
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,991
You see, most of the time
they don't talk to one another.

754
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,856
And whenever a young man —
and there were some very nice ones —

755
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,861
Oh, I'm sure of it.

756
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:04,297
If one of them asked for my hand
and my mother said yes, my father said no.

757
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,598
And when my father said yes,
my mother said no.

758
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:12,165
But Albert came at one of those rare moments
when they were both on speaking terms.

759
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,335
And if I hadn't said yes...

760
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:18,381
who knows when my parents might have been
talking to each other again?

761
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:22,213
I might have spent
the rest of my life in Kansas.

762
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,914
Don't misunderstand me.
I love Kansas.

763
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,389
It's just that
I don't feel like living there.

764
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,485
Besides that...

765
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,325
I didn't want to be an old maid.

766
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,991
Not in Kansas.
[Sobbing]

767
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:44,065
Well, you're going to live right here in New York,
and you don't have to marry Albert.

768
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:48,110
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do. You're gonna get married,
but not to Albert.

769
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,840
And yet you won't even have to
change the initials on your linen.

770
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:53,109
- You're going to marry me.
- Oh, we can't do that.

771
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,583
How can I marry you?
I'm not even engaged to you.

772
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,586
- Martha, do you love me?
- I hardly know you.

773
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:01,021
You don't need to know anything when you love.
Love needs no introduction.
You love or you don't.

774
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,720
- You don't know what you're saying.
You must be out of your mind.
- Do you love me or don't you?

775
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,695
Trying to take away the fiancée of
your own cousin, causing a family scandal.

776
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,096
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

777
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,305
Oh.

778
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,396
Oh, why did you ever come into my life?

779
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,238
To make you happy.
To hold you in my arms forever.

780
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,471
I'll never be able to
look my father in the face.

781
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,776
- I'll never be able to go back to Kansas again.
- Isn't that wonderful?

782
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,654
Oh, I wish I were dead.

783
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:34,724
Look, let's get away. Let's get married immediately.
Right away. Tonight.

784
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,725
- You mean elope?
- That's what I mean.

785
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:40,263
But where would we go? Oh, I never did
such a thing before. I feel so helpless.

786
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,559
I haven't got a thing with me.
Oh, I wish I were dead.

787
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,157
When Romeo and Juliet ran away,
they didn't stop to say good-bye.

788
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:48,432
When Leander swam the Hellespont to his
beloved, he didn't bother to take a suitcase.

789
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,770
When Tristan falls in love with Isolde,
they have to sing for three and a half hours.

790
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:56,676
All I'm asking you to do is hop into a cab
and drive to the first justice of the peace.

- [All Chattering Excitedly]
- Was that Henry and Martha?

795
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,822
- What happened?
- They left in a cab. They're going to get married.

796
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,699
- Married?
- Married? Married?

797
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,771
Oh, Randolph,
where does he get it from?

798
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:24,534
Now, now, Bertha.
Keep a stiff upper lip.

799
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:27,735
Sir, I am still too dazed
to express myself clearly...

800
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,939
but I assure you that the sentiments
of our family are with you.

801
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:35,007
If this happened at home, my husband
would jump on a horse and lasso them back.

802
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,086
Don't you tell me what I would do.

803
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,020
But there's one thing I am going to do —
disinherit her.

804
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,114
She'll never see another nickel of mine.

805
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,593
- We came here from Kansas a happy family.
- Well, anyway, a family.

806
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,029
- We loved our Martha.
- Don't mention her name again.

807
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,600
And if she comes crawling
back to me on her knees...

808
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,035
she'll find the door closed —
and don't you open it.

809
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,038
Please, dear family...

810
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,405
thank you, thank you for your efforts
to comfort me in my bereavement...

811
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,310
but I feel there are others who need
even more consolation than I do.

812
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,644
Uncle Randolph and Aunt Bertha...

813
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:11,119
you will have to forget as the years pass by
that you are the parents of the guilty party.

814
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,280
And you, Mr. And Mrs. Strable —

815
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,382
well, there's very little
I can say to sustain you.

816
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,155
And to you, Mrs. Cooper-Cooper...

817
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:24,326
I offer our deepest apology for the unfortunate
interruption of your beautiful aria.

818
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,961
I would like to go on,
but the strain is too much.

Flogdell.

820
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,788
- Do you know where they were going?
- No, sir.

821
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,790
Flogdell, we've been together for 30 years.
You've never lied to me.

822
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,792
Now tell me.
Do you know where they were going?

823
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,794
- Yes, sir.
- Get your hat and coat.

824
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:55,831
- Very well, sir.
- Get a cab and tell the driver to go like lightning.

825
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,595
- Very well, sir.
- I think they should have a honeymoon, don't you?

826
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,727
- I think so, sir.
- Then hurry, hurry, hurry!

- Yes, sir.

## [Whistling "Yankee Doodle Dandy"]

841
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,626
- Shh! Jackie.
- Good morning, Daddy.

842
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:03,222
You know very well you're not supposed to
bounce that ball until your mother is up.

843
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,392
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- I've told you this many times.

844
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,402
And I'm always sorry, Daddy.

845
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,735
Daddy, I'll bet you'd like to know
what I'm gonna give you for your birthday.

846
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,741
- I'm dying to know.
- It's something to wear.

847
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,607
- Let's see now. Uh, is it a tie?
- I'm not telling.

848
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:18,738
I'll give you a hint.
It has 22 colors in it.

849
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,477
No tie can have that many colors,
so it can't be a tie.

850
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,315
It can't be, huh?
Now, I'm not saying it is a tie...

851
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:27,788
but if it were a tie, there wouldn't be
another one like it in the world.

852
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,758
- I can believe that, Jackie.
- Daddy, how old are you going to be?

853
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,761
- Thirty-six.
- That's pretty old, isn't it?

854
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,890
Uh —Well, I never thought about it,
but I guess it is.

855
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,766
Daddy, when you were as old as me,
what kind of a kid were you?

856
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,203
Well, I was very obedient.

857
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,934
When my parents told me to go to bed,
I went without arguing.

858
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,068
I did my schoolwork,
brushed my teeth every morning.

859
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:51,477
Gee, Daddy.
I guess you were a wonderful boy.

860
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,572
Well, I suppose I was.

861
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,049
Then old Grandpa
must be a terrible liar.

- Do you think Martha will like it?
- Oh, it's beautiful.

After 10 years of me,
she's entitled to it.

Yes. Ten years next Tuesday.

and share this happiness with us.

see you settle down, become a fine husband...

and a wonderful son.

Well, it's all Martha.

876
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:44,799
And only Martha.

877
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,062
You know, Mother,
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

878
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,139
Yes. She's a fine wife,
and she has a good influence on you.

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,038
- And she's pretty lucky herself.

By the way, isn't she
coming down to breakfast?

882
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:04,711
I didn't go into her room. The opera lasted
till after midnight, so she's probably tired.

883
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,789
Thank you.

884
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:24,070
- Anything serious?
- No. No. Nothing.

Let me see that telegram.

889
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,619
It's just something personal.
It has nothing to do —

890
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,024
So, you don't trust me anymore, hmm?

00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,097
I'm getting too old.

892
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:46,080
Henry...

893
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,749
you mean we've lost Martha?

894
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,289
It's impossible.
It's incredible.

895
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,095
It just doesn't make sense,
Martha leaving me.

896
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,896
What did you do?
What happened?

897
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,767
I don't know how I can
go on living without her.

898
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:06,069
Grandpa, I love Martha.
I love her more than anything in the world.

899
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:09,009
I didn't ask you that.
I asked you what happened.

900
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:12,081
I don't know.

901
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,614
I always thought she was
very happy with me.

902
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,779
I don't know what she's heard.
You know how people talk about anybody.

903
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:21,254
No man is perfect.

904
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,519
But running away like this —

905
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,323
Believe me.
I — I can't see any reason for it.

906
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,331
If a woman like Martha runs away from
her husband, there must be a reason.

907
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,838
Now look here, Henry.

908
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,706
You were the only Van Cleve
I ever really cared about. I loved you.

909
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,869
You were like me —
at least I thought so.

910
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,879
You were all the things
I wanted to be.

911
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,279
You did all the things
I wanted to do and didn't.

912
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:51,150
- And now you've let me down.
- Grandpa, I can't live without her.

913
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,483
- What —What am I gonna do?
- That's up to you.

914
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,754
But let me tell you one thing.
I'm an old man.

915
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,489
I might have to go any day now.

916
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,861
And if you can't
make Martha forgive you...

917
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,696
I'll be waiting up there
right in the entrance.

918
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,737
And if you ever dare
to climb up that ladder...

919
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:11,705
I'll hit you on the head
with a baseball bat.

- Where are the funny papers?

- Good morning, Jasper.

00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:23,605
Uh, it's terrible bad weather
we're having today.

930
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,614
You know, when I see it
pouring like this...

931
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,116
I often wonder,
where does it all come from?

932
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,120
You tell Mr. Strable he'll get
the funny papers when I'm through...

933
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,122
and not one second sooner.

934
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,124
Yes, ma'am.
I certainly will.

935
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,194
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,797
Boss...

937
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,800
I just had a very fine
conversation with the missus...

938
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:50,305
and she says if you'd just be good enough
to give the matter a little patience...

939
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,308
as soon as she finishes
<i>The Katzenjammer Kids</i> I think—

940
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,436
I came down
especially early this morning...

941
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:59,447
to find out if the captain
got out of the barrel!

942
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:03,315
This goes on every Sunday,
and I'm not gonna stand it anymore!

943
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,548
- Jasper!
- Excuse me, Mr. Strable.

944
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,625
Yes'm?

945
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,628
You can tell Mr. Strable
the captain got out of the barrel.

946
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,630
Boss! Boss!

947
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,632
Got good news for ya!

948
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:20,134
The captain is out!
Ain't that fine?

949
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:23,205
- Now you can have a few more cakes.
- Ah, just a couple.

950
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:28,336
I can't see how he could
get out of that barrel.

951
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,603
Why, that barrel
had wooden slats...

952
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,615
nailed down
on the top and the bottom...

953
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,617
and there were steel bands
all around it...

954
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,119
and they left it
in the middle of the desert.

955
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,622
Now, how could he
ever get out of it?

956
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,124
You eat your cakes
while they're nice and hot.

957
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:47,196
In the meantime,
I'll see what I can find out.

958
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:54,193
- Uh, another lamb chop, Mrs. Strable?
- I don't mind.

959
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:59,332
About that barrel, the way he got out of it was,
a friendly snake came crawling —

960
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,342
Don't tell me!

961
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,605
You know it's no fun
unless I read it myself!

962
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,511
What are you trying to do,
ruin my Sunday?

963
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:10,177
Will you tell Mr. Strable
I was talking to you?

964
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,652
Jasper...

965
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:16,088
the snake came crawling along
in the desert...

966
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:20,060
wound itself around the barrel,
and then, crunch!

967
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:24,031
I can't live in this house any longer!

968
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,033
<i>- Mr. Strable.</i>
- What do you want, Daisy?

969
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,036
There's a gentleman here to see you
say he's from New York.

970
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,402
- His name is Van Cleve.
- Van Cleve?

971
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,408
That's the gentleman's name,
yes, sir.

972
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,741
The nerve of him,
trying to walk into this house.

973
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,371
- Tell him to go back where he came from.
- Yes, ma'am.

974
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,382
- Wait a minute, Daisy.
- Yes, sir?

975
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:44,578
Maybe I ought to see Mr. Van Cleve.
And if I wanna see him, he'll come in.

976
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,145
And if I want him to stay here,
he'll stay right here!

977
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,260
- Now, Daisy...
- Yes, sir?

978
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:56,264
Go tell that man if he's not off these premises
in 10 seconds, I'll wring his neck!

979
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,266
Yes, sir.
I'll most certainly tell him.

980
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,735
- Jasper, get me some fresh hotcakes.
- Yes, sir.

981
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:07,875
Excuse me, sir, but maybe somethin'
done happened to Miss Martha.

982
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,912
- You talk too much.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

983
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,914
- Jasper.
<i>- Yes, ma'am?</i>

984
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,916
Tell that man to come in.

985
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,986
Yes, ma'am.

986
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,214
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir!

987
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,259
Mr. Van Cleve, if you please.

988
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,262
How do you do?

989
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,897
Oh! It's the other one!

990
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,661
It's Albert.
Hello, Albert.

991
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:35,329
- How do you do, Mrs. Strable?
- How do you do?

992
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:38,874
- How do you do, Mr. Strable?
- Well, we haven't seen each other since —

993
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:42,877
Not since that ill-fated occasion
10 years ago tomorrow.

994
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:44,879
- Mmm. Had breakfast?
- Yes, thank you.

995
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,881
- Well, sit down anyway.
- Thank you.

996
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:50,475
- Got some business in Kansas?
- No, I was on my way to California.

997
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,887
But I said to myself, why shouldn't I stop
and pay my respects to those charming Strables?

998
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:57,892
- Well, what do you want?
- Nothing. Nothing in particular.

999
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,894
- Good.
- Oh, yes!

1000
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,896
There is one bit of news.

1001
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:05,092
I'll bet you can't guess
whom I met accidentally on the train.

1002
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,101
Probably not.

1003
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,967
- How's business in New York?
- Very good.

1004
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:12,974
Well, I don't want to keep you
in suspense any longer.

1005
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,772
I met your own daughter, Martha.

1006
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,211
Don't mention her name
in this house!

1007
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,215
We don't want to hear
anything more about her.

1008
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,217
My dear friends...

1009
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:26,049
speaking as a jurist, may I say
that even in our penal code...

1010
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,555
we have wisely provided
a system of parole...

1011
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,990
and I have excellent reason to believe
that the party—

1012
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,461
whose name I, naturally, will not mention
in this house — has amply paid for her mistake.

1013
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,997
Good.

1014
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:40,035
And I am sure there is nothing she'd like better
than to come back to the paternal nest.

1015
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,969
So she wants to leave him,
and now she remembers us.

1016
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,007
Not a chance, Albert.
That's final.

1017
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,973
Well, she's waiting in a carriage...

1018
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,979
in front of this very house.

1019
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,981
Who?

1020
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,244
Martha?

1021
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,752
- Martha? Here?
<i>- Yes, Mr. And Mrs. Strable.</i>

1022
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,755
Shall I bring her in?

1023
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,223
- Well, I don't know what Mrs. Strable thinks.
- Well, I —

1024
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,886
- And I don't care.
- I don't care what <i>you</i> think.

1025
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,362
- She might just as well come in
and stay till after the rain's over.
- All right.

1026
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,863
Oh, Martha! Martha!

1027
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,254
Hello.

1028
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,625
- Hello, Father.
- Hello.

1029
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,134
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Martha.

1030
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,796
- Welcome home, Miss Martha.
- Thank you, Jasper.

1031
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,067
- We all missed you.
- Get outta here.

1032
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,075
- You talk too much.
- Yes, sir.

1033
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:57,078
Well, I assume there are things
between daughter and parents...

1034
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,081
that are better left to the daughter
and to the parents.

1035
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,083
If you'll excuse me.

1036
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:06,679
Well, I suppose it was a pretty muddy ride
from the station in all that rain.

1037
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,689
Yes, I suppose it was.

1038
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,691
Uh, do you want some breakfast?

1039
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,193
It's Sunday morning.
We got wheat cakes.

1040
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:16,197
Thank you, Father,
but I'm not hungry.

1041
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:19,291
Well, the place hasn't
changed much, has it?

1042
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,838
No, it looks exactly the same.

1043
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:25,066
Maybe now
you'll appreciate your home.

1044
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,075
It took you 10 years to find out
that we were right.

1045
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:31,874
- If you'd listened to your mother—
- And your father, things might have been different.

1046
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,882
- I think I'd better be going.
- Oh, you're getting touchy, huh?

1047
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:37,418
Well, if anyone has
a right to be angry, it's us.

1048
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,081
But we're willing
to let bygones be bygones.

1049
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,751
After all, we're not made of stone.
If a daughter comes home and is sorry—

1050
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,352
I'm not sorry,
and I don't want your forgiveness.

1051
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,363
Then what did you come home for?

1052
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:52,161
I came here because I felt
I wanted to see you.

1053
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,431
- If you expect me to get down on my knees —
- Now, now, now, now, forget it.

1054
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,871
After all, you were young,
and it probably was all the fault of that —

1055
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,875
Please, Father.

1056
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:04,174
I don't want to hear a single unpleasant word
about the last 10 years, or I'll have to go.

1057
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,918
Martha.

1058
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,920
You look so tired, dear.

1059
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,923
- Well, no wonder. After all —
- Can't you keep still?

1060
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,892
It's all dead and buried,
and let's forget it.

1061
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,895
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

1062
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:24,489
You're going to have a nice, hot bath,
and then you're going to lie down and rest.

1063
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,568
<i>Now, how's that? Huh?</i>

1064
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,274
[Blowing]

1065
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,167
So he really got out of that barrel.

1066
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,238
Well, what do you think of that?

1067
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,832
[No Audible Dialogue]

1068
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:51,313
<i>[Dog Snarling, Barking]</i>

1069
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:58,289
<i>- [Barking Continues]</i>
- Jasper!

1070
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,794
Jasper!
What's all that noise about?

1071
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,298
Just had a talk with Mr. Chuck.

1072
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,460
He say somebody said they saw
a couple of prowlers on the grounds.

1073
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,733
- Maybe some of them horse thieves.
- Well, tell Chuck to keep after 'em.

1074
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,740
- Yes, sir.
- If necessary, shoot 'em.

1075
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,707
Yes, sir.

1076
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:20,080
Excuse me, Father, but if you don't mind,
I think I'll go upstairs.

1077
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,082
I'm getting pretty tired.
Good night.

1078
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,084
- Good night, Martha.
- Good night, Mother.

1079
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,916
Good night, dear.
Remember, breakfast at 7:30.

1080
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,923
Yes, Mother.
Good night, Albert.

1081
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,993
Good night, Martha.

1082
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,001
<i>Martha?</i>

1083
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,339
Well, Martha, I want you
to have a restful night.

1084
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,001
And why not?
Your troubles are actually over.

1085
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,510
- I suppose you're right.
- I know I am.

1086
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,275
You paid for your mistakes,
and paid dearly.

1087
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:58,081
Now, I don't want anybody to get the impression
that I've been the victim of 10 years of misery.

1088
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,087
Nothing of the kind.

1089
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,623
On the contrary, I can say
there were moments in my marriage...

1090
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,626
which few women have been
lucky enough to have experienced.

1091
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:08,629
- There were times when you were lifted
way up to the sky...
- Yes, way up.

1092
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:10,995
Only to be dropped way down afterward.

1093
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,797
That's not the purpose of marriage.
Marriage isn't a series of thrills.

1094
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:19,102
Marriage is a peaceful, well-balanced
adjustment of two right-thinking people.

1095
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,574
I'm afraid that's only too true.

1096
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:23,577
Well, good night, Albert.

1097
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:28,275
Uh, Martha, there's... one other thought
I want you to sleep with.

1098
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:33,049
My feelings for you
have remained unchanged.

1099
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,056
That's very kind of you, Albert,
and I'm touched.

1100
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,558
Naturally, I'm not the flashy type,
like some people.

1101
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,562
I'd say I was rather
on the conservative side.

1102
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:45,327
If I were, for instance, a suit of clothes,
you wouldn't call me a stylish cut.

1103
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,493
And I prefer it that way.

1104
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:51,164
But I can safely say
I'm made of solid material.

1105
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:54,800
I'm sewed together carefully
and my lining is good, Martha.

1106
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,504
Frankly, I believe I wear well.

1107
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:00,514
I'm... not too hot in the summer...

1108
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:03,779
and I give protection in the winter.

1109
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:06,286
- Need I say more?
- No, Albert.

1110
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:10,086
You've given a complete
and accurate description of yourself.

1111
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,820
- Good night.
- Thank you, Martha.

1112
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:21,535
<i>- Miss Martha?</i>
- Yes?

1113
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,037
Excuse me.
That horse thief we were looking for—

1114
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,040
- Did you catch him?
- Yes, ma'am.

1115
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,906
- He's in your room waiting for you.
- In my r—

1116
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,709
- You mean —
- Yes, miss. That's him.

1117
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,253
Martha, darling, sweetheart —

1118
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:50,387
How could you do a thing like this to me?
Don't you realize what I went through?

1119
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,899
- Oh, Henry—
- Running away like that without a word!

1120
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,902
Can't you imagine how I suffered?

1121
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:58,565
How could you do this to me?
Oh, Martha, Martha.

1122
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,142
Henry, it won't work anymore.

1123
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:05,579
- What's Albert doing here?
- I met him by accident on the train.

1124
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,582
- He was very nice to me, and —
- Accident? You expect me to believe that?

1125
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:11,585
Here I am, looking all over the world
for my wife, going insane with despair.

1126
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:15,384
And where do I find her? 2,000 miles away
in a lonely country place with another man.

1127
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:18,460
- I don't see how I can stand any more.
- Henry, it won't work.

1128
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,895
Very well.

1129
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:24,898
If it comes to the point where
a woman doubts her husband's sincerity...

1130
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,900
there's nothing more to do.

1131
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,902
Everything is over.
Good-bye, Martha.

1132
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,972
Good-bye, Henry.

1133
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,275
Martha, I really mean this.
I'm going.

1134
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,043
I know you mean it, Henry.

1135
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,120
All right.

1136
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:52,025
Just give me five minutes to pull myself together,
and you'll never see me again. Never, never.

1137
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,756
Oh, Henry, I know your every move.

1138
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,957
I know your outraged indignation.

1139
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,967
I know the poor, weeping little boy.

1140
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:03,698
I know the misunderstood,
strong, silent man...

1141
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:08,243
the wounded lion who's too proud to explain
what happened in the jungle last night.

1142
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,244
So, I'm a fake.

1143
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,246
- I'm false, I'm cheap.
- Oh, Henry, please —

1144
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,748
- I know I've brought you nothing but unhappiness.
- You know that's not true.

1145
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,250
- Oh! So we had some good times together.
- Some wonderful times.

1146
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,254
Then what do you want? What did I do?
Even a murderer has a right to defend himself.

1147
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:22,916
- [Together]
You can't hang a man without evidence.
- I know.

1148
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,926
[Sighs] If I only knew
what particular thing is in your mi —

1149
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:27,928
- Have you seen Aunt Minetta recently?
- Yes, of course.

1150
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,930
Oh, well, now everything is clear.

1151
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:32,933
This is something I didn't even want to
mention to you, it's so unimportant.

1152
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:35,435
When she saw me, yes,
I was at the Plaza having tea...

1153
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:38,439
and at the table with me was a very handsome
young woman, but there was nothing to it.

1154
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,442
- I would have explained to you myself—
- But you didn't want to make me uncomfortable.

1155
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:44,445
- Even for one second.
- That's right, darling. That's exactly right.

1156
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:48,210
Henry, it won't work. And besides,
Aunt Minetta didn't say one word about you.

1157
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:51,218
- And as for the young lady at the Plaza —
- Darling, I can easily explain that.

1158
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,447
Oh, I know you can.
You're a master at that.

1159
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:55,956
All right, all right.
I'm fighting a losing battle.

1160
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:58,959
I don't love you. I never loved you.
I love everybody in New York more than you.

1161
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:02,030
- There you go again.
<i>- [Bell Tolling]</i>

1162
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,896
It's the 25th of October.

1163
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:11,973
Many happy returns.

1164
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,445
Thank you, Martha...

1165
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,448
but it's something much more important
than my birthday.

1166
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,814
It's our anniversary.

1167
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:29,084
Ten years ago today, I was almost
as much in love with you as I am right now.

1168
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:33,855
It's very difficult for a woman to send
her husband away on their 10th anniversary...

1169
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:36,932
especially when he speaks
as beautifully as you do.

1170
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,867
But I must do it.

1171
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,836
All right, darling.
I know it's all over.

1172
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:47,865
I'm sure you'll find someone else
who will be... really worthy of you.

1173
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,911
But let's pretend...

1174
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,981
just for a minute.

1175
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,984
Happy anniversary.

1176
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,755
Do you like it?

1177
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:04,485
I'd say it cost at least $10,000.

1178
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:08,462
For that money,
it's a very good purchase.

1179
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:11,590
Why, Martha,
how can you talk like that?

1180
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,601
If you'd only forgotten
to give me this bracelet...

1181
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:18,605
I probably would have been foolish enough
to be in your arms right now.

1182
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,870
You've no idea
what a mistake you made.

1183
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:24,741
The magician
played one trick too many.

1184
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,684
The other day I was having
a new photograph made ofJackie and me.

1185
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:33,983
I wanted to have it the right size
to fit into your wallet.

1186
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,049
So I slipped into your room.

1187
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,423
This fell out of your wallet.

1188
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:56,077
And I don't ever remember having received
any bracelet from you on or about May 2.

1189
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,578
Oh, so <i>that's</i> what it's all about.
[Laughs]

1190
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:01,582
And to think that you went through all this
just because the jeweler made a mistake.

1191
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:05,085
And that what the whole thing is — a mistake.
Naturally, I didn't buy a bracelet for $500.

1192
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,985
Has Cartier ever made a mistake
in any of our bills before?

1193
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:11,457
Darling, I love you. I think you're the most
beautiful, adorable thing in all the world.

1194
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,461
Do you really believe there's any woman
good enough to take me away from you?

1195
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:17,225
And if there were such a woman, do you think
she'd be worth only a $500 bracelet?

1196
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,233
- Henry, I —
- Darling, I'll make you a bet.

1197
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,735
If Cartier doesn't admit that
this whole thing is a terrible mistake —

1198
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,397
- Then you won't buy there anymore.
- Henry, it won't work.

1199
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:27,407
- Grandpa!
- Martha, my darling.

1200
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,977
Come on, come on.
Let's get started. Let's pack.

1201
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,571
- Grandpa, what do you mean?
- Naturally, you're going back with us to New York.

1202
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,583
What are you standing there for?
You're making a pretty bad job of it.

1203
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,586
Come on, sweep her off her feet,
or we'll miss the next train.

1204
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,088
- If I can't make her happy,
then I don't want her to come back.
- Yeah, that's better.

1205
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,125
- No, I mean this seriously.
- That's why it's good.

1206
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,786
Look, Martha, let's face it.

1207
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,796
- You want a divorce.
- I see no other way.

1208
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:52,298
- What aboutJackie?
- Naturally, I want him.

1209
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,801
I think you're right.
I think he should get away from me.

1210
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,303
- I didn't mean it that way.
- But I did.

1211
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:59,806
I adore the boy, and therefore
I think he shouldn't be with me.

1212
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,809
Well, I don't think a child
should be deprived of his father.

1213
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:05,311
Do you want him to grow up
to be another Henry Van Cleve...

1214
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:08,315
and on his 36th birthday make his wife
as unhappy as I've made you?

1215
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:11,318
- Are the rest of your things in the closet?
- Yes.

1216
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,321
For instance, do you know
what our littleJackie did the other day?

1217
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,823
- What?
- He bought some ice cream for a little girl.

1218
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,052
What's wrong about that?
I think it's charming.

1219
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:22,130
But the girl he bought the ice cream for
was not the girl he should have bought it for.

1220
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,789
- It wasn't?
- No.

1221
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,560
Little devil.

1222
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,568
And when the one little girl
found out that the other girl —

1223
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,002
Well, that boy got himself
into such a mess.

1224
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:33,006
Oh, if I only could have been there.

1225
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,770
You should have seen our littleJackie
trying to get himself out of that situation.

1226
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:38,403
- Did he?
- Yes.

1227
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,414
Little girl likes him better than before.

1228
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,144
Good. What a child.

1229
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,483
- Believe me, he is a problem.
- I suppose so.

1230
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,488
But when he makes up his little stories —

1231
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,491
And you know they're just little stories,
but he wants you to believe them so badly...

1232
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,493
that you wish you could...

1233
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,927
and finally what can you do but —

1234
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,673
Happy anniversary.

1235
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,675
I'm still too confused.
I've got to collect myself.

1236
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,177
- Give her time to make up her mind.
- She can do that on the train.

1237
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,181
- But what am I going to say to my parents?
- Send 'em a telegram.

1238
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,183
- Sneak out of the house in the middle of the night?
- Exactly.

1239
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,185
- Like burglars?
- Like thieves.

1240
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,187
- We did it once before.
- Why shouldn't we do it again?

1241
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:23,190
- How many people are lucky enough to have
the thrill of eloping twice in one marriage?
- That's it! That's it!

1242
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,693
- How many women love their husbands enough
to forgive them and start all over again?
- Good! Good!

1243
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:29,696
And how many men love their wives enough to lie
and say they're guilty when they've done nothing?

1244
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,699
- Careful, Henry, careful.
- At least nothing that amounts to very much.

1245
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,201
I wouldn't go any further into that.
We'd better get started.

1246
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,272
I'll see if the coast is clear.

<i>- Yes?</i>

1248

- Everything ready?
- Yes, sir. Right out in front.

1249
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,050

to run away with a woman.

1250
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,848

- Thank you, sir.

1251
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,791

1268
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:44,188
<i>Yes, I became 45.</i>

1269
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,199

1271
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,370

<i>- ##[Orchestra Continues]</i>
<i>- Suddenly I noticed...</i>

1291
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:54,231
<i>a very attractive girl</i>
<i>coming down the staircase.</i>

1292
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,237
<i>To me she was</i>
<i>just another attractive girl...</i>

1293
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,864
<i>but, I must admit, attractive.</i>

1294
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,809
<i>Anyway, a few weeks later...</i>

1295
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,880
<i>I happened to find out</i>
<i>that her name was Peggy Nash...</i>

1296
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:11,078
<i>and I happened to hear things about her</i>
<i>which made me very eager to meet Miss Nash.</i>

1297
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:24,263
<i>- [Woman] Yes?</i>
- A Mr. Jones to see you.

1298
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,334
<i>I'll be out in a minute.</i>

1299
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,475
- Will you come in, please, Mr. Jones?
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1300
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:38,546
- Miss Nash will be with you in just a minute.
- Thank you.

1301
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:56,458
- How do you do, Mr. Jones?
<i>- How do you do, Miss Nash?</i>

1302
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:00,127
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

1303
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:05,331
Thank you so much
for those beautiful, beautiful roses.

1304
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,171
When I saw you the other evening at the Follies
coming down that stairway, I said to myself—

1305
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,177
"That's the girl of my dreams"?

1306
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,940
Uh, that's right.

1307
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:15,016
- You see, Miss Nash —
- Call me Peggy.

1308
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:18,084
Well, this is delightful.

1309
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,177
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello, Jonesy.

1310
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:22,256
[Both Chuckling]

1311
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:25,588
Well, Jonesy, let me tell you,
that note that came with your flowers —

1312
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,594
- You liked it?
- Who wouldn't?

1313
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:30,096
It was so full of charm.
It was so sweet.

1314
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,530
It had all the quaintness
of bygone days.

1315
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,932
[Clears Throat]
Really?

1316
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:37,698
Yes. You know, men don't
write that way anymore.

1317
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:39,706
Why are there so few of you left?

1318
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:42,140
[Clears Throat]
Miss Nash, to tell you the truth...

1319
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:45,145
I didn't exactly come up here
to be admired as a museum piece.

1320
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:47,147
Now, Jonesy, don't be touchy.

1321
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:49,149
- Yeah. Anyway, Miss Nash —
- Peggy.

1322
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,151
Anyway, Peggy...

1323
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:54,154
I'm sure it's a waste of time
to talk of the past...

1324
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:57,953
when the present can be so lovely
that one anticipates a most delightful future.

1325
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:00,960
Oh, thank you, Jonesy.
What a difference.

1326
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:03,963
You know, the moment you meet
somebody of today he says...

1327
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:06,295
"How about it, babe?
Where do we have supper?"

1328
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,801
The next moment,
he pulls out a diamond bracelet.

1329
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:11,805
And before you know it
there it is on your wrist.

1330
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,875
How crude. How crude.

1331
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,875
Yes, very crude.

1332
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:17,877
And let me tell you...

1333
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,879
a bracelet hastily presented...

1334
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,040
is usually selected hastily...

1335
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,710
whereas a bracelet chosen with care —

1336
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,880
- Has better stones?
- The very best.

1337
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:31,152
Oh, Jonesy, Jonesy,
you make it all sound so wonderful.

1338
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:34,558
- But how could I explain such a gift to —
- To whom?

1339
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,768
Oh. Friend of yours?

1340
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,770
Very much so.

1341
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,272
- Serious?
- I'm afraid it is.

1342
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:49,275
Is there anything I could do
to make you forget this young man?

1343
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:51,572
Jonesy, you're asking a lot.

1344
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,648
Just look at him.

1345
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:56,979
- He seems very young.
- Not <i>too</i> young.

1346
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:00,612
Would it be indiscreet of me
to ask who this young man is?

1347
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:05,888
Come on, Mr. Van Cleve.
Don't you know your own son?

1348
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,054
No, I didn't fall into your trap.

1349
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:12,133
You know, Mr. Van Cleve,
girls are awfully smart these days.

1350
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:15,135
It must be rather sad
for the great cavalier of the gay '90s...

1351
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:17,137
to find his technique
is getting rusty.

1352
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:20,640
Yes, I've heard all about
the daring Henry.

1353
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:23,233
I understand
in my mother's day you were.

1354
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:26,576
And I'm sure you had
a very dashing figure.

1355
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:29,275
And now you're a kind of, um...

1356
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,318
retired Casanova.

1357
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:34,320
You know, it's always the same with men
when they retire.

1358
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:37,152
Some grow flowers, and, uh...

1359
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,227
some grow a tummy.

1360
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:47,300
Miss Nash, my son
means very much to me.

1361
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:50,633
- He means very much to me too.
- How much?

1362
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,640
Oh, yes, that's right.
Of course.

1363
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,642
In your day girls used to wait...

1364
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:59,339
for the old-fashioned father to come
with the big checkbook to pay off.

1365
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,347
I'm sure that happened.

1366
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:03,576
Well, that's one thing
that hasn't changed.

1367
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:07,121
Shall we say... 5,000?

1368
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:09,122
Five thousand?

1369
01:22:09,224 --> 01:22:11,124
Oh, Jonesy, you underestimate me.

1370
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,126
I'm much worse than that.

1371
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:16,527
To get rid of somebody
as terrible as me is worth —

1372
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:20,260
Well, I'll make you a bargain —
$25,000.

1373
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,705
All right.
I'll send you the money.

1374
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:29,038
- Before lunch?
- Before lunch.

1375
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:31,044
Good-bye, Miss Nash.

1376
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:33,671
- You've been perfectly charming.
- And so have you.

1377
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:37,377
- And you hope never to see me again.
- [Chuckles] I wouldn't say that.

1378
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:43,050
Miss Nash, now that our problem
has been solved...

1379
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,388
I would like to ask
one slight question.

1380
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:49,896
Not that it matters, but I'm just curious
and I would appreciate an honest answer.

1381
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,898
I give you my word.

1382
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,993
Suppose you didn't know I was Jack's father
and you happened to see me on the street...

1383
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,504
or in a restaurant.

1384
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:01,166
This is just an academic question.

1385
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:03,176
How old would you say I am?

1386
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:05,838
Well, I'd say about 50.

1387
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:09,082
- That old?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1388
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,085
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Oh, no, no. That's perfectly all right.

1389
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:15,748
- Thanks very much.
- Excuse me, but how old are you?

1390
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,759
Fifty.

1391
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,739
No wonder you get those headaches.

1392
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,143
Thank you, darling.

1393
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:56,128
[Clears Throat]
Martha, this is going to be a bit unpleasant.

1394
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:59,894
I've tried to keep it from you for some time,
but now I think I'd better tell you.

1395
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:02,902
I know.
You don't love me anymore.

1396
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:05,131
Now, darling, don't try to be funny.

1397
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,140
It's aboutJack.

1398
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:09,642
Will you please
stop worrying aboutJack?

1399
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:12,144
If he wants to stay out late,
what of it?

1400
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:15,341
If he's ever going to have any fun,
now's the time. Don't spoil it.

1401
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:19,352
Martha, this is serious.
Very, very serious.

1402
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:23,185
I just happened to learn the boy
got into the clutches of a certain girl.

1403
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:26,692
I went to a great deal of trouble —
Believe me, it wasn't easy—

1404
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:29,093
but I managed to find out
who the girl was.

1405
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,165
- You mean Peggy Nash?
- Ye —

1406
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,962
Where did you —
How did you know?

1407
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,732
Oh, I forget.
Someone told me.

1408
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,535
You go to lunch,
and you hear things.

1409
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:44,840
Why didn't you tell me? How can you
be so placid about a thing like this?

1410
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:47,437
Darling, why should I excite you?

1411
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:51,952
I know you so well. Certain little things
get you all worked up, and then you don't sleep.

1412
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:55,022
Then you have to take a pill,
and then you don't want to take a pill.

1413
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:58,024
Believe me, Henry,
the less attention you pay to them —

1414
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:00,026
Really, these things
work themselves out.

1415
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:02,028
Oh, Martha, Martha.

1416
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,030
That is one of your greatest charms.

1417
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:08,034
After almost 25 years in New York,
you're still the innocent little girl from Kansas.

1418
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:12,539
But, fortunately,
I have had experience with showgirls.

1419
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,167
And it's a father's function
to save his son from the mistakes he made.

1420
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:20,077
If we ignore matters like this,
how do you think our boy will end up?

1421
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:23,082
Just like you —with a girl like me.

1422
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:25,744
No, darling, never.

1423
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:27,754
Where would he find
anybody like you?

1424
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:29,756
He couldn't.
He won't be that lucky.

1425
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:33,350
- Aren't you sweet.
- I have no illusions about myself.

1426
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:36,658
Martha, if I hadn't met you
I hate to think where I'd be right now.

1427
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,664
Well, probably outside
some stage door...

1428
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,666
or even inside the dressing room...

1429
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,668
and having a wonderful time.

1430
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:45,170
- [Chuckles] Oh, now, darling —
- Come on. Give me a kiss.

1431
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:47,241
Don't let's worry about it anymore.

1432
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,049
[Clears Throat]

1433
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,552
Martha, I just want to
get your viewpoint.

1434
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:04,216
Do you think it would be a bad idea,
just to be safe, if I looked up this girl and, uh —

1435
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,225
And what?

1436
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:09,228
Well, maybe,
just to avoid complications...

1437
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:12,731
ask her to leave the boy alone
and, if necessary, buy her off.

1438
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,735
Now, Henry, don't even consider
anything as foolish as that.

1439
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,738
All right, all right, all right.
It was just a thought.

1440
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,741
- If you want me to, I'll drop it.
- Good.

1441
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,811
How much did you pay the girl?

1442
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:27,279
Why, what do you mean?

1443
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:30,078
Don't I know my Henry
and his innocent eyes?

1444
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:33,382
I beg your pardon, sir, but you've told me
to let you know when Mr. Jack arrived, sir.

1445
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:35,513
- He's just come in, sir.
- Thank you.

1446
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,523
<i>- [Door Closes]</i>
- Mmm.

1447
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:40,526
You see? He's home early for the first time
in weeks, and I'll tell you why.

1448
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:43,028
He went to the theater as usual,
and she gave him his walking papers.

1449
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:46,259
- And the poor boy is probably all upset.
- I hope he is.

1450
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:49,268
And, Martha, don't you baby him.
Don't you spoil what I've done.

1451
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:52,305
- Hello.
<i>- [Martha] Hello, Jack.</i>

1452
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:54,375
Hello, Mother.

1453
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:58,444
Hello, Father.

1454
01:26:58,546 --> 01:26:59,945
- How are you, Jack?
- Fine.

1455
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,882
- You look a little depressed.
- Who, me? I never felt better in all my life.

1456
01:27:03,985 --> 01:27:05,885
Besides that, I could use $100.

1457
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:08,080
A hundred dollars?
What for?

1458
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:11,886
Well, I wanna throw a little party tonight,
take someone out.

1459
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,483
Oh. I see.

1460
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:16,496
Tell me, whom are you
going around with these days, Jack?

1461
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:19,499
Now, Martha, that's Jack's personal life
and we shouldn't pry into it.

1462
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,501
Here you are, Jack.
There's your hundred dollars.

1463
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:23,503
- Thanks, Father.
- Have a good time.

1464
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:25,800
- Thanks.
- I'm not interested in whom you're taking out.

1465
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,807
I'm sure she's all right.

1466
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:31,140
Anyway, it's none of our business
whether you're taking out MaryJones...

1467
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,146
Helen Smith, Mitzi Glutz...

1468
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,148
or Peggy Nash.

1469
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,945
Peggy Nash?

1470
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:39,952
Father, what is this? Are you trailing me?
Where'd you hear that name?

1471
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,954
I don't know.

1472
01:27:42,056 --> 01:27:44,456
Martha, where did we
hear that name?

1473
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:46,789
I don't know.
And don't ask me.

1474
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:49,920
Well, uh, uh, one has friends...

1475
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:53,728
and, yes, one goes to lunch an —

1476
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:57,327
Tell me, isn't she a Follies girl
famous for coming down a staircase?

1477
01:27:57,438 --> 01:28:00,339
- Look, we're all grown up, aren't we?
- Why, certainly.

1478
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:03,638
- Well, I had a crush on her.
- Ah, and why not?

1479
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:07,112
- Why shouldn't he?
- I don't know. And don't ask me.

1480
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:10,116
I, uh — I understand
she's a very attractive girl.

1481
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:12,948
Oh, she is,
and I took her pretty seriously.

1482
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:16,148
- Oh, you <i>did,</i> huh?
- Yes, very.

1483
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:18,851
- And then after a little time...
- Yes?

1484
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,292
- I got tired of her.
- Oh.

1485
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:23,296
Oh, you did, huh?

1486
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:26,299
So then I faced the problem
of how to get rid of her.

1487
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:28,699
- Things like that aren't easy.
- I should say not.

1488
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:32,295
- Don't ask me.
- I didn't ask you. I merely made a statement.

1489
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:34,807
- Go on, Jack.
- After all, what could she do to me?

1490
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:36,809
I hadn't promised her anything.

1491
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:38,811
- You hadn't?
- I should say not.

1492
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:40,881
I wasn't the first romance in her life.

1493
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,882
You know, I'm no baby.

1494
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,885
But nevertheless, you went there
expecting a lot of trouble, didn't you?

1495
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,888
Yes, but to my surprise,
she was so big about the whole thing...

1496
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,890
and let me off so easily.

1497
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,392
Oh, she did, eh?
Well, isn't that fortunate.

1498
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,394
- [Chuckling]
<i>- Yes.</i>

1499
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:59,262
She was so wonderful about the whole thing,
I almost fell in love with her again.

1500
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:01,267
Y— Oh.

1501
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:04,270
Oh, but it's all over now,
and I'm glad of it.

1502
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:06,567
- And so am I.
- And so am I.

1503
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,575
As a matter of fact,
I never was happier in my life.

1504
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:12,578
And while we're on the subject, Jack,
I think you're getting to the age...

1505
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,444
where you should start to look around
for a really nice girl.

1506
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:18,451
Oh, I don't have to look around.
I've met her already.

1507
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:20,453
- You have?
- A wonderful girl.

1508
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:24,787
- The most wonderful girl I ever met in my life.
- Really! Well, isn't that nice.

1509
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:28,123
Tell me, who is the young lady?
Is she someone I might know?

1510
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,129
A New York girl, perhaps?

1511
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:32,131
Oh, no.
She comes from Philadelphia.

1512
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:34,133
Oh! From Philadelphia.

1513
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:36,965
Somehow Philadelphia always sounds right,
doesn't it, Martha?

1514
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:40,040
- Yes, it does. Tell us who she is.
- Yes, tell us.

1515
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:42,473
Well, have you been to
Earl Carroll's Vanities?

1516
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,177
You mean this girl
comes down a staircase too?

1517
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:49,249
I should say not.
Not this girl.

1518
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,477
This one slides down the bannister,
falls in the orchestra...

1519
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,486
and lands — bang —
right on the big drum.

1520
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,488
Oh, you'll be crazy about her.

1521
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,888
See you tomorrow.
I have to run along.

1522
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:04,630
What's the matter with that boy?

1523
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:07,292
He's young, Henry.
That's all.

1524
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,371
Come on, dear.
It's time to go to bed.

1525
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:22,281
Martha, I want to ask you something.

1526
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:24,783
And don't spare my feelings.
Be absolutely frank.

1527
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:26,786
I always am.

1528
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:29,789
If you didn't know me
and you saw me for the first time...

1529
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:32,121
on the street or in a restaurant —

1530
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,462
Martha, do you think
I'm getting a little heavy?

1531
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:39,965
[Laughs]
Don't let that worry you.

1532
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:41,967
As a matter of fact, I like it.

1533
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:43,969
Let me tell you something.

1534
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:47,973
Nearly 15 years ago, when you and Grandfather
brought me back from Kansas...

1535
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:51,704
I still didn't feel that you really
belonged to me, and only to me.

1536
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:54,281
I can't put my finger
on anything definite...

1537
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:58,443
but still, whenever I wasn't with you
I was always a little uncertain...

1538
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:02,045
and nervous
about my little Casanova.

1539
01:31:02,156 --> 01:31:04,522
- [Clearing Throat]
- And then...

1540
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:08,026
one day I noticed
that you began to have a little —

1541
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,563
Well, just a little tummy.

1542
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:14,066
Then I knew I was safe.

1543
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:19,162
From that moment on I knew that you
were really mine, that you'd settle down.

1544
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:26,374
Now go to bed, darling.
You've had a hard day.

1545
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,449
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.

1546
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:34,148
<i>[Henry Narrating]</i>
<i>Yes, we were married 25 years.</i>

1547
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:37,986
<i>We were celebrating</i>
<i>our silver wedding anniversary.</i>

1548
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:56,135
- Have you seen Mrs. Van Cleve?
- No, sir. I've been in the kitchen.

1549
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:01,148
- Jack, is your mother upstairs?
- No. I haven't seen her.

1550
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:10,548
Darling.
What are you doing in here all alone?

1551
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:13,058
Nothing.
I just want to take a little rest.

1552
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,061
- After all, it's been such an exciting evening.
- Nothing wrong, is there?

1553
01:32:16,163 --> 01:32:18,063
- No, nothing.
- Are you sure?

1554
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:20,065
- Yes, dear.
- You're feeling all right, aren't you?

1555
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:22,692
- Of course, darling. I'm just —
- Just what?

1556
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:25,704
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was being a little sentimental...

1557
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:28,707
so I came in here for a few minutes.

1558
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:30,777
Ah.

1559
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:34,079
Yes.

1560
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:36,411
This is where it all started.

1561
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:38,485
Twenty-five years ago.

1562
01:32:40,187 --> 01:32:42,155
I was —

1563
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:46,291
Yes, I was standing over there
by that desk.

1564
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:49,090
No, you were sitting in a chair.

1565
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:51,096
Yes. You're right.

1566
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:53,598
And then you came in
and <i>you</i> stood by the desk.

1567
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:56,101
Then suddenly
you started walking toward me...

1568
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:58,103
very slowly, very slowly.

1569
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:00,105
I could count every step.

1570
01:33:00,207 --> 01:33:03,608
Oh, you were such a frightened little girl.
The closer I came, the more frightened you were.

1571
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:05,804
Darling, I want to make a confession.

1572
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:08,643
- After all, we've been married 25 years.
- What is it?

1573
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,808
I wasn't frightened at all.

1574
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,818
- You weren't?
- Not at all.

1575
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,821
And when you were walking toward me
so very slowly, do you know what was in my mind?

1576
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:18,824
- No.
- I thought, What's the matter with him?
Can't he walk faster?

1577
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:20,894
[Both Laughing]

1578
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:29,502
- And then I ran out into the hall.
- But you came back.

1579
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,902
- Only because I had to sneeze.
- Mm-hmm.

1580
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:34,634
[Laughs]

1581
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:38,477
I beg your pardon, madam.
You are wanted on the telephone.

1582
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:40,547
Oh.

1583
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,019
Hello?

1584
01:33:47,121 --> 01:33:50,522
Yes, I called you.
Well, it's really not important.

1585
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,650
Yes, everything is all right now.

1586
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,660
I'll call you soon.

1587
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,730
All right, tomorrow.

1588
01:33:58,165 --> 01:34:00,065
- Who was that?
- Oh, nothing special.

1589
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:03,068
- Let's go back to our guests, shall we?
- Darling, who was that on the phone?

1590
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:05,570
- I'll tell you all about it some other time.
- Why not now?

1591
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:09,575
- Our guests will be wondering where we are.
- Now, Martha, who was that?

1592
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:11,577
All right, I'll tell you.

1593
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,579
It's another confession.

1594
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:16,081
- My lover.
- I don't think that's funny at all.

1595
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:19,084
- Are you jealous?
- Oh, don't be silly, Martha.

1596
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:22,087
But why can't you tell your husband
whom you talk to over the telephone?

1597
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:25,420
Besides, I wouldn't have brought it up
right now, but just the same...

1598
01:34:25,526 --> 01:34:28,427
for the past several weeks
you've been going out in the afternoons...

1599
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:31,430
and you've always managed
to avoid telling me where you were.

1600
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:33,432
You <i>are</i> jealous!

1601
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:36,298
Henry, at last, after 25 years!

1602
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:38,964
- Thank you, darling.
- Martha, whom did you talk to?

1603
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:42,474
Darling, don't be a baby. What dashing
young cavalier would be pursuing me?

1604
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:46,273
Plenty. You're still very attractive,
and — and you know it.

1605
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:49,214
Henry...

1606
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:53,150
I don't think you realize
how sweet you're being at this moment.

1607
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:57,486
No husband could have said anything lovelier
to his wife on their 25th anniversary.

1608
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:02,153
Imagine if, 25 years ago,
I hadn't sneezed.

1609
01:35:02,263 --> 01:35:05,824
I wouldn't be
the happiest woman in the world right now.

1610
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:08,265
- Are you?
- Yes, Henry.

1611
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:17,938
- Now, who was it?
- I'll tell you tomorrow.

1612
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:21,242
I am not going to leave this room
until you tell me.

1613
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:23,475
Well, knowing my obstinate little boy—

1614
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:26,485
You promise to be sensible
and not make a mountain out of a molehill?

1615
01:35:26,587 --> 01:35:29,317
- I promise. Now —
- Well, you know how women are.

1616
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:33,519
We have too much time on our hands, and we
begin to imagine there are things wrong with us.

1617
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:37,063
And I'm no exception,
so I've been going to a doctor, that's all.

1618
01:35:37,164 --> 01:35:39,132
[Laughing]

1619
01:35:40,634 --> 01:35:42,534
Darling, I feel like a fool.

1620
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:46,333
Now I have a confession I must make to you —
I really was jealous.

1621
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,136
Martha. What did you go to the doctor for?
What's wrong?

1622
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:51,643
- Nothing, really.
- So that's why you came in this room.

1623
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,647
- You weren't feeling well. Darling, is it serious?
- I tell you, it's nothing at all.

1624
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:56,649
- Just a little dizzy spell.
- Darling —

1625
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:00,687
Now, you promised to be sensible.
Come on, let's dance.

1626
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:05,316
Martha, what did the doctor say?

1627
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:09,021
Listen, dear, if I take five drops
three times a day...

1628
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:11,530
and if you don't
worry about me too much...

1629
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:14,032
we'll both live to celebrate
our golden anniversary.

1630
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:17,104
- Now, come on. Let's dance.

<i>[Henry Narrating]</i>
<i>I didn't know it then...</i>

1632
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:33,211
<i>but this was our last anniversary.</i>

1633
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:36,289
<i>It was the last time we danced together.</i>

1634
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:40,485
<i>There were only a few more months</i>

1635
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:45,120

1636
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:11,582
<i>Sixty. Yes, I was 60.</i>

1637
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:14,525
<i>Jack insisted on celebrating.</i>

1638
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:17,256
<i>And here are my relatives</i>
<i>who came to make this birthday...</i>

1639
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:20,527
<i>an occasion of riotous gaiety.</i>

1640
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:22,602
<i>Cousin William</i>— <i>73.</i>

1641
01:37:22,703 --> 01:37:25,695
<i>Aunt Minnie,</i>
<i>who admitted to 81.</i>

1642
01:37:25,806 --> 01:37:28,434
<i>The total age</i>
<i>of this scintillating assemblage...</i>

1643
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:31,568
<i>was over 1,400 years.</i>

1644
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:34,512
<i>I believeJack gave this party</i>
<i>on purpose...</i>

1645
01:37:34,615 --> 01:37:39,177
<i>to remind me that I was contributing</i>
<i>60 years to that 1,400.</i>

1646
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:46,825
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ralston.

1647
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:49,327
- Is Mr. Van Cleve down yet?
- He's having his breakfast.

1648
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,295
Oh. Thank you.

1649
01:37:53,801 --> 01:37:56,292
- Good morning, Mr. Van Cleve.
<i>- Good morning, Miss Ralston.</i>

1650
01:37:56,403 --> 01:37:59,304
Sorry to get you up so early, but I want
these two letters to leave on the 9:30 plane.

1651
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:01,306
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.

1652
01:38:01,408 --> 01:38:04,377
When you get back to the office, please see
that I get a complete domestic report...

1653
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:06,605
from every department before noon
because I may go to Chicago.

1654
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,614
Very well.

1655
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:11,617
Now, uh, there's just
one little thing.

1656
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:16,747
It's, uh —Well, a letter came in from your father
addressed to the board of directors, and —

1657
01:38:16,857 --> 01:38:18,757
Is he trying to go over my head again?

1658
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:21,623
- Oh, I'm sure he didn't mean it that way.
- What does he want?

1659
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:25,096
We live together in the same house,
and then he writes letters to the board of directors.

1660
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,099
What's the old gentleman
trying to put over this time?

1661
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:29,431
He wants the board of directors
to vote him a bonus.

1662
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:33,438
- A bonus?
- He talked to me yesterday, confidentially.

1663
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,440
In case that bonus doesn't go through...

1664
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:38,477
he wanted me to persuade you to give him
at least an advance on his monthly check.

1665
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:41,946
He shouldn't go to you, Miss Ralston.
Well, I'm gonna give him a lesson.

1666
01:38:56,163 --> 01:38:59,064
<i>And, Miss Ralston, if my father</i>
<i>ever talks to you again...</i>

1667
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:03,535
<i>tell him he ought to be ashamed and that</i>
<i>you are in no position to deliver any messages.</i>

1668
01:39:03,637 --> 01:39:05,605
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve.

1669
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:10,342
- Why, Mr. Van Cleve —
- Shh!

1670
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:12,344
- Is he in a bad mood?
- Terrible.

1671
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:15,347
Now, look here, Miss Ralston,
would you do me a very great favor?

1672
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:17,349
<i>- Father.!</i>
- Ohh.

1673
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:19,942
- Good morning, Jack.
- Good morning.

1674
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:22,022
I'd like to talk to you.

1675
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:26,760
<i>Father.</i>

1676
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:36,702
[Henry Laughing]

1677
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:40,706
I heard a very funny story. You'll love it.
It'll start your day off with a laugh.

1678
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:42,776
[Chuckles]

1679
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:50,081
You ought to be ashamed, coming home
at all hours, making a wreck of yourself.

1680
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:52,414
How much longer do you think
you can keep this up?

1681
01:39:52,519 --> 01:39:54,578
- Please, Jack, don't scold me.
- Someday you're gonna collapse.

1682
01:39:54,688 --> 01:39:56,952
- Do I look that bad?
- You look like a ghost.

1683
01:39:57,057 --> 01:40:00,390
I know you're right, Jack.
I know I should change my way of living.

1684
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:02,689
But, my boy,
put yourself in my position.

1685
01:40:02,796 --> 01:40:05,822
I'm lonesome.
You're always away somewhere on business.

1686
01:40:05,933 --> 01:40:09,391
Being alone in this big house night after night,
you don't know what it's like.

1687
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:11,596
Neither do you
because you're never at home.

1688
01:40:11,705 --> 01:40:15,106
But I can imagine what it's like,
and, Jack, it's horrible.

1689
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:17,439
Now, my boy, I want to talk to you.

1690
01:40:17,544 --> 01:40:20,945
I'm not fooling myself.
I'm not getting any younger.

1691
01:40:21,048 --> 01:40:23,949
I think the time has come for me
to change my way of living.

1692
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:29,045
You know, Jack, when a man
gets to be — gets to be 60...

1693
01:40:29,156 --> 01:40:32,057
the blood doesn't flow
as fast anymore.

1694
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:36,926
Instead of a wild mountain stream,
it becomes a quiet little brook.

1695
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:41,297
The other day, when I was sitting here all alone,
you know what I felt like doing?

1696
01:40:41,402 --> 01:40:43,870
- What?
- I felt like I wanted to sit...

1697
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:46,098
in a nice, comfortable chair...

1698
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:48,197
and read and read and read.

1699
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:52,642
Well, why didn't you? The library is full of books,
and I'm sure you haven't read one of them.

1700
01:40:52,746 --> 01:40:56,113
Jack, the eyes can't take it anymore.

1701
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:59,811
Why don't you go to an oculist?

1702
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,514
Uh, yes...

1703
01:41:02,623 --> 01:41:04,523
that might do.

1704
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:07,389
Yes, that might do.

1705
01:41:07,494 --> 01:41:09,462
But, uh...

1706
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:11,463
on the other hand...

1707
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:15,501
what do you think of the idea
of having, well, some kind of reader?

1708
01:41:15,602 --> 01:41:18,628
You know, someone with
a pleasant voice, nice diction.

1709
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:22,937
I know just what you want. You mean one of
those nice, quiet fellows from Yale or Harvard.

1710
01:41:23,043 --> 01:41:25,273
Oh, they're easy to get.

1711
01:41:25,379 --> 01:41:28,280
- Now, who is she?
- Jack, you have the most suspicious mind.

1712
01:41:28,382 --> 01:41:30,475
Come on.
How old is she?

1713
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:33,747
Well, uh, she's an unusually adult
young woman.

1714
01:41:33,854 --> 01:41:36,254
I met her at old Wilson Weatherby's.
She was <i>his</i> reader.

1715
01:41:36,356 --> 01:41:39,519
Hmm. The whole thing
sounds a little fishy to me.

1716
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:44,086
Now, Jack, why do you want to deprive
your old father of a little cultural pleasure?

1717
01:41:44,198 --> 01:41:47,099
I can think of nothing
more dignified and homelike...

1718
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:50,932
than sitting in front of a fireplace
and having someone read a fine book to me.

1719
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:52,938
Something worthwhile.

1720
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,667
Something —

1721
01:42:41,088 --> 01:42:45,218
Father, her last thought
was that you should be happy.

1722
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:47,885
I promised her I'd see to it.

1723
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:52,625
So, if you want this young lady to read to you,
go ahead with my blessing.

1724
01:42:54,101 --> 01:42:56,228
No, I couldn't do it.

1725
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:58,236
When a man gets to be 60,
his life —

1726
01:42:58,338 --> 01:43:00,238
Isn't over, Father.

1727
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:02,240
Doesn't have to be over.

1728
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:06,073
If a man is lonely
and he feels that he needs, well —

1729
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,080
You mean, the feminine touch?

1730
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,241
That's natural.

1731
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:13,751
But I think he should find someone
closer to his own age.

1732
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:15,754
Maybe.

1733
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:18,416
Not a girl of, uh —

1734
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:20,425
Twenty-four.

1735
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:23,724
Well, that is a little
out of proportion.

1736
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:25,730
I'm afraid so.

1737
01:43:25,832 --> 01:43:28,232
But if, on the other hand,
he should meet a cultured woman of—

1738
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:30,235
Right.
Someone with real dignity?

1739
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:32,237
A woman of about 50 or 51.

1740
01:43:32,339 --> 01:43:34,739
Or 52 or 53, or even 55.

1741
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:36,968
That's more like it.

1742
01:43:37,077 --> 01:43:39,910
Jack, my future
looks pretty depressing.

1743
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:44,417
Mr. Van Cleve,
you're wanted on the telephone, sir.

1744
01:43:47,721 --> 01:43:49,621
Hello.

1745
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:51,953
What?

1746
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:54,186
Oh, uh, just a moment.

1747
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:01,197
It's for you, "poochie."

1748
01:44:08,775 --> 01:44:12,677
<i>[Henry Narrating] As a man grows older,</i>
<i>his medicine cabinet grows bigger.</i>

1749
01:44:12,779 --> 01:44:14,747
<i>This is me at 70.</i>

1750
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:25,891
Now, really, there's nothing to worry about.
But, Mrs. Van Cleve, please —

1751
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:28,894
I know, but it was
his 70th birthday yesterday...

1752
01:44:28,996 --> 01:44:31,897
and I didn't have the heart to keep him
from celebrating a little.

1753
01:44:31,999 --> 01:44:34,900
I hate to go to that banquet
and leave the old man alone.

1754
01:44:35,002 --> 01:44:37,903
- I'd just as soon stay home.
- No, it's perfectly all right for you to go.

1755
01:44:38,005 --> 01:44:40,974
In fact, the fewer people around him,
the better off he'll be.

1756
01:44:57,724 --> 01:45:01,455
Now, Mr. Van Cleve, I'm sorry to wake you up,
but it has to be done.

1757
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:04,621
[Muttering]
Oh, if I could just —

1758
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:07,131
[Continues Muttering]

1759
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:13,238
[Groans]

1760
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:17,037
- Now, open your mouth, please.
- Oh, go away. Go away and leave me alone.

1761
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:19,612
[Groaning]

1762
01:45:21,281 --> 01:45:25,183
What was that dream all about?
Oh, I was having such a good time.

1763
01:45:25,285 --> 01:45:28,550
- Just open your mouth.
- What was that all about?

1764
01:45:29,656 --> 01:45:32,216
Oh, yes.

1765
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:36,092
The door opened
and a man stepped out of a rowboat.

1766
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:39,658
He said, "Henry...

1767
01:45:39,766 --> 01:45:42,929
I've come to take you on a trip
from which you'll never come back."

1768
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:44,936
Now, please, don't get excited.

1769
01:45:45,038 --> 01:45:47,336
And I said, "My good fellow...

1770
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:51,002
"if I ever take a trip like that,
it'll be in a deluxe cabin...

1771
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:54,444
and not in a dinky little rowboat
that doesn't even have a bar."

1772
01:45:54,548 --> 01:45:56,448
So I threw him out,
rowboat and all.

1773
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:58,450
Good. Good.

1774
01:45:58,552 --> 01:46:00,679
And what do you think he did?

1775
01:46:00,787 --> 01:46:04,985
He came back with a big luxury liner...

1776
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:09,826
floating on an ocean
of whiskey and soda.

1777
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,189
And instead of funnels...

1778
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:16,963
there were big, black cigars.

1779
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:19,971
And on top of the bar,
sitting in a lifeboat...

1780
01:46:20,073 --> 01:46:23,668
was the most beautiful blonde...

1781
01:46:23,777 --> 01:46:26,610
wearing a Merry Widow costume.

1782
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:30,945
She dived into the whiskey
and swam right over to my bedside.

1783
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,951
"Henry," she said...

1784
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:35,453
"how about a little dance?"

1785
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:39,116
And the man from the boat
took an accordion out of his pocket...

1786
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:41,126
and he played...

1787
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:43,526
"The Merry Widow Waltz."

1788
01:46:44,798 --> 01:46:47,426
The girl held her arms out to me...

1789
01:46:47,534 --> 01:46:49,559
and she started to dance.

1790
01:46:50,904 --> 01:46:52,804
Well...

1791
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:55,807
with him playing and her dancing...

1792
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:59,310
and me up to my neck in whiskey anyhow...

1793
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:03,873
well, I put my arms
around that beautiful girl...

1794
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:08,479
and was just about to dance with her...

1795
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,113
when, of all people, you cut in.

1796
01:47:11,224 --> 01:47:13,385
You. Yes, you.

1797
01:47:13,493 --> 01:47:17,293
- Just open your mouth.
- Go away, and take that thermometer with you.

1798
01:47:17,397 --> 01:47:19,957
[Moans]

1799
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:22,034
<i>[Knocking]</i>

1800
01:47:32,846 --> 01:47:36,145
- The night nurse has just arrived.
- All right.

1801
01:47:57,671 --> 01:47:59,571
<i>- [Nurse] Good evening.</i>
<i>- [Night Nurse] Hello.</i>

1802
01:47:59,673 --> 01:48:01,641
<i>- First door to the right.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1803
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:53,258
[Henry Sighs]

1804
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,419
I'd fallen asleep...

1805
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:59,124
and suddenly I was awakened by
a caressing touch on my forehead.

1806
01:48:59,232 --> 01:49:04,636
I opened my eyes and there she was,
sitting right on the edge of the bed.

1807
01:49:04,738 --> 01:49:08,196
Nellie Brown, Registered Nurse.

1808
01:49:08,308 --> 01:49:10,435
Your Excellency...

1809
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:14,173
one look at her and it didn't matter
whether she was registered or not.

1810
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:18,844
Then she took out a thermometer...

1811
01:49:18,952 --> 01:49:21,512
and she said, "Open your mouth."

1812
01:49:22,722 --> 01:49:24,883
Who wouldn't for Nellie?

1813
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:28,256
And then she put the thermometer in...

1814
01:49:28,361 --> 01:49:32,491
and my temperature went up to 110.

1815
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:36,830
Who could ask for
a more beautiful death?

1816
01:49:40,006 --> 01:49:41,906
[Sighs]

1817
01:49:42,008 --> 01:49:45,569
Your Excellency,
that's the story of my life...

1818
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,809
and I'd be grateful if you'd push the button
and have it over with.

1819
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:52,146
No.

1820
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:54,880
Definitely no.

1821
01:49:54,988 --> 01:49:58,355
I hope you will not consider me
inhospitable if I say...

1822
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:02,417
sorry, Mr. Van Cleve, but we don't cater
to your class of people here.

1823
01:50:03,463 --> 01:50:05,488
Please make your reservation
somewhere else.

1824
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,499
Somewhere else?

1825
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:11,662
But, Your Excellency, if I walk
into the lobby of the other place —

1826
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:14,672
You mean, above?

1827
01:50:14,774 --> 01:50:17,265
Yes.
I know what will happen.

1828
01:50:17,377 --> 01:50:19,811
They might not even let me register.

1829
01:50:19,913 --> 01:50:22,143
The doorman might not even let me in.

1830
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:25,979
Well, you never can tell.
It's worth trying.

1831
01:50:27,053 --> 01:50:30,682
Sometimes they have
a small room vacant in the annex.

1832
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:34,021
Not exactly on the sunny side...

1833
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:36,789
and not so very comfortable.

1834
01:50:36,896 --> 01:50:39,057
The bed may be hard...

1835
01:50:39,165 --> 01:50:43,067
and you might have to wait a few hundred years
until they move you into the main building.

1836
01:50:43,169 --> 01:50:45,569
Well, it doesn't hurt to try.

1837
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:49,540
After all, they may inquire about you
among the residents in the main building.

1838
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:53,044
I think you'll find a lot of people who will
give you a good reference, and that always helps.

1839
01:50:53,146 --> 01:50:55,046
For instance, there were...

1840
01:50:55,148 --> 01:50:57,548
several young ladies.

1841
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:01,348
- What about them?
- Well, some of them might be there.

1842
01:51:01,454 --> 01:51:04,582
And so far as I can see,
you've made them all very happy.

1843
01:51:04,691 --> 01:51:06,591
Oh.

1844
01:51:06,693 --> 01:51:09,127
I'm sure they'd like
to see you happy too.

1845
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:12,562
And your grandfather.

1846
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:15,567
Oh, yes. Grandfather.

1847
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:18,729
Don't you think
he'll be waiting for you?

1848
01:51:18,838 --> 01:51:21,068
- He might.
- He will.

1849
01:51:21,174 --> 01:51:24,337
- And not with a baseball bat.
- Hmm.

1850
01:51:24,444 --> 01:51:28,505
And if they all should fail,
there's still someone else.

1851
01:51:30,717 --> 01:51:33,015
Yes.

1852
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,019
She's up there.

1853
01:51:35,121 --> 01:51:37,715
And she will plead for you.

1854
01:51:37,824 --> 01:51:39,792
Do you think so?

1855
01:51:40,894 --> 01:51:42,862
You know she will.

1856
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:46,323
Yes, Mr. Van Cleve...

1857
01:51:46,433 --> 01:51:50,267
I would say you have a chance —
a very good chance.

1858
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:52,338
Anyway, it's worth trying.

1859
01:51:57,343 --> 01:52:00,574
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Your Excellency.

1860
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,648
- And thank you.
- Good luck.

1861
01:52:03,817 --> 01:52:05,785
I'll need it.

1862
01:52:09,489 --> 01:52:11,457
Down?

1863
01:52:12,759 --> 01:52:14,659
No.

1864
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:16,388
Up.
