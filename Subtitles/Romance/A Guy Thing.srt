1
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,294
All right, guys. Quiet down.

2
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,963
Kill it.

3
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,931
All right,
l'd like to propose a toast.

4
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,292
To the three rings of marriage.

5
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,440
There's the engagement ring.

6
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,413
There's the wedding ring.

7
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,381
And there's suffering!

8
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,650
To Paul!

9
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,587
Thank you.

10
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,317
Drink! Drink! Drink!

11
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,275
Come on, man.
Loosen up a little.

12
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,609
l'm the uptight lawyer...

13
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:19,312
but you were always
the crazy one in the family.

14
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:22,482
-l know.
-Relax and have fun.

15
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,850
My bachelor party...

16
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,753
was the last good time
in my marriage.

17
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,555
Maybe your marriage
didn't work...

18
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,757
because you had too much fun
at the bachelor party.

19
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,827
lt didn't work because Deena
was impossible to please.

20
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,096
Your marriage will be fine.
You've got Karen.

21
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,899
And she's beautiful.
Smart. Funny.

22
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,903
She's kind to animals.

23
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,505
She's very, very sexy.

24
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,441
She's got
a great sense of style.

25
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,143
-Pete.
-Yeah?

26
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,509
l'm just a big fan.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,082
l can't believe my little
brother's getting married.

28
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,852
l got to run. l love you.

29
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,843
OK. Hey!

30
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,117
You are a lucky, lucky man.

31
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,495
Paul, up high!

32
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,307
Good luck in there.
Congratulations.

33
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,207
Thanks.

34
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,351
Listen, Jim, about the girls...

35
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,080
l'm not sure.

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,260
-l totally understand, dude.
-You do?

37
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,594
-Absolutely.
-Good.

38
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,696
And l want you
to know something, man.

39
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,932
l don't give a shit.

40
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,935
-You be the groom.
-That's not how it works.

41
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,703
Hang on a second.
l'm giving you a chance...

42
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,906
to be the groom
at a bachelor party...

43
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,608
and you don't have
to get married next Saturday.

44
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,701
Think about that.

45
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,652
Listen up, everybody.

46
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,679
As of this moment,
l am the groom.

47
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,621
We got tiki girls!

48
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,820
Where's the groom?

49
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,236
Sorry.

50
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,984
You really suck at this.

51
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,885
Yeah. lt's my first day.

52
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,921
Would you buy me a beer?

53
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,115
Yeah.

54
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,181
Jimmy.

55
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,503
-Hello?
-Hi, Paul.

56
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,638
Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

57
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,107
l'm going to be
your mother-in-law.

58
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,975
Call me Sandra.

59
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,379
-Hi, Sandra.
-How was the bachelor party?

60
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,814
You know, silly.

61
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,783
lt's really
such an outdated ritual.

62
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,219
You are
every mother-in-law's dream.

63
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,054
Can you put Karen on for me?

64
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,181
Sure. Hold on.

65
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,961
Oh, my God.

66
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,464
What is it?
ls something the matter?

67
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,234
l guess Karen
hasn't arrived yet.

68
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,069
What do you mean?

69
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,838
She's on her way over.
She should be there by now.

70
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,707
Nope. Not here yet.

71
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,209
Sandra, l have to get going.

72
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,712
Could you please have her--

73
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,771
Holy shit.

74
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,683
Miss? Ma'am?

75
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,391
-Hey.
-You have to leave now.

76
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,094
Good morning to you, too.

77
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,364
l'm not a rude guy,
but you have to go now!

78
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,399
OK, l'm going.

79
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,003
My fiancée
is on her way over here.

80
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,538
You're getting married?

81
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,407
Only if you leave
really, really soon.

82
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,710
You weren't the guy
with the groom hat on.

83
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,180
l'd love to explain,
but you have to leave.

84
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,714
l'm going
to get my ass kicked.

85
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,773
That is very clear.

86
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,226
What happened?

87
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,727
OK, let's go.

88
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,596
Bad news.
l can't find my underwear.

89
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,164
Can l mail them to you?

90
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,233
Yes, please.
They're my only pair.

91
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,901
Give me your address.

92
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,204
l have more than
one pair of underwear.

93
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,740
l'll find them
before she gets here.

94
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,010
Calm down.
lf you're freaking out...

95
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,580
when your fiancée gets here,
you'll freak her out.

96
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,715
You're freaking me out,
and l don't even know you.

97
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,150
Just be cool.

98
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,652
l'm a very cool guy.

99
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,422
Cooler than most of the guys
you probably meet.

100
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,458
No offense. This is just
a bad situation for me.

101
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,826
Trust me. l'm not this guy.

102
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,851
After you.

103
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,141
lf you see a pair of
bikini underwear lying around...

104
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,776
see this guy.

105
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,006
Could you not say that, please?

106
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,349
Can you do me a favor
and take the back stairs?

107
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,452
ln case l had any speck
of self-esteem left?

108
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,988
l bet that goes over well
with the ladies.

109
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,357
There are no ladies,
all right?

110
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,460
-Right.
-lt's actually...

111
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,495
Thank you, Mrs. Jackson.

112
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,297
Aloha.

113
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,197
Wedding planner.

114
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,008
We were thinking of going
with the whole luau thing.

115
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,407
Good day.

116
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,244
Shit!

117
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,984
Not there. God!

118
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,035
Shit.

119
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,615
Could you undo the chain?

120
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,776
One second!

121
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,679
Paul! What's going on?

122
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:59,193
Please undo the chain.
l am standing out here.

123
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,468
Paul, are you OK?

124
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,940
Karen, sweetheart,
what a surprise.

125
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,642
Why'd you chain the door shut?

126
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,345
You can't be too safe.

127
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,881
How was the bachelor party?
Hung over?

128
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,516
Not at all.

129
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,186
l know what happens
at these things...

130
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,054
and you should not
feel guilty...

131
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,057
and you don't
have to tell me anything.

132
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,894
Unless there's something
you want to tell me.

133
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,631
Don't leave!
Let me explain!

134
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,895
Shut up!

135
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,605
Maybe l had a drink or two.

136
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,472
Yeah. l'm sure
you kept it to two.

137
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,578
OK, look.

138
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,615
l got all your outfits
for the parties this week.

139
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,150
This...

140
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,285
Wow. That's a nice sweater.

141
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,754
And you like?

142
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,088
l like.

143
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,457
l thought it would be perfect
for the rehearsal dinner.

144
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,161
-Perfect.
-l knew you'd like it.

145
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,597
How is the string quartet
coming along?

146
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,532
l'm on it.

147
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,668
lt is the one thing...

148
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,237
l have asked you to do
for this wedding.

149
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:17,005
Yeah. lt's basically
almost completely...

150
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,681
taken care of.

151
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,749
How was the bachelorette party?

152
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,051
Oh, my God. A total blast.

153
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,253
We went to Giggles,
and sat in front...

154
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,321
and heckled the comedians.

155
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,458
Jody got so wasted!

156
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,760
Hello? Earth to Paul.

157
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,762
Over here,
you big party animal.

158
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,864
How about a kiss
for that hangover?

159
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,229
All right.

160
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,310
What are you--

161
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,114
What are you--OK.
l have a million things to do.

162
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,116
My Great Aunt Budge
is coming in tomorrow.

163
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,218
My mom is
completely freaked out.

164
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,888
Your mom called...this morning.

165
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,790
She did?

166
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,027
Did she tell you
l was coming over?

167
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,629
Then why were you
so surprised to see me?

168
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,326
l might be more hung over
than l thought.

169
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,405
You're a weirdo.

170
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,396
Oh, my God.
l have a million things to do.

171
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,951
Oh, God.

172
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,091
What the hell happened last
night? Where were you?

173
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,219
Sorry, chief.
l got waylaid.

174
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,533
lf you know what l'm saying--
way laid.

175
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,436
-What?
-That tiki girl Tonya.

176
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,972
l kept trying
to turn off the charm...

177
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,040
but l guess
l couldn't find the switch.

178
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,509
You're not listening to me.

179
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,011
l woke up this morning
with a strange woman in my bed.

180
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,447
How could this happen?
Was l that drunk?

181
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,851
That's awesome!
What are you complaining about?

182
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,954
-What?
-Nice shoes.

183
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,190
Karen got them.
She wants me to break them in.

184
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,192
They're special.

185
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,921
Move.

186
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,764
l got to tell Karen.

187
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,433
Paul, listen to me.

188
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,371
Do not under
any circumstances tell Karen.

189
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,773
What happened last night
is perfectly natural.

190
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,576
We're men. We're hunters.

191
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,612
lt's encrypted in our DNA code.

192
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,383
You got to accept that.
Get over it.

193
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,118
l don't know what
l'm going to do.

194
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,888
Hi, Jim.
lt's Tonya from last night.

195
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,623
l was going to be
in the neighborhood later...

196
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,327
and thought l might stop by,
so give me a call.

197
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,692
Shit.

198
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,434
That poor girl's been Jim-ified.

199
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,303
This is all your fault, man.

200
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,038
Probably...

201
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,841
but Karen's
never going to find out.

202
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,910
And that tiki girl?

203
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,612
Come on.

204
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,671
You'll never see her again.

205
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,019
A survey was made one time
that covered a lot of men--

206
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,356
working men--and these men
were asked this question--

207
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,557
Why do you work?

208
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,159
Why do you get up
in the morning?

209
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,162
Why? Everyone goes to work
in the morning.

210
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,663
And that's the reason
they do it...

211
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,866
because everyone else
is doing it.

212
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,901
And there you have
the trouble today.

213
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,636
lt's conformity--

214
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,405
people acting like everyone else
without knowing why...

215
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,607
or where they're going.

216
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,675
We'll have more with Dr. Earl...

217
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,878
after this short break
on KCNP...

218
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,812
the best talk in Seattle.

219
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,688
-Hi!
-Holy shit!

220
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,523
-You work here?
-First day.

221
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,725
What happened to the dancing?

222
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,994
l sucked.

223
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,464
Hey! Let's go, asshole!

224
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,634
Just a sec. Sorry.

225
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,369
Listen, what's your name?

226
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,171
Bec--Hey!

227
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,741
Don't make me
get out of my box, fella!

228
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,042
Fifty cents.

229
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,044
l want you to know,
about what happened--

230
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:16,140
Have a good day.
Remember to drive safely.

231
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,418
Sorry!

232
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,887
-lt's hitting the--
-l know!

233
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:26,258
Look what you--
You dented the hood of my car!

234
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,557
-Hang on!
-Good to see you.

235
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,231
Stop!

236
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,199
That's her.

237
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,456
l'm a little disturbed
about something, Paul.

238
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,758
What's that, sir?

239
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,694
You had a bachelor party?

240
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:05,130
l--lt's totally--
lt's--l--

241
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,399
l may be
your bride-to-be's father...

242
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,698
but l'm still a man. Huh?

243
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,440
You sick son of a bitch!

244
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,534
-l'll kill you!
-You're choking me!

245
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,448
No, it was pretty uneventful.

246
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,249
We watched
hours of action movies...

247
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,819
and talked about high school.

248
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,988
lt was a hoot.

249
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,992
Good answer. That's my boy.

250
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,295
You like that, huh?

251
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,330
l know what you're thinking.

252
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,867
lt's the good life--
like you see on TV.

253
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,770
''That could never happen to me.''

254
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,271
You've made it, son.

255
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,273
You're one of us. Enjoy.

256
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,400
Welcome to the club.

257
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,112
Thank you.

258
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,150
Boys, let's get started.

259
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,119
l've been in this business
a long time...

260
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:04,023
and if we get ''Modern Rifleman''
up to 750,000...

261
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,617
l'll strip down to my shorts
and jump in the ocean.

262
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:10,996
My question is...

263
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,398
once you've stripped down
to your shorts...

264
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,525
will you actually
loosen your tie?

265
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,131
Have l fired you today, Curt?

266
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,475
Enough frivolity.
Let's get down to business.

267
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,023
-Paul?
-Yeah?

268
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,525
Tell us how
the ad campaign looks...

269
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,326
for ''North American
River and Stream.''

270
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,797
Pretty good, sir.
l'm projecting--

271
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,665
Why don't you get up there
and talk to us?

272
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,601
Make a presentation.
Take over the room.

273
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,367
Hooking us is half the battle.
Still got to reel us in.

274
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,848
OK...

275
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,887
lt's a good news,
bad news situation.

276
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,835
The good news is...

277
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:26,939
we've had steady growth
over the last six months.

278
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,736
-Nice.
-Good.

279
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,570
Just give me a second here.

280
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,886
Do you mind if l take
a quick restroom break?

281
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,764
No. Go ahead.

282
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:56,200
Great. Be right back.

283
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,667
Looks like you're getting
a weak bladder in the family.

284
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,611
Oh, my God, it burns!

285
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,847
What is it?

286
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,218
What...?

287
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,652
Jesus Christ!

288
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,657
Ted. Hey.

289
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,663
God damn it.

290
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,020
Thank you.

291
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,621
Hello.

292
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,918
What can l do for you?

293
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,962
l need to get
some crab medicine.

294
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,131
What?

295
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,366
Crab medicine.

296
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,336
-l don't--
-You know...

297
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,639
Crab medicine.

298
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,005
Let me see.
Crab medicine.

299
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,648
-Gladys!
-What?

300
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,318
ls crab medicine
Aisle 3 or Aisle 4?

301
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,986
Crab medicine?

302
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,287
Crab medicine!

303
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,156
Crab medicine!

304
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,191
-Yeah!
-Aisle 3!

305
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,716
l'll get it. Thanks.
Excuse me.

306
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,671
Here you go. Good luck.

307
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,174
Are there special directions
for this stuff?

308
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:47,079
l don't know.
Let me ask Phil.

309
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,014
Phil, this crab stuff--

310
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,917
ls there any special
application technique, sir?

311
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,486
He wants to see it.

312
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,988
Paul!

313
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,024
My future son-in-law.
l thought that was you.

314
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,292
What a nice surprise.

315
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,960
Sandra, hi.

316
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,896
Small world.
What brings you here?

317
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,332
Actually,
l forgot something in...

318
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,202
l am so relieved
that your mother decided...

319
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,970
not to cook
the rehearsal dinner.

320
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,639
l'm not saying
anything about her cooking.

321
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,841
lt's a really big job.

322
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,310
That reminds me. l've got
to help her find a caterer.

323
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,379
There's my guy.

324
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,581
You almost left
without your stuff.

325
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,016
Now, about those crabs--

326
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,952
They were delicious.

327
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,022
Jeff is an incredible chef.

328
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,891
He gave me a recipe for...

329
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,027
Crab Louie that was
out of this world.

330
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,362
-Really?
-Yeah. What?

331
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,364
You're a chef?

332
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,932
Yes, l am.

333
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,235
l'm putting myself
through cooking school...

334
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:47,039
working the pharmacy thing.

335
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,273
lsn't that wonderful?

336
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,641
ls there a chance
you might be able...

337
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,609
to cook dinner
for 20 people on Friday?

338
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,737
lt's a rehearsal dinner
for Paul and my daughter.

339
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,218
Wow, l'm honored--

340
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,255
-l can only pay $500.
-Done.

341
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,724
-Wonderful.
-lncredible.

342
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,522
That was easy. Thank you.

343
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,370
Bucky, come on.

344
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,748
These are going
to be our in-laws...

345
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,250
so we really have
to make sure that--

346
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,720
Honey, l'm a pants salesman.

347
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,855
l know how
to act around people.

348
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,657
l can sell pants.

349
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,026
Give your gift, baby.

350
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,761
l like me inside.

351
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,196
-Yes.
-Yeah.

352
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,461
Buck, Dorothy, welcome.

353
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,204
-l'm so sorry we're late.
-You're fine.

354
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,606
-Hi, Buck.
-How are you?

355
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,174
Nice area
you got up here, Kenny.

356
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,609
Yeah, we like it.

357
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,845
Yeah. New Benz, l see.

358
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,947
Must have gotten
ripped off on that thing.

359
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,648
l don't think so.
l looked around.

360
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,985
Just joshing, Ken.
Fine vehicle.

361
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,520
Hi, Dorothy. Hi, Buck.

362
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,822
There she is.

363
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,059
-Hi.
-What a beauty.

364
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,361
What is that waist--
20 inches?

365
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,896
Excuse me?

366
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,632
Where's the groom-to-be?

367
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,134
He's not here yet.

368
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,836
You know Paul.
He always comes a little late.

369
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,827
What do you think of that?

370
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,972
Why don't l get us all a drink?

371
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,982
We've already had a six-pack.

372
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,382
We split that on the way up.

373
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,954
Hors d'oeuvres, sir?

374
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,457
Look at the size
of these shrimps.

375
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,691
Prawns.

376
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,693
-There you go, sugar.
-Oh, sweetheart.

377
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:49,928
Ma'am?

378
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,931
-Hello.
-Paul's finally here.

379
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,699
Sorry l'm late.

380
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,268
l was telling
your mother about...

381
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,970
the chef l hired to cater
the rehearsal dinner.

382
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,540
A pharmacist
studying to be a chef--

383
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,708
that is really interesting.

384
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,411
There's a very special lady
in the kitchen...

385
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,747
who can't wait
to lay her eyes on you.

386
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,682
Let's go find Aunt Budge.

387
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,884
l can't wait for you
to meet her.

388
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,086
They are so cute.

389
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,055
Yeah, they're cute.

390
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,225
Buck, are you a duffer?

391
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,862
lf you mean, do l like
playing with my balls...

392
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,454
the answer's yes.

393
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,701
You know what l mean,
don't you?

394
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:30,998
Oh, shit.

395
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,264
There's Budge,
talking to my cousin Becky.

396
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,278
Oh, my God.

397
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:44,078
Aunt Budge, this is Paul.

398
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,720
-He's bald.
-Paul?

399
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,792
Oh, God!

400
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,595
l'm so sorry, Becky.
lt is so good to see you.

401
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,256
You look beautiful.

402
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,335
How's life after Ray?

403
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,872
Great.
Best decision l ever made.

404
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,508
You know,
you are probably right.

405
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,277
But it is nice to have someone
to come home to.

406
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,646
Oh, God. Sorry.

407
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,448
No. lt's especially
nice to come home...

408
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,416
to that someone
in bed with two girls.

409
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,952
Two girls with one man--
Oh, trust me!

410
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,021
You never walk away satisfied.

411
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:27,993
Reminds me of the time
me and Kathleen O'Rourke...

412
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,327
who was a bit of a tart--

413
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,964
l'll see where Paul is.

414
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,733
We were down
at the pub celebrating--

415
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,035
-Give me some, will you?
-Oh, no.

416
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,061
-Just a little bit.
-lt's my wine.

417
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,437
Paul? Where'd you go?

418
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,058
What are you doing?

419
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,073
Karen? Hey...

420
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,508
You're asleep?

421
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,344
l guess so.
l lost you somehow.

422
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,379
l got disoriented.

423
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,549
This is really weird.
Why did you just--

424
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,385
OK. The truth is...

425
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,721
l was gonna pop out
and surprise you.

426
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,223
The old
''under the coats'' routine.

427
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,226
But while l was laying here...

428
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,093
it was so warm, l dozed off.

429
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,701
Never mind.
Let's go meet Aunt Budge.

430
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,539
Becky, l found him.
He's up here.

431
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:04,022
l'll just get my purse.

432
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,616
He exists. l swear.

433
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,467
l know you're in there.

434
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,735
Yeah?

435
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,370
What is wrong?

436
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,201
lt's diarrhea.

437
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,875
Oh, no.

438
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,178
Maybe l should just wait here.

439
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:31,583
Stick it out--
Or maybe l should just leave.

440
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:35,387
No! You can't leave.
You haven't met Aunt Budge.

441
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:40,258
Why don't you wait
and see how you feel in a bit?

442
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,691
OK.

443
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:48,225
Everyone, find your names
and sit down.

444
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,238
l guess we'll sit here.

445
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,974
A lot of fabric's overrated.

446
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,161
l'll drink to that, Bucky.
Where's the drinks?

447
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,330
Sweetie, grab it.

448
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,165
Oh, no. Hey, everyone!

449
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,360
l'd like to make a toast.

450
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,174
Here's to Karen,
the bride-to-be.

451
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,143
Oh, gosh. Thanks, Becky.

452
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,361
That's my car!

453
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,919
Come on, Buck.

454
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,496
Everybody stay back.

455
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,381
Nobody touch anything.
Don't disturb the crime scene.

456
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,617
This isn't a crime scene.

457
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,352
There's your culprit, Daddy.

458
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:51,723
lt might be a raccoon.
l'll get my salt gun.

459
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:55,352
l'll check on Paul.
l hope he's feeling better.

460
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,196
Pretty exciting, huh?

461
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,738
Paul?

462
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,139
Yeah.

463
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,573
Paul, honey, it's Mom!

464
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:16,381
Did you eat something spicy?
You know how you get.

465
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,117
l got you in my sights.

466
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,920
How'd you like a little
rock salt up your ass?

467
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,683
Holy shit!

468
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,825
Are you all right?

469
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,661
l'm fine!

470
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,096
Honey, just let it come out.

471
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,265
Don't push so hard.

472
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,135
lt's almost there.

473
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,470
-Oh, my God.
-lt's bad.

474
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,139
What's going on up here?

475
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,267
-Paul's not feeling well.
-Stuck on the crapper?

476
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,245
Yeah! Do you think
l can get some...

477
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,078
...privacy, please?

478
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,914
Better.

479
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,961
How about some
peach cobbler, everybody?

480
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,231
l'd kill for some diarrhea.

481
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,928
l haven't had
a bowel movement in 14 days.

482
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,740
We'll see you guys in a bit.

483
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,010
-Better hide the silver.
-l'll walk you to your car.

484
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,679
l'm so disappointed
that you didn't see Paul.

485
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,081
l'll meet Paul later this week.

486
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,484
Definitely.
l'm so sorry about all this.

487
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,281
-Good night.
-Good night, Becky.

488
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,658
How are you feeling?

489
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,728
OK, l guess.
ls everyone gone?

490
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,264
You missed the whole party.

491
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,325
Too bad.
l'm starting to feel better.

492
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,611
lt's better you get sick now
than on Saturday.

493
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,879
That's exactly right.

494
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,081
l just hope
it's out of my system now.

495
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,017
Typical. Forgot my purse.

496
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,219
Becky! Here he is!

497
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,450
This is Paul,
my husband-to-be.

498
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,790
Hi, Becky. Nice to meet you.

499
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,199
So nice to meet you, Paul.

500
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,068
l've heard so much about you.

501
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,866
All lies, l'm sure.

502
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,306
Probably.

503
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,212
You look so familiar.

504
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,216
l get that all the time.

505
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,924
Right?

506
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,861
-You do?
-Yeah.

507
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:48,566
l'll see you this weekend.

508
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,898
Can't wait. OK.

509
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,999
Nice to meet you.

510
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,047
So that's Cousin Becky?

511
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,316
Yeah.
She's gotten so weird.

512
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,553
No, that's mean.
She's so all over the place.

513
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,221
One week
she's working here...

514
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,889
the next week,
she's working there.

515
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:16,527
Now she's working at some
record store on Broad Street.

516
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,429
l do feel sorry for her, though.

517
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,630
How come?

518
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,565
Her ex-boyfriend, Ray Donovan.
What a psycho.

519
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,572
lt's amazing how fragile
the human body is.

520
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,408
-Don't you think?
-Yes, sir.

521
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,976
Shut the fuck up!

522
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,146
Come on, Ray.
Guy just stole a doughnut.

523
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,547
That's where it starts, Ernie!

524
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,411
How you doing?

525
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,862
Well, hello, fellas.

526
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,022
Ray.

527
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,926
Special delivery.

528
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,075
That's a little disheartening.

529
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,082
No, no, no!

530
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,950
You did not sleep
with her cousin.

531
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,719
l didn't know
she was her cousin.

532
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,722
Why would you sleep with anyone?

533
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,893
When you have Karen,
who's so stunning...

534
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,196
and witty and delectable...

535
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,698
and has
those little dimples...

536
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,401
-Pete.
-What? You are a moron!

537
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,337
How is it? ls it smoking?

538
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:34,906
lf you don't love it...

539
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,642
l have double-breasted white one
sitting on the runway.

540
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,710
Talk about a burning-hot look!

541
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,380
Ahmed, that's fine.
This is great.

542
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,348
-Thanks.
-Word.

543
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:52,090
Anyway, she was cool about it.

544
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,489
Was she drunk?

545
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,229
-What do you mean?
-Wait till she's drunk.

546
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,764
Next Thanksgiving or Christmas.

547
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,365
This Saturday
at your wedding...

548
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,834
after she's had
four gin and tonics...

549
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,569
and she steps up
to the microphone...

550
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:05,903
and tells the whole world.

551
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,271
That's not gonna happen.

552
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,940
''Everyone,
your attention please.

553
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,274
''l think you should know...

554
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,776
''that Karen's husband Paul
nailed me last Saturday.

555
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,912
''We had hot sex
and l'm carrying his child.

556
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,882
''Thank you for listening.
Please return to your entrees.''

557
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,218
That's not gonna happen.

558
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,886
How are we doing in here,
superstars?

559
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,088
Great, Ahmed! How about it?

560
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,988
l go now.

561
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,314
Right on.

562
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,403
Excuse me, sir?

563
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,236
There's nothing for you
in that stack.

564
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,942
Let me help you with that.

565
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,311
No, l got it. lt's OK!

566
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,835
Sorry.

567
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:25,816
What does that mean...

568
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,052
''There's nothing for you
in that stack''?

569
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,986
That stuff's too advanced.

570
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,924
You're saying l'm not advanced?

571
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,194
No, l'm just saying l know where
you are musically right now...

572
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,695
and it's not in that stack.

573
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,165
Frankly, l'm not really sure
it's in this store.

574
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,502
Really? When did you
become the music expert?

575
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:48,973
Since Tuesday, Mr. Shiny Shoes.

576
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,543
Wait.
Look, l came by to--

577
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,878
Apologize
for the other night.

578
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,347
And for never mentioning that
you were marrying my cousin!

579
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,782
l didn't know. l'm sorry.

580
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,450
No, don't apologize.

581
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,718
You were amazing.

582
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,287
Well, thank you.

583
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:07,858
l don't normally sleep
with a girl and then--

584
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,594
Paul, right?

585
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,296
The funny thing is
we didn't sleep together.

586
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,967
We slept together,
but we didn't sleep together.

587
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,103
We didn't?
So l'm not amazing?

588
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,504
l couldn't say.

589
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,374
But for the record,
you were cute.

590
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,810
lf things were different
and you hadn't passed out...

591
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,180
with your pants
around your ankles, who knows?

592
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,550
lf we didn't sleep together,
how did l get crabs?

593
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,319
-You got crabs?
-You gave me crabs.

594
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,753
l do not have crabs!

595
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,859
You don't have crabs?

596
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,428
God, no.
But if l do get crabs...

597
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,731
l will hunt you down
and kill your crabby ass.

598
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,599
Then how did l get them?

599
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,965
l don't know.
Maybe a toilet seat?

600
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,039
Hey, Paul!
Congratulations, man.

601
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,472
Yeah!

602
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,644
Really, that happens?

603
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,178
We saw it a lot in the lab.

604
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,408
-The lab?
-Long story.

605
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,977
She's hot.

606
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,693
Listen, l'm just hoping...

607
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,929
We'll know each other
for the rest of our lives--

608
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,398
l won't say anything.

609
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,701
You say that now,
but what if--

610
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,537
l'm not going to screw up
what you and Karen have.

611
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,664
You are perfect for each other.

612
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,438
That's right. We are.

613
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,614
Why do you say that?

614
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,383
God, you are exhausting.

615
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:44,582
Buy this. You'll like it.
Trust me.

616
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,763
Record store?

617
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,099
l thought
she was a tiki dancer.

618
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,202
She's just so cocky,
you know?

619
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:02,139
l know music.
Come on, l see bands.

620
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,209
Why does she think she knows me?

621
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,511
She doesn't
know anything about me.

622
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,913
l'm cool.

623
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:13,017
l wear on-the-edge clothing
and hip stuff.

624
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,251
Hang on.

625
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,811
Hi, l'm Jim.

626
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,889
OK.

627
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:28,632
What's up with that clock?
lt still says 10 after 5.

628
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,931
Dude, that clock doesn't work.
Never has.

629
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,872
Asshole!

630
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,180
Yes, that's it.

631
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,796
-l'm sorry l'm late.
-Finally.

632
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,998
There was a lot of traffic.

633
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,235
This is our last lesson,
and you are 45 minutes late.

634
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,204
Look at everybody else.
They're better than us.

635
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,940
All right, let's go.

636
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,218
Sorry.

637
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:36,434
l hope everybody noticed
Karen and Paul.

638
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,461
They are a textbook example
of what not to do.

639
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,437
Karen, would you mind?

640
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,982
This shouldn't be a chore.
Have fun out there.

641
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,584
Let go. Enjoy yourself.

642
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,785
Come on, Howard.

643
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:59,123
This time, l'm Karen,
and l want to feel your joy...

644
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,126
as you fling me
around that dance floor.

645
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,961
-OK?
-OK.

646
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,364
Good. l am your lady...

647
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:10,401
and you be my man.

648
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,232
Karen, music please.

649
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,240
Prepare.

650
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,543
One, two, three...

651
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,846
Good, good.

652
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,583
Very good. That's it.

653
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:30,654
Watch the pretty lady
as she dances around.

654
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,057
And yes, and yes.

655
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,925
That's it.

656
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,561
We're flying, Paul.
Can you feel it?

657
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,396
Everybody!

658
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,888
That's it. Good.

659
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,844
That Howard...

660
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:58,449
he is so damn graceful,
isn't he?

661
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,886
He's a dance instructor.
lt's his job.

662
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,555
l just mean,
a guy with his frame...

663
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,725
you don't see it coming,
and then...

664
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:12,059
something magical happens
out on that dance floor.

665
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,098
Paul, seat belt.

666
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,071
People surprise you,
is all l'm saying.

667
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,609
Did you book the string quartet?

668
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,612
l was thinking,
maybe we should do...

669
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:31,582
something like a band.

670
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,083
String quartet?

671
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,785
l don't know if
that's really our thing.

672
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,788
A band,
playing music we like.

673
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,722
lt's a little bit lighter...

674
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:47,754
Or we could stick with
the string quartet.

675
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,472
Jump out. Chop, chop.

676
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,274
l'll go find a spot.

677
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,037
Great.

678
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,339
Hey, lollipop!

679
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,720
Whoa, easy. Breathe.

680
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,055
Just a little wind
knocked out of you.

681
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,891
There you go.
Bad news, sports fan.

682
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,393
You picked the wrong guy's girl
to fornicate with!

683
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,595
What?

684
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,497
l'm a cop,
and Becky belongs to me.

685
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,066
l think there's a mistake.

686
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:25,736
Really?
Because l had her followed...

687
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,838
and the tail came back
with these photos...

688
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,541
and those skinny arms,
concave chest...

689
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,042
kind of looks like you,
don't you think?

690
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,044
No.

691
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,341
Shit!

692
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,418
All these sugary snacks!

693
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:45,411
Would you actually put
this stuff in your body?

694
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,959
OK. All right.

695
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:54,264
You made the biggest mistake
of your life...

696
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,700
when you messed
with my girl, cupcake.

697
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:01,305
And mistakes have consequences.

698
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,933
Help! Please, somebody!

699
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,445
Hello.

700
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:12,216
Today is your lucky day.

701
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,818
Come on. Come on.

702
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,153
l don't even know you!

703
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,848
Get in.

704
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,058
Get in where?

705
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,260
The dumpster.

706
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,023
-Really?
-Yeah.

707
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,566
Just give me a second here.

708
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,235
You sicken me.

709
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:43,546
l told you,
there's a big mix-up!

710
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,359
What happened?

711
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,695
l was mugged.

712
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,197
Oh, my God.
Paul, you're bleeding.

713
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,865
What is all this stuff?

714
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,867
Chocolate milk and cheese puffs.

715
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,536
Oh, my God, Paul.

716
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,706
l don't know.
l was carrying the groceries...

717
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,709
and this guy tried
to take them from me.

718
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,210
But l fought back.

719
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,212
l fought like a tiger.

720
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,181
l had the strength of ten men.

721
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,978
He ran away like a little girl.

722
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,820
Sweet.

723
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,758
Did you get a good look at him?

724
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:31,862
Not really.
lt all happened so fast.

725
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,064
What color was his hair?

726
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,899
Red.

727
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,335
Dreaded--in a way
that l've never seen.

728
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,972
-Dreadlocks.
-And a gold tooth.

729
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,807
That is so street.

730
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,843
Size?
Was he big, tall, short?

731
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,479
Five-six.

732
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,715
Or six-two.

733
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,251
-Somewhere in there?
-Yeah.

734
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,151
Any identifying marks?

735
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:02,283
Yeah. A heinous scar.

736
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,163
Over his left eye.

737
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:09,700
Your left eye, sir,
or his left eye?

738
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,702
You're pointing to your right.

739
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:15,672
Looking at him,
his left eye or your left?

740
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,341
His left side.

741
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,244
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

742
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,546
Left eye.

743
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,715
He had a tattoo.

744
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:29,086
A barbed-wire choker tattoo.

745
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,755
Probably gang-related.

746
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,957
Gangbanger.

747
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,824
Was the assailant
Caucasian or non-Caucasian?

748
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,897
Non.

749
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,266
-Was he black?
-Not necessarily.

750
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:45,536
-What was he?
-Mix. Black, white.

751
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,805
-Black, white.
-Light-skinned black man.

752
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,640
Or a dark-skinned white man.

753
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,442
God, it must have been
so confusing.

754
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,808
Did he say anything to you?

755
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,384
Oh, God, Paul,
did he say something to you?

756
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,853
Yeah.

757
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,657
Don't keep that inside.
What did he say?

758
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,726
-He said...
-lt's OK.

759
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:14,898
''Give me those groceries,
Whitey.''

760
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,800
''Give me your groceries,
Whitey.''

761
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,001
Well...

762
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,970
But you say he could've
been white himself.

763
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,339
You did say that, sir.

764
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,574
What's going on here?

765
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:27,811
Am l on trial?
l didn't even do anything!

766
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,446
l told you
it happened all so fast.

767
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:33,083
You're safe. That's it.
l think we're done here.

768
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,819
That's it for Paul.
Good luck.

769
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,154
We're just trying
to get the facts....

770
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,522
do our job.

771
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,958
Thanks.

772
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,550
Good luck with everything.

773
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:52,102
You poor thing, sweetheart.

774
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:55,339
Just sit tight.
l'll get you some aspirin.

775
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,107
Thank you, baby.

776
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,408
l'll be interested to see...

777
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,611
if the police
come up with any leads.

778
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,480
Honey, l don't think they will.

779
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,550
A little mugging...
They have bigger fish to fry.

780
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,178
But they're good men.

781
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,555
What are these?

782
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,928
l don't know.

783
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,330
l'll tell you what they are--
women's underwear.

784
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,599
l found them
in the toilet tank.

785
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,068
The toilet tank?

786
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,969
The water was leaking,
so l went to lift the--

787
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,602
What is going on here?

788
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,985
Did you have a girl
in this apartment?

789
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:46,490
Karen! Absolutely not!

790
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,193
Those underwear are yours.

791
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,595
No, they are not.

792
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,631
They were gonna be yours.
l got them for you.

793
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:58,769
For your birthday. Enjoy.

794
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,737
My birthday
was three months ago.

795
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,072
l know.

796
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:04,341
But then l found
that locket you wanted...

797
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,176
and l gave that to you instead.

798
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,845
l wanted to give these to you
at a later date...

799
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:15,085
so l went ahead and hid them
in the toilet tank.

800
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,420
Why aren't they in a box?

801
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,922
Why aren't they in a box?

802
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:22,192
Oddly enough,
that's how they came.

803
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:25,395
l found them
in an underwear bin.

804
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:29,627
A bin? Where do they sell
underwear out of a bin?

805
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,637
Spend Mart.

806
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,039
You expect me to believe...

807
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:39,743
that you purchased
a pair of underwear...

808
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,647
out of a bin at Spend Mart.

809
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,850
ls that your story?

810
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,341
Yeah.

811
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,692
Oh, my God. These are dirty.

812
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:59,363
What? That's disgusting!

813
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:02,065
l can't believe those fuckers
sold me dirty underwear!

814
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,266
That is just wrong!

815
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,335
Now l'm really glad
l didn't give them to you.

816
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:09,239
l'm hungry.
Should we eat something?

817
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,943
Paul, listen to me.
l am not stupid.

818
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,012
Please tell me
what's going on here...

819
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,949
and l want you to be
totally honest with me.

820
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:23,283
Did you have a girl
in this apartment?

821
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:27,591
l trusted you,
you son of a bitch!

822
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,889
How do you like that?

823
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,729
No, l did not.

824
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:35,391
Fine.

825
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,436
What are you doing?

826
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:42,539
l'm calling Spend Mart.
They probably want to know...

827
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,642
that they are selling
dirty women's underwear.

828
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,444
Karen, come on,
this whole thing's silly.

829
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:50,480
l doubt they'll admit
they sell dirty underwear.

830
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,142
l'm sure
it's against corporate policy.

831
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,688
Spend Mart,
where you spend less.

832
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:04,227
l have a question
regarding your underwear bins.

833
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:08,165
Underwear bins?

834
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,833
My fiancé has informed me...

835
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,569
that he bought a pair of
dirty women's underwear...

836
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,970
out of one of your bins...

837
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,406
and l wanted to hear
your thoughts on this.

838
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:24,114
My thoughts?
On our underwear bins?

839
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:27,651
These are my thoughts.
l'm sick of it.

840
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,886
lt's some college kids
playing a prank.

841
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:32,489
They been putting
dirty underwear in our bins.

842
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,225
-What?
-What did he say?

843
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,828
On behalf of Spend Mart,
l'd like to apologize.

844
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,765
Why don't you have
your fiancé come down...

845
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,000
and we'll exchange them
for a fresh pair...

846
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,629
or refund your money. OK?

847
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,944
Poor bastard.

848
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,979
Underwear bins?

849
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,148
lt's a guy thing.

850
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:00,878
Bullshit!

851
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,056
God, l am really sorry.
l feel terrible.

852
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,657
lt's OK, honey.

853
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:10,827
l am a terrible person
for accusing you.

854
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:13,997
No, you are so honest.

855
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:17,956
l don't deserve you.
Thank you.

856
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,105
l love them.

857
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,800
l knew you would.

858
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,178
Let's just forget about it.

859
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,947
Let's pretend it never happened.

860
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:34,849
l love you, you love me,
that's all that matters.

861
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,248
One sec!

862
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,459
l got home from work...

863
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,394
and found these pictures
in my son's room.

864
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,554
He was standing over them.

865
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,435
Are we on the same page?

866
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,172
Don't speak!

867
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,574
ln the future,
would you find a way...

868
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,743
to dispose of
your pornography...

869
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:03,513
so it doesn't wind up
in the hands of children?

870
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,481
Absolutely. l apologize.

871
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,553
-Who's at the door?
-Our neighbor, Mr.--

872
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,589
Minister Ferris.

873
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,324
Mr. Minister Ferris.

874
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,826
Hello.
l'm Karen, Paul's fiancée.

875
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:21,559
Congratulations. You move
right along, don't you?

876
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:30,307
Mr. Minister Ferris stopped by
to recommend a TV special.

877
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,808
Wow, that's great.

878
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,578
Thanks for thinking of us.
We'll keep that--

879
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,739
Son...

880
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,478
l've got my eye on you.

881
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,559
OK, then.

882
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,761
That was awfully
thoughtful of him.

883
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:55,165
l think he was
checking out your crotch.

884
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,567
Karen, he's a man of the cloth.

885
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:02,172
Let's not rashly accuse him of
being some weird pecker checker.

886
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,040
l've got to go to the bathroom.

887
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,405
OK.

888
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,239
Shit.

889
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,093
Do you smell smoke?

890
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,324
OK. Oh, shit!

891
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,766
ls something burning?
l smell smoke.

892
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:33,603
l lit a match,
if you know what l mean.

893
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,403
-Do you still have diarrhea?
-Yeah, l do.

894
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,289
l tell you,
you think you got it licked...

895
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,824
it comes right back
to kick you in the butt.

896
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,893
lf this keeps up,
we'll have to plan...

897
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:59,589
our whole wedding day
around your bowel movements.

898
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,632
Hello?

899
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,429
Hey, Paul, it's Becky.

900
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,105
Jimmy boy! What's up?

901
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,973
Nothing much, Jimmy boy.

902
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:47,377
l got a visit from
my lunatic ex-fiancé.

903
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,979
He's got pictures
of us together.

904
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,382
Hey, baby!
Can l get a gin and tonic...

905
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,384
and maybe you in bed?

906
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,419
l don't know what
he'll do with them...

907
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,455
but he's got
a steroid rage problem...

908
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,256
so l'm thinking
that's not a good thing.

909
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,192
That is great news!

910
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,560
What's going on?

911
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,162
lt's Jim.
He got a promotion.

912
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,356
Wow.

913
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,001
Here's the deal.
Ray's working the night shift.

914
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:15,405
We can sneak into his apartment
and get the negatives.

915
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,374
You're the man, Jim.

916
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,008
Pick me up at 10:00
at the Soho.

917
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,577
You know where that is?

918
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,712
Great. Don't be late
and bring a flashlight.

919
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,414
Wait.
l want to congratulate Jim.

920
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,083
Six bucks?

921
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,386
l wanted to talk.

922
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,980
You did? l'm sorry.

923
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,460
Hello?
l'm so glad you called back.

924
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,829
Congratulations
on the big promotion.

925
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,933
Thanks, Karen.
lt was a long time coming.

926
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,770
OK, here's Paul.

927
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,140
-Jim?
-Paul.

928
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,975
You're getting
better at this, buddy.

929
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,277
Hang on, call waiting.

930
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:55,578
Hello?

931
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,913
-Paul Morse?
-Yeah?

932
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,178
-We found your man.
-You're kidding.

933
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:14,931
l don't see him in there.
l'm sorry.

934
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,599
Take a good hard look.

935
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,202
Just take your time.

936
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,638
Nope. None of these guys.

937
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,903
Let's motor.
Thank you, gentlemen.

938
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:36,953
l know he means well,
but l'm ready to get a divorce.

939
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,924
Even the gardener
looks good to me at this point.

940
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:42,158
The issue is--

941
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,490
Those are my presets!

942
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,199
Who's that?

943
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,301
That's me.
lt's for the wedding video.

944
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,670
You were wearing knee socks.

945
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,873
That's a uniform.
A requirement of the troop, OK?

946
00:57:56,873 --> 00:58:00,343
Hat man!
Look at you in that fedora.

947
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:03,112
Not every kid
can pull that look off.

948
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:06,783
My mom said
l looked like lndiana Jones.

949
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,274
Your mom loved you very much.

950
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,564
This is it.
We gotta be quick.

951
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,532
Let's lock and load.

952
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,376
Someone is always
expecting someone.

953
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:35,867
The trick is figuring out who.

954
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,910
-Who's there?
-Get off the buzzer!

955
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:57,457
Brian, is that you?

956
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,751
Holy shit!

957
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,086
You didn't mention
that Ray had a dog.

958
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,688
What if he wakes up?

959
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:21,991
Yeah.
l forgot to mention that part.

960
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,394
Just be quiet,
get the pictures...

961
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,329
and get out of here.

962
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,087
What the hell is this?

963
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,384
l found them!

964
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,368
Wait, what's his name?

965
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,971
Little Ray.

966
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,472
We should run.

967
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:12,075
Go! Go! Go!

968
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:14,077
OK, right here!

969
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:15,305
Hurry! Close it!

970
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,878
We can handle this.

971
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:25,688
lt's only a dog.
l gotta be smarter than a dog.

972
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:28,054
OK. Calm down.

973
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:35,721
Watch this.
You ready, Little Ray?

974
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,269
Good throw. Yeah.

975
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,237
We're screwed.

976
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,609
-What are we going to do?
-Good question.

977
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:49,178
We're stuck in this bathtub.
lt could be hours.

978
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,747
Ray'll come home,
take a shower...

979
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:53,272
find us in his bathtub,
and kick my ass!

980
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,030
You're upset.

981
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,365
-What?
-Plus, you're on my foot.

982
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,134
God, it's asleep.

983
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,869
l gotta take my boot off.
Help me out.

984
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,496
Seriously?

985
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:25,674
That is one
weird-looking foot.

986
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,682
Didn't stop you from
trying to sleep with it.

987
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,390
Know what Karen'll do
when she finds out?

988
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,026
-l have an idea.
-She'll call off the wedding.

989
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,661
Her dad's gonna fire me.

990
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,463
Maybe getting
fired by Uncle Kenny...

991
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,265
wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world.

992
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:44,934
-lt's a good job.
-You like it?

993
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,303
l sell ad space in hunting
and recreation magazines.

994
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:48,705
What's not to like?

995
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,273
Wow.

996
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:51,674
Excuse me...

997
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:54,143
not everybody can do
whatever they want.

998
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,344
Work five different jobs?

999
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,213
That's not the way
real life works.

1000
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,682
Do you smell that?

1001
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:01,718
-What?
-Fear.

1002
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,084
You've got the smell
of fear all over you.

1003
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,985
Can we switch, please?

1004
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,864
What about you?

1005
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,333
l'm trying some stuff out.
l'd rather do that...

1006
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,303
than get stuck doing
something l don't love.

1007
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,638
l've never been in a bathtub
with a girl before.

1008
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:24,574
lt's not so bad, is it?

1009
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,304
Nah.

1010
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,415
l've got an idea.

1011
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,785
lf l slide this door open...

1012
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,920
at the same time that
you slide that door open...

1013
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,823
we can jump out
while the dog hops in.

1014
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,654
-OK?
-OK.

1015
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,563
Come on, Little Ray.

1016
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,224
-You ready?
-Ready?

1017
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:02,176
One, two, three!

1018
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,745
Who's the tough dog now?

1019
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:13,185
Why aren't we going out
the front door?

1020
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:14,724
l'll tell you later.
Come on.

1021
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,759
l get it.
Take the fire escape like on TV.

1022
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:19,395
Keep your voice down!

1023
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,454
l can do this. All right.

1024
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,500
Come on, let's go!

1025
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,335
l can't.
l'm afraid of heights.

1026
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,237
You just walked down
all these stairs.

1027
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,605
This is different.

1028
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,774
lt's OK. Come on.
We got to go.

1029
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,576
OK. OK.

1030
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:37,013
Just hold onto the rail.

1031
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,782
You got it?

1032
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:42,046
See? lt drops down.

1033
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:52,228
lt wasn't too bad, was it?

1034
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,596
Yeah. That was fun.

1035
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:55,928
OK, let's go.

1036
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,572
l can't believe l pulled it off.

1037
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,006
''We.'' We pulled it off.

1038
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:07,543
We could have been stuck
in that tub for hours.

1039
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:10,780
And l saved your life
on the fire escape.

1040
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,615
You're pretty good at this.
Have you done this before?

1041
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,817
l love this hill!
Hit the gas!

1042
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,953
-What? Here?
-Go! Just trust me!

1043
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:19,513
-All right!
-Go! Go!

1044
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:28,531
Oh, my God!
That was unbelievable!

1045
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,666
l've never done
anything like that!

1046
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,468
Can we do that again?

1047
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,026
Sure.

1048
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,381
That was fun.

1049
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,717
Yeah. Good times.

1050
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:52,788
l never thought
l'd do anything like that.

1051
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:54,590
God, it was just amazing.

1052
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,353
You know, in the car?

1053
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,061
Anyway--

1054
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,464
So, l'll see you...

1055
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:04,567
At the rehearsal dinner.

1056
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,966
OK.

1057
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,806
Becky?

1058
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:13,809
You and Ray,
how'd that happen?

1059
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:15,645
How did l end up with a psycho?

1060
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:17,413
Yeah.

1061
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,015
What can l say? Bad taste.

1062
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,516
Well...

1063
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:23,417
there aren't too many winners
like me out there.

1064
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:28,157
You joke,
but you really are a good guy.

1065
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:30,921
Guys like you are hard to find.

1066
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,398
Good night.

1067
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:06,456
Shit.
You gotta be kidding me.

1068
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:24,646
Hi!

1069
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,783
Caught him with
over an ounce of blow...

1070
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,418
in his passenger seat.

1071
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,754
That ought to put him away
for a while.

1072
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,924
Great bust, Ray.
Go out and celebrate.

1073
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,460
Don't be afraid
to rough him up a little.

1074
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,428
He likes it.

1075
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,907
What?

1076
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,510
How about you start
from the beginning?

1077
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,978
What beginning?

1078
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:58,981
He pulled me over,
he put the drugs in my car...

1079
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,949
and now l'm here!
What do you mean?

1080
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:06,288
lt wasn't working right,
so l panicked...

1081
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:08,557
because l had to be somewhere.

1082
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:12,395
And so l ran out,
and that was the dance lesson.

1083
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:15,956
We know. With Howard.

1084
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:22,170
That Howard.
So incredibly graceful.

1085
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,877
You fellas can go.

1086
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,079
-Who are you?
-lnternal Affairs.

1087
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,916
You were pulled over last night
by Ray Donovan? ls that correct?

1088
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:37,586
-Yeah! But l--
-Do us a favor and shut up.

1089
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,755
We know you didn't do anything.

1090
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,924
Really?

1091
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:45,223
Oh, my God.
So l can go home?

1092
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:50,599
lt's not that simple.
You need to do something for us.

1093
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:54,136
No. l'm getting
married tomorrow.

1094
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:55,971
l have a rehearsal--

1095
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:59,442
Listen, stringbean,
we don't care what you want...

1096
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,577
This is about what we need.

1097
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,477
Yeah.

1098
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:07,283
Remember also
to keep calm and cheerful.

1099
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:10,753
Don't let petty things
get you off course.

1100
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,321
No one wants to be a failure.

1101
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,156
No one wants a life
constantly filled...

1102
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:16,892
with worry,
fear, and frustration.

1103
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:18,794
Therefore, remem--

1104
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:21,464
Oh, my God.

1105
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,591
Shit, shit, shit.

1106
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,480
Hey, mister!

1107
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:45,346
Oh, shit!

1108
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,686
lt's Jim.
Where the hell are you?

1109
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,224
This isn't cold feet, is it?

1110
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,000
l'm really confused.
Are you all right?

1111
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,969
Shit!

1112
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:03,105
OK, so l guess
l'll go stand in for you.

1113
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,266
Maybe we'll see you
at the rehearsal dinner.

1114
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,749
There he is!
Where you been, buddy?

1115
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:17,052
Karen's got her nuts in a bunch.

1116
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,451
Here he is!

1117
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:23,392
Sorry, l'm late.
l know, l know.

1118
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:27,263
-Hi, baby!
-Hi.

1119
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:31,165
There you are.
About time, too.

1120
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,005
There's my man!

1121
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,083
How did you do this?

1122
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,486
lt was nothing.
l thought we'd start...

1123
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:53,255
with the tomato boats
with pickle skippers...

1124
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,524
and the asparagus
a la toastette.

1125
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:58,494
And l got a little
roasted rosemary chicken.

1126
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:01,952
Comes out with a crispy skin,
and it's all moist.

1127
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:05,397
Thank you.

1128
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,172
Are you OK?

1129
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:12,140
l think so.

1130
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,134
Just a little tired.

1131
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:20,716
But this is...
This is incredible.

1132
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:24,277
This is...just amazing.

1133
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,386
Nice guy.

1134
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:37,233
And just in case
Mom's recipe disappoints...

1135
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:41,036
-You missed the rehearsal!
-l was stuck in traffic.

1136
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,372
-Traffic?
-Yeah! Fifty min--

1137
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:47,943
Paul, this is Minister Green.

1138
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:51,647
Let's pray you don't get
stuck in traffic tomorrow.

1139
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,946
From your mouth to God's ears.

1140
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,354
l have to tell you, Paul...

1141
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:01,624
that l put a lot of thought
into tomorrow's ceremony.

1142
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:05,127
lt will be somber, sacred...

1143
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:10,266
a reminder of what
the true meaning of marriage is.

1144
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:13,002
-That's nice.
-l'm looking forward to it.

1145
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,170
Okey-dokey, dinner's ready!

1146
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:18,307
Ken, Sandy, go over there.

1147
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,172
Honey, why don't you
come over here?

1148
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,678
So, Kenny...

1149
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,180
what do you think of the condo?

1150
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,283
lt's great.

1151
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:30,953
lt's got a lot of...character.

1152
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,355
When l gave up
the bachelor pad...

1153
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,857
l said to Dorothy...

1154
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:37,092
''l'll move in with you
under one condition.

1155
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:41,930
''lt's gotta reflect my style.''

1156
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,625
The Duke.

1157
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:47,436
Signed by the artist.

1158
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,538
Hold on a minute, son.

1159
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:53,809
This is juice.
l prefer the wine.

1160
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,345
l'm sorry, ma'am.
Mrs. Cooper--

1161
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:59,548
l don't care what you were told.

1162
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:03,652
l'm strong for an old lady,
aren't l?

1163
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,688
Yes, ma'am.

1164
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,849
Wine, please.

1165
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,796
Honey, you look
very handsome tonight.

1166
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,198
l love that sweater on you.

1167
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,868
-Thanks.
-lt's very sharp.

1168
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,670
Are you having fun?

1169
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,440
-Yeah--
-Absolutely--

1170
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,641
Great party.

1171
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:28,210
l know!
And it's all for us!

1172
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,645
Yeah.

1173
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,847
l'm gonna slip off
to the powder room.

1174
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,680
Go ahead. l'll be here.

1175
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,818
-She's very sweet.
-Yeah, l know.

1176
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:58,569
l'll be right back.

1177
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:03,110
Check this out.

1178
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,748
What is that?

1179
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:08,283
The cops are on to Ray.
They're making me wear this.

1180
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,352
They're sitting
outside listening.

1181
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:12,454
Oh, cool.

1182
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:15,791
Check one. One-Adam-1 2.

1183
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,026
Breaker 1-9,
this is Ex-Tiki Dancer...

1184
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:21,130
-Who is she?
-Some idiot.

1185
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,398
What are you doing?

1186
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,768
Oh, my God. Sorry.

1187
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,970
l'm wearing a wire.
What are we gonna do?

1188
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:32,241
This gravy
is absolutely heavenly.

1189
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,210
Somebody smells really good.
Know what l'm saying?

1190
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,445
l suddenly realized--

1191
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:44,019
Did you know this?
l was a surfer.

1192
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,418
l had a longboard.

1193
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:48,757
Know what the real
mark of greatness is?

1194
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,225
lt's the Duke!

1195
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:51,954
''Why, thank you, pilgrim.''

1196
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,231
Out there
riding on the horse...

1197
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:59,802
man versus nature
versus himself!

1198
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:01,970
Because man
fights his own self...

1199
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,506
to find out
what it is about him...

1200
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:06,875
Everyone?

1201
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,604
l'd like to propose a toast.

1202
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,352
To the chicken!

1203
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:19,718
Man, how good is that stuff?

1204
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:28,497
The story of how
Paul and Karen got together...

1205
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,699
is old news
to pretty much everybody...

1206
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:34,403
but l like to tell it
because it gives me a chance...

1207
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,972
to remind my brother
that l am the one responsible...

1208
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,341
for all of his future happiness.

1209
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:42,444
That's right.
She talked to me first.

1210
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:46,982
And if l had not been married
at the time...

1211
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:51,420
l would've whisked her
out of that bar so fast...

1212
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,321
it would've
straightened out her perm.

1213
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:08,103
l knew right then
that Karen was a special woman.

1214
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:10,105
She's the kind of woman...

1215
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:13,642
who helps a guy
figure out the answers...

1216
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:17,346
that she would make
an incredible partner...

1217
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:21,942
and a wonderful wife
and mother.

1218
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:27,354
The minute l saw her,
l knew she would be the one.

1219
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,560
And that Paul
would be a happy man...

1220
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,762
for the rest of his days.

1221
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:35,998
So l raise my glass to Karen.

1222
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:38,100
l wish both
her and my brother...

1223
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,364
all of the happiness
in the world.

1224
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:47,576
Well done, Pete! Well done!

1225
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:50,101
Nice job!

1226
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:56,952
You like that, Padre?

1227
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,054
lt's got a great beat.

1228
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,251
Here's the same thing,
only backwards.

1229
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,559
That's Satan, man!

1230
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:16,038
l cannot believe
you mentioned the night we met.

1231
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:18,040
When will you
let me live that down?

1232
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,575
How many stories do l have...

1233
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,277
about attractive women
hitting on me in bars?

1234
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:23,612
l don't know.

1235
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:27,382
Maybe when cute married guys
don't wear wedding rings...

1236
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,284
that is the risk they take.

1237
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:32,588
l actually remember the song
playing on the jukebox...

1238
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,956
the night that we met.

1239
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:35,557
Me, too!

1240
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,459
You remember the song
that was playing...

1241
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:38,927
the night l met Karen?

1242
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:41,196
lt's one of those songs
that sticks in your head...

1243
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,131
and ruins years of your life.

1244
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:45,067
No, Pete,
you are surely mistaken.

1245
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,669
''lslands in the Stream''
is a great song.

1246
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:49,972
What does the line...

1247
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:55,243
When we rely on each other,
uh-huh...

1248
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,511
What does that mean?

1249
01:16:56,511 --> 01:17:00,582
lt means that they've come
to realize something...

1250
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:02,384
that they rely on each other...

1251
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:06,755
and as they realize that
they say ''Uh-huh.''

1252
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:09,024
No, they realized the music
was still going...

1253
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:10,859
and they'd
run out of lyrics...

1254
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:12,661
so they made up
some nonsense syllables.

1255
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,263
Pete, you're killing me!

1256
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,467
-Excuse me.
-That is a beautiful song.

1257
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,769
l remember what
you were wearing that night.

1258
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:24,106
You looked so cute,
l thought you had mascara on.

1259
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,475
-Hey, Ma.
-Hi, honey.

1260
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,676
You got a second?

1261
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:31,713
Sure, baby, it's your night.
What?

1262
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:34,549
-You and Buck.
-Yeah?

1263
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:35,917
You're pretty happy, huh?

1264
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:40,055
Yeah. Very happy.
Your stepfather's different.

1265
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:41,857
He's very, very different...

1266
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:45,794
but there's
just something about him.

1267
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:49,431
He gets me.
He lets me be myself.

1268
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:53,168
l've never been happier, honey.

1269
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,137
One, two, three, draw!

1270
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,706
l think she got you!

1271
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:01,005
l've just never been happier.

1272
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:36,344
Who do you have to know...

1273
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:39,715
to get a little
Grey Poupon around here?

1274
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,342
Ray!

1275
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:46,521
lt's you, in my apartment,
making a sandwich.

1276
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:50,125
lt wouldn't kill you to keep
lettuce in the crisper.

1277
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:54,396
No, it wouldn't, Ray.
Ray's here.

1278
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,631
He's coming.
He's right there.

1279
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:59,601
l don't know what you did
to get your butt out of jail...

1280
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:02,003
but you think
you're the only slippery guy...

1281
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,939
l've ever dealt with?

1282
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,173
No, Ray.

1283
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:09,077
Do you think planting evidence
is all l got?

1284
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:11,747
l got a whole bag of tricks...

1285
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,816
including kicking your ass.

1286
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:19,685
You know what?
Bring it on.

1287
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:27,295
Oh, a gift.

1288
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,162
How do you like
this package, Ray?

1289
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:37,305
Hey, yo mama!

1290
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,741
What did you just say?

1291
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:41,800
What?

1292
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:48,483
l have to ask you to leave now,
seriously.

1293
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:51,953
That's a death lock.
You ain't getting out.

1294
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,089
That's good.

1295
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,457
Can l ask you a question?

1296
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,592
Yeah, shoot.

1297
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:00,060
How do you cheat
on a girl like Becky?

1298
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:07,435
How do you cheat on a girl
who's funny and beautiful?

1299
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:10,105
Who speaks fluent Chinese?

1300
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:13,875
Who's afraid of heights?
Which is kind of sweet.

1301
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:18,780
Who's such a bad dancer.
And those feet.

1302
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,116
A girl who's--Sorry.

1303
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,617
Police! Freeze!

1304
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:24,786
Get your hands in the air
or l'll shoot you!

1305
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:26,288
Where were you guys?

1306
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,056
You're going away
for a long time.

1307
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:30,392
Whoa! Wait! Hey!

1308
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,127
For making a sandwich?

1309
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:34,863
We'll take the tape now.

1310
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:38,400
What? Wow, l...

1311
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,868
Hold on. You were wired?

1312
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:46,169
Yeah, Ray, l was.

1313
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,215
Son of a bitch!

1314
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,417
Get him!

1315
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,587
Get off me!
Get off me, mini-cop!

1316
01:20:58,587 --> 01:20:59,955
Thanks for your help.

1317
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:04,153
Yeah, big man!
Wearing a wire! Asshole!

1318
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:32,921
This is a disaster.

1319
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,757
We didn't all wear bow ties
to school when we were 1 3.

1320
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:38,293
l was eccentric.
lt was a phase.

1321
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:40,095
Are you OK?

1322
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:43,431
Am l OK?
Let me see, Pete.

1323
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:47,903
l woke up with a tiki dancer
in my bed six days ago...

1324
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,305
then l found out
she was my fiancée's cousin...

1325
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:53,108
then l got mugged by
her psycho cop ex-boyfriend.

1326
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:54,876
That's right--cop.

1327
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,745
l broke into his apartment
and stole his property--

1328
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,114
which is a felony--
then l got arrested...

1329
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:00,548
but not for
breaking and entering--

1330
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:02,550
which is probably what
you were thinking--

1331
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,653
for cocaine possession.

1332
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:07,389
And as a bonus,
l got crabs from a toilet seat.

1333
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:09,958
-That's bad.
-l got rid of them.

1334
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,127
Shit! l forgot to book
the string quartet!

1335
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,162
Give me your phone!

1336
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:15,764
This is going to be fine.

1337
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,565
lt's going to work out...

1338
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:19,467
and you and Karen
will be together...

1339
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,303
which is
the most important thing...

1340
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:22,804
because she is--

1341
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:25,573
Pete, don't start, please!

1342
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,676
-Yeah?
-Jim!

1343
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:29,244
l forgot to book
the string quartet.

1344
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:32,614
Jimmy anticipated as much,
and l got you covered.

1345
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,416
Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

1346
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:35,610
Late!

1347
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:38,353
He's on it.

1348
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:40,088
Everything's going to be fine.

1349
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:41,456
-How do l look?
-Great.

1350
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,091
See you out there.

1351
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:44,683
All right, thanks.

1352
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,061
Oh, my God.

1353
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,548
Ken! Mr. Cooper!
l didn't--

1354
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:10,885
Were you in that stall
the whole time?

1355
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:14,422
l'll tell you
what l'm going to do.

1356
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:17,158
l'm going to overlook
what l just heard.

1357
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:20,195
l believe
that you love my daughter.

1358
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:24,666
And in spite of everything...

1359
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:26,497
you're going to make her happy.

1360
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:29,571
Am l right?

1361
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:30,805
Yeah, but l can explain--

1362
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:33,375
l don't want to hear it.
What's done is done.

1363
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,343
But, sir,
l didn't actually do--

1364
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:37,579
Paul, forget it.

1365
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:42,350
We're men. We're hunters.

1366
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,750
lt happens.

1367
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:07,542
Here. lt's a butter dish.

1368
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,978
And l just gave away
the surprise.

1369
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:12,347
Thanks.

1370
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:16,618
l know that a lot of weird--

1371
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:19,621
fun weird things
happened recently.

1372
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:23,458
You know that stuff
l said about taking chances?

1373
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:25,727
That was all bullshit.

1374
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,962
You're a great guy...

1375
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:32,467
and Karen's a great girl,
so congratulations.

1376
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:35,493
See you in there.

1377
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:43,511
How about those pants?
Those look good.

1378
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,181
-Hey, Buck!
-How are you?

1379
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:49,878
-Pretty big deal.
-Hi, Sandy!

1380
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,288
-Sorry.
-Music all set?

1381
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:55,490
-lt's all good.
-You're a little late.

1382
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:58,693
Sorry. Tonya. Chicks.

1383
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,462
You brought Tonya?

1384
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:04,599
Yeah. l figured
l'd throw her a bone...

1385
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:07,335
before l dumped her.

1386
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:08,770
Hi, Jim.

1387
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,704
l need my lipstick, baby.
Where is it?

1388
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:16,945
What the heck?
How'd that get in there?

1389
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,581
Hey, Paul.

1390
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:22,117
We met at your bachelor party.
l'm Tonya.

1391
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,785
Yeah. l remember.

1392
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:29,491
You! You didn't warn me
about this cuddle monkey.

1393
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,760
He's been writing me poems
and sending me flowers.

1394
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,363
Whoa, Tonya.
lx-nay on the oem-pay.

1395
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:38,199
Two days and he gave me
the keys to his apartment.

1396
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:41,636
-Really?
-Yeah.

1397
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:44,372
l love you, cuddle monkey.

1398
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:49,144
Love you, too...honey bear.

1399
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:53,240
OK. Good luck.

1400
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:56,484
Maybe l love her a little bit.

1401
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:58,987
You ready?
Let's do this.

1402
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,588
l almost forgot.
The minister's sick.

1403
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,891
Something about
the food last night.

1404
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,692
What are you talking about?

1405
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:06,091
Who's going to marry us?

1406
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:15,635
Showtime.

1407
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:24,879
Who are they?

1408
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:26,346
What the hell is that?

1409
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,218
Howard!

1410
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:32,687
l know, l know.
lt's rock and roll...

1411
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:34,848
but we just need
to find the beat.

1412
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,630
What do you think?
Pretty sweet?

1413
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:45,300
-ls this really necessary?
-Take my arm.

1414
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,768
-Take it!
-Take it!

1415
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:52,574
So pretty!

1416
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:57,011
l'm Daddy's little girl,
and you're my great big man.

1417
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,036
Now, take me, hold me tight.

1418
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,455
One, two, now fly...

1419
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,286
Sorry, dear!

1420
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:13,253
You're flying, sweeties!
Can you feel it?

1421
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:51,266
ls this some kind of joke?

1422
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,767
This is so embarrassing.

1423
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,637
l tried.
People like it, OK?

1424
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:58,139
-lt's not that bad.
-lt sounds like a clam bake!

1425
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,842
l had no choice.
l forgot the string quartet.

1426
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,378
l give you one thing to do.

1427
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:06,245
-Why did you pick a band?
-l didn't do it!

1428
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:16,991
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

1429
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:18,686
in the sight of God...

1430
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:25,366
...in order to join
this woman, Karen...

1431
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:30,238
and this man, Paul...

1432
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:32,073
in holy matrimony.

1433
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:35,209
lf there is
anyone here today...

1434
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:38,746
who believes that these two
should not be joined...

1435
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:41,306
for all eternity...

1436
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:46,847
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

1437
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:00,702
We're going to give you
another minute or so...

1438
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:02,932
to think about that.

1439
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,070
Anybody?

1440
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:11,611
Anyone at all.
Anyone with a reason.

1441
01:29:16,718 --> 01:29:18,853
lt doesn't even
have to be a good reason.

1442
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:23,057
lf anyone even has
a whisper of a feeling...

1443
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:24,792
that's enough.

1444
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:27,124
That's good enough.

1445
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,590
l do.

1446
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:46,981
Hi. l'm Paul.

1447
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:49,250
Hi, Paul.

1448
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:52,019
l think l need to tell
you all something...

1449
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,385
before we go any further.

1450
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:00,762
What's happening?

1451
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,430
l've done some things
this past week...

1452
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:04,193
that l'm not proud of.

1453
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,235
And people kept telling me...

1454
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:11,205
''Don't worry about it.
lt's normal.''

1455
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:15,810
But l think they're wrong.

1456
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:20,047
And l'm going down a road
l don't like.

1457
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:22,517
l don't want to be that guy.

1458
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:24,519
You know what l mean?

1459
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:26,854
This is like an AA meeting.

1460
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:34,295
l was talking about fear
the other day with someone...

1461
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:37,365
and it made me realize
that l can't remember...

1462
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:39,600
the last time l've been afraid.

1463
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,937
l mean, really afraid.

1464
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,872
l've been playing it safe.

1465
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:47,033
Everything l do is safe.

1466
01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:52,680
And marrying Karen--

1467
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:56,616
That's not scary at all.

1468
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:04,692
She's beautiful, she's funny,
she's smart...

1469
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,662
she's perfect in so many ways...

1470
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:13,658
but deep down,
we're not right for each other.

1471
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:18,432
Oh, God. Oh, no.

1472
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:23,374
Saying that was scary.

1473
01:31:38,893 --> 01:31:41,088
Mr. Minister Ferris?

1474
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:44,365
Yes, Paul.

1475
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:49,530
l don't think Karen and l
should be joined for eternity.

1476
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:57,712
Uh-huh...

1477
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:00,044
What's that, Pete?

1478
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:05,186
l just realized something
about somebody...

1479
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:08,589
and it made me say...Uh-huh.

1480
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:11,524
That's great, but
l'm in the middle of something.

1481
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:17,465
lslands in the stream

1482
01:32:17,465 --> 01:32:20,701
That is what we are

1483
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:24,038
No one in between

1484
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:27,439
How could we be wrong?

1485
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:31,279
Sail away with me

1486
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:34,582
To another world

1487
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:38,452
Because we rely on each other

1488
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:41,322
Uh-huh

1489
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:45,156
What l realized is
that l'm in love with Karen.

1490
01:32:46,928 --> 01:32:48,663
What the hell is going on here?

1491
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:50,665
Shut your yapping.

1492
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:53,463
Now, this is a wedding.

1493
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:59,331
Paul, would you mind
if l asked Karen to marry me?

1494
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:03,177
Thank you. Karen?

1495
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:05,513
Pete, God, l'd have to...

1496
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:08,749
Well, not right here,
not right now...

1497
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,717
but maybe after a few dates.

1498
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:13,884
Oh, Pete!

1499
01:33:32,707 --> 01:33:34,299
lt's OK. l'm OK.

1500
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:51,181
These are the days.

1501
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:10,405
Kenny, the good news is
we'll still be in-laws.

1502
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:12,305
Lady, you forget somebody?

1503
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:15,875
Stop the cab.

1504
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:21,978
Asshole!

1505
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:31,192
l was gonna wait for you.

1506
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:32,760
You were great in there.

1507
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:36,997
Listen. l just...

1508
01:35:36,997 --> 01:35:40,558
l think l just figured
something out back there.

1509
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:45,539
Because what l said...

1510
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:47,208
l don't think l would
have been able to say...

1511
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:50,511
if it wasn't for you.

1512
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:56,350
And it also made me
realize something else.

1513
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,545
What?

1514
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:01,612
This.

1515
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:55,603
Where to, Whitey?
