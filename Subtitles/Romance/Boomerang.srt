1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,634
Yeah, this is a story of famous dogs.

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,911
For the dog that
chases its tail will be dizzy.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,756
Dog.

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,359
- Hey, you. I left somethin' on your desk.
- I've got it.

5
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,596
- Yo, man.
- Man, when are we gonna hang out?

6
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,712
We gonna hang out soon.
Slow down with that thing, Bony.

7
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,513
- Mornin', ladies.
- Hi, Marcus.

8
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,997
- So I'm here on the right. I'm like this.
- Yo, man, I'm tryin' to work.

9
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,588
- Hey. Whassup?
- Yo. Whassup?

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,915
- I'll see y'all at lunch.
- OK. Peace.

11
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,673
Good morning.
Hey, stranger, nice to see you again.

12
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,031
Morning, cuteness.
How you doin'? Whassup?

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,515
Morning. Morning. Morning.

14
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,716
- Good morning.
- Morning.

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,236
- Hey, you.
- Hello.

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,670
- Morning, Noreen.
- Good morning, Marcus.

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,998
Do me a favour and send a single
long-stemmed rose to Carrie, Tracy,

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,908
Miranda, Cassandra,
Alegra, Shirrel and Mai-Lai.

19
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,429
- With the usual card?
- "Thinking only of you."

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,599
Right. You have a meeting
with Lady Eloise tomorrow at nine.

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,156
- Cool.
- Nelson's waiting. And Anita called.

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,796
I forgot.
Will you get her on the phone?

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,239
- Sure.
- Thank you.

24
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,637
- Nelson.
- Hello, Marcus.

25
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,389
I can't wait to show you this.
I have recut the Kissable spot.

26
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,914
You recut it? But is it sexy?

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,315
Is it sexy?

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,396
It is sexational.

29
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,028
- I like it.
- Good.

30
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,594
I like the orange,
and I like the ice cream.

31
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,234
You gotta get rid of
the cherries and the banana.

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,275
Cherry and banana? But that's a little
Buñuel, a little Dali. It's... you know.

33
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,233
It's too overt.
We should go a little more subtle.

34
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,999
- Some women might get offended.
- All right.

35
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,749
But I dug it. I dug it. Don't make that
"he didn't dig it" face. I dug it.

36
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,350
It just got a little nasty,
like you always do.

37
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,713
- OK.
- All right.

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,398
- Nasty Nelson.
- That's me.

39
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,353
Least there wasn't
no sausages in this one.

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,638
- Yeah?
- Anita on line one.

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,716
Great.

42
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,992
Hey, you.

43
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,033
Let me... Can I explain what happened?
Have you been watching the news?

44
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,152
You haven't been watching the news.
The big accident in midtown,

45
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,475
where the cabs
busted into the other cab,

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,478
it knocked into a bus
and a water main bust - I was in that.

47
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,388
It's on the news right now. It just
went off Channel 4, just went off.

48
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,592
Yeah, but I was...
No, I'm cool. I'm all right, yeah.

49
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,393
No, my neck's a little stiff, that's all.

50
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
Actually, a massage sounds kinda fly.

51
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,553
Yeah, I'm all with that. That, too.

52
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,913
Can I call you next week? Cool.

53
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,478
Later.

54
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,756
- What's next?
- Casting for the body lotion spot.

55
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,795
Tell the fellas I might be
a little late for lunch today.

56
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,509
Yo, man. I saw somethin'
on cable last night - freaked me.

57
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,950
There was this woman, right?
Baby had body.

58
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,358
She's lyin' there, totally naked, right?
You could see everything.

59
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,436
But she had a dick, man.

60
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,028
Fucked me up.

61
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,197
It was a 976 number
for hermaphrodites.

62
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,790
You're talkin' about 9-7-6-D-l-C-K,
Chicks With Dicks.

63
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,508
How could you put that in your
mental Rolodex? He's a closet freak.

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,631
- You got problems.
- You're comin' out.

65
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,513
- Yeah.
- No, man, I was just, you know, kiddin'.

66
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,990
Oh, man. That ain't regular, man.

67
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,157
There's a whole world out there
we don't know about.

68
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,716
Like the shit you read in <i>Penthouse</i> -
that stuff never happens to me.

69
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,230
Man, stuff like that never happens
to anybody, except for Marcus.

70
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,478
The only reason stuff like that happens
to me is I pay attention to women.

71
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,114
- Y'all don't pay attention to women.
- I pay attention.

72
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,629
- You have to study their movements.
- Get outta here.

73
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,115
- It's an art form.
- I can't do that, man.

74
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,196
- That's why you get no pussy.
- Exactly.

75
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,949
Tyler, there's other things
in life besides sex.

76
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,517
Sharing, commitment. You gotta get in
touch with your feminine side like me.

77
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,996
Startin' to sound a little on the soft side.
Startin' to sound soft.

78
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,476
- Borderline bitch.
- You know what your problem is?

79
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,876
You need more romance
and less Doberman pinscher.

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,151
That's true. You have
too much dog and no romance.

81
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,354
Don't even try that.
You ain't got no romance.

82
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,993
Excuse me. I am the most romantic cat
both of you know.

83
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,035
When I meet a woman, I am flowers,
I am candy, I am soft music...

84
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,991
And Mr Milk-Bones.

85
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,475
I am Mr Romance
when I meet a woman.

86
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,239
Once I hit it, I lose interest.
But that ain't my fault.

87
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,318
So, in other words,
right at that moment of orgasm,

88
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,590
all the romance just
skeets right outta you.

89
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,757
No, but you can't put that on me.
The onus is not on me.

90
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,199
- Hi.
- How are you?

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,356
- Good.
- You have a beautiful accent.

92
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,040
- Where are you from?
- Holland. Nice meeting you.

93
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,752
- Nice meeting you, too.
- Bye.

94
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,871
Bye-bye, cuteness.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,991
I'm from Detroit.

96
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,669
Shit, that shit makes me mad, man.
Bitches never do that to me, man.

97
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,389
Maybe it's because
you call them bitches.

98
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,229
Yeah, man. You need to straighten up,
show some respect, man. Come on.

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,636
Yo, man. Excuse me.
Excuse me, waitress.

100
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,070
- Yeah.
- Look, I ordered the duck, right?

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,919
- Yeah.
- What vegetable comes with that?

102
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,676
That's a good one. It's sautéed
asparagus spears, and it is good.

103
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,278
- Flavour.
- Delicious. Yeah.

104
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,517
- That sounds good. Oh, God.
- You'll love 'em.

105
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,517
- All right.
- That sounds good.

106
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,676
- "That sounds good." Come on.
- What?

107
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,872
Why don't she just come out
and call us jungle bunnies?

108
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,753
- What?
- Asparagus spears.

109
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,958
- What?
- For white guys, it'd be asparagus tips.

110
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,833
- Racial, man. Racial.
- Man, you trippin' now.

111
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,999
- No, you trippin'.
- Definitely, definitely. No, you def...

112
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,877
You are gonna have to process
some of this anger, man.

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,638
- No.
- Yo...

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,150
- Y'all excuse me.
- You know what?

115
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,590
You need to get in touch with Tyler,
and say "Tyler, I love you, man".

116
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,278
What? Nigger, please.

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,830
OK, go take your walk, honey.

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,389
I'll give you $20 for that leash.

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,715
Take it, fool. Turnin' down good money.

120
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,396
Yes, baby.

121
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,038
Kirby.

122
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,718
Kirby.

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,035
Come on, Kirb.

124
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,357
- Kirby.
- Did you lose your dog?

125
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,439
Yeah, I lost a white springer spaniel
with brown spots on, named Kirby.

126
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,348
- Real energetic dog. Did you see him?
- I haven't seen him.

127
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,074
I only took him off the leash
for a couple of seconds.

128
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,111
Kirby.

129
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,028
- He's like a family member, you know?
- I know. I feel the same about Brutus.

130
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,196
- I love my Brutus.
- I can see why.

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,436
- Do you walk him here every day?
- Yeah, I do.

132
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,836
Could you do me a favour? My name is
Marcus Graham. Here's my card.

133
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,396
If you bump into Kirby, could you call?
I'll have somebody pick him up.

134
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,954
OK. Well, good luck.
I sure hope you find him.

135
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,433
Thanks.

136
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,152
Kirb.

137
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,872
Kirby.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,959
Let me give you my number. I won't
sleep until I know you've found him.

139
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,230
- Do you have a pen?
- Do I?

140
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,439
I have a pen right here, and...

141
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,795
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

142
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,796
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck.

143
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,478
Bye-bye.

144
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,398
Kirby?

145
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,033
Kirb?

146
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,718
Kirbster?

147
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,393
Marcus. Marcus.

148
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,514
I know you hear me, you slimy, sleazy,
sneaky, slitherin' son of a bitch.

149
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,598
Keep it down. I'm gettin' ready
to have some company, OK?

150
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,236
- So, who's the victim tonight?
- Yvonne, I don't feel like playin'. Stop.

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,037
Why don't you just tell her you're gonna
use her, then dump her like you did me?

152
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,958
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I did not dump you.

153
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,231
We went out, it was whack,
and it was your fault, and I wish...

154
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,194
Look, why don't you get over it and go
find another man? Get outta here.

155
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,359
I hope you catch a disease
and your dick falls off.

156
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,153
I'd expect you to say something crass.

157
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,236
Don't forget I have the court order
for you to stay away.

158
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,033
- I'm gonna call your probation officer.
- Court order?

159
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,833
I don't give a damn
about no court order.

160
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,236
- Hey.
- Hi.

161
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,638
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you, too.

162
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,995
- Wow. Nice place.
- Thank you.

163
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,317
- Where's Kirby? Kirby. Kirby.
- He's at the groomer's.

164
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,671
He got caught under a truck
and got grease on his coat. He's OK.

165
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,109
- You look great.
- Thank you.

166
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,871
Gold star for Marcus.
Dinner was yummy.

167
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,072
I never met a man who cooked so well.
How'd you learn how to cook like that?

168
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,951
Well, you kinda pick those things up,
you know, when you're...

169
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,389
when you're alone as much as I am.

170
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,078
Really?

171
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,751
Yeah. See...

172
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,313
Marcus.

173
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,908
Marcus, you know you wrong.

174
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,600
You no-good... Marcus.

175
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,750
Let's go in the living room. We'll be
much more comfortable in there.

176
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,030
- OK.
- Come on.

177
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,112
Girlfriend.

178
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,312
Girlfriend.

179
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,113
Girlfriend.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,956
Knock, knock.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,879
- Who's there?
- A scared little boy named Marcus.

182
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,833
And he's just dying to come out.

183
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,713
He's been hurt, too, hasn't he?

184
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,879
Tell me about him.
Tell me all about Marcus.

185
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,591
Well, I haven't been out with anybody
in about two years.

186
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,156
Not since Debra -
that's the girl I almost married.

187
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,750
Day of my wedding, I went to the
church early, cos I had a bad feeling,

188
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,908
and I go in the back,
and that's when I saw it.

189
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,157
She was on the ground
with the best man.

190
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,116
And the priest.

191
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,352
Freakin'.

192
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,436
You poor baby.

193
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,552
Yeah, that's when I realised
that you can't trust anybody.

194
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,236
You can trust me.

195
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,350
I'm not ready for this.

196
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,116
I think I should take you home.
I think it's best.

197
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,911
I can't tell you how helpful this
has been. Gold star for Christie.

198
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,077
Thanks. You really
helped me in here. I felt that.

199
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,590
- You don't have to thank me. Come on.
- No, no, I shouldn't come in.

200
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,474
- Come on.
- Christie, don't. I shouldn't be in here.

201
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,068
I'm not ready for this.
Are we by ourselves?

202
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,476
- Of course we're by ourselves.
- Christie.

203
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,554
- Marcus, spend the night with me.
- Christie, no, it's just too soon. I c...

204
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,315
I just don't wanna be hurt again.

205
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,910
I won't hurt you.

206
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,716
Please be gentle.

207
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,709
- So what happened with this girl?
- Man, she was beautiful.

208
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,673
She was beautiful,
but her feet were jacked up.

209
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,712
- Were they?
- Yeah. I pulled the covers back...

210
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,478
- Yeah?
- ..it was Hammer time.

211
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,275
I should've known. I seen
her shoes had little bumps on the top,

212
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,516
but I thought it was an old shoe.

213
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,872
You'd never think a woman that fine
would have Hammer time in her shoe.

214
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,070
Come on, man, you don't fuck her feet.

215
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,557
I hope I'm not outta line, but don't you
think you were just a little bit too picky?

216
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,636
- Yeah.
- What happened with Tracy?

217
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,399
You met that girl.
She's not very smart.

218
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,229
- Come on, you don't fuck her brains.
- I'm looking for perfection.

219
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,876
- Hi, Marcus.
- Hey.

220
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,318
- Yo, Marcus.
- What's up?

221
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,989
Hey, you on your way to meet Lady
Eloise to discuss that merger, right?

222
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,271
- How do you know everything?
- I read it in your office.

223
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,518
You not supposed to be in my office,
or goin' through my mail, OK?

224
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,350
No, man, I wasn't goin' through your
stuff, man. Here. Hold it up. Hold it up.

225
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,199
- You're gonna read right through?
- Right through.

226
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,710
It says "..lunch tomorrow

227
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,831
at Houlihan's".

228
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,112
Open it up.

229
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,155
"How about lunch at Hou..."
v ery impressive.

230
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,432
Told you, man. Told you, man.
Check this out, man.

231
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,516
I been workin' here nine days.

232
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,350
I been on time, even when it rains. Don't
you think it's time we talked promotion?

233
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,917
Come on, man. I get my own office,
man, bring my ho's in here.

234
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,191
We have a little party,
set this motherfucker off, man.

235
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,236
Marcus Graham.

236
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,598
Lady Eloise? I can't tell you how
excited you got everybody up here.

237
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,838
You're like a breath of fresh air. I've
never seen everybody so excited. It's...

238
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,548
Lady Eloise? I think you requested
to see me. Marcus Graham.

239
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,636
I know.

240
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,840
- May I have a seat?
- Please.

241
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,428
Keep standing.

242
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,235
The rest of my administrative team
will be arriving tomorrow.

243
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,319
However, when I decided
to take over this company,

244
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,874
I considered you a prime asset.

245
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,274
Thank you very much.

246
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,758
We need strong department heads
to oversee this merger.

247
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,350
- Beet juice?
- No, thank you.

248
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,435
It keeps the skin tight,
and none of us are getting any younger.

249
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,713
Well, some women have a girlish
quality that lasts a lifetime.

250
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,436
I've always heard you were
very beguiling to women.

251
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,115
But my schedule is also very tight.

252
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,350
Meet me at my house tonight.

253
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,839
Todd, see to it that
he's at Lavender Hill.

254
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,996
- Good evening, Mr Graham.
- Good evening.

255
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,271
Lady Eloise has been
eagerly anticipating you.

256
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,954
Marcus Graham, Lady Eloise.

257
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,630
Marcus, darling.

258
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,670
Welcome to Lavender Hill.

259
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,554
Lady Eloise, I cannot begin to tell you
how happy I am to be working with you.

260
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,639
I grew up using your products - my
mother used your products, you know.

261
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,069
You were in my medicine
cabinet all my life,

262
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,239
and now I'm, like, working with you,
and it's just very exciting.

263
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,275
I find it very exciting as well.

264
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,917
I'm lookin' forward to a long,
strong, productive relationship.

265
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,837
You know, I don't wanna
blow my own horn...

266
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,430
but I'm really qualified.

267
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,917
You shouldn't have to
blow your own horn.

268
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,918
You should leave that
for someone else to do.

269
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,437
Marcus, darling.

270
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,711
Wouldn't you like to
get a little bit more...

271
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,836
comfortable?

272
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,076
Yeah, sure, why not?

273
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,673
Wouldn't you like to
get out of that tight shirt?

274
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,236
Yeah, I was just
thinking about doin' it myself.

275
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,913
You know, it's a little bright in here.

276
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,999
Wouldn't you like to dim it, make it
a little more romantic, you know?

277
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,954
Could you get it just a little darker?

278
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,837
Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you,
but I just had to say somethin' to you.

279
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,748
You're breathtaking. You're the most
gorgeous woman I've ever laid eyes on.

280
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,235
I had to come over and meet you.

281
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,470
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you laughing?

282
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,720
I'm sorry, it's just that
what you said was pretty pathetic.

283
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,991
- That was not pathetic.
- Come on.

284
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,475
I mean, if I walked up to you and I said

285
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,276
"Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry to bother
you, but, well, I just had to meet you

286
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,995
because you are the most handsome,

287
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,956
the most virile man I have ever seen
in all of my entire life,"

288
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,355
now, would you believe me?

289
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,477
Honestly? Yeah, I would,
but that's just the way I am.

290
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,548
- I'm going to work.
- OK.

291
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,353
- OK.
- Well, I'm goin' this way, too.

292
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,953
It's not like I'm followin' you.
I'm goin' upstairs too.

293
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,991
I'm goin' to the 18th floor, too.

294
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,396
You're auditioning for one of
the commercials. Are you a model?

295
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,229
No. No, I'm not a model.
I'm gonna go work for the company.

296
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,396
- Really?
- Marketing, yeah.

297
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,069
Really? That's my department.
I'm Marcus Graham.

298
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,475
You're Marcus Graham?
You're Marcus Graham?

299
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,997
This is pretty funny
that we're meeting like this.

300
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,395
- I'm sorry, I'm Jacqueline Broyer.
- OK.

301
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,671
- I'm a huge fan of your work.
- Thank you very much.

302
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,916
You're very, very talented.

303
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,396
You was treatin' me like my name was
Stanley. But you're a fan of my work.

304
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,080
I'll let you in on a secret
cos you're a pretty girl.

305
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,955
When this merger goes through, I'm
gonna be in charge of all of marketing.

306
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,593
You are?

307
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,635
Marcus, I'm afraid that there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

308
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,718
I'm sorry. You see,
I'm in charge of marketing.

309
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,675
No, that's impossible.

310
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,358
Sorry.

311
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,630
I'm the logical choice. I'm vice
President of Marketing for Chantress.

312
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,352
Good morning. Thank you.

313
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,632
I know, but I'm director of marketing for
Lady Eloise, and we are acquiring you.

314
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,036
But I had a very good indication
from someone that the job was mine.

315
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,711
- Really? From whom?
- From Lady Eloise. Lady Eloise.

316
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,637
- Really?
- Yes.

317
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,230
Marcus, Lady Eloise
doesn't make any decisions.

318
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,397
She's the name on the package.

319
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,832
- No, it's her company. The Lady Eloise.
- She hasn't run it for 15 years.

320
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,590
All of the decisions are made
by the board of directors in Paris.

321
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,915
But it's Lady Eloise.

322
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,600
She has no power.

323
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,034
She's a very sweet woman.
She's a little detached from reality.

324
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,036
You should see the way she just...
she throws herself

325
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,039
at young, handsome, virile men.

326
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,874
Are you tryin' to imply that I hit it?
No, I see...

327
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,630
- Marcus, darling.
- How you doin', Lady Eloise?

328
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,151
I don't have any panties on.

329
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,637
Lady Eloise, please, we have a meeting.
Can we just please go?

330
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,751
I'm sorry.

331
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,871
It's warm in here.

332
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,676
Just cos somebody takes off their
drawers, don't mean I did somethin'.

333
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,913
- So, yo, man, you gonna quit, right?
- Of course he's gonna quit, man.

334
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,508
That's right. Say
"Look, girl, I'm outta there".

335
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,835
That's what I'm thinkin' about doin'.

336
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,511
I'm thinkin' about steppin'...
There she is, right there.

337
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,596
- That's her?
- Yeah.

338
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,837
Psych. Yo, you can't quit, man.
You gotta stay.

339
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,428
- Yeah, she's bad.
- Hello, Marcus.

340
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,631
- Hello, Jacqueline.
- You look great.

341
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,318
- And so do you.
- Thank you.

342
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,512
This is my man Tyler,
and this is Gerard. Jacqueline.

343
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,474
This is Angela Lewis. She works in
our art department. She's very talented.

344
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,751
I think the two of you should
probably be working together.

345
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,237
- Excuse me, Jacqueline. It's that time.
- Thank you, Todd. Nice meeting you.

346
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,477
Marcus, would you join me
for a second? Thanks.

347
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,869
Come on, girl. Get on.

348
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,870
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
a very exciting announcement to make.

349
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,154
Since 1948, the name Lady Eloise has
been synonymous with glamour, grace,

350
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,397
sensuality, and stunning natural beauty.

351
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,836
In the next century,
that tradition continues.

352
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,750
Introducing the new face
of Lady Eloise cosmetics: Strangé.

353
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,838
Yes.

354
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,878
- Hey.
- Hi.

355
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,594
- How are you?
- Good. You look lost. Can I help you?

356
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,872
I'm just looking for Jacqueline,
basically, is what I'm doing.

357
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,389
You're interested in her, right?

358
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,275
- Now, what would make you say that?
- Most men are. She's fantastic.

359
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,989
I mean, if I were a guy, I would
probably be interested in Jacqueline.

360
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,714
- If you were a guy.
- Not that I have those thoughts,

361
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,436
because I don't, I'm just saying she's
attractive and I would go out with her.

362
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,997
Women do stuff like that. You say
"She's cute" or "Her hair's nice",

363
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,669
but guys don't go "Look at his
shoulders". We don't do that.

364
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,588
Sure you have. You've seen a movie,
and you've seen a man and you've said

365
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,870
"There is a nice-looking man."
You have.

366
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,719
I can't believe we're havin'
this conversation.

367
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,308
I saw Billy Dee Williams
in <i>Lady Sings the Blues.</i>

368
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,273
He came down the steps,
and I thought he was cool,

369
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,837
but I didn't wanna get with him,
you know. That's a whole entire...

370
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,710
Wait, I have someone you should meet.

371
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,559
Gerard. I think I met someone
that's perfect for you.

372
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,274
Why don't you guys come chitchat? I...

373
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,913
Hi.

374
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,751
Good evening, boss.

375
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,235
Please do not call me that.

376
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,031
I want you to think of me
as your colleague.

377
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,233
So tell me something. Are you excited
about working with Strangé?

378
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,116
Stop. You know I didn't come up here
to talk about no Strangé.

379
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,231
I came up here to talk to you about us.

380
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,751
I'm rapping. This is my mack-daddy vibe
I'm giving you, in all of its splendour.

381
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,313
- What's up?
- Really?

382
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,273
Yes. I mean, <i>eleganz a</i>
mack daddy of the month.

383
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,310
I see. Well, let me get a good look.

384
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,394
Check it. Just like <i>Jet</i> magazine.

385
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,916
- Whassup?
- You are absolutely wonderful.

386
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,273
But I think that we should kind of
make this clear right from the start,

387
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,755
so there's no misunderstanding.

388
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,515
You see, I don't date men I work with.

389
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,071
- Well, then, I quit.
- You can't quit

390
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,953
because I need you.

391
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,510
No, hon, wait one sec.

392
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,428
You have an eyelash. It's gonna
go in your eye. Wait. Come here.

393
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,510
- Are you all right? Huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

394
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,312
- Tryin' to seduce me.
- What?

395
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,590
- That was very seductive.
- What?

396
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,950
- You know...
- You had something in your eye.

397
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,072
- I saved your eye.
- No, no, no, no, no.

398
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,873
I know what it's like when
you have somethin' in your eye.

399
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,117
Your mother opens your eye and blows.
Your eyeball comes out.

400
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,516
It was never like you just did.
Come on. That was very seductive.

401
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,916
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no. No.

402
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,600
And let me assure you of something.

403
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,589
When I seduce you,

404
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,757
if I decide to seduce you,

405
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,753
don't worry, you'll know.

406
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,512
- Yo, Marcus.
- Hey, man.

407
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,234
Me and the minimum-wage
brothers in the mailroom

408
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,512
wanna know how long do you think it'll
take you to bone that new executrix.

409
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,473
I need to know cos we got
a little office-pool thing.

410
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,592
Look, that's very crass.
Miss Broyer and I are colleagues,

411
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,669
and I have great respect for her.
It's professional. Totally professional.

412
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,120
So what you sayin', man?
It's gonna take a week?

413
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,037
Not you, Marcus, you the man.

414
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,189
- I hate it.
- But this fragrance tested very well.

415
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,518
Jacqueline, I said I wanted
the essence of sex.

416
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,632
- Yes.
- Well, I think this is it.

417
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,955
You would.

418
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,230
But let me show you...

419
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,158
what I'm talking about.

420
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,549
- Unbelievable.
- This...

421
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,075
is the essence of sex.

422
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,708
Lloyd. Come on, Lloyd. Wait, Lloyd.
Lloyd, man. Lloyd.

423
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,229
Lloyd, look, wait. Look, wait, hold it.
Come on, man. Wait, wait, wait.

424
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,874
The fragrance is fine.
Nobody's changin' anything.

425
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,355
That woman doesn't
deserve her own fragrance.

426
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,711
Do you think Liz Taylor would have
thrown her panties in my face?

427
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,832
You could ask her, Lloyd.
Look, it was a joke.

428
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,750
I'm just tryin' to be... I'm being funny.
Come on, look... All right, Lloyd?

429
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,752
Marcus. You're a devil.

430
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,155
I love you. Come on back.

431
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,268
Please! You make me feel ridiculous.

432
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,918
It's <i>mon image, c'est mon visage.</i>
<i>Alors.</i> And you, where you been, you?

433
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,237
- I had to go...
- Shut up. Look at this.

434
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,115
This is ridiculous.
Why are my concepts being ignored?

435
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,838
I'm not a fool.
I know what the people want.

436
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,080
They want to be shocked, they want to
be stunned, and they want to be jolted.

437
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,830
So, I have prepared a list
of names for the fragrance.

438
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,389
"Wet Spot". No, sorry.
I crossed out that one.

439
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,229
"Love Puss". "Pig Puke".

440
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,316
- "Afterbirth".
- After what?

441
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,234
"Afterbirth".

442
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:26,310
- I'm sorry, I thought you said "bath".
- No. It's English. B-l-R-T-H. Birth.

443
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,193
I was just making a distinction
between "birth" or "bath".

444
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,517
- Birth, birth, birth.
- Thank you, darling.

445
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,633
Don't make fun of me, OK?
My English is not so good.

446
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,157
"Steel v agina".

447
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,271
- You understand that one.
- Yeah.

448
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,119
"Steel v agina" - marvellous.

449
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,955
What do you think?

450
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,831
- I...
- Those are really creative.

451
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,110
- Thank you.
- But the name of this fragrance

452
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,949
has to be something
that catches the eye.

453
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,198
It has to incite passion,
and it has be electric,

454
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,312
and it has to say glamour,
and it has to say sexy.

455
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,637
It has to say smart. It has to...

456
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,830
Wait a minute.

457
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,317
Strangé.
Your name is all of those things.

458
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,069
You're powerful, you're glamorous,
you're sexy, you're intelligent.

459
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,033
That's what we should call
the perf... Strangé. Strangé.

460
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,752
- Strangé.
- Strangé.

461
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,677
- Strangé.
- Strangé.

462
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,076
OK, OK, OK, OK.

463
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,112
- I like it.
- Strangé.

464
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,196
Strangé.

465
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,951
Strut, girl, strut.

466
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,274
Go on, girl. It's you, girl.

467
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,198
Work it, girl. Strangé girl.

468
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,039
Thank you for introducing me
to Gerard. We're goin' out tonight.

469
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,550
Now, that's some good news.
That's good news. Great.

470
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,358
You do realise we're never
gonna be able to control her.

471
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,234
Why would you wanna control Strangé?
We'll get more coverage that way.

472
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,430
Strangé is buck wild.

473
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,755
Yes, you're probably right.

474
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,352
We've got this meeting
in New Orleans on the 24th.

475
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,315
All of the sales reps are gonna be there.
There's a lot of work to be done.

476
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,115
Yeah. OK, so, we'll have dinner
or somethin', go over it.

477
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,310
Marcus.

478
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,589
- What?
- Come on.

479
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,349
Stop. Excuse me. Excuse me.
You're... Wait a minute, wait a minute.

480
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,233
If we were both men,
we could have a business dinner.

481
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,750
You're the one flippin' this into
a man-woman thing. I said dinner,

482
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,476
and let's discuss our workload.
That's what I'm talking about.

483
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,876
- Just dinner?
- Just our workload over a meal.

484
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,831
We've got a hell of a load.

485
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,235
- OK.
- Dinner?

486
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,352
- Dinner.
- OK, I'll see you at dinner.

487
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,276
Great.

488
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,832
- Hey.
- Hey. You're here. I was gonna leave.

489
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,919
- I didn't think anyone was home.
- I'm sorry. I dozed off.

490
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,956
Come on in.

491
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,197
- You look great. You're all dressed up.
- You're lookin' casually fine tonight.

492
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,073
- Let me get that coat for you.
- Thank you.

493
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,876
v ery nice.

494
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,792
Marcus, this is a very nice place
you have here.

495
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,390
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Check out over here.

496
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,990
- That's a big, wonderful bed.
- Yeah, well, I need my space.

497
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,953
- Yeah.
- Cool. Music.

498
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,593
Have a look around.
Go check out upstairs.

499
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,478
What you're trying to say is,
Marcus is a...

500
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,353
A ho. He's a straight-up ho.

501
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,876
- Don't... Come on, stop.
- He's a no-good barking mutt.

502
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,514
- Really?
- Nothin' really happened between us...

503
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,835
- She's crazy.
- No, this is very interesting.

504
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,030
- She's bugged.
- v ery interesting.

505
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,789
I ain't crazy. Hey, girlfriend.
Don't let him do it to you. He got a plan.

506
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,549
What, you 'bout my size, my height,
my weight? Doggy style.

507
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:46,038
Doggy style. I know, girlfriend. I'm tryin'
to help you out. It's a sister thing.

508
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,149
Damn.

509
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,038
- Wow, you look great.
- Thank you.

510
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,836
You look neat.

511
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,518
- Thanks.
- Come on in.

512
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,154
- Yeah. These are for you.
- Thank you.

513
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,033
This is wild. Man, did you do
all the decoration yourself?

514
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,152
Every bit. I know you think
it's a little weird...

515
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,838
- No, no, no.
- It's really...

516
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,191
- It's eclectic. Yeah.
- Eclectic, yeah.

517
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,754
- So you like it?
- v ery interesting.

518
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,389
That's a mask, a Goli mask.
I got it from Africa.

519
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,318
That's weird. I didn't know
Africans were into hockey.

520
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,513
No, no, no, no, no.
Goli is the name of the tribe. The tribe.

521
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,154
It's a joke.

522
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,315
You know, the secret to my salmon is
the rosemary in the butter sauce. Cos...

523
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,431
Excuse me?
You were saying something?

524
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,632
I use fresh rosemary on my salmon.
That's why it has that...

525
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,356
I'm sorry, Marcus.
My mind is actually someplace else.

526
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,031
The Knicks game starts in a minute. Do
you mind if we eat in front of the Tv?

527
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,755
- No, not at all. Sure.
- No? Great.

528
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,239
OK, do you want Italian, or Indian?

529
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,716
- So, like, women like guys that just...
- Yeah. Decide.

530
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:15,392
All right, I'm gonna decide.
I will choose Chinese.

531
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,318
- No.
- That's cool. Whatever you say.

532
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,998
Sorry.

533
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,078
- I'm bein' indecisive.
- Yes. You're being indecisive.

534
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,229
Can I ask you, like,
a personal question?

535
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,237
- Sure.
- Do you like kids?

536
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,920
I love kids. I paint kids.

537
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,077
So, do you wanna have a lot
of kids when you get married?

538
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,749
I want a huge family.
At least ten children.

539
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,030
Ten children?

540
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,879
That's not a family.
That's an African village.

541
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,269
This is absolutely ridiculous. Are you
watchin' this? This is incredible.

542
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,833
I'm goin' to get some espresso.
You want some?

543
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,916
No. No, no, thanks.

544
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,950
Listen, Marcus. While you're up,
will you grab me a beer?

545
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,992
Thanks.

546
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,590
All right, I had a wonderful evening.

547
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,518
- Thank you. So did I.
- Even though we never got to eat.

548
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,313
I know, but next time,
I'll take control. I'll order.

549
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,317
- So, next week, dinner?
- You got it.

550
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,831
Followed by hot, butt-naked sex?
Just kidding. I'm just kidding.

551
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,717
So, now's the most difficult
part of the evening. Kiss goodnight.

552
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,233
I know. But I got an idea. Count from
five backwards real fast, and go for it.

553
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,316
- All right. Close your eyes.
- Go.

554
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,795
Five, four, three, two, one, go.

555
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,311
God, I'm sorry. I missed.

556
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,034
- I guess I'll have to do it again.
- No. I'll do it.

557
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,593
OK.

558
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,358
- Goodbye.
- Night, Angela.

559
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,074
- Night. Thank you.
- See you next week.

560
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,111
Bye.

561
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,753
Adios.

562
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,197
Bye.

563
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,879
It's Korean for "I'm sorry I shot you, but
I thought you were robbing my store".

564
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,956
Bye-bye.

565
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,635
What an incredible evening.

566
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,753
Did you see Jordan's last shot?
The man must've been 60ft up, huh?

567
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,749
Yeah, he really can jump.

568
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,314
Want me to come get a cab
with you or somethin'?

569
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,590
No. No. I'm fine.

570
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,950
- But you can walk me to the elevator.
- What a treat.

571
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,275
- Yo, man, she a lesbo.
- Man, the term is gay, all right, Tyler?

572
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,278
Just cos she won't sleep with you
doesn't mean she's gay.

573
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,313
- She's not a lesbian, OK?
- Yo, man, it's been about three weeks.

574
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,237
She's not a lesbian, man.

575
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,956
Personally, if I was datin' somebody
that fine, I'd wait eight or nine months.

576
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,154
You could wait eight or nine years and
you'd never have no woman that fine.

577
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,674
You wild. But at least my lady didn't
leave me for no damn Guardian Angel.

578
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,351
Why you do that, man? I'd have fucked
him up but they do that karate shit.

579
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,438
Come on, stop. You gonna
give the brother a heart attack.

580
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,395
- Breathe. Let the brother relax.
- I'm sorry, man. I was just playin'.

581
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,990
Can I ask you somethin' though, man?
Did you bang Angela yet?

582
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,838
Good question. Good question.

583
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,839
Angela and I are just tryin' to get to
know each other on a platonic level.

584
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,231
OK. So, in other words,
you ain't hit the twizzer.

585
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,476
- Not a drop.
- Twizzer? What's that?

586
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,354
Another one of your colloquialisms
for a vagina, Tyler?

587
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,315
You think, just cos I have a low sperm
count, that I can't function normally.

588
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,274
But I don't know why it's low. It should
be high. You ain't shootin' nothin'.

589
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,678
Man, will you stop? You shouldn't make
fun of the afflicted. He got a problem.

590
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,758
- He got handicapped balls.
- Stop that, man.

591
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,919
A very well-known doctor told me that
by wearing the proper underwear, man,

592
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,430
that will cool my testicle walls,
and that can reverse my condition.

593
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,870
OK. Well, let me get you some Icy Hot.

594
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,197
Howdy Doody.
At least I have had sex in the '90s.

595
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,792
- What's that?
- You know what.

596
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,196
- Don't even try. You know I gets mine.
- Brother, please.

597
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,756
You are the no-pussy-gettingest,
talkingest-shittingest cat I know.

598
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,270
Marcus, yo, don't even try it.
You know me, for real.

599
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,392
And all I'm sayin' is that
if you ain't bangin' Jacqueline yet,

600
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,990
there's somethin' wrong with her,
or somethin' wrong with her twizzer.

601
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,430
There's nothin' wrong with Jacqueline,
and nothin' wrong with me.

602
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,313
It's gonna take
a little longer than I thought.

603
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,751
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

604
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,509
These sales conventions are really
boring. I'm not lookin' forward to it.

605
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,315
Yeah, but we're going to New Orleans.
Have you ever been to New Orleans?

606
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,796
No. It seems like it's a sexy town.

607
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,276
Yeah, it's a real... it's a romantic town.

608
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,029
You know? It's the kind of place where
you just take somebody that you love,

609
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:24,188
and just sit back, relax,
throw on the jazz, and just chill.

610
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,156
You know?

611
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,279
That's something you can do when
Jacqueline gets to town, you know.

612
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,514
- Now, where'd that come from?
- I don't know.

613
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,756
Where did that come from?
Who said that?

614
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,431
I think you said it. It sounded like it
came out of your mouth, from nowhere.

615
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,632
I just, you know, I think you're cool.

616
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,150
I like you, and
I was just being concerned.

617
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,033
- All up in my business.
- I wasn't tryin' to pry, really.

618
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,232
- Do I look like the kinda girl to pry?
- Not five minutes ago,

619
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,591
but now you look like the one.
If you looked up "pry" in the dictionary,

620
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,393
there'd be your picture next to it, like...

621
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,315
Look who's cookin' now.

622
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,636
Marcus.

623
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,434
- What's the matter with you?
- Stop it.

624
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,120
- What?
- Stop.

625
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,596
OK, OK. Stop it, Marcus.
I think that we should go home.

626
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,836
Let's go home.

627
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,828
Well, that was pretty great, huh?

628
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,235
Yeah, pretty great.

629
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,750
Well, you enjoy that mint.

630
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,713
I hope it's refreshing, and chocolaty.

631
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,636
My key won't work.

632
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,836
Shit.

633
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,273
Hey, Marcus.
Why don't you come here for a second?

634
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,154
I'm not playin'. My key really
is not working. You know?

635
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,878
Please?

636
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,158
Yes.

637
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,318
Yes.

638
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,717
- She even has pretty feet.
- Oh, yeah? How's the coochie?

639
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,559
- Man, that is crass.
- May I help you?

640
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,274
No, we're OK, we're just browsin'.

641
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,548
- He's trippin'.
- Look, I'm a realist, right?

642
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,558
If the coochie's good,
everything else falls into place.

643
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,390
It's more than sex with this girl. I dig
her - her spirit, her mind, everything.

644
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,355
You know, she could be Mrs Graham.
You think I'm jokin'. She's that bad.

645
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,550
Marcus is in love.

646
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,478
Yo. Yo, I'm gettin' this, Marcus. Step off.

647
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,319
That jacket is $1800.

648
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,032
No refunds.

649
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,392
- What, you think I can't pay for it?
- Well, there is no layaway plan.

650
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,430
We're OK. We don't need any help.

651
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,915
We don't keep cash in the store.

652
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,031
- He's a sucker, man.
- Racial.

653
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,879
- You right, man. Don't even trip on it.
- No refund?

654
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,595
What's he think, you're gonna wear it,
stink it all up to be damned,

655
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,757
- and, like, give it back to him?
- We can't get over this...

656
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,031
There are certain people
with a natural fear of black people.

657
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,037
They're programmed. Watch. Now!

658
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,118
See how frightened he was, just from
a black man screaming "now"?

659
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,913
He thought it was the end of the world.

660
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,872
- What do you think?
- People are gonna love this.

661
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,878
I think that this is gonna
be great for her image.

662
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,630
- Well, look at this one.
- Angela. Wow.

663
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,479
- You like it? Really?
- Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.

664
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,591
Great. Thank you. Guess what?

665
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,553
Marcus thinks we ought to go
to the Caribbean to shoot this.

666
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,557
The Caribbean?

667
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,272
That's expensive.

668
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,233
- I know.
- But it's nice. No, it's a nice idea.

669
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,591
- You know Marcus and his big ideas.
- I do.

670
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,639
You know, speaking of Marcus...

671
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,116
I hear he's got a real reputation.

672
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,311
Bony T told you that, right?

673
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,470
Well, Angela,

674
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,069
I can confirm that Marcus's reputation

675
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,397
is extremely well-deserved.

676
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,230
You can confirm it?
Like, you and Marcus have...?

677
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,670
God, this man, he's wonderful.
I mean, he's kind of... he's magnificent.

678
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,436
And he just happens to have
the best ass I have ever seen.

679
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,715
- Hey, babe, you got a sec?
- Marcus, hi.

680
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,955
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

681
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,358
What did I walk in on?
What are y'all talkin' about?

682
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,596
- God, we're talking about work.
- Work.

683
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,314
No, no, no.
You're both blushing. What's up?

684
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,589
Art. Art.

685
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,712
No, there's a girlishness happening.
What's up? Talk to me.

686
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,195
- Some girliness. Girliness.
- Nothing.

687
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,151
- Why you leavin'?
- It's time to go.

688
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,271
- Gerard hit it, didn't he?
- No. Hit it?

689
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,951
- Gerard could not hit it if he had a bat.
- You want to keep it a secret, huh?

690
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,231
- But he hit it. It's Gerard, isn't it?
- I don't know.

691
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,911
I came here to tell you what
a wonderful time I had in New Orleans...

692
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,715
Marcus, hon, I don't think that
we should do this in the office.

693
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,308
- What?
- I really gotta stop.

694
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,274
Get on top of the desk
and get frisky and go crazy.

695
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,434
Listen.

696
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:33,311
- You're not gettin' serious, are you?
- What you talkin' about? What is that?

697
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,796
Well, you know.
Where you want this to...

698
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,469
to grow into a relationship where...

699
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,637
God, we're together all the time,
stuff like that.

700
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,716
- Are you?
- Excuse me.

701
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,878
I-I know that you're not tellin'
me that New Orleans was a fling.

702
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,398
No. No, no.

703
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:59,435
I had a great time in New Orleans. You
know I had a great time in New Orleans.

704
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,996
- So what's the problem?
- Well, I just think that...

705
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,833
New Orleans was New Orleans,
and we should leave it at that.

706
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,394
I'm not tryin' to
pressure you or anything.

707
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,308
- No. No. No, no, no.
- I'm not proposing or anything.

708
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,796
- Of course not.
- My tuxedo isn't ironed or nothin'.

709
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,309
- I believe in takin' things slow, too.
- That's what I'm talking about.

710
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,676
I was just wonderin' when we could
see each other again, that's all.

711
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,109
I don't know. I'm kinda busy right now.

712
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,836
I just found out that I'm gonna have to
be spending a lot of time outta town,

713
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,077
so, I'll get back to you, OK?

714
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,476
You'll get back to me?

715
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,879
I don't have my schedule, my
secretary's outta town, so I'll call you.

716
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,595
"Marcus, with regards to us
doing it again, I'll get back to you."

717
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,598
That's a new one on Marcus.

718
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,554
Just don't make me wait too long,
cos it's not like I gotta sit by the phone

719
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,910
and wait for somebody
to get back to me.

720
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,397
No. No, I realise that you of all people
will not be waiting alone,

721
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,273
so I will try and get back to you soon.

722
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,633
You gonna call?

723
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,035
Hello? Yes? Yes?

724
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,115
- Hello?
- Yes?

725
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,798
- Mr Graham?
- Yes.

726
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,151
Miss Broyer asked me to tell you
she is free the evening of the 12th.

727
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,116
The 12th is three weeks from now.

728
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,879
Sorry. That's her first opening.

729
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,150
Should I pencil you in?

730
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,473
Yeah.

731
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

732
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,194
Marcus.

733
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,119
Yo, brother, man.
Gold watches, gold chains.

734
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,674
Yo, you gotta show
some gold to get that girl.

735
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,234
I already have a watch.
But thank you. Gucci.

736
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,715
- Brother, that's a nice watch.
- Thank you.

737
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,796
Watch your back.
