And remember, this mission is covert.

00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,409
So, what brings you to Hong Kong?

11
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,036
Business or pleasure?
Pleasure.

12
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,537
Business.
A little of both.

13
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,997
What kind of business?

17
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,595
On that note, will you excuse us, ladies,
because we do have work to do.

18
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,181
No, we don't.
Yes, we do.

I'm more concerned about the boss.

FDR: Definitely. Hey, you think
those girls are still here?

41
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,649
I need good love

Before you came along

44
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,575
I felt like I was dead

45
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,911

00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,461
Well, I met a sweet girl

48
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,464
She blew my mind

49
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,800
And we've been hanging' out

50
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,845
Ever since that time

51
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,015
We got good love

Sweet, sweet love

55
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,874
Here we go. So the Cortex
has minimal damage.

56
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,959
There's some calcining
around the edges.

57
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,714
However, the Tempolite has damage
and there's rusting around 300 degrees.

58
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,634
So that means the Cortex
gets the recommend.

59
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,763
See, Em? The best product always wins.

60
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,181
Oh, Lauren.
Yes.

61
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,477
I was just wondering if I might skip out
a little bit early for the holiday weekend.

62
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,271
Jerry's taking me to an alpaca farm.

63

Oh, yeah, of course.
It's a holiday. And a weekend.

64

we did manage to--

Shut up.
To-- That's me shutting up, right now.

72

of the Heinrich case...

to be covert.

for his brother's death.

Okay, good answer. Ha-ha-ha.

338
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,600
{BOTH LAUGHING}

339
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,811
So you've never killed anybody
with your bare hands.

340
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,647
Not this week.

341
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,190
Great.

342
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,443
Lauren, you're incredible.
You're not so bad yourself.

343
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:43,157
All right, I'm going to go and rent a movie
and take a cold shower.

344
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,659
I will too.
Okay.

345
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,453
And wait for your call for the next--
Five minutes?

346
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,121
{LAUGHS}

347
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,290
HENRY {ON TV}:
This is where it all started.

348
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,126
Yes, I was standing over there
by that desk.

349
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:58,130
MARTHA: No, you were sitting in the chair.
And suddenly, you started walking toward me.

350
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,424
Very slowly. Very slowly.

351
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,009
I could count every step.

352
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,428
And when you're walking towards me
very slowly...

353
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,598
...I thought, "What's the matter with him?
Can't he walk faster?"

354
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,394
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry. You take it.

355
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,688
No, no, no, that's okay. You take it.
Sure?

356
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,358
You're not going to like it. Twist ending.
You'll see it coming a mile away.

357
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:22,196
And how would you know what I like?
I know movies. And women.

358
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,116
Really?
Mm-hm.

359
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,493
Okay.

360
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,371
Well, then,
why don't you tell me what I want?

361
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,209
The Lady Vanishes? Why is that?
Mm-hm.

362
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,504
Well, firstly, you can never go wrong
with Hitchcock. Ever.

363
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,424
It's got comedy, drama, romance,
it's a thriller.

364
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,300
It's classy, but not stuffy.

365
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,763
A little obscure, so if you haven't seen it,
you'll thank me for introducing you to it.

366
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,058
If you have, you'll know
what a good choice it was.

367
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,020
Well, I have seen it.
Mm-hm.

368
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,105
And it is a really good choice.
Mm.

369
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,109
However, not as good as Rebecca,
Notorious, Vertigo...

370
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,404
...or pretty much any of his films
from 1960 to 1972.

371
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,241
In fact, it's sort of a second-tier title.

372
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,243
A second.

373
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,580
You know what? Scratch--
Look, I see you surveying the prospects.

374
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,750
That one over there in Foreign?
Too much angst.

375
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,711
This one in the sweater set,
picking out animated movies?

376
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,505
That girl will have your children named
before breakfast.

377
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,175
The problem is,
no one looks like a clean getaway.

378
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:27,261
I get it. You come in here
looking for a girl renting a movie.

379
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,723
Clearly, she doesn't have a date
for the night. We're easy targets.

380
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,434
You look like the guy
interested in a one-day rental...

381
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,562
...if you know what I mean.
If you knew anything about women...

382
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,192
...or anything about me, I'm perfectly
capable of choosing my own movies.

383
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,777
But thanks.

384
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,737
Happy hunting.

385
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,949
Hm.

386
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,954
MAN: So, sir, you want me to hack
into a video store database?

387
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,999

COMPUTER VOICE: Searching database.

388
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,837
FDR:
All right, keep on scrolling.

389
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,839
Wait. Stop. Scroll back.

Sir, how is this girl
connected to Heinrich?

Hello, everybody, I'm Lauren Scott.
Thank you so much for being here today.

394

ALL:
Good morning, Lauren.

395
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,484
We're here today to talk about grills.
Does anybody have any first impressions?

396
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,277
I like the rotisserie feature.

397
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,113
Perfect. That's very helpful.

398
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,115
FDR:
I don't think it heated up fast enough.

399
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,869
Like something was wrong with the motor,
maybe the spark was dead.

400
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,539
Actually, sir,
there's nothing wrong with the spark.

401
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,626
Some people think grills
just burst into flames at the slightest touch.

402
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,002
It doesn't work like that.

403
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,506
Does anybody have any useful opinions?

404
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,384
I thought the lid was hard to handle.
Mm-hm.

405
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,011
Ugh. The lids, what a pain, right?

406
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:56,517
I just felt the whole thing to be a bit stiff,
uptight, not really user-friendly.

407
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,061
I think it depends on the user.
Mm.

408
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,689
It so happens I have
a lot of experience with grills.

409
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,733
I'm something of a grill master.

410
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,904
Uh, this is a sophisticated grill. Not sure
you've dealt with one of those before.

411
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,825
Or maybe a grill like this
is just so scared of being burned...

412
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,537
...it stays on simmer
and never really heats up all the way.

413
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,207
Don't touch my grill.
I don't think this can handle a guy like me.

414
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,542
I think it could.
Really?

415
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,378
Easily.
Prove it. 8 p.m. Barcelona. Tomorrow.

416
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,172
I don't think so.

417
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,300
I guess I could stick around
a little longer, talk about grills.

418
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,927
Charcoal or gas,
number 19, what do you think?

419
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,430
If I say yes, will you leave?
This is my job.

420
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,599
Eight p.m. tomorrow.
Fine.

421
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,060
Fine.

on the computer? Porn?

426
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,749
I have a photograph of my girl.
I was doing the same thing.

427
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,085
A background check.
I don't know if that's creepy or romantic.

428
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,713

Want to see?

429
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,590
Yeah, sure. Want to see her?
Yeah.

431
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,303
She does, but she's
incredibly attractive with them.

432
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,888
She's a 10.
Go on three.

433
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,640

434

Of course. How could you know that?

00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,587
Did she, ahem, actually say she wanted
to go out on a date with you, though?

443
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,466
You know what? I'm going to make this
really easy. I'm going to bow out. You date her.

444
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,135
Hang on. Did she say
she wanted to go out with you?

445
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,805
It doesn't matter.
I love you. You're my best friend.

446
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,557
Yeah.
You go date her.

447
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,477
Yeah, if I got in the picture,
it wouldn't be fair.

448

as much as I am.

No, no, no.
You're perfect?

Maybe not perfect,
but damn near close...

...to perfect.
You believe that as well?

458
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,961
You don't have to bow out because of me.
I don't?

459
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,172
I'm not concerned that she's going to
fall in love with you, pal.

You are welcome.

...just let her decide.

Sure.
Yeah.

00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,062
Yeah.

00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,192
While we're at it,
why don't we put ground rules in?

468
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,194
We should.
One, I don't think...

469
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,531
...we should tell we know each other.
Two, stay out of each other's way.

to affect our friendship...

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,917
Which it won't.
...which it won't...

474
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,546
..then we walk away.
Done.

475

So, then, we have-- We have--
We have a gentleman's agreement.

Tuck.

1344

I slept with her.

1345

Yeah, well, I'm well aware of that, aren't I?
No, slept. Fell asleep.

to me before.

play families. We can play families. Right?

All right. Uh, yeah.
Good, let's play families.

It means get me a family.

a few tears when you're telling that story...

No, he didn't.

Oh, not his given name. Not at all.
"Tuck." Unusual, right?

I've got me naughty bits tucked under."

1384

just so proud that Tuck is into girls again.

a really great brother.

He is.
He saved me from becoming a swinger.

1394
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:10,486
Before Tuck stepped in, everyone in our
village used to call me "The Sausage Wallet."

"These knockers. Oh!

That was the weirdest five minutes of my life.

I'm sorry. Those people back there,
they are not my parents.

No.

1413

I wanted you to think that I had
a perfect family, so I hired some people.

Yes.

I don't know what to say about that.

I don't have any parents.
I have no family.

What?
I thought it would impress you.

1419

Okay? That's why I hired some, because
I thought that was normal. I thought--

1420
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,272
But you have a family. You have a son.

1421
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,024
Yeah.

1422
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:35,780
Okay, the truth about Joe is that
my relationship with Joe is really awful.

1423

It's really awful.

1424

When he was a little boy, it was great.
He was a puppy.

1425
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,455
He loved me to bits. Then he grew up,
now I can't reach him.

1426
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,333
He doesn't want anything
to do with me, at all.

1427
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:51,921
Okay? So I didn't want you to see that.
It's actually very embarrassing.

1428
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:56,634
So I thought I'd hire a family,
because I thought that was normal.

Right, look, I totally understand
you needing to walk away...

I'd walk away too.
