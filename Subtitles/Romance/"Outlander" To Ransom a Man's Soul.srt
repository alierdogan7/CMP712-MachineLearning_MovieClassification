1
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:41,503
Hey!

2
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:42,888
Royal salute!

3
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:45,257
Present arms!

4
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:48,260
God save King George!

5
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,515
Soldiers, your firearm!

6
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:31,863
Ye owe me a debt.

7
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:08,650
Please.

8
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:47,856
Three cheers for his
majesty, King George, hip hip!

9
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:48,773
- Huzzah!
- Hip, hip!

10
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,025
- Huzzah!
- Hip, hip!

11
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:51,026
<i>Huzzah!</i>

12
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:43,995
Easy, lad. Easy.

13
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:44,996
We're getting you out of here.

14
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:47,499
Aye!

15
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,942
Is he alive?

16
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:49,227
Aye. He needs tending.

17
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:50,979
- But it'll have to wait.
- The hell it will.

18
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:52,864
Oh, I can't believe you actually did it.

19
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,150
Those Redcoat drummer boys
were making such a racket,

20
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:57,318
the garrison didn't know we
were there, cattle and all,

21
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:59,070
until we were inside the place,.

22
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:00,822
We must make haste.

23
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:02,323
They'll be coming for us, straight away.

24
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:03,958
My god.

25
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,913
What did Randall do to you?

26
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:13,251
I don't mean to speak ill of the lad,
but he positively reeks.

27
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:15,003
It's oil of lavender.

28
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:16,721
It's used to relieve pain.

29
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:19,174
Someone tried to tend him, then?

30
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:20,759
Maybe.

31
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:22,560
Go back and watch the road behind us.

32
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:25,013
If ye see any sign of pursuit,
come running like the Devil.

33
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:26,564
And we'll have to take our chances.

34
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Jamie... Come on!

35
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:30,485
Jamie.

36
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,153
You're safe now.

37
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,439
I'm going to help you, I swear.

38
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:42,447
- Aye, get off her, man!
- Jamie!

39
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:49,337
What's wrong with ye, lad? It's Claire!

40
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:50,672
Ah, dinna touch me!

41
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:52,624
She's just trying to help ye.

42
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,630
What is he saying?

43
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,715
He's deleerit. Raving about god knows what.

44
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,468
Pardon the interruption,
but will ye be wanting tea?

45
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,136
Or can I get this wagon moving?

46
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:07,305
Ya! Ya!

47
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:41,923
Father Anselm, this is Mrs. Claire Fraser.

48
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:43,341
The father's agreed to give us shelter,

49
00:08:43,343 --> 00:08:46,144
until we can find a
more permanent situation.

50
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,096
Thank you. We're most grateful.

51
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:51,099
Think nothing of it. We shall talk later.

52
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:52,517
- I'm going to need a...
- The boy has told us

53
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,486
of your needs, and all is waiting for you.

54
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,070
Thank you.

55
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:05,697
No, no!

56
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:07,031
Jamie...

57
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:08,750
It's all right. There's more broth.

58
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:14,589
I've no doubt you can mend his body, but

59
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:17,292
there are other wounds,
not so easily dealt with.

60
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,631
His soul, I’m afraid, is in turmoil.

61
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:28,186
But if I don't set that hand,
he'll be crippled for life.

62
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:29,470
Claire...

63
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:36,561
Please. Excuse us.

64
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:52,293
Brother Paul was right.
You need your nourishment.

65
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,967
Dinna touch me.

66
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,308
Jamie, talk to me.

67
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:08,927
What did Randall do to you?

68
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,434
Too much.

69
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:19,153
And not enough.

70
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,208
You saw her leave these walls?

71
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,043
Yes.

72
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:45,296
We are both men of our word.

73
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:47,265
Drink.

74
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:55,640
Ah, ah, ah.

75
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:06,484
Let's see if we can make
you more comfortable.

76
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:14,158
This will hurt.

77
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:21,165
Mm.

78
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,439
It's all right.

79
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,860
Shh.

80
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:51,029
It's all right.

81
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,333
The worst is over now.

82
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:57,285
You'll see.

83
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:13,017
Dear god.

84
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:16,020
You are a magnificent creature.

85
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:51,172
It's like kissing a corpse.

86
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:56,177
I know you can do better.

87
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,349
Shh, shh, shh.

88
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:10,491
My men can have Claire
back here within the hour.

89
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,278
We have an agreement.

90
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,363
That I would not resist.

91
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,448
Ah.

92
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,001
So, that's your plan.

93
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:24,172
To submit, but like Christ on the cross?

94
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:32,930
Well, we will see about that.

95
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:58,539
Shh.

96
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,010
How does that feel?

97
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:21,012
Is that nice?

98
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:29,904
Oh.

99
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:44,252
Don't play the worm with me.

100
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,287
Jamie,

101
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,624
I just want this to be a
pleasant experience for us both.

102
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:00,885
Do what ye must.

103
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:05,356
Take yer pleasure and be done with it.

104
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:13,231
What I 'must'?

105
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:30,998
You think I cannot control
the darkness I inhabit?

106
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:46,480
One way or another, I will
get a response from you.

107
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:53,821
Aah!

108
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:03,581
Scream.

109
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:07,201
Scream.

110
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,123
Scream.

111
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:20,514
Scream.

112
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:30,608
Ye'd be
wise to do as she says, lad.

113
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:34,028
The laudanum will help ye
sleep through this trying time.

114
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:36,280
Whiskey will do me fine.

115
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:40,618
Jamie, I’m about to set
nine bones in your hand.

116
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:44,322
Randall made me crawl.

117
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,877
Made me beg.

118
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:56,000
Before he was done, he made
me want verra badly to be dead.

119
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:01,472
Well, you're not dead,

120
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:04,425
and I refuse to let you spend
the rest of your life a cripple.

121
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,344
So let me do my job.

122
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:08,346
Do as you wish.

123
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:15,653
It matters not to me.

124
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:17,655
Jamie.

125
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:31,919
I need water and clean cloth.

126
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:33,537
I have them ready for
you, they're over near the basins.

127
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:34,538
I cannot
control the darkness I inhabit?

128
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,923
What about thread?

129
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,541
- Clean thread, too.
- Scream.

130
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:40,211
Scream. Scream!

131
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:41,879
Scream!

132
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:49,804
During the war,
I had treated men in far worse shape,

133
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:52,056
their horrific injuries almost unfathomable

134
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:54,058
to the human mind,

135
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,728
but none of them were my husband.

136
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,281
It was a long, nerve-wracking job.

137
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:03,284
Some parts, such as the
splinting of the two fingers

138
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,821
with simple fractures, went quite easily.

139
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:09,907
Others did not. Setting his middle finger

140
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,793
required exerting considerable
force in order to draw

141
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:18,215
the ends of the splintered
bone back through the skin.

142
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:22,470
Jamie had said to me once,
"I can bear pain myself,

143
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:24,839
"but I could not bear yours.

144
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:28,142
That would take more strength than I have."

145
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:32,513
He was right. It did take strength.

146
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:34,682
I hoped that each of us had enough.

147
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:41,322
I began to lose awareness
of anything outside the job

148
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:44,775
I was doing.

149
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:47,111
I was afraid of infection, particularly,

150
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:51,031
but otherwise was fairly
sure the fingers would heal.

151
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,666
The shattered joint would likely leave him

152
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:54,285
with a stiff ring finger,

153
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:57,421
but the others might
function normally in time.

154
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,690
I will stay
with him through the night.

155
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:20,611
You'll need your strength, come.

156
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:22,696
I will send for you, should he awaken,

157
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:25,699
or there be any need.

158
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:44,895
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt your prayers.

159
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:50,951
I wasn't exactly praying, I was...

160
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:55,456
Just sitting here alone,
trying to clear my head.

161
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:57,825
Were you indeed alone?

162
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:04,715
Please.

163
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:17,811
Would you like me to hear your confession?

164
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,852
I'm not sure any of it
would make any sense to you.

165
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:26,937
Perhaps not. But I assure you,

166
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:29,907
he will understand.

167
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:38,499
My name is Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser.

168
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:47,958
Through my selfishness

169
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,379
I have brought great suffering

170
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:56,133
to both my husbands.

171
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:59,803
Go on.

172
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:03,641
Eight months ago,

173
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:08,696
I was on holiday with
my husband in Inverness,

174
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:12,983
in the year of our lord...

175
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:15,986
Nineteen hundred and forty-five.

176
00:22:25,498 --> 00:22:28,999
I
told him. Everything.

177
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:31,752
I happened
upon some standing stones...

178
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:34,138
Exactly like my husband...
Traveled back 200 years

179
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:38,309
in time... he attacked me...
Was rescued by my Highlander...

180
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:42,313
I know I was already married...
He had become a friend, and...

181
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:44,014
I found myself very much in love...

182
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:45,766
Seemed like the only
solution... he was prepared

183
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:48,485
to let me go... couldn't leave
him... I was accused of being

184
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:51,822
a witch... again, Jamie came to
my rescue... Captain Randall...

185
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:54,858
Did the most unspeakable things to him.

186
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:02,700
But it's my fault.

187
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:24,355
How marvelous. Extraordinary!

188
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,859
A miracle, perhaps.

189
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:33,781
A miracle?

190
00:23:33,816 --> 00:23:36,400
Somehow, I don't think
canon law was constructed

191
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:38,702
with my situation in mind.

192
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:40,404
True.

193
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:43,991
But our lord sees the truth in all things.

194
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:46,377
And so he knows your truth as well.

195
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:51,632
Whatever your sins might be,

196
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:54,385
have faith that they will be forgiven.

197
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:24,782
Mm.

198
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:35,959
How's our patient this morning?

199
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:38,796
Stubborn. Very stubborn.

200
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:41,515
He still refuses any food.

201
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:45,519
You need sustenance.

202
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:53,477
He has a fever.

203
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:56,230
I was afraid of that.

204
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:07,708
That's looking better.

205
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:09,710
Once we have you healed up,

206
00:25:09,745 --> 00:25:12,996
we can begin a regime
of massage and exercise,

207
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:16,667
see if we can't get that
ring finger bending properly.

208
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:18,585
We need to get his fever down.

209
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:21,972
I'll need a bucket of the
coldest water you can find.

210
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,807
Well, the burn is icy in the mornings.

211
00:25:23,843 --> 00:25:24,925
That'll do.

212
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:26,927
And also plenty of clean cloth.

213
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:28,679
I'll see you get all you need.

214
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:30,681
Thank you.

215
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:36,436
You canna save a man

216
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:39,189
that doesna want saving.

217
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:48,031
Hey. Go on.

218
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:51,502
Staying sober isna going to
heal Jamie any faster, eh?

219
00:25:51,537 --> 00:25:54,538
It's not his wounds I’m worried about.

220
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,839
It's the not eating.

221
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,508
Same thing happened to my uncle.

222
00:25:57,543 --> 00:25:59,710
Tree fell on him. His arm.

223
00:25:59,712 --> 00:26:01,545
Lost it up to the shoulder.

224
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:03,630
Couldna stop fretting about it.

225
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:06,016
Refused to take even a mouthful of bread.

226
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:07,634
What happened to him?

227
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:11,722
Starved himself to death.

228
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:15,475
Not that I’m comparing Jamie to...

229
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:16,894
Ow!

230
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,145
Hmm?

231
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:08,528
Hmm?

232
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:44,531
Aah.

233
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:47,317
Am I close?

234
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:53,657
Have you reached your limit yet?

235
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:12,843
What shall I do with you?

236
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,816
Claire.

237
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:24,021
What is her power?

238
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:28,825
Possesses you even now.

239
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:32,663
What is her secret? Tell me.

240
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,037
She's gone.

241
00:28:50,382 --> 00:28:53,433
There's no more Claire.

242
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:05,729
Then are you mine?

243
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,068
Are you mine?

244
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:17,374
You...

245
00:29:20,713 --> 00:29:24,247
There's... only you.

246
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:22,806
Show me.

247
00:30:22,808 --> 00:30:24,975
Show me you're mine.

248
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:26,977
Huh?

249
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:32,065
Show me.

250
00:30:41,827 --> 00:30:43,827
Do it.

251
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:28,338
I spotted two Redcoat patrols.

252
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:29,756
But they dinna see you?

253
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:30,957
No. One was headed south,

254
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:32,092
the other east.

255
00:31:32,127 --> 00:31:33,460
Lucky for us.

256
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:35,045
Won't be long
before they head north.

257
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:37,964
And a monastery's no place for a fight.

258
00:31:38,016 --> 00:31:40,217
It's time we made plans.

259
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:43,770
It's clear Jamie's not thriving here.

260
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:45,605
Go where?

261
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:47,724
There's no place safe for ye in Scotland.

262
00:31:47,726 --> 00:31:49,976
Not Leoch, not Lallybroch.

263
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:51,945
Ye'll have to flee the country.

264
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,114
The MacKenzies know people in Paris.

265
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:56,733
They can take ye in, provide shelter, aye?

266
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:58,869
There are Frasers in France, as well.

267
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:00,787
Jamie and I have a cousin.

268
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:01,955
The man's a merchant.

269
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,707
He couldna fight sleep.

270
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:05,542
You need someone who can defend against...

271
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:07,244
Mistress Claire.

272
00:32:07,296 --> 00:32:09,212
Do you not have yer own family in France?

273
00:32:09,248 --> 00:32:10,413
Was that not where you were headed

274
00:32:10,465 --> 00:32:12,716
when we first encountered ye?

275
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,217
Perhaps they would take ye in?

276
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:17,170
Yes, but they were relatives
of my late husband, and

277
00:32:17,222 --> 00:32:20,340
most likely wouldn't welcome
me in my current circumstances.

278
00:32:20,392 --> 00:32:23,093
I think Jamie would prefer to be
with members of the Fraser clan.

279
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:24,561
- No offense.
- None taken.

280
00:32:24,596 --> 00:32:26,263
The offer stands.

281
00:32:26,315 --> 00:32:29,516
Aye, the MacKenzies will
always stand with ye.

282
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:31,184
I know they will.

283
00:32:31,236 --> 00:32:32,819
Thank you.

284
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:35,822
Then I best secure us a ship.

285
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,245
Jamie.

286
00:32:55,043 --> 00:32:57,627
Murtagh's gone to find a boat.

287
00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:01,348
For France, where ye can
forget this ever happened.

288
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:08,638
Ye need to keep yer strength up.

289
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,141
Ye must eat for...

290
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:16,279
For mistress Claire's
sake, if not for yer own.

291
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:19,482
She loves you fiercely,

292
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:22,235
and ye have her worried sick.

293
00:33:25,157 --> 00:33:29,326
Tell me what I can do to help.

294
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:31,044
Jamie.

295
00:33:37,135 --> 00:33:41,004
Yer blade.

296
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:43,673
Hand it over.

297
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:45,642
And what would ye be needing it for?

298
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:51,014
To put me out of this black misery.

299
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:53,516
Jamie, ye don't mean it.

300
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:58,271
It's not a matter I wish to discuss.

301
00:33:58,323 --> 00:34:01,024
- Now hand it over.
- No.

302
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:04,027
- Give it to me!
- No, I won't!

303
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:10,500
I was just coming to see you.

304
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:12,919
<i>Got us passage on a ship, the Cristabel.</i>

305
00:34:12,954 --> 00:34:14,087
It's a bit dear.

306
00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:17,340
50 coin in gold. But it's safe.

307
00:34:17,376 --> 00:34:21,044
Willie said Jamie asked him to kill him.

308
00:34:24,383 --> 00:34:26,850
Did you know?

309
00:34:26,885 --> 00:34:29,803
I wanted to tell ye,

310
00:34:29,855 --> 00:34:34,140
but he made me pledge not to.

311
00:34:34,192 --> 00:34:36,810
I've been praying ye'd
be able to talk some sense

312
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:40,196
into the lad. That he'd come 'round.

313
00:34:40,232 --> 00:34:42,649
Why?

314
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:44,734
Why does he want to die so badly?

315
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:49,205
He's been tortured.

316
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:52,375
Raped.

317
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:55,462
Isn't that reason enough?

318
00:34:55,497 --> 00:34:57,464
No.

319
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:02,335
Aye.

320
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:11,811
The lad's taken his share of punishment,

321
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:15,565
but I can't help feeling
there's more here than we know.

322
00:35:22,774 --> 00:35:25,992
Oh, I’m sorry, Claire.

323
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:29,946
Truly sorry.

324
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:34,667
I'd never do anything to hurt that lad...

325
00:35:34,703 --> 00:35:38,505
Unless...

326
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,791
Unless?

327
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:46,679
I'll no watch Jamie waste away.

328
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:50,683
Die like an animal in the woods
with his foot caught in a trap.

329
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,302
If it comes to the time

330
00:35:52,304 --> 00:35:54,804
when he's past the point of healing...

331
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:07,484
There we go.

332
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:11,488
Feeling better?

333
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,655
Whoa.

334
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:14,374
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

335
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:15,992
Ye collapsed like a sack of grain.

336
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:18,962
Scared the pish right out of me.

337
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:20,914
Pardon me, brother.

338
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:25,635
What am I going to do?

339
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:29,589
About Jamie.

340
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:33,343
Well, his wounds are progressing nicely,

341
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:36,846
but his soul remains possessed by darkness.

342
00:36:36,848 --> 00:36:39,849
I fear he will writhe in torment

343
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,652
until he makes an end of himself,

344
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:46,022
unless he can be led back into the light.

345
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:50,360
I don't mean to disagree with
ye, brother, but I know Jamie.

346
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:52,162
And light or no light,

347
00:36:52,197 --> 00:36:55,365
none can lead him where
he doesna want to go.

348
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:57,283
Are ye saying the lad's doomed?

349
00:36:57,335 --> 00:37:00,170
I'm saying that maybe
the only way to save Jamie

350
00:37:00,205 --> 00:37:03,873
is for someone to step
into the darkness with him.

351
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,958
Breathe in.

352
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:41,327
No!

353
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:42,328
No!

354
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,913
Oil of lavender.

355
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,465
Smells familiar, doesn't it?

356
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,300
What are you doing? Leave me be.

357
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:49,552
I've left you be for far too long,

358
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:51,588
treated you too gently.

359
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,473
That doesn't work with you, does it?

360
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:54,724
No, you only respond to strength.

361
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:55,758
Why are ye doing this?

362
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,477
You know why!

363
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:59,012
To find out exactly what
happened in that room

364
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:00,680
between you and Randall.

365
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:01,931
What you're holding back.

366
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:03,850
You already know.

367
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:05,435
The obvious, yes, but what else?

368
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:06,936
There is no "else."

369
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:08,438
Then why can't you look at me?

370
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,323
Look at me.

371
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:11,524
-  Do it!
- Look at me!

372
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:12,275
No! No!

373
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:19,282
Aah!

374
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:24,837
Claire, please! I don't want to hurt you.

375
00:38:24,873 --> 00:38:25,955
It's a bit late for that, isn't it?

376
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:27,373
My husband wants to kill himself

377
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:28,958
and he won't tell me why!

378
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,044
Do you want me to hate you?

379
00:38:31,096 --> 00:38:32,795
- Do you want me to hate you?
- No!

380
00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:44,807
He branded you?

381
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:52,448
Jamie...

382
00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:53,866
What he did to you doesn't mean that...

383
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:55,868
Ye're wrong.

384
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:06,329
He didn't brand me.

385
00:39:09,384 --> 00:39:12,051
I did it myself.

386
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:16,255
We can remove it.

387
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:17,507
No.

388
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,509
You canna understand.

389
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:25,148
Claire. It wasn't...

390
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:29,402
Randall didn't just use force
to get what he wanted from me.

391
00:39:34,693 --> 00:39:36,659
Claire, it wasn't...

392
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:43,032
Go on.

393
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:45,001
Say it.

394
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:53,176
He made love to me, Claire.

395
00:39:57,799 --> 00:40:00,717
And I...

396
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:06,356
What?

397
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:53,102
Breathe in.

398
00:40:55,774 --> 00:40:58,741
That's oil of lavender.

399
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,689
These are Claire's hands.

400
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:35,478
Think of Claire.

401
00:41:38,366 --> 00:41:41,067
Think of your wife.

402
00:42:35,006 --> 00:42:36,956
Wait for me.

403
00:43:20,385 --> 00:43:22,335
Claire's here.

404
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:54,450
Say my name, Jamie.

405
00:43:57,455 --> 00:43:59,171
Say my name.

406
00:44:03,344 --> 00:44:05,044
Claire.

407
00:44:49,807 --> 00:44:51,507
I understand.

408
00:44:54,012 --> 00:44:57,013
How could she ever forgive you?

409
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,858
I couldna help myself, Claire.

410
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:14,497
It felt... so good.

411
00:45:14,532 --> 00:45:17,033
Not to be in pain.

412
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:24,290
Were you afraid I wouldn't forgive you?

413
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:29,795
There's nothing to forgive.

414
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:33,933
Jamie, it's...

415
00:45:33,968 --> 00:45:35,968
It's all right.

416
00:45:38,556 --> 00:45:41,524
Don't you see?

417
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:49,782
I cannot be your husband any longer.

418
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:52,451
And I will not be less to you.

419
00:45:52,487 --> 00:45:54,453
You did what was necessary to survive.

420
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:56,288
- That's all.
- No.

421
00:45:56,324 --> 00:45:58,074
<i>No, he broke me.</i>

422
00:45:58,126 --> 00:46:00,292
He broke me, Claire.

423
00:46:00,328 --> 00:46:03,996
He knew it. We both did.

424
00:46:04,048 --> 00:46:07,083
You belong to no one else but me.

425
00:46:07,135 --> 00:46:09,502
And I belong to you.

426
00:46:09,554 --> 00:46:11,670
Nothing will ever change that.

427
00:46:11,723 --> 00:46:15,224
Those are just weak words, Claire.

428
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:25,684
I lie here,

429
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:27,103
feeling I will die without your touch,

430
00:46:27,105 --> 00:46:28,487
but when you do touch me,

431
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:31,440
I want to vomit with shame.

432
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:32,992
No!

433
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:35,111
You are my husband, James Fraser.

434
00:46:35,163 --> 00:46:38,614
How dare you give up on me now!

435
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,667
You swore to me, you,
you promised me the...

436
00:46:41,702 --> 00:46:44,620
The protection of your body if need be.

437
00:46:44,622 --> 00:46:48,207
Well, Randall had your body,

438
00:46:48,259 --> 00:46:52,628
but I’ll be damned if
he has your soul as well!

439
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,298
You're mine.

440
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,269
And we are meant to be together.

441
00:47:00,304 --> 00:47:03,472
It's the only explanation
I have for all this.

442
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:06,692
It's... the only way I can wrap
my mind around what's happened

443
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:10,479
all these past months.

444
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:13,232
It's all been for you and me.

445
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,331
But if you take away

446
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,001
the one, last thing that makes sense to me,

447
00:47:37,508 --> 00:47:40,342
and I will die.

448
00:47:40,344 --> 00:47:43,062
With you, right here, now.

449
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,282
How can you have me like this?

450
00:48:03,334 --> 00:48:06,001
I will have you any way I can.

451
00:48:08,706 --> 00:48:10,789
Always.

452
00:48:31,896 --> 00:48:33,028
The laudanum, please.

453
00:48:33,064 --> 00:48:36,065
No. I want to be awake

454
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:38,701
when you cut him out of me.

455
00:48:38,736 --> 00:48:40,069
And get on with it.

456
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:16,438
I'll miss you, mistress.

457
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,158
We shall never find another
healer the likes of you.

458
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:24,196
Thank you, Willie.

459
00:49:27,835 --> 00:49:30,202
You're a true friend.

460
00:49:30,254 --> 00:49:33,872
I doubt everyone is as sad
as you are to see us go.

461
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:35,507
Well, it's nothing personal, mistress,

462
00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:37,960
but keeping you and Jamie out of harm's way

463
00:49:38,012 --> 00:49:39,878
proves to be a full-time occupation.

464
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:41,380
That's very true.

465
00:49:41,432 --> 00:49:43,132
Time to go.

466
00:49:45,853 --> 00:49:47,553
Ah, mistress Claire?

467
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:52,641
May I...

468
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:54,193
Kiss you farewell?

469
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:55,978
No, you may not.

470
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,817
It is far too final.

471
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:04,820
<i>You may kiss me Au revoir.</i>

472
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:08,624
Hey, hey...

473
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:09,708
Ugh! Ah!

474
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:12,328
- I'm so sorry.
- Seriously.

475
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,163
Apologies, mistress, I...

476
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:15,881
I lost my head.

477
00:50:25,009 --> 00:50:27,176
Good-bye to you, Claire.

478
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:29,178
God bless.

479
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,180
Very gallant.

480
00:50:31,232 --> 00:50:34,350
See, that's how you take
your leave of a lady.

481
00:50:34,352 --> 00:50:35,517
All right.

482
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:37,853
Piss off, the lot of ye.

483
00:50:42,693 --> 00:50:45,527
Ye happen to run into the
rightful king across the water,

484
00:50:45,529 --> 00:50:48,831
you tell him Angus Mhor sends his best, eh?

485
00:50:50,368 --> 00:50:54,169
King James is in Italy, ye fool, no France.

486
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:56,755
No, I meant if ye go...

487
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:58,457
I meant if ye go to Italy!

488
00:50:58,509 --> 00:51:00,626
Yer arse, ye did.

489
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:40,466
Thought I'd be the one to be

490
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:43,001
puking my guts out over the side, and

491
00:51:43,054 --> 00:51:45,337
here you are, as green as rotten fish.

492
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:47,389
Please.

493
00:51:47,425 --> 00:51:49,808
Fish is the last thing I
want to think about right now.

494
00:51:49,844 --> 00:51:51,226
Hm.

495
00:52:00,104 --> 00:52:04,156
Should I get a bucket?

496
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:07,443
Glad to see you're regaining
your sense of humor.

497
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:09,411
I'm trying.

498
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,287
Will be all right, won't it?

499
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:22,624
<i>I mean, we'll be all right?</i>

500
00:52:22,626 --> 00:52:24,343
I'll see to it.

501
00:52:28,299 --> 00:52:32,184
We're headed into an
unknown future, and I...

502
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:34,103
Aye.

503
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:36,305
I know what you mean.

504
00:52:36,307 --> 00:52:39,024
What are we to do in France?

505
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:46,815
It won't be forever, Claire.

506
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:49,485
Someday we'll return to Scotland.

507
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:53,822
That I promise ye.

508
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:58,160
Do you know what's going
to happen in Scotland?

509
00:52:58,162 --> 00:53:00,879
The rising. Culloden.

510
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:06,251
The end of the highland culture.

511
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:09,004
What can we do but play our part?

512
00:53:17,515 --> 00:53:22,434
What if we could stop it from happening?

513
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:26,822
The rising, Culloden... What
if we could stop all of it?

514
00:53:26,857 --> 00:53:29,358
Change the future?

515
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,276
The two of us?

516
00:53:31,328 --> 00:53:33,695
That's madness, is it not?

517
00:53:33,747 --> 00:53:36,999
We have to try.

518
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:40,752
The rising starts with prince Charles.

519
00:53:40,788 --> 00:53:43,872
And right now, the Bonnie
Prince is in France.

520
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:46,758
I believe we can do anything we want.

521
00:53:46,794 --> 00:53:50,712
Just as long as we're together.

522
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:58,020
It will take some thought.

523
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:12,651
There's something else.

524
00:54:12,703 --> 00:54:15,404
Ye mean besides changing the future?

525
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:19,992
I'm not sure I’m ready to hear it.

526
00:54:20,044 --> 00:54:23,745
I've been wondering how to tell you this.

527
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,468
Murtagh assures me that

528
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:31,253
once we're underway, you'll be too seasick

529
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:34,006
to have a conversation.

530
00:54:40,431 --> 00:54:43,398
I'm pregnant.

531
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:49,104
But...

532
00:54:49,106 --> 00:54:51,106
You said you were unable to.

533
00:54:51,108 --> 00:54:53,825
Apparently, I was wrong.

534
00:55:02,836 --> 00:55:04,786
Are you happy?

535
00:55:12,963 --> 00:55:19,184
I never thought I'd be able
to say such a thing again, but

536
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:21,270
yes.

537
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:23,438
Yes!

538
00:55:23,474 --> 00:55:24,806
Yes!

539
00:55:24,808 --> 00:55:27,526
<i>I'm verra happy indeed, sassenach!</i>
