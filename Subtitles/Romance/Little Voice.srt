Timid little thing, it was.
No bigger... than your thumb.

Too scared even to leave his cage.

888
00:53:44,706 --> 00:53:48,164
But what she did was so simple.

889
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:52,414
All she did was keep
it shaded and safe...

890
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:55,706
at all times,

891
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:59,331

893

it gave her his heart.

But before it flew to its freedom,

897
00:54:19,373 --> 00:54:22,706
it stopped... on the window ledge.

898
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:26,664
Then it turned to her...

899
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:29,706
