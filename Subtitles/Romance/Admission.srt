So, we're breaking records

naturally,

67

number one for so long.

she has other plans.

I'll tell you
what I'd like to know.

235
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,796
Why should I apply
to an elitist institution

of anti-black, anti-gay,
and anti-female oppression?

Well, actually,
I reject that stereotype...

Speaking of rejection,
don't you reject
99.9% of your applicants?

it's an aberration.

Wouldn't you be better off

247
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,124

Sure, sitting in
a room and reading books

Just how will you
leave the planet better?

271
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,053
Will you eradicate disease?

272
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,855

Of course not.
It's your application.

00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,421
Maybe I should apply then.

like a cool place.

It's very cool.

295

I should apply?

on a little walkabout,
you know?

298
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,934
Yes, yes.
You should apply.

And if you
would like
to visit the campus,

300

up with an undergrad

the night in his room.
Oh.

302
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:12,377
Then you could hang out
and get to know each other.

303
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,246
Um, I don't really hang
out with the applicants.

That's not how it works.
Right.

Because there's
over 20,000 of them.

if she named me that,

Except a lot
of people are named Sophie.

don't even know
what their name means.

00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,002
Mom, it's me.

340
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,305
SUSANNAH: Who?

341
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,373
How many people
call you Mom?

342
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,577
Why didn't you tell
me you were coming?

343
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,679
I left a message.
I was visiting
a school nearby.

344
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,414
SUSANNAH: I never check
my messages.

345
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,649
Ah, it's a good policy.

346
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,085
Thought I'd spend the night
if it's all right with you.

347
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,154
I've got
to get up very early

348
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,790
and then hit a few schools
and race back
for Mark's department lunch.

349
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,760
How can you stand
those English
department gatherings?

350
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:10,061
What could be more dull?

351
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,096
Sometimes
you make sacrifices

352
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,132
for the person
you've been living
with for 10 years.

353
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,234
That's what a healthy
relationship is, Mom.

354
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,235
(CHUCKLES) Thank God
I'm not in one of those.

355
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,303
Yes. Thank God.

356
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,639
If I had to do what
I'm supposed to be doing
every minute of my life,

357
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,375
like you do,
I'd kill myself.

358
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,247
Did you just
say if you were me
you would kill yourself?

359
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,548
Portia,
don't exaggerate.

360
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,717
I'm working on my bike.

361
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,186
You know, they
actually have stores

362
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,754
where you can buy
bikes already made.

363
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,222
And did you know
that women

364
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,058
are the only exploited
group in history

365
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,226
to have been
idealized
into powerlessness?

They're not skinny.
They're lean.

371
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,843
Dogs are too
dependent on humans.
I'm not their slave.

372
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,244
They can get
their own damn food.

They're meant to be hunters.

These? Fake.

381
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,402
Fake?
You mean you
had a boob job?

382
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,171
No, no,
I had a mastectomy.

383
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,739
These are prosthetic.

384
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,741
I was wondering,
you know, women who
have really big breasts,

385
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,478
I thought, "I'd like
to see what that is like."

386
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,481
And I tell you,
they get so in the way,
it's unbelievable.

387
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,883
I'm thinking of trading
them in for a mid-size.

388
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,818
When? When did you
have a mastectomy?

389
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,856
I don't know.
Five weeks ago, or so.
Who keeps track?

390
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,824
They found a lump,
it was aggressive.

391
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,826
Hadn't spread yet.
I'm aggressive, too.

392
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,729
So I said, "What the hell?
Why push my luck?
Take 'em both."

393
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,432
Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,300
I am telling you.

I would have driven
you to the hospital.

Portia, I cabbed it.
I'm okay.

398
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:11,482
You know, I'm thinking,
you should start
calling me Susannah.

their kids' acceptance

is the final referendum
on their parenting skills.

this under control!
Go inside.

under control, Portia.
You never have.

I'm just going to get
into my car, very slowly,

at returning e-mails.

the finest young minds
in the nation for us?

I love this.
I love this bean salad.

So simple, but it just works.

Yeah. Beans.

make it after all.

00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,365
Balakian.

1016
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,000
Balakian.

1017
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,303
Balakian.
Balakian.

1018
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,738
I think.

1019
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,741
You didn't mean
to put "High Consider,"
did you?

1020
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,710
Um, let me see.

1021
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,215
No, that's right.

1022
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,184
But he has
D's and F's
and suspensions.

1023
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:52,221
But did you
notice that he also got
fives on all eight AP exams

1024
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:55,191
without ever
taking any AP courses?

1025
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:58,127
Yes. I'm going
to investigate that.
That's impossible.

1026
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:02,765
No, apparently not,
if the child in question
is a unique, special child.

1027
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,502
This isn't a child.
It's an applicant.

1028
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,637
He's got no
extracurriculars at all.

1029
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,373
The counselor
at his old high school
said he was shocked

1030
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,041
Jeremiah was even
applying to college.

1031
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:13,676
He's an autodidact.

1032
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,545
He's an advanced reader
from the age of eight.

1033
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:21,684
Leonardo da Vinci
was an autodidact.
So was Benjamin Franklin.

1034
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,453
Oh, did this Balakian kid
discover electricity
or paint the  <i>Mona Lisa?</i>

1035
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,322
I must have missed
that in his file.

1036
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:27,790
He's a great kid.

1037
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,525
CLARENCE: Portia, dear,

1038
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,660
take a deep breath.

1039
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:32,695
Teamwork, remember?

1040
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,163
Of course.

1041
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,365
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

1042
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,734
I forgot
you're in a
very fragile state.

1043
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,404
Maybe you'd like
to step outside
and see how fragile I am.

1044
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,510
Only kidding!
Only kidding.

1045
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:50,780
Just a little levity
to enhance the teamwork.

1046
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,717
Thank you for
your thoughts, Corinne.

1047
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,120
(LAUGHS)

1048
00:50:58,122 --> 00:50:59,755
He's never getting in.
Never.

1049
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,657
Calm down.
There's something
great I want to show you.

1050
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,626
It turns out Jeremiah was
a state champion in...

1051
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:06,729
You know what?
It's better if you
see it for yourself.

1052
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,697
He's gonna be doing it
at Nelson's birthday party.

1053
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:12,301
<i>intellectual passion.</i>
<i>Everything</i>
<i>the books talk about.</i>

1054
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:13,636
Oh, State champion!
Thank God.

1055
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:18,240
<i>So, I'll send you</i>
<i>the address</i>
<i>to Nelson's birthday party.</i>

1056
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,608
It's at my parents' house.

1057
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,243
I'll be there.
Good.

1058
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,147
Is she coming to my party?
Mmm-hmm.

1059
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,218
Why do you like
her so much?

1060
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,487
I don't know.
She's weird.

1061
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:32,688
She is indeed.

1062
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,256
Doesn't matter anyway.
Right?

1063
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,391
Sure it matters.

1064
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:42,431
But about this
Spanish test.

1065
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,467
This is your third
"try harder" in a row.

1066
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:47,536
<i>Señor</i>Garcia says you have
an aptitude for languages.

1067
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:48,571
What if I don't?

1068
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,441
What if I don't have
an aptitude for languages?

1069
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,610
What if I'm not
a genius like Jeremiah?

1070
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,346
I don't want you
to be a genius,
I'm not a genius,

1071
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,881
but I want you to be able
to get by in the world.

1072
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,616
Whatever.
<i>En español.</i>

1073
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,585
Whatever! I have class.

1074
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:08,157
Even Beckett emerged
from Gogol's  <i>Overcoat.</i>

1075
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,692
Not to mention Pinter...

1076
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:11,360
PORTIA: Professor Polokov.
Yes.

1077
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,562
Portia Nathan.
Yes, the sad lady.

1078
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,364
The sad lady?
That's not really
how I think of myself.

1079
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:16,699
How is your mother?

1080
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:18,400
She's fine.

1081
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,703
So, I wonder,
would you consider

1082
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:23,706
conducting some supplementary
admissions interviews?

1083
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,708
A scholar
of your stature
would carry

1084
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,676
a huge amount of weight
with the committee.

1085
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,880
In fact, there is one
extremely unusual applicant

1086
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:33,582
who's shown a strong interest
in literature and philosophy.

1087
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:36,852
Why would I want to speak
with a high school student?

1088
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:40,856
Of course, perhaps
we could make some
sort of arrangement.

1089
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,691
SUSANNAH: I can't believe
you're pimping me.

1090
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:45,895
I'm not pimping you.
He's a fan of your writing.

1091
00:52:45,897 --> 00:52:48,430
And I need him
to meet this applicant.

1092
00:52:48,432 --> 00:52:50,499
Besides, when's the last time
you went to a party?

1093
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,701
With racist jockey
statues? Never.

1094
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:53,769
Yeah, those are
pretty weird.

1095
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,478
Hey, Portia!
Thanks for coming
to my party!

1096
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,746
Hi, Nelson,
happy birthday!

1097
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,216
Hey! I'm glad you
could make it.

1098
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,185
So, this is
your parents' place?

1099
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,820
Hmm. Yeah.
Well, my mom's now.

1100
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:14,190
My dad passed
away a few months ago.

1101
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,457
Oh, I'm sorry.
No.

1102
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,561
It's nice to
see you again.

1103
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:20,229
You're not packing heat
by any chance, are you?

1104
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:21,497
Should I be?

1105
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:22,631
No, we're all friendlies.

1106
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,667
So, what is this?

1107
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:27,870
That is a fossil
from the Jurassic era.

1108
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,873
It's been in the same place
for 150 million years.

1109
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,208
Oh, cool!

1110
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,443
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

1111
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:35,678
Mom, I would like
you to meet...

1112
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,880
I'm Johnny's mother,
Mrs. Pressman.

1113
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:43,519
Ah, no. No, we are friends.
Just friendly acquaintances.
Portia Nathan.

1114
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:45,754
Of course.
What am I thinking?

1115
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:51,427
He can't love anything
that's less than
a 10-hour flight from JFK.

1116
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,761
Maybe we don't have to go.
Right, Grandma?

1117
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,230
Nelson.

1118
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,265
You're absolutely
right, Nelson.

1119
00:53:56,267 --> 00:54:00,402
There's nothing wrong
with staying in the same
place for a while.

1120
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,439
Ask Portia. She's
been in the same
job for 16 years!

1121
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:04,940
Yeah. And it's
a travesty, Nelson.

1122
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:07,676
Portia was president
of her high school class.

1123
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:09,612
Mom.
And she resigned
in protest over

1124
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:11,547
funding
for the girls'
sports program.

1125
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:14,383
She led
a school-wide walkout.

1126
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:15,684
And the relevance
of all this is?

1127
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:20,256
When you were nine months old,
you could walk.

1128
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,991
She actually walked.

1129
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:25,527
I don't mean
just stumble walking
like an infant or a toddler.

1130
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:27,763
She walked with
absolute certainty.

1131
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,399
One day I saw her tumble
over her shoelaces, John,

1132
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:32,768
she did not cry,
she didn't fall down,

1133
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,939
she sat down, carefully,
tied her shoelaces
in a double knot...

1134
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,941
(LAUGHING)
...got up and kept going.

1135
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,576
At nine months old.

1136
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:42,378
There are a lot
of holes in that story.

1137
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,748
You were fearless.
You were born an Amazon.

1138
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,516
That's amazing.
I love it!

1139
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:49,652
And what makes you think
she needs your approval?

1140
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:52,521
Okay, that's
enough crazytown.

1141
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:53,756
When Johnny got
admitted to Harvard Law...

1142
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:55,424
Oh, God.

1143
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:58,694
...he decided to go
and live in Outer
Mongolia instead.

1144
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,763
Outer Mongolia?
You know what, Portia,

1145
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:02,564
I'm with you,
enough crazytown.

1146
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:05,901
Have another vat
of gin there, Mom.

1147
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:08,671
Ms. Nathan,
Vladimir Polokov.

1148
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,047
You are just as
beautiful today
as you were 30 years ago.

1149
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:20,349
I just had a mastectomy.

1150
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,451
I was just translated
into Finnish.

Brilliant.

1154
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,857
May I get you
some iced tea?

1155
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,893
Or something stronger,
perhaps?

1156
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,429
Why not.
I'll stroll with you.

1157
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:36,598
I'd love to.
It would be a pleasure.

1158
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,337
It was a pleasure.
Your lawn jockeys
are just outstanding.

1159
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:42,404
Aren't they fun?

1160
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,546
And now, with a special
performance for Nelson
on his big day...

1161

the act that won him
honorable mention

00:55:57,121 --> 00:56:00,456

state championships,

1168
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,536
I want to dedicate
this performance to Nelson.

1169
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,904
Happy birthday, pal.

1170
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,942
Honorable mention?
I thought you said he won.

1171
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:21,443
He was robbed.

René Descartes.

00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:25,981
Say, hello, René.

1174

1178
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,763
Did you say you're pink,
therefore you're ham?

1179
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:43,732
Do you have any advice
for a young man, René?

00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:50,139
Whatever you do,
don't put the horse
before Descartes.

1181
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:51,974
(LAUGHING)

1182
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:58,414
Hey, do you guys
want to see Descartes
philosophize backwards?

1183
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,984
I think, therefore I am.

1184
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,018
Oh, God.

1185
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,053
That's terrible.

1186
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,561
What was that?

1187
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:14,129
Come on, that showed
originality, depth.

1188
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:15,664
Are you kidding me?

1189
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:16,698
Here, from the
Island of Misfit Toys,

1190
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,000
we bring you
Jeremiah Balakian!

1191
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:19,134
Are those birds?

1192
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:20,669
Those are doves.

1193
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:21,804
For the party?

1194
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:24,006
No. You know,
my mom has a dove room.

1195
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,876
Uh, by the way,
I know that wasn't
a perfect showcase,

1196
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,445
but he can't pretend
to be somebody he's not.

1197
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,613
Yes, he can.
You should try
it sometimes.

1198
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,782
It's how humans behave
here on planet Earth!

1199
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,617
I know how humans
behave on planet Earth

1200
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,486
because I've actually
lived a few places
on planet Earth.

1201
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,688
Wait! God.
Here, help me.

1202
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,756
Aren't you ready yet?

1203
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:41,990
I'm lighting them
as fast as I can!

1204
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:44,893
Hurry up!
Do you like the cake?

1205
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:46,128
It's very patriotic!

1206
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,664
Nelson's idea.

1207
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,866
Ow, how many frigging
candles are on this cake?

1208
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:53,702
Oh, Fifty. You know,
it was my mom's idea.

1209
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:55,871
Polokov was
looking at Jeremiah
like he had two heads!

1210
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:57,673
Well, that's his
problem, isn't it?

1211
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:58,907
Look, I want Jeremiah
to go to Princeton,

1212
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,843
because he wants
to go to Princeton,

1213
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,478
and I actually think
he'd do great there,

1214
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,479
but if he doesn't
get into Princeton,

1215
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:07,182
well, that's fine, too,
because where
you went to school,

1216
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:09,751
and what your background is,
that is just a box,
and I reject it.

1217
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:12,554
I reject being put
into a box, okay?

1218
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,563
Hi.
Hi, Mom.

1219
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:22,764
How did it go?
It was good.

1220
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:34,042
Mr. and Mrs. Balakian?
I'm Portia Nathan.

1221
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:36,111
Oh.
I want to say
thank you so much

1222
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:38,280
for everything
that you have
done for this boy.

1223
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,716
You're wonderful people.

1224
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,254
Uh, she's from Princeton.

1225
00:58:45,256 --> 00:58:46,755
Oh!

1226
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:48,524
Well, you're welcome.

1227
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:49,791
I love you.

1228
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,527
Okay.

1229
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:53,028
Uh, bye.

1230
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:04,806
Portia.
(SCREAMS)

1231
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,041
What are you doing here?

1232
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,643
I want to come
live with you.

1233
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:10,546
Why in God's name
would you want
to live with me?

1234
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,915
Because you're a normal,
boring adult.

1235
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:15,017
I bet you'd
take me
to Chuck E. Cheese!

1236
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,919
What makes you
think I'm so boring?

1237
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,621
You just are.
It's good!

1238
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:21,323
At your age, you're
supposed to be boring!

1239
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:22,591
I am the same age
as your dad.

1240
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:26,562
JOHN:  <i>Hello.</i>
<i>John, it's Portia.</i>
<i>I have Nelson.</i>

1241
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:27,796
<i>You do?</i>
<i>He's fine.</i>

1242
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,197
<i>He is?</i>
<i>Yes, he's fine.</i>

1243
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,065
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

1244
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,944
Nelson, you know how much
I love this statue, right?

1245
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,779
Yeah.

1246
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:45,714
You rode a horse
three days through

1247
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:47,883
Outer Mongolia
in the pouring rain,

1248
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,785
living off of mare's
milk to bring it back.

1249
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,119
That's right.

1250
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:53,088
And I've dragged
it place to place,

1251
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,324
across the world,
ever since I was 22.

1252
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:03,265
That is nothing,
nothing compared
to how much I love you!

1253
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:06,068
Please don't scare
me like that again.

1254
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,936
Why? You do it
all the time.

1255
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,137
Hide out in cars?

1256
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,706
Run away!

1257
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:15,310
And going across the world
and helping people
is not running away.

1258
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:19,047
I know,
but why can't we ever
just do what I want?

1259
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:21,783
Because you are a kid,
I'm an adult,

1260
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,653
what I say
in this house goes!

1261
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,962
(DOOR BANGS SHUT)

1262
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,999
This parenthood thing.

1263
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,102
Oh, it's a disaster.

1264
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:41,403
So I hear.

1265
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:43,772
I'm screwing it up.

1266
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:45,374
Am I screwing it up?

1267
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:47,275
You're asking me?

1268
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,945
I don't know, it's just,
Nelson and I have
always traveled.

1269
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:52,080
I wanted to give
him the kind of life
I didn't have as a kid.

1270
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,882
I wanted to give
him the opposite
of what I had as a kid.

1271
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:56,418
But, now, all of a sudden
he's turning into my mother.

1272
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,421
He plays bridge.
He listens to Lite FM.

1273
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,323
He asked for a blue
blazer with gold buttons

1274
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,859
and anchors on
them for Christmas.

1275
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,427
Does your mom
wear blue blazers?

1276
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:06,895
No, that was my father.

1277
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,797
How is it possible?

1278
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:10,832
What am I doing wrong?

1279
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,769
At least you're trying.

1280
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,404
I mean, there's so many
different kinds of parents.

1281
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,841
There's no one
best way to do it.

1282
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:24,046
Or so I've gathered
with my vast experience
reading personal essays.

1283
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:30,118
Speaking of which,
I have 15 essays
to get through tonight. So...

1284
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,821
Right. Yeah.

1285
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,359
Well, thank you
for bringing him back.

1286
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,994
Of course.

1287
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,464
So, you really are
leaving, aren't you?

1288
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:44,900
Um, in a month and a half.

1289
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,743
I thought...

1290
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:56,745
Let's just
not think for a while.

1291
01:01:58,314 --> 01:01:59,381
Great.

1292

1294
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,784
Yes.

1295
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:36,852
Are you going to be my mom?

1296
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,387
What? No.
(SHUSHING)

1297
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:41,957
I'm just messing with you.

1298
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,392
Right.
Go back to sleep.

1299
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,162
Guess you're not
so boring after all.

(BLOWING A RASPBERRY)

1301
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,549
Good morning.
Hi.

1302
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:10,018
Did you stay over?

1303
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,353
Too long of
a drive back to campus?

1304
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:12,454
I slept on the sofa.
Ah.

1305
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:16,124
So did your mother.

1306
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,460
We did not make it
all the way to the bedroom.

1307
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:19,394
I didn't need to know that.

1308
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:20,929
Interesting.

1309
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:22,430
Unique, I would say.

1310
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,099
Oh, really,
that's enough information.

1311
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:26,201
The boy. Jeremiah.

1312
01:03:26,203 --> 01:03:31,072
Oh.
The ventriloquism,
weird. I liked it.

1313
01:03:31,074 --> 01:03:32,073
I will write
a recommendation.

1314
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:33,475
Thank you!

Mom?

1318
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:08,410
What are you doing here?

1319
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,915
I wanted
to tell you
something.

1320
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:16,184
I know, you slept with
that guy, didn't you?

1321
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,453
I did.

1322
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:20,222
Then we both got lucky.

It's okay. It's good.

1325

It is good. You don't need
any commitments right now.

No.

guy, uh, gave
me a workout.

Good to meet you.
Are you Mr. Balakian?

No, his parents couldn't
make it, I'm his teacher.

Yeah, you look
like a teacher.

to tuck that in, son.

come in my torture chamber,

and you can tell me

Yeah, great.

No, I mean,
he's authentic.

to meet future
business partners.

1350
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:40,595
He loves learning
for the sake of learning.

1351
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,698
That's what it's
about, isn't it?

(CHUCKLING)

1353
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,336
Right.

01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,472
Why don't you
go get yourself
a cup of coffee?

1355
01:06:50,474 --> 01:06:52,140
Yeah. Great. Thanks.

Hmm.
Excuse me?

1357
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,583
I just called you
a prick. I'm sorry.

1358

Don't take it out on him.
That's my own thing.

1359

That's not very nice.

01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:12,060
I know.

1361
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:16,097
So, Jeremiah,
tell me about yourself.

01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:22,570
Uh, myself, as in...
You mean in
relation to my soul?

1364
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:24,239
Or do you
mean myself, like,

1365
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,674
as a unified person, like,
the source of consciousness,

1366
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:30,045
or do you mean myself, like...
Like as a narrative
center of gravity?

1367
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:35,116
I'm not supposed
to discuss
alumni recommendations.

1368

<i>It was that bad?</i>

1369
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,585
Well, can we get him
a second alumni interview?

1370
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:39,621
I'm afraid not.

Bye.

1377
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,489
I have spoken
to the Judo Association,

1378

Yes, him.

Alice's mother was murdered.
The murderer got
off on a technicality.

Alice would like to retry him

prefer the death penalty.

but academically rigorous.

Jeremiah is an only child.

Parents both
work at a Stop-N-Go.

1490
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,789
Neither of them
attended college.

1491
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:59,994
The first three years
of his high school life
were a disaster.

1492
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:02,263
If you're wondering
why you are even
listening to this,

1493
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:07,902
Jeremiah is also
a self-described autodidact
since the age of eight.

1494
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:11,906
In fact, he is
the most well-read person
I have met.

1495
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:12,974
Ever.

1496
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:18,813
And why?
For his resume?
To impress someone?

1497
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:22,817
For the sake of learning,
his passion for knowledge.

1498
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,120
He had no plans
to attend college

1499
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:29,290
until this past fall
when he switched to Quest

1500
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:34,962
and came into contact
with teachers
who recognized his potential.

1501
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:39,534
Last spring,
he took the SATs
and eight AP tests.

1502
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,869
Wait, so he took
AP classes?

1503
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:45,606
No AP classes,
no SAT prep courses.

1504
01:15:45,608 --> 01:15:48,743
But he got 5's
on all eight APs,

1505
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:53,814
and 790,
780 and 790 on the SATs.

1506
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,716
That's amazing.

Amazing!
It's amazing.
Exactly.

1510
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:04,792
Do you think he can handle
an intense academic community?

01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:05,893
Thank you.
That's a great question.

1512
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:10,031

of his new school
says he is

could have done more,

made himself
more of a resume
and a paper trail,

himself from nowhere
to where he is today.

No.

1685
01:29:18,787 --> 01:29:20,520
My birth mother
is named
Jeanie Shredder.

1686
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:24,358
And she's a hairdresser
from Keene.

1687
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:29,396
And I met her
and my half-sisters
a couple of months ago.

1688
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:31,064
I put my name in at
the adoption agency,
and they contacted me.

1689
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:33,967
No, no, Jeremiah.

1690
01:29:33,969 --> 01:29:36,503
You were born
on Valentine's Day

1691
01:29:36,505 --> 01:29:39,740
at 1:00 p.m.
at Blaine General to me.

1692
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:43,043
No, I was born
at 11:00 p.m.

1693
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:45,779
They said my mom tried
like hell to hold off
till the last hour

1694
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:48,115
so I wouldn't have
some lame
Valentine's Day birthday.

1695

It's a copy. See?

1696

That's an 11
with one of the ones
missing.

1697
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:57,090
It's faded.
You see?

1698
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:06,066
I never told anybody,
because I didn't want
my parents to find out.

1699
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,635
I was worried
that it would
hurt their feelings.

1700
01:30:08,637 --> 01:30:11,738
And I don't want
to hurt them 'cause
they're my parents.

1701
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,639
Of course.

1702
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,475
Uh.

1703
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:17,511
This whole time,
you thought
you were my mother?

1704
01:30:17,513 --> 01:30:18,945
Why didn't you tell me?

1705
01:30:18,947 --> 01:30:21,415
I didn't want
anything to get in

getting into Princeton.

1707
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:24,684
I'd have
to recuse
myself and...

1708
01:30:24,686 --> 01:30:27,020
So everything
you did was because
you thought I was your son?

1709
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:29,489
No. I completely
believe in you!

1710
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:34,528
I actually do.

1711
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:36,029
But you were lying
to me the whole time.

1712
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:40,634
I don't understand.

1713
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,670
I can't tell
what's real.

1714

I don't get it.

What?

1725

to be an 11!

None of this was true.
This is all a stupid dream.

with a stranger
to get pregnant,

1737
01:32:43,158 --> 01:32:46,126
really not so great.
You didn't even ask his name.

1738
01:32:46,128 --> 01:32:48,662
So I will never
know who my father is.

Maybe he's in Hoboken.

Obviously not that.
