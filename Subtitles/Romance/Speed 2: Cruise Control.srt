00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,083
All engines on standby.

179
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,759
Well, let's take her out, then.

180
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,239
(SHIP HORN BLOWS)

181
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,483
Welcome to your suite.

182
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,399
Believe me, in 7 days you'll
be sorry to leave room 6088,

183
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,719
your happy and humble home.

184
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,519
Now, if you two need anything
else, anything at all,

185
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,799
you just call Ashton.

186
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,439
And let me thank you both in
advance for the generous gratuity,

187
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,999
I know you'll be leaving me
at the end of this cruise.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,607
- Just kidding.
- But not really.

189
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,329
Oh. And, you two

190
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,047
have a nice honeymoon.

191
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,479
Oh, we're... We're not...

192
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,484
Not married.

193
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,090
Nope.

194
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,881
Hyah!

195
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,523
Thank you.

196
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,519
- Thank you.
- Big enough for you?

197
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,079
Well, size doesn't matter.
You know that.

198
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,561
Yes!

199
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,959
Why? I mean, all of the sudden,
I have Love Boat fever.

200
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,479
It feels really good.

201
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,039
I'm really, truly excited
about being on a cruise ship.

202
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,879
I don't know why.

203
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,119
Maybe they, like, pump drugs

204
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,279
through, like, the air conditioning
system or something like that.

205
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,319
What do you think?

206
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,439
Yeah, you know what I need?

207
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,319
I need lots of those
yummy little drinks

208
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,959
with those highly little
impractical umbrellas in them.

209
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,044
That is what I need.

210
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,368
Yeah, you're looking good.

211
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,323
So who's ready to party on
the big boat besides me?

212
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,359
What's the matter?
You look a little tense.

213
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,479
- Tense?
- Yes.

214
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,559
- No.
- No?

215
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,639
We're here to relax.

216
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,679
- Let's get a drink.
- Okay.

217
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,759
- All right.
- Let's go.

218
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,999
We're going to have
a really good time.

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,561
Yeah? You think so?

See you later. Bye.

227
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,919
So, what do you want to do?

228
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,847
Do you want to shuffleboard
and then room or...

229
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,450
Or room, then shuffleboard?

- Oh?

Yes. Yes, we talked.

238
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,719
Doesn't seem very
interested in golf

239
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,599
for someone who had a fit
about his clubs, though.

240
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,479
No? Really? Why do you say that?

241
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,039
Well...

242
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,239
The tournament's on
right behind him.

243
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,529
He hasn't even glanced at the TV.

244
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,839
You're absolutely right.

245
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,399
Honey, I think we need
to go arrest him.

246
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,962
- Excuse me! Excuse...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

247
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,119
Aw, honey, you just wanted a hug.

to do me a favor,

asked you to do before.

Oh, no, no, I don't, uh, boogie.

255

Oh, yes, yes. Just run in place.

Run in place.

258
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,519
Yeah, I think so.

is that fat is bad...

in order to lose fat,
you shouldn't eat fat.

Well, guess what, guys.

267
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,639
False. Your body's
just a giant computer.

show you something.

a little something.

00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,799
Everybody, into the boat!

710
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,279
That way, folks! Quickly!

711
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,648
- Come on, come on.
- Drew.

712
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,679
Help us, somebody!

713
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,119
Drew wasn't in the room.

714
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,719
Celeste, we have looked everywhere!

715
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,519
You guys, she's probably
on another lifeboat.

716
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,919
But we can't leave without her!

717
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,039
Come on.

718
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,159
I'm sure she's fine.

719

Now, please...

723
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,919

724

Come on, sir, we gotta move!

00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,959
She's not on the boat.

731
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,119
Did someone run a count?

732
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,239
She's probably on
another boat, sir.

Something's strange.

Now, look, I've got no time left,

740

this guy is capable of!

You gotta stop the ship!

752
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,090

Now get out of the way!

you leave me upstairs?

What? What?

1078
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,959
Geiger's taken over the ship.

Geiger. I'm-not-looking-
at-my-golf-game Geiger?

No, Geiger... "I'm a

Geiger... "I designed
all the software..."

1082

And Geiger... "I can
blow up everything."

1083
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,999
Why would he do that? I don't know.

1093
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,519
Drop the weapon.

1094
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,519
Don't shoot.

01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,968
He's taking us right
into an oil tanker.

1242
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,879
What?

1243
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,199
You're right.

1244
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:13,399
She's anchored 16 miles out,
and we are doing 17.8 knots.

1245
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,919
Well, how long till they move?

1246
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,439
From starting their
engines, 30 minutes.

1247
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,839
There's no chance they're gonna
get out of our way in time.

1248
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,164
So, what... What...
What does that mean?

1249
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,970
Oh, man!

1250
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,808
Uh, he's turning us another 1/4.

1251
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,011
Ah! Damn it. (GROANS)

1252
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,159
Can we turn the ship
without the rudder?

1253
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,239
MERCED:
The bow thrusters would do it.

1254
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,719
JULIANO: We can't get there now.
You guys flooded the access.

1255
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,199
Yeah, well, we also messed
up his program, sir.

1256
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,559
No, you almost sunk us.

1257
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,439
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1258
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,799
Let's take a wrench and
dump it into the engine

1259
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,959
and bust the transmission like
a car 'cause I've done that.

1260
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,319
With all due respect,
this is not your car.

1261
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,199
- This is a cruise liner.
- ALEX: She's right. It's a propeller.

1262
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,639
We got to stop the propeller.

1263
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,159
You could wedge something
into it underneath the ship,

1264
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,479
(STAMMERING) like a steel cable.

1265
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,159
This is not my
suggestion, obviously.

1266
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,039
Great idea. I'll go under the ship.

1267
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,159
No, you won't.

1268
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,399
No, you won't. That's
not what I meant.

1269
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,479
That's a stupid idea.

1270
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,679
- No, it's a great idea.
- No.

1271
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,439
It's suicide. These blades
are 12 feet across.

1272
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,490
They'll suck you in and kill you.

captain in <i>The Enemy Below?</i>

1275
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,164
Curt Jurgens.

1276
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,359
Down the next stairwell
on the left,

1277
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,959
straight to the bowels of the ship.

1278
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,488

sound very good.

1279
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,559

1280
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,803

- What else could it be?

Alex, maybe this isn't
such a hot idea.

1298
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,239
Maybe you should just leave
the propeller alone, huh?

1299
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,130
We have to stop the ship.

Here's the guideline.

1320
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,567
Feed it into the propeller, and
it will pull the heavy cable in.

1321
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,481
- Not too much slack.
- Okay, okay, okay. I've got him.
