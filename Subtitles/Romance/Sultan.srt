00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:46,874
, Wrestling is not a sport "
"It is about the struggle that lies

3
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,613

00:01:06,703 --> 00:01:09,844
How much being spent for this match
Difficult to say

8
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,364
One thing I clearly said to reduce ..vly

9
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:14,617
There is little risks

10
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:17,615
Today 's fighting Ghaybh

11
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:27,486
But it has been proven that Avbrvy of Akashi.
Doping affair cricket, handy in this case is

12

What goes on in that meeting? Soon we realize

13
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:35,155
All think it only popular game in India Krykth

14
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,719
But the campaign's Indian fans
Seriously follow '

15
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:41,155
And the entire state of oneself and one day, another
Brushes added

16
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,159
I'm sorry for Zrrtvn

17
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:55,776

I had not quit now rather than sold

21
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:09,586
But they all know, that the sport
Manish is a 5-seater in the world.

22
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:11,533
I believe I

23
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,777
There, I want that
Me 6 month s time to do so

24
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:15,707

All know that the sport 's wrong one
We thought that the State

27
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,575
No no

28
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:25,957
I disagree with you

29
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,414
Two-year task could not do

30
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,013
! 6 months then you'll want me to sign me?

31
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:30,259
Perhaps you are right

32
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,021
I once lost and
I windward money Hmgytvn

33
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,225
You know that all the empty stadium

34
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:38,861
But if you take it we should close today

35
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:42,971
I hope not Back Pvltvn

36
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:44,811
Also I let happen.

37
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:49,861
Now put this together last chance

38
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:54,252
Mr Patel, trust me no more

Akashi once again Avbrvy
She put it in the media

41
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,768
None of the reporters did not respond to questions

42
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,823
The silence do not know
! Cherish satisfaction or failure symptoms

43
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:12,127
I understand the answer's going to be 6 months

44
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,643
How much do you have left?

45
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:22,596

Because of the harm you did, I'm sorry

47
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:29,819
But you were right

48
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:33,498
The sport has no future

49
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:37,511

India is a country who I can respect
Who is of Indian territory

58

When a putty Hindustani
In the ring the rest of the team like a donkey

01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,629
11 hours fight

1090
01:22:50,304 --> 01:22:52,257
All the villages we would have been

1091
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,279
But could not find somebody with this blood group

1092
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:59,460
When he Rsydsh

1093
01:23:02,676 --> 01:23:04,715
I fought with all life.

1094
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:10,430
He failed and went

1095
01:23:17,308 --> 01:23:19,144
Follow your dreams were

1096
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:22,847
And he lost

1097
01:23:25,236 --> 01:23:26,854
Ok, you win Sultan

1098
01:23:28,262 --> 01:23:29,920
But now all Bakhtym

1099
01:23:35,662 --> 01:23:40,560
Now the wall is gone
I can not break up

1100
01:23:44,597 --> 01:23:45,731
Go Sultan

1101
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,344
I do not wanna see you.

1102
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:06,348
After six months I have not talked to him

1103
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:09,518
I appeared in front of me but crooked way,

1104
01:26:10,256 --> 01:26:13,257
After her grandmother's death came

1105
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:14,745
Then I got home

1106
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:19,877
A few days later came the news of his father's death

1107
01:26:21,128 --> 01:26:22,605
Was only

1108
01:26:24,267 --> 01:26:25,255
Arefeh it?

1109
01:26:25,448 --> 01:26:27,065
Arefeh lives with his dad

1110
01:26:27,777 --> 01:26:31,380
For years now pipe down

1111
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:34,282
For years, she goes to the shrine of Sultan Bbynsh

1112
01:26:35,488 --> 01:26:39,761
Hey, comes and goes as he Drarh

1113
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:43,123
When Mybynsh if Nmyshnassh
Thing for passes away.

1114
01:26:44,761 --> 01:26:46,237
Sultan now what he?

1115
01:26:46,591 --> 01:26:47,666
What do want me to be broke?

1116
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,170
Before that fought to live

1117
01:26:50,983 --> 01:26:52,761
Now he was fighting with life

1118
01:26:53,691 --> 01:26:55,694
Now it's just a dream

1119
01:26:56,184 --> 01:26:57,765
Want to have a blood bank team

1120
01:26:58,623 --> 01:27:00,649
To be with her all

1121
01:27:02,056 --> 01:27:04,708
And also knows the heart
That Arefeh forgive him.

1122
01:27:05,813 --> 01:27:09,250
It wants to somehow
Seek his forgiveness

1123
01:27:09,904 --> 01:27:11,994
There, for many years he
Collected money from people looks

1124
01:27:16,879 --> 01:27:18,477
Mr. Akashi, I know you are, too great person

1125
01:27:20,326 --> 01:27:21,704
I want to ask something of you

1126
01:27:22,843 --> 01:27:24,303
Your offer is very good.

1127
01:27:25,563 --> 01:27:26,424
But these people do not like to

1128
01:27:27,037 --> 01:27:29,568
Counter-attacking on time if this proposal goes

1129
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,475
But if that's the way blood banks Bndazyn

1130
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,228

1131
01:27:38,005 --> 01:27:40,508
Thank you, thank you very much

1132
01:27:51,007 --> 01:27:52,793
Get ready, we will go to market early

1133
01:27:53,995 --> 01:27:56,903
Animal Sultan Khan, tea eat?

1134
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:57,732

1135
01:27:57,832 --> 01:27:58,487
sit down

1136
01:27:59,963 --> 01:28:01,305
Well, what do you say?

1137
01:28:01,492 --> 01:28:03,508
The construction of blood banks

1138
01:28:03,757 --> 01:28:05,223
The card spawns

1139
01:28:05,491 --> 01:28:08,216
I also sent your file to the ministry

1140
01:28:08,648 --> 01:28:10,434
But this Zmanbrh

1141
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:13,015
The mean number of years now that Hmynv Minister

1142
01:28:13,883 --> 01:28:17,493
The country's all okay did you

1143
01:28:17,998 --> 01:28:20,455
Licensing is also not working for you

1144
01:28:20,964 --> 01:28:22,265
My Dad ready for a long time, late

1145
01:28:22,842 --> 01:28:26,529
I heard Daddy, Come out, another two minutes to die

1146
01:28:28,651 --> 01:28:31,200
Brother Sultan, why rush it?

1147
01:28:31,481 --> 01:28:33,515
Keep a low tolerance, the card goes

1148
01:28:33,828 --> 01:28:35,000
Just wait, too.

1149
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:35,987
Long live India

1150
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,157
Let's go Babaei market.

1151
01:28:44,626 --> 01:28:47,326
Sultan, Hi
A moment to listen to me

1152
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,720

1153
01:28:53,103 --> 01:28:54,085
Still refused

1154
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:57,589
I know why the ship, but Kurdish

1155
01:28:59,744 --> 01:29:01,348
Whoever may also be milled
Was Hmynkarv

1156
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:06,384
Until now how much money did you collect?

1157

1158
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:12,055
All of the money collected photos
To the extent not match certain

1159
01:29:12,855 --> 01:29:15,192
My dad told me that King
Was born wrestlers.

1160
01:29:17,138 --> 01:29:19,418
Look, pal, I, as a businessman
I came to do a deal with you

1161
01:29:19,988 --> 01:29:22,163
But hearing the story, to believe it

Just think, that everything and lost
You play with wrestling again Bdstshvn

1163
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,995
Owners alike who lives in war

1164
01:29:31,821 --> 01:29:33,935
Is the struggle into a place like useless things?

1165
01:29:36,724 --> 01:29:37,559
This is my card

1166
01:29:45,805 --> 01:29:46,457

The soil is in your blood. "
"And her blood is also on the ground

I wanted to live off the land

1194
01:32:03,273 --> 01:32:04,533
Your feet should be firmly put

1195
01:32:06,981 --> 01:32:11,524
But if life is always going to win

1196
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:15,477
I was coming to tell Hmynv

1197
01:32:19,366 --> 01:32:23,977

How soon decided so?

1234
01:35:38,806 --> 01:35:44,806
My grandmother used to say: on the good
There is no need divination

1235
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:45,942

Kapil bad today a cricket ball

OVERSEAS 30 or 31-year-old young people fighting in it.

This exercise requires precision and speed is power

1254
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:35,092
This can be broke all doing these things?

1255

Mr Patel was right Shmayh

02:06:59,136 --> 02:07:00,323
Only 5 seconds left

1625
02:07:18,571 --> 02:07:20,114
Save yourself

1626
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:23,639
And that was saved

1627
02:07:24,815 --> 02:07:26,449

1628
02:07:28,221 --> 02:07:28,860
Why

1629
02:07:30,421 --> 02:07:31,202

Do not be nervous

1634
02:07:47,485 --> 02:07:50,800
Sit too little time

1635
02:07:53,614 --> 02:07:55,240
He's a big fighter

1636
02:07:55,558 --> 02:07:56,355
Look at this

1637
02:07:57,061 --> 02:08:02,952
! I do not know this guy is a fighter or a monkey

1638
02:08:03,166 --> 02:08:06,921
He fights or anything else matters
Because you Soltani

1639
02:08:07,577 --> 02:08:09,487
Do not involve your mind and just think about now

1640
02:08:10,853 --> 02:08:12,474
Stay away from Lgdhash

1641
02:08:26,389 --> 02:08:31,677

1652
02:09:31,512 --> 02:09:35,792
Sultan is sure that he can not lift another fighter

1653
02:09:41,807 --> 02:09:44,514

1654
02:09:44,771 --> 02:09:45,808

02:20:29,801 --> 02:20:33,982
And Tyrone 's record that
In the second round defeat gives Hryfhashv

1799
02:20:51,549 --> 02:20:53,299
Plum

1800
02:20:59,585 --> 02:21:00,085
Not start any

1801
02:21:01,737 --> 02:21:05,291
The interesting thing is, the competition
Struggle between two ships clip

1802
02:21:05,691 --> 02:21:08,393
Competition will be very fun cobra

1803
02:21:09,105 --> 02:21:10,941
Tyrone's face, and he struts can you see?

1804
02:21:11,234 --> 02:21:13,984
He tells her to come take a ship

1805
02:21:14,381 --> 02:21:16,815
As a wrestler Tyrone Qharh

1806
02:21:27,057 --> 02:21:29,019
This is also a move

1807
02:21:34,313 --> 02:21:37,155
Sultan. Sultan

1808
02:22:27,396 --> 02:22:28,396
God's ..avh Sultan

1809
02:22:29,279 --> 02:22:31,943
You have come far

1810
02:22:32,263 --> 02:22:34,176
Intensified account

1811
02:22:41,513 --> 02:22:43,069
The game is very heavy God

1812
02:22:43,434 --> 02:22:45,105
Sultan, was beaten today eat

1813
02:23:20,101 --> 02:23:21,679
Sultan goes down

1814
02:23:23,679 --> 02:23:24,720
Alarm to sound the praises

1815
02:23:25,245 --> 02:23:26,956
Oh no. No, that's not good

1816
02:23:27,136 --> 02:23:30,841
This round was not good for neither of them

1817
02:23:31,444 --> 02:23:35,205
And when someone in a cage happen, not good

1818
02:23:36,094 --> 02:23:37,894
come

1819
02:23:38,177 --> 02:23:40,640
Yarrow Vzyh
Who got you say? -

1820
02:23:42,486 --> 02:23:44,157
Fuck my gum out

1821
02:23:46,847 --> 02:23:49,615
Given this fact let fight
I was going to finish the game

1822
02:23:50,451 --> 02:23:52,055
Come on purpose that I'm here, do you say?

1823
02:23:52,966 --> 02:23:55,834
I'm the last moment

1824
02:23:56,098 --> 02:23:57,765
I know that you do not you accept defeat

1825
02:23:58,271 --> 02:24:00,455
But she grabs Jvnt

1826
02:24:04,433 --> 02:24:06,069
The June for the Gaiters

1827
02:24:08,007 --> 02:24:09,712
Why do I love it

1828
02:24:15,367 --> 02:24:16,849
See bro

1829
02:24:18,305 --> 02:24:19,871
Beat me

1830
02:24:21,233 --> 02:24:24,337
This is the second major semi-final round of the competition

1831
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:25,387
what happened?

1832
02:24:25,705 --> 02:24:26,781
Dndhash broken

1833
02:24:26,968 --> 02:24:27,431
What?

1834
02:24:27,746 --> 02:24:29,217
Stop fighting now

1835
02:24:29,725 --> 02:24:31,223
So we're trying, but I believe that putting

1836
02:24:40,089 --> 02:24:45,126
Like the Sultan trouble
And Tyrone Qbraqh

1837
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:49,658
I think Tyrone did not finish inside the Ayn Rand

1838
02:25:15,565 --> 02:25:19,600
King fell to the ground
I kick it up

1839
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:20,400
stand up

1840
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:45,942
Stand up brother Sultan, Amydtv lose

1841
02:26:31,349 --> 02:26:32,991

1842
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:37,920
Come on get up

1843
02:26:49,612 --> 02:26:51,252
Sultan came to his

1844
02:26:51,492 --> 02:26:53,825
Beauty rose

1845
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,745
Good King

1846
02:27:03,447 --> 02:27:05,359
Come Sultan

1847
02:27:10,689 --> 02:27:12,680
King beat him land

1848
02:27:13,403 --> 02:27:15,445
King beat him land

1849
02:27:15,723 --> 02:27:18,114
King beat him land

1850
02:27:18,380 --> 02:27:21,168
King beat him land

1851
02:27:22,143 --> 02:27:24,261
King beat him land

1852
02:27:24,925 --> 02:27:27,447
King beat him land

1853
02:27:40,909 --> 02:27:41,408
Eval

1854
02:27:54,979 --> 02:27:55,754
Why

1855
02:27:57,139 --> 02:28:01,180
The work was finished and Tyrone

1856
02:28:02,268 --> 02:28:03,258
Good boy

1857
02:28:04,159 --> 02:28:05,560
I think the move played Tyrone

1858
02:28:06,259 --> 02:28:10,628
Ayn Rand hero of the match

1859
02:28:10,986 --> 02:28:14,658
Sultan Ali Khan of Hndh

1860
02:28:45,998 --> 02:28:46,920
Plum

1861
02:28:47,163 --> 02:28:49,074
Hello, I am calling from Delhi Govind

1862
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:51,608

Sultan thousands of fans waiting for
He himself headed health

1867

And again come back to the ring.

1868

But the situation Bhranyh

1877
02:29:33,042 --> 02:29:36,332
If he enters the ring, I will not come out alive

1878

Come on, this Kashh

Tired loss to

Why are you Aynkararv, Sultan?

1886
02:30:38,091 --> 02:30:40,161
Want me to prove that I want me?

What has upset you?

Just once, instead I think

1890
02:30:57,492 --> 02:30:58,586
Because when I was this guy?

1891
02:30:59,584 --> 02:31:00,833
I think that makes a statement?

1892
02:31:01,904 --> 02:31:05,631
Who dignity and respect in my eyes wanted to see?

1893
02:31:12,357 --> 02:31:13,670
Who was the boy safe?

1894
02:31:16,676 --> 02:31:17,654
Just be yours?

1895
02:31:21,086 --> 02:31:22,990
That is not my baby?

1896
02:31:25,060 --> 02:31:29,131
Arefeh, a father of taste goes?

1897
02:31:35,271 --> 02:31:37,474
A lot of time, your pain is pain cure

1898
02:31:40,614 --> 02:31:41,716
What do you think?

1899
02:31:43,412 --> 02:31:45,104
Just you see me coming?

1900
02:31:47,268 --> 02:31:50,259
That did not think I had to come?

1901
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:52,652
He Every Day

1902
02:31:53,048 --> 02:31:54,884
Why?

1903
02:31:56,812 --> 02:31:58,210
Just to see you

1904
02:32:00,728 --> 02:32:05,650
And passed all these years Shadyamvn
For just ten

1905
02:32:07,393 --> 02:32:10,844
People from suffering such a pain in the break
"But I'm not broken" physically I

1906
02:32:11,001 --> 02:32:11,971
You know why?

1907
02:32:14,365 --> 02:32:16,086
Because I love Summary

I admit, I hurt you very year

1910
02:32:30,694 --> 02:32:32,730
Maybe you can not understand me as much as a moment of your photos?

1911
02:32:35,136 --> 02:32:37,490
But to say something?

1912
02:32:38,348 --> 02:32:40,718
Matter of life or pride and victory?

1913
02:32:54,706 --> 02:32:55,884
excuse me

1914
02:33:04,635 --> 02:33:10,655
You know, we all say that if you get into the ring.
I might get out alive ancestor

1915
02:33:13,426 --> 02:33:14,206
I know

1916
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:17,546
! But they do not know what is the real king

1917
02:33:19,358 --> 02:33:20,346
I am leaving

1918
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:23,802
If today who could go toe-Bray

1919
02:33:24,614 --> 02:33:26,070
Perhaps the appearance survive

1920
02:33:27,397 --> 02:33:28,841
But the die

1921
02:33:30,096 --> 02:33:31,335
Destroyed no loss

1922
02:33:31,997 --> 02:33:32,776
You know

1923
02:33:33,244 --> 02:33:33,756
Yeah

1924
02:33:34,732 --> 02:33:38,707
Go something that you started
stop it

1925
02:33:41,294 --> 02:33:42,304
And Promise

1926
02:33:44,001 --> 02:33:45,569
He promised a Phlvvn to another Phlvvn

1927
02:33:46,981 --> 02:33:49,240
And a husband to his wife.

1928
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:53,661
Come back alive

1929
02:33:56,635 --> 02:33:58,124
I too believe

1930
02:33:59,082 --> 02:34:00,076
Uncompromising

1931
02:34:06,118 --> 02:34:11,157
Morsi professor

1932
02:34:12,157 --> 02:34:16,155
Go fans waiting outside

1933
02:34:30,156 --> 02:34:40,156

Instagram.Com/BollywoodihaOfficial
Telegram.me/BollywoodihaOfficial

1934
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:09,322
And now, facing the Sultan Marcus
Which is located in a dangerous fighter

1935
02:35:09,656 --> 02:35:15,772
In fact, the three of Hryfhashv
After the match on a stretcher to hospital

1936
02:35:23,932 --> 02:35:28,242
So you pay attention to all things?

1937
02:35:42,729 --> 02:35:43,500

1938
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,366

Can you laugh for me once?

1941
02:36:05,685 --> 02:36:08,346
The Sultan Today is

1942
02:36:09,390 --> 02:36:11,464
I think this competition, a sort of suicide

1943
02:36:11,783 --> 02:36:13,300
I agree with you

1944
02:36:13,590 --> 02:36:16,021
! All Mydvynm What is the outcome of this match

1945
02:36:16,279 --> 02:36:18,596
But I think it's time we trust the Sultan

1946
02:36:18,854 --> 02:36:21,800
I think I'd better see Eben match without a microphone

1947
02:36:22,614 --> 02:36:24,046
The pro Sultan
Good idea -

1948
02:36:28,025 --> 02:36:29,362
Where Kshtyhatvn brothers drowned?

1949
02:36:29,718 --> 02:36:31,004
! Nygash now the guy

1950
02:36:33,030 --> 02:36:35,815

So money comes Gyrmvn
Blood banks happen?

that's good

1954
02:36:46,250 --> 02:36:47,486
What they say in English?

1955
02:36:49,052 --> 02:36:53,186
Take yourself out of the front

1956
02:37:06,530 --> 02:37:07,647
Bream

1957
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:11,408
The last fight

1958

The soil is in your blood. "
