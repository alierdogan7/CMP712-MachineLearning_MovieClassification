and then it's... (stutters) ...clean
and you wash it

33
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,805

00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,518
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,783
(Kasia laughs)
No, no. Stop.

179
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,326
No.

180
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,036
(Skunk)
Gross.

181
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,704
(Jed)
Nice move.

182
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,039
(Kasia whispers)
Stop, stop.

183
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,373
Hi, guys.

184
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,126
(Mike) Come on. Look, this is a six.
(Skunk) That's cheating.

185
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,629
(Jed) What? Stop doing that.
(Mike) This is a nine. Come on.

186
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,380
(Skunk) Mike.
(Mike) Yeah?

187
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,050
(Skunk) When you're a teacher...
(Jed) Blue.

188
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,010
...will you still bring us treats and stuff?

189
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,055
Uh, no.
That's all gonna have to end, Skunk.

190
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,306
Really?

191
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,810
Well, you see, the relationship
between student and teacher

192
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,729
- is by its nature...
- (Jed) You won't be our teacher.

193
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,397
- Well, you never know, Jed.
- Mike.

194
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,566
- By nature is what?
- Well, it's adversarial.

195
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,151
- What does that mean?
- (whispers) Go.

196
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,738
Well, it means that it'll be my job
to see you as the enemy.

197
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,574
- He's full of shit.
- Somebody only worthy of my contempt.

198
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,992
- (Kasia) Mike!
- And you'll begin to see me

199
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,077
- that way too.
- Mike!

200
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,579
- Whose go is it?
- (all) Yours.

201
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,914
Okay.

202
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,583
- I won't ever see you that way, Mike.
- (Jed, sarcastically) Aw.

203
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,919
- lt's 'cause you're in love with him.
- No, I'm not!

204
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,212
(Mike) Guys, guys.

205
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,423
ln my experience, the person
who brings up the subject of love

206
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,677
is more often than not
the person who is in love.

207
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,095
- Really?
- Shut up.

208
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,180
- You're blushing, Jed.
- (laughing)

209
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,766
What about you two? Are you in love?

210
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,768
Mike and I? Of course.

211
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,937
Then why aren't you married yet?

212
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,358
(Jed) That's the question.

213
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,615
- (snapping)
- (beeping)

214
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,701
(Kasia) All good?
(Skunk) Uh-huh.

215
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,370
- Night.
- Night.

216
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,289
Close your curtains.

217
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,299
(Archie) Have you called Dr Curtis?

218
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,760
Oh, yes, but he says, uh,
he can't act in any way

219
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,221
without Rick's permission.

220
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,640
- Which he won't give.
- This is what I'm saying.

221
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,434
He won't come out of his bedroom, Archie.

222
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,812
(Mr Buckley)
Janet sits outside his door all day

223
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,772
trying to talk to him, and nothing.

224
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,324
(sighs) I'm sorry to drop in on you
like this, out of the blue,

225
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,117
but I just...
You know, I just thought...

226
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,828
I thought, "Well, Archie, he's a...
a solicitor and..."

227
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,664
So you want...
you want to take this matter further?

228
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,292
You want to make this a legal matter?

229
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,753
Bloody legal action?
No, no, no. Forget it. Uh...

230
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,671
I don't want anything more
to do with the bastard.

231
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,174
- Oswald?
- Yes.

232
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,842
Why not?

233
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,012
Because I'm scared of him.

234
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,265
I'm just really bloody scared of him.

235
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,686
(Mrs Buckley) And you went under the water.

236
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,313
Five years old.

237
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:47,111
And your father ran so fast
across those stones to get you.

238
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,280
And he got you.

239
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,617
He saved you.

240
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,207
- And then...
- (doorbell chiming)

241
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,808
Hello, Mrs Buckley. ls Rick in?

242
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,476
Why?

243
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,186
Don't know.

244
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,522
Just thought he might like
to hang out or something.

245
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,233
He's ill, love. He can't come out.

246
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,443
Oh...

247
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,946
- Okay, well...
- Goodbye now, love.

248
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,614
Bye.

249
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,077
(door closes)

250
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,710
(keys jangling)

251
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,717
(footsteps approaching)

252
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,511
(Mrs Buckley) And anyway...

253
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,599
Then we bought you that Matchbox tank.

254
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,644
Do you remember?
For being so brave.

255
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,148
And you tried to give it to your dad

256
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,817
because he'd cut his feet up

257
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,737
running over those stones.

258
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,698
So kind, you were, so...

259
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,373
I mean, what five-year-old in the world...

260
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,419
would have done that, huh?

261
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,639
Um...

262
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,646
(mumbling) Stupid.

263
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,618
- Hello, Archie.
- Bob.

264
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,536
What can I do for you?

265
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,207
I was wondering if we could have a little chat.

266
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,541
- Chat?
- Yeah.

267
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,126
Yeah, absolutely.

268
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,383
Okay, well, um...

269
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,432
I know things have been... tough for you
since Barbara passed away, you know?

270
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,102
For you and for the girls, you know?
And what with...

271
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,437
everything that's been happening lately...

272
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,149
I just... I wanted you to know that,
you know, if ever you wanted to talk...

273
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,359
- Talk?
- Yeah.

274
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,777
Fuck off, Archie, will you?

275
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,991
All right. Um...

276
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,788
Well, what I wanted to ask you was, uh...

277
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:49,210
if you could ask your girls
to give the Buckleys a break.

278
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,879
They've been having a tough time of it lately.

279
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,047
- Have they?
- Yeah.

280
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,925
That's really awful. (sniffs)

281
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,641
When was the last time you cried, Archie?

282
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,185
- Cried?
- Yeah.

283
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,646
- I don't know. Why?
- 'Cause the next time you will

284
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,232
is the next time that you criticise my girls... 
No, hang on.

285
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,734
...in any fucking way whatsoever, all right?

286
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,319
They're out of bounds.

287
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,573
And if Buckley can't take
a little friendly fucking ribbing,

288
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,909
then he's more of a pathetic prick
than I thought he was.

289
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,036
Now, I'm having my dinner, mate,
so if you don't mind fucking off.

290
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,205
Thanks.

291
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,051
(Jed)
You know what'd make it better?

292
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,344
A Blu-ray player.

293
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,637
Yeah, well, you can't have everything, Jed.

294
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,055
No, I'm just saying.

295
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,600
I got you that ashtray, didn't I?

296
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,852
That's what I'm saying, Skunk.
lt's brilliant.

297
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,937
lt's the best ever.

298
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,610
- Be great if we never had to go back.
- What, to school?

299
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,819
Yeah.

300
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,655
I don't know. I'm kind of
looking forward to going, actually.

301
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,074
Oh, first year.

302
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,159
What?

303
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,911
Sometimes when you're walking
down the corridors,

304
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,787
- the older kids will punch you.
- What?

305
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,080
ln the stomach.

306
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,248
(Skunk shrieks)

307
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,333
(Dillon) ldiots!

308
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,001
- Watch where you're going, will you?
- (Jed) Listen, mate,

309
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,920
it's not our fault you can't ride your bike.

310
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,840
lt's not my bike.
And I can ride it. Watch this.

311
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,175
Whose is it, then?

312
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,470
- That is a travesty.
- (Dillon) Hang on, hang on.

313
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,138
Right, you ready?

314
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,891
(laughs)

315
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,684
Hey! You thieving little spastic!

316
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,769
I'll kill you!

317
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,355
I'll kill you! I'll bloody kill you!

318
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,149
Twats!

319
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,194
- Yes!
- What the fucking hell?

320
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,908
Fucking hell! (gags)

321
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,833
So who do you live with, then?

322
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,460
My auntie.

323
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,046
- Where's your dad?
- He's dead.

324
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,173
Dead?

325
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,802
He was killed in a fire, along with my mum.

326
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,763
- That's terrible.
- And my sister.

327
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,020
I don't give a shit.
I was only five or six at the time.

328
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,939
(Skunk) Oh.

329
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,441
(Jed) Wow. Cool.

330
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,698
Our mum ran away
with an accountant from Birmingham.

331
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,951
Yeah? So are you a lesbian?

332
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,536
No.

333
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,037
You look like a lesbian.

334
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,123
What does a lesbian look like?

335
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,668
Kind of ugly.

336
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,086
(Jed) Oi, Skunk!

337
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,631
(Mrs Buckley) No, but just stop them taking him.

338
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,216
Dave, why don't you
just go in there and do something?

339
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,635
- (Mr Buckley) Calm down. I'm really...
- Sort it out, for Christ's sake.

340
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,178
(Sunrise) He's coming!

341
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,180
(Mrs Buckley) Rick, Rick.
You've done nothing wrong, Rick.

342
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,974
Here he is.

343
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,934
(Saskia) Get the straitjacket.
(Mrs Buckley) Stop it!

344
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,770
(Sunrise) Lock him up!
(Mrs Buckley) Rick! Rick! I love you.

345
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,856
Put him in a padded fucking cell, the psycho.

346
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,025
(Sunrise)
Cut his knob off.

347
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,986
(Saskia)
Feed it to him.

348
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,030
(Sunrise)
His donkey fucking knob!

349
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,906
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

350
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,117
(Saskia laughs)

351
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,994
(Kasia)
Jed.

352
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,497
(Jed) Has Rick gone mental?
(Kasia) Shut up and go inside.

353
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,999
Where are you going?

354
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,959
(Jed) He's coming in to play Xbox.
(Kasia) No, he's not.

355
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,420
Bye-bye.
Off you go back to your halting site.

356
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,214
(Dillon) I ain't no pikey.
(Jed) That's racist, Kasia.

357
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,383
- Sorry, mate. She's Polish.
- (Kasia) Skunk!

358
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,143
- Bye.
- You don't look like a lesbian.

359
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,354
No? So why'd you say I did, then?

360
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,565
- I don't know.
- Because I'm ugly?

361
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,649
No, you're not.

362
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,027
You're really pretty.

363
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,406
- Am I?
- (laughs) No. You're ugly.

364
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,241
(Dillon) See ya.

365
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,619
(Mr Buckley) Well, sitting outside his
bedroom door all day's not gonna help.

366
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,787
lt's that kind of babying...

367
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,996
- (Mrs Buckley) Babying?
- Yes.

368
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,540
You don't know whether you're coming
or going. Look at yourself.

369
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,626
When did you last have a shower?

370
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,879
- Our son is sick.
- Give him a break.

371
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,132
- Our son needs to know I'm here!
- Calm down... Well, I'll...

372
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,051
Please, don't. Please, don't.

373
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,053
(Mr Buckley)
Rick, get out of this room!

374
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,305
Rick, open this door.
lf you don't open this door...

375
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,724
I'm... Rick, I'm coming in, you...

376
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,893
- (tearing)
- Ah!

377
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,446
(Mr Buckley)
I asked the doctor they had there

378
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,449
how long they could keep him in, and, uh...

379
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,953
he said, indefinitely.

380
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,872
- Right.
- ls that true?

381
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,625
Well, um...

382
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,879
lf a patient's been sectioned,

383
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:48,968
they have the right to keep them in
as long as they see fit.

384
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,970
(Mr Buckley)
I see.

385
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,349
(Archie)
I'm sorry, Dave.

386
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,567
(Skunk)
What's it like?

387
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,985
I don't know. I don't know.

388
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,778
ls it like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?

389
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,363
(moaning)

390
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,032
- Stop it!
- Wait, hang on. You saw that?

391
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,285
(Jed) Kasia fell asleep
in front of the telly one night.

392
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,745
Oh, my God. Was she drinking?

393
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,622
- (tuts)
- What? I'm joking.

394
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,499
- Ooh.
- (Skunk) They cut a part

395
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,667
- of his brain out.
- (Mike) Who?

396
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,586
- McMurphy.
- (moaning)

397
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,837
- Stop it!
- (Kasia) Jed.

398
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,506
(Mike) Look, listen, that is not
gonna happen to Rick, okay?

399
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,841
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

400
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,051
- How do you know?
- Because I just know.

401
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,637
That sort of stuff, you know,
it just isn't...

402
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,682
- (moans) ...done any more.
- Ugh. Stop it.

403
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,101
All right, let's go and make these things fly.

404
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,941
- Whoa.
- (laughs)

405
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,819
(all laugh)

406
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,842
(Mike) ...fucking obsessing!
Every single...

407
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,054
(Kasia) lt's because you're avoiding...
I'm not obsessing about a thing.

408
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,805
(Mike) Why can't we just have
a normal...

409
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,600
(Mike, whispering) Why can't
we just have a normal conversation?

410
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,895
When I come over here,
it's my life, my life. What am I doing?

411
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,606
Can I just live my life? I'm getting
this job because you asked me...

412
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,899
(Kasia) What are you doing with me?

413
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,400
You know what, I am fucking out of here.

414
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,569
I was just about to say that you should...

415
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,613
(Mike)
 I'm actually going! So there you go!

416
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,991
- (Kasia) Where are you going now?
- Fucking home to my manky flat.

417
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,368
(Kasia)
Asshole.

418
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,078
I mean, why the hell are you with a person

419
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,081
unless you plan
to stay with that person, you know?

420
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,833
- (Mike) Fucking out of here!
- (screams indistinctly)

421
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,919
(Kasia)
Fucking coward. Asshole.

422
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,008
(sighs)

423
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,303
Are you and Mike splitting up?

424
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,431
Go to bed.

425
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,475
(Kasia)
And the things he said to me...

426
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,935
- You know what he called me?
- What?

427
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,063
- Obsessive fucking bitch.
- Mm.

428
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,898
Fuck you!

429
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:13,654
I'm just so worn out with it, Archie, you know?

430
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,203
Well, we could sue him, I suppose.

431
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,539
- Yeah, for what?
- I don't know.

432
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,208
Dereliction of premarital duty.

433
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:31,005
Very funny.
How about just for being a dick?

434
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,299
- Yeah, we could get him for that.
- A lazy dick.

435
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,844
He values his freedom too much, his comforts.

436
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:41,181
Well, most men do.
That's why we need that push.

437
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,100
I've been pushing long enough.

438
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,270
Four years.
I'm 35 years old, you know?

439
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,606
- Really?
- Fuck off. I can't wait any more

440
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,441
I just can't.

441
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,527
- (Archie) ls that my wine?
- No.

442
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,238
(doorbell rings)

443
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,412
What are you doing here?

444
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,539
Just thought I'd knock about.

445
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,249
Jed isn't here.

446
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,759
(Skunk)
 So angry. And she was crying and...

447
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,219
- I think she really loved him.
- Yeah?

448
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,390
(Skunk) I think she wanted them
to get married. Or buy a house.

449
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,934
- Or have a baby maybe.
- Right.

450
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,020
- I would have married him.
- Yeah?

451
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,563
Mm.

452
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,106
(crane whirring)

453
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,237
Oh, wow.

454
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,411
Come on!

455
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,416
Oh, wow.

456
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,885
Dillon!

457
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,726
This is really cool. lt's like...

458
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,978
Come in.

459
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,942
- You're a really cool girl.
- Thanks.

460
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,276
For a lesbian.

461
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,571
(chuckles)

462
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,828
Do you want a Nik Nak?

463
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,498
No, thanks.

464
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,627
Must be a pain
not being able to eat what you want.

465
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,591
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

466
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,470
Okay.

467
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,556
Can I have a kiss?

468
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,684
M... Maybe later.

469
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:53,689
All right, but later
my mouth's gonna be all Nik-y Nak-y.

470
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,444
All right. But not a splasher.

471
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,904
- A what?
- No swirly tongues.

472
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,324
(chuckles)
Okay.

473
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,760
(Jed) Look, you've got pretty ears.
lt doesn't hurt that much.

474
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,928
- (laughs) Get off. lt hurts.
- Stop it.

475
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,972
(both laughing)

476
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,892
Get your arms out.

477
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,311
- There, one up your nose.
- No, no. (laughs)

478
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,940
Look, if you keep moving your arms,
I can't give you a lovely nose piercing.

479
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,279
- Get off.
- You look so pretty.

480
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,992
Give me your eyebrow.

481
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,121
- There we go.
- (Skunk gurgles)

482
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,290
(Kasia)
 All right, guys. Come on, bed.

483
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,541
- But we're doing our books.
- (Skunk laughs)

484
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,959
Bed.

485
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,586
(Skunk whines) Dad.

486
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,422
Come on, do as you're told.
Big day tomorrow.

487
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,342
Night, Dad.

488
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,512
- Good night, love.
- Good night.

489
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,596
Very attractive.

490
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,517
- (Jed growls)
- Yeah, all right, yeah. Good, yeah.

491
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,018
(Jed chuckles)

492
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,728
Hey, where's mine?

493
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,230
(both) Night, Kasia.

494
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,856
Very funny.

495
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,566
- And don't forget teeth!
- (Skunk laughs)

496
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,120
You want a drink?

497
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,624
(Jed) And if you're wearing trainers,
they'll stomp on them. Bang!

498
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,834
And if your hair's too long,

499
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,460
what they'll do is they'll grab it from behind.

500
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,712
- All right. Stop!
- And they'll just start...

501
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,049
(sighs) 
You need so know about this stuff, Skunk.

502
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,552
The better prepared you are,
the better you'll do.

503
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,639
So, what they do
is they grab your hair from behind

504
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,517
and they just start snipping away
with a pair of scissors.

505
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,644
- So you pick your moment.
- Yeah.

506
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,521
And you let them know the arrangement.

507
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,481
Yeah... What?

508
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,441
- The deal.
- Right.

509
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,695
And then they know where they stand.

510
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,406
- Yeah.
- Which is...

511
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,118
- Nowhere.
- Absolutely fucking nowhere.

512
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,703
(laughing)

513
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,710
- lt's funnier later on.
- Okay.

514
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,869
(Kasia)
What about Rachel?

515
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,415
What about her?

516
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,500
(Kasia)
lf she walked in right now,

517
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,170
would you take her back?

518
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,671
You must be joking.

519
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,135
- Not even for the kids?
- Why?

520
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,763
So they could live in fear
of her walking out again

521
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,599
whenever she felt like it?
No, thank you very much.

522
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,644
They wouldn't even know

523
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,604
who she was.

524
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,106
Poor Archie.

525
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,029
Poor Kasia.

526
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,636
I'm off to bed.

527
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,222
All right, then.

528
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,184
- Good night.
- Good night.

529
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,693
You can follow me up if you want.

530
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,616
(sighs)

531
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,088
(Skunk)
Dad?

532
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,551
Dad!

533
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,725
Why aren't you in bed?

534
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,978
Jed said I was gonna get
my head flushed down the toilet.

535
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,397
- By who?
- ln school.

536
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,568
- And you believed him?
- And punched in the stomach.

537
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,737
Yeah, I believe him. He said it's...

538
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,904
He said it's tradition.

539
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,532
I was told the very same thing
when I was your age.

540
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,743
- That's the tradition.
- What is?

541
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,078
Putting the fear of God into the first years.

542
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,497
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

543
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,543
Come on, then. Up you get.

544
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,505
- Night.
- Good night.

545
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,055
Dad, will you lie next to me till I go to sleep?

546
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,065
Dad!

547
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,613
(overlapping chatter)

548
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,387
My God, Mike!

549
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:04,726
- lt's Mr Kiernan in school, Skunk.
- Oh.

550
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,020
- Not Mike.
- Oh, right.

551
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,024
Well, in that case
you can call me Miss Cunningham.

552
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,777
(chuckles) Fair enough.

553
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,279
Okay, everyone. My name is Mr Kiernan.

554
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,739
(school bell rings)

555
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,625
Uh, Miss Cunningham.

556
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,877
Yes, Mr Kiernan?

557
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,880
Um, how is Kasia?

558
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,215
Kasia's fine.

559
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,261
Will you, um, say hi to her for me?

560
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,762
Do you have a message back?

561
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,264
I do.

562
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,723
Dick.

563
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,975
Excuse me?

564
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,477
lt's what she said.

565
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,980
(Fiona) How many did you get?

566
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,731
- (Skunk) A hundred.
- Shit.

567
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,233
And one of the long ones.

568
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,068
"I must not use inappropriate language..."

569
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,612
What the hell did you just do that for?

570
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,532
Sit down. Give me some money.

571
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,367
- What?
- Some money.

572
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,910
- Why?
- 'Cause I want some.

573
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,955
And if you don't, my sister's
gonna kick the fucking shit out of you.

574
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,208
- (Fiona) How much?
- All you got. Get it all out.

575
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,626
You as well.

576
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,794
Go on, quick! Hurry up!

577
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:17,966
Now, every week, from next week on,
I want £2 from each of you.

578
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,092
What?

579
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,343
That's what it costs to stay off the list.

580
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,971
- (Fiona) What list?
- The list of fucking death, bitch.

581
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,392
Here's your shit fucking loser's
out-of-date fucking mobile.

582
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,687
- lt's broken.
- (Fiona) What?

583
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:35,525
The cow. The absolute fucking ugly...

584
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,444
Go on.

585
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,864
- How many did you get?
- Two hundred.

586
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,368
Must be one of the bad ones.

587
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,538
Can I get a new phone?

588
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,125
- You've got a phone.
- lt broke.

589
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,044
- Can I get a new one?
- No.

590
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,337
Why not?

591
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,380
You should have taken better care
of the old one.

592
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,176
(Skunk)
lt would make me so happy.

593
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,178
Quiet, Skunk.

594
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,389
I'd just be the happiest child.

595
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,268
I'm trying to work, love.

596
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,979
(knocking on door)

597
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,401
♪ <i>I'd be delirious! ♫</i> ♪

598
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,654
lt's just not fair.

599
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,615
- I don't care.
- You don't care about me.

600
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,492
Yeah, he doesn't care about me.

601
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,035
(mimics telephone ringing)

602
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,163
Go away, Skunk!

603
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,374
He hates me. That's what he said.

604
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,793
- Please.
- Stop it.

605
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,628
Please, Dad.

606
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,880
- He wishes I was dead.
- What?

607
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,424
- Nothing.
- (beeps)

608
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,094
Please!

609
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,012
Emily!

610
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,141
I don't want to hear it again.

611
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,185
Do you understand me?

612
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,437
Do you understand me?!

613
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,109
(Jed, mockingly)
Emily.

614
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,088
(Dillon) What time is it?
(Skunk) Ten past ten.

615
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,382
(Skunk)
Do you think he's learnt his lesson yet?

616
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,301
- (girl yelps)
- Who's this?

617
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,094
(Susan laughs)

618
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,270
(Skunk)
Susan Oswald.

619
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,315
Slut.

620
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,191
No, she's not.

621
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,529
- Told you.
- (unzipping)

622
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,574
(sighs)

623
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,660
They call that fell-at-io.

624
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,205
(Susan moaning)

625
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,042
I have to go home.

626
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,841
(Kasia) Where have you been?
Why didn't you call?

627
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,218
I don't have a phone.

628
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:12,432
You little brat!
How dare you do what you just did!

629
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,976
Sit down!

630
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,773
(dialling)

631
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,654
Yes, she's here. She's fine.

632
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,825
(Skunk)
Sorry, Dad.

633
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,301
(breathes heavily)

634
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,018
(Skunk)
Dad.

635
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,978
My levels are off.

636
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,484
(Archie)
You can never forget how important this is.

637
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,652
I know.

638
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,365
I know it's routine, I know it's hard...

639
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,493
- Say it's okay, Dad.
- What?

640
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,995
I said I was sorry.

641
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,998
Now you have to say it's okay.

642
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,260
lt's okay.

643
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,394
What would you do if I died, Dad?

644
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,606
I can't even answer that question.

645
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,191
Would you cry?

646
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,401
Uh-huh.

647
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,861
A lot?

648
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,904
I don't think I'd ever stop.

649
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,448
What if I...

650
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,451
(groans and gasps)

651
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,458
(laughs)
Stop!

652
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,126
- No.
- Get off!

653
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,544
Get off!

654
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,712
(laughs)

655
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,383
- Tell about the night I was born.
- No.

656
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,969
- Go on.
- I don't know. Why?

657
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,889
- The night, or the...
- The dream.

658
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,224
- Please. Come on.
- No. Not again.

659
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,893
- Tell me.
- Why do you...

660
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,812
- I don't even know why you like this.
- I just do. Come on.

661
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,233
- All right, well, it's about this woman.
- Mm-hm.

662
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,320
- And different times in her life.
- Different moments. Yes.

663
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,946
- Different moments.
- Like what?

664
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,990
- I can't remember.
- Think.

665
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,950
- I can't remember.
- Try.

666
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,998
- Um... Well, some of them are sad.
- Hmm.

667
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,959
- But most of them are happy.
- Hmm.

668
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,587
(Skunk)
And the woman was me.

669
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,088
(Archie)
And the woman was you.

670
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,508
And the dream was my future.

671
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,926
I don't know about that.

672
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,095
I mean, that's what it felt like,
yeah, but, yeah...

673
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,807
But what did I look like?

674
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,769
Hideous.

675
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,146
You're nice.

676
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,523
Stunning.

677
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,942
And then you woke.

678
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:12,529
And then I woke, and I was happy
and I was sad all at the same time.

679
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,113
And Mum was there.

680
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,824
She was the one that woke me up.

681
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,452
And she said...

682
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,288
(both)
"Archie, she's here."

683
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,542
- Meaning me.
- Meaning you.

684
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,168
Well, you were the one
about to be born, weren't you?

685
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,461
(sniffs)

686
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,882
Oh, Skunk.

687
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,385
- I can't help it.
- I know.

688
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,061
(Archie)
You're such a strange girl.

689
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,813
(Skunk sniffs)

690
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,244
Wah!

691
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,162
Come on, let's get this done.

692
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,045
Here, you do it.

693
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,597
(Skunk humming)

694
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:30,023
♪ <i>Looking up at monsters in the clouds</i> ♪

695
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,736
♪ <i>Red's the colour when you're dead</i> ♪

696
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:38,615

697
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,410
♪ <i>Reading up on fairy tales... ♫</i> ♪

698
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,581
(door opens)

699
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,375
Skunk, we can go in now, love.

700
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,715
- Hi, Skunk.
- Hi.

701
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,218
(Mr Buckley)
Why don't you sit down there, Skunk?

702
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,720
(Skunk)
Okay.

703
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,266
- How are you?
- (Skunk) I'm fine.

704
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,728
- Why are you talking like that?
- (Mr Buckley) lt's his medication.

705
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,607
- Talking like what?
- Kind of groggy.

706
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,652
Am I?

707
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,154
(all chuckle)

708
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,449
Wow. You've got your own telly and all.

709
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,118
Oh, yeah. You know, I...
I watch, um...

710
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,089
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

711
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,842
- How's school?
- (Skunk) lt's fine.

712
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,177
We're actually on a half day today.

713
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,179
- lsn't she good to come, Rick?
- Yes, she is.

714
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,515
- She asked to, you know.
- She's really good.

715
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,185
I always thought
Skunk was really good, didn't I?

716
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,645
- (Mrs Buckley) Uh-huh.
- I don't know.

717
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,771
(all laughing)

718
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,317
What was it like?

719
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,985
Hmm?

720
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,195
You know, when you went kind of mad?

721
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,490
- That's...
- ls it all right if I say that?

722
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,664
Actually, it's really hard to describe.

723
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:15,712
But it's kind of like there was a toxic cloud.

724
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,381
- A toxic cloud?
- Yeah, or a...

725
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,176
a mist of evil or something.

726
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,553
Really?

727
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,722
- Or badness.
- Wow.

728
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,640
- Yeah.
- (both laugh)

729
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,350
ls it there right now?

730
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,228
(Mrs Buckley)
Uh... Less.

731
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,397
ln fact, Dr Sinclair was saying
at this rate of improvement,

732
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,982
Rick might be able to come home for the weekend.

733
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,316
- lsn't that right, son?
- When?

734
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,318
- Not, not now.
- No, no, no.

735
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,528
- No, not now.
- (Mr Buckley) No, not now.

736
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,029
But soon.

737
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,827
(laughs)

738
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,998
(Dillon)
I had an uncle who was a nutter like that.

739
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,208
- Thought he had worms in his hair.
- Oh, yeah?

740
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,335
Yeah, like nesting there.

741
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:00,047
Shaved it all off.
Been bald ever since.

742
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,342
- ls he better, though?
- No, he's worse.

743
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,679
He lives in Florida now.
D'you know, they have lizards there.

744
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,849
- What?
- Lizards, millions of 'em,

745
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,018
just walking round the streets.

746
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,686
(in American accent)
"Hey, how you doin'?"

747
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,062
(laughs)

748
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,398
You and I should go sometime, d'you know that?

749
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,608
When?

750
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,360
I don't know. One day.

751
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,238
Why? Would you come
if I asked you to?

752
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,448
Yeah.

753
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,200
What about that guy you're in love with?

754
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,202
- Mike.
- That teacher.

755
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,205
He'd understand.
I'm in love with you as well.

756
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,374
Sweet. They call that a "ménage à trois."

757
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,918
What does that mean?

758
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,377
Love triangle.

759
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,213
- Give us a kiss.
- No.

760
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,223
Nice one.

761
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,983
(Fiona)
I don't know. lt was like...

762
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,487
I think he just switched off
or something. Click.

763
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,741
Click and he just wasn't there any more.

764
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,910
(Sunrise)
Hello, fatty.

765
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,662
I haven't got it.

766
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,622
You haven't got it?

767
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:18,167
- Are you fucking joking?
- Let me go.

768
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,669
Let go!

769
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,797
(stifles laughter)

770
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:27,260
- Fucking laughing?
- No. I'm sorry, Sunrise.

771
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,469
Bitch, you're gone!

772
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,762
History, yeah?

773
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:34,267
You're now officially on the list.
Just you fucking wait!

774
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,935
Dumpy little turd.

775
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,356
(Vikram)
Does he die?

776
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,691
(Mike)
I can't tell you if he dies or not

777
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,318
because that's why we read, to find out, okay?

778
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,487
But let's just all agree there is a chance

779
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,364
that he may die, all right?

780
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,116
- (Vikram) I don't want him to.
- All right.

781
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,035
(clears throat)
Now, why do we think he goes on? Kevin?

782
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,287
Well, his life was rubbish, weren't it?

783
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,621
And boring.

784
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,790
Whereas through the doors
there could be wicked shit.

785
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,293
- Like dragons.
- Like dragons and shit.

786
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,003
- Trolls.
- Yeah, like teachers.

787
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,671
(overlapping chatter)

788
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,715
(Mike)
Everyone, just wait, wait.

789
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,341
That, what Kevin said,

790
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,970
is the definition of courage. Right?

791
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,638
Being afraid...

792
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,310
but doing it anyway.

793
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,312
(Vikram) I still would not go.
(Boy) 'Course you wouldn't go.

794
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,855
(Vikram) I wouldn't want to die.

795
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,692
- He doesn't die, Vikram.
- You told me the end!

796
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,193
Why did you have to ruin it?

797
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,821
(all yelling)
Why? Why?

798
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,574
(yelling continues, echoes)

799
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,524
You all right?

800
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,367
(Skunk grunts)

801
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,869
- Please...
- Frigid slut.

802
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,204
- Please.
- Hold her.

803
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,705
I'm trying.

804
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,043
- Well, kick her while she's down, then.
- I am!

805
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,128
- Properly, in the ribs.
- I am! Watch! I am!

806
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,381
- Do it harder than that.
- God, shut up!

807
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,590
Do it in the ribs, not the arm.

808
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,051
- Shut up! I'll kick you next time!
- Harder!

809
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,387
- What you doing?
- What the hell is going on here?

810
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,471
Come on.

811
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,139
Skunk, you all right?

812
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,558
Listen, if you fucking touch me
like that again, I'll report you.

813
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,643
- Oh, you'll report me, will you?
- Yeah.

814
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,228
How old are you? Come on!

815
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,896
- She's half your size.
- Oh, fuck off, you paedo.

816
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,398
(Mike) Go on, get out of here.
Get out of my sight.

817
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,650
- Hey, Sunrise, get back here.
- What are you doing? That's my sister.

818
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,151
- Stay right there.
- Don't talk to my sister like that.

819
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,277
(Mike)
Come here.

820
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,071
- Fucking queer.
- Down there. Stand down there.

821
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,823
- You, be quiet.
- Why are you listening to him for?

822
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,992
- He's a teacher, Sas.
- Yeah, just get out of here!

823
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,996
(Mike) For the next two weeks,
you're gonna come here for...

824
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,415
(Sunrise) Yeah, right.
(Mike) Sunrise, look at me.

825
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,587
For an hour and a half's detention
after school, starting tomorrow.

826
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,023
Do you understand?

827
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,435
Good. Go home.

828
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,442
(Mike)
She had a bit of a run-in with another girl,

829
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,527
but we sorted it out and everything's fine,

830
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,529
so don't worry, it's...

831
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,781
Mike rescued me.

832
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,491
- (Kasia) Really?
- Hmm.

833
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,454
- Can I have a jam sandwich?
- Okay.

834
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,541
Go change out of your uniform first.

835
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,834
(groans)

836
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,966
(clears throat)

837
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,011
Here, I'll... I'll get that.

838
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,308
(muttering)
Butter...

839
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,531
You know, it's kind of weird, isn't it,

840
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,575
when you're in the middle of something,

841
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:23,704
how things can be so, uh, confusing, you know?

842
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,414
- Unclear.
- What are you talking about?

843
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,417
No. Whereas, you know,
what I'm saying is,

844
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:34,006
whereas with a bit of time
and a bit of distance and perspective,

845
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,674
things kind of...

846
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,598
Look, whatever you want...

847
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,350
Sorry?

848
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,895
A house, a baby,

849
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,940
whatever you want, I'll give you.

850
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,195
- That's very kind of you, Mike.
- That's what I'm saying.

851
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,364
lt took me, I don't know,
stepping away...

852
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,532
(Kasia)
To get a perspective.

853
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:03,202
Yes, and to realise
that the things that you want, Kasia,

854
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,247
the things that you want are,
are the things that I want.

855
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,916
Mike, I'm with Archie now.

856
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,045
I'm sorry.

857
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,132
(Mike)
You're with fucking Ar... Archie?

858
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,800
(Kasia)
Yes.

859
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,218
(Mike)
As lovers?

860
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:25,224
Well, what? Are you in love?

861
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,477
Yes.

862
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,566
Well, I'm s... I'm so fucking...
I'm happy for you.

863
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,609
I'm so fucking happy for you!

880
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,985
- What the fuck?
- (Jed) Skunk.

881
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,532
(Skunk) What were you doing?
(Jed) You know what.

882
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,034
(Skunk)
Why?

883
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,995
- I don't know.
- Why her?

884
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,830
I don't know!

885
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,667
Just promise you won't tell anyone.

886
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,503
All right. I just really...

887
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,672
- You haven't promised.
- I promise.

888
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,349
I just don't understand
why people would do that.

889
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,228
- lt's what you do when you're in love.
- You're in love?

890
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,231
Well, I am. I don't know about her.

891
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,234
- What if she's pregnant?
- She's not...

892
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,527
- Well, what if?
- Skunk!

893
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,237
(Sunrise)
Whose could it be?

894
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,240
- Simon Malloy's.
- (Sunrise) Okay.

895
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,200
Jed Cunningham. Dennis Woods.

896
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,868
Jed Cunningham?

897
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,287
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

898
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,788
Who else?

899
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,207
(Susan)
A couple of guys, I can't remember their names.

900
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,711
- Who's that one with the dreadlocks?
- Brian Williams.

901
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,714
- He's gonna fucking kill me, Sunrise!
- Shut up!

902
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,759
Just let me think.

903
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,140
(door closes)

904
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,979
(sighs)

905
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,402
(DC Carson)
And when's the last time you saw Miss Oswald?

906
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,405
Uh... Last Tuesday.

907
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,574
Where?

908
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,576
Outside the school.

909
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:35,914
Uh, she was attacking another child,
so I had to...

910
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,586
Sorry, did you say Sunrise?

911
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,340
- Sorry?
- Um, Sunrise Oswald?

912
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,342
Susan.

913
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,469
- What did we say?
- Susan.

914
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,513
Oh, right, sorry, 'cause I don't know Susan.

915
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,350
lt was Sunrise who I reprimanded.

916
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,144
- (DC Carson) You don't know her?
- No.

917
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,355
Well, I mean, I know her, she's in the school,

918
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,274
but I've never had any contact with her.

919
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,650
(swallows)

920
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,861
(DC Carson)
I see.

921
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,363
Well, she claims you've been having an affair.

922
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,451
(laughs)
What?

923
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,792
Well, that's insane. She's a child.

924
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,877
(DC Jenks)
She's 14 years old, Mr Kiernan.

925
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,796
She's also pregnant.

926
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,308
- Mr Kiernan?
- (teacher) Can I help you?

927
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,227
- Mr Kiernan?
- Yes.

928
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,146
(child screams)

929
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,731
(grunts)

930
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,483
- lt's all right, don't worry.
- Everybody, get out!

931
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,653
(students screaming)

932
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,154
(Mike grunts)

933
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,824
Kids, out!

934
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,374
(panting)

935
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,344
(Skunk)
Mike.

936
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,846
(groans)

937
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,516
- (Sunrise) They're coming, Dad!
- (gasps)

938
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,561
(Bob)
All right, all right, all right.

939
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,522
Now, you know I'll be back, yeah?

940
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,566
You know I'll make sure
everything's all right, yeah?

941
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,943
- I love you so fucking much.
- Dad.

942
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,862
Oh, thanks, love.

943
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,949
And I love you so much, yeah?
Give us a kiss.

944
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,869
Come here, come here. Come here.

945
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,872
Oh, come on. Let's do a big
family fucking hug, yeah?

946
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,373
- (Sunrise) I love you, Dad.
- I love you so much.

947
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,792
- I love you, Dad. I love you.
- I love you, I love you, I love you.

948
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,628
I love you, I love you, I love you.

949
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,630
I love you, I love you, I love you.
I love you, I love you.

950
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,257
(Sunrise)
I love you, Dad.

951
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,761
Can you not cause a scene, all right?

952
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,889
Saskia, no boys, all right? No parties.

953
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,224
- Oh, fuck off.
- (girls shouting)

954
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,642
Fuck off, you cunt!

955
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,311
(shouting indistinctly)

956
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,274
- Girls, get back inside.
- Get the fuck out of here!

957
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,241
I've a right to call a solicitor, don't I?

958
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,244
- (DC Jenks) Yes.
- I'd like to do that now.

959
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,412
(knock on door)

960
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,917
Sorry.
Uh... Mr Kiernan's solicitor's here.

961
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,090
- So this is alleged?
- (DC Carson) Yes.

962
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,760
You haven't arrested my client?

963
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,804
(DC Carson)
For the moment, he's helping us with our inquiries.

964
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,265
- Get your jacket on.
- Wait a minute.

965
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,767
(Archie) No. She's a liar.
(DC Jenks) What?

966
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,602
(Archie)
She's done this type of thing before.

967
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,522
Another man,
another accusation, essentially of rape.

968
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,650
Another lie.

969
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,194
Look it up, Detective.

970
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,112
So you have a decision to make.

971
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:58,283
Either you release my client or...
you arrest him.

972
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,954
And then we'll take this matter further
as her story falls apart.

973
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,461
(Mike)
Thank you.

974
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,009
You can thank Kasia.

975
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,054
She's the one that asked me to...

976
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,722
(clears throat)
Right.

977
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,141
- ...come in for you.
- Yeah. How are you two doing?

978
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,312
Well, I don't really want to talk about that.

979
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:30,482
- Oh. Don't you?
- No.

980
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,818
(laughs)
Why is that, Archie?

981
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,487
ls that because what you have
is so fucking special

982
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,863
it can't be articulated, huh?

983
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,699
No, it's because it's none of your business.

984
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,908
Fuck you.

985
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,327
You know what? Fuck you.

986
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:47,165
The last thing I need
beyond losing the woman that I love

987
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,043
is to be obliged to the man
who fucking stole her.

988
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,837
- Well, I didn't steal her...
- Yeah, well, you fuck...

989
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,171
And there's no obligation.

990
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,506
Oh, fuck off, Archie!

991
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,010
Man, you couldn't be
more fucking patronising if you tried.

992
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,099
(Skunk) Then what?
(Archie) I don't know, love.

993
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,184
They'll probably give him some kind of DNA test.

994
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,686
- Right.
- Right.

995
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,896
- You know what that is, do you?
- Yes.

996
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,691
- No.
- lt's a test

997
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,861
- that'll show he isn't the father.
- But he isn't the father!

998
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,362
- We know that, love.
- She's a liar.

999
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,865
Everyone knows she's done it with...

1000
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,743
lots of boys.

1001
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,786
- lt doesn't matter, Skunk.
- Why not?

1002
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,038
Because they're boys.

1003
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,290
Mike is an adult. You understand?

1004
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,459
A teacher. ln this kind of situation,

1005
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,295
they have to be absolutely sure
of his innocence.

1006
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,755
(doorbell ringing)

1007
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:39,134
And until they are, they just can't
allow him to work with children.

1008
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,428
- So he's not coming back?
- (Archie) Not at the moment, no.

1009
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,640
Sorry, love.

1010
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,101
Skunk, it's your boyfriend.

1011
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,978
Birmingham?

1012
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:55,233
But I thought... I thought you and me
were gonna go to Florida

1013
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,236
- and see... see the lizards and stuff.
- Yeah, I know, but...

1014
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,905
That was when we were older.

1015
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,573
Why not now, though?

1016
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,743
Because my aunt says
I have to go to Birmingham, Skunk.

1017
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,912
What am I gonna do without you?

1018
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,668
- Here.
- (sighs)

1019
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:16,755
- Will you take this?
- Why should I?

1020
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,841
To remember me by.

1021
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,597
When do you go?

1022
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,933
Tomorrow.

1023
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:32,437
Early. So I'm not
gonna get to see you again.

1024
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,439
How long did you know that?

1025
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,485
How long did you know, Dillon?!

1026
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,278
- Skunk.
- You're only telling me now!

1027
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,947
- Why haven't you told me?!
- Skunk, stop.

1028
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,115
You're an arsehole, Dillon.

1029
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,117
I wanted to tell you, but I was afraid to.

1030
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,828
Please don't hate me.

1031
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,788
You're leaving me, Dillon.

1032
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,124
'Course I hate you.

1033
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,292
I'll always hate you!

1034
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,296
(Mrs Buckley)
Oh, it's lopsided.

1035
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,048
(Mr Buckley) It's okay.
(Mrs Buckley) No, it's not.

1036
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,174
(Mr Buckley)
It's fine.

1037
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,634
Fine?

1038
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,637
Well, I wanted it to be perfect.

1039
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,014
ls it edible?

1040
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,685
Well, of course it is.

1041
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:15,147
- Dave!
- Well, the message is...

1042
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,691
is clear enough.
That's all you want really, isn't it?

1043
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,361
Yeah, well... I suppose.

1044
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,323
Well, I'd better go.

1045
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,491
Hmm.

1046
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,034
He'll love it, Janet.

1047
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,536
Hmm.

1048
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,762
- (♫ drum and bass)
- (overlapping chatter)

1049
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,571
- Fuck off.
- Oi!

1050
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,380
- (doorbell ringing)
- Fuck off.

1051
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,549
ls anyone gonna get that?

1052
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,926
Saskia.

1053
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,552
(Saskia)
You get it.

1054
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,720
(ringing continues)

1055
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,101
(Girl)
Saskia. Saskia!

1056
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,486
- Yeah?
- All right?

1057
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,738
Can I ask you something?

1058
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,406
- What is it?
- Um...

1059
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,661
I just wanted you to know that,
if you wanted me to,

1060
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,412
I'd be the daddy.

1061
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,999
- The what?
- The... the dad.

1062
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:01,586
Uh... Of the baby.
T-Take responsibility for it.

1063
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,797
- You and me, we could get married.
- Jesus Christ.

1064
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,008
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah.

1065
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,845
Jed, we're having a party in here, all right?

1066
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:13,098
- Just don't call over again.
- But...

1067
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,865
(Archie)
Skunk? Are you okay?

1068
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,703
(Skunk)
Why didn't you tell me and Jed about you and Kasia?

1069
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,168
(Archie)
I'm sorry.

1070
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,881
- I was trying to find the right moment.
- Are you gonna marry her?

1071
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,800
- I don't know.
- Kasia, I know you're there!

1072
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:50,802
- Are you?
- I don't know, love.

1073
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,179
Because she'll leave us, Dad,
the way she left Mike.

1074
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,473
Like Mum left us. Like everyone does.

1075
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,310
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will! Don't lie.

1076
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:01,187
lt'll all go wrong, Dad.
Everything always goes wrong.

1077
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,523
- Why do only bad things happen?
- Good things happen.

1078
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,317
Like what, your sex with Kasia?

1079
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:09,571
- Skunk, listen.
- What about me or Jed or Rick or Mike?

1080
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,865
- What about Mike, Kasia?
- Skunk, you need to stop.

1081
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,869
I don't want to talk to either of you.
Just get out! lt's my room!

1082
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:17,913
So let's, as much as we can,

1083
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,206
confine things to the home
for the weekend, okay?

1084
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,584
- Yes.
- Just to be safe this first time out.

1085
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,377
- Thank you, Doctor. Yes.
- Not at all.

1086
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:25,712
- Best of luck, Rick.
- Thank you.

1087
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,339
Have a great weekend.

1088
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,737
(♫ dubstep)

1089
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:12,133
Susan. Susan. Susan?

1090
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,927
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1091
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,388
Susan. Susan!

1092
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,640
There's blood everywhere.
Why is there blood everywhere?

1093
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,559
(Sunrise) Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

1094
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:24,771
- Susan!
- Call a fucking ambulance!

1095
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,983
- What's the fucking number?
- 999, you twat!

1096
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,319
(Mr Buckley)
I wonder if she means we can't have a kick-about.

1097
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,487
(laughs)
Hmm.

1098
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,822
Wouldn't mind
a bit of a kick-about, eh, Rick?

1099
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,575
I think I'd rather stay inside, Dad.

1100
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:41,830
Oh, well, yes, you're probably right.
Best to... Best to play by the book.

1101
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:48,086
Oh, Mum's made a cake that's...
lt's... lt's a bit lopsided.

1102
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:51,297
Just, uh, thought
I should warn you. (chuckles)

1103
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,217
(police chatter on radio)

1104
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,930
Well, what's going on here?
Nothing changes. (sighs)

1105
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,891
Well, we won't let it bother us, huh?

1106
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:11,818
Hello, my baby. Hello.

1107
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:14,112
(Mr Buckley)
What's... What's happening?

1108
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,740
(Mrs Buckley) Oh, just don't pay any
attention. Um... What are you doing?

1109
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,324
(Mr Buckley) Well, I've got to...
I forgot the milk,

1110
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,285
so just put the kettle on, I won't be long.

1111
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,620
- Why isn't she talking?
- Let's just get her in the ambulance.

1112
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,998
(Saskia) She's not even moving.
(paramedic) Move out the way, please.

1113
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,458
(Saskia)
Just hurry up and get her in there.

1114
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,043
(Sunrise)
Just tell them.

1115
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,462
(Mrs Buckley) Rick. Come on, Rick.
Just... Just come inside.

1116
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,381
There's nothing going on there
that's of any interest. Come on.

1117
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,133
You getting a good look, are you?

1118
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,135
Right, let's go in. Let's go in.

1119
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,553
- (Saskia) Pervert!
- Rick, come on...

1120
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,680
lt's 'cause of fucking scum like you
that this is happening.

1121
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:43,183
- (Mrs Buckley) Just go inside.
- You sicko!

1122
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,518
Go on, just piss off inside,
you fucking pervert!

1123
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:47,854
Fucking evil bastard!

1124
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,566
(Saskia)
You sick...

1125
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,075
Cup of tea, love?

1126
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,079
Hmm?

1127
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,418
Where are you going?

1128
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,339
- To... To my room.
- But...

1129
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:18,343
- Just... Just for a little...
- But I made you a cake, love.

1130
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:21,429
- I'll have some later, Mum.
- But you just got here.

1131
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,515
Rick, please don't go
to your room. Please, don't.

1132
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,517
Don't mind what those people say.
Please, don't.

1133
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:29,521
- But they're right. They're right.
- No, they're not right.

1134
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:33,566
They could not be more wrong.
Rick, you are kind and you are good!

1135
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:35,527
- They're right!
- You are so good.

1136
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:38,571
- No, they're right, Mum!
- No, stop it! Come back, Rick!

1137
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,406
Don't go to your room!
Don't go, Rick!

1138
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,372
Oh, hello, sir.
Your change, please.

1139
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,540
Oh, sorry.

1140
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,792
- Miles away. Thanks very much.
- Thank you. Good night.

1141
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,085
(Mr Buckley)
Good night.

1142
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,830
(door opening)

1143
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:31,833
(door closes)

1144
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:35,420
(Mr Buckley)
Janet?

1145
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,298
Janet?

1146
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,259
Oh, Christ.

1147
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,844
Jesus Christ.

1148
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,847
I'm sorry, Dad.

1149
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,978
Rick?

1150
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:57,817
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1151
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:59,444
What did you do?

1152
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,037
I need to call someone.

1153
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,292
- lt's gonna be all right.
- They'll say I'm bad.

1154
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,128
- No, no, no.
- They'll say that I'm bad like before.

1155
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,546
They have to come and look after your mother.

1156
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,964
You don't have to tell them.

1157
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,132
lt's all right, Rick.

1158
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,218
- You'll be all right. Everything's fine.
- (dialling)

1159
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,969
You don't have to tell them.

1160
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,638
You don't have to tell them, Dad!

1161
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:42,487
(policeman)
Mr Oswald?

1162
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,225
(door opens)

1163
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,894
Hi, Rick.

1164
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:02,233
(door closes)

1165
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,901

01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,348
(sobbing continues)

1168
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,143
(no audio)

1169
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,825
(Bob sobs)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1170
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:05,671
(Archie)
I'm gonna kill her.

1171
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,216
- Maybe...
- Maybe what? Maybe what?

1172
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,641
She knows she can't come and go as she pleases.

1173
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,310
Call her again.

1174
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,396
She knows that from the last time.

1175
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,694
Skunk. Yeah, it's Dad.

1176
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:32,156
Yeah, listen, love,
I'm really, really, really worried,

1177
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,409
so could you call me, please, darling?

1178
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,577
All right. lt's Dad.

1179
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,331
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to look for her.

1180
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:42,166
- Dad.
- What?

1181
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,460
I think I might know where she is.

1182
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:45,545
(door slams)

1183
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,684

01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:13,865
- Whose are the cigarettes?
- They're not mine.

1188
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,242
- Can I just... Can I talk to you?
- This really isn't a good time.

1189
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:19,287

- Okay.

1190
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:24,459
(Mike) I just wanted to ring this once,

1191
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,627
Just to say sorry.

01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:30,256
- All right.
- You know, thank you for today

1193
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:33,217
and for, you know, for helping me out,

1194
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,428
- and for Archie, too...
- Okay.

1195
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:39,223
Listen, I was really rude to him
and I didn't mean to be.

1196
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,226
He's really a decent guy.

1197
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,729
And I wish you the very best.

1198
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,106
All right.

1199
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:52,069
And I...
Will you do one thing for me?

1200
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,113
(policeman)
Kids, they wander in...

1201
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,742
(Mike)
Will you just apologise to Skunk for me?

1202
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:01,078
We've spoken to her friends.
We've spoken to all of her friends.

1203
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:04,624
(Mike) For all the embarrassing shit

1204
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,668
- that she's had to witness.
- (Archie) No. So my daughter...

1205
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:08,753
(Kasia)
Okay, Mike.

1206
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,672
...has Type 1 diabetes,
do you understand?

1207
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,008
She has Type 1 diabetes!

1208
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:17,261
'Cause she's a terrific kid.

1209
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:18,846
(Archie)
So without...

1210
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,598
- lf she doesn't stay monitored...
- Okay, now just...

1211
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:21,766
- No! She could die!
- Dad!

1212
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:23,518
Do you understand me?!

1213
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,479
(Mike) You know, and someday
she's just gonna blow us all away.

1214
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,649
Do you reckon... She's...

1215
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:33,694
Kasia, someday she's just gonna
blow us all away.

1216
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,613
(sobbing)

1217
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,782
(Mike)
Anyway, that's all I have to say.

1218
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,287
Yeah, you have a good Iife, yeah?

1219
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:46,040
(Kasia)
You too, Mike.

1220
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,400
(breathing heavily)

1221
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,506
(both breathing loudly)

1222
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,560
(shuddering)

1223
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,867
(door opens)

1224
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:04,201
Hi, Rick.

1225
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:17,590
(Skunk moans softly)

1226
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,634
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

1227
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:23,471
I just want your goodness.

1228
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,310
(sobbing) I just want your goodness.

1229
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,901
(whimpers) I just want your goodness.

1230
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:40,237
I just want your goodness.

1231
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,948
(shuddering)

1232
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,660
(Rick sniffling)

1233
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,378
(sobbing) Shh...

1234
01:18:45,011 --> 01:18:47,471
Stop it, please. Stop it.
You have to stop it.

1235
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,641
Please stop it. Stop it.

1236
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:53,728
(sobbing)

1237
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,146
No! No...

1238
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,858
No, no, no, no!

1239
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,862
No, no, no! Please!

1240
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,310
(Sunrise) Did Dad come home?

1241
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:35,811
(Saskia) No.

1242
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:39,148
(Sunrise) Where is he?

1243
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,777
(Saskia) Don't know.

1244
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:47,490
(sighs)

1245
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,765
Jesus Christ.

1246
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,142
(thumping)

1247
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:17,561
Rick?

1248
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,739
(loud thumping)

1249
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:41,585
(mumbling)

1250
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,213
Yeah, hello, hello.
Can I get an ambulance, please?

1251
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:45,714
Archie!

1252
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,676
lt's in, uh... Archie!

1253
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:53,472
Uh, six... 13 Drummond Close.

1254
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,474
I don't fucking know. Just...
Archie!

1255
01:20:56,351 --> 01:21:00,646
What? I don't fucking know!
Some people have been stabbed as well.

1256
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:01,730
Please!

1257
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:04,567
Yes! Thank you. All right.

1258
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,736
(roars) Archie! Archie!

1259
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,450
Come on, darling.
Your daddy's coming.

1260
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,121
Your daddy's coming.
You're all right. You're all right.

1261
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:18,998
Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart.
Daddy's coming.

1262
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,246
(no audio)

1263
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:34,531
Rick.

1264
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:45,042
Where's my dad?

1265
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:56,387
(Archie) And there were
different times in her life.

1266
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,472
Different moments.

1267
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:04,019
Some of them were sad,
but most of them were happy.

1268
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:09,525
And the woman was you.
And she was stunning.

1269
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:20,619
And, um...

1270
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:28,127
(Rick) Are you ready?

1271
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:31,296
What's it like there?

1272
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:37,177
(Archie) Then your mum woke me up and she said,

1273
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:41,849
"Archie, she's here."

1274
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,147
Christ.

1275
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,778
You're my...

1276
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:59,033
You're my girl.

1277
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:05,789
Come back, Skunk.

1278
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,418
Please.

1279
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:13,005
Shall we go?

1280
01:24:13,673 --> 01:24:15,215
(hushed) Okay.

1281
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,765
(Archie whispers) Skunk.

1282
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,730
I'll be back in a minute.

1283
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,248
Why won't you say goodbye?

1284
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:57,716
Please, Dad, just... just say goodbye.

1285
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:04,973
(Rick) Skunk?

1286
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,059
Please.

1287
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,066
(sobbing)

1288
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,331
