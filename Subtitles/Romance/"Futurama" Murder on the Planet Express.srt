locking me out there like HAL.

Still don't trust me, huh?

188
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:51,781
Well, you can take your lack of
trust and jam it in your kidney hole.

189
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:58,203
The only person I trust is myself.

it doesn't make me into a sandwich

and leave it in the fridge where
some crawfish can get at it.

For the last time, Hermes,
I didn't steal your lunch.

Ow, ow, ow!

357
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:08,127
Wait a second, I know
what's going on here.

358
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,539
I'm the monster.

359
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,089
[Screeching]

360
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,209
[Chewing]

361
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,550
[Whimpering]

362
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:19,157
The creature was right behind me.

363
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:20,725
I don't know where it went.

364
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:24,296
[Groans] Just leave me alone.
I'm really, really scared.

365
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:26,164
Uh, Bender?

366
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:27,388
What?

367
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:29,217
Where'd you get those ears?

368
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:30,809
I've always had ears.

369
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,059
No, you haven't.

370
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,373
All right, fine, you got me. I can't
keep track of every little detail.

371
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:37,375
[Growls]

372
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:39,536
[Chewing]

373
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,585
[Both yell]

374
00:17:47,586 --> 00:17:49,988
Okay, to see if you're the real Bender,

375
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:52,223
I'm gonna ask you something
only he would know.

376
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:55,093
On your last birthday,
what gift did I get you?

377
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:56,974
- I don't remember.
- Me neither.

378
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,596
Okay, I'll ask you one.

379
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:01,866
What's the square root of 2,345.4?

380
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,786
That's not something I would know.

381
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:05,437
Oh, yeah. Your turn.

382
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:07,956
Um, what color is my shirt?

383
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:11,209
If I were the creature, I could
just look at your shirt, dum-dum.

384
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,210
Good point.

385
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:13,945
Aw, never mind this.

386
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,576
In case I'm about to die,

387
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:19,384
I just want you to know that I did
polish my ass with your toothbrush.

388
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,219
Thanks for telling me, buddy.

389
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,713
And to be honest, I am jealous
of how shiny your ass is,

390
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:29,104
and sometimes at night, I
unpolish it with sandpaper.

391
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:31,296
Aw, I trust you.

392
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:32,895
I trust you, too.

393
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:33,939
[Door whooshes open]

394
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,900
- Congratulations.
- [Both yell]

395
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:39,037
You two have really
learned the power of trust.

396
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,039
Get away from us, you monster.

397
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,859
[Laughs]

398
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,309
Don't worry. There
isn't really a monster.

399
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,111
And no one really got eaten.

400
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:49,580
The whole thing was just part
of our team-building experience.

401
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:51,883
And you two did terrific.

402
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:53,885
But-but what about that hitchhiker?

403
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,887
You mean my partner, Blorgulax?

404
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:58,156
He does make a convincing hitchhiker.

405
00:18:58,157 --> 00:19:00,258
But he majored in business at Princeton.

406
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:01,993
But we saw him change shape.

407
00:19:01,994 --> 00:19:04,062
Yes, he is a shape-shifter.

408
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,565
But he uses his shape-shifting
for team-building, not evil.

409
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:09,167
He pretends to eat some people.

410
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:10,502
The others have to work together.

411
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:12,103
We hand out a few tote bags.

412
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:15,840
And boom! Four percent increase
in productivity minimum.

413
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,575
So no one's dead?

414
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:22,013
Of course not. All your friends are
on the bridge having a pizza party.

415
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:26,754
So come on, put the
guns down and join us.

416
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,838
[Both grunting]

417
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:38,953
[Both sighing]

418
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:40,698
Ooh.

419
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:41,799
I think it moved.

420
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,380
[Both grunting]

421
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,899
[Both sighing]

422
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,782
[Door opens]

423
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:53,414
Hey guys, are you coming
to the party or not?

424
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:54,713
Where's McMasters?

425
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:57,219
He turned out to be such
a nice guy, didn't he?

426
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,410
Totally, we should go on a
retreat like this every year.

427
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:02,821
- Yeah!
- [All clamoring]

428
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:05,162
Every year!

429
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:15,914
<i>In other news celebrated businessman Dan
McMasters was last seen two weeks ago.</i>

430
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:20,226
<i>And authority's are now calling
his disappearance a homicide.</i>

431
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,688
We can't ever tell anyone
what really happened.

432
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,107
Never ever! I can trust you right?

433
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:28,549
100 percent till the end
of time. Can I trust you?

434
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,812
My lips couldn't be more
sealed, even if I had lips.

435
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,953
<i>Police have no leads, but are
offering a one million dollar reward,</i>

436
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:39,793
<i>for information leading to
the arrest of the killer.</i>

437
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:44,470
<i>In the event there are two killers,
police are offering an unusual deal...</i>

438
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:47,263
<i>Total immunity for the one

439
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:52,004

of two million dollars.</i>
