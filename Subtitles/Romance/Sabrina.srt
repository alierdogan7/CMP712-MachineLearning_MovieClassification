1
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,880
Once upon a time,

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,320
on the North Shore of Long Island,
some 30 miles from New York,

3
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,760
there lived a small girl
on a large estate.

4
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,440
The estate was very large indeed
and had many servants.

5
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,560
There were gardeners
to take care of the gardens

6
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,240
and a tree surgeon on a retainer.

7
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,040
There was a boatman to put the boats
in the water in the spring

8
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,040
and scrape their bottoms
in the winter.

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,480
There were specialists
to take care of the grounds,

10
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,120
the outdoor tennis court
and the indoor tennis court,

11
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,840
the outdoor swimming pool
and the indoor swimming pool.

12
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,600
And a man of no particular title

13
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,360
took care ofa small pool in the
garden for a goldfish named George.

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,520
Also on the estate there was
a chauffeur by the name of Fairchild,

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,640
who had been imported from England
years ago,

16
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,720
together with a new Rolls-Royce.

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,160
Fairchild was a fine chauffeur
of considerable polish,

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,920
Like the eight cars in his care.

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,760
And he had a daughter
by the name of... Sabrina.

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,440
It was the eve of
the annual six-metre-yacht races

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
and, as had been traditional
for the past 30 years,

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
the Larrabees were giving a party.

23
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,880
It never rained on the night
of the Larrabee party.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,720
The Larrabees
wouldn't have stood for it.

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,600
There were four Larrabees in all -
father, mother and two sons.

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,000
Maude and Oliver Larrabee
were married in 1906.

27
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,400
Among their many wedding presents
was a town house in New York

28
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,480
and this estate for weekends.

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,600
The town house has since been
converted into Saks Fifth Avenue.

30
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,280
Linus Larrabee, the elder son,
graduated from Yale,

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
where his classmates voted him

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,000
the man most likely
to leave his alma mater$50 million.

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,360
His brother, David, went through
several of the best Eastern colleges

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
for short periods of time,

35
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,160
and through several marriages
for even shorter periods of time.

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,600
He is now a successful
six-goal polo player

37
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,480
and is listed on Linus's tax return
as a $600 deduction.

38
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,480
Life was pleasant among
the Larrabees,

39
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,040
for this was as close to heaven
as one could get on Long Island.

40
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,200
Come on down from there, Sabrina!
Come on.

41
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,280
You'd better finish your packing.

42
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,080
Who's that girl, Father,
dancing with David?

43
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,360
Her name is Gretchen Van Horn.
Chase National Bank.

44
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,040
I hate girls that giggle
all the time.

45
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,760
You hate every girl David looks at.

46
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,720
You can't go on like this about
David. You've got to get over it.

47
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,360
Yes, Father.

48
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,600
It's good you're going away.
I only hope it's far enough.

49
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,320
Yes, Father.

50
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,400
Come along, Sabrina.

51
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,600
In a minute, Father. You go ahead.
I'll be up soon.

52
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,680
- Oh, it's you, Sabrina.
- Hello, David.

53
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,680
I thought I heard somebody.

54
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,280
No, it's nobody.

55
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,160
Gretchen! Yoo-hoo!
Tennis, anyone?

56
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
Gretchen?

57
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
What is this, mixed singles?

58
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,640
No! You have to stay on your side
of the net.

59
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,960
That'll be a little difficult,
Gretchen.

60
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,480
- You know the rules of the game.
- OK, I'll serve.

61
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,040
Sabrina!

62
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,720
Yes, Father?

63
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,040
- Don't leave your passport tomorrow.
- No, Father.

64
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,880
It's not every girl
that's lucky enough to go to Paris.

65
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,080
And it's the best cooking school
in the world.

66
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,960
If your mother were alive,
she'd be happy you were going there.

67
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,960
She was the best cook
on Long Island.

68
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm not saying you have to be a cook,
as she was,

69
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
or that I want you to marry
a chauffeur.

70
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
But you know how I feel.

71
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,720
Your mother and I
had a good life together.

72
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,000
We were respected by everyone.

73
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,400
That's as much as anyone can want.

74
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,720
Don't reach for the moon, child.

75
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,240
No, Father.

76
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,440
Besides, it never hurt a young girl
to learn how to cook, did it?

77
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,040
I'll wake you at seven.
The boat goes at noon. Good night.

78
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,800
Good night.

79
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,200
What's going on?

80
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Fairchild!

81
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,360
Anybody here?

82
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,840
Who's that?

83
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,920
Sabrina, come out of there. Come on.

84
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,320
Hello.

85
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,080
What are you doing here?

86
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,320
Just checking the spark plugs.

87
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,000
The what?

88
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,320
Father was worried
because a spark plug was missing.

89
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,520
I wanted to find out
which one it was.

90
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,120
So you started the motors
and closed the doors?

91
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,960
- I didn't want to disturb anyone.
- You might never have done so again.

92
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,320
- Does your father know?
- No! I wanted to surprise him.

93
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,120
We'd better get out.

94
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,360
There now. Breathe deep.

95
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,120
That's right. Now, deep breath.

96
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,880
- What happened?
- You passed out.

97
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,160
I'm alright.
You don't have to carry me.

98
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,720
Of all the idiotic things...

99
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,640
Haven't you ever heard of carbon
monoxide? It kills people.

100
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,400
It does?

101
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,840
What would have happened
if I hadn't come along?

102
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,120
I'd have died.

103
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,000
And fast. Eight cars!
One would have done it.

104
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,800
Good thing Mrs. Van Horn
asked me to drive her home.

105
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,000
Mrs. Van Horn? Gretchen's mother?

106
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,280
- Why didn't she drive her home?
- We can't find Gretchen.

107
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,360
- She...
- She what?

108
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,760
Nothing.

109
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,960
The next time you start a car, leave
the garage doors open. Understand?

110
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,680
A chauffeur's daughter
should know better.

111
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,240
Yes, sir.

112
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,000
Bonjour, mes dames et messieurs!

113
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,200
Yesterday we have learnt
the correct way how to boil water.

114
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,800
Today we will learn the correct way
how to crack an egg.

115
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,880
Voila, an egg!

116
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Now an egg is not a stone.
It is not made of wood.

117
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,400
It is a living thing with a heart.

118
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,840
So when we crack it
we must not torment it.

119
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,360
We must be merciful and execute it
quickly, like with the guillotine.

120
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,800
It is done with one hand.
Kindly watch the wrist.

121
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,800
Voila. One, two, three, crack!

122
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,040
You see? It is all in the wrist.

123
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,640
And now, everybody, take an egg.

124
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
One, two, three, crack!

125
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,040
New egg.

126
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,120
One, two, three, crack!

127
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,800
New egg. One, two, three, crack!

128
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,440
Take an egg. Crack!

129
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,400
The wrist, huh? Like a whip.
You watch.

130
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,520
One, two, three, crack! New egg.

131
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,960
"Dear Father, or Cher Papa
as we say over here."

132
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,040
"Isn't my French getting good?"

133
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,240
"We finally finished our four-week
course in sauces, thank goodness!"

134
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,640
"Soups were tough
but sauces just about killed me."

135
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,480
"I almost flunked my hollandaise.
It kept separating on me."

136
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,840
Too much vinegar.
Does she mention David?

137
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,040
Mr. Linus is ready to go into town.

138
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,240
- What does she say about David?
- Not a word.

139
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,320
No, wait. Here's something.

140
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,480
- "I don't think of David very much."
- That's good.

141
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,440
- "Except at night."
- That's bad.

142
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,960
"I decided to be sensible
and tore up his picture."

143
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,040
That's good.

144
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,880
- "Please mail me some Scotch tape."
- That's bad.

145
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,200
- Morning, Fairchild.
- Morning, sir. Beautiful day, sir.

146
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,440
Take the Parkway.
Two windows open. 35 miles an hour.

147
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,720
Yes, sir.

148
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,280
Morning. Where are you off to?

149
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,160
- The office, where do you think?
- On Sunday?

150
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,280
- Today is Wednesday.
- Wednesday?

151
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,240
This is KL 75263.
Get me Bowling Green 91099.

152
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,440
Good morning, Miss McCardle.
How did the market open?

153
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,600
Industrials, 247.63.
Up a dollar, ten.

154
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,920
Rails, 94.7. Up 58 cents.

155
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,320
Utilities, 47.23. Off 11 cents.

156
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,120
I'm just leaving.
Put the coffee on in 45 minutes.

157
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,880
Inter-office memo to David Larrabee.

158
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,480
Dear David, you are a junior partner
of Larrabee industries,

159
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,200
located at 30 Broad Street, New York.

160
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,720
Your office is on the 22nd floor.

161
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,240
Our normal week is Monday to Friday.
Our working day is nine to five.

162
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,640
If this is inconvenient
you may retire with your pension.

163
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,040
Having been with us one year,

164
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,120
your entitlement is 65 cents
a month for the rest of your life.

165
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
What do you hear from your daughter?

166
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,880
- She still loves him.
- I beg your pardon?

167
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,360
I mean
she loves the cooking school, sir.

168
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
But she'll get over it.

169
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,560
And now, mes dames et messieurs,

170
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,840
soon we will see how you have learnt
the lesson of the souffle.

171
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,120
The souffle, it must be gay.

172
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,560
Gay.

173
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Like two butterflies dancing
the waltz in the summer breeze.

174
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,800
Very well. You have five seconds!

175
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,360
Four seconds.

176
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,600
Three seconds.

177
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,800
Two seconds.

178
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,120
One second.

179
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,200
To the ovens!

180
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,200
Too low.

181
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,280
Too pale.

182
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,120
Too heavy.

183
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,840
Too low.

184
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,920
Too high. You are exaggerating.

185
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,960
Fair.

186
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,040
So-so.

187
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,080
Sloppy.

188
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,280
Mmm! Superb! My dear Baron,
you have not lost your touch.

189
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,120
Much too low.

190
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,320
- I don't know what happened.
- I will tell you.

191
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,440
You forgot to turn on the oven.

192
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,000
I have been watching you.

193
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,640
Your mind has not been on the
cooking. It has been elsewhere.

194
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,760
You're in love. And I will venture
to go a step further.

195
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,240
- You are unhappily in love.
- Does it show?

196
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,240
Very clearly. A woman happily
in love, she burns the souffle.

197
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,640
A woman unhappily in love,
she forgets to turn on the oven.

198
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,240
- Am I correct?
- Yes. But I'm trying to get over it.

199
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,960
Why try to get over it? You speak
of love like it was a bad cough.

200
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,760
He doesn't even know I exist.

201
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,320
I might as well be reaching
for the moon.

202
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,960
The moon?

203
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,040
Oh, you young people
are so old-fashioned!

204
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,640
Have you not heard? We are building
rockets to reach the moon.

205
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,080
To begin with, you must stop looking
like a horse.

206
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,560
Horse?

207
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,520
"His name is Baron Saint Fontanel."

208
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,040
Baron!

209
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,800
"He came here for a refresher course
in souffles

210
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,880
and liked me so much he decided
to stay on for the fish."

211
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,960
- What does she say about David?
- David? She's got a baron!

212
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,760
"The Baron is 74 years old,

213
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,920
and very sweet and very wise."

214
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,000
"He has a box at the opera,
a racing stable, wonderful paintings

215
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,560
and his own vineyards."

216
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,240
"Tomorrow night he is taking me
to a very fashionable charity ball

217
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,520
and I have a dress
just for the occasion."

218
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,680
"If David could only see me in it."

219
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,560
"Yards of skirt
and way off the shoulders."

220
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,840
Good morning, sir.

221
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,280
- Morning. What's going on?
- A letter from Sabrina.

222
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,160
Wouldn't you like to read it?
There's something about you.

223
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,160
- Poor Sabrina.
- What's wrong with him?

224
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,600
He's getting married again.

225
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,040
- He is?
- Number four.

226
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,840
Who says so?

227
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,200
Cholly Knickerbocker. Don't you
people ever read the society columns?

228
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,240
- Is my brother in?
- Yes, Mr. David, but he's very busy.

229
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,320
- I want to see him.
- How about 3:30?

230
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,440
- I want to see him now!
- I'm sorry. I have my orders.

231
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,440
He's working on the plastics deal.

232
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,080
Press that button,

233
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,280
or I'll break that door down
using you as a battering ram!

234
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,760
- Mr. David!
- Make up your mind!

235
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,720
Linus, I want to talk to you!

236
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,040
- Ask for an appointment.
- Don't give me that! I'm mad!

237
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,760
Alright, gentlemen,
I'll be ten minutes.

238
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,240
Now what's the trouble?

239
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,160
How did this get in the paper?

240
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,240
"David Larrabee is to marry again."

241
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,440
"The girl is Elizabeth Tyson
of the Oyster Bay Tysons."

242
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,120
- Congratulations.
- Did you plant this?

243
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,280
It's common knowledge about you and
Elizabeth Tyson. Don't you like her?

244
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,720
I like her a lot.
I like a lot of girls a lot.

245
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,040
- You can say that again.
- What are you doing with that gun?

246
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,880
Put that thing away, Linus!

247
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,920
Look at that. The greatest plastic
ever made. Not a scratch.

248
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,880
I wonder how this'd stand up
against a bazooka.

249
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,320
Miss McCardle, ask General Stanton
if we can borrow a bazooka.

250
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,800
Yes, Mr. Larrabee.

251
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,960
- To get back to my problem...
- Lend me your lighter.

252
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,640
Linus, I have no intention
of marrying Elizabeth Tyson!

253
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,440
Doesn't burn, doesn't scorch,
doesn't melt. How about that!

254
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,360
I've been married before.
I've had it three times.

255
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,440
This time the family approves.

256
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,640
You're going to do
something constructive. Taste it.

257
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,000
What's constructive
about marrying her?

258
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,440
- Taste it.
- It's sweet.

259
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,520
It's made of sugar cane.

260
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,160
Sugar cane.

261
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,800
Wait a minute.

262
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,880
The Tysons own the largest holdings
of sugar cane in Puerto Rico!

263
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
Second largest.
The largest have no daughter.

264
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,560
It's all beginning to make sense.

265
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,280
Mr. Tyson owns the sugar cane,
you own the formula for the plastics

266
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,280
and I'm offered as a sacrifice
on the altar of industrial progress!

267
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,880
You make it sound as if the son
of the hot-dog dynasty

268
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,680
had to marry the daughter
of the mustard king.

269
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,200
Surely you don't object to Elizabeth
because her father has $20 million?

270
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,200
That's very narrow-minded of you.

271
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,840
Just one thing. I haven't proposed
and she hasn't accepted.

272
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,640
Oh, don't worry.
I proposed and Mr. Tyson accepted.

273
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,800
- Did you kiss him?
- Elizabeth is a lovely girl.

274
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,360
Sooner or later you'll propose.
I'm helping you make up your mind.

275
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,080
- Then you marry her.
- Me?

276
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,160
What's so funny?

277
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,760
If I got married, I'd have to take
a Dictaphone, two secretaries

278
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,240
and four corporation counsellors
along on the honeymoon.

279
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,160
I'd be unfaithful to my wife
every night

280
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,280
with vice presidents, boards of
directors, slide-rule accountants...

281
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,480
This... this is my home.
No wife would ever understand it.

282
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,920
Nor me. You've got all the money
in the world.

283
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,880
Making money isn't the main point
of business. Money is a by-product.

284
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,480
- What's the main objective? Power?
- Ah! That's become a dirty word.

285
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,360
What's the urge? You're going into
plastics. What will that prove?

286
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,280
Prove? Nothing much.

287
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,760
A new product has been found,
something of use to the world.

288
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,640
A new industry moves into
an undeveloped area.

289
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,960
Factories go up, machines go in
and you're in business.

290
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,200
It's coincidental that people who've
never seen a dime now have a dollar

291
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,280
and barefooted kids wear shoes
and have their faces washed.

292
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
What's wrong with an urge

293
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,960
that gives people libraries,
hospitals, baseball diamonds

294
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,320
and movies on a Saturday night?

295
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,840
- Send in the secretaries.
- Yes, Mr. Larrabee.

296
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,800
You make me feel like a heel.

297
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,000
If I don't marry her, some kid
will run around Puerto Rico barefoot!

298
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,280
Look at this stuff.
Planes and suits will be made of it

299
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,080
and you'll probably be able
to eat it.

300
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,960
We're organising Larrabee Plastics.
Larrabee Construction has the plans.

301
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,800
Larrabee Shipping bought nine more
freighters to handle the traffic.

302
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,400
- The wheels are in motion already?
- That's what I mean.

303
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,560
Would you demonstrate the weight test
to Mr. David, please?

304
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,520
- Linus, I believe you.
- Up you go.

305
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,480
I want you to see
how resilient it is.

306
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,560
Bounce, please, ladies.

307
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,920
Some plastic, eh?

308
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,640
We'd like a summer wedding
to get in on this year's sugar crop.

309
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,520
Yeah.

310
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,040
I think
you're going to be very happy.

311
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,640
Dearest Father,

312
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,600
we shall be graduating next week
and I shall be getting my diploma.

313
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,480
I want to thank you now for the two
most wonderful years of my life.

314
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,640
I shall always love you
for sending me here.

315
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,760
It is late at night

316
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,000
and someone across the way
is playing "La Vie En Rose".

317
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,160
It is the French way of saying,

318
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,520
I am looking at the world
through rose-coloured glasses.

319
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,400
It says everything I feel.

320
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,960
I have learnt so many things,
Father.

321
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,640
Not just how to make vichyssoise or
calf's head with sauce vinaigrette,

322
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,360
but a much more important recipe.

323
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,400
I have learn how to live,

324
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,400
how to be in the world
and of the world...

325
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,280
-and not just to stand aside
and watch.

326
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,280
And I will never, never again
run away from life,

327
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,360
or from love, either.

328
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,040
I am taking the plane home
on Friday, Father.

329
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,680
You needn't pick me up
at the airport.

330
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,400
I'll just take
the Long Island Rail Road

331
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,240
and you can meet me at the train -
the 4:15.

332
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,200
If you should have any difficulty
recognising your daughter,

333
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,800
I shall be the most sophisticated
woman at the Glen Cove station.

334
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,600
Taxi, miss?
Cheapest rates in Glen Cove.

335
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,320
Hello! How are you?

336
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,400
Well, I'm fine. How are you?
And I might add, who are you?

337
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,040
- Who am l?
- Am I supposed to know?

338
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,800
No, you're not supposed to know.

339
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,880
- Are you stranded?
- My father was meant to pick me up.

340
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,960
Whoever your father is,
I'll be eternally grateful.

341
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,960
- That is if I can give you a lift.
- You can drive me home.

342
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,040
Good! I'll get your bags.

343
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,880
- Where do you live?
- Dosoris Lane.

344
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,200
Dosoris Lane?
Say, that's where I live!

345
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,040
- Really?
- Sure. We must be neighbours.

346
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,960
And I believe in
loving thy neighbour.

347
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,520
Oh, so do l.

348
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,600
Come on, David.

349
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,320
- David? Is his name David?
- Yes, it is.

350
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,640
That's funny. My name's David, too.

351
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,640
That is funny, isn't it?

352
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,880
Sure you don't want
to tell me your name?

353
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,120
Positive.
I'm having much too much fun.

354
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,480
Alright, if you want to play games...

355
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,400
- Have you always lived here?
- Most of my life.

356
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,280
I'd swear I know every pretty girl
on the North Shore.

357
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,000
You take in more territory than that.

358
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,080
This is maddening.
I've seen that face before.

359
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,400
Let me see your profile again.

360
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,000
I know I know you.

361
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,080
I have a feeling I've seen you...
with your father.

362
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,520
Wait!
Is your father Admiral Starratt?

363
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,680
Hardly.

364
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,600
Funny.
I keep seeing him in a uniform.

365
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,000
Give us a hint.
What does your father do?

366
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,520
- He's in transportation.
- Transportation?

367
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,720
- Railroads. New York Central.
- No.

368
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,800
- Planes. TWA.
- No.

369
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,080
- Boats. United States Lines.
- No.

370
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,280
- I pass.
- Automobiles.

371
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,200
Oh? Chrysler?

372
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,760
Yes, Chrysler and Ford
and General Motors and Rolls-Royce.

373
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Is he on the board
of all those companies?

374
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,880
You might say he runs things.

375
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,000
- I bet my brother Linus knows him.
- He certainly does.

376
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,960
They often drive into town together.

377
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,480
They do?

378
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,320
Straight through to the garage,
please.

379
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,120
I feel so stupid I could kill myself.

380
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,440
You'll be alright in a minute.

381
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,840
Here we are.

382
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,720
I'm not just pretending we've met
somewhere before. We have met some...

383
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,280
You don't live here. I live here.

384
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,360
Hi, neighbour!

385
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,800
Sabrina!

386
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,200
Hello, Margaret!
It's so good to be home!

387
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,960
Look at you! You've come home
such a beautiful lady!

388
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
Oh, welcome home, Sabrina!

389
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
Ernest! Jenny! How are you?

390
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,560
Don't cry, Margaret.
It's nothing to cry about.

391
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,560
I bought you a hat, a Paris hat
for you to wear to church on Sundays.

392
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,720
Jenny, I have something for you...

393
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,840
Father!

394
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,080
I'm sorry. I had to take Mrs. Larrabee
to the hairdresser.

395
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,400
It doesn't matter.

396
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,400
I wouldn't have recognized you
anyway.

397
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,920
David had a little trouble,
didn't you?

398
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
Yes, I did.

399
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,160
I'll make coffee.
Will you come to the kitchen?

400
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,040
- As soon as I've opened my bags.
- I'll take them upstairs.

401
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,120
As old neighbours
the two of us should have a reunion.

402
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,080
- It's only fair.
- Tonight?

403
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,320
- Do you really want to see me?
- Very much.

404
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,600
- Sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

405
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,680
- Alright.
- We'll go out on the town.

406
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,600
We'll drive to New York, have
a quick drink, then go for dinner.

407
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,880
I know a wonderful French restaurant
on First Avenue.

408
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,360
I guess you wouldn't think
so much of it after Paris.

409
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,440
I'll love it!

410
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,120
We'll go dancing.

411
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,800
When they throw us out of EI Morocco,
we'll go to the Village.

412
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,240
You like Dixieland bands?
I know the greatest. It's...

413
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,080
Wait, I forgot.
We're having a party here tonight.

414
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,360
With an orchestra and dancing?
That'll be even more fun.

415
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,200
I don't know.
A lot of dull people. Family stuff.

416
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,120
I don't mind if you're there.

417
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,480
- Sabrina?
- In a minute, Father.

418
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,320
I have a lovely evening dress
with yards of skirt.

419
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,840
- Shall I wear it?
- Why, yes, of course.

420
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,000
This couldn't be nicer.
A homecoming party!

421
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,400
I'll get the dress out
and press it.

422
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,120
See you tonight.

423
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,440
Hello, Linus. I'm back!

424
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,040
It's Sabrina.
Would you have recognized her?

425
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,320
That scrawny kid who'd run away
when she saw us,

426
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,040
her knees painted with Mercurochrome.

427
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,680
How do you like those legs now?
Aren't they something?

428
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,000
David, the last pair of legs
that were something

429
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,480
cost the family $25,000.

430
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,960
Look what I brought you from Paris.

431
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,120
Sabrina, I should have mentioned it
in a letter...

432
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,960
- Here. Do you like it?
- But I didn't want to upset you.

433
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,400
Aren't they gaudy?

434
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,880
Sabrina, David is engaged.
He's getting married again.

435
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,720
I know. Margaret wrote me.

436
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,400
Brandy. And this is for you to wear
on your day off.

437
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,760
- Then you don't care?
- Not too much. He's not married yet.

438
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,480
I don't like that.
I don't like the sound of it.

439
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,560
Father, everything has changed.

440
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,520
Nothing's changed.
He's still David Larrabee.

441
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,840
And you're still
the chauffeur's daughter.

442
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,760
And you're still reaching for
the moon.

443
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,280
No, Father.
The moon's reaching for me.

444
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,120
I wish the wedding were tomorrow,
David.

445
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,440
- Don't you?
- Yes, dear.

446
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Ten more days.
It'll seem more like ten years.

447
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,480
Yes, dear.

448
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,680
Father had planned for us to fly
to Honolulu afterwards. I said not.

449
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,080
I don't want to spend the first
18 hours of my honeymoon in a plane.

450
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,040
- Do you?
- Yes, dear.

451
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,360
- David!
- What? I mean, no. What did you say?

452
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,800
- Aren't you interested?
- Of course, dear.

453
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,240
- Aren't they a sweet couple!
- Charming. Elizabeth is lovely.

454
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,320
Why do young men wear white jackets
in the evening?

455
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,400
They look like barbers!

456
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,360
- Now, Oliver...
- My throat's dry.

457
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,720
- Have you been smoking?
- I've stopped smoking.

458
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,320
It's sad
that after 48 years of marriage

459
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,920
distrust should creep
into our relationship.

460
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,640
I'll join the men in the library.

461
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,480
David? I think I ought to have
a talk with your chauffeur.

462
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,040
What for?

463
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,640
Father wants to give me a car
and your chauffeur could tell me...

464
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,720
Sure, sure. Of course.

465
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,680
- What's his name?
- Sabrina.

466
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,240
I mean Fairchild.
I'll talk to him. Don't bother.

467
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,680
Alright, darling. I know
you'll take care of everything.

468
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,040
What is it, David?

469
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,760
- Would you like to get some food?
- No, thank you.

470
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,840
- A drink?
- No.

471
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,200
- I'm terribly sorry!
- It's my fault. I didn't see you.

472
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,360
- Will it wash out?
- Yes.

473
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,320
- You'd better do it now.
- Come on, Elizabeth. I'll help you.

474
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,240
Sabrina!

475
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,800
David!

476
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,160
- Hello.
- You look wonderful.

477
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,760
- Thank you. I'm a bit late.
- I worried.

478
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,200
Were you afraid I'd forgotten
the address?

479
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,040
It crossed my mind.

480
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,760
- Shall we dance?
- Right here?

481
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,720
- Who is that girl?
- I don't know.

482
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,520
I wonder what happened to Elizabeth.

483
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,040
- What a lovely party.
- It is now.

484
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,160
The nicest one you've ever had.
And I've been to all your parties.

485
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,600
- You have?
- Standing up there in that tree.

486
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,080
Sabrina, if I'd only known.

487
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,360
Sabrina,
where have you been all my life?

488
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,200
- Right over the garage.
- Right over my car.

489
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,040
Right up in that tree.
What a fool I was.

490
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,520
And what a crush I had on you.

491
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,640
It's not too late, is it?

492
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,960
I don't know, David. Is it?

493
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,160
You should see her!
You should see Sabrina!

494
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,960
The prettiest girl.
The prettiest dress. The best dancer.

495
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,560
The belle of the ball.

496
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,000
- It's as if she belonged up there.
- I don't like it.

497
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,720
- Is she dancing with David?
- That's right.

498
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,080
He's holding her so close
I don't see how she can breathe.

499
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,000
And the way they look
into each other's eyes...

500
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,320
- I don't like it.
- Tom, be happy for her.

501
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,280
This is what she wanted.
It's where she belongs.

502
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,480
It's not.
And it's not where I belong.

503
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,960
Remember the chauffeur
on the Harrington estate?

504
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,120
His daughter fell in love
with the son.

505
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,760
Next he was driving the family
to the church, changing his uniform

506
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,400
and then giving the bride away.

507
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,600
- That's not for me. I don't like it.
- That was 25 years ago.

508
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,680
Come on. Let's sneak up and see her.

509
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,960
David?

510
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,240
- Hello, Mother.
- I don't know this lady.

511
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,040
- You do.
- Good evening, Mrs. Larrabee.

512
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,000
- Mother, this is Miss Fairchild.
- Sabrina?

513
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,520
Yes, of course.

514
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,440
Yes, of course.

515
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,120
Of course. Sabrina.

516
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,640
You didn't recognize me, did you?
Have I changed?

517
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,000
You certainly have.
You look lovely, Sabrina.

518
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,920
I thought it'd be fun to ask her
to the party as a welcome home.

519
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,840
David's been wonderful.
He met me at the station.

520
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,440
Did he? How nice of him.

521
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,560
- She's been to Paris.
- Yes, I know.

522
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,000
Come and cook something
very special for us, Sabrina.

523
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,440
- I want to see what you've learnt.
- I've learnt a lot.

524
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,440
Bye.

525
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,320
This is such fun. So much more fun
than just watching from that tree.

526
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,800
I'm glad you came home.
I'll never let you go away again.

527
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,600
- Never?
- Never.

528
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,240
Would you like to kiss me?

529
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,920
- Would l?
- Yes. A nice, steady kiss.

530
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,280
- Not on roller skates this time.
- Roller skates?

531
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,360
- You don't remember?
- I remember I had a pair.

532
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,160
I was nine
and you had your arms around me

533
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,280
because you were teaching me
to skate backwards.

534
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,800
Suddenly, you kissed me.
I've never forgotten.

535
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,680
- Sabrina, let's get out of here.
- Yes, let's.

536
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,160
I tell you what. You slip away first.
I'll meet you at...

537
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,600
The indoor tennis court.

538
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,560
- And you'll bring champagne.
- Of course.

539
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,200
You saw a lot from that tree!

540
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,880
Will you have the orchestra play
Isn't It Romantic?

541
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,880
Naturally.

542
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,160
- Where's David?
- He's being a good host.

543
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,680
I'll get him out of circulation.
Thank you.

544
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,680
Got a minute, David?

545
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,080
- Not now.
- The old man wants to see you.

546
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,800
- I'm busy.
- He's frothing at the mouth.

547
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,040
- What about?
- You guess.

548
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,120
- Animal, vegetable or mineral?
- Definitely animal.

549
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,480
Linus, this boy should be drummed out
of the family!

550
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,120
What have I done now?

551
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,840
I'm not saying
all Larrabees have been saints.

552
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,920
Thomas Larrabee was hung for piracy.
Benjamin Larrabee was a slave trader.

553
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,240
And Joshua Larrabee was shot
while attempting to rob a train.

554
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,840
But no Larrabee has behaved
as you have behaved tonight!

555
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,640
- Exactly what have I done?
- Done?

556
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,680
Father,
remember your basal metabolism.

557
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,000
Making love to a servant
in your mother's house!

558
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,760
- She is not a servant.
- She's a servant's daughter.

559
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,120
You have embarrassed
your mother and our chauffeur.

560
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,760
I've too much respect for Fairchild
to intrude on his personal life.

561
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,800
You should have that respect for her.

562
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,600
I have so much respect for her
I invited her.

563
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,840
- That's overdoing it.
- I love her!

564
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,920
He loves her!

565
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,200
Next thing he'll elope with the girl
in the middle of the night!

566
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,560
Maybe!

567
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,800
I'll overlook you're an engaged man

568
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,920
and remind you of your marital record
to date.

569
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,640
I know, Father.
I made three mistakes.

570
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,000
First, that Hungarian countess, who
married you to bring her family over.

571
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:12,080
Her parents and five brothers, all of
them needing costly dental repairs!

572
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,480
- Do we have to go through it again?
- Then that Twyman girl.

573
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,000
Her family 50 years
on the social register.

574
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:22,480
She wore on her wedding dress not
a corsage but a Stevenson button!

575
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,240
You promised not to swear.

576
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,160
Then that great actress!

577
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,400
All she does is commercials on
television for an underarm deodorant.

578
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,320
And now our chauffeur's daughter!

579
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,160
- Father, are you through?
- I am not through!

580
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,800
I'm sure Linus
has a few words to say.

581
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,280
I do.
But you won't like them, Father.

582
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,880
- You're being unfair to David.
- I'm what?

583
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,960
David's old enough to live his life.

584
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,400
- If she's the girl for him...
- Nonsense!

585
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,880
You really mean that?
It would knock your plans.

586
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,880
The plastics merger? Forget it.
If you love her, take her.

587
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,440
- This is the 20th century.
- The 20th century?

588
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,960
I could pick a century out of a hat
and get a better one!

589
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,880
You will get rid of that girl
and apologise to your fiancee!

590
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,720
Now, Father, don't push him. Let's
discuss this like civilised people.

591
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,800
- Sit down, David.
- Thank you, Linus.

592
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,280
I have to go. You two work it out.

593
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,840
- Do you want me to help you?
- Of course.

594
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,720
Then sit down.

595
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,760
You're the only one who understands.

596
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,640
- What is it? What happened?
- Champagne glasses. I sat on them.

597
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,400
- On the chair?
- No. In my pocket!

598
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,440
Sabrina?

599
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,920
Hello.

600
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,480
You did order champagne, didn't you?

601
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,560
- What are you doing here?
- David sent me.

602
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,760
- Isn't he coming?
- I don't think he can make it.

603
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,480
- What happened?
- He got stuck.

604
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,880
Stuck?

605
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,320
Nothing serious.
One of those things.

606
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,960
Shall I serve it up there
or will you come down?

607
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,280
- Up there? Alright.
- No, I'll come down.

608
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,200
We meet under the most peculiar
circumstances.

609
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,400
Either you're under eight cars
looking for a spark plug

610
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,600
or you're up here umpiring a tennis
match between two imaginary players.

611
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,040
Oh, you look lovely, Sabrina.
And very grown up.

612
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,400
- I'll get back to the party.
- And leave me here?

613
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,760
What did David say?

614
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,960
I haven't seen him in such a state

615
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,360
since he was kicked in the head
by a polo pony.

616
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,600
- That's nice.
- Amnesia has definitely set in.

617
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,160
He's completely forgotten
he's engaged. He wants you.

618
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,680
And I want him. I've been in love
with him all my life.

619
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,400
- There goes the engagement!
- You don't object?

620
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,800
Object? To you? It's as though
a window had been thrown open

621
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,960
and a lovely breeze swept through
this stuffy house.

622
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,520
How could I object?

623
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,040
Even though the breeze
comes from the garage?

624
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,360
This is the 20th century, Sabrina.

625
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,680
Thank you. Let's drink to that.

626
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,800
Sorry it isn't David here instead
of me. But it's all in the family.

627
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,520
When you walked in,

628
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,200
I was sure you'd been sent
by the family to deal with me.

629
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,640
- To deal with you?
- Like in a Viennese operetta.

630
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,720
The young prince falls in love
with a waitress

631
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,160
and the prime minister is sent
to buy her off.

632
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,320
- Buy her off?
- Yes.

633
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,680
He offers her 5,000 kronen.
"No," she says.

634
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,000
"10,000?" "No."

635
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,080
- 15,000 kronen?
- No.

636
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,160
- 25,000 kronen?
- No.

637
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,400
- 25,000 dollars?
- No. How did dollars get into this?

638
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,640
25,000 dollars after taxes,
that's a lot of money.

639
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,120
What are you saying?

640
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,240
I'm making it worthwhile.
What's a krone these days?

641
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,400
No self-respecting prime minister
would offer kronen.

642
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,160
No self-respecting waitress
would take dollars.

643
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,440
Good girl.

644
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,840
Say, how does this operetta end?
What's the last act?

645
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,320
I don't know. I guess they run away
to America on a zeppelin

646
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,680
with everybody singing like mad.

647
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,520
- They open a brewery in Milwaukee?
- Yes.

648
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,440
- A love that made Milwaukee famous.
- Prosit.

649
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,720
There it is.

650
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,320
The song they were playing
the night before I went away.

651
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,120
David was right here,
dancing it with somebody else.

652
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,480
Tonight, I wanted it to be me.

653
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,080
It's all in the family.

654
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,480
How can we make sure that
all the fragments have been removed?

655
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,920
Simple. We will reconstruct
the two champagne glasses.

656
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,440
I cannot possibly be hurting you.
The area has been anaesthetised.

657
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,840
It's not you. It's that song.

658
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,520
Sabrina?

659
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,520
If David were here now, you'd expect
him to kiss you, wouldn't you?

660
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,480
Here's a kiss from David.

661
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,560
It's all in the family.

662
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,920
- Come in.
- Hi.

663
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,600
How do you feel?

664
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,080
I never felt better in my life.

665
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,800
You look fine.
Has the anaesthetic worn off?

666
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,920
I guess it has.
I brought you a present.

667
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,720
What happened last night? Was Sabrina
mad because I didn't show up?

668
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,640
Not mad, just disappointed.

669
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,640
- Poor kid. What did you tell her?
- The truth.

670
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,160
That the family objected to her,
but you stood up like a man,

671
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,240
and sat down like a jerk.

672
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,960
23 stitches.

673
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,520
This ought to make you feel better.

674
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,840
A plastic hammock?

675
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,960
With a trap door. I designed it
and ran it off this morning.

676
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,040
On Sunday?

677
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,640
Why not? You were in pain,
so I had 'em open up the plant.

678
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,840
What a brother!

679
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,160
Let's try it on for size.
Come on. On your feet.

680
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,720
I'll never drink champagne again.

681
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,080
- What do you think of Sabrina?
- Wonderful girl.

682
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,880
- Were you nice to her?
- As nice as I could be.

683
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
What a brother. I'm still trying
to finish my poem to her.

684
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,120
What rhymes with glass?

685
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,200
Glass...

686
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,720
- Alas.
- Of course.

687
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,920
- Right on the nose.
- Linus!

688
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,800
Sorry, David.

689
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,280
If Sabrina were only here.

690
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,280
Hey, how about smuggling her up here?

691
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,320
What if Father sees her?

692
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,920
Yeah, we wouldn't want to spoil it.

693
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,320
- No, we sure wouldn't.
- Linus, do me a favour.

694
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,400
Any time.

695
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,760
It's a bore for you,
but could you keep an eye on Sabrina?

696
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,640
I already am. We're going sailing
this afternoon.

697
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,040
- Sailing?
- In your boat.

698
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:38,320
Honest? Oh, Sabrina... Tell her
we'll be off, just the two of us,

699
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,400
the moment the stitches are out.

700
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,320
- You've already made up your mind?
- Absolutely. This is it.

701
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,640
I wanted to make sure.
It's been it three times before.

702
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,800
I was blind. It's been Sabrina
since we were kids.

703
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,320
I just couldn't see it.

704
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,640
What about Elizabeth,
Father and Mother?

705
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,320
Elizabeth will be so broken up
she'll buy three new hats.

706
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,920
Mother will go to bed
with a severe headache.

707
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,760
Father will take to the bottle

708
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,560
then threaten to exile me
to Larrabee Copper in Butte, Montana.

709
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,640
- That's where you come in.
- How?

710
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,440
I don't want to go to Montana.
You are going to help me?

711
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:20,280
Oh, yes, I'm going to help you,
aren't l...?

712
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,560
What a brother...

713
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,800
How's my poor darling?

714
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,400
I brought you six books and Scrabble.

715
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,560
I'm in no condition to play
Scrabble!

716
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,880
That's all you are
in a condition to do.

717
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,400
Why were those glasses
in your pocket?

718
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,960
I was taking them to the tennis
court. Somebody was waiting.

719
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,920
Er, there was a game going on.

720
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,960
In the middle of the night?

721
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,120
That's why he needed the glasses.

722
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,520
Yes, that's why I needed the glasses.

723
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,120
- Shall we play three-handed?
- No, I've got to go sailing.

724
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,080
- Yes, he's got to go sailing.
- No more false moves now.

725
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,680
- Yes, Linus.
- We don't want any complications.

726
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,760
So long, Elizabeth.
So long, Scarface.

727
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,960
- Good afternoon, Father.
- I thought it was your mother.

728
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,240
I don't mind your smoking in my room,
but not in my closet.

729
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,840
It's good for the moths.
Now, that girl over the garage...

730
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,280
- David wants to run off with her.
- With the chauffeur's daughter?

731
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,960
I don't care who he runs off with so
long as it's not the plastics merger.

732
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:00,280
- It's simple. We'll fire Fairchild.
- Not after 25 years.

733
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,320
Then a nice cheque
will make her forget David.

734
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,200
She doesn't want money,
she wants love.

735
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,360
Didn't they discontinue that model?

736
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,480
The last of the romantics.
L'amour, toujours l'amour.

737
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,040
Why pick on David?
Why not someone else?

738
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,720
We will do our best.

739
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,120
Is that the idea?
Have you got someone in mind for her?

740
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,680
- Yep.
- Who?

741
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,840
- Oh, no!
- What's the matter?

742
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,920
- Not you, Linus?
- It's no fun for me.

743
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,640
I've got a whole desk full of work.
There's the sulphur deal.

744
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,120
The Puerto Rican operation
has to be set in motion.

745
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,880
And I'm about to make
an ass of myself with a girl of 22.

746
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,360
Look at me! Joe College,
with a touch of arthritis.

747
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,800
Could you use this,
sailing into the sunset?

748
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,520
- I wish I were dead.
- Just a thought.

749
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:06,120
Music might help. I had a portable
phonograph in my freshman days.

750
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,920
I only hope you remember
what to do with a girl.

751
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,400
It'll come back to me.
It's like riding a bicycle.

752
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,560
This is a very unusual song.
Is it popular?

753
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,720
- Yes.
- Why haven't I heard it?

754
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,160
You've been in Paris for two years.

755
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,400
- How did they think of those words?
- They are clever, aren't they?

756
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,360
- May I play another?
- Of course.

757
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,400
- You need dusting.
- I beg your pardon?

758
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,760
- I didn't mean you, Linus!
- Thank you.

759
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,720
- How's David?
- Better, now he's flat on his back.

760
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,480
I miss him.
Not that I'm not having a good time.

761
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:17,560
Sabrina, would you mind if we...
turned this off?

762
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,720
- Why?
- Because.

763
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,840
- Don't you like it?
- I used to like it.

764
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,200
Certain songs
bring back memories to me, too.

765
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,960
Did you love her?

766
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,440
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- I'm sorry.

767
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,840
That's alright.

768
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,000
So strange to think of you
being touched by a woman.

769
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,520
I always thought you walked alone.

770
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,160
No man walks alone from choice.

771
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,240
As a child, I used to watch you
from the window over the garage.

772
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,560
Coming and going,
always wearing your black homburg,

773
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,800
carrying a briefcase and an umbrella.

774
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,200
I thought you could never belong
to anyone, never care for anyone.

775
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:13,200
Oh, yes, the cold businessman,
way up in his executive suite.

776
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,560
Just ice water in his veins,
ticker tape coming from his heart.

777
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,920
And yet one day,
that same cold businessman,

778
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,880
high up in a skyscraper,

779
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,360
opens the window,
steps out on a ledge,

780
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:32,760
stands there for three hours,
wondering... if he should jump.

781
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,240
- Because of her?
- No, that was another woman.

782
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,240
Sabrina, do you find it
hard to believe

783
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,920
someone might want to blot out
everything, for sentimental reasons?

784
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,520
I believe it! It was
for sentimental reasons that l...

785
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,240
I went to Paris to blot it out.

786
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,360
Maybe you should go to Paris.

787
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,360
It helped me.
Have you ever been there?

788
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,280
Oh, yes. Once.
I was there for 35 minutes.

789
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,520
35 minutes?

790
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,280
Changing planes
on my way to Iraq on an oil deal.

791
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:09,480
But Paris isn't for changing planes.
It's for changing your outlook.

792
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,520
For throwing open the windows
and letting in...

793
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,680
letting in
la vie en rose.

794
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:21,280
Paris is for lovers. Maybe
that's why I stayed only 35 minutes.

795
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,960
Hi, David. Hello, Father.

796
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,000
Margaret has some dinner for you
in the kitchen.

797
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,440
Funny. I used to be so afraid of him.

798
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,200
Aren't you hungry?

799
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,440
Father, you've driven Linus
for so many years.

800
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,920
What do you know about him?

801
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,640
A chauffeur
keeps his eyes on the road.

802
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,320
Only once in a while does he glimpse
in the rear-view mirror.

803
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:31,720
If you looked a little longer,
Father, you'd find him nice.

804
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,520
And quite human.

805
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,480
Good morning, Miss McCardle. First,
a wire to Hannegang, Fort Worth.

806
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,040
Unable to attend Larrabee Sulphur
board meeting.

807
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,840
Slight hitch plastics merger.
Got that?

808
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,800
Next. Here's the itinerary
for tonight.

809
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,840
I want two tickets to
The Seven Yearltch.

810
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,600
Table for two at The Colony
before the show,

811
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:18,000
table for two at The Persian Room
after the show. A corner table, dark.

812
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,400
I'm just passing La Guardia field.
Put the coffee on in ten minutes.

813
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,320
- Fairchild, I need you tonight.
- Yes, sir.

814
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,440
- I'm taking Sabrina out again.
- Yes, sir.

815
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,560
Would you have her at my office
at seven?

816
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,640
Yes, sir.

817
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,560
Anything wrong, Fairchild?

818
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:42,280
I would prefer not to be involved
in these dates with my daughter.

819
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,080
It makes for
a rather awkward situation.

820
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:49,320
- That never occurred to me. Sorry.
- It's just not right, sir.

821
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,000
I like to think of life
as a limousine.

822
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:56,600
We're all driving together, but
there's a front seat, a back seat

823
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,320
and a window in between.

824
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,120
Fairchild, I never realised it,
but you're a terrible snob.

825
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,320
Yes, sir.

826
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:08,080
Alright, have her drive
in herself, in David's car.

827
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,040
Thank you, sir.
It's all so distressing.

828
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,680
First Mr. David, now you. I wish
Sabrina had stayed in Paris.

829
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,200
So do l.

830
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,440
May I ask, sir,
what exactly are your intentions?

831
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:25,360
My intentions? Unethical,
reprehensible but very practical.

832
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,440
I beg your pardon?

833
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,920
With your permission, I'm shipping
your daughter back to Paris.

834
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,560
- You are, sir?
- I'm going to try to.

835
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,240
May I ask how, sir?

836
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,000
First class, of course.
Don't worry about money.

837
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,440
It's not money I'm worried about.
It's Sabrina.

838
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,280
- I don't want her to get hurt.
- I'll be as gentle as I can.

839
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,000
I hope so.
She's just a displaced person.

840
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,160
She doesn't belong in a mansion

841
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,120
but then she doesn't belong
above a garage either.

842
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,120
Alright!

843
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,960
The meeting of the board of directors
will now come to order.

844
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,160
As chairman, I would like to say
at the outset...

845
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,560
The chairman is so dizzy.

846
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,760
Meeting adjourned.
Have a frozen daiquiri.

847
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:26,600
I once saw an office like this in
Fortune magazine at my dentist's.

848
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,680
Has David got an office like this?

849
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,400
- Something like this, only larger.
- Larger?

850
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,960
Instead of a desk,
he has a putting green.

851
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,040
Please,
before my fingers get frostbitten.

852
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,720
- Is this the ledge?
- What ledge?

853
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:51,600
You know, the ledge. That woman.
When you almost...

854
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:59,720
Oh, the ledge.
Yes, that's the ledge alright.

855
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,160
What made you not do it?

856
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:05,280
There were some children playing
hopscotch on the sidewalk.

857
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,880
I'm very fond of those children.

858
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,360
Look at all these gadgets. You press
a button and factories go up.

859
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:18,040
Or you pick up a telephone
and 100 tankers set out for Persia.

860
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,880
Or through a Dictaphone you say,

861
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,320
"Buy all of Cleveland
and move it to Pittsburgh."

862
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,640
You must be clever.

863
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,440
It's just a knack,
like juggling three oranges.

864
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,200
It isn't oranges, it's millions.
Suppose you dropped one?

865
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,480
Suppose I did? What's at the end
of a million? Nothing. A circle.

866
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,560
- Sabrina...
- Yes, Linus?

867
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,440
Can you keep a secret?
Yes, of course you can.

868
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,640
I want you to look out there. Uptown.

869
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,160
- You see the French Line pier?
- Yes.

870
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,680
- You see the boat?
- Yes.

871
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:02,720
That's the Liberte. It sails on
Thursday. I'm going to be on it.

872
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,800
- You are?
- Yes, I am.

873
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,840
I'm sick of pushing buttons in this
office. I'm breaking out, Sabrina.

874
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,120
- I'm running away.
- Good for you!

875
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,600
I've been thinking about Paris
ever since you mentioned it.

876
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,920
It'll make a new person out of you.
You'll double your money back.

877
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,680
I'm so glad you're going.

878
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,600
Or am l?

879
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,920
It's 7:35, Mr. Larrabee. You have
a reservation at The Colony.

880
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,000
Thank you.

881
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,840
Ready, Sabrina?

882
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,920
Tout de suite,
as they say in Paris.

883
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,720
Curtain is at 8:40. I used your
brother's name at The Colony

884
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,920
to get the darkest corner!

885
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Larrabee.

886
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,920
This is what you do
on your very first day in Paris.

887
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:10,080
You get yourself, not a drizzle,
but some honest-to-goodness rain,

888
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,000
and you find yourself
someone really nice

889
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,600
and drive her through
the Bois de Boulogne in a taxi.

890
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,120
The rain's very important.

891
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:22,000
That's when Paris smells
its sweetest.

892
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,480
- It's the damp chestnut trees.
- I see.

893
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,200
You're very clever, Linus,
and very rich.

894
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,480
You can order yourself some rain.

895
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,920
Sure. I can order myself some rain,
I can get myself a taxi.

896
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,760
That's easy.

897
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,600
But can I find myself
someone really nice?

898
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,680
That's not so easy, Sabrina.

899
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:16,360
How do you say in French,
my sister has a yellow pencil?

900
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,120
Ma soeura un crayonjaune.

901
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,920
How do you say,
my brother has a lovely girl?

902
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,240
Mon frere a une gentille petite amie.

903
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,720
And how do you say,
I wish I were my brother?

904
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,680
Why are you looking at me that way?

905
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,080
All night I've had a terrible impulse
to do something.

906
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:16,360
Never resist an impulse, Sabrina,
especially if it's terrible.

907
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,440
I'm going to do it.

908
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,120
- There.
- What's that for?

909
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,720
You can't go walking up
the Champs Elysees

910
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,000
looking like a tourist undertaker!

911
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,720
And another thing,
never a briefcase in Paris

912
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,960
and never an umbrella. There's a law.

913
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,200
How will I get along in Paris
without someone like you?

914
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,600
Who'll be there
to help me with my French,

915
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,080
to turn down the brim of my hat?

916
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:46,640
Suppose you meet someone on the boat,
the first day? A perfect stranger.

917
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,560
I have a better suppose, Sabrina.

918
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:55,840
Suppose I were ten years younger
and you weren't in love with David.

919
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,840
Suppose I asked you to...

920
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,240
I suppose I'm just talking nonsense.

921
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,640
I suppose so.

922
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,080
Suppose you sing that song again.
Slowly.

923
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:07,520
Hi! I thought you two had eloped.
I wouldn't mind, but not in my car.

924
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,240
- Hello, David.
- Did you have a good time?

925
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,800
- So-so.
- Where did you go?

926
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,600
We saw The Seven Year Itch
and went on to The Persian Room.

927
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,320
- Lousy dancer, isn't he?
- So-so.

928
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,320
I bet he slept through the show
then bent your ears

929
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,480
about Dow Jones averages
and profits taxes.

930
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,560
We talked about a lot of things.

931
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,240
How's your little, er, mishap?

932
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:32,760
Shaping up beautifully. Dr Calaway
wants to show it to his class.

933
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,200
- I'm sorry, Sabrina.
- It's very funny.

934
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:40,160
Say, Linus, while I was lying
in that hammock I got a great idea.

935
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:43,160
He thinks I'm an idiot.
How does this strike you?

936
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,360
Plastic champagne glasses,
just in case.

937
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,560
Brilliant.
What else did Dr Calaway say?

938
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,240
- Stitches come out Thursday.
- Thursday?

939
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,360
- I'm a fast healer.
- You sure are.

940
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,360
So if you two
have long-range plans...

941
01:19:55,480 --> 01:20:00,800
I thought she'd like to see the
Stock Exchange and our Jersey plant.

942
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,600
Oh, I don't think so.

943
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,160
Then we'll just have dinner
and go to a show.

944
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,640
But that's all. Come Thursday,
the first team takes over.

945
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,440
What's with the homburg?

946
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,760
I guess the undertaker
had better turn in.

947
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,760
You'd better crawl back
into that hole in your hammock.

948
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:25,000
- Au revoir, Sabrina.
- Good night, Linus.

949
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
He's a little on the dull side,
but you can't help liking him.

950
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,640
- Kiss me, David.
- I'd love to, Sabrina.

951
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,760
Again.

952
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,200
That's better.

953
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,000
What's the matter?
You're not worried about us? I'm not.

954
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,200
There'll be a big stink. Who cares?

955
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:04,040
David, I don't think
I'm going to have dinner with Linus.

956
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,720
- I don't want to go out with him.
- Why not?

957
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,160
I want to be near you.

958
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,920
I know how you feel.
It must be an awful bore.

959
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,840
But if Linus wants to take you out,
be nice about it.

960
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,200
It's important. He's our only ally.

961
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,600
Father will try
to cut off my allowance

962
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,240
and send me to Larrabee Copper
in Butte, Montana.

963
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,040
We don't want to go
to Butte, Montana, do we?

964
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,120
Hold me close, David.

965
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,240
We'll have a wonderful time, darling.

966
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:34,560
We'll build a raft and drift
across the Pacific like Kon-Tiki.

967
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,640
Or climb the highest mountain,
like Annapurna,

968
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,360
just the two of us.

969
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,520
Keep talking, David.

970
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,240
We thought pink roses for the cherubs
and white gardenias for the names.

971
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,880
It'll take 2,000 gardenias.
We'll float it in our pool.

972
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,040
- Indoor or outdoor?
- Outdoor.

973
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,760
We drained the indoor
to make room for presents.

974
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,640
Where's the provision determining

975
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,640
the ratio of investment
to controlling interest?

976
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,480
Page 62, paragraph six,
subdivision B.

977
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,560
- Father, where's the list?
- Here you are, darling.

978
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,080
Would you like to see
the invitation list?

979
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,360
-.740 under trust of Illinois, 550...

980
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,720
The way this merger's worked out,

981
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,800
I have all the titles
and you have all the controls.

982
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,280
I always make it a point
to have controls.

983
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,240
It's your good luck
the kids are fond of each other.

984
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,240
I make it a point to be lucky, too.

985
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,000
Come along, Father. Linus,
you won't forget the gardenias?

986
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,480
Tony has a sweet idea.

987
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,640
He'll fly over the chapel
and throw rice from his plane.

988
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,680
With David the bridegroom,
maybe he'd better use wild rice.

989
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,000
All I can say is
David better show up at this wedding.

990
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,920
I have a horrible vision
of Elizabeth waiting at the altar,

991
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,960
and 2,000 gardenias floating
in the pool spelling "disaster".

992
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:55,240
Memo to Miss McCardle. First,
call Brunson in Larrabee Shipping.

993
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,960
We need 2,000 gardenias.

994
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,720
Tell him to start
cornering the market.

995
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,800
We're not having trouble with...

996
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,080
I can't remember
that garage girl's name.

997
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,240
Sabrina.

998
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,000
What right has a chauffeur got
to call her that?

999
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,800
What would you suggest? Ethel?

1000
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,640
You've taken her out three nights in
a row. Is that situation in hand?

1001
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,320
I think so. It's resolving itself
into a straight export deal.

1002
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:20,000
I want two accommodations
on the Liberte.

1003
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,520
One in the name of Sabrina Fairchild.
One in my name.

1004
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,680
What? You and that girl
going off on a boat together?

1005
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,280
Have I spawned two idiot sons?

1006
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,480
Who said I was going? She is going.
She'll think I am, but I'm not.

1007
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,760
- Is that clear?
- It is not!

1008
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,520
I'll tell Sabrina
that I'll meet her on the boat.

1009
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,400
When the boat is ten miles out,
she'll find out I'm not on the boat.

1010
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,920
My cabin will be empty.
Just a note of apology

1011
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,120
and a few presents
to soften the blow.

1012
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:50,040
- Excellent.
- Yes, I thought you'd like it.

1013
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,760
Miss McCardle, I want flowers
in Miss Fairchild's cabin.

1014
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,360
Candy, fruit
and the usual what-have-yous.

1015
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:00,120
Cable Michot to get her
a car in Paris. Also an apartment.

1016
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,640
A letter of credit on our Paris bank.

1017
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,120
- She can draw up to 50,000.
- Easy, now.

1018
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:09,560
Transfer to Thomas Fairchild
1,000 shares, Larrabee Common.

1019
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,200
1,000 shares?

1020
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,920
Make it 1,500 shares,
Larrabee Preferred.

1021
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,120
There must be a less extravagant way

1022
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,160
of getting a chauffeur's daughter
out of one's hair.

1023
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,880
How would you do it? You can't even
get a little olive out of a jar.

1024
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,680
Eat it.

1025
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,600
Going up?

1026
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,160
No, thank you.

1027
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,080
- Yes?
- Miss Fairchild for you.

1028
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,480
- Send her in.
- She's on the phone. It's on five.

1029
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,960
Sabrina? What happened to you?
It's twenty past eight.

1030
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,600
Good evening, Linus. I know I'm late.

1031
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,440
I guess I should have
called you earlier.

1032
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,160
I can't see you tonight.

1033
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,800
I'm sorry. I just can't make it.
I tried but I'm all tied up.

1034
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,840
No, I'm not in Long Island.
I'm in New York.

1035
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,440
Downtown in a phone booth.
In a building.

1036
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,480
What difference does it make
what building?

1037
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,360
I can't see you tonight.

1038
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:12,960
Alright, it's the Larrabee Building,
but I'm not coming up.

1039
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,000
Look, Sabrina, suppose you tell me

1040
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,480
exactly what's on your mind,
slowly and clearly?

1041
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,600
You talk and I'll listen.

1042
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,680
It was really David's idea
I go out with you.

1043
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,840
He wants you to help him.

1044
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,160
But it's not helping me.
I shouldn't have been seeing you.

1045
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,520
I shouldn't be talking to you
on the phone.

1046
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,840
In fact, I'm really only calling
to say goodbye.

1047
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,840
Tomorrow,
you'll be on the boat to Paris.

1048
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,760
In a way, I'm glad you're going.

1049
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,240
You do know what I mean,
don't you?

1050
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,960
Linus? Hello, Linus?

1051
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,400
Where are you?

1052
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,480
- Your three minutes are up.
- Hello.

1053
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,680
It's silly. I was talking to myself.

1054
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,160
You've wasted a dime, too. Come on.

1055
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,920
You're not angry? I have a perfectly
good reason why I shouldn't see you.

1056
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,000
Not here, Sabrina.

1057
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,760
Alright, Sabrina,

1058
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,160
what is that perfectly good reason
why you shouldn't see me?

1059
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,200
What is it? What's bothering you?

1060
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,680
It's me that's bothering me.

1061
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,800
Please don't.

1062
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,800
I'm sorry.

1063
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,280
I know I'm not making much sense,
Linus.

1064
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:06,240
- Would you like a drink?
- I don't think I want a drink.

1065
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,720
I think I do.

1066
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:16,160
- Why don't you sit down?
- I can only stay a minute.

1067
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,280
- Mind if I turn on this little one?
- If you want.

1068
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,800
I'd hate to fix myself a martini
with creme de menthe.

1069
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,360
Yes?

1070
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:37,120
I cancelled your dinner reservation.
What about the theatre tickets?

1071
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,520
I couldn't possibly go anywhere.

1072
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,920
They're all yours, Miss McCardle.
Good night.

1073
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,480
You're sure you won't have even one?

1074
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,440
- No, thanks.
- You must be hungry.

1075
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:59,040
- I hadn't thought about it.
- Well, I'm starved.

1076
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,560
I was sort of saving myself
for 21 tonight.

1077
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,680
I've spoiled your evening.

1078
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,600
No, you haven't.
We can have dinner right here.

1079
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,240
Let's see what Miss McCardle is
hoarding.

1080
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:13,920
Probably maraschino cherries
and stale crackers.

1081
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:18,040
Tomato juice, puffed rice, sardines,

1082
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,120
tomato juice.

1083
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,440
That's an awful lot
of tomato juice.

1084
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,600
Could you fix something
out of this?

1085
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,280
I suppose so. I'm a graduate cook.
I have a diploma.

1086
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,360
It'll take a diploma.

1087
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,280
I wanted to be so sure
I couldn't go out with you tonight.

1088
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,080
And here I am cooking for you.

1089
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,880
I guess
maybe I should have worn an apron.

1090
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,120
One apron, coming up.

1091
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,440
Pots. Pans. Can opener. Stove.

1092
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,920
All the comforts of home.

1093
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,480
Miss McCardle cooked dinner here
for the board of directors.

1094
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,320
After the first course,
there was a move to adjourn.

1095
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,800
It was passed unanimously.

1096
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,040
What do we start with?

1097
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,680
I haven't decided yet.

1098
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,320
Now, Sabrina,
let's have none of those.

1099
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:34,120
- I'm so ashamed, Linus.
- You have no reason to be.

1100
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:39,080
I've known you
just a few days, really.

1101
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,280
And I've been in love with David
all my life.

1102
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,720
I can't understand
what's the matter with me.

1103
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,240
I went away to grow up
and I thought I had grown up.

1104
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,520
I guess I haven't, really.

1105
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:56,760
I just got myself a new hairdo,
that's all.

1106
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,880
- Please say something.
- Like what?

1107
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,160
I don't know.
Tell me I'm imagining things.

1108
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:12,760
Tell me you never thought of taking
me on the boat to Paris with you.

1109
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,960
Tell me to put on my coat
and go home

1110
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,520
before I make a complete fool
of myself.

1111
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,480
Don't let me go home.
I couldn't bear it.

1112
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,280
This is the last time
we'll see each other.

1113
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:35,000
- I'll behave. I'm alright now.
- That's good. How about dinner?

1114
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:39,680
I just remembered I didn't have
any lunch today. Or any breakfast.

1115
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,280
That may account for a lot of things.

1116
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,160
Would you like a souffle for dessert?

1117
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,800
Out of tomato juice?

1118
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:50,720
- Out of crackers, of course.
- Not too soggy.

1119
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,320
You'd better get out of the kitchen.

1120
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,520
Which one is the Liberte?

1121
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,680
- The one on the right.
- Are you sure?

1122
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:29,000
- You mustn't take the wrong boat.
- I'll try not to.

1123
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,560
You haven't forgotten
my instructions, have you?

1124
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,720
Never an umbrella in Paris,

1125
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,160
and under all circumstances
rain the very first day.

1126
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,840
I haven't forgotten a word, Sabrina.

1127
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,000
My sister has a yellow pencil.

1128
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,920
Ma soeura un crayonjaune.

1129
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,000
Very good. Tres bien.

1130
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,280
Watch. One, two, three, crack.

1131
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,200
New egg. It's all in the wrist.

1132
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,680
There must be an egg beater
somewhere.

1133
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,480
Linus!

1134
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:48,120
Why didn't you tell me? You do want
to take me with you, don't you?

1135
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,520
These don't mean
what you think they mean.

1136
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,560
I know why you didn't tell me.
You think it's wrong.

1137
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,320
They'll say I'm too young,
there'll be a scandal,

1138
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,360
and the market will go down.

1139
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:08,480
Linus Larrabee Esquire
is taking me to Paris.

1140
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:15,160
Sabrina, l... wasn't going
to take you to Paris.

1141
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:17,640
I was going to send you.

1142
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,760
- Alone?
- Yes, all alone.

1143
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,240
But there's a ticket for you.

1144
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,320
For an empty cabin.

1145
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:35,400
- You were joining me in Paris?
- I'm afraid not.

1146
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,600
- I think I understand.
- I'm sorry.

1147
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,800
But why? Why did you do it, Linus?

1148
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,120
High finance. Expansion.
Marriage. A merger.

1149
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:57,800
A new plaque on the Larrabee
Building. You got in the way.

1150
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,520
- David?
- That's right.

1151
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,440
How inconsiderate of me.

1152
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,200
And how inconvenient for you,

1153
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:13,200
such a busy man, having to waste
so much time to get me on a boat.

1154
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,880
I'm ashamed to say
I enjoyed every minute of it.

1155
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,000
And I suppose, in your empty cabin,

1156
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,400
there would have been
a farewell note,

1157
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,000
dictated to and typed by
Miss McCardle?

1158
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,680
- And perhaps a few flowers.
- A little more than that.

1159
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,760
A letter of credit.
An apartment in Paris. A car.

1160
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,880
1,500 shares of Larrabee Preferred
for your father.

1161
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,560
You're very generous.

1162
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:54,080
We regard it
as a necessary business expense.

1163
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,800
I'll just take one of those tickets.

1164
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,960
I was happy in Paris.

1165
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,040
I think you would have been, too.

1166
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,600
Good night, Mr. Larrabee.

1167
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,840
I'm sorry I can't stay
to do the dishes.

1168
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,480
Good morning.

1169
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:06,800
- Mr. Larrabee?
- Come in, Miss McCardle.

1170
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,840
- Good morning.
- You're late.

1171
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,360
I had to make my own coffee.
Worst ever.

1172
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,720
- Sorry. I had a very bad night.
- I know exactly how you feel.

1173
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:20,160
You better get that pad.
We have things to do.

1174
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,400
I used your theatre tickets
and took my mother.

1175
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:25,160
Are you ready?
Call Larrabee Shipping.

1176
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,640
Tell them to radio our tankers
bound for Puerto Rico to turn back.

1177
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,040
Tell Larrabee Construction
to stop work on the plant.

1178
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:35,640
- We're cancelling the merger.
- We are?

1179
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,680
I want Mr. Larrabee Senior,

1180
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:41,240
Mr. Tyson and Miss Elizabeth Tyson
here in this office.

1181
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,560
Get a large bottle
of smelling salts.

1182
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,960
- We're calling off the wedding.
- We are?

1183
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:50,120
When's your mother's birthday?
I'm sending her 2,000 gardenias.

1184
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,040
Here's a ticket for the Liberte.

1185
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,320
Transfer it to the name
of David Larrabee.

1186
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,920
Get his passport out.
Make sure it's in order.

1187
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,960
Locate David. The boat sails at noon.

1188
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,480
I've called the house
and he isn't there.

1189
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:05,520
Try Dr Calaway.
Try everywhere, but get him.

1190
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:08,720
Do you want me to send those presents
to Miss Fairchild's cabin?

1191
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:12,400
- No. We're sending David instead.
- Good morning.

1192
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:17,320
The stitches are out.
It's as good as new.

1193
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,800
Congratulations.
I've been looking for you.

1194
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,600
I've been looking for you.

1195
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:24,880
- You're leaving for Paris today.
- No kidding?

1196
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,800
With Sabrina.
She's going to be on the boat.

1197
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,840
Uh.huh?
Does she have to be in here?

1198
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:35,400
Alright, Miss McCardle.
You've got a lot of work to do.

1199
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,960
Aren't you pleased?
What's the matter?

1200
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:42,160
I saw Sabrina when she came home
last night. Found her packing.

1201
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,400
What did she say?

1202
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,080
- Nothing. She just kissed me.
- What's wrong with that?

1203
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:49,480
I may know nothing about Dow Jones
but I know about kisses.

1204
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,320
You could lecture on that at Vassar.

1205
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,920
This one tasted like a goodbye kiss.

1206
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:59,240
- You're just imagining things.
- No, it had a few tears in it.

1207
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:04,240
It took me until this morning
to add two and two together,

1208
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:08,200
Like two champagne glasses
and the plastics deal and Sabrina.

1209
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,880
- You know what I got?
- What?

1210
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,760
Sorry to do it
to a tired businessman.

1211
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,760
That's alright.
Well, now we're even.

1212
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:23,840
Go home and start packing.
I'll take care of Elizabeth.

1213
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:25,400
I'm calling off the merger.

1214
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,040
Miss McCardle has your passport
and ticket.

1215
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,560
Let her know if you need money.

1216
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:34,040
I want you and Sabrina to have
a good time in Paris. Goodbye.

1217
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,760
What makes you so sure
Sabrina still wants me?

1218
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,000
She's wanted you all her life.

1219
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,320
Until you came along
in that silly homburg.

1220
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,720
Straighten that silly hat and go.
You'll miss the boat.

1221
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:48,760
Don't worry, I won't miss the boat.
I'm going.

1222
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:52,040
Funniest thing.

1223
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:55,480
Linus Larrabee, the man
who doesn't burn, scorch or melt,

1224
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,920
throws a $20.million deal
out the window.

1225
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:02,800
Are you sure
you don't want to go with her?

1226
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:04,640
Why should I want to go with her?

1227
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:06,960
You're in love with her.

1228
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:19,240
You won't be annoyed if I cry
at the boat, will you, Sabrina?

1229
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,960
I'll be disappointed
if you don't, Father.

1230
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,960
I'd feel better if you'd be angry
with me for allowing this to happen.

1231
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,040
It wasn't your fault, Father.
It was mine.

1232
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,560
I should have believed you.

1233
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:36,160
There's a front seat
and a back seat

1234
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,360
and a window in between.

1235
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:43,040
If it's any consolation,
one good thing's come out of it.

1236
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,720
You did get over David, didn't you?

1237
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:50,760
Dear David.
Yes, I did get over that. I'm cured.

1238
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,280
Now, how to get over the cure!

1239
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,280
It wouldn't have worked out really.

1240
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,200
The papers would have said
how fine and democratic

1241
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:04,120
for a Larrabee
to marry the chauffeur's daughter.

1242
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,360
But would they praise
the chauffeur's daughter? No.

1243
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:11,480
Democracy can be
a wickedly unfair thing.

1244
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:14,720
Nobody poor
was ever called democratic

1245
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,800
for marrying somebody rich.

1246
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,720
Why don't we start this meeting
and sign the papers?

1247
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,920
We're waiting for David, of course.

1248
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,680
That boy has no sense of time,
of direction.

1249
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:50,920
As a matter of fact,
he has no sense. Where is he?

1250
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,000
We'll get to that in a minute.

1251
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:57,440
Here are the smelling salts.
I got you the largest size.

1252
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:04,120
Look what I bought him
for Waikiki Beach.

1253
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:05,920
I hope they're loud enough.

1254
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,200
I hope they're returnable.

1255
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,800
I see no need for any further delay.
Suppose we get down to business?

1256
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,840
What about David?

1257
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:26,400
That's a very good question. Not yet.

1258
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:31,680
Mr. Tyson, members of the board...
Are you with us, Father?

1259
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,000
Present.

1260
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:40,000
We are here to put our signatures
to the Larrabee-Tyson merger.

1261
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:43,280
Much effort has gone into making
this union possible.

1262
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:46,840
Long hours.
Many obstacles to overcome.

1263
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,280
Nobody knows better than l.

1264
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,560
However... Not yet.

1265
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:56,320
However, sometimes even the most
conscientious of businessmen

1266
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:59,680
can botch up a deal
for one reason or another.

1267
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:04,440
Understand, I don't mean to say
that our merger has hit a snag,

1268
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,160
or failed to gel,

1269
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:09,600
or gone up in smoke,
or fallen through.

1270
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:13,600
Let me put it this way, gentlemen.
It has sailed away.

1271
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:21,280
I seem to have missed something.
Would you mind starting again?

1272
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:25,240
Now, Miss McCardle.
Elizabeth, I hate to break the news,

1273
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,560
but at this very moment,
your fiance, David Larrabee...

1274
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,640
Is late, as usual.

1275
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:38,680
Hello, everybody. Hello, darling.
Hello, Linus. How are you?

1276
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,720
What are you doing here?

1277
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:44,720
I heard there was a board meeting.
Where are the contracts?

1278
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:48,000
- Where's Sabrina?
- Sabrina? Who's Sabrina?

1279
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,920
- That name!
- She's on the boat, I guess.

1280
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,520
But the boat has sailed.

1281
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,400
- And there she goes.
- Who goes?

1282
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,560
- Sabrina.
- Who is Sabrina?

1283
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,320
- Why did you do it?
- Do what?

1284
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:02,200
She's all alone out there.

1285
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,840
Not according
to the afternoon papers.

1286
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,520
It says here that Linus Larrabee,
that's you,

1287
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,680
and Sabrina Fairchild, that's she,

1288
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,440
have reserved adjacent deck chairs
on the Liberte, sailing today.

1289
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:17,200
All columnists should be beaten
to a pulp and converted into paper.

1290
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,760
Did you plant this?

1291
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,480
Me? I thought it was common knowledge
about you and Sabrina.

1292
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,280
Who is Sabrina?

1293
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,200
Our chauffeur's daughter,
that's who. How about that?

1294
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:33,440
Linus Larrabee, wizard of finance,
chairman of the board,

1295
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:36,320
getting mixed up
with his chauffeur's daughter.

1296
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:37,880
That's enough, David.

1297
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,800
She went after me,
but she switched to Linus.

1298
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:43,520
I guess it's because
he's got more money.

1299
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,440
We know about those kind of girls.

1300
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:49,000
Believe me, this one is no different,
just seems to be.

1301
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,760
I said that's enough.

1302
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,920
Maybe you got smart.
Or maybe you just got lucky,

1303
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:57,320
because you're here
and she's out there.

1304
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,760
She would have taken you for plenty.

1305
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:07,160
I was just helping you
make up your mind.

1306
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:09,240
You are in love with her!

1307
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:14,040
What are you waiting for?

1308
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:19,040
There's an elevator outside,
a police escort downstairs

1309
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,840
and a tugboat standing by.

1310
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,360
Get moving!

1311
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:29,280
If you'll excuse me, it appears
I have a previous engagement.

1312
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:33,280
That's the 20th century for you.
Automobiles. Garages.

1313
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,920
Chauffeurs. Chauffeurs' daughters!

1314
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:43,320
Inasmuch as I seem to be the only
member of the Larrabee family

1315
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,000
who is not out of his mind,

1316
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:48,800
I will take it upon myself
