they had a tabby cat.

738

and took him everywhere.

He was their pride and joy.

But he was
stubborn and tough,

744

and he didn't really like
to be held.

745
00:33:52,024 --> 00:33:53,858

when Haley was born,

746

747

to grandma.

748

And grandma was like,
"she keeps fighting me.

749

just like Bob."

750

Haley Bob.
