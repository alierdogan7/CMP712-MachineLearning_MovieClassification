Well, nothing. What do you mean?

510
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,846
I haven't seen you since before college.

511
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,570
Oh. You seem like you're kind of down, kid.

512
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,608
No, I'm totally good.

513
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,161
Um...

514
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,924
This isn't our mail.

515
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,970
Okay, well, we'll catch you tomorrow.

516
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,161
What?

517
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,441
(ENGINE STARTING)

518
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,600
GEENIE: I know it's a
frustrating situation.

519
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,921
Yeah, I understand.

520
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,447
Uh-huh.

521
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,090
Why don't you tell them to tell...

522
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,366
MAURY: Unbelievable.

523
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,089
She's building something.

524
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,802
You know,
we really should let Beth know she died.

525
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,566
- No. No.
- Well, I've opened up to her, you know?

526
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,123
Yeah, but no, we're not gonna do that.
That'll just confuse her and make her upset.

527
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,123
- That's not happening.
- GEENIE: Honey?

528
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,361
What should I tell them?

529
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,011
Tell them I'll come back
when I'm ready to come back.

530
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,242
They have to stop calling
every five minutes.

531
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
- Look, she came back, right?
- Right.

532
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,522
- And that is for a reason.
- Well...

533
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,922
Also I think Pearline might have
something to do with this.

534
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,530
- 'Cause she...
- No. Yeah, no.

535
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,967
She disappeared
right before Beth appeared.

536
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,166
- And she's Haitian.
- No.

537
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,242
- Just think about it like this...
- Zachy. Zachy.

538
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,846
You're going down a rabbit hole.
This doesn't make any sense.

539
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,651
And I need you to tell me
that you won't tell her.

540
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,127
Look, I understand how scared you are.

541
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,044
Listen, she's my daughter.
I make the rules.

542
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,521
And if you want to be in my house,

543
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,206
you will promise me
that you are not gonna tell her.

544
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,920
Okay.

545
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,125
I promise.

546
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,763
MAURY: There she is!
ZACH: Hey.

547
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,964
Beth, oh, I missed you so much.

548
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,849
I missed you more.

549
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,121
(BOTH MOANING)

550
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,441
All right, that's enough of that!

551
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,931
Zach and I are going on a hike.

552
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,288
What? Uh-uh. No. No way!

553
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,523
I think that is important that we do this.

554
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,284
No. Beth? Bethy?

555
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Bethy?

556
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,405
You are not to leave this house.

557
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,528
- Not in the daylight.
- BETH: Not in the daylight?

558
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,246
- Why are you acting like I'm a child?
- Yeah, tell her, Maury.

559
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,324
"Maury"? Since when did you
start calling my dad Maury? Ew!

560
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,044
Zach, this really isn't a good idea.

561
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,565
- No, it's fine.
- Zach.

562
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,130
It's really...

563
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,646
Zach, please don't do this.

564
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,724
Maury, it's cool. Trust me.

565
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,084
Okay!

566
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,322
Well, have fun.
When can I expect you back?

567
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,765
Dad, stop!

568
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,011
Bye, Maury.

569
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,921
(BOTH PANTING)

570
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,921
It's crazy, you know?
Like it all makes sense.

571
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,131
It's like there's no inside without outside
or light without dark.

572
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,770
They're the same.

573
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,522
I mean, I want to say that I understand it,

574
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,207
- but it's like I don't which means I do.
- Huh.

575
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,044
You're so expressive now. It's cute.

576
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,206
Ah. Her face has a huge blister.

577
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,645
It's not a blister. It's sunburn.

578
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,609
I just got a little color. That's all.

579
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,761
It's charred.

580
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,729
- Look at it.
- Looks cute. (GRUNTS)

581
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,525
Okay, Zach. Zach! You're acting manic.

582
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,931
It doesn't hurt. I'm fine.

583
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,001
Okay, no more.

584
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,889
- Honey, relax.
- You see, I told you shouldn't go,

585
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,406
and now look. Look what happens.

586
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,211
Honey, we'll just put
a little foundation on it.

587
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,487
Mom, it's just a sunburn.
It's not that big of a deal.

588
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,601
That's right.

589
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,081
Maybe you should put some aloe on it
or something and a Band-Aid.

590
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,322
Aloe? You think aloe's gonna do anything?

591
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,090
- No more outings.
- ZACH: Whoa, whoa! Maury?

592
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,731
Don't you go over my head, Zach.
That's final!

593
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,404
Or we can use some of the aloe
from our front lawn.

594
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,130
Geenie, stop triangulating.

595
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,283
You know what? Maybe if we were just all
completely honest with one another...

596
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,089
Enough already. Will you stop?

597
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,170
No, you know what? Maury you are just
too jazzed to know what's what.

598
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,766
Okay, look, this is simple.
If we just tell her...

599
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,049
No. "Jazzed"? You want to know jazzed?
I'll tell you what, pal.

600
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,442
I know! I know! I know!

601
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,444
I have to study for my test. Jeez.

602
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,245
- Right. That's right, Beth.
- Yeah, that is a good idea.

603
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,845
You have to study for your test.

604
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,207
Yeah, I should probably go,
so she can study for her test.

605
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,329
Yeah, you better go.
'Cause Beth has to study for her test.

606
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,801
GEENIE: Yeah. We'll get some studying...

607
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,161
(BETH MOANING)

608
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,646
Okay!

609
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,927
That's enough of that now, kids, come on.

610
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,162
It's not fun. It's weird.

611
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,164
End of kiss, guys. Okay.
Let's hit those books.

612
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,481
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

613
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,843
We have to be on the same team.

614
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,002
What? I was backing you up.

615
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,327
Beth, no, you already said goodbye.

616
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,605
What the fuck are you doing?

617
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,091
I want Beth to know.

618
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,766
- You're ruining everything.
- No, I'm not ruining anything.

619
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,410
- And now you're not welcome in my home.
- I love her!

620
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,608
- I want her to be happy.
- Go. Get off my property.

621
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,728
- Wait. Maury, come on. She said she's fine.
- Go! Go!

622
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,802
- No. No more. That's it.
- Maury?

623
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,008
Maury, just come back here.

624
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,889
- That's it.
- Maury?

625
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,651
(WHISPERING) Beth?

626
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,450
- Beth?
- BETH: Zach?

627
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,006
- You scared me.
- I'm sorry.

628
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,050
But I have a surprise for you so...

629
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,121
Surprise?

630
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,123
Let's go. Are you ready?

631
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,401
Okay.

632
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,131
- Let me go tell Mom and Dad we're leaving.
- No, no, no, no, no.

633
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,089
Let's just go.

634
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,084
Just be careful, okay? Be careful.

635
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,401
- Oh!
- (THUD)

637
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,720
I'm okay.

(SQUISHING)

639
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,086
Are you ready for your surprise?

640
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,970
What do you mean "surprise"?

641
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,201
- Where were you?
- I was just getting something.

642
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,566
Why?

643
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,806
Because I am going to give you

644
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,965
a concert.

645
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,451
- No, you're not. Really?
- Yeah!

646
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,564
Where's the band? Where's Dan and Roz?

647
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,120
Yeah, it's just me. I'm solo now.

648
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,521
That is so sweet.

649
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,365
I can't believe you're doing this for me.

650
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,967
<i>(SINGING) I lost my heart</i>

651
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,289

What's going on?

655
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,127
I wrote this for you.

656
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,886
This fucking sucks. This is retarded.

657
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,686
Okay.

658
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,361
Um...

659
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,366
Then let me just skip to the chorus.

Are you messing with me?
This is fucking gay, Zach!

662
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,287
I wrote the song for you.

663
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,362
- I fucking hate this.
- Okay, well, I'm kind of

664
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,441
- sensitive right now.
- It doesn't sound good.

665
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,801
Well, if you could just listen
with your heart, that would be...

666
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,645
(GRUNTING) No, no. Stop it! Stop it!

667
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,960
- I said stop it!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

668
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,202
- Why did you do that?
- Why are you doing this to me?

669
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,731
What am I doing?
You're the one that's screaming!

670
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,801
I was just playing music.

671
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,327
You know what? You're fucking with me!
This isn't Snake 85.

672
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,562
- No, I'm solo.
- (BETH SCREAMING)

673
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,245
Beth, calm down.

674
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,644
Okay, just calm down.

675
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,007
- Okay, Beth, calm down.
- (BETH CRYING)

676
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,923
Zach, where are you? Where are you?

677
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,129
I'm right here. I'm right here, okay?
Don't hurt me.

678
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,364

01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,320
and for giving me a second chance.

1342
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,041
I, um...

1343
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,685
I'm sorry the whole world went to shit.

1344
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:09,085
But it was totally worth it,
and I'm sorry if I screwed everything up.

1345
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:13,290
No, no. No.

1346
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,361
I, uh...

1347
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,762
I'll always love you, Beth.

1348
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,845
Forever.

1349
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,004
I love you too, Zach.

1350
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,806
Good bye.

1351
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,769
Where are you going?

1352
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,048
- ZACH: Hi, Mr. Levin.
- All right, you made it. Good. Come on.

1353
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,480
You hungry? We got bagels.
They're frozen, but they're good.

1354
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,609
Uh, no, I'm fine.

1355
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,251
Mom! Dad!

1356
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,765
- JUDY: Zachery?
- Mom!

1357
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,491
Oh, my God. Zach, my baby. Oh!

1358
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,450
- NOAH: Oh, you okay?
- I missed you guys so much.

1359
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,403
- Oh, my God, are you hurt?
- There's blood all over your shirt.

1360
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,801
Yeah, it's Beth's.

1361
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,201
- Okay, so thank God you're okay.
- Yeah.

1362
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,805
I love you guys so much.

1363
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,240
Oh, honey, we're so sorry we didn't
believe you about the monsters.

1364
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,049
- We didn't know.
- I know. It's okay. It's okay.

1365
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,645
It's just really good to see you.

1366
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,085
- That's going to come off.
- My shirt's a mess.

1367
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,491
Hey, come here. Look who's here.

1368
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,081
Huh?

1369
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,450
JUDY: Zach.
ZACH: Oh.

1370
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,201
Hi.

1371
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,284
I stuck a tent pole through my Nana's head.

1372
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,045
She's a bit traumatized,
but she'll be okay.

1373
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,531
Doesn't she look good?

1374
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,810
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right?

1375
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,211
Where's Kyle?

1376
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,767
Right here. 1600. You made it.

1377
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,444
Punctual.

1378
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,851
That's good.

1379
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,211
I did what I had to do.

1380
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,650
Where's my Desert Eagle? I thought you
were gonna give my Desert Eagle back.

1381
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,291
- Oh, well, I tossed it into the ravine.
- Why?

1382
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,601
- I need my gun.
- I thought you guys had bazookas and shit.

1383
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:25,523
You're such an asshole.
That cost me a lot of money.

1384
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,840
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I used it to murder my girlfriend.

1385
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,600
I didn't really feel like holding on to it.

1386
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:34,170
Hey, look, we need to
focus on what is next.

1387
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,810
- Exactly.
- All right.

1388
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,645
Everybody, listen up.
I've got some provisions.

1389
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,291
I think we need to get far away from here
where the zombies can't get to us.

1390
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,488
We cleared this sector, Zach.
We're safe here. Don't worry about it.

1391
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,641
- Like where?
- ZACH: Machu Picchu.

1392
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,926
- Macho what?
- JUDY: Where's that?

1393
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,162
- Zach, we cleared the sector.
- Kyle, stop interrupting your brother.

1394
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,725
- Act your age.
- Macho what?

1395
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,201
Machu Picchu. It's remote and safe.
Look, I've got a map.

1396
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,408
I think if we take side streets
and sidewalks

1397
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,641
