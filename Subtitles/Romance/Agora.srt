1
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:38,744
The late fourth century A.D. the Roman Empire began to crumble.

2
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,745
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt, still retained some of its lustre

3
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:42,746
possessing two of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world:

4
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:45,247
The legendary lighthouse, and the biggest library known.

5
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:47,848
The library was a not only cultural but a religious symbol

6
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:49,849
a place where the pagans worshiped their ancestral gods.

7
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,350
The traditional pagan worship in the city now coexisted

8
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:55,851
with the Jews, and an unstoppable religion up to now banned:

9
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:57,852
Christianity

10
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:23,953
Library of Alexandria, 391 A.D.

11
00:56:17,854 --> 00:56:20,854
After taking the library, many pagans were converted.

12
00:56:20,856 --> 00:56:23,856
Hipatia continued teaching and researching

13
00:56:23,857 --> 00:56:25,857
while her former students held

14
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:28,858
important positions in the social elite.

15
00:56:29,859 --> 00:56:31,859
The empire was split in two forever.

16
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,860
Many Christians saw this as a sign of the end of the world

17
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:36,861
and decided to prepare by practicing a more holy life.

18
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,362
The order of "Parabolanos" monks was charged to go

19
00:56:41,363 --> 00:56:43,863
through the streets and watch for Christian morality

20
00:56:46,164 --> 00:56:49,960
now uneven by the presence of the Jews.

21
00:56:55,365 --> 00:56:58,865
The Library, years later.

22
01:53:22,866 --> 01:53:24,866
The body of Hipatia was mutilated and the remains

23
01:53:24,867 --> 01:53:26,867
were dragged through the streets and burned in a fire.

24
01:53:26,868 --> 01:53:28,868
Orestes was outlawed forever and Cirilo

25
01:53:28,869 --> 01:53:31,869
took control of the power in Alexandria.

26
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:39,870
Later, Cirilo was declared a Saint and Doctor of the Church.

27
01:53:44,871 --> 01:53:46,871
Although none of Hipatia's works remain

28
01:53:46,872 --> 01:53:48,872
it is known that she was an exceptional astronomer

29
01:53:48,873 --> 01:53:51,773
well-known for the mathematical study of conical curves.

30
01:53:56,874 --> 01:53:58,874
One thousand, two hundred years later

31
01:53:58,875 --> 01:54:00,875
in the 17th century, astronomer Johannes Kepler

32
01:54:00,876 --> 01:54:02,876
described that one of those curves

33
01:54:02,877 --> 01:54:04,877
the ellipse, governs the movement of the planets.
