00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,792
- Morning, Mr...
- Stuart.

331
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,198
- You could've killed us, Rhonda.
- Good move.

332
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,279
- Imagine dying a virgin!
- Oh, God.

333
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,871
- Nosebleed.
- Nurse, room 11.

334
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,835
- Good morning, I'm a substitute for...
- Good morning, Miss McGee.

335
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,476
- Good morning, Miss...

336
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,159
Mason.

337
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,352
- This is Mr...
- Mr Stuart.

338
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,438
I love your hair, Miss Mason.

339
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,870
Thank you, Mr Stuart.

340
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,470
Miss Mason will help you
while you're learning the ropes.

341
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,276
- My pleasure, I'm sure.
- I'm sure you're sure.

342
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,110
- I'm a substitute for Mr...
- Spears.

343
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,276
Follow me.

344
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,636
That's why we're gonna win this talent
show. 100 long-playing albumens.

345
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,753
- But we got zero talent.
- There must be ten Roy Orbisons there.

346
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,872
The greatest hits of Beeth-oven?

347
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,035
Good morning. My name is Mr Stuart
and I'm your substitute teacher.

348
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,357
(LAUGHTER AND CHATTER)

349
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,476
- Let's have a cigarette.
- Yeah.

350
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,798
- Uh-um.
- Mr Nogerelli. I've been looking for you.

351
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,514
Hello, Miss McGee.
You're looking lovely today.

352
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,188
There has been a rumour,
Mr Nogerelli,

353
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,190
that motorcycles have been driven
across our school lawn.

354
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,836
I know that couldn't have been you,
Mr Nogerelli.

355
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,591
I'm sure you have more respect
for grass than that. Right?

356
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,188
- Hear this. No more! Understood?
- Mm-mm.

357
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,712
Good. Do you smell something burning?

358
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,400
Mr Nogerelli...

359
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,433
I guess you sure told her, huh, Johnny?

360
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,839
- Water!
- Sorry, I'm sorry, Johnny!

361
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,314
I'll kill you!

362
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,150
- OK, we're ready.
- Good luck, girls.

363
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,638
The try-outs and we're the first.
I hope I don't blank out. Now!

364
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,395
# His loafers were Weejuns

365
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,070
# His chinos were black

366
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,114
# With a cute little buckle

367
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,709
# That fastened in back #

368
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,948
These are my girls.
There's some good breeding up there.

369
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,436
And that is so important.

370
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,918
- Hey, what's happening?
- Hey, Woodchuck.

371
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,749
Dolores, all right? What's happening?

372
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,518
"Brad".

373
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,359
Does this song stink, or what?

374
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,590
# Don't know what possessed me

375
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,234
# But I gave him my address

376
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,319
- # And my heart shook with fear
- (BACKSTAGE CHATTER)

377
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,115
# As I prayed that I'd hear

378
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,515
# From Brad

379
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,439
# Hear from Brad #

380
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,395
(SHARON) I won't let a little hard work
come between me and 100 LPs.

381
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,878
We're calendar girls. You have to
get into your seasons, become them.

382
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,868
Rhonda, you're fall.
Give me maturity, give me ageing...

383
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,957
- Give me a break.
- Lunchtime.

384
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,989
# Then at yesterday's tea dance

385
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,829
# My day turned to night

386
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,070
# Muffy Rogers was wearing Brad's pin

387
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,236
# I could just die #

388
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,113
Thank you, but we haven't got all day.

389
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,869
- But these are my girls.
- I know, dear. Next!

390
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,629
OK, OK, we're almost ready.

391
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,196
I want everybody to sing
their ah, ah, ahs.

392
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,029
Take your music.
Do I have to do everything myself?

393
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,515
Are you ready?

394
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,711
# Ah-ha-ha...

395
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,151
# I'll be your girl for all seasons

396
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,828
# All the year through #

397
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,233
- Hello.
- Hi.

398
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,194
- Are you free after school today?
- I'm free every day.

399
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,311
It's in the Constitution.

400
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,833
- OK, we're ready.
- Sharon Cooper and the Seasons.

401
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,636
- (DAVEY) Ouch!
- # If you fall in the fall you'll see

402
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,550
# September can be heavenly #

403
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,478
- Eugene, ready with the leaves?
- Ready.

404
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,878
# When autumn leaves
are falling from the tree #

405
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,231
(RHONDA) I'm sick of being a tree.

406
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,194
- That's enough. Thank you.
- We still have three more seasons!

407
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,109
- I need the stage for my Drama class.
- Oh!

408
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,072
Sharon, what about tonight?

409
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,029
- How about a hamburger later?
- I'm busy.

410
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,036
- How about tomorrow?
- Busy.

411
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,837
So maybe you can explain
about the bowling alley.

412
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,397
- You just don't kiss a guy and...
- It was just a joke. Forget it.

413
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,910
- Let me give you a hand.
- I can manage.

414
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,350
- I think he's in love.
- I think he's cute.

415
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,596
I think you should shut your yaps.

416
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,790
You forgot this one.

417
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,835
- Thanks.
- The day after tomorrow?

418
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,636
(SIGHS)

419
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,514
Stephanie...

420
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,598
Look, when are you
gonna get the picture?

421
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,558
# If you really want to know

422
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,399
# What I want in a guy

# Well, I'm lookin' for a dream

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,198
# Then I'll wait forever

# Just give me a black motorcycle

# With a man growin' out of the seat

English, I got something scholastic
to discuss with you.

466
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,557
What I'm saying is
you're Mr History, right?

467
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,470
I got this essay on the fall of Rome.
I didn't even know they were in trouble.

468
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,717
- What are you driving at?
- Papers for paper.

469
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,753
Essays for cash?

470
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,628
- So that's it.
- What's what?

471
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,472
- It'll have to be a motorcycle.
- Good idea. Invest in a cycle. So?

472
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,910
- You've got a deal.
- All right.

473
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,079
When we make the drop,
not out in the open like this.

474
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,999
I got a rep to protect.

475
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,079
It's open.

476
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,716
Your uncle said you was back out here.
What is this joint?

477
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,037
- It's his nuclear fallout shelter.
- Yeah?

478
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,835
- You got that essay?
- You got the cash?

479
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,191
This is a neat joint.

480
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,109
A nucleoid shelter.
It's private, good for homework

481
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,279
and other activities
involving student bodies.

482
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,833
Mm-hm.

483
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,316
Can you handle a couple
of History assignments also?

484
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,354
- I'll try.
- OK, and remember, this is between us.

485
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,109
- I got a rep to protect here, OK?
- Yeah.

486
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,631
William the Conqueror, by the Goose.

487
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,911
Oh, God.

488
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,674
Nobody, but nobody,
knows this happened, dig?

489
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,030
Whatever you say.

490
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,589
That's very nice. Nice penmanship.

491
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,997
Remember. I got a rep to protect.
OK, Shakespeare?

492
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,395
(TAPPING)

493
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,553
Reproduction.

494
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,231
It's very simple, but yet very important.

495
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,433
Now, what is the best time of the month
for a woman to conceive?

496
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,030
Mr...

497
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,719
...Jaworski.

498
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,999
- What's "conceive"?
- You know, to be fertile.

499
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,954

I can see that we're not getting very far.

506
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,550
I got the same problem.

00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,320
- Morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

508
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,114
Good morning, Mr Stuart.

509
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,512
- Let's start at the beginning. Page one.
- Open your book.

510
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,350
- "Where do babies come from?"
- If you need me, I'll be right over here.

511
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,120
Do we need this for the exam?

512
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,790
# The parts of a flower

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,994
# Very, very often
the wind will cause pollination

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,194
# If not, then a bee or any other
nectar-gathering creature

515
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,949
# Can create the same situation

516
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,312
# Yes, anything that gets the pollen
to the pistil's right on the list

517
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,114
# I'll try to make it crystal clear

518
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,758
# A flower's insatiable passion
turns its life into a circus of debauchery

519
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,276
# Now you see just how the stamen
gets its lusty dust on to the stigma

520
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,032
# And why this frenzied chlorophyllous
orgy starts each spring is no enigma

521
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,312
# We call this quest for satisfaction

Next chapter.

536
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,430
Now, in an abstract way,
the same thing applies

537
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,632
to the reproductive organs
of the more complex life-forms.

538
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,594
But we are now dealing
with sexual response.

539
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,268
Are there any questions
before we begin reading?

540
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,075
# Is it possible the female member
of some sex on a couch

541
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,070
# Could, like, get this guy all hot
and she never even knew it?

# Can't prove it by me

Are there any comments on that?

560
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,314

01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,356
- Hi.
- Hi.

834
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,869
<i>Can I pay so I can get out of here?</i>

835
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,914
Yeah, look, hold on just one minute,
OK?

836
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,879
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

837
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,190
OK, that's two, three, four, five.

838
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,756
- <i>(MAN) Where are the maps?</i>
- What kind?

839
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,076
- <i>(LAD Y) Street maps.</i>
- Yeah?

840
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,719
Hey, miss. What do I owe you?

841
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,673
Eh... 50 cents.

842
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,753
- How about that ride?
- My windshield!

843
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:12,672
- You forgot our green stamps.
- <i>We're in a hurry. The maps?</i>

844
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,233
Are you going to get
this windshield or not? Come on.

845
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:26,071
- Honk it where the sun don't shine!
- Where are you going?

846
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,228
Oh, I can't stop shivering.

847
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,635
Then hold on.

848
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,638
That's what's making me shiver.

849
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,949
- Great ride.
- We're home.

850
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,839
Shoot.

851
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,951
- I can't stop shivering now.
- Why?

852
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,549
Because...

853
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:36,151
- There's something I should tell you.
- What?

854
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,472
- (RUMBLE OF ENGINES)
- Oh, no. We've got company.

855
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,190
- Check this out!
- I can handle these guys.

856
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,437
- He popped Balmudo.
- Look who he's poppin' now.

857
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,552
When am I gonna see you again?

858
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,478
Friday night. The Talent Show.

859
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,069
Let's go!

860
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,518
Out front, you hear?

861
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,958
Talent Show?

862
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,634
<i>(S TEPHANIE) How'd he know?</i>

863
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,876
Hi. What are you guys doin'?

864
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,232
What's the story
with the creep on the bike?

865
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,317
- What?
- The creep?

866
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,830
- Yeah, the creep, the story.
- (RHONDA) Shut up, Goose.

867
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,918
- (PAULETTE) Leave her alone.
- Shut up.

868
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,076
- Let's have it.
- What?

869
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,998
- The story.
- I think...

870
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,952
We don't care, Sharon!

871
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,436
No chick of mine messes
with no other creep except this...

872
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,393
...except me.
- No chick of yours?

873
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,558
- Someone's jealous.
- You never get jealous over me!

874
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,230
- I ain't jealous.
- Stay out of my life, then.

875
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,753
I'm out! I catch you with that punk again,
I'll rearrange his face.

876
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,315
He's a dead man. D-E-D!

877
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,876
You better decide
who belongs to who around here.

878
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,516
- You're making a scene.
- Because I'm getting mixed up.

879
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,711
You're embarrassing me.

880
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,194
Aah!

881
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,797
I think you owe Paulette an apology.

882
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,072
- Jerk!
- Where are you goin'?

883
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,918
Forget about it.

884
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,872
- Weirdos.
- Who needs broads?

885
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,517
Me. I get to second base with Sharon
and get called out when I try third.

886
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,439
He bombed out in the bomb shelter.

887
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:37,191
Yeah. I think we could all use
a little guaranteed... (WHISTLES)

888
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,436
...all-the-way action.

889
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,596

- Yeah?

932
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,311
Very nice.
We could win those albumens yet.

933
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,674
- We can win those albumens.
- We gotta get rid of the competition.

934
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:36,992
There is some very good work here
and some very sloppy work.

935
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,673
Miss Zinone, I would like to see you
about your Shakespeare essay.

- I gotta write the whole thing again.

942
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,515
- Do you want some help?
- I don't know.

943
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:22,239
Think it over. It's not a difficult decision.

944
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,873
- (PAULETTE) Steph, you comin'?
- Yeah. I'll think about it.

I don't usually do this bad in English.
I got other stuff on my mind these days.

- Can I help?
- No, it's not school.

947
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,589
- Let's get this over with.
- All right.

948
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,519
Where do you want to start?

949
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,315
- It's this guy.
- What guy?

950
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,559
- Forget it.
- I'm trying. You're not making it easy.

951
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,355
I had this idea of Mr Right.
A stupid idea, right?

952
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,314
- Right.
- Out of nowhere he shows up.

953
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,398
- Like some dream or something.
- Who?

954
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,398
- Mr Right.
- Oh, right.

955
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,798
I've seen him twice and both times
he's wearing these goggles.

- I don't even know who he is.
- Mr Right?

Isn't that kind of weird?

958
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:33,756
Not weird weird but, like, exciting weird.

959
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,314
So, what's the problem?

960
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,910
Maybe he's just not
everything I imagined.

961
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,680
What if he's just some ordinary guy?

962
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,633
What if he is, eh?

963
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,191
What if we get back
to the Shakespeare essay?

964
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,915
- Stephanie.
- I figured out Hamlet's problem.

965
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,351
No ketchup.

966
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,791
- He got along OK without it.
- They never put ketchup on.

967
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,028
How can you eat a hamburger
with no ketchup? Shoot that over here.

968
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,428
Where were we?

969
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,473
You figured out the problem
with their hamburgers.

970
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,877
You know what his big problem is?

971
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,833
No laughs.
The guy's gotta lighten up, right?

972
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,749
- Bite?
- No, thanks.

973
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,556
- Who are we talking about now?
- Hamlet.

974
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,398
Oh, right.

975
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,712
"Hamlet went nuts when he caught
his mother doing it with his uncle."

976
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,071
- Not so great?
- You have the right idea.

977
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,077
But you could've said,

978
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:54,957
Hamlet was tormented by his mother's
incestuous relationship with his uncle.

979
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:00,439
"Incestuous relationship"! Mason's
gonna flip when she reads this.

980
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,838
"Incestuous." You're a really
smart guy, you know that?

981
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,996
You must think I'm a dummy.

982
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:14,200
- Actually, I think you're kind of terrific.
- Get outta here.

983
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,870
You're the terrific one.
You know all this deep junk.

984
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,640
I don't understand it any better than you.

985
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:25,152
I just know a few big words
that impress English teachers.

986
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,876
You impressed me.
And I give credit to who I want, OK?

987
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,598
- To whom.
- To who, to whom, to you, that's whom.

988
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,635
- So learn how to take a compliment.
- All right.

989
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,952
- A hamburger for my friend. Loaded.
- With ketchup.

990
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,469
Double ketchup.

991
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,792
There are some very cool,
very scoreable broads at this joint.

992
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,833
Cool. Scoreable. What-not.

993
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,429
- Very nice.
- Very nice.

994
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,074
Lots of Rydell girls
would go out with you.

995
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,353
- What about you?
- Me? Are you kidding? That's all I need.

996
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,680
- No, I wasn't.
- God, look, I didn't mean anything...

997
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,829
- We're just different types, that's all.
- Different types?

998

Leave the jacket. I got a rep to protect.

we don't damage new friends, dig?

1362
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,911

1367
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:44,872

1369
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:51,157
