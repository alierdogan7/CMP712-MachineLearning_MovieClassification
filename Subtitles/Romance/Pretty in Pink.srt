1
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,162
(rock music playing)

2
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:38,806
*

3
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:48,816
*

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,429
* Caroline laughs
and it's raining all day *

5
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:05,099
* She loves to be
one of the girls *

6
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,369
* She lives in the place
in the side of our lives *

7
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,673
* Where nothing
is ever put straight *

8
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,143
* She turns herself round
and she smiles and she says *

9
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:19,280
* "This is it,
that's the end of the joke" *

10
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,516
* And loses herself
in her dreaming and sleep *

11
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,419
* And her lovers walk through
in their cloaks *

12
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,855
* She's...

13
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:31,359
* Pretty in pink

14
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,728
Daddy, it's 7:30!

15
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:39,367
* Pretty in pink...

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,202
Daddy, it's 7:30!

17
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,838
Daddy, wake up!

18
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,574
Morning, Daddy.
Come on, wake up.

19
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,310
Wake up. Come on,
wake up.

20
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,312
Come on, wake up.

21
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,846
There's your coffee
right there.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,549
Where am I?

23
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,751
Here. I want you
to drink this.

24
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,453
Then I want you
to take a shower.

25
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:00,621
Then I want you
to get dressed.

26
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,156
There are your
clothes right there.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,157
And then I want you
to go see the woman

28
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,425
about the job, okay?

29
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,826
Today,
you promised.
I know.

30
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,461
What would I do
without you nagging me

31
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,629
all the time?

32
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:09,863
You really want me
to answer that?

33
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:14,602
God, I been getting in
kind of late lately.

34
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,637
We haven't had a chance
to talk, or anything.

35
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,771
Well, don't worry about it.

36
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,340
There hasn't been a lot to say.

37
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,809
Is everything all right
with you?

38
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,211
Yeah.

39
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,578
Is school good?

40
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,647
No, but it never is.

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,482
Have you been asked

42
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,218
to the prom?
No.

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,588
When was the last time
I told you

44
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:35,789
how beautiful you are?

45
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,791
About yesterday.

46
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,361
Hey, hey, turn around.

47
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,196
What?
You know what.

48
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,664
Come here,
let me see this outfit.

49
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,433
Is this your latest
creation?

50
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:46,567
Uh-huh.

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,635
This is it.

52
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,437
My God,
what did that cost you?

53
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,274
Oh, about $15 for the shoes,
secondhand and I made the rest.

54
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,343
Unbelievable.

55
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,747
I was thinking, maybe, that, um,

56
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,649
you could do something
with this.

57
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,384
Maybe put some ruffles up here.

58
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,518
Come on, get up!

59
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,486
Really, I mean it.

60
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,554
This means a lot to me.

61
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,888
Honey, I'm perfectly happy

62
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,523
with what I'm doing.

63
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,525
You're perfectly happy
with part-time work?

64
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,395
No.

65
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,663
That's why I'm getting up.

66
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,697
Okay.

67
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,899
I'll make some breakfast.

68
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,910
I'm up!

69
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:48,228
*

70
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:53,301
*

71
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,968
Hi, Blane.

72
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,737
Hi, Kate, how you doing?

73
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,572
Fine. How are you?
Good.

74
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,485
'Morning!

75
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,454
Welcome to another day
of higher education.

76
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,756
Hi, Duckie, how are you?

77
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,791
Mm, not all that bad,
considering I'm in this dump.

78
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,762
You know, this is a really
volcanic ensemble

79
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,297
you're wearing;
it's really marvelous.

80
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,565
Volcanic?
Well, you know,

81
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,733
hot, dangerous.

82
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,335
Are you going
to class today?

83
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,437
Well, I don't know
if I'm emotionally ready.

84
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,305
Oh, go for it-- it's
virtually painless.

85
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,940
(class bell rings)
Excuse me.

86
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,875
I gotta go, okay.
I'll see you at lunch.
Okay.

87
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,610
Well, listen, I'll call ahead

88
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,346
to the cafeteria and make
a couple of reservations.

89
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,513
You know, two
by the window.

90
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:40,781
Sure.
Ah, well, no,

91
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,483
you don't like
to sit in the sun.

92
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,917
Okay, something else.
Uh, listen, may

93
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,886
I admire you
again today?

94
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,527
Ah, ladies, ladies,
uh, listen,

95
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,062
I may be able to work out
a deal where either one,

96
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,930
or the both of you, could be
pregnant by the holidays.

97
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:57,998
What do you say?

98
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,903
(girls snicker)

99
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,374
Some argue that The New Deal
saved the capitalist system.

100
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,775
And as evidence

101
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,978
that the Roosevelt
administration was trying

102
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,047
to avoid excessive
governmental power.

103
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,750
Rather than
implant socialism,

104
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,419
in his first act as president,

105
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:22,656
Mr. Roosevelt enacted
The Emergency Banking Act,

106
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,325
and he refused to consider
nationalization.

107
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,098
Where'd you get
your clothes,

108
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,535
five and dime store?

109
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,837
KATE (snickering):
Attractive.

110
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,406
Is there a problem,

111
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,673
ladies?

112
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,708
No!

113
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,009
KATE:
No.

114
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:46,547
Andie, is there something going
on between you

115
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,015
and these ladies?

116
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,550
No, not that I'm aware of.

117
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,488
I'd like to apologize on behalf

118
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,557
of Miss Trombley
and Miss Hanson.

119
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,626
These two young ladies will be
thinking of you tonight

120
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,461
as they write a summary
of the chapters

121
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,029
that we've just covered.

122
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,965
Great.

123
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:09,903
Excuse me.

124
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,605
Yeah.

125
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,842
Um, there's nothing wrong
with me, I mean, I fine.

126
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,410
Can you just forget
about the chapter?

127
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,981
Yes?

128
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,916
We'll take the chapter.

129
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,786
Fine. Let's go on.

130
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,756
The Emergency
Banking Act.

131
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,725
(rock music playing)

132
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,427
See you guys later.

133
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,465
Oh, Andie,
you look ravishing.

134
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,066
So, we graduate
in a month.

135
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,001
Now, I want to know
when it is you

136
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,036
and I are going to get together
and do something?

137
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,738
Try never.

138
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,740
Well, I'm talking
about more than sex here.

139
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,075
No, you're not.

140
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,810
You know, I've liked you
for four years

141
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,211
and you treat me
like shit, you know.

142
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,113
I don't,
I don't understand that.

143
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,448
What's your problem?

144
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:55,916
Can you get
off of my car?

145
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,019
You know, I've been out

146
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,721
with a lot of girls
at this school.

147
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,223
I don't see
what makes you so different.

148
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,792
I have some taste.

149
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:09,697
You're a bitch.

150
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,799
You know, I think
you ought to see a doctor,

151
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:12,900
'cause that condition of yours

152
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,868
can get a lot worse.

153
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,143
(door closes, engine starts)

154
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,819
(buzz of conversation)

155
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:42,896
(staple gun snapping )

156
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:48,969
Applause, applause, applause.

157
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,639
This is beautiful.

158
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,842
It's so... modern.

159
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,011
I mean, is this fab, or what?

160
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,246
It's great.

161
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,516
I'm very,
very good at this.

162
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,651
I know.

163
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,218
Such a waste

164
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,756
that I run a lowly
little retail outlet.

165
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,724
No, not if you're good at it.

166
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,694
I'm good in bed.
Should I be a whore?

167
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,733
It's great.

168
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,735
Mmmm.

169
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,737
Did you say that you went
to your prom?

170
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,773
Yeah, sure.

171
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,608
Was it terrible?

172
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,142
It was the worst.

173
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,143
But it's supposed to be,

174
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,211
you know what I mean.

175
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,613
But you have to go, right?

176
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,247
Well, you don't have to.

177
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,949
I mean, it's not a requirement.

178
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,885
I have this girl friend
who didn't go to hers,

179
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,119
and every once in a while

180
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,621
she gets
this really terrible feeling,

181
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,255
you know,
like something is missing.

182
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,792
She checks her purse, you know,
she checks her keys,

183
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,760
she counts her kids,
she goes crazy,

184
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,762
and then she realizes that...

185
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:51,264
nothing is missing.

186
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:55,035
She decided it was side effects
from skipping the prom.

187
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,037
I don't know, I mean,

188
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,272
part of me says just go
and get it over with,

189
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,875
and this other part of me says
it's a stupid tradition

190
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:02,843
and what's the point?

191
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,645
Well, you know,...

192
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:11,652
you could say that life itself
is a... stupid tradition,

193
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,955
but don't analyze it;
just go.

194
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,924
(lid opening)

195
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,628
Put that back!

196
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,931
You missed my eye by an inch!

197
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,699
Half an inch.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,069
IONA: This ain't
the public library,

199
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,638
(shop bell tinkling)
light fingers!

200
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,598
(phone rings)
I'll get it.

201
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,973
IONA: Trax,
what do you want?

202
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,776
IONA: Tyrone,
you blow.

203
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,878
Yeah, I'm working.

204
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,980
Leave me alone!

205
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,048
(fake laugh)

206
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,650
That's thrilling!

207
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:20,120
I cook for you,
I do your laundry,

208
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,155
I sleep with you,
now you want a ride

209
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,724
to work?!

210
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,694
Please, grow up!

211
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:29,997
Take the bus!

212
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,800
Take a cab!

213
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,134
How you doing?

214
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,769
Fine.
Good.

215
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,170
Can I help you?

216
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,872
Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,440
Can I get your opinion
on something here?

218
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,010
Maybe.

219
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,878
Maybe.

220
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,847
This any good?

221
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,451
IONA: Sticks
and stones, Tyrone.

222
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,453
It's hot.
IONA:Sticks
and stones.

223
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,822
White-hot.

224
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,190
Good. I'll take it.

225
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:02,295
Okay, um, will that be cash
or charge?

226
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,464
American Express Platinum Card,

227
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,933
maybe?

228
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,167
IONA: Take a bus
to the zoo!

229
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,301
Cash.

230
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,337
IONA:
You know...

231
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,406
every time you go to the john,
you lose IQ points.

232
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,444
(whispering):
It's Walter Mondale.

233
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,980
And...

234
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,716
$7:50 is your change.

235
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,851
Thanks.

236
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,953
IONA:
Tyrone... no.

237
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,220
I don't need a bag.

238
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,456
No?
No.

239
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,458
IONA:
I can't do these
things for you.

240
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,760
Thanks.
Enjoy it.

241
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:33,927
Thanks.

242
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,162
(door opens,
shop bell tinkles)

243
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,364
IONA:
Bondage has no place
in my life.

244
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,431
(bell tinkles, door closes)

245
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,233
Since when?

246
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,970
Since I spent the night tied up
in the backseat of your car!

247
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:51,178
* I stuck my head out
of an empty room *

248
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:57,717
* Expectin' nothin'
but the new room view *

249
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,391
* I swear
I saw the future below me *

250
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:10,197
* Spitting in the face of doom

251
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,866
* Yes, so I'm sayin'

252
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,967
* Tonight *

253
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,136
* Whoa, tonight

254
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,539
* Rudy, come on
and rule it tonight *

255
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,874
* Tonight *

256
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,409
* Yeah, tonight

257
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,178
* Rudy, come on
and rule it tonight *

258
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,546
* Tonight *

259
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,182
* Rudy...
* Tonight... *

260
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,884
Jena?
Yeah.

261
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,485
Well, would you ever consider
going out

262
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,854
with somebody that had money?

263
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,325
I don't think
it makes a difference.

264
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,528
I mean... it's material.

265
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:46,967
Simon?

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,802
Simon!

267
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,538
What would you do
if your father came
home a rich man?

268
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,906
Kiss his ass.

269
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,274
See?

270
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,542
See what?

271
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,177
What Simon
just said.

272
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,379
What S...

273
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,348
Andie, what are you getting at?

274
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,083
Are you... are you going out
with a rich guy or something?

275
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,551
I got to go.

276
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,186
Hey, wait, wait!
You didn't answer my question.

277
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,454
No!

278
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,588
Good.

279
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,257
Simon, it's been
stimulating.

280
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,293
How long
I been coming here?

281
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,995
I don't know,
a couple years.

282
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,463
Okay, so, you know,
we're buddies.

283
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,597
We're close, right?

284
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,598
Oh, yeah,
oh, yeah.

285
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,133
Very, pal.

286
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,202
Okay, so how many times
have you let me in?

287
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,137
I never let you in.
You know that.

288
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,438
You see, you see
what I'm saying?

289
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,140
I don't know.
What are you saying?

290
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,109
What I'm saying is,
my girlfriend is in there,

291
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,577
and I'm out here.

292
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,245
Well, she's a girl,
and she's my friend,

293
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,881
so she's a girl friend,

294
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,448
but she's in there,
and I'm out here!

295
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,616
I mean, you're a sensitive,

296
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,385
sexually potent
kind of guy.

297
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,253
You got to know how that hurts.

298
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,455
Well, let me ask you
a question seriously.

299
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,225
Why does she come here,
knowing I don't let you in?

300
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,427
Huh? Think
about it.

301
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,496
I don't know.

302
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,098
(laughs)

303
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,366
All right, my advice
to you is, uh...

304
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,602
dump her, lose her.

305
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,870
You don't need that.

306
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,271
You see what
I'm saying?

307
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,607
You see the point
I'm trying to make?

308
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,142
Love's a bitch, Duck.

309
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,011
Love's a bitch.

310
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,079
Ain't it the truth,
ain't it the truth.

311
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:07,981
Oh, it's
the truth.
High five.

312
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,482
All right.
Go for it.

313
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,185
Hey, want to try
a cigarette? Come on.

314
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,954
Oh, the babe,
the babe, the babe.

315
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,622
Hey, honey, honey, let me
ask you a personal question.

316
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,624
If you worship the Duck,

317
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,893
why don't you hang out somewhere
he could get in, I mean...

318
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:20,994
Dice, Dice Man, hey!

319
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,329
Say hello to the
wife and kids.

320
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,496
You know what
I'm saying?
Yeah.

321
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,965
You see, the Dice
Man is dyslexic.

322
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,433
He gets everything
backwards.

323
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,500
What he meant to say was,
like, if I worship...

324
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,402
It's okay, Duckie.

325
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,238
Okay, 'cause... you're sure,
because if he offended you,

326
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,639
I would gladly clean
up this parking lot
with his butt.

327
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,107
No, I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.

328
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,308
Okay, okay.
Were you here long?

329
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,643
Nah, nah, three,
four hours.

330
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,378
You have a good
time, at least?

331
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,612
Uh-huh.

332
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,314
Oh, good. That's
good. Now, what now?

333
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:42,515
Bed.

334
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,017
Yours, or mine?

335
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,986
Ours?
Nice try.

336
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,488
Okay. Can you at least
give me a ride home?

337
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,923
Yeah. Get in.

338
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,994
Aha. Can I, like,
put my head in your lap?

339
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,263
No, wait. Can I rest my head
on your shoulder

340
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,397
and let you steer?

341
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,566
Get in, Duckie.
Okay.

342
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,168
(instrumental
rock music playing)

343
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,702
(tape squealing)

344
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,172
(jazzy instrumental rock
playing)

345
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,639
ANDIE:
These houses are
amazing, Duck.

346
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,042
DUCKIE:
Hey, the first million
I make, I buy you one.

347
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,477
I hate this song.

348
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,711
They're so
beautiful!
(tape squealing)

349
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,313
Hey, you want beauty,
look in the mirror.

350
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,647
(indistinct rock vocal plays)

351
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,283
This whole tape
is horrible.
(tape squealing)

352
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,617
(instrumental rock music plays)

353
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,452
I-I must be going through,
like, a hormone thing,

354
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,688
'cause every song
I listen to is making me sick.

355
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,057
I mean, why can't
I find a decent song here?

356
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,027
That one's my favorite.

357
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,161
Are you deaf?

358
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,097
The house!

359
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,465
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's, that's...

360
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,734
That's a nice little,
little crib.

361
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,304
Wonder what it's like inside.

362
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,440
Well, what-what difference
does it make?

363
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,709
You know what the really
sad thing is, though?

364
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,112
I bet the people
that live there don't think

365
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,446
it's half as pretty as I do.

366
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,547
You know
what I mean?

367
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,282
You know, Andie, I'm just...

368
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,351
They just don't write love songs
like they used to.

369
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,120
It's... I-I... Oh.

370
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,055
I'm angry about this,
you know?

371
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,223
I... this...

372
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,357
My evening's shot. I...

373
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,726
Just drive me home now.

374
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,694
(computer keyboards clicking)

375
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,466
(woman speaking quietly)

376
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,768
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

377
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,538
WOMAN:
That's...
That's right.

378
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,440
(keys clicking,
indistinct chatter)

379
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,548
(sighs)

380
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,650
(keys clicking)

381
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,188
WOMAN:
All right.

382
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,484
(typing)

383
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,492
(beeping)

384
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,615
DUCKIE:
Well, the reason I came over--

385
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,717
I mean, other than I've
been planning to come by

386
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,352
and just say hello--

387
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,387
I wanted... I wanted to
talk to you about Andie.

388
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,223
Yeah?

389
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,724
I mean, she's... she's an
incredible individual.

390
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,092
I mean, you
know that.

391
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,360
I mean, I'm
there for her!

392
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,694
Whenever, however,
I'm there.

393
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,430
You can rest assured
that she's covered.

394
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:44,797
I don't want
you to worry,

395
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,367
because my only future plans
are to make sure

396
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,835
that she's taken care of.

397
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,104
That's nice of you, Phil.
(clears throat)

398
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,873
And I'd like to marry her.

399
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,443
Oh, well, not... you
know, not-not today,

400
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,211
but eventually,
I figure.

401
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,513
Well, does Andie know
how you feel about this?

402
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:01,781
Uh...

403
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,184
No confirmation
on that just yet.

404
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,253
I mean, I'm-I'm laying
the groundwork and everything.

405
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,288
You know, I'm thinking
in terms of housing,

406
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,523
you know, food,
basic needs type
of stuff, but

407
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,691
I'm picking my moment.

408
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,160
Mm-hmm.

409
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,527
Yeah, I mean, you
understand, right?

410
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,895
(chuckles)
Oh, sure.

411
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,232
I felt the same way
about somebody myself.

412
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,600
Oh, a girl?

413
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,402
A girl.

414
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,571
(laughs)

415
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,773
Um, I loved her, and, uh,

416
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,908
I mar... married her.

417
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,744
And, uh, one day she just split.

418
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,247
Oh, wait. This was...
This was Andie's mom?

419
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,415
Yeah.

420
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,516
Oh.

421
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,385
(laughs)

422
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,688
So, uh, I haven't seen her
in, uh, three years, you know,

423
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,691
and, um, but I still love her
just as...

424
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:48,528
as much as I ever did, you know?

425
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,231
I mean, you can
love Andie,

426
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,266
but that doesn't mean
she's gonna love you back.

427
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,735
I mean, doesn't mean
that she won't, but, uh,

428
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,537
what I'm trying to say is,

429
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,606
you can't make it happen,
you know?

430
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,308
It either will, or it won't.

431
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,376
Uh, it's all in the heart.

432
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,811
Oh, y-yeah, sure.

433
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,246
I... Cardiovascular.

434
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,814
Yeah, I-I understand. I-I...

435
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,249
I've been
to school.
(chuckles)

436
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,783
Yeah.

437
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,919
Well, uh, I got an appointment
with a vacuum cleaner.

438
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,255
Got to go.

439
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:18,425
Hey, you're on a
whole home improvement
jag here, aren't you?

440
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,926
Yup. Turn the old life around.

441
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,661
Yeah. Well, hey,
more power to you.

442
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,397
If Tina Turner can do it,
Jack Walsh can do it, too.

443
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,498
(laughs)
Well,

444
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,833
thanks for taking your time.

445
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,735
I really... You know,
I-I appreciate it.

446
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:29,936
My pleasure.

447
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,638
I'm off like a dirty shirt.

448
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,772
(chuckles)

449
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,374
(distant train bell clanging)

450
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,376
Tina Turner.

451
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,944
(train bell clanging)

452
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,813
(humming)

453
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,249
(instrumental rock music plays)

454
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,917
(door opening,
shop bell tinkling)

455
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,354
(door closing,
shop bell tinkling)

456
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,290
Hiya.

457
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,591
(laughs)
Hiya.

458
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,295
Um, oh, we just got
these glasses in.

459
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,996
They're really, um...

460
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,866
Yeah, I didn't like that album
I got the other day.
...dumb.

461
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,468
What?
What?

462
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,935
The record.
Oh, the record.

463
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,638
Uh, yeah, I thought
it was a little too, uh...

464
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,307
Too hip, maybe?

465
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,977
Yeah, a little too hip.

466
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,512
ANDIE:
Well, um...

467
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,381
BLANE:
Think you can recommend
something else

468
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,582
a little less political

469
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,251
or something?

470
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,586
Lionel Ritchie?

471
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,987
Nah.

472
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,322
(sucks air
through teeth)

473
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,357
No. Uh, well, hmm...

474
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,992
Tina Marie, Madonna?

475
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,327
Madonna?

476
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,461
Yeah, Madonna.

477
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:29,596
That's awfully deep.

478
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:30,863
Yeah, very deep.

479
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,866
But she's got
such great style.

480
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,735
Yeah.
Yeah, listen, um...

481
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,270
(burglar alarm ringing)
Um, that's the alarm.

482
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,771
Can you hold
on for a second?

483
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:39,772
Sure.
Just... I'll, I'll
be right back.

484
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,741
Okay.

485
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,610
Here, read this.

486
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,345
It's really good. Don't...
No, no, no, you can...

487
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,513
Hold on.

488
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,781
What is this?

489
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,350
(alarm continues )

490
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,551
(loudly):
Hi!

491
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,919
How's your day?!

492
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,922
Baby pumps out
about 300 decibels, huh?

493
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:56,923
(alarm stops)

494
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:57,790
Did you do this?

495
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,025
Well, I'm not sure.

496
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,361
I mean, I was just using
your powder room,

497
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,929
and I decided not
to disturb you,

498
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,465
so I was going
to go out the back door,

499
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,367
but I guess I must have
touched something.

500
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,835
How'd you
get in here?
Are you mad?

501
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,503
Yes, I'm mad!

502
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,505
There are public bathrooms
all over the place!

503
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,374
I'm not nine, Andie.
I know that.

504
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,376
It's just, it's the end
of the month.

505
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,677
They're out
of toilet seat covers.

506
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,546
(knocking)

507
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,048
DUCKIE:
You know what I stickler
I am about personal hygiene.

508
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,450
It's very
important to me.

509
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,584
ANDIE:
That's ridiculous.

510
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,386
We want you to
stop making...

511
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,654
Blane, what are you doing?

512
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:28,888
Hey, buddy,
what's up?

513
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,657
Nothing,
hanging out.

514
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,426
Well, what are you shopping
for, records or something?

515
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,994
I guess.
You find anything?

516
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,463
No, not really.
Not really.

517
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,798
Well, are we gonna shoot
some track, or what?

518
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,800
'Cause, I mean, if we're gonna
shoot, we got to shake it, man.

519
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,502
I don't have anyplace
to go.

520
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,371
I like coming here.
Excuse me very much.

521
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,439
It's okay. I'm sorry
for getting mad at you.

522
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,475
I got to get back
out in front, okay?

523
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,676
See you later.

524
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,378
(shop bell tinkling)

525
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,386
(alarm ringing)

526
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,120
This is a shitty
alarm system.

527
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,690
I opened and closed
the door five times
before it rang.

528
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:04,957
That's it,
I'm leaving.

529
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,559
I'm not going
to stay here.

530
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,760
No, no way!

531
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:08,728
(door slams)

532
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,768
(sighs)

533
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,755
Uh, hi, it's 6:05.
Duckie Dale. Give me a call.

534
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,057
(answering machine beeps)

535
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,594
Um, 6:15. Duckie Dale again.
Call me, okay?

536
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:43,496
(beep)

537
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,866
(singsongy):
Andie, where are you?
This is the Duck.

538
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,501
Give me a call, okay?

539
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,169
(beep)

540
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,071
Uh, it's 6:28.

541
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,473
(sighs)

542
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:56,976
Please call,
please, please, please!

543
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,980
This is Duckie, are you really
home and just not picking up?

544
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,182
'Cause if so, I feel like
a giant asshole here.

545
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,618
It's 6:31, give me a call,
okay, please?

546
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,020
(beep)

547
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,088
(phone rings)

548
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,923
DUCKIE:
Andie, this is...

549
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,792
Duckie, I'll just talk to you
in the morning, okay?

550
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,761
Bye.
(sighs)

551
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,010
(sighs)

552
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,718
(train whistle blowing)

553
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:43,623
(humming "Santa Lucia")

554
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:47,126
* Prospero il vento

555
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,162
* Prospero il vento...

556
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,631
What are you doing up?

557
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,799
I didn't wake you up yet.

558
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,166
Well, I'm fixing
breakfast.

559
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,769
One egg, over-medium,
and I fed the dog.

560
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:57,970
Oh, did Daddy
feed you, huh?

561
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,171
Your egg, madame.

562
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,773
Oh, I don't eat eggs,
Daddy.

563
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,609
Here, why don't you go in
and eat it.

564
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,110
I'll bring you your coffee
and juice, okay?

565
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,211
Okay.

566
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:08,615
Since when don't you like eggs?

567
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:09,716
Oh, since about birth.

568
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:11,083
Don't worry about it.

569
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,219
Hey, you never told me
why you were up.

570
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,253
Well, it's morning.

571
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,689
Oh, you mean,

572
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,825
why didn't you have to drag
my ass out of bed?

573
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:19,959
Okay.

574
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,227
Well, I gotta job.

575
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,129
No?!

576
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,931
Yeah.

577
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,966
Where?!

578
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,969
Um, well, I'll tell you
after I start.

579
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,505
When's that?

580
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,707
Soon.

581
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,943
I'm so proud of you!

582
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,110
You got the job.

583
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,512
No big deal.

584
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:40,780
Yes, it is a big deal.

585
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,214
It's a very big deal.

586
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,650
Listen, I gotta
go, okay?

587
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:44,884
I'm gonna be late
for school.

588
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,252
You tell me all
about it tonight.

589
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,787
I'm so proud
of you.
All right,

590
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,756
it'll be real good.

591
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,281
Hi, guys.

592
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:18,985
How you doing?

593
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,286
Fine.

594
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,154
And you?
Okay.

595
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,756
And you?

596
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,324
Well, I just said
I was fine.

597
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,293
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

598
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,798
So, is this your
first time out here?

599
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,265
Yeah.

600
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,901
I don't think
I'm very popular out here

601
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:35,968
either.

602
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,637
Oh, I don't know.

603
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,105
You're just fine inside.

604
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,340
I don't know.

605
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,242
I'm not really into
all their shit, you know.

606
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,212
Yeah.

607
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,180
(softly):
Yeah.

608
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,219
Oh, um, I really liked
your computer trick.

609
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,987
Clever, huh?

610
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,957
Terribly clever, yeah, terribly.

611
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,329
Are you late for something?

612
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,632
Yeah, I am, as a matter of fact.

613
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:07,033
But I mean, it's no big deal.

614
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,068
Um...

615
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:12,071
Listen, do you want to...
you want to go out Friday?

616
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,273
Yeah.

617
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,242
Yeah?

618
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,677
Sure.

619
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,211
Yeah? Okay!
Sure.

620
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,680
Uh, 7:00, okay?

621
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,181
Yeah, that's fine.
Great. Great.

622
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:25,051
Well, where do you live?
I'll pick you up.

623
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,020
Where do you live?

624
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,321
Oh, I, I...
No, I'm sorry, um,

625
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,823
I'm gonna be working on Friday,

626
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:32,859
so you can just pick me up
at the mall.

627
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,093
Okay.
Okay?

628
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,227
Bye.

629
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,196
See ya.

630
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,209
Hey, Blane.

631
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,811
How you doing?

632
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,646
Hey, buddy,
what's up?

633
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,114
What are you up to?

634
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,716
Oh, not much.
Going to class.

635
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,217
I thought
I saw you outside.

636
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,719
So?

637
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:01,253
So, what are you doing?

638
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,389
What are you, my mother?

639
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,057
Come on, I gotta go.

640
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,993
I'll see you later.
Blane, what's going on?

641
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:07,994
Nothing.

642
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,295
Well, not nothing,

643
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,997
I mean, I saw you talking
to that chick--

644
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,665
what's her name?--
Eddie or something.

645
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,200
So, what do you care?

646
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,736
Listen, my best friend is
conversing with a mutant,

647
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,337
you know, I'm curious.

648
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,272
I don't think that's any reason
to get defensive.

649
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,141
I'm not defensive.

650
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,743
I just happen to like her,
all right?

651
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,177
Listen, all right,
it's you know,,

652
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,913
it's your life,
it's none of my business.

653
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,281
You really don't think
she's got something?

654
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,151
No.

655
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:35,755
I really don't,
I'm sorry.

656
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:38,290
You're gonna be late, buddy.

657
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,359
(class bell rings)

658
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,467
Okay, the Warsaw Pact's a treaty

659
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,102
that was signed
by the Soviet Union

660
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,071
and its seven East European
satellites, okay.

661
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,774
And what it did was...

662
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:55,908
it established a mutual

663
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,043
defense organization

664
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,144
as a counterweight
to NATO.

665
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,278
Duckie!
What?

666
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,180
What? What? What?

667
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,915
Well, what'd I put?

668
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,183
You wrote,

669
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,252
the Warsaw Pact is
the pact that's named

670
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,286
after Warsaw.

671
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,755
Uh-huh.

672
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:09,989
So, the teacher's just
gonna know

673
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,290
that you're just bullshitting.

674
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,326
Okay, okay,
what about the rest of it?

675
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,028
Well,
the Russian Revolution

676
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,897
did not take place
in Germany.
Ow.

677
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,331
Well, what was Karl Marx, then?

678
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,000
He was a German.

679
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,802
Well, there you go.

680
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:25,137
Yes, but his being German
doesn't have anything

681
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,139
to do with where
the Russian Revolution occurred.

682
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,909
Okay, okay.

683
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:34,346
Okay, Duckie, can I propose
something to you

684
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,882
without your getting upset,
or angry?

685
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,884
Well, that depends.

686
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,151
On what?

687
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:40,887
I don't know,
I just said that.

688
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,988
Go ahead.

689
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:43,422
Well, I propose

690
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,857
that you're deliberately
flunking your courses

691
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,358
so that you can stay
in high school.

692
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,927
Get out of here!

693
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,361
Why, why, why
would I do that?

694
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,830
I don't know,
you tell me.

695
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:51,964
Well, I'm not.

696
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:53,465
So, there's
nothing to tell.

697
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,968
Well, you know, you're not
always one to face things.

698
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,103
What, since when?

699
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,270
What, what am
I not facing?

700
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,872
The future.

701
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,974
Well, whether or not you
face the future, it happens,

702
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:03,209
right?

703
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,111
You run yourself down.
Why do you do that?

704
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,478
I am not running
myself...

705
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,047
You think I'm
running my...

706
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,381
I don't think I'm
running myself down.

707
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,183
Why b-b-because, because
of the way I dress?

708
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,852
'Cause, 'cause I can
laugh at myself?

709
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,253
That's called a
sense of humor.

710
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,255
You should get one;
they're nice.

711
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,424
What are we gonna do
next year?

712
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,492
Well, according to you, I'll
still be in high school.

713
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:21,527
No, I'm serious.

714
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,062
I mean, not a day
has passed,

715
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,530
in, what, eight years,
when I didn't see you

716
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,065
or talk to you
at least 20 times.

717
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,400
Well, that's devotion.

718
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,837
I know, and even though
I sometimes get angry,

719
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,171
you know that
I secretly love it.

720
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,206
You see, I knew that.

721
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,243
You know, I hope I'm not
the only one in the world

722
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,278
that knows what an incredible
person you are.

723
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:43,415
Well, at this point in time,
I'm afraid you are, honey.

724
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,351
Okay, I'm gonna get something
to drink

725
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,986
and then we work,
okay, you promise?

726
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,921
Oh, you bet.
Okay,
what do you want?

727
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,924
Oh, beer, scotch,
juice box, whatever.

728
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,893
Okay.

729
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:57,563
(sighs)

730
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,565
Oh, God.

731
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,835
I love this woman.

732
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:06,172
I love this woman
and I have to tell her.

733
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:09,341
And if she laughs, she laughs.

734
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:13,379
And if she doesn't love me,
she doesn't love me.

735
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:16,916
But if... if I don't find out...

736
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:19,585
Oh, I love her too much.

737
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,554
(sighs)

738
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,028
* Love is real...

739
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,429
(makes sound of crowd)

740
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,931
Thank you, thank you.

741
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,200
* Real is love...

742
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,935
You're a wonderful crowd here,
you know that.

743
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,069
(panting)

744
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:38,470
* Love is living

745
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,339
(imitates crowd noise)

746
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,573
(dog whines)

747
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:42,909
(chuckles)

748
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,076
You're fabulous,
I do love you,

749
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,277
I do love you,
you're gorgeous.

750
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,412
I love your hair.

751
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,647
* Love is feeling

752
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,118
* Feeling love

753
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,120
(laughs)

754
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:57,223
(dog barking)
* Love is wanting

755
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,590
Ah!

756
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,628
She's gonna laugh.

757
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,197
Would I blame her?

758
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,900
Here you go.
Oh, shit.

759
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,368
Honey, thanks, uh,
but I'm gonna split,

760
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,170
you know.
Why?
What about your paper?

761
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,072
Uh, that's, that's what
I'm gonna do, you see,

762
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,941
'cause, I mean,
if you help me, thanks a lot,

763
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,308
but it'll, it'll,

764
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,110
it won't be my work,
it'll be bogus.

765
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,146
And, you know, and I guess
I'll see you in the a.m..

766
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:24,050
Hey, drinking and
driving don't mix.

767
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,018
That's why I
ride a bike.

768
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,322
(sighs)

769
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,629
I got it.

770
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:41,934
(screams)

771
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:47,306
JENA:
So, uh, what's the deal?

772
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,008
You going out
this weekend?
I don't know.

773
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,342
I'm not sure yet.
Mm?

774
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,011
Why? What are
you gonna do?

775
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,612
Stay home.
Yeah, you going
to study again?

776
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,214
Probably.

777
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,548
Would you put that out?
(giggling):
No.

778
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,717
Well, you study so much,
it makes me ill.

779
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,019
I just don't
see the point.

780
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:01,520
You don't?
Mm-mmm.

781
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,489
I don't want to work
in a record store my whole life.

782
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,391
Yeah? What do you
want to be a doctor?

783
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,359
(whistle blows)
Oh, God.

784
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:09,028
(sighs)

785
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,429
TEACHER:
Okay, let's go,
everybody.

786
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,631
Get in your lines, please,
thank you!

787
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,566
Fulmeister.

788
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,168
Here.

789
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:18,437
Besset!

790
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,372
Basono!

791
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,108
Goulong.

792
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,376
Oh, look, watch out.

793
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,677
Ooh.

794
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,079
Deeds!
Do we smell bad,
or something?

795
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,214
(whispering):
Hey, Benny.

796
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:29,115
Fox.

797
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,482
Penfield.

798
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:32,184
I hope they shrivel
up and fall off.

799
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:33,419
(whistle blows)
Okay.

800
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,587
What was that, Miss Hoeman?

801
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,389
Um.

802
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,991
(clears throat)

803
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,327
I said, I hope they shrivel up
and fall off.

804
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,561
(lightly laughs)

805
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,363
You hope what shrivels up

806
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,497
and falls off?

807
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:47,366
Her breasts, Miss Dietz.

808
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,500
(laughs)

809
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:50,036
Shut up!
I'm sorry.

810
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:53,205
You are out of here,

811
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:55,107
Hoeman.
Right.

812
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,043
Bye-bye.

813
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,011
Bye, girls.

814
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:03,282
So, uh,

815
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,284
do you share
your partner's attitude?

816
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,486
No, I don't.

817
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,194
(under breath):
Eat shit!

818
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:20,099
Excuse me, Miss Dietz.

819
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,034
You've only got a couple
of months left.

820
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:24,103
You're doing extremely well
in your courses.

821
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:26,072
And I think
your chances

822
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:28,307
of getting a scholarship
are excellent.

823
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,042
I know this, Mr. Donnelly.

824
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,577
Why are you in here now?

825
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,778
I don't know.

826
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,813
I guess I just got
a little fed up.

827
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,582
With what?

828
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,184
The way that we get treated.

829
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,253
Look, uh...

830
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:44,656
you're getting
a top-notch education here,

831
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,659
and I just don't want
to see you throw it away.

832
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,162
I'm getting a better education
than I deserve.

833
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,330
I'm lucky.

834
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,664
I'm fortunate
that the good people

835
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,666
of this community allow me
to attend this school.

836
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,502
Again,
you are misunderstanding me.

837
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,570
No, I understand everything,
Mr. Donnelly.

838
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,839
I don't need
to have it explained to me.

839
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,474
I live it.

840
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,243
It's just sometimes
I get a little upset

841
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,777
and I lose my temper.

842
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:08,480
I just don't like to see
my friends getting dumped on

843
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:12,684
and punished
for defending themselves.

844
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:17,456
Well, uh, we'll just forget
about this whole thing, okay?

845
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,825
Okay.

846
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:23,329
What about Jena?

847
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:25,597
She's off, too.

848
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,734
Thank you.

849
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,602
Andie...

850
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:34,540
if you put out signals that
you don't want to belong,

851
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,342
people are going to make
sure that you don't.

852
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,578
That's a beautiful theory.

853
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,182
Andie, Andie,
Andie, listen.

854
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:45,717
I heard what happened and,
and I came as fast as I could.

855
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,253
I cut out of home ec
and everything.

856
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:48,420
Was, was it really bad?

857
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:49,821
No, it was nothing.
Are you upset?

858
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,590
No, I'm not.
No-- yes,
yes, you are.

859
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,459
I can tell; your eyes get
all squinty and everything.

860
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,494
Listen, I know just what to
do to make you feel better.

861
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:56,762
I feel fine.

862
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,564
I want to take you
away this weekend.

863
00:34:58,597 --> 00:34:59,565
Do you fish?

864
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,766
(Andie sighs, class bell rings)

865
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:01,900
Okay, then we
can go right now.

866
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,535
I have class.

867
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,537
Tonight at 7:00 and I won't
take no for an answer.

868
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,706
Try, please.

869
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,441
This woman is suffering inside.

870
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,577
That's all there is to it.

871
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,145
(banging loudly)

872
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,513
Yo, man, next time
I'll kick your ass.

873
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,382
Dat'll be dat.

874
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:19,318
Dat'll-- I'm just kidding;
that's-- it's a joke.

875
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,620
How about
that stock market?

876
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,356
My broker is E.F. Hutton, and
E.F. Hutton says...

877
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,357
You see,
it never works.

878
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:26,425
It never works.

879
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,894
I've never seen that work...

880
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,796
(girls scream)
DUCKIE: Oh, shit!

881
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,231
GIRL:
What's going on out there?

882
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:35,334
Aah...

883
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:38,637
So this is what
it looks like.

884
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,905
This is great.

885
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,640
Hey, wait a minute,
wai-w-w-w-wait.

886
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,775
You got doors on the
stalls, they're not stopped.

887
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,611
Wait a minute.

888
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,246
We don't have none of
this stuff in the boys'--

889
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,914
wait a minute, we
don't got none of this.

890
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,382
We don't got doors on the
stalls in the boys' room.

891
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,184
We don't have-- what
is this, what?

892
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:54,186
We don't have a candy
machine in the boys' room.

893
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,587
We don't got none of that.
GIRL: I'm gonna start screaming

894
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,256
in a minute if you
don't get out of here.

895
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,424
I'm sorry, no, I want
the principal here.

896
00:35:58,457 --> 00:35:59,625
I want him here
this instant.

897
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,560
I want-- now,
this instant.

898
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,561
I'll wait.

899
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,662
Thank you.

900
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,841
Oh, shit!

901
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,244
Why can't I do this?

902
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,547
What have you done?

903
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,415
This-- you have
to subtotal first.

904
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:24,583
I tell you this
every time.

905
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,585
You never listen.

906
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:31,590
One more tune, then it's off to
enjoy a terrible relationship.

907
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,292
(drops needle on record)

908
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:34,726
The furrier next door
loves this.

909
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,728
* Soft words

910
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:40,232
* They are spoke so gentle,
yeah *

911
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,769
(loud knocking)

912
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:47,473
* It makes it easier

913
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,808
* Easier to bear

914
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,343
(shop bell rings)

915
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,744
(snaps fingers)

916
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:55,347
* You won't regret it, no, no

917
00:36:57,483 --> 00:37:00,786
(mouthing words)
* Them young girls,
they don't forget it *

918
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,254
* Love

919
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:06,758
* Is their whole happiness

920
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,960
* Yeah

921
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:14,900
* But it's all so easy

922
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,902
* All you got to do is

923
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,970
* Try, try a little...

924
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,040
* Tenderness

925
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,612
* Yeah, oh,
you got to do it, man *

926
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,714
* Hold her where you want her

927
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,750
* Squeeze her, don't tease her

928
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,018
* Never leave her

929
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:35,287
* Give to her

930
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:38,657
* Got, got to try
a little tenderness *

931
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,392
* Yeah, yeah, yeah

932
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:43,395
* You got to know how
to love her, man *

933
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:49,301
* You've got to squeeze her,
don't tease her *

934
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,502
* Never leave

935
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:52,404
* You've got to hold her

936
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,440
* Rub her softly

937
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:58,410
* Try a little tenderness,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

938
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,646
* You got to rub her gently

939
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,681
* Don't bruise her, no, no

940
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,516
* You got to love her

941
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,319
* Tease her,
don't displease her *

942
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:09,087
* Got to try, now, now, now

943
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,389
* Try...

944
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,957
* Try a little tenderness

945
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,826
* Yeah...

946
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,629
* You got to know what to do,
man *

947
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,531
* Take this advice

948
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:24,436
* You got to love, squeeze,
don't tease my baby *

949
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,737
* Love her long...

950
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:26,872
(music fades out)

951
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,874
(breathing
heavily)

952
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,542
(with accent):
Evening, young ladies.

953
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:31,743
This is a very
good tune.

954
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:32,944
My mother used
to sing this.

955
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,480
This is Otis;
I love Otis.

956
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:35,814
We're closed.

957
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,683
You know what an older
woman does for me?

958
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:38,784
Changes your diapers?

959
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,552
(without accent:)
Touche.

960
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:41,920
No, seriously though, you're
a very smoky alternative,

961
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,390
but this is the Duck
Man's love in life.

962
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,391
Shall we?

963
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:46,525
You ever had one
of these?

964
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,761
I don't think so.

965
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,732
Come on... let's plow.

966
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,640
(with accent):
Do I offend?

967
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,978
Andie, hon.

968
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:10,015
Listen, it's after 7:00.

969
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,149
Don't waste good lip gloss.

970
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,851
I know, Iona.

971
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,786
I mean, I don't mean
to be a bitch or anything,

972
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,154
but I don't think

973
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,390
Mr. Wonderful is going
to happen tonight.

974
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:24,563
I don't know
what I'm doing.

975
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,865
Wishful makeupping.

976
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,534
Come on.

977
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:29,868
Wait, wait.

978
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,103
You babes are, like,
talking a sign language

979
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:34,540
that the old Ducker here
just does not understand.

980
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,041
Now, would you mind
filling me in here?

981
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,843
I'm a little confused.

982
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,412
She got stood
up, twerp.

983
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:41,513
Stood up?

984
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:43,181
Wait, h-how so? Wait, I'm here.

985
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,016
I mean, is this like one of
those feminine mystique deals

986
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,984
or something?

987
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,724
He showed.

988
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,529
Um...

989
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,131
Andie.

990
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:08,139
I'll get that.

991
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,580
Duckie,
I'm really sorry.

992
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,014
What, is this,
um, you're gonna,

993
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,816
you're gonna go
out with this guy?

994
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,918
I mean, is this, you know,
like, a date, or something?

995
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:20,919
Yeah.

996
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,654
I mean,
you'll like him.

997
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:25,524
He's not like the other guys,
seriously.

998
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:28,794
No, n-no way, Andie!

999
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:30,796
You really piss me
off, you know, 'cause,

1000
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,064
'cause you know they shit all
over everybody, including you.

1001
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,933
I just-- I can't believe
you'd be this stupid.

1002
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,468
Who's shitting on me?

1003
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:38,203
I'm not gonna let anybody shit
on me.

1004
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,572
He's just-- he's gonna use
your ass and throw you away.

1005
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,073
God, I would have died for you.

1006
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,575
So what am I supposed to do?

1007
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:44,810
He asked me out and I like him.

1008
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:46,712
If I hate him
because he's got mon--

1009
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:48,747
just listen to me-- if I hate
him because he's got money,

1010
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,882
that's the exact same thing as
them hating us because we don't.

1011
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,551
Do you understand?

1012
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,786
You can't do this
and, and respect yourself.

1013
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,121
Y-You, you... you can't.

1014
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,123
Well, I'll make that decision,
all right?

1015
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,125
Sure, you c--
you can do what you want.

1016
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,627
You know,
you're talking like that

1017
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,994
just because I'm going out
with Blane.

1018
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:03,995
Blane?

1019
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,831
His, his name is Blane?

1020
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:09,100
Oh... that's a major appliance,
that's not a name.

1021
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,936
Just because I'm going out
with Blane doesn't mean

1022
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,638
I can't be friends with you.

1023
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,840
I mean, it doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

1024
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:15,841
Oh, that's very nice.

1025
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,208
I'm, I'm glad.

1026
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:18,877
Here's... here's the point,
Andie.

1027
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,078
I'm n--
I'm not particularly concerned

1028
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,580
with whether or not you like me.

1029
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,816
'Cause I live to like you
and, and,

1030
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,217
and I can't like you anymore.

1031
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,121
So, so when you get your heart
splattered all over hell

1032
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,023
and, and you're feeling
really low and dirty,

1033
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:34,259
don't, don't look to me
to help pump you back up,

1034
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,695
'cause, 'cause, 'cause,
'cause maybe for the first time

1035
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:37,629
in your life, I won't be there.

1036
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:41,933
I can't believe
you're actually saying this.

1037
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:45,270
Well, I guess
that's just tough shit.

1038
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:55,614
Sorry.
Sorry.

1039
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,621
(loud thud)

1040
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,760
That guy in the store.

1041
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,128
Oh, he was
a friend of mine.

1042
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,731
I've known him
since I was a kid.

1043
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:14,199
He's a really nice guy.
Yeah?

1044
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,835
Yeah, I like him a lot.

1045
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,638
So you want to go
home and change?

1046
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,006
(laughs quietly)

1047
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,240
I already did.

1048
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,308
(laughs quietly)

1049
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,176
Sorry.
No, that's okay.

1050
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,612
Oh, boy.

1051
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:32,250
So, where are we going?

1052
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,853
You up for a party?

1053
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,088
Yeah? No? Maybe?

1054
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:40,992
No, I don't think so.

1055
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:42,928
Why?
"Why?"

1056
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:44,262
Come on, they're my
friends, it's okay.

1057
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,263
That's it;
they're your friends.

1058
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,898
I wouldn't take you

1059
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:48,333
if I didn't think
they'd accept you.

1060
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,636
Can't we just go
somewhere else?

1061
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:51,803
Hey, Andie,
I like you.

1062
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:53,805
I think you like me.

1063
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,641
I mean, we both know there's a
lot of bullshit that goes on,

1064
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:57,142
but if you're above
it, I'm above it.

1065
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,210
If we want to make anything
out of this whatever,

1066
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,912
we got to deal
with it, right?

1067
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,147
Yeah.

1068
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,215
Come on, I got as
much to lose as you.

1069
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,951
We can go out with your
friends if you want.

1070
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:08,319
Go crawl under a rock.

1071
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:10,155
Anything you want.

1072
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:11,690
The choice is yours.

1073
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,659
We can go hang gliding.
You like hang gliding?

1074
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:14,993
I've never been
hang gliding.

1075
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:18,196
Well, first
for everything.

1076
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:19,898
If it's a bad time, we leave.

1077
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,935
(thunder rumbling)

1078
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:53,732
*

1079
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:55,967
MAN (faintly):
It's time for more beer!

1080
00:43:58,036 --> 00:43:59,871
Hi, Blane.
Hey, Eddie.

1081
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,206
Hey, see
you later.

1082
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,641
(music playing,
partyers laughing and chatting)

1083
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:09,948
Hey, what's up, bro?

1084
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:16,755
Hey, aren't you the girl
in my art class?

1085
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:18,423
Nice pearls.

1086
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,992
This isn't a dinner party,
honey.

1087
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:21,993
Watch it.

1088
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:23,762
Hey, Blane,
how you doing?

1089
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:25,230
Hey, Kev, what's up?

1090
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:32,437
* So I keep believing

1091
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:36,407
* That you and I
can change the world *

1092
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,047
* I'm going 'round and 'round,
'round again *

1093
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,784
* I say things
that I really shouldn't say *

1094
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:49,120
* I'm going 'round,
'round again *

1095
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,029
I can't believe I actually
associate with these people.

1096
00:44:58,063 --> 00:45:00,966
I can't believe
that I'm actually here.

1097
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:02,433
Pretty bad, huh?

1098
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:04,836
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

1099
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:07,839
I'm sorry.

1100
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:08,840
Hey, let's go upstairs,

1101
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:11,009
huh?

1102
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,881
Look, I didn't come here
to get you off, okay?

1103
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:16,782
That was not my idea.

1104
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:17,949
Andie.

1105
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:19,484
Come on,
that is not what I meant.

1106
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:20,986
I haven't even tried
to kiss you, have I?

1107
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,489
Look, it's quieter
up there, okay?

1108
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:26,191
Come on.

1109
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,960
These hands will remain in
these pockets, I swear to God.

1110
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:40,005
Look at me here.

1111
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:41,106
Come on.

1112
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,207
I'm utterly defenseless.

1113
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,909
And utterly foolish.

1114
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:47,145
Come on.

1115
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:50,248
So what do you think
of these carpets, huh?

1116
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,217
Utterly fab.

1117
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,258
It's going to be good.

1118
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,360
Oh, hey, Blane.

1119
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:04,295
Steff.
How're you doing?

1120
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:06,497
All right...
no, I'll get another room.

1121
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:09,534
No, no, no, no, come on in.
I'm watching some tunes here.

1122
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:12,303
So... who you got
with you here, Blane?

1123
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:16,507
Uh, Andie, this is
Steff; Steff, Andie.

1124
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:19,544
Oh, it's very nice
to meet you, Andie.

1125
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:24,282
Ah, listen, uh, you want
to come in and s-sit down?

1126
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:26,885
Or you want the bed,
is that it?
No, no.

1127
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,987
We're fine.
At least come in
and have a drink.

1128
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,856
Let's go.
Can I get you something?

1129
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:34,259
I mean, this is my last
serious party of my
high school career.

1130
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:38,396
I hope you guys are
gonna tough it out
until Sunday,

1131
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,131
at least when
my folks get home.

1132
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:42,901
I think this one may
just finally kill the old

1133
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:44,135
son of a bitch, Blane.

1134
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:46,872
Another giant step away

1135
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:48,273
from virginity I went.

1136
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,541
You are a slut,
aren't you, Benny?

1137
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:03,554
(sighs):
Oh, my God.

1138
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:06,892
Am I having a nightmare?
We've got guests.

1139
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:09,427
BENNY:
I know you.

1140
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,929
You're in my calculus class.

1141
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:12,463
Gym.

1142
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,465
Your name's Jim?

1143
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:15,566
You are worthless,
aren't you?

1144
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:20,338
You and your friends gave me
a lot of shit the other day.
Everybody gives you shit.

1145
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,940
Take it easy, Benny, huh?

1146
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:24,209
This is Steff's party, Blane.

1147
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:25,376
Don't tell me what to do.

1148
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,178
Steff.

1149
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:30,348
I mean, you shouldn't be allowed
to invite just anybody.

1150
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:34,352
Steff, she's going
to ruin my night.

1151
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:35,486
Shut up, Benny!

1152
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,122
You're a faggot, Blane.

1153
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:39,090
All right, okay,
listen, Benny...

1154
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:44,029
Why don't we just...
Where are you going?

1155
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,131
Let's just leave them
with the room, okay?
Why?

1156
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:48,499
And we will get you
something to eat, all right.

1157
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,001
Oh, you've got what I want.

1158
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:52,137
Some ribs, or something.

1159
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,640
Listen, you guys, enjoy
yourselves, and, uh...

1160
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,608
we'll see you later, maybe.

1161
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:58,643
BENNY:
I doubt it.

1162
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:00,011
STEFF:
You all right?

1163
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:01,947
Fine. You're an asshole.
All right.

1164
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:05,516
I don't want
to know what you are.

1165
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,485
I'm gonna take her
to throw up somewhere.
Listen, enjoy yourself.

1166
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:13,224
They're kind of jerks
when they drink, huh?

1167
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:14,960
Bad idea.

1168
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:17,128
Can you just get me
out of here now?

1169
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:20,265
Yeah.

1170
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:22,133
Look, I don't want
to take you home.

1171
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:23,634
I mean, I'd like
to be with you.

1172
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,971
If not here, somewhere else;
anywhere you want.

1173
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:29,140
I'm sorry.

1174
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:30,708
What can I say?
I made a mistake.

1175
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,243
I overestimated my friends.

1176
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:35,013
I'm sorry.

1177
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:38,316
What, you want to hit me?

1178
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:40,385
Yes, I do.

1179
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,954
Be my guest.

1180
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,359
(indistinct chatter,
laughter)

1181
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,532
(The Rave-Ups
"Rave-up/Shut-up" begins)

1182
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,636
* Grow up

1183
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:02,507
* My good beliefs
say to me, stand up *

1184
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,211
* Like a real man is
supposed to be, rave up *

1185
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:09,747
* Rest of all
your fantasies, rave up *

1186
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,716
* It's just a dream...

1187
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:14,585
You want to know my thing?

1188
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,621
If I really have it
solid for a girl,

1189
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:21,459
I'll ride by her
house on my bike.

1190
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:25,263
I'll do it like...
like a hundred times in a day.

1191
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,065
It's really-- it's intense.

1192
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,334
You ever park?

1193
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:34,039
I'm kind of a drive-by
kind of guy.

1194
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:36,007
* Rave up

1195
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:39,544
* 'Cause being down
ain't being a rat's head up *

1196
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:44,149
* So fool those rats
another time, rave up... *

1197
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,484
You want a drink?
Yeah.

1198
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:47,618
Yeah?
Coke.

1199
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,420
Coke? Coke, okay.

1200
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:51,422
Give me your address.

1201
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:54,192
I'll, I'll put you on my route.

1202
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:01,032
Okay, you're gonna have
to help me out here.

1203
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:04,569
You know, you know, someday
that girl's going to realize
just what she missed.

1204
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:09,340
Come on, don't stop,
give me more!

1205
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:11,376
Yeah!

1206
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:14,712
Hi!
IONA:
Hi!

1207
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,581
Prince Charming whimp out?

1208
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:20,051
No, no, he's
at the bar.

1209
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:22,053
Duckie?

1210
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:23,588
(yawns)

1211
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,390
He's sulking.

1212
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:28,526
He's not gonna ride his bike
past your house anymore.

1213
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,562
Duckie, you're being

1214
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:34,199
a real jerk.

1215
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:37,335
How'd he get in here anyway?

1216
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:41,272
I said he was my kid.

1217
00:50:41,306 --> 00:50:43,541
How come you're here?

1218
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:46,544
I've been trying
to figure that all night.

1219
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,616
* You lost a lot
when you lost me *

1220
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,752
Sorry.
Mom make this for you?

1221
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,222
Yeah. Gross, huh?

1222
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:59,690
* You lost a lot
when you lost me *

1223
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:03,661
* Six paperback books
and a dime tree *

1224
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:09,300
* You lost a lot when you lost
me, six paperback books... *

1225
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:11,236
Hi.
Hi.

1226
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:12,703
Here you go.

1227
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,205
Thanks. You met Iona,
didn't you?

1228
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,241
Not formally.
Hi, Blane.

1229
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:18,376
And, um, that's
Duckie Dale over there
behind the glasses.

1230
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,377
Hi, Duckie.

1231
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,546
Philip F. Dale to you, scum wad.

1232
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,817
So where you guys been?

1233
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:28,719
Oh, a friend of mine
was having a party.

1234
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,721
Oh, how adorable.

1235
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:34,192
Yeah, it was a little intense.

1236
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:37,262
DUCKIE:
Oh, wait, wait,
you had an intense party?

1237
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:39,864
No, it was a friend
of mine's, I said.

1238
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:42,667
Duckie... shut up!

1239
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,736
What's the problem?

1240
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,605
This is a classic,
classic piece of work here.

1241
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,574
Duckie, please...
Phil.

1242
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,742
BLANE:
Hey, Phil, I think
you're making Andie
uncomfortable.

1243
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,611
Why don't you just knock it off?
What's the problem?

1244
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:56,414
I devoted my life to the girl,
and this guy, he comes

1245
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,416
in one day and-and-and thinks
he knows her, that's funny.

1246
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,385
You should give
David Letterman a ring sometime.

1247
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,420
I'm sure he'd book you
in a minute.

1248
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,854
Phil, would you
like us to leave?

1249
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,490
You know,
that's very perceptive.

1250
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:08,493
Come on.

1251
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:11,829
(laughing):
And look at the manners
on this guy; this was a treat.

1252
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,365
Really, thanks a million.
You're a great couple
of kids, really.

1253
00:52:14,399 --> 00:52:17,168
You know, I can't believe
I actually felt bad
for you tonight,

1254
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:18,536
retarded, little dwarf.

1255
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:21,272
See you.

1256
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:22,407
Nice meeting you.

1257
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,409
See you later.

1258
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:25,810
Sorry.
No problem.

1259
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:26,911
(mockingly):
No problem.

1260
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:27,912
You're an asshole.

1261
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,547
Hey, blow me, butt wad.

1262
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,848
Coming from you, I take
it as a compliment.

1263
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,318
Andie! Yo!

1264
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:38,623
You been replaced.

1265
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:46,397
Gee, I'm...
I'm sorry.

1266
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:48,899
(electric guitar
instrumental break)

1267
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:06,717
Well, what now?

1268
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:07,985
I gotta get up early.

1269
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,455
Why don't we
just forget it.

1270
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:12,423
What, home?

1271
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:16,327
Hey, you want to go
to my house?

1272
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,296
No, thanks.

1273
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:21,266
You want to eat?

1274
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:23,000
No.

1275
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,735
What do you want to do?

1276
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,737
Anything.

1277
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:29,474
Um... why don't you just
drop me off at Trax.

1278
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:30,675
You know,
I can, I can...
Trax?

1279
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,277
It's real close
to where I live.

1280
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,544
Well, it's late;
I'll just drop you home.

1281
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:34,879
You want to go home,
I'll drop you home.

1282
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:36,247
No, but I have something
I have to do there.

1283
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:37,915
Now? Come on, it's late.

1284
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,617
You want to go home,
I'll drop you home, it's fine.

1285
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,851
I don't want you
to take me home.

1286
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,753
Okay, let's go out.

1287
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,522
No, I don't want...
We'll go out,
anywhere you want,

1288
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,391
anything you
want to do.
I don't want to go out.

1289
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:47,425
You don't want to go out,
you don't want to go home.

1290
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:48,593
What do you want to do, Andie?

1291
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,395
I don't want you
to take me home.

1292
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:51,996
Wait, I'm missing something.
I'm not a jerk here.

1293
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,365
I don't understand
what you're saying.
Wait a minute.

1294
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:56,000
Let's go.
Don't walk away.
Wait a minute.
I'm talking to you.

1295
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:57,735
No. Just please, I just
don't want you...
Why?

1296
00:53:57,768 --> 00:53:59,003
Don't you understand me?!
No, I don't... at all.

1297
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,671
Will you listen to me?

1298
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:02,540
I don't want you
to take me home.
Okay, why?

1299
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,542
What is the problem?

1300
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,744
Because I don't want you
to see where I live, okay?

1301
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:08,413
What?

1302
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:10,415
I'm sorry, forget it.

1303
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:11,382
It's okay.

1304
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:15,753
(sotto voce):
Jesus Christ.

1305
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:18,589
(keys jangling)

1306
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,869
(car starts)

1307
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:41,278
(crickets chirping)

1308
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:46,917
(dogs barking in distance)

1309
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,320
I'm really sorry
for bumming out
the night for you.

1310
00:54:49,354 --> 00:54:51,389
You didn't bum out anything,
I had a great time.

1311
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:53,658
You liar.

1312
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:55,926
I was with you.
I had a great time.

1313
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,929
If I was in a Turkish prison,
I'd have a great time with you.

1314
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:01,866
I don't know, it's just...

1315
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:04,435
It's too weird for me, you know?
Maybe this shouldn't happen.

1316
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:07,338
What, you and me?

1317
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:09,807
Well, you know, maybe it
doesn't happen all the time,

1318
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,543
it doesn't mean it
isn't right. Right?

1319
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:14,779
Doesn't mean you can't try.

1320
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,786
Would you feel any better
if I asked you to the prom?

1321
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:26,491
I mean, I know the
prom's kind of lame,

1322
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:28,393
so if you don't want to go,
it's really no big deal.

1323
00:55:57,922 --> 00:55:59,857
(door squeaking)

1324
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,727
(screams)

1325
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,729
Hey. What?

1326
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:06,731
It happened!

1327
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:08,132
He asked me.

1328
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:09,734
And?

1329
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:11,802
I accepted!

1330
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:13,070
Well, congratulations.

1331
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,739
No more moping around

1332
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:16,974
the house waiting
for the telephone to ring?

1333
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:20,745
So... you in love?

1334
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,149
Yeah, I think I am.

1335
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:27,017
Well, who is this guy?

1336
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,153
His name is Blane.

1337
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:31,489
And he's a senior,
he's so beautiful.

1338
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:33,157
(both chuckle)

1339
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,493
Um, he's a... richie.

1340
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:37,662
A whatie?

1341
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:39,964
A richie, it's kind of stupid.

1342
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:41,966
It's just his family
has a lot of money.

1343
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:43,768
Oh, well, is that a problem?

1344
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,636
I don't know, it's just weird.

1345
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,037
You know, his friends
have a lot of money,

1346
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:48,873
and he has a lot of money.

1347
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,476
He drives a BMW.

1348
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:53,844
I don't know, I'm not really
sure if they're gonna accept me.

1349
00:56:53,878 --> 00:56:57,181
Well, what does that mean?

1350
00:56:57,214 --> 00:56:59,784
I mean, you like him,
he likes you.

1351
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:02,553
What his friends think shouldn't
make any difference.

1352
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:05,022
Yeah, but it's not just his
friends, it's my friends, too.

1353
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:08,526
It's everybody. I'm just not
real... secure about it.

1354
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,895
Well, so take the heat.

1355
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,831
I mean, you like him,
he likes you; it's worth it.

1356
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:14,832
Is it?

1357
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:16,601
Well, isn't it?

1358
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:19,770
You're right.

1359
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,608
I'm just overreacting,
aren't I?

1360
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:25,576
Oh, not necessarily.

1361
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,578
I mean, a good kiss
can scramble

1362
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:28,946
anybody's brain.

1363
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:33,518
Look, just don't worry
about it, you know?

1364
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:35,252
And wait and see
how you feel tomorrow.

1365
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,821
Good night, hon.

1366
00:57:36,854 --> 00:57:38,523
Good night. Thanks.

1367
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:40,491
That's my baby.

1368
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:44,895
Uh, honey.

1369
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,566
Uh, would you-- wait a minute.

1370
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:49,767
Could-could I ask you something?

1371
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,936
Yeah.

1372
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:57,675
Uh... sometimes
I feel a little sorry

1373
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:01,045
that, um, I'm the one you have
to talk to about these things.

1374
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:03,113
I'm not.

1375
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:05,516
She couldn't have said it
any better than you.

1376
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,618
I mean it.

1377
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:09,587
Good night.

1378
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:32,810
(mid-tempo rock beat playing)

1379
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,146
Okay, make my day.

1380
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,882
I want all the gory details.

1381
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:13,217
The mingling breath,

1382
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,286
the pounding heart,
the steamy windows.

1383
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,155
I want the whole scoop.

1384
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:19,657
Well, I hate to
disappoint you,

1385
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,992
but nothing happened.

1386
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:24,028
Nothing?

1387
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,564
Well, not nothing,
I mean, I kissed him.

1388
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:31,035
Anywhere interesting?

1389
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,037
Oh, please.

1390
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,705
So...

1391
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,707
uh...

1392
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:40,177
does he have strong lips?

1393
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,779
How can you tell?

1394
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,081
Do you feel it in your knees?

1395
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:46,183
I felt it everywhere.

1396
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:48,753
Strong lips.

1397
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:54,725
(Iona laughs)

1398
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:56,827
Talk about lips.

1399
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:58,262
(laughing)

1400
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:00,798
I mean, I'm old enough
to be his mother,

1401
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:01,932
but when the Duck laid

1402
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:02,967
that kiss on me
last night,

1403
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,334
I swear

1404
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:07,638
to God, my thighs just went up
in flames.

1405
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:10,808
He must practice on melons,
or something.

1406
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:12,276
This your prom dress?

1407
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:14,679
(laughs)

1408
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:16,280
Believe it or not.

1409
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,382
It's great.

1410
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:20,685
It's silly.

1411
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:22,653
It's great material.

1412
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:26,156
You know, I'm going...

1413
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,325
to prom.

1414
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:31,361
Stop it!

1415
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:33,664
(giggling):
Well, I am.

1416
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:35,666
Last night he asked me.

1417
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,835
And I don't know, I said yes.

1418
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,738
It's really weird.

1419
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,807
But it might be kind of fun.

1420
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:47,244
IONA:
You were here
for 15 minutes

1421
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,046
and you didn't
even tell me!

1422
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:52,249
ANDIE:
Oh, but I really,
really wanted to go.

1423
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:54,218
(giggles)

1424
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,757
You lucky girl.

1425
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:06,130
* Cherish is the word I use
to describe... *

1426
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:09,133
Isn't that a dreamy dress?

1427
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,368
* All the feeling

1428
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:16,874
* That I have hiding here
for you inside *

1429
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:20,978
* You don't know
how many times I've wished *

1430
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,947
* That I had told you

1431
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,015
* You don't know
how many times I've wished *

1432
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:26,350
* That I could hold you...

1433
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:27,952
Iona, I have to go.

1434
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:30,120
Can you just hold
till this song is over?

1435
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:33,123
But I have to leave.

1436
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:38,462
Oh, why can't we start old
and get younger?

1437
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,167
* Cherish is the word...

1438
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,069
I envy you.

1439
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:47,972
I really envy you!

1440
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:52,309
Iona, you're gonna
O.D. on nostalgia.

1441
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:55,846
I loved
"The Big Chill".

1442
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,448
I love this dress.

1443
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:00,017
It's a great dress.

1444
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,019
Yeah.

1445
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,054
My mother bought it
for me.

1446
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:06,323
God, she was so happy.

1447
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:07,925
It was the first

1448
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:10,127
and last time
I ever looked normal.

1449
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,229
I mean, you know,
relatively speaking.

1450
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:13,931
It would have been
a fairy tale

1451
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,166
if my date hadn't been
the only one at the prom

1452
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,467
with a...

1453
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:20,337
wife and two kids.

1454
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,207
You want to try it on?

1455
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,876
I bet it'd look great on you.

1456
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,345
I mean, your butt is
15 years younger than mine.

1457
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:30,781
I mean, I used to
have a great butt.

1458
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:31,882
I did!

1459
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:33,150
I loved my butt!

1460
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:34,484
I wish I had photographs
of it.

1461
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:35,820
You want to try
this on?

1462
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:36,954
Mm, nah, not right now.

1463
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:39,223
Oh, yeah,
you gotta go, I know.

1464
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,825
I know.

1465
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:41,992
I gotta get ready myself.

1466
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:43,327
You're going out?
Yeah.

1467
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,528
New guy.

1468
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:48,365
Terrance,
he owns a pet shop.

1469
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:50,100
We'll see
what happens.

1470
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:51,836
(giggles)

1471
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:53,003
Have fun.

1472
01:02:53,037 --> 01:02:55,172
Give Mr. Perfecto
a squeeze

1473
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:57,107
for me.
Oh, I will.

1474
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:59,243
Hey, listen, uh,

1475
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,012
if you see your
little Duck Man...

1476
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:03,280
be kind.

1477
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,983
He's nursing some
fairly serious wounds.

1478
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:08,018
Okay?

1479
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:10,420
Okay.

1480
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,189
Bye-bye.

1481
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:14,158
Bye.

1482
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:19,063
Hey, you know, we're going
for, uh, sushi.

1483
01:03:19,096 --> 01:03:21,966
Do you think this is too much?

1484
01:03:24,068 --> 01:03:25,269
Bye.

1485
01:03:27,371 --> 01:03:31,141
* You don't know how many times
I've wished that I... *

1486
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:33,410
Thought that was very
uncool of you

1487
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:35,412
last night,
Blane.
What?

1488
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:37,014
What?

1489
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:38,883
You mean Andie?

1490
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,150
Yeah, I mean Andie.

1491
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:41,318
What's the big deal, I like her.

1492
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:42,953
As a matter of fact,

1493
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:45,022
I was pissed off at you guys
for being so nasty

1494
01:03:45,055 --> 01:03:47,024
to her.
It was way out of order

1495
01:03:47,057 --> 01:03:48,926
for you to foist her
on the party.

1496
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,061
Steff, do you hear yourself?

1497
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:53,197
You hear the same asshole shit
I hear?

1498
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,265
What, do I have to spell it out
for you, Blane?

1499
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:56,967
I guess so.

1500
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:59,937
Nobody appreciates your sense
of humor, you know.

1501
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:02,506
As a matter of fact, everybody
is just about to puke from it.

1502
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:04,041
You know, if you've
got a hard-on

1503
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:05,409
for trash, don't
take care of it

1504
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:07,044
around us, pal,
all right?

1505
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:08,045
Right, buddy.

1506
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:09,546
Listen,

1507
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,615
I don't need a lot
of shit on this one, Blane,

1508
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:13,150
all right? I really don't.

1509
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:16,386
Money all that matters to you?

1510
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,455
Wh-Where in the hell does
that come from?

1511
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:21,458
Well, look around you, would I
treat my parents house like this

1512
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:22,927
if I, if money was any

1513
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,094
kind of issue?

1514
01:04:24,128 --> 01:04:25,462
Well, wh-why are
you doing this?

1515
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:27,097
You know, why don't
you just nail her

1516
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:28,465
and get it
over with.

1517
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:29,934
You know, why are
you getting involved?

1518
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:31,135
Is there something wrong
with that?

1519
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,402
I just think it's stupid.

1520
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:33,537
You know, it's pointless.

1521
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:34,972
you know, and
your parents,

1522
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:36,106
I think they'll
be thrilled.

1523
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,341
They have nothing to do with it.

1524
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,976
Really?
Yeah.

1525
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:40,911
I've seen your mother go to work
on you, Blane.

1526
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:42,346
You know, it's vicious!

1527
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,614
And when Bill and Joyce
get through with you,

1528
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:45,950
you won't know
whether to shit

1529
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:47,684
or go sailing.

1530
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,155
Listen, I, I'm getting really
bored with this conversation.

1531
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:53,023
All right, Blane.

1532
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,159
You know, if you want your
little piece of low-grade ass,

1533
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:56,226
fine, take it,

1534
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,394
you know,
but if you do,

1535
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:58,595
you're not gonna
have a friend.

1536
01:04:58,628 --> 01:04:59,629
Is that right?

1537
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:01,631
Yeah, that's right.

1538
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:04,001
I mean, if you want
to make the choice,

1539
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,635
go ahead and make
it, all right?

1540
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:08,505
I, I personally wouldn't trash
a friendship over it,

1541
01:05:08,538 --> 01:05:10,707
but... hey,
I'm old-fashioned.

1542
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,442
So...

1543
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:14,611
Why don't you take a shower;
you look like shit.

1544
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:18,448
ANDIE:
Two weeks ago,

1545
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:19,616
if somebody told me

1546
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,151
that I'd be going out with you,

1547
01:05:21,185 --> 01:05:22,452
I never would have
believed them.

1548
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:23,587
BLANE:
Why?

1549
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,688
I'm not all that bad.

1550
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,056
No, but...

1551
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,224
What about me and you?

1552
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:31,261
You know, it's so insane

1553
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:32,529
that somebody
you've never met,

1554
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:35,332
never talked to
can be your enemy.

1555
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:40,337
Mm... yeah.

1556
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:47,344
You shouldn't meet
my parents, then.

1557
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:48,445
(laughs)

1558
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,447
Okay.

1559
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,250
Well, I mean,
they're not ogres, but...

1560
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,085
(both laugh)

1561
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,522
I think they still believe
in arranged marriages.

1562
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:03,293
Corporate families replaced
royal families.

1563
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:07,064
I'm the crowned prince
of McDonnough Electric.

1564
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:09,399
It's irrelevant.

1565
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:11,368
No.

1566
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,606
Yeah.

1567
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,279
I could just tell them all
to go to hell.

1568
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,547
Tell them to go to hell.

1569
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,781
Everyone, friends,
parents.

1570
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,750
All of them.
All of them.

1571
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:30,254
What about you?

1572
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:31,755
Hmm?

1573
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:34,324
Somebody doesn't
believe in me, I...

1574
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:36,293
I can't believe in them.

1575
01:06:39,263 --> 01:06:41,365
You don't lie, do you?

1576
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:43,333
I don't have to lie.

1577
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:52,742
This is gonna happen.

1578
01:06:52,776 --> 01:06:55,712
Okay, I really want this
to happen.

1579
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,616
Yeah.

1580
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:55,839
(distant train passing)

1581
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:59,809
* So, please, please, please

1582
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:03,647
* Let me, let me, let me

1583
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,784
* Let me get what I want...

1584
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,502
Can I help you?

1585
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,237
I'm fine, thank you.

1586
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:28,705
Something for the prom?

1587
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:30,374
Just looking.

1588
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:33,343
Yeah, well, if you
need anything, uh...

1589
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:55,799
(sighs)

1590
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:57,267
This is trash.

1591
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:59,169
MOTHER:
It's very becoming.

1592
01:08:59,203 --> 01:09:00,604
Mother, it looks

1593
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,872
like I should be standing on top
of a wedding cake.

1594
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:05,309
Oh, darling,
don't I wish.

1595
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:07,177
And I hate
this material

1596
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:10,347
and by the way, I cannot
stand baby blue.

1597
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,317
(phone rings)

1598
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,594
(phone continues ringing)

1599
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,831
Well, do you know where he is?

1600
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:29,433
WOMAN:
No, I'm sorry,

1601
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:30,867
he didn't tell me
where he was going.

1602
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,936
Okay, well, then if he calls
or comes home

1603
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:34,638
can you just tell him
to call me?

1604
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,206
Who is this, please?
Andie.

1605
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,507
Who?
Andie!

1606
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:38,842
Well, yes,
could I have your number?

1607
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,477
Yeah, no, he has the number.

1608
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,811
Well, fine,
I'll leave him a note, dear.

1609
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:43,613
Okay, thanks. Bye.

1610
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,651
(sighs)

1611
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:50,254
Where in the hell is he?

1612
01:09:50,287 --> 01:09:52,256
(dog panting)

1613
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:54,758
(sighs)

1614
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:57,394
Never fall in love, Ace,
you just won't like it.

1615
01:09:57,427 --> 01:09:59,363
It's very complicated.

1616
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,822
Andie?

1617
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:33,930
Andie!

1618
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:38,001
(knocking on door)
Andie.

1619
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:39,903
Come in.

1620
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:43,707
Hi.
Hi, Daddy.

1621
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,442
I brought you
something.

1622
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:46,976
What is it?

1623
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:49,012
Well, it's a little
something I picked up

1624
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:51,014
for you.

1625
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,449
* Ta-tah.

1626
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:54,351
I know it's a
little busy,

1627
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:56,320
but I know you can make
something out of it.

1628
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:57,621
If you need to.

1629
01:10:57,654 --> 01:10:58,822
Wow.
Yeah.

1630
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:00,290
Do you like it?

1631
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:01,891
It's a beautiful color.

1632
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,328
Yeah.
It's really pretty.

1633
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:06,596
God, it reminds me so much
of your mom.

1634
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:09,366
You know, she
always wore pink.

1635
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:11,000
And she looked

1636
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:12,035
so beautiful in it.

1637
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:13,537
It's okay.

1638
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,071
Okay.
Thank you.

1639
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,073
Okay.

1640
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,675
Daddy.

1641
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,344
What?

1642
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:23,547
I just want you to know
I really appreciate this.

1643
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:26,516
I think I can make
something out of it.

1644
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:30,086
Can I ask you something?

1645
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,488
Sure.

1646
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:32,856
What?

1647
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:37,761
Where'd you get the money
to pay for this?

1648
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,863
Well, why, it wasn't that much.

1649
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:41,365
I had some money.

1650
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:42,499
From your new job?

1651
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:45,569
Ah, yeah, from my new job.

1652
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:47,404
(sighs)

1653
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:48,772
I came home before work
on Wednesday

1654
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,106
and your car was
in the driveway.

1655
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,376
Mm-hmm.

1656
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:54,478
You know,
you didn't have to lie to me.

1657
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:55,779
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.

1658
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,447
Yes, I did.
I had a line on something

1659
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:58,682
and I missed the
appointment.

1660
01:11:58,715 --> 01:11:59,683
Oh, why'd you miss
the appointment?

1661
01:11:59,716 --> 01:12:00,950
It slipped my mind.

1662
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:01,951
It didn't slip your mind.

1663
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,653
You didn't want the job.

1664
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,021
You just went to the counselor
because I forced you to.

1665
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,923
Am I right?
Yeah, what's your point, Andie?!

1666
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,958
My point is, you just didn't go!

1667
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:10,927
You saying I deliberately missed

1668
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,128
the appointment?
Yes.

1669
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,998
Is this how you feel about me?

1670
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:16,600
(sighs)

1671
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:18,001
Yes.

1672
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:20,804
Well, I didn't know this.

1673
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,406
Well, now you do.

1674
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:24,608
Oh, you know everything,
now, huh?

1675
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:25,842
You're 18

1676
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,477
and you got a
scholarship

1677
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:28,812
and, uh,
you're, uh,
That's not fair!

1678
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,447
all grown-up and free,

1679
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,081
and I'm just an ignorant
son of a bitch who never

1680
01:12:32,115 --> 01:12:33,683
gave you anything.
Hey, I never asked

1681
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:35,084
Oh, that's brilliant!

1682
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:36,953
Why can't you just forget her?!

1683
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:38,722
It's late; you got school.

1684
01:12:38,755 --> 01:12:40,457
No, don't walk out
on this!

1685
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,591
Will you please just

1686
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:42,826
listen to me?!
Please?!

1687
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,127
I've already been
through this, Andie!

1688
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,629
Sure, you go through
it every day!

1689
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:47,163
You're still
going through it!

1690
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,998
Why can't you just
realize that she's gone

1691
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:50,567
and she's not
gonna come back?!

1692
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,402
She's never
coming back!

1693
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:53,837
Shut up!
Dad...

1694
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,439
Goddamn it!
why can't you
accept it?!

1695
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:56,806
She's just gone!

1696
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,974
She...

1697
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:01,411
Why can't you accept it?

1698
01:13:01,445 --> 01:13:04,648
Because... I love her.

1699
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:05,982
That's why.

1700
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:08,117
Well, I loved her,
too, you know.

1701
01:13:08,151 --> 01:13:11,120
(crying)

1702
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:13,089
She just didn't
love us back.

1703
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:16,660
(sighs)

1704
01:13:18,695 --> 01:13:19,996
Okay, she tried.

1705
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:21,431
I don't know.

1706
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:23,433
She just couldn't handle it.

1707
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:26,135
Yeah, but I...
I-I knew it.

1708
01:13:26,169 --> 01:13:27,871
I knew it all along.

1709
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,974
I mean, when I was five,
I felt it.

1710
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:34,043
Remember when she didn't
come home that time?

1711
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:36,546
I knew it then,
I knew why.

1712
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,482
I was 14, and I knew it.

1713
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:40,617
You were 50,
and you didn't.

1714
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:44,454
You know, you can't go on
living every day in the past.

1715
01:13:44,488 --> 01:13:47,223
She left us, Daddy.
We didn't leave her.

1716
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,825
There was nothing
we could do about it.

1717
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:49,826
It just happened.

1718
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:51,795
(sighs)

1719
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,898
Since when is the
daughter supposed

1720
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,667
to know more
than her father?

1721
01:13:57,701 --> 01:13:58,768
(chuckles)

1722
01:13:58,802 --> 01:13:59,969
(sniffles)

1723
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:01,638
I've just been
a blind fool.

1724
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:03,072
(sighs)

1725
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:06,676
And you're a blind fool
that needs a shave, too.

1726
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,112
And I need a shave.

1727
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:10,780
(sighs heavily)

1728
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:12,048
Well...

1729
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:13,783
(sighs)

1730
01:14:13,817 --> 01:14:15,084
You'd better get to bed.

1731
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:16,486
You got school.

1732
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,154
And I got to hit
the hay, too,

1733
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,658
'cause I got a few things
that I got to do tomorrow.

1734
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:22,826
Okay?

1735
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:24,794
Okay.

1736
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,834
Uh, I would have
got you some shoes,

1737
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:33,503
but I didn't know your size.

1738
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:37,473
(door closes)

1739
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:00,229
(crying)

1740
01:15:01,565 --> 01:15:03,667
(sniffles and sighs)

1741
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:14,544
*

1742
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:24,554
*

1743
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:38,835
(class bell rings)

1744
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:49,613
How you doing?

1745
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:55,685
(indistinct crowd chatter)

1746
01:16:09,098 --> 01:16:11,100
How you doing?

1747
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:12,769
Why haven't
you called me?

1748
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,638
Oh, I got nailed for
the stable thing.

1749
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:16,973
I guess a groom saw us.
It's against club rules.

1750
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:20,043
I called you three times,
and I left messages.

1751
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,878
Yeah?

1752
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,681
Well, I-I didn't
get them. My family,

1753
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:26,950
they're very irresponsible
about that stuff, you know?

1754
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:28,785
I waited for you
this morning.

1755
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:30,386
Yeah? Where?

1756
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,888
Parking lot.

1757
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,793
I saw you, and I thought
that you saw me.

1758
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:40,630
No.

1759
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:43,266
What about prom, Blane?

1760
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:45,201
(sighs)

1761
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:49,038
Oh, Andie, I'm
having a bad day.
Can we talk later?

1762
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,373
No. What about prom?
Come on.

1763
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:51,675
Why don't we just
meet after school?

1764
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,677
No! What about prom?!

1765
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:54,811
Andie, come on.

1766
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:55,945
Just say it.
What?

1767
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:57,947
Just say it!
I want to hear you

1768
01:16:57,981 --> 01:16:59,248
say it.

1769
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:01,951
BLANE:
Andie, please,
all right?

1770
01:17:01,985 --> 01:17:03,887
I want to hear you say it.

1771
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:08,091
A month ago, I asked
somebody else,

1772
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,293
and I forgot.
You're a liar!

1773
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:11,861
You're a filthy,
fucking, no-good liar!

1774
01:17:11,895 --> 01:17:13,863
You don't have the guts
to tell me the truth!

1775
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:15,832
Just say it!
I'm not lying.

1776
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:17,133
Tell me!
What?

1777
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,401
Tell me!
What do you
want to hear?!

1778
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,269
Just tell me!
What?!

1779
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:21,771
You're ashamed
to be seen with me!

1780
01:17:21,805 --> 01:17:22,972
No, I am not, I am not!

1781
01:17:23,006 --> 01:17:24,140
You're ashamed
to go out with me!

1782
01:17:24,173 --> 01:17:26,009
You're afraid.
No, I'm...

1783
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,176
You're terrified
your Goddamn rich
friends won't approve!

1784
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:29,879
Just say it!

1785
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:32,716
Just tell me the truth!

1786
01:17:33,817 --> 01:17:35,852
(exhales deeply)

1787
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:37,120
You don't understand it.

1788
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:38,454
It has nothing at all

1789
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,857
to do with you.

1790
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:41,858
Andie!

1791
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:42,992
(footsteps running)

1792
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:45,128
Andie?

1793
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:06,415
Forget about it, man.

1794
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:08,417
It's not worth getting upset
over it, you know?

1795
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,419
BLANE:
Ah, why don't you just
take off, Steff, please?

1796
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:12,155
Well, listen, any girl
that did that to me,

1797
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,289
I would not be too jazzed

1798
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:15,759
to hold on to, Blane.

1799
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,160
It's not worth it, man.

1800
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:19,295
I told you,
it wasn't gonna work, you know.

1801
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,430
The girl was, is and
will always be nada.

1802
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,770
(door opening)

1803
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:35,044
(footsteps thudding on stairs)

1804
01:18:53,863 --> 01:18:55,431
You got a
problem, friend?

1805
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:00,303
(scoffs)

1806
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:06,542
(Duckie yelling)

1807
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:10,046
(grunting and groaning)

1808
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,382
(coughing)

1809
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:14,517
(grunts)

1810
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,351
Come on.

1811
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:26,762
(blows landing)

1812
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:28,798
(grunting)

1813
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,035
All right, all right!

1814
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,281
Nice, huh?

1815
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,322
* She was a showgirl
(gong-sounding doorbell chimes)

1816
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:55,291
* With yellow feathers
in her hair *

1817
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:58,127
* And a dress cut down
to there *
(gong chimes)

1818
01:19:58,161 --> 01:19:59,395
* She would merengue

1819
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:00,496
IONA:
* And do the cha-cha

1820
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,098
IONA:
Cha-cha!
Andie?

1821
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,233
* And while she tried
to be a star... *

1822
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:05,401
Yeah?
You're Andie,
aren't you?

1823
01:20:05,434 --> 01:20:07,103
Yeah, I am.

1824
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,537
Uh, how do you know me?

1825
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:09,873
Well, Iona told me.

1826
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:12,008
I'm Terrance. Terry.

1827
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:13,276
* They were young
and they had each other... *

1828
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:14,443
Oh, the pet shop, right?

1829
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:15,879
Yeah, among other things.

1830
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:17,213
She's in the bedroom
getting ready.

1831
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:19,315
You might want to go
in there and tell her

1832
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:20,950
to shake her tail
feather; we're late.

1833
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:23,219
Okay.

1834
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:25,454
* At the Copa, Copacabana

1835
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:27,456
Iona?

1836
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,093
* Music and passion
were always the fashion *

1837
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:31,427
Nice to meet you.

1838
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:34,597
* At the Copa

1839
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,165
* They fell in love

1840
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:37,433
* Copa *

1841
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:39,002
IONA:
* Copa

1842
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:42,605
* Cabana, a yellow feather

1843
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:45,341
* She was a show girl

1844
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,576
Iona?

1845
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:50,113
IONA:
Hi, honey.
I'm in here.

1846
01:20:50,146 --> 01:20:53,316
Laugh, and I'll deck ya.

1847
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,850
What happened?

1848
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:59,455
Either it's all those drugs
I took in the '60s,

1849
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:02,258
or I am really in love.

1850
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:04,127
(laughs)

1851
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,461
What do you think?

1852
01:21:05,494 --> 01:21:07,030
Honestly.

1853
01:21:07,063 --> 01:21:09,465
Honestly, I think
you look great.

1854
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:11,467
Oh, I look like a mother.

1855
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,536
No. Well,
yeah, a little,

1856
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:16,973
but that's okay.

1857
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:18,975
You look happy.

1858
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:21,344
I am.

1859
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,079
It's weird, but I...

1860
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:24,347
Did you meet him?

1861
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,614
Yeah.

1862
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:26,950
Yeah.

1863
01:21:26,983 --> 01:21:28,117
He's a yuppie,

1864
01:21:28,151 --> 01:21:30,086
but he's so nice.

1865
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,454
He's employed,
he's heterosexual.

1866
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:34,924
I swear to God,
I'm so far ahead of the game,

1867
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:36,993
next time you see me,
I'll probably be

1868
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:38,427
picking out
my china patterns.

1869
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:39,562
(laughs)

1870
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:41,097
(crying)

1871
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,365
Hey, are you all right?

1872
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:43,532
No, you're not.

1873
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:44,968
What...

1874
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:47,103
What, I blow your mind? No?

1875
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:48,671
No, that's not it.

1876
01:21:48,704 --> 01:21:51,207
It's boy trouble?

1877
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,708
The worst?

1878
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,110
Way beyond.

1879
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:57,480
He backed out on me.

1880
01:21:57,513 --> 01:22:00,483
He said he asked somebody
else, and he forgot about it.

1881
01:22:01,684 --> 01:22:03,352
(crying)

1882
01:22:03,386 --> 01:22:05,521
I can't believe it,
I can't believe it.

1883
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:07,490
(sighs)

1884
01:22:08,992 --> 01:22:10,326
I'm so humiliated.

1885
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:14,030
I could have killed
him! I swear!

1886
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:17,300
You know, I just
walked right into it.

1887
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:19,035
I know, I know.

1888
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:20,669
(sniffles)

1889
01:22:20,703 --> 01:22:24,107
Oh, love is awful,
isn't it? Oh.

1890
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,176
It's okay.

1891
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,311
(crying)

1892
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,514
(sniffling)

1893
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:33,549
(sighs and sniffles)

1894
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:37,720
You remember when I...

1895
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:39,488
and when you said
that-that, um,

1896
01:22:39,522 --> 01:22:42,025
if I wanted your prom
dress, I could have it?

1897
01:22:42,058 --> 01:22:43,159
Mm-hmm.

1898
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:44,427
Well, I need it.

1899
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,595
I want it.

1900
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,297
What for?

1901
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:49,432
(sighs)

1902
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:50,699
I just need it.

1903
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:52,168
(sniffles)

1904
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:54,137
Okay.

1905
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:57,373
It's yours.

1906
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:04,347
(rhythmic drumbeat)

1907
01:23:15,424 --> 01:23:17,360
(upbeat music playing)

1908
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:45,654
*

1909
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:55,664
*

1910
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:15,484
*

1911
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:23,126
*

1912
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:24,127
(whirring)

1913
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,212
Oh, God,
look at you.

1914
01:24:44,313 --> 01:24:46,315
Another first.

1915
01:24:46,349 --> 01:24:48,684
Your guy's going to fall through
the floor when he comes in.

1916
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,386
No, he won't.

1917
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,288
The hell he's not.

1918
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:53,489
No, he really won't.

1919
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,490
He's not coming.

1920
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:56,325
What?

1921
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:58,261
It's okay.

1922
01:24:58,294 --> 01:24:59,562
I'm gonna go.

1923
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,264
Alone?

1924
01:25:01,297 --> 01:25:02,431
Yeah, I'm not sad about it.

1925
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:04,300
I'm not hurt.

1926
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,802
I mean, you know,
I am hurt a little bit,

1927
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:09,705
but I know if I don't do it,
I'll just feel a lot worse.

1928
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:12,508
I'm just gonna go in,
walk in, walk out,

1929
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,443
and come home.

1930
01:25:14,477 --> 01:25:15,511
You sure?

1931
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:17,380
(sighs)

1932
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:19,748
I just want to let them know
that they didn't break me.

01:25:39,768 --> 01:25:43,706
* If you leave,
don't leave now *

1935
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:47,710
* Please don't take
my heart away *

1936
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:52,248
* Promise me
just one more night *

1937
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:55,618
* And we'll go
our separate ways *

1938
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:59,388
* We've always had
time on our sides *

1939
01:25:59,422 --> 01:26:02,258
* Now it's fading fast

1940
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:04,427
Open up.

1941
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:07,796
* Every second, every moment

1942
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:11,867
* We've got to,
gotta make it last *

1943
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:15,804
* I touch you once,
I touch you twice *

1944
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:17,473
* I won't let go at any price

1945
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:19,208
STEFF:
Well, as soon as

1946
01:26:19,242 --> 01:26:21,277
anybody's ready to go
upstairs and get serious,

1947
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,811
just let me know.

1948
01:26:22,845 --> 01:26:24,247
We've only been
here an hour.

1949
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,548
Well, we can go up

1950
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:27,950
and come back down
again, Benny, all right?

1951
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:29,652
Did you look
at the suite?

1952
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:31,820
STEFF:
It's 300 bucks
a night, Benny.

1953
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,922
It's not gonna be
a palace, okay?

1954
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:36,292
I think we should
stay for a while.

1955
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:38,294
We're not gonna see these
people for much longer.

1956
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:41,397
Come on, it's kind
of the end, okay?

1957
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,732
STEFF:
I don't give a
shit what you do.

1958
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:46,769
* I'll be running
the other way... *

1959
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:18,801
Oh, damn.

1960
01:27:58,907 --> 01:27:59,842
My God.

1961
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:04,980
You're here!
What happened?!

1962
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,416
Well, uh, guess
you're looking at it.

1963
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:08,684
Oh, wow, you look great.

1964
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:12,087
Thanks, you, uh,
you look stunning.

1965
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,457
Really, it's, it's,
it's breathtaking.

1966
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,893
No, and listen,
I want you to know,

1967
01:28:17,926 --> 01:28:21,930
despite my appearance at
this function, I remain now,

1968
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:24,733
and will always
be, a Duck Man.

1969
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,373
(giggles)

1970
01:28:30,406 --> 01:28:31,840
May I admire you?

1971
01:28:31,874 --> 01:28:34,910
Oh, uh, if, if you wish.

1972
01:28:38,614 --> 01:28:40,048
Let's plow.

1973
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,586
*

1974
01:28:43,619 --> 01:28:45,120
* Oh-oh-oh

1975
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,823
* Oh-oh-oh

1976
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:49,592
* Oh-oh-oh

1977
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:51,594
* Oh-oh-oh

1978
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:53,596
* Oh-oh-oh

1979
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:55,931
* Oh-oh-oh

1980
01:28:55,964 --> 01:28:57,500
* Oh-oh-oh

1981
01:28:57,533 --> 01:28:59,468
* Oh-oh-oh

1982
01:28:59,502 --> 01:29:03,071
* I need you now
like I needed you then *

1983
01:29:03,105 --> 01:29:08,511
* You always said we'd still
be friends someday *

1984
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,081
* If you leave, I won't cry

1985
01:29:13,115 --> 01:29:19,555
* I won't waste one single day

1986
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:22,425
* But if you leave,
don't look back *

1987
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:24,527
Should we dance?

1988
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:27,563
It wouldn't be unheard of.

1989
01:29:27,596 --> 01:29:30,899
* Seven years
went under the bridge *

1990
01:29:30,933 --> 01:29:32,568
* Like time standing still...

1991
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:35,438
A little, uh, lingering
doubt perhaps, pal?

1992
01:29:35,471 --> 01:29:37,005
You know, you gotta
give her credit, though.

1993
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:38,607
I mean, after
you dumped her,

1994
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:40,743
she certainly went out
and found herself what

1995
01:29:40,776 --> 01:29:43,011
I'd have to say is
probably the most

1996
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:44,713
interesting date that
her generation...

1997
01:29:44,747 --> 01:29:46,949
Steff.

1998
01:29:48,517 --> 01:29:49,852
You buy everything, Steff.

1999
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,454
You couldn't buy her, though.

2000
01:29:51,487 --> 01:29:52,888
That's what's killing
you, isn't it?

2001
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:54,590
Steff.
I don't want to
listen to this.

2002
01:29:54,623 --> 01:29:56,559
That's it, Steff.

2003
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,828
She thinks you're shit.

2004
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:03,432
And deep down,
you know she's right.

2005
01:30:18,647 --> 01:30:19,615
Hi.

2006
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:22,585
Hi.

2007
01:30:35,197 --> 01:30:37,633
You don't need me
to say I'm sorry.

2008
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:41,570
It's done. It's over with.
I'm fine.

2009
01:30:41,604 --> 01:30:43,572
* You always said...

2010
01:30:43,606 --> 01:30:45,207
Oh, well, if that's true,
then I'm glad.

2011
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,910
* ...we'd meet again

2012
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,646
* Someday

2013
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:54,182
It's not true.

2014
01:30:54,216 --> 01:30:56,018
It doesn't matter, does it?

2015
01:30:58,153 --> 01:30:59,955
You told me you couldn't believe
in somebody

2016
01:30:59,988 --> 01:31:02,157
who didn't believe in you;
I believed in you.

2017
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:05,794
Always believed in you.

2018
01:31:05,828 --> 01:31:07,496
Just didn't believe in me.

2019
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:14,269
I love you.

2020
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:18,641
* I need you now
like I needed you then *

2021
01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:21,544
* You always said
we'd meet again *

2022
01:31:21,577 --> 01:31:22,611
Always.

2023
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:32,721
Andie.

2024
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:36,158
He came here alone.

2025
01:31:40,128 --> 01:31:42,197
Okay, you're right.

2026
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,799
He's not like the others.

2027
01:31:48,704 --> 01:31:49,905
If you don't go to him now,

2028
01:31:49,938 --> 01:31:51,106
I'm never gonna take you

2029
01:31:51,139 --> 01:31:54,309
to another prom ever
again, you hear me?

2030
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,044
I mean, this is
an incredibly romantic moment

2031
01:31:56,078 --> 01:31:57,913
and you're ruining it for me.

2032
01:31:57,946 --> 01:32:03,251
* I touch you twice,
I won't let go at any price *

2033
01:32:03,285 --> 01:32:04,587
Thanks, Duckie.

2034
01:32:06,989 --> 01:32:08,190
Go ahead.

2035
01:32:08,223 --> 01:32:14,162
* We'd meet again someday...

2036
01:32:43,859 --> 01:32:44,793
Blane?

2037
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:48,931
* Oh-oh-oh

2038
01:32:48,964 --> 01:32:50,633
* Oh-oh-oh

2039
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:52,935
* Oh-oh-oh

2040
01:32:52,968 --> 01:32:55,037
* Oh-oh-oh

2041
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,672
* Oh-oh-oh

2042
01:32:56,705 --> 01:32:58,907
* Oh-oh-oh

2043
01:32:58,941 --> 01:33:03,011
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

2044
01:33:03,045 --> 01:33:04,279
* If you leave

2045
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:08,684
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

2046
01:33:08,717 --> 01:33:09,685
* Oh-oh-oh

2047
01:33:09,718 --> 01:33:12,855
* Oh, if you leave

2048
01:33:12,888 --> 01:33:16,925
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

2049
01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:21,296
* Oh, if you leave...

* Caroline laughs
and it's raining all day *

2053
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:02,437
* She loves to be
one of the girls *

2054
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:06,374
* She lives in the place
in the side of our lives *

2055
01:34:06,408 --> 01:34:09,444
* Where nothing
is ever put straight *

2056
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:13,381
* She turns herself round
and she smiles and she says *

2057
01:34:13,415 --> 01:34:17,452
* "This is it,
that's the end of the joke" *

2058
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:20,923
* And loses herself
in her dreaming and sleep *

2059
01:34:20,956 --> 01:34:24,092

through in their cloaks *

2060

2061

pretty in pink? *

2062
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,474
* Isn't she?

2063
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:42,477
* All of her lovers
all talk of her notes *

2064
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:46,048
* And the flowers
that they never sent *

2065
01:34:46,081 --> 01:34:51,954
* And wasn't she easy?

2066
01:34:51,987 --> 01:34:55,490
* Isn't she pretty in pink?

2067
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:58,894
* The one who insists
he was first in the line *

2068
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:02,798
* Is the last
to remember her name *

2069
01:35:02,831 --> 01:35:06,068

in this dress that she wore *

2070
01:35:06,101 --> 01:35:09,872
* She is gone,
but the joke's the same *

2071
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:14,076
* Pretty in pink

2072
01:35:14,109 --> 01:35:17,813
* Isn't she...

2073
01:35:17,846 --> 01:35:20,448
* Pretty in pink?

2074
01:35:20,482 --> 01:35:23,318

2075
01:35:37,499 --> 01:35:40,202
* All the favorite rags
are worn *

2076
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:42,470
* And other kinds of uniform

2077
01:35:42,504 --> 01:35:47,509
* But kid, you're already free
like individuality *

2078

to be until tomorrow. *
