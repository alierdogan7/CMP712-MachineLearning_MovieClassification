you had one in 15 minutes.

- You're stupid.

Well, uh, uh... I was saying

00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,893
that maybe we could
just help each other,

00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,327
Hmm.

00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,664
I really don't need your help,

417
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,249
but if I did, you would be

418
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,043

I would turn to.

419
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,795

back in the classroom

00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,759
Now they are spending
the day with you.

00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,011
God. I am going
to be so late.

Those aren't toys.

00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,602
Mom. It's just
a phone. Mom!

00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,021
Don't be like that

430
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,237
She just drops off, uh,

431
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,116
a bag of cookies and tells me
to keep them for a week.

432
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,702
And how do you feel
about the cookies, Jack?

433
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,912
Love the cookies.

434
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,623
I have a big problem
with the, uh...

435
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,875
Cookie maker?

436
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,293
That's right.

437
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,171
Because the cookie maker
thinks that all I am interested in

438
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,799
or all that I am
capable of handling,

439
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,760
uh, with respect to
the cookie question,

440
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,720
is the...

441
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,597
- The frosting?
- The...

442
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,974
Exactly.

443
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,860
Now, just because the frosting
is my specialty

444
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,854
doesn't mean
that I can't do more.

445
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,231
I have many layers to me,

446
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,691
and they're not
all vanilla, either.

447
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,944
I have chocolate in me.

448
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,737
I have a deep,
dark chocolate...

449
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,405
I'm still hungry, Daddy.

450
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,866
Uh, don't...
I'm so...

451
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,159
Doc Martin and I are finishing.

452
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,536
But what about the cookies?

453
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,912
Just a little while. Okay?

454
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,584
Uh, it's just...
I... I am...

455
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,504
I'm sick of angry,
resentful... Uh...

456
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,216
Fish

457
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,134
who, uh, think that you

458
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,262
that, that, that you owe them,

459
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,806
but who won't trust you
for a second

460
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,932
to do anything for them.

461
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,496
There are other fish
in the sea, Jack.

462
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,435
Yes. I know. It's just I...

463
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,354
I wish I could find a fish

464
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,606
who wasn't afraid of
my dark chocolate layer.

465
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,442
And, well, she'd have
to love my cookie, too.

466
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,194
You know, I think, I think

467
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,905
that my ex cookie maker

468
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,700
has turned me off
to fish entirely.

469
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,829
I met a real piece
of work this morning.

470
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,747
Tell me about her, Jack.

471
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,584
This fish was a fox.

472
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,419
She had her own cookie, too.

473
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,462
But what a female dog.

474
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,507
She shoved her fish in my face.

475
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,092
In front of the cookie?

476
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,137
What's she doing with
another fish, anyway?

477
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,638
Is she AC/DC?

478
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,683
What're you talking about?

479
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,145
Fish with other fish
in front of cookies.

480
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,522

- After you. I insist.
- No, after you.

487
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,337

Ohh!

492
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,684
Don't touch that.

spilling anything right now.

Why not?

499
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,532
Because I want you
to practice being super-quiet.

500
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,078
Okay, now, you stay next to me.

501
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,580

Don't you start any noises, okay?

502
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,584

(WHISPERS)

504
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,380
You're kidding.

505
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,506
Just 5 minutes.

506
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,216
Please don't give me
a hard time now, Evelyn.

507
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm 20 minutes late.

508
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,344
25 minutes late.
Mr. Leland,

509
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,789
as you might expect,
is displeased.

510
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,972
What are those?

511
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,181
The Haskell blueprints.

512
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,809
Rob Wilding got them in
3 weeks ahead of schedule.

513
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:51,977
He did?

514
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,312
Why would you bring
a child here?

515
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,815
Remember when Sally Hanson
brought her kid here

516
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,149
with the poison sumac?

517
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,485
Mr. Leland just smelled
the calamine lotion

518
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,778
and had to take
the rest of the day off.

519
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,613
He does not have
poison anything, Evelyn.

520
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,698
He's not even sick.

521
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,408
He just missed
his field trip is all.

522
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,742
I don't think so.

523
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,911
5 minutes. Please?

524
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,788
And I would be doing this because?

525
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,916
Of our sense of solidarity?

526
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,127
You know, we're both women,

527
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,461
and this is a tough office

528
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,907
- and a tough world...
- 5 minutes.

529
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,423
- Thank you.
- MR. LELAND: Evelyn.

530
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,133
Has Ms. Parker come in yet?

531
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,428
Ms. Parker, you're late.

532
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,555
Yes. I'm late. I know.
I'm sorry, sir.

533
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,681
You're late.

534
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,641
Let me go get the model.
I'll be right in.

run around, okay?

715
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,355
It won't be perfect.

716
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,857
I'm thirsty, Mommy.

717
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,525
It's okay.

718
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,444
I know you, Mel.

719
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,320
You won't be happy
with less than perfect.

720
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,114
Today I will.

721
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,283
I can't get
the straw part, Mommy.

00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,202
I don't want to think about
what'll happen to my life

724
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,079
if I don't have
that model by 2:00.

726
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,331
I'll give it a try.

727

JACK: Now, while
I'm doing my column,

730
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,966
you need to think of
about 600 fun things to do,

731
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,551
'cause the rest
of the day is yours.

- Uh-huh.

733
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,389
I wanna go to the zoo,
and I wanna go for a carriage ride

734
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,891
and to the carousel

735
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,767

- Hey.

- Mine, oh mine
- Yeah yeah

Hi, Jack.

I never knew
you had a daughter.

Yeah.
This is Maggie.

She's so cute.
She looks just like you.

744
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,326
She'll grow out of it.

745
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,578
Why are all the girls
talking to you like that?

746
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,288
What are you talking about?
Like what?

00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,290
I won't tell you why.

You look cranky.

You back on that diet again?

other for a long time.

this morning.

that I wasn't first?

Okay.

787
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,531
Who told you
that the mayor's re-election campaign

788
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,283
were taking illegal contributions
from the mob?

789

Manny Feldstein.

790
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,287
Manny Feldstein told you,
on the record,

791
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,746
that the Newark-based trucking company

792
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,915
of Grace & Marr,
a well-known mob front,

793
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,280
has made an illegal contribution

794
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,835
to Mayor Aikens re-election campaign.

795
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,128
That's right.
On the record.

796
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,880
In exchange for receiving
the city's sanitation contract.

797
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,048
On the record.

798
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,216
Which were awarded without bidding.

799
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,927
- Through Grace & Marr.
- Right. On the record.

800
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,596
Manny Feldstein's going to say

801
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,347
he never talked to you!

802
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,017
What? What? Hey.

803
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,741
During the mayor's
press conference today,

804
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,105
Manny Feldstein's going to say
you made the whole thing up.

805
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,273
You didn't make it up,
did you, Jack?

806
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,357
Of course not, Lew.

807
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,735
Manny told me
that he saw the campaign accounts.

808
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:26,902
There was $250,000...

809

Deposited in unnumbered accounts.

- Freddy, here.
- Unnumbered.

812

We may have to print
a retraction.

813
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,493
- Of what?
- Get back in there.

814
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,370
You're going to give me an ulcer.
I can feel it.

815
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,164
It's like I swallowed
a car battery.

816
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,332
Why couldn't you get 2 sources?

817
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,856
Remember the Cardinal O'Brien story?

818
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,418
Know how close we came
to getting fired on that?

819
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,836

00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,382
LEW: It's real simple, Jack.

822
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,926
Management doesn't want
to clean up after you...

823
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:51,969
Not now!

824
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,304
I'm a good reporter, Lew.

825
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,472
No.

826
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,599
You are a great reporter,

827
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,225
but sometimes you
just get too excited,

828
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,435
and then you get me
too excited.

829
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,937
And now I've given you
enough rope to hang us both.

830
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,398
And, Jack, nobody almost
gets a Pulitzer prize.

831
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,564
- WOMAN: Jack...
- One second.

832
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,567
They're not going to fire me.

833
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:07,943
My pictures are on buses.

834
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,236
LEW: That's what I said.
Then they asked me

835
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,721
to have lunch with Frank Burroughs.

836
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,781
Um, Dad...

837
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,865
Frank Burroughs?

838
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,742
"Frankly Speaking" is
a very popular column.

839
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,826
Hey, Dad?

840
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,953
Frank Burroughs is a pompous, arrogant,
humorless asshole.

00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,622
Who's won the Pulitzer prize.

842
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,457
You know something, Lew?

843
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,958
I'm not going to lose
my job, all right?

844
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,168
I got alimony and shrink bills,

845
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,420
- I got college loans to repay...
- Daddy...

846
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,256
One second.
I have a plumbing situation.

847
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,967
Now, Manny has been my guy
all year long...

848
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,010
One second, darling.

849
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,345
I played bridge
with his mother.

850
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,972
I took his niece
to Cirque de Soleil...

851
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,015
Just one second.

852
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,975
I had to sit through
him playing Tevye

853
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,020
in dinner theater,
Lew. Dinner theater!

854
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,731
Jack, I gave you this column,

855
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,108
and I love you like a son,

856
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,651
but I can't cover for you anymore.

857
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,152
Now, you've got
less than 6 hours

858
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,029
to that press conference
and no other leads.

859
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,989
We've gotta get Feldstein
back on the record

860
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,658
or find another reliable source

861
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,201
to confirm this whole goddamn thing.

862
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,120
Otherwise, we're printing a retraction.

863
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,664
And I guarantee you, Jack,
it'll be your last.

864
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,499
Fine. If you need me,

865
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,209
I'm at a different
number today.

866
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,502
LEW: Now where you going?

867
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,003
To find Manny.

868
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,505
LEW: Take care of yourself, kid.

869
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,382
Oh, I will.

870
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,466
- Hi. Jack?
- Yeah?

871
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,843
Listen, um...

872
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,511
I really wanted
to say something.

873
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,595
Go ahead.

874
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,013
I've noticed that

875
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,515
you haven't dated
for quite a while.

876
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,599
Right.

877
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,805
Actually, we've all noticed.

879
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,103
Hey, there we go.

880
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,438
- Hi.
- Hi.

881
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,232
I know

882
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,859
that you're sensitive,

883
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,527
but frightened.

884
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,737
I'm gentle,

but brutal.

887
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,367
Think about it.

888
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:39,910
Think about me, Jack.

889

(BREATHING HARD)

890
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,663
I will.

891
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,915

between the 4 and the 5,

- that's 4:30.
- I'm sorry.

And then I almost lost my mind

1005
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,329

a bag like that?

give you any more trouble,

1009

call me on the mobile.

It's hard enough being a kid.

00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,911

- What about?
- Nothing.

1020
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,665
Know what my mother
used to say to me?

he'll grow into a man."

that you were gay?

1026
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,842
- I'm not gay.
- Then why did she advise you

on how guys wanna be loved?

00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,387

I'd meet a woman like that someday.

talking about?

You're blaming your Peter Pan complex
on your mother.

- What Peter Pan complex?
- The one you're so proud of.

- You got any friends?
- I don't have time.

1036
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,820
That's because of
your Captain Hook complex.

1037

My what?

1038
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,866
- Captain Hook complex.
- There's no such thing.

Good-bye.

1244
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:58,291
Sammy, how long have your
mom and dad been divorced?

1245
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,376
I don't know.

1246
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,627
It doesn't matter, really,

1247
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,337
'cause she said
she'll always love him.

1248
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,922
- Yeah? Hey, what's that?
- Marble.

1249
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,340
That's a marble.
That's what that is.

1250
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,675
You get to see your dad a lot?
Come here.

1251
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,718
Pretty much, usually.

1252
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,887
He has a different schedule
than a lot of other dads.

1253
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:11,930
He's a drummer.

1254
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,432
His favorite thing to do
is watch me play soccer.

1255
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,518
He's probably coming today,

1256
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,603
and he's taking me fishing
this whole summer,

1257
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:21,231
just us,
and maybe Mom will come, too.

1258
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,483
- Your dad's a drummer, huh?
- Yep.

1259
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,402
- Sounds like a great guy, Sammy.
- He is.

1260
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,244
Kurt, Jake,
you remember Melanie Parker.

1261
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,412
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1262
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:36,830
Nice to see you.

1263
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,291
Well,

1264
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,667
voila.

1265
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,326
I love this.

1266
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,328
- This is... What is that?
- A vaulted...

1267
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,455
A vaulted pediment.
Vaulted pediment.

1268
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,040
- I love that.
- Yeah?

1269
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,794
But I need to see this with cars.

1270
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,881
You don't need cars, Dad.
Just use your imagination.

1271
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,257
My imagination?

1272
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,593
I have to see it with the cars.

1273
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,312
Cars.

1274
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:43,938
Ahem.

1275
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,440
See?

1276
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,241
She's quite a little discovery.

1277
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,910
Yes, she is.

1278
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:00,580
Why don't you join us
for drinks this evening?

1279
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,417
- Oh.
- Let's say 5:30 at the 21.

1280
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,379
I... Oh. I don't know if I can.

1281
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,089
We'll talk about this project.

1282
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,173
From what I've seen,

1283
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,697
you could bring
a great deal to this.

1284
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:19,933
I'll be there.

1285
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,685
Terrific.

1286
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,269
That's great.

1287
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,564
Hi. This is Jack Taylor
of the Daily News.

1288
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,525
- I'm looking for Elaine Lieberman...
- Quit trying to be like my dad.

1289
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,652
- Am not.
- Am, too. Daddy?

1290
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,695
Yeah?

1291
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,363
Who's that man on the bus?

1292
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,031
- What? Who's what?
- Who's that man?

1293
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,408
It says, "Frankly Speaking."

1294
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,702
Very important.
Elaine Lieberman.

1295
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:39,786
Here we go.

1296
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,954
Hold hands.
Hold hands.

1297
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:43,456
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa,

1298
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,625
could you just try
to speak English?

1299
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,086
Okay.

1300
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,797
- Hello?
- Hello?

1301
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,633
Right. Okay, all right, uh, uh, uh...
I need to...

1302
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:56,219
? Donde esta, Sefnora Lieberman?

1303
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,096
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1304
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,265
(CAR HORN HONKS, SIREN)
- Pronto.

1305
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,308
- Yeah. Wait, wait, wait.
- (SPEAKING SPANISH)

1306
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,102
- Okay.
- Okay?

1307
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,645
Okay. Bye-bye.

1308
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,480
No. No, no, no.

1309
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:08,648
Uh...

1310
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,483
(RINGING)

1311
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,527
Hola.
La casa de la Senora Lieberman.

1312
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,570
Listen to me. Listen.

1313
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,030
I need to find Mrs. Lieberman.

1314
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,699
- Okay.
- Okay.

1315
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,535
If I don't find her,
I could lose my job.

1316
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:23,371
If you don't understand,
say, "Okay."

1317
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:25,498
Okay.

1318
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,751
Okay. Bye-bye. Gracias.

1319
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:28,877
Bye-bye.

1320
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,589
Give me the marble.
It's my dad's.

1321
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,631
Give it!

1322
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:34,966
It's my dad's marble.

1323
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,801
Uh, no, uh, Rosa?

1324
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,512
Uh, no, Rosa, it's...

1325
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,681
No, no, no, no.
Don't hang up.

1326
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,510
- Do you speak Spanish by any chance?
- What do you need?

1327
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,519
Ok. Great.
Her name is Rosa Lopez.

1328
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,938
Her boss is Elaine Lieberman.

1329
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,273
I need to know where she is.

1330
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,316
I'm Jack Taylor.

1331
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,942
I'm a reporter for the Daily News.

1332
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,652
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1333
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:55,945
Elaine is her boss.

1334
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,864
No, no, no, no.

1335
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,117
Tell her Elaine wants to speak to me
very badly, too. Very badly.

1336
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,244
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1337
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,287
Jack Taylor.

1338
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,455
Jack Taylor...

1339
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,581
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1340
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,624
MAGGIE: So?

1341
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:08,708
SAMMY: So?

1342
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:09,793
MAGGIE: So give me it!

1343
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:10,919
- So?
- So, give it.

1344
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,462
- No.
- Yes!

1345
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,963
Guys, hey, guys. Guys!

1346
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,131
What are you doing?

1347
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,633
MAGGIE: Give me it.

1348
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,302
- Guys, what are you doing?
- Mr. Taylor.

1349
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,095
- Take turns.
- Mr. Taylor!

1350
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,306
Senora Lopez says
that Mrs. Lieberman

1351
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,891
is at the Elizabeth Arden salon

1352
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,726
for her spring spa day.

1353
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,019
Spring spa day?
Elizabeth Arden? Excellent.

1354
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,479
Dad! Hee hee hee.

1355
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,398
What?
You guys are being a...

1356
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,900
Oh, man.

1357
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,153
- You're so stupid.
- Am not.

1358
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,697
Are so.
You ruined my dad's marble.

1359
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,991
He's not gonna want it
with your snot all over it.

1360
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,244
Yes, I will.
I'll just wash it off.

1361
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,537
You're gonna be fine.

1362
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:46,996
The doctor's just gonna
pop that thing

1363
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,164
right out of there.

1364
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:49,833
How come you couldn't do it?

1365
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:50,917
Well, you know,

1366
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,001
that's a little nose,
big marble.

1367
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,044
But, see, the doctor,

1368
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,504
he's gonna have this clamp thing

1369
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,257
that's gonna come up and
just yank it right out,

1370
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,551
and you are gonna be fine.

1371
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:00,885
You've just gotta
not worry about it,

1372
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,554
and you've gotta
not think about it.

1373
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,264
You've gotta think
about something else.

1374
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,182
You've gotta think about...

1375
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:07,892
Hello, Sammy.

1376
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,576
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

1377
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,161
(YAWNING) Hello?

1378
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:29,539
Hi, sexy, I miss you.

1379
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,040
Look, whoever you are,

1380
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,043
this isn't Jack's phone anymore.

1381
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,546
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1382
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,172
No. Who are you?

1383
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:41,175
This is Celia.
I'm a friend of Jack's,

1384
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:42,719
and who's this?

1385
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,762
Absolutely nobody.

1386
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,556
Whatever.
Could you please tell him

1387
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,558
that Kristen just
called from the Bahamas

1388
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,226
- to let him know her number there?
- Uh-huh.

1389
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,728
And this is very important.

1390
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,187
Elaine Lieberman will only be

1391
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:55,189
at Elizabeth Arden's until 3:30.

1392
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,692
So if you could
pass on those messages,

1393
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,569
we'd both appreciate it.

1394
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:01,613
JACK: Your mom is gonna kill me

1395
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:02,697
if I don't have you guys
in the lobby

1396
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,741
by 3:15 on the dot.

1397
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,534
SAMMY: I don't think she'll kill ya.

1398
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:07,744
She's not like that, really.

1399
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:08,912
She isn't?

1400
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,538
No. She just acts tough and mean

1401
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:12,457
'cause she'd rather
be safe than sorry.

1402
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,625
What does that mean?

1403
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:14,792
She just says it a lot

1404
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,438
when men try to open
her door and stuff.

1405
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:17,754
Yeah?

1406
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,548
Whup! Excuse us!

1407
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:23,051
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

1408
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,559
- Hi.
- Hi, you guys!

1409
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,269
Hey, hey.

1410
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:36,731
Um, your friend, uh, Celia called

1411
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,107
to tell you... Sammy!

1412
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,442
It's okay, only an escalator.

1413
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,278
That Kristen called you
from the Bahamas

1414
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,447
and also that Elaine Lew...

1415
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,531
Lieberman.

1416
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,617
...will be at Elizabeth Arden's
until 3:30.

1417
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,743
Great.

1418
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,413
Thank you so much for
watching Sammy, really.

1419
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:53,957
You saved my life.

1420
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,041
Was he any trouble?

1421
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,459
No. Not at all.

1422
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,669
Good.

1423
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,338
So, everything worked out great.

1424
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,798
I was sure you were

1425
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,282
going to either
show up 3 hours late

1426
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:04,467
or not at all.

1427
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,970
Guess what?
I'm not like every other man you know.

1428
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,574
No. I realize that.
I was just kidding.

1429
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,598
No, you weren't, but...

1430
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:13,476
Guess what? I'm not like
every other woman you know.

1431
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,061
- Really?
- Yeah.

1432
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,398
You probably think
I'm a real control freak,

1433
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,108
and I'm not at all.

1434
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,651
Well, I mean, I do like things

1435
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,861
the way I like them,
but who doesn't?

1436
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,488
And, anyway, in my life,

1437
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,157
I'm the only one who ever
does anything, so, uh,

1438
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,325
what does it matter?

1439
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,368
Maybe you should let somebody

1440
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,203
help you out
every once in a while.

1441
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,122
Definitely not.

1442
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:36,165
I've got all of these little balls
up in the air,

1443
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,042
and if somebody else
caught one from me,

1444
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:39,377
I'd drop them all.

1445
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,160
But you're not a control freak.

1446
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,548
No. I'm a single working mother.

1447
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,008
Okay. I have more work to do

1448
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,092
than time to do it.

1449
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,094
So before you and I
get into yet another

1450
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,054
lengthy and exhausting thing,

1451
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,973
I have a career to save, okay?

1452
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,850
Do you have any instructions
for me before you...

1453
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,060
No, no.
I trust you completely.

1454
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:58,563
I don't suppose
you could, um...

1455
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,982
you could switch your thing

1456
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,775
from 5:00 to, say, 4:30?

1457
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,152
Because I just found out

1458
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,695
that I have a new thing at 5:30.

1459
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,863
Can't switch my thing.

1460
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,448
I'll switch mine.
No problem.

1461
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,158
See you guys
at the soccer game?

1462
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,160
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye, Jack!

1463
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,787
Thanks again, Jack.

1464
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,164
You're welcome.

1465
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,251
I realize it's difficult,

1466
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:24,047
what with, uh...
Celia, Kristen, Elaine.

1467
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,632
I know your name, Mel.

1468
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,134
So what did you guys
do with Jack?

1469
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:11,469
Quit kicking me, Maggie.

1470
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,222
I wasn't going to say
anything about. (SNIFFS)

1471
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,015
About what?

1472
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,266
Nothing.

1473
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,434
It's a secret.

1474
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:19,894
We're not supposed to say.

1475
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,146
Secret about what?

1476
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:23,439
About your dad?

1477
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:25,108
And you, too, Mommy.

1478
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,693
Me, too?

1479
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,195
Come on, you guys.

1480
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,321
Tell.

1481
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,118
Secret about me and Jack.

1482
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,244
Hmm.

1483
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,497
Does it have anything
to do with feelings?

1484
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:41,999
What do you mean?

1485
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,835
You know, feelings,
like being scared

1486
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:48,214
or hurt or happy and excited.

1487
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,883
You know,
those are all feelings.

1488
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,136
Definitely about feelings, then.

1489
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,138
Yeah. Definitely.

1490
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,264
Hee hee.

1491
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,558
Switch.

1492
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,686
Mm-hmm.

1493
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,772
Sorry, Mom.

1494
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:06,440
That's okay, honey.

1495
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,322
So, what'd you get?

1496
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,158
Frozen hot chocolate.

1497
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,826
Mmm! Yum.

1498
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,077
You like chocolate?

1499
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,453
I love chocolate.

1500
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,038
Daddy told Dr. Martin this morning

1501
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,624
that he's got deep dark chocolate
inside of him.

1502
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,501
Really?

1503
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,919
MAGGIE: And that
he'd like to meet a fish

1504
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,797
who wasn't afraid
of his dark chocolate layer.

1505
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,551
I think I'm beginning
to guess the secret.

1506
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,511
Are you mad?

1507
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:36,637
Not really.

1508
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,056
I think he should have
talked about it with me, though.

1509
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:41,267
He was afraid you'd hate him.

1510
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,686
Of course I wouldn't hate him.

1511
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,730
Honestly, that is so silly.

1512
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:47,607
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1513
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,152
Uh, you don't understand.
This is an emergency.

1514
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,362
I don't interrupt Mrs. Lieberman

1515
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:55,031
during her bikini wax.

1516
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,073
Now, listen...

1517
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,534
Don't bother with the cute face.

1518
00:58:58,619 --> 00:58:59,827
I have five sons.

1519
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:01,370
You make eyes at me like that,

1520
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,705
I make you pot roast.

1521
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,415
Oh, excuse me.

Hello, Mrs. Keffner.
Let me get your robe.

Good-bye, Mrs. Lieberman.

1524
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,550
- Next week.
- Yes, indeed.

1525
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,344
Down, please.

No? Okay.

- Hi.
- Hey, hi.

00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,489
Hi, hi, hi.

1530
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,157
Hey, uh, is Mrs. Lieberman,

1531
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,201
Elaine Lieberman in here
by any chance?

1532
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,370
Hey, it's okay.
I'm sorry.

1533
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,873
Hi. I'm looking
for Elaine Lieberman.

1534
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,167
- She just left.
- JACK: Thank you.

1535
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,543
- Jack!
- Yep?

1536
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,045
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

1537
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,631
- It's Rita!
- Who?

1538
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,216
Melanie's mother.

1539
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,218
Oh, Rita. Hey!

1540
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,302
Do you... Sorry.

1541
00:59:58,387 --> 00:59:59,971
Do you believe
what a small world?

1542
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,305
I know.
I just spent the whole afternoon

1543
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,473
with your grandson.

1544
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,350
Yeah.
He's cute, but he's a handful.

1545
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,601
I'm just trying to catch up
with Elaine Lieberman.

1546
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:06,769
I just want to tell you one thing

1547
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:07,853
about my daughter,

1548
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,272
and it's something
that you may suspect.

1549
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,596
She can make you want to scream

1550
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,691
like you're having a body wax.

1551
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:12,858
I mean, she's that frustrating.

1552
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:13,943
Yeah.

1553
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,987
Inside, Jack, she's mush.

1554
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,113
Mush.

1555
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,240
So you scream all you want,

1556
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,158
but just don't
run away too soon.

01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,785

of a difficult question.

about his business affairs.

Are you referring
to the illegal account?

1575
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:56,652
So you know about that?

1576
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,321
- It's in his name.
- Yeah.

Hi, kitties.
How are you?

01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,260
Tag. You're it.
Come on. Chase me.

1770
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,013
No, Daddy.
I want to play with the kitties.

Come on.

1772

Stop it!

1773
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:27,394
Come on. Let's go.
Don't do this right now.

If I don't get there...
Want me to lose my job?

1775
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:31,607
No, stop it!

1776
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:32,891
Do you want me to lose my job?

Okay. So what
are their names?

'cause he looks like a bobcat.

I forget this one's name.

Well, okay.
Listen, Maggie,

01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:18,320
I know this has been
a rotten day for you.

What if we talk to
this beautiful young lady

1801
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,676
and we ask her
if maybe Bob can come

1802

to the press conference with us?

01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:44,847

But I want to keep him.

Bob can just stay at my house.

Where would he sleep?

1813
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:09,496
You know that room
with all the boxes in it?

1814
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:11,582
We could clear those out.
He could sleep in there.

01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,607

Uh, I know Jack Taylor, sir,

cocky most of the time,

you have with Mr. Taylor, miss,

you know nothing about politics

to buffalo my paper

in the outfit,

01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,478
just pitiful!

1899
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,772
What is pitiful, Mr. Mayor,

1900
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:23,648
is that if I had
a few minutes more,

1901
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,108
Elaine Lieberman would be here

1902
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:28,570
with a canceled check
for $250,000

1903
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,906
from a very well-known mob front

1904
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,824
made out to your re-election campaign.

1905
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,911
That's a blatant fabrication,
Mr. Taylor!

1906
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:38,580
We both know that no such
canceled check exists.

1907
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,582
You know something?
You're right. I'm confused.

1908
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,459
There would be no check,

1909
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,419
but there would be a deposit slip,

1910
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:45,962

This is dated March 15th
of this year.

01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:56,306
It is a deposit slip for $250,000.

a deposit was made

01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,145
for $250,000,

1919
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,774

just a coincidence.

- All right. Come on. Let's go.

that you've done this?

01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,336
My husband.

to the soccer game now?

about Maggie.

about what could've happened.

about it either.

01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:43,728
When I do think about it,

1941
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,397
I can't believe that
I was issued shellfish

1942
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,316
and dander warnings,
sandbox alerts.

1943
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:49,484
You even laughed in my face

1944
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:51,987
- when I showed up at your office on time.
- I know.

1945
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:54,030
And then you lost my daughter.

1946
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,365
I know.
It was the worst thing

1947
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,075
I could've ever done.
I really am so, so very sorry.

1948
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,578
So someone else is
the irresponsible one,

1949
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,121
- aren't they?
- Yes, they are.

1950
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,873
I would like to hear you say that,

1951
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:04,249
say it for your kind.

1952
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,709
My kind?

1953
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:07,544
The ones with all the balls
in the air.

1954
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,254
That's the least you could do.

1955
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,755
Of course I'll say it, Jack.

1956
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:13,008
I was the irresponsible one.

1957
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:14,342
- Great.
- Taxi!

1958
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,094
Now say
"I can't do everything on my own."

1959
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:17,179
Why?

1960
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,263
Because with one sentence

1961
01:15:18,306 --> 01:15:21,016
you'll restore my faith
in women again.

1962
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:24,436
Of course I'll say it
for you, Jack.

1963
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,896
We're never going
to get a cab, you know.

1964
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,189
You can't say it.

1965
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:28,876
Sure, I can,
just as long as you realize

1966
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:29,983
that it won't be true.

1967
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,027
I'm waiting.

1968
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,445
Okay. I can't do
everything alone.

1969
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,779
There. Great.

1970
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,948
Even though my daily activities
year after year

1971
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,450
immediately contradict
what I just said.

1972
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,493
Oh, unbelievable!

1973
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,120
You made me grovel for no reason.

1974
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,580
You groveled for great reason.

1975
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,166
You are an arrogant ball juggler, baby.

1976
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,002
First of all,
don't call me baby.

1977
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,463
Secondly, if you don't
want your balls juggled,

1978
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,547
don't throw them in my face.

1979
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:53,673
I threw them in your face?

1980
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,278
Yes, you did,
starting off this morning

1981
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,052
when you thrust
your stupid column at me

1982
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:58,261
as some sort of lame excuse

1983
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:00,222
for my son missing his field trip.

1984
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,140
Balls in my face.

1985
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,184
Ho ho ho!
Big Jack reporter

1986
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,853
can't possibly concentrate
on mundane details

1987
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:08,647
like picking up the phone to say,

1988
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,565
"Thanks anyway,
but I won't be needing you

1989
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,400
"to take my daughter
to school today and then..."

1990
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,485
That's not quite how it happened.

1991
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,487
You have to ask
who I can only assume

1992
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:17,113
is one of your many girlfriends

1993
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:18,782
if she's wearing her panties

1994
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:21,952
as loud as you can.
Balls in my face.

1995
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:24,746
And now in the midst
of my obvious remorse,

1996
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,373
you make me grovel?

1997
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:27,999
First of all... First of all,

1998
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,501
I thrust my column in your face

1999
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,461
because I thought
you were the most beautiful woman

2000
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,630
that I've ever seen
in my entire life,

2001
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,382
and I want...

2002
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:41,263
I wanted to make a good impression.

2003
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,185
Now, I forgot to
call you this morning

2004
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,437
because I, as opposed to you,

2005
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,314
am not used to doing
everything on my own.

2006
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:52,440
So I slipped up there.

2007
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:53,566
As for the panties,

2008
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:56,111
that remark was to my editor Lew,

2009
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:59,030
simply to piss you off.

2010
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,681
MAGGIE: Come on, Dad.
I've got a taxi.

2011
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:05,203
Can we go?

2012
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:11,209
Hey. We got the cab.

2013
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,505
(HORN HONKS)

2014
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:17,716
I think my dad likes your mom.

2015
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,759
Maybe my mom likes him back.

2016
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:20,885
Men like you

2017
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,095
have made me the woman I am.

2018
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,972
All the women I know like you

2019
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,058
have made me think
all women are like you.

2020
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,810
Oh, my God.
I almost forgot.

2021
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,396
I've got a meeting,
drinks with clients.

2022
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,940
5:25. You're never
going to make it.

2023
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:36,693
Mom, it's the last game
of the season.

2024
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,611
It's for the championship, Mom,

2025
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,739
and the coach said
every kid has to play

2026
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,532
or they don't get a trophy.

2027
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,367
Even the losers get a trophy,

2028
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,745
but you don't get a trophy
if you don't play.

2029
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,279
It's on the way.
We'll make it.

2030
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,206
Let go of it.

2031
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:54,419
I can't let go of it.
It's my job. Hold this.

2032
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:58,715
MELANIE: Could we go
to the 21 Club instead?

2033
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,425
21 West 52nd Street,

2034
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:04,721
and don't try to take 14th
or 32nd or 44th across.

2035
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:08,266
You can't make a left
at this hour.

2036
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,895
I...I... I know I can do this.

2037
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,356
No, don't take Broadway.

2038
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,815
It's bound to be a mess.

2039
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,859
Try 6th Avenue,

2040
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,402
but not until after 23rd

2041
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:21,154
because of the construction.

2042
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,531
JACK: French-fried eyeballs
floating in a bowl of...

2043
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,909
MAGGIE: Snot.
JACK: Snot.

2044
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,651
JACK: Here we go.

2045
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,612
Uh, why don't you hold the cab,

2046
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,280
and if I'm not
back in 15 minutes,

2047
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,907
just go on ahead without me.

2048
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,325
You're going to take longer
than 15 minutes.

2049
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,828
I can do this.
Okay, baby.

2050
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:13,123
Mommy, what if you don't come

2051
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,666
and Daddy doesn't come?

2052
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,918
Oh, sweetheart,
I'm going to be there.

2053
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,294
You are the most
important thing to me

2054
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:19,838
in the entire world.

2055
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,548
Your job is.

2056
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:23,550
No, you are,

2057
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,553
but I have to do this now.

2058
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,430
Sammy, I know I've
dragged you places

2059
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:29,514
and left you places,

2060
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,224
and I've been
a crazy person today,

2061
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,976
but it's going
to be better tomorrow.

2062
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,145
I promise I won't take
longer than 15 minutes

2063
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:38,148
in there, okay? Okay? Huh?

2064
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,612
Hey, Sammy, come here.

2065
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,531
Don't worry about it.
She'll make it, okay?

2066
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:47,855
Let's get you ready for soccer.

2067
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,367
Grab me that bag.

2068
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,581
Hello.
How are you?

2069
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,583
Hi. I see my party.

2070
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,877
MR. LELAND: Oh, here she is.

2071
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:01,337
I'm glad you could make it.
What's your poison?

2072
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:02,464
Oh, I'll just have some water.

2073
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,257
Nonsense.
We're way ahead of you.

2074
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,800
You have some catching up to do.

2075
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,221
MR. LELAND: She'll have a dry
vodka martini straight up.

2076
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:17,604
Hey, what are you
thinking about, kiddo?

2077
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:22,150
I hope my daddy can come
to our soccer game.

2078
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,318
Yeah.

2079
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:24,444
(MEOW)

2080
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:28,156
Mommy hopes he can come, too.

2081
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,240
Last night...

2082
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:31,951
Last night

2083
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,328
my mom thought I was asleep,

2084
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:34,704
but I really wasn't

2085
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,207
and I heard her say
over and over again,

2086
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,416
"Please let Eddie come.

2087
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:41,044
"Please let Eddie come."

2088
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:43,129
(MEOW)

2089
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:44,631
Eddie?
Who's Eddie?

2090
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:46,466
Eddie's my dad.

2091
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:51,262
I hope he comes, too,
there, kiddo.

2092
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:52,764
We were just discussing plans

2093
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,182
for a sort of upscale

2094
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,017
amusement complex for adults.

2095
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,645
You know, with food
and games and rides.

2096
01:20:58,729 --> 01:20:59,771
No rides, Dad.

2097
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:00,855
After drinks,

2098
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,732
we wanted to take
a drive to Stanford.

2099
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:03,983
SON: We were hoping
to take a look

2100
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,402
at a kind of a bad version
of what we have in mind.

2101
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,321
But before we head out,

2102
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,156
Melanie, maybe you could toss out

2103
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,116
a few ideas,
just off the top of your head.

2104
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,452
Uh...

2105
01:21:15,246 --> 01:21:17,372
Well, uh,

2106
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,708
adult amusement complexes,
up until now,

2107
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,502
have been somewhat cheesy,

2108
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:26,297
usually attached
to popular video stores.

2109
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:30,051
What I'm thinking of
is something

2110
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,344
a bit more exciting.

2111
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,428
YATES SR.: Hmm.

2112
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,472
A drawing might help,
don't you think?

2113
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,308
Uh... I...

2114
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,557
YATES JR.: I love drawings.

2115

Oh. Here you go.

Oh, okay.

2118
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:44,274

01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:48,152
Um, let's see.

01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:51,072
Uh, something like...

2121
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:53,700
Uh...

2122
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,829
Um...

2123
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,751
Isn't that the little lost boy

2124
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:04,919
from this morning?

2125
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:06,296
What?

2126
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:09,340
Uh, with, you know...

Um...

2128
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:32,238
You know, I can't do this now.

2129
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:37,702
And I can't go with you
to Stanford now either.

2130
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,330
Yes, Mr. Leland,
that is the little lost boy

2131
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:42,040
from this morning,
only he's not lost.

2132
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,166
He's my son.

2133
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,085
I have a child

2134
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:48,796
and he has a soccer game
in 20 minutes.

2135
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,442
If he's late,
he doesn't get the trophy.

2136
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:51,591
And because I'm in here with you,

2137
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,135
he's probably going to be late,

2138
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,762
but what gets to me
more than anything

2139
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,096
is instead of crying about it,

2140
01:22:57,181 --> 01:23:00,350
he's out there
with a big old smile

2141
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:02,060
blowing fish faces at us.

2142
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:08,483
Gentlemen, if you're smart,
you'll want me as much

2143
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,942
for my dedication and ability

2144
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:12,028
as for the fact that I am going
to ditch you right now

2145
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,447
and I am going to run
like hell across town

2146
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,451
so that my kid knows that
what matters to me most

2147
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:17,617
is him.

2148
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,119
And, Mr. Leland,
your real grounds for firing me

2149
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:23,164
should be if I were
to stay here with you.

2150
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:29,128
I like her.

2151
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:30,254

2152
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,968
Well, I probably lost my job,

2153
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:37,845
but at least we still have 10 minutes

2154
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:38,971
to get to the game.

2155
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,807
Hey, short cut!
Short cut!

2156
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,100
In spite of everything, Jack,

2157
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:45,269
I want you to know that
I do sincerely apologize

2158
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:46,354
for losing Maggie.

2159
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,690
That's all right.
Same thing happened to me this morning.

2160
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,566
You lost Maggie this morning?

2161
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:52,985
Yeah, she wandered off
after the office cat.

2162
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,320
It might've been helpful

2163
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,864
if you'd mentioned
her tendency to wander.

2164
01:23:56,949 --> 01:24:00,076
It might've been helpful...
Here we go. Up here...

Sammy's tendency

to stick things up his nose.

2167

He didn't!

Oh, yeah. Way up there.

2169
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,461

this plier-type thing.

we'd make it.

Sorry, Sammy.

Lois Lane?

2180

Come on.
We got to hurry up.

2181
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:41,409
I got to go to the bathroom.

2182
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:42,702
I'll take you.

01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,454
Why don't I take her?

So, Maggie,
you know that lady Celia

No way.

01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:11,822
Let me see your trophy.

2290
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:19,747
Wow!

2291
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:20,998
You think that's real gold?

2292
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,083
Yeah.

2293
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:24,418
You do?
What is that on his head?

2294
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:25,544
Soccer ball.

2295
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:26,670
Oh.

2296
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,346
Okay, you ready? Argh.

2297
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:43,604
Should we try
to get a cab, Mom?

2298
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,439
No. I kind of
feel like walking.

2299
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:46,524
In the rain?

2300
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:49,068
What do you care?
You're dressed for Niagara Falls.

Good night.
Come here. Good night.

2316

Good night.

2317
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:50,838
He'll be right here
in the box, okay?

2318
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:52,840
- Okay.
- All right.

2319
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:53,966
You know, Daddy,

2320
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:56,051
when me and Melanie
were in the bathroom,

2321
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:58,470
she asked me if Celia
was your girlfriend.

2322
01:31:58,638 --> 01:31:59,638
She did?

2323
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:02,016
Yeah. She really likes you.

2324
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:03,893
Hmmph. Good night.

2325
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:04,977
Good night.

2326
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:10,107
She told you she likes me?

2327
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,359
It's so obvious, Daddy.

2328
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:13,527
Good night.

2329
01:32:13,612 --> 01:32:14,695
Hmm.

2330
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:17,781
Did she say
anything else about me?

2331
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:20,743
I don't know, Daddy.
I'm pretty tired.

2332
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:23,287
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

2333
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:26,123
Yeah.

2334
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:30,753
What are we gonna do
about those fish?

2335
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:31,879
What?

2336
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:33,255
We gotta go buy new fish.

2337
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,381
Now?

2338
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:37,468
Yeah. Now? Yeah. Sammy can't
go back to class tomorrow

2339
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,637
without those fish.
By noon, they'll kill him.

2340
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:40,721
But I'm in my pajamas.

2341
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:42,848
All we gotta do
is pick 'em out.

2342
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:46,727
And it shines like the sun

2343
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:52,983
At the end of the day

2344
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:57,154

Ohh!

01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:30,396
Aah!

- Hi.
- Hi.

2361
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:55,629
Maggie insisted
that we bring Sammy

2362
01:33:55,714 --> 01:33:57,214
some new fish.

2363
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:01,427
Thank you.

2364
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:04,888
Um... Do you guys...

2365
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:06,373
Do you want to come in
for a minute?

2366
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:09,184
No. We don't
want to intrude.

2367
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:12,438
Oh. Okay. Well...

2368
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:13,522
- Yes...
- Thanks.

2369
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:16,734
Here they are. Heh heh. Okay.

2370
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,652
Okay. Thank you.

2371
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:20,029
Come on, Dad.

2372
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:21,363
Uh...

2373
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,324
Come in. Please.

2374
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:26,243
Okay. A few minutes.

01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:28,579
Hi, Jack.

2376
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:32,624
Sammy. Hi. Unh.

2377
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,502
Unh. What do you weigh?

2378
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:36,670
Wanna come see my room?

2379
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:38,547
MAGGIE: Okay.

2380
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:40,090
Huh.

2381
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:46,764
You're investigating my apartment.

2382
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:48,515
Not as neat as I would've thought.

2383
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:50,684
It's only neat
on Sunday mornings

2384
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:52,311
when my mother
comes for brunch.

2385
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,479
If she sees it like this,

2386
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:55,356
she shakes her head,

2387
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,858
which means she's unhappy
with my life choices.

2388
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:00,944
And then she lets out
a sigh that means

2389
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:03,230
she would've rather have gone
to my sister's for brunch.

MAGGIE AND SAMMY: Yeah!

How about The Wizard of Oz?

2395
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:16,919
Yeah!

2396
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:20,047
You can get all
snuggled up on my bed

2397
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,299
and watch for a little while.

2398
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:26,011
I wanna watch
the whole thing, Mommy.

2399
01:35:26,096 --> 01:35:27,054
It's too late.

2400
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:29,556
You can watch for as long
as it takes us to drink

2401
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:30,641
one cup of coffee.

2402
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:32,267
Two cups of coffee.

2403
01:35:32,477 --> 01:35:33,685
We'll see.

(OVER THE RAINBOW PLAYS)

2405
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:42,236
It's always such a dilemma
when you have kids.

2406
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,071
(CHUCKLES)

2407
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,115
After Sammy's dad and I
got divorced,

2408
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:48,492
I put up pictures of him
all over Sammy's room.

2409
01:35:48,827 --> 01:35:50,107
I guess I wanted to reassure him

2410
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,078
that no matter what,

2411
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:52,996
his dad would still
be in his life.

2412
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:55,958
You want, uh, cream or...

2413
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:59,378
No, that's fine.
Sammy's very proud of his dad.

2414
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,783
He talked about him
all day today.

2415
01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:01,839
I'm sure he did.

2416
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:03,715
Is he really
a rock 'n' roll drummer?

2417
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,680
Yeah. He's touring with
Springsteen this summer.

2418
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:07,928
- Really?
- Yeah.

2419
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,847
Springsteen?

2420
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:11,014
Wow.

2421
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:17,438
I'm beating around the bush
here a little bit,

2422
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:19,042
and there's something
I got to ask you.

2423
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:20,566
Yes?

2424
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:22,359
Why did you

2425
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:25,571
spend the entire day
flirting with me if you

2426
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,406
were thinking about getting
back with your ex-husband?

2427
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:29,074
What?

2428
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:32,286
I spent the whole day
disliking you intensely.

2429
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,204
You were flirting with me.

2430
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,290
You even told the kids
you wanted to ask me out.

2431
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:37,458
I never told them that.

2432
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,751
Yes, you did.
That was your big secret.

2433
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:41,795
- Heh heh.
- They told me.

2434
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,922
It was all about you and me
and going somewhere

2435
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,007
and feelings.

2436
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:47,176
You were going to ask me out.

2437
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,803
Okay. The big secret was about
Sammy getting my marble

2438
01:36:49,888 --> 01:36:50,846
stuck up his nose,

2439
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,223
and I never once even thought
about asking you out.

2440
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:54,766
I am so sure.

2441
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:57,144
I don't know why
I would even want to.

2442
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:58,812
You said you thought I was
the most beautiful woman

2443
01:36:58,897 --> 01:36:59,855
you'd ever seen.

2444
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:02,191
- That was a line.
- That was not a line, Jack,

2445
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:04,193
and you know it.

2446
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:07,070
You wanted me ever since
I knew you were a writer, and you said...

2447
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,156
And you wanted me

2448
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,116
ever since the 9th Street
Drop-in Center

2449
01:37:11,201 --> 01:37:13,160
when you saw me
putting my watch on Maggie.

2450
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,203
For someone who is

2451
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:16,330
so totally disinterested
in the other person,

2452
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,207
you sure do remember
every single minute detail.

2453
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:20,292
You remember better than I do.

2454
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:21,376
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

2455
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:22,461
No, I don't.

2456
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:23,504
What would you do
if I kissed you right now?

2457
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:24,588
You're not gonna
kiss me right now.

2458
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,131
What would you do if I did?

2459
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:28,675
Do you wanna kiss me right now?

2460
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,719
I wouldn't have mentioned it
if I didn't.

2461
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:35,933
Fine.

2462
01:37:47,946 --> 01:37:49,112
You're just

2463
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,615
reeling me in, aren't you?

2464
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,285
You're like Roy Scheider

2465

01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:04,586
Then you're gonna wear
a set of my teeth

That mean lady's on,
and we hate that part.

2480
01:38:52,302 --> 01:38:54,222
Sweetheart, you know
how to use the fast-forward.

2481
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:56,221

2482
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:58,390

Let me go in and freshen up

2488
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:36,803

2490
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:41,600
Ok? Um, why don't you go in and...

2491
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:43,226
Go sit over there,

2492
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:46,313
and close your eyes,
lay your head back,

2493
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:48,065
and anticipate my return?

2494
01:39:49,776 --> 01:39:51,610
Okay.

2495
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,571
