- Forget it.
- David?

176
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,307
You're talking to yourself.

177
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,253
(Knife whirring)

178
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,825

00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,294
<i>Woman:
David, I hope you
brought an appetite!</i>

180
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,795
The ham looks delicious, mom.

181
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,531
...You squeeze one time
and you get ketchup and mustard,

182

- David,</i>

186
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,543
What does your family
usually do for the holidays?

187
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,748
We're going-- ahem.
We're going skiing.

188
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,483
Oh, skiing!

189
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,285
I'm gonna teach david
how to ski.

190
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,720
I'd be scared too.

191
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,625
- You look terrific.
- Thank you.

192
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,495
<i>- Doesn't she look terrific?
- Man: She's a beautiful girl.</i>

193

<i>(Guests chatting)</i>

194
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,604
The marks family.
Marks.

195
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,440
Are you kidding?
They own half
of times square.

196
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,642
Can we please
not talk about
this now?

197
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,712
Which half of times square?
What are you talking about?

198
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,514

- He's taking her to paris.

199
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,617
<i>- That's what she said.
- Hey!</i>

200
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,887
Whatever happened
to my trip to paris?

201
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,389
You'd be
lucky to get a trip
to paris, new jersey.

202
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,365
<i>Katie:
Mom's making coffee.</i>

203
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,700
- What?
- Why are you hiding?

204
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,769
I'm not.

205
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,506
Is it awful?

206
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,510
Awful?
Is it awful?

207
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,712
No, it's not awful
at all.

208
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,614
It's just different,
that's all.

209
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,316
It's just
very different.

210
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,451
You know, everybody
talks to each other

211
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,887
And there's a ham
with pineapples on it

212
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,356
With little cherries
in the middle.

213
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,692
- Cherries,
I like those cherries.
- Yeah, I like them too.

214
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,028
It's just really different.

215
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,802
Will you marry me?

216
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,673
What?

217
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,645
Was that a yes?

218
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,299
- Thank you.
- This was nice.

219
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,735
Yeah.

220
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,704
We just wanted to do it,
to make it official.

221
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,612
It's $39.50 each.

222
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,748
That includes
a generous tip.

223
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,820
<i>Oh.</i>

224
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,091
(Chuckles)
I'm sorry.

225
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,396
Yeah.

226
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,698
Thanks, mom.

227
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,701
<i>- You're welcome, sweetheart.
- Thank you.</i>

228
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,636
You're welcome.

229
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,386
<i>Sanford:
So the guy's not selling</i>

230
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,621
And his kids are starving.
And he's sitting on the world's

231
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,490
Most valuable butcher shop.

232
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,860
But my dad wouldn't give up.
He used to say

233
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,562
"there's always a way
to convince a holdout."

234
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,565
You know?
I came around.

235
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,869
Sooner or later
everybody does.

236
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,339
<i>- (Door opens)
- oh, david.</i>

237
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,741
<i>- Look who's here.
- Oh, speak of the devil.</i>

238
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,745
Your grandfather
didn't come hat in hand

239
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:28,980
To ask me
to join the firm.

240
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,982
It was understood.
I understood it.

241
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,217
Your brother
understands it
and you do too.

242
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,987
We're happy here, okay?

243
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,323
- I'm subsidizing that.
- Yeah, only until
we get settled.

244
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,125
Settled?
You think she's happy here?

245
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,831
- Isn't she?
- You think she had
this dump in mind

246
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,567
When she left mineola?
When she laid eyes on you?

247
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,502
No, she had more in mind

248
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,305
And she deserves better.
She's a beautiful woman.

249
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,574
Just like your mother.

250
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,879
- Thanks for visiting.
- Thank you, honey.

251
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,816
I'd better get back to work.

252
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,251
How do you think my son can
afford to live like this?

253
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,464
What?

254
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,501
Sanford:
Take me to the airport.

255
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,948
Best of luck.
Do you have a place
picked out in new york yet?

256
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,749
<i>Katie: No.</i>

257
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,089
<i>Lawyer:
Then why did you
sell it?</i>

258
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,959
<i>David:
I guess I thought it was
what I should do.</i>

259
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,761
<i>And I went along
with my father's wishes</i>

260
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,631
<i>And I agreed to go
into the family business.</i>

261
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,938
Some of our times square tenants
pay their rent in cash,

262
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,107
So you'll pick it up
in person.

263
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,843
- Solly, give him
the address of the luxor.
- Sure.

264
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,180
When you get down there,
you'll see why I'm sending you.

265
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,416
These people are not
really corporate.

266
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,987
But these properties need
to pay for themselves.

267
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,556
That is, until we
tear 'em down.

268
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,125
And ultimately

269
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,594
I think maybe you can
manage the whole area.

270
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,635
Well, it's good to have
you here, son.

271
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,239

<i>We built apartments
and office buildings</i>

of the worst buildings

- What do you want from me?

290
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,125
We need to take
the offensive, mr. Mayor.

talk openly about
your past?</i>

348

David, you cocksucker!

349
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,858
Get over here
and give me a hug.

00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,478
I swear to god,
I had no idea

357
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,847
That people like her
even existed.

358
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,249
She's perfect.

359
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,151
(Laughs)
what do you mean by perfect?

360
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,789
I mean there's nothing that
I do that she doesn't like.

361
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,062
She hasn't known you
long enough.

362
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,203
It must be so exciting,
having your first book
published?

363
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,972
You know, I was thinking
of taking some classes.

364
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,275
- Maybe premed.
- How's, uh...

365
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,412
How's david doing
working for his dad?

366
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,117
Oh, he doesn't say
or he just says "okay."

367
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,519
Well, that's him.
It's like--

368
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,389
Like when he lost his mother.

369
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,291
- When did she pass away?
- Pass away?

370
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,560
She jumped off the roof,

371
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,764
Cracked her skull open like
a walnut on the driveway.

372
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,000
David saw the whole thing.

373
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,370
He hid under a table for a week.
When he came out, it was...

374
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,073
It was like he never had one.

375
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,510
One what?

376
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,512
A mother.

377
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,915
And... And that was it.

378
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,985
Excuse me, katie.

379
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,225
Woman: Smile.

380
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,299
She's very sweet.

381
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,202
- Unbelievable.
- What?

382
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,305
You're the only person
I know that can say "sweet"
like you're cursing.

383
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,208
I did--
sweet is a great thing.

384
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,410
- I wish I was sweet.
- Yeah, I wish you
were sweet too.

385
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,112
- Mm-hmm.
- What'd you say to her?

386
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,214
Nothing.
I didn't say
anything to her.

387
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,516
- We were just talking.
I just met her.
- Nothing? Mm-hmm.

388
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,953
Anyway.

389
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,189
I've missed you.

390
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,327
Quit it!
I'm being sweet.
I've missed you.

391
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,029
I've missed you too.

392
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,500
You surprised me a little.

393
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,237
<i>You're married to

394
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,706

- well, I wouldn't put it
like that.

395
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:06,176
<i>You're working for--
you're working for
your dad, david?</i>

396
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,746
Which you said
you'd never do.

397
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,148
- When's the baby shower?
- Come on.

398
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,384
You know, it's still me.

399
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:19,089
Does that girl know
how fucked up you are?

400
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:23,193
No, we're gonna--
we're gonna straighten
you out, david.

401
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,762
We are.
I know a great therapist

402
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,031
And you're gonna
love her because...

403
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,067
Because she does house calls.

404

Try to focus
on your breathing.

406
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,284
It's not
so much the memory,
but the feeling--

407
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,853
<i>The feeling
the memory evokes.</i>

408

419

to like the city</i>

420

Oh!
This place must have

- I guess it's just the way
people act around you.

They sort of favor you.

it was an execution.

that it was a homicide,
