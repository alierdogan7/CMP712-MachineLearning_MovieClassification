1
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:02,227
Back, back, back.

2
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:05,139
How fucking far back do you go?

3
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:08,212
My mom and dad were
divorced before I was 2.

4
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:12,690
And from then on, my father
was almost uninvolved in my life...

5
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,007
...and my mother, much too involved.

6
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:20,491
She wanted to make up
for all her mistakes through me.

7
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:25,224
One night, there was something
in my pants, like, blood.

8
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:29,492
My mom said, "Oh, hell, your period.

9
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:31,914
This is where all the trouble starts."

10
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:35,148
She was right.

11
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:06,131
Now Mom and Dad
really had something to fight over.

12
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:07,407
Me.

13
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,516
Then one day, my dad disappeared.

14
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:14,444
No number, no letters, just gone.

15
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:16,980
I wrote to Seventeen magazine.

16
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,092
A long letter about us.

17
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,035
They wanted to publish it
as an article but kept asking:

18
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:24,691
"Your dad going away?
Does he come back?

19
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,835
Does it have a happy ending?"

20
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:30,099
In reality, it didn't,
but I thought, "What the hell?

21
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,790
I'll give them what they want."

22
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,387
This is it.

23
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,948
Time to go.

24
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:38,580
Mom, please...

25
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,596
No way are we gonna be late.

26
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,004
We have hours.

27
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:45,171
Honey, honey, you've got
registration at 4.

28
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:46,829
Come on, now.

29
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:51,571
Oh, Lizzie, you wanna take your rug.

30
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,288
- Mom!
- What? Come on.

31
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:58,029
This is the most important day
of your life.

32
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:01,684
I thought that's
when you got married.

33
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:04,335
No, honey, that's
the worst day of your life.

34
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,274
Yeah, she is so excited.

35
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,387
Oh, Mom, she looks beautiful.

36
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:12,362
Pity, I was aiming for psychotic.

37
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:15,571
Well, yeah.

38
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:17,812
Grandma's so excited she's crying.

39
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:19,924
It's a journalism scholarship, Mom.

40
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:22,771
Journalism, yeah.
She wants to be a writer.

41
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,557
The first few days,
that's when everyone makes friends.

42
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,323
I know.

43
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:37,520
- It gets harder later.
- Mom, I think I'm old enough.

44
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,756
Don't get upset.

45
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,227
I'm not getting upset.

46
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:44,115
Why are you saying that I'm upset?

47
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,836
I'm just trying to help. You know that.

48
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:49,007
You know how proud
I am of you, Lizzie.

49
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:52,051
You have so much potential.

50
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,251
Are you listening to me?

51
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,040
Lizzie?

52
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,411
Lizzie. Lizzie, what are you doing?

53
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:01,907
Come on, let's get this stuff
down to the car.

54
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:04,755
I don't have to go to Harvard
to become a writer.

55
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:10,029
Lizzie, what are you talking about?

56
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:12,532
At Harvard, you'll meet people.

57
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:16,373
You'll get contacts.
You'll get people to help you.

58
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:19,122
I know what I'm talking about, Lizzie.

59
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:22,472
I had my whole life ahead of me.

60
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,841
You don't want to go to Harvard?

61
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,148
Well, you just...

62
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:31,124
...wait until you have no choices left...

63
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,916
...where you've got nothing.

64
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,733
No one. No one
who cares about you.

65
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:39,082
- Then you see how you feel.
- Mom, I didn't say I wasn't going.

66
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:42,514
Dr. Isaacs warned me.

67
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:44,723
Mom, I said, I'm going.

68
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:46,195
He told me you'd isolate...

69
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:48,851
...stay in your room all day.
- I'm not isolating.

70
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:50,990
Okay, I'm not gonna isolate.

71
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:54,793
I want things to be different.

72
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:00,820
Fine.

73
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,093
That's all you need, then.

74
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,098
That's what I've been talking about.

75
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:08,563
You'll see, Lizzie.

76
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:11,346
It'll be a whole other world up there.

77
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,813
Young, God, I was so young.

78
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:26,164
You be careful. When I think of it,
just a year older than you...

79
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:28,366
...and I was already a housewife.

80
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,111
God, I was so bored
I bought a monkey...

81
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:35,754
...just to have someone to talk to.

82
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,866
But then you came along.

83
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:06,324
Oh, my God.

84
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:09,301
Lizzie, Lizzie, it's so...

85
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,188
Harvard.

86
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,790
But you're on the fifth floor.

87
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,780
I know.

88
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,404
Well, how are we
gonna manage, huh?

89
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,028
I can do it, okay, Mom?
Don't worry about it.

90
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,232
- No, no, no.
- Hi.

91
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,210
May I be of assistance?

92
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:36,170
Could you? Oh, that's too kind.

93
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,444
My pleasure.

94
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:42,579
Ever since she
was in second grade...

95
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,595
...she was always writing.

96
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:47,828
The man has "good catch"
written all over his forehead.

97
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,762
Any minute now she'
gonna ask me to confirm it.

98
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:53,236
Lizzie.

99
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:55,733
I've always helped my
mother pick up boyfriends.

100
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:58,869
The only one I never got a say in
was the one that mattered.

101
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:00,176
My dad.

102
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:03,827
Now, that's quality. That's a father.

103
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:07,059
Could you imagine your father?
We'd still be in Manhattan.

104
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:09,481
I told him you've already
had things published.

105
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:15,626
Don't you think you should be getting
the car back? It's getting kind of late.

106
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:18,194
Yeah.

107
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:22,062
Don't forget to eat.

108
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,521
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Mom.

109
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:42,381
Ever since I was a little kid, my mom
and I always hung out together.

110
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:48,329
I didn't fit in with most kids in school.

111
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:52,816
They thought I was strange,
so they made me feel like a stranger.

112
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:58,228
And my mother took advantage of it
from an early age.

113
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:01,460
Throwing me into plays,
spelling bees, studying...

114
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,032
...writing, museums, concerts
and even more writing.

115
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,845
She convinced me this would
lead to the Holy Grail.

116
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:12,595
Harvard. A place where I would
finally be surrounded by people...

117
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:14,547
...I had something in common with.

118
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,691
I'm not gonna ask for much.

119
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:19,309
They don't have
to be a Springsteen fan.

120
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,300
Nice meeting you guys.

121
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,991
Nice meeting you guys.

122
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:29,940
- Hi.
- Hi.

123
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,733
You're Elizabeth, right?

124
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,601
Yeah, I thought that I recognized you
from the face book.

125
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:38,612
I read that article that you wrote
about your parents' divorce.

126
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:41,236
- That was brilliant.
- Thank you.

127
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:43,059
- I'm Ruby.
- Hi.

128
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,710
- We're gonna be roommates.
- Oh, cool.

129
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:50,837
Seriously, you don't have any idea
what that article meant to me.

130
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:54,699
You telling the grisly truth about
your parents, exposing all their lies.

131
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:59,218
And then meeting with your father,
reconciling with him.

132
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,153
So inspiring.

133
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:07,336
Do you smoke?

134
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,500
You know, I've never smoked
in the daytime before.

135
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,883
Well, we're at Harvard now.
We can do whatever we want to.

136
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:18,001
Cool.

137
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,897
We'll be like these
beautiful, literary freaks.

138
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:26,571
And brilliant and dark, sexy.

139
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:32,464
Trouble is, I'm deadly serious.

140
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,891
Boys never used to notice me before.

141
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:46,379
I wasn't even on their list
of alternatives.

142
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:13,196
Ruby gets it. She gets me.

143
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:16,530
If she were a guy,
everything would be perfect.

144
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:32,883
When Lou Reed was 17 years old,
he was diagnosed...

145
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,891
...as suffering from mood swings.

146
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:40,689
He was subjected to electric-shock
treatment three times a week.

147
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:45,173
Each treatment hit him
as a blinding white light...

148
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:47,924
...and therein lies his genius.

149
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,877
To embrace
his own psychic carnage...

150
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:53,454
...and create some of the greatest
rock 'n' roll the world has ever heard.

151
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:24,595
I feel his cold embrace...

152
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,388
...his sly caress.

153
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,692
Lying in my room for days on end.

154
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:32,213
Everything cold, dark, silvery.

155
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:35,860
I'm scared he'll take me back to
the depths of my own twisted desire...

156
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,411
...to a place I'm too afraid to go to
because maybe I'll never escape.

157
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:41,582
I'll bet you got thousands at home.

158
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:48,238
Cigarette packs,
with tiny, little writing on them.

159
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:52,788
Your life story?

160
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,795
Diary? No?

161
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:56,682
Come on, this is killing me.

162
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:01,781
It's an assignment.

163
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:04,812
You're the most conscientious
student at Harvard.

164
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,152
It's a music review.

165
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:11,725
I'm trying to start a music
column for The Crimson.

166
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:13,675
That's great.

167
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:18,671
You wanna do some X?

168
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,630
You've never done X.

169
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:26,729
Acid goes to your head, right?

170
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:30,668
X goes to your heart.

171
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,911
Hey.

172
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:34,703
You okay?

173
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:41,483
What are you doing in here?

174
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:46,644
Oh, no.

175
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,554
Do you wanna go back inside?

176
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,013
There's a guy out there.

177
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:59,084
I think he's looking for you.

178
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,709
His voice comes to me
under the covers.

179
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,933
"Come here, baby." He' inside
of me, where no one else has been...

180
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,420
...in my dark and secret place.

181
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:43,669
I let him take me there...

182
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,619
...but then my fear returns.

183
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:47,667
I want him to stop.

184
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:51,124
How do you think it feels?
And when do you think it stops?

185
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:53,108
I don't want him in control.

186
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:54,548
I want him to be gone.

187
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,404
I want him not to exist.

188
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:58,196
I mean, let' face it.

189
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:00,139
"Lou Reed should be dead."

190
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:04,820
It's great.

191
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:15,984
You gonna sleep with me tonight?

192
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:20,371
Don't say I didn't warn you.

193
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:24,844
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means don't say I didn't warn you.

194
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,034
Great.

195
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:35,956
I've been wanting so badly
for sex to happen the right way...

196
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:39,818
...with the right person,
at the right time, in the right place.

197
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,108
- It wasn't any big deal.
- When is it, though?

198
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:47,890
- It should've been.
- Well, at least he's good-looking.

199
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:49,973
It was my first time.

200
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,925
Yeah, sure.

201
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,486
No, I'm serious.

202
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,450
Are you kidding me?

203
00:17:57,972 --> 00:17:59,315
It's true.

204
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:01,039
No way, I don't believe you.

205
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:04,687
I figured I should start having sex
like a normal 19-year-old.

206
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:09,428
I happen to think
this calls for celebration.

207
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:12,112
- We could have a party.
- A party?

208
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,835
It was meant to be subtle...

209
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:20,627
...but of course...

210
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:24,621
Elizabeth, this is great.
Such a wild idea.

211
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,598
Everyone got it.

212
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,878
Only not everyone was so pleased.

213
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:36,629
I wish I'd have thought
of something like this.

214
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:38,418
Thanks.

215
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,756
I love your dress.

216
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,974
Hey.

217
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:56,981
How can you take something private
and turn it into something public?

218
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:59,185
It wasn't private to begin with.

219
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:04,278
- It was good. It was interesting.
- Interesting?

220
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,036
I just mean it wasn't about me.

221
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:09,233
You know, it wasn't special.
It was just sex.

222
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,584
Okay, that's cool.

223
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,686
You don't look cool with it.

224
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:27,668
I'd been saving my virginity
for someone who truly loves me...

225
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:30,228
...who really knows the inside of me.

226
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:32,500
Noah wasn't it.

227
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,476
He told me afterwards that,
in terms of absolute value...

228
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:38,516
...sex and drugs were
equally meaningless to him.

229
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:41,070
Just two different ways to have fun.

230
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:44,469
Which is all well and good...

231
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:47,284
...until a girl tries to have
the same approach.

232
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:50,614
Lizzie?

233
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:52,914
- Hey, have you guys seen Lizzie?
- No.

234
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,306
Lizzie?

235
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:58,957
Lizzie?

236
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,365
Lizzie, you got a phone call.

237
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,156
- Who is it?
- Rolling Stone.

238
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:04,979
Rolling Stone?

239
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:07,765
The college journalism
award for 1985...

240
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:12,086
The college journalism
award for 1985...

241
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,187
...goes to Elizabeth Wurtzel...

242
00:20:15,187 --> 00:20:18,254
...for her Harvard Crimson piece
on Lou Reed.

243
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:24,980
I want to forget everything
that has happened to me before.

244
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,119
I wanna freeze this moment.

245
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:30,603
Forever.

246
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:40,458
Thank you.

247
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:44,116
- It's great.
- No, you're great.

248
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:45,588
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

249
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:49,076
I'm thinking about the bands coming
to Cambridge who you can cover.

250
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:52,021
It's rare we get somebody
who's going to all the gigs...

251
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:53,749
...writing with such clarity.

252
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:55,989
So I'm thinking
he's coming on to me...

253
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:59,029
...and he's, like, an editor
at Rolling Stone.

254
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,820
And how old is he?

255
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,316
- Oh, my God.
- What?

256
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:04,723
- It's my dad.
- Oh, cool.

257
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:08,148
Look at that.

258
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:11,893
- What?
- I can't believe he left us for that.

259
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:13,844
What? What's the matter?

260
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:15,956
I haven't seen him in four years.

261
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:17,429
Wait. I thought you said...

262
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:19,633
I know what I said.

263
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,734
Dad, when are you coming back
to live with us?

264
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:35,469
Well, I'm not, honey. You know that.

265
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,381
But Mom said that if you want to,
she wants you to.

266
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,797
I'm sure your mom
didn't say that, did she?

267
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:45,488
She did.

268
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,084
Honey, you know...

269
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:49,645
...it's just not gonna happen.

270
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:56,748
Which doesn't mean
that I love you any the less.

271
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:11,091
Who does he think he is?

272
00:22:11,091 --> 00:22:15,700
He disappears for four fucking years.
Then he thinks he can come here...

273
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,676
...and take pictures of his perfect
Ivy League daughter?

274
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:20,692
This place has nothing to do with him.

275
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:23,733
The least he can do is have
the decency to understand that.

276
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,749
You should say something to him.

277
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:27,058
Like what?

278
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:28,971
I don't know.

279
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:32,086
How's your new life?
How's your new fucking girlfriend?

280
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:34,292
Lizzie, he's your father.
He loves you.

281
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,212
No, you don't know what it was like.

282
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:38,676
When I was 8, we went
to see The Last Waltz.

283
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:40,500
He passed out on tranquilizers.

284
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,117
I had to sit through the movie three
fucking times before he woke up.

285
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:46,124
What kind of a person does that?

286
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:49,427
I didn't realize.

287
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,213
That article...

288
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:54,352
...it was just wish fulfillment.

289
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,428
I was writing about how
I wanted things to be.

290
00:22:57,428 --> 00:22:59,252
The way people talked about it...

291
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,903
...the way you talked about it,
it made it seem real.

292
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:04,750
Well, maybe it can be.

293
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:11,700
No. It's just a dream I held
on to for way too long.

294
00:23:12,085 --> 00:23:14,158
I'm happy here.
I don't need him anymore.

295
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:17,551
We should go. Are you coming?

296
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:22,478
No. I promised my editor
that article by next week.

297
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,971
Jesus, it's 4:00 in the morning.
Do you mind?

298
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:56,532
I know. I'm sorry.

299
00:23:56,532 --> 00:23:59,216
Music helps me concentrate.

300
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:07,316
Springsteen' like
this garage-mechanic poet.

301
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:10,513
You can feel the sweat in his voice,
the grime in his guitar.

302
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,613
When he sings, I see steamy streets...

303
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:16,565
...lovers groping hands...

304
00:24:16,565 --> 00:24:18,229
...busted fenders.

305
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:22,223
The dirt is under his nails
and the clairvoyance in his eyes.

306
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,163
Jesus, Lizzie,
you haven't slept in days.

307
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,780
I had it perfect before.

308
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,984
I know I can get it back.

309
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:45,205
His words twist and grind and
hammer out a story for the brain...

310
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:48,021
...but his guitar and voice go
straight for your heart.

311
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:52,113
Music bellows from his insides, and
out comes the struggles of the world.

312
00:24:53,748 --> 00:24:56,276
Springsteen'
like this garage-mechanic poet.

313
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:58,698
Music bellows from his insides.

314
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:08,501
Out comes the struggles of the world,
of knowledge that comes with perfec...

315
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:11,798
It' like he feels with knowledge
that goes back through ages...

316
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,118
...to a single chord in our brains.
That beacon that can be touched...

317
00:25:16,118 --> 00:25:17,972
He has the power of pure emotion.

318
00:25:17,972 --> 00:25:21,039
Emotions so intense the body
literally must do something...

319
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,796
- Out comes the struggles...
- Fuck.

320
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:41,771
She still hasn't slept.

321
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,799
Lizzie.

322
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:48,975
Lizzie!

323
00:25:49,525 --> 00:25:52,053
I don't know how to say this
to you, all right...

324
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:54,290
...but you are starting to smell.

325
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,494
This is important.

326
00:25:57,078 --> 00:26:00,918
Lizzie, it's not as important as
your health. You gotta get some sleep.

327
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:02,096
Will you just fuck off?

328
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:05,451
I just have to finish this.

329
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,620
I can get you some downers, okay?

330
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,402
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

331
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:17,717
Noah? Noah, come on,
give it to me. Noah!

332
00:26:17,717 --> 00:26:19,477
Lizzie, this is just scribbling.

333
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,622
What? What the fuck? Asshole!

334
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,438
Stop it. Noah, put her down.
Put her...

335
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:26,708
Jesus, she turned
into the Harvard bag lady.

336
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,013
- What are you doing?
- She needs something.

337
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:31,156
- What?
- I don't know, some medical help.

338
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,585
Ruby!

339
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:38,605
It's okay. I got them, I got them.
It's all right.

340
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,517
Emotions so intense...

341
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,761
Bodies fly into air...

342
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:49,488
Lizzie. Lizzie, look.

343
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:52,500
You gotta calm down, okay?

344
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,468
That's not what you said when
I had your dick in my mouth.

345
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:05,653
You had any drugs
in the last 24 hours?

346
00:27:05,653 --> 00:27:07,279
No.

347
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:11,958
Well, I guess I snorted some coke
and smoked some pot...

348
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,509
...but that was just to make
the Ecstasy last longer.

349
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:16,721
Sure you're not forgetting anything?

350
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:18,833
Maybe a few beers.

351
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:23,477
Did you ever think you might have
a substance-abuse problem?

352
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:27,189
The only substance problem I have
is I need you to give me some tranqs...

353
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:30,059
...so I can come down
off this fucking coke.

354
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:31,632
And then what happens?

355
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,876
So you don't like coming here,
and you don't want to talk.

356
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:40,628
You don't have to.
You don't have to say anything...

357
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:43,604
...you don't want to say,
but if you don't say anything...

358
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:45,268
...if you don't talk to me...

359
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:46,479
...I can't help you.

360
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:51,221
You know, if you're
gonna suggest therapy, don't.

361
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:52,847
I'm living proof it doesn't work.

362
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:56,399
- So, what are you doing here?
- My friends brought me here.

363
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,400
Had nothing to do with you?

364
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:03,989
Are you gonna give
me something, doctor?

365
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:05,332
No.

366
00:28:05,332 --> 00:28:06,958
Not today.

367
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,250
I'm falling.

368
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:22,134
I can't even finish my article.

369
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,884
Maybe Noah' right.
It' all a scribble.

370
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:27,088
I don't really have
anything original to say.

371
00:28:28,628 --> 00:28:30,613
Writing can't save me.

372
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:32,588
Even Harvard can't save me.

373
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:35,956
How can I escape from
the demons in my head?

374
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:39,189
- I didn't.
- So, what, did she blow you?

375
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:42,198
- Did you go...? What?
- Yeah, she fucking blew me, all right?

376
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,277
- But I was drunk.
- You fucking shithead.

377
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:47,592
How fucking could you?
How fucking...?

378
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:50,100
Lizzie?

379
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,955
Lizzie, stop.

380
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:54,314
Lizzie!

381
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,917
Lizzie, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

382
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:59,157
I'm gonna fucking kill you, you bitch.

383
00:28:59,157 --> 00:29:01,461
Sam told me. He told me everything.

384
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:04,310
You losing your virginity,
was that another fucking lie?

385
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,230
You don't understand. Okay?

386
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,566
You don't understand.
It was an accident.

387
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,412
An accident?
You call that a fucking accident?

388
00:29:11,412 --> 00:29:14,933
It was...
It was sort of, you know...

389
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,421
- Come on, what?
- An accidental blowjob.

390
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,275
Oh, fuck you.

391
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:22,741
I could fucking kill you, Lizzie.

392
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:26,386
I swear to God, I could fucking kill you.
How could you do that?

393
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:37,973
Hemingway has this classic moment
in The Sun Also Rises.

394
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:41,525
When someone asks Mike Campbell
how he went bankrupt...

395
00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:45,749
...all he can say is,
"Gradually, then suddenly."

396
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:47,797
That' how depression hits.

397
00:29:47,797 --> 00:29:50,961
You wake up one morning
afraid that you're going to live.

398
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:56,340
I can't believe we're back to this.

399
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,548
You think I wanna be like this?

400
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,850
I don't know. I don't know, Lizzie.

401
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:04,622
I thought everything
was gonna be okay.

402
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,879
I was so proud of you at Harvard.

403
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:13,580
- Is it because I haven't visited you?
- No, Mom.

404
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:17,590
I thought this was behind us.
Then I get a phone call...

405
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,596
Mom, this has nothing to do with you.

406
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:28,362
I mean, it's nothing you've done.

407
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:35,915
Why did they move you here?

408
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:38,001
I asked for a single room.

409
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:40,790
Why?

410
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,511
Reasons of mental instability.

411
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,229
I told them I just...
I can't live with other people.

412
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:47,789
You told...

413
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:50,988
You said that?

414
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:55,157
Oh, Lizzie. Your education.

415
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:56,718
This opportunity.

416
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:00,300
I'm sorry, Mom.

417
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,349
You know, I just can't cope with this.

418
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:09,236
It's just all too much.

419
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:12,051
It's all so crazy.

420
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:17,068
I am not going to do this anymore!

421
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,724
No, you listen to me.

422
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:30,164
I raise her! I raise her all by myself
with no help from you!

423
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:34,261
No help from me? I'm the one that
does everything, I never get credit!

424
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:37,813
You make all the decisions,
and they blow up in your face!

425
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,021
- Do they not?
- What are you talking about?

426
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:43,030
You do nothing for her!
You do nothing for her!

427
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,302
You never even see her!

428
00:31:45,302 --> 00:31:49,174
You don't take her on vacations.
You don't take her on the weekends.

429
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,669
What the hell do you ever
do for her, Donald?

430
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:55,636
I am her father. I put her in the clinic,
and you're looking in Manhattan.

431
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:59,317
You son of a bitch!
Goddamn, I hate you! I hate you!

432
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,219
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

433
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,084
What is wrong with you?

434
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:09,679
Nothing.

435
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:13,716
Oh, God. You're not...?

436
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:17,620
Pregnant? No, Mom, I'm not pregnant.

437
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,180
Anyway, it's the '80s.
That wouldn't be a problem.

438
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,384
Please, Lizzie, don't speak like that.

439
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:24,365
What, then?

440
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:35,435
I don't understand you, Lizzie.

441
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:45,548
This place is filthy.
I'll help you clean it up.

442
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:47,251
Mom, no.

443
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:52,462
I don't have a simple solution, okay?

444
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,099
I don't know what to do, Lizzie.

445
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:02,357
- I've taken a couple days off work.
- No, you can't.

446
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,146
I wanna help.

447
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:10,645
- God knows I can't afford it, but...
- I'm much better by myself. Okay?

448
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:13,166
If I'd known you'd react like this...

449
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:18,837
Look, I have to study.

450
00:33:18,837 --> 00:33:22,102
You know, I've been working
really hard...

451
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:26,323
...and I've been having a difficult time.
I just needed a few days.

452
00:33:27,892 --> 00:33:30,133
I'm so worried about you, Lizzie.

453
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,109
I promise I'll take care of myself.

454
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,538
Okay?

455
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:37,039
And I'll come and see you.

456
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:39,253
I've seen enough already.

457
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:41,675
We'll spend time together
in New York.

458
00:33:42,006 --> 00:33:43,948
Please? I promise.

459
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,693
I just have all this work
I have to finish here.

460
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:50,861
Maybe for your birthday.

461
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:54,229
Yeah. Yeah.

462
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:56,717
I promise I will be home
for my birthday.

463
00:33:57,013 --> 00:33:58,639
We can celebrate.

464
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:01,910
- We'll have a party.
- Okay.

465
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,561
I'll make those pear tarts that you like.

466
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:07,250
That would be great.

467
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:14,026
Hey.

468
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:22,294
Lizzie, I love you dearly.
Really, I do.

469
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:26,102
But you can only hang out in my room
if you don't drink or do drugs.

470
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:28,109
Come on, you can't be serious.

471
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,198
Totally.

472
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:31,475
Just say no.

473
00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:36,143
But, Noah, there's no reason
to be in your room sober.

474
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,141
I wanna explain to Noah
how exhausted I am.

475
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:47,094
Even in my dreams.

476
00:34:47,094 --> 00:34:49,302
How I wake up tired.

477
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:52,815
How I'm being drowned
by some kind of black wave.

478
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:54,484
But I can't write.

479
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:58,225
And he really doesn't wanna
know about it anyway.

480
00:35:10,197 --> 00:35:12,369
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

481
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:13,971
Hi.

482
00:35:15,286 --> 00:35:16,595
Hi.

483
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:27,509
Ruby, this is crazy.
We have to talk.

484
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:29,844
You know, I'd really rather not.

485
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:33,586
I'm sorry. You know that.

486
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:36,662
And I have no excuse.

487
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:38,899
So then, why? Why did you do it?

488
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:42,990
I'm just really fucked up.

489
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:45,653
I'm like a defective model...

490
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:50,028
...and you don't know that until
you've been around me a while.

491
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:56,437
You know, some days I wake up,
and I just feel so flat-out, just fucked...

492
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:58,774
...that I'll do anything to feel different.

493
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:00,886
Lizzie, when we're together,
you're fine.

494
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:03,606
- You're fun. You're...
- I'm faking it.

495
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:06,475
- Well, everybody does that.
- Not like me.

496
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:11,244
Look, we all have bad days.

497
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:15,922
This is what people say in situations
when they don't know what to say.

498
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:17,675
Fuck.

499
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:20,274
I don't know what to suggest either.

500
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:25,231
People care about you, Lizzie.

501
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:28,086
What I want is for someone
to understand...

502
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,526
...but they don't, really.

503
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:31,637
That makes the platitudes
harder to bear.

504
00:36:31,637 --> 00:36:33,268
They do, people wanna help.

505
00:36:33,268 --> 00:36:36,373
All right? I wanna help you,
but I don't know what to do.

506
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:38,577
I don't need the company line
right now, okay?

507
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:42,485
Okay.

508
00:36:43,254 --> 00:36:46,262
Jesus. Listen to me.

509
00:36:46,262 --> 00:36:49,328
All I see is the dark side of everything.

510
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:52,247
Poor Ruby.

511
00:36:52,247 --> 00:36:54,325
I kill her joy.

512
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:57,397
Look at her sad, discouraged face.

513
00:36:57,397 --> 00:36:58,706
I don't know what to say.

514
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,399
How about,
"Shit, call in the professionals"?

515
00:37:14,998 --> 00:37:18,228
So I guess this is the Freud part,
where I don't say anything...

516
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:21,327
...and you don't say anything.
All of a sudden, it's:

517
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:24,688
"Obviously, you wish to sleep
with your father."

518
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,630
So I'm to take it you don't wish to
sleep with your father?

519
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,972
No.

520
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,085
And I don't wanna talk
about my childhood either.

521
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,317
I don't know why I'm here.

522
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,675
Why might you be here?

523
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:47,377
I can't write.

524
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:50,836
And what do you write about?

525
00:37:51,798 --> 00:37:55,350
I write stories, poems, articles.

526
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,936
I'm here on a journalism scholarship.

527
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:03,828
I've been writing forever. I have to.

528
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:07,342
How long has it been
since you stopped writing?

529
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:10,543
About a month.

530
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:14,198
Do you remember
the first thing you wrote?

531
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:15,798
A poem.

532
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:17,870
A poem. About what?

533
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,627
My dad.

534
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:22,070
Can you remember anything it said?

535
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,526
I told you, I don't wanna
talk about my childhood.

536
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:31,221
I just... I feel so stupid,
sitting in therapy.

537
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:33,558
People have much harder
childhoods than mine.

538
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:36,307
We're not talking about others.
We're talking about you.

539
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,869
I'll give her that much.

540
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:40,779
I'm the problem.

541
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:45,622
I worry about being in therapy.

542
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:48,470
I worry about not being in therapy.

543
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:51,665
I even worry I'm not entertaining
enough for Dr. Sterling.

544
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:55,381
I just keep thinking that
if I could just be normal...

545
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:59,349
...if I could just get out of bed in the
morning, everything would be okay.

546
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,172
Well, what do you think normal is?

547
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,413
Most people, they cut themselves,
they put a Band-Aid on, keep going.

548
00:39:07,734 --> 00:39:08,912
And what do you do?

549
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:10,931
I just keep bleeding.

550
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:15,157
So you think being normal is having
a wound, putting a patch on it...

551
00:39:15,157 --> 00:39:16,618
...then go on with your life?

552
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,083
Isn't that what functioning is?

553
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,006
Isn't that what living is?

554
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:24,949
You know, you keep going,
no matter what happens to you.

555
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:26,738
Is that the way you wanna live?

556
00:39:52,854 --> 00:39:54,447
Mom.

557
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:58,578
Oh, come on, now, honey.

558
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:02,764
Why don't you tie up your hair
anymore? Your face is so pretty.

559
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,988
Here they are.

560
00:40:14,262 --> 00:40:15,920
Come on, now, Lizzie.

561
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:24,816
Hi, honey!

562
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,381
Is she home yet?

563
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:43,058
I need someone to shut off my brain
and turn on my heart.

564
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:48,565
Well, I have long brown hair,
dark eyes.

565
00:40:48,565 --> 00:40:51,317
You probably meet tons of
girls in the men's bathroom.

566
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:54,700
Oh, yeah, the Ecstasy goddess.

567
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,230
Yes, I can't believe
you remember that.

568
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,637
Lizzie.

569
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,620
Can you hang on a sec?

570
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:07,607
Grandma and Grandpa are here.

571
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:08,916
Yes, I heard.

572
00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:15,628
You know, the only reason I threw a
birthday party was to make you happy.

573
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:20,278
I don't understand how you can
treat me like this.

574
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:21,904
Can I have some privacy, please?

575
00:41:31,703 --> 00:41:33,392
That was my mother.

576
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:37,174
It's my birthday.
She's throwing this big party for me.

577
00:41:37,174 --> 00:41:38,805
Cool.

578
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:41,391
Well, no, actually, it's not.

579
00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:44,534
It's just me and my mother
and my grandparents.

580
00:41:44,534 --> 00:41:46,192
I haven't even been out there yet.

581
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:47,943
Aren't they missing you?

582
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:50,474
Well, now you sound like
a nice Jewish boy.

583
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,343
Well, I might, if I was Jewish.

584
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:56,711
I just wanted to call and say hi.

585
00:41:58,026 --> 00:42:00,330
Let's meet up when
you get back to school.

586
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,442
Okay, that'd be great.

587
00:42:02,442 --> 00:42:05,639
Hey, happy birthday.

588
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,185
Thank you.

589
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:13,450
Rafe didn't seem to realize...

590
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,353
...he'd just been appointed
to save my life.

591
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:21,418
Rolling Stone magazine.

592
00:42:21,418 --> 00:42:24,426
It's the music magazine.

593
00:42:24,426 --> 00:42:27,691
That's wonderful, honey.

594
00:42:27,691 --> 00:42:32,394
They want her to work for them. Yeah.
Paid work for Rolling Stone.

595
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:34,313
They'll pay her?

596
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:44,105
I think she was up writing
late last night.

597
00:42:45,035 --> 00:42:46,977
Were you up writing late last night?

598
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:49,544
I haven't written anything in months.

599
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:53,164
She's always working on something.

600
00:42:53,164 --> 00:42:55,276
She just doesn't like to talk about it.

601
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:57,000
Like you've ever read any of it.

602
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:04,812
Lizzie, this isn't very nice.

603
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:06,373
You want one?

604
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:18,699
What's wrong with her?

605
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:22,124
Nothing. Ma, nothing's wrong with her.

606
00:43:22,124 --> 00:43:24,716
- She's drunk.
- Of course I'm drunk.

607
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:28,044
- She's just tired.
- She's as skinny as a ghost.

608
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:30,248
She's overtired.
They work so hard up there.

609
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:33,797
- Lizzie.
- Is she on drugs?

610
00:43:34,637 --> 00:43:37,069
- I wish I was on drugs.
- Lizzie.

611
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:38,957
- Did she say that she...?
- No, Ma.

612
00:43:38,957 --> 00:43:41,388
It's okay. Everything is okay.

613
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:44,493
Mom, believe me,
if I was on drugs, I'd tell you.

614
00:43:44,493 --> 00:43:47,469
People don't behave this way
if they're not on drugs.

615
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:49,771
I fucking do.

616
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,891
I'm so sorry, Mama.

617
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:15,597
I dream about all the things
I wish I'd said.

618
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:18,606
The opposite of what
came out of my mouth.

619
00:44:18,606 --> 00:44:22,061
I wish I'd said,
"Mom, please forgive me.

620
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:24,110
Please help me.

621
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,274
I know I have no right
to behave this way."

622
00:44:40,142 --> 00:44:42,126
- Hello.
- Hey.

623
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:45,199
- Hi.
- How' my birthday girl?

624
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,502
You're late. You're a day late.

625
00:44:47,502 --> 00:44:49,707
What can I say, you know how it is.

626
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:53,871
Anyway, I thought I'd have to be
dealing with your secretary by now.

627
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:57,166
You're such a bigshot journalist,
writing for Rolling Stone.

628
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,054
- Did you read it?
- You know...

629
00:44:59,054 --> 00:45:01,355
...remember this,
they're lucky to have you.

630
00:45:02,254 --> 00:45:05,039
These guys, they're smart.
They're really smart.

631
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,599
They know what they're doing.
They can see talent.

632
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,575
I'm probably gonna get assignments
all over the country...

633
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,591
...so I could maybe come visit you.

634
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:14,500
Who are you talking to, Lizzie?

635
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,511
- It's no one.
- Who is it?

636
00:45:18,511 --> 00:45:20,335
- It's no one.
- Don't listen to her.

637
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:21,742
Please, Mom.

638
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,328
Look at you, the two of you.

639
00:45:25,328 --> 00:45:27,631
- Go on, you're so in love with him.
- Mom.

640
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:29,871
Can you hear that?
Hear why I don't call?

641
00:45:29,871 --> 00:45:31,535
Where was he your childhood?

642
00:45:31,535 --> 00:45:33,543
- Where...?
- Stop it! Just stop it!

643
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:38,544
I just wanted to talk to him!

644
00:45:38,544 --> 00:45:41,032
You know, Lizzie,
I'm at the end of my rope.

645
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,535
I've been working extra hours.
I never go out.

646
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:51,782
I never buy clothes.
I spend all our money on your therapy.

647
00:45:53,008 --> 00:45:55,309
All our money? Daddy pays, Mom.

648
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:57,518
You think he pays?

649
00:45:58,671 --> 00:46:00,843
You think he's paying?

650
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:04,272
He doesn't pay one cent.

651
00:46:04,272 --> 00:46:08,133
Not one single red cent!

652
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,895
That's not true.

653
00:46:11,216 --> 00:46:14,544
Oh, you want me to show you?
Huh? You wanna see?

654
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:19,089
You want to see how much I'm paying,
still paying...

655
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:21,744
...on your last term bill? Huh?

656
00:46:21,744 --> 00:46:24,592
Here. Here, look at these.
Look at these.

657
00:46:24,592 --> 00:46:27,569
- There, look at that, Lizzie.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

658
00:46:27,569 --> 00:46:31,912
You wanna see how much
I'm paying this Dr. Sterling?

659
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,554
I'm sorry.

660
00:46:33,554 --> 00:46:35,953
No, you're not gonna
talk your way out of this.

661
00:46:35,953 --> 00:46:38,703
Ask her who pays her!

662
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:45,265
You know, it's my fault,
for spoiling you the way I did.

663
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:49,617
I kill myself to get you to Harvard, and
you come back looking like a zombie.

664
00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:52,334
I know. I'm sorry.

665
00:46:53,265 --> 00:46:54,727
I'm so...

666
00:46:55,473 --> 00:46:57,448
Why won't he?

667
00:46:59,185 --> 00:47:02,032
- Why won't he?
- I know. I know, honey. I know.

668
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:07,506
I hate myself,
and I hate the things I do.

669
00:47:07,506 --> 00:47:10,354
Lizzie, it's all right. It's all right.

670
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,046
It's awful. It's so awful.

671
00:47:18,385 --> 00:47:21,459
And I hurt the people who love me.

672
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:24,208
But when he calls...

673
00:47:30,578 --> 00:47:32,520
My God, a party?

674
00:47:32,915 --> 00:47:35,947
And your stupid pear tart!

675
00:47:43,058 --> 00:47:44,562
Why do you do this, Lizzie?

676
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:48,206
Because I'm not
your goddamn monkey!

677
00:47:52,627 --> 00:47:56,521
I'm sorry, Mom, I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

678
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,081
I didn't mean it.

679
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,319
I'm sorry.

680
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:13,010
She threw the party for herself?

681
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:15,795
No, I guess for Grandma.

682
00:48:15,795 --> 00:48:18,032
Why would she want to do that?

683
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:23,566
To show her what
a good little girl she was.

684
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:26,291
That must really hurt.

685
00:48:27,316 --> 00:48:31,571
Look at her.
This isn't a breakthrough, darling.

686
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:35,281
My mom pays $ 100 an hour for this.

687
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:41,748
This is the same bullshit. Insight time.
It's like that stuff with that guy Rafe.

688
00:48:41,748 --> 00:48:44,884
I don't have to be Freud to know
I have a fear of rejection.

689
00:48:44,884 --> 00:48:47,700
And I know where it comes from.
I know it's from my dad.

690
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,612
But it doesn't change anything.

691
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:53,514
- I still can't go out with him.
- Why not?

692
00:48:54,004 --> 00:48:55,466
I just told you.

693
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:00,404
You didn't tell me
anything about Rafe.

694
00:49:00,885 --> 00:49:03,568
Has he ever given you reason
to believe he'd reject you?

695
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:15,024
Do not show him how crazy you are.

696
00:49:16,468 --> 00:49:18,709
- A monkey?
- Called Percy.

697
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:20,341
I know, it beats me.

698
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:22,996
- She needed someone to talk to.
- Well, she had you.

699
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:24,523
No, no, this was before.

700
00:49:24,853 --> 00:49:27,242
- Are you listening?
- God, yes.

701
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:28,817
I'm not boring you?

702
00:49:29,205 --> 00:49:31,732
Please, Lizzie.
I met you in a men's room.

703
00:49:31,732 --> 00:49:34,962
- You're anything but boring.
- What am I?

704
00:49:36,822 --> 00:49:38,578
Scary.

705
00:49:40,054 --> 00:49:42,443
So are we gonna go to this gig?

706
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,611
I'm not sure.

707
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:48,438
I don't really know where it is.

708
00:49:48,438 --> 00:49:51,472
You came to see a gig,
and you don't know where it is?

709
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:55,218
I said I came to see the gig...

710
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,728
You know.

711
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:04,374
- What?
- Okay, now you're just being cruel.

712
00:50:04,374 --> 00:50:05,942
No, no, you said...

713
00:50:05,942 --> 00:50:09,652
I said I came to see the gig...

714
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,360
...but I came to see you.

715
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:36,178
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

716
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:40,502
Waiting for him to make the move.

717
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:48,269
Doesn't he know?
He' gotta be my salvation.

718
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:58,776
It' lovely that he' caring...

719
00:50:58,776 --> 00:51:01,843
...compassionate
and politically correct.

720
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,567
But I need him to kiss me.

721
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:06,390
Right now.

722
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,750
Ruby!

723
00:51:53,498 --> 00:51:55,254
Ruby.

724
00:52:00,505 --> 00:52:01,716
Hey.

725
00:52:01,977 --> 00:52:03,668
Hey.

726
00:52:03,928 --> 00:52:07,573
I didn't know you'd moved rooms.
I thought you were still in here.

727
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,974
Ruby was telling me about
those articles you're planning to write.

728
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:17,140
That stuff's always
been easy for me.

729
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,929
Dr. Sterling must have called him.

730
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:26,230
Why else would he be here?

731
00:52:26,713 --> 00:52:29,786
Probably to see how dire
the situation is.

732
00:52:29,786 --> 00:52:32,437
See if his little girl can
get through the day still.

733
00:52:33,178 --> 00:52:34,836
Or...

734
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:38,257
...maybe he really did finally miss me.

735
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:40,436
My girl.

736
00:52:43,386 --> 00:52:45,466
Dad, you know those medical bills?

737
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:47,888
The ones for the psychiatric
treatment?

738
00:52:49,787 --> 00:52:51,867
They keep sending them to Mom.

739
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:54,485
So I guess you haven't paid.

740
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:58,233
- I can't believe you're asking me this.
- Oh, you have paid?

741
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:00,251
You're all cold and distant.

742
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:02,107
And... And...

743
00:53:02,107 --> 00:53:04,730
And now you're asking me what?

744
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,202
What are you talking about?

745
00:53:06,202 --> 00:53:09,851
- If you don't know...
- No. No, I don't know.

746
00:53:09,851 --> 00:53:13,531
- You made a promise.
- You haven't written me.

747
00:53:13,531 --> 00:53:15,579
You never call me.

748
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:17,787
It's like I don't even exist.

749
00:53:17,787 --> 00:53:22,267
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- I even come and visit you.

750
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:24,123
- Fuck you!
- You watch that language!

751
00:53:24,123 --> 00:53:26,587
- Is that a way to talk to your father?
- Listen.

752
00:53:26,587 --> 00:53:30,236
You're the one who left. You're the one
who walked away for four years.

753
00:53:30,236 --> 00:53:33,339
You think I don't know that?
Is that what you think?

754
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:35,003
You think I don't feel it?

755
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:39,644
Do you that think it's easy for me,
away from you?

756
00:53:39,644 --> 00:53:41,276
I hate it.

757
00:53:41,276 --> 00:53:43,292
The effect it had on you.

758
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:45,020
Your mother and myself.

759
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,740
I hated watching you get trapped
right in the middle.

760
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,916
- In between the two of us.
- Dad, please.

761
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:51,771
Please!

762
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:53,275
- You're my father.
- Right.

763
00:53:53,275 --> 00:53:56,220
And you won't even pay
my medical bills.

764
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,351
Even though it won't cost you
anything.

765
00:53:59,643 --> 00:54:02,960
All you have to do is sign the papers.

766
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:07,228
It's 10 percent.

767
00:54:07,228 --> 00:54:10,333
- It's, like, nothing.
- No.

768
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:13,084
I lost my apartment, everything,
when we got divorced.

769
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:17,628
- It won't cost you anything.
- Sorry, Lizzie.

770
00:54:17,628 --> 00:54:20,214
That's your mother's responsibility.

771
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,949
What do you want me to do?
You want me to slit my wrists...

772
00:54:25,949 --> 00:54:28,573
...so that I'll qualify as a trauma case
for...?

773
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:30,712
This is killing me too.

774
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,181
This is killing me.

775
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:34,717
I mean, I feel so powerless.

776
00:54:34,717 --> 00:54:37,085
I look back at all the mistakes
that I made.

777
00:54:37,085 --> 00:54:39,867
I made a lot of mistakes,
and there's nothing I can do.

778
00:54:40,733 --> 00:54:42,391
What am I gonna do?

779
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:50,650
Hey, you.

780
00:54:52,124 --> 00:54:54,164
Hi.

781
00:55:03,742 --> 00:55:05,564
Guess who?

782
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:07,989
What are you doing?

783
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:11,677
Nothing. Just walking.

784
00:55:11,677 --> 00:55:13,822
Walking with somebody.

785
00:55:13,822 --> 00:55:17,171
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I could be walking with a girl.

786
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:20,603
Okay, fine, you're right. It's a boy.

787
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:23,645
He's tall.

788
00:55:23,966 --> 00:55:25,908
Very tall.

789
00:55:26,175 --> 00:55:28,383
Of course he's taller than me.

790
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:30,522
How tall are you?

791
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:32,926
Tall enough.

792
00:55:32,926 --> 00:55:35,348
I'd say 6 feet.

793
00:55:36,575 --> 00:55:39,705
Long lashes, brown eyes.

794
00:55:39,966 --> 00:55:44,571
He's kind of got that sexy,
intellectual, preppy thing going on.

795
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,734
What?

796
00:55:48,734 --> 00:55:50,334
Oh, cool. Yeah, I will.

797
00:55:50,334 --> 00:55:52,447
I'll ask him as soon as I hang up.

798
00:55:52,447 --> 00:55:54,015
All right. Okay.

799
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:56,575
Bye. Bye.

800
00:55:56,575 --> 00:56:01,054
Well, who now thinks of me
as a sexy intellectual?

801
00:56:01,054 --> 00:56:02,843
My mom.

802
00:56:03,935 --> 00:56:06,239
She wants us to visit
over the holidays.

803
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,345
She just moved.
I'm going anyway.

804
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:27,617
Every time I'm with him, I see myself
doing these horrible things.

805
00:57:27,617 --> 00:57:30,209
And I hate myself for it,
but I just can't stop.

806
00:57:30,209 --> 00:57:31,938
Okay, let's say that you could.

807
00:57:31,938 --> 00:57:34,239
What would you do differently?

808
00:57:36,993 --> 00:57:40,641
So when I saw you with her, I just...

809
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:42,017
I don't know.

810
00:57:42,017 --> 00:57:44,952
I know it's crazy, but...

811
00:57:45,826 --> 00:57:48,760
I can't help it.
I just have these feelings.

812
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:55,326
I'm sorry. I didn't...
I didn't realize.

813
00:57:57,634 --> 00:57:59,427
Hey, it's gonna happen.

814
00:57:59,427 --> 00:58:02,208
Beautiful women just
throw themselves at me.

815
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:14,594
- It's Earl Grey!
- Shit, sorry.

816
00:58:14,594 --> 00:58:16,514
- I'll get you another.
- Forget it.

817
00:58:16,514 --> 00:58:18,338
- It's no problem.
- I don't want it.

818
00:58:18,338 --> 00:58:20,290
Could we get another Earl Grey here?

819
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,978
- I said, I don't want it.
- Would you relax, Lizzie?!

820
00:58:22,978 --> 00:58:25,570
- It's just a goddamn cup of tea.
- Don't yell at me.

821
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:28,352
Just don't be ridiculous, okay?

822
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,786
You fucked her, didn't you?

823
00:58:30,786 --> 00:58:34,114
- What? Are you crazy?
- Don't yell at me!

824
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:36,220
I really don't know
what the problem is.

825
00:58:36,995 --> 00:58:39,994
Why don't you just keep fucking her
if that's what you want.

826
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:47,257
- Just go away.
- Lizzie.

827
00:58:49,603 --> 00:58:51,556
Hey. Lizzie, Lizzie.

828
00:58:51,556 --> 00:58:53,827
Lizzie. Come on.

829
00:58:53,827 --> 00:58:56,163
I'm sorry, okay?

830
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:58,340
I'm so... I'm sorry.
I didn't understand...

831
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:02,820
...how upset you are.
It's not your fault, all right?

832
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,347
It's my... It's my fault.

833
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:08,128
You're gonna leave me, aren't you?

834
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:10,908
No, I could never...

835
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:15,321
I love you.

836
00:59:17,028 --> 00:59:18,970
Why?

837
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:26,240
There's nothing you feel...

838
00:59:27,203 --> 00:59:31,165
...that you don't feel right down
to the bottom of yourself.

839
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:33,436
You're incredible.

840
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:51,420
I understand now how people
sometimes want to kill their lovers.

841
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,293
Eat their lovers.

842
00:59:56,453 --> 00:59:59,170
Inhale the ashes of their dead lovers.

843
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:04,061
It' the only way to posses
another person.

844
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:29,087
My mom's gonna love you.

845
01:00:32,389 --> 01:00:35,488
- You want juice?
- Sure.

846
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:41,060
Lizzie, listen.

847
01:00:42,085 --> 01:00:45,478
I'm not gonna be able to make it
back with you for the holidays.

848
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:48,039
There's something that came up
with my mom...

849
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:50,144
...and I need to...
I need to go home.

850
01:00:51,143 --> 01:00:53,255
But it's the holidays.

851
01:00:53,255 --> 01:00:56,230
- I need you to be with me.
- And I wish I could be.

852
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,532
I just... I can't be in two places
at once.

853
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:04,166
Okay. I'll come with you.

854
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,734
I'll help you with your mom.

855
01:01:05,734 --> 01:01:08,326
It's the right thing to do.
My mom will understand.

856
01:01:08,326 --> 01:01:10,268
Your mom just moved apartments,
Lizzie.

857
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,703
But I wanna be with you.

858
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,518
But right now your mom needs you.

859
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:24,551
It's just... It's a really
complicated situation.

860
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:27,079
Lizzie, my mom...

861
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:30,560
...she isn't real easy with strangers.
Okay?

862
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:35,879
I am right in the middle of some shit
that is not making me happy, Lizzie.

863
01:01:35,879 --> 01:01:37,799
I know, I know.

864
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:40,483
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

865
01:01:41,607 --> 01:01:44,552
I just... I love you, and I wanna help.

866
01:01:44,552 --> 01:01:48,039
You are. Lizzie, you are helping me.

867
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:49,576
Just...

868
01:01:49,576 --> 01:01:52,446
Just knowing that I'm gonna see you.

869
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,392
We'll have all next term together,
okay?

870
01:01:56,392 --> 01:01:59,775
- Okay?
- Okay.

871
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,663
So he asked me to help him.

872
01:02:02,663 --> 01:02:04,424
You know, to be strong for him.

873
01:02:04,424 --> 01:02:07,240
And I said, "Okay."

874
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,320
But I really did.
I did the whole thing.

875
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,904
I kissed him goodbye.
I made it so easy for him.

876
01:02:12,904 --> 01:02:16,423
And it actually made it
easier for me.

877
01:02:16,423 --> 01:02:19,424
- And we're both really happy.
- Well, that's great.

878
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:55,811
Wow.

879
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:00,489
Did you get everything
moved in okay?

880
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:03,620
Sure. I mean, it's not too much.

881
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:08,929
You know, it's a south-facing
apartment. I get light all day long.

882
01:03:10,729 --> 01:03:14,591
And it's so much easier to clean.

883
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:18,792
I think you'll like your room.

884
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:25,256
Oh, yeah.

885
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:29,578
So I'll just, you know,
put my things away.

886
01:03:29,578 --> 01:03:33,255
- Haven't made you any dinner, honey.
- Well, that's okay.

887
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:40,746
I'll pay her back one day.

888
01:03:40,746 --> 01:03:42,818
I swear I will.

889
01:03:58,795 --> 01:04:01,828
- You said that your friend was...
- He had a family emergency.

890
01:04:03,914 --> 01:04:07,403
- But he was going to come.
- Yes.

891
01:04:07,403 --> 01:04:10,604
He just... He had to go back
to Texas because...

892
01:04:10,604 --> 01:04:12,139
I don't know.

893
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,049
His name's Rafe.

894
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:18,411
That's a nice name.

895
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:20,044
You'd really like him.

896
01:04:20,044 --> 01:04:22,635
He's good-looking and kind.

897
01:04:22,635 --> 01:04:24,708
And he's Jewish.

898
01:04:25,036 --> 01:04:28,746
And, you know, he works
really, really hard.

899
01:04:31,052 --> 01:04:33,964
- Well, maybe next time.
- Yeah.

900
01:04:33,964 --> 01:04:35,468
He wanted to meet you.

901
01:04:35,468 --> 01:04:38,028
He has a very close relationship
with his mother.

902
01:04:38,028 --> 01:04:39,719
That's nice.

903
01:04:47,915 --> 01:04:50,054
I gotta make a call.

904
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:53,260
Lizzie, don't.
It's, like, the 10th time today.

905
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,117
So?

906
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:59,692
So you'll drive him crazy,
piss him off.

907
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:01,804
You don't know
what you're talking about.

908
01:05:01,804 --> 01:05:03,943
Fuck you for saying that.

909
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,092
Hello, Mrs. Stevenson?

910
01:05:06,092 --> 01:05:07,981
Hi, this is Lizzie.

911
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:10,668
Lizzie. I'm a friend of Rafe's.

912
01:05:10,668 --> 01:05:13,901
Is he there? Oh, he's busy.

913
01:05:13,901 --> 01:05:16,290
Well, could you tell him it's urgent?

914
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:20,364
Okay. Bye.

915
01:05:21,869 --> 01:05:23,462
Why won't he pick up the phone?

916
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:28,455
I would never do this to him.

917
01:05:31,565 --> 01:05:33,507
So how is he?

918
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:36,870
I don't know. He was out.

919
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:45,549
I wonder if he lays awake at night
missing me...

920
01:05:45,549 --> 01:05:47,818
...the way I miss him.

921
01:05:53,293 --> 01:05:55,749
You ever love anybody, Ruby?

922
01:05:56,846 --> 01:05:58,602
I mean, really love somebody.

923
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,445
You kidding? Sure.

924
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:05,832
You think you have.
You have no idea.

925
01:06:07,758 --> 01:06:09,187
I suppose that you do.

926
01:06:12,942 --> 01:06:16,686
Real love is total.

927
01:06:16,686 --> 01:06:18,991
It's like life or death.

928
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:21,103
You know you'll die
when you're apart...

929
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:24,069
...because the need is so pure.

930
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,630
So complete.

931
01:06:29,135 --> 01:06:30,476
All you know is sex.

932
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:36,271
Christ, you gave me a hard time
about Sam.

933
01:06:36,271 --> 01:06:39,271
You never loved Sam.
How could you?

934
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,967
Oh, was I mean?

935
01:06:45,967 --> 01:06:49,066
You can't take it,
the happening chick that you are?

936
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:55,658
Lizzie, I'm not crying
because you're mean.

937
01:06:57,071 --> 01:07:00,300
I just can't imagine how incredibly
painful it must be to be you.

938
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:18,279
Listen, I'm at the airport.

939
01:07:20,943 --> 01:07:23,887
No. No, I mean, I'm here...

940
01:07:23,887 --> 01:07:25,796
...at the Austin Airport.

941
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:29,712
Oh, my God.

942
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,265
I've become the ultimate
nightmare girlfriend.

943
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:36,460
Maybe you should call your mom.

944
01:07:36,912 --> 01:07:39,432
Let her know you're okay.

945
01:07:39,824 --> 01:07:41,351
I can't.

946
01:07:44,112 --> 01:07:45,771
Lizzie.

947
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:49,329
Look, you remember I told you...

948
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:52,078
...you coming here wasn't
such a good idea?

949
01:07:53,617 --> 01:07:55,024
If you loved me enough.

950
01:07:56,529 --> 01:07:58,321
All right, look.

951
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:02,512
There's something that
I haven't told you about.

952
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:07,089
- Oh, Christ, don't look at me like that.
- Just tell me.

953
01:08:07,089 --> 01:08:09,681
- It's not what you think.
- Bastard.

954
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:12,688
- Cheap bastard.
- It's my sister.

955
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,696
It's my sister, all right!

956
01:08:22,929 --> 01:08:25,864
So you're from New York originally?

957
01:08:26,257 --> 01:08:28,679
Manhattan. I grew up
on the Upper West Side.

958
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,793
Rafe showed me
copies of your articles.

959
01:08:40,274 --> 01:08:42,543
That's quite an achievement
for a first year.

960
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:46,578
Ellen. Ellen.

961
01:08:46,578 --> 01:08:49,202
Hey, stop. Come on, please.

962
01:08:49,202 --> 01:08:52,650
Hey, let's eat, okay. Come on.

963
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:58,002
You promised me you'd go to bed,
okay?

964
01:08:58,002 --> 01:08:59,410
Good, come on. That's it.

965
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:01,714
Come on. Hey, come on.

966
01:09:01,714 --> 01:09:04,018
Come on. Stop.

967
01:09:04,018 --> 01:09:07,314
Ellen, you go to bed, and we'll go
to the park tomorrow, okay?

968
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:09,746
Come on. Come on, please?
Just, please.

969
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:12,233
Hey, you wanna go
to the park tomorrow?

970
01:09:22,387 --> 01:09:24,946
Might have to take her to the doctor.

971
01:09:24,946 --> 01:09:28,208
This carries on much longer,
I don't know what we're gonna do.

972
01:09:29,619 --> 01:09:31,245
What is it?

973
01:09:34,451 --> 01:09:36,753
You get off on this.

974
01:09:40,659 --> 01:09:42,317
What?

975
01:09:43,155 --> 01:09:45,577
This does it for you.

976
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:55,499
- What are you talking about?
- You hid her from me.

977
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,195
Don't you think there's a reason?

978
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:00,275
Don't you think
that tells me something?

979
01:10:00,275 --> 01:10:01,716
Oh, Christ.

980
01:10:01,716 --> 01:10:03,795
You're some kind of creepy voyeur.

981
01:10:03,795 --> 01:10:07,507
- You like other people's misery.
- You're sick.

982
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:10,036
You're really... You're really sick.

983
01:10:10,036 --> 01:10:12,010
Tell me it's not true.

984
01:10:12,948 --> 01:10:14,770
Rafe, please.

985
01:10:15,988 --> 01:10:17,963
I'll get the car.

986
01:10:31,892 --> 01:10:34,324
Mom? How have you been?

987
01:10:34,324 --> 01:10:36,725
How do you think I've been?

988
01:10:36,725 --> 01:10:39,189
Christ, Lizzie, don't you ever think?

989
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:42,261
I'm sorry. I just...
I had to get to the airport right away.

990
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:45,909
I would have told you.
We've been having some problems.

991
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:49,109
It' just been really hard,
but we're patching things up.

992
01:10:49,109 --> 01:10:51,189
Yeah, he loves me. I know he does.

993
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:52,912
It just...

994
01:10:53,557 --> 01:10:55,797
He's just got
all this weird family stuff.

995
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:57,589
He' trying to help them and me.

996
01:10:57,589 --> 01:11:01,941
And he' gotta help himself first.

997
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:04,789
And when he does,
everything' gonna be okay.

998
01:11:05,173 --> 01:11:08,406
- I'm sure.
- I mean, I know we'll be fine.

999
01:11:08,406 --> 01:11:11,722
I know that. I mean, do you think?

1000
01:11:13,525 --> 01:11:17,900
I'm no real help to you there, Lizzie.

1001
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:20,145
I know. I know.

1002
01:11:21,142 --> 01:11:23,052
Mama, I'm sorry you had to move.

1003
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,248
I know, sweetheart.

1004
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:32,374
- I'm gonna go now, okay?
- Mom?

1005
01:11:32,374 --> 01:11:34,479
You call me...

1006
01:11:39,254 --> 01:11:40,880
Mom?

1007
01:11:41,782 --> 01:11:43,506
...when you've...

1008
01:11:46,294 --> 01:11:49,142
...seen Dr. Sterling.

1009
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:50,735
Mom?

1010
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:52,622
- Bye, honey.
- Mom!

1011
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:07,467
I should've listened to him.

1012
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:11,317
He told me not to come here.

1013
01:12:12,311 --> 01:12:14,995
I'm more trouble than I'm worth.

1014
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:21,941
Well, what about your reading?

1015
01:12:22,327 --> 01:12:24,471
No, no.

1016
01:12:24,471 --> 01:12:27,090
Honey, you gotta get some work done.

1017
01:12:30,296 --> 01:12:33,752
Lizzie, this isn't working.

1018
01:12:33,752 --> 01:12:35,479
I know, I know, I know.

1019
01:12:35,479 --> 01:12:38,136
As soon as I get back,
I'll write your exam schedule.

1020
01:12:38,136 --> 01:12:41,365
There's no need, okay?
There's no need...

1021
01:12:48,471 --> 01:12:50,391
Well, then, I'll call you.

1022
01:12:50,391 --> 01:12:53,970
No, no calls! No calls, okay?

1023
01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:57,745
Look, this is not working, all right?

1024
01:12:58,009 --> 01:12:59,383
This is not my life.

1025
01:12:59,383 --> 01:13:02,067
I don't want this anymore.

1026
01:13:03,832 --> 01:13:06,360
What do you want?
Oh, you just woke up...

1027
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,953
...and decided you wanted
to fuck freshmen girls...

1028
01:13:08,953 --> 01:13:11,320
...and do lots of drugs?

1029
01:13:12,345 --> 01:13:14,035
Is that what you want?

1030
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,553
Yeah.

1031
01:13:18,553 --> 01:13:21,400
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

1032
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:26,477
I want to party.
I wanna have some fun.

1033
01:13:43,384 --> 01:13:45,785
You're the one who told me
to trust somebody.

1034
01:13:45,785 --> 01:13:47,961
Look what happened!

1035
01:13:47,961 --> 01:13:49,946
- You trusting Rafe has nothing...
- No!

1036
01:13:49,946 --> 01:13:52,602
All I want is for Rafe to come back...

1037
01:13:52,602 --> 01:13:54,617
...and you're talking about pills?

1038
01:13:54,617 --> 01:13:57,145
Because things are more difficult
for you now...

1039
01:13:57,145 --> 01:14:00,538
...I think you could use help.
- You said I was making progress.

1040
01:14:00,538 --> 01:14:02,714
Sometimes things
are more painful before...

1041
01:14:02,714 --> 01:14:04,922
You said this
would amount to something.

1042
01:14:04,922 --> 01:14:06,841
All this fucking pain!

1043
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:10,191
And I am still saying that.

1044
01:14:12,922 --> 01:14:15,606
I can't believe you're pushing drugs
after all of this.

1045
01:14:16,923 --> 01:14:19,707
I'm recommending that you try
this medication...

1046
01:14:19,707 --> 01:14:23,863
...so you can gain some perspective
and not spin out of control.

1047
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:28,537
Lizzie, isn't that what you want?

1048
01:14:36,698 --> 01:14:40,560
It takes two to six weeks
before your system swerves.

1049
01:14:42,618 --> 01:14:44,593
I know you don't.

1050
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:48,026
But I can see it working okay.

1051
01:14:51,802 --> 01:14:55,098
Your mother' been calling.
She wants to come and see you.

1052
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,547
Engine' beginning throttling
down now...

1053
01:15:03,547 --> 01:15:04,791
...at 94 percent.

1054
01:15:05,211 --> 01:15:08,408
Normal throttle for most of the flight,
104 percent.

1055
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,708
Three engines are running normally.
Three good fuel cells.

1056
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,714
Three good APUs.

1057
01:15:14,011 --> 01:15:16,059
Velocity, 2257 feet per second.

1058
01:15:16,059 --> 01:15:18,044
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

1059
01:15:18,044 --> 01:15:20,316
- Nothing.
- Trying to steal my purse.

1060
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:23,283
- Challenger, go at throttle up.
- Roger, go at throttle up.

1061
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:28,123
The space shuttle Challenger
exploded in a ball of fire...

1062
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:30,075
...after it left the launching pad.

1063
01:15:30,075 --> 01:15:31,931
- the fragments from the...

1064
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:34,395
Officials are saying there is
no evidence...

1065
01:15:34,395 --> 01:15:36,668
...to indicate that the astronauts
survived.

1066
01:15:36,668 --> 01:15:38,236
President Reagan...

1067
01:15:38,236 --> 01:15:41,692
- Challenger honored us with
the manner in which they lived.

1068
01:15:41,692 --> 01:15:44,572
Material from the scattered craft
is reported to be...

1069
01:15:44,572 --> 01:15:48,369
The worst accident in the history
of American space program...

1070
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:53,016
- was a sign that something
had gone terribly wrong.

1071
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,565
Ruby?

1072
01:15:57,565 --> 01:15:59,356
- Ruby?
- Jesus.

1073
01:15:59,356 --> 01:16:00,917
Hold on. Hold on, all right?

1074
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:04,828
Ruby, come on, this is serious.

1075
01:16:05,245 --> 01:16:07,293
- What?
- My mother's been mugged.

1076
01:16:07,293 --> 01:16:10,554
I have to go to New York.
You've gotta come with me.

1077
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:13,335
No.

1078
01:16:13,821 --> 01:16:15,517
Ruby, come on.

1079
01:16:15,517 --> 01:16:17,906
I'm asking for your help.

1080
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:20,764
Lizzie, I'm done helping.

1081
01:16:20,764 --> 01:16:23,389
You're done? How can you...?

1082
01:16:23,389 --> 01:16:25,080
I can't.

1083
01:16:25,725 --> 01:16:27,481
I've had it.

1084
01:16:27,773 --> 01:16:29,629
All right?
I can't do it anymore.

1085
01:16:29,629 --> 01:16:31,005
This has gotta end.

1086
01:16:31,005 --> 01:16:33,908
Next week is just gonna be
some other crisis.

1087
01:16:38,141 --> 01:16:40,214
One for the road.

1088
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:57,054
She refused the intravenous Demerol.

1089
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:01,342
She refuses painkilling drugs?

1090
01:17:01,342 --> 01:17:04,026
Can we possibly be related?

1091
01:17:04,766 --> 01:17:08,508
Looks like she's gonna be here
for a few days, but she'll be just fine.

1092
01:17:09,406 --> 01:17:11,807
She'll need some help
when she gets back home.

1093
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,367
But everything will be okay.

1094
01:17:17,822 --> 01:17:19,611
It' scary.

1095
01:17:19,998 --> 01:17:23,773
For the first time,
I'm being deprived of my tears.

1096
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,131
I don't know what I'm doing.

1097
01:17:34,207 --> 01:17:36,159
I mean, let' face it.

1098
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:39,509
Me being here to help
is like a cruel joke.

1099
01:17:51,936 --> 01:17:54,870
Not even heights
freak me out anymore.

1100
01:17:57,984 --> 01:18:00,024
You look a lot better.

1101
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,028
That's what everybody says.

1102
01:18:06,528 --> 01:18:08,349
You know, Lizzie...

1103
01:18:08,927 --> 01:18:10,559
...I'm fine.

1104
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:14,688
And there's no reason why you
can't go back up to Cambridge.

1105
01:18:14,688 --> 01:18:18,080
Mom, I've spoken with the nurses,
and they say that you need...

1106
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,080
Honey, you've got exams
coming up.

1107
01:18:22,784 --> 01:18:26,080
You have to have somebody with you,
even if it's just a few days.

1108
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,863
I can take care of myself.
I always have.

1109
01:18:30,721 --> 01:18:32,892
You're not going home alone.

1110
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,264
It's the other cupboard.

1111
01:18:35,264 --> 01:18:37,857
I don't know.

1112
01:18:37,857 --> 01:18:39,483
Grandma.

1113
01:18:52,737 --> 01:18:55,770
I don't know what I would have
done without Lizzie here.

1114
01:18:58,913 --> 01:19:02,272
- None of this would've happened...
- Ma, don't say that.

1115
01:19:02,272 --> 01:19:05,501
...if it hadn't been for her.

1116
01:19:21,058 --> 01:19:23,074
They're gone.

1117
01:19:23,074 --> 01:19:24,536
Yeah.

1118
01:19:25,442 --> 01:19:27,864
I didn't really feel like
saying goodbye.

1119
01:19:35,107 --> 01:19:38,685
After all this time,
I never asked you about Rafe.

1120
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:48,411
That's over.

1121
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:51,266
He...

1122
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:53,656
He never wants to see me again.

1123
01:19:59,106 --> 01:20:01,081
You know, when Donald left me...

1124
01:20:03,682 --> 01:20:05,690
...it seemed so incredible.

1125
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:08,927
I just couldn't believe it.

1126
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:22,654
I think I just forgot about you, Lizzie.

1127
01:20:23,362 --> 01:20:24,889
You know?

1128
01:20:26,403 --> 01:20:28,835
You were just a child.

1129
01:20:28,835 --> 01:20:32,131
So little.

1130
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:38,043
But you needed me.

1131
01:20:39,939 --> 01:20:44,228
And that forced me
to pay attention again.

1132
01:20:44,228 --> 01:20:45,919
You know what I mean?

1133
01:20:48,196 --> 01:20:50,529
I had to take care of you.

1134
01:20:52,899 --> 01:20:57,092
And in a way,
you brought me back to life...

1135
01:20:57,092 --> 01:21:00,158
...and you became everything
for me.

1136
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:05,118
I was so wrapped up in you.

1137
01:21:09,668 --> 01:21:14,500
But God, you were so full
of promise, Lizzie.

1138
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:19,170
And I wanted so much
for you in your life.

1139
01:21:20,932 --> 01:21:25,275
And I couldn't see
that it wasn't good for you.

1140
01:21:29,478 --> 01:21:31,386
You just...

1141
01:21:32,005 --> 01:21:34,307
I know you wanted me...

1142
01:21:34,854 --> 01:21:38,563
...to be everything, and I can't be.

1143
01:21:42,853 --> 01:21:45,023
I can't be.

1144
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:55,135
Look, Lizzie.

1145
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:59,426
You don't have
to be anything for me.

1146
01:21:59,877 --> 01:22:02,917
You don't have to be well for me.

1147
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:04,772
You understand?

1148
01:22:07,238 --> 01:22:09,759
You don't have to pretend.

1149
01:22:13,573 --> 01:22:15,941
I'll be okay, Mom.

1150
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:21,318
I'll be okay.

1151
01:22:22,535 --> 01:22:24,476
I promise.

1152
01:22:35,046 --> 01:22:36,867
I'll be okay.

1153
01:22:38,406 --> 01:22:40,413
And there' a reason.

1154
01:22:52,774 --> 01:22:56,571
I call this the crack house,
where I come to score.

1155
01:22:56,903 --> 01:22:59,456
Dr. Sterling is my dealer.

1156
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:04,195
It seems like everyone' doctor
is dealing this stuff now.

1157
01:23:05,767 --> 01:23:09,379
Sometimes it feels like we're
all living in a Prozac nation.

1158
01:23:09,863 --> 01:23:12,646
The United States of Depression.

1159
01:23:16,648 --> 01:23:18,917
I don't know who I am anymore.

1160
01:23:20,808 --> 01:23:23,077
I have this personality.

1161
01:23:23,751 --> 01:23:27,134
And it's fucked up, but it's me.

1162
01:23:28,232 --> 01:23:31,783
And I see myself becoming this
person who does the right thing...

1163
01:23:31,783 --> 01:23:34,085
...who says the right thing...

1164
01:23:34,823 --> 01:23:36,168
...but that's not me.

1165
01:23:36,168 --> 01:23:39,240
- You feel different, don't you?
- Of course I feel different.

1166
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,608
I'm on medication.
That's the point, isn't it?

1167
01:23:41,608 --> 01:23:43,518
Yeah, that was the point.

1168
01:23:43,816 --> 01:23:47,112
You're just not comfortable
with who this new person is yet.

1169
01:23:47,112 --> 01:23:49,576
But I can't be this person
without taking pills.

1170
01:23:49,576 --> 01:23:52,233
The pills are giving you
breathing space.

1171
01:23:52,233 --> 01:23:55,048
This feels like everything's
just being covered up.

1172
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:58,696
I recommend you stay on the
medication, but it's not my choice.

1173
01:23:58,696 --> 01:24:00,420
It's your choice.

1174
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:05,982
Do you want to get off the pills?

1175
01:25:03,594 --> 01:25:05,001
Sweetheart, come here.

1176
01:25:05,001 --> 01:25:06,856
Come here, it's okay.

1177
01:25:07,242 --> 01:25:08,900
It's okay.

1178
01:25:38,955 --> 01:25:42,217
If only my life could be
more like the movies.

1179
01:25:42,827 --> 01:25:45,963
I want an angel to swoop down
like he does to Jimmy Stewart...

1180
01:25:45,963 --> 01:25:49,608
...in It's a Wonderful Life
and talk me out of suicide.

1181
01:25:50,059 --> 01:25:53,356
I've always waited for that one
moment of truth to set me free...

1182
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:55,724
...and change my life forever.

1183
01:25:55,724 --> 01:25:57,612
But he won't come.

1184
01:25:58,379 --> 01:26:00,746
It doesn't happen that way.

1185
01:26:03,052 --> 01:26:05,547
All the drugs, all the therapy...

1186
01:26:05,547 --> 01:26:10,636
...the fights, anger, guilt,
Rafe, suicidal thoughts.

1187
01:26:10,636 --> 01:26:13,803
All of that was part
of some slow recovery process.

1188
01:26:13,803 --> 01:26:16,907
The same way I went down,
I came back up...

1189
01:26:16,907 --> 01:26:20,224
...gradually, and then suddenly.

1190
01:26:24,652 --> 01:26:27,563
The pills weren't a cure-all,
God knows...

1191
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:29,516
...but they gave me
breathing space...

1192
01:26:29,516 --> 01:26:31,724
...which allowed me
to start writing again.

1193
01:26:31,724 --> 01:26:35,336
Only this time it wasn't
as if my life depended on it.
