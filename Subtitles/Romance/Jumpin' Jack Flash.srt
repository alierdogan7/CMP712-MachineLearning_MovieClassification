01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,191
-Forty dollars. Great.
-Terry.

1299
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:17,909
Well, I did my part for democracy.

1300
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,995
I'll take you home, okay?

1301
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:36,029
No. No. I'm okay.

1302
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,111
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1303
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:47,473
She should be happy. Page is leaving,
and she's taking over his job.

1304
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:51,155
If I'd known that'd get a promotion,
I'd have blown up the place.

1305
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:55,472
Terry, I've got a great idea.
Let's have a little fun tonight after work.

1306
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:59,428
-Yeah, quit moping. Come with us.
-Yeah, we could go to Cole's.

1307
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,359
-No, thanks, you guys.
-Come on.

1308

[COMPUTER BEEPING]

1309
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,511
JACK:
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

1310
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,877
<i>Knock, knock. Please.</i>

1311
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,398
Leave me alone.

1312
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,519
<i>I'm sorry. Unavoidably delayed</i>
<i>in London. Queen thanks you.</i>

1313
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:33,712
Frankly, I don't give
a shit about the queen.

1314
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,235
I did give a shit about you, however.

1315
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,598
I sat in that restaurant
feeling stupid and hurt.

1316
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,557
I mean, what happened to you?

1317
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:47,510
All you had to do was come
and say "hi" or "thanks" or something.

1318
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:50,752
I mean, you just left me sitting there.

1319
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:55,670
But no, you sent me to a restaurant
with shitty bread sticks.

1320
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,990
<i>Sorry. I still want to take</i>
<i>you to dinner.</i>

1321
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:04,039
Next time I'm in London,
I'll look you up.

1322
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,391
<i>-Careful, you'll break your glasses.</i>
-Thank you.

1323
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:22,469
-Where are you?
<i>-Two rows back, on the left.</i>

1324
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,159
Oh.

1325
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:37,271
JACK:
Aren't you gonna turn around?

1326
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,879
No.

1327
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:45,149
JACK:
Why not?

1328
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,076
Well, because it....

1329
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,832
Hi, Jack.

1330
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:11,439
-I don't know how to thank you.
-Don't worry. I have a list.

1331
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:23,076
-What did you say about the queen?
-Forget I said it.

1332
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,430
-She'll be pleased to hear that.
-I bet.

1333
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,513
-How about that dinner?
-I'm not dressed for dinner.

1334
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,709
You look great.

1335
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,589
Not as great as I looked the last time
I got dressed to meet you.

1336
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:38,196
I looked fantastic!
Then all these crazy people--

1337
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:41,909
-Miss Doolittle? Never mind.
CYNTHIA: Terry?

1338
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,348
Is that him?

1339
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,752
This is Jack.

1340
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,354
CYNTHIA:
Hi, Jack!

1341
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,393
Ah!
Wh--?

1342
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,592
Go Terry! Yahoo!

1343
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,349
Terry!

1344
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,038
FRED:
Way to go, Terry!

1345
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,880
LARRY: You're looking lovely.
You're looking spiffy.

1346
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,031
You're looking good, mama!
