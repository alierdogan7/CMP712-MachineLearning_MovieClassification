00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,293
It's a very important time
in my career right now.

332
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,429
I've found women
but just not the right one.

333
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,440
A lot of great "almosts"
out there.

334
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,738
Oh, yeah, a lot of "almosts."

335
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,703
Yeah.

336

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

337
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,340
You speak Italian, huh?

338
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,408
No, I fake Italian.

339
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,646
I'd really love to learn it.

340
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,951
You know, Milly happens to be
a phenomenal cook.

341
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,082
She's always wanted to take
a cooking tour of Italy.

342
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,855
Oh, wow, I was gonna
go there this fall.
Really?

343
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,418
But it's a crazy time
for me right now.

344
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,693
My company is celebrating
their tenth anniversary.

345
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,755
Oh.

346
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,967
You're gonna need
a caterer then.

347
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,164
I mean, those kinds of
occasions should be marked,
don't you think?

348
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,966
You are good. So James Bond.
Yes.

349
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,174
Well, it was a pleasure
to meet you, Daphne Wilder.

350
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,240
Well, Jason, my pleasure.

351
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,445
Gotta love a woman
in polka dots.

352
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,387
Not everyone can pull it off.
Thank you.

353
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,449
Bye.

354
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,857
Bye-bye.
Bye.

355
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,822
Oh, my God.

356
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,266
Oh, yes.

357
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,630
And the winner is?

358
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,375
Duh. Hands down,
bachelor number 17.

359
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,932
Him?
Yes.

360
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,901
Oh, I don't trust that guy.

361
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,913
That guy was playing you
like a slide guitar.

362
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,448
He was not.

363
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,314
He's a very stable,
responsible, mature young man.

364
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,750
He has empty eyes.

365
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,914
They were not empty.
And who am I supposed to
choose anyway, huh?

366
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,982
Who do you think is better?
Me.

367
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,553
What?

368
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,153
I like you.

369
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,723
And I have an odd instinct
that I'd like her too.
Maybe I should meet her.

370
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,964
Let me be perfectly honest
with you, okay?

371
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,766
You're a very charming guy,
irresistible, in fact.

372
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,207
And that's why I know
you would be
a horrendous choice

373
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,576
because I'm not looking for
a great affair
for my daughter.

374
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,047
You know, like,
gorgeous musician
who's gonna break her heart.

375
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,549
I'm looking for
a life partner.

376
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,812
That's great. Thanks.

377
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,878
Yeah, no, I love being reduced
to a cultural cliché.
That's just terrific.

378
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,221
Because only musicians
break people's hearts. Wow.

379
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,816
Uh...

380
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,326
It's not the only place
I have them.

381
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,835
Well, look,
you're a great guy.

382
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,963
I hope you have a great life.

383
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,440
But I have to do
what's best for my daughter.

384
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,874
Yeah, of course you do,

385
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,412
but maybe you don't know
what's best for your daughter.

386
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,175
I beg your pardon?

387
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,274
Maybe you do.

388
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,210
Maybe I do.

389
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,978
Nice to meet you, Daphne.

390
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,851
Pleasure. Pleasure.

391
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,869
Here we are.

392
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,706
Almost here.

393
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:55,178
Yeah, we've landed.
We're in heaven.
Oh, my God.

394
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,580
Oh, my God. Look. Oh, God.
Mil, look at this.

395
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,314
Mom, it's polka dots. It's so
Minnie Mouse. I don't even
know if I like it. Do I?

396
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,753
I'm hearing you hate it.

397
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,257
Me, too.
Oh, please, just try it on.

398
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,725
Why?

399
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,523
Because I said so.

400
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,426
Honey, look,
it might surprise you.

401
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,227
Anyway, you look beautiful
in dresses. In fact,
you know what I think?

402
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,461
I think that you should
wear it to that catered affair
on Sunday.

403
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,902
To work? Mom,
I spill things all the time.

404
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,405
Oh, come on, just try it on.
All right.

405
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,909
Okay. That's incredible.

406
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,843
It's not really me at all.

407
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,075
What are you talking about?
It is totally you.

408
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,014
Well, it's sort of
more you in a way.

409
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,077
You know what it is,
it's kind of Aunt Jemima
meets Betty Crocker.

410
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,952
You know, that's ridiculous.

411
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,253
Come on, sweetie,
you know what I'm going to do?

412
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,453
I made up my mind.
I'm going to get it for you.

413
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,189
No, no, no. You're not
getting me this dress.

414
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,754
I don't even like it
and it's absurd for work.

415
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,891
No.

00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,394
Hello.

00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,184
Excuse me.

418

These meatballs
are my mom's recipe.

419
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,856
Fantastic, I recommend
everybody try some.

420
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,232
I love that shade of orchid.

421
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,295
Uh-huh.

422
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,676
Thank you, Matisse.

423
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:39,110
The chicken satay has got
a really unique flavor.
What'd you use?

424
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:43,018
It's cumin. I'm so sorry,
I can't really chat right now.

425

You guys,
the chocolate waterfall's
not in the right spot.

Oh, no, we can't have that.

427
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,860
You know what?
Let's just go ahead
and just shift everything over

428
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,726
so it frames the temple doors.
Thank you.

429
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,266
Yeah. That's the perfect spot.

430
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,264

it's a little cold.

I have to tell you
the most amazing thing
happened.

441

This guy at work
asked me out.

He did?
Yes, he's so cute.

We're gonna go out
Saturday night.

I'm just so excited.
I'm so excited.

Milly, well, that is
really great, sweetie.
That is so darn great.

It's great, right?

I can't even believe
that it's happening to me.

Thank you Mom. Yes.

You can say that again.

There's a lot of static
out there.

471
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,681
You know it's caused
by a lack of humidity
in the air

472
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,782
that causes an imbalance
of the positive and negative

loss, but that was 1993.

when I was in the 2nd grade,

493
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:48,097
and I walked around
with a booger in my nose
all day and nobody told me.

Why didn't they tell me?

why didn't Sheila tell you
she was unhappy?

00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,505
(SCREAMING)

834
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,570
Oh!

835
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,912
Lionel. Johnny's son.

836
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,716
John, is it?

837
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,647
Lionel. Come on, buddy.

838
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,710
Uh-huh.

839
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:22,749
Lionel, come on here now.

840
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,817
Pardon me.
MILLY: Johnny. That's Johnny.

841
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,829
Lionel, that's so cute.

842
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,296
Oh, my gosh. Oh, Mom.

843
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:34,729
(CRYING)

844
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,296
The delivery man's here.
Is this menorah-esque?

845
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,534
Mom, I don't even know
if this is good.

846
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,668
Find something Hobbit-like.
I don't have anything
Hobbit-like.

847
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:41,972
We should try
and make this work, though.

848
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,445
They're never gonna never know
it's from Gelson's.

849
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,347
Oh, wait, wait.
I used this for Jason's party.

850
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,476
Jason has such
nice eyes. Okay.

851
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:49,877
Thank you.

852
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,383
Happy Bar Mitzvah,
Josh Greenberg.

853
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,048
How do you know Jason has
such nice eyes?

854
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:57,890
Does he? Oh, that's so sweet.
He seems like
a very special person.

855
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:01,192
What if we try that new vase
on the coffee table?

856
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,596
He is nice.
But actually, they both are.
Oh, I'm sure they both are.

857
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,569
But in terms of who you
wanna get serious with,

858
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,471
that Johnny, at least from
what I can see, can't even
get his life together.

859
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:14,375
But I'm gonna stop, all right?
You know what's wrong?

860
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,413
The couch is
in the wrong place. Look.

861
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,243
I got an idea.
Okay.

862
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,647
So we'll move the couch.
Which way?
Let's move it this way.

863
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,810
Here we go.

864
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,639
That's so good.
Okay, there we go.
I think it's good.

865
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:45,231
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God, look at that.

866
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,278
It's so great.
It, like, completely opens
the room up.

867
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,573
So very, very, very good.
I love it.

868
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,876
The only thing is...
Can I just say this?
What?

869
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,509
We haven't tried the couch
by the window.
I think we should.

870
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,916
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

871
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,882
All right. I don't
even know if I see it here.
Okay. Oh, gosh.

872
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,647
Just a second. Hello?

873
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:05,326
You have the wrong number.
Yeah.
There is no J. Bond here.

874
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:09,732
FYI, the Eagle has landed.

875
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,203
Yeah, the hen is in the house.
Repeat, the hen is
in the house. Right now.

876
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,236
All right, honey?

877
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,332
Mil, if we push this
five inches to the left,

878
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,434
I swear it's gonna
transform your life.

879
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,980
You really think so?
I wouldn't lie to you.

880
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,514
All right.
Come on, let's go.

881
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:26,640
Okay, on three.
Yeah.

882

883
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,581
One, two, three.

This way. Mom?

885
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,524

<i>I was thinking about you</i>

886
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,287
<i>and I wanted to say what...</i>
Pick it up. Answer it.

887
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,727
Does he sound wonderful
or what? Why don't you
wanna talk to him?

888
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,096
I do wanna talk to him.
I just don't wanna do it
in front of you, all right?

889
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,191
Come on, Milly,
I mean I don't...

sweetie, I love <i>La Bohème.</i>

892
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,670
Just pick up the phone.
Mom, I don't want to
talk to him.

Mil, Mil, pick up the phone.

894
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,245
Mom, stop. No, no, no,
don't pick up the phone.

895
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,977
Here, take it. Say yes.
Stop, stop.

896
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,147
Hi.

897
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,849
Yeah, I'm great.

898
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,082
Oh, great. Yeah, okay.

899
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,249
Mmm-hmm.

900
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,986
That sounds really great.
Great.

901
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,725
Yeah, great. Okay.

902
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,632
All right.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

903
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,966
Okay, great. Bye.

904
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,437
He obviously adores you.

905
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,810
You think so?
Oh, God, and who wouldn't?

906
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:33,043
But, hon, are you aware
of how many times
you used the word "great"?

907
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,575
These candlesticks gotta go.

908
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,883
No, no, no. I like them.
They're staying.
They're great.

909
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,283
Milly, you know how much
I hate to meddle,
but I once had the choice

910
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,954
between a mature,
responsible young man
like Jason,

911
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,055
and your father,
who, of course,
I was infatuated with.

912
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,066
And to this day...
Okay, okay.

913
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,226
You know what?

914
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,135
To be fair, you're reading
a lot into a guy that you've
met for ten minutes.

915
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:59,437
Truth be told,
that Johnny has heartbreak
written all over his face.

916
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,967
No, no, no. Truth be told,
you know absolutely
nothing about him.

917
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,207
And know what, Mom? I gotta go
'cause I'm getting
my bangs cut.

918
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,909
What?
No, no, you go ahead.

919
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,110
No, that's okay, you go ahead.

920
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,174
Yes.
Fine.

921
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,118
Cut your bangs and quit
hiding your incredible eyes.

922
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,986
To be truthful, you know
nothing about him.
He's actually a good parent.

923
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,082
Hiding your incredible eyes.
I can't do this.

924
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,027
Milly, I love you
and you may be brilliant,
but you're not smart.

925
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,395
I just want you to
have a full, beautiful life.

926
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,094
Do I not have a life, Mom?
Because I thought
I had a life.

927
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,261
No. No, you have a career,
you have a car

928
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,669
and you have a loft
you pay way too much rent for.

929
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,764
That's not a life.

930
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:35,039
Milly, I'm your mother.
I love you enough
to tell you the truth.

931
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,910
Your version
of the truth, Mom.
No. No.

932
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,508
The truth is, happiness
is a series of choices.

933
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,348
It's not something
that just sort of happens.

934
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,514
One wrong decision
can change your whole life.

935
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,490
There's still time, Mom.

936
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,585
Not if you waste
another minute of it.

937
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,961
I mean for you.

938
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,994
And I don't say
"great" too much.

939
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,770
MILLY: This is great.
This is great.

940
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:11,341
The view is great.
The night is just so great.

941
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,110
You warm enough?
You wanna go inside?

942
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,515
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm nice and toasty.

943
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,609
Okay, all right.

944
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:21,624
And don't you just love
my mom's orange blossom
cheesecake? So good.

945
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,557
Get a big bite.
Wow.

946
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,086
It's great, right?

947
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:32,193
It's superb, which is
a synonym for great, if you're
ever looking for one.

948
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:37,505
You know, you're cold.
Let's go inside.

949
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:38,939
You get the candle,
I'll get the rest.

950
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,374
Let me grab that.

951
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,937
Be careful with that.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

952
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,071
I'm so sorry.

953
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,411
Oh, my gosh, please tell me
where I can get you
another one...

954
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,247
You can't.
It's my great-grandmother's.

955
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,544
Oh, my God. Jason.

956
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,555
I don't know
what to say. I'm sorry.

957
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,216
Please, I'm just,
I've been so out of it lately.

958
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,262
My alarm clock
didn't go off today
and that's why I was late

959
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,593
and I've just been
so stressed with
the Greenberg Bar Mitzvah,

960
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,189
but that's a whole...

961
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,765
You just seem really angry.

962
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,101
Nope.

963
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,339
I'm great.

964
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,808
Okay.

965
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,446
MILLY: I promise you
they're the best
chocolate soufflés ever.

966
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,149
Well, they better be.
They're worth it.

967
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,657
Touchdown.

968
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,958
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

969
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,327
Hey, it's all right.
That's all right.

970
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,692
I'm sorry. I bumped
into, like, a parking
meter yesterday

971
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,463
and I'm always breaking stuff.

972
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,403
Why are you apologizing?
It isn't even your fault.

973
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:46,169
Lionel, put some shoes on
before you come back
in here, all right?

974
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,637
Look, I know he can be a lot
and it gets a little crazy
around here sometimes.

975
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,047
But here you are making us
chocolate soufflés
and you're apologizing.

976
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,746
Sometimes, I think you let
people make you feel bad
about yourself.

977
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,153
Yeah, like you are right now?

978
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,389
(GRUNTING)

979
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,187
What is going on
with us today?

980
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,287
We're having an off day,
that's all.

981
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,027
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.

982
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,798
I'm leaving because
you're miserable

983
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,862
and we're having a bad day.
You just admitted it.

984
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,305
No, I said "off day."

985
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,967
And, yes,
we've had better days,

986
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,068
and I'm sure we'll have
a few hundred more weird ones

987
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,045
if we stay together. So what?

988
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,710
Johnny.
Give me your hand.

989
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,150
What?
I'm going to
try something here.

990
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,948
What are you doing?
Just a little something.

991
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,655
Oh.

992
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,859
The soufflés are done.
No, the timer didn't go off.

993
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,098
No, no. I feel it.
I feel it. Watch.

994
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,108
Those look beautiful.
Thank you.

995
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,913
The one thing I can
actually do right.

996
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,688
You have perfect timing.
Thank you.

997
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,856
Come here.

998
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,124
Don't apologize.

999
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,999
He has this way
of calming me down.

1000
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,436
A huge plus.
Yeah.

1001
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:24,767
But then the whole
Lionel thing.

1002
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:29,039
I just worry and wonder,
would I be a good mother
to him?

1003
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,103
Don't worry.
It's not genetic.

1004
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,277
They've been through
so much, though,

1005
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:40,847
with Lionel's mom, like,
freaking out and splitting
when he was so young.

1006
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,791
I don't know, not that we're
anywhere near talking
about any of this yet.

1007
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:48,228
Just the fact
that you're wondering,
though. God.

1008
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:52,659
I mean the fact is
you don't know either
of these guys that well.

1009
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,427
Who knows if Jason
even wants to have kids?

1010
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,836
JASON: Absolutely.

1011
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:58,973
Four kids.

1012
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,976
And I wanna name the first
one Charlie after my father

1013
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,705
and that works
if it's a boy or a girl.

1014
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:06,613
Then I want to design
a huge Craftsman house
for the whole brood.

1015
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,741
The exhibit's in here.

1016
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:11,082
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't let me in the museum.
Too many breakables.

1017
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,418
Don't worry. They're insured.

1018
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,024
Hey, listen.

1019
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,054
I'm sorry I lost my temper
with you the other day.

1020
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,223
You felt bad enough already.

1021
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,932
I can be a real ass
and I hate that about myself.

1022
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,176
Another family heirloom.

1023
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,645
He buys jewelry.
Well, it's a no-brainer.
He's the one.

1024
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,385
He felt remorse, Mae.
DAPHNE: Well,
that's a lovely quality.

1025
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,019
No, he knew
he should feel remorse.
Oh, my God, Milly.

1026
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:53,153
Those empanadas are amazing.

1027
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,960
They're gonna be perfect
for Mom's party.
Oh, my party.

1028
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:59,263
Mom, what about these
for your party?
Oh, shoes, please.

1029
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:02,134
Why are you making
such a big deal
over this dreaded event?

1030
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,139
Why are we celebrating
my descent into oblivion?

1031
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,675
Come on, Mom.
It's not that bad.
Snap out of it.

1032
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:11,009
Well, I mean, it is
a milestone, and actually,
I am taking stock of my life

1033
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,743
and trying to find
some peace and quiet
in my old age,

1034
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:17,150
so, Milly, will you please
bring Jason to the party?

1035
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,787
I would just love to meet him.
That's all I'm asking.

1036
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,189
I understand,
but isn't it my choice
who I bring?

1037
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,057
I think it is.
Thank you.

1038
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,889
All right.

1039
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,424
Okay.

1040
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,492
Oh.

1041
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,729
(DAPHNE MOANING)

Oh, my God.

1043
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:43,038
Mom, Eli says
that's what I say
right before I...

1044
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,740
No kidding? Me, too.

1045
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,111
And, you know, it was funny,

1046
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,480
the other night,
we hadn't had sex
in so long, by the third one,

1047
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,815
I was setting off
the car alarms
in the neighborhood,

1048
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,115
and dogs were barking...

1049
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,418
Three? Is that normal?

1050
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,959
Please. Everyone knows
I hold the record
in this family.

1051
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,962
Why are you so quiet?

1052
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,663
'Cause she's doing
the Oompa-Loompa
with two guys, Mom.

1053
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,728
Stop it.
What?

1054
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,270
DAPHNE: Wait a minute.

1055
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,138
At this point,
are you doing it
with both of them at once?

1056
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,542
No. I'm not. Absolutely not.

1057
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:30,019
Honey, I've been thinking
about your situation
with Jason.

1058
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,826
Mom, I didn't ask for this.
It happened to me.

(EXCLAIMING)

1060
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,361

<i>DAPHNE:</i>
<i>No. It happened to you.</i>

1062

Things have gotten
so out of hand
I broke my first bundt cake.

1063
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:13,066
Has anybody seen my G.I. Joe?

1064
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:14,797
Believe me, it's not in here.

1065
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:16,705
I left it on the bed.

1066
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,138
...that it happened to you.

1067
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,075
You're making me hate you
and I don't ever want to
see your face...

Happy birthday, Mom.
Happy birthday.

1072
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,884
MILLY: Your favorite
butterscotch cake.
We made it.

1073
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,220
MAGGIE: Well, some of us
made it.
MAE: We helped, okay?

1074
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,183
It's really yummy.
I tried some.
All right.

Make a wish, Mom.

Happy birthday.
We love you, Mom.

1079
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,583
I'd like to propose a toast.

1080
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,586
To the incredibly unique
Daphne Wilder,

1081
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:09,956
the fearless leader of
the Wilder women, who I hope
to someday call family.

1082
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,322
You've created
a wonderful family,

1083
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,863
and I hope when my folks
stop through town,

1084
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,695
that Milly'll charm them
as much as she's charmed me.

1085
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,099
Cheers.

1086
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,933

Cheers.

00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:23,700
Cheers.
WOMAN: Cheers.

1088
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,502
Thank you so much.

1089
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,372
Thank you, thank you.

1090
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,709
What was that exactly?
Did you know
he was gonna do that?

1091
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,709
Did he just propose?
Because I think
he just proposed.

1092
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,048
I think he did.
The question is, to who?

1093
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,714
Maggie, stop being a killjoy.
All right, girls,
what do you think?

1094
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,689
He seems well-read.
He's tall.

1095
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:44,022
Okay, you guys
don't like him at all.
Don't listen to your sisters.

1096
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,254
For God's sake, sweetie,
do not listen to them.

1097
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,353
Here's what I'm thinking.

1098
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,625
I'm thinking his parents
are from Connecticut.

1099
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:50,996
They're a little conservative,

1100
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,365
so maybe you should
just wear your pleated skirt.

1101
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,870
Just this once, honey?
Stop.

1102
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,373
It's just a gesture,
just make them
more comfortable.

1103
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:01,877
I understand it's a gesture
but, Mom,
this is moving very quickly.

1104
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:04,971
He just said
all of this. It's...
Milly, don't fight it.

1105
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,208
This is the way
it's supposed to be.

1106
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,977
You're just not used
to feeling pursued and adored.

1107
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,318
I hate pleated skirts.

1108
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,551
Isn't this about the time
we were going to sing?

1109
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,887
That's a great idea.
Come on, Mils.
Yes, yes.

1110
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,222
<i>Well, I met him on a Sunday</i>

1111
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,593
My voice.

1112
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:30,595
<i>And I missed him on Monday</i>

1113
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,642
Not bad. What do you
got going, Mom?

1114
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:40,012
<i>And I dated him Wednesday</i>

1115
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,482
<i>I said bye-bye, baby</i>

1116
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,024
Nice.
Yes.

1117
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:03,071
Milly? Will you take
the soprano?

1118
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,906
You know, that's it.
That's it.

1119
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,138
No, no. You're so
out of control.

1120
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,305
What'd I do this time?

1121
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,281
You're forcing me.
Jason's here.
You're making me...

1122
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,840
So, Jason, can I get you
another one of these?

1123
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:16,908
Will I need one?

1124
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,851
Oh, yeah.
They're just getting started.

1125
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,355
Who wants lavender ice cream?

1126
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:21,788
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

1127
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,588
You're not gonna go.
You're out of control.
Milly's right.

1128
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,061
I don't know how
she can take it.
I can't.
I can't take it anymore.

1129
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:32,124
Well, excuse me for just
one moment here. I thought
that this was my birthday.

1130
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,829
My very big, special birthday.

1131
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,531
Yes, Mom. It's your big,
special birthday.

1132
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:37,630
That's how you should remember

1133
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:38,867
you're too old...
Old?

1134
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:41,809
Not too old, but too old
to be doing this to Milly.

1135
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,778
You're pushing her
like you pushed her
into Girl Scouts.

1136
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,575
Thank you very much.
I'm not ten years old anymore.

1137
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:46,706
You have to stop.
Yeah.

1138
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:47,977
You have to change
at some point.

1139
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:52,681
Fine. But I just want you
girls to understand something
about motherhood, okay?

1140
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,915
Mom.

1141
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,048
Okay?
MAGGIE: Yeah, okay.

1142
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,854
I mean, it is the most
impossible love.

1143
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,419
You tell me when it ends.
You tell me when it stops.

1144
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:06,764
All I know is, it's absolutely
fine for me to teach you
how to walk and talk,

1145
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:11,000
and then you grow up and you
head off in the wrong
direction toward a cliff.

1146
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,975
And I'm supposed to just
stand there and wave and go,

1147
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:18,537
"Well, kids, good luck.
It's Mom. I'm here."
Well, I can't do that.

1148
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,579
What am I supposed to do, huh?

1149
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:26,748
Am I supposed to just put my
feet up at the end of the day
and say to myself,

1150
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:32,693
"Well, you know,
they're on their own
and she says she's fine."

1151
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:33,854
Well, you won't be.

1152
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,591
Just stop it. God damn it.

1153
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,895
You are making me crazy

01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:40,081
They seem to be
hitting it off.

1317
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,486
Definitely. Yeah.

1318
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:45,517
Beautiful. I don't think so.
And then I want you to
try the buffalo filet

1319
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:47,289
while we're here.
Yeah.

1320
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,264
You know, the buffalo was an
endangered species up until
a couple of years ago

1321
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:51,390
and now we're eating them.

1322
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,230
Isn't this great, Mom?

1323
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,196
...and you look out
over the fields

1324
01:12:57,272 --> 01:13:00,139
and what you see are herds
of commercial buffalo.

1325
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,336
And then you also see
herds of...

1326
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:05,880
I had a great time.
Please tell your parents
good night for me, okay?

1327
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,973
Good night.
Good night.

1328
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,458
Tell me you're not seeing
that guy. Are you, Milly?

1329
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:22,393
Yes, but I don't...

1330
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:24,659
Actually, the "yes"
is all I needed to know.

1331
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:27,497
No, no, no,
but the "but" part's
really important too.

1332
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,503
But what? Not him.

1333
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,128
Why?

1334
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:34,107
'Cause he looks like some guy
your mother would love.

1335
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,234
Johnny, wait, though.

1336
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,471
This is really difficult
for me and I've never
been here before.

1337
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:38,808
I don't know how to
navigate this.

1338
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,975
Oh, poor thing.
Don't talk to me that way.

1339
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,608
Oh, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking?

1340
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,984
You're involved with this guy
to the point where
you're meeting his family

1341
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,751
and I should be careful
how I'm talking to you?

1342
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,820
Are you sleeping with him?

1343
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:01,262
I wouldn't say it that way.

1344
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,670
Well, what way
would you say it?

1345
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,813
Are you going to stop
seeing him?

1346
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:18,011
That pause says it all.
No, it doesn't.

1347
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:19,781
That's not true.
That's not true.

1348
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:22,221
Who are you?
I can't even look at you.

1349
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:29,358
Oh, God.

1350
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,194
Oh, God.

JASON'S MOTHER:
Jason's finally met
such a wonderful girl.

1360
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:13,571
She's so sweet.
She has the loveliest spirit
about her.

1361
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:18,136
But I still can't believe
he found her on the Internet.

1362
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:20,147
Not like in our day.

1363
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,580
That somehow reminds me

1364
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:25,108
of people writing
a phone number
on the bathroom wall.

1365
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,988
Sweetie, I think that
we should...
Are you dating somebody else?

1366
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:36,052
What?

1367
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,629
I just heard your mom
on the phone talk about

1368
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,964
how you're dating some girl
you met on the Internet.

1369
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,402
Oh, it's nothing
like that at all.

1370
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:47,101
I'm surprised
and I don't even know
if I have the right to be,

1371
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,904
'cause to be honest,
I feel like I need to tell you

1372
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:52,105
that I'm also dating
somebody else.

1373
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:58,983
Well, first of all, to be
honest, you didn't need to
be so honest.

1374
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:01,886
I'm not seeing anyone but you.

1375
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:06,961
But since we're being honest,
this is something
that I was saving for later.

1376
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:13,427
What?

1377
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:17,701
My mother's personal ad?

1378
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:25,011
Oh, my God.

1379
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,539
You sounded just like her
there.

1380
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,174
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1381
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,446
Hey, hey, hey.
What does it matter
how we met?

1382
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,579
You and my mom have been
totally scheming

1383
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:35,850
and now I know exactly
why she pushed me on you.

1384
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,222
Because she was voting
for you. She found you.

1385
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,318
Yeah, and it doesn't
take anything away from us.

1386
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:44,024
What matters is that
we did meet and how good
this is between us.

1387
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,157
And the truth of that...

1388
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,565
The truth? Where's the truth?
Where's the truth?

1389
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:50,298
Because you've been living
a lie and I've been
lying to you, Jason.

1390
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:51,737
And it doesn't
change anything.

1391
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,604
How does that not
change everything?

1392
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:58,009
Because you're here.
I think you already
made your choice.

1393
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,911
But if it helps, I'll say it.

1394
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:03,213
Stop seeing him.
Then you and I can get closer.

1395
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:07,487
Close enough to spend
the rest of our lives
together.

1396
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,787
I knew I had you
the day I met you.

1397
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,450
How could you know
something like that?

1398
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:12,788
'Cause you were so nervous,

1399
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:16,353
you laughed like a hyena
in that beautiful polka dot
dress of yours.

1400
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:17,591
Really?

1401
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:18,655
Mmm-hmm.

1402
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,403
I'll tell you one thing,
though.

1403
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,500
You did not have me
the moment that we met

1404
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:30,169
because I wasn't even sure
that I liked the fact

1405
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:33,578
that your staff talked
about you behind your back
at the dessert table.

1406
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,480
And, excuse me,
but, truth be told,

1407
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,108
I didn't like anything
that you ordered for me

1408
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,948
on our first date,
except the calamari.

1409
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:41,956
And okay, fine, yes,
it was nice to not have
to think for a change,

1410
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:44,822
but who wants someone
who doesn't think?

1411
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:49,353
Look, and sometimes you laugh
when I cry and say, "Huh?"
when I make perfect sense.

1412
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:54,061
And never, ever, in my life
have I burned a chocolate
soufflé until now

1413
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,569
and that, in and of itself,

1414
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:59,164
oh, my God, should have
told me I don't feel
like myself around you.

1415
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,699
And I would have decided that
a long time ago
if it weren't for my mother.

1416
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:05,713
Because who wants someone
who laughs like a hyena

1417
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:09,808
in a polka dot dress
that my mother made me buy?

1418
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,182
I love that dress.

1419
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,714
Take her out.

1420
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:32,765
Hey.

1421
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:38,208
Stuart, this is an emergency.
Well, should I wait?

1422
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,077
Let's reschedule.
But I'm suicidal.

1423
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:43,083
Oh, wow, this is making me
feel like when I was
the last pick in kickball...

1424
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:46,086
Right and that's exactly
where we'll begin next week.

1425
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:50,386
Maggie, you promised me
after Willie Matthews,

1426
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:51,926
you would never
lie to me again.

1427
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:54,553
Oh, Milly Woo, Milly Boo.
Stop.

1428
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,029
Well, I'm sorry.
Mommy made me promise
not to say anything

1429
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,828
or she'd be furious.
Mommy?

1430
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,859
Mommy made you promise?
Where is your own moral code?

1431
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,463
Your adulthood?
Your sisterhood?

1432
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,768
Just...

1433
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:12,180
I'm feeling rejected by you.
Okay.

1434
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,010
And it's bringing up memories
of summer camp

1435
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:17,518
when Jimmy Feldon and
Eric Fishman both transferred
out of my bunk.

1436
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,349
I totally understand, Stuart.

1437
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,618
Come back today
and we'll do a two-hour
session at 3:00 p.m.

1438
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:25,318
Listen, you're right.

1439
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:28,191
I didn't handle this well
and I understand
you feel betrayed.

1440
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,857
But, really,
isn't some of this anger
a little misplaced?

1441
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,560
No, no, Maggie.
It's placed exactly
where it should be.

1442
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,399
And there is plenty to
go around, so don't worry,
Mom will be getting hers.

1443
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,063
Okay...
Maggie.

1444
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,966
Stuart, I am asking you
to empower yourself and leave.

1445
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:44,170
This could be a huge day
for you, Stuart.

1446
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:47,807
This makes me feel like when
I was 13 and no one came
to my bar mitzvah.

1447
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,646
Why didn't they come?
I don't get it.

1448
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,549
Stuart, you have
a blood sugar problem, okay?

1449
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,281
Just get some lunch,
you'll be fine.

1450
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:55,619
Honey, I know this is painful.

1451
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,351
Do you have any snacks
in here?

1452
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:58,824
Third shelf on the right.

1453
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,384
Honey, instead of blaming Mom,

1454
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,625
you should really focus on
the fact that both of these
guys went along with it.

1455
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:06,724
I am, I am. Because
I just told Jason that...

1456
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,000
Guys...

1457
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:12,434
Guys?

1458
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,105
That was plural, wasn't it?

1459
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,148
I feel like I don't know
what you guys
are talking about

1460
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:22,308
and it's making me feel
very much out of the loop,

1461
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,113
and it's making me want
to jump out the window.

1462
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:27,019
Stuart. For ten years,
my sister has sat here

1463
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,818
and told me that you're
about to commit suicide.

1464
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:31,051
Well?

1465
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:36,188
You mean she's been
talking about me?

1466
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:40,968
Wow. God.

1467
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:45,740
Mom? Are you there?
Pick up the phone, Mom.

1468
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,003

Mom.

DAPHNE: Yeah.

1476
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:24,838
Yeah?

common sense.

1617

It's pride,
and it's a quality

never would have betrayed you
in the first place.

1624
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:35,559
So what are you doing, Johnny?
What are you doing?

1625
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:38,360
Why waste one more minute
of your life?

1626
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,259
And I'm right.

1627
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:43,633
I'm so right.

1628
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:45,805
Damn it.

For once, she is.

you're cooking for one,

1637
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:12,191

to look forward to
the end result. You know?

make it for two?

1639
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:25,574
It's a little bit
more complicated,
but I think it can be done.

and already
added your carrots
and your pickled relish.

1642
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:38,616
And remember
that some people like dill.

1643
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:42,060
Even before I met you,
I had an instinct about you.

1644
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:46,194
And once I saw
you were a woman
with profound static cling,

1645
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:48,861
I wanted to be
that force around you.

1646
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:53,034
Personally, I love dill.
I think it's not used enough

1647
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:55,405
and very underrated,
sort of, like, mayonnaise,

1648
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:58,741
and I also really love
olive oil for tuna.

1649
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:02,408
I love that
when I breathe you in,
you smell of cake batter.

1650
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:07,585
And I love that
you have this insane way

1651
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:10,920
of talking in circles
that makes perfect sense.

1652
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:13,251
I do?

1653
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:17,591
'Cause sometimes
I feel like
nobody understands me but...

1654
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:18,723
Me.

1655
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,831
I get you.

1656
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:28,435
That's wonderful.
But, you know,
my bladder is about to pop.

1657
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:30,739
Can you hold it for a minute?

1658
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:37,478
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, guys.
Where were we?

1659
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:41,611
With the tuna pasta
and the tuna noodle doodles,

1660
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:42,951
tuna sandwiches, tuna...

1661
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:45,322
I love your eyes.

1662
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:48,925
I even love

1663
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:52,632
your mother.

1664
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:34,240
MILLY: Well, we gotta
get this show on the road.
MAGGIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1665
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:36,367
Where is she?
Well, it should have started
20 minutes ago.

1666
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,503
That's not like her.
I mean, the ceremony
has to start soon.

1667
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:39,944
I don't know
where she is, though.

I'm worried.
I hope she's okay.

1672
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:47,784
Just call her.
All right. I'm calling.

1673
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:49,755
It's her own wedding.

Oh, no.

No.

Hi, honey.

1677
01:33:58,165 --> 01:34:00,656
Hi, Mom. Where are you?

1678
01:34:01,902 --> 01:34:05,099
Honey, I just have to
talk to you a little
bit later, okay? Mil...

1679
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:08,972
Oh, my God. I kind of think
she's having sex
with Joe right now.

1680
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:10,169
Great.
Awesome.

1681
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:13,145
Would she like us to explain
that to all the guests,
or just the preacher?

1682
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:14,704
She is a woman after
my own heart.

1683
01:34:14,782 --> 01:34:17,512
All right, Mom?
We are gonna give you
five more minutes.

1684
01:34:17,585 --> 01:34:19,109
Ten. Ten.

1685
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:20,517
Mom. Come on.

1686
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:22,613
Open up
the champagne, sweetie.
What's the rush?

1687
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,624
Because I said so.
