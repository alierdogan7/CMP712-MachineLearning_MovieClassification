1
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:06,543
Huh? Amazing, right?

2
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:08,590
- Yeah.
- Bathroom.

3
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:09,609
Bedrooms.

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:10,644
Nice.

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,335
Views of other
bedrooms and bathrooms.

6
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:16,307
I really appreciate you
letting me crash here, bud.

7
00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:17,740
Are you kidding?
You're doing us a favor.

8
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:20,347
No flush Tony
just moved out last week.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,489
You're sure this
isn't a problem?

10
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:23,590
Seriously, the best day
of my life

11
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,459
was when I heard you got
traded to the rangers.

12
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,357
You're family. My place
is your place, man.

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,590
Technically, it's my place.

14
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:31,693
Okay, and next time I say,

15
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:33,662
"Hey, let me
help you with that,"

16
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:36,765
let's try
"No thanks, I got it."

17
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,671
You look like an eater.

18
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,510
So, just so we're clear,

19
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:43,710
the left side
of the fridge is mine.

20
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:47,349
I got it.
Tucker, come on.

21
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:48,783
My brother
and my best friend--

22
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:50,651
It's never gonna get
any better than this.

23
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,355
The three of us together,

24
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,390
there's nothing
that's gonna stop us.

25
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:00,464
Except for maybe that.

26
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:05,302
There's a baby on my doormat.

27
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:10,740

30
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,684
where did it come from?

31
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,620
<i>I don't know.</i>

32
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,389
But whoever left it,
they couldn't have gotten far.

33
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,459
Stay there, baby.

34
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:33,493
Make sure she stays there!

35
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:39,700
I'm just saying,

36
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:41,468
for a woman who
just had a baby,

37
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:42,803
she moves remarkably fast.

38
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,606
How could she just
leave her here?

39
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:46,674
Ben, you gotta calm down, okay?

40
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,810
I'm sure she's not even
your baby.

41
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:50,344
Exactly, it could
just as easily

42
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,445
be your baby, right?

43
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,483
Not so much, no.

44
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,685
And I've only been
in town an hour.

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,421
I mean, I'm fast, but...

46
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,621
I'm not that fast.

47
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,290
This is not my baby.

48
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,457
Wait, wait, wait!

49
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,625
Guys, we got a note.

50
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,693
Her name's Emma.

51
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,730
I don't know any Emmas.

52
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,533
The baby's name is Emma.

53
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,536
Hi, Emma.

54
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,640
Hey, Ben.
Did I ever tell you

55
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,709
about that hot waitress
I went out with named Emma?

56
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,511
Danny, focus!

57
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:25,546
The mother.

58
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,547
- Oh, yeah.
- Who's the mother?

59
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,748
Sorry, um,

60
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:28,782
Angela.

61
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,486
Angela!

62
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,321
- Of course.
- That's right.

63
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:35,322
Who is Angela?

64
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,557
She was nice. Actress.

65
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,558
That girl was crazy.

66
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,628
Does it say anything else?

67
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,330
Uh, she's sorry.

68
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,432
She didn't know
what else to do.

69
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,733
And she just needs
a little time.

70
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,368
Time? How much time?!

71
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,704
And that would be
the perfect amount of time.

72
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,705
Oh.

73
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,474
That's Riley.

74
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,675
I gave her a call
while you were outside.

75
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,377
Riley?

76
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,412
Fatpants Perrin?

77
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,413
What's she doing here?

78
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:02,383
You have a friend
named Fatpants?

79
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,753
Oh, I'm definitely
marking my food.

80
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:07,622
No.

81
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:09,491
Riley's in law school now.

82
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:10,559
It took her a while.

83
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:12,327
I guess the LSAT's
kind of tricky,

84
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:13,762
but trust me, she will
know what to do.

85
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:20,504
Ri-Gantor?

86
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:22,472
Ben-wetter!

87
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:23,574
Look at you.

88
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:26,376
You look amazing.

89
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,544
How did that happen?

90
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,414
I may have lost a pound or two.

91
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,448
Hundred.

92
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,750
You sat on my head and gave me

93
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:35,519
a concussion, remember?

94
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:37,754
Tuck, Riley.
Riley, Tucker.

95
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:39,323
Hi.

96
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:40,557
Riley grew up across
the street from us

97
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:41,658
and used to kick
the crap out of Ben

98
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:42,793
every day of his life.

99
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:44,762
Oh, and congrats
on the law school thing.

100
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:46,397
- Thanks.
- Don't worry--I know a bunch

101
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:47,632
of people that had
a hard time getting in.

102
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,670
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Why did you tell him that?

103
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:53,805
I didn't do anything.

104
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,343
Oh.

105
00:03:58,378 --> 00:03:59,678
Hey.

106
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:02,581
Hey, it's okay, princess.

107
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:05,651
Aren't you gonna pick her up?

108
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,721
Me?

109
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:09,722
What, you guys see breasts

110
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:11,557
and instantly think mommy?

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,694
Okay, fine.

112
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,530
Hi.

113
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:18,631
Okay.

114
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:20,599
Come here, angel.

115
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:22,434
Oh.

116
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:27,440
Hi.

117
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:29,809
Believe me,

118
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:31,477
I know how scary it is
to wake up

119
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:32,511
in a strange place.

120
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,352
I'm just making conversation.

121
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:43,754
Are you hungry?

122
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:45,489
I bet you're hungry, huh?

123
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:47,624
Let's see
what you got--

124
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,793
Is this all you
brought with you?

125
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:51,562
Oh, well, that's okay.

126
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,364
We'll just send
one of these boys out

127
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:54,765
for provisions and--

128
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,566
Oh...

129
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:58,369
I think somebody
needs her diaper changed.

130
00:04:58,403 --> 00:04:59,403
I'll go to the store.

131
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:00,371
Yeah, I'm going, too.

132
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,706
No.

133
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:06,744
Boys are so stupid,
aren't they?

134
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:08,380
Yes, they are.

135
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:09,647
They're so stupid.

136
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,282
<i>Yes, they are.</i>

137
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:12,617
All right, so then you just

138
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:14,618
stick the tabs down,

139
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:16,420
and voila,

140
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:17,655
she's good to go.

141
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:18,656
Oh.

142
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,657
Hold her while
I get her bottle ready,

143
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:20,658
- would you?
- Uh, me?

144
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:22,660
I'm not really a baby person.

145
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:24,729
Hold her.

146
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,475
Whee!

147
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,610
Isn't this fun?

148
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:41,345
There you go.

149
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,580
All right.

150
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,448
Want to maybe, uh,

151
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:45,716
take a step over here?

152
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:46,751
Is she okay?

153
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:47,752
Uh-huh.

154
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,389
Have a seat.

155
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:53,324
Oh.

156
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,759
Nice and easy.

157
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:57,828
Ah.

158
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:04,568
Is she having fun?

159
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:05,670
Yeah.

160
00:06:05,704 --> 00:06:07,371
You guys look comfy.

161
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:12,409
I can't believe
this is happening.

162
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,613
I'm not ready to be a dad.

163
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:18,615
What if Angela
never comes back?

164
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,783
Oh, my God, taste this.

165
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:25,623
Yo.

166
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:28,492
Chicken, carrots, and pasta.

167
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:30,328
Okay?

168
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:31,529
All in this little jar.

169
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:34,499
It's like, gross,

170
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,700
yet oddly delicious.

171
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,574
Come on, man.
It's gonna be okay.

172
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:42,609
How do you know?

173
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:44,410
I don't, but it's all I got.

174
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:46,747
Excuse me,

175
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,516
how old is your baby?

176
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,651
Oh, um...

177
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:51,651
That's a good question.

178
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:54,521
I met Angela at that
party in the village...

179
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:56,456
- Mm.
- And we dated for maybe six weeks

180
00:06:56,491 --> 00:06:57,457
before we were...

181
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:58,725
Intimate.

182
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:02,728
And she broke up with me

183
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:05,297
pretty much right after that.

184
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,399
I'm sure there was
no correlation.

185
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:10,368
So, we're into August now,

186
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:11,736
and they take,
like, nine months

187
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,271
once they're up and running.

188
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:14,272
I think so.

189
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:15,305
So...

190
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:23,612
Three months.

191
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,448
Three months!

192
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:26,515
My baby's three months old.

193
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,720
Mm-mm.

194
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,390
- Put this back.
- What?

195
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:35,391
She ain't got no teeth.

196
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:36,492
Put it back.

197
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:39,596
So, the first thing
Ben has to do

198
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,730
is take a paternity test.

199
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,667
I mean,

200
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,669
though it's pretty obvious
she's his.

201
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,571
Same smile,

202
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:50,739
<i>same ears,</i>

203
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:52,574
same little sparkly
fleck of yellow

204
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:53,709
in the iris.

205
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,380
What?

206
00:07:58,414 --> 00:07:59,447
Do I have something in my nose?

207
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:00,414
I know you guys think
that's funny,

208
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:01,615
but it's not.

209
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,517
You like Ben.

210
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,318
What?

211
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:06,453
No, that's insane.

212
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,354
I've tormented the guy
every day of my life.

213
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:09,355
Holy crap!

214
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,557
You really do like Ben.

215
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,259
We're back.

216
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:14,494
Hey. Ben,
you're not gonna believe

217
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:15,495
what Riley was just--

218
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,696
- Aah!
- How'd it go?

219
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,299
You guys left

220
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,367
and I realized I should have

221
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:21,368
given you a list.

222
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:22,636
Why? I mean,
everyone knows

223
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,504
you're not supposed to
give a baby solid food

224
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,572
until it's at least
four months old

225
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:26,573
and sitting up on its own.

226
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,707
That woman was mean.

227
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,578
I think we're all done here.

228
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,447
Oh, all right.

229
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,515
Just one good belch

230
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,582
and she's done.

231
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:36,751
I think you can
handle this part.

232
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:37,752
What, me? Right now?
Are you sure?

233
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:39,588
Hey, Tucker?

234
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:41,323
Oh, okay.

235
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:42,424
- Great. Danny?
- Yeah?

236
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,425
- You're in charge.
- Wait.

237
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:44,560
You're not leaving, are you?

238
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:45,595
- Yes.
- No, I'll be good. I promise.

239
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,330
I showed you
how to do everything.

240
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:48,631
Yeah, but I wasn't
paying attention.

241
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:49,665
You can't go.

242
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,400
Ben, tell Riley she can't go.

243
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,467
- You can't go.
- Bye.

244
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:54,436
Ooh, wow, Ben.

245
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:57,572
I never noticed how sparkly

246
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:58,773
your eyes are.

247
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:03,277
Please, Riley.

248
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,278
We'll never make it
through the night

249
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:05,279
without you.

250
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,357
Fine.

251
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:17,425
I'll stay.

252
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:22,464
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

253
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,700
Right?
Hey, she didn't spit up

254
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:25,734
on my shirt though, did she?

255
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:29,571
- No, looks good.
- No, no, you're great.

256
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,306
Brand new, bud.

257
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:32,541
Good. All right.

258
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,544
I should be back by five.

259
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:47,645
Wait. Where
are you going?

260
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,313
Uh, work.
I got a shift.

261
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:50,480
Wait, you couldn't get anyone
to cover for you?

262
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:52,416
Oh, see, that would have
been a good idea.

263
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,417
Too late now.

264
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,418
No, wait, bro.

265
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:55,485
Tuck and I are not
watching your kid.

266
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,187
Yeah.
The big guy's right.

267
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,321
I mean, there is no--

268
00:09:58,355 --> 00:09:59,422
Hey!

269
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,324
Thanks, man.
See you!

270
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,393
How does this
keep happening to me?

271
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:10,233
Whoa.

272
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:14,538
Oh.

273
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:19,210
Wow. Very impressive.

274
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,278
And who said you had
no discernable skills?

275
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:22,546
I think that was you.

276
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,351
Riley,
what am I supposed to do?

277
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:28,486
Well, there's not really
that much we can do

278
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:30,655
until Angela comes back.

279
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,224
But I think we should
probably talk about

280
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:33,625
the elephant in the room.

281
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,294
Which for once isn't me.

282
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,631
How much do you
want to be involved?

283
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:41,501
I don't know what I want.

284
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,535
Last year, I was
doing construction.

285
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,636
Before that,
I was waiting tables.

286
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,638
Now I'm flipping bottles.

287
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:49,307
I haven't figured
my life out yet.

288
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:50,308
I'm not you.

289
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:51,476
What does that mean?

290
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,244
Oh!
Come on.

291
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,378
College,

292
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:55,513
law school, this...

293
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:57,348
Transformation.

294
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:02,186
You see what you want
and you go for it.

295
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,654
Yeah.

296
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:04,689
Not always.

297
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,492
Oh!

298
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:09,461
Ice down my bra.

299
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:11,563
Hey.

300
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:13,299
I'm really sorry
I sat on your head

301
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,400
all those times.

302
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,602
Angela's back.

303
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:17,637
I'm on break, man.

304
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:21,373
I'm sorry I sat on your head.

305
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:22,508
Smooth move, Fatpants.

306
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,542
Yes.

307
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:26,545
Where is she?
Where's Angela?

308
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:27,613
First of all,

309
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:29,381
she woke up the baby.

310
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:32,450
Second, she wanted me

311
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,484
to give you that envelope.

312
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:35,553
You let her leave?

313
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:36,653
What's the matter with you?

314
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:38,354
Oh, I'm sorry.

315
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,590
My bad, but I was
a little preoccupied

316
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:42,425
raising your child.

317
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:46,729
Read it. I think
you'll be happy.

318
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,265
They're adoption papers.

319
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:50,700
She's putting Emma
up for adoption

320
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:52,602
and she needs me
to relinquish my rights.

321
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,607
If I sign this,
I'm not a father anymore.

322
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,576
Amazing, right?

323
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:02,445
Well, see, I'm not the only one

324
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,447
who's excited.

325
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:07,517
Yay! Whoo!

326
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:16,659
So, I sign this
and Emma has a new daddy?

327
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:18,193
Pretty much.

328
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,194
The letter says
they already have

329
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:20,296
a family lined up.

330
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:24,301
If I do this,

331
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:26,236
if I let her go,

332
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,337
I don't want to hear about it.

333
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,440
I never want to talk
about it again, okay?

334
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,542
- Okay.
- Okay.

335
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:36,381
Where is my precious
little grandbaby?

336
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,317
Mom, what are you doing here?

337
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:39,418
I'm a grandma!

338
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:40,586
- Hey, ma.
- Aah!

339
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,587
What is she doing here?

340
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:42,654
Did you tell her?

341
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:44,556
I didn't even tell her
I was here.

342
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:45,624
Oh, I'll get to you.

343
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:48,528
Oh.

344
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:49,696
Hi.

345
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,332
Oh, she is just

346
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:54,701
a big ol' pile of love.

347
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:56,503
Yeah, I really don't
think that's love

348
00:12:56,537 --> 00:12:57,571
that you're smelling.

349
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,475
Okay, who wants
to explain to me

350
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,578
why I had to hear
that I was a grandma

351
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:06,314
while I was
getting my nails done?

352
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:08,450
That Jennifer Perrin
couldn't wait

353
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:10,185
to let me have it.

354
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:11,620
Ever since that
Fatpants daughter of hers

355
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:13,422
got into law school
she's just--

356
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:18,495
Hi, Riley.

357
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:22,398
I didn't see you there.

358
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,268
You're so thin now,
you should wear a bell.

359
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,439
Oh.

360
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,277
Is this duct tape?

361
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,282
We were having a closure issue.

362
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:43,285
Oh, what, you couldn't
find a stapler?

363
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:44,352
Honestly.

364
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:46,288
I can't sign those papers now.

365
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:47,289
It's not gonna happen.

366
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:48,591
Hey, don't worry about mom.

367
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,226
You gotta do
what you think is right.

368
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,361
I'll totally back you up.

369
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,362
What papers?

370
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:53,630
You're on your own, bro.

371
00:13:58,369 --> 00:13:59,670
Mom...

372
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,271
I have some news.

373
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:02,572
Yeah. You knocked up
some girl

374
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:04,207
because you couldn't
figure out the basics

375
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,308
of birth control.

376
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:06,542
We're past that, honey, okay?

377
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:09,411
Mrs. Wheeler?

378
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:10,546
Bonnie.

379
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,547
- Really?
- Mrs. Wheeler.

380
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:15,350
Emma's mom wants to put
Emma up for adoption

381
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:17,252
and for Ben
to sign away his rights.

382
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:19,286
Really?

383
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:22,257
So you're--

384
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,325
you're thinking about
giving up this little girl?

385
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:27,295
Yeah, I was thinking about it.

386
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:31,199
Oh, good.

387
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:33,302
Good-- what do you
mean, good?

388
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:34,470
Oh, Ben, honey.

389
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:36,438
You can't begin to understand

390
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:37,673
the kind of sacrifice it takes

391
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:39,341
to be a parent.

392
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:40,442
When I married your father,

393
00:14:40,477 --> 00:14:41,443
and I had you two,

394
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:43,245
I had to put my dreams on hold.

395
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,514
- What dreams?
- Being single and childless.

396
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:49,486
Ben...

397
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,221
Honey, I love you,

398
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:53,290
but you can't raise
this little girl.

399
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,259
You haven't even finished
raising yourself.

400
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:56,527
You can't cook,

401
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,396
you're barely
paying your bills...

402
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,364
Honey, I still buy your pants.

403
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,604
This baby
needs a grown-up.

404
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,372
You gotta sign those papers.

405
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:18,114
9 am.

406
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:19,689
She'll be ready.

407
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:23,057
Done.

408
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:24,341
Somebody from
the adoption agency

409
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,177
will be here first thing
in the morning.

410
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:28,179
You okay?

411
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:30,482
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

412
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:32,217
Ben, if you don't
want to do this, man--

413
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:33,351
It doesn't matter.

414
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:35,321
Mom was right.

415
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:36,355
I couldn't raise this baby

416
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,456
even if I wanted to.

417
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,126
Bro, it's going to be okay.

418
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,161
It happened,

419
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:42,162
you dealt with it,

420
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:43,363
and now, like you said,

421
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:45,264
we're never talking
about this again.

422
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:48,501
I could have been a model.

423
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:52,470
But you've seen
your uncle Danny.

424
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:53,505
Yeah.

425
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:56,341
No body could
recover from that.

426
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:00,045
He was so big,

427
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,413
I had to have
a "c," "d," and "e" section.

428
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:07,051
No, don't.
I swear to God.

429
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:08,319
- Okay. Okay.
- No, I will hurt you.

430
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:09,353
Okay.

431
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:11,422
<i>So...</i>

432
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:13,157
Did you always like Ben?

433
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:15,125
Oh, my God, you're obsessed.

434
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:19,228
I don't know.
Kind of.

435
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:20,396
Guess I always thought
maybe someday,

436
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,431
but back then I just figured

437
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:23,266
I was too fat,
or too--

438
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,468
loud, or too hairy, or--

439
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:28,404
Okay, we're not making a list.

440
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,240
Well, you've grown
to be a beautiful

441
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:31,441
and successful woman--
I think you can

442
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:33,411
safely move on
from Ben Wheeler.

443
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:35,113
Why would I want to do that?

444
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:36,448
Uh, did you miss
the part in the story

445
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:37,449
about the baby?

446
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,284
The baby he doesn't
want to give up?

447
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,387
If that's true, then why
did he make that call?

448
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:43,122
Because his entire family

449
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:45,124
is telling him he can't do it.

450
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,125
If nobody believes in him,

451
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
how can he believe in himself?

452
00:16:47,194 --> 00:16:49,029
He can't do it alone.

453
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:50,230
You don't know that.

454
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,434
Oh, it's Ben.

455
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:55,435
Your mom's about
to leave him alone

456
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,436
with the baby.

457
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:57,437
You're going?

458
00:16:57,472 --> 00:16:59,540
"Alone" is in all caps.

459
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:02,276
Ow! Ow!

460
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,277
What was that for?

461
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:05,045
For making me
talk about my feelings.

462
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,280
You know I hate that.

463
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:08,048
And go easy on your brother,

464
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,150
okay?

465
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:11,051
He looks up to you.

466
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:13,019
In his eyes,
you have everything.

467
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:19,391
Not everything.

468
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:24,396
Wait, wait, wait!

469
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,396
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

470
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:27,332
You-- you gotta
give me a minute.

471
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:34,271
Maybe now I know
why I was traded.

472
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:38,375
You were right.

473
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:40,277
I didn't believe in him.

474
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:42,079
I didn't think he could do it.

475
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:43,447
So why are you telling me?

476
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,215
Because...

477
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,317
If you go in there
and help him,

478
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:48,385
he'll never believe
in himself, either.

479
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:52,358
Riley, Riley,
Riley, Riley, please?

480
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:55,294
She's hungry,
or thirsty, or tired.

481
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,463
I don't know,
I don't speak baby.

482
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:01,367
Tuck.

483
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,037
What is going on?

484
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:05,071
Vanessa and I
were at the movies

485
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:06,138
when Ben called and said

486
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:07,406
Emma's having
some kind of meltdown.

487
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:09,375
I don't think
Emma's the problem.

488
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:10,442
Tucker, I swear

489
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:12,311
if you're not home
in two seconds...

490
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,146
I'm gonna eat all your food.

491
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,013
Tucker?!

492
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,050
Okay!

493
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:21,318
Turn it off!

494
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:38,335
Okay.

495
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,138
So, it looks like
it's just gonna be

496
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:42,239
you and me, huh?

497
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:45,509
Guess we're really
gonna do this thing.

498
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:49,013
Okay.

499
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:50,182
Okay, Emma, hi.

500
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:51,416
Hi, baby.

501
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:52,451
Come on, it's okay.

502
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:56,255
Please don't break,
please don't break,

503
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,357
please don't break.

504
00:18:57,391 --> 00:18:58,358
Okay.

505
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:00,994
Okay. It's okay.

506
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:02,062
It's okay.

507
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,430
It's okay.

508
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:05,232
It's okay, Emma.

509
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,366
Daddy's here.

510
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:07,368
It's okay.

511
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,071
Aah.

512
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,106
It's okay.

513
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,244
I'm telling you,
there is no way.

514
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:19,279
Bodily functions
make him queasy.

515
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:20,414
He can do it.

516
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:22,048
Where's your faith, man.

517
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:25,452
See?

518
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:28,087
Here you go.

519
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:29,355
There.

520
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:30,989
Okay.

521
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:32,224
Hi. Hi.

522
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:44,502
Hi.

523
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:47,405
Emma?

524
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:50,175
Please eat.

525
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,177
Come on, Emma.

526
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:53,312
Look, look, Emma, it's good.

527
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:54,379
It's good.

528
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,215
Mmm.

529
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:00,352
Oh, total lie.

530
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:02,421
It's actually quite disgusting.

531
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,256
No wonder you don't
want to eat.

532
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:08,394
Please eat.

533
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:11,397
Come on, Emma.
Just a sip, okay?

534
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:13,432
Come on.

535
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:16,035
Okay, come on.

536
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,302
Come on, you have to eat.

537
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:19,405
I'm begging you.

538
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,073
Come--

539
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,056
What?

540
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:40,091
You like that?

541
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,427
Look what daddy can do.

542
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:45,061
Huh?

543
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:47,163
I do this at work every day.

544
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:48,331
Huh?

545
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:49,432
You want some now?

546
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:51,267
You want some?

547
00:20:51,302 --> 00:20:52,368
Here it comes.

548
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:53,436
Here it comes, baby.

549
00:20:57,374 --> 00:21:00,108
Oh, my God, you're eating.

550
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:03,011
Thank you so much.

551
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:05,246
Holy crap,

552
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:06,247
now I'm crying.

553
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,051
Crap. Don't say crap.

554
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:12,220
Don't use swear words.

555
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,456
Oh, I can't believe
you're eating.

556
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:21,063
You're so cute.

557
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:28,565
Hey, wake up.

558
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,267
Dude, you're drooling on me.

559
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:31,335
Oh.

560
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:33,270
Ahh...

561
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:34,271
Boo!

562
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,106
Ooh.

563
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:40,444
Hey.

564
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:42,179
Hey. You okay?

565
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:43,247
Yeah.

566
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:46,150
I think I want to do this.

567
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:48,520
I can't let her go.

568
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:51,121
I love her.

569
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:55,292
Did you guys hear me?

570
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,326
Yeah.

571
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:57,326
Yeah, we heard you.

572
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:58,361
You should probably
call the agency.

573
00:21:58,429 --> 00:21:59,429
It's almost 7:00.

574
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,532
Come on, mi amor.

575
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:02,532
Here we go.

576
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:04,809
Ooh, somebody could use a bath.

577
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:07,871
Oh. You both could.

578
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:09,105
I'm gonna go get a bottle ready.

579
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:10,473
But I want to give
it to her, okay?

580
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,474
We're really gonna have to get

581
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:12,542
on some kind of schedule though.

582
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:13,861
- For real.
- What do you mean?

583
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:15,445
Well, we have a
baby now so I mean,

584
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:16,713
we kind of have to be adults.

585
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,449
Okay. I'll do the shopping.

586
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:20,518
Okay, but
let's talk about...

587
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:22,400
