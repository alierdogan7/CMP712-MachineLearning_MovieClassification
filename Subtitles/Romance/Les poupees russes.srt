1
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,595
<i>Voilà! I'm on the road again...</i>

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,355
Shit!

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,639
<i>Battery depleted.</i>

4
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,360
<i>Thirty years old...</i>
<i>You gotta take stock.</i>

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,596
<i>If I look at my life,</i>
<i>it's not impressive.</i>

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,628
<i>What've I done?</i>

7
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,875
<i>I was madly in love with one girl.</i>
<i>Martine.</i>

8
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,673
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,114
<i>Then I was madly in love</i>
<i>with another. Neus.</i>

10
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,356
<i>Okay...</i>

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,278
<i>this story's already a big mess.</i>

12
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,278
<i>That's because I'm a mess.</i>

13
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,588
<i>Let me sort things out.</i>

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,316
<i>"Writing is sorting out</i>
<i>the mess of life. "</i>

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,877
<i>I'm not telling this in order.</i>
<i>Order's a real mess.</i>

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,796
<i>So, that's me.</i>
<i>Last month, in Russia, for a wedding.</i>

17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,793
<i>Those are people I used to know.</i>

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,797
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>
<i>Five years ago,</i>

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,751
<i>I went to Barcelona</i>
<i>to study economics.</i>

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,599
<i>I met them all there.</i>

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,751
<i>We shared an apartment for a year.</i>

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,549
<i>We lost touch, then reconnected</i>
<i>here, in Saint Petersburg.</i>

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,193
<i>Because William, that guy,</i>
<i>is marrying a Russian, Natasha.</i>

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,870
<i>Her.</i>

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,268
<i>A monumental event</i>
<i>is about to take place in my life.</i>

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,477
<i>Something really fundamental.</i>

27
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,759
<i>But to explain why</i>
<i>this thing's so fundamental to me,</i>

28
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,031
<i>let's jump back a year.</i>

29
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,471
RUSSIAN DOLLS

30
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,629
<i>Voilà! Now, I write.</i>

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,718
<i>My job is telling stories.</i>

32
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,637
<i>But this woman has heard</i>
<i>some of my best stories.</i>

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,434
<i>Mrs. V., my bank officer.</i>

34
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,631
They can't pay me for two months.

35
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,315
But they said...
And this will interest you.

36
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,399
Because I'm like you.
I said,

37
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,031
"That's scandalous! You can't do that.

38
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,709
"France has strict laws
protecting writers."

39
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,957
I was very, very angry.

40
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,793
What is of interest here?

41
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,998
Well, they said,

42
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,513
since they couldn't pay me
in a timely fashion,

43
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,313
when they do pay me,

44
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,717
they'll take a "late penalty"
into account.

45
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,832
Meaning? I don't understand.

46
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,194
Since they're late,
they'll pay me more.

47
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,635
How much more?

48
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,076
I think they said, "Much, much more."

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,560
<i>So my job is to play a merry tune.</i>

50
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,629
We typically need writers like you
for personalities

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,911
who are writing their memoirs

52
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,316
and can't put two words together.

53
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,272
Can you do that?

54
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,309
Ghostwriting?

55
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,759
Yes... no... that's...

56
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,158
Sure, I can be a ghostwriter.

57
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,270
I think...

58
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,232
I preferred to work there.

59
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,750
I can ghostwrite for anyone.

60
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,438
I love fiction
when it's connected to reality...

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,431
There was a huge amount
of work there...

62
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,558
<i>So that's the job!</i>
Know what I mean?

63
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,990
<i>Now I'm working</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

64
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,397
Plum has a roundness, a warmth,

65
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,553
a certain femininity, yet elegance...

66
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,115
Some guys like hot dog or freestyle.

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,198
So you need different gear.

68
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,993
Hardware's always been reliable.

69
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,078
OS X makes the difference.

70
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,954
- You mean the equipment?
- No, the ride.

71
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,919
It's chic, not la-di-da.
Hip, yet cool.

72
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,557
- For me, you gotta go freestyle.
- That's color!

73
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,071
Doesn't that kill the trees?

74
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,835
So...

75
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,350
Do you trim them several times a year?

76
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,351
- What do you think?
- Yes? No?

77
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,676
I don't know. I have no idea.

78
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,031
Do grapes grow in winter?

79
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,119
You've been busting my balls
for an hour.

80
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,278
I'm a Parisian,
I don't know this plant shit.

81
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,113
I'm like you,
I got a boring shit job.

82
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,598
I don't give a fuck.
If my questions are stupid,

83
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,678
don't answer and I'll take off!

84
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,632
A little on edge, are we?

85
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,879
Sorry. I haven't slept,

86
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,309
I'm having a shitty day.

87
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,999
Yeah, I'm on edge.

88
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,835
- You Parisians!
- Stop! Enough!

89
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,155
Laurent!

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,315
Stop! That side's fine.
The façade's clear!

91
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,436
- When's your shit due?
- In two weeks.

92
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,951
<i>People seem to think</i>
<i>I'm good at love stories.</i>

93
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,598
We're doing a special "love series"
by young writers this summer.

94
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,154
Oh, I'd love to.

95
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,271
<i>So it's gone pretty well this year.</i>
<i>I even got a TV script to write.</i>

96
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,794
<i>Sort of the ultimate!</i>

97
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,116
We read your story with great interest.

98
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,998
It has enormous quality,
but a few scenes

99
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,395
did make us flinch.

100
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,273
More than flinch, even.

101
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,276
Scene 57.

102
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,318
Why doesn't John Edward kiss Odile
during the thunderstorm?

103
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,636
Yes, why? We want them to kiss.

104
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,399
I want them to kiss.

105
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,558
I don't know.
I didn't want to be too cliché.

106
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,435
We so expect it, it's more interesting
if they don't kiss.

107
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,997
But why deprive the audience
of that pleasure?

108
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,079
It airs over the holidays.

109
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,115
It's a marvelous gift to our viewers.
Don't be afraid of clichés.

110
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,229
I more than agree.

111
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,234
It's a sequel.
<i>Wooded Bliss</i> was a huge hit.

112
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,513
The audience is clamoring for
<i>Love Passion in Venice.</i> Go for it.

113
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,477
Everyone's dying to see how John Edward
and Odile finally fall in love.

114
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,996
John Edward's handsome,
Odile's beautiful,

115
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,238
they're in Venice,
the most beautiful city in the world!

116
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,999
Let yourself go, Xavier!

117
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,873
We all love postcards.

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,674
We all love sunsets.
Why deny us that?

119
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,872
Put them in gondolas!

120
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,511
I must sell Wooded Bliss.

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,228
But why, John Edward?

122
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,836
Why?

123
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,309
I'm getting a divorce.

124
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,268
Does your wife know?

125
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,589
Yes.

126
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,313
I've told her everything.

127
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,476
But that's marvelous.

128
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,595
Ridiculous!

129
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,189
<i>Yes, marvelous...</i>

130
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,556
- It's not ridiculous.
- Come on...

131
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,514
You hate love stories.
Lots of people love them.

132
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,233
It's not ridiculous to them.

133
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,033
So, you're doing the sequel?

134
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,956
<i>I love you.</i>

135
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,719
Well, I hope it pays well.

136
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,356
It pays better than my articles.

137
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,312
So it's <i>adios</i> to your book?

138
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,716
I can't do everything at once.

139
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,149
Did you like it, Lucas?

140
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,873
I liked it a lot.

141
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,396
<i>Maybe it's not what I dreamed of.</i>

142
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,073
<i>But it's a stepping-stone.</i>
<i>I'm learning a ton.</i>

143
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,959
But who can that be?

144
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,109
Are you expecting anyone?

145
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,594
<i>I wrote a book,</i> L'Auberge Espagnole,
<i>5 years ago.</i>

146
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,635
<i>I haven't found a publisher,</i>
<i>but I still have hope.</i>

147
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,035
<i>Barbara, what does this mean?</i>

148
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,268
<i>I knew I'd find you here.</i>

149
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,230
<i>So, she's the one!</i>

150
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,913
<i>You disappoint me.</i>
<i>I thought she'd at least be...</i>

151
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,511
Yes.

152
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,916
Yes, who? Yes, what?
Can't you say who you are?

153
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,714
Everyone else does, why can't you?

154
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,230
What do you want me to say?
"It's your mommy?"

155
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,909
Everyone else does.
Why can't you?

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,675
Gimme a break!
You want me to be like everyone else.

157
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,790
It's grampa...

158
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,990
Hold on.

159
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,239
I was sure you'd forget.

160
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,791
Hi, it's Martine.

161
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,229
I'm on the other line.

162
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,316
Quick!

163
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,829
Okay, go ahead.

164
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,270
- About tonight...
- Oh, happy birthday.

165
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,959
You didn't forget?

166
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,196
You done?

167
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,358
Mom, hold on. It's Martine.
It's her birthday.

168
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,075
Wish her happy birthday for me.

169
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,318
My mother says, "Happy birthday."

170
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,557
<i>- Tell her "thanks."</i>
- What time tonight?

171
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,158
- He expects you for dinner tonight.
<i>- Hold on, mom. Not you.</i>

172
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,192
I don't know, nine.

173
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,549
That works.

174
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,870
I gotta go.

175
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,036
<i>Xavier!</i>

176
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,674
Hold on. Not you, mom.

177
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,356
Give me...

178
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,956
The code.

179
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,914
<i>My new door code is 20B 10.</i>

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,592
Okay, I've really gotta go...

181
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,311
Mom, hold on!

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,111
- Hi, Mrs. Lopez.
- You have to pick up your mail.

183
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,516
It's been piling up for a week.

184
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,151
Can I borrow a DVD?

185
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,879
You done yet?

186
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,597
I caught you off guard the other day,
and now I'm a little off guard...

187
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,756
Coming, mom.

188
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,389
I'll stop back later.

189
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,550
All clear? Can I talk now?

190
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,955
<i>Is it my turn?</i>

191
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,356
<i>You've got grampa tonight.</i>

192
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,391
I'll be there!

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,956
<i>My neighbor, Mr. Boubaker,</i>

194
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,953
<i>is the most uninteresting guy on earth.</i>

195
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,275
Hey...

196
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,875
You know what?

197
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,912
The Big Bang theory doesn't work.

198
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,353
They said on the radio this morning
it may not be true.

199
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,278
Well, no one knows for sure.

200
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,629
<i>If he only knew.</i>

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,719
<i>When I write a story,</i>
<i>I always think of Mr. Boubaker.</i>

202
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,550
<i>I try to imagine the scene</i>
<i>with "Mr. Average Guy."</i>

203
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,471
<i>That's him! "Mr. Average Guy."</i>

204
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,389
<i>It's rare to meet one.</i>
<i>There aren't that many in real life.</i>

205
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,432
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

206
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,078
- But who can it be?
- I don't know.

207
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,395
Oh, Barbara, what does this mean?

208
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,432
I thought I'd find you here.

209
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,589
So, she's the one.

210
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,955
You disappoint me.

211
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,718
I thought she'd at least be...

212
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,235
She'd be what?

213
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,238
Yeah, she'd be what?

214
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,110
Excuse me.

215
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,239
What's your girlfriend like?

216
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,238
It's not for my girlfriend.

217
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,033
I don't have a girlfriend.

218
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,073
What's this girl
who's not your girlfriend like?

219
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,311
She's a little shorter than you.

220
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,796
She has smaller... I mean...

221
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,316
I think she's size one or two.

222
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,910
It depends. Is she thinner than I am?

223
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,148
Is she like that girl?

224
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,197
No.

225
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,596
She's more like her.

226
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,508
But not as ugly.

227
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,554
Take the two.

228
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,152
Your girlfriend can always exchange it.

229
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,073
The register's over there.

230
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,910
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>I've been a bachelor for a year.</i>

231
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,634
I love your hair.

232
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,959
I prefer that you leave.

233
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,950
Really?

234
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,114
I'm sorry, I'm very modest.

235
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,159
Look, I've gotta run.

236
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,513
Okay, I'm going!

237
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,916
I wasn't chasing you out.

238
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,874
Don't sweat it. I'm outta here!

239
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,399
That was great. I had a blast.
Thanks a lot.

240
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,038
Why are you talking like that?

241
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,351
Because I'm a big jerk.

242
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,109
<i>So...</i>

243
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,236
<i>I just wanted to say</i>
<i>I'm a bachelor...</i>

244
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,557
Bye.

245
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,394
Not to be too insistent...
this really isn't for my girlfriend.

246
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,278
It's no biggie. Who cares?

247
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,710
I don't have a girlfriend.

248
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,911
It's for my ex. For her birthday.

249
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,953
I'll give you my number.

250
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,196
For?

251
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,470
I don't know.

252
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,275
If the dress doesn't fit,
you can call me.

253
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,715
No, I don't know.

254
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,833
I've always dreamed of doing that
but I never dared.

255
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,430
With you, I thought I should dare.

256
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,669
Take it, 'cause I feel like a jerk.

257
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,549
I'll jot it down.

258
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,799
But you have to call tonight.
Or you never will.

259
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,470
There.

260
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,870
I don't know.

261
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,116
Yes, yes!

262
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,273
You've got nothing to lose.

263
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,278
If I were you, I'd call me.

264
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,314
I also wrote an article for snowb...

265
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,233
for a magazine about winter sports.

266
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,439
What about your novel?

267
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,790
Yeah.

268
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,797
I'm trying, but it's not easy.

269
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,152
At least these little jobs

270
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,431
help me pay the rent.

271
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,148
This is temporary.

272
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,839
Be careful.

273
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,510
Sometimes these temporary things
can last a long time.

274
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,356
Meaning?

275
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,835
Don't forget to write important things.

276
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,349
You're good at that. You always were.

277
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,231
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

278
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,629
I'll tell Aïcha.

279
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,795
So, little Xavier,
when do I get to meet your fiancée?

280
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,036
Uh, yeah...

281
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,870
Well, yeah, that's right...

282
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,394
I'm a size one. You know that!

283
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,069
You think I'm fat.

284
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,317
It's okay. I can exchange it.

285
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,313
I never wear dresses.

286
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,989
Why do you girls have
such a problem with dresses?

287
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,679
First, I'm not "girls."

288
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,998
I wear pants.
It's more practical on a bike.

289
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,872
Anyway, thank you very much.

290
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,469
It's...

291
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,192
No, it's pretty. Really.

292
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,438
Now you'll say I'm a pain.

293
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,829
You're a pain.

294
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,875
No, thanks.

295
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,116
Really?

296
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,271
By the way...

297
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,077
there's the Social Forum.

298
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,874
It's in Porto Alegre, in Brazil.

299
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,039
I can't miss that.

300
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,589
Could you maybe?

301
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,357
I can take care of Lucas.

302
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,358
Does he ever see his father?

303
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,751
I'd rather not discuss it.

304
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,949
It's that bad?

305
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,910
Yeah.

306
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,715
You with anyone?

307
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,155
No.

308
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,032
- You?
- No.

309
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,553
Hello, thirties!

310
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,115
Kassia?

311
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,636
Oh, yeah!

312
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,270
How are you?

313
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,677
I'm glad you called.
Sure I know who you are!

314
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,159
No, no bother at all.

315
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,188
What are you doing?

316
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,235
Good morning.

317
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,874
More coffee?

318
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,071
No, I really have to go.

319
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,113
I just wanted to say...

320
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,110
What?

321
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,435
It's stupid. I just wanted to say...

322
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,119
I never do that.

323
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,750
We'll talk later?

324
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,875
You in love?

325
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,998
Something's going on.

326
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,596
I really like black girls.

327
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,634
You like anything with a pussy!

328
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,389
Why'd you say that?

329
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,513
You cruise every chick on the street.

330
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,829
But me, I don't get the time of day!

331
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,191
- Stop!
- Stop what?

332
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,676
I'm really embarrassed to ask,
but I'm in deep shit.

333
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,954
Thomas got dumped by his girlfriend.

334
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,511
He's taking the apartment back.

335
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,874
Can I stay with you or?

336
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,588
No problem, Xavier.

337
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,279
- Oh, really?
- What?

338
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,790
He moves in
and you don't even ask me?

339
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,311
No! You piss me off.
All you do is give me shit!

340
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,114
It's my place
and I don't need your permission

341
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,799
to invite a friend over.

342
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,956
If it's not the moment...

343
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,071
Fine.

344
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,475
Carol!

345
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,070
I'm really mortified. I hope...

346
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,029
No, it's fine.

347
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,799
It's just fine.

348
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,198
Cool. When are you coming?

349
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,915
Xavier?

350
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,429
You're here already!

351
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,790
Cool! All moved in?

352
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,956
Yeah.

353
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,475
Great.

354
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,475
I won't bother you guys. I've got work.

355
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,432
No sweat. We broke up.

356
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,996
We're both bachelors now, buddy.

357
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,475
- Great!
- Cool, huh?

358
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,239
- Great!
- How about a beer?

359
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,709
Come on in.

360
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,229
I'm impressed.

361
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,910
You like it?

362
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,749
It's really nice!

363
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,069
There's Xavier.

364
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,074
- I think you met.
- Oh, right.

365
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,515
I remember.

366
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,189
Well, I'm...

367
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,115
I'll show you around.

368
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,310
It's really nice.

369
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,795
Well, it's not...

370
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,434
Did you decorate it?

371
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,473
Come, see the bedroom.

372
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,273
Right over here.

373
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,988
Make yourself at home.

374
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,628
Careful, it'll fall.

375
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,635
See them, Lucas?

376
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,870
That doesn't hurt the trees.
It makes them stronger.

377
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,953
Take my number.
I'll stop by and we can discuss it.

378
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,151
- That's so nice.
- Not at all.

379
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,509
06...

380
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,429
Come on!

381
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,068
Thank you!

382
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,678
That's so nice.
I didn't know what to do.

383
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,031
You have to take care of flowers!

384
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,434
It's crazy!
People think nature just grows.

385
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,791
We humans have to nurture it.

386
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,352
And euphorbia...
People always over-water them.

387
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,394
Even once a week is too much.

388
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,436
I'll stop by.

389
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,754
<i>Not only does she hook up</i>
<i>with this guy, "Mr. Plane Tree,"</i>

390
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,877
<i>then she sends me up shit creek</i>
<i>without a paddle.</i>

391
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,874
Two seconds.

392
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,119
<i>So, that was the day</i>
<i>she left for Brazil.</i>

393
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,035
<i>As if my life</i>
<i>wasn't already a mess.</i>

394
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,675
"Happy to have finally found her prince,
she agreed to marry him.

395
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,516
"The wedding went on for a week,

396
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,235
"and all the kingdom was invited.

397
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,430
"They had a beautiful castle

398
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,472
"and lived happily ever after."

399
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,874
Go to sleep now, Lucas.
Wanna go pee-pee?

400
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,231
Don't you wanna go pee-pee first?

401
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,351
Hasn't mommy found her prince yet?

402
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,155
Well, I don't really know.

403
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,917
- Has she mentioned it?
- No.

404
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,674
Then I guess
she hasn't found him. But...

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,798
she's beautiful, she's intelligent...

406
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,116
<i>If he knew</i>
<i>how much I'd loved his mother.</i>

407
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,191
<i>I guess Martine hasn't told him.</i>

408
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,758
<i>How do you explain that?</i>

409
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,840
I've been with seven guys, uh...
seven princes.

410
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,796
I've lived in different castles.

411
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,674
Xavier was the fourth prince.

412
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,674
At the moment,

413
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,590
I've got a bunch of princes going.

414
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,188
I don't know... I hesitate.

415
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,517
Last week, I met one at a club.

416
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,558
Like a ball, a great ball.

417
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,639
I really like him.

418
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,871
He doesn't have a huge castle
but he's got a big motorcycle.

419
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,913
You'd like that.

420
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,112
It's complicated...

421
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,715
Even if things go well,
it's still a little too soon to...

422
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,518
to know if there'll be a wedding.

423
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,149
And then

424
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,795
some people

425
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,078
in the kingdom say,

426
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,471
if he's the one,
they won't come to the wedding.

427
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,232
Don't cry, mommy.

428
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,559
Mommy!

429
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,396
What's the matter?

430
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,594
- Don't you want your apple?
- No.

431
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,995
There's some left!

432
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,069
You don't want anymore.

433
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,548
Look who's here!

434
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,076
It's mommy!

435
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,749
My sweetie pie!

436
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,275
You okay?

437
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,710
Hi.

438
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,395
<i>Tudo bem?</i>

439
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,235
He was really sick.
He's gotta go to bed.

440
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,476
Really?

441
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,555
I'll put him to bed. I'm wiped out.

442
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,279
So, what happened?

443
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,669
The doctor came because I was sick.

444
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,916
Really?

445
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,353
So how was Porto Alegre?

446
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,517
It was great!

447
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,871
There were 216 countries there!

448
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,869
Every continent!
Chili, Mali, Montenegro...

449
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,514
Tibet!

450
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,755
It was so moving just to be there.

451
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,317
It really makes you feel
connected to the planet.

452
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,319
Did you all agree
to save a doomed world?

453
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,949
Hold on!

454
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,751
Give me shit if you want to, but...

455
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,597
globalization
isn't only generating progress.

456
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,397
We have to unite to fight against
disasters that could become inevitable.

457
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,751
You've got the schpeel down.

458
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,708
What's your problem?

459
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,758
While you're saving the world,
I take care of your kid,

460
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,917
I haven't slept in three nights
and I...

461
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,713
You what?

462
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,992
You've done zip with your life.

463
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,077
Me?

464
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,710
With those sappy stories of yours?

465
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,878
You lull silly schoolgirls
into dreamland.

466
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,356
"They kiss before the sunset..."

467
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,716
Bullshit.

468
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,594
But what do they dream about?
Pieces of shit.

469
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,749
You know what?
Your work is a load of crap.

470
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,792
It's been crap for two years.

471
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,511
And I know you're better than that.

472
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,279
Wait a minute, I...

473
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,752
You don't give a shit.
You get your lousy two bits,

474
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,236
you're nice and cozy with that.

475
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,713
So you make fun of people who move,
who fight against pollution,

476
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,515
against exclusion, against violence.

477
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,552
Against real things in the real world!

478
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,751
It's easy for you to laugh at that.

479
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,315
That's for sure!

480
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,989
I don't laugh.

481
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,395
You're a parasite.

482
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,797
- I'm a what?
- A parasite.

483
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,639
Happy as a clam,

484
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,230
telling insipid love stories.

485
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,953
That's how it should be!

486
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,629
Don't change a thing.

487
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,228
That seems to satisfy you.

488
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,636
Xavier...

489
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,679
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

490
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,995
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

491
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,799
I'm sorry. Really.

492
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,388
And thanks for Lucas.

493
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,272
What's wrong, John Edward?

494
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,390
Nothing.

495
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,832
Yes, there is.
I can see something's wrong.

496
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,399
I have a terrible secret.

497
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,315
What do you mean?

498
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,754
The company's bankrupt.
I haven't a cent.

499
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,638
The bank called, I'm drowning.

500
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,476
<i>But how?</i>

501
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,957
<i>Venice. It was your dream,</i>
<i>I couldn't let you down.</i>

502
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,953
I have a terrible secret.

503
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,355
What do you mean?

504
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,673
I'm having an affair with Sarah.

505
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,392
<i>How could you do that to me?</i>

506
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,639
My mother's ill,
your dad sold the company

507
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,433
and I've had a car accident.

508
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,916
That's awful!

509
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,000
I have a twin brother, John Sebastian.

510
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,600
- We look exactly alike.
- And?

511
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,628
I'm not me, Odile.

512
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,196
I'm the twin.

513
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,796
What does that mean?

514
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,589
I don't know.

515
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,479
- Wanna go?
- Maybe.

516
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,590
You okay?

517
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,117
How can I write a love story?

518
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,070
I know nothing about love.

519
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,191
I'm a self-centered egotist.

520
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,838
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

521
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,548
Careful! Hold me tight.

522
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,478
I've got you. Wait!

523
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,834
Let's go. Be careful.

524
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,674
- You okay?
- Fine.

525
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,151
Watch it here. We have to stop.

526
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,154
We have to wait for the second light.

527
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,158
- Okay.
- Careful!

528
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,315
It's dangerous.

529
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,280
By the way,
when do I get to meet your fiancée?

530
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,479
- I forgot!
- What do you mean? It's important.

531
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,670
Yeah, I know.

532
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,517
<i>"When do I get to meet</i>
<i>your fiancée?"</i>

533
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,953
<i>I don't know why but</i>
<i>that question started to obsess me.</i>

534
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,311
<i>I had to find the right girl fast,</i>

535
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,908
<i>before he died.</i>

536
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,956
Hello, Kassia?

537
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,639
Oh, I'm sorry.

538
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,433
Really?
When's she due back from Senegal?

539
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,559
Really?

540
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,592
No big deal. It's Xavier.

541
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,313
Thanks. Bye.

542
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,715
What is it?

543
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,672
Can you come here a sec?

544
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,950
Coming.

545
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,075
So, I...

546
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,032
You okay? Have a good day?

547
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,994
- Great.
- What's up?

548
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,639
I have a huge favor to ask.

549
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,072
Something you'll hate.
But you absolutely have to say yes.

550
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,236
What?

551
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,592
Somewhere in your closet,
do you have a dress?

552
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,029
A dress?

553
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,755
Never mind, it'll never work.

554
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,556
- It'll be a nightmare.
- I don't have a dress.

555
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,793
- What would I do with a dress?
- I'm sorry.

556
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,950
Stay calm. Don't freak out
and say, "I'm a dyke!"

557
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,276
Don't make it worse. I'm here!

558
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,390
Just a warning.

559
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,194
I'm already
a hair's breath from walking.

560
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,709
This is ridiculous.

561
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,115
Look at this thing.

562
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,436
Shall I go get them, darling?

563
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,034
No, we can go later...
Good evening!

564
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,594
After dinner.

565
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,475
But that's so very kind of you,
my dear.

566
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,397
Or we can blow off the whole thing.

567
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,354
It's so, so pretty here.

568
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,153
Don't talk like that.

569
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,795
- Quit fucking around!
- Isn't that what you want?

570
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,515
Stop! Concentrate.

571
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,235
Quit it!
I'm ringing the bell.

572
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,237
Go ahead.

573
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,512
What are you doing? I'm not ready!

574
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,517
Hello.

575
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,069
Hi, grampa.

576
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,714
Hello, sir.

577
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,719
I'm so happy to meet you. Come in!

578
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,354
Isabelle, grampa.

579
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,599
Delighted! Fuck!

580
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,632
- Careful!
- Sorry. Fuck.

581
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,831
Hello, my boy.

582
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,430
Follow me.

583
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,631
I'm so happy to meet you.

584
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,513
Me too. Really!

585
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,592
It's so, so, so pretty.

586
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,155
Isn't it?

587
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,350
Stop!

588
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,157
Want to know how old I am?

589
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,199
I'm 98. I've seen three wars.

590
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,713
That's incredible!
Extraordinary!

591
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,155
I was born in 1906.

592
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,239
But I won't bore you with all that.

593
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,558
Can you imagine
hearing my life story?

594
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,355
That'd take hours...

595
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,119
Let's talk about you, miss.

596
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,109
I'm so happy
my grandson has such a pretty fiancée!

597
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,908
Oh, no...

598
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,597
Oh, yes, I insist, very pretty.

599
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,552
Thank you, that's very kind of you.

600
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,992
So, tell me,
what do you do for a living?

601
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,518
Well...

602
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,955
So...

603
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,959
I work for a television station,

604
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,834
where I'm a financial journalist.

605
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,397
Well, what does that mean?

606
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,036
It means I work in the financial world.

607
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,795
I gather tidbits of information
on financial markets, stock options,

608
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,957
what's bought, what's sold.

609
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,551
Because traders
- people who work in the market -

610
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,593
need an enormous amount
of info... rmation

611
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,313
on an enormous number...

612
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,915
of things.

613
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,597
Who's interested in all that?

614
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,679
Lots and lots of people.

615
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,874
There are 450 assets management
firms in Paris alone.

616
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,435
It's a very competitive sector.

617
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,519
You gotta kick the other guy
in the balls.

618
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,519
Things move fast,
tons of money's at stake.

619
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,517
Once, I got a tip that
Asian markets were about to collapse.

620
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,871
I had to react like that!

621
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,391
For a trader,
that's an explosive situation.

622
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,954
You gotta be on the ball.

623
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,710
That info has gigantic repercussions
on the planet.

624
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,549
What?

625
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,589
I can't do this.

626
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,394
One hour. We're gonna eat. Please.

627
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,278
- Let's go.
- One little hour.

628
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,714
Now I see why you slipped away.

629
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,350
Dinner's ready.

630
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,790
Let's go to the table.

631
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,839
- Go ahead.
- No, you first.

632
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,909
Come on.

633
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,595
Water?

634
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,474
I feel dirty...

635
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,876
just pretending to be so clean.

636
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,438
Xavier,
the woman you want doesn't exist.

637
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,833
You've gotta grow up.
You want a princess or...

638
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,997
worse, a TV soap heroine!

639
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,198
Stop dreaming!
Princesses only exist in fairytales.

640
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,077
That was bullshit.

641
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,959
Why stop dreaming?

642
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,436
You wanna go out?

643
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,916
Yeah! Because now...

644
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,750
But this time I decide what we do.

645
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,198
I want her so, so pretty.

646
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,111
I'll think I'm king of the world.
No, thanks.

647
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,596
You're having fun!

648
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,516
Xavier's a cute little dish.

649
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,990
You're having fun!

650
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,069
You piggies!

651
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,833
- You okay?
- Yeah, great.

652
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,038
- She'll be beautiful!
- When'll my wife be ready?

653
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,029
Gimme a break.

654
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,918
That's better, isn't it?

655
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,599
Okay, I got it.

656
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,229
Shake your ass!

657
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,919
It suits him!

658
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,913
Have you met my wife?

659
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,870
Telephone.

660
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,434
Is this yours, cupcake?

661
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,148
Yeah, that's mine.

662
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,633
Hello? Xavier?

663
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,918
My pet...

664
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,395
No, that's Isabelle.

665
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,550
You okay?

666
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,596
Yeah. Why?

667
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,274
I don't know, you sound funny.

668
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,435
It's just...
Lucas' father just picked him up.

669
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,830
<i>That's great.</i>

670
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,192
He's sleeping over tonight and...

671
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,998
That's a good thing.

672
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,317
My wife's always on the phone.

673
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,236
That may be her lover.

674
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,588
And I'm all alone.

675
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,230
Who's calling you at this hour?

676
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,793
Your son shouldn't just see women.

677
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,552
Yeah, it's great.

678
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,476
But...

679
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,394
It's just that...

680
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,190
Can I come over?

681
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,988
Yeah, come over.

682
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,074
No, come over.

683
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,714
No bother at all.

684
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,796
Hi.

685
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,114
- You're wearing makeup?
- Really?

686
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,311
Yes, you are. It looks nice.

687
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,396
I see you girls are having fun.

688
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,509
So what's the matter?

689
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,152
- Martine, you okay?
- Hi.

690
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,430
How are you?

691
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,439
Good to see you. Come in.

692
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,676
Come on in.

693
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,794
It's really funny.
I just got <i>Martine Goes Camping.</i>

694
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,912
I didn't have that one.

695
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,478
Anyway, it's not easy.

696
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,475
We must seem like
uptight straight people.

697
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,519
That may be true.

698
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,474
I think that's a bad idea.

699
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,989
Just for tonight.

700
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,918
It's really not a good idea.

701
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,759
You are uptight, after all.

702
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,910
I'm not uptight. I just don't want to.

703
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,793
It's a question of wanting to.

704
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,472
I adore you, but I don't wanna
sleep with you. And neither do you.

705
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,152
I am a pain in the ass.

706
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,748
No, you're not.

707
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,519
I'll never find a guy.

708
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,398
You're right, I'm annoying.

709
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,793
I broke up with Bruno.

710
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,828
Did I mention him?

711
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,469
Sorry, they change so fast,
I can't keep track.

712
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,955
I don't get it. Since you,
I just don't meet guys who...

713
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,709
I don't know.

714
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,513
You expect too much.

715
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,197
You're looking for an ideal guy
who doesn't exist.

716
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,278
You're a big girl now, Martine.

717
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,154
Stop dreaming of "Mr. Perfect."

718
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,589
Do something!

719
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,596
Come on.

720
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,552
Let's go to my room.

721
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,718
Why are you crying?

722
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,910
Okay, you are a pain,
but you're beautiful, intelligent...

723
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,238
Lots of guys are crazy about you.

724
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,718
I don't give a shit about that.

725
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,272
What if you were a ball-breaker,
ugly, stupid

726
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,673
and no one was hot for you?
You're far from that.

727
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,791
What guys are crazy about me?

728
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,109
I don't know...

729
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,560
Patrick. He said you drive him wild.

730
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,353
Really? Patrick said that?

731
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,238
- He said, "Martine drives me wild?"
- Yes!

732
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,592
You seem surprised. There's something
attractive about you, after all.

733
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,795
Okay! You say it like...

734
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,552
Can I sleep with you tonight?

735
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,355
Please.

736
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,069
If you want to.

737
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,630
Shit!

738
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,709
Morning!

739
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,194
Thank you. I'm happy I stayed with you.

740
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,712
Yeah, but you can't stay.
I'm expecting a girl... friend.

741
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,913
It's no big deal.

742
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,554
Just tell her the truth.

743
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,432
We're old friends and we didn't fuck.

744
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,789
Yeah, sure.

745
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,834
She's your girlfriend?

746
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,436
Yeah.

747
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,999
- You have a girlfriend?
- No, not really.

748
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,996
Is she your girlfriend or not?

749
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,920
I don't have a girlfriend,
I have girlfriends.

750
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,759
Do you have a girlfriend or not?

751
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,395
I don't have one, I have lots.
Is that clear?

752
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,990
Oh! I forgot how you were.

753
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,152
Flip out on your own time!

754
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,112
I'm outta here.

755
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,552
Well, yeah.
She's on her way. It'll be a mess.

756
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,073
I have a life. Last night,
you didn't give me a chance to explain

757
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,510
that I had to juggle things
this morning.

758
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,790
Bye.

759
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,235
I'm sorry.
I was afraid you'd run into her.

760
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,828
I understand.

761
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,070
Fuck!

762
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,077
- Who is she?
- No one.

763
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,634
I'm no one?

764
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,513
I'm no one?

765
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,915
You have your life, I have mine.
No problem!

766
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,919
But you'll always be someone to me.
Always.

767
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,599
In anyone's presence.

768
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,829
- Who is she?
- No...

769
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,872
My ex, Martine.

770
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,150
Not so "ex".

771
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,551
She is my ex. It's over. Come in.

772
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,909
One in, one out...

773
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,358
That doesn't bother you at all.

774
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,995
You don't understand.

775
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,920
You just line 'em up.
You don't give a fuck.

776
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,794
Exactly.
If you don't like it, take a hike.

777
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:53,751
What?

778
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,190
Yeah! You're all fucking,
stupid bitches!

779
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,599
You got that? Now get lost!

780
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,355
Asshole.

781
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,831
Yeah, I'm an asshole!

782
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,239
You can't talk to women like that.
Asshole!

783
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,752
Who is she? I'm a what?

784
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,076
Stop! Calm down. You...

785
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,395
I what?

786
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,435
She can't talk to me like that.
You parade your sluts through here...

787
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,989
Fuck, Xavier!

788
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,033
It's not easy for a woman my age
to find a good man.

789
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,152
A good man's hard to find.

790
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,512
Yeah, I know.

791
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,149
I want you to meet him.
But no comments!

792
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,950
Chill out, ma! You're not 15.

793
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,957
I know what it's like not to find
your soul mate right away.

794
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,117
Don't worry, I've been briefed.

795
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,471
Still, we humans are a funny race.

796
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,352
Did you know that
a hippopotamus chooses one mate

797
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,676
and they stay together for life?

798
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:03,990
Did you know that?

799
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,076
No.

800
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,354
Isn't that marvelous?

801
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,430
This is it?

802
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,599
- He lives here?
- Yeah.

803
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,871
- You, too?
- For three months now.

804
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,719
Okay, I get it.

805
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,150
- You get what?
- Why he's a good man.

806
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,875
- Stop!
- I see why you're with him.

807
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,231
No comments. You promised.

808
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,078
- Are you freaking out?
- No.

809
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,596
Yes, you are.

810
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,916
You'll make me freak out for real.

811
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,078
We used to cut the world in two.

812
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,069
Capitalists, Marxists; exploiters,
exploited; the Right, the Left.

813
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,270
That worked pretty well.

814
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,672
Those oppositions don't work anymore.

815
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,956
Today, one world strips women bare,
another veils them.

816
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,636
That's the real opposition today.
In our image of women.

817
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,799
Yeah, that's true.

818
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,717
<i>So I finally finished a new draft.</i>

819
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,878
<i>But France TV</i>
<i>had a little surprise for me.</i>

820
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,673
<i>They said that</i>
<i>an Australian satellite "bouquet"...</i>

821
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,268
<i>Or was it German?</i>

822
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,758
TS6 is a silent partner of PassionTV,
through Eurosat 2000.

823
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,596
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

824
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,669
<i>It was some sort of "bouquet" buy-out</i>
<i>by God knows who.</i>

825
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,351
<i>Anyway,</i> Love Passion in Venice
<i>was now a BBC 2 co-production.</i>

826
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,278
<i>So the script had to be in English.</i>

827
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,516
Oh, really?

828
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,834
<i>Their BBC counterparts are currently</i>

829
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,557
<i>putting together a pool</i>
<i>of screenwriters. And so, that's that.</i>

830
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:58,716
Sorry. We know how much you've
invested in <i>Love Passion in Venice.</i>

831
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,159
<i>He said, "Those are</i>
<i>the vagaries of globalization. "</i>

832
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,592
You're a victim of globalization.

833
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,308
<i>That made me feel better.</i>

834
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,996
Hold on, I speak English.

835
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,555
Meaning?

836
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,674
You think you can write in English?

837
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,912
Of course. I've even written
screenplays in English.

838
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,276
Can we submit them
to our co-producers?

839
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,510
Yes.

840
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,677
Well, that's a bit complicated...

841
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,398
I wrote them when I was in Barcelona...

842
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,913
I think the publisher's production arm
may have gone bankrupt.

843
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,672
Hello, Paris!

844
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,512
I'm a Parisian!

845
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,194
Gimme some escargot and red wine!

846
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,949
Do you speak French?

847
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,599
Wanna sleep with me?

848
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,033
Hi. I was talking about the lights.

849
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,514
I have to work a little longer.
Just a bit.

850
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,390
I need...

851
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,389
the light.

852
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,637
To work. Like that.

853
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,719
Like the sun.

854
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,796
On stage.

855
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,869
Thank you very much.

856
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,550
I'll just be a little while.
My name is Natasha.

857
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,638
Thank you, William.

858
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,196
Bye.

859
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,795
<i>So, there it is.</i>

860
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,469
<i>A love story is above all a story.</i>

861
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,869
It was good?

862
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,669
Thank you.

863
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,515
You liked it?

864
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,793
In what way?

865
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,034
You liked the way I danced?

866
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,710
You liked it. Okay. Thanks.

867
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,875
Bye.

868
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,355
Natasha!

869
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,313
Do you remember me?

870
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,153
Yes, I remember.

871
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,037
A year ago, when you got on that bus,

872
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,555
you gave me this little piece of paper.

873
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,272
I decided to learn Russian

874
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,835
just so I could speak to you.

875
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,958
I've dreamed of this moment.

876
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,511
I'm staying at the Moskva Hotel.

877
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,115
This time,

878
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,994
I'll give you a little piece of paper.

879
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,035
I apologize if this is... weird.

880
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,399
Call me.

881
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,873
If you want to.

882
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,510
Okay.

883
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,590
We proposed your English screenwriter.

884
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,269
They know her well.

885
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,514
They agreed.
You can leave for London anytime.

886
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,710
All travel and expenses
will be reimbursed.

887
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,189
Great!

888
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,832
We certainly owe you that.

889
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,034
<i>Wendy was always like a sister to me,</i>

890
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,634
<i>like a mirror image.</i>

891
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,159
<i>I realized I wasn't</i>
<i>the only one who screwed up.</i>

892
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,593
<i>Wendy's great. She must've really</i>
<i>been in love to get to this state.</i>

893
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,000
<i>How'd she ever wind up</i>
<i>with a guy like that?</i>

894
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,796
<i>How can so many sincere moments,</i>
<i>one after the other,</i>

895
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,718
<i>lead to such misery?</i>

896
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,909
<i>Who'd want that?</i>

897
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,278
<i>I don't remember</i>
<i>how we finally got started.</i>

898
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,719
<i>After breakfast, we'd work for hours.</i>
