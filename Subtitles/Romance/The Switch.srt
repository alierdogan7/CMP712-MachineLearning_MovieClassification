who I'm pretty sure I'll never see again.

1147
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:46,366
- Yep.
- That's it, huh?

1148
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,938
And now I'm crazy about a woman
who paid me for my sperm.

1149
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,701

We're gonna lick this thing.

hanging over his head.

You know, he thinks that it's his kid.
He thinks that he's my best friend.

1157
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:15,797
Wants me to give him advice on how
to be a better father to my son, you know?

1158
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,728
It's just like a nightmare.
He's e-mailing me.

1159
01:07:17,866 --> 01:07:20,596
He's smiling at me all the time.
He's hitting me with the big teeth.

1160

- Wants me to go fly-fishing with him.
- Yeah, and why--?

1161

01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,709
Because I gotta exchange this frame.
Sebastian wants one from the new line.

- It's a sterling-silver 5-by-7.

is for you to take care of this thing
with Kassie.

- Turned around?

she said she thought we had energy.

1172

Ooh. That's a new twist.
Never heard that before.

1173
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:57,196
It was very weird though.

1174

Her mouth is saying
she's spending time with Roland,

1175

1176

Ah. So go with that. Go with the eyes.

1177
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:08,014
And now I think
that I have feelings for her.

1178

It's only been, uh, 13 years.

with the mother of your child.

Meanwhile, she's falling for Roland.

1183
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,264
And I know that I could save all of this
by just telling her the truth,

1184
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:28,268
