00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:21,000
~ Night Train to Lisbon (2013) ~

2
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,920
That will make you think.

3
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,530
Based on the novel
"Night Train to Lisbon"
by Pascal Mercier

4
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,800
(Bern, Switzerland)

5
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,360
Stay there!

6
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,760
Thank you.

7
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,210
May I walk with you?

8
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,000
Fine.

9
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,760
- Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir!

10
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,680
We have a visitor,
this morning.

11
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Your coat...

12
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
Have a seat there.

13
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,360
I am afraid there is a
slight mishap on the way here...

14
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,010
I think the corrections
would still be legible.

15
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,720
Max, would you...
do the honors?

16
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,840
More work require there...

17
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,920
No opportunity
to honor and respect yourself.

18
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,640
But Marcus Aurelius was worth
philosopher and an emperor.

19
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,120
There's no coincidence,
that was the way with the Romans.

20
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,440
Thought and action were all one.

21
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,240
I think we were
chapter 12, page 42.

22
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,960
Natalie,
perhaps you da... begin?

23
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,940
"How can it be that the Gods...

24
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,340
overlooked this alone,

25
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,930
that some lost men...

26
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,560
and those very good men,

27
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,570
who have had the most... "

28
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,360
"into the course with the divine."

29
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,850
Uh, just keep on going.

30
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,730
"If it is so that we live
only a small part of the life
which is within us,"

31
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,040
" what happens to the rest?"

32
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,840
Hello, Mr. Gregorius.

33
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
I am afraid your book on
Persian grammar has yet to arrive.

34
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,120
Uh no, that's not why I came...
Do you know that book?

35
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,880
Indeed,
I sold it to someone yesterday.

36
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,120
A woman?

37
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,600
Yes. She came in, asked
for the Portuguese section

38
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,080
from this book.
Sat there.

39
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Read it for an hour or so
then became rather upset.

40
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,920
Paid for the book and left...
How did you come by?

41
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,480
I found it.

42
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,490
Beautiful title.

43
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,920
"UM OURIVES DAS PALAVRAS"

44
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,284
"A Goldsmith of Words."

45
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,040
Train tickets.

46
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,600
- Where to?
- Lisbon, eventually.

47
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,240
Leaving in 15 minutes.

48
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,560
- Thank you.
- She was wearing that coat!

49
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,890
Attention please.

50
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,520
Line 10 on platform 8
is now leaving...

51
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,440
What is all this noise?

52
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,640
- Where is Mr. Gregorius?
- He left, Mr. Kagi.

53
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
He left?

54
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,120
There was a woman with him here.

55
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,760
Impossible.

56
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,360
"We live here and now."

57
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,240
"Everything before
and in other places is past."

58
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,080
"Mostly forgotten."

59
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:03,439
Hello.

60
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,010
Uh, this is Mr. Kagi.
Where are you?

61
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,400
- On a train.
- A train?

62
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,760
- Where to?
- Lisbon.

63
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Would you take care of my books?
I left them on my desk.

64
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,010
"What could,
what should be done..."

65
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,680
"with all the time
that lies ahead of us,"

66
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,840
"open and unshaped,"

67
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,400
"feather-light in its freedom..."

68
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,560
"and lead-heavy in its uncertainty?"

69
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,760
"Is it a wish?"

70
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,240
"Dream like and nostalgic,"

71
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,560
"to stand once again
at that point in life..."

72
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,960
"and be able to take a
completely different direction..."

73
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,080
"to the one which has
made us who we are?"

74
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,280
Do you have a room?

75
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,320
- Where is your luggage?
- I don't have any.

76
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,080
I will trust you
and give you a room.

77
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,520
With a view of the sea.

78
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,890
There. The sea.

79
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,080
- Anything else, sir?
- Yes

80
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,770
I wanted to find the address
of the man who wrote this.

81
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,960
Thank you.

82
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,090
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.

83
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,240
Good morning,
I am looking for Amadeu de Prado.

84
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,000
One moment.

85
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,880
I believe you are
looking for my brother?

86
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,120
- Yes. Is the doctor in?
- Are you ill?

87
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,240
No, I'm...
I am reading this book.

88
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,800
I very much like to meet him.

89
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,960
What he writes
touches me very deeply.

90
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,770
You should come inside.

91
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,840
You may sit.

92
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,130
Some tea?
Red Assam is Amadeu's preference.

93
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:53,210
Thank you.

94
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,050
Tea, Clotilde.

95
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,400
This is Amadeu's favorite room.

96
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,770
It's beautiful room.

97
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,680
He has read everyone
of those books.

98
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,000
Does he still practice
as a doctor?

99
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,560
Where did you get it?

100
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,720
I came across it in Bern,
where I live.

101
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,520
Only a hundred were ever printed.

102
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,840
I have six copies left.

103
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,240
I often wonder where
the other 94 went.

104
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,720
Bern is in Switzerland,
is it not?

105
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,050
Yes.

106
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,680
And the book has traveled?...
That is a good thing.

107
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,920
- Has he written anything else?
- Nothing that has been published.

108
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,520
He wanted to be
a writer, a philosopher...

109
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Then he decided
to become a doctor.

110
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,040
He didn't believe
people should be in pain.

111
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,960
- Is that him?
- That is our father

112
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,920
- He was a famous judge.
- So, I gather from the book.

113
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,439
He and Amadeu had a
rather complicated relationship.

114
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,920
"Consider from the standpoint of eternity
that rather loses its significance."

115
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
Yes.

116
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,010
- He often said that to Amadeu.
- Amadeu does not believe in eternity.

117
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,560
Unfortunately not.

118
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,960
I don't mean to pry, but...

119
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,720
may I ask
how your father died?

120
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,120
No. No, you may not.

121
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,080
If you want to see Amadeu...

122
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,600
you will find him
in Cemetery Prazeres.

123
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,250
"We leave something
of ourselves behind..."

124
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,320
"when we leave a place,..."

125
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,320
"we stay there,
even though we go away."

126
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,520
"And there are things in us..."

127
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,560
"that we can find again
only by going back there."

128
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,480
"We travel to our souls
when we go to a place..."

129
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,360
"that we have covered
a stretch of our life,..."

130
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,360
"no matter how brief
it may have been."

131
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,800
"But by travelling to ourselves,
we must confront our own loneliness.

132
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,640
"And isn't it so
that everything we do..."

133
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,280
"is done out of fear
of loneliness?"

134
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,200
"Isn't that why we renounce..."

135
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,800
"all the things we will regret
at the end of our life?

136
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,520
Excuse me.  I am looking for
Amadeu de Almeida Prado.

137
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,800
- Prado.
- Thank you.

138
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,860
(In Portuguese)

139
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,940
"...When dictatorship is a fact,
revolution is a duty..."

140
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,420
Merda idiota! (Portuguese)
["Fucking idiot!"]

141
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,680
"Is it ultimately a
question of self-image,"

142
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,760
"the determining idea
one has made for oneself..."

143
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,760
"of what one has to have
accomplished and experienced..."

144
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,080
"so that one can approve of
the life one has lived?"

145
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,010
"If this is the case,"

146
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,560
"the fear of death
might be described..."

147
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,040
"as the fear of not being able to
become whom one planned to be."

148
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,279
"If the certainty befalls us
that it will..."

149
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,960
"never be achieved,
this wholeness,"

150
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,600
"we suddenly don't know
how to live the time..."

151
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,960
"that can no longer be
part of the whole life."

152
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,680
Better?

153
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,080
Or worse?

154
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
Better.

155
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,080
- You feel as if you wrote the book yourself?
- I would like to then.

156
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,080
Talks about everything
that preoccupying him for years.

157
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,400
Better? Or worse?

158
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
Worse.

159
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,520
Tell me one of these
beautiful sentences you read.

160
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,850
"The real director of life
is accident --"

161
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,400
"a director full of cruelty,"

162
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,370
"compassion and bewitching charm."

163
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,820
By accident, he means fate?

164
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,440
No, I think he means chance,
randomness chance.

165
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,200
Let's take a break,
rest your eyes for a moment.

166
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,240
You are a man
who does not sleep well.

167
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,080
- You can tell?
- The eyes reveal everything.

168
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,770
Look at these eyes.

169
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Tell me what they reveal.

170
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,760
Melancholic, but hopeful.

171
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,060
Tire, but persistent.

172
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:40,160
Contradictory.

173
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,920
Why would his sister
pretend that he is still alive?

174
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,520
I have no idea.
Shall we resume?

175
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,570
So you met a woman in a red coat
who disappeared...

176
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,400
- ... and you just dropped everything?
- Then I read the book.

177
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,290
I would love to be able to do that,
just drop everything...

178
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,640
- You do that often?
- No, I never done anything like that before.

179
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
Best? Or worse?

180
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,680
Uh, better.

181
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,120
How does that feel?

182
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,120
You talk about seeing his feeling.

183
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,080
- Well, isn't it?
- I suppose it is.

184
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,210
- How clear is it? The image.
- Very clear.

185
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,040
And how about this?

186
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,160
Everything is in focus.

187
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,840
Sir, we have this
new one here...

188
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
"The decisive moment of life,"

189
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,120
"when its direction
changes forever,"

190
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,450
"are not always marked by
loud and shrill dramatics."

191
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,360
"In truth, the dramatic moments
of a life-determining experience..."

192
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,280
"are often unbelievable low-key."

193
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,460
"When it unfolds
its revolutionary effect..."

194
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,920
"and make sure that life that it revealed
in a brand-new light."

195
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,280
"It does that silently."

196
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,320
"And in this wonderful silence
resides its special nobility."

197
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,880
Now you wonder if
the old pair were better.

198
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,760
- Yes.
- But they are not, are they?

199
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,560
No, they feel very light.

200
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,920
Getting used to them
will take some time.

201
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,600
- You take credit cards?
- You can sort all that out with my receptionist.

202
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,450
Before you go...
I have an uncle.

203
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,730
He lives in a nursing home
across the Tejo (river Tagus).

204
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,720
I called him last night
and told him about you and the book.

205
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,160
He knew Amadeu de Prado well.

206
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,120
I told him you want to know about Amadeu
and he said he'll talk to you.

207
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,600
He was in the resistance.

208
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,040
I must warn you,
my uncle can be difficult.

209
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,810
In what way?

210
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,880
The generation that
lived under the dictator Salazar

211
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,240
is still battling to come to terms
with what happened.

212
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,320
When the resistance began,
the Secret Police were extremely brutal.

213
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,480
To this day,
people don't like talking about it,

214
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,650
The block of jail
as well as their victims.

215
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,050
Uncle João, how are you?

216
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,090
What you doing here?

217
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,440
This is the man I was telling you about,
Raimund Gregorius.

218
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,720
- I brought him.
- I said I talk to him, not you.

219
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,080
- But...
- You can wait in reception.

220
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,081
We go to the lounge.

221
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,400
So, you are interested
in Amadeu de Prado?

222
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:52,901
Yes.

223
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,440
Mariana tells me
you have a book of him?

224
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,680
Would you like to see it?

225
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,280
I can imagine what it is like.
A godless priest.

226
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,400
That's a good description.

227
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,410
He was the only visitor there
allowed in prison.

228
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,560
Every week he visits,

229
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,080
with books and medicines,
and cigarettes...

230
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,560
which of course, they take away
the moment he leaves.

231
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,410
Yeah, he had privileges.

232
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,240
- What sort of privileges?
- The kind you don't want in life.

233
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,520
- Do you have cigarette?
- No, sorry, I don't smoke.

234
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,640
Pity.

235
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,360
Mariana tells me that
you and Amadeu were in the resistance.

236
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,840
- And Jorge, his best friend.
- Oh yes, he wrote a lot about Jorge.

237
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,200
Oh, they were joined
at the heart and the soul.

238
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
For a time...

239
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,680
But Amadeu, he was too soft
for the resistance.

240
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,800
He only joined
because he feel quilt.

241
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,560
Mariana tells me
you are from Switzerland?

242
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,080
Yes, Bern.

243
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,800
There was never a revolution
in Switzerland, was there?

244
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,440
No.  Somehow they always
managed to avoid such things.

245
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,770
They wouldn't know what it's like
to live without trusting.

246
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,640
No one to trust,
no friends, no family.

247
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,890
I met his sister, Adriana.

248
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,120
She...
She acts as if he is still alive.

249
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,920
And she wears black
as is in mourning.

250
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,090
Looking at only fill
my cup halfway?

251
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,640
No one has ever done that
for me before.

252
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,842
Yeah, it burns.

253
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,720
A gift from PIDE, the Portuguese Secret Police.
[Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado]

254
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,660
Rui Luís Mendes was his name.
["Butcher of Lisbon"]

255
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,080
1973,

256
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,640
in the spring time...

257
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,640
I'm home.

258
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,240
Who are you?

259
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,360
Where's my wife?

260
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,490
She kindly
took your children for a walk.

261
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,600
This woman that knows all the names.
Where do I find her?

262
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,850
I do not know...

263
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,800
I do not know
what you are talking about.

264
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,770
Your wife tells me
you are an excellent pianist...

265
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,640
Will you play for me?
And my friend?

266
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,560
Please.

267
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,970
Can I see you hands?
Please.

268
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,640
- What should I play?
- Play as your favorite.

269
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,240
They say she has
a photographic memory.

270
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,050
Is that true?

271
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,040
I ask you once more,
where is she?

272
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,600
What made it
all that more terrible

273
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,160
was that someone said yeah

274
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,840
Amadeu, he saved Mendes' life.

275
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,840
Dinnertime. They-- they serve us
early here, like in prison.

276
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,840
Not for the inmates, you understand,
but for the staff.

277
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,400
I'm glad he finally been
able to tell someone about it.

278
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,800
I just wish it had been me.

279
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,410
It is ofter easier
to speak with strangers.

280
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,840
With my family it's a bit different.

281
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,880
Pain is something we pretend
happens to other people.

282
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,000
When Uncle João disappeared,

283
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,560
our parent told us
he had gone to Brazil to work.

284
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,360
Then after the Revolution,
when he was released,

285
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,840
they told us he had an accident
with his hands.

286
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,090
- He is very fond of you.
- He is?

287
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,840
He said you are the only one
from the family who ever visited.

288
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,570
He is always so grumpy,
I don't blame the others.

289
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,210
- What else did he say?
- He said he wish you are married.

290
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,810
I hate him!

291
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,880
Then when you visited,
there'll be children.

292
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,850
He actually said that?
And he is fond of me?

293
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,560
Do you have children?

294
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,930
No.
I have my students...

295
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,840
but the faces change every year,
so I try not to too fond of them.

296
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I think now
you are staying another day?

297
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,570
Yes, I might have to.

298
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,210
Beautiful glasses.

299
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,610
Father Bartolomeu?

300
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:11,900
Yes.

301
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,520
João Eça tells me that you
buried Amadeu de Prado.

302
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,540
I would prefer to be
remembered in this manner:

303
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,400
who taught Amadeu,

304
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,720
not the one who buried him.

305
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,520
Amadeu was 12 years old
when he first came to the school.

306
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,530
He came with no bag, no books...

307
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,840
and read them all, you think.

308
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,080
Everything was in his head.

309
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,480
What does he say about the school,
in his book?

310
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,840
"For 1922 days,..."

311
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,640
"I attended the 'Liceu (school)'
where my Father sent me,..."

312
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,360
"the strictest school
in the whole country."

313
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,180
"By the third day I realized
I had to count the days,..."

314
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,360
"so as not to be crushed by it."

315
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,840
He hated it that much?

316
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,320
Were Jorge and Amadeu
in the same class?

317
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,370
Uh, no. Not at first.

318
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,800
Amadeu skipped 2 grades.

319
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,920
He was that bright, you see.

320
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,800
And for 2 years,
they were in the same class.

321
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,830
Or I should say,

322
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,160
they were in a class of their own.

323
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,280
Amadeu, the aristocrat,

324
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,760
and Jorge, the working class boy.

325
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,360
They had a very noted curiosity
in those two.

326
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,690
They would lie to their mothers

327
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,040
that they were going to spend
the night at the friend's house.

328
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
Instead, they came here.

329
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,170
How did you find them, Jorge?

330
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,210
I was sleeping here
and I found the floor was loosen.

331
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,980
- Jean-Paul Sartre (French philosopher)...
- Karl Marx (German philosopher)...

332
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,590
Henry Miller (American writer)...

333
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,920
My God, if we found these books...

334
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,639
We would end up in Tarrafal ("Camp of the Slow Death")
along with all the other political prisoners.

335
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,160
But your father would never
allow that, would he? Amadeu.

336
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,720
He would get Grand Minister Salazar
personally intervene

337
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,560
and have the case thrown out of court.

338
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
You think it is a joke
my father is a judge.

339
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,230
I think it is a joke that
the son of a green grocer

340
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,440
has friended with
the son of a judge.

341
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,330
That is funny.

342
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,680
You have to admit.

343
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,680
Amadeu would have been
unhappy wherever he was.

344
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,640
He never played games with the other boys.

345
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,920
He never let himself go...

346
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
except one time.

347
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,170
No body forgot that time.

348
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,090
Make room there boys.
Make room.

349
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,490
- My father is here.
- Of course he is. What do you expect?

350
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,330
You should read this, Jorge.

351
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,450
You wrote most of them anyway.

352
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,120
They are your words.
I only helped to choose them.

353
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,840
- Amadeu, which is our religion?
- Loyalty.

354
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,400
What are our values?

355
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,040
Truth, above all else.

356
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,720
Exactly. Just keep your eyes on me
and you'll be fine.

357
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,130
As is traditional,

358
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,130
we end our ceremony with
a grade 12 graduation speech.

359
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,010
In this year,
that honor will be bestow

360
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,640
to Amadeu de Almeida Prado.

361
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,560
I would not like to live
in a world without cathedrals.

362
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,160
I need their beauty
and grandeur

363
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,600
against the dirty colors
of military uniforms.

364
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,720
I love the powerful words
of the Bible.

365
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
I need the force
of its poetry.

366
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,550
I need it against
the decay of language

367
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,120
and the dictatorship
of worthless slogans.

368
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,600
But there is another world
I do not wish to live in.

369
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,360
A world in which
independent thinking is disparaged,

370
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,000
and the finest things we can
experience denounced as sin.

371
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
A world in which our love

372
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,600
is demanded by tyrants,
oppressors and assassin.

373
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,920
And most absurdly,
people are exhorted from the pulpit

374
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,000
to forgive these creatures
and even to love them.

375
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,760
It is for this reason
we cannot just put the Bible aside.

376
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,280
We have to throw it away
completely.

377
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,890
for it speaks only of
vain holier-than-thou.

378
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,840
In his omnipresent,
the Lord observes us day and night.

379
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,800
He takes note of our acts and thoughts.

380
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,760
But what is a man without secrets?

381
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,440
Without thoughts and wishes
that he, and he alone, knows?

382
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,680
Does the Lord our God
not consider

383
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,320
He's stealing our soul
with his unbridled curiosity,

384
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,920
a soul that should be immortal?

385
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,200
But who would in all seriousness
want to be immortal?

386
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,000
How boring to know that
what happens today,

387
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,480
this month, this year,
does not matter?

388
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,720
Nothing would count.

389
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,880
No one here knows what
it would be like to live eternally.

390
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
And it's a blessing we never will.

391
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,400
One thing I can assure you,

392
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,890
it would be hell,
this endless paradise of immortality.

393
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,680
It is death and only death,

394
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,280
that gives each moment
beauty and horror.

395
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,290
Only through death is time living thing.

396
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,810
Why does the Lord not noticed?

397
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,680
Why does He threaten us
with a... endlessness

398
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,280
that can only be
unbearably desolate?

399
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,080
I would not want to live
in a world without cathedrals.

400
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,530
I need the luster
of their windows,

401
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,200
their cool stillness,
their imperious silence.

402
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,450
I need the holiness of words,
the grandeur of great poetry.

403
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,370
But just as much
I need the freedom

404
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,720
to rebel against everything
that is cruel in this world.

405
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,682
For the one is nothing
without the other.

406
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,160
And no one
may force me to choose.

407
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,920
What do you think?

408
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,360
I though you would
deliver a speech in Latin.

409
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,640
But then, only a very few,
would understood it.

410
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,560
Are you friends with that boy?

411
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,360
We are the best of friends.

412
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,920
All of those faces, and more,

413
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
came to his funeral.

414
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,760
He died on the day of the Revolution.

415
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,960
Oh so, they all brought red carnations.

416
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,800
I dared not speak any words about God

417
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,210
after what Amadeu called
"His empty promises."

418
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,880
But I did allow myself...

419
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,080
one religious word.

420
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,640
Amen.

421
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,560
I was very proud of him.

422
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,240
And why did you
never tell him, papa?

423
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,960
To this day, I never found out
what secret bound those two together,

424
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,170
and what that to do with
Amadeu.

425
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,760
- My brother is not here.
- I know.

426
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,320
Go away.

427
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,230
I know what happened.

428
00:40:21,231 --> 00:40:24,460
He had an aneurysm.
[abnormal widening of an artery]
[leading to thin vessel wall]

429
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,010
It's in the book.

430
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,190
How do you live with that?

431
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:33,321
No one had ever telling him
blood vessel could burst,

432
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,280
flooding your brain
with blood?

433
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,560
I only found out after
when I discovered his writings.

434
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,490
He never told anyone.

435
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,210
Not even me.

436
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,680
I am sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

437
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,120
No, wait.

438
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,440
Let me show you
where he worked.

439
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,080
People came day and night,

440
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,720
to see him,

441
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,290
to be healed.

442
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,120
No one should be in pain,
he always used to say.

443
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,280
The door was always opened.

444
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,480
I met João Eça.

445
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:32,560
He mentioned that
Amadeu was in the resistance...

446
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,560
Huh.
the resistance...

447
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,160
... and that he saved
Mendes' life.

448
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,560
It was late in the evening.

449
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,960
There were terrible shouts

450
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,000
across the square.

451
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,640
Murderer!

452
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,120
The Police!

453
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,450
We need help!

454
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,890
Get the doctor.

455
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,400
In there!

456
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,520
Amadeu,
you need to come, now.

457
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,320
Is this...?

458
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,680
Out. Out!

459
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,000
Adriana.

460
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,240
A traitor.
Traitor!

461
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:22,810
Traitor.

462
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,400
- You are a traitor!
- I'm a doctor.

463
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,240
You hear me?
A doctor!

464
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,920
You are a traitor!

465
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,040
He sat him down in this very chair
and washed his face.

466
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,800
His beautiful face.

467
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,080
After that, people stopped coming.
Even Jorge.

468
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,960
That pretty hurt him.

469
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,480
You know of Jorge?

470
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:20,490
I know they were great friends.

471
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,720
- Why is the world so cruel?
- I ask myself that...

472
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,240
- It is if it doesn't care.
- God doesn't care.

473
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,920
Amadeu was right about that.

474
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,440
I would like to be alone now.

475
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,410
- May I call on you again?
- Why?

476
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,530
His life, his world, was...

477
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,680
... extraordinary. Makes my
seem so insignificant.

478
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,600
- You have cigarettes?
- Which brand?

479
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:03,101
Um...

480
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,280
You brought them?

481
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,110
No, wait, wait.

482
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,080
Everyone here is a spy.
Worse than the damn fascists.

483
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,730
We go outside.

484
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,760
You didn't telephone me
just to get cigarettes.

485
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,030
I called because...

486
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,850
talking to me let me sleep better,
last night.

487
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,380
Amadeu, he never smoked.
He's the only one who didn't.

488
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,000
Jorge, he smoked like a chimney.

489
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,800
- Jorge, uh-- is he still alive?
- I don't know.

490
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,400
I never talk to him after
what happened with Estefânia.

491
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,630
No one knew how to.

492
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,600
It was too personal.

493
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,770
Who is Estefânia?

494
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,240
The woman who remember everything.

495
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,200
That's why they picked me up
to get to her.

496
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,160
Lieutenant Nicholas Ribeiro.

497
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,720
Benfica. 28 December.

498
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,080
Telephone, 857-2463.

499
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,680
7th Article.

500
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,600
Captain Carlos Peixe.

501
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,320
Sintra, 47 Rua (street)...

502
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:00,321
Sh-e-e.

503
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:16,557
Is that Amadeu de Prado?

504
00:48:16,558 --> 00:48:17,858
Jorge...

505
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,850
- Are you in there?
- Let him in.

506
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,200
Why have you been avoiding me?

507
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,800
Everyone else I can understand.
But you?

508
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,400
I am not avoiding you.

509
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,850
You are lying, Jorge.
We do not lie to each other!

510
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,680
I want to join the resistance.

511
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,200
Because of guilt?

512
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,040
As a doctor,
I had no choice.

513
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,400
As a doctor, you should have
injected poison into his heart.

514
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,990
Not adrenaline [medical stimulant].

515
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,560
Sit, Amadeu.

516
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,720
Are you going to
introduce me to your friends?

517
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,760
This is João

518
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,720
And this, is Estefânia.

519
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,170
I was going to
introduce you sooner but...

520
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,720
the resistance keeps us busy.

521
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,370
Is she beautiful?

522
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,880
What if you first assignment
was to kill your father?

523
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,520
- Why?
- Because he is a judge.

524
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,280
Part of the fascist regime.

525
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,250
Don't be upset, Amadeu.
I was just testing you.

526
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,880
You knew it, straight away.
E-- even Jorge would see it.

527
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,970
Estefânia, she was
completely drawn to him.

528
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,720
And the names and addresses?

529
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,800
Members of the armed forces
sympathetic to our cause.

530
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,480
She had them
stock piled in her head

531
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,880
more than 200 names,

532
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,480
waiting for the day we call them,
rise up against the fascists.

533
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,880
- May I have my key please?
- Of course sir.

534
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,010
Is Miss. de Prado at home?

535
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,640
She asked for you to wait,
if you come.

536
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,640
Why you bring back the past?

537
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,960
I want to know how it
felt to be Amadeu.

538
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,880
Did you know him?

539
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,440
Amadeu, you must eat.

540
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,520
You need to be strong
for your final exams.

541
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,400
Stand up.

542
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,400
Sit down.

543
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,920
Mom come help me.

544
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,280
I have to do this
otherwise you will die.

545
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,440
Take your hands away.

546
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,000
Adriana, trust me.

547
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,120
Clotilde, call an ambulance!

548
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,400
The ambulance
and the doctor came

549
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,920
and Adiana was rushed
to hospital.

550
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,840
You can leave us now,
Clotilde.

551
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,120
The doctor said
I did the right thing.

552
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,250
Why did you say nothing?

553
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,040
Why do you judge me so?

554
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,880
The intervention
is called tracheotomy.

555
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,290
If I hadn't done it,
you would have carried her out in a coffin.

556
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,120
I too shall have
a cup of tea with you.

557
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,810
So now, you know.

558
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,480
From then on
I was indebted to him.

559
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,080
Just as Rui Mendes
was indebted to him.

560
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,960
The police knew very well the...

561
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,070
clinic was been used
as a cover for the resistance.

562
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,160
They never
came and searched.

563
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,100
People would drop off
envelopes of money, and...

564
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,600
names, addresses, maps.

565
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,400
And then she would come.

566
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,570
Next.

567
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,930
Why have you not call me?
I left messages.

568
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,520
I have something for João.

569
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,680
I have to talk to you.
I cannot go on with Jorge.

570
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,120
Leave us.

571
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,930
Adriana, leave us.

572
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,720
Then one night,
it-- it all ended.

573
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,880
How?

574
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,720
Something had happened...

575
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,090
I do not know what, except that
was the last time I ever saw her.

576
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,930
- There are patients waiting for you.
- Send them away.

577
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,730
We do not send patients away?!

578
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,492
Do it now.

579
00:56:13,493 --> 00:56:15,690
If someone comes to the door.
Do not answer it.

580
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,280
Switch off the lights.
We are not here.

581
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,360
João Eça is at the door.

582
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,320
I'll be back.

583
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:11,950
Amadeu!

584
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,800
Come. Come in.

585
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,360
Where is she?

586
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,520
Estefânia?

587
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,080
I don't know.
She went one way, I went another.

588
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,880
Jorge came to me;
the problem is Estefânia.

589
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,570
What do you mean?

590
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,410
He wants...
he wants to eliminate her.

591
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,080
What?

592
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,840
He said if they get to her,
they'll get the names.

593
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,680
It will be the end of it.

594
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,320
Jorge wants to kill Estefânia?

595
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,240
If she or Jorge come here,
call me.

596
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,460
- You understand?
- I understand.

597
00:57:58,622 --> 00:57:59,122
Okay.

598
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,680
What a mess.

599
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,280
What are you going to do?

600
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,880
Pack a bag and some food;
I am taking the car.

601
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,480
- To where?
- Away from here.

602
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,730
- With her?
- Of course with her.

603
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,160
No, please no,
Amadeu!

604
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,720
I beg you,
don't do this thing!

605
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,090
Tell them she's here.

606
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,480
Don't go away with her.
I beg you!

607
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Please, don't go!

608
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,600
Do as I say.

609
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,360
Don't do this thing,
it's wrong!

610
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,680
Something terrible will happen,
I know it will!

611
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,560
He stepped over me.
I'll never forget that.

612
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,680
He stepped over me...

613
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,810
like I was... nothing.

614
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,920
Could I have a coffee, please?

615
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,560
Mr. Kagi, its me.

616
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,640
I am sorry
I missed your call yesterday.

617
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,680
Don't tell me
you are still in Lisbon?

618
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,400
- Yes, I am.
- Where are you staying?

619
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,250
Hotel Silva.
You wouldn't have heard...

620
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,890
Is it raining in Bern?

621
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,200
I can't keep teaching your class,
you have to come back.

622
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,720
You don't come back, I am going
to have to get replacement for you.

623
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,160
You want me to do this?

624
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,720
- Perhaps...
- I need a "yes" or "no", Raimund.

625
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,160
Mr. Kagi, I have to go.
I'm sorry.

626
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,880
Why are you following me?

627
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,570
Where does this come from?

628
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,330
His sister, Adriana,
came across his notes.

629
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,320
She put them together in a book.
I came across that in Bern, Switzerland.

630
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,000
I want to know what
happened to Estefânia.

631
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,160
- Why?
- Amadeu is dead...

632
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,520
Adriana does not know.
You are the only one who does.

633
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,840
Get the hell out of here!

634
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,560
Get out!

635
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,360
Why has my uncle
started smoking again?

636
01:02:35,654 --> 01:02:36,154
What?

637
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,080
The doctor from
the nursing home called me

638
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,400
and told me a stranger visited him
and brought him some cigarettes.

639
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,120
- But he asked me to bring him...
- Are you trying to kill him?

640
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,490
He already has emphysema!
[a chronic lung disease]

641
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,880
Yeah, but he enjoys smoking.
Why deny him that pleasure?

642
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,450
Because it's bad for him.

643
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,320
So is in that nursing home.
Reminds him of being in prison.

644
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,370
- How are your new glasses?
- I'm getting used to them.

645
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,680
Would you have dinner with me?

646
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,730
I thought you never ask.

647
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,160
If-- if-- if Jesus had been
put to death with a guillotine

648
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,000
we all be praying before a big shiny blade.

649
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,290
Or-- or if He've been electrocuted
we will be genuflecting in front of a chair.

650
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,560
But can you really do that?

651
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,690
Nobody dislike to be another person
without being the other person.

652
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,480
You can "imagine" what it's like
to be that other person.

653
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,640
"Imagination is our last sanctuary."
That's one of his lines.

654
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,520
There he also said,
"Intimacy is our last sanctuary."

655
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,520
You remember the lines verbatim.

656
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,280
Uh that's figure they--
they mean something to me.

657
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,770
Poor Estefânia, she--
she remembered everything,

658
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,080
even trivial things --
numbers, names,

659
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,440
phone numbers, addresses...

660
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,120
To have a memory like that
must drive me mad.

661
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,730
Sorry, I am going on.

662
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,280
I haven't talked
as much as this for years.

663
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,160
No, no.
I'm fascinated...

664
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,280
May I ask you
how long you have been on you own?

665
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,850
Five and a half years.

666
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,600
But before that,
you spoke to you wife?

667
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,130
Yes...

668
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,250
but it...

669
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,440
usually landed me in trouble.

670
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,000
What kind of trouble?

671
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,680
Well, we threw a party to our colleagues...

672
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,840
well... our friends.

673
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,190
And she found this quote from
Pessoa [Fernando Pessoa, a Portuguese poet]:

674
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:46,400
"Fields are greener in their description
than their actual greenness."

675
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,640
And somebody said,
"Ow that's a beautiful sentence."

676
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:52,440
I said, "Yes, but, only a very few
people would ever understand it."

677
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:59,140
And there was-- terrible silence,
and then she said, my wife...

678
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:04,000
She said, "And I suppose you
are one of the chosen few?"

679
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,200
So, that was the end of that party.

680
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,490
But you were right.

681
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,040
Yes, but-- it-- was arrogance of me.
Stupid marriage.

682
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,610
And is that why she left you,
because of your arrogance?

683
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,080
No. I think she left me because
she found me...

684
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,760
boring.

685
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,000
We are still in touch.
She called the other day,

686
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,720
she wanted me to move
my books out of the garage,

687
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,480
because her new boyfriend
wanted somewhere to park his car.

688
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,360
Don't know why I am
telling you all of these.

689
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,380
- Would you like to dance?
- No, I can't. I can't dance.

690
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,040
You see?

691
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,640
Boring.

692
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,560
Thank you.

693
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,290
I enjoyed that.

694
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,680
Raimund, you are not boring.

695
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,680
My uncle would like
to see you again.

696
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,240
Would you
take him some cigarettes?

697
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,640
- Jorge is still alive.
- You went see him?

698
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,880
Still running the same pharmacy.

699
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,360
Smoking cigarette
while he serves his customers.

700
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,720
- You brought some?
- Yes I did.

701
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,650
Estefânia was in the house
when I was there?

702
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,920
She found them together
in his study.

703
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,600
No wonder he lied to me...

704
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:16,180
because you know, he never lied.
He could not tolerate dishonesty.

705
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,720
What had happened
earlier that night?

706
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,960
Jorge's place become too small,

707
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:26,960
and so we hired a room in an
old warehouse for our meetings.

708
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:33,080
We pretended it was a literacy class.
Estefânia's idea.

709
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,370
We were so naive...

710
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,840
Nuno,
Beleza the railways.

711
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,520
The numbers you will call are:

712
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:45,640
Lisbon, 642-3518,

713
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,600
contact name, Leonardo;

714
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:53,360
Port, 235-5900,
contact name, Julius.

715
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,800
The signal to take over will
come from Radio Renaissance now.

716
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,960
It will be the song
that was banned. The song by...

717
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,720
- Excuse me. Are you lost?
- Is this the literacy class?

718
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,040
Yes, we were just finishing.
Please take a seat.

719
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:26,200
Most letters have more than
one pronunciation except
the letter "X",

720
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,570
and we'll explain that
in more detail next week.

721
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,520
Thank you all.

722
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,480
What is a professor
of music doing here?

723
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,960
I met someone who cannot read

724
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,260
I wanted to see for myself
what kind of course it was,

725
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,280
before recommending it.

726
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,280
What is this person's name?

727
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,280
Um-- ur--
Caspian.

728
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,440
How original...

729
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,600
Seat down, all of you!
Nobody leaves this room!

730
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,720
Out. Out!

731
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,240
Give me your gun.

732
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,160
What for?

733
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,920
We have to do
what is right for the resistance.

734
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,960
- What happened to the others?
- Estefânia and Amadeu they got away. But...

735
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,880
they gonna find her
and then she will talk.

736
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,920
The others they don't know much.
But Estefânia, she knows everything.

737
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,880
What are you talking about?

738
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,920
You want to kill Estefânia?

739
01:10:20,921 --> 01:10:23,139
No.
No, no.

740
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,560
I don't want to,
but I have to.

741
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,600
One life for many lifes.
Give it to me.

742
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,760
João, give it to me.

743
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,200
I never find out
what really happened.

744
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,200
Did he tell you?

745
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,160
No. When I asked him,
he tell me to-- get lost.

746
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:51,130
I need to know, I can't tell you
how many time I wish

747
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,760
I never have given him
that gun.

748
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:01,440
Three days later,
Rui Mendes he picked me up.

749
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,680
He broke my hands
and my spirit,

750
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,040
but I never give him
one single name.

751
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,920
You-- you-- you tell that to Jorge.
He knows me.

752
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,360
"Youth, we live
as if we were immortal."

753
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,890
"Knowledge of mortality
dances around us..."

754
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,600
"like a brittle paper ribbon
that barely touches our skin."

755
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,280
"When in life does that change?"

756
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,840
"When does the ribbon tighten..."

757
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,280
"until finally it strangles us?"

758
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,840
Mr. Kagi?

759
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,120
Have you made a decision yet?

760
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,200
No.

761
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,000
A woman came asking for you.
She said she met you on a bridge, or something.

762
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,680
A Portuguese woman?

763
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,160
I told him where you were
but she left.

764
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,160
If you decide not to come back,
I need your keys.

765
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,280
- Would you post them to me?
- No, this woman...

766
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,570
Did-- did she leave her name?

767
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,080
No.

768
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,210
Goodbye, Mr. Kagi.

769
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,520
João Eça want to know
what happened to Estefânia.

770
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,560
He says you owe him.

771
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,080
I owe no one anything.

772
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,640
You know
what they did to his hands?

773
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,320
Those hands that used to play Mozart?
He didn't give them one name.

774
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,240
If he had,
you wouldn't be standing here.

775
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,600
You think you can
blackmail me with guilt?

776
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,120
You don't know
who you are dealing with!

777
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,960
Could I haven't killed her?
That is the question!

778
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,760
Don't you know we don't talk about--
about the resistance here?

779
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,240
We bury our history
and move on!

780
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,160
You want a drink?

781
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,650
You are sitting
where Amadeu used to sit,

782
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,610
until this thing
with Mendes happened, then we...

783
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,280
We have the list of
reasons for loyalty:

784
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,120
guilt towards others,

785
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,400
shared suffering,
common struggle, common strength,

786
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,600
weakness,
need for closeness,

787
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,730
common hatred,
shared humor, and so on.

788
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,250
- What about love?
- He didn't believe in it.

789
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,800
Avoided the word
as too sentimental.

790
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,500
There are only 3 things
that are important to him:

791
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,930
desire,
pleasure and security.

792
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,000
Desire...
she is Jewish.

793
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,680
I don't trust people
who don't drink.

794
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,440
Have a cigarette.

795
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,280
You are okay?

796
01:15:14,896 --> 01:15:15,396
Yeah.

797
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,400
- João still loves to smoke?
- He would.

798
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,200
The night after we graduated
from Coimbra University,

799
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,360
me as a pharmacist,
Amadeu was a doctor.

800
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,560
- What?
- Come, I have something to show you.

801
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,000
What do you think?

802
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,720
So? It's a--
it's a pharmacy.

803
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,040
Yes... It's yours.

804
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,080
Come in.

805
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,360
I need a pharmacist I can trust
if I am going to be writing up prescriptions.

806
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,880
Here.

807
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,440
I could not believe
what he given me.

808
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,640
After that I never thought
we could lose our friendship.

809
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,400
I never thought it possible.

810
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,370
One not much to look as,
I know I'm an ugly bastard.

811
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,040
So, when she came along...

812
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,040
God, she was beautiful

813
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,090
I thought some of her
would somehow rub off on me.

814
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,320
At least that is
what I think I thought.

815
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,520
And this is Estefânia.

816
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,440
Was going to introduce you,
but...

817
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,760
The resistance keeps us busy.

818
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,800
Isn't she beautiful?

819
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,440
It was the way she took my hand
and removed it from her neck.

820
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,160
Her eyes penetrating him...

821
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,440
We'll think about it, Amadeu,
and get back to you.

822
01:17:46,741 --> 01:17:47,341
Alright?

823
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,640
Perhaps we can
use your clinic as a drop.

824
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,840
Why did you take my hand
off your neck?

825
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,570
Did I?

826
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,800
Have you ever been in love?

827
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,800
So that not even food matters.
Not even words.

828
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,800
- I am not sure.
- You would be sure. Your would know.

829
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,450
You always know.

830
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,480
- You thinking of him.
- What?

831
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,640
You wished I was Amadeu.

832
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,160
Does he mention me
in the book?

833
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,680
A lot.

834
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,000
And I am surprise
she published it. Adriana hated me.

835
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:09,800
Wanted him for herself,
even not even want to share him
with her father.

836
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,000
You know what happened to him?

837
01:19:12,001 --> 01:19:13,001
No.

838
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,210
A few months before the revolution,

839
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,120
he went to Amadeu who endorsed for
stronger pain killer for his back.

840
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,090
Adriana came every week
to the pharmacy for the pills.

841
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,760
But he never took them;
he hoarded them.

842
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,440
A week after Amadeu died,
he swallowed over one hundred.

843
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,120
The newspapers said he died there
after a long illness...

844
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,640
Catholics don't appreciate suicide.

845
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,240
Everyone out!

846
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,200
Estefânia, come with me.

847
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,960
If I had the gun then
I might have shot her.

848
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,370
And when you got the gun?

849
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,200
I went strict
to Amadeu's clinic.

850
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,960
I knew
they would be there.

851
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,280
- Where are they?
- They've gone.

852
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,080
- Don't lie to me...
- They've gone, Jorge.

853
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,850
Give me the gun.

854
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,240
Estefânia, is she--
is she still alive?

855
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,040
I bumped into her
two years ago.

856
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,160
She was here
attending some seminar, or...

857
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,520
I asked her
how she was.

858
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,200
She told me
she was teaching history.

859
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,880
Where?

860
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:31,000
At the University of Salamanca, Spain.

861
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,960
And, your pharmacy...

862
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,240
Why do you
leave the lights on at night?

863
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,320
To remind me of Amadeu.

864
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,600
Mr. da Silva,
can I have my bill please?

865
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,360
- Are you going back to Switzerland, sir?
- Yes, via Spain.

866
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,530
They say weather right now
in Switzerland is terrible

867
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,520
rain, snowing, wind...

868
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,520
I have to go.
Could I have my bill please?

869
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,200
Excuse me.

870
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,320
Hello!

871
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,240
I want to thank you
for what happened on the bridge.

872
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,280
- I've been reading your book.
- I don't want it.

873
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,160
I just want to thank you
for what you did.

874
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,080
I got your coat.

875
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,970
You left it behind.

876
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,080
Tell me your name.

877
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,560
Catarina Mendes.

878
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,000
Yes...

879
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,050
that Mendes.

880
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,600
I am the granddaughter
of the "Butcher of Lisbon".

881
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,680
I didn't know who we was
until I read the book.

882
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,240
You can't blame yourself for
what you grandfather did...

883
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,600
You don't understand.

884
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,360
I loved him.

885
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,040
I cried at his funeral...

886
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,160
And I did not understand
why so many other people
were not crying.

887
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,850
Anyway...

888
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:34,490
it will take some time,
but I learned to live with this.

889
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:49,120
This would be the same road
they took.

890
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:52,920
But at night,
and in great danger.

891
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,130
And in love.

892
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,240
I was moved to see
my uncle cry like that.

893
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:06,080
I don't know what pleases him more.
The news that Estefânia is still alive,

894
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,520
or, got the cigarettes we gave him.

895
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,450
So, you are returning to your school
and continue teaching?

896
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,080
If they'll have me.

897
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,840
I am sure I'll come back and visit.

898
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,250
Are you sure she'll be in?

899
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,450
She said she'll be here...
Are you coming?

900
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,650
I'll wait in the car.

901
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,760
Go Raimund.
I'll be fine here. Take your time.

902
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,040
Welcome Raimund.

903
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,290
- I'm Estefânia.
- Thank you so much for meeting me.

904
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,600
You have the book?

905
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,040
I do.

906
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:28,320
He only looks
just as I remember him.

907
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,770
So long ago and
still so here...

908
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,400
- Would you like some tea?
- Thank you!

909
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,850
What about your friend?

910
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,570
Only she is, um,
she is happy in the car.

911
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:46,760
I joined the resistant
after my father was arrested in
1971, for sabotage.

912
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,450
They sent him to Tarrafal.
You have heard of it?

913
01:28:52,451 --> 01:28:53,150
Yes.

914
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,480
It was also known as
the "Campo da Morte Lenta",
"The Camp of the Slow Death".

915
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,320
It took them two years
to kill him.

916
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,560
And that is how I met Jorge.

917
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:14,600
I need someone strong.
Someone to protect me.

918
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,160
I thought that was love.

919
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,730
But then I met Amadeu...

920
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,960
A new light fell on
everything.

921
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,760
My whole life.

922
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,760
I could not sleep
any more.

923
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:47,040
I went to the clinic
as often as I could...

924
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,640
despite Adriana's look.

925
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
He wanted to take me in his arm
but he kept rejecting me.

926
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:01,290
"Jorge", he would say, "What about Jorge?"
I began to hate Jorge.

927
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,240
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- No. Please.

928
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,240
Jealousy is a terrible emotion.

929
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:48,900
I could tell from his shoulders
he had seen us.

930
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:52,490
Awful... awful.

931
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,760
But in a way I was
relieved it was done.

932
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,080
Are you sure
your friend is alright?

933
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,400
Oh yes.
She is fine in the car.

934
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,640
We drove through the night.

935
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,960
Amadeu kept questioning me.

936
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,280
Was he searching for me
or for life?

937
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,800
He wanted to know
everything my whole life, like,

938
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,000
memories,

939
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:26,560
thoughts, fantasies, dreams...
It was relentless.

940
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,600
It was almost a relief when
5 km from the border

941
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,040
he stopped
and hid me in the trunk.

942
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,080
Passport.

943
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:11,480
- Why are you traveling to Spain?
- I am going to visit relatives.

944
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,850
Get out of the car,
please.

945
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,080
Keys.

946
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:50,520
Do you know
Major Rui Luís Mendes of PIDE?

947
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,440
What about him?

948
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,490
I want you to call him.
I have his home number.

949
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,560
I want you to tell him
your are treating me like a criminal.

950
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,530
He wants to talk to you.

951
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,000
This is Dr. Amadeu de Prado.

952
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,640
You are asking too much of me.

953
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,640
You took my life away from me.
I want it back now.

954
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,480
Give the phone back
to my man.

955
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,330
Ironic that I should
ultimately be saved...

956
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,330
by the Butcher of Lisbon.

957
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,760
That night...

958
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,850
we drove to Finisterra
and slept in the car.

959
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,970
Don't go away.

960
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,840
We'll take a ship
to the Amazon

961
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,800
to a new world
only you and I existed.

962
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,040
I write books...

963
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:05,210
we invent a new language
that only you and I understand.

964
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,960
We go up the river
as far as it takes us.

965
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,240
Back in time
and into the future.

966
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,280
The very beginning of the end.

967
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,320
What would I do?

968
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,640
You'll share it with me.

969
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:33,410
The same air,
the same feelings, same tastes...

970
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,210
Things that you want...

971
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,600
you want them for yourself,
not for me.

972
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,920
I want them
for both of us.

973
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,600
He was hungry for me,
and for life.

974
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:54,440
But the journey he wanted to take
was into his own soul

975
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,840
not into mine.

976
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,200
I cannot do it,
Amadeu.

977
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,960
What do you mean?

978
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:19,050
You want more
than I can ever give.

979
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,810
And I'm not ready.

980
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,960
I'm so sorry...

981
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,370
I have friends
in Salamanca.

982
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,120
Will you take me to them?

983
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,880
He drove me to Salamanca...

984
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,480
he shook my hand,

985
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:13,920
he wished me well
and left.

986
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,840
The next I heard,
he was dead.

987
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,560
I always thought I killed him.

988
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,000
- He had an aneurysm.
- An aneurysm?

989
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,360
A blood vessel
burst in his brain.

990
01:37:36,361 --> 01:37:37,061
He...

991
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,760
He had it for a long time.

992
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,520
Did you go to his funeral?

993
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,120
You didn't really think
I would do it, did you?

994
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,600
It is no longer important.

995
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,660
So what happened to the

996
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:41,720
names and telephone numbers
you had in you head?

997
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,200
Lisbon

998
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:48,650
331-4518,
contact name, Carlos;

999
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:54,640
Sintra, 245-102,
contact name, Nuno...

1000
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:58,880
I wrote them all down and
passed them on to someone safe.

1001
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:03,760
A few months later they were
used to initiate the revolution.

1002
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,250
Your friend must be
very tire of waiting.

1003
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,160
- You can keep the book if you like.
- Thank you.

1004
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:21,320
And probably more ready for him now
than I was back then.

1005
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,360
- Goodbye, Raymund.
- Goodbye, Estefânia.

1006
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:48,840
"We leave something of ourselves behind
when we leave a place,"

1007
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,760
"we stay there,
even though we go away."

1008
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,480
"And there are things in us
that we can find again..."

1009
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:01,080
"only by going back there."

1010
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:05,440
"We travel to our souls
when we go to a place..."

1011
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,320
"that we have covered
a stretch of our life,"

1012
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,960
"no matter how brief
it may have been."

1013
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,320
This is me.

1014
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,840
Well, we still got...

1015
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,530
5 minutes.

1016
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,050
Thank you for...

1017
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,960
telling me I wasn't boring.

1018
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,600
But when I think of their lives,

1019
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,520
Amadeu, Estefânia,
the others,

1020
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:53,960
their lives full of such vitality,

1021
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:57,499
- intensity...
- So much so it broke them apart in the end.

1022
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:58,930
But they lived.

1023
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,680
Whereas my life...

1024
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:11,680
apart from these
last few days...

1025
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,440
And now you are
going back to it.

1026
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,720
Oh, why don't you just stay?

1027
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,720
What?

1028
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,480
Why don't you just stay?
