00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,060
[Chattering]

2
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,202
Thank you.

3
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,634
Hall.

4
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,712
<i>Come here, please.</i>

5
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,584
<i>- Sir?</i>
- Come on.

6
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,720
Have a good send-off?

7
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,722
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

8
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,724
Mr. Abrahams gave me a picture...

9
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,987
<i>The Light of the World.</i>

10
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,063
The fellas have given me a set of Guatemalas.

11
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,358
Up to two dollars!

12
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,832
The ones with the parrot
and the pillar on.

13
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,460
Look, sir.

14
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,904
Oh, splendid, splendid.

15
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,443
And, um, what did Mr. Abrahams say to you?

16
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,705
Told you you were a miserable sinner, I hope.

17
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,713
[Chuckles]

18
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,840
Mr. Abrahams said I'm never to do anything...

19
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,215
I'd be ashamed to do
in front of my mother.

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,220
He said my next school...

21
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,222
will be more like the world.

22
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,259
Did he? Did he?

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,591
What's the world like, do you suppose?

24
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,097
Don't know, sir. I'm a boy.

25
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,929
Do you, um, have
any older brothers, Hall?

26
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,935
No, sir. Only Kitty and Ada.

27
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,937
They're my sisters, sir.

28
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,404
No uncles?

29
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,702
No, sir.

30
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,404
There's Dr. Barry.
He knew my father before he died.

31
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:30,313
So you don't really know
a-a great many grown-up fellows.

32
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,316
No, not really, sir.

33
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,318
Mother keeps a coachman...

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,320
and George for the garden.

35
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,322
But of course, you mean gentlemen.

36
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,791
Hall, I'm going to talk to you
for a few moments...

37
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,954
as if I were your father.

38
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,429
It isn't anything your mother could say.

39
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,501
Do you... Do you see?

40
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,593
Your body...

41
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:56,107
is about to experience
various changes.

42
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,177
Physical changes.

43
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,441
Now, Mr. Abrahams has explained
to you that in the beginning...

44
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,914
"...God created he
man and woman...

45
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,076
that the earth
should be peopled abundantly."

46
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,154
Yes, sir. Sir...

47
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,517
what changes?

48
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,062
I speak, Hall...

49
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,395
of the sacred mystery of sex...

50
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,435
the act of procreation...

51
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,470
<i>between a man and his wife.</i>

52
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,699
<i>The... The procreation indeed...</i>

53
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,742
<i>of all creeping things.</i>

54
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,542
You will discover...

55
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,344
that your <i>membrum virilis...</i>

56
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,444
- That's Latin from <i>vir.</i>
<i>- Vir,</i> sir. It means man, sir.

57
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,319
Very good. Very good.
Um, uh, look.

58
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,394
Uh, this might be easier if I...

59
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,967
That. That... That, um...
That thing.

60
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,594
There. Now, that will...

61
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,542
develop and grow larger.

62
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,611
You see?

63
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,907
<i>And when that happens...</i>

64
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,916
<i>the man lies</i>
<i>very, very close to his wife...</i>

65
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:16,478
and he puts his <i>membrum virilis...</i>

66
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,615
into her vagina...

67
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,626
<i>thus.</i>

68
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,289
<i>Then, in due course,</i>
<i>she will bring forth his child.</i>

69
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,389
Seminiferous tubules...

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,231
<i>labia major and minor, ducts...</i>

71
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,674
vulva.

72
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,904
<i>That... That is</i>
<i>the very crown oflife, Hall.</i>

73
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,451
God's wondrous purpose.

74
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,680
<i>Your body is his temple.</i>

75
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,556
You must never, ever
pollute that temple.

76
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,926
And when,
as one day I... I'm sure you will...

77
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,000
you fall in love and marry,
you will discover...

78
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,127
to serve and protect a woman...

79
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,263
and have children by her...

80
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:11,002
is life's chiefest glory.

81
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,544
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,343
You must never, ever mention
any of this to your mother...

83
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,509
or... or... or indeed to any lady.

84
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,985
And if at your next school
the fellows mention it...

85
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,988
just shut them up.

86
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,990
Tell them you know.

87
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,060
I think I shan't marry.

88
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,857
What?
[Laughs]

89
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,558
Look, um, in 10 years to the day...

90
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,603
I invite you and your wife to dine
with me and my wife as our guests.

91
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,673
- What do you say?
- Oh, sir.

92
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,264
Yes. It's a bargain then, is it?
[Laughs]

93
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:50,147
[Grunts]
Oh, God. Those infernal designs.

94
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:57,385
Sir, won't they be all right?
The tide will have covered them by now.

95
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,925
[Sighs]

96
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,018
Oh, yes, the rising tide.

97
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,927
<i>I only hope to God he's right...</i>

98
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,660
<i>by God.</i>

99
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,105
[Gasps] Come, Victoria. Come.

100
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,072
<i>[Man] Wagner's utter rubbish.</i>
<i>Fat women with horns on their heads...</i>

101
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,048
<i>singing at the tops of their voices...</i>

102
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,050
<i>about how happy they are to be dying.</i>

103
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,052
<i>It's a horrible noise. And it's unhealthy.</i>

104
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,384
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>But music is about death. It always has been.</i>

105
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,390
<i>[Man #1] I think he's trying to provoke us.</i>

106
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,426
<i>Go on then, Risley. Enlighten us.</i>

107
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,087
<i>[Risley]</i>
<i>A superior mind wouldn't need enlightening.</i>

108
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,063
<i>Music is the highest of the arts.</i>

109
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,498
<i>It needs no reference to the figurative...</i>

110
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,502
or the corporeal.

111
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,869
It is therefore, of all the arts,
the closest to death.

112
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,943
Wagner's by no means unhealthy.

113
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,035
He's merely expressing
most exactly the state of things.

114
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,878
<i>[Man] Help yourselves to potatoes, Hall.</i>
<i>Don't stand on ceremony.</i>

115
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,077
I can't stand music.

116
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,587
Or concert halls.
I don't go in for being superior.

117
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,149
- Don't you? I do.
- Come along, Chapman. You're in need of food.

118
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,821
I expect Lord Risley isn't.

119
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,989
I've put him off with my low talk.

120
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,436
I simply can't think of a reply to that.

121
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,006
<i>What about saying nothing?</i>

122
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,132
Say nothing? Horrible.

123
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,267
He must be mad.

124
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,778
<i>[Man] What you do</i>
<i>is more important than what you say.</i>

125
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,411
Your deeds are more important
than your words.

126
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,749
<i>What is the difference?</i>
<i>Words</i> are <i>deeds.</i>

127
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,119
Are you trying to say
that these few minutes talking...

128
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,249
in the dean's rooms
have done nothing for you?

129
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,789
Will you, for instance,
ever forget that you've met me?

130
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,629
- [Laughing]
- You're confusing what is important...

131
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,499
with what is impressive.

132
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,268
Chapman and Hall will always remember
they've met you. Of that I have no doubt.

133
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,366
Exactly. Because of my conversation.

134
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,447
Oh, they'll forget that they were engaged
in the act of eating a cutlet.

135
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,643
At least the cutlet does some good to them.
You do not.

136
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:10,279
I mean, Dean, that a cutlet
merely influences their subconscious life.

137
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,653
I, by my words,
shape the consciousness.

138
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,159
<i>I am therefore not only</i>
<i>more impressive than the cutlet...</i>

139
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,628
but infinitely more important.

140
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,727
Your dean here dwells in superstitious clouds
of Christian self-righteousness.

141
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,364
Your dean pretends that
only insensate faith is of any significance.

142
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,807
<i>And daily he droops,</i>
<i>soporific, into his soup.</i>

143
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:35,677
Oh, Risley, shut up.
Come on.

144
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,215
I think if a man has ideas like that...

145
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,751
he should have the courtesy
to keep them to himself.

146
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,879
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>On the contrary, one must talk, talk, talk.</i>

147
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,153
<i>It's only by talking</i>
<i>that we shall caper upon the summit.</i>

148
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,854
Otherwise the mountains
will overshadow us.

149
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,861
<i>I'm sure, Hall, you will agree.</i>

150
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,573
Wait.

151
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,905
I'm eager to hear
more of your interesting ideas...

152
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,005
about words and deeds.

153
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,041
My rooms are in Trinity.

154
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,246
And I have a dining club
whose members would...

155
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,550
if I'm not mistaken, interest you.

156
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,328
No need to bring your chum.

157
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,432
Oh, well...

158
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,270
You're not going, are you?

159
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,049

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,759
Salutations, Risley.

162
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,327
You've bargained for more

You've, uh... You've bargained

<i>- Hello?</i>

- You're Durham, aren't you?
<i>- Yes.</i>

169
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,025
I was looking for Risley.
You don't know where he is?

170
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,621
He's debating at the Union.

171
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,201
I was just stealing
his "pathetic" symphony.

172
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,836
<i>I'm reading a paper on Tchaikovsky,</i>
<i>but I cannot find the third movement.</i>

173
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,068
If it's here at all,

<i>And I'm his brother, Frederick Scudder,</i>
<i>purveyor of viand, at your service.</i>

1642
02:07:09,688 --> 02:07:14,648
Ah. I am Mr. Borenius.
Alec is one of my parishioners.

1643
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:18,992
I've come to give him a letter of introduction
to an Anglican priest in Buenos Aires...

1644
02:07:19,098 --> 02:07:22,067
in the hopes that
he will be confirmed after landing.

1645
02:07:22,167 --> 02:07:26,467
- Very kind of you, sir, I'm sure.
<i>- [Whistle Blowing]</i>

1646
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:35,578
- How did you know so precisely
when the boat sailed?
<i>- [Man] All aboard who's coming aboard.</i>

1647
02:07:35,681 --> 02:07:38,707
- It was advertised.
<i>- All aboard now.</i>

1648
02:07:38,817 --> 02:07:43,516
May I speak frankly to you?
I'm far from easy about Scudder.

1649
02:07:43,622 --> 02:07:46,147
The fact is...

1650
02:07:46,258 --> 02:07:49,056
he has been guilty of sensuality...

1651
02:07:50,496 --> 02:07:52,396
with women.

1652
02:07:52,498 --> 02:07:54,591
It's not just the deed
of fornication.

1653
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:58,932
When the nations went a-whoring,
they invariably ended up by denying God.

1654
02:07:59,038 --> 02:08:01,871
Until all sexual irregularities,
and not some of them, are penal...

1655
02:08:01,974 --> 02:08:04,807
the church will never again
reconquer England.

1656
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:07,037
I have reason to believe...

1657
02:08:07,146 --> 02:08:11,310
Scudder spent
Tuesday night... in London...

1658
02:08:13,018 --> 02:08:14,986
fornicating.

1659
02:08:16,989 --> 02:08:21,722
I'm telling you all this
because of your charitable interest in him.

1660
02:08:21,827 --> 02:08:23,988
<i>[Bell Clanging]</i>

1661
02:08:24,096 --> 02:08:27,122
- But surely he wouldn't have missed his train.
<i>- [Whistle Blowing]</i>

1662
02:08:27,232 --> 02:08:31,032
- Well, they wouldn't leave without him.
<i>- [Frederick] He's late.</i>

1663
02:08:31,136 --> 02:08:33,661
He's bloody well missed
his bleeding train!

1664
02:08:33,772 --> 02:08:35,933
Gentlemen! Gentlemen.

1665
02:08:37,743 --> 02:08:39,870
Gentlemen, I do assure you...

1666
02:08:39,978 --> 02:08:43,709
<i>Mr. Scudder was booked for a passage.</i>

1667
02:08:43,816 --> 02:08:46,785
But his kit's aboard.
His kit's aboard.

1668
02:09:38,604 --> 02:09:40,572
[Chattering]

1669
02:09:49,815 --> 02:09:52,147
Clive.

1670
02:09:52,251 --> 02:09:54,617
Don't tell Anne I'm here.
I've only a few minutes.

1671
02:09:57,923 --> 02:10:00,391
I mean...
Look here, man, that's fantastic.

1672
02:10:00,492 --> 02:10:03,256
<i>She'll be furious</i>
<i>if you don't stay the night.</i>

1673
02:10:03,362 --> 02:10:05,455
Maurice, I hope nothing's wrong.

1674
02:10:05,564 --> 02:10:08,226
[Chuckles]
Pretty well everything.

1675
02:10:09,935 --> 02:10:11,903
You'd think so.

1676
02:10:32,491 --> 02:10:35,949
Very well. I'm at your service.

1677
02:10:36,061 --> 02:10:40,293
My advice, though, is to sleep here tonight
and ask Anne in the morning.

1678
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:44,233
Where a woman is in question,
it's always better to ask another woman...

1679
02:10:44,336 --> 02:10:46,998
and particularly if she has
Anne's almost uncanny insight.

1680
02:10:47,105 --> 02:10:49,369
I'm not here to see Anne.

1681
02:10:49,474 --> 02:10:52,068
Or you, Clive.
It's miles worse for you.

1682
02:10:53,545 --> 02:10:55,775
I'm in love with Alec Scudder.

1683
02:11:00,953 --> 02:11:03,353
What a grotesque announcement.

1684
02:11:08,327 --> 02:11:10,318
Most grotesque.

1685
02:11:10,429 --> 02:11:12,454
- But I felt I ought to tell you.
- Maurice...

1686
02:11:12,564 --> 02:11:15,795
Maurice, we did everything we could
when you and I thrashed out the subject.

1687
02:11:15,901 --> 02:11:19,302
- When you brought yourself to kiss my hand.
- Don't allude to that.

1688
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:24,775
Come in here.

1689
02:11:28,347 --> 02:11:31,248
I'm more sorry for you
than I can possibly say.

1690
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:35,719
And I do, do beg you to resist
the return of this obsession.

1691
02:11:35,821 --> 02:11:37,721
I don't need advice.

1692
02:11:37,823 --> 02:11:41,816
I'm flesh and blood, Clive,
if you'll condescend to such low things.

1693
02:11:43,929 --> 02:11:45,920
I've shared with Alec.

1694
02:11:47,132 --> 02:11:49,123
Shared... Shared what?

1695
02:11:50,168 --> 02:11:52,136
Everything.

1696
02:11:53,305 --> 02:11:56,468
Alec slept with me in the Russet Room
when you and Anne were away.

1697
02:11:56,575 --> 02:11:58,475
Oh, good God.

1698
02:12:00,946 --> 02:12:03,414
Also in town.

1699
02:12:03,515 --> 02:12:08,578
The sole excuse for any relationship between
two men is that it remain purely platonic.

1700
02:12:08,687 --> 02:12:12,487
- Surely we agreed that.
- I don't know.

1701
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:14,957
I've come to tell you what I did.

1702
02:12:15,994 --> 02:12:21,830
Well, Alec... Scudder... is in point of fact
no longer in my service.

1703
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:26,030
In fact, he's no longer in England.
He sailed for Buenos Aires this very day.

1704
02:12:26,138 --> 02:12:30,165
He didn't.
He sacrificed his career for my sake...

1705
02:12:30,275 --> 02:12:32,971
without a guarantee.

1706
02:12:33,078 --> 02:12:36,070
I don't know whether
that's platonic of him or not...

1707
02:12:36,181 --> 02:12:38,877
but it's what he did.

1708
02:12:38,984 --> 02:12:41,384
Scudder missed his boat?

1709
02:12:43,155 --> 02:12:45,248
Maurice, you're going mad.

1710
02:12:45,357 --> 02:12:49,088
- May I ask if you intend to pursue...
- No. No, you may not ask.

1711
02:12:49,194 --> 02:12:51,788
I'll tell you everything up to this minute.
Not a word beyond.

1712
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:08,402
<i>[Bird Squawking]</i>

1713
02:13:25,731 --> 02:13:27,631
Alec?

1714
02:13:55,227 --> 02:13:57,195
<i>[Water Drips]</i>

1715
02:14:10,142 --> 02:14:12,042
Alec.

1716
02:14:14,579 --> 02:14:16,979
So you got the wire, then?

1717
02:14:17,082 --> 02:14:19,573
What wire?

1718
02:14:19,684 --> 02:14:22,050
The wire I sent to your house...

1719
02:14:24,356 --> 02:14:26,347
telling you...

1720
02:14:26,458 --> 02:14:28,392
Oh, sorry.

1721
02:14:28,493 --> 02:14:30,484
I'm a bit tired,
what with one thing and another.

1722
02:14:33,598 --> 02:14:35,498
No. Telling you to come here...

1723
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:37,932
to the boathouse
at Pendersleigh without fail.

1724
02:14:51,983 --> 02:14:54,781
[Whispering]
Now we shan't never be parted.

1725
02:14:54,886 --> 02:14:56,854
It's finished.

1726
02:15:24,316 --> 02:15:26,284
Will that be all, sir?

1727
02:15:26,384 --> 02:15:28,284
Yes. Thank you, Simcox.

1728
02:15:28,386 --> 02:15:30,411
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1729
02:16:45,330 --> 02:16:47,298
<i>Come on!</i>

1730
02:17:02,013 --> 02:17:04,208
Who were you talking to?

1731
02:17:04,316 --> 02:17:06,648
[Chuckles]
No one. No one.

1732
02:17:06,751 --> 02:17:09,049
I was just trying out a speech.
