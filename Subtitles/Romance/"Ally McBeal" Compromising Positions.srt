We've got an emergency.

I appreciate this.

ALLY: Not now.

John's a cofounder.

00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:32,691
ALLY: Hi.
-He's loathe to meet you like this.

8
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:36,249
She'll handle the arraignment
and dispose of it.

9
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:38,723
-Give me the facts.
-You know them.

He pulled over to help her.

11
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:45,202
After he inserted his pride,
he realized she was a hooker.

12
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:48,286
-Is that my argument?
-You're the litigator.

-Two sell better than one.
-I can't sell.

I'm not endorsing prostitution.
But it's a waste trying to enforce it.

98

And it's okay for a girl to demand
a ring before sex, but not money.

Whipper likes to say "ring"
to torture me. Don't you?

00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,523
Me? No.

105
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:07,289

an easement on her breast. . .

-Tell that one when I return.

109
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:22,926

-No, is. . .

-Yes.

114

-I'm going to the bathroom.

118
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:56,084

-Yours aren't made with a mirror.

-Haven't I been nice to you?

130
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:48,202
No. Actually, you've been snappish.

131
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:51,490
-I have not been snappish.
-Yes, you have.

Whenever I inquire about
your welfare, you get short.

-Last night, I asked you--
-If I was ovulating.

134
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:01,968
And you answered snappish.

135
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:05,965
Anyway, I like you when you're sweet.

136
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:09,448
Is it because you want something?

137
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:14,762
Are Richard Fish and Whipper,
are they serious?

138
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:17,322
Oh, that.

139
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:21,131
He says that she's the one.

140
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,245
She could be the latest
relic of the month.

141
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:25,806

142
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:30,404
Would Richard ever use Whipper
to land a client?

00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:34,123

or, who knows. . .

145
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:41,732
I'm trying to get familiar
with the strategies of the firm.

146
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,731
Is this about Judge Boyle
letting John off?

147
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,488
No, but is there a story in that?

148
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:54,802
It's not my business, but Boyle was at
Billy's bachelor party last year.

149
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:58,883
-You know that they had one there.
-One what?

150
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,567
A hooker. For Billy.

151
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:06,887
ALLY: A hooker for my Billy?
-After Billy, some guests indulged.

152
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:12,127
And Judge Boyle was one of them.
Can you picture it?

153
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,326
It's not your business.

154
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:20,212
-How in God's name--?
-It wasn't in God's name.

155
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:22,364
-Does Georgia know?
-Of course not.

156
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:26,162
-I'd appreciate your not telling her.
-Oh, Billy.

157
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:29,604
-I don't want to talk.
-I have a right to know.

158
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:32,407
-Ex-girlfriends don't have rights.
-I do.

159
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,924
We'd all been drinking.

160
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:45,489
And I was a drunk idiot.
What else can I say?

161
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:49,282
-You act like I betrayed you.
-Well, in a way, you did.

162
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:54,327
If I had been the one you married,
the same thing--

163
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,525
-It doesn't sound like you.
-It meant nothing.

164
00:09:57,813 --> 00:10:00,771
What if Georgia had a male hooker?

165
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:02,725
-It's not the same.
-How?

166
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,050
Women don't have
the same sex-drive thing. . .

167
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,642
. . .despite what's in Cosmopolitan.

168
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,487
-You know this for a fact?
-So do you.

169
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:15,891
This makes men stupid.
This makes women stupid.

170
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:20,052
It's more of a betrayal when
women cheat. It's more mental.

171
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:21,965
It's a cerebral thing.

172
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:27,008
With men, a lot of the time it's
just body parts, like that night.

173
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:30,091
I'm shocked by what's
coming from your mouth.

174
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:33,091
Considering where it's been,
I shouldn't be.

175
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,729
Did you cheat on me?

176
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:49,928
Ally, if I'd cheat,
I'd lie about it, wouldn't l?

177
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:56,963
But the answer is no.
I never cheated on you.

178
00:10:57,653 --> 00:10:59,132
[KNOCKING]

179
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:01,725
Ally, you remember Ronny?

180
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,324
-Yeah, hi.
-Hey.

181
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:10,368
Maybe you could answer his questions
about our litigation department.

182
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:13,646
-Sure.
-I thought we'd go grab a drink.

183
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:16,361
-At 6?
ALLY: I'd rather have a root canal.

184
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:19,650
Well, l. . . .

185
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,124
Sounds good.

186
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:31,683
ALLY: Just saying yes to a drink
made me have to run home and shower.

187
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:34,931
I'm having drinks with a man
to get ahead.

188
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:39,726
It doesn 't matter
that I'm not in a relationship.

189
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:44,925
Sometimes I feel I'm just
being unfaithful to love itself.

190
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:51,572
So, what are your questions
about our litigation department?

191
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:54,970
I don't have any questions.
That was a pretext.

192
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,123
ALLY:
Pig!

193
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,963
My question goes more to the integrity
of the firm, in general.

194
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:04,888
-I beg your pardon?
-I know about John and the prostitute.

195
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,169
We all know Richard Fish.

196
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,722
Is the firm, I don't know, moral?

197
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,971
I saw you kiss Whipper.

198
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:16,532
-Oh.
-Yeah, oh.

199
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:20,522
What exactly was the ethical
pulse throbbing there?

200
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:22,485
Well, uh. . . .

201
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,048
ALLY:
Here comes the sex-drive speech.

202
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:29,923
That was a sort of spur-of-the-moment
whim thing that just. . .

203
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:32,126
. . .happened.

204
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:35,127
Is that it or have you explained it?

205
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,928
I can't really defend it. . .

206
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:43,605
. . .but it's certainly not as
despicable as what John Cage did.

207
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:46,725
Do you think that was despicable?

208
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,127
Don't you?

209
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,407
He's a man. Boys will be boys.

210
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:53,291
Do you really think that?

211
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:56,929
It's no different than, say--
Take a bachelor party.

212
00:12:57,173 --> 00:13:00,927
Should guys go to court
for fooling around with a hooker?

213
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,489
It's a crime and it's immoral.

214
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:08,811
Somebody's going to marry somebody?
How could you fool around?

215
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:11,208
A bachelor party is no exception.

216
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,251
ALLY:
I kind of like him.

217
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:19,326
It started to happen.
Whether it was the wine, his eyes...

218
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,570
...or my need to forget about Billy.

219
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:25,725
I didn 't invite anything.
My body was stiff...

220
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:29,124
...hands behind my back
and I only smiled medium.

221
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:30,726
Even so.

222
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:34,726
-It's late, huh?
-Yeah.

223
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,484
-Long day.
-Very long, boy.

224
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,008
-This day.
-It's long.

225
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:43,532
So long.

226
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:53,688
Good night.

227
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:01,723
Good night.

228
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:21,731
-You kissed him?
-No, no, no!

229
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:25,645
I didn't really kiss him.
It was a half-kiss.

230
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:28,646
Last night, this guy
tongue-waggled Gipper.

231
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:32,044
-Whipper.
-Does he go around kissing everybody?

232
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:34,090
He had a reason to kiss her.

233
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:36,005
What?

234
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:41,812
He was angry at Richard for
bringing me there as window-dressing.

235
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:47,252
He bumped into Whipper.
She looked nice and was flirting. . .

236
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:51,771
. . .and he decided to kiss Richard's
girlfriend. A whim took over.

237
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:56,206
He sounded better.

238
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:59,963
-Working with Billy--
-He has nothing to do with it.

239
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:03,086
-Kissing a guy you don't like--
-He looked good.

240
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:06,441
Why can't women act
like men sometimes?

241
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:11,130
I liked a piece of meat so I said,
"You only live once! Be a man! "

242
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:18,932
RICHARD:
All right!

243
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:23,329
I don't drink this early,
but we should celebrate.

244
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,808
-Way to go, Ally. Again.
-Thanks.

245
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,890
I thought he'd spit the hook.

246
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,765
Whatever you did to him. . .

247
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,042
. . .it worked.

248
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:38,011
Richard, can I speak with you
for a second in private?

249
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:40,604
Sure. Billy, do you mind?

250
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,730
I'll fill you in later.

251
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:45,291
-I'm kidding.
BILLY: I'm gone.

252
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:48,326
-Congratulations, again.
-Thanks.

253
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:54,332
I don't think we should
accept this client.

254
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:58,732
-Seriously.
-I'm not comfortable with him.

255
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:03,768
I don't want him in these offices.
Taking his business will be a problem.

256
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:07,130
"Problem" is a bleak word
for "challenge. "

257
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:11,048
This is a cash cow.
You don't have to do the milking. . .

258
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:13,329
. . .but we will take this client.

259
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,203
-Anything else?
-He kissed Whipper.

260
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,568
-I beg your pardon?
-At dinner.

261
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:22,287
By the bathroom.

262
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:25,128
-I saw it.
-Seriously?

263
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:28,171
This is serious. They were kissing.

264
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:30,564
-In the restaurant?
-Yes.

265
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,804
-They were kissing?
-Yes.

266
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:35,163
-Each other?
-Yes.

267
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:44,245
I'm sorry, Richard.
I just felt like I had to tell you.

268
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:46,529
No, I'm glad you did.

269
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,330
It wasn't on the cheek?

270
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:57,885
-It was on the lips?
-It was a heavy-duty kiss.

271
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,527
Well. . . .

272
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:04,131
No big deal.

273
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:10,328
Not a big thing.

274
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:14,882
I'll consider whether or not
we take on the client.

275
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:17,249
So, thank you. That will be all.

276
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:20,326
-Are you okay?
-Me? I'm fine.

277
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:22,407
Bygones.

278
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:25,006
Okay.

279
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:36,521
Richard?

280
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:41,529
I feel I've lost the confidence of
the office, and if you don't mind. . .

281
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:44,162
. . .I'd like to address all personnel.

282
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:46,402
Fine.

283
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:49,168
I'll circulate a memo.

284
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,008
-So you told him?
ALLY: Was it wrong?

285
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:06,404
You should've seen his face.
He was so hurt.

286
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,372
I just thought that he should know.

287
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,204
-You did the right thing.
-Really?

288
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:16,122
He's got to know, right?
I mean, it's his girlfriend.

289
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,691
Should I tell Georgia?

290
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:25,931
About the other?

291
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,328
No.

292
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:32,562
She's my wife.
Maybe I should be honest.

293
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,925
If it's right to tell Richard
the truth, what's the difference?

294
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,721
Telling him will save him
future hurt.

295
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:42,924
-Yours is past tense and--
-What?

296
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:47,052
There's no point in the truth
if the only thing it will do. . .

297
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,329
. . .is cause pain.

298
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:51,730
There is a difference.

299
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:58,926
One person who does need
to hear a few things is Whipper.

300
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:02,523
-Know where I can find her?
-Try the courthouse.

301
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:05,731
-Why the courthouse?
-She works at Suffolk.

302
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:06,968
She does?

303
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,171
She's a judge, Ally.
Judge Cone?

304
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:11,488
You didn't know?

305
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:14,926
No.

306
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:28,606
ALLY: A judge? Even people we call
Your Honor don 't have any honor.

307
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:32,971
It shouldn 't be legal to be
a judge with a name like Whipper.

308
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,244
-You told him?
-How could I not?

309
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:37,892
Because you hurt him.

310
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,089
-I hurt him?
-Yes, you did.

311
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,769
What happened had absolutely
no meaning until now.

312
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:48,046
-You have given it meaning.
-You expect that to sound right?

313
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:52,525
The truth isn't the best thing
when the only consequence is pain.

314
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:56,322
-I'll remember for your courtroom.
-Is he okay?

315
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:58,723
No, he's not okay.

316
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:00,406
That's why I'm here.

317
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:04,441
Do you have another name?
Whipper seems too informal.

318
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:06,126
I have to see him.

319
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,490
You're supposed to avoid impropriety.

320
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:12,810
All you did was see.
There's always more.

321
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:16,130
Yeah, like Richard's feelings.

322
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,601
-What did she say to that?
-Nothing.

323
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:32,732
-She was coming to see you.
-That won't do her any good.

324
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:36,370
We're having quite
the intrusive morning, so far.

325
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:39,650
I'm feeling what it's like to be you.

326
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:41,929
Snappish.

327
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:46,526
ELAINE:
Oh, come on.

328
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:52,442
-I don't understand.
-I'm sorry. . .

329
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:55,685
. . .but things just aren't
gonna work out.

330
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:00,405
I thought we were getting along.

331
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:03,332
Richard Fish is turning
down my business--

332
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:06,969
Ronny, take my word on this.
It's not gonna work out.

333
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:10,531
I have to ask you to leave.
Stay anyway.

334
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:12,684
-You want me to leave?
-No.

335
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:13,968
Yes.

336
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:29,882
Wait, Ronny.

ELAINE: Snappish.

340
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,329
Ally, this is silly. You and me.

341
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:51,093
How about we go to lunch?

342
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:55,565
Sure. That would probably be
a good idea.

343
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:59,004
Excuse me.
Could I have everyone's attention?

344
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:13,725
I think most of you know. . .

345
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:18,524
. . .nothing matters to me more
than this firm and the people here.

346
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:22,728
So it's with a lot of humility. . .

347
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:25,726
. . .that I apologize
for what I've done. . .

348
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:29,409
. . .for the embarrassment I caused.

349
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:31,761
It's not easy. . .

350
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:35,921
. . .to be a single, working man
in this world.

351
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:39,882
Fourteen-hour days.
It's not easy to meet women.

352
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:46,132
I could buy a lady a drink and under
the pretext of a relationship. . .

353
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:49,047
. . .seduce her into satisfying
my sexual needs.

354
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:51,727
But that goes against my grain. . .

355
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:55,847
. . .to deceive, no matter
the physical gratification.

356
00:22:56,453 --> 00:23:01,447
So I thought it more honest
to solicit a prostitute.

357
00:23:02,653 --> 00:23:05,850
No lies, no deception. . .

358
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:10,126
. . .no potential for someone
with a vulnerable heart. . .

359
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:14,532
. . .to rely falsely, to her detriment.

360
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:17,731
What I did was technically illegal.
It was.

361
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:21,165
But morally, I believe
I was on higher ground.

362
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:28,161
It's ironic that I got arrested for
having too much respect for a woman. . .

363
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:31,086
. . .any woman, to lie.

364
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,522
For that, I could never be ashamed.

365
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:36,728

Oh, God. He's gonna be honest.

What's the matter?

00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:16,008
There's something you got to know.

372
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:20,328
It happened a while ago.
It had no meaning whatsoever.

373
00:24:20,573 --> 00:24:23,451
What? You're kind of scaring me.

374
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:26,526

Good speech out there, huh?

Would you excuse us?
This is private.

00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:37,809
-Yeah. What part did I come in on?
-What is this?

-No! It involves me, I'll tell.
-What?

Somebody better start telling.

Okay.

Will I excuse you?

390
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:14,886
See, Georgia,
before you were married. . . .

391
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,971
Actually, the very first day
he met you. . .

392
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:20,966
. . .he saw your thigh.

393
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:24,930
My thigh?

394
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:29,451
And he thought it was me because
he has always loved my thighs.

395
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,729
And when he first saw you--

396
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:35,164
I mean, your thigh, because
he wasn't looking up. . .

397
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:37,768
. . .he felt all nostalgic.

398
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:41,331
Do you see how our thighs are similar?

399
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:45,963
He was captured by your thigh.
Then he looked up. . .

400
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:51,412
. . .and it wasn't my face and he fell
madly in love with you and your thigh.

401
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:55,647
And I felt that since
my thigh was involved. . .

402
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:59,926

-If you had told her--

404
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:13,366
-"Your thigh. " Where'd you get that?
-I don't know.

405
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:18,812
I was thinking about what you said
about body parts so I thought of that.

406
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:23,888
And a thigh seemed
pretty innocent as parts go.

407
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,443
You are something.

408
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,329
You would have destroyed her.

A clear conscience wouldn't
have been worth it.

00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:39,725

-He was scared it would hurt you.

of another woman's leg.

You think men go for parts,
but it's more mental for women?

I don't know. I do know that if
I were gonna fantasize, you know--?

00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:16,248
Sorry.

506
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:18,648
I'm not even 30 and you do this?

507
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:21,123
What if I'm old and gray?
Or bald?

508
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:25,286
I think anybody could be guilty
of an indiscretion. Once.

509
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:30,932
Great.

510
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:34,723
ALLY:
They love each other.

511
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:37,329
This is all my fault.

512
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:42,170
-We need to talk.
-I can't talk to you now.

513
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:45,928
How about never? ls never good?
I hated your speech.

514
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:49,331
Snappish.

515
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:50,932
[KNOCKING]

516
00:32:53,413 --> 00:32:55,768
-You have to give her a chance.
-Why?

517
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,725
Because you love her.

518
00:32:58,013 --> 00:33:01,130
Because there aren't
"plenty of fish in the sea. "

519
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:05,087
Sometimes there's only one fish.
Trust me.

520
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:08,724
Hey! Private!

521
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:16,162
-Think he heard that?
-How? He was at least a yard away.

522
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,371
-Do you love her?
-I'm not sure.

523
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,927
I think so, but it could be. . . .

524
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,401
-Maybe it's just the wattle.
-Excuse me?

525
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:33,602
I like the hint of a wattle in
older women. Loose skin on the neck.

526
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:37,643
It's so arousing for me,
the way it gently hangs.

527
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:42,603
Whipper's neck is tight now, but it
has potential. It'll be so perfect.

528
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,526
Do I love her,
or the impending wattle?

529
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,604
It just makes me crazy.

530
00:33:47,853 --> 00:33:50,128
Well, that's always the question.

531
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:55,401
If there's a possibility you love her,
you have to take those chances.

532
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:04,128
She's. . . .

533
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:07,566
She said she'd be waiting
in the bathroom.

534
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:12,923
Okay. Okay.

535
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:15,726
Thank you.

536
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:16,729
Look.

537
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:20,084
I don't care if I'm not
represented by the firm.

538
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:22,124
I'd like to see you again.

539
00:34:23,173 --> 00:34:25,926
You don't know what
you're getting into.

540
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:28,129
That would be the fun part.

541
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:30,728
I can't. I, l. . .maybe next week.

542
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:34,130
Next week. That would be fine.
I'll call you.

543
00:34:35,613 --> 00:34:37,922
-A two?
-Excuse me?

544
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:41,404
My questionnaire.
You gave me a two. Total.

545
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,163
You asked for candor.

546
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:49,009
"More honest to solicit a hooker?"
What would you have scored?

547
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,402
-Five.
-Five?

548
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:53,725
-Under comments you wrote "Imp"?
-I'm sorry, John.

549
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:58,046
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I was offended by what you said.

550
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:00,922
I just don't understand
how you can--

551
00:35:01,173 --> 00:35:03,812
You know what? Just forget it.

552
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:08,007
-Can I ask you a question?
-Anything.

553
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:11,165
-Do you have sex often?
-You can't ask me that!

554
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:15,326
-You don't know me!
-I'm single and work all the time. . .

555
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:19,446
. . .and I go years, sometimes,
without.

556
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:25,169
Do men just have to have it?

557
00:35:26,893 --> 00:35:28,451
On occasion, yes.

558
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:34,206
Maybe my score should be docked
for saying I can go to a bar. . .

559
00:35:34,453 --> 00:35:37,286
. . .and hit on a woman
for a one-night stand.

560
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:40,724
The truth is, that is
not an option for me.

561
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:45,449
Whatever a woman's vision
of an evening of passion may be. . .

562
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:49,243
. . .I rarely find myself
in the picture.

563
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:52,326
It's still not an excuse for. . . .

564
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:59,129
In high school, I picked up a nickname
which follows me to this day.

565
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,925
Know what they call me?

566
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:02,809
No.

567
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:05,324
"The Little Biscuit. "

568
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:12,411
They used to call me "The Popsicle. "

569
00:36:16,413 --> 00:36:19,132
-Sorry isn't enough.
-You're not forgiving.

570
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,652
So I'm to blame?

571
00:36:20,893 --> 00:36:23,726
I'm to blame, damn it.
I'm owning that!

572
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:26,929
-Oh, Richard.
-I just can't!

573
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:30,962
Come here.

574
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:36,683
Don't do this.

575
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:38,921
Richard.

576
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:41,321
No, no, no.

577
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:45,528
No. You can't just undo things
with sex every time.

578
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:47,325
Nuckie.

579
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:51,450
-This is not fair.
-It's never fair.

580
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:59,446
Touch it. Touch it.

581
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:05,645
-Touch it.
-I can't.

582
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:09,286
Just touch it.

583
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,451
Touch it.

584
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:28,127
BILLY:
Hey.

585
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,052
Billy. Hi.

586
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:34,611
Why do you care so much?

587
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:36,529
Excuse me?

588
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:40,248
Why do you care if Whipper
and Richard get together?

589
00:37:40,453 --> 00:37:41,852
I don't know.

590
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:46,445
It's um. . . .

591
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:51,484
Being around Elaine so much,
part of her rubbed off on me.

592
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:55,242
Now I have a desire to
butt into everybody's business.

593
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,364
Really, why?

594
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,563
I need to believe that it works.

595
00:38:11,653 --> 00:38:14,042
-What works?
-Love.

596
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:16,251
Couplehood.

597
00:38:17,453 --> 00:38:19,091
Partnerships.

598
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:24,841
The idea that people who
come together, they stay together.

599
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:29,331
I have to take that to bed at night,
even if I'm going alone.

600
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:35,601
That's a McBealism.

601
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,045
There's a singer

602
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:49,522
She stands up when she plays...

603
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:52,924
...her piano

604
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:57,528
In the nightclub

605
00:38:57,973 --> 00:39:00,487
There's a singer

606
00:39:01,613 --> 00:39:05,572
She sings songs for the lost...

607
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:08,771
...and the lonely

608
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:18,885
ALLY: Maybe it's because love
is about learning to compromise.

609
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:23,649
That's why they get into compromising
positions. It's research.

610
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:27,722
Whatever the secret is,
I don 't think I'm gaining on it.

611
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:36,451
I don 't need the answers.
I've got friends. I've got hope.

612
00:39:37,453 --> 00:39:39,648
I've got twins.

613
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:44,402

You stinker!
