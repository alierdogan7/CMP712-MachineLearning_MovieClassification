00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:04,407
<i>Go, now! Go! </i>

2
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:07,882
Excuse me...

3
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:10,616
Could you spare some
change, for a phone call?

4
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:12,352
lt's an emergency.

5
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,950
See, okay, see, this guy, like...

6
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:19,761
robbed our bus tickets and
you know my sister and l...

7
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,664
We're, we're twins--

8
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:23,566
No, we're not the kind
of twins who look alike.

9
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:25,605
We just finish
each other's sentences.

10
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,663
That was cool.
How'd we do that?

11
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:32,035
H i, could you spare some change?

12
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:36,639
She's upset, you see...

13
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:40,050
you look a little like
her mother who's in a coma.

14
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:49,083
Excuse her, she's hypoglycemic...

15
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:52,427
l've got to get her some chocolate.

16
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:55,261
<i>So l started hanglng</i>
<i>out wlth Rayanne Graff, </i>

17
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:59,799

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,083
<i>How they always expect you to be a</i>
<i>certaln way, even your best frlend, </i>

21
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:22,523
So then she admits that she only
joined the yearbook to be near Scott...

22
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,587
which is like so low.

23
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:28,963
l mean, it's just, l know, if she
doesn't want to be in yearbook...

24
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,026
she should, like, quit...

25
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:36,536
<i>Llke wlth boys, </i>

...so typical, of the way she is...

32
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:14,103
l mean, she always
does stuff like that.

33
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:17,173
l mean, it's not like too
embarrassing for me to know this...

34
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,740
you know?

35
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,831
Who are you looking for?

36
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:33,888
Nobody.

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,469
<i>School ls a battlefleld, </i>

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,739
<i>So when Rayanne Graff told me</i>

39
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,074
<i>l had to llsten, </i>

40
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:50,443
<i>Because she wasn't just</i>
<i>talklng about my halr, </i>

41
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:54,413
<i>She was talklng about my llfe, </i>

42
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:02,384
So it is you.

43
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,888
l had my hair dyed.

44
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:10,903
Oh, you had it dyed. l thought
it had died of natural causes.

45
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,963
Angela, come on, l'm star--

46
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:17,973
starving.

47
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,302
You're Angela's mom?

48
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:23,211
Yes. l am. That's true.

49
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:28,083
- l like your house.
- Thank you. Who are you?

50
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:32,024
This is Rayanne, and Rickie.

51
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:41,033
You dyed your hair. Okay.
Well here is some cheese...

52
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:46,295

- ...fridge?

53
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:48,500
Thank you. So.

54
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:55,279
Okay, l'm leaving now.
Well not the house, the room.

55
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:58,280
- She's nice.
- Not really.

56
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:01,852
- She took your hair real calm.
- J ust because you two are here.

57
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:04,754
Good cheese.

58
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,290

Wait, don't tell me,
there's something different.

65
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:36,378
l would never dye my hair red.

66
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,425
lt's not red, it's crimson glow.

67
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:43,024
l can see it now...

68
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:47,465

00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,666
- l mean it's her hair.
- Exactly.

73
00:04:57,744 --> 00:05:03,114
And we'll always be able
to spot you in a crowd.

74
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,407
Lately l can't even look
at my mother...

75
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,420
without wanting
to stab her repeatedly.

76
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:17,795
Hey! Who left all those
lights on down there?

77
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:22,625
l just, okay...

78
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:25,671
Danielle's still afraid of the dark.
She leaves the lights on.

79
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:27,602
l don't leave the lights on.

80
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:30,905
Well, good, okay. l just...

- <i>And l'm not afrald of the dark, </i>

83
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:39,184
<i>My dad and l used to</i>
<i>be pretty tlght,,, </i>

84
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,010
How's school?

85
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:47,216
- l'm starting to like "Anne Frank."
- ls she a sophomore too?

86
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:51,695
- No, she's dead.
- Oh, right, yeah.

87
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:53,822
Anne Frank, Dad!

88
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,897
Oh! Right, right, l mean...

89
00:05:57,671 --> 00:06:01,732
Okay. Don't stay up too late.

90
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:05,938
<i>The sad truth ls, my breasts</i>
<i>have come between us, </i>

91
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:13,244
Tell her not to walk
around in a towel, okay?

92
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:16,355
- You can tell her.
- No, l can't.

93
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:19,392
lf l could tell her,
l would tell her. You tell her.

94
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:24,690
Or get her a bigger towel.

95
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:27,096
God, Chelsea Clinton.
Will you look at this?

96
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:34,596
No freedom, no privacy, constant
surveillance, Secret Service men.

97
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,501
That's what we need.

98
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:49,451
Patty, it could be a lot worse.

99
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:52,414
l know.

100
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,026
l mean, she could be
cutting class, doing drugs.

101
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:06,631
Having sex. Like we did.

102
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:11,405
l never cut class, and you
never had sex in high school.

103
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:16,541
You know, l know why she did it.
She did it to get me to react.

104
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,174
Maybe she just did it to do it.

105
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,481
- No, she did it to get a reaction.
- Well then don't react!

106
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,215
l'm not. l won't.

107
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:39,229
lt's just, so hard to look at her.
She looks like a stranger.

108
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,449
<i>l'm ln love, </i>

00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:55,978
Who. Jordan. Catalano.

116
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,979
Come on, l'm not going to tell
anyone, just admit it.

117
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:05,148
l just like how he's always
leaning. Against stuff.

118
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,449
He leans great.

119
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:10,758
Either sex or a conversation.
ldeally both.

120
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,928
Well, you have to come to

Okay. Take your seats

This room is a disaster.

You know you could have
told me you were quitting.

Well don't thank me or anything.

Get out of my room.

157

And when were you
planning on telling me?

158

Listen to me.
' l thought you liked yearbook. '

'Your room is a disaster. '

You got to come to Tino's tonight.

167
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:21,117
Rickie, give us the male perspective.

168
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,178
Don't you love how he leans?

169
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:26,692
See, l don't get obsessed with him,
so l don't have these problems.

170
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:30,185
Oh God, that's the second bell.

171
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:35,360
l mean, l may as well go to Bio.

172
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,097
Since l'm not all that busy.

173
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:56,378
And, what is the purpose of plasma?

174
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:02,217
The purpose of plasma is to...what?

175
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,162
Why do we need plasma?

176
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,389
Brian?

177
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:11,059
Because the league of nations failed.

178
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:14,900
And why did the league
of nations fail?

179
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:19,667
Brian.

180
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,508
Because it's written
in the first person.

181
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,011
Exactly, thank you.

182
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,746
Does she say:
'She was forced to go into hiding'?

183
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:31,356
Somebody else besides Brian.

184
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,917
- Brian?
- No.

185
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:40,989
No, she says, ' l',
' l was forced to go into hiding. '

186
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:46,769
lt's called the first person, okay?
This will be on the quiz.

187
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,208
So how would you
describe Anne Frank?

188
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:54,273
Lucky.

189
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,439
ls that supposed
to be funny, Angela?

190
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:05,755
How on earth could you make
a statement like that?

191
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:20,570
Anne Frank perished
in a concentration camp.

192
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:25,038
Anne Frank is a tragic figure.
How could Anne Frank be lucky?

193
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,041
l don't know.

194
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:30,705
Because she was
trapped in an attic...

195
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:33,445
for three years with
this guy she really liked?

196
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:50,361
Excuse my eating,
but with all these cutbacks...

197
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:53,667
l don't really get a
lunch break on Thursdays.

198
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,571
Sit down, Angela.

199
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:06,849
<i>Seelng a teacher's actual</i>
<i>lunch ls, llke, so depresslng, </i>

200
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,246
<i>Not to mentlon her bra strap, </i>

201
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:15,685
So, you quit yearbook?
No explanation.

202
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,124
Your appearance has altered.

203
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:25,100
l'm really concerned you're
getting off on the wrong foot.

204
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:28,466
ls there a problem at home?

205
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:36,444
lt just seems like...

206
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:41,009
you agree to have a certain
personality or something.

207
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:47,215
For no reason. J ust to make
things easier for everyone.

208
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:53,896
But when you think about it,
how do you know it's even you?

209
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:03,565
And, l mean, this whole thing
with yearbook. lt's like...

210
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:07,170
everybody is in this
big hurry to make this book...

211
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:10,147
to supposedly remember
what happened but...

212
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,015
it's not even what really happened,
it's what everyone thinks...

213
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:16,554
was supposed to happen.

214
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,923
Because if you made a book
of what really happened...

215
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,855
it'd be a really upsetting book.

216
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,931
You know, in my humble opinion.

217
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,312
<i>My dad sells prlntlng, </i>

218
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:53,014
<i>lt was ln my mom's famlly, </i>

219
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:56,289
<i>My dad was just supposed</i>
<i>to do lt for a whlle,,, </i>

220
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:59,092
<i>then he was supposed to go</i>
<i>chef school, but he never dld, </i>

221
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,224
<i>l'm not sure why, </i>

222
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:06,695
You should see what they call
"chili con carne" at school.

223
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:10,333
- First of all, it's just beans.
- That's not "chili con carne."

224
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,207
- l know.
- "Con carne." With meat.

225
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,109
l know.

226
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,842
l think it's the lack of meat
is destroying America.

227
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,416
<i>My mom took over the buslness, </i>

228
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,681
<i>She's klnd of my dad's boss now,,, </i>

229
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:25,087
<i>whlch l guess he trles</i>
<i>not to thlnk about, </i>

230
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,592
Mom won't be home until late.

231
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,924
You know, l think you give her...

232
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:36,661
too hard a time, sometimes.

233
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,833
She just wants you to be happy.
She wants everyone to be happy.

234
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,499
No, that's you.

235
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:50,273
My point...l mean.

236
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,746
Think of all the things
that she does, for you.

237
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:02,051
Out of nowhere,
she'll get in this mood.

238
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:05,760
And her lips will get all tight.

239
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,000
lt's just so obvious that she's
looking for someone to blame.

240
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,261
Yeah.

241
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:18,800
But you know
that's not the real her.

242
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:22,536
J ust try to be nicer to her.

243
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,548
Once in a while.

244
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,610
As an experiment.

245
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,049
Okay.

246
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:41,230
Dad, there's this thing tonight...

247
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,632
at a friend of Rayanne's house.

248
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,903
Like, this rehearsal?

249
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:54,010
For this play that we might
all do as extra credit.

250
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,247
And l know mom says
no going out on school nights...

251
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,841
but this is like part of school...

252
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,855
and l won't be home late,
and l just really want to go.

253
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:00,095
This doesn't seem like a Friday.

254
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:04,062
lt's Thursday.

255
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,671
Are you sure?

256
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:13,809
Yesterday was Wednesday, so...

257
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:18,609
Oh...right.

258
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:22,412
So, that's how l know.

259
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:32,123
Jordan, this bites.
Let's go over to Grunden's.

260
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:47,535
- The point is--
- No, l know what the point is.

261
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,878
The point is...l can't believe
we're having this conversation.

262
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,041
- l know.
- l can't believe it.

263
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:55,916
- We need a new conversation.
- l shouldn't have allowed her to--

264
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,419
Why do l always have
to be the mean one?

265
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:01,219
Why can't you be the mean
one every once in a while?

266
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:04,456
- l can be!
- But you never are. Look...

267
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,655
l'm calm, okay?

268
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:09,724
But you can't keep letting...

269
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:12,100
l mean you know she
loves you more anyway...

270
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:13,695
She doesn't love me more!

271
00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:16,400
She does. Come on.
She loves you more.

272
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:18,966
l accept that. But,
that's not enough for you.

273
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,805
You have to--

274
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,840
l don't want to fight. Actually...

275
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:28,751
l'm not even that upset.

276
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:36,323
Where the hell have you been?
Oh my God, what happened to you?

277
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:37,521
Are you alright? What happened?

278
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,928
Did you explain it to her?

279
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:44,559
- Excuse me, you explain it to her.
- Alright. Maybe it isn't her fault!

280
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:47,264
Graham, of course it's
her fault, she snowed you!

281
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:49,000
- l told you she said--
- Shut up!

282
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,903
- What did l do?
- l'm sorry, sweetheart.

283
00:23:52,678 --> 00:23:55,078
Could we just find out what
happened? Could we just find out--

284
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,681
How do you expect her to
have any respect for me?

285
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,548
l respect you, God!

286
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:07,348
Nothing happened.
l fell in some mud. l'm alright.

287
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:21,529
l think we should all go to bed.

288
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,657
What really happened?

289
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,408
So there's this rave tonight,
okay, at that club, Let's Bolt.

290
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:09,545
Tino can get us in. Guaranteed,
Jordan Catalano will be there.

291
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,689
What? lt's perfect, and you don't
have to think of anything to say...

292
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:14,919
to him because no one
can hear anybody.

293
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,122
l think lard is my
favorite food group.

294
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:27,795
<i>The cafeterla ls the embarrassment</i>
<i>capltal of the world, </i>

295
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:30,264
<i>lt's llke a prlson movle, </i>

296
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:37,138
So, where do you want to sit?

297
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:39,377
l don't have anything to
wear to a place like that.

298
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:42,009
l'll lend you something.

299
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:45,682
You have to look tough. Somebody
once set fire to my hair at Let's Bolt.

300
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:48,249
Wait, so what's fat- free?

301
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:52,259
When something's, like, free. Of fat.

302
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:55,323
What's the difference between
fat- free, and like, nonfat?

303
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,166
Good question.

304
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,571
l'd have to think of a lie.

305
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,465
Simple. You're staying
over at my place.

306
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:08,769
And it's a perfect lie,
because you can stay over.

307
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:10,838
My mom won't even be there.

308
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:13,949
l've got to go find Tino.

309
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:18,345
Think about it.

310
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,489
ls there any soap in there?

311
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:31,299
There's never soap.

312
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,729
H i.

313
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:52,846
So l...l just think you should know
what people are saying about you.

314
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:54,718
What?

315
00:26:56,061 --> 00:27:00,327
That you think
you're so above everyone.

316
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:05,068
And that Rayanne Graff
is like God to you now...

317
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:07,128
and you just do whatever she says.

318
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,731
And by the way, she's just using
you like she did with Jody Barsh.

319
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:13,007
l just thought you should know.

320
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,504
What'd she do to Jody Barsh?

321
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:20,242
Oh please. That's like so known.

322
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,850
So tell me what l did, Angela.

323
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:28,916
l mean, l would
really like to know.

324
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:33,220
Nothing. lt's not
something that you--

325
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:35,789
So you just drop your oldest
friend for no reason?

326
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:39,398
l mean, just tell me what l did.

327
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:43,604
l can't.

328
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:47,204
lt's not like one thing,
it's not like that.

329
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,373
Okay, great. So, just,
never speak to me again.

330
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,440
Real mature Angela.

331
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:55,109
No, l want to speak to you.
l never wanted--

332
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:56,950
No, forget it!

333
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:12,399
God, you and your hair.

334
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:18,966
Did Patty, like, hemorrhage
first time she saw it?

335
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,474
l n a sense.

336
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:26,140
Well, l have to say...

337
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:29,917
l hate it.

338
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:47,903
Hey! You know what l think? l think
that we should all go ice skating.

339
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,402
l mean it. All of us.
lce skating. Hot chocolate.

340
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:57,005
Sprained ankles. l'm in the mood.

341
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:59,482
So, there's this movie on
tonight, l really want to watch.

342
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:03,109
lt's about this girl. She gets
these obscene phone calls.

343
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:05,679
- lt's like her job.
- Really?

344
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,985
l told Neil that l'd shoot
pool with him tonight.

345
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:12,620
You're seeing your
brother twice in one week?

346
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:15,393
Well he broke up with her
again. l feel sorry for him.

347
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:18,800
And then somebody, like, tries to
kill her, like, over the phone.

348
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,930
Well, l guess it's just us
girls tonight, which--

349
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:25,306
So l'm grounded, just
because of last night?

350
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:28,039
l never said that you were
grounded. What l said--

351
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:30,377
So, Mom, l'm allowed to right?

352
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:35,216
Because, Rayanne invited me
to sleep over at her house tonight.

353
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,582
l am allowed to watch that, right?

354
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,414
That girl from the other day?
That rude girl?

355
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:41,857
She wasn't rude.

356
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:43,918
She finished my cheese.

357
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:45,986
l had this new brick of cheese.
She devoured it.

358
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:48,089
- l'm allowed to. Right?
- You know...

359
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,827
l have met this
Rayanne exactly once.

360
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,801
l do not know her. l do
not know her parents.

361
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,596
What? You never spent a
night at a friend's house?

362
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:58,108
My parents knew my friends.

363
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,736
- Mom, right?
- Yes, you may watch the movie.

364
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,803
Mom, you offered the cheese.

365
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:05,543
They knew all 900
of your friends personally?

366
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:07,915
Okay, we've all heard this before.

367
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,082
<i>My parents went</i>
<i>to the same hlgh school,,, </i>

368
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:13,647
<i>but they never</i>
<i>knew each other, then, </i>

369
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:17,087
Did you know that they had to change
the date of the prom because...

370
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:19,323
your mother was getting
her appendix out?

371
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:21,558
l never asked them
to change the date.

372
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:24,124
Meanwhile, l couldn't
get a girl to look at me.

373
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,998
You don't even
have to drive me...

374
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:32,907
because Rickie's cousin
said he would.

375
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:36,137
Rickie's cousin!
Why didn't you say so?

376
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:38,341
That eases my mind.

377
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:44,115
- Angela!
- Patty.

378
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:48,189
- Patty.
- You haven't met this Rickie.

379
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,957
- Stop calling him 'this Rickie. '
- l did parallel bars today.

380
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:55,328
Ms. Siten said
my dismount was perfect.

381
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,062
l find Rickie a little confusing.

382
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:02,865
Okay, so maybe he's bi. Who cares?
H is cousin can still drive.

383
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:07,173
What? He's what? Do you hear
these terms she's throwing around?

384
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:08,234
" Bi?"

385
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:10,577
- lt means bisexual.
- He's bisexual?

386
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:14,642
How can he be bi- anything? He's a
child, he's obviously very confused.

387
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:17,210
- No, he's not confused.
- He wears eyeliner.

388
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,881
He wears eyeliner?

389
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:21,858
- l thought you were on my side.
- l'm not on anyone's side.

390
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,053
- Graham. Grow up. Choose a side.
- ls her mother going to be there?

391
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:29,760
No. No, Rayanne lives by
her wits. l n an alley.

392
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:32,727
Yes, obviously.
l mean, she's a mother.

393
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:34,795
They live in the same place.

394
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:37,137
Obviously her mother
is going to be there.

395
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:39,803
Dad! Do you want to see
my headstand?

396
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:45,680
Fine, go. Spend the night at
some total stranger's house.

397
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,877
- l don't care.
- Like you really mean that.

398
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:50,285
No, go. And you, go shoot
pool with your brother...

399
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:52,346
or wherever the hell you're going.

400
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:55,626
Oh sure, so you can have it as
a grudge and never forgive me.

401
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,520
Dad, are you looking?

402
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,691
Dad, are you looking?

403
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:35,389
Hey Chase.

404
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:38,061
Get out of here, Krakow.

405
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:46,909
You're breaking like
1 4 different laws.

406
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,244
You looked better before.

407
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:52,476
- Like l'm devastated.
- Like l am.

408
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,420
Oh, look at me, l'm way cool.

409
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:00,185
l'm off with my way cool
friends to sniff floor wax.

410
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:03,819
- That's right, cover that zit.
- Want me to do yours?

411
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:05,589
That hurt.

412
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,923
Who you waiting for? Catalano?
Maybe you're not going anywhere.

413
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:13,368
- l mean, maybe you're just a...
- l'm going to Let's Bolt.

414
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:15,429
an exhibitionist.

415
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:18,732
Like they're really going
to let you into Let's Bolt.

416
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,970
Quit it!

417
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,813
You're not stupid, don't act
like it. lt's a stupid act.

418
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:33,254
Everybody is an act. l ncluding you.

419
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:40,962
So have a really amazing night,
okay? l'm going to throw up now.

420
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:43,023
Have a wonderful time.

421
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,332
My clueless neighbor.

422
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,444
You look so tough, this is
going to be one amazing night.

423
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:02,142
Where is Tino?

424
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:06,184
He'll be here, okay?
Haven't you ever waiting for anything?

425
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:08,315
Yeah, for my life to start.

426
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:13,229
l mean, Tino's coming. lt's way early.

427
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,495
Look around, nobody is here yet.

428
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:24,665
Look how thin yours are.

429
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,506
Tino, where are you?

430
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,536
But yours are really little.

431
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:32,547
But they're fat, they're like fatter.

432
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:35,642
Rickie loves cuter feet!

433
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,051
Me?

434
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:39,346
Let's trade shoes.

435
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,198
lf you were about to do it, okay...

436
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:53,396
what would you want the other
person to say, like, right before?

437
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:56,907
- 'This won't take long. '
- No, seriously.

438
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:02,437
- ' Don't l know you? '
- No, for real, like romantic.

439
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:10,211
'You're so beautiful,
it hurts to look at you. '

440
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,350
' lt hurts to look at you? '

441
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,050
How'd you think of that?

442
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:19,623
Where would it hurt?

443
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:21,688
l really like that.

444
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,630
Well l'm going to tell Jordan.

445
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,827
Rayanne!

446
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:31,197
Jordan! l'm going to tell Jordan.

447
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,242
Could you get us in?

448
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,311
Our friend's in there,
he's got my keys.

449
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:46,220
lt's an emergency.

450
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:48,916
So what,
they wouldn't let you in?

451
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:51,418
How old are you?

452
00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:59,927
You guys want to go somewhere?

453
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,199
- Do you?
- l don't know.

454
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:05,265
They are really young, isn't that
like kidnapping or something?

455
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:06,974
Don't you?

456
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:10,979
No, wait a minute, no.
Not three. J ust you, and you.

457
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:13,846
l'm not leaving Rickie here.

458
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:16,250
- Rickie don't mind.
- l don't mind.

459
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:20,947
You.

460
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,458
Come here, l want to
ask you something.

461
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,190
Ask me from there.

462
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:30,666
- l want to ask you over here.
- Come on, too young.

463
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:39,709
l don't take orders,
and l'm not stupid.

464
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:42,338
But you came when
l called, didn't you?

465
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:54,722
<i>Somethlng was actually happenlng, </i>
<i>but lt was too actual, </i>

466
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:58,818
- So where are we going?
- Come on, that's enough.

467
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:00,194
Come on!

468
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:04,365
Quit it! Let go of her!

469
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:08,461
- What's your problem?
- Come on man. Let's go.

470
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:13,404
Hey, l take care of myself! Okay?

471
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,510
Oh man, you're dead!

472
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:18,845
Forget it! Forget it!

473
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:21,584
Come on, forget it.

474
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,785
She won't remember this tomorrow,
she blacks out when she drinks.

475
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:28,551
- Hey!
- Let's just go.

476
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:30,854
l got to go.

477
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,962
You know these girls?

478
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:47,736
M r. Policeman. Perfect!
Because we need a ride.

479
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:52,306
Relax. l'm not arresting you.

480
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:55,776
Could you do the siren?
Please, please, please.

481
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,787
Oh my God, Angela!

482
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,550
Oh my God. Oh my--

483
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:07,387
Hey, l know that girl.

484
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:09,927
Oh my God!

485
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:12,896
Angela!

486
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:36,291
l knew what l was doing
back there, you know.

487
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,822
Okay.

488
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:45,695
l'll always watch out for you.

489
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,934
Okay. l'll always
be there for you, so...

490
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:51,999
don't worry, okay?

491
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:53,933
l won't.

492
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:02,242
And, you know, with
your hair like that?

493
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:05,778
lt hurts to look at you.

494
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,429
Come on.

495
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:24,866
<i>At Rayanne's house, </i>
<i>no one was home, </i>

496
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:43,483
Well, l never read the book.

497
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:49,361
Oh, the book is really--
See, it's this diary of her life.

498
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:53,667
See, these Nazis
were going to kill her, so...

499
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:56,832
whatever she'd been like
with her friends or her teachers...

500
00:39:56,908 --> 00:40:01,845
that was just over.
She was hiding.

501
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:05,781
But in this other way she wasn't.

502
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:11,117
She, like, stopped hiding.
She was free.

503
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:20,429
Don't do this again. You got that?

504
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,628
Could you please not come to my door?

505
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,218
Hey, you.

506
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:49,489
- Are you a friend of hers?
- Yeah.

507
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:51,425
Then act like it.

508
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:05,068
Watch out for her.

509
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:14,476
So, what happened?

510
00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:28,926
Right, you're not going to
tell me what happened. Chase?

511
00:41:31,435 --> 00:41:34,268
These guys started hitting on us.

512
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:37,330
What? Like, sexual harassment?

513
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,001
Like guys.

514
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,345
So they picked a theme, for yearbook.

515
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:54,223
- Who told you l liked Jordan Catalano?
- Nobody.

516
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:57,291
So do you?

517
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:07,300
Angela.

518
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,492
These aren't my shoes.

519
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:50,679
lt's the Year 2000. That's the
theme. J ust, what it'll be like.

520
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:55,644
Angela...

521
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:58,444
l got to go.

522
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:00,854
Okay.

523
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:10,265
That's a pathetic theme.

524
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,199
l know.

525
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:43,789
H i. What happened to
spending the night?

526
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:51,597
Well did you at least have fun?

527
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:54,968
Sort of.

528
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,371
How did you get home?

529
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:02,936
Rayanne's mom.

530
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:10,850
<i>My mother's adopted, For a whlle, </i>
<i>she was looklng for her real parents, </i>

531
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:16,890
<i>l guess that's what</i>
<i>everyone's looklng for, </i>

532
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:25,666
l'm really sorry.

533
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:39,677
About my hair and everything.

534
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:53,190
lt's not important, it'll grow out.

535
00:45:56,033 --> 00:46:00,970
lt actually looks not that bad...

536
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:05,869
in my humble opinion.

537
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:17,552
<i>l fell asleep rlght there, </i>
<i>l must've been really tlred, </i>

538
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,328

539
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:34,227

540
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:40,303
So how was your weekend?

541
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,737

00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:54,154
l got to go.

543
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,751
Rayanne, you are so full of it!

544
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:01,821
Oh, please!
Ask Rickie, it was wicked. lt was--

545
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,864
- Oh, hey girlfriend!
- Hey Angela!

546
00:47:04,935 --> 00:47:07,267
Ask Angela, she was there.
Angela, tell her--

547
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:09,329
We hung out and these guys
tried to pick them up.

548
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:12,034
- lt was totally wicked, am l right?
- And the cops came.

549
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:15,272
l am telling you,
we had a time. Didn't we?

550
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:17,837
Didn't we have a time?

551
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:20,907
We did. We had a time.
