00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:04,792
#

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,007
This is gonna be a great cover.

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:12,711
"Eye of the Fashion Storm"--
unique.

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,630
Hey, Betty, you look like
someone who was good at science.

5
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,636
Why do tornadoes always hit
shantytowns and trailer parks?

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,625
Does god just hate
poor people?

7
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,613
Amanda, I highly doubt that.

8
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,603
But I gotta say,
I kind of feel

9
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:27,945
like I'm in the middle
of a fashion storm right now.

10
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:29,935
No. You look like
a plus-size princess.

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,008
Dressing you up
in clothing from my hefty years

12
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:34,040
is like playing
with a big squishy doll.

13
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:37,224
It's so fun. Can we do it
again tomorrow, please?

14
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:38,229
No, but you know

15
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:41,023
is if the assistants got to go
on the editors' retreat, too.

16
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,436
I mean, everyone from Meade

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,763
out in the woods,
sharing ideas,

18
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:48,259
telling anecdotes--
it sounds great.

19
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:50,630
Great like herpes.
(cell phone ringing)

20
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:53,888
Oh. Will you hold my bagel?
- Sure.

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,792
Amanda!

22
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,782
(ring)

23
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,728
It's for your own good.

24
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,395
Hey, Phil. It's Betty.

25
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,822
Oh. Oh, that's too bad.

26
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:08,743
I guess I'll let Daniel know.

27
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:10,817
(beep)

28
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:12,890
Daniel, Phil just called.

29
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:14,879
There's a problem
at the printer,

30
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:16,360
so the fashion storm issue

31
00:01:16,402 --> 00:01:18,350
won't arrive at the loading dock
till noon,

32
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:20,296
which means we have to push
your final approval.

33
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,116
Oh, that sucks.

34
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:25,332
I wanted to ride
up to the retreat with Connor.

35
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:27,406
That was supposed
to be the fun car. Ugh.

36
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:30,283
Well, here's a thought,
just, you know, out of the blue.

37
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,230
What if <i>you</i>
go ahead with Connor

38
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:34,346
and let <i>me</i>
do the final approval

39
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:36,336
right before
the issue goes out?

40
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:39,213
I don't know. I mean...
If there's any problems,

41
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:41,456
That's the last chance
to catch them.

42
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,546
I don't think you really want
that kind of responsibility.

43
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,365
Uh. Yeah, I do.

44
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:49,285
Daniel, I've watched you do it,
like, a million times,

45
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,317
I totally know
what to look for,

46
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,475
and besides, while you guys
are at your retreat,

47
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:54,658
I really want to be helpful.

48
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,777
I guess you are kind of
O.C.D. about things, right?

49
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:58,723
I prefer the word "careful."

50
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:02,023
(sighs)

51
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:04,182
All right. You know what?

52
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,706
Go for it.

53
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,187
(gasps) Really?
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,710
Thank you!

55
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,080
Aah!
You won't be disappointed.

56
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,027
(elevator bell dings)

57
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:14,974
That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:17,005
I need your budget
right away. Excuse me.

59
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:18,571
Sorry, mate.
Hold the lift.

60
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:21,152
Wilhelmina. (chuckles)

61
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:22,294
Good morning, Connor.

62
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:24,961
So are you ready for our
little trek into the woods?

63
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:26,443
Ugh. Absolutely not.

64
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,940
I find these retreats
a colossal waste of time.

65
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,929
Oh. Well, that's
an important perspective

66
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:33,426
that we all need to hear.

67
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:36,514
So you're going,
and that's an order.

68
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,181
Uh, an order?

69
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:42,609
Connor, you do realize
you work for me?

70
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:44,683
Yes, my queen.

71
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,899
and heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

72
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,057
Still...

73
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:52,046
it's the price of leadership.

74
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,781
I'll see you there, boss.

75
00:02:57,082 --> 00:03:00,425
Okay, bridezilla,
let's discuss your wedding.

76
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:03,049
Mm, nah.
Let's talk about your hair.

77
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:05,716
Ooh.
- It's looking a little frizzy today.

78
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,255
(gasps) What? Oh, my god. Fix it.
- Sit.

79
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,175
I thought the red lip,
the updo was the right choice.

80
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:14,011
Wait. You're distracting me.
Marc, you proposed to Cliff,

81
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,507
Which I have to say, I thought
was a little weird considering

82
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:19,047
that you were so freaked out
about moving in with him,

83
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:21,840
and now you never want
to talk about it.

84
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:23,913
Ah. That--that is not true.

85
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:26,241
Well, every time
I bring up the wedding,

86
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:27,294
you change the subject.

87
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:29,669
Hey, what are we gonna do
while the editors are gone?

88
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,895
The usual--make the temps
kiss each other?

89
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:32,758
That is really fun.

90
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,832
Mm.
- Wait, no. You're doing it again.

91
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,567
Marc, are you punishing me

92
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,106
because I said I don't approve
of gay marriage?

93
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:41,053
I only meant that
for unattractive gays,

94
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,058
and Cliff is really growing on me.
(Wilhelmina) Marc.

95
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,005
Ooh. Gotta go.
(whispers) Thank God.

96
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:47,020
Marc!

97
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,036
Yes?

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,152
Aah! Gun!

99
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:52,395
(sighs)
It's for the retreat.

100
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,764
Connor's making me go.

101
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:56,246
He's enraging.

102
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:58,320
He's so self-confident,

103
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,859
he won't listen
to a word I say

104
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:03,822
and he's not afraid of me.
- I am. I'm afraid of you.

105
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:05,769
Oh, stop your cowering, Marc.

106
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,799
I don't even need a gun
with you.

107
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:11,439
Five good words, and I could
make you pee in your pants.

108
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:14,613
So Connor's really
getting under your skin, huh?

109
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:16,940
Is it that obvious?

110
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,987
Oh, it's no use, Marc.

111
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,681
He's unavailable.

112
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,161
He has a fiancée,

113
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:28,621
and I'm sure she's 20-something,
fabulous, European and thin.

114
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:31,245
Well,
you're all those things, too.

115
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:34,207
(stammers) Okay, so I will
make sure that your room

116
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,804
is on the opposite side
of the lodge from Connor's.

117
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,894
Good. Thank God
it's hunting season.

118
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,348
If I can't be
with the man I want,

119
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,380
at least I can kill something.

120
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:48,427
(forklift engine humming)

121
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,320
(forklift beeping)

122
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:53,675
(sniffs)

123
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,256
What the...

124
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:57,907
(sniffs)

125
00:04:57,991 --> 00:04:59,599
Hmm.

126
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:02,477
You know, the binding adhesive
has a really strong smell.

127
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,805
I'm afraid it's gonna overpower
the perfume samples.

128
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,598
Oh, jeez. That would
be a disaster, huh?

129
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,010
Here's what I'll do--

130
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:12,888
I'm gonna have my guys
rip all these pallets apart,

131
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,215
we'll take the magazines
back to the printer,

132
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,798
then we'll manufacture
an odorless adhesive

133
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,913
and we'll rebind them.

134
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:22,452
Now I know it's probably
gonna cost a few hundred grand,

135
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:25,372
but I want you to be happy
because you have final approval.

136
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,362
Fine. They can go out as is.

137
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:30,451
All right, boys, ship 'em.

138
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,371
Oh, hey. Could you
take a picture for me?

139
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:37,264
Fine. I'll do it myself.

140
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:40,777
"Eye of the Fashion Storm"--

141
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:43,105
First "Mode" issue
approved by me!

142
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,713
(camera shutter clicks)

143
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:46,618
(Daniel) Welcome, everyone,

144
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:48,564
to Meade's annual
editors' retreat.

145
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,188
Without further ado,
let me turn things over

146
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:53,177
to the newest member
of our team--

147
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:56,689
C.F.O. of Meade publications,
Connor Owens.

148
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,699
Thank you, everyone.
I'm thrilled to be joining,

149
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:06,084
but before the fun begins,
some sobering facts.

150
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,131
This is not a happy time
for the magazine industry.

151
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,163
Fewer readers
plus more competition

152
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:14,210
equals far, far less money.

153
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:16,241
If we can't come up
with innovative ways...

154
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,696
(buttons clicking) to cut costs
and increase revenues,

155
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:21,320
Meade may have to take
drastic steps.

156
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,283
Some of you may find
your magazines shut down.

157
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:28,092
The next few hours that were
scheduled as personal time

158
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:31,096
will now be a walk in the woods,
some time with your thoughts.

159
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,016
Bring me bold ideas.

160
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:37,190
I don't care how silly
or far out they may seem to you.

161
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,672
That crazy idea

162
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:41,972
may just be the one
that saves your magazine.

163
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:46,628
Uh, excuse me. May I offer
a crazy suggestion right now?

164
00:06:46,712 --> 00:06:48,151
Of course.

165
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:52,214
Take everyone's phones
and P.D.A.s.

166
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:54,711
What?

167
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:58,350
You really want people to focus?
Cut off all distractions.

168
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,932
Great idea.

169
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:03,047
Well, I don't think so.
- I do.

170
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,925
I mean, going off the grid--
I-I like the way that sounds.

171
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,804
All right, people.

172
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:11,851
Hand 'em over.
On the table right now.

173
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:13,882
Oh, Claire,
just so you know,

174
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,871
I'm going hunting
later on today.

175
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:19,172
Feel free to walk
front of my gun.

176
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:21,711
(Betty) Good news, everybody!

177
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:23,658
The final approval is done.

178
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,282
I was a little worried
about the smell,

179
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:29,329
but I think it's gonna be okay.
The issue has shipped! (high-pitched voice)

180
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:33,857
(normal voice) You e-mailed us all a picture.
- I tried to get your mustache

181
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:35,719
<i>(woman) We have breaking news</i>
<i>to report.</i>

182
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:38,131
<i>A tornado is currently</i>
<i>cutting a path of destruction</i>

183
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:40,121
<i>through central Kansas.</i>

184
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,744
<i>This is dramatic live footage</i>
<i>from the town of Tibsley.</i>

185
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,157
<i>Search and rescue teams</i>
<i>are on hold</i>

186
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,950
<i>until the tornado threat</i>
<i>diminishes...</i>

187
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,446
That kind of looks like the cover.
<i>...Deaths have been reported</i>

188
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:52,774
<i>and countless</i>
<i>have been left homeless.</i>

189
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:57,218
<i>We won't soon forget this</i>
<i>iconic image of destruction.</i>

190
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,560
<i>(wind howling)</i>

191
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:23,905
(panting) Phil! Phil.

192
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:26,445
We can't ship the magazine.
Huge emergency.

193
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:29,237
Oh, let me guess.
The pages are too glossy.

194
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:31,268
Well, yes, a little, but no.

195
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:34,570
There is a huge awful tornado
destroying Kansas. Look.

196
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:37,362
Tornado on the cover.
Tornado on the TV.

197
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:39,098
Get it?

198
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,680
This is gonna be
a huge P.R. disaster.

199
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:45,065
All right, you listen to me.
It was really cute before

200
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,139
when you came
in with the final approval

201
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:49,847
and then you took the picture
remember that? It was very cute.

202
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:53,571
But the truth is, you have no authority.
(gasps) What? What?

203
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:55,899
Look,
they put me in charge here.

204
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:59,369
I am the point person,
so stop shipping the issue.

205
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:02,121
That's an... order?

206
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:04,956
Listen, pointy, the only
two people with real authority

207
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,198
are Daniel Meade
and Wilhelmina Slater,

208
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:10,330
And if I don't hear from either
one of them, the issue ships.

209
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,462
Phil, I've been trying
to get ahold of them,

210
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,875
but I can't get through.

211
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,963
Look, I begged Daniel
for this responsibility.

212
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:19,343
Ugh.

213
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:22,730
And I promised him that
nothing would go wrong.

214
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,607
So please... help me.

215
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,147
All right, look.
The only thing I can do for you

216
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,603
is I can hold off
for four hours, all right?

217
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:30,814
Huh.

218
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:33,733
And if I don't hear
from either one of them by then,

219
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,764
The issue goes out. Sorry.

220
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,881
Okay! Thank you!
- Whatever!

221
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:42,451
<i>(woman singing Spanish)</i>

222
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,080
(singsong voice) Here it is!

223
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:50,931
(normal voice)
The permit from the city for my salon.

224
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:51,085
Oh.

225
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,793
Okay,
"commercial variances

226
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:56,544
are prohibited
in residential districts."

227
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,956
Yeah, but where's my permit?

228
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:03,019
<i>Mija,</i> I think this means
your permit is denied.

229
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:05,305
What?

230
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:09,029
Do you know how hard
I work for this?

231
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:11,271
You know whose fault this is?

232
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:13,980
Archie "the rat" Rodriguez.

233
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:17,662
Mr. Slick-ass City Councilman
comes over here,

234
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:20,243
and he's all like, "you need to
apply for your permit legally."

235
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,402
Look where it's gotten me.
He should be impeached.

236
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:24,475
Yeah.
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

237
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,064
Oh, man!

238
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:27,522
You should just
open the salon anyway.

239
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,696
No, she shouldn't.
It's breaking the law.

240
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:33,574
What are they gonna do,
put undercover hair police

241
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:36,156
across the street
to watch our house?

242
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,975
Honey, <i>papi's</i> right.

243
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,541
Bye.

244
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:42,884
We can't risk getting caught.

245
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,408
(both snap fingers)

246
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:46,313
<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Bold ideas. Bold ideas.</i>

247
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,302
<i>Isn't that</i>
<i>what we pay Connor for?</i>

248
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:51,137
<i>Okay, think, Daniel. Think.</i>
<i>I'm empty.</i>

249
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:53,127
<i>What if I never have</i>
<i>another idea?</i>

250
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,131
<i>I wonder what happened to</i>
<i>Jenny August from Andover.</i>

251
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:58,289
<i>She had pretty hair,</i>
<i>really good penmanship.</i>

252
00:10:58,373 --> 00:10:59,982
Aah!
- Whoa!

253
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,506
Oh!

254
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,029
(groans) Sorry.

255
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,569
Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, my ankle.

256
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:06,922
Ahh. You?

257
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,081
Yeah, fine.
Don't worry about me.

258
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,297
Do you think it's broken?
- Well, I'm not a doctor, but...

259
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:13,313
Really?

260
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:15,556
What? I could be a doctor.

261
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,502
Is it so obvious I'm not?

262
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:20,465
What are the odds I fall
out of a tree and hit a doctor?

263
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,539
Point taken.

264
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,078
Aren't you a little grown-up
to be climbing trees?

265
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,532
That's exactly
why I was doing it.

266
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:30,029
People are always saying
you're too old to do stuff.

267
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,441
You know what?

268
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,600
I agree with you.

269
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:36,463
He me up. Let me see
if I can bear weight.

270
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:37,478
Okay.

271
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,917
(grunts)
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

272
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,709
Ow! Okay.

273
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,883
All right. Ow!

274
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:51,697
(leaves rustle)

275
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,352
Come to mama.

276
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,955
You're welcome
to take the first shot.

277
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,679
Too easy. Aren't you
supposed to be thinking?

278
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:09,387
Oh, this is actually
where I get my best ideas.

279
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,969
There's something
so primal about it.

280
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,592
Very few things in life
make you feel this way.

281
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,005
I could think of a couple.

282
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:19,756
Yeah, me, too.

283
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,745
Well,
should we do this together?

284
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,453
(sighs)

285
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:26,527
(cell phone rings)
Dani.

286
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,235
Ugh. Hilda, I can't
really talk right now.

287
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,071
I'm trying
to get ahold of Daniel,

288
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,670
And I'm in the middle
of a work crisis.

289
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,033
Me, too. Listen, where'd you put the

290
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:36,811
hat you bought during your ugly hat phase?

291
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:39,223
My what? I didn't have
an ugly hat phase.

292
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:42,101
Oh, right.
Just your hat phase.

293
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:44,217
Okay, uh, why do you
need this right now?

294
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:47,644
Because I have come up with
a way to keep the salon open.

295
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,676
They denied my permit,

296
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:52,892
so i'm opening an underground
styling speakeasy.

297
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:55,093
All cash,
entrance in the back.

298
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:58,098
Okay, I don't really have time
to focus on this right now,

299
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:00,283
but it already sounds
like a bad idea.

300
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:01,737
What are you talking about?

301
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,022
People love a sense of danger.
- With their haircuts?

302
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,519
(gasps) I-I found them.
Thank you. Never mind. Bye.

303
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:08,467
(beep)

304
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:10,371
(sniffs)

305
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,402
I smell pluck.

306
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,246
Where are you going?

307
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:14,688
I can't just sit
here and do nothing.

308
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:16,803
Daniel is not answering
his cell phone,

309
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,793
and the lodge is
under strict instructions

310
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:21,628
not let any calls in or out
for the next few hours.

311
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:24,591
Yes, I know. Wilhelmina managed
to get a text off to me

312
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,811
before they took away
all their cell phones.

313
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:28,188
Oh. Well, I'm going up there.

314
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:31,869
So I raided the petty cash
drawer, and I'm taking a cab.

315
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,604
I've underestimated you.

316
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,398
I was thinking this was
all out poor, homely Betty

317
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,386
worrying about the poor,
homely people of Kansas,

318
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,799
But no, no, no, no.
This is about your career.

319
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:42,872
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

320
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,862
You think that if you get
the news to Daniel,

321
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:46,893
you'll come up smelling
like a <i>she-ro.</i>

322
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:49,813
Ugh. Marc, I don't care
what I smell like.

323
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:50,279
Mm, right.

324
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,802
I promised Daniel
nothing would go wrong,

325
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,807
so I don't really have a choice.
- Well, then I'm going with you.

326
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,786
You think I'm just gonna sit
here and watch you outshine me?

327
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:58,700
Fine. Whatever, Marc.

328
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:00,732
First of all,
I'm not taking a <i>cab</i>

329
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,552
all the way to Talmadge Hall.

330
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:05,514
All righty then, Marc.
How do you want to get there,

331
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,293
your wings?

332
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:09,323
Cliff's away till tomorrow.
We'll take his car.

333
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,762
Road trip?

334
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:12,285
Shotgun!

335
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,057
<i>(man) With new tornadoes</i>
<i>touching down all over Kansas,</i>

336
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:21,638
<i>it will be morning</i>
<i>until we know the full extent</i>

337
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:23,627
<i>of the damage</i>
<i>of this powerful system...</i>

338
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,420
Oh, god. Marc, can you
<i>please</i> pick up the pace?

339
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:27,902
Easy does-y, fuzzy wuzzy.

340
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:29,721
You're gonna give yourself
worry lines,

341
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:32,853
not that anyone could see them
under that canopy of bangs.

342
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,138
(giggles)
The issue ships in two hours,

343
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,702
and we are still 100 Miles
from the lodge.

344
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:38,523
And constantly

345
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:40,513
with the latest tornado
updates

346
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:42,580
is not gonna get us
there any faster.

347
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,433
Well, I'm sorry.

348
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,099
You know what? I'm right here.
- I can't just sit back...

349
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:48,342
You don't have to scream in my ear.
- and watch my magazine--

350
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:50,839
Ladies, <i>chillax.</i> I know
how we can pass the time.

351
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,870
Let's talk about Marc's wedding.
- No.

352
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:53,821
You're getting married?

353
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:55,875
I have a better idea.
Let's talk about Amanda's hair.

354
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,668
Wow. Still frizzy.
- What? I am not falling for that again.

355
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:01,588
Marc, I came on this trip
to talk about your wedding,

356
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:04,508
and that I what we're gonna do.
- Marc, I can't believe

357
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,793
if I was getting married,

358
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,730
I would never stop talking
about my wedding.

359
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:09,840
- And we'd all kill ourselves

360
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:11,266
so does that mean
there will be two best men?

361
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,168
I'm still the Maid of honor...

362
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,109
- That's offensive.

363
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,046
- 'cause I already
bought a fuchsia dress.

364
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,559
I didn't mean it to be.
I'm totally for gay marriage.

365
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,474
It's a really cute--

366
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:20,294
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

367
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,071
Let's just listen to music quietly.
<i>(woman) # amazing Grace #</i>

368
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,103
Oh, good. Christian radio, my favorite.
<i># how sweet #</i>

369
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,938
Watch out for that stuff.
It'll make you itch like crazy.

370
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:28,462
Oh, I'm immune.

371
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:29,901
(leaves rustling)

372
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:30,916
Shh.

373
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,863
Sounds like a big one.

374
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,613
8-pointer, maybe.

375
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:41,116
Ugh. False alarm again.

376
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:44,205
Would it be too much to ask
for something with antlers?

377
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,729
What is it?

378
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,860
It's, uh, Daniel
and some cripply wood nymph.

379
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:51,230
It's your form of rebellion.

380
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:56,309
That's my fiancée Molly.

381
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:57,789
That's her?

382
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,948
You sound surprised.

383
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,715
Well, it's just that he's...
wonderfully ordinary.

384
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:06,507
Why is she limping?

385
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,962
All right, it's not much further now.
- Okay.

386
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:10,952
So you don't work at Meade?

387
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,940
No, but I'm here
with someone who does.

388
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:14,506
Oh. Who?

389
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,368
(Connor) Molly.

390
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:21,150
Well, I see you two
finally met.

391
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:24,156
What have you done?
- I twisted my ankle. It's a long story.

392
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,956
Oh, let me.
Can you grab that, mate?

393
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:27,329
Yeah.

394
00:16:27,414 --> 00:16:30,291
Ooh. (laughs) Okay.

395
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:31,900
(laughs)

396
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:40,998
(Betty)
We only have an hour and 27--

397
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,115
Oh!--26 minutes left.

398
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:44,511
We are currently traveling

399
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,542
at the speed
of 50 Miles an hour,

400
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:49,759
and I think that if we push it
at least up to the speed limit,

401
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,594
we could give ourselves a cushion.
- Hey, Betty, you know what?

402
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,557
Now might be a really good time
for some stress eating. (sighs)

403
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,561
I'm sure Cliff is
a food stasher. (groans) Ugh.

404
00:16:58,604 --> 00:16:59,395
(squeals)

405
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:02,032
- What? What? What? What is it?

406
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:03,809
Nothing.
- You squealed.

407
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:05,798
No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

408
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,279
No, I didn't.
- Yes. You did.

409
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:09,057
No, I didn't.
- Betty?

410
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:09,898
You kinda did.

411
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,062
Okay, fine. Do you
really want to know?

412
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:14,674
I found a receipt from Tiffany's
for two wedding rings.

413
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:15,362
(Betty gasps) Oh!

414
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:16,388
Oh. Oh. (wheezing)

415
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:18,791
Cliff got you a ring!
Oh! Oh, that's so cute!

416
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,271
Oh, my god.
- That's so sweet.

417
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,261
Let me see it...
- No, Marc...

418
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:24,207
Marc! Marc, the wheel!

419
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,435
(screams, glass shatters)

420
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:30,543
What have I done?
- You crashed Cliff's car.

421
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,167
How's he ever gonna be able
to trust me again?

422
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,622
Um, you get it fixed.
It's just a car.

423
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:38,584
And it's an ugly car,
so you kind of did him a favor.

424
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,997
55 minutes? All right, thanks.

425
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,943
Guys, we can't wait
for the tow truck.

426
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,906
We'll never make it on time.
Amanda, help me push.

427
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,656
Uh, no. These stilettos
were not meant for pushing.

428
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:51,746
Although, maybe they were meant
for something else.

429
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:53,016
(Marc groans)

430
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,751
Unh!

431
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,613
Wait, wait.

432
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:59,956
Wait. I wasn't ready.
- If we get back to the city by 5:00,

433
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,987
We can all get completely drunk

434
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,230
And pretend like none of this
ever happened.

435
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:04,949
Okay, here's...

436
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:07,996
I saw a store back that way.
Marc, you stay here.

437
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:10,668
Amanda, come with me.
We'll ask someone for a ride.

438
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:11,763
- These stilettos are...

439
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:14,387
Okay, I'm going by myself.
(Amanda) Whatever.

440
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:17,307
Betty, could you grab me
some beef jerky?

441
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:19,720
Thanks!

442
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:23,021
(knocks rhythmically)

443
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:25,094
I got the horse right here.

444
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:28,606
His name is Paul Revere.

445
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:33,092
Are you a cop? Because you
gotta say if you are.

446
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:35,759
I'm just here
to get my roots done.

447
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:37,790
Julie, you look so good, right?
- Yeah.

448
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,345
I added some extra layers for fullness.
- I love it. It's perfect.

449
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,292
Oh, good. I'm so glad.

450
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,450
Now just remember
what it looks like.

451
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:49,004
Oh, and don't take that off
until you're around the corner.

452
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,628
Hey. Da-da-da.
You gotta go out the back.

453
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,930
And if anyone asks, you were
here looking for your cat.

454
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,792
Bye.
- Hello.

455
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,950
Hey! Oh, you waited too long.

456
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:00,812
I know. I know.

457
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:02,759
Okay.

00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,595
<i>Papi.</i>
Why aren't you at work?

459
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:07,753
They're bombing for roaches.

460
00:19:07,795 --> 00:19:09,700
So this is your solution?

461
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,180
Breaking the law?

462
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:14,101
Excuse me. (lowered voice) look,
I tried to do it legally.

463
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,328
I applied for a permit
and look what happened.

464
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,471
I got rejected.
So why take no for an answer?

I was wondering if you could

474
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,634
MAYBE give me a ride
to Talmadge Hall.

475
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:51,765
I could pay you, uh...

476
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:55,364
and 10, 15, 16, 17...

477

00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:45,734
I really appreciate that.

517
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,555
Betty, this is teriyaki.

518
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,840
No, I really mean it.
You went way above

519
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,871
and beyond the call of duty,
Betty.

520
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:55,722
Skywriting-- way to think on your feet.
- Well, you put me in charge,

521
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:58,599
and I didn't
want to disappoint you,

522
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:01,223
So I used your credit card
number and voilà!

523
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,747
Oh, just curious.

524
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,625
Uh, how much does
skywriting cost anyway?

525
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:09,391
Um, let's just say a lot less
than a massive P.R. nightmare.

526
00:22:09,476 --> 00:22:12,396
Not that our problems even
compare to the tornado victims'.

527
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:15,274
Right. I'm gonna call Phil down
at the loading dock right now.

528
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,094
Great.
(beep)

529
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,829
(sighs)

530
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:21,621
Well, you'll be happy to know
this retreat's gonna end early

531
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,569
so we can deal
with this whole thing.

532
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:26,573
We're gonna have to figure out
a whole new cover,

533
00:22:26,616 --> 00:22:29,536
eat the cost of the old one.
Do we?

534
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,371
Before you make that call,
why don't we have a little chat?

535
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:39,236
<i>(man singing Spanish)</i>

536
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,856
Okay, one plate of "Betty saved
the magazine" pancakes.

537
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:45,464
Mmm!
- Mmm!

538
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:46,235
What's in them?

539
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:48,468
Actually, just regular
pancakes with whipped cream.

540
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:51,473
You didn't give me a lot of time.
- Mm.

541
00:22:51,515 --> 00:22:54,436
You know, using a skywriter to
send a message--let me tell you,

542
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,356
that's the stuff people remember you for.
- I don't know.

543
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,148
I'm just glad I got a chance
to show them

544
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:02,603
I can handle a little responsibility.
(Justin) Aunt Betty!

545
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:02,995
Hmm?

546
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:06,369
Talk about being
ripped from the headlines.

547
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:08,909
"Eye of the Fashion Storm"?

548
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:10,814
Where did you get that?
- The newsstands.

549
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:12,633
Oh, no.

550
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:16,992
<i>Scandal--</i>
<i>bad timing or bad taste?</i>

551
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:18,981
<i>The "Mode"</i>
<i>fashion storm cover</i>

552
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,971

555
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,742

556
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:30,323
<i>when did they know it</i>

557

00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,484
<i>does not go away.</i>

563
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,970
Hey. Any news?
Did you find out what happened?

564
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:50,933
No, I've just been dealing
with this P.R. crisis.

565
00:23:50,976 --> 00:23:53,811
The press is not
leaving us alone. Oh, no.

566
00:23:55,758 --> 00:24:00,836
Uh, don't worry I'm gonna deal
with this. Hey, guys.

567
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:03,263
Uh, as I mentioned, we're having
a press conference tomorrow.

568
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:04,094
I'm sorry. We don't want you,

569
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,311
we want to talk to her,
our favorite sweaty Modie.

570
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:09,596
Now is it true that
you're the one responsible

571
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,288
for the "Mode" cover fiasco?

572
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:12,813
What? No.

573
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:15,140
Oh, you're saying
this <i>isn't</i> a picture of you

574
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:18,821
giving final approval for the issue?
- Well, yes, that's me, but--

575
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:19,280
Guilty.

576
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,784
Guys, guys. Betty is
not responsible for this.

577
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:22,535
Its name is Betty.

578
00:24:22,536 --> 00:24:24,831
In fact, she's the one who
tried to stop this from happening.

579
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,354
Oh, she did?

580
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,978
Because about the time
your issue was being shipped,

581
00:24:29,064 --> 00:24:32,152
we have footage of her
doing this...

582
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,057
buying questionable
meat products

583
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:37,020
and stealing toys from children.
- No, you got it all wrong.

584
00:24:37,062 --> 00:24:39,269
See, that is how I got the idea
to call a skywriter.

585
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,685
Skywriter?

586
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,141
Yeah, it was
actually very clever.

587
00:24:42,225 --> 00:24:45,103
Betty hired a skywriter to try--
- This story is getting more

588
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:47,346
any last comments,
Tornado Girl?

589
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,827
(camera shutters clicking)

590
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:51,916
<i>Um...</i>

591
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:53,948
I have to tell the truth.

592
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:57,841
Oh, don't be a boob, Daniel.
Have you seen these numbers?

593
00:24:57,926 --> 00:24:59,831
Connor asked us
to increase our revenues,

594
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:03,428
and this is the highest selling
issue of "Mode" in history.

595
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,374
But Betty's getting blamed
for it.

596
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:08,083
I never would have
agreed to this

597
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:09,986
if I knew
that was gonna happen.

598
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:11,088
Oh, tra-la-la-la-la.

599
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:14,092
So what if some frumpy assistant
gets her feelings hurt today?

600
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:16,123
She's used to it.

601
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:18,409
Ultimately, it may help us
avoid layoffs tomorrow.

602
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:20,695
Trust me.
It'll all blow over.

603
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:23,064
What if it doesn't?

604
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,604
You and I run this company.
We cannot get our hands dirty.

605
00:25:25,645 --> 00:25:29,285
Taking the fall is what
the little people are for.

606
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:38,680
(cell phone rings)

607
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:40,881
Oh.
(ring)

608
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:42,912
(beep)
Please stop harassing me.

609
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:46,975
I am not the bad guy. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

610
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,038
That is disgusting and not even
physically possible.

611
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,985
(sighs) somebody put
my cell phone number

612
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,100
on enemiesoftheheartland.com

613
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:57,978
(scoffs)
I really don't understand

614
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:00,009
how this ended up happening,

615
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:02,887
because I did everything to stop
that issue from going out,

616
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:05,766
and now I'm getting blamed
for it.

617
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,924
You know,
I hate that saying--

618
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:09,870
"no good deed
goes unpunished"--

619
00:26:09,955 --> 00:26:12,367
But it really seems
to apply here.

620
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,414
You know what? That's just like
my pert getting denied.

621
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,403
I went through
all the right channels,

622
00:26:17,446 --> 00:26:20,408
and still, I get-- (gasps) fudge!
- Fudge!

623
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:22,863
(mouth full) I just feel
so helpless, you know?

624
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:26,291
It's like everything is
just spinning out of control,

625
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:29,973
you know gaining momentum,
like a...

626
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:31,115
tornado?

627
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,839
Justin.

628
00:26:34,882 --> 00:26:37,082
(slams hand on table)
You, too?

629
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:39,113
It's not personal,
Aunt Betty.

630
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,060
There just hasn't been
a T-shirt-worthy scandal

631
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:43,642
since Winona had her troubles.

632
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:45,123
Okay, that's enough.

633
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:49,566
My girls may be a lot of things,
but helpless isn't one of them.

634
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:53,502
So the question is,
what are you gonna do now?

635
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,750
(Ignacio) Hmm?

636
00:26:58,793 --> 00:27:00,485
<i>(wind howls)</i>

637
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:07,051
Thank you so much
for coming with me.

638
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,998
I don't think
it's gonna get physical,

639
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:10,945
but I might need someone here
to restrain me.

640
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:13,441
Please. I'm happy to be
anywhere I'm anonymous.

641
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:15,642
Hey, aren't you Tornado Girl?

642
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,424
No. I just look like her.

643
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,160
We're here to see
Councilman Rodriguez.

644
00:27:22,161 --> 00:27:24,106
- Well, I'm afraid the councilman
is unavailable.

645
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:26,877
You want to make an appointment
to come back next week?

646
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:27,364
Next week?

647
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:30,538
Mm. I got a problem right now.
- Forget it.

648
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:31,936
Hilda,
she said "unavailable."

649
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,474
That's what I say when
Daniel's in the bathroom.

650
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,591
He must be here.
(door opens)

651
00:27:36,675 --> 00:27:37,944
Oh! Look.

652
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,442
Hilda. Hey,
how'd that permit work out?

653
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,066
Oh, you didn't hear?

654
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:45,140
I got rejected.

655
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:48,271
Oh, wow. Uh, I'm sorry.

656
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:49,795
You're sorry. You're sorry?

657
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:52,757
You told me to do things
aboveboard, and what happens?

658
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,634
I get screwed.
(whispers) Take it down a notch.

659
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,158
(clears throat) All right.

660
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,290
Councilman, I am
one your constituents,

661
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,237
and I got a problem

662
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:04,226
how you gonna fix it?

663
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:06,934
Uh, they rejected your permit.
There's nothing I can do.

664
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,881
The law is the law.

665
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:11,250
The law is the law?

666
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:13,240
That's the best you got?

667
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:16,202
It seems like you could do
a little bit better

668
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,319
when you are destroying
someone's dreams.

669
00:28:21,027 --> 00:28:23,101
This is one of
the only good things

670
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:26,021
that has happened to my sister
in a long time.

671
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,306
Lots of people have
home businesses.

672
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,184
There's got to be something
you could do..

673
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:33,088
isn't that your job?
- Betty.

674
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,611
I'm coming.

675
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:42,483
Oh! Oh! Aah!

676
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:44,218
(screams and gasps)

677
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,784
Oh.
- Marc!

678
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:47,942
(whispers) Shh! Silence.
(presses button)

679
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:51,032
(flatly) Powerful forces are
arrayed against you.

680
00:28:51,116 --> 00:28:53,909
What?
What are you talking about?

681
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:57,676
Things are not what they seem.
- Okay, not in the mood.

682
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:01,612
Not all birds
fly south in winter.

683
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:04,236
I don't understand you.
Stop being cryptic.

684
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,225
(normal voice)
Oh. For god sake, Betty,

685
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:09,822
I'm not gonna jeopardize my job
by spelling it out to you.

686
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:11,853
If you want to know
what really happened

687
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:13,800
with the issues going out,

688
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:16,932
then go talk to Phil
in the loading dock.

689
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:19,852
(whispers) He knows.

690
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,211
I need to know
why the issue wasn't stopped

691
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:26,073
after Daniel called you.

692
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:28,581
Yeah, well, too bad,
'cause I ain't talkin'.

693
00:29:28,582 --> 00:29:29,712
Well, I ain't leavin'.

694
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:35,214
You can't get away from me.
- You're like a gnat with glasses.

695
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:37,542
Well, I could do this all day,

696
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:39,530
'cause if I'm not getting
hate mail

697
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:41,858
from the daughters of Kansas,
then it's a vacation.

698
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:45,837
Yeah. You got a raw deal.

699
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:48,249
You're a pain in my ass,

700
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,788
but you don't deserve this.

701
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,132
All right, come here.
(clears throat)

702
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:56,586
Listen,
you didn't hear this from me,

703
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,575
but I got a call, all right.

704
00:29:58,618 --> 00:30:00,522
It wasn't telling me
to <i>hold</i> the issue.

705
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:03,315
It was telling me to ship it.

706
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,065
What? Well,
who told you to do that?

707
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:09,874
(sighs)

708
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:13,895
Uh, Betty?

709
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,746
You lied to my face, Daniel.

710
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:19,778
You have to believe me.

711
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,692
You were never supposed
to get blamed for this.

712
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:23,290
But I did.

713
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:25,702
And I defended you.
You saw me.

714
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:28,834
Yeah, but you knew the truth,
and you said nothing.

715
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,797
Look, things
are not as simple

716
00:30:31,838 --> 00:30:34,082
as you and I wish they were.

717
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,875
This company is in a lot
of trouble. We need money.

718
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:39,880
I only agreed to it because
it was a business decision.

719
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,800
It was a way to save Jobs.
And ruin my reputation.

720
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:45,085
Look, I never intended
for that to happen.

721
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:47,709
This is gonna blow over.
- Blow over?

722
00:30:47,751 --> 00:30:50,883
(voice breaking)
I'm not Daniel Meade.

723
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,041
I'm an assistant,

724
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,284
and I don't want
to be an assistant

725
00:30:55,326 --> 00:30:58,035
for the rest of my life.

726
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:00,913
The only thing I have going
for me is my reputation,

727
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:03,706
and now I don't have that.

728
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,134
I'm Tornado Girl.

729
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,333
Chocolate chip.

730
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:28,634
Oh, <i>papi,</i> thank you.

731
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,624
(doorbell rings)

732
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,755
I'll get it.

733
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:37,395
Evening.
I'm Councilman Rodriguez.

734
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,764
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No, sir.

735
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:43,138
Mr. Councilman, it is an honor
to have you in our home. Please.

736
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:43,658
Thank you.

737
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,382
He's been here before, <i>papi.</i>
I gave him a haircut, remember?

738
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:50,090
So what are you gonna do now,
evict us?

739
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,122
I kind of felt bad
about earlier today,

740
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:55,126
and I don't want to be the guy
who destroyed your dreams,

741
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:57,709
so I've, uh, done
a little bit of research.

742
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,994
What is that?

743
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:01,306
Your loophole.

744
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,268
See, if 30% of your profits
come from products you sell,

745
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,569
then we can get you
that permit, for a boutique.

746
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:10,024
A boutique?
So wait, wait, wait.

747
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:13,621
If I sell things, I can cut hair.
- That's right.

748
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:16,118
So what am I gonna sell?
Are you kidding?

749
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:18,699
First you can get rid
of this hideous lamp,

750
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:21,620
and then get rid of half a dozen
of those saints

751
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:24,624
and while you're at it,
get rid of Betty's hats.

752
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,825
Well, actually,
I was thinking you could...

753
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:29,660
sell some candles. See?

754
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:31,099
Just a thought.

755
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:33,469
<i>Muchísmo gracias,</i>
Councilman Rodriguez.

756
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:37,151
Oh, please, call me Archie.
- Okay, Archie.

757
00:32:37,193 --> 00:32:39,681
Hey, let me get my camera
before you go.

758
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:40,409
<i>Papi.</i>

759
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:42,780
Wow. Well, thank you.

760
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:44,642
I... I owe you.

761
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:45,742
Well...

762
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:46,800
(sniffs)

763
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:49,339
Well, good luck.

764
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:50,736
Thanks.

765
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:53,824
Hey, uh, if you ever need
a haircut or--or a candle...

766
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,687
(chuckles) Just say the word.

767
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:57,676
Since I've sort of
done you a favor,

768
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,708
I don't think
it would be ethical

769
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,585
to, uh,
get a free haircut, so...

770
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:04,997
Yeah. Oh, I was gonna charge you,
Councilman. (chuckles)

771
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:06,902
(laughs)

772
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:09,299
Well, then I'll definitely
be stopping by.

773
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,568
Okay.

774
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:11,896
All right, good night.

775
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,885
Night.

776
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:15,366
(door closes)

777
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,778
(Ignacio)
Okay, everybody say <i>"queso."</i>

778
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,513
Hey.
<i>- Papi.</i>

779
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:21,037
Where'd he go?

780
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:30,982
(Betty clears throat)

781
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:32,633
I spoke to Phil

782
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:35,172
and Daniel.

783
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:37,119
I know what happened.

784
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:41,774
I officially have no idea
what you're talking about...

785
00:33:41,858 --> 00:33:43,509
Hmm.

786
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:45,159
But I'm sorry.

787
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:48,715
We're very different people.

788
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,703
That said,
we're in the same position,

789
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:53,750
and sometimes we have he to
look out for each other,

790
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:54,766
so...

791
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,221
Well, thank you.

792
00:33:57,305 --> 00:34:00,098
Clearly Cliff has had
a good influence on you.

793
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:02,849
He's a very lucky man.

794
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:05,769
(scoffs) He's... yeah.

795
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:08,351
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
He's really, really lucky.

796
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:10,594
Uh, what was that?

797
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:12,795
Nothing.
Uh, everything's great.

798
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,196
Everything is... perfect.

799
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:20,158
Uh, well, this may be
none of my business,

800
00:34:20,243 --> 00:34:23,036
but it doesn't <i>seem</i>
like everything's okay.

801
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,559
You're right.

802
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:27,649
It's none of your business.

803
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,897
What are you
still looking at me for?

804
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:36,917
All right, fine.

805
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:39,541
I-I...

806
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,842
I cheated on Cliff
at your party,

807
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:45,255
and that's why I asked him
to marry me,

808
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,751
because I felt so guilty.

809
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:50,629
And now I feel like
such a terrible person

810
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,322
because of it,

811
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:54,692
and i'm sure
that's what you feel, too.

812
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:58,120
Marc,
I know you're a good person.

813
00:35:00,955 --> 00:35:03,241
But I also know
that it really hurts

814
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:07,176
when someone you trust
lies to you.

815
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:10,223
Look, if you love him,

816
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:12,677
he deserves
to know the truth.

817
00:35:15,428 --> 00:35:16,868
(Wilhelmina) Rest assured,

818
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,746
Meade publications is doing
everything it possibly can

819
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:22,200
to rectify
this terrible situation.

820
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:24,697
By tomorrow--
or the latest, next week--

821
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:27,193
every issue will
be off the newsstands.

822
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:30,622
And how are you dealing
with Tornado Girl? (laughter)

823
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:34,473
Fired, reprimanded, banished
to a basement somewhere?

824
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:36,673
Now, now. (chuckles)

825
00:35:36,758 --> 00:35:40,017
That is an internal issue
that we are handling privately.

826
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:42,302
We're all human,
and we all make mistakes.

827
00:35:42,344 --> 00:35:44,164
So thank you--

828
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:46,745
Wilhelmina's right. (sighs)
We all do make mistakes,

829
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,174
especially those of us
in charge.

830
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:52,163
I was the one
who made the decision

831
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:55,167
to let the magazine run
in the newsstands.

832
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:58,892
It was a very cynical decision,
and I regret it...

833
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:01,557
but not nearly as much
as I regret

834
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,451
watching my assistant,
Betty Suarez, take the blame.

835
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:07,567
It was my fault, mine alone.

836
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:11,334
Well, I-I, for one,
am shocked, Daniel,

837
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,492
uh, personally shocked
and embarrassed

838
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:17,343
that our company is involved
in something like this...

839
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:19,417
which is why
Meade publications

840
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:22,337
will donate all profits
from the sale of this issue

841
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:26,018
to a relief fund to benefit
the victims of these tornadoes.

842
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:28,346
Uh, that's...
That's all I have to say.

843
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:30,716
(clears throat)
Thank you, everyone.

844
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:34,313
(reporters talking at once)

845
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,134
(Suzuki) Did we hear correctly?

846
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:38,503
All proceeds from the sale
of this month's magazine...

847
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:39,011
(mouths words)

848
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:42,735
will be going to tornado victims?
(mouths words)

849
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:50,522
So what did you want
to tell me

850
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:53,062
that was so important
I had to rush over?

851
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:58,986
Well, how do I say this?
- Uh...

852
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,049
I crashed your car.

853
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,207
Oh.

854
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,492
(laughs) God.

855
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:10,539
I thought it was
something much worse.

856
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,121
(laughs) Whew.

857
00:37:13,206 --> 00:37:14,898
(chuckles)

858
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,622
Actually,
there is something else.

859
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:23,024
You better sit down.

860
00:37:43,507 --> 00:37:44,946
Hey, Tornado Boy.

861
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:49,178
Hey, Molly.

862
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:51,802
So is that what
you're gonna call me now?

863
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:54,341
What? It's cool,
like a superhero name.

864
00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:55,737
(laughs)

865
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,462
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm impressed.

866
00:37:59,546 --> 00:38:02,001
It's not very often
you get to see a big shot

867
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:04,709
throw himself under a bus
for an assistant.

868
00:38:04,794 --> 00:38:08,095
Well, ahem. Thanks.

869
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:10,212
It looks like
your ankle's okay.

870
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:12,454
I have a splint.

871
00:38:12,497 --> 00:38:15,417
Is it weird that I'm a little
excited about having a splint?

872
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,135
I've never had one before.
You wanna sign it?

873
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:18,421
Sure.

874
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:21,087
I'm a little hopped up
on painkillers right now.

875
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,219
(laughs) Oh, well, please.
You're welcome to sit down, if you'd like.

876
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:27,181
Connor should be around here somewhere.
- Actually,

877
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:30,017
it's our anniversary.
He's taking us to Del Posto.

878
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:34,164
Oh, well, make sure
you don't drink wine.

879
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:36,196
The painkillers.

880
00:38:36,238 --> 00:38:39,243
(gasps) Right.

881
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:45,549
(sighs)

882
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:54,055
I am so proud of you both.
Mm.

883
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:56,629
You fought for yourselves,
and you won.

884
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,314
Yeah, I taped

885
00:38:57,398 --> 00:39:00,742
and I just can't stop watching it.
- Is there a bottle of champagne...

886
00:39:00,826 --> 00:39:01,145
uh-oh.

887
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:03,746
If it's not made in
France, it's sparkling wine,

888
00:39:03,831 --> 00:39:05,778
and that bottle's
from New Jersey.

889
00:39:05,863 --> 00:39:07,216
(chuckles)

890
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:08,571
(sighs)

891
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:11,449
What's the matter, baby?
I thought you were happy.

892
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:13,141
Everything's back to normal.

893
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,299
It is, and normal is good.
Believe me.

894
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:17,373
If I never hear the word
"tornado" again,

895
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:19,405
I'll be just fine.
(laughs)

896
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:21,225
It's just...

897
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,214
there was a moment there
where I thought

898
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:26,091
I had actually accomplished
something really great,

899
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:28,503
you know,
something that would...

900
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:31,213
make normal different...

901
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:33,582
more, I guess.
I don't know.

902
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:38,449
<i>Mija,</i> you keep putting one foot
in front of the other,

903
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:41,284
open your eyes
to the opportunities,

904
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:45,093
you're gonna get to where
you wanna go, guaranteed.

905
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:47,421
I love you.

906
00:39:47,505 --> 00:39:50,552
I love you, too. (laughs)

907
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,108
(the panics)
# where has my light gone? #

908
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:56,689
# where has my fit gone? #

909
00:39:56,773 --> 00:40:01,259
# what keeps us burning
when t fire is long gone? #

910
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:05,788
# when I can't relate
to that voice without a face #

911
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,919
# should I be afraid,
or is it just... #

912
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:12,305
Connor, now that Daniel has go
and given everything away,

913
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,786
we need to strategize.

914
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,791
I'm afraid it's gonna be a late night.
- Uh...

915
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,795
Well, that's not gonna be
a problem for you, is it?

916
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,107
No.

917
00:40:21,193 --> 00:40:24,197
I had dinner plans,
but I can reschedule.

918
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,466
Good.

919
00:40:25,552 --> 00:40:29,063
We're very lucky
to have you on board.

920
00:40:29,149 --> 00:40:31,095
# my answer's always this #

921
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:32,958
# I said don't fight it #

922
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,438
# don't fight it #

923
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:35,920
# don't fight it #

924
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:38,374
# if you don't know what it is #

925
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:40,406
# if you don't know
what it is #

926
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:41,844
(speaks inaudibly)

927
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,706
# just don't fight it #

928
00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:45,230
# don't fight it #

929
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:46,712
# don't fight it #

930
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:48,954
# if you don't know what it is #

931
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:51,282
# if you don't know
what it is #

932
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,806
Yeah, well, it's work.

933
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,286
It's always work.

934
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:55,302
Molly.

935
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:56,783
I gotta go.

936
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:58,308
Don't run. Please.

937
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:00,254
# if you don't know what it is #

938
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:03,217
# if you don't know
what it is #

939
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:04,866
# just dot n fight it #

940
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:06,390
# don't fight it #

941
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:07,872
# don't fight it #

942
00:41:07,956 --> 00:41:09,861
