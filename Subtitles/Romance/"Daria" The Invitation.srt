1
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:07,631
Stop following me, Daria. You're following me.

2
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,971
We go to the same school.

3
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:12,266
Hey, Quinn, can I carry your books?

4
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,393
Hey, Quinn, can I carry your... pencil?

5
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:18,477
Hey, Quinn, can I carry your, uh, um... got anything else?

6
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,306
A hair scrunchie?

7
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,113
Great!

8
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:25,408
Careful. Don't hurt yourself with that scrunchie.

9
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:27,024
Is that your sister?

10
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,427
Don't pry, Joey.

11
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:29,575
I'm Jamie.

12
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,299
Whatever.

13
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,973
Perspective is hard.

14
00:01:41,778 --> 00:01:46,245
Good work, Daria. Your cube is bursting out of the picture plane.

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,712
You've really created the illusion of depth.

16
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:51,094
I'm thinking of going into politics.

17
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:56,195
Ms. Defoe? I need a new pencil. I used up the eraser.

18
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,619
Here, Brittany, take another pencil and a fresh piece of paper,

19
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,851
and try again.

20
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:07,168
If I don't figure this perspective thing out, I'll have to take remedial art.

21
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:10,953
I heard they make all the lefties become righties.

22
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:13,589
But... you are a righty.

23
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,437
Daria, you're smart. Show me how to do this.

24
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:26,092
Well... okay. You know when things seem very far away?

25
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:27,410
Like the weekend?

26
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:32,598
Distant things, like mountains and buildings.

27
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:36,086
But, Daria... we're in a building.

28
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,873
Yes, but...

29
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:42,594
Make believe you're at the mall.

30
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,293
You're standing in front of J.J. Jeeters.

31
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:48,206
Oh, like I would shop there.

32
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,822
You don't have to go in.

33
00:02:51,857 --> 00:02:54,927
You're looking at Cashman's Department Store...

34
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:56,117
Now you're talking.

35
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:58,924
...way down at the other end.

36
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,709
Everything seems to be pointing to the entrance and saying,

37
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:10,110
"Come shop, come shop. " "One-day sale. "

38
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:14,065
I get it! That's really realistic, Daria.

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,447
That's one-point perspective.

40
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:21,041
All the lines are pointing to one spot on the horizon.

41
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,081
I get it! Except...

42
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:24,228
Yes?

43
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:27,206
Is Cashman's really having a one-day sale?

44
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:31,247
Yo, Mack Daddy. You coming to Brittany's party?

45
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:35,032
Don't call me that, okay? What's this party for, anyway?

46
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:35,923
Um...

47
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,646
Stop if it starts to hurt.

48
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:44,218
Really. Um, her birthday was last month...

49
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:46,216
I helped her exchange all her presents.

50
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:47,108
Even yours?

51
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:52,424
Yeah. Then she had a saleslady explain the difference between perfume and cologne.

52
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:55,614
Interesting stuff, bro. Now I remember!

53
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:59,102
The party's to celebrate her parents being out of town.

54
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,654
Hey, Joey, Jeffy, Jeremy.

55
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:03,482
I'm Jamie.

56
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:06,247
Whatever. You going to Brittany's party?

57
00:04:06,282 --> 00:04:07,948
Uh, if we're invited.

58
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:11,605
You're on the team, dudes. When a cheerleader has a party,

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,284
all the football players are automatically invited.

60
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,623
It's on page six of the play book.

61
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:19,643
Really? Hey, Quinn, what about you?

62
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:20,621
Can I?

63
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:21,259
Sure!

64
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:28,956
Sure.

65
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:29,541
Who? Me?

66
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:30,142
Which one?

67
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:30,708
Him or me?

68
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:34,425
Everyone! You can't expect me to choose a boyfriend right away.

69
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,571
That would be like eating the first pancake off the stove.

70
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:39,954
You have to feed one to the dog.

71
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:47,227
Ugh! I hate it when the trays are wet.

72
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:50,542
"That which does not kill us makes us stronger. "

73
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:55,348
Is that from a song? Hey, thanks for helping me out in art.

74
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:56,624
No problem.

75
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:59,302
Maybe I could help you out in something.

76
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:05,256
Well, you could show me how to twirl hair around my little finger and look vacant.

77
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,701
I don't know if that's something you can teach.

78
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:13,507
Ugh! I hate it when the pudding has skin.

79
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:17,036
I know what you mean... and that scares me.

80
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:21,801
Hey, even though I'm much more popular, we have some things in common.

81
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:22,604
Breathing?

82
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,964
I mean, you're not popular,

83
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:30,152
but you're not so unpopular that you couldn't come to my party Saturday night.

84
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:32,279
Is that an invitation?

85
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:34,831
Yes! Just this once, though.

86
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:38,317
Gee, Brittany. I'm overcome with emotion.

87
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:42,784
You need a napkin? Anyway, I promised the other cheerleaders

88
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:45,720
that I wouldn't invite any more really attractive girls.

89
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:48,228
Now I'm especially flattered.

90
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:49,674
Don't mention it.

91
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:54,570
These are really good. I didn't know you studied life drawing.

92
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,398
Yeah, last summer.

93
00:05:56,433 --> 00:06:00,566
You're really bursting out of the picture plane here.

94
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:04,180
Oh, yeah. That particular model was quite bursty.

95
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:06,349
I think she had her bursts done.

96
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:10,432
Speaking of which... Brittany invited me to her party.

97
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:12,685
No kidding? Are you going?

98
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,472
Sure. And after that, I think I'll swallow glass.

99
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:18,938
Why? Do you want to go?

100
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:23,871
Oh, no, I'd much rather stay home and listen to my brother practice the opening to "Come as You Are. "

101
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,764
I bet I could get some great sketches there...

102
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:29,570
Well, I'm sure there'll be plenty of people posing.

103
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:32,633
If you want to go, just make believe you're me.

104
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:36,546
When you're popular, all unpopular people look alike anyway.

105
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,574
"Hi, I'm Daria. Go to hell. "

106
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,459
It won't work.

107
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,542
My face is too expressive.

108
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:54,240
Sheer, semi-sheer, or opaque? Textured!

109
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,283
Isn't one of you enough?

110
00:06:56,318 --> 00:06:58,451
Go away, I'm concentrating.

111
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,322
I'm invited to a party Saturday night

112
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:02,109
and I have to choose the perfect outfit.

113
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:05,638
Countdown: only 72 more hours to go.

114
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:08,786
Might this party be at Brittany's house?

115
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:13,019
Yes, and might you go away now? Hey...

116
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:15,593
how do you know about it?

117
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:20,909
I'm invited, too... but I haven't decided if I'll go.

118
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:23,419
You can't go! You'll ruin everything!

119
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:27,970
You know, I really should broaden my social horizons.

120
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:33,755
Mom! Dad! Daria is ruining my life again!

121
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:44,841
Tell Daria she can't go to Brittany's party.

122
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:47,224
My popularity is at stake.

123
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,052
Now, don't begrudge your sister a chance to expand her circle of friends.

124
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:52,838
Maybe now she'll have two.

125
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,496
Touché, Quinn.

126
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:57,304
And don't think you're confusing me with that French.

127
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:02,238
You should ground her because... her room is a mess!

128
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:06,066
If I go down for that one, I'm taking you with me.

129
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:08,022
Wait, here's something worse.

130
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:12,308
I asked her to do my homework for me, and she made me pay.

131
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:14,859
Never mind.

132
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:19,082
I think it's great that you two are going to be spending time together.

133
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:22,100
Dad and I would be happy to drive you to the party and pick you up.

134
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,165
No!

135
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,035
Thanks, but I'll find some other way to get there.

136
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:33,501
Daria, I'd like it if you'd keep an eye on Quinn at this party.

137
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:36,520
I don't know what I did, but it couldn't have been that bad.

138
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:39,540
I mean it. And she doesn't have to know about it.

139
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:43,653
Is this your way of acknowledging how much more mature and trustworthy I am?

140
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:46,248
It's my way of saying if you won't do it,

141
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:47,949
I'm sending you both with a babysitter.

142
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:52,202
I'll take that as a ringing declaration of parental approval.

143
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:54,371
Just the way it was intended, sweetheart.

144
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,412
I love being the hostess.

145
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,539
It's so easy to get home at the end of the night.

146
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:05,856
You're a great hostess, cupcake. Hey!

147
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:10,832
Did I tell you that I did this really nice thing and invited Daria Morgendorffer,

148
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:13,682
even though she never, ever wears nail polish?

149
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:15,468
Her sister Quinn's coming, too.

150
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:18,870
Oh, no! She's too cute! My friends will kill me!

151
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:22,699
Kevin, you're mixing up the flat ones and the ridgy ones!

152
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:26,313
Everything looks great, munchkin. Why are you so nervous?

153
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:29,461
I'm just afraid people will judge me by my house...

154
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:31,673
and we don't have the Jacuzzi in yet.

155
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,269
Hey, stuff like that doesn't matter.

156
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:37,373
The most popular people with the best-looking hair

157
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:39,117
that's what makes a great party.

158
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:42,604
Thanks for the ride, Trent.

159
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,539
No problem. I needed a break anyway.

160
00:09:45,574 --> 00:09:48,048
I've been practicing for ten hours straight.

161
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:52,855
Daria, would you say sleeping with a guitar in your hands counts as practicing?

162
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,470
As long as you don't drop it.

163
00:09:58,043 --> 00:10:02,170
I'll let you off here. I have a problem dealing with authority.

164
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:03,998
Sure you don't want to crash?

165
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,039
A high school party? Please.

166
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,716
Don't do anything I wouldn't.

167
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:13,653
Bye.

168
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:18,458
Nice conversational skills.

169
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,244
I hate you.

170
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,371
We're here for Brittany Taylor's party.

171
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:25,645
Names?

172
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,901
Daria Morgendorffer.

173
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:31,261
Okay, and you? What's your name?

174
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:34,408
Tiffany. There's gotta be one.

175
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:40,703
Tiffany Hodge, Tiffany Duke, Tiffany Fairchild or Tiffany Blum-Deckler?

176
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,829
Uh... Tiffany Duke?

177
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:47,466
Strike! You're out. I made that one up.

178
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:50,656
Oh... she's not on the guest list.

179
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,740
She's been hired to draw our portraits. She's very talented.

180
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:58,269
And your name is Tiffany Duke, huh?

181
00:10:58,304 --> 00:10:59,886
What a coincidence?

182
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,501
These are some of her sketches from art class.

183
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:05,669
They're very lifelike.

184
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:10,791
These are pretty hot.

185
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:15,937
Stop! Halt there!

186
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:23,492
Huh... never mind. Hello, gorgeous!

187
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:30,765
So I said, "Just because people are cliquey and snotty is no reason not to like them. "

188
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:31,719
Mm-hmm.

189
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:32,854
I agree.

190
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:33,548
Exactly.

191
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:35,451
How do you like my house?

192
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,939
Uh... it's quite coordinated.

193
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:41,917
And the ceramic tigers, they're grrrreat!

194
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,871
Where's the Jacuzzi?

195
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,402
Here, I-I-I got you a drink.

196
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:50,421
This ice isn't crushed.

197
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:51,654
I'll go crush some.

198
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:56,589
You know, Jeffy still sleeps with a teddy bear.

199
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:00,161
These aren't twisty.

200
00:12:00,196 --> 00:12:05,264
I'll go twist some. You know, Jamie's really a sloppy kisser.

201
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,944
I heard it from a girl!

202
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:12,367
I like square crackers.

203
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:17,428
Here. You know Joey was with a...

204
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:18,960
Ugh, gross!

205
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:23,084
Now she's really popular, but not as popular as she is.

206
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:27,805
He's medium popular, and he just bought a great car so soon he'll be getting more popular.

207
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,228
That guy was just popular enough to be invited,

208
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:33,291
but now he needs to hook up with a girl who's more popular than he is.

209
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:37,545
You really want to do this?

210
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:43,302
You know, just because people are cliquey and snotty is no reason not to like them.

211
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:45,003
Or hate them.

212
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:48,745
Chin up, nose up, let's go.

213
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:56,741
Daria, you're here. I'm so glad. Now we're even!

214
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:02,738
This is Jane. She wasn't invited, but she's good in art.

215
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:08,607
But I have you for that. Hmm... what do you know about geometry?

216
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:12,308
Lots of circles, squares and triangles.

217
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,348
Wow! Come on in!

218
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:21,857
Look, two kinds of chips.

219
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,579
Flat or ridgy. You make the call.

220
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:28,534
Chuck Ruttheimer, here. And you are...?

221
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:29,513
Jane.

222
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,426
Esmerelda.

223
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:34,488
I'll be your social director for the evening.

224
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:38,868
Would you ladies like a tour of the house? It's free.

225
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,612
Do you accept tips?

226
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:41,505
Of course.

227
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,291
Ditch the bangs.

228
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:44,652
Feisty...

229
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:02,388
This five-bedroom house is designed in a combination of southern pseudo-plantation

230
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:04,684
and late mock-Tudor styles.

231
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,342
To your right, the quasi-Victorian breakfast nook.

232
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:13,998
Straight ahead, the family den, which was inspired by the novels of Isak Dinesen.

233
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:21,824
And this... is the make-out room! Am I blushing?

234
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:25,057
Confidentially, it's really the laundry room.

235
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:30,288
Hey? Don't lean on the buttons!

236
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:32,500
Can it, Upchuck, or I'll break your face!

237
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,818
As we've reached the end of our tour,

238
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:40,072
I'd like to thank you for your undivided attention. Any questions?

239
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,751
Yes. How did you get invited?

240
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:44,494
I dissected her frog.

241
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:49,338
Now, she used to be very popular, but then then there was that unfortunate nose job.

242
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:53,293
That one behind the tiger? She was new and cute so she became, like, popular overnight.

243
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:56,866
Those three aren't popular at all. I don't know what they're doing here.

244
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:58,695
Maybe some kind of exchange program.

245
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,779
But what's with that girl with the glasses?

246
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:04,861
Her face looks weird. All the same color.

247
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:06,520
She's not wearing makeup.

248
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:08,986
Is that a new look or something?

249
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:11,156
Brrrrr. Scary.

250
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:16,854
Those guys are looking at us.

251
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:19,662
Don't they know we're from two different worlds?

252
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:21,448
Regular and popular?

253
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:23,788
The one in the green shirt is cute...

254
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:27,110
in a head-too-big-for-his-body kind of way.

255
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:30,418
I hate you.

256
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,096
Hey. Partying hard or hardly partying?

257
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,924
Hardly interested.

258
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,304
So... where you girls been all our lives?

259
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,175
Waiting here for you. We were born in this room,

260
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,896
we grew up in this room, and we thought we would die here... alone.

261
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:55,171
But now you've arrived, and our lives can truly begin.

262
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:56,617
She likes you.

263
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:01,976
Hey. Isn't that Quinn?

264
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:02,996
Where?

265
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:06,823
Over there, hiding behind the ceramic tiger.

266
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:09,716
Yoo-hoo! Sis!

267
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:21,243
I- I got to take this class. I've got to find Tiffany.

268
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,623
I mean... Jane.

269
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:31,518
Woo-hoo! Party!

270
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:40,492
I'm glad we found you.

271
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:41,980
We were looking all over.

272
00:16:42,015 --> 00:16:43,299
I looked the hardest.

273
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,955
Uh, I gotta go to the bathroom.

274
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,189
You need some help?

275
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,040
I'll go with you.

276
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,315
It's the bathroom!

277
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:57,630
Hi, sis!

278
00:16:57,665 --> 00:17:02,946
Aren't you a little out of place here? And everywhere else on Earth?

279
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:21,065
Hi, I'm Quinn's brainy sister. People say we look alike.

280
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:24,045
What's she doing in there?

281
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,678
Maybe she's taking a Jacuzzi.

282
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,827
And the traffic was so tied up

283
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:33,144
that my mom finally hands Quinn the empty soda cup and says,

284
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,057
"Here, you gotta go? Then go. "

285
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:44,159
I have this great picture at home of Quinn in her chubby stage.

286
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,328
I've got five dollars.

287
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:51,347
Boy, you try to look out for your little sister...

288
00:17:51,382 --> 00:17:52,537
Make it ten.

289
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:58,023
Well, I have been saving up for a pair of snappy orthopedic shoes.

290
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:01,128
Hello? Anybody there?

291
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,531
There's a wild party going on up at Deer View Court.

292
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:08,614
What do you plan to do about it? You can't ignore me!

293
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:11,930
I pay your salary. Are you sleeping in there?

294
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,694
You're not a real cop, you know!

295
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,459
Quinn, I don't care if your sister is a brain.

296
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:19,118
I would never hold it against you.

297
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:21,075
So, you want to go in the laundry room?

298
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,498
Hands off, Jamie. Quinn, you may come from a nerdy family

299
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,964
but that makes your popularity, like, even more amazing.

300
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,771
Now, why don't we ditch these two losers?

301
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:34,173
Take a hike, Joey. Quinn, if you were my girlfriend,

302
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,747
we could ignore your sister together. Now will you go steady with me?

303
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:39,532
At least for a couple of hours?

304
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:45,019
Oh, no! These shoes are suede!

305
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,206
It's the Soul Train. Beep-beep. Get on board.

306
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,670
What happened to "Bobby Bighead"?

307
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,924
I wasn't really interested.

308
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:07,347
Too bad. Is this yours?

309
00:19:07,382 --> 00:19:12,621
Okay, fine. He thought my head was a lollipop. Ready to go?

310
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:15,129
I was ready to go before we got here.

311
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,487
So, have fun?

312
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:25,635
Well, I didn't talk to a whole bunch of new people,

313
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,823
I made Quinn want to throw herself down a well,

314
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:34,565
and I'm going home with a bonus sock. All in all, a great night.

315
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,117
Joey, Jeffy... Jamie?

316
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:40,094
You got it!

317
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:43,583
Uh... I don't think this is working out.

318
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:44,305
What?

319
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,901
What do you mean?

320
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:45,410
What are you talking about?

321
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,210
I mean, you're really special guys,

322
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:50,570
and you deserve a really great girlfriend. Three, actually.

323
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:53,496
But I feel that you're pressuring me to do things I'm not ready for.

324
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:54,432
Huh?

325
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,026
I don't understand.

326
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:55,833
What do you mean?

327
00:19:55,868 --> 00:19:58,640
That doesn't mean you have to stop paying attention to me

328
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:01,788
and buying me stuff and driving me places, but it does mean that...

329
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:04,552
I think... what I'm trying to say is...

330
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:06,593
"Let's be friends?"

331
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:08,125
Yeah. Sorry.

332
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,124
You came on too strong!

333
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,398
You didn't give her enough space!

334
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,142
You should have brushed your teeth!

335
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:22,797
Stop it... stop fighting. This is horrible.

336
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,201
They're fighting over me.

337
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:31,538
That's it! Everybody out! Vamoose! You too, Kojak.

338
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:33,622
The real cops are here now.

339
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:37,024
Oh! Cops! Does that mean we're on TV?

340
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,873
New security precautions. May I see some I.D., please?

341
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,636
You seem awfully young to be doing this kind of work.

342
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,656
It's a disguise, ma'am. We're actually much older.

343
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:49,655
Not as old as you, of course, ma'am.

344
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,674
Now, we have to a you a few questions.

345
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,545
Is that your natural hair color?

346
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,842
Well, I never in my life...!

347
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:59,137
Never colors it.

348
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:01,648
Known to the Greeks as...?

349
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:02,626
Zeus.

350
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,262
Excellent.

351
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:06,751
I can name that tune in... three notes.

352
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:09,770
Thanks for the party, Brittany.

353
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:11,981
Sorry about the Jacuzzi.

354
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:15,512
It's okay. The wall-to-wall carpeting in the bathrooms makes up for it.

355
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:23,338
Joey? Jeffy? Jamie? How am I going to get home?

356
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:28,611
What happened to your fan club?

357
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:31,758
They beat each other up. It was kind of...

358
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:37,118
what's that thing, when stuff turns out funny? Moronic.

359
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:38,223
Ironic.

360
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:40,052
She was right the first time.

361
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:42,475
You want to call Mom and Dad?

362
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,750
And shift the balance of power? We walk.

363
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:47,918
But my shoes are all squishy.

364
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,980
You ladies in need of a knight in shining armor?

365
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:56,085
Can we just take the armor and ditch the knight?

366
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,146
Hey, it's a package deal, toots.

367
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:04,462
To your left, the home of the town director of public works,

368
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:08,164
built on unstable landfill. To your right, a flattened squirrel.

369
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:10,672
Straight ahead, the future!

370
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:12,543
Stuff a sock in it, Upchuck.

371
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:14,921
Feisty!
