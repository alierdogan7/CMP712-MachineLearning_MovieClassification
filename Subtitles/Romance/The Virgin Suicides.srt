1
00:00:50,047 --> 00:00:52,038
(distant siren)

2
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:02,278
(water dripping)

3
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:06,087
(man) Cecilia was the first to go.

4
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,158
(siren approaches)

5
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:12,162
(voices over two-way radio)

6
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:32,478
(siren starts)

7
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,158
(heart monitor beeping)

8
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,716
What are you doing here, honey?

9
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,004
You're not even old enough
to know how bad life gets.

10
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:56,716
Obviously, Doctor,
you've never been a 1 3-year-old girl.

11
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:33,285
Everyone dates
the demise of our neighbourhood...

12
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,881
..from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.

13
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:40,920
People saw their clairvoyance in
the wiped-out elms, the harsh sunlight...

14
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:44,204
..and the continuing decline
of our auto industry.

15
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:48,435
Even then, as teenagers,
we tried to put the pieces together.

16
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,957
We still can't.

17
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:54,198
Now whenever we run into each other
at lunches or parties...

18
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:57,404
..we find ourselves going over
the evidence one more time.

19
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,559
All to understand those five girls,...

20
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,276
..who, after all these years,
we can't get out of our minds.

21
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,796
Cecilia, the youngest, was 1 3.

22
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:14,401
And Lux was 1 4.

23
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,881
Bonnie was 1 5.

24
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:21,356
Mary was 1 6.

25
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,276
And Therese was 1 7.

26
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:33,081
No one could understand how Mrs Lisbon
and Mr Lisbon, our math teacher,...

27
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:35,840
..had produced such beautiful creatures.

28
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:42,081
Paul Baldino claimed to have
found Cecilia on her first attempt.

29
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,237
Hey, l was the one who found her.

30
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,557
l was in the storm sewer under my house.
There's all these tunnels.

31
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:50,638
You could get into anyone's house.

32
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:52,718
When Paul said this, we believed him...

33
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,799
..because he was the son
of Sammy ''the Shark'' Baldino,...

34
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,196
..and we knew about his escape tunnel.

35
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:01,916
So l went up, thinking l could see
one of those girls taking a shower!

36
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,406
Right!

37
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:05,205
And l walk in...

38
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,005
..and l see blood everywhere.

39
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,240
So l turned around, went for the stairs
and right back out the tunnel.

40
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,878
l had to tell you guys that story.

41
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,483
l'll see you guys later, all right?

42
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:23,126
- (woman) l heard there was an accident.
- (woman #2) lt was no accident, Joan.

43
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:25,402
Of course the parents are to blame!

44
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:28,202
l heard they found the razor in the toilet...

45
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,836
Everyone had an opinion
as to why Cecilia had tried to kill herself.

46
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:35,883
That girl didn't want to die.
She just wanted out of that house.

47
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,561
She wanted out
of that decorating scheme.

48
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:45,882
The most popular theory
held Dominic Palazzolo to blame.

49
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:51,202
Dominic was staying with relatives
until his family got settled in New Mexico.

50
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:54,404
He was the first in our neighbourhood
to wear sunglasses,...

51
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,206
..and within a week of his arrival
he'd fallen in love.

52
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:02,115
The object of his desire wasn't Cecilia,
but Diana Porter.

53
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:08,645
l love her!

54
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:12,879
When Diana Porter left on vacation
in Switzerland, Dominic denounced God.

55
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,438
To prove the validity of his love...

56
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:19,883
..he jumped off the roof
of his relatives' house.

57
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,921
Ahem! l'm gonna
show you some images,...

58
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:47,360
..and, uh... you tell me...

59
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:51,358
..what they remind you of.

60
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,279
OK?

61
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,278
A banana.

62
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:19,678
A swamp.

63
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:30,004
An Afro.

64
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:50,885
l don't think Cecilia
truly meant to end her life.

65
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,318
Her act was a cry for help.

66
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,518
l know you're very strict,...

67
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:02,317
..but l think that Cecilia would benefit
by having a social outlet...

68
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:05,160
..outside of the codification of school,...

69
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,917
..where she could interact
with males her own age.

70
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:21,802
Peter Sisten had helped Mr Lisbon install
a model of the solar system in his class.

71
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:24,799
And in return Mr Lisbon
invited him for dinner.

72
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:27,196
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts,...

73
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:31,121
..which we are about to receive from thy
bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.

74
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,806
Amen.

75
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:35,481
Lux, please, put your shirt on this instant.

76
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,558
(whispers) Sorry.

77
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,800
- Thank you, dear.
- Can you pass the salt, please?

78
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:46,606
- Ham?
- Thank you.

79
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,599
- Sweetheart, would you like some peas?
- l hate peas.

80
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:50,881
Here.

81
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:54,041
(father) That's a nice-looking ham, dear.

82
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:59,000
- Well, thank you, honey.
- (girl) Mm, this is good.

83
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:02,079
So, Peter, are you an aviation enthusiast?

84
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:07,084
Well, l don't know if l'd call myself
an enthusiast, but l like planes.

85
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,679
Ah.

86
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:14,316
Uh, Peter, are you on the football squad?

87
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,680
Um, no, l play it,
but l'm not actually on the team.

88
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,962
- Oh, l see.
- (father) Ah, not a team player.

89
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,639
Do you like to wrestle?

90
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:26,078
- (girls laugh)
- (father) You OK, Peter?

91
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:30,797
The Brazilian turbot frog was added to
the endangered species list today.

92
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,801
- That's the third animal this year.
- Oh, dear.

93
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,685
The turbot frog?
l don't think l've ever heard of...

94
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,962
Um, excuse me, may l use the rest room?

95
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:42,039
Oh, of course. The one down here
isn't working very well.

96
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,324
- Go upstairs through Cecilia's room.
- OK. Thanks.

97
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:52,722
- (knocking)
- Hold... Hold on.

98
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:56,121
(giggles) l thought you'd died in there.

99
00:09:57,367 --> 00:10:00,643
Are you done hogging the bathroom?
l need something.

100
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,604
Do you mind?

101
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,806
(giggles)

102
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,677
- Thank you very much.
- You forgetting something?

103
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:26,717
Oh, Peter. Here's a little aerofoil
l thought you might find amusing.

104
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,638
lt's a...

105
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:32,083
..demonstration of
Bernoulli's principle: lift.

106
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:38,045
From that time on,
the Lisbon house began to change.

107
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:43,677
Almost every day,...

108
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,645
..and even when
she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,...

109
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:49,116
..Lux would suntan wearing a swimsuit...

110
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:54,361
..that caused the knife sharpener to give
her a 1 5-minute demonstration for free.

111
00:10:57,287 --> 00:11:01,166
Following the doctor's orders,
two weeks after Cecilia returned home...

112
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:06,037
..Mr Lisbon persuaded his wife to allow
the girls to throw the first and only party...

113
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:07,924
..of their short lives.

114
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,518
There. ls that OK?

115
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:22,278
l'm gonna get dressed.

116
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,282
- Welcome!
- Good evening, Mrs Lisbon.

117
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,358
Come on in.

118
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:39,997
The party's in the basement.

119
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:46,522
Just go on round to the left,
and then down the stairs.

120
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,476
(mellow middle-of-the-road music )

121
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,519
Hi, l'm Bonaventure.

122
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:01,562
Hi.

123
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:03,638
- Hi. Tim.
- Nice to meet you.

124
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:06,686
Hi.

125
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:11,357
- Would you like some punch?
- Yeah.

126
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:13,521
Thanks.

127
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,598
- Hi.
- Hi.

128
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:18,044
Thanks.

129
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:20,718
- Hi.
- Thank you.

130
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,124
- Hey.
- Hi.

131
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,004
Do you wanna sit down?

132
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,282
- Yeah.
- Me too.

133
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,764
(nervous laughter)

134
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,998
Um, how did your SATs go?

135
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,445
OK.

136
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,324
Good.

137
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,316
Do you know where you're applying yet?

138
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:22,243
Well, no, but my parents
are pushing towards Yale...

139
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:24,318
..cos that's where my dad went.

140
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:27,678
That's nice.

141
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:32,476
You have to imagine
what it'd be like when...

142
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:36,480
..out of the sun would come the Hun
and his Messerschmitt coming down.

143
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,320
And boys, l swear,
two or three years older than you...

144
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:43,116
..would be in this - the P51 B Mustang.
B for what? For bull's-eye, see?

145
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,279
You've heard of Yale?

146
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,358
Oh, yeah.

147
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,245
This punch is fantastic.

148
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,921
- Can l give you more?
- Sure. What's in it?

149
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,960
Juices. Some cherry, pineapple.

150
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:03,004
You know, l uh... l love pineapple.

151
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:06,279
Really?

152
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:19,837
This baby would come in, and this won
the war for the United Kingdom. You see?

153
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,762
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

154
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:27,844
And it's this kind of, uh...
this kind of equipment that makes, uh...

155
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,122
..a model work.

156
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,638
Here's Joe.

157
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,198
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

158
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:43,925
- Now, if he needs anything just call me.
- Oh, l'm sure he'll be fine.

159
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,166
Hi.

160
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,998
Hi.

161
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,363
- Joe! Good to see you. How are ya?
- Hey, Joe.

162
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:55,166
- Glad you came tonight.
- How's it going?

163
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:57,044
You're just in time.

164
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:58,966
Good. Hi.

165
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:01,845
Everyone look! His ears wiggle
if you scratch his chin.

166
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:03,326
(laughter)

167
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,398
Joe, sing your song.

168
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,647
* Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

169
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:13,559
* Oh, the monkeys have no tails
Got bitten off by whales

170
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:17,765
* Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

171
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:20,486
- (cheering)
- Good job, Joe!

172
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,958
(boy) Good job, Joe.

173
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,242
(* The Hollies.: ''The Air That l Breathe'')

174
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:27,557
Where'd you learn that song?

175
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,918
May l be excused?

176
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,876
lf you want to, dear, but this is your party.

177
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:41,645
Oh, all right, if you want to go upstairs,
go ahead, but we'll just...

178
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:44,241
We'll just have to have fun without you.

179
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,521
Oh, look. He always chooses heads.

180
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,598
- Joe, what's it gonna be?
- Heads.

181
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,962
Joe, will you try tails?

182
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,919
Heads it is!

183
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:57,202
l'll show you again. Let's go.

184
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:58,879
- Heads.
- Tails.

185
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,161
Heads.

186
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:02,841
- One more time. ln the air, Joe.
- Heads.

187
00:16:06,327 --> 00:16:08,716
Heads it is anyway. One more time here.

188
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:11,002
- OK, call in the air, Joe.
- Heads.

189
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,397
Heads. Not bad.

190
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:18,358
How you doin'?

191
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,244
Good.

192
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:24,124
- You picked it up really well.
- lt's my favourite song.

193
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:27,156
You know, you're... very beautiful.

194
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,918
l could paint you sometime.

195
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:34,124
Thanks.

196
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:40,843
- So did they sing it to you?
- Yeah.

197
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:42,918
(voices and laughter)

198
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:46,601
(Mr Lisbon) Cecilia!

199
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:48,678
(startled cries)

200
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,403
Cecilia!

201
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,238
(gasps)

202
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:09,277
Oh, my God...

203
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,325
No! No! No! Don't look. Turn around.

204
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:16,436
Turn around. Darlings, turn around.

205
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:19,280
Don't look. Don't... Don't look at this.

206
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:22,355
Oh, Jesus. Please, God.

207
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:26,285
(Mrs Lisbon wails and sobs)

208
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,404
OK.

209
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:56,201
- What did he say?
- He said she was only 1 3.

210
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,238
(door bell)

211
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:12,042
Oh, hi, Mary. Are your parents home?

212
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:14,118
Hi, Father Moody. Come in.

213
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:23,398
Oh, hello, Father.

214
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:26,918
Please, sit down.

215
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:29,557
Thanks.

216
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:31,717
Come on, Miller, that was inside.

217
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,558
Ah, no. No, thanks.

218
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,324
(gulps)

219
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:47,802
How about we get the missus down here,
have a little chat?

220
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,878
Afraid she's under the weather.

221
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,686
(clears throat) She's not really...

222
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,158
..seeing anybody.

223
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,242
Well, she'll see her priest.

224
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:03,839
Ah! This kid's a sucker
for the high inside ones every time.

225
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:05,918
Every time.

226
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,477
Excuse me.

227
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,158
Father.

228
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:21,124
Ah! Double play... Father.

229
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:24,998
Double play.

230
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:48,238
Mrs Lisbon?

231
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,279
(knocks)

232
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,756
- May l come in?
- (girl) OK.

233
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,358
Hello, girls.

234
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,958
l thought we could talk.

235
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:10,838
Do you feel like talking?

236
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:16,200
Well, if you ever want to,
you know where to find me.

237
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:27,678
Mrs Lisbon, it's Father Moody.

238
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,762
Mrs Lisbon, hello.

239
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:44,566
l wanted you to know that
l listed Cecilia's death as an accident.

240
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:02,199
An accident waiting to happen. John said
you couldn't get a policy to cover it.

241
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,403
l know. lt's so incredibly dangerous.

242
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:06,478
Let's give it a try.

243
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,959
Ready?

244
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,878
One, two, three.

245
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:20,042
(sighs) Oh, God. lt's just so sad.
l can't even believe it.

246
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,118
Footings are too deep.

247
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:24,524
Got that chain in your truck?

248
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,798
(engine starts)

249
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:45,238
Hit it!

250
00:22:59,287 --> 00:23:03,519
Our collection of souvenirs
of the Lisbon girls, which still exists,...

251
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,837
..started with Cecilia's diary.

252
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:09,317
Parkie had gotten it from Skip Ortega,
the plumber's assistant,...

253
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:11,637
..who had found it next to the toilet.

254
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:14,241
Tim Weiner - ''the Brain'' - decoded it.

255
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,363
Emotional instability.

256
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:19,644
Look at the i's.
The dots on 'em, they're everywhere.

257
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,119
Basically,...

258
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:25,243
..what we have here is a dreamer.

259
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:27,682
Someone completely
out of touch with reality.

260
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:31,043
When she jumped,
she probably thought she would fly.

261
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:36,883
''Monday, February 1 3th.
Today we had frozen pizza.''

262
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:45,045
''Thursday. Mom made creamed corn for
dinner. lt's the worst. lt looks like...''

263
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,400
''Mary chipped her front tooth
on the monkey bars.''

264
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:54,116
''She made a big scene and had to
get it capped. lt looks normal, l guess.''

265
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:56,198
Here, give me that.

266
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:59,037
Told you she had a capped tooth.

267
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:07,722
Elm trees. How many pages
can you write about dying trees?

268
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,398
Here, something about Dominic.

269
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:16,477
''Palazzolo jumped off the roof
over that rich bitch Porter.''

270
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,842
''How stupid can you be?''

271
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:23,396
''Today we went out on the boat.
lt was cold.''

272
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:25,523
''We saw a couple of whales.''

273
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:28,963
''Lux stroked the whale.
l didn't think they'd stink so much.''

274
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,686
''lt's the kelp in their baleens rotting.''

275
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,997
''l hope we can go again sometime.''

276
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:37,560
Let's read that. ''Lux lost it over Kevin...''

277
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:40,400
- ls it Heines?
- ''Heines, the garbage man.''

278
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:43,604
(Cecilia) Lux lost it over Kevin Haines,
the garbage man.

279
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:47,475
She'd wake up at five in the morning
and hang out on the front steps -

280
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:49,558
..like it wasn't completely obvious.

281
00:24:49,647 --> 00:24:52,559
She wrote his name in marker
on all her underwear.

282
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:55,036
Mom found them
and bleached out the Kevins.

283
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,322
Lux was crying on her bed all day.

284
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:08,201
The trees like lungs filling with air.

285
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:12,119
My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair.

286
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:20,956
(narrator) And so we started
to learn about their lives,...

287
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:25,040
..coming to hold collective memories
of times we hadn't experienced.

288
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:30,485
We felt the imprisonment of being a girl,
the way it made your mind dreamy...

289
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:33,127
..so you ended up knowing
what colours went together.

290
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:36,165
We knew the girls
were really women in disguise,...

291
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:39,045
..that they understood love
and even death,...

292
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:44,717
..and that our job was merely to create
the noise that seemed to fascinate them.

293
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,840
We knew that they knew
everything about us.

294
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:50,398
And that we couldn't fathom them at all.

295
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:06,119
Hi. Uh, Mrs Lisbon, l'm Lydia Perl.

296
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,402
l'm putting together a... Oh.

297
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:12,801
- Hi, l'm Bonnie. This is Mary.
- Hello, girls.

298
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:17,881
Um, l'm here to ask you
a couple of questions about Cecilia.

299
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:21,046
Yeah?

300
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:26,965
Great, great. Um, maybe you could start
by telling me a little bit about her.

301
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:31,442
Did she have any
special interests or hobbies?

302
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:35,840
- Um, she liked writing in her journal a lot.
- That is great.

303
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:39,524
Um, OK. Uh, did she...

304
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:42,201
Did she ever talk about ending her life?

305
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:44,683
What's going on here?

306
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:47,520
Um, you must be Mrs Lisbon.

307
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,916
l'm Lydia Perl. l'm from Channel 2, and...

308
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:51,998
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

309
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:56,319
The suicide of an East Side teenager
last summer...

310
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,479
..has increased the awareness
of a national crisis.

311
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:02,286
l'm in front of the home
where Cecilia Lisbon...

312
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,403
Why can't they let her rest in peace?

313
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:08,036
..and write poetry,
tragically put an end to her life.

314
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,802
Psychologists agree that adolescence
today is much more fraught...

315
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:15,004
..by pressures and complexities
than in years past.

316
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:19,126
More and more doctors say this
frustration can lead to acts of violence,...

317
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:23,837
..whose reality the adolescent cannot
separate from its intended drama.

318
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:27,759
l baked a pie full of rat poison.

319
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:32,486
l thought l could eat it, you know,
without being suspicious.

320
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:37,042
My nana, who is 86...

321
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,718
She really liked sweets.

322
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:46,798
She had three pieces.

323
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:54,722
(woman) l feel sorriest for the mother.

324
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:58,436
(woman #2) You'd always wonder if
there was something you could've done.

325
00:27:58,527 --> 00:28:01,485
- l gotta go. See you later.
- All right, then. Bye-bye.

326
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,558
Bye-bye. (hangs up)

327
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,158
(wind chimes tinkling)

328
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:04,437
Don't worry.

329
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:07,238
They took the fence out.

330
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:16,238
(birds twittering)

331
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:29,358
God, you snore loud.

332
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:31,918
(alarm buzzer)

333
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,440
Those girls have a bright future
ahead of them.

334
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:19,006
The other one
was just gonna end up a kook.

335
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:23,877
We didn't see the girls together as
a group until convocation, September 7 th.

336
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:30,076
Mary, Lux, Bonnie and Therese came to
school as though nothing had happened.

337
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:32,158
We felt if we looked hard enough,...

338
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,956
..we might begin to understand what
they were feeling and who they were.

339
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:40,325
All right, so if we have - these are
Venn diagrams, as you remember...

340
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:44,002
lf we have A and B intersecting,...

341
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:46,078
..and A and B...

342
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:49,079
lf A intersects B, we have this area.

343
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:54,562
And if A is the union with B, we have
all of the circle, plus the intersection.

344
00:30:55,327 --> 00:31:00,447
These are the laws of
intersection and union. OK?

345
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:12,998
How's it going?

346
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,118
Not bad.

347
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:23,719
''Do a character sketch on the following
characters from Portrait Of A Lady. ''

348
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:26,605
The first one is... Ralph.

349
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:29,645
Um, he was nice.

350
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,922
lt was really sad when he died.

351
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:37,240
Oh, my gosh.
l can't believe l just said that.

352
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:39,318
l am so sorry.

353
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,040
Reading about
the alarming suicide rate,...

354
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:57,324
..l talked to Mr Woodhouse
and some of the teachers here...

355
00:31:57,407 --> 00:32:00,956
..and realised that nothing
about this serious matter...

356
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,641
..has been discussed at this school.

357
00:32:03,727 --> 00:32:06,764
Quickly thereafter
green pamphlets were distributed.

358
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:10,522
(teacher) We thought green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful.

359
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,598
Certainly better than red.

360
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:15,645
They told us there were
80 suicides a day in America,...

361
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,197
- ..30,000 a year,...
- (all) Cheese!

362
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:22,597
..and alerted us to danger signals
we couldn't help but look for.

363
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:25,317
Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?

364
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:29,722
Had they lost interest in school activities,
in sports and hobbies?

365
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:32,116
Had they withdrawn from their peers?

366
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,879
Hi. l'm Chase.

367
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:39,918
l know who you are.

368
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,919
l've only been going to this school
my whole life.

369
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:46,998
You don't have to talk to me.

370
00:32:56,287 --> 00:33:00,041
(teacher) For example, we have
two different types of economics -

371
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:04,917
..or so-called two different types.
The first one is called macroeconomics.

372
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:08,567
Look. She's laughing.

373
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:15,123
He made her laugh! l've never heard him
say anything remotely intelligent.

374
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:19,639
The boys who talked with Lux
were always the stupidest...

375
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:22,195
..and made terrible
sources of information.

376
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,517
Squeezebox is all right.

377
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:28,043
Let me tell you, she's the hottest girl
in the school for sure.

378
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,838
Do you wanna know what happened?
Smell my fingers, man.

379
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:34,522
Nah, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

380
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:37,679
We weren't exactly talking,
if you know what l mean.

381
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:42,440
But the only reliable boy
who actually got to know Lux...

382
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:46,964
..was Trip Fontaine, who only
eight months before the suicides...

383
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:50,801
..had emerged from baby fat
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

384
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:54,324
(whispers) l'm late again.

385
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:59,238
Oh, come on.

386
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:09,764
Thank you.

404
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:20,400
All the girls at our school
were in love with Trip.

405
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:23,438
All the girls except for Lux.

406
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,755
Trip told us his passion for Lux started...

407
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:30,726
..when he went into the wrong
history class during fifth period.

408
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:34,083
He went out to his car
to smoke the marijuana he took...

409
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:38,558
..as regularly as Peter Petrovich,
the diabetic kid, took his insulin.

410
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:46,240
On this particular day
he ran into Mr Woodhouse...

411
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,636
..and ducked into the nearest class.

412
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:05,636
(Trip) She was the still point
of the turning world, man.

413
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:10,119
l never got over that girl. Never.

414
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:15,716
l mean... you know,
l loved a lot of ladies, but not like that.

415
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,798
That was real.

416
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:22,480
l'll never forget the first time l saw her.
l didn't know what had hit me.

417
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,964
l didn't know what to do...

418
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:28,681
..cos it was so easy
with all the other girls,...

419
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,758
..but she wouldn't look at me.

420
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,964
l, uh...

421
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:36,437
l was never the kind to pursue,
if you know what l mean.

422
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:42,362
That girl drove me crazy, man.

423
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:58,558
Mm, yummy. Warm.

424
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:01,163

425
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:03,044

426
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:10,757
- Look at it. lt's just meat on bread.
- Eugh! Sick!

00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:30,400
Well, first off, don't call her on the phone.

431

lt's all nuance.

00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,679
Yeah. You just need
to talk to her at school, you know,...

434
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:42,726
..about anything. About the weather,
or school assignments.

435
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:46,163
Um, you know, anything
to have the chance to communicate...

436
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:49,000
..with the language of eye contact.

437
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:51,522
And, uh, project confidence.

438
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:55,321
And keep the hair out of your eyes.

439
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:58,878
She'll feel the vibe.

440
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:07,598

- Yeah.

(documentary narrator)
The word hurricane was the name...

442
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:16,160
..given to nature's strongest storm.

443
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:19,876
A hurricane occurs when high pressure
and low pressure masses of air...

444
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,197
..come in contact with one another.

445
00:38:23,487 --> 00:38:28,481
There is often a significant difference
in temperature between the two masses.

446
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:31,761
One mass is warm,
while the other is cold.

447
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:36,837
The warmer air rises
and the cooler air falls.

448
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:43,436
Likewise, the low pressure slides down
the sides of the high-pressure area.

449
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:48,237
They swirl in and around one another,
creating the beginnings of the storm.

450
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:54,122
ln this footage, taken from
US Navy weather patrol aircraft,...

451
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,562
..we can clearly observe
the two masses,...

452
00:38:56,647 --> 00:39:01,437
..one high pressure and one low,
coming in contact with one another.

453
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:07,559
The result is a surging storm
of tremendous strength...

454
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:10,559
..that strikes with forceful determination.

455
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:20,563
Even though the hurricane is
the most powerful storm known to us...

456
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:22,239

..for the drama played out by the herds
and the great cats that prey on them.

lf you want to come over and
watch TV again, that would be fine,...

516
00:44:57,607 --> 00:45:01,486
..but you cannot take Lux out,
especially not in a car.

517
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,161
So l'm sorry, son, that's just our policy.

518
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,836
OK, sir, what if there was
a bunch of us guys...

519
00:45:10,927 --> 00:45:13,521
..and we took
all your daughters out in a group...

520
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:16,246
..and we had 'em back
by whatever time you said?

521
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:19,683
- Are you on the football squad, son?
- Yes, sir.

522
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:22,645
- Ah. What position?
- Defensive cornerback.

523
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:25,082
Ah. Good. Good.

524
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:28,079
l was a... (coughs)
l was a safety in my day.

525
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:31,842
That's a crucial position, sir.
Nothing between you and the goal line.

526
00:45:31,927 --> 00:45:34,157
- Exactly! Exactly.

527
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:35,646
Oh, well...

528
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:39,402
So the thing is, sir, we've got
the big game against Country Day,...

529
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:44,197
..then afterwards we have the dance and...
all the other guys are taking dates.

530
00:45:44,287 --> 00:45:48,360
You're a good-looking fellow, Trip.
Lots of girls would go with you, l bet.

531
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:52,803
Yeah, well, l'm not interested
in lots of girls, sir.

532
00:45:58,927 --> 00:46:01,919
l'll take it up with the wife, Trip.
Do what l can.

533
00:46:03,647 --> 00:46:05,638
Thank you, sir.

534
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:09,238
- lt's a graph.
- Oh.

535
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:12,366
Mm.

00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:20,438
Trip Fontaine and some of the...

537
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:26,117
..other boys in the football squad asked to
take the girls to the Homecoming dance.

538
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:28,801
You know how l feel
about that sort of thing.

539
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:32,926
- l'm gonna be a chaperon at the dance.
- Oh, come on, Mom. Please!

540
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:36,321
Your father and l will discuss it later.

541
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:41,805
Mr Fontaine,
may l speak with you, please?

542
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:45,287
Now, my wife and l have had a little talk...

543
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:48,484
..and we've come to a decision
about your request.

544
00:47:00,887 --> 00:47:02,479
Yes!

545
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:09,564
- (whistle)
- l'm taking Lux Lisbon to Homecoming.

546
00:47:09,647 --> 00:47:12,639
- l need three guys to take the other girls.
- (whistle)

547
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,044
l'll give you three joints, Trip.

548
00:47:21,127 --> 00:47:24,358
Come on, Trip, man. You pick me,
we can take my dad's Caddy.

549
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:26,438
You gotta pick me, Tripster!

550
00:47:27,687 --> 00:47:30,076
Trip, man, you owe me.

551
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:32,886
l saved your ass
with Woodhouse that time.

552
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:34,639
- (shrieks) Thanks, Dad!
- OK.

553
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,287
- Who are the other boys?
- Ah, let's see.

554
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:40,564
Parker Denton and Jake Conley.
He's a very good student, dear.

555
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:43,241
And, uh... Kevin Head.

556
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,443
- Who's taking who?
- Whom.

557
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:47,518
They're just gonna raffle us off.

558
00:47:49,727 --> 00:47:53,845
lt made no difference which pattern
of their dream dresses the girls chose.

559
00:47:53,927 --> 00:47:58,125
Mrs Lisbon added an inch to the
bust line and two to the waist and hems.

560
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,681
And the dresses came out
as four identical sacks.

561
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,038
- Everybody decent?
- Yeah.

562
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:07,558
OK. Come on.

563
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:13,923
Oh, l'm sorry. OK, there we go.
OK, come on, together.

564
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,797
- There's a leak.
- And Cheddar cheese!

565
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:23,078
l'm so excited!

566
00:48:42,847 --> 00:48:44,838
- You ready?
- Let's go.

567
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:47,521
- Ready, man.
- Let's do it.

568
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:55,560
ln the end Parkie won
because of the Cadillac,...

569
00:48:55,647 --> 00:48:58,161
..Kevin Head because
he had the killer weed...

570
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:01,000
..and Joe Hill Conley
because he won school prizes -

571
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:04,443
..which Trip thought
would impress Mr and Mrs Lisbon.

572
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:08,601
- Hello, boys.
- (boys) Hello, Mrs Lisbon.

573
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:10,646

How long have you had your licence?

577
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:32,445
Two months, but l had
my learner's permit for a year.

578
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:36,202
We almost never let the girls
go out in cars unless it's necessary.

579
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:40,200
There's so many accidents nowadays.
l'm sure you will be very careful.

580
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:43,279
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- OK, third degree's over!

581

582
00:49:48,007 --> 00:49:51,841
- l better get going. See you at the dance.
- See you there, Mr Lisbon.

583
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:53,918
Bye, dear.

584
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:56,158
See you later.

585
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,238

586
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:05,118

588
00:50:28,687 --> 00:50:30,678
We got white ones.

589
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:35,241
We didn't know what you were wearing,
and the guy, the flower guy, said...

590
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:37,716
..that white would go with anything, so...

591
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:40,638
l'm glad you got white.

592
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:44,756

593

596
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:17,524
Bye, Mom.

597
00:51:17,647 --> 00:51:18,841
Bye.

598
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:30,439
Oh my gosh, look, you guys.
Her car's there late again.

599
00:51:30,527 --> 00:51:32,677
Mr Leo's having an affair with the maid.

600
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:35,122
l saw him follow her
into the laundry room.

601
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:38,961
- Eugh! He's so fat, and that red nose.
- Totally an alcoholic.

602
00:51:39,047 --> 00:51:41,481
What about the Hessens?
You know they're Nazis.

603
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:43,478
They're Nazi sympathisers, Bonnie.

604
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:47,879
They had a fit when the Schwartzmans
tried to join the tennis club.

605

Nice aluminum siding(!)
Do they really think that looks OK?

Mr Kriegers ordered that
from TV late at night.

607
00:51:55,447 --> 00:52:00,362
- lt's the Baldinos' barbecue tree stump.
- l have never seen them barbecue on it.

608
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:03,359
Actually it's an escape tunnel
for Sammy ''the Shark''.

609
00:52:03,447 --> 00:52:07,520
- Leads to a river where he has his boat.
- Yeah. Paul goes there all the time.

610
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:10,679
He can get into anyone's basement
through the storm sewers.

611
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:12,758
- No way.
- Yeah.

612
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:14,924
Cool.

613
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:30,239
- (Bonnie) Dad'll smell it on you.
- No, l got mints.

614
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,483
He'll smell it on your clothes.

615
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:37,162
l'll just tell him some kids
were smoking in the bathroom.

616

00:57:55,687 --> 00:57:57,006
* Come sail away

687
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:58,361
* Come sail away

688
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:03,203
* Come sail away with me

689
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:08,038
l'm having the best time!

690
00:58:23,847 --> 00:58:25,917
(whispers) Let's go for a walk.

691
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:28,840
We better not.
We've gotta go back in a minute.

692
00:58:30,247 --> 00:58:33,603
We can keep an eye on the car.
They won't leave without us.

693
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:37,398
My dad.

694
00:58:37,887 --> 00:58:40,924
Just tell him you had to put
the crown in your locker.

695
00:58:42,847 --> 00:58:45,042
- Hey, see that divot there?
- Uh-huh.

696
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:48,836
That's where l reamed this guy today
in a cross-body block.

697
00:58:49,367 --> 00:58:51,358
- Really?
- (growls)

698
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:56,357
- (Parkie) Maybe they went with your dad.
- l doubt it.

699
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:00,796
- We're cooked.
- Luxie is. We're not.

700
00:59:02,407 --> 00:59:04,398
(panting)

701
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:20,678
Does anyone have any mints?

702
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:23,158
- Sorry.
- No.

703
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:29,758
Bye, Parkie.

704
00:59:31,807 --> 00:59:35,004
- We'll walk you to the door.
- No, don't.

705
00:59:35,687 --> 00:59:37,439
Why not?

706
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:39,483
Just don't.

707
00:59:41,687 --> 00:59:42,881
OK.

708
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:46,077
Will you call me?

709
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,158
Uh, absolutely.

710
00:59:53,327 --> 00:59:55,238
- Bye.
- Bye.

711
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:57,124
Bye.

712
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:03,758
(birds cheeping)

713
01:02:29,727 --> 01:02:31,718
(Mrs Lisbon) Where have you been?

714
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:36,838
Get in!

715
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:47,716
(adult Trip)
l walked home alone that night.

716
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,480
l didn't care how she got home.
lt was weird.

717
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:55,086
l mean, l liked her, l liked her a lot,
but out there on the field...

718
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,198
lt was just different then.

719
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,238
That was the last time l saw her.

720
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:11,682
You know, most people
will never taste that kind of love.

721
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:14,477
But at least l tasted it once, right?

722
01:03:19,687 --> 01:03:22,599
lt's time for your
six o'clock group meeting.

723
01:03:36,887 --> 01:03:41,119
Given Lux's failure to make curfew,
everyone expected a crackdown.

724
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:43,126
(door shuts)

725
01:03:43,207 --> 01:03:45,880
But few anticipated it would be so drastic.

726
01:03:46,647 --> 01:03:48,842
The girls were taken out of school...

727
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:52,886
..and Mrs Lisbon shut the house
in maximum security isolation.

728
01:03:54,727 --> 01:03:57,799
She had done more than
just take the girls out of school.

729
01:03:57,887 --> 01:04:01,004
That Sunday,
arriving home from a church sermon,...

730
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,965
..Mrs Lisbon commanded Lux
to destroy her rock records.

731
01:04:04,047 --> 01:04:05,844
Now!

732
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,918
(sobs) But, Mom!

733
01:04:08,007 --> 01:04:10,202
This is final, Luxie.

734
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:13,677
- lt's not fair!
- l said now!

735
01:04:16,327 --> 01:04:18,318
(sighs)

736
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:32,278
Now, Luxie!

737
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:46,724
Come on.

738
01:04:46,807 --> 01:04:48,798
Hold on.

739
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:54,796
Kiss! Please don't make me do this.

740
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:56,878
Burn it.

741
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:05,158
(coughs)

742
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:10,678
Oh, Mom. Aerosmith!

743
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:13,361
- Come on. Don't make me burn this.
- No.

744
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,998
(girl) What's that smell?

745
01:05:18,287 --> 01:05:22,246
lt's all right. That'll do for now.
Give me these. Give me these.

746
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:24,958
l'll put them in the trash.

747
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:33,918
(coughs)

748
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:46,247
(chain saw revs)

749
01:05:56,007 --> 01:05:57,645
(men whoop)

750
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:04,517
This was the time we began to see Lux
making love on the roof...

751
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:06,404
..with random boys and men.

752
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:08,876
- ls she naked?
- You can't tell. Hold on.

753
01:06:08,967 --> 01:06:10,958
Well, get it focused.

754
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:15,237
- Will you stop? Wait your turn.
- What are they doing?

755
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:19,362
- They're rolling around up there.
- Let me see. Let me see.

756
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:23,360
Hold on. And she's on him and
he's rubbing his hands through her hair.

757
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:27,156
- Come on, let me look.
- No, it's my... lt's my telescope, Chase!

758
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:29,920
- (laughs)
- Yes, and what else?

759
01:06:30,007 --> 01:06:34,637
Our male up there
seems to be in a Burger Chalet uniform!

760
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:40,725
That Burger Chalet - you never think
those guys ever get lucky.

761
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:44,204
She turns to me and asks me
if l thought what we'd done was dirty.

762
01:06:44,287 --> 01:06:46,482
l knew what to say. l said no.

763
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:49,445
Then she grabs my hand
and goes ''You like me, don't you?''

764
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:53,202
l didn't say anything.
lt's best to keep chicks guessing.

765
01:06:53,287 --> 01:06:57,326
(woman) Chase, honey!
Come practise your violin before dinner!

766
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,760
You're not gonna believe it.
Lux is on the roof again tonight!

767
01:07:03,847 --> 01:07:06,884
- Her hands are moving down.
- l gotta see this!

768
01:07:07,487 --> 01:07:10,843
- This is beautiful.
- No, no. She's on top of him.

769
01:07:11,607 --> 01:07:13,598
- What's she doin', man?
- Wait.

770
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:17,077
Now they're done, he's getting up.

771
01:07:19,887 --> 01:07:21,684
- That's it?
- Popcorn.

772
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:23,166
That was quick.

773
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:32,558
(mutters)

774
01:07:36,607 --> 01:07:39,724
Ooh, good morning!
Good morning (mumbles plant name)

775
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:42,556
Have we photosynthesised
breakfast today?

776
01:07:51,287 --> 01:07:53,084
(mutters)

777
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:55,158
Hello, Ronald.

778
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:57,359
Hi, Eric.

779
01:07:57,447 --> 01:08:00,757
Your daughters haven't been at school
for over two weeks.

780
01:08:02,887 --> 01:08:04,878
You checked out back?

781
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:11,836
(woman) They found a new math teacher.

782
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:15,679
- Well, he's gonna have to get another job.
- l know.

783
01:08:16,807 --> 01:08:20,402
(sighs) How long can those girls
be cooped up like that?

784
01:08:39,927 --> 01:08:42,760
- Just go away. This is our tree.
- Girls!

785
01:08:42,847 --> 01:08:46,283
Girls, it's a little late. This tree is dead.

786
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:49,882
- Why not leave it up to nature?
- lf we did, there'd be no trees left.

787
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,562
That's what it's gonna be like anyway.

788
01:08:52,647 --> 01:08:56,037
lf boats hadn't brought the fungus,
this wouldn't have happened.

789
01:08:56,127 --> 01:08:58,322
OK? Let's go.

790
01:09:00,327 --> 01:09:01,521
No?

791
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:03,764
All right. That's it.

792
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:07,920
l have an order to cut down your elm tree,
but your kids won't let us.

793
01:09:08,007 --> 01:09:12,523
- How do you know that tree's sick?
- lt had yellow leaves. The tree is dead.

794
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,758
Our daughter said Aritex is
a less aggressive therapy.

795
01:09:15,847 --> 01:09:19,522
lt doesn't work. l leave that tree,
they'll all be gone by next year.

796
01:09:19,607 --> 01:09:21,723
Will be anyway, way things are going!

797
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:24,002
l don't want to call the police.

798
01:09:24,087 --> 01:09:28,922
Our daughters are standing on their own
front lawn. Since when is that a crime?

799
01:09:30,527 --> 01:09:32,119
Right.

800
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:34,004
(Mr Lisbon) Uh...

801
01:09:43,407 --> 01:09:48,117
Clive, did you see those girls in the
nighties? That's the shot that l want, OK?

802
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:51,040
Honey, move forward.
l want those girls in the nighties.

803
01:09:51,127 --> 01:09:54,483
Oh, God. OK.
Here, let's just back up a little bit.

804
01:09:56,727 --> 01:09:58,718
There you go. ls that good? OK?

805
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:03,399
Four sisters of Cecilia Lisbon,
the East Side teenager...

806
01:10:03,487 --> 01:10:07,605
..whose suicide last summer focused
awareness on a national problem,...

807
01:10:07,687 --> 01:10:13,523
..put their own lives in jeopardy by trying
to protect the elm that Cecilia so loved.

808
01:10:13,607 --> 01:10:15,598
(chain saws buzz)

809
01:11:03,687 --> 01:11:06,599
For the next few weeks
we hardly saw the girls at all.

810
01:11:08,887 --> 01:11:12,402
Joe Hill Conley didn't call Therese
as he had promised.

811
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:19,476
And Lux never spoke to Trip again.

812
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:24,758
(Trip) You're a stone fox.

813
01:11:29,847 --> 01:11:32,236
The girls' only contact with the outside...

814
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:36,002
..was through catalogues they ordered
that filled their mailbox...

815
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:41,559
..with pictures of high-end fashions
and brochures for exotic vacations.

816
01:11:42,247 --> 01:11:44,158
Unable to go anywhere,...

817
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:48,001
..the girls travelled in their imaginations
to Siamese temples...

818
01:11:48,087 --> 01:11:53,002
..or passed an old man with a leaf broom
tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

819
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:57,437
We ordered the same catalogues...

820
01:11:57,527 --> 01:12:01,486
..and, flipping through the pages,
we hiked through passes with the girls,...

821
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,685
..stopping every now and then
to help them with their backpacks,...

822
01:12:05,767 --> 01:12:08,839
..placing our hands
on their warm, moist shoulders...

823
01:12:08,927 --> 01:12:11,680
..and gazing off at papaya sunsets.

824
01:12:13,247 --> 01:12:15,841
We drank tea with them
in a water pavilion.

825
01:12:16,687 --> 01:12:18,678
We did whatever we wanted.

826
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:23,755
Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

827
01:12:26,767 --> 01:12:29,122
The only way
we could feel close to the girls...

828
01:12:29,207 --> 01:12:33,962
..was through these impossible trips
which have scarred us forever,...

829
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,437
..making us happier
with dreams than wives.

830
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:44,122
Collecting everything we could of theirs,
the Lisbon girls wouldn't leave our minds.

831
01:12:44,207 --> 01:12:46,198
But they were slipping away.

832
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:51,516
The colour of their eyes was fading, along
with the locations of moles and dimples.

833
01:12:51,607 --> 01:12:53,598
From five they had become four,...

834
01:12:53,687 --> 01:12:58,203
..and they were all living in the dead,
becoming shadows.

835
01:12:58,287 --> 01:13:01,757
We'd have lost them completely
if they hadn't contacted us.

836
01:13:01,847 --> 01:13:03,838
OK, one long,...

837
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:06,444
..two short...

838
01:13:07,047 --> 01:13:09,083
- ..and one long.
- Mm-hm.

839
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:10,839
You got that? That's it.

840
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:16,118
''Help.''

841
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:18,558
''Send...

842
01:13:19,727 --> 01:13:21,558
..bo...

843
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,080
..bo.''

844
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,400
- Bo-bo?
- Bo-bo.

845
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:29,399
That's what it says: bo-bo.

846
01:13:29,487 --> 01:13:33,605
''Help send bo-bo''?
l thought you knew Morse code.

847
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:02,878
Something here for you.

848
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:12,358
l got one, too.

849
01:14:14,607 --> 01:14:17,405
We racked our brains
for a way of contacting them.

850
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:21,480
Tom Faheem suggested we fly a kite
with a message alongside the house,...

851
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,717
..but that had logistical problems.

852
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:26,958
ln the end, the answer was so simple
it took a week to work out.

853
01:14:27,527 --> 01:14:29,518
We called them on the telephone.

854
01:14:29,847 --> 01:14:31,439
727...

855
01:14:31,527 --> 01:14:34,519
- ..8221 .
- 8221 .

856
01:14:34,607 --> 01:14:36,802
(whispers) Get ready.

857
01:14:38,847 --> 01:14:41,236
- (Mary) Hello?
- Go!

858
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:45,917
(Todd Rundgren) * Hello, it's me

859
01:14:48,487 --> 01:14:53,197
* l've thought about us
for a long, long time

860
01:14:53,287 --> 01:14:55,278
Call us. 727 0487.

861
01:15:00,527 --> 01:15:02,916
- (phone rings)
- Shit! lt's them.

862
01:15:08,287 --> 01:15:11,199
(Gilbert O'Sullivan)
* To think that only yesterday

863
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:13,676
* l was cheerful, bright and gay

864
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:16,235
* Looking forward to - who wouldn't do? -

865
01:15:16,327 --> 01:15:19,000
* The role l was about to play

866
01:15:19,087 --> 01:15:21,647
* But in my hour of need

867
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:24,161
* l truly am indeed

868
01:15:24,247 --> 01:15:26,124
* Alone again

869
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:28,086
* Naturally

870
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:34,003
(The Bee Gees)
* Run to me whenever you're lonely

871
01:15:34,087 --> 01:15:40,083
* Run to me if you need a shoulder

872
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:46,481
* Now and then you need someone older

873
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:48,797
* So darling

874
01:15:48,887 --> 01:15:52,402
(Carole King) * So far away

875
01:15:52,487 --> 01:15:58,483
* Doesn't anybody stay
in one place any more?

876
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:04,564
* lt would be so fine
to see your face at my door

877
01:16:05,647 --> 01:16:12,359
* Doesn't help to know you're just far

878
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:14,403
* Away

879
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,478
l gotta go home. See ya tomorrow.

880
01:16:16,967 --> 01:16:18,958
l'll see you later.

881
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:25,724
- (Lux) We're suffocating.
- (Mrs Lisbon) You're safe here.

882
01:16:25,807 --> 01:16:27,604
l can't breathe in here.

883
01:16:29,247 --> 01:16:31,238
No answer.

884
01:16:52,247 --> 01:16:54,636
- (Tim) What time is it?
- (Chase) Any time now.

885
01:16:55,367 --> 01:16:57,562
- Guys, there it is.
- What?

886
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:03,597
(Tim) Yeah, it's them.

887
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:06,478
(all) Let's go!

888
01:17:17,447 --> 01:17:19,836
(whispers) l have keys to my mom's car.

889
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:29,716
- (clatter)
- Shh!

890
01:17:42,967 --> 01:17:44,958
Maybe we should knock.

891
01:17:47,007 --> 01:17:48,201
(knocks)

892
01:17:50,447 --> 01:17:51,641
We're here.

893
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:03,638
About time.

894
01:18:03,727 --> 01:18:05,718
We've been waiting for you guys.

895
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:09,523
We got a car, a full tank.
We'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

896
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:11,882
lt's just a Cougar, but it's got a big trunk.

897
01:18:12,407 --> 01:18:13,999
Can l sit up front?

898
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:16,886
Sure.

899
01:18:19,447 --> 01:18:22,598
Which one of you
is gonna sit up front next to me?

900
01:18:23,927 --> 01:18:25,519
Where are your parents?

901
01:18:26,407 --> 01:18:27,806
Asleep.

902
01:18:27,887 --> 01:18:31,163
- What about your sisters?
- They're coming.

903
01:18:31,967 --> 01:18:34,322
Come on, it's getting late.

904
01:18:35,527 --> 01:18:39,406
Wait five minutes. We had to wait
until my parents were asleep.

905
01:18:39,487 --> 01:18:43,082
They take for ever.
My mom's an insomniac.

906
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:49,641
We better take our car.
There's more room.

907
01:18:51,247 --> 01:18:53,442
Think you can handle a station wagon?

908
01:18:54,487 --> 01:18:57,399
Sure. lt's not a stick, is it?

909
01:18:57,487 --> 01:18:59,876
- No.
- Yeah, no problem.

910
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:03,358
- Will you let me steer?
- Sure.

911
01:19:03,727 --> 01:19:06,844
But maybe we should go.
l heard somethin'. Could be your mom.

912
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:09,558
Come on in.

913
01:19:19,127 --> 01:19:23,086
l'll go wait in the car.
You guys wait here for my sisters.

914
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:42,438
(girls giggling)

915
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,523
(humming)

916
01:19:53,967 --> 01:19:55,764
(thud)

917
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:20,715
These girls are making me crazy.
lf l could feel one of 'em up just once...

918
01:20:24,207 --> 01:20:25,799
What?

919
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:31,404
(creaking)

920
01:20:31,487 --> 01:20:33,478
(hissing)

921
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:45,684
We would never be sure
about the sequence of events.

922
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:48,158
We argue about it still.

923
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:54,842
Most likely Bonnie had died while we
were waiting in the living room,...

924
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:56,918
..dreaming of highways.

925
01:20:57,927 --> 01:21:00,964
Mary put her head in the oven
shortly thereafter.

926
01:21:01,687 --> 01:21:06,158
Therese, stuffed with sleeping pills,
was gone by the time we got there.

927
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:08,639
Lux was the last to go.

928
01:21:08,727 --> 01:21:10,718
(engine running)

929
01:21:12,287 --> 01:21:14,084
(coughs)

930
01:21:18,047 --> 01:21:22,165
lt's four o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
Do you know where your children are?

931
01:21:22,247 --> 01:21:25,239
(reporters' voices overlapping)

932
01:21:30,607 --> 01:21:32,598
(babble of voices)

933
01:21:37,367 --> 01:21:40,962
This has been Lydia Perl
with Channel 8 News.

934
01:21:49,807 --> 01:21:53,197
(Mrs Lisbon) None of my daughters
lacked for any love.

935
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:57,280
There was plenty of love in our house.

936
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,242
l never understood why...

937
01:22:31,887 --> 01:22:37,280
After the suicide free-for-all the Lisbons
gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.

938
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:42,121
They had Mr Hedlie pack up the house,...

939
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,244
..selling what furniture he could
in a garage sale.

940
01:22:47,487 --> 01:22:49,876
Mr Lisbon put the house on the market...

941
01:22:49,967 --> 01:22:52,765
..and it was sold to
a young couple from Boston.

942
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:57,201
We, of course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.

943
01:22:57,287 --> 01:22:58,845
(clock ticking)

944
01:23:00,127 --> 01:23:04,837
We had pieces of the puzzle, but however
we put them together, gaps remained -

945
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:09,156
..oddly shaped emptiness,
mapped by what surrounded them...

946
01:23:09,247 --> 01:23:11,477
..like countries we couldn't name.

947
01:23:14,727 --> 01:23:21,075
What lingered after them was not life,
but the most trivial list of mundane facts.:

948
01:23:24,127 --> 01:23:26,197
..a clock ticking on the wall,...

949
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:29,562
..a room dim at noon,...

950
01:23:30,647 --> 01:23:35,038
..the outrageousness of a human being
thinking only of herself.

951
01:23:39,527 --> 01:23:43,122
We began the impossible process
of trying to forget them.

952
01:23:49,527 --> 01:23:52,678
Our parents seemed
better able to do this,...

953
01:23:52,767 --> 01:23:55,884
..returning to their tennis foursomes
and cocktail cruises...

954
01:23:55,967 --> 01:23:59,004
..as though they'd seen this all before.

955
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:04,601
lt was full-fledged summer again, over
a year since Cecilia had slit her wrists,...

956
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:07,155
..spreading the poison in the air.

957
01:24:07,247 --> 01:24:10,319
A spill at the plant
increased the phosphates in the lake...

958
01:24:10,407 --> 01:24:14,525
..and produced a scum of algae so thick
that the swamp smell filled the air,...

959
01:24:14,607 --> 01:24:17,041
..infiltrating the genteel mansions.

960
01:24:18,007 --> 01:24:21,682
Debutantes cried over the misfortune
of coming out in a season...

961
01:24:21,767 --> 01:24:24,600
..everyone would remember
for its bad smell.

962
01:24:24,687 --> 01:24:28,600
The O'Conners, however,
came up with the ingenious solution...

963
01:24:28,687 --> 01:24:32,760
..of making the theme of their daughter
Alice's debutante party ''Asphyxiation''.

964
01:24:32,847 --> 01:24:36,635
Like everyone else,
we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.

965
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:39,882
(woman) She'll give him a heart attack!

966
01:24:46,607 --> 01:24:48,598
(muffled voices)

967
01:25:08,207 --> 01:25:10,198
(muffled voices)

968
01:25:23,127 --> 01:25:25,118
Hi, Parkie.

969
01:25:25,647 --> 01:25:27,444
(vomits)

970
01:25:29,287 --> 01:25:31,676
Al's got the acting bug, you know.

971
01:25:33,247 --> 01:25:35,442
- She caught it from Pinkie.
- (laughter)

972
01:25:36,567 --> 01:25:39,639
And l want to announce tonight
that next fall...

973
01:25:39,727 --> 01:25:42,924
..Alice is going to
a little school in New Haven(!)

974
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:45,525
(laughter)

975
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:48,724
l hear they have
a great drama school out there.

976
01:25:48,807 --> 01:25:52,846
- ln fact, Sam, didn't your father build it?
- That's the law school.

977
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:58,122
We're so proud of Alice.
We really couldn't be prouder.

978
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,478
(all toast)

979
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:08,077
l've had it.

980
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:10,283
Goodbye, cruel world.

981
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:18,760
No, no, no, you don't understand me!

982
01:26:18,847 --> 01:26:21,236
l'm a teenager. l got problems!

983
01:26:22,007 --> 01:26:23,998
(laughter)

984
01:26:31,407 --> 01:26:34,205
So much has been said
about the girls over the years.

985
01:26:36,887 --> 01:26:39,276
But we have never found an answer.

986
01:26:41,887 --> 01:26:44,959
lt didn't matter in the end
how old they had been,...

987
01:26:46,487 --> 01:26:48,478
..or that they were girls.

988
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:53,520
But only that we had loved them,...

989
01:26:53,607 --> 01:26:55,996
..and that they hadn't heard us calling,...

990
01:26:56,087 --> 01:27:00,046
..still do not hear us calling them
out of those rooms...

991
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:02,960
..where they went to be alone
for all time,...

992
01:27:04,327 --> 01:27:08,525
..and where we will never find the pieces
to put them back together.

993
01:27:23,887 --> 01:27:25,878
