Does Crazy Cora belong to you?

37
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,700
Didn't say that. I said
she don't wanna get in your wagon.

38
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,122
The boss says we can
take some white tarts back,

'cause we're sick of black ladies.

40

So you just tell Cora to come quiet, and
we'll feed her regular and everything.

00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,224
Usual barrel length's 30 inches.
This one has an extra four.

176
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:26,020
It's converted to use a special
.45-caliber, 110-grain metal cartridge

177
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,731
with a 540-grain paper-patched bullet.

178
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,860
It's fitted with double set triggers
and a vernier sight.

179
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,742
It's marked up to 1200 yards.
This one shoots a mite further.

180
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,874
An experimental weapon
with experimental ammunition.

181
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,669
You could call it that.

182
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,672
Let's experiment.

183
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,053
Whitey, take that bucket
and ride out until I signal.

184
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,440
Tell me when you want him to stop.

185
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,164
[Sheep bleating]

186
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,333
Your man able to hit
something that far away?

187
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:36,591
I don't know him.
I never saw him before.

188
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,217
[Men chatting indistinctly]

189
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,845
He'd have to be a good shot all right.

190
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,644
'Bout there'll do.

191
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,773
[Men chuckling]

192
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,445
Bullshit.

193
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,219
[Horse whinnying]

194
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,397
[Squeaking]

195
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,420
[Rooster crowing]

196
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,472
Are you quite certain, Mr. Quigley,

197
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,102
that you wouldn't like
the bucket a bit closer?

198
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,277
Jesus Christ!

199
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,028
[Men chuckling and chattering]

200
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,197
Quite certain.

201
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:31,539
[Gun cocking]

202
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,628
[Man yelling]

203
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,341
Told you. Only my Roy could
hit a coyote from that distance.

204
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,514
[Blowing]

205
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,314
Very impressive. You're hired.

206
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,983
[Gate opening]

207
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,073
Would you excuse me for a minute?

208
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,409
There's some business
I have to attend to.

209
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,787
You might find this interesting.

210
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,123
Nice shootin', Roy.

211
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,626
Mr. Marston?

212
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,007
I think there's been a mistake.
The one they call Crazy Cora.

213
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:24,925
[Growling]

214
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,011
I'd appreciate it
if your men leave her alone

215
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,931
- till you and I have a chance to talk.
- Whatever you want.

216
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,184
[Men chattering]

217
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,150
You are deserters from
Her Majesty's armed forces.

218
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,778
The penalty for your crime is death.

219
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,697
You were caught on my land.
I could have you shot for trespassing.

220
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,493
Look, you let us stay here,
guv'nor, we'll serve you proper.

221
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,121
Better than this
convict scum you've got.

222
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,459
Well, unfortunately, your commanding
officer Major Ashley-Pitt and I

223
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,420
have an understanding,
and so, I'm afraid,

224
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,964
you'll be sent back
to face the firing party.

225
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:08,302
But I see no reason why you
should be trussed up like animals.

226
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,013
Mr. Dobkin.

227
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,501
[Grunting]

228
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,232
This is my preferred weapon,
Mr. Quigley.

229
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,194
Do join me for dinner.

230
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,208
You've got to admit, the Yank's
a damn good shot with a long rifle.

231
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,461
Oh, sure. But you give me
a weapon like that,

232
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,713
and I could beat him with my eyes shut.

233
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,550
Easy to say, O'Flynn.
You've got a lot to learn.

234
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,262
I ain't got a lot to learn. Look at you,
Dobkin. You've been here 12 years,

235
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,806
and all you've got to show for it
is cold mutton.

236
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,808
He's in, getting a fancy dinner.

237
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,810
Huh?

238
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,356
You were actually in Dodge City?

239
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,402
William Hickok must have been there.

240
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,364
Spent a night there once.
I was pretty tired.

241
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:56,076
Dodge City's a nice place
to get some sleep.

242
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,626
Are you familiar with
the army revolver, Mr. Quigley?

243
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,423
Well, sir, I never had much use for one.

244
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,719
It's a recent invention of
your countryman, Colonel Colt.

245
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:20,100
God created all men. They say
Sam Colt made 'em equal. More or less.

246
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:27,274
That's what I like about you Americans.
You're people of action, not words.

247
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:31,070
That mint jelly on your lamb.

248
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,031
It's my own creation.

249
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,577
No, I'm a student of your American West.
I've read a great deal about it.

250
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,748
Tell me about dingoes.

251
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,128
Ten pounds a month
for shooting wild dogs

252
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,130
seems like a whole lot for not much.

253
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,134
Besides, you got enough men
and guns outside

254
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,179
to kill every dingo
within ten miles of here.

255
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,766
Unless you're talking about deserters.

256
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,022
Did you know that your American Indian

257
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,651
is a race that has no word for "wheel."

258
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,740
No concept of farming.
No understanding of land ownership.

259
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,827
Is that a fact?

260
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:26,333
From what I hear, you found a solution
to that problem in your country.

261
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,838
I guess that depends on
whether you're an Indian or not.

262
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:39,972
You see, in many ways...
our two nations are quite similar.

263
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:45,269
We both brought civilization
to the Stone Age.

264
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:53,152
Unfortunately, in this country
we have failed in one regard.

265
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:58,157
We have been unable to domesticate
the most backward people in the world...

266
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,909
...the Australian Aborigine.

267
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,496
Don't mind him. He's harmless.

268
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,707
[Aborigine voices chanting]

269
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,382
My parents were slaughtered
by Aborigines, Mr. Quigley.

270
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:21,430
They attacked so fast my mother
was found dead still holding her sewing.

271
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,684
Nowadays they butcher
our sheep and cattle.

272
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,395
Her Majesty's government
allows the local settlers

273
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,481
to deal with the matter their own way.

274
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:36,904
It's official policy.
It's called "pacification by force."

275
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,909
But the real issue...

276
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,246
...is that, primitive as they are,

277
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,668
the Aborigines have learned
to keep out of rifle range.

278
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,842
Which brings us to you... Mr. Quigley.

279
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,598
What the hell?

280
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,433
[Dog barking]

281
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,147
No! Stay right where you are.

282
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,941
[Breathing heavily]

283
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,111
No man knocks me out of my own house.

284
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,744
[Punch thrown]

285
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,585
Don't just stand there. Get him.

286
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,636
- Has he got the rifle with him?
- He keeps it right beside him.

287
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,180
I said, get him!

288
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,619
He's just sitting in there
with that big gun.

289
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,642
Keep down. Kelly, up there.
Carver, take the side.

290
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,689
Brophy, around the back.

291
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:43,322
[Grunting]

292
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,075
Fancy American shooter.

293
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,914
Eating real fancy, eh?

294
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:03,884
[Grunting]

295
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,596
Go on, kick him in the back! Give it
to him in the back. Go on, that's it.

296
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,643
Leave Roy alone!

297
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,145
Get her off me!

298
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,313
[Muffled yelling]

299
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:22,986
[Men laughing]

300
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,954
Throw him in the wagon. Haul him
two days from here and dump him.

301
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,999
Let Australia kill him.

302
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,711
And that crazy woman, too.

303
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,922
[Men chattering indistinctly]

304
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,546
[Horse nickering]

305
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,683
[Groaning]

306
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,940
[Grunting and sighing]

307
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,715
[Quigley] You forgot the gold.

308
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,010
What did he say?

309
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:14,514
- [Quigley] You forgot the gold.
- Marston.

310
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,935
He paid him in gold.

311
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,603
[Muttering]

312
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,771
He's right.

313
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,779
[Grunting]

314
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,545
Leave us some water
and you can have the gold.

315
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,258
- I can have the gold anyway.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

316
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,392
[Grunting]

317
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,728
[Driver] Yah!

318
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,691
Yah!

319
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,704
[Grunting]

320
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,588
Go on!

321
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,060
Come on! Yah!

322
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,796
Yah!

323
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,596
[Grunting]

324
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,656
[Cara groaning]

325
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,874
I wish people would quit
hitting me on the head.

326
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,584
Don't worry.

327
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,296
On a new job, it's quite common
for things not to go well at first.

328
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,636
[Chuckling]

329
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,681
[Laughing]

330
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,998
- We should...
- What?

331
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,421
I remember, my granddaddy told me
how, when you're lost in the desert,

332
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,883
you should sleep during the day
and walk at night.

333
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,427
Your granddaddy tell you that?

334
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:43,598
He also tell you we'll die in the desert
without those horses?

335
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,561
What good are horses if we die first?

336
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,315
Once in a while she actually
makes a little sense.

337
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,863
- What did you say, Roy?
- Never mind.

338
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,951
[Crickets chirping]

339
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,309
[Groaning]

340
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,314
[Fly buzzing]

341
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,519
[Grunting]

[Dogs barking]

344
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,182
Good morning, Major.

345
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,225
Marston.

346
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,148
What can I get for you?
Some refreshment?

347
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,983
That's very kind, sir.

348
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:27,530
I'd be obliged if you would

353
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:52,889
Two men. One has been stabbed
and one shot through the head.

354

Coogan and Miller.

355
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,981
It would appear that the man
and the woman are still missing.

412
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,258
Roy was hunting sage hens
when the Comanches came.

413
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:32,014
I grabbed the baby and a pistol,
and I hid in the root cellar out back.

414

The Indians tore up our sod house.

415

but then the baby started crying.

I tried to shush him and suckle him,
but he just wouldn't stop.

real drunk and wore my green apron.

He must have heard something.
He started hollering and coming closer.

419

over my baby's mouth.

hurt anybody, and rode away.

still afraid to come out of the cellar.

when he saw I'd smothered our son.

put me in the wagon,

428

to Galveston without stopping.

It was headed to Australia.

431

"Don't want no woman that would
kill my son to save herself."

433

01:42:41,613 --> 01:42:42,697
[Grunting]

877
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:47,618
Well, well, well.

878
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:54,041
Mr. Quigley...
good of you to drop in again.

879
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:57,920
[Quigley saying nothing]

880
01:42:58,088 --> 01:43:01,007
What? Nothing clever to say?

881
01:43:05,929 --> 01:43:07,388
The great Quigley.

882
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:10,892
This is what you were all afraid of.

883
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:15,104
Bring him over here and stand him up.

884
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:19,066
[Grunting]

885
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:27,116
Stand up.

886
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:30,703
Cut him loose.

887
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:46,344
Now put his rifle...
on the ground in front of him.

888
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:57,939
No.

889
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:01,692
Throw it away.

890
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:08,824
O'Flynn, go and get my second revolver.

891
01:44:10,994 --> 01:44:14,163
I know how much you'd like to have
your rifle with you, at this moment,

892
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:17,750
but I think you'll find that
I've got a much better idea.

893
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:24,257
Stick it in his belt. Go on!

894
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:35,142
I seem to remember you're not too
familiar with Colonel Colt's revolver,

895
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:38,437
so this will be your first lesson.

896
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:43,859
Don't worry. Mr. Dobkin and Mr. O'Flynn
will ensure that it's a fair contest.

897
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:53,828
I'll just back up a few paces.

898
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:00,501
And to your left a bit. That's it.

899
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:03,963
Now you're right in front
of my old pistol target.

900
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:11,804
Some men are born in the wrong century.

901
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:17,768
I think I was born
on the wrong continent.

902
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:19,437
[Chuckling]

903
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:23,357
Oh, by the way, you're fired.

904
01:45:41,209 --> 01:45:43,336
This ain't Dodge City.

905
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,589
And you ain't Bill Hickok.

906
01:46:15,285 --> 01:46:16,994
[Gasping for breath]

907
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:29,090
[Sputtering]

908
01:46:34,763 --> 01:46:37,264
I said I never had much use for one.

909
01:46:37,432 --> 01:46:39,308
Never said I didn't know how to use it.

910
01:46:40,602 --> 01:46:42,478
[Chuckling]

911
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:50,277
[Exhaling]

912
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:58,119
[Footsteps approaching]

913
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:22,578
[Exhaling]

914
01:49:56,047 --> 01:49:58,173
Somewhat the worse for wear...

915
01:49:59,634 --> 01:50:01,719
This appears to be Quigley.

916
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:06,056
I think you have a lot to explain, sir.

917
01:50:06,224 --> 01:50:09,226
Not that it will do you
any good. Sergeant.

918
01:50:11,354 --> 01:50:15,149
In pursuance of a warrant,
duly attested by a justice of the peace,

919
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:20,362
you are hereby charged with numerous
and serious crimes, including murder...

920
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:24,408
In short, this paperwork says...

921
01:50:25,785 --> 01:50:27,161
...that we can hang you.

922
01:50:28,997 --> 01:50:31,040
I ain't gonna swing on no gallows.

923
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:34,543
Well.

924
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:39,673
You can always be shot...
on the way to your trial.

925
01:50:39,841 --> 01:50:42,551
While trying to escape, of course.

926
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:45,387
Or you can die right here,

927
01:50:45,555 --> 01:50:48,140
bearing arms against the army
of Her Majesty the Queen.

928
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:52,019
The decision...

929
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:55,731
[Aborigine voices chanting]

930
01:50:58,193 --> 01:50:59,860
[Wind blowing]

931
01:51:19,255 --> 01:51:20,547
[Chanting]

932
01:52:10,306 --> 01:52:12,224
[Clearing throat]

933
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:52,264
[Chanting]

934
01:53:29,761 --> 01:53:30,969
[Grunting]

935
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:02,876
[Overlapping chattering]

936
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:07,047
All right, come on!

937
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:15,389
- When's the next boat leaving?
- For Europe or the Americas?

938
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:18,642
America.

939
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:23,188
Let's see here.

940
01:54:23,356 --> 01:54:28,360
I've got one leaving
this afternoon for San Francisco.

941
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,572
Mm-hmm.

942
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:33,699
Your name, sir?

943
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:52,551
Name?

944
01:54:55,013 --> 01:54:56,096
Roy.

945
01:54:58,725 --> 01:54:59,725
Roy Cobb.

946
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:10,736
How many?

947
01:55:12,322 --> 01:55:13,447
Two.

948
01:55:21,831 --> 01:55:24,082
I got something I wanna say to you.

949
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:27,628
I got a couple of things
I wanna say to you, too.

950
01:55:27,795 --> 01:55:32,507
Remember, once, you told me before you'd
make love to me I had to say two words?

951
01:55:32,675 --> 01:55:34,760
What's that?

952
01:55:35,678 --> 01:55:37,471
Matthew Quigley.

953
01:55:59,684 --> 01:56:03,438
