Excuse me.

00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:11,585
Mr. Toole.
Gentlemen.

7
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,088
Mr. Durant is currently seeking
medical treatment in Chicago.

8
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,245
So you don't really know.

9
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,845
No. I've not had word yet.

10
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,014
What if he dies?
Where's that leave us?

11
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,266
Well, if...

12
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,176
I heard he was already dead
when his train pulled out.

13
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:30,741
Look, work will not be interrupted.

14
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,397
Progress will continue.

15
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,065
Can we count on the wages?

16
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:37,819
Yes. Yes. You'll all be
paid on time and in full.

17
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,415
And how will you pay us
if the old man dies?

18
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,989
Mr. Toole...
All due respect, Ma'am,

19
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,449
but you don't have
that kind of power.

20
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,076
Y'all shut up and get back to work.

21
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,996
Mr. Toole, get these men
out to the depot.

No one else did.

38
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,480
My father was very fond of you.

39
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:07,483
He said you and he
were kindred spirits.

40
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,973

And you didn't kill
your friend, the doctor.

supposed to be redeemable.

beyond redemption.

it's any of your concern.

I have a sense of charity,

110

partners, Sean, you and me.

Got me a plan
that will make him sell.

124
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,896
And what will you be wanting
in return for your help?

125
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:54,279
Nothing.
I don't want nothing.

know what I mean? [Laughs]

going to make her mine,

man back then, fellas.

around, you understand...

Yeah.

Good. Then shut up, keep
your eye on them hills.

Work and talk at the same time.

147
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,512
Apparently, you can't,
'cause you ain't doing it.

So you keep your mouth shut and
do what you're paid to do.

I understand you real good.

to help them work.

a shit what you thought,

I'd give you a bottle and ask.

He ain't talking to me, is he?

169
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,103
I need to review your work. Please.

170
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:42,428
This right here?
This ain't right.

Ah. Is that a new rifle, Mr.
Bohannon?

172

It is.

he got it from, huh?

I don't know.

178
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:18,005
Perhaps you should have asked
him before you killed him.

180
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,051
Mmm.
Mr. Bohannon.

181

Maybe you need a drink tonight.

00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:00,693
Amen. Thirsty ain't a big enough word

189

for what I'm going to be.

190
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,332
How about a barrel?

191
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:05,735
That big enough for you?

192
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,535
Heh. What did you mean, barrel?

193
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,307
Might be able to help you find one.

194
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,503
Hmm.

195
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:13,905

See, now, I'm thinking...

200
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,532
It was the Sioux made you
cut that hair real close.

201
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,172
Are you one of the tribe now?

202
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,383
No, I cut my hair to
avoid those nasty lice,

203
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:47,324
Mr. Bohannon.

204
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:50,890
I do not fraternize with heathens.

205
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:57,814
I know it was you
that armed the Indians.

206
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,970
And you took a harmless
drunk, and you lit a fuse.

207
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:03,738
It's you that's responsible
for that massacre out there,

208
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:05,005
and you're going to confess to it.

209
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,674
It was wonderful, wasn't it.

210
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,181

to men like you and me.

We are very much alike, in that way.

223

but you just can't stop,

224
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:56,550
because death is coming
for all of us.

225
00:15:56,675 --> 00:16:00,556
And in that intimate moment,

226
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:06,086
when the person
who is dying is not me...

when you choked the life
out of Harper.

230
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:23,858
You set me up on that account.
That's on you.

No, no, no, no.

232
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:32,888
Mr. Bohannon, Harper was a
terrified, innocent man.

233
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:37,580
You must have felt some
doubt as to his guilt.

234

But that doubt...

236

wrapping 'round his throat.

237
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,203
Of course, you also executed your...

238
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:52,929
Your own good friend, the doctor.

239

head and blow his brains out,

and you agreed?

244
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,277

245

that certain thrill, Jah?

00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,127
Enjoyed it, even.

247
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:17,299
Right there, your desire to kill me,

248
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:21,874

can't afford to relocate.

your gesture of kindness.

Not yet.

Bohannon.

He's more valuable to me
than dangerous to you.
