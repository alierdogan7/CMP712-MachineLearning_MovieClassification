1
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:29,528
Winnetou, the great Chief of the Apaches,
has become a legend.

2
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:35,200
He has brought peace at last
to the mountains, planes and mazes...

3
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:41,206
of the vast land from Texas to New Mexico
and put a stop to the senseless bloodshed.

4
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,837
To keep peace among all men
is Winnetou's one dream.

5
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,091
But he knows that now, there is still
another scourge threatening it.

6
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,721
For bands of adventurers and desperados
have inevitably followed in the path

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,225
of the settlers, spreading fear
and terror in the defenseless young towns.

8
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:07,274
Gangs who lust for gold and who'll let no
man stand in the way of their getting it.

9
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,411
Help!

10
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,705
Help! Help!

11
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,710
Help!

12
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,462
Help! Help!

13
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,423
Help! No!

14
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:04,349
Help!

15
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,729
Winnetou!
- Are you alright?

16
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,740
Happy, the eagle
will always protect its nest.

17
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,705
Honest, I didn't want its eggs.
I spotted this.

18
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,584
Apanatschi is gonna like it.
- Yes.

19
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,341
If Winnetou hadn't heard your cries,
you would have missed her birthday.

20
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,427
Don't do it again. Come.

21
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,979
Apanatschi, how many times have I told you
not to shoot so near the house?

22
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,608
I don't care how old you are today.
- Oh, but father,

23
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,904
the woodcocks were just a few inches
above Winnetou's head. I couldn't miss.

24
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,658
It was such a beautiful shot.
- It really was a beautiful shot.

25
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:54,663
And your Father is very proud of you.
- Of course I am. I am also very proud...

26
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,832
that you came to see us.

27
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:02,087
Look at this. Do you like it?
It is for your 21st birthday, Apanatschi.

28
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,591
And may you have many more.
- Oh! It is just lovely!

29
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,845
Help me try it on, Mother.
- Alright.

30
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,142
And I was gonna buy her a pair of pants!

31
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,146
Now, Mac,
have look at your son. Happy!

32
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,316
Why are you looking so blamed innocent?
What's that you've got in your hand?

33
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,945
I was just looking at an old eagle's nest,
and I saw this.

34
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:32,200
Well, you look it. You'd better run along
now and get washed up. Hurry! Scat!

35
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,788
He'll soon be a man. You remember
that day I found a gold mine?

36
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,041
Yes, I do.
It was a long time ago.

37
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,713
And you didn't want anybody to know
until Apanatschi was grown up.

38
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,884
Now she is. I'll show her a surprise.
- Don't do it, Mac, don't.

39
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,179
The gold is yours.
Winnetou always felt...

40
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:57,017
you had a rightful claim to that gold,
married as you are, to an Apache.

41
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,104
Father! Winnetou! Apanatschi is dressed up
Like an Indian girl.

42
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,206
She looks really like an Apache.
- Yeah.

43
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:24,336
You sure look awful pretty.
- Didn't you say I had a surprise coming?

44
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,005
Oh yeah, your surprise!

45
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,017
Looks like we're being followed.

46
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,063
Now, I wonder who it is.
- I'll blow your head off!

47
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,776
Come out with your hands up!
- Don't shoot. It is me and Bozo.

48
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,404
Mama said I should get out of the house.

49
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:56,660
Did your Mother say to come up here
and crawl around like a hungry wolf? Eh?

50
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,288
He looks more like a wet kitten!
Don't send him back, father.

51
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,375
Ok. Come along.
- Gee, thanks!

52
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,169
Let's get going!

53
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:21,142
You better stay here now.
And don't you dare to follow us,

54
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,354
or you'll be skinned alive!
- Sure thing.

55
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,535
That rock's called
The Finger of Manitou.

56
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,332
Why are we here?

57
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,127
Come on, Apanatschi.

58
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,252
Here's the surprise
your father promised you.

59
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,432
Is it gold?
- Sure it's gold.

60
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,187
I don't understand. What does it mean?
- The mine is yours on your 21st birthday.

61
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,315
I want you to enjoy life
and be independent.

62
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,028
And you kept it secret? Does anyone else
know that the gold is here?

63
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,157
No, no one. Winnetou and l
wanted to keep it secret...

64
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,869
until now.
- From mother as well?

65
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,164
Nobody knows except you,
Winnetou and me.

66
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,295
Leave the gold where it is.

67
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,591
My sister has the heart of a true Apache.

68
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:21,846
She cannot be happy with gold.
It's only brought the Apaches hard luck.

69
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,267
Soon the White Man
would hear of this bonanza,

70
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,562
they would cut their way
right through here.

71
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,942
Apanatschi wants Jeff.
That's enough for her.

72
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,238
Apanatschi! Apanatschi!

73
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,493
Hello, Jeff. Happy to see you.
And the boys, too. I see you brought them.

74
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:47,664
Apanatschi rode out with her father,
but they will be back soon.

75
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,750
How are you?
- Just fine.

76
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,963
We take time off from work,
and the girl with the birthday beat it!

77
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,134
Come on, boys, it wasn't just Apanatschi
brought you two out here, eh?

78
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,762
I bet you just want a little whiskey.
- Well, they say...

79
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,559
the hopeful'd drink, huh?
- Come on, go in.

80
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,690
Halt! Here is where we part.

81
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,026
I must return to the village
of the Apaches.

82
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,073
The gold will make you rich, certainly.
I hope that it makes you happy.

83
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,702
Sometimes I'd like to visit
the Apaches in your village...

84
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:30,415
and go hunting with Winnetou.
- Apanatschi will always be welcome...

85
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,586
by the Apaches. And Winnetou
shall teach her how to shoot a raccoon...

86
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,881
and a brown bear.
- Can I do that, father?

87
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,551
I guess so.

88
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,180
Goodbye, Apanatschi.
- Goodbye, Winnetou. - Bye Winnetou!

89
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,269
You know, Mac, looking at your daughter,
I would take her for a white girl.

90
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,564
But her mother is an Indian.
- I am proud...

91
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,611
that my wife is an Apache.
- Now, don't forget you told Apanatschi...

92
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,114
she can come and visit us.
- Goodbye, Winnetou.

93
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,367
Let's go.

94
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,213
Happy birthday to you,

95
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,965
happy birthday to you,

96
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,593
happy birthday, Apanatschi,

97
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:27,222
happy birthday to you.
- I just shot a woodcock, Jeff!

98
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:31,935
It flew right over Winnetou's head.
- Yeah, that's alright. If you say...

99
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,105
you bagged a wild bird in flight,
I bet you did it with one bullet, too.

100
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,734
I did! Father saw it.
- If you're really that good a shot,

101
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,404
you'll take the crown away from Pinky.

102
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,033
I would never try to fool you about it!
You must believe it.

103
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,746
Just because today is your birthday,
I will. Alright? - Thank you, Jeff.

104
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,708
Happy birthday, Apanatschi.

105
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,631
Get ready for my old magic trick.

106
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,600
Oh! Isn't that fantastic? How did you know
I've wanted such a hat for a long time?

107
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,104
It is not exactly meant for...
- Oh, Jeff. l...

108
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,983
I think it is a mite small, don't you?

109
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,153
Apanatschi. You see? It's a muff.

110
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,239
Like that.

111
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,452
I knew all along what it was.
- What...

112
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,290
Hi, Jeff!

113
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:39,043
Hi there, Happy!
It is good to see a friendly face.

114
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,214
How is it going, partner?
- Did you bring me something?

115
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,758
You bet I did.

116
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,680
The world's greatest magician is here.
- Jeff!

117
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,851
Now watch it. A little magic.
You appear to have Happy amazed.

118
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,354
Oh, a chicken.
- Ok, Mac. You got it? Watch this.

119
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,607
Now...

120
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,611
There you are.

121
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,907
Now, friend, a third.

122
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,578
Here it is!

123
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,831
Pincky gave up his hat!

124
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:21,461
Now I have seen everything!
- He'll charge you rent for using his hat.

125
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:26,591
Remember what you have to do, Je¤
- Yep. I have to talk to your father.

126
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,094
I'm trapped, I guess.
- You're right.

127
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,057
Mr Haller?
- Yeah?

128
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,187
I'm gonna have to ask you to keep
to your word. You said we could marry...

129
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,482
when Apanatschi was 21.
- I see. Well, now.

130
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,861
If she wants to get married,
I guess I'll have to.

131
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,823
Oh! Father, thank you.
- Hug him, not me.

132
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,914
Is Happy snooping?
- He is.

133
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,345
Go on, sing along, Happy.

134
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,431
I just don't like to sing.

135
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:20,329
Apanatschi, more than 6 months
I was visited by 3 little brown bears.

136
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,958
And, believe it or not,
one of them washed my shirts.

137
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,671
That was a raccoon, not a brown bear.
- Hunter's jargon is hard to learn, yeah?

138
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,842
Or you area nature talent, Pinky.
- To say the truth, Pinky's running

139
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,471
as soon as a bear is coming near.
- Hey, I'll get mad, you...

140
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,308
Yeah, you get mad and off you go.
- Coward.

141
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,897
I'll show you who's a coward. Come on!
- You're always shooting just for fun.

142
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:50,068
No, we won't have a shooting.
Pinky passes out before we start.

143
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,529
You know,
I hate to leave the party, too.

144
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,123
How'd you get hold of this?
- Well, Pap and Winnetou set off....

145
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,294
an explosive. The stone blew all the way
to Alice Tanning, that's all.

146
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,589
Did you show it someone?
- Show a measly rock?

147
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,676
Bring us some more, Happy.
- Ok.

148
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,016
Well, what do you think?

149
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,521
Yep, it's gold, pure gold.
- And somewhere near there's a lot more.

150
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:31,818
You can be sure of that.
- We'll find out where.

151
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,155
Mac!

152
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,703
How come you never told us about this?
- Because it is my gold,

153
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,874
and I'd like to know where you got it.
- Happy said that you set off...

154
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,086
an explosion.
- Is it someplace nearby?

155
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,674
Well, Pinky, that's my business.
If I was gonna tell,

156
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,387
it'll be somebody that's close to me.
- You'd better go easy, boys.

157
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,598
Apanatschi, come on, pour us a drink.

158
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,728
You got no problem. As soon as you
marry her you get the mine,

159
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,357
and what do we get?
- You'll get rich. All I get is to go on

160
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,070
wearing traveler's clothes, I suppose.
- You better tell us where it is.

161
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,699
You understand?
- Don't forget that you're friends.

162
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:24,412
I'd rather give them half my gold
than have things this way, father.

163
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,583
That's ridiculous. There's no point.
It's ours, and it's gonna stay ours.

164
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,377
You'd better go.

165
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,424
No, Mac. I wouldn't want to have
to use this to make myself clear.

166
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,552
But if I have to, I will.

167
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,638
Get out!

168
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,604
Goodnight, Mac.

169
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,988
Well, it's too bad
they found out about it.

170
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,075
Now I hope they just forget it,
and soon...

171
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,206
No, Mac. Now those boys are smelling gold,
they won't be likely to forget it.

172
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,418
It's still Apanatschi's birthday present.
I'll ride in tomorrow and register...

173
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:16,631
the claim in her name.
I'll go tomorrow at dawn.

174
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,060
Hello, Mac.
- Good morning.

175
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,188
You boys are out hunting early.

176
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,816
Take us to that mine.
- I have a few little errands to do,

177
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,987
but when I get home we'll talk.
- Don't give me no trouble.

178
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:45,201
Sloan, I can see murder in your eyes,
and it's a frightening sight.

179
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:49,372
Looks like I got no choice.
Ok, boys, I'll lead you to the gold.

180
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,421
Will you saddle up mine? I've decided
to go out and shoot our dinner.

181
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,050
That's what you think. Just forget it!
- Hey! Just a minute!

182
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,805
Who you giving orders to?
- Listen. You know you are in danger.

183
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,226
Danger? Why?
- Nobody, but your Dad and you know...

184
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:15,898
where that mine is. Remember that.
Pinky and Sloan will stop at nothing.

185
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,784
Toss it over!
- What are you worried about, men?

186
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,080
That's not going to hurt anybody.
- Throw it over, Mac!

187
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,917
You miserable cowards!
- Toss it over, you!

188
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,462
Come on!

189
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,511
Jeff, that was father's rifle. I know!
- He must be in town by now.

190
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,724
That shot was not his.
- I know it is his, Jeff.

191
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,603
You shouldn't doubt me. I have gone out
hunting with father so often.

192
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:58,232
We have to go and see what is wrong!
- Apanatschi, listen...

193
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,778
I'll go alone and see,
and if I don't return in an hour

194
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,991
then you'd better go to Old Shatterhand.
He'll protect you.

195
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,870
I'll be back, though.
- Jeff, I will stay here.

196
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,374
No one will hurt me, you see.
No one told me about the gold.

197
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,003
Alright. See you.
- Jeff!

198
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,257
Where is your friend Old Shatterhand?
- At the railroader's camp.

199
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,468
In Rocky Town!

200
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,980
Pinky! Sloan! Get your hands up!

201
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,778
Alright, drop your guns.
Mac, quick! Get out of the way!

202
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,870
Mac!

203
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,836
Come on!

204
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,265
Why don't you shoot me?
- You ain't kicking the bucket so easily.

205
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,436
You're coming with us to see if you and
Apanatschi gonna show us to that gold.

206
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,648
And then you kill... both of us!

207
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:26,570
Save the bullet.
He's done for. Come on.

208
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,741
Jeff's been gone over an hour.
Maybe I should follow and see...

209
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,078
what happened.
Maybe he couldn't find dad.

210
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,290
You mustn't go, Apanatschi.
Ride to Old Shatterhand.

211
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,001
Watch yourself.
- Goodbye, Ma.

212
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,628
Alright, Mother.

213
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,589
Goodbye.

214
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,639
Where's Apanatschi?
- I don't know.

215
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,810
You are lying! Where'd the horses go?
- If you don't tell us, we'll kill you.

216
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,439
Apanatschi isn't safe here.
She won't return until someone...

217
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,067
has avenged her father.

218
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,738
Let's go. We'll find her.

219
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,888
It's alright. It's not bad.

220
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,685
Where's Apanatschi?
- Gone to Old Shatterhand,

221
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,188
as you told her to.

222
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,940
Good.

223
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,276
Mac....

224
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,908
Mac is dead.

225
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:57,263
Sloan and Pinky are chasing us!
- I can't go any faster!

226
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,777
Stop, you two! Stop!
- Run! Run!

227
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,407
Come here!

228
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,915
Hurry up!

229
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,926
Don't be afraid. I am Old Shatterhand.

230
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,221
You're really Old Shatterhand?
- Well, yes.

231
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:43,392
I'm Apanatschi. This is my brother,
Happy. My father is Mac Haller.

232
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:47,563
Jeff Brown sent us to you. We're engaged.
- My father located a lot of gold.

233
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:51,734
So, where's your father now?
- He gets our gold mine registered.

234
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,904
I'll get him and tell him where you are.
You go with Sam to the railway camp.

235
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,533
We'll see us later. Bye.
- Howdee, hunters. I am Sam Hawkens.

236
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:05,289
Jeff told us lots about you.
- If it wasn't all good he is a liar.

237
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:09,585
If it was flattery... Well, that ain't
gonna get him nowhere. Only, he's right.

238
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:29,104
That's some greed. - You should be glad
that they only shoot at coffins.

239
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,052
What'll it be, boys?
- We're buying for everyone at the bar.

240
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,317
Welcome to town.
And thanks for the drink.

241
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,697
What do you mean?
I don't remember inviting you.

242
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,078
A couple more red eye.
That was a good one. - Don't tell me

243
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,791
you haven't got money. You bought a round.
- That's because he just won at poker,

244
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,086
you see. But Mister,
don't think we're rich.

245
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,590
So, you won at poker?
How'd you like to get up a game?

246
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,595
He went broke though.
- Broke? It went fast.

247
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:49,017
And how the devil did you spend it?
- I warn you, boys, right now.

248
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,646
You'd better not be lying.
- Maybe you'd better look.

249
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,750
Alright.
Now, tell us where you found it.

250
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,546
Go on. Start talking.
- You'd better. Otherwise...

251
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,216
I'll have to shoot you boys up.
Now, start telling him. Tell him!

252
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,677
Come on.
- Music time!

253
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,161
Where's everyone going?
- Just step over here.

254
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,372
I'll tell you
why we're all pulling out.

255
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,585
There's a gang in town.
A bunch of criminals.

256
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,214
They'll ruin everything.
They shot our Sheriff yesterday.

257
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,720
Nobody in town's able to put a stop
to all this. So, we don't know...

258
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,349
where we're going, but we're going.
- How about the railroad camp?

259
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,852
You'll be safe there.
- Doc, you've got to stay.

260
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,648
You're needed here.
- I would stay, but tell me who needs me?

261
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,819
Since every one of my patients here
will be going, too.

262
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,906
Move over. I'm coming up.

263
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:30,160
Give them some more time, and they'll kill
each other off. You wait.

264
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,372
Now, look up Sam Hawkens.
He'll tell you what to do.

265
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,084
Well, pull out! Let's go.
- Will you keep your shirt on?

266
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:41,547
I must say! We've got enough coffins here.
- Let's hope we don't have to use them!

267
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,392
Come on, baby! Be nice.

268
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,312
Come here!

269
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,315
Come here, you little wild cat!

270
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,110
No! Let me go!

271
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,210
Alright. Tell me!
- I bought it from someone for 200 bucks.

272
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,881
Liar! Now tell me!
- We stole it from somebody!

273
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:29,177
It's true alright. We stole that gold.
- From whom and where did you steal it?

274
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,993
I know that fella.

275
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,371
Where's Miss Bessie?
- She's there.

276
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,766
Who is he?
- Some kind of scout.

277
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,228
You ought to get out of here, Miss Bessie.
- I am responsible for my girls.

278
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,857
I couldn't leave them here.
- I don't care what you say.

279
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:28,779
All of you are going.
- They'd kill us if we did.

280
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:34,493
They wouldn't let us go. The men here
don't like to be left without women.

281
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,456
I'll find a way to get you out of here.
- Thanks. Still, Curly Bill...

282
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,668
has brought 80of his men to town.

283
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,421
It's hopeless.
I don't see how we can get away.

284
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,801
Yeah. I hear they've been here
over a week now.

285
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:55,639
Well, I'm not quite sure what to do.
But I wouldn't be afraid.

286
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,810
We'll find some way to get rid of them.
- When you see Winnetou,

287
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,480
give him my regards.
You'd better watch out for yourself.

288
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,275
I'll do that, Miss Bessie.
Goodbye.

289
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,406
Now, you tell me where you got that gold,
or you're going to be getting...

290
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,576
a little drink that is gonna make you
anxious to tell everybody about it.

291
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,205
That's good. There.
Keep drinking, Mister. Open wide.

292
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,834
At a boy! Keep going.

293
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,965
I have a feeling I've seen you before.
- No, not me. You're wrong.

294
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,468
Look. He is my pal.
He's a bit drunk, that's all.

295
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,930
Rode over to town,
looking for some fun.

296
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,477
Why did you force him to drink whiskey?
- Where's your sense of humor?

297
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:46,106
Why were you following those kids?
I want a straight answer.

298
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,819
Apanatschi and Happy ran away.
Me and Pinky are friends of the family,

299
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:54,990
so Mac asked us to go after them.
- You tell Mac if he wants those kids,

300
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,285
he can talk to me.
I'm not giving them to you.

301
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:03,874
I'd be pleased to take care of them kids.
- With pleasure, Curly Bill.

302
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,502
But first, you'd better come with me.
One false move

303
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,049
and your boss is dead.
- Don't try anything.

304
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,343
Look out!

305
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,061
Give me the word, boss,
if you want me to get him.

306
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,899
I am beginning to see, now.
You were trying to find something out

307
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,527
from these kids. And I'll bet
you killed their father first.

308
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,156
He did it!
- Now, is that true?

309
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,826
Yeah, that's right.
- Let's go to the railroad camp.

310
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,121
That's the next move.
- Alright. Let's go!

311
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:11,650
Mac Haller is dead. I found him when I was
near the goldmine he gave to Apanatschi.

312
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,571
Where's Jeff Brown?
- He left to look for the murderers.

313
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:23,745
Curly Bill's got the murderer. I'm afraid
those kids won't be safe any place.

314
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:28,333
Winnetou will hide them with the Apaches.
But we must get started now,

315
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,919
to the railroad camp.
- We'd better hurry.

316
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,542
Sam Hawkens!
My pony's got to be shot.

317
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,296
The right foreleg.

318
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:20,468
Get her ready. Where'd you learn
to be so damn clever with horses?

319
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,763
I never learnt it.
I always liked horses.

320
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:28,810
Yeah, I always knew how to drink.
It just came natural. Yes, sir!

321
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,277
There! Look, that's her.
- And Happy, too.

322
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,448
We've got to get them both out.
- Go see if you can get them out.

323
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,452
Not in broad daylight.
- Coward! I'd like to kill you.

324
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,247
Come on.

325
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,045
Alright. Come and get it, boys.

326
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,677
You stay here and keep an eye
on what goes on after we leave.

327
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,431
Have them mount up!
- On your horses!

328
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,896
Come on!

329
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:23,114
In here the soup tastes good.
- Even out of water it's a fine soup.

330
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,984
We've got to case some dynamite up.

331
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,226
Help!
- Come on!

332
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,720
Hold it! Sloan, go see what's wrong
with your friend Pinky.

333
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,806
Hello, Pinky!

334
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,018
Looks like Pinky's hit the bottle.

335
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,439
Pinky, what's the matter?

336
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,943
Go on, get up, Pinky.

337
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,280
Well, Pinky ain't going to get up again.

338
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,327
That fat coward's dead alright.
- I know. He blabbed that I killed Mac.

339
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,538
But he was my oldest friend.
- I'll say.

340
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:40,668
Poor old Pinky. I'll miss him.
- Maybe we can fix it up for you.

341
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,471
Leave those two where they are,
for the vultures!

342
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:19,582
Now, listen here everybody.
Yesterday I sent you all here for safety.

343
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,211
And now, I hear
there was a daylight attack by Curly Bill.

344
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,549
Of course, nobody could have expected
that they dare such an attack.

345
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:31,761
And I tell you, they will come back
if you don't do anything.

346
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,850
I'm not telling you
to stay here safe from all harm.

347
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,311
Half your work is done.
Mac's killers are here.

348
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,315
I brought them with me.

349
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,986
They were my two best friends,
Shatterhand.

350
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,322
And they murdered Mac.
- Jeff, did you kill them?

351
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,951
No, I didn't. I think he was dead
when the others found him.

352
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:59,205
He was probably hit during the attack.
- By Sam Hawkens, if I'm not mistaken.

353
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,000
The judge?
- He killed Sloan.

354
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:05,128
Did my white friend see Apanatschi?
- Yes.

355
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:09,299
Then, tell me, why didn't you free her?
- Why where you taking a bath

356
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:13,470
instead of watching out for her?
- Oh, you know. Saturday's when I bathe.

357
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,098
But why they'd want Happy?
- Well, Happy's their hostage.

358
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,315
Men, look, do you want to stand this
any longer?

359
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,611
This band will be after you.
You have to defend yourself.

360
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,364
Or do you prefer to live in fear?

361
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:38,495
Do you want to be tyrannized by them
for the rest of your life?

362
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,789
That's why I tell you:
An eye for an eye!

363
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,836
We can't think of what to do that'd help.
- We'll do what you order.

364
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:51,007
Now with Old Shatterhand leading us,
it should be really easy.

365
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:55,178
The men are behind you. When do we move?
- Let's burn down the whole town

366
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:59,349
and smoke the devils out.
- No. Well, it's not all that simple.

367
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,977
First, we must save this boy and girl.
- Yeah, but how?

368
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,651
Does my brother wish me to do this?

369
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,113
No.
But I hope my red brother will help us.

370
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,244
Please go and see how Mac's wife is.

371
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,414
We're going to try and start
as fast as it's possible.

372
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,585
We've got to have weapons.
We can't do this with our bare hands.

373
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,966
Tell me just how many rifles there are.
- Anyone got a rifle he wants to use?

374
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,887
That's marvelous!
- You said it! When do we start?

375
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,516
We'll start tomorrow at dawn.

376
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:55,113
Dynamite can be a great help.
That is, if you know how to use it.

377
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:59,284
Except around here they don't know
what a fuse is. Isn't that right, Sam?

378
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:03,454
My brother, you mustn't worry.
You'll be taught... both of you.

379
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,666
Alright, Sam?
- What do I do now?

380
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:11,296
Nobody knows yet. I want you to ride
into town, make friends with Curly Bill.

381
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,466
Try to find out where he is hiding
Apanatschi and Happy. Now, be careful.

382
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:19,637
If you need help, see a friend of mine,
a woman. Just ask for Bessie.

383
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,724
Just tell her you know me.

384
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,979
You can count on me Shatterhand.
I'll leave right away. - Good.

385
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,274
Can he really be depended on,
or should I go?

386
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:36,321
I trust him. Sam, were you taking a bath
or weren't you, when you should

387
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:40,491
have been taking care of those kids?
- How many times do I have to explain?

388
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,660
It was Saturday.

389
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,207
So you won't tell us where your father
found that gold? Too bad.

390
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,337
That's a real pity.
- She's a pretty little thing.

391
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:56,591
Maybe until she's ready to talk,
we can keep her busy doing something else.

392
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,264
Cut it out, Judge! I said, cut it out!

393
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,895
I'll break her, yet.

394
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:13,691
Hank, listen. Go for some whiskey.
Judge, get the boy.

395
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:18,029
We're going to play a joke on your little
brother and pump him full of whiskey,

396
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:22,200
and he'll be a man after that.
That is, if he has any stomach.

397
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:25,828
I'll do whatever you say.
Please let my brother go, please.

398
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,999
I thought that would loosen your tongue.
- Where's the boss?

399
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:34,170
They're going to come here for those kids.
- Who's coming?

400
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:39,300
They're coming at dawn. The whole bunch.
- Oh? Well, let them come, then.

401
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,929
We'll give them a fine reception.
Go back to where they are.

402
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:48,685
And, you listen now.
They may have changed some of their plans.

403
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,855
You let me know, Jim. Judge!
- Here's your victim. Real tough!

404
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,150
Take them to the cellar
and lock them both up.

405
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:01,489
Why, those poor idiots are gonna try
to attack us tomorrow. Get down there!

406
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,992
Go on! Get back down there.
Go ahead. Go on. Move!

407
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,288
Check your weapons and then hit the hay.
I want you all

408
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,459
in good shape for the morning.
- And I warn you, no drinking.

409
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,212
Come on! Get down!

410
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:20,591
They probably think we killed the old man.
They'll fight as hard as they can,

411
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:25,304
but they're no match for us.
- Here, a lamp so the rats can find you.

412
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,315
Apanatschi, I am scared.

413
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,446
I am scared too, Happy.

414
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,616
Old Shatterhand and Winnetou
are going to come and help us out.

415
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:49,787
How can anybody find us?
- I don't know exactly, but they can.

416
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,998
Don't worry.

417
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,791
Apanatschi.

418
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:58,087
It isn't true what Curly Bill
said about our dad, is it?

419
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,924
I don't know what you mean.
What did he say?

420
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:06,971
That he was murdered and everything.
- They are just trying to frighten us.

421
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:10,808
Those men upstairs are wicked men.
Father couldn't be...

422
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,188
Don't cry, darling. Stop crying.

423
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,775
Do it for me.

424
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:38,336
Well, they couldn't have missed me.
They were too busy to notice anybody go.

425
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:42,340
Now, I better get going now and see
what they are up to. ¤ Be careful.

426
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,551
Don't worry over a thing.
- Good luck.

427
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,704
I want you to stop all this drinking.
That's all for tonight.

428
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,875
Tomorrow night we'll have something
plenty big to celebrate.

429
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:22,588
And remember one thing about tomorrow:
I give the order to fire.

430
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,759
Nobody move until I give the order.
You got that? Anyone shoots early,

431
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,388
he gets it in the belly.
- Can hardly wait until the morning.

432
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,225
You make it sound like a circus.
- Circus?

433
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:38,187
Did someone say circus?
- What is it, your business? Salesman?

434
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,816
You're mistaken. A magician.

435
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,298
Now another.

436
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,435
Now, let me have a drink.

437
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,442
You call that a trick?
- Just wait a minute,

438
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:28,279
and you'll have a nice surprise.
- Will you stop this nonsense!

439
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,633
Marvelous, friend!

440
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,470
Who are you?
- Now, well?

441
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:57,475
Jeff. And who are you?
- He's stupid. He doesn't know the boss.

442
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:01,646
That's Curly Bill. And all of us here
belong to the Curly Bill gang.

443
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,732
Ah! So you're Curly Bill.

444
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,486
Well, sir. Let me shake your hand.

445
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:18,371
That's pretty good, Boss.
Don't let this guy get away.

446
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:22,124
I'm gonna have a little shut-eye now.
Bye-bye.

447
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,252
Two whiskeys, please.

448
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,923
Shatterhand sent me.
Where are the prisoners?

449
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,094
Trapdoor behind me.
That's where they are.

450
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:37,473
Not for long.
- You quit flirting with the lady

451
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,227
or you'll be in trouble.

452
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,563
The drink's on him. Shake hands, Mister.

453
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:51,737
You and your crummy tricks! Why,
I'll break your hand if you do that again!

454
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,032
Only a joke, Mister.
- Let go! Let me go!

455
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,434
Get down.

456
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,146
Get down!

457
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,763
Dreaded fuse things.
They're as tangled as my beard.

458
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,560
Alright, men. One of the first problems
is to hold your position

459
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,480
and to stay at your posts.

460
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:14,111
Let's look for a message from Jeff.
- I don't like this. It is too quiet.

461
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:19,408
It could be a trap.
They could know we were here.

462
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,952
Let's go.

463
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,638
Hey! That's enough of that, Mister.

464
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:44,809
You'd better go, or somebody might just
put a bullet through your head.

465
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,353
Just staying a minute.

466
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,571
That's it! Come on!

467
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,912
What made you shoot him?
- I am really sorry,

468
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:10,000
but I thought he was a crook.
- They're attacking from the railroad!

469
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,545
Everyone ready. Get going!

470
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,280
Listen, give the key to me now.

471
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:46,871
Sam, is there anybody up that tower?
- I don't know. I'll go. I'm brave.

472
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,213
Curly Bill,
the town is completely surrounded.

473
00:52:56,548 --> 00:53:00,092
Come on and surrender,
or we will dynamite every building.

474
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,015
Curly Bill, think it over.

475
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,727
Come out with your hands up,
or you'll all be blown to bits.

476
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,491
I want to get you out.
Don't be afraid.

477
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:29,079
Winnetou and Old Shatterhand
are out there. Here! Quick! Come on!

478
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,583
Oh, I knew it!
- Take the lamp, you'll need it.

479
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:37,963
Keep going through the tunnel. It'll take
you out somewhere near the church.

480
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:42,218
You'd better hide in the bell tower.
I've got to stay here with my girls. Bye.

481
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:57,293
Church tower! Get them out of there!

482
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:05,009
Up there, he can wipe us out.
- Go, get me the children!

483
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:09,263
They won't shoot if they are here.
- Give me the key to the cellar.

484
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:13,517
I am busy. Just break it open!
- Those kids are stuck inside of here.

485
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,643
Hurry.

486
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:20,524
We are helpless as long as that guy's up
in the church tower. We can't shoot him.

487
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,623
Happy, come on!

488
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,335
Look out!

489
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:44,983
Winnetou!

490
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:53,158
You must get to the church.
I am gonna take you.

491
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,870
Hank!

492
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,835
Where's Mac with those kids?
- Been stitched up here to do this.

493
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,463
Hey, magician! Make yourself useful!
Get Hank up here.

494
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:11,718
They disappeared. - What do you mean?
Hank took them both and went.

495
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,304
But, how?
- What can we do about it?

496
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,599
They've got to be there!
- The place was safe.

497
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,604
But there is another way out.

498
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:27,359
Seems you have a tunnel behind the cellar.
I found it a few minutes ago.

499
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,988
What did you do there?
- Hank was a lot smarter than you.

500
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:35,784
He is probably safe now.
Because no one knows it exists.

501
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,413
We'll go and see for ourselves.
- Alright, let's have a look!

502
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,124
Take some dynamite.

503
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,840
How'd you ever escape, Apanatschi?
- I used the tunnel.

504
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:05,898
You see, Miss Bessie and Old Shatterhand
will be heartbroken.

505
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:09,735
So that's who she is.
- Can I help you shoot?

506
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:14,239
I think you'd better keep down.
You're a beautiful target.

507
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,954
Shatterhand, listen to me!
- What are you doing here?

508
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,125
Curly Bill and a bunch of his boys
are coming over. At about this time

509
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:29,296
they're in the middle of the tunnel.
- Winnetou knows where the tunnel ends.

510
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,925
Right over there.
- Good. The two kids are up there.

511
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,553
My thanks to you. Bye, now.

512
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,516
Listen, you look after him.

513
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,518
Go on.

514
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,490
We'll head for the cabin
when we get out of here.

515
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,372
Go on, now. Hurry.

516
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:13,715
We've got to dynamite our way out.
Give me a few sticks and I'll fix it.

517
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,219
You might really block it up.
- We can't move it.

518
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:23,016
We've got work to do. Come on!
- We'll be ok if we can get to the cabin.

519
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:33,193
Take cover behind the embankments.
Come with me, Sam.

520
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:38,240
All of you! Get behind the embankment.
Come on! Sam, over there.

521
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:50,377
Turn the back. Get behind the wall.
We want to take them by surprise!

522
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,723
Get ready to go.
Give me some of that dynamite.

523
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,979
I'm going to throw this out there.
And the minute it explodes,

524
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,190
you all run out of here, quick.

525
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,985
And takeoff on our horses.
- Right.

526
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,992
Get ready!

527
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,969
Dynamite! Stay low!

528
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:15,879
Does finding gold mean you must
die for it like my father, for one?

529
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,883
It is too great a sacrifice, Jeff.
Take me away.

530
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:24,721
Let's forget about the gold.
I never want to think about it again.

531
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,934
You have to now, Apanatschi.

532
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:31,687
Listen.

533
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:38,110
I warn you. Both your lives are in danger.
As long as you and Happy know...

534
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,738
where that gold is,
those men will stop at nothing.

535
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:47,035
Until we get rid of Curly Bill,
we'll never know a moment's peace.

536
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:52,374
Jeff, it will all be alright
as long as you love me.

537
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,467
Now we go to the camp of the Apaches.

538
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:06,096
Apanatschi and Happy
will be in good hands up there.

539
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:10,434
If you keep the promise you once made
that we go hunting,

540
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,604
I'll come with you.
- I promise that we'll take you.

541
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,650
And Happy. Come on.
- And Jeff?

542
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:23,488
Jeff will have to go back. He's got to
find out what Curly Bill's going to do.

543
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:27,117
They said something about a cabin
somewhere up the river.

544
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:32,372
Returning is too dangerous, isn't it?
- I left poor Hank in the cellar.

545
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:36,084
The key's in my shirt.
I'll free Hank.

546
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,672
He never knew it was me.
I'll just make up a story.

547
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:44,342
Curly Bill will believe me.
- Don't worry about Jeff.

548
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,012
He'll be alright. Come on, Happy.

549
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:55,645
Winnetou's taken the boy and girl
to the Apaches.

550
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,941
Which route are they riding?
- The shortest, I imagine.

551
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:04,654
Through a bear trail, he said.
- The Apaches will never see that old...

552
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:08,283
little spit-fire. You can bet on that.
- Better mount up.

553
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,079
What do you say? Aren't you coming?

554
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,208
With pleasure. Let's go!

555
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:24,925
Hurry it up! Get going! We've got
a head start on them. Now, move!

556
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:33,809
Wait!

557
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,414
This damn waiting.
- Might be...

558
01:03:57,041 --> 01:04:00,585
they went through already.
- You mean they're able to fly?

559
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:15,976
That's them.

560
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:21,273
There are no riders.
But those are their horses, alright.

561
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:26,403
Yes. That black one's Winnetou's.
Let's try to get all three.

562
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,156
That's just what he wants.
If he hears the gun fire,

563
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:34,327
he'll turn around and go right back.
Simple.

564
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,747
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!

565
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,088
I'll be darned!
- We've been tricked!

566
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:54,222
We're out of range now.
You can come up.

567
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:02,147
You certainly know how to ride.
Winnetou is proud of you.

568
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:22,083
This young warrior needs a bed.

569
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:28,006
This is Apanatschi.
Her mother is Mine-Yota.

570
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:33,470
I want you to protect her and her brother,
since now I must go away.

571
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:37,641
I must have been crazy to fall
for that trick and let them get away.

572
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:41,269
But I'm going out searching
until I find those kids again.

573
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:45,440
I'll find out where they got that gold.
- Morning, boys.

574
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:49,694
How about a little drink, Magician?
- Sure, boss. But why a little one?

575
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,949
There's a man who knows
how to take a drink. Sit down, Magician.

576
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,827
There's your bottle. Go ahead.
- That's my style!

577
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:04,376
Hold it! Where do you think you are going?
- Pouring a drink for a friend.

578
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,336
At a boy!

579
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,599
Let's go!

580
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:37,409
First thing is to get the boy, Judge.

581
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:38,618
Happy!

582
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:43,373
Happy! Where are you?

583
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,128
At the creek. I am fishing.
- She's pretty far away.

584
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,798
Get the boy now.
- Alright.

585
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,634
Go on. Grab him, Hank.

586
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,179
That gold, boss. Do we share?

587
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,350
It's no time for questions!

588
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:05,895
You boys will split with me, right?

589
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,652
I'll go and get them.

590
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,077
Where are you, Happy?

591
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,540
I'm right here.
- I can't! shut up!

592
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,669
Happy, will you answer me?
Where are you?

593
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,095
Happy!

594
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,771
Answer me, Happy.

595
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,983
Happy, where are you?
Why don't you answer?

596
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,155
Happy!

597
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,033
Hey, Happy.

598
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,465
Happy!
- Get him to the horses! Hurry!

599
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:20,553
Now. We pick up the girl.
- No. We've got the boy.

600
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:24,766
She'll come on her own, Boss, and will
tell us anything to get the boy back.

601
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:29,896
Hank, let's have a chat. What about
the share of the gold you are demanding?

602
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:33,733
That was just a joke.
- Curly Bill and me thought...

603
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:39,114
you might have meant it.
- Hey, don't be silly. I mean...

604
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:03,304
Jeff! Jeff!
- Hi, Happy.

605
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,975
Don't tell me you know the kid?
- That's Mr Haller's kid.

606
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:10,728
Take him into the house.

607
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,484
You'll be alright.

608
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:26,661
You know, Mr Magician,
I didn't trust you from the day we met.

609
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:31,291
Something always did bother me
about your face. It is honest.

610
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:35,545
Well, in a few minutes
I'm going to string you up.

611
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:39,257
The hanging tree is already waiting.
- I would like a smoke.

612
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,695
Stop him! Stop him, I say.

613
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:08,077
What good is that? The boy's enough.

614
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:14,709
Winnetou. Let me go with you.
I want to help.

615
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:18,963
You know that I can handle a gun.
After all, it is my brother.

616
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:22,050
You can't go, Apanatschi.

617
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:26,262
I would rather take you, as I promised,
to hunt bear, rather than murderers.

618
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:29,557
Well, I am not scared.
- I will ride alone...

619
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:34,604
and there is a reason.
Jeff would be angry if I took you along.

620
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:37,899
Is Jeff alright?
- We all hope so, Apanatschi.

621
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:42,153
When he's back we'll celebrate a wedding.
- What if they harmed Happy?

622
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,116
Don't worry. You would have heard
through Jeff. Tell Old Shatterhand...

623
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:51,371
that Curly Bill has captured Winnetou.
I will go to Curly Bill, unarmed.

624
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:57,001
You can't expect to get out alive
going without your rifle.

625
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:01,047
Old Shatterhand will know exactly
what I am doing.

626
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:04,550
It'll work, I am sure.
You must do as I've said.

627
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,719
Now come. You must hurry.

628
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:11,140
This is for my brother.
- Goodbye.

629
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:17,355
We're getting tired of these delays,
boy, come on. What is it?

630
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:23,194
Now, tell me where the mine is, boy,
or I'll kill you!

631
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:30,159
How am I supposed to think
when you are shooting at me?

632
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:37,375
Stop shooting! Winnetou will show you
where the gold is.

633
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:43,923
I don't want him to know where it is.
The gold's Apanatschi's.

634
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:48,428
They don't bother me.
- I know Happy. You are very brave,

635
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:53,558
and I am proud of you.
Apanatschi sent this to her brother.

636
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:56,269
Here it is.
- Thanks.

637
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:03,067
And now I am going to tell you
where the gold is.

638
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,861
Tie him up.

639
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:12,618
Get away!
You want to know where the gold is?

640
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,289
Jeff!

641
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:24,088
Did you see Happy at the cabin?
- Only for a minute, Apanatschi.

642
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,717
But when they knew we were friends
I had to escape. He won't be hurt.

643
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:31,888
You go back to camp, Jeff.
Apanatschi will tell you what happened.

644
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:35,391
I'll see you both later.
I have to go to Winnetou. - Good luck.

645
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:38,311
Come on.

646
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,932
Who are you, stranger?
You sure you belong in this camp?

647
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:20,645
I work on the railroads. So what?
- Just a minute. Wait! No offence, sir.

648
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:24,273
Sorry. Well, what do you know?
Jeff and Apanatschi.

649
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:28,486
Sam, you know who that is?
It is one of Curly Bill's gang.

650
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:33,282
Don't move! Keep them up!
Go on. Get in there.

651
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,410
Go ahead!

652
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:50,341
There's the gold that makes
white men lose their senses.

653
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:55,596
Now, you shall keep your word
and free Happy.

654
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:59,183
Take the brat with you. There he is.

655
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,714
You shouldn't have done it.
I wouldn't have let him go.

656
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:34,427
How do you think we can exploit the mine?
They say Apanatschi's name...

657
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:38,055
is as owner on the papers.
- We'll take what we can...

658
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:41,893
and go to Kansas City.
- Bill, that's idiotic.

659
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:46,397
We could have it all if we...
- If we had a certificate.

660
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,611
Sure.

661
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,867
And maybe for the kid
they'd fork it over.

662
01:14:57,951 --> 01:15:01,078
The mine will be ours.
- Let's go.

663
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:05,541
Get that boy back again.
Go ahead back to town.

664
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,169
Hurry!

665
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:24,435
Those men are following us.
Don't be afraid.

666
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,433
Thank you, my brother.

667
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:16,070
Don't overload the horses.
It is a long way to that tunnel.

668
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,783
Judge, I've changed my mind.
We're going to Kansas City after all.

669
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:24,370
I don't see no point.

670
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:28,541
I say we leave it to the men.

671
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,877
Everybody listen, now.
I want your opinions.

672
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,425
Do we take what we have
and go to Kansas City or not?

673
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,679
There's a lot more gold here.
Why should we go to Kansas City?

674
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,472
Put it away.

675
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:49,645
Get out!

676
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:11,375
I am the Boss now. Get back to work.

677
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:16,297
Men, Curly Bill's coming back to town.
We're going to get rid of him...

678
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:19,508
once and for all.
Now, here's the plan.

679
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:24,096
We're railroad workers,
and we ain't fighting bandits.

680
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:28,267
Why don't you get the soldiers?
- We haven't time for that.

681
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:31,937
Come on, now. Who'll volunteer?
- Right here!

682
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:35,441
Shatterhand, please take me.
I know I can help.

683
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,277
But, I could!

684
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:42,865
Take an example from this girl!
- Old Shatterhand, if you want to get...

685
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:47,078
into town, I'll be glad to ride you in.
- Thanks. Good idea.

686
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,957
Alright, men.
This time we get a ride with Jim.

687
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,390
Pull over, will you?

688
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:22,238
Now, distribute the dynamite
evenly all through the tunnel. Hurry up!

689
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:26,409
Cover the boxes with stones, so that
they don't know what we're going to do.

690
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:30,579
Sam, you and Apanatschi take this.
Put down the powder joining all the boxes.

691
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:34,750
Winnetou, come on outside with me.
I have to see the men out there.

692
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,921
That's right, get to work.
And let's hope you don't mess things up.

693
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:42,425
Apanatschi, bring me the powder.
- Here's the bag.

694
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,891
Come on, Sam, hurry!

695
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:56,397
Bring the boxes of dynamite inside.
Jeff will take care of them.

696
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:02,737
The best place to watch out for them
is up at the church tower, I think.

697
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:18,753
Hide your trail behind the church.
We don't want them to know...

698
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,839
anybody is here.
- Ok, Winnetou!

699
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:32,850
Put a trail right to the rear
of the church, up there. - Alright.

700
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:43,319
Watch the trail.
- Yeah.

701
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:01,295
Have to admit it, I guess. You're handling
the things real damn good.

702
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:06,008
I'm getting to like him.
- Let's go over this plan once more.

703
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:12,765
The bandits are gonna be here
before we know it. Now, listen carefully,

704
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:18,646
the tunnel runs right from the saloon,
under the square and to the cemetery.

705
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:22,525
We'll dynamite
while they're hiding the gold.

706
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:26,237
Don't fire until the first explosion.
Now, get into the houses.

707
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:30,157
I'll be stationed in the tower.
- Old Shatterhand! They're coming now!

708
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,041
Get going!

709
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,715
Alright. This is it. Wait for my signal.

710
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:25,045
I'm gonna get a drink.
- Shut up! Nobody will get any drink.

711
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:40,269
We have to get rid of the horses.
- Alright!

712
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:20,434
Look what I found. A box of dynamite!
Look. Look at it.

713
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:24,688
Here's a trail of powder! And the wire.
- Let's get out of here!

714
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,402
Let it go!

715
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:44,124
Come on. Let's get out of here!

716
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,382
Get out of here, come on!

717
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:07,398
Come on!

718
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:18,951
Go ahead!

719
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,847
To the other side! They are escaping.

720
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:06,637
I speak for the Apaches.
You are our friends. We are yours.

721
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:10,349
Put all this behind you.
Build a new town and a new life.

722
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:13,685
If you want the Apaches to help you,
then we shall.

723
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:17,606
Put your men to work tomorrow,
and we'll build a new town together.

724
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:24,196
I'd like to say, the gold
that has so far caused only pain to us...

725
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:30,452
I got the idea of making a gift of it
to my loyal friends.

726
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:34,289
I know that you can use it
to start your new town.

727
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:37,501
Komo tou lali tiko.
- Komo tou lali.

728
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,127
Komo tou lali.

729
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,695
Mother! Here we are.

730
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:15,122
Come, children.

731
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:48,905
If you like,
I'd be happy to stay a bit.

732
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,664
I haven't the words to thank you
for all you've done to help.

733
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:01,460
I wish you happiness. All of you.

734
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:06,131
When you need a best man, count on me.
- And don't forget this now.

735
01:29:06,215 --> 01:29:09,760
You know who is really great
at crooning lullabies.

736
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:13,013
Come on.
- Stay well.

737
01:29:13,973 --> 01:29:15,015
So long.
