What the hell was that?

4
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:56,449
Sounds like Colt just discovered
I used up all the hot water.

[video game sounds continue]

00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:27,749
Please, do that some more.

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,335
It's my new app.
Duck Hunter Ultra.

11
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:35,339
It's got weather conditions,
tracks migratory reports.

12
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,677
They even take pictures of the ducks
we shoot and log 'em for us.

13
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,970
And it's got recipes.

14
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:42,972
Hey, do we have tarragon?

15
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,142
We have salt.

16
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:50,354
Paper tells me everything I need.

17
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:53,024
Hunting season, opens tomorrow.

18
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,777
Sunrise, 7:12.

19
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,278
Bring gun.

20
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:00,573
I added that last part.

21
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,617
Yeah, but can your paper do this?

22
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,412
[quacking]

23
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,957
Hey, that's pretty good.
Can I see that?

24
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,668
No, you're gonna hurt it.

25
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:16,339
Yes, I am.

26
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:21,177
Dude, you used all the hot water.

27
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,888
I don't know, man. I just woke up,
took my normal shower.

28
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:25,681
I mean, I stayed in there a little longer

29
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,058
'cause it was hard
to wake up this morning.

30
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,392
Yeah, you know what'll
wake you up in the morning?

31
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,228
A freezing cold shower.

32
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,271
I ain't gonna find my dick till tomorrow.

33
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:39,362
Certainly can't help you with that one.
But...

34
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:42,531
...you know what wakes me up? [exhales]

35
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:44,325
A nice hot cup of coffee.
Oh, we're out, by the way.

36
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:45,618
[groans]

37
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:49,663
All right, Dad, will you tell Rooster
he's got to be more considerate?

38
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:51,499
There's three people living here now.

39
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,460
Dad, will you tell Colt
if he would like a warm shower,

40
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:56,337
he should wake up earlier in the morning.

41
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,922
Rooster, shut up.

42
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:00,800
Ha!

43
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:02,802
Colt, shut up.

44
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,890
We got a lot of work to do today,

45
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,183
if we're gonna take the day off
to go hunting tomorrow.

46
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:11,728
Oh, tomorrow's opening day?

47
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:14,022
Yep. Just like my birthday.

48
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:15,732
Only Dad knows when it is.

49
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,234
Sweet.

50
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:20,779
Yeah, I'm down to go huntin'.

51
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:24,073
Really? I didn't figure
you had any interest.

52
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:25,616
What? I love hunting.

53
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,995
You get to wake up at 6:00 a.m.
and start drinking, guilt-free.

54
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:32,498
Pee in the woods, always a bonus.

55
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,794
Poop in the woods, not so fun.

56
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,715
Yeah, I mean, fall's really
the best time of the year.

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,009
Got a little nip in the air.

58
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:47,180
You can wear your flannel shirts,
fleece-lined gloves, possibly a scarf.

59
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:52,268
We're talking about hunting,
not some fashion show.

60
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,228
[scoffs] Please,

61
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:57,523
like you didn't agonize
over that sweet denim-on-denim combo.

62
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,903
That's true and all, but, unfortunately,

63
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:04,488
the duck blind only holds two people.

64
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:07,575
One. Two. Sucks to be you.

65
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:13,164
Oh, come on, man,
I ain't been in 15 years.

66
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,624
Be nice to spend some
quality time with Dad.

67
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,252
Well, I was gonna say no, but

68
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:22,131
I can tell you really wanna go, so...
fuck, no.

69
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,972
Well, it's Dad's decision.
You don't talk for Dad.

70
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,182
Well, actually, I do.

71
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,351
See, that's the beauty
of not abandoning your family.

72
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,186
Dad and I are in sync.

73
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,272
I know what he's thinking,
I know what he's feeling.

74
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:41,567
If we were chicks, we'd be having
our periods at the same time.

75
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,616
Actually, Rooster, what do you say
I take Colt this year?

76
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:51,911
What? No, come on, man!
We're period pals.

77
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:56,499
It's the fair thing to do, girlfriend.

78
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,293
You can go the next day.

79
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:03,882
Next... [sighs]
the next day is not opening day.

80
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,799
The next day is not tradition.

81
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:09,470
The next day is not Beau and Rooster
sitting in the duck blind,

82
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:13,557
eating peanut butter and banana sandwiches
and killing majestic woodland creatures.

83
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:16,769
Look, Dad decided.
[clears throat]

84
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:18,187
And, for the record,

85
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:20,773
I'd have been okay
with whatever decision you made.

86
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:22,191
'Cause I love you, Daddy.

87
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:27,530
We're leaving at dawn.

88
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,657
Wear your prettiest scarf.

89
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:33,869
This sucks.

90
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,373
What's the matter?
That time of the month?

91
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,965
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, sweetie.

92
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:47,425
Hey, let me ask you something.

93
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,927
I'm your favorite son, right?

94
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,719
Definitely in the top two.

95
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:55,099
I'm not gonna pick between you and Colt.

96
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,268
Okay, I hear that.

97
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:01,189
So, let's say you got
two lawn mowers, right?

98
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:04,025
Now, the older one is more dependable.

99
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,902
It's there for you, year after year,
and it always gets the job done.

100
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:11,824
And it's got a badass nickname,
like, uh, Cutter.

101
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:16,870
Now, the other lawn mower,
it moved away and it didn't come back

102
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:20,666
until its professional football
lawn mowing career didn't work out.

103
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:23,962
Is this about hunting?

104
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,754
Damn straight it's about hunting.

105
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,177
And it's about R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
Colt better find out what it means to me.

106
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:35,639
I mean, he thinks just 'cause he wants
something, it's automatically his.

107
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:39,268
Yeah, I know what it's like
when people expect to be given things.

108
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:40,728
Here's your free beer.

109
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,857
Sarcasm noted and ignored.

110
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,944
I'm sorry, sweetheart, you're not wrong.

111
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,947
It's just, I think you should
cut him some slack, you know?

112
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,449
Your brother's missed out on a lot.

113
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,952
Yeah, he missed out on a lot of work.
A lot of work I had to do.

114
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:58,704
I had dreams, you know.
I wanted to open that body shop.

115
00:07:58,787 --> 00:07:59,788
I remember.

116
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:03,209
Rooster's Repairs.
No shirts, no shoes, no Chevys.

117
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:07,421
If I never open that place,
it should at least be a Toby Keith song.

118
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:11,717
Man, I gave up everything
so I could work the ranch.

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,512
You know what my reward was?
Going hunting with Dad.

120
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,804
'Cause that's our thing.

121
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:19,642
No, come on. You've had lots of things
over the last 15 years.

122
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:23,104
You've had ranching, hunting, bowling.

123
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:26,482
The only thing that Colt and your father
share is angry conversation.

124
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:30,153
Yeah, that's their thing.
I would never take that away from them.

125
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:34,657
You know,

126
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,868
there's someone else in the family
who really loves hunting.

127
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:40,871
I don't wanna go hunting with my mom.

128
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:44,333
Come on, it'll be fun. I'll make you
peanut butter and honey sandwiches.

129
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:47,003
Banana! It's peanut butter and banana!

130
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:49,755
Fine, peanut butter and banana.

131
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,800
Look, if you're not gonna
take this serious, don't even bother.

132
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,886
Are you in or not?

133
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,097
Yeah, I guess.

134
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:00,933
Listen up, everybody.

135
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,936
Rooster Bennett's going hunting
with his mommy.

136
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,272
[laughing]

137
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:09,650
What are you doing, Mom?
You're embarrassing me.

138
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,236
I know. That's our thing.

139
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,702
Why can't you just shower at night?

140
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:21,995
Not gonna do that, Colt,
and I'll tell you why.

141
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,665
I do not currently have a problem
getting enough hot water.

142
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,917
Why don't you shower at night?

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,502
Because I...

144
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,504
I have an issue.

145
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:33,549
It's your hair, ain't it?

146
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:37,053
If I go to sleep and it's damp,
I have zero volume in the morning.

147
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,515
All those years I wanted a little sister.
Here she is.

148
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:47,020
- Ma?
- Hey, Colt.

149
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:50,191
Are you wearing my scarf?

150
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,194
No. This one's Dad's.

151
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,947
Goes with his denim leisure suit.
[chuckles]

152
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,245
Is that my gun?
What are you doing here anyway?

153
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:03,496
Opening day.

154
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:05,081
Yeah. I'm going with Mom.

155
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:07,291
- [chuckles] Just like junior prom.
- [gun clicks]

156
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:11,462
She was not my date.
I just forgot my boutonniere, shithead.

157
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:15,633
Oh, yeah, I made him dance with me.
He was mortified.

158
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:16,884
That was awesome.

159
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:20,638
- Hey, where's my hat?
- What hat?

160
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,015
My favorite hat.
You know, my John Deere hat?

161
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:25,101
Paint stains?
Smells like a bait shop?

162
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:28,104
Yeah, I might have worn
that hat last night.

163
00:10:28,187 --> 00:10:30,689
What? You might have worn it
or you did wear it?

164
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:32,691
Okay, I guess I did.
I don't know.

165
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,193
Let's load the truck.

166
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:37,946
Really? You're not dying to find out
what happened to the hat?

167
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,910
I can't believe you lost my hat, man.
Where'd you go last night?

168
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,038
Oh, I went to my buddy Will's place.

169
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:47,706
Yeah, we were gonna
cruise around the local parks,

170
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,750
see if we could find
high school kids drinking.

171
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,085
Then pretend we're cops,
scare the crap out of them,

172
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,546
watch them run, and steal their beers.

173
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:56,965
It's pretty simple, really.

174
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,510
I mean, all you need is a flashlight
and a deep voice.

175
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,137
[in a deep voice]
What are you kids doing?

176
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,057
Yeah. I know how to steal beers
from teenagers, Colt.

177
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:07,393
Where's my hat?

178
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:11,480
Oh, yeah. Then we realized
we needed some new beer cozies,

179
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:13,316
so we went to the gas station,

180
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,776
found these sweet ones
with girls in bikinis on them.

181
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:19,112
When the cozy gets cold,
the bikinis disappear.

182
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:23,201
Don't worry,
we did not lose those. [chuckles]

183
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:26,412
But, here's the thing,
I know I still had the hat on

184
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:30,082
'cause Mark, the clerk, he said,
"Sweet hat. You wanna buy some meth?"

185
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:34,920
Then I politely declined.

186
00:11:36,214 --> 00:11:37,548
Then we got into Will's truck,

187
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:40,509
we went and found some kids,
roused them, and then...

188
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:44,137
I cracked my first beer,
then I had a few more.

189
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:45,556
Man, that's where it gets a little fuzzy.

190
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,560
I remember going through
a Dairy Queen drive-through.

191
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:52,230
It was me and Will
and his dog named Raccoon...

192
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,859
Although it might have been
an actual raccoon.

193
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:02,948
All I know is, he was real excited
about that chocolate dip cone.

194
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:07,995
What the hell is wrong with you?

195
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,289
That's a fair question.

196
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,877
- Here, you can just take my hat.
- I don't want your hat.

197
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,420
[muffled] Fine, just grab another hat.

198
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:18,506
Oh, okay. Well, which hat should I grab?

199
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:21,259
My DeWalt hat?
No. That's for fishing.

200
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:24,011
My Bass Pro Shops hat?
No. That's for church.

201
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,516
My "Free Mustache Rides" hat?
No. That's for the state fair.

202
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,685
Listen, this is kinda your fault.

203
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,063
If I'da just had a shower,
I wouldn't've needed a hat.

204
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,151
- You two still at it?
- We're leaving.

205
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:41,320
Well, I'm not going.
I'm not going without my hat.

206
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:42,530
Okay, bye.

207
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:50,871
My sister is such a bitch.

208
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,630
You know what that hat and I
have been through?

209
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,424
I can only imagine.

210
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,635
Learned how to drive in that hat.

211
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,388
I went to my homecoming in that hat.

212
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:10,974
I even lost my...
boyhood in that hat.

213
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,936
You left your hat on?

214
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,771
[sighs] It was a request.

215
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,899
That's how awesome that hat was.

216
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,150
It was basically a threesome.

217
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,612
Rooster Bennett, Debbie Pearson,
John Deere.

218
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:26,699
Well, I don't know
why you'd wanna cover up

219
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:28,701
that beautiful head of curly hair anyway.

220
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:31,119
Yeah, my hair does kick ass.

221
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,623
But that doesn't solve my Colt problem.

222
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,752
Guy comes back into town,
thinks about no one but himself.

223
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:39,920
Same old Colt.

224
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:42,297
All right, okay, I get it.

225
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:46,009
Colt can be selfish at times.
That's why I'm in this blind with you.

226
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,763
Your brother and your father
have a lot of problems.

227
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:50,889
[softly] Yeah.

228
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:52,391
But you and I?

229
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:54,727
We're perfect.

230
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:00,733
I know you're just saying that,
but it's kinda true.

231
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:06,238
And if it gets to be too much,
here's a good way to deal with anger.

232
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,036
What is that guy's problem?
I mean, it's just a hat.

233
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,956
If he cared so much about it,
why'd he put it on the community hat rack?

234
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,001
[scoffs] Well, I think he just wants
something to be pissed off at me about.

235
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:21,879
Yeah, they're working this way, Drake.

236
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,381
Making their way this...

237
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,215
Oh, the ducks. Yeah.

238
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,802
I mean, it's just... [stutters]
it's like, how's he the one who's upset?

239
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:30,471
I mean, there's three of us
living there now. Right?

240
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:33,641
We got to share things,
hot water and hats.

241
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:35,726
Hell, the other day
he took one of my beers,

242
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:36,852
you didn't see me complaining.

243
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:38,521
Those were my beers.

244
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:40,606
Exactly, we get it.

245
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,067
I'm sorry he's so annoying.

246
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,778
Yeah, thank you.

247
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:47,488
I was talking to the dog.

248
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:53,076
Look, don't let this hat thing
with your brother

249
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,287
ruin opening day, all right?

250
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,997
He's just messing with you.

251
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,458
Yeah, I wish that's what he was doing.

252
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:02,252
But that would require him actually
thinking about another human being.

253
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:06,339
[Colt] Hey, Rooster, I found your hat!

254
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:07,425
You did?

255
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,553
No! I'm too busy bonding with Dad!

256
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:16,892
Mom just told me you're actually adopted!

257
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:19,395
Come on.

258
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:21,063
Your brother really cares about you.

259
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:23,231
He just doesn't know how to show it
or say it all the time.

260
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,358
He's a lot like your father in that way.

261
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:26,485
[scoffs] Yeah?

262
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:29,112
Well, my father never
lost my threesome buddy.

263
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:33,366
Look, all I'm saying is
you have to be patient with him.

264
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:35,494
The bottom line is, he's family.

265
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:36,745
[sighs]

266
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:39,707
And more importantly,
it's just a fucking hat.

267
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:49,257
See... [grunts]
see, that's the problem.

268
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:51,594
Without the morning shower,
there's no life.

269
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:54,179
There's no bounce, there's no shine.

270
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:58,100
I mean, I know what you're gonna say,

271
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:00,894
"It looks fine,"
but I ain't shooting for fine.

272
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,397
You get it, silver fox.

273
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:09,111
And what do you use in your hair?
Mousse or pomade?

274
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:11,321
You got so much poof.
It's, like...

275
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,406
Where are you going?

276
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,494
See, this is why people
rarely give you compliments.

277
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,083
Oh, look at your coat, you're gorgeous.

278
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:26,962
Let's look at the big picture.

279
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:28,506
As difficult as Colt can be,

280
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,841
would you rather have your brother back
or your hat back?

281
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,134
Hat.

282
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:35,428
Get out.

283
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:36,889
What? Why?

284
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:38,932
'Cause I'm not sitting
with your brother anymore.

285
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:40,893
Well, I'm not sitting with him either.

286
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:43,311
Yes, you are.
You're the reason he's whining.

287
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:46,940
The reason he's whining
is 'cause he's a big baby.

288
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:48,275
I just wanna go home.

289
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:54,031
And the duck says...

290
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,783
[blows duck call]

291
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:01,872
And the dog says...

292
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,377
What's the matter, Drake,
cat got your tongue? [chuckles]

293
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:10,756
Oh...

294
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,050
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Dad sent me.

295
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,804
[clears throat] No. No, no, no, no.
This is me and Dad's day.

296
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,431
Well, I guess he just realized
how much he hates you.

297
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:20,808
Move over.

298
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:22,560
I ain't moving.

299
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,395
For once, you're gonna do something
you don't wanna do, now move over.

300
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,106
- Move me.
- Fine, I won't. I'll sit on you.

301
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,693
What are you... ah!
Come on, man, you're all soaking wet.

302
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,695
Yeah, it's mostly duck shit, too.

303
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:33,862
What are you...

304
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,656
- And I just farted on you.
- [grunts]

305
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:37,866
[sighs]

306
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,713
Did you eat my peanut butter
and banana sandwich?

307
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:51,839
No.

308
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:55,258
I took one bite and decided I was full
and I threw the rest out.

309
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,137
You know what?
Don't talk to me anymore.

310
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:00,931
Fine.

311
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,143
Oh, look what I found.

312
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,735
You know...

313
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,822
- maybe I should've brought Rooster along.
- [sighs]

314
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:18,949
He's right, it has become a tradition.

315
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:22,119
You know, Colt was
really excited to be with you.

316
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,121
Both your boys wanted
to spend time with you,

317
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,331
and I know you don't
want to hear this but...

318
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:28,917
it says something really nice about you.

319
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,878
Huh.

320
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:32,671
[imitating Beau] Huh.

321
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:36,216
Why can't boys be more like cows?

322
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:40,804
You could brand 'em,
stick 'em out in a field,

323
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,599
and they just stand there
until they're ready to die.

324
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:48,561
Beau? I never thought I'd say this.

325
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:50,147
You talk too much.

326
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:53,150
Sorry.

327
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:58,030
Hey, would you say I'm a silver fox?

328
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:03,326
Oh! Got 'em.

329
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,329
Drake, fetch.

330
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,876
Drake, fetch.

331
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:13,586
Drake, fetch.

332
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:19,342
Now even the dog likes you better?

333
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:21,386
Of course he does.

334
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:23,221
- Everyone likes me better. You know why?
- [sighs]

335
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:24,765
[whispering] 'Cause I'm better.

336
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:30,562
I know for a fact if it was Dad's hat,
you never would have touched it.

337
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:33,649
Oh, my God, shut up about the hat!

338
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:35,734
It's not just about the hat, man.

339
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:38,028
It's indicative of a larger
lack of concern!

340
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,863
- What?
- It's indicative

341
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:41,990
of a larger lack of concern!

342
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:46,995
I spent years earning everyone's respect.

343
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,790
Then you show up and all of a sudden
you're the favorite again? [scoffs]

344
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:50,874
How does that work?

345
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,335
You know why I'm the favorite?
I'll tell you why.

346
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:54,962
[whispering] 'Cause I'm better.

347
00:19:56,504 --> 00:19:58,048
You know what else you are?

348
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,967
[whispering] You're an asshole.

349
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,179
Fifteen years, Colt.

350
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:06,974
[sniffs] I had to shovel shit,

351
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:09,059
while you abandoned the family
so you could travel the world...

352
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,268
- Okay, all right.
- ...for 15 years...

353
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:12,520
Enough with
the "abandoned the family" crap.

354
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:15,107
I had a chance to be a pro athlete.

355
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,649
Who's not gonna take that?

356
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:19,069
I mean, you could have followed
your stupid dream.

357
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,113
"Rooster's Topless Tapas."

358
00:20:22,114 --> 00:20:24,116
- Dude, that was genius!
- [scoffs]

359
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:26,534
"Big tatas, small tapas."

360
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,831
It ain't my fault you hate your life.

361
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:33,333
[scoffs] No, man, I don't hate my life.

362
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,418
I just hate the fact you think
you can do whatever you want.

363
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,838
- It don't work like that.
- [stutters] I left!

364
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:39,506
- Okay? I left!
- Yeah!

365
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:41,508
Yeah! Well, guess what.

366
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:44,427
You gotta be a grown-ass man
and start taking responsibility

367
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,096
for your own life and your own choices.

368
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,766
You chose to stay!

369
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:52,477
You know what else I choose to do?

370
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,188
Oh, don't shoot my hat.

371
00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:56,356
Don't you shoot my hat.

372
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:02,029
You mess with the Rooster,
you get the beak!

373
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,701
To think there was a time
we never wanted those boys to grow up.

374
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:11,538
Well, we got our wish.
[chuckles]

375
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:14,374
[smacks lips]

376
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:17,920
Remember the first time
we took 'em hunting?

377
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:20,172
Oh, yeah.

378
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:23,258
Colt wanted to use the 12 gauge
like his big brother.

379
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,386
I told him it was too much for him,

380
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:28,513
but he needed to learn for himself.

381
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:30,723
Yeah, he learned all right.

382
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:32,725
Duck came in, Colt fired,

383
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,187
the recoil hit him in the face,
broke his nose.

384
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,190
[chuckles]
Blood was everywhere.

385
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:39,732
Rooster came running up,

386
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:44,321
"Dad! Colt's dying, Colt's dying.
Why are you laughing?"

387
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:49,659
Yeah, there's nothing funnier than
givin' a firearm to a 13-year-old

388
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,912
and letting him figure it out for himself.

389
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:55,665
Yeah. It was pretty stupid.

390
00:21:57,459 --> 00:21:58,460
You were right.

391
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:00,462
Wow.

392
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,383
All these years I thought
it would kill you if you said that.

393
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:07,344
- [Beau chuckles]
- And yet, here you are.

394
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,684
This is pretty nice.
We ought to hunt more often. [chuckles]

395
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:20,523
Yeah, we take our aggression
out on the birds instead of each other.

396
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:25,112
You know, we got an empty house.

397
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:27,948
I could think of another way
to take our aggressions out.

398
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:29,407
Let's go.

399
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:32,953
Ah! Ah! Ah!
No hair pulling!

400
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:34,079
No rules!

401
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:36,123
- Ah! Fine!
- [grunts] My nuts!

402
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,377
- [groaning and heavy exhaling]
- [car engine running]

403
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,795
- What's that?
- [car doors opening and closing]

404
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,047
Is that Mom and Dad?

405
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:45,924
Oh, great, they're leaving.

406
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:49,511
They hate you so much,
they left me behind.

407
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:52,764
[Colt] Thanks, Drake.

408
00:22:52,847 --> 00:22:54,641
Oh, congratulations,
you actually hit something today.

409
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:57,602
Yeah? That's not the only thing
I'm about to hit.

410
00:22:57,685 --> 00:22:58,937
[grunts]

411
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,816
[country music playing]

412
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:09,239
Mmm, this isn't the usual stuff, is it?

413
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,576
It's something I had put away
for a special occasion.

414
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:17,289
You're not getting soft
in your old age, are ya?

415
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,709
Don't get too excited.
You only get one glass.

416
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:27,632
I'm saving the rest in case we get
a surprise visit from John Elway.

417
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:34,389
This turned out to be
a pretty great opening day.

418
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:35,473
Yeah.

419
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,685
Maybe this ought to be the new tradition.

420
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:43,190
Send the boys hunting,
and we have the house all to ourselves.

421
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:45,150
[Colt] You're a fucking idiot!

422
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:50,905
Hell, I did my best.

423
00:23:51,823 --> 00:23:54,367
Left them both out
in the middle of nowhere with guns

424
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:55,953
and they still came back.

425
00:23:57,162 --> 00:23:58,830
[Rooster] You could have
walked around the puddle,

426
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:00,623
but you walked through it
just to splash me.

427
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:03,043
What difference does it make?
We're already soaking wet.

428
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:05,963
The difference is,
stop me if you've heard this before,

429
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:08,048
- it's indicative of a larger...
- Oh, my God!

430
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:11,301
Shut up! And suck my indicative.

431
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,013
Don't go in there with wet clothes.

432
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:17,390
We're not gonna strip.

433
00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:19,351
Then you're not going inside.

434
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,816
- I'm getting the first shower.
- Hell you are.

435
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:33,865
- You kidding me?
- What?

436
00:24:33,948 --> 00:24:35,533
Those are my fuckin' underwear.

437
00:24:40,622 --> 00:24:42,457
[country music playing]

438
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,296
[Rooster] Look who showed up.

439
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:51,383
Thought I was gonna do
all the work by myself.

440
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:54,344
You know, like the last 15 years.

441
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,431
Yeah. I went looking for your hat.

442
00:24:58,515 --> 00:24:59,557
Seriously?

443
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:03,978
I got Mark at the gas station
to show me the security footage.

444
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:06,814
I still had your hat on
while I was filling up the truck.

445
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:08,816
Was pretending the nozzle was my dick.

446
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:14,822
So I ran over to William's place,
and holy shit,

447
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:18,160
if his neighbor ain't out front
working on his bike wearing your hat.

448
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:19,744
- What?
- Yeah.

449
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:20,995
Big dude, right?

450
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,831
With tattoos, he had that chain
coming from his wallet.

451
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:25,708
Real badass, right?

452
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:29,962
So I look at the guy,
I says, "I want that hat."

453
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:31,589
And he says to me,

454
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:33,883
"You want this hat, you're gonna have
to come take it."

455
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:37,429
So I got right up in his face

456
00:25:37,512 --> 00:25:39,764
and I asked him
what the capital of Thailand was

457
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:42,975
and he said, "What?" and I said "Bangkok,"
then I kicked him in the nuts.

458
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:50,733
[chuckling] I grabbed your hat
and I ran like a little bitch.

459
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,320
Anyway, here.

460
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:57,282
Thanks, Colt. I appreciate this.

461
00:26:00,452 --> 00:26:03,955
Maybe that other stuff
wasn't all your fault.

462
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,709
It's possible I was almost an asshole.

463
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:13,090
Yeah. Almost.

464
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:18,303
- Just one thing though.
- Yeah?

465
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:19,679
This ain't my hat.

466
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:26,228
Are you serious?

467
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,479
[inhales through teeth]
Also...

468
00:26:28,105 --> 00:26:30,148
there's a giant guy on a Harley
coming down the driveway.

469
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:32,984
[motorcycle engine running]

470
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,160
Oh, come on, man!

471
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,371
[country music playing]
