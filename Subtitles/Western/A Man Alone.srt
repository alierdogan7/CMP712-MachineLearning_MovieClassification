1
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:22,788
Whoa, boy.

2
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,920
Go on, yah!

3
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:12,337
Giddup!

4
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:12,924
There you are -
three lovely ladies.

5
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:16,765
You sure fell into it tonightl
Beats me. Deal me out.

6
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:22,046
Quitting early, Henry? On a night
like this, you're better off here.

7
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:25,127
I can't afford it.
Business is bad lately.

8
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:29,395
Never thought about an undertaker
having business worries.

9
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:32,896
He's bound to get a soul
sooner or later!

10
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:35,666
You look as if
you might be next!

11
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,738
Play again?
- I'll sure try.

12
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,501
There you are, gentlemen.

13
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,287
Stage team -

14
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:59,064
they just come in.
Just the team, huh? No stage?

15
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:01,298
Si, senor. No stage.

16
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:25,104
Somebody there. I can’t make him out.

17
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,000
Leave it to me. I'll check into it.
Huh!

18
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:35,461
Well, I am acting sheriff now,
ain't I?

19
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:39,652
Sure, Jim.
We just don’t want you to get hurt.

20
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:42,877
But if it's only horses
you're investigating...

21
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:46,478
I can take care
of a darn sight more than horses!

22
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:45,578
Maybanks, Dorfman, Kincaid, go round
the post office. You, come with me.

23
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:06,912
I can't believe it.
How could you do it?

24
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:14,723
The woman snatched the scarf from
my face and they all recognised me.
We had to finish it. Oh!

25
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:18,423
Nobody meant it to go that far,
but it's done.

26
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:24,064
Where are your men? I sent them
back to the ranch, like you told me.

27
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,656
They won't talk - they know better.

28
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:31,399
I can't stand to think about it -
a little child and her mother!

29
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,409
The whole territory'll be down here.

30
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,109
Don't worry, Luke.
They'll figure Apaches did it.

31
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:41,594
Apaches take scalps.

32
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:45,318
You could go back and scalp 'em.

33
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:52,096
You got $63,000 there.
You can give me my share now.

34
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,570
I'm getting out.
Give Clantin my share, too.

35
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:58,799
He'll need to go
a long way to forget.

36
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:03,477
I wouldn't do that, Luke.
We're in this together.

37
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:09,757
I'm not so sure.

38
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:14,738
I want no part of this... What's
the sheriff going to do?

39
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:17,384
We’ll take care of that
when the time comes.

40
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:22,996
Who's there?

41
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,920
Who's there?

42
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:07,666
He's in the bank.
- Who's there?

43
00:17:08,465 --> 00:17:09,625
Mr Stanley?
- Yes.

44
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,269
Did you get him?
- No, he got away.

45
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:17,318
He shot Anderson
and might have held up the stage.

46
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,739
He came in riding one of
the stage horses. It’s likely, then.

47
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:26,915
He's killed Luke Joiner. No! Not
Luke! He won't get far in this storm.

48
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:30,596
Get after him.
I'll join you as soon as I can.

49
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:47,467
We'd better not be seen together
for a few days. Just as you say.

50
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:56,772
You know, he couldn't have come at
a better time. I wonder who he was.

51
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:17,822
Come on!

52
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,198
There's nothing there. Come on!

53
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:37,111
It's no use. You can't see ten feet
in this storm.

54
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,900
Anybody get a look at him?
Anderson.
He hasn’t come to yet.

55
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,429
He wasn't much of a deputy anyway.

56
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:47,758
Don't worry,
we'll find him in the morning.

57
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:50,868
It shouldn't be difficult
to find one man.

58
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:55,265
And when we do find him,
I want to deal with him myself.

59
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:58,487
Luke Joiner
was the best friend I had.

60
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:04,537
What could have happened to the
stage? We’re all anxious about that.

61
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:08,325
This man we're looking for
probably knows the answer.

62
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:37,219
How are you today, Betsey,
with seven little kittens?

63
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:40,079
Huh? What shall I name them?

64
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:46,070
Doh, Re, Mi, after the seven notes?
Or after the seven days of the week?

65
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:49,932
You're not the Seven Wonders
of the World!

66
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:54,507
"As I was going to St Ives,
I met a man with seven wives.

67
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:58,381
"Each wife had seven cats.
Each cat had seven kits.

68
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,470
"Kits, cats, man and wives.

69
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:03,621
"How many were going to St Ives?"

70
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:51,278
What are you doing here?
I’m on my way out, ma'am.

71
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:52,708
Who are you?

72
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:55,107
I didn't say.

73
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:59,921
Nobody's going to hurt you.
I’m relieved to hear it.

74
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,090
Why did you come in this house?
Didn't you see the flag?
I came in by the cellar door.

75
00:27:07,206 --> 00:27:13,146
You couldn't. There must be
two feet of sand on the cellar door.
- Not last night.

76
00:27:13,552 --> 00:27:15,522
You've been here all night?

77
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:21,378
I slept in the wood pile. I'm
obliged to you for a jar of peaches.

78
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,439
Did you like them?

79
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:27,268
I never tasted better.

80
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,497
I think you'd better go now.

81
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:35,304
With your kind permission, ma'am.

82
00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:37,528
Oh...

83
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,720
it was 400,
wherever they were going. Who?

84
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:46,491
The man with seven wives
and the cats and kits. 400.

85
00:27:47,238 --> 00:27:49,438
To St Ives? Oh, no - only one.

86
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:54,357
You said the man had seven wives,
each wife had seven cats...

87
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:57,794
But I met them.
They were COMING from St Ives.

88
00:27:57,877 --> 00:28:01,077
That makes only one - me -
going TO St Ives.

89
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:02,417
Correct, ma'am.

90
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,260
Goodbye.

91
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:08,879
Whoa.

92
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:24,216
There's a man outside. Who is it?
Dr Mason, probably.

93
00:28:24,697 --> 00:28:26,557
We have yellow fever here.

94
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:32,448
I'll wait in here.
You’re on the run, aren’t you?

95
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,879
How do you know I'll protect you?

96
00:28:38,237 --> 00:28:41,547
I'll leave that
to your good judgment, ma'am.

97
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:53,986
Morning, Nadine. Morning. I thought
the town would blow away last night.

98
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:56,197
How's the sheriff this morning?

99
00:28:56,913 --> 00:29:01,113
His temperature seems much higher.
Well, let’s have a look.

100
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:16,967
It's a mild type of yellow fever,
but that's bad enough.

101
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:22,198
I'll send over some medicine, but
he'll still need constant attention.

102
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:26,967
Thank you. Have you slept in the
last four days? I'll be all right.

103
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:30,168
Everyone's afraid
to come over and help you.

104
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:34,472
I don't need any help. Nadine,
do you have any coffee made?

105
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:38,043
Yes, there's some on the stove.
Thank you, dear.

106
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:54,487
It's been a bad night, Nadine.
I wish your father wasn't laid up.

107
00:29:54,598 --> 00:29:56,118
Has anything happened?

108
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,763
A man tried to rob the bank.
Killed Luke Joiner.

109
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:05,712
Shot him in the back. Same man shot
Anderson, but he’ll pull through.

110
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:10,423
The whole town's out looking for
him. They haven’t found him yet?

111
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:10,743
No.

112
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:22,516
Was it... somebody around here,

113
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:28,157
or a stranger? Anderson's the only
one who saw him and he can't talk.

114
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:30,895
Then he's still in town?

115
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:34,844
Must be.
He couldn't get very far on foot.

116
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,450
There aren't any horses.

117
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,627
Someone ran out the front door!

118
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:18,017
Lock the door. Don't open up for
anyone but me. And keep a gun handy.

119
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:29,164
Keep quiet.

120
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:40,913
I thought you were in a hurry to go.
Who’s in this house besides you?

121
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:45,695
Go - there's nobody stopping you.
Who else is here? Just my father.

122
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:51,100
And he's... I know. I heard what
the doctor said. Then will you go?

123
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:54,811
No. I'm better off
in the sheriff's house for now.

124
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:57,935
With yellow fever?
- I'll take my chances.

125
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:07,277
Water... Want some water...

126
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:10,039
Oh, Dad!

127
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:13,033
Water.
Want some water.

128
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:20,113
Need...

129
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:24,808
...water. Want some water.

130
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:29,875
Get me a pan of fresh water
and some towels... Well, go onl

131
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:02,155
He's asleep? For a little while.

132
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,440
Did he say anything
while I was gone? What?

133
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:12,498
Sometimes when he's delirious
he starts talking.

134
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:14,669
Oh, they all do.

135
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:17,773
It didn't make any sense. Oh.

136
00:33:18,776 --> 00:33:23,657
You're better than I am. Maybe I’ve
seen more sickness than you have.

137
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:28,588
Do you think it's out of my line?
If what the doctor said was true.

138
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:33,741
It was, as far as it went. It's a
right unfriendly town you live in.

139
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:39,394
So you WERE in the bank. Why do you
want to wear your father's badge?

140
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:46,324
The clothes in the trunk downstairs
would be a lot more becoming.

141
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:49,567
I didn't know you saw me.

142
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:52,527
I'm afraid I couldn't help it.

143
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,370
It looked pretty good.

144
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,979
Don't think I'll keep quiet
when they come looking for you.

145
00:34:04,115 --> 00:34:06,265
I need water.
Get some water.

146
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:12,984
Take it easy - you're choking him.

147
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:16,147
Go ahead - give him some.
Lift his head.

148
00:34:29,221 --> 00:34:31,671
Just leading you out of temptation.

149
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:36,451
I wish you'd go now.
- It's not politeness that's keeping me.

150
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,522
Are you sure you can describe him?

151
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,185
Well, I looked him over real good!

152
00:34:45,276 --> 00:34:48,826
Try and get a sketch
for the newspaper. Go ahead.

153
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:52,180
Well, he was tall.

154
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:53,691
Oh... 6ft 4in, maybe.

155
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:57,953
He had a mean face
and little, beady eyes.

156
00:34:58,415 --> 00:34:59,935
What colour?
- Black.

157
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:01,913
Mm-hm. Hair?

158
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:03,798
Black, too.

159
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:06,135
Long and stringy.

160
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:09,241
That look anything like him?

161
00:35:11,982 --> 00:35:14,762
Sure does.
Sure - it fits him to a T.

162
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:19,567
Not often you get such a detailed
description to work on.

163
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,580
I always try
to keep my eyes open.

164
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:27,098
Let's find him.
Should be easy
now we know what he looks like.

165
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:37,601
Mm-hm.

166
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,720
I helped myself to some coffee.

167
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,120
There's bacon and eggs
if you're hungry.

168
00:36:03,486 --> 00:36:05,636
I helped myself to those, too.

169
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:20,737
20 dollars. For bacon and eggs?
And a night’s lodging.

170
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:26,081
This isn't a boarding house. Well,
drop it in the church collection.

171
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,160
You do it.
Or do you ever go to church?

172
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:34,480
Believe it or not, I once sang in a
choir. Must’ve been a long time ago.

173
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:35,351
It was.

174
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:40,236
Might have been better
if you'd kept it up. Yeah, it might.

175
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:42,197
What made you stop?

176
00:36:44,398 --> 00:36:46,608
Oh, you grow up. Things happen.

177
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,889
What kind of things?

178
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:54,879
Are you still wondering
if I shot that man in the bank?

179
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:57,781
Did you?

180
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:01,472
No.

181
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:16,239
Your father uses good shaving soap.
I gave it to him for Christmas.

182
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:20,684
Why are you hiding? Half the town’s
out taking shots at me.

183
00:37:20,857 --> 00:37:24,287
If you're not guilty,
why not give yourself up?

184
00:37:24,383 --> 00:37:27,353
Because my name
happens to be Wes Steele.

185
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,680
WESLEY Steele?

186
00:37:30,085 --> 00:37:30,885
Yeah.

187
00:37:34,175 --> 00:37:38,315
I never met a notorious outlaw
before. Now, wait a minute.

188
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,598
I'm not an outlaw. But I didn't know
my reputation had travelled so far.

189
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,889
You underestimate your reputation.

190
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,840
How does a man like you become
a gunman? It’s easy once it starts.

191
00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:58,835
You learn to handle a gun better
than anybody else. Quite an art.

192
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:04,155
It's one that some people never
master. They’re just as well off.

193
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:06,531
My father wasn't.

194
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:10,374
He was what you'd call
an educated man.

195
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:13,986
He thought
you should reason with people.

196
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:17,168
Your father was right.
A gun killed him.

197
00:38:17,343 --> 00:38:20,703
I made up my mind
that wouldn't happen to me.

198
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,010
So YOU do the killing.
There isn’t always a choice.

199
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:32,381
Fellas try and prove you're not as
good as they are. Soon it's out of
hand and you have to shoot to live.

200
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:36,344
And it was always you that lived.

201
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,300
So far.

202
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:39,865
Nadine.

203
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:48,175
Nadine!

204
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:50,749
Go ahead. Answer it.

205
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:55,690
Nadine!

206
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:15,251
Did he come back? No-one’s come
since you left. I was worried
about you. How’s Mr Anderson?

207
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:19,005
He'll be all right, but...
What is it, Doctor?

208
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:22,666
They sent out a search party
for the stage.

209
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:23,417
The stage?

210
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:24,987
All dead.

211
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:29,952
Five people. Elizabeth Nelson
and her little girl. Oh, no!

212
00:39:31,714 --> 00:39:36,254
That man must be gun crazy!
I wish your father could take over.

213
00:39:36,682 --> 00:39:41,212
Are you sure it's the same man?
Who else? It could be Apaches.

214
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:44,274
No, it's robbery
and cold-blooded murder.

215
00:39:44,712 --> 00:39:47,262
I ought to leave a man here, but...

216
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:50,880
No, I'll be all right.
Then keep your gun handy.

217
00:39:50,881 --> 00:39:54,601
If he shows up, don't ask questions.
Shoot to kill.

218
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:58,305
Something wrong, Nadine?

219
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:04,231
No, it's Elizabeth Nelson
and her little girl.

220
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:06,349
Yes, I know.

221
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,100
All right.

222
00:40:18,994 --> 00:40:23,866
I had nothing to do with that stage.
Then who did? Who could have done it?

223
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:24,897
I don't know.

224
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,172
They were so sure.
- They want to be sure.

225
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:33,934
Like that deputy. No questions -
just shoot. Can't blame him.

226
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:42,074
I'll give you until dark.
Just until dark.

227
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:56,187
Nadine!

228
00:40:58,163 --> 00:40:58,683
Nadine!

229
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:04,982
Nadine!

230
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:16,081
There's eggs and milk
and medicine the doctor sent.

231
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:19,747
That sandstorm was awful!
Thank you, Mrs Maule.

232
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:24,867
There's a paper there, too. They're
getting together a BIG posse.

233
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:25,999
That's good.

234
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,250
There are guards posted at the pass.

235
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:34,648
He's going to pay for this with his
mortal life. Well, I gotta get back.

236
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,349
They're searching Mexican Town
and likely he's there.

237
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:43,238
Too bad you won't see him
when he's caught.

238
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:11,068
Nadine!

239
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:46,136
Water!

240
00:45:30,946 --> 00:45:31,706
Water.

241
00:45:33,754 --> 00:45:34,514
Water.

242
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:42,191
Nadine...

243
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:44,949
Nadine...

244
00:47:08,816 --> 00:47:11,246
I wish you wouldn't walk so easy!

245
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,510
This coffee's pretty muddy.

246
00:47:14,152 --> 00:47:16,132
This eggshell will clear it.

247
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:22,547
I want to thank you for last night.
- That's all right.

248
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:26,228
I fell fast asleep. I didn't mean to.
I couldn't help it.

249
00:47:26,363 --> 00:47:27,897
I don't wonder.

250
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:29,629
You shouldn't have stayed here.

251
00:47:34,816 --> 00:47:38,087
You don't look anything like that
picture in the paper.

252
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:39,906
I hope not!

253
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:46,157
What about the picture of the man
killed in the bank - Luke Joiner?
- What do you mean?

254
00:47:46,387 --> 00:47:48,187
Was that a good likeness?

255
00:47:50,428 --> 00:47:51,679
Yes.

256
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:56,549
Then he was the man I saw
in the bank. He took a shot at me.

257
00:47:57,155 --> 00:47:58,339
And you didn't shoot back?

258
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:01,022
No.
- Then who could have killed him?

259
00:48:01,998 --> 00:48:05,180
The only other man with him was...
But it couldn't have been him.

260
00:48:05,738 --> 00:48:07,113
Who?

261
00:48:07,148 --> 00:48:08,061
Mr Stanley.

262
00:48:08,716 --> 00:48:10,916
Who's he?
- Mr Joiner's partner.

263
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,302
Oh.

264
00:48:15,081 --> 00:48:16,859
That's the doctor.

265
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,732
Go ahead. I'll wait in the cellar.
- All right.

266
00:48:28,618 --> 00:48:30,615
Morning, Nadine.
- Morning.

267
00:48:48,082 --> 00:48:53,182
The doctor's gone. My father's awake.
He should be up in a day or so.

268
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,839
Then I guess I'll be going, too.

269
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:59,079
The roads are blocked.
Everyone has a gun.

270
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:04,447
They're looking for the man in that
picture in the newspaper - not me.

271
00:49:05,707 --> 00:49:08,557
Well, at least wait
until it gets dark.

272
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:18,563
When you leave, where will you go?
One place is as good as another.

273
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,419
I'm getting kinda tired
of running away. But...

274
00:49:22,749 --> 00:49:24,369
But where will you go?

275
00:49:25,274 --> 00:49:30,344
I don't know. Anywhere where Wesley
Steele is a name, not a reputation.

276
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:35,528
Is that all you're running
away from? A reputation?

277
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:38,869
It can get too big
for a man to live with.

278
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,260
Where did you get that money?

279
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:46,879
I didn't get it from the stagecoach
nor from the bank.

280
00:49:47,399 --> 00:49:49,189
Then how did you get it?

281
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:58,199
Suppose I told you I had a little
spread and I sold it - that I came
by it honestly. What would you do?

282
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:01,887
What would you do? Nothing.

283
00:50:04,374 --> 00:50:07,974
Suppose I told you I stole it.
What would you do?

284
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:15,364
I said, "What would you do?"

285
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:20,632
Nothing.

286
00:50:26,918 --> 00:50:29,128
What are YOU running away from?

287
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:34,137
I'm not running away from anything.
You don’t have to get on a horse

288
00:50:34,138 --> 00:50:36,568
and ride 1,000 miles to run away.

289
00:50:36,693 --> 00:50:40,653
You could run away right down
a flight of cellar steps.

290
00:50:58,056 --> 00:50:59,186
Silk. Linens.

291
00:51:00,665 --> 00:51:03,515
That little jar
you put rose petals in.

292
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,580
It's my hope chest.

293
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:10,489
Yeah, I've heard of 'em.
But why do you hide it,

294
00:51:10,794 --> 00:51:14,114
here in the cellar?
You’re being too personal.

295
00:51:14,682 --> 00:51:15,462
Oh.

296
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,420
Well, forget it.

297
00:51:25,337 --> 00:51:27,187
I suppose it's only fair.

298
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,750
It's my father -
it made him unhappy when I got it.

299
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:36,595
So you hide it down here because
he didn’t want you to grow up.

300
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:41,993
He's done everything for me. Mm-hm.
Except let you grow into a woman.

301
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:44,632
I am grown-up.

302
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:46,302
Are you?

303
00:52:36,809 --> 00:52:41,119
All right, boys. Place these two
at the centre of the altar.

304
00:53:15,886 --> 00:53:17,846
Let's go out and find him!

305
00:53:18,353 --> 00:53:19,983
Just a moment, friends.

306
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:27,041
The Bible tells us,
"Vengeance is Mine. I will repay."

307
00:53:28,478 --> 00:53:33,198
But I declare each of us may justly
be an instrument of punishment

308
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:35,831
for such cold-blooded work as this.

309
00:53:36,227 --> 00:53:39,957
It is a crime, not only
against these silent victims

310
00:53:40,813 --> 00:53:43,263
but every member of this community.

311
00:53:43,626 --> 00:53:46,556
Tomorrow morning,
when the minister comes,

312
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:50,250
we will commit these lost ones
to the earth.

313
00:53:50,557 --> 00:53:55,409
But our duty to them will not be
done until this killer is destroyed.

314
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,720
A watch will be kept
in the church all night.

315
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,970
It is only fitting, for the sake of
my friend and partner, Luke Joiner,

316
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:07,684
for me to take the first hour.

317
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:10,694
Every trail, every pass is guarded.

318
00:54:11,853 --> 00:54:14,233
This man must not get away alive.

319
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:17,519
If he is found,
report to me at once,

320
00:54:18,286 --> 00:54:21,086
and justice will be swift...
and final.

321
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:35,166
Who's there?

322
00:55:40,263 --> 00:55:43,494
I understood this watch hour
was to be private.

323
00:55:45,933 --> 00:55:47,273
Something you want?

324
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:50,379
You.

325
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:05,215
Who are you?
My name is Wesley Steele.

326
00:56:07,514 --> 00:56:10,534
A long way from home,
aren't you, Steele?

327
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,080
Oh - then you know about me.
No, not exactly.

328
00:56:14,227 --> 00:56:17,077
Quite a picture of me
in the newspaper.

329
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,630
I'm the man you're looking for.

330
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:23,009
You're mistaken.
We're not looking for you.

331
00:56:23,474 --> 00:56:28,234
I shot your deputy. I'm the man
your partner shot at in the bank.

332
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,590
Remember your partner, don't you?

333
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,900
You were behind him when
he was killed. RIGHT behind him.

334
00:56:35,274 --> 00:56:40,129
We have nothing against you, Steele.
You can ride out of town tonight.

335
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,659
Ride out with me and my men and go.

336
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:47,063
I wouldn't ride with a man
who shot his partner in the back.

337
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:50,364
And that's not all
you've got to answer for.

338
00:56:51,104 --> 00:56:55,514
You must be out of your head.
You've got no quarrel with me.

339
00:56:55,677 --> 00:57:02,727
If you think I was involved with
the stage holdup... I know you were.
I heard you talking it over.

340
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,060
The gun that killed the little girl
was working for you.

341
00:57:07,262 --> 00:57:09,692
Any man's got a quarrel with you.

342
00:57:11,419 --> 00:57:12,799
I... I won't draw.

343
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,070
I'm no gunman.

344
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:19,511
I won't draw.
I'd hate to turn my back.

345
00:57:22,027 --> 00:57:24,977
I won't draw. I...
I'm dropping my gun.

346
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:31,016
Go on.

347
00:57:31,668 --> 00:57:32,698
Get out!

348
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:35,391
Go on, get out!

349
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:56,739
You can't shoot an unarmed man.
No, but I can beat you to death.

350
00:59:02,404 --> 00:59:03,374
Get up!

351
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:16,059
Where have you been?

352
01:00:17,026 --> 01:00:18,076
Church meeting.

353
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:20,740
First time in years.

354
01:00:21,906 --> 01:00:23,236
Oh... you're hurt.

355
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:28,551
Had a fight.
Is your father still asleep?

356
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:34,856
Let me help you - please.
Come into the kitchen.

357
01:00:59,082 --> 01:01:03,082
Did anyone see you come in here?
Not as far as I know.

358
01:01:03,835 --> 01:01:06,343
Who were you fighting with? Stanley.

359
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:06,924
Stanley?

360
01:01:09,704 --> 01:01:12,194
He was in back of it all - Joiner,

361
01:01:12,913 --> 01:01:15,593
the stagecoach, all of it.
The coach?

362
01:01:18,115 --> 01:01:21,365
That's why I got him.
Because of that child.

363
01:01:22,503 --> 01:01:24,133
Oh... That little ch...

364
01:01:25,017 --> 01:01:26,001
Oh, Wes!

365
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:34,988
Oh, Wes!

366
01:01:47,801 --> 01:01:49,191
What is it, Doctor?

367
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:54,763
A slight concussion. He'll be
all right with plenty of rest.

368
01:01:55,308 --> 01:01:57,628
Does your father know he's here?

369
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:00,652
No. Everybody else does.

370
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:05,919
Clantin saw him leave the church
and head up your front steps.

371
01:02:06,163 --> 01:02:13,291
Must've been after he tangled with
Stanley. You know about that, too?
I just treated him. Mr Stanley?

372
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:14,502
Then he isn't...

373
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,340
He's all right.

374
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:21,660
Steele didn’t kill him.
He didn’t kill those others, either.

375
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:24,145
How do you know? I just know.

376
01:02:32,896 --> 01:02:36,436
Don't open the door.
They’ll only break it down.

377
01:02:37,335 --> 01:02:39,355
You stay with him. I'll go.

378
01:02:44,517 --> 01:02:45,727
Don't tell them.

379
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,782
We know he's here, Doc.
Who do you want?

380
01:02:58,023 --> 01:03:01,040
Who do you think?
You know who.
The killer.

381
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:04,481
The man here
doesn't fit Anderson's description.

382
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:09,541
Mason, the man we want is in
this house and we're gonna take him.

383
01:03:09,654 --> 01:03:13,534
You can't have him now.
Why not?
Who says we can’t?

384
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:15,993
I say it. He has yellow fever.

385
01:03:16,352 --> 01:03:17,212
He's lyin'.

386
01:03:18,496 --> 01:03:21,937
If you think so,
step in and stand near his bed.

387
01:03:21,938 --> 01:03:25,298
We'll take him anyhow.
He won't be sick long.

388
01:03:25,529 --> 01:03:28,897
Out of the way.
I can shoot him from the door.

389
01:03:30,168 --> 01:03:31,558
Get off this porch.

390
01:03:32,661 --> 01:03:35,381
She won’t shoot.
Let’s drag him out!

391
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:39,693
Nadine!

392
01:03:40,361 --> 01:03:41,281
What's that?

393
01:03:41,938 --> 01:03:45,528
I'll kill the next one.
Now get out, all of you!

394
01:03:45,943 --> 01:03:46,863
Nadine!

395
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:02,721
You're being a fool, Nadine.

396
01:04:03,384 --> 01:04:05,824
In more ways than one.
- Get out!

397
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,140
And stay out!

398
01:04:11,797 --> 01:04:13,357
What's going on here?

399
01:04:14,357 --> 01:04:17,337
Nadine's hiding a murderer.
Wesley Steele.

400
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:19,576
Steele? Here?

401
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:24,928
He's killed six people.
I saw him go in this house.

402
01:04:27,673 --> 01:04:29,703
Wait a minute. Just hold on.

403
01:04:30,699 --> 01:04:31,969
I'll handle this.

404
01:04:33,026 --> 01:04:34,706
Go on inside the house.

405
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,512
You men wait right here.

406
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:44,966
He took care of you when he might
have got away. That's why he's here.

407
01:04:52,826 --> 01:04:53,986
You through now?

408
01:04:57,183 --> 01:05:03,981
Do you think you can make me
believe that Wes Steele risked his
neck just to nurse me, the sheriff?

409
01:05:03,982 --> 01:05:08,342
You were raised different than that.
Don't try to lie to me.

410
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:13,110
How long's he been in my house?
Where have you been hiding him?

411
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,310
Carrying on behind my back
while I was sick!

412
01:05:16,419 --> 01:05:17,749
Your mind's dirty!

413
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:20,569
Like that mob out there!

414
01:05:26,012 --> 01:05:28,672
You do that again and I'll kill you.

415
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:31,751
So help me God, l'll kill you!

416
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:36,583
She means it, Gil.

417
01:05:37,687 --> 01:05:38,727
She loves him.

418
01:05:43,377 --> 01:05:46,659
Gil, doctors take an oath
as well as sheriffs.

419
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,570
There's a reason for both.

420
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:52,628
I save lives,
no matter what I think about a man.

421
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:55,420
That's why I said
he had yellow fever.

422
01:05:55,421 --> 01:05:59,081
And you're bound to uphold the law
by due process,

423
01:05:59,244 --> 01:06:04,204
to protect an accused man from mob
violence, no matter what you think.

424
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:09,184
That principle's more important
than that man, Nadine, or me or you.

425
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:12,774
You can't give him to that mob.

426
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,669
I think Gil
will do the right thing.

427
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,120
He never has before.

428
01:06:40,972 --> 01:06:44,364
You men all know
I've been down with the fever.

429
01:06:44,365 --> 01:06:47,055
Otherwise
this wouldn't have happened.

430
01:06:47,222 --> 01:06:52,392
No-one blames you, Gil. Turn that
killer over to us and go back to bed.

431
01:06:52,494 --> 01:06:57,447
I'll make up my own mind about that.
-  Do it now for your own good.

432
01:06:57,448 --> 01:07:01,194
I'll decide what's good for me
without help from you.

433
01:07:01,195 --> 01:07:03,455
But he's a very
dangerous man.

434
01:07:03,965 --> 01:07:06,055
I'll still handle him myself.

435
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,450
You won't let us have him?

436
01:07:09,033 --> 01:07:09,913
No.

437
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:17,544
Henry, go to my office and get
me a set of leg irons and shackles.

438
01:07:19,009 --> 01:07:23,079
This gunman won't be leaving here.
You can bank on that.

439
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,080
Do you want some water?

440
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:17,501
You let them put chains on me?
I couldn't stop it.

441
01:08:20,862 --> 01:08:24,162
They've got my name on a rope,
haven't they?

442
01:08:25,398 --> 01:08:27,368
Wes, can you talk a little?

443
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:29,374
Yes, to you, honey.

444
01:08:30,325 --> 01:08:31,485
Stanley’s alive.

445
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:35,652
I'm so glad he didn't die.

446
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:39,560
Well, if he'd died,
we never could clear you.

447
01:08:40,948 --> 01:08:43,848
You think my word
against his'll do it?

448
01:08:44,134 --> 01:08:47,674
He's got this town in his hands -
you know that.

449
01:08:51,738 --> 01:08:54,288
Can you give me some of this water?

450
01:09:00,005 --> 01:09:01,915
What is it? Drink it down.

451
01:09:08,072 --> 01:09:10,512
Try and sleep. You'll feel better.

452
01:09:33,356 --> 01:09:35,446
Find what you're looking for?

453
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:37,737
What WERE you looking for?

454
01:09:38,617 --> 01:09:41,637
I know Stanley has
this town in his hand.

455
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:47,112
I didn't think he had Gil Corrigan
there. What makes you think he has?

456
01:09:47,564 --> 01:09:52,414
You said things in your delirium
you never would have said otherwise.

457
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:56,518
What a man says when he's sick
means nothing.

458
01:09:56,977 --> 01:10:01,817
That's what I thought at first and
what I tried to make myself believe.

459
01:10:03,781 --> 01:10:05,401
But now I know better.

460
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:11,249
The sheriff in this town gets
his house free and $110 a month.

461
01:10:12,402 --> 01:10:15,007
How much have you been able to save?

462
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:16,858
Some. As much as I could.

463
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:18,749
Not this much.

464
01:10:21,578 --> 01:10:24,138
Stanley came to Macer six years ago.

465
01:10:24,384 --> 01:10:26,424
We were poor then - remember?

466
01:10:27,205 --> 01:10:27,955
Real poor.

467
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:33,092
Well, we're not poor any more.

468
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,820
Who put these kind of notions
in your head?

469
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:38,881
That saddle-tramp killer?

470
01:10:39,538 --> 01:10:43,608
A man who would shoot
another man in the back - and did?

471
01:10:44,202 --> 01:10:48,884
Who shot a deputy the minute he hit
town? You'd take advice from him?

472
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:53,805
Why not mention the people on the
stage he's supposed to have killed?

473
01:10:57,017 --> 01:10:58,517
Well? Why don't you?

474
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:01,943
Why don't you?

475
01:11:03,334 --> 01:11:07,324
How do you know he didn't?
He’s not that kind of man.

476
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:12,998
I don't believe you are, either. You
know where I was when that happened.

477
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:18,379
But not when the Trinidad Bank was
held up. And the Bonded Stage Line.

478
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:24,026
And the assay office in New Eldorado.
You didn't solve those, did you?

479
01:11:24,027 --> 01:11:28,917
Nobody was killed in any of them.
I don't hold with killing, Nadine.

480
01:11:29,322 --> 01:11:31,932
Then don't let them kill Wes Steele.

481
01:11:31,946 --> 01:11:38,566
He'll have his day in court.
He’ll have five minutes if he gets
that far, and you know it.

482
01:11:41,608 --> 01:11:46,187
Wes Steele’s a gunman. He’s killed
in Texas and he’s killed here.

483
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:49,898
I don't set myself up
as judge and jury, like you.

484
01:11:50,024 --> 01:11:54,919
All I can do is turn him over to the
court as soon as he's able to walk.

485
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,280
I've tried to raise you
the best way I could,

486
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:03,168
to make you happy, to teach you the
difference between right and wrong.

487
01:12:03,169 --> 01:12:08,001
Then, when I can't help myself, you
get taken in by this saddle tramp.

488
01:12:08,002 --> 01:12:12,902
He's poisoned your mind and your
heart, too, against your own father.

489
01:12:12,946 --> 01:12:17,826
If I catch you in another low trick
like this, I'll kill him myself.

490
01:12:17,827 --> 01:12:22,607
He won't sneak into another man's
home and ruin it - do you hear me?

491
01:12:22,608 --> 01:12:26,928
I hear. You taught me the difference
between right and wrong.

492
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:31,796
You knew it once. Well, I haven't
forgotten. You don’t understand.

493
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:36,270
I understand more than you think.
I'm not a child any more.

494
01:12:38,115 --> 01:12:40,555
You heard what I said!

495
01:12:49,236 --> 01:12:54,046
Ah, Dr Mason. Join me for a drink?
Thank you. Don’t care if I do.

496
01:12:57,652 --> 01:13:01,852
How's your star patient getting on?
Better than I expected.

497
01:13:02,065 --> 01:13:05,486
He'll be out tomorrow.
He’ll be as good as ever?

498
01:13:05,487 --> 01:13:09,567
It seems my diagnosis
of yellow fever was a little hasty.

499
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:14,002
Thank you, gentlemen.

500
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:18,798
You hear that, Judge?
How's that?

501
01:13:19,346 --> 01:13:21,888
Wes Steele
can stand trial tomorrow.

502
01:13:21,889 --> 01:13:23,789
That's why I'm here, sir!

503
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:35,606
Bring your men. Meet me at the bank.

504
01:13:48,613 --> 01:13:50,583
Seems like a waste of soap.

505
01:13:51,436 --> 01:13:55,776
Don't say that. It's not very funny.
No, I guess it isn’t.

506
01:13:55,903 --> 01:14:01,053
I'm not used to chains. It's the
first time in my life and I hate it.

507
01:14:01,446 --> 01:14:06,386
Wes, I've searched everywhere for
the keys. I don't know what to do.

508
01:14:08,085 --> 01:14:09,415
Don't cry, Nadine.

509
01:14:10,673 --> 01:14:14,543
I've had a good life
and I've lived it - all of it.

510
01:14:15,605 --> 01:14:19,445
But being Wes Steele,
I knew it might end any minute.

511
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:24,727
Of course, I'd like to live
100 years if I could live with you.

512
01:14:24,901 --> 01:14:27,391
But, if it's going to be tomorrow,

513
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:30,298
well, don't let it worry you
too much.

514
01:14:31,209 --> 01:14:33,759
A better man will come for you yet.

515
01:15:29,749 --> 01:15:33,469
In Wes Steele’s hand,
that gun could kill five men.

516
01:15:33,526 --> 01:15:35,426
I'd have to be the first.

517
01:15:36,091 --> 01:15:40,291
Nobody gave Elizabeth Nelson
a chance. That’s not my fault.

518
01:15:40,515 --> 01:15:44,355
You're going to let them hang Wes
for those killings.

519
01:15:44,648 --> 01:15:49,496
How can I stop them? Tell them
what you and Stanley have been up to.

520
01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:50,947
Tell them the truth.

521
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:55,444
You'd sell me out for a stranger?

522
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:00,561
You sold yourself out, Dad.

523
01:16:12,106 --> 01:16:17,065
I won't try to justify what I've
done, but maybe I can tell you why.

524
01:16:17,066 --> 01:16:18,576
This is hard country.

525
01:16:19,622 --> 01:16:24,272
It killed your mother, and I had
to sit there and watch her die.

526
01:16:24,473 --> 01:16:27,723
She was as young
and as pretty as you, once.

527
01:16:28,605 --> 01:16:30,165
As young and as fine.

528
01:16:31,774 --> 01:16:36,134
We had high hopes and big dreams,
but none of 'em came true.

529
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:38,270
Not a one.

530
01:16:40,275 --> 01:16:45,093
The first year we were married,
all the wells on the ranch went dry.

531
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,800
Not a windmill turned for 240 days.

532
01:16:51,663 --> 01:16:55,103
Cattle broke into the yard
and just stood there,

533
01:16:55,337 --> 01:16:56,617
bawling for water.

534
01:16:57,819 --> 01:16:59,549
But we didn't have any.

535
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:02,019
We sat, praying for rain

536
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:05,481
and watching them die one by one -

537
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:07,169
one thousand head.

538
01:17:09,392 --> 01:17:12,182
I still hear those cattle
in my sleep!

539
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:18,044
We lost the ranch, moved into town
and you were born.

540
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:23,675
I went to Phoenix and worked on the
new railroad for six cents an hour.

541
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:28,243
And when I came home, I found
your mother taking in washing,

542
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:31,462
so thin, gaunt and sick
I hardly knew her.

543
01:17:31,851 --> 01:17:37,021
It was too late to make things right
for her, but not too late for you.

544
01:17:37,246 --> 01:17:42,016
You know how it is here, Nadine -
hot and dry and dirty and dusty.

545
01:17:42,508 --> 01:17:46,818
Can't grow crops. Half the time
you can hardly raise cattle.

546
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,499
It's dog eat dog. It's the only way
a man can get along.

547
01:17:51,553 --> 01:17:57,623
Back East, they talk about
how wonderful the West is,
how you can get rich overnight.

548
01:17:57,813 --> 01:18:00,133
Just throw out a handful of seed

549
01:18:00,369 --> 01:18:03,269
or pick up some gold
from a stream bed.

550
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:06,960
Folks'll tell you that
who've never seen the West,

551
01:18:06,961 --> 01:18:09,341
at least, never seen what I have.

552
01:18:09,515 --> 01:18:15,855
Back East they have different ideas.
They'd say it's wrong for a sheriff
to make a deal

553
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,621
with a man like Stanley.
It IS wrong.

554
01:18:18,745 --> 01:18:21,115
I had to live!
You had to live!

555
01:18:22,549 --> 01:18:26,064
You were only two years old
when your mother died.

556
01:18:26,065 --> 01:18:31,065
I promised myself then you'd never
know a hungry day or a cold night.

557
01:18:35,312 --> 01:18:38,162
So far, I’ve kept that promise,
Nadine.

558
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:45,970
I mean to go on keeping it. I don't
know how, exactly. But giving Steele
that gun won't make things right.

559
01:18:50,172 --> 01:18:53,252
Go on, honey.
You'd better get some sleep.

560
01:18:54,022 --> 01:18:57,522
I'll figure something out.
I'll figure something.

561
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:27,972
Steele? I’m not asleep.

562
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:31,260
Hold out your hands.

563
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:38,408
So I run and get shot
trying to escape, huh?

564
01:19:49,663 --> 01:19:53,503
Strap this on and get your hat.
It’s almost daylight.

565
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:57,623
You're taking a chance,
giving me a gun. I guess not.

566
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:02,702
I'm gonna kill Stanley. You won’t
see him. You sure of that? Be quiet.

567
01:20:02,703 --> 01:20:07,277
Nadine's asleep. Stanley’s in back
of these killings. You know that.

568
01:20:07,278 --> 01:20:09,248
What I know is my business.

569
01:20:09,784 --> 01:20:12,174
Come on - through the cellar door.

570
01:20:41,323 --> 01:20:45,925
Over that ridge you'll pick up
the old army road to the Colorado.

571
01:20:47,816 --> 01:20:53,756
It's Apache country.
They’ll know you’ve turned me loose.
Let me worry about that.

572
01:20:54,191 --> 01:20:56,981
I'm thinking about Nadine.
...So am I.

573
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:02,490
I'll be coming back for her.
No, you won’t.

574
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:09,627
Not if you care about her.
Nadine has good stuff in her.
Maybe not from me, but it's there.

575
01:21:09,628 --> 01:21:14,332
I want her to marry a man with more
prospect of life than you've got.

576
01:21:46,247 --> 01:21:47,697
Where have you been?

577
01:21:48,702 --> 01:21:49,622
Where is he?

578
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:51,331
He's gone.

579
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:55,337
You turned him loose?!

580
01:21:57,618 --> 01:22:00,408
I don't believe
he did those killings.

581
01:22:03,148 --> 01:22:07,338
That's for the court to decide, Gil.
I’ve decided already.

582
01:22:08,955 --> 01:22:11,445
That man's got to be brought back.

583
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:22,315
They'll try and make you tell
where he went.

584
01:22:22,635 --> 01:22:23,445
They might.

585
01:22:27,798 --> 01:22:29,878
Let's get out of here - now.

586
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,490
There's nothing to run away from,
Nadine.

587
01:22:41,907 --> 01:22:42,247
Hey!

588
01:22:47,818 --> 01:22:49,498
Is that the tree? Yeah.

589
01:22:50,848 --> 01:22:51,188
Boy!

590
01:22:52,978 --> 01:22:57,398
If this man is able to stand trial,
we shall proceed with it.

591
01:22:58,276 --> 01:22:59,726
Here comes Dr Mason.

592
01:23:00,848 --> 01:23:05,777
Corrigan let him go. You’re joking!
He's gone. Why should he do that?

593
01:23:05,778 --> 01:23:10,507
I can’t say. You must know! There’s
something between Nadine and Steele.

594
01:23:10,508 --> 01:23:13,597
You don't know.
We’ll find out from Corrigan.

595
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:22,625
You'd better go out there and quiet
those people down. What can I do?

596
01:23:22,626 --> 01:23:27,440
They'll listen to you. They won’t
listen to anyone. Gil's your friend.

597
01:23:27,441 --> 01:23:28,831
So was Luke Joiner.

598
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:34,054
You've been drinking too much.
If you won’t... Judge?

599
01:23:34,597 --> 01:23:36,337
There'll be no lynching.

600
01:23:37,067 --> 01:23:37,647
Ortega -

601
01:23:39,194 --> 01:23:40,994
go out and help. Sheriff?

602
01:23:43,211 --> 01:23:44,601
What are you doing?

603
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,620
I'm gonna throw up.

604
01:23:51,743 --> 01:23:53,673
GENERAL HUBBUB DROWNS SPEECH

605
01:24:00,478 --> 01:24:02,978
You should've kept riding with Wes.

606
01:24:03,332 --> 01:24:04,782
I live here, Nadine.

607
01:24:10,982 --> 01:24:12,602
Didn't take them long.

608
01:24:21,938 --> 01:24:25,488
Where is he, Gil?
They say you
turned him loose.

609
01:24:25,821 --> 01:24:32,051
He didn't kill... You let him go
because he’s carrying on
with that daughter of yours!

610
01:24:34,608 --> 01:24:34,948
Dad!

611
01:24:37,007 --> 01:24:37,697
Hang him!

612
01:24:39,069 --> 01:24:42,429
Put a rope round his neck!
You can't do this!

613
01:24:46,642 --> 01:24:47,862
Serves you right!

614
01:24:55,901 --> 01:25:00,401
They're lynching Gil Corrigan.
You must stop them! Do something!

615
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:05,681
There's nothing I can do. We must
get the sheriff away from that mob!

616
01:25:05,682 --> 01:25:09,692
Besides, he knows where Steele is.
He’d only lie to us.

617
01:25:10,129 --> 01:25:14,589
Looks like he's in with Steele.
I don’t, I WON'T believe it!

618
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,680
Stanley thinks
we should string him up!

619
01:26:04,395 --> 01:26:08,876
Tell Stanley to come out and
give his orders to me. Who are you?

620
01:26:08,877 --> 01:26:09,687
Wes Steele.

621
01:26:15,418 --> 01:26:16,868
Turn that man loose.

622
01:26:17,926 --> 01:26:21,346
I'll kill the first man
that goes for his gun.

623
01:26:22,372 --> 01:26:26,772
That's far enough! I can hit
a lot of you before I go down.

624
01:26:28,364 --> 01:26:31,674
You with the rope - take it off.
Take it off!

625
01:26:36,184 --> 01:26:37,344
Untie his hands.

626
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:45,793
Let him go.

627
01:26:50,645 --> 01:26:55,705
This is a rotten town. But for once,
you're gonna listen to the truth.

628
01:26:56,397 --> 01:27:02,007
The man who did the killings
works for one of your most
distinguished citizens.

629
01:27:02,478 --> 01:27:04,738
Get out there and gun him down!

630
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:12,686
Stanley, come out and tell us how
you shot Luke Joiner in the back!

631
01:27:12,702 --> 01:27:13,982
Come out, Stanley!

632
01:27:17,418 --> 01:27:19,568
Come on, Stanley, and deny it!

633
01:27:19,939 --> 01:27:21,559
Go on - get out there!

634
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:26,513
I'll go.

635
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,940
Steele’s telling the truth.
I know - I work for Stanley.

636
01:28:56,636 --> 01:28:58,146
Clantin - look at me.

637
01:29:07,113 --> 01:29:09,903
GIL: I'll blow you to pieces,
Stanley.

638
01:29:12,126 --> 01:29:12,756
Drop it.

639
01:29:25,939 --> 01:29:30,299
You're forgetting, Corrigan.
You're in this as much as I am.

640
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:35,210
Am I? It's gonna be your word
against mine. I'll take my chances.

641
01:29:37,987 --> 01:29:38,617
Come on.

642
01:29:53,128 --> 01:29:54,228
Hey, you - out.

643
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:13,431
Lucas, Turner -
take these two and lock them up.

644
01:30:19,652 --> 01:30:22,152
You'd better go with Steele, honey.

645
01:30:22,162 --> 01:30:23,262
What about you?

646
01:30:24,551 --> 01:30:27,937
I'll stay here.
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

647
01:30:27,938 --> 01:30:30,975
I'm not leaving you.

648
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:33,675
There's no life for you here.
This is a rotten town.

649
01:30:33,699 --> 01:30:38,511
Wherever you go has to be better.
- She's not going anywhere with me.

650
01:30:39,986 --> 01:30:45,493
I'm not leaving. Who knows
if this place is any worse
than the next one I hit?

651
01:30:45,528 --> 01:30:50,274
From the look of it, it has a good
chance of being better. I'm staying.

652
01:31:02,935 --> 01:31:04,290
Let's go home.
