00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:05,717
<i>ANNOUNCER:
The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,752 --> 00:00:09,323
<i>is brought to you
in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:12,053
(fanfare plays)

4
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:19,622
(men laughing in distance)

5
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:27,139
Now, now can I have that drink?

6
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:29,059
Not until you finish
your story, Charlie.

7
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:30,944
You have to tell us
about General Fremont.

8
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:33,197
Yes, let me see, where was I?

9
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:35,380
Oh, yeah, that was the time

10
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:37,851
that me and the general come
through here together.

11
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:41,386
That was in the summer of '47.

12
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,255
As a matter of fact,
there wouldn't have been

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,260
no Virginia City if it hadn't
been for me and the general.

14
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:48,994
(laughter)

15
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:51,098
I told you to shut up
your lying, didn't I?

16
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,064
I ain't lying.

17
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:53,432
- You are lying.
- I... (groaning)

18
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:55,702
- Ain't you, ain't you?!
- Yes, sir, yes, sir.

19
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:57,636
Now, wait a minute, mister,

20
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,838
old Charlie here
don't mean any harm.

21
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:02,309
He's just an old man
hangin' around the saloon.

22
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:04,869
We like to hear his stories.

23
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:10,148
Well, I don't like to hear them.

24
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:13,641
Now, did anybody ask you
to put in your two bits' worth?

25
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:21,311
- (laughter) -Why don't
you fellas leave me be?

26
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:23,830
I tell you, I did scout
for General Fremont.

27
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,130
I tell you, I did.

28
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:26,967
Why don't you leave me be?

29
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:28,333
All right, old man.

30
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:31,462
Latigo, give me a knife.

31
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:36,007
What you aiming to do?

32
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:39,511
Well, now, anybody that's fought

33
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,015
as many Indians
as you claim you have

34
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,484
ought to have a few scars,
shouldn't he?

35
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,851
No.

36
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:49,556
Suppose we just scratch off
some of this beard and...

37
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,690
- Ow!
- (laughter)

38
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:52,993
- So's we can...
- (Charlie groans)

39
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,326
Put on some war paint.

40
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,595
(men taunting,
talking over each other)

41
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,586
Leave him alone!

42
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,251
(panting)

43
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:09,064
(grunts)

44
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:29,494
Come on, Charlie.

45
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,731
Let's get you out of here before
you get in any more trouble.

46
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:35,167
Thank you, Hoss... thank ye.

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,116
My friend Charlie don't like
to be treated like that.

48
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:51,082
(sighs)

49
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:52,550
I don't like it neither.

50
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:07,067
You dropped something.

51
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:09,634
Yeah.

52
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:13,765
HOSS:
"Fremont Expedition, 1847."

53
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,112
"Presented to Charles Trent,

54
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,079
"chief scout,

55
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:25,710
for services above and beyond
the line of duty."

56
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,915
Charlie, you... you wouldn't
want to lose that.

57
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:41,968
(theme song playing)

58
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:25,745
You're about the only
real friend I got in town.

59
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,948
All I seem to do is
a-cause you trouble.

60
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,180
Charlie, you promised me solemn

61
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:30,850
you wasn't goin'
back in that saloon again.

62
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:32,484
Well, l-I didn't mean to.

63
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,655
Just them fellas wanted to hear
some of my stories, that's all.

64
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,157
Yeah, for a couple of drinks.

65
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:38,924
I guess...

66
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,459
I guess you won't give me
another chance, will you?

67
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:43,563
Dad-burnit, Charlie, how many
chances you gonna have to have?

68
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:46,166
I talked Pa into giving you
a job on the ranch.

69
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:47,165
And what do you do?

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,366
The first payday you take off

71
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,769
and we don't see you again
for a week,

72
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:50,936
and you come back drunk.

73
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,405
That was, that was
a mistake, Hoss.

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,842
Charlie, it's that way with
every job you got around here.

75
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:58,244
There ain't nobody around here
going to give you a chance now.

76
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,946
I, I guess you're right,

77
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:03,516
but I ain't gonna
to bother you no more,

78
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,083
I can promise you that much,

79
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,454
'cause I'm, I'm gonna take up
scouting again.

80
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,054
(chuckling):
Yeah.

81
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,825
General Fremont... he'll be
sending for me any time now...

82
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,658
today, tomorrow for sure.

83
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:15,794
Charlie, I, I wouldn't count
on it too much.

84
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,465
General Fremont's a busy man
with, uh, this war talk and all.

85
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,199
Oh, I know, I know he,
he wouldn't go back on me.

86
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:24,304
You see, him and me... we crossed
the Great Salt Flat together.

87
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,208
I'd better, better go fix up
a little, though, I guess.

88
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:30,609
Charlie... it...
it just ain't no use.

89
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:34,848
I... I done made up my mind
what I'm gonna do with you.

90
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:36,615
- What? - Well, I'm,
I'm gonna go in there

91
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,419
and get some money and
I'm gonna, gonna fix you all up

92
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:41,019
nice and clean,
and I'm gonna put you

93
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:44,541
on the first stagecoach
out of here for San Francisco.

94
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:48,028
That's mighty kind of you,
Hoss, I, I appreciate it,

95
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:50,296
but I can't go to no big city.

96
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:51,363
(sniffs)

97
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:54,134
I belong out here,
I got to stay here.

98
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:56,434
Charlie, I, I been all wrong

99
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,538
about maybe you getting
a new chance here.

100
00:05:58,573 --> 00:05:59,638
It's...

101
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:01,307
The big city's
the only place for you.

102
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:03,510
- I...
- You stay right here.

103
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,679
Don't you go no place, you hear?

104
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:08,546
Hoss!

105
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,083
CHARLIE (muttering):
Gone... Hoss...

106
00:06:10,118 --> 00:06:12,074
Hold on, Cutter.

107
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,054
Where you going?

108
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,158
I heard a couple friends of mine
was passing through.

109
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,290
Thought I'd talk to 'em is all.

110
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:20,992
Well, I have a strict schedule
on this mission.

111
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:24,764
You be back here and ready
to lead out in one half hour.

112
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:27,767
- (Cutter laughs)
- Cutter.

113
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:30,402
Cap'n...

114
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:33,707
I think it's about time you
and me had us an understanding.

115
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:35,840
Now, I been Ioning it
through this territory

116
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,279
for a goodly time and I ain't
never taken no orders yet,

117
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:42,449
not from a savage
and not from no soldier boy.

118
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:45,550
You signed an army contract
to scout trail.

119
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:48,088
You're going to fulfill it...
and to the letter...

120
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:49,487
or you'll be relieved.

121
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:53,860
Why, mister,
you've got about as much chance

122
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,293
of crossing that desert
without me

123
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:58,031
as a blind hooty bat has
of reaching the sun.

124
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:01,666
(Cutter laughs)

125
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,736
All right, carry on, men.

126
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:03,968
(grunting)

127
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:06,404
Cap'n, Cap'n,
I know that whole desert.

128
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,641
I mapped out the first trail
to Salt Lake City.

129
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:10,844
I know the whereabouts
of every water hole.

130
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,730
Yeah, well,
l-I can't sign on anybody

131
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,546
just because they claim
to be a scout.

132
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:17,217
You don't, you don't,
you don't believe me, huh?

133
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:20,618
Yeah, yeah, look at that,
look at that.

134
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:23,722
Fremont Expedition?!

135
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:27,961
Yeah, you can read what's
written on the other side, too.

136
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:31,765
"Presented to Charles Trent,
chief scout,

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,134
for services..."

138
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,635
Trent?

139
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,101
Yeah.

140
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:40,538
Are you the same Trent
that scouted

141
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:42,942
for the border expedition
against the Apaches?

142
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:46,412
Yeah, that was back in,
back in '53.

143
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:49,032
I wouldn't have known you.

144
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,583
I mean, it's been so long.

145
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:52,986
Of course,
you wouldn't remember me.

146
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:55,272
I was just a shavetail, but...

147
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,489
that was my first assignment.

148
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,124
I guess
it would have been my last

149
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,896
if you hadn't led us out
of that Apache trap.

150
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:04,295
Charlie Trent.

151
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,594
You'll give me a chance then?

152
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:12,005
Now, Charlie,
that gold shipment is vital,

153
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,941
maybe with a war coming on.

154
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,932
We've got a scout.

155
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:25,314
Perhaps next time
I make a trip, Charlie.

156
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:36,060
Cap'n.

157
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,762
That old bum was pretty drunk,

158
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:39,924
thinking he can scout
for you, sir.

159
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:47,906
Corporal, "that old bum"

160
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:52,177
was the finest scout
in the United States Army.

161
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:55,915
Whatever I know about this
territory I learned from him.

162
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,818
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

163
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:00,809
I am, too.

164
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:10,352
Give us a bottle.

165
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,369
Give old buzzard bait
a drink here, too.

166
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:18,360
(Cutter laughs)

167
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:21,574
Wake up,
the man's buying you a drink.

168
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,565
Huh? Oh.

169
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:28,272
(men laughing)

170
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,270
- Charlie.
- Huh? Huh?

171
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:51,402
Oh, oh-ho!

172
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,539
Hoss, did I ever tell you
about the time

173
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,692
I led a expedition
up the Columbia River?

174
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,775
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you told me, Charlie.

175
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,547
Come on, let's go down to the
stable and you can clean it off.

176
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:03,948
I tried... Hoss.

177
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,684
Honest, honest, I tried hard.

178
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,722
You ask them soldier boys
if I didn't.

179
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:14,725
That captain...
he just didn't want me.

180
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:18,963
(sighs)

181
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:20,531
(clicks tongue)

182
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:24,468
Joe, give me a cup of coffee
and a sandwich.

183
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:37,015
Cutter's in here, Cap'n.

184
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,152
You ain't making no friends
with none of us, Cutter,

185
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:40,186
way you're treating the cap'n.

186
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,177
(Cutter scoffs)

187
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:48,294
I told you to be back and ready
in half an hour.

188
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,727
Mm-hmm.

189
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:53,366
Seems to me I do remember
you saying something like that.

190
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,785
Well, don't you mind now.

191
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,169
I'll be along a little while.

192
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:58,202
Barkeep...

193
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:01,138
set my friend the captain here
up a drink.

194
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:13,152
Last man that grabbed me
like that was a Blackfoot chief.

195
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:14,786
I cut his liver out.

196
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,657
A man don't live long
without a liver, Captain.

197
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:20,093
That's a pure medical fact.

198
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:22,460
I'm giving you a direct order.

199
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,165
Get outside
and join the detail... now.

200
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,032
Or what?

201
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,968
Or you're through.

202
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:33,339
Well, now, that don't seem
so likely, mister.

203
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:36,743
You need a scout,
and I'm the only one there is.

204
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,113
You're a long way from being
indispensable, Cutter.

205
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:42,248
There's a man who knows
the wasteland country

206
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:44,183
better than you
or any scout alive...

207
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:46,102
Charlie Trent.

208
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:47,952
Trent?
(scoffs)

209
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:49,856
Where you gonna find him?

210
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,324
Charlie.

211
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,830
That's Charlie Trent?

212
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:01,165
(Cutter laughs)

213
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,137
The great Charlie Trent, huh?

214
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:05,706
Remington massacre.

215
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,205
You remember, Charlie?

216
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,141
You led them soldier boys
right into an ambush,

217
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:12,745
right smack-dab up to where
them Injuns was waitin'.

218
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,178
(Cutter laughing)

219
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:16,949
He's just the kind of a scout
you need, Cap'n.

220
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,182
(laughing)

221
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,811
Collect your gear from the wagon
and then clear out.

222
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:26,982
(snickers)

223
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:35,935
Take along plenty of water,
soldier boy, plenty of water.

224
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,393
(laughing)

225
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,004
Charlie...

226
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:54,514
Charlie, you asked me
for a chance.

227
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,754
This is it.

228
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:59,690
Now, don't give me
any cause to regret it.

229
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:04,397
We'll provide you with
your mount and your gear.

230
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:07,231
Get anything else you need.

231
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,166
We'll move out
as soon as you're ready.

232
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,407
Well?

233
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,769
Cap'n...

234
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,853
Cap'n, I...

235
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:31,516
He'll do it, Cap'n.

236
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,549
Uh, Charlie!

237
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,265
Cap'n...

238
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,567
my name's Cartwright.

239
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:44,302
I... I'm a friend
of old Charlie's.

240
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:47,170
I'll see to it he's
ready to go in no time.

241
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,005
We rode together.

242
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,714
Cap'n...

243
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,341
let him ride with you again.

244
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:04,288
I haven't much choice.

245
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:06,757
Thank you, sir.
I... I'll get him.

246
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:23,341
Charlie...

247
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:25,411
Charlie... I been looking
all over this town for you.

248
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:26,811
The cap'n's down there
waiting for you.

249
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:29,315
- You got to get your gear and...
- Leave me alone, please, sir.

250
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,748
Please leave me alone.

251
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:33,235
Just go... go tell
that captain man

252
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,688
you couldn't find me,
that's all.

253
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:37,321
Charlie... he's offering you

254
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:39,308
the chance you've
been waiting for.

255
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,225
If it was just me,
l-I wouldn't mind.

256
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,199
But, you see, it's Pender and
all his men depending on me...

257
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:48,299
Charlie...

258
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:51,571
you led the first map party
across that desert.

259
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:55,141
The first white man
that ever crossed it.

260
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:57,475
Now, if you can do that,

261
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,172
you can lead Pender
and his men now.

262
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:05,618
Or... Or was that just
one of your lies

263
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,351
about leading that map party?

264
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:11,057
No. 'Cause that was true,
Hoss, that was true.

265
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,390
All right, then.

266
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:14,961
Now, Charlie, you listen to me,
and you listen real good.

267
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:16,761
If you let Cap'n Pender
and those men

268
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:18,362
go out across that desert
without somebody

269
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:21,534
<i>to scout the trail for 'em,
you are gonna be a coward</i>

270
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:22,867
<i>and a murderer.</i>

271
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:26,103
Charlie, you got to do it!

272
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:28,507
If you...
if you would help me,

273
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,660
if you'll come with me.

274
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,743
Well, Charlie, I...

275
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,263
Just like... just like you...

276
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:35,713
just like you said yourself,

277
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,516
this here is the chance
I've been waiting for.

278
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:41,418
Will you please help me?
Will you please come with me?

279
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:45,558
Yes, sir, I'll go with you.

280
00:15:45,593 --> 00:15:47,583
Ah. Thank you.

281
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,619
Oh, hey...

282
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:54,066
Well, good-bye, Captain,
and good luck.

283
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:55,768
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

284
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:58,671
Detail... forward!

285
00:15:58,706 --> 00:15:59,503
Forward!

286
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,529
- Hyah!
- Ho!

287
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,240
(Cutter laughing)

288
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,617
CUTTER:
Hey, Charlie.

289
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:15,955
<i>This time don't go letting
them injuns get your scalp.</i>

290
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,220
(Cutter laughing)

291
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:26,030
(Cutter laughing)

292
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:27,231
You stand there laughing

293
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,233
like you just done
something great, Cutter.

294
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:32,271
But all you've done was
to mess up things real good.

295
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:35,107
It's working out
just the way I wanted, Buck.

296
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:36,574
And how do you make that?

297
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:39,078
We had a plan,
a plan to get the gold...

298
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:40,411
now we've got nothing.

299
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,516
I changed plans
for a better one.

300
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:45,583
We still get the gold.

301
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:48,109
Maybe you'd better tell us
what you got in mind.

302
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:51,656
Way it works out now,

303
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:54,760
I don't have to explain
me survivin'.

304
00:16:54,795 --> 00:16:57,830
They get lost,
sand covers everything,

305
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,665
ain't a trace of nothin' left,

306
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,069
and everybody figures it's
old Charlie Trent led 'em wrong.

307
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,941
You were gonna lead them
soldiers out into the desert.

308
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:11,375
What if this Charlie
takes 'em another way?

309
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,280
Them renegade bands down south
would like nothing better

310
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:16,716
than to get their hands
on that gold.

311
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:19,083
Cheyenne on
the warpath up north.

312
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:23,089
They got nowhere to go
but across that desert...

313
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:25,319
with us following 'em.

314
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,802
- Detail...
- Detail...

315
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:38,269
- halt!
- Halt!

316
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:48,614
- Forward!
- Forward!

317
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:51,242
- Ho!
- Yo!

318
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,955
Hyah!

319
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,981
Get out there!

320
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:25,951
- Detail...
- Detail...

321
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:27,942
- halt!
- Halt!

322
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:32,082
- Dismount!
- Dismount!

323
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:07,184
Looking for something, Charlie?

324
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,327
Oh-ho...

325
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:13,699
Oh, no, no, I wasn't
looking for nothin'. I...

326
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:16,068
- Just-Just lookin'.
- A bottle?

327
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:18,771
What bottle? Heh.

328
00:19:18,806 --> 00:19:20,471
(sighs)

329
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:21,996
You ain't gonna find it.

330
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:27,545
Hoss...

331
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,515
Hoss, that was all I had.

332
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,415
I... I didn't want to...

333
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,887
drink it, I just wanted
to know it was here, that's all.

334
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:38,345
I... I wasn't aimin'
to drink a drop of it.

335
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,111
I... I...

336
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:44,495
I promise.

337
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,691
Cross my heart.

338
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:51,067
I poured it out
this morning, Charlie.

339
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:57,476
I... I can't make it
without a drink, Hoss.

340
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:59,543
Hoss, I can't make it!

341
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:03,449
Charlie, you done made it almost
a week now, just on a pint.

342
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:05,317
Yeah, what we've
come through is nothing...

343
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:07,186
like taking a walk
down a boulevard

344
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:08,853
on a bright, sunshiny day.

345
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:11,056
You wait'll we get
across that there mountain

346
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:13,624
and hit the Great Salt Flats.

347
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:16,795
A man... a man's got to have
something in his insides

348
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,362
when he tackles that desert.

349
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:22,768
And you done took and poured my
insides right out on the ground.

350
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,134
Charlie...

351
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,571
you're just gonna have
to grow some new ones.

352
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:28,974
'Cause if you don't take us
across that desert,

353
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:31,033
we'll all gonna die
and rot out there.

354
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:35,514
All right, I'II...
I'll try, Hoss.

355
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:37,583
Honest, I'Il-I'll try.

356
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:39,574
Here.

357
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:43,255
You drink your coffee
and... quit worryin'.

358
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,654
You're gonna make it.

359
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:48,171
(spits)

360
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,917
I...

361
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,669
CUTTER:
My!

362
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:58,903
There they be.

363
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:02,465
Getting ready to bed down
like nice soldier boys.

364
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:06,110
Come dark, we gonna ride.

365
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:09,376
From here on out,
we stay ahead of 'em.

366
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,245
What's our line of march?

367
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,596
Uh... due east, Cap'n.

368
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,599
You see, once you hit
that there desert,

369
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,533
there ain't no landmarks
to guide you.

370
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:32,504
You have to kind of...
kind of sense things, you know?

371
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,605
Kind of... kind of
feel your way along.

372
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,977
Charlie, Charlie, that's
what we're depending on you for,

373
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:40,544
to take us to
that first water hole

374
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,664
in a two-day march...
and then after that,

375
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:44,750
you'll have to lead us
to the next water hole,

376
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:47,751
then on to the last one.

377
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:50,152
Can you do all that, Charlie?

378
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:57,428
I tell you what...
(anxious laugh)

379
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,681
I been, I been,
I been thinking it over,

380
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:01,909
and I reckon it
might be our best bet

381
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:04,208
to head due north, you see,
and that way

382
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:06,508
we can circle the desert
entirely, you see?

383
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:08,774
With Yellow Star
and the whole Cheyenne Nation

384
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:10,040
on the warpath?

385
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:11,108
Look, I didn't bring you along

386
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:12,578
to tell me how
to get us all killed.

387
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:14,545
We have to cross that desert.

388
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,783
Now, you signed on as a scout
to lead us over it.

389
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:19,182
Now, can you do it?

390
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,017
Me and Hoss'll lead out.

391
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:31,890
Prepare to move.

392
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,666
Prepare to mount!

393
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:42,174
- Forward!
- Forward!

394
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:44,074
- Ho!
- Ho!

395
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:08,400
You aimin'
to take 'em on tonight?

396
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:09,633
Nah.

397
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:10,834
(Cutter chuckles)

398
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,938
You ever see the Zunis hunt fox?

399
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:14,038
No.

400
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:15,939
Well, they just let 'em
keep on runnin'

401
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:18,477
till their tongues are all
swole up and hanging out.

402
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:20,746
Then they walk up to 'em
real peaceful like

403
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:23,881
and club 'em to death.
(laughs)

404
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,185
Yes, sir, we're gonna
let those soldier boys

405
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,218
just ride on a piece.

406
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:31,984
Far enough so there
ain't no way back.

407
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:08,861
Sort of like being
out on the ocean, ain't it?

408
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:11,562
Only difference is that...

409
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:14,760
we're looking for water
instead of land.

410
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:18,570
You got your
bearing yet, Charlie?

411
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:21,538
(wind whistling softly)

412
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:24,977
You don't... you don't reckon
we could've circled back

413
00:24:25,012 --> 00:24:27,279
on ourselves, do you,
and gotten lost?

414
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:29,195
No, no, no.

415
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,077
Of course not.

416
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,885
Ain't much daylight
left, Charlie,

417
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,890
and you said we'd sure find
that water hole before sundown.

418
00:24:37,925 --> 00:24:40,124
That there water hole
has got to be

419
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,928
within an hour's march
of here, I'm tellin' you.

420
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:45,062
You go back
and tell the cap'n.

421
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:47,299
And capt'n will bring them
soldiers of his'n

422
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:49,051
up here right away.

423
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:50,734
You sure, Charlie?

424
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:53,071
Sure?
No, of course I ain't sure.

425
00:24:53,106 --> 00:24:55,139
But I got to act like I was.

426
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:58,075
I got to fool them soldiers
into thinking I'm sure.

427
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,880
'Cause if just one man panics,
it'll spread like wildfire,

428
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:05,768
and we'll find ourselves
a bunch of buzzard bait.

429
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:09,621
You... You said you had faith
in me, didn't you?

430
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:11,257
(wind whistling)

431
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:12,823
Yes, sir, I do.

432
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:14,558
Well, hang on to it, son.

433
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:19,155
Hang on to it, 'cause that's
all I got to hang on to myself.

434
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:22,166
I'll tell 'em.

435
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:25,037
Ah. Now, when I find
that there water,

436
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:27,539
I'll fire three shots
in the air.

437
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:28,870
Yes, sir.

438
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,524
- Detail...
- Detail...

439
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:46,776
- halt!
- Whoa!

440
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:47,958
HOSS:
Captain.

441
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:50,294
- Dismount.
- Dismount!

442
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:53,457
Captain... just
a little piece further.

443
00:25:57,469 --> 00:26:01,038
I made a mistake trusting him.

444
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:04,543
I think it's time
we admit it... both of us,

445
00:26:04,578 --> 00:26:06,912
we're lost, and you know it.

446
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:09,046
Cap'n, you're wrong.

447
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:11,815
With the captain's permission.

448
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,083
Me and the men
would like the captain

449
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:16,316
to tell us straight out
how we stand.

450
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:21,091
Cap'n.

451
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:23,795
Men, you've got a right to know.

452
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,163
(gunshot in distance)

453
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:28,900
- (second gunshot)
- It's Charlie.

454
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:31,583
- (third gunshot)
- He found water!

455
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:34,231
(whooping,
excited chatter, laughter)

456
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:37,908
Prepare to mount!

457
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,024
(whistling, excited chatter)

458
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:42,106
- Mount the horses!
- Yee-haw!

459
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,552
Hyah!

460
00:26:47,587 --> 00:26:49,219
Forward!

461
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:51,388
- Hyah!
- Yo!

462
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,857
(excited shouts, whistling)

463
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:00,021
(whooping, excited shouts)

464
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,671
- CHARLIE: Cap'n! Ho! Ho!
- PENDER: Detail, halt!

465
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:06,937
CHARLIE:
Hold 'em back!

466
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:08,373
PENDER:
Master Sergeant, slow down!

467
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:10,340
(men clamoring)

468
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,377
CHARLIE:
Cap'n, hold your men back!

469
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:13,712
Keep your men back, Cap'n!

470
00:27:13,747 --> 00:27:14,978
Don't let 'em come here!

471
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:17,883
- I knew you'd find it, boy!
- (indistinct chatter)

472
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:20,183
(two gunshots)

473
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:22,743
- Detail, ten-hut!
- Detail!

474
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:26,723
What's wrong?

475
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:29,090
That there water's
been poisoned.

476
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:35,999
See that animal over there?

477
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:40,138
Yeah, well, the same thing'll
happen to any of us

478
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:41,867
that drinks this here water.

479
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:46,445
We don't need a scout
to find poison water for us!

480
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,797
Sergeant.

481
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,079
Yes, sir?

482
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,451
Move the detail
to that area up ahead.

483
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:54,751
Make camp.

484
00:27:54,786 --> 00:28:00,058
Issue half rations of water
to the men and the mules.

485
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:01,893
None to the mounts.

486
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:03,628
Detail...

487
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:05,328
forward.

488
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:11,570
All right, Charlie,
how far to the next water hole?

489
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:13,537
It's about a day's march.

490
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:17,075
But me nor nobody else
can say whether that water'll be

491
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,544
any more fittin'
to drink than this is.

492
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:21,444
Can you find it?

493
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:25,172
Found this one, didn't I?

494
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:36,660
What do you think, Cap'n?

495
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:40,062
We can make our water last
another full day.

496
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:44,701
We'll have to lose our mounts.

497
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:49,641
The mules can keep going
as long as they get some water.

498
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:50,874
(sighs)

499
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:53,361
You got to make
the decision, Cap'n.

500
00:28:53,396 --> 00:28:55,779
Well, if we turn around
and go back,

501
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:58,782
the men and the gold
will be saved, but...

502
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:02,220
if we go on up ahead
and that water's poisoned, too,

503
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,450
it'll be too late to turn back.

504
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,797
There's nothing in my orders
about turning back.

505
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:14,466
Charlie, we'll move out
just before dawn,

506
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:16,457
- while it's still cool.
- Yeah.

507
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,021
(grunts)

508
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,668
(grunts)

509
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,438
You're gonna poison
this one, too?

510
00:29:53,473 --> 00:29:55,257
That's what I'm gonna do, Buck.

511
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,568
They're liable
to get suspicious.

512
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:59,810
That don't make no difference.

513
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:03,814
Besides, they can't never
know just how it got done.

514
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,018
Now, go on, do like I told you,
start brushing out our tracks.

515
00:30:07,053 --> 00:30:08,251
Look, all we've been doing

516
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:09,886
is riding around
this miserable desert.

517
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:12,591
Now, I say we stay here
and finish off them soldiers.

518
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:14,524
All I want is
to split that gold,

519
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,862
and I got nothin' so far
but sun-baked.

520
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,962
Latigo?

521
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:20,730
I'll side with them.

522
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,368
BUCK: Now, them soldiers
have got to come here.

523
00:30:23,403 --> 00:30:25,302
All we got to do
is wait for 'em.

524
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:28,039
But if you feel you'd rather
not make the stand with us,

525
00:30:28,074 --> 00:30:29,408
you can clear out.

526
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:30,742
No hard feelings.

527
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:32,175
(laughs)

528
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,474
No hard feelings, huh?

529
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:38,066
Now, you listen to me,

530
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:39,950
every last one of you.

531
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:42,452
There ain't one of you
got a chance

532
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:46,651
of leaving these salt flats
alive less'n I lead ya.

533
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,729
(chuckles)

534
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:55,567
Now, where would
you ambush eight men

535
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:57,567
on flatlands like this?

536
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:59,703
But up ahead, there's places
where we can pull it off.

537
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:03,108
Now, go on, do like I told you,
start brushing out our tracks.

538
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:05,440
(Cutter coughs loudly)

539
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:33,364
(wind whistling softly)

540
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:42,440
It's poisoned.

541
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,583
(grunts)

542
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,853
- Kelly! - Kelly! Get out!
That water's poison!

543
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:50,187
- Kelly!
- Get out of there!

544
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:51,323
The water's poisoned!
The water's poisoned!

545
00:31:51,358 --> 00:31:52,222
Get out of there!

546
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:53,723
Have you lost your head?

547
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:56,127
The water's good!
It's not poisoned!

548
00:31:56,162 --> 00:31:58,496
- Let me have some more!
- Kelly! Kelly!

549
00:31:58,531 --> 00:32:00,332
You just drunk your death, man!

550
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:01,965
KELLY:
That water's good!

551
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,002
The water's good!
It's not poisoned!

552
00:32:04,037 --> 00:32:05,899
Stand back.

553
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:07,761
(Kelly panting)

554
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:11,509
Charlie...

555
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:13,143
make sure.

556
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:15,013
Test that water again.

557
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:16,813
No need to, Cap'n.

558
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:19,484
Kelly himself will prove
I was right.

559
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,850
You drunken old sot!

560
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:23,588
That belly is loaded with
so much poison now from liquor

561
00:32:23,623 --> 00:32:25,257
you don't know
what you're doing!

562
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:26,891
You took us where there's water!

563
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:29,891
You don't... (panting)

564
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:32,856
(gasping, screaming)

565
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:36,757
(screaming)

566
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:42,305
(gasping)

567
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,374
Sergeant, bring a canteen.

568
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:46,744
Ain't no use doing that, Cap'n.

569
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:49,080
He can't swallow none nohow.

570
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:50,682
(weak gasping breaths)

571
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,673
(breathing stops)

572
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:00,822
Move him over under the wagon
and cover him with a blanket.

573
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,650
It's four riders
and one spare horse,

574
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:11,870
all headed away from here
and riding fast

575
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:13,906
for the next water hole.

576
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:15,872
And poison that one, too.

577
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,431
- (howling in distance)
- Yeah.

578
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:21,544
Another thing, Cap'n...

579
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,915
only a scout would know
his way around here

580
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,405
like them bushwhackers
are doing.

581
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:30,383
A scout...
that would have to be Cutter.

582
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:35,827
We'll go ahead while
we still have some water left

583
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:37,729
and try to fight
our way through.

584
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:39,262
Eh, Cap'n...

585
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:42,067
Cap'n, there's rocks
around that there water hole.

586
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:44,334
Best place in the world
for ambush.

587
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:47,270
They'd pick us off
before we ever seen 'em.

588
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:50,241
We're not gonna stay here
and die, not without a fight.

589
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:52,010
You got an idea
better than that?

590
00:33:52,045 --> 00:33:53,310
Yeah. Yeah.

591
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:55,712
If they are still
at that water hole,

592
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:59,584
that water will be good
until after they finish us off.

593
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:01,953
That makes sense,
Charlie. Go on.

594
00:34:01,988 --> 00:34:03,453
CHARLIE:
Yeah, but...

595
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:05,924
we got to make sure
they are still there.

596
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:08,560
So when the moon sets,
I'll start out, see?

597
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:11,162
I should make it in...
oh, an hour or two.

598
00:34:11,197 --> 00:34:12,629
No, Charlie, no.

599
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:14,631
I'll go with some of my men.

600
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,802
Sergeant,
you and Johnson will go with me.

601
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,793
- Corporal...
- No, Cap'n.

602
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:23,808
(howling in distance)

603
00:34:23,843 --> 00:34:26,943
I'm, uh, I'm a scout.

604
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:30,148
I can do a better job alone.

605
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:32,115
All right, Charlie.

606
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,250
But after you
get there, what then?

607
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:38,623
Well, if they ain't there
and the water is still good,

608
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:41,157
I'll fire three shots.

609
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:44,396
No... No, Cutter may have
heard that signal before.

610
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:46,732
So this time
I'll fire three shots,

611
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:48,998
wait a while,
then fire two more.

612
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:51,669
And, Cap'n, when
you hear them five shots,

613
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:53,269
you come a-runnin'.

614
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:55,705
And if I don't hear
the five shots?

615
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,376
If you don't hear 'em,
you head due north.

616
00:34:58,411 --> 00:35:01,778
Forced march,
traveling by night.

617
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,349
And with any luck,
you ought to make the highlands

618
00:35:04,384 --> 00:35:06,649
and water in about two days.

619
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:10,037
Course, the, uh...
Cheyennes might be there, too.

620
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:13,391
Buy then maybe...
maybe it's better to be scalped

621
00:35:13,426 --> 00:35:14,692
than to die of thirst, huh?

622
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:15,681
(wry chuckle)

623
00:35:17,328 --> 00:35:19,159
(howling in distance)

624
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,670
I'm sorry I ever
doubted you, Charlie.

625
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:27,439
Oh, ho-ho...

626
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:28,571
Oh...

627
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:30,375
thank you, Cap'n.

628
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,637
Thank ye.

629
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:43,186
Well, bye, Hoss.

630
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:45,824
Charlie, when I promised
to come along on this deal,

631
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:47,190
I meant all the way.

632
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:49,125
No, no, you've done
enough for me already.

633
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,694
I just ain't worth it,
can't you understand that?

634
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:54,466
If you leave me here, I'II...
I'll just tag along after you.

635
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:56,685
Hoss, you ain't
a-comin' with me.

636
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,870
'Sides, I...
I travel faster alone.

637
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:01,471
Charlie...

638
00:36:01,506 --> 00:36:03,041
if I let
you go out there alone,

639
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:04,593
I'd feel guilty
the rest of my life.

640
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:06,110
That's better than
being dead, ain't it?

641
00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:08,078
You know better than that.

642
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,940
Yeah.

643
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:23,149
Five shots, right, Cap'n?

644
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:33,760
(wind whistling softly)

645
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,543
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

646
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:42,947
- There sure ain't
no sign of 'em. - Yeah.

647
00:36:42,982 --> 00:36:44,247
That don't mean those fellas

648
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:46,417
ain't up there hidin'
in them there rocks.

649
00:36:46,452 --> 00:36:47,717
- Well...
- I don't like it.

650
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,119
It just...
it just don't feel good.

651
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:53,123
We're gonna have to take
a chance on it anyhow.

652
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,960
Let's go.

653
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:59,486
All right,
but you be careful, son.

654
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:21,219
Dad-burnit, Charlie,
is it gonna take you all day

655
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:23,210
to make up your mind?

656
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:26,923
Ha! Whoo!

657
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:29,483
(whooping, shouting)

658
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,856
(both shouting happily)

659
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:39,203
- CHARLIE: Water!
- HOSS: Hola!

660
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:40,770
(Hoss whoops)

661
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:42,340
- (Hoss whoops)
- CHARLIE: Oh, boy!

662
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,306
Oh!

663
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:46,709
(Hoss whoops)

664
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:49,581
Now, ain't them
a happy pair of fools?

665
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:51,481
(Cutter laughs)

666
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:55,285
(laughing)

667
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,620
Drink your fill, boys.

668
00:37:57,655 --> 00:37:59,524
Then we're going to have
a nice, long talk

669
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,185
about my good friend
Cap'n Pender.

670
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:20,209
(blow thuds, Hoss groans)

671
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:22,313
Why didn't them soldier boys
come with you?

672
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:23,947
How many of them are there left?

673
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,416
I reckon that's something
you're going to have

674
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:26,849
to find out, mister.

675
00:38:26,884 --> 00:38:28,386
Well, that's something
I'm just going to find out.

676
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:30,555
Cutter!

677
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,655
(groans)

678
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,293
They're back
at the other water hole.

679
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:36,712
- Charlie!
- There's...

680
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,839
There's five of 'em.

681
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:40,897
One of 'em died.

682
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:43,067
They're waiting for my signal
to come on ahead.

683
00:38:43,102 --> 00:38:44,398
Charlie!

684
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:49,107
Cap'n Pender got
any suspicion of me?

685
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:51,142
No, course not.

686
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:52,108
(chuckles)

687
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:54,043
No, if, if we had
any suspicions,

688
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:56,981
you don't suppose that me
and Hoss would have come walking

689
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:58,781
in here the way we done, do you?

690
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,720
No, I reckon not,
being the scout you once was.

691
00:39:02,755 --> 00:39:03,914
What's that signal?

692
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:07,525
I ain't a-gonna tell you.

693
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,094
You ain't a-gonna tell me?

694
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:12,695
(laughs)

695
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,723
Hey, Latigo,
fetch me my saddlebag.

696
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:23,497
You ain't a-gonna tell me.

697
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:30,546
Charlie, this ought
to make you talk, huh?

698
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:33,850
(Cutter laughing)

699
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:35,852
It's all yours, Charlie,

700
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:37,789
you just tell me
what that signal is.

701
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:40,189
(Cutter laughing)

702
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:43,594
My, I bet you got mighty dry
for this, too.

703
00:39:43,629 --> 00:39:45,495
(inhales)
Mmm!

704
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,096
Smell it, Charlie, huh?

705
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:49,667
- (Charlie sniffs)
- What's the signal now, huh?

706
00:39:49,702 --> 00:39:50,702
Don't you tell him, Charlie.

707
00:39:50,737 --> 00:39:52,870
(Cutter laughs)

708
00:39:52,905 --> 00:39:55,571
Mmm!

709
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:58,409
That's too good
to waste on you, but...

710
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:00,729
(men chuckling)

711
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:02,473
(Charlie gasps)

712
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:04,182
Tastes good, huh?

713
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:05,448
Yeah.

714
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,016
What's the signal, Charlie?

715
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:09,387
And it's all yours,
every last bit of it.

716
00:40:09,422 --> 00:40:10,687
Signal?

717
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:14,524
Three sh... three sh...

718
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,027
- Louder, Charlie, louder.
- Three sh...

719
00:40:16,062 --> 00:40:17,293
Three shots.

720
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:19,330
Charlie! Charlie!

721
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:21,364
Three shots.

722
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:24,934
The signal is three shots,

723
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:28,189
and when,
when Pender hears them,

724
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:31,535
they'll move out
and join us here.

725
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,846
CUTTER:
Three shots, just like before.

726
00:40:34,881 --> 00:40:37,232
Well, I wanted to make sure.

727
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,584
Eh, just like before, huh?

728
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:41,619
Yeah, that's right.

729
00:40:41,654 --> 00:40:42,885
(laughs)

730
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,353
Hey, Buck, untie him.

731
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:53,197
What about him?

732
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:55,164
Ah, untie him.

733
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,099
He ain't going no place.

734
00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,903
(Charlie mutters raspily)

735
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:02,673
- Yeah, now...
- (Cutter laughing)

736
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,242
Now give it to me.

737
00:41:04,277 --> 00:41:05,742
Give it to me.

738
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:07,512
Here's your reward, Charlie.

739
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:09,979
(Cutter laughing)

740
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:12,715
Is it, is it all right, Hoss?

741
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,487
Yeah, I... I reckon you earned
that one, Charlie.

742
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:17,920
(Charlie chuckles)

743
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:21,392
This ought to bring 'em running
like a flock of dumb sheep.

744
00:41:21,427 --> 00:41:25,396
(three gunshots)

745
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:27,387
Three.

746
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:31,601
Go on, Charlie.

747
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:34,628
Just fire two more times.

748
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:40,461
Five shots, he said.

749
00:41:40,496 --> 00:41:42,450
He's trying to warn us.

750
00:41:42,485 --> 00:41:44,404
They run into trouble.

751
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,496
(Charlie chuckles)

752
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:04,268
We... We sure fooled 'em
that time, didn't we, huh?

753
00:42:04,303 --> 00:42:05,835
(mutters)

754
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,473
Cutter thought he was tormenting
me into telling the truth.

755
00:42:09,508 --> 00:42:10,673
(chuckles)

756
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:13,244
And all the time it was
Cutter himself that gives

757
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:17,415
the signal for Pender
to start moving north.

758
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,415
Yep, but...

759
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,351
they're gonna
find out in a minute.

760
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:25,957
When they do, they're liable
to be real mean, Charlie.

761
00:42:25,992 --> 00:42:28,187
Yeah, well, I, I...

762
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:34,699
You know... you know,
it's a funny thing.

763
00:42:34,734 --> 00:42:36,133
I got plenty
of this doggone stuff.

764
00:42:36,168 --> 00:42:37,568
I don't seem to want it.

765
00:42:37,603 --> 00:42:38,868
(chuckles)

766
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:43,441
You know, it kind of, uh,
kind of burns my insides.

767
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:45,432
LATIGO:
Hey, Cutter.

768
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:51,505
- Cutter.
- Look, here they come.

769
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,055
Three soldier boys.

770
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,647
Only three.

771
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:03,785
Ain't none of 'em Pender.

772
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:07,230
He's a smart one.

773
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:09,066
Maybe he figures
on going behind this butte

774
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:11,033
and having himself a look-see.

775
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:13,137
Hey, Latigo, you get up
on one of them rocks,

776
00:43:13,172 --> 00:43:14,403
keep your eyes peeled.

777
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:16,107
You let me know,
but don't you do no shootin'.

778
00:43:16,142 --> 00:43:17,972
You hear?

779
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:24,715
I... I guess the only reason
I drink the doggone stuff

780
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,884
is so that I can stop
remembering.

781
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:29,685
I just don't understand it.

782
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,923
That wasn't the signal
for them to come up here.

783
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:35,057
You see, Hoss, years ago,

784
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:38,229
I led a whole detachment
of cavalry

785
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:40,696
into a Kiowa trap.

786
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:44,268
They was all butchered
and they died cursing me.

787
00:43:44,303 --> 00:43:47,872
Wasn't your fault, Charlie.

788
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:49,138
Yeah?

789
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:51,841
That ain't good enough.

790
00:43:51,876 --> 00:43:56,147
Buck, you keep watching
that wagon.

791
00:43:56,182 --> 00:43:57,780
(blows)

792
00:43:57,815 --> 00:44:00,618
Morgan, you take those two
and you keep 'em out of sight.

793
00:44:00,653 --> 00:44:03,951
I may need the old man later,
to wave these on.

794
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:06,791
You two get over
behind those rocks,

795
00:44:06,826 --> 00:44:08,658
and don't try
to let 'em know we're here

796
00:44:08,693 --> 00:44:11,095
or I'll break this gun barrel
right over your heads.

797
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,086
Stay low!

798
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:16,832
In no time at all now,

799
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:19,529
we gonna be divvyin' up
that gold.

800
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:24,608
He must have spotted the others.

801
00:44:24,643 --> 00:44:26,044
Now, you stay here, Buck.

802
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,410
No shooting till I start it,

803
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:30,514
and you be mighty careful
how you go hitting them mules.

804
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:32,583
Two of 'em, coming from high up
and behind us.

805
00:44:32,618 --> 00:44:34,083
One of 'em's the captain.

806
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:35,685
Well, that makes it
easier for us.

807
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,189
We'll just let 'em sneak up
on us before we start shooting

808
00:44:38,224 --> 00:44:39,789
Come on.

809
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:41,759
We gotta do something, Hoss.
We gotta...

810
00:44:41,794 --> 00:44:44,193
Shut up!

811
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:50,796
Old man, don't be so hoggy
with that whiskey.

812
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,642
Fill that cup.

813
00:44:58,677 --> 00:45:00,633
Sure.

814
00:45:03,714 --> 00:45:06,183
Bring it over here.

815
00:45:06,218 --> 00:45:08,174
Careful.

816
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:16,520
(grunting)

817
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:23,065
Good work, Charlie.

818
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,802
You go get Buck,
I'm going after Cutter.

819
00:45:24,837 --> 00:45:25,791
Right.

820
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:35,534
Well, if they're down there,
they're not giving it away.

821
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:40,785
Let's go down to those
four big rocks down there.

822
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,386
- See 'em?
- Yeah.

823
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:44,377
I'll go first.

824
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:04,175
Doggone it,
I had him dead to rights.

825
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,574
We got him pinned down now.

826
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:08,271
We can blast him
out of there easy.

827
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:13,713
(gunfire)

828
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:33,002
(grunts)

829
00:46:34,004 --> 00:46:36,700
(gunfire continues in distance)

830
00:46:44,548 --> 00:46:46,182
(grunts)

831
00:46:46,217 --> 00:46:48,208
(gunfire continues in distance)

832
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:02,097
Cutter!

833
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:16,347
(gunfire continuing)

834
00:47:16,382 --> 00:47:17,336
(gunfire stops)

835
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,198
Hey, the wa... the water is good,
Cap'n; you can drink it.

836
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:36,467
Ah, it's just a crease, Charlie.

837
00:47:36,502 --> 00:47:38,836
Hey, Corporal!

838
00:47:38,871 --> 00:47:40,136
Corporal!

839
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:42,740
Bring up the wagon!

840
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:45,309
Get yourselves a drink!

841
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:47,210
Yee-ha!

842
00:47:47,245 --> 00:47:49,076
Ha-hoo!

843
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:52,414
Hyah!

844
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:53,746
("Taps" playing)

845
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:09,365
Detail, atten-hut!

846
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:22,446
Scout... lead us out.

847
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:24,880
Sure, Cap'n.

848
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:28,819
- Detail!
- Detail!

849
00:48:28,854 --> 00:48:30,821
- Forward!
- Forward!

850
00:48:30,856 --> 00:48:32,812
Ho!
