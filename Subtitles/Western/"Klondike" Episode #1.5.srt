There ain't nothing noble in a fight.

183
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:50,192
Only in survival.

184
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,697
You go.

185
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,950
You get out while you can.

186
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:11,547
[Sighs]

187
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:16,585
I don't want to see you again, Bill.

188
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:19,120
Not with that look on your face.

189
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:55,256
Count: No need.

190
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:56,841
I just came to pay my respects.

191
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:01,513
You're dying, right?

192
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:04,099
I fail to see what that
has to do with anything.

193
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,267
[Coughs]

194
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,886
Oh.

195
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,688
Typhus is a bitch, isn't it?

196
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:16,361
You know, this is just a wooden box.

197
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:20,198
You shouldn't have let me kill you over it.

198
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:22,868
You are genuinely insane, aren't you?

199
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,519
Probably.

200
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:28,123
You remember over by the cemetery,

201
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:32,161
and you told me that I was a
dead man and not just in this life?

202
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:36,664
And that you, you said... you were saved?

203
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,835
[Coughs]

204
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:41,836
You know, you genuinely believed

205
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:44,840
that your God was gonna
protect you from the typhus.

206
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:48,259
So I figured I was gonna win both ways.

207
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:52,681
Either you would somehow impossibly survive

208
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:55,900
and then I'd have proof
that your God exists or...

209
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,721
You'd end up just as you are now.

210
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:02,390
I killed you.

211
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:03,942
I didn't even have to fire a shot.

212
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:08,062
So you're convinced that
you've brought this down on me.

213
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:11,616
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

214
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:17,755
So, your God should just
strike me down right here.

215
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:18,907
Right?

216
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:23,879
A bolt of lightning from the heavens.

217
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,130
No?

218
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,750
Nothing.

219
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:35,590
This is all there is, Father.

220
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:38,277
There's only this life.

221
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:42,596
Soapy: [Muffled] Your
hands are shaking, dentist.

222
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:47,568
Is it fear or distaste?

223
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:50,706
Might I ask where you practiced?

224
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:53,491
I don't practice. I just do.

225
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:55,543
My Father was a practitioner.

226
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,546
I learned from watching him.

227
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:58,998
I hope you took notes.

228
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,966
I'm an important man, you know.

229
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:08,257
I own 12 mines, all being
worked by their former owners.

230
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:09,842
You've had good fortune.

231
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:13,228
Fortune's got nothing to do with it.

232
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:20,903
Fortune's a bitch.

233
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:24,772
Trick is to look for present-day 'tunities

234
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:27,276
and grab those 'tunities when they come.

235
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,144
And I just grabbed one.

236
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,115
We're cleaning up Dawson, Soapy.

237
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:36,335
That means we're cleaning you up.

238
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:37,952
How's that, now?

239
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:40,955
I'm just a law-abiding citizen,

240
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,424
a businessman just looking for 'tunities.

241
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:46,677
'Tunities like buying up real claims

242
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,681

243
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:52,384
"Lawson City."

244

Could kill that printer.

245
00:17:54,137 --> 00:17:56,471
I'm trying to find out
where those claims are going.

246
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:58,640
The good news is, you're
gonna tell me. Get up.

I'm a bigger man than you, Superintendent.

You're gonna see that.

252
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,825
The world works in mysterious ways.

253
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:21,462
I am a bigger man than you.

- Howdy.
- Man: New blankets?

255

Belinda: Why haven't the men been working?

257
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:39,815
We've got money to pay them.

258
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:41,383
It's not about the money.

259
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:43,818
It's about fear.

260
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,354
Laborers can't work on the hotel

261
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:47,388
because the Count's
men are leaning on them.

262
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,031
God damn it.

[Sighs]

264
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:20,939
It's bad enough for a
woman to be alone at night.

265
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:25,978
Even worse if she's carrying money.

266
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,262
You could kill me right now.

267
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:32,099
But the way I look at it,

268
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:36,204
you don't need a one-off,
living hand-to-mouth,

269
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,440
shivering in the night
for another man's agenda.

270
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,444
Which is exactly what
you're doing for the Count.

271
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:46,714
I can offer you a steady cash flow.

272
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:50,501
Regular employment.

273
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:54,556
That right there will
cover you for three weeks,

274
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:57,593
which is about three weeks
more than the Count's offering.

275

[Dog barking in distance]

276
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:01,563
There will be more to come.

277
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:07,318
You don't just switch jobs
with a man like the Count.

278
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,489
You're the one with the gun.

279
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,406
You can do whatever you want.

280
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,361
With him, he'll just get more men.

281
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:20,981
I get the feeling

282
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:23,535
there's an idea percolating
somewhere in there.

283
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:28,656
We terminate the man...

I want you to work for me.

I do not want you to kill him.

Well...

288
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:46,642
that's what it's gonna take.

289
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:49,111
I won't pay for murder.

290
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:50,979
I won't do that.

sooner or later, lady.

Oh, and incidentally, you're
to release Soapy Smith, as well.

Soapy Smith is a documented con man.

305

These mining camps you see around you?

306

They're just scraping at the gold.

307

In a few months, real

Nothing.
