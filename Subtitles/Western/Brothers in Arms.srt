1
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,791
Faster, faster.

2
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,462
How the hell are you?

3
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,070
Get off that saddle, right now.

4
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,183
That's my little brother.

5
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,686
I promised Mom I would always
protect him...

6
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,725
...but I had a feeling this one
was gonna be different.

7
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,821
Something was telling me,
this time...

8
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,558
...one of us wasn't gonna
make it back home.

9
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,409
- How long we gotta be out here?
- Long as it takes, little brother.

10
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,318
Till we know that place
like the back of your hand.

11
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,317
I hate this part.

12
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,652
Look, it ain't no action, man.

13
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,494
You gonna get plenty soon enough.

14
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,098
What about the others?

15
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,937
Don't worry, they'll be here.

16
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,471
My friend, the reverend.

17
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:44,480
Some say he found God
after the devil rejected him.

18
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,833
Who are you?

19
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,704
Born of the dust,
I was made in his image.

20
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:26,319
The gentleman thief, Kansas.

21
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,289
He was my wild card.

22
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,502
Full house, gentlemen.

23
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,904
No.

24
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,168
I don't never lose...

25
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,040
...especially to no thief.

26
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,888
Gentlemen...

27
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,895
- Somebody get the sheriff.
- Get him yourself.

28
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,999
But there was one more.

29
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,939
To do this job, I had to find Mara.

30
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,344
It wasn't hard.
She was still up to her old tricks.

31
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,384
What the hell?

32
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,579
What the hell's the matter
with you, Indian?

33
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,358
I don't think this squaw
speaks no English.

34
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,896
Coin?

35
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,533
She thinks she's gonna rob us.

36
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,807
Be prepared to meet
your maker, savage.

37
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,495
Oh, boy.

38
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,267
We don't take kindly
to your type around here.

39
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,673
And what type would that be?

40
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,606
Sneaky lowlife niggers
like yourselves.

41
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,116
- Now you done gone and did it.
- Done what?

42
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,746
Done gone and made him mad.

43
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,755
See, he don't like blacks
calling other blacks niggers.

44
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,792
Boy, you kidding me?

45
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,967
There's six of us and two of you.

46
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,374
You know, you right,
and that don't seem fair, do it?

47
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,139
So you wanna run off
and get some more men?

48
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,983
Kill him.

49
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,314
Kill him!

50
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,724
Looks like game's over,
huh, fancy pants?

51
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,728
Now, that wasn't very
gentleman-like, was it?

52
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,398
Come on.

53
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,634
Looks like we got ourselves a real
Mexican standoff now, don't we?

54
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,302
Well, since I'm a gambling man,
I'm betting on me.

55
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,578
Damn it, woman!

56
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,756
Brother Willoby.

57
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,291
You're not taking the Lord's
name in vain, are you?

58
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,032
No.

59
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,429
For a preacher man...

60
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,834
...you sure hang out
with a motley crew.

61
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,701
A hustler...

62
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,603
...and a half-breed.

63
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:50,107
Only the Lord may judge,
Brother Willoby.

64
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,682
I merely tend to the flock.

65
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,876
Well, you're okay with me.

66
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,949
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.

67
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,624
Thought you two got out
of the game.

68
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,660
Hell, you know me.

69
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,162
I get bored easy.

70
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,465
- How's tricks?
- I suppose you ought to ask Mara.

71
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:17,007
I must admit, I was intrigued
when I received your letter.

72
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,239
We all were.

73
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,778
Zane and I wouldn't have bothered
if it wasn't worth it.

74
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,007
Who's that?

75
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:31,445
This here is my friend,
medicine man.

76
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,517
His Christian name is Jacob.

77
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,958
His heathen name is Running Fox.

78
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,722
No offense to present company.

79
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,375
We met up at Doc Willoby's cabin.

80
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,445
I called, and they answered.

81
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,482
This gang is like family...

82
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,379
...and family don't ask questions.

83
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,947
There wasn't much in it for them,
and they knew that.

84
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,323
This job was personal.

85
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:13,624
This time, it was about me
and my brother.

86
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,365
Okay, guys, this is our next job.

87
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,941
Zane got this from
a former bank associate...

88
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,977
...who will no longer be needing it.

89
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,713
Town's name is
Corazón de la Muerte...

90
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,352
...which means "heart of death,"
about a half day's ride from here.

91
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,254
Yeah, the bank's a depository
for the railroad.

92
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,357
Railroad?

93
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,491
That means a lot of money.

94
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,963
It also means a lot of guns,
which means a lot of bullets...

95
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,760
...and a lot of dead.

96
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,632
So we're gonna come in
in twos, split.

97
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,431
I'm gonna take the point.

98
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,632
Kansas, I need you back here.

99
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,641
Mara, by this window.

100
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:06,080
As usual, fear is in our favor.
Let's keep it that way.

101
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,948
But why this bank?

102
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,588
Because it belongs to him.

103
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,005
Well...

104
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,002
...get on with it.

105
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,886
It's official, Mr. Driscoll.
You now effectively own the bank.

106
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,025
Like everything else in this town.

107
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,424
I get what I pay for.

108
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,162
Is there something else?

109
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,173
Yeah- Mr. Driscoll, the ch-

110
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,675
The chamber of commerce feel
that the taxes...

111
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,371
...well, they're too exacerbated.

112
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,383
Tell me, Mr. Mayor.

113
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,885
Where would this town be without
my protection and investments?

114
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:25,326
You think I like this
godforsaken shithole?

115
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,591
This town is like any other town
I've brought up:

116
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,261
Purely a means to an end.

117
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,446
There, you see?

118
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,320
My son, Bert.

119
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,120
My pride and joy.

120
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,216
A fine, upstanding citizen.

121
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,027
He's a good-for-nothing asshole.

122
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,665
But he's my son.
What's a man to do?

123
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,098
Groom him to be my successor,
that's what.

124
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,069
I'll tell you what, Crawley...

125
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,910
...Bert would make a great mayor.

126
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,608
Now, wait a minute, that's my-

127
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:23,986
No one's got a job unless I allow it.

128
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,017
Is that clear to everyone?

129
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,491
- Absolutely clear, Mr. Driscoll, yes.
- Yes. Absolutely.

130
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,361
He owns everything.

131
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,229
May as well change the name
of the town to Driscollville.

132
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,172
Asshole.

133
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,239
No.

134
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,658
Somebody stop him.

135
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,700
Sheriff. Sheriff, there's trouble.

136
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,505
Please, it's my ma.
They're gonna kill her.

137
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,560
Leave her alone.

138
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,627
Come on.

139
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,203
Stop.

140
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,275
Ma.

141
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,140
Ma?

142
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,277
Ma.

143
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,414
Ma!

144
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,645
Ma.

145
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,590
Come on, we're out of here.

146
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,355
- Damn you, Bert.
- I ain't doing it for you now, all right?

147
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,556
- There ain't no call for this.
- It ain't none of your business.

148
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,637
You messed up, hear?
You can't touch me, you know.

149
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,363
Just go away, okay? Go away.

150
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,432
Come on, boys,
drinks on the house.

151
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,383
Take her to the undertaker.

152
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,463
Hey, sheriff, can I ask you
a question?

153
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,132
Shoot.

154
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,330
I mean, this piece of crap town...

155
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:29,132
...nobody cares about it.
Why do you care?

156
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,114
Are you all right, sir?

157
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,651
I would like to make
a considerable deposit...

158
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,951
...into your...

159
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,685
...fine establishment.

160
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,794
Of course.

161
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,829
However...

162
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,094
...I was wondering,
for my own piece of mind...

163
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,533
...when would the railroads
be coming through...

164
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,003
...to pick up the deposits?

165
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,471
I'm not allowed to give out
that kind of information.

166
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,878
You'd have to speak with the bank
manager, Mr. Hickle, about that.

167
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,682
You know, being that
there are all sorts...

168
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,827
...of unsavory types lurking about...

169
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:27,489
...dealing with folks such as ourselves
is a much more...

170
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,532
...pleasant situation.

171
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,636
Catch my meaning?

172
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:48,844
Much obliged, Miss Lorelie.

173
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,117
What-?
But what about your deposit?

174
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,356
I have some other matters
to attend to.

175
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:12,702
Just two ships merely passing
in the night.

176
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,658
- Bert.
- Yo, Pop.

177
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,858
Why are we still here?

178
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,865
I mean, what are we doing?

179
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,237
For now...

180
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,872
...this is our town, Bert.

181
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,841
Our town makes me sick.

182
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,017
I've changed the name.

183
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,187
Make us more at home.

184
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,388
Every father, Bert...

185
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,093
...lives in the dream...

186
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,236
...that his child will be
greater than himself.

187
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,566
That he will surpass him...

188
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:20,575
...not just in material things...

189
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:26,911
...but will in time come to show
more compassion...

190
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,680
...more love, patience...

191
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,423
...than I have been able to show.

192
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,921
Every day...

193
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,269
...you make me lose faith
in that dream.

194
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,988
- What will it be, gents?
- Whiskey all around.

195
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,329
Do you think this a prudent idea?

196
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,769
We gotta wet our whistles
before we hit the trail.

197
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,569
What if somebody recognizes us?

198
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,575
Ain't nobody gonna recognize us.

199
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,083
How you wanna do this?

200
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:24,900
We're gonna drink up, walk out
and right out of town.

201
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,162
He's right there.

202
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,805
If we cause a scene,
we're gonna blow the job.

203
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,542
Fuck that job.

204
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,948
Easy now, little brother.

205
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,353
Give me the bottle.

206
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,323
Shall I put that on your tab,
Mr. Driscoll?

207
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,432
On his tab?
Don't you know who his daddy is?

208
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,501
No tab.
My old man owns this joint.

209
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,295
Go away.

210
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,434
I don't pay.

211
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,670
Everybody gotta pay.

212
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,779
You say, every-?
What? What was that?

213
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,975
Everybody gotta pay?

214
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,423
- I said, you gonna pay.
- I know you, boy?

215
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,456
I said, do I know you, boy?

216
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,861
I'm sure you remember me.

217
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,934
No, don't remember you.

218
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,871
No. Refresh my memory, huh?

219
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,264
Burned our farm.

220
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,345
Murdered our kin.

221
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,116
You know, I do a lot of that.

222
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,618
You can't expect me
to remember every farm I burn.

223
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,281
Little place south of Flat Ridge.

224
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,324
Came between you
and your railroad.

225
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,088
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I remember that one.

226
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,528
Yeah, a lot of screaming.
I mean, what, did you run away?

227
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,202
Did you run off
and leave your family?

228
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,203
Don't worry about it.

229
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,408
You should never assume
a man is dead...

230
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,268
...just because you shot him.

231
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,507
That's good advice.

232
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,377
I'll remember that next time.

233
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,685
Ain't no next time.

234
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,290
Hell.

235
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,722
I'm sorry, Mr. Driscoll, I...

236
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,697
I'm sorry that...

237
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,699
You were here.

238
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,972
Did you see them?
Did you see who killed my son?

239
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,235
I'm afraid not.

240
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,316
No one...

241
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:31,120
...but no one, crosses a Driscoll
and lives to tell about it.

242
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,489
Get me Wolverton.

243
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,096
- What were you thinking?
- He had it coming.

244
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,398
They saw us. Our cover is blown.

245
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,302
We can't go back there now.

246
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,674
It could have gone better.

247
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,347
Maybe we could use this
to our advantage.

248
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,149
What you thinking?

249
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,748
The last thing they're gonna expect is
for us to come back and hit the bank.

250
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,725
Right. Because it's suicide.

251
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,657
You serious?
I thought he was the crazy one.

252
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,892
Hey, man, don't call me that.

253
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,035
What did you learn at the bank?

254
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:28,576
Well, the payroll is scheduled
to be picked up at noon.

255
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:34,245
A quarter of a million dollars
the day after tomorrow.

256
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,350
You better be playing that
when he gets up.

257
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,515
Take a few men out back.

258
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,951
Don't let anybody get past,
you hear me? Now go.

259
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,354
Yes, yes, uncle.
You, you. Come here.

260
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,358
Surround.

261
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,429
Fire.

262
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,816
Everybody stay down!

263
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,390
- Longcoats!
- No shit.

264
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,323
- Stay down! Stay down!
- Shit!

265
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,899
Man, shut up, we done been
in tougher scrapes than this before.

266
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,630
- Let's go!
- I think we overstayed our welcome.

267
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,442
Run for it, baby!

268
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,237
I swear to God, if I get killed...

269
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,473
...my ghost gonna come back
and bust your ass.

270
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,047
Cover me now.

271
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,011
I'm going out.

272
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,363
Go! Go!

273
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,511
Hey, why did you stop me?

274
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,846
Why did you stop me?

275
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,519
- It was him!
- Who?

276
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,214
Wolverton.

277
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,724
Anybody hurt?

278
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,596
Okay. These longcoats
are like wild coyotes.

279
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,428
- Once they get their teeth into you-
- Hey. What's the plan?

280
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,336
Mara knows these parts
better than anyone.

281
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,469
- I know a spot.
- Okay, lead on.

282
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,073
Come on.

283
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,152
I thought I told you
to watch the back.

284
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,689
- Uncle, I did.
- I told you, nobody gets by.

285
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,589
Uncle Wolverton, I tried.
I swear to you, I tried.

286
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,093
There was a guy in a tree.
We never saw him.

287
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,391
He froze.

288
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,234
- No.
- It's all right.

289
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,337
It's all right.

290
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,070
We're still gonna get them.

291
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,306
And you're my favorite nephew.

292
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,816
Now let's mount up.
I want that bounty.

293
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,359
- I take first watch.
- Sure you're up to it?

294
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,094
Oh, yeah.

295
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,206
All right, then,
I'll sleep good for a change.

296
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,807
Come on.

297
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,031
Spill the beans, Rev.

298
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,756
Come on, Rev, give it up.

299
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,197
- Tell us about Mara.
- What's it like?

300
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:29,305
Flesh of my flesh,
bone of my bones.

301
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,668
Come on, man, with that.

302
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,106
Half black, half Indian?

303
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,576
Come on. That must be real sweet.

304
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,578
Must be great.

305
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:43,277
It's like finding a cactus flower
among sagebrush.

306
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,080
What the hell?

307
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,654
What the-?

308
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,416
Hey, you gotta go find it, you know?

309
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:54,788
- She's messing up my duds.
- And a cactus has thorns.

310
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,091
She's a wild one.

311
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:06,210
When we hit that bank,
we have to go by the book.

312
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,205
Not that book.

313
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,180
Nobody gets hurt.

314
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,682
We get what we want,
and we get out, clear?

315
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,919
I got your back.

316
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,951
And everything should go off
without a hitch.

317
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,429
Couldn't keep your mouth shut.

318
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,641
Please, May, this is official.

319
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,606
Yes, good afternoon, sheriff.
Greetings.

320
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,409
How are you feeling this fine day?

321
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,318
Well, I was-

322
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,855
- We were wondering that-
- For heaven's sake, get to the point!

323
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,523
Yes, dear.

324
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,389
Well, it's about
this rampant violence.

325
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,929
Something's gotta be done about it.

326
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,967
- We can get rid of it today.
- We can?

327
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,998
Yep.

328
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,810
With a million dollars
and the 7th Cavalry.

329
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,913
No disrespect intended, sheriff.

330
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:58,384
If I do say so, you are handling
your duties magnificently...

331
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,524
...and as mayor-
Oh, I've got a hole in my coat.

332
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:05,856
- As mayor of Corazón de la-
- Driscollville.

333
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,863
Driscollville, it is my responsibility
to ensure...

334
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:14,026
...that you have whatever you need to
do your job to the best of your ability.

335
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,340
All I need is one thing, mayor.

336
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,669
What might that be?

337
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,877
More bullets.

338
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:28,146
Bullets? More-?
More bullets.

339
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:32,152
- Good afternoon, sheriff.
- Mayor.

340
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,227
- Tell me you got them.
- Not yet, sir.

341
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,460
Excuses are a dime a dozen...

342
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,900
...and not worth a plugged nickel.

343
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,505
Mr. Driscoll...

344
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,701
...a man's reputation is everything.

345
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,210
I've collected every bounty
I've ever gone after.

346
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,245
This here gonna be no different.

347
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,186
Now...

348
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,286
...there's been a change in plans.

349
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,117
Yes, may I help you?

350
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,122
Me and my men are here to pick up
the payroll early.

351
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,130
This is highly irregular.

352
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,963
Orders straight from Mr. Driscoll.

353
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,661
I see. How early?

354
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,839
First thing in the morning.

355
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,241
Fine.

356
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,898
Okay, as soon as we come in,
Zane, you handle the guards.

357
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,436
Don't kill anybody unless you got to.

358
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,803
Mara, if we need a blast,
you got us covered?

359
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,705
I got it.

360
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:12,744
Okay. Rev, you handle the tellers
and any customers.

361
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,515
Kansas, we need you to cover
this window right here.

362
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,350
Make sure nobody joins
our little party.

363
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,657
If we do this right...

364
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,328
...we all walk out rich bastards.

365
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,456
And if we don't?

366
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,727
Then lunch is on you tomorrow.

367
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,404
Okay. Enough talk.

368
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,635
Let's play some music.

369
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,643
I like that.

370
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,110
They'll never see us.

371
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:46,841
Hey.

372
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,837
Tight britches.

373
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,647
Why you always fiddling
with them playing cards, huh?

374
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:01,355
Because they help sharpen
the reflexes, madame.

375
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,857
What you call me?

376
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,857
You trying to say something
about my past?

377
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,328
- That's not what he meant.
- No, I heard him.

378
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:13,936
Anybody ever see
such a pretty cowboy?

379
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,032
I think Kansas here
is one of them dandies.

380
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,038
That's enough, Mara.

381
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,180
That's why you wear them gloves?

382
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,147
Why are you dressed like that
anyway?

383
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,555
You think you better than us
or something?

384
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,392
- Mara.
- Is that why you wear them...

385
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,062
...Pollyanna gloves?

386
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,597
Yeah. I wanna know why.

387
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,461
Okay.

388
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,446
That's why.

389
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,352
I used to be a painter.

390
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,090
I had myself a little gallery.

391
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:16,824
That is, before the Klan
paid me a visit.

392
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,530
I lost everything.

393
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:25,999
Kansas...

394
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,839
I tracked all of them down,
one by one.

395
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,082
Law's been looking for me
ever since.

396
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,617
I swore that, no matter what...

397
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,357
...in the end...

398
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,694
...I shall be holding the cards.

399
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,942
Why are you still awake?

400
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,183
You know I'm always psyched
before a job.

401
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,519
What the hell?

402
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:57,290
Man, that is one
strange-ass couple.

403
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,436
- A reverend-
- And a soiled dove.

404
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,001
Oh, yeah, baby.

405
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,700
How the hell they hook up anyway?

406
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:09,873
She didn't have it easy.

407
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,414
A woman of leisure...

408
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,608
...who was nearly whipped to death
by her master.

409
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,047
And the rev...

410
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,519
...he was the preacher
up at Lone Pine...

411
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,016
...the place of the massacre.

412
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,525
He was forced to watch
his wife and child killed...

413
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,287
...right in front of him.

414
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:32,561
That night, he lost his faith.

415
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,962
Who could do something like that?

416
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,936
That low-down, dirty Wolverton.

417
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,876
I'm glad Mom can't see us now.

418
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,712
Hey.

419
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,984
We doing all this for Mom,
remember?

420
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,962
Yeah...

421
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,564
...but this gotta be the last one.

422
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,501
We gotta get back home.

423
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,100
All we got is each other,
little brother.

424
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,849
I'm gonna catch some shuteye.
You should do the same.

425
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,872
Lost something?

426
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,544
I'm sure Mara didn't mean anything.

427
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,479
She was just riding you.

428
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,619
But I ain't a horse.

429
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,754
No, not, of course.

430
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,756
A Midsummer Night's Dream.

431
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,423
Lovers and madmen
have such seething brains.

432
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:14,026
That's Mr. William Shakespeare.

433
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,102
Shakespeare's dreams.

434
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,841
I got nightmares too.

435
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,404
Except they're with me
when I wake up.

436
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,951
This town, Corazón...

437
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,752
...think it's gonna be one of them.

438
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,763
The big score,
the chance to cash out.

439
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,435
I just wanna get out
of this life alive.

440
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:46,380
No. They're headed back
to Corazón.

441
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,856
It may be a shithole, but it's the only
shithole between here and the border.

442
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:55,120
I got a feeling they got business there.
Come on! Come on!

443
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,327
Nobody move!

444
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:37,265
Touch it, and you got two choices:
die slow or die slower.

445
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,006
I don't wanna die. I don't.

446
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,147
You move, I slice your throat.

447
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,284
You smarter than you look.
Let's move it!

448
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,282
What is the meaning of this?

449
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,820
- Ain't you ever been robbed before?
- I have not.

450
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,355
Little brother,
we got us here a virgin.

451
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,927
Congratulations,
you just got your cherry popped.

452
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,154
Now move it!

453
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,633
Merciful is the Lord.
Cooperate, and no one gets hurt.

454
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,316
Come on, come on.

455
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,743
Back the fuck up.

456
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,677
Come on, open it up!

457
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,152
Don't rush me.
I can't get it in the hole.

458
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,985
- Man, open the door.
- We ain't asking.

459
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:34,323
- We're rich.
- Hurry up!

460
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,127
Come get this money, y'all!

461
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,635
Jackpot!

462
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,607
Turn around!

463
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:55,785
Now, if anybody peeps,
I'm gonna blow your heads off.

464
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:00,983
Come on!

465
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,397
What the hell is this?

466
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,432
- Get down!
- Come on. Back in the bank!

467
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:24,143
- Cover for me!
- Let's go, let's go. Back in the bank!

468
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,047
Back inside!

469
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,883
Get everyone.

470
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,126
Damn. Where they come from?

471
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,828
They came a lot earlier
than we thought they would.

472
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,298
- No shit.
- Relax. We're gonna get out.

473
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,036
- How?
- Linc, how?

474
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,041
- You, come here.
- Me? But-

475
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,574
Shut up, I ain't got time.
Where's the back exit?

476
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,837
There isn't one.

477
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,243
What about the motherfucking
back window?

478
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:04,185
From the looks of things,
they thought of that too.

479
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,115
You, come here.

480
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,925
Linc, did we fuck up?

481
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,819
No.

482
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,195
I fucked up.

483
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:14,553
I guess we stay down.
Just don't hurt us.

484
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,486
I say we blast our way out.

485
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:22,025
Hey, as hot as you are, missy,
you shouldn't be working that there.

486
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,163
Look, we got hostages.

487
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,427
Why don't we use them as shields.

488
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,434
Hold on.
We're not using the hostages.

489
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:33,240
- Why not?
- Because they're innocent, that's why.

490
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,741
No one is innocent.

491
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,906
- I'm getting the fuck out of here.
- Mara, wait.

492
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:44,610
The longer we stay in here,
the more men they get out there.

493
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,724
What we gonna do?

494
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:13,749
I need a drink.

495
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,015
- We're gonna go with Mara's idea.
- About?

496
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,122
- We gotta use the hostages.
- Linc.

497
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,757
We have no choice.

498
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,664
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get in there!

499
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,137
Come on, move it! Move it!

500
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,207
Move it!

501
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,381
Wait.

502
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,486
You hear that?

503
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,922
I don't hear nothing.

504
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,065
They just realized we got hostages.

505
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,090
They're waiting for our next move.

506
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,299
They're never gonna talk to us.

507
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,646
I don't trust Mara
with all this hostage shit.

508
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:33,384
Don't worry about her. I got that.

509
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,630
Remember what Mom used to tell
us when we were kids?

510
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,263
Yeah.

511
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,372
The only way you don't get into
the Lord's gates...

512
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,100
...is when you harm the innocent.

513
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,343
I think I wanna go to heaven
someday.

514
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,847
Yeah.

515
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,957
Hope it's not too soon.

516
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,507
Sheriff...

517
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,842
...you better end this quick, or I will.

518
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,045
Lincoln Malone.

519
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,495
I think they wish to talk.

520
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,999
Lincoln Malone.

521
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,876
Why is she only asking for you?

522
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:58,041
- I'm going out.
- Linc.

523
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,646
What's going on?

524
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,647
I know her.

525
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,247
All right. We can get her
out in the open...

526
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,226
- ... and then plug her full of bullets.
- Anybody shoot her, they die.

527
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,165
We're on the same team here,
remember?

528
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:22,233
Linc, go handle your business.

529
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,637
We'll cover you.

530
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,994
- You sure about this, sheriff?
- Yep, I'll be okay.

531
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,824
How you know that?

532
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:52,934
I just do.
Nobody shoot, okay? Got it?

533
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,229
- Make sure of it.
- All right, but I still...

534
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,065
...don't think it's a good idea.

535
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,808
Hola, Lincoln.

536
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,897
I never stopped loving you...

537
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:31,563
...even when you chose
my best friend over me.

538
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,906
All those stories
I heard about you...

539
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,848
...are they true?

540
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,881
That's not the man I knew.

541
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,590
The man you knew
died a long time ago.

542
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,028
Come in with me.

543
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,360
It's the best way.

544
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,934
To what, a pine box?

545
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,542
Hangman's rope?

546
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,379
Not even you could stop this.

547
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,347
Damn. Why did you
come back here?

548
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:33,096
Those criminals killed my son...

549
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,464
...and now they've got my money.

550
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,234
And my bounty.

551
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,606
What are we gonna do?

552
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:45,270
Go in there and flush them out
like the weasels they are.

553
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,278
Wolverton...

554
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:48,882
...gather the men.

555
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,618
You know this is gonna
end bad, right?

556
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,488
And I thought I was lucky.

557
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,161
Not lucky, just good.

558
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:01,713
Who fired that shot?

559
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,221
It wasn't us, sheriff.

560
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:06,486
I mean, honest.
It must have came from the back.

561
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,926
We need to talk.

562
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:12,226
- Mr. Driscoll-
- Now.

563
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,726
What you think they doing
out there?

564
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,440
Fortifying their position.

565
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:56,003
Making preparations
for the final assault.

566
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:58,941
How you know?

567
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,079
Because...

568
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,186
...that's what I would do.

569
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,301
Hey.

570
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,700
- Where you going?
- I've been appointed...

571
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,534
...to speak for the group.

572
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,769
- How come?
- I'm the mayor's wife.

573
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:35,944
Is that so?

574
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,822
I'm a little claustrophobic.
Can we come out?

575
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,830
Yeah, come out.

576
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,266
Thank you.

577
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,641
A queen for a queen.

578
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,029
Shut this kid up...

579
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,927
...or else I'll shut him up for good.

580
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,967
I hate little kids.

581
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,019
You are a man of the cloth.

582
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,720
How could you be a part of this?

583
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,469
We're gonna let the hostages go.

584
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,309
You wanna do what?

585
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,118
Look, they're a handful.

586
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,049
We got a couple of women,
a child, an old man.

587
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,220
They'll slow us down,
maybe get us killed.

588
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:22,755
No, no. No way.

589
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,860
They're the only things that
stand between us and them.

590
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:29,225
- We just keep the most valuable one.
- Which one?

591
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,231
Her.

592
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,833
Why her?

593
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,065
She's the mayor's wife.

594
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,999
Why is one better than a bunch?

595
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,200
The queen is always more valuable
than a bunch of jokers.

596
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,410
There must be some mistake.

597
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:48,106
Why don't you keep
the bank manager and his wife.

598
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:52,947
If you let me go, I guarantee that
my husband will let you all go free.

599
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:55,180
That's why you're gonna stay.

600
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,855
For Mom.

601
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,227
For Mom.

602
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,162
- I don't like this.
- You don't like anything.

603
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:05,693
I don't like the way
you been running things.

604
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:12,135
- You think you could do better?
- Yeah.

605
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,579
What the hell is your problem?

606
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,293
What are you doing?

607
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,026
I'm getting the hell out of here!

608
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,292
Mara.

609
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,131
You coming or not?

610
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,499
Are you coming or what?

611
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:50,744
There's no need to harm
an innocent boy.

612
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:06,092
- This kid is our ticket out.
- You can't go out there.

613
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,957
- They'll kill you both.
- Shut the hell up!

614
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,032
And mind your own business.

615
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:15,568
I can't let you do this.

616
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,939
Then you're gonna
have to shoot me.

617
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:27,244
Can you do that?

618
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,957
She could not escape her destiny.

619
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:45,563
Destiny's a bitch.

620
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:46,996
Linc!

621
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:57,471
Kansas. Kansas.

622
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:04,517
Just hold on, mister.

623
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,291
My apologies, Lorelie.

624
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,223
I guess I ain't that lucky.

625
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,759
What the hell do you all think
you're doing?

626
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:53,427
You think this is some kind
of noble act?

627
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:02,674
This is tragic.

628
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:27,596
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

629
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,406
Get them out of here.

630
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,080
They're becoming a problem.

631
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,813
Okay, they all go.

632
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:49,347
But the mayor's wife, she stays.

633
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,654
Come on.

634
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,992
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Come on, get out of here.

635
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,101
Get out of here!
Get out of here! Come on!

636
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:04,602
No. You. You stay.

637
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,015
Don't shoot!

638
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:26,023
We're letting some
of the hostages go.

639
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,698
What are you doing?

640
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,736
The only thing left to do.

641
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,738
- Run, Linc!
- Fire.

642
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:44,896
Rosa.

643
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,270
Don't die.

644
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,390
Someone get the caretaker.

645
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,250
Sorry, boys.

646
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:50,637
Looks like there's a new sheriff
in town.

647
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,705
Don't spend it all in one place.

648
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,052
We got the mayor's wife.

649
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:10,353
We get safe passage out...

650
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:12,322
...we'll let her go.

651
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,363
Okay.

652
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,433
Agreed.

653
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,039
Get ready.

654
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,210
What are you doing?

655
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,274
What needs to be done.

656
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:39,185
You, let's go.

657
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:54,298
Just cooperate, ma'am, and you'll be
home with your husband for supper.

658
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:08,347
Get down, get down.

659
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,818
Oh, shit.

660
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:12,884
Keep your head down!

661
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,093
No, Linc, Linc, Linc.

662
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,420
Come on. Come on, baby,
don't you die on me.

663
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,795
Come on, baby, don't you
die on me. Come on, Linc.

664
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:28,634
Anybody hurt?

665
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,202
No.

666
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:36,640
Yeah, the mayor's wife.

667
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,108
She's gone.

668
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:41,573
Oh, no.

669
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,115
You gonna be all right, man.

670
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,294
You gonna be all right.

671
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,364
Come out!

672
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,404
Wolverton.

673
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:09,409
What are you doing?

674
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,240
I'm doing God's work.

675
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,610
I'm going with God.

676
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,922
It's time.

677
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,831
God be with you, gentlemen.

678
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,778
Wolverton!

679
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,515
Wolverton!

680
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:06,996
- All right, boys, let's get out of here.
- Take my cape. I got this.

681
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:43,666
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

682
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,568
...I will fear no evil.

683
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:07,723
How's it look out there?

684
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:13,127
Well, I got good news,
and I got bad news.

685
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:16,504
We're surrounded
by a bunch of killers.

686
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:18,138
What's the good news?

687
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,365
That was the good news.

688
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:24,408
Well, what's the bad news?

689
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,176
The bad news is
the fun's almost over.

690
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:40,556
I want you to give yourself up.

691
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,492
Come on, now, man.
You know I don't play that.

692
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,226
You can't blame a brother for trying.

693
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,576
Yeah, Linc, well, any second now,
they could come up here and get us...

694
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,267
...so, what we gonna do now?

695
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,854
- We leave.
- Okay.

696
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:10,115
No. Separately, little brother.

697
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,917
What?

698
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,096
Rear window.

699
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,899
Wolverton's dead.

700
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,364
His men moved out front.

701
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:26,598
You could make...
You could make your way out back.

702
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,534
Linc, what are you talking about?

703
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,080
Oh, God.

704
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,124
You remember when we was kids?

705
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,154
You used to huddle up in the bed...

706
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:51,799
...scared to sleep by yourself
in the dark.

707
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,562
I used to sit up all night...

708
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,162
...to keep you safe...

709
01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:00,071
...from those monsters...

710
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:03,136
...and that scary world outside.

711
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,472
Yeah.

712
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,516
But that was a long time ago, Linc.

713
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:15,718
Now it's time for me to sit up
and look after you.

714
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:19,386
I'll face it all by myself.

715
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:22,894
You be safe, little brother.

716
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:28,227
No. No, Linc,
I'm not leaving you, man.

717
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,701
You're gonna do as I say.

718
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:35,408
You go for that back window.

719
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:37,740
I'll go through the front.

720
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:40,346
I'll hold them down.

721
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:46,947
You don't look back, you hear me?

722
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:51,084
- Linc, stop, man.
- It's only me and you left.

723
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,928
What kind of sense that make...

724
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,265
...if we both die?

725
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:03,831
I'm gonna live through you,
little brother.

726
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:30,658
At the count of three...

727
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,195
...you break for the rear...

728
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:37,131
...and you don't look back.

729
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:40,171
Promise me.

730
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,635
I promise.

731
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:45,574
Okay.

732
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:49,174
One.

733
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,480
Two.

734
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:59,024
Three.

735
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:35,016
So here we were.
The plan had led us here.

736
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,255
That's my little brother.

737
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:44,694
I promised Mom
I would always protect him...

738
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:49,966
...but I had a feeling this one
was gonna be different.

739
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:54,597
Something was telling me,
this time...

740
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:57,539
...one of us wasn't gonna
make it back home.

741
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:49,760
Mama, I'm coming home.
