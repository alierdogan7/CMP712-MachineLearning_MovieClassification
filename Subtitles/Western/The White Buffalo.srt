1
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:53,336
What the hell is going on?

2
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,547
I had a dream.

3
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,071
If there'd been anyone in the upper,

4
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,259
you'd have sent him to hell on a shutter!

5
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:02,970
I'm sorry, Mr. Bixby.

6
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,806
By God, Mr. Otis,

7
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,267
you will stow those damned irons
in your carpetbag,

8
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:12,188
or I'll stop this train
and set you out in Wyoming on your boots!

9
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,235
<i>In September of 1874,</i>

10
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,779
<i>Wild Bill Hickok came back to the old west.</i>

11
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:24,242
<i>I didn't place him then because
he was wearing a different name</i>

12
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:27,245
<i>and he had a strange bee in his bonnet.</i>

13
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:31,040
<i>A deadly dream that
was eating out his soul.</i>

14
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,751
<i>A nightmare that he had to hunt down</i>

15
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:35,378
<i>and face up to before</i>

16
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,589
<i>it turned him into a raving maniac.</i>

17
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,092
<i>I ought to know. I was there.</i>

18
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,096
Morning, Mr. Otis.

19
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,597
Good morning.

20
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,851
I regret the flummery of last night.

21
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:54,021
Well, at least now
I understand why it happened.

22
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,315
I Wish I did.

23
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,360
You don't have to kick chips with me, son.

24
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,821
Time back, you caught yourself
a cold in the pants

25
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,323
that just wouldn't let loose of you, right?

26
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,409
It's a scar that never heals.

27
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,452
First it gets into your eyes.

28
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:12,123
They can't stand the daylight,
even the bright moon.

29
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,209
Then it rattlesnakes into your brains.

30
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:17,503
You start dreaming nightmares.

31
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,089
All bad.

32
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:27,346
This white buffalo
keeps charging me, real as rain.

33
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:31,601
Well, son, that dream is safe enough.

34
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,811
The last white spike was put down

35
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,689
by Prairie Dog Dave Morrow last month.

36
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:41,027
Way the hell and gone on the Cimarron.

37
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,446
Where you headed?

38
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:51,203
Mr. Otis, a tenderfoot like you
isn't thinking of

39
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,497
staking a claim in the Black Hills?

40
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,374
Says there, "New land of promise."

41
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,668
It don't promise nothing but a quick grave

42
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,503
in a Sioux boneyard.

43
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,062
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

44
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,954
Where is the Little One?

45
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,388
She's gone to the stars.

46
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:41,118
Crazy Horse, my son.

47
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:45,539
It is not fitting
that the war chief of the Oglalas

48
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,875
weeps like a young woman.

49
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,962
Therefore, I take away your true name.

50
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,798
You shall be called "Worm."

51
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,926
Where does her body lie?

52
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:00,304
<i>At Enchanted Mesa, above the lake.</i>

53
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:04,558
<i>We placed her far from the Whites
and safe from wolves.</i>

54
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:08,270
<i>It is time you sought out the holy bull.</i>

55
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:13,817
<i>The Little One will
be forever tortured in the other world</i>

56
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,487
<i>until you wrap her in his white robe</i>

57
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,698
<i>and cleanse her spirit of its pain.</i>

58
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:51,355
Hear me, Holy One above!

59
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,943
With a sacred voice, I call you!

60
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,570
With a weeping heart, I ask this.

61
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,365
Help me to find the white buffalo.

62
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,450
My voice is on the smoke.

63
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,516
I thank you, holy grandfather.

64
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,522
Cheyenne!

65
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,025
Ten-minute stop, folks.

66
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,068
Ten minutes!

67
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,070
What's that contraption?

68
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,363
Buff bones.

69
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:44,366
All that's left of 60 million spikes

70
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,327
that once roamed the coast of Kansas.

71
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:48,871
My God!

72
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,698
God Almighty!

73
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,493
Hello, Pete.

74
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,286
Sweet Jesus, Bill.

75
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,288
James Otis is the name, Pete.

76
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,040
I heard you were back in Gotham

77
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,293
playacting on the stage
with Billy Cody and making a barrel.

78
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,962
Making a jackass out of myself, you mean.

79
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,256
You! Tinhorn!

80
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,467
There's no open seat in this town!

81
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,052
Back on board.

82
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,141
You scramble-brained son of a bitch!

83
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,310
Are you trying to commit suicide?

84
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:55,813
You think the Sioux have forgot
how you shot the head off

85
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,398
of Whistler the Peacemaker?

86
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,108
I'm money-bound, Pete.

87
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,734
If you think a new handle and specs

88
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,820
are gonna hide you, you're snaffled.

89
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,572
You're up shit creek without a bullboat.

90
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,741
You're clean out of friends.

91
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,743
That include you, Pete?

92
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,496
That's a hell of a thing to say to me.

93
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,374
You better walk soft in Cheyenne.

94
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,545
Tom Custer and a troop of his toospots
are in town on an Indian scout.

95
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:23,340
He's made brag he'll turn your lights out
if he ever sees you again.

96
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,342
Well, I'll peel an eye.

97
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,095
Guess I won't see
you this side of again, Pete.

98
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,264
That won't wet my eyes none.

99
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,684
So long, Mr. James Otis, and good luck.

100
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,187
If there's any left.

101
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,461
- Where's Captain Custer?
- Back room, sonny.

102
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,465
Captain Custer, sir.

103
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,468
For Christ's sake,
Corporal Kileen, stand at ease.

104
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:10,721
Hey, Paddy, bring us another jug back here.

105
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,930
What is it, Kileen?

106
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,134
Captain, sir, Sergeant
Scott reports that he just saw.

107
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,060
Wild Bill Hickok come in
on the Overland Limited.

108
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,395
God damn!

109
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,898
He's using a different handle, James Otis,

110
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,733
and hiding behind a pair of dark specs.

111
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,151
Wonder what the hell he's doing here.

112
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,403
Well, sir, the sergeant thinks
he's here after gold

113
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:30,240
or on the trail of that white buff
we sighted in the Black Hills last August.

114
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,910
I don't give a damn what he's after.

115
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,245
But him and Paddy being old friends,

116
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,831
sure as sun up, sooner or later

117
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,919
he'll head right for here and find me.

118
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,465
By damn! At last I have
that hair-triggered bastard in my sights.

119
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,927
Kileen, get your ass
over the depot and tell Sergeant Scott

120
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,470
to hang on to Hickok's trail.

121
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,972
I wanna know exactly where he goes.

122
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,099
Shake it up!

123
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,185
What's the ruckus, Captain?

124
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,312
Back in Hay City in '69,

125
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,481
he caught and killed my horse
from under me.

126
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,399
He back shot two of my best soldiers.

127
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,735
That's a bucket of hot air.

128
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:10,155
Bill never back shot nobody,
not in his whole life.

129
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,990
You calling me a liar, Paddy?

130
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,284
I'm saying you were blind drunk.

131
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,664
Since I was bartender that night,

132
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:19,998
I ought to know.

133
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,792
You're looking to wear a marble hat.

134
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,710
The truth is, it was your two sots

135
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:26,088
who tried to back shoot Hickok and lost.

136
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,799
Then he killed your nag
to keep it from killing one of us.

137
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,510
What with it jumping
up on the billiard table and all.

138
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,762
You want me as an enemy, Paddy?

139
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,098
You never did give me goose bumps, Tom.

140
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,851
Captain, you're right, sir.
Hickok's coming here now.

141
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,645
He's just outside.

142
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:44,982
Got him. You hug that bar
and keep your trap shut

143
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,150
unless you want to die like him.

144
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,196
Miles, take Kileen
and jump that son of a bitch

145
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,864
when he comes through the door.

146
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:56,868
Miles. You and the boys
make him dance before I knock him off.

147
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,997
Yes, Tom. Come on, men,
we're gonna have a little fun.

148
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,798
Let him dance to the tune!

149
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,102
Bill!

150
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,859
Again, Bill!

151
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,384
Tom Custer tried to brace you.

152
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,761
He's lit out hell for hades.

153
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,138
You took a chance, Paddy.

154
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,431
I owed you.

155
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,016
Not that much.

156
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,730
I heard Poker Jenny works here.

157
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,066
She's the widow Schermerhorn now.

158
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,610
Gone north to a wolf roost
called Fetterman

159
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,528
to open her own place.

160
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,575
Well, I happen to be going that way myself.

161
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,120
Bill, the word is out the Sioux are riding

162
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,498
the Bozeman Trail like Irish banshees.

163
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,041
So keep your pistol cocked.

164
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,584
Thanks, Paddy.

165
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,393
Hit the collars, you swayback shad bellies!

166
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,149
Giddyap, there, you lazy bastards!

167
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,569
Yes, sir, Mr. Otis, old hard ass Custer

168
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,239
has tossed the bear
into the beehive this time.

169
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,657
You got a case against gold?

170
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,200
Why do you think I'd be bouncing around

171
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,411
in this bone-breaker on my way to that

172
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,329
shitty little rat hole called Fetterman

173
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,124
if I didn't succor after gold, huh?

174
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,918
Well, watch your tongue, Mr. Coxy.

175
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,170
You know, when that boy general done

176
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,256
planted his boot down in the Black Hills,

177
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,717
why he invited those
frigging feather headers

178
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,135
out on the Warpath!

179
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,388
And by the time those scalp hunting
sons-of-bitches are through,

180
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:25,350
there's gonna be a thousand bloody
nightcaps betwixt here and the Missouri.

181
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,561
You have a filthy mouth.

182
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,855
There's a lady at hand.

183
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,525
You mean her?

184
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,279
Any more hard tongue from you,
you'll settle with me.

185
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,239
Taken kindly, Mr. Otis.

186
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,660
You mind your manners, Mr. Coxy.

187
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,001
God damn this shitty weather!

188
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,129
Give me that!

189
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,519
Damn your lazy hides!

190
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,688
I'm getting just as wet as you are!

191
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,110
What in hades hell is that?

192
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,655
Yeah, green.

193
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,117
Green from horn to hooks.

194
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,791
I wouldn't try it on, Coxy.

195
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,097
Oh, God, no, man!

196
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,642
You wouldn't push me out
on Red Cloud's big open.

197
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,519
For the love of heaven, no, you wouldn't!

198
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,187
No!

199
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:00,278
Otis! Otis!

200
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,072
Otis, not here!

201
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,241
Otis! Otis!

202
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,493
Otis, wait for me!

203
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,370
You wait! Wait!

204
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,914
Don't leave me alone out here!

205
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,917
You can't maroon a white man
in this country!

206
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,877
You can't!

207
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,398
I told him.

208
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,400
You're about as green as snow.

209
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,092
Come on, old boy.

210
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,468
Come on around.

211
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:24,821
Hey, dude.

212
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,156
Give me a hand!

213
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,785
Help me tie these
chowderheads off to the boot.

214
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,956
We have more
important business over here.

215
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,090
Oh, hell!

216
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,601
This one here is Jim Hanley.

217
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:56,770
The other one's Pokerdeck Baker.

218
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,939
They had a mine up yonder on the hill.

219
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,733
Come on, let's get 'em inside.

220
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:05,695
Get a hold of old Jim's boots
before he catches his death of cold.

221
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,499
I'll get them horses.

222
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,501
Boy.

223
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,895
Lord Almighty!

224
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,232
You think you got him?

225
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:49,489
Well, at least ways
you sprinkled a little pepper on him.

226
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,908
Jesus sakes, if you ain't Old Lightning!

227
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,190
And all the time I's a thinking

228
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,245
you didn't know B from bullshit!

229
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:58,123
This lady's walking the streets of glory.

230
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,250
God damn!

231
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,753
Blue Whistler must have
caught her right in the third eye.

232
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,674
Maybe you'd better
ride up on the box with me.

233
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,263
Doesn't make any sense.

234
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,348
No sane Indian would ride the Warpath

235
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,308
in this kind of weather.

236
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,894
No sense at all, not even for a Sioux.

237
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,440
Well, they ain't worried about it none.
Why should you?

238
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,110
Giddyap there, come on.
Giddyap. Come on. Giddyap.

239
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,712
Well, there she is, partner. Fetterman!

240
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,089
Metropolis of the Bozeman Trail!

241
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,592
Prettier than a nine teat sow, ain't she?

242
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,469
Giddyap up there!

243
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,148
Giddyap, there.

244
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,235
...up there, Amos.

245
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,238
What in hades hell you hauling back there?

246
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,324
Couple of buff hunters.

247
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,034
Who beefed them?

248
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,870
Each to other.

249
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:22,165
After they made glass
out of two quarts of Old Crow.

250
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,667
This one with the Grey socks,

251
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,878
said he'd been charged by a white buff,

252
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,632
back in the Black Hills
near the Elk Mountains.

253
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,261
This one with the moccasins,
allowed as how this one

254
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,597
was a fork tongue lying asshole.

255
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,016
Well, the last white
spike was put in a hole

256
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,851
down on the Cimarron last month.

257
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,520
Amen.

258
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,188
When you get through planting them two,

259
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,233
I got three more
customers for you inside the coach.

260
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,528
And I believe they've got enough money
to pay for their own boxes.

261
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,571
Right kindly of you, Abel.

262
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,533
You better lay 'em
out in the snow till I get back.

263
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,118
Keep 'em fresh.

264
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,372
You think that buff hunter
really did see a white spike?

265
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,666
No! Most likely just Sioux smoke

266
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,210
to keep the whites from gold hunting
in them hills.

267
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,344
Will you look after my plunder
while I find a place to roost?

268
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,721
There's only one place to roost.

269
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,098
Mrs. Schermerhorn's.

270
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,019
God Almighty, the cats!

271
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,188
Hope they're all right.

272
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,816
Yeah. You know, this bad-eyed geezer

273
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,277
gave me ten dollars
to scare up all the stray cats

274
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,612
I could find in Cheyenne.

275
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,573
Would this geezer sporting a bad eye

276
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,491
go calling himself Charlie Zane?

277
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,077
Yeah, that's the bastard. You know him?

278
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,746
I know him.

279
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,654
You can warm your behind at the stove.

280
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,450
Like some coffee?

281
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:21,993
It's strong enough to float a Colt.

282
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,953
I'd be forever in your debt, ma'am.

283
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,623
Never mind the fancies.

284
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,625
I'm Mrs. Schermerhorn.

285
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,335
My pleasure.

286
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,629
Do I know you?

287
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,380
James Otis, ma'am.

288
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,341
Don't know any Otis.

289
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,509
But you sure as sin remind me of...

290
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,095
Turn around!

291
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,226
Poker Jenny, I believe.

292
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:47,435
Bill!

293
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,521
You four-flushing son of a bitch!

294
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,148
You cold decked me.

295
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:56,653
If you ain't a sight for a widow in weeds!

296
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,493
I always could
get you mounted fast, couldn't I?

297
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,495
Such talk!

298
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,248
How long ago was it
when we pleasured in Hays City, huh?

299
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:10,541
Seems like forever, Cateyes.

300
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,920
It's been that way for me, too, Jen.

301
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,925
Well, tell me, what
brings you up in this neck, huh?

302
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,551
Custer's gold.

303
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,679
Yeah.

304
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,223
Well, there's a heap up
in those Black Hills.

305
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,185
I'm starving you to death, Cateyes.

306
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,020
You wait right here.

307
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:42,824
Guess you heard about me and Lucas
Schermerhorn getting noosed, huh?

308
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:46,536
Just about the same
time I heard you were a widow again.

309
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,663
Don't be a bastard.

310
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:50,540
Lucas was a lucky man, Jen.

311
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,042
Thank you, Cateyes.

312
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,962
Why do you always call me Cateyes?

313
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,133
Ain't you ever
seen those wild eyes of yours

314
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,968
when you're loving it up,

315
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,887
or when you're hitching
your pistols on for a shindy?

316
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:08,391
I'm a man of comity,
I've always dodged a fight.

317
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,561
Comity? Sure.

318
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:15,064
You're the most politest shootist who ever
blew a man's brains out.

319
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:18,067
I'm too done in to even
argue about it, Jen.

320
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:25,742
Why don't you let
me put you to bed in my room?

321
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,301
Jen, I ain't got the gumption for it.

322
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,511
That'll the day.

323
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:46,888
Truth.

324
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:48,806
You just lie still there.

325
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,141
I'll fly the eagle.

326
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,643
No, Jen.

327
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:59,484
Some time back, one
of your scarlet sisters dosed me proper.

328
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,488
I'm not about to ride the high horse.

329
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,866
Hell, I probably gave it to you myself.

330
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,785
I'll take the chance.

331
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,370
But I won't.

332
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,122
All right, Cateyes.

333
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,167
You take yourself a sound snooze.

334
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,963
But since you're a gambling man,

335
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,840
I'll bet you 6-2 and even

336
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,635
that when you wake up,
I'll talk you into it.

337
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:26,886
We'll see.

338
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,847
I'll leave the door open,
in case you need anything.

339
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,072
Dear Mother of God!

340
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,366
Dear Mother of God!

341
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,744
It was like you were fighting
Armageddon with Satan himself!

342
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,371
It's all right. It's all right.

343
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,123
But you damned near drowned me!

344
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,126
Where the hell did that thing come from?

345
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:43,671
When Bill Cody was
shooting meat for the railroad,

346
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,883
they thought it'd be a good stunt to pass
out buff heads to all the nabobs.

347
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,801
And they gave you a white buff head?

348
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:51,512
You, a doxie? That's worth 2,000 gold.

349
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,557
It ain't real. I mean, I had it painted.

350
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,225
I put in the pink eyes.

351
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,896
Jesus. I'm sorry, Jen.

352
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,564
I'll get it mended.

353
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:04,901
I don't ever want to see it again!

354
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,990
Well, hell spawn.

355
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:15,536
If the time's come for neck or nothing,

356
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,456
you've found your man.

357
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,884
Bill. Has that sickness gone to your head?

358
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:34,764
This damn dream, Jen,
hangs on like a low water leech.

359
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:39,435
If I don't kill this buff,
the dream will kill me.

360
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:44,190
It's like my own fate
was chasing me into the grave.

361
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:47,610
You have to turn away from it, Bill.

362
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,529
I got to call it out.

363
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,572
Call out a dream?

364
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,199
The only way.

365
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,619
But don't worry, Jen,
I'll be gone in the morning.

366
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,457
Frozen Dog's a hellhole.

367
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,251
Keep a wall at your back.

368
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,961
You're alone up there.

369
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,255
I'm used to that.

370
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,881
Bill.

371
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,300
I lost my bet.

372
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,179
No, Jen. I did.

373
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,916
Now be gentlemen.
Now give the ladies some room here.

374
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,043
It's ten dollars for one minute, gents.

375
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,838
One golden eagle for sixty seconds!

376
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:52,425
And then ride that horse
for just as long as you can pay

377
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:55,678
or there'll be a short funeral at sunup!

378
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,265
Come on, boys, line up over here.

379
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,497
All right, come on,
let's get over there, you silly peckerwood.

380
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,374
Now be gentlemen.
Give the ladies some room.

381
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,043
Now don't fret about it, Charlie.

382
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,170
Come on back when you got
some iron in your barrel,

383
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,047
and it'll be my treat.

384
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:34,842
Yeah. Well, thank you kindly, Frieda.

385
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,471
Jim, you in good luck today 'cause

386
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:41,015
you gonna meet my beautiful Frieda!

387
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,601
To the Republic.

388
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:02,745
Well, old timer.

389
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,205
All curried and tame?

390
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:07,750
Name's James Otis.

391
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,423
Old timer, I'm looking for

392
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:16,550
a glass-eyed goose hisser
named Charlie Zane.

393
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:17,843
Princely fellow.

394
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:20,429
This fella Zane wears a snow white mane,

395
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:22,723
which got that
way 'cause he's scared of redskins.

396
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,436
He's been known to puddle his britches
at a Kiowa war whoop.

397
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,438
You old fiddlefoot!

398
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,859
Charlie, you sure Custer
found gold up there

399
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:35,319
and not a field of dandelions?

400
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:36,487
He struck it.

401
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,450
Then what's a backshooting
claim jumper like you

402
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,782
doing here instead of there?

403
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,409
You need gear to dig a mine.

404
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,952
I had to raise a bankroll.

405
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,204
The cats!

406
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:50,459
All right, gents, come now.
Line up for the...

407
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,877
Place your bets.

408
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:58,467
You figuring on marshaling
in this one-dog town?

409
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,302
No, I'll never wear the tin again.

410
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,929
I know why you're here.

411
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:04,682
You're on a scout for the white buffalo.

412
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,519
Old timer, I thought
you were too ripe for fairy tales.

413
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,813
Well, would you believe it
from an eyewitness?

414
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,816
Depends which eye.

415
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,652
Don't cornhole me, young sass!

416
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:19,905
I was with General Custer when we hit
the nuggets at French Creek

417
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,824
and that lollygagger of a buff

418
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:25,619
challenged the whole
goddamn Seventh Cavalry to a showdown!

419
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,376
It's all coming true.

420
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,087
What're you prattling about?

421
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,260
Old timer.

422
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,305
Straight tongue.

423
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,558
You really saw a white spike?

424
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:48,851
Saw him?

425
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,855
Son-of-a-bitch threw
half a mountain down on me.

426
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,878
Barkeep! Two stiff horns of gin.

427
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,213
And mind you,

428
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:20,549
none of that pig pee
you spigot out to these swill bellies.

429
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,719
I only sell the fizz, friend.
I don't make it.

430
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,721
Five dollars a bottle.

431
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:29,517
You insinuating we're
shortshirks in this camp, Mr...

432
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:30,976
Brady is the name.

433
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:34,063
There was a defalcating son-of-a-bitch

434
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,774
down in the nations named Brady.

435
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:40,402
He sold six barrels
to Chief Mo-Wi and his Comanches.

436
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:44,907
And after them stinking redskins
got lubricated up,

437
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,492
they made a little war

438
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:49,578
and wiped out half of my outfit.

439
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,956
That's a hell of a thing, Mr...

440
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,249
Kileen.

441
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:57,169
Whistling Jack Kileen?

442
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,757
Well, now, look, Mr. Kileen.

443
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:05,761
The name Brady's as common as hen
shit back in the old country.

444
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:07,179
I ain't your man.

445
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,807
I'm only an old damn harp out
from the States

446
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,517
trying to make a roll.

447
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,644
And to show you the good faith,

448
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,606
gin is on the house.

449
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,567
That's mighty generous.

450
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,154
Maybe too damn generous.

451
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:31,954
All right, you Jaspers,
you've had my table long enough.

452
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,081
- Skedaddle.
- Yeah, you don't say.

453
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,959
I just did.

454
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:41,547
- Aaron!
- Yup!

455
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,799
Watch those hide hunters.

456
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,134
Sure enough.

457
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:56,020
Mr. Otis, I'll pay you 500 in gold

458
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,315
if you'll back me
in any play made here tonight.

459
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,566
Who are they?

460
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,775
Where?

461
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,694
Behind your glass eye.

462
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:08,032
The long bean is Whistling Jack Kileen.

463
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:12,161
He's the meanest son-of-a-bitch alive.

464
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:15,706
I was in Julesburg when I saw him cut
an Indian trader into 300 pieces

465
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,917
for selling a Winchester to Roman Nose.

466
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,002
And the sprag's name is Kid Jelly.

467
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:21,378
A grease spot,

468
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,297
and I mean hot grease.

469
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:26,342
No, thanks, Mr. Brady.

470
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:27,801
It's not my fight.

471
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:31,722
Well, it damn well might be
if Kileen knows who you really are.

472
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:35,267
Hey, what kind of tattle you talking about?

473
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,937
I'm talking about what happened
down in Cheyenne City

474
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,772
two days ago!

475
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,066
You're talking yourself to death.

476
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:52,701
Tom Custer and some of his larrigans tried
to brace me at Paddy Welch's.

477
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:54,662
Kileen's kid was one of them.

478
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,915
How'll it go?

479
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:02,920
Brady'll send the kid over with a couple of
free bottles of "Oh Be Joyful."

480
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:08,384
When he gets there,
he'll drop the word like a buffalo chip.

481
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,187
I just heard the plop.

482
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,585
Keep your shitty
boots outta my way, old man,

483
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,671
unless you wanna be buried in 'em!

484
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,424
Now, now, sonny boy.

485
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,633
Didn't your ma never tell you

486
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,052
your mouth wasn't made
for breaking wind?

487
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,062
.36 is my caliber.

488
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:48,275
I was brought up bad.

489
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:56,200
You crazy son-of-a-bitch.

490
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:01,330
Nine's the winner.

491
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,750
Pay the nine.

492
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,043
Place your bets.

493
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:10,339
This one's found his mark.

494
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,382
And here comes the kid. Jiggers.

495
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,554
Mind the Texan.

496
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:32,736
Make your play, you glass-eyed gasbag!

497
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:45,958
Cover my back, old timer.

498
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:52,714
This is your night, Hickok.

499
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:55,050
But there's gonna be another time.

500
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,719
Don't let me see you again.

501
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:00,973
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do...

502
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,057
You peached.

503
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:03,809
I swear by Sweet Jesus I didn't.

504
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:05,978
You swear yourself to Hell!

505
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:09,648
It's Wild Bill Hickok himself!

506
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,569
He got 'em both with one shot.

507
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,904
He got 'em both with one shot!

508
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,206
Well, Captain, your
new name didn't last long.

509
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,333
You sure used this town up fast.

510
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,586
We'd best show a heel in these parts.

511
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,504
Question is, which way?

512
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,923
New camp forming up north.

513
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,426
Place called Deadwood Gulch.

514
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,597
Charlie,

515
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,434
you know what I hate
more than anything else in this world?

516
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,436
More than Indians?

517
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,062
Even more than dying.

518
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,355
What?

519
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,690
Being afraid.

520
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,443
What, you mean in there?

521
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:55,861
I mean out there.

522
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,281
Easterly?

523
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,866
That's Sioux land.

524
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,203
There's nothing out there
but the Big Open and the Black Hills.

525
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,540
And the white buffalo.

526
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:33,562
How many men you rubbed out, Captain?

527
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,339
Mostly Indians.

528
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,553
You really got no gut for Indians, do you?

529
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:47,097
Like Phil Sheridan said,

530
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,225
"I ain't never seen a good Indian
that wasn't dead."

531
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:19,254
Take it easy, old timer.

532
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,423
He's out of range.

533
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,185
Looks like he's on his own.

534
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:47,699
We'd best get out of here.

535
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:41,920
Use the long gun. I'll take the Winchester.

536
00:49:05,694 --> 00:49:08,196
Rein up, Captain. Ain't our fight.

537
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:10,031
Look down below.

538
00:49:39,436 --> 00:49:41,480
It's an Indian hullabaloo.

539
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:43,064
But she's a daisy!

540
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:53,783
Troop of Absarokes chasing
one flea-bit Sioux egg-sucker.

541
00:49:57,412 --> 00:49:59,789
What are Crows doing in Sioux country?

542
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:03,126
Yeah. Probably heard about the white buff

543
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,669
on the Moccasin telegraph.

544
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,214
Fifteen, I count.

545
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:12,427
Listen to that red nigger take on!

546
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:15,430
He's madder than a wet mouse
and don't scare worth a hiccup!

547
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:18,808
No chance, though.

548
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:20,435
Fifteen to one.

549
00:50:20,936 --> 00:50:22,437
Fifteen to three.

550
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,483
You're gonna take a hand?

551
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,264
I'm gonna flank them.

552
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,394
Peel an eye, Captain.

553
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:01,369
Hello, White-eye.

554
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:03,705
My heart is good.

555
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:06,833
I thank you for helping me

556
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:09,127
kill my enemies.

557
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:14,924
Friend. You are very brave.

558
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:17,886
Come to my council.

559
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:21,723
It cannot be done.

560
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:24,601
Father sun climbs high.

561
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:27,437
And it's far to the lodges of my people.

562
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:31,232
But I will not forget you, White-eye.

563
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:04,933
Want I should splat him, Captain?

564
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:07,268
Nervy rooster, ain't he?

565
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:10,271
You must be wearing hard bark to turn
your back on that scratch cat.

566
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:13,149
You know damn well
brave men don't back shoot.

567
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:15,235
And that redskin's all sand.

568
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,654
You gonna let him
march out and raise troops?

569
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:19,572
You're prating like a farmer, Charlie!

570
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:21,241
He's after the white buff, same as us.

571
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,534
Well, let me finish him now.

572
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:23,993
- Then we'd never find out.
- What?

573
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:26,371
Whether or not he knows
where that white spike is.

574
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:27,766
Indians?

575
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,851
No. Thought I heard buffalo.

576
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:33,188
Wait. I got a peeper.

577
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,546
By heaven!

578
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:01,591
Old timer, shake out a round!

579
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,063
I see him!

580
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,564
I see him!

581
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:19,067
What the hell!

582
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,902
He walked into solid rock!

583
00:55:20,944 --> 00:55:22,904
No, there's a cave up there.

584
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:24,864
That's where we'll camp tonight.

585
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:26,825
What about old Nicodemus?

586
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:28,284
He won't hang around.

587
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:31,287
You damn sure?

588
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,123
It's not in my nightmare.

589
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,951
Break out some tallow.

590
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:16,791
Make some more of these, Charlie.

591
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:21,713
You really going in that
Black Hole of Calcut?

592
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,048
I've got a friend.

593
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:50,259
Hell spawn's gone.

594
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:52,220
There's another hole back there.

595
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:54,847
He knows his way back.

596
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,849
It's not in my dream.

597
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:59,560
There has to be snow.

598
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:01,437
Heavy snow.

599
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:11,531
I sure as hell wish you hadn't said that.

600
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:21,082
Mare broke loose.

601
00:58:53,865 --> 00:58:56,117
That scurvy spike has killed the mare.

602
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,327
He's hightailed it
to the other side of the mountain.

603
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,455
For God's sake, Captain, wait up!

604
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,908
Charlie!

605
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:20,993
Keep your noodle down!

606
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:23,704
This is between Hickok and us.

607
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,791
Hickok!

608
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,252
Here I am, Hickok!

609
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,754
Go ahead, take a couple of shots!

610
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:35,383
If you think your short guns
will reach that far!

611
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:39,720
Well, come on!

612
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:42,140
What's the matter, Hickok?

613
01:00:42,223 --> 01:00:44,851
Hey! Here I am up here!

614
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,562
Well, come on!

615
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:49,730
What're you waiting for, Hickok?

616
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:51,732
Come on!

617
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:53,734
Damn you, Hickok!

618
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:56,070
Make your move! I don't wanna have to

619
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:58,573
put a bullet in a frozen carcass.

620
01:02:06,474 --> 01:02:08,851
Hang on, Captain! I'll get you home!

621
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,437
Stay put, Charlie!

622
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:14,148
Gyp, where's Ben?

623
01:02:14,232 --> 01:02:15,733
He's gone to hell in a hurry!

624
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:17,902
All right, then, you make your move

625
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:20,988
before the storm gives Hickok cover!

626
01:02:47,223 --> 01:02:49,850
For God's sake, Captain, put down roots!

627
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:51,686
The Colts will never cut it!

628
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,021
There's snow on the wind. Wait it out!

629
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:07,285
Get out of here, you damn lobo,
before I skin you alive!

630
01:03:25,136 --> 01:03:26,554
By heaven!

631
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,141
The red dandy's joined the Brigade.

632
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,414
Captain.

633
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:56,083
You want I should
foreclose on his mortgage?

634
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,171
<i>Wasichu!</i> The demon is dead.

635
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,257
My thanks to you!

636
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:07,678
What are you whites doing in this land?

637
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:10,723
This is Pa Sappa,

638
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:13,017
the country of the Lacotas.

639
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:16,604
These mountains belong to me!

640
01:04:18,356 --> 01:04:19,815
Now

641
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:22,610
the thunderbird

642
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:26,280
is eating the sky.

643
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:30,368
Soon, plenty of snow.

644
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:35,373
Come to my council, my brother.

645
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:39,960
We will make good medicine.

646
01:04:50,513 --> 01:04:53,182
<i>Wahi cola!</i> I am coming, my friend.

647
01:05:21,669 --> 01:05:23,129
Pretty slick, Captain.

648
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:24,338
What?

649
01:05:24,422 --> 01:05:26,006
The way you suckered him.

650
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:29,301
You try hanging a wooden suit
on that child, you'll answer to me!

651
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,137
That snow ossify your brain?

652
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:32,805
I gave him my word.

653
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:37,685
Your word to a redskin? Come on, Captain.

654
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:40,020
That's like shoveling fleas in a barn.

655
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:43,357
Just get the hell back there,
grow a fire and make some grub.

656
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,662
<i>- Washtay.</i>
- Welcome, friend.

657
01:05:56,704 --> 01:06:01,083
Are you the <i>Wasichu</i>
we Sioux call Okute, the Shooter?

658
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:04,170
The one who killed
Whistler the Peacemaker?

659
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:06,964
What kind of a question
is that between friends?

660
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:10,718
Are you the murderer called Hickok?

661
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:13,721
The Cheyenne call me Pahaska.

662
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:16,348
Longhair?

663
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,558
Longhair.

664
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:19,810
Come on back when you're ready.

665
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:25,733
Let me tell you something, sonny.

666
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:28,068
Trusting Jehovah himself
can be a touchy business.

667
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:31,030
But when you start betting your poke
on that red cat-skinner,

668
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:33,824
you are drawing to an inside straight.

669
01:06:33,908 --> 01:06:35,576
Something about him.

670
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:38,704
Just another buck on the Warpath.

671
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:40,789
No, he's not. He's not
just an ordinary buck.

672
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:42,917
Can't you see the way
he wears that eagle feather?

673
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,418
Like a chief!

674
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,003
Jiggers!

675
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:47,421
<i>Washtay.</i>

676
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:48,839
Come in. Come in.

677
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:59,266
Longhair. I saw
that you do not own a long gun.

678
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:01,435
This I took from the demon.

679
01:07:01,477 --> 01:07:02,645
It is yours.

680
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:04,021
Many thanks.

681
01:07:05,523 --> 01:07:07,942
But the long gun my friend's been shooting,

682
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:10,110
this one belongs to me.

683
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:14,281
He doesn't own one.

684
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:40,140
Dognation!

685
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:47,147
Well, thanks, sonny, but the fact is

686
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:49,608
I ain't got nothing
good enough to swap you.

687
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,570
You give me shelter
and you share your food.

688
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,489
That ain't foofaraw. Wait.

689
01:07:56,282 --> 01:07:59,159
But wait! Hanging up!

690
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:01,328
I got a proper geegaw!

691
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:17,428
What do they call you?

692
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:22,891
Nadonaissioux myeyelo.

693
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:25,352
I am small snake.

694
01:08:25,436 --> 01:08:26,729
I don't think so.

695
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:31,483
You are.

696
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:33,360
Little Snake?

697
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:40,117
Worm? Worm.

698
01:08:41,327 --> 01:08:43,662
Worm. Yes. I am called Worm.

699
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:47,333
How is the old one called?

700
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:49,376
The Cheyenne call him Ochinee.

701
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:51,754
One Eye?

702
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:53,380
The same.

703
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:55,716
The great white warrior of Sand Creek?

704
01:08:58,135 --> 01:08:59,720
You speak crookedly.

705
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:02,264
This cannot be true.

706
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,975
He thinks your glass eye is real.

707
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:11,023
Watch.

708
01:09:19,615 --> 01:09:22,117
Who says I'm not Ochinee, eh?

709
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:24,953
Who says I'm not the great One-Eye?

710
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,125
That's enough, Charlie!

711
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,961
My friend's a clown. There's no magic.

712
01:09:35,673 --> 01:09:37,883
This is glass, like beads.

713
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:41,095
It's not real.

714
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:43,347
But is he truly Ochinee?

715
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:45,516
He's truly One-Eye.

716
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:48,644
Fix the grub.

717
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:51,772
I'm gonna fix us up
a real pea warmer of a breakfast.

718
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,357
Buff steaks and flapjacks.

719
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,485
When it comes
to belly cheating, I really shine.

720
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:58,297
Start shining because I have a feeling

721
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,447
our friend Worm has a wolf in his belly.

722
01:10:18,841 --> 01:10:22,678
Longhair, we must make
our water on these stones.

723
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:24,722
I don't figure that white buffalo's

724
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:27,474
gonna turn tail at a
little sprinkling of pee.

725
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:30,978
It is the way brother wolf
marks his hunting grounds.

726
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:33,147
And the buffalo respects the wolf.

727
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,730
<i>Tatanka!</i>

728
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,816
Sing your death song!

729
01:11:17,858 --> 01:11:20,986
Soon I will slay you
as you slew the Little One.

730
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:23,489
Soon I will wrap her in your holy robe!

731
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:28,076
These are my words!

732
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:30,621
This buffalo is mine!

733
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:32,915
The hell you say!

734
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:39,546
The buffalo will
belong to the hunter who kills him.

735
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:42,090
Mine, alone!

736
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:48,972
Well, Captain,

737
01:11:49,056 --> 01:11:51,892
seems like we found ourselves
a porcupine to play with.

738
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:55,437
Just ride easy, Charlie.

739
01:11:58,232 --> 01:12:00,484
Let's fix that wall.

740
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:10,911
Longhair. Why are you
whites in my country?

741
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,423
We did not ask the whites to come here.

742
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:26,927
The Great Spirits
gave us these hills as a home.

743
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:30,889
You say, why do not we become civilized?

744
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:32,933
We do not want your civilization.

745
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:35,811
You've spoken red truth.

746
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:39,481
Tell me then white truth, Longhair.

747
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:45,529
In the first place, the Great Spirit

748
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:47,865
did not give you these hills.

749
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:51,743
You took this land by force.

750
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:54,705
You took it from the Cheyenne,
the Shoshone and the Arapaho.

751
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:56,388
You took it with the lance and tomahawk.

752
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:59,251
And now the white man makes war on you.
What's the difference?

753
01:12:59,293 --> 01:13:01,336
The whites have no honor.

754
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,131
Where white man walks,
death comes out of season.

755
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:06,300
That's a thing called progress.

756
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,510
It's a thing called greed.

757
01:13:09,136 --> 01:13:10,596
Tell me this.

758
01:13:10,637 --> 01:13:13,140
Am I evil because my skin is red?

759
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:17,811
Is it a wicked thing that I was born
where my father was born?

760
01:13:17,853 --> 01:13:21,064
Is it a bad thing that
I would die for my people?

761
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:24,109
It's still red truth and not real truth.

762
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:26,486
Tell me this true truth, then.

763
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:30,407
Give Red John the word!

764
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:32,743
Tell the little rooster he's extinct!

765
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,830
Worm.

766
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:40,417
When Sitting Bull was a boy,

767
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:44,004
the Sioux could throw
10,000 warriors into battle.

768
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:46,131
Today it's the white man's turn.

769
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,884
Those that you have seen
on these hills and on the plains

770
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:50,302
are like a handful of beads.

771
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:51,762
There are many!

772
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:53,847
They are more than the blades
of spring grass,

773
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:55,849
more than the buffalo
when they smothered the earth

774
01:13:55,891 --> 01:13:57,392
in their great herds.

775
01:13:57,726 --> 01:14:00,729
There's no way to stand
against the white man!

776
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:03,899
Their weapons are terrible!

777
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:05,901
They have the power!

778
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:10,364
You will bend to
the long knives or be broken.

779
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:14,242
You will live as they say,
or die on their bayonets.

780
01:14:14,326 --> 01:14:16,411
That was straight tongue, Captain.

781
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,081
If such is the true truth,

782
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:21,541
then I will sing my death song.

783
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:24,544
No. I'll not have your death.

784
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:27,673
Why not? You are white.

785
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:31,009
First, I am your brother and your friend.

786
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:37,099
Longhair. Between us...

787
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:40,227
There shall be no war.

788
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:45,983
Bullshit.

789
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:07,981
Jesus!

790
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,751
Charlie, light a torch.

791
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:32,214
So goddamn dark in here, couldn't
find my own pizzle if I had to pee.

792
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:46,520
Is he in?

793
01:16:54,486 --> 01:16:55,862
He's gone.

794
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:05,539
Jesus Christ!

795
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:36,111
Well, Captain, snow's
stopped, Wind's done,

796
01:17:36,194 --> 01:17:38,947
and our cock-a-doodle
was holding aces behind his knee.

797
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:43,368
Friend Worm has seen fit
to ride off on the scout without...

798
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,203
...cutting our throats,

799
01:17:45,912 --> 01:17:48,415
which was mighty
white of the red ragamuffin.

800
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:52,794
Yeah. Didn't even leave
a mouse sign to point the way.

801
01:17:58,633 --> 01:18:01,511
For a moment there
was a chance, just a chance,

802
01:18:02,804 --> 01:18:04,598
maybe one more day.

803
01:18:06,016 --> 01:18:08,935
Hell, I guess there never
will be an answer.

804
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:12,230
Well, it all depends on the question,
Captain. Come on, let's go.

805
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:28,538
It's Worm telling us to clear off.

806
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:33,251
Well, I sure as hell can't wait
to argue that point with him.

807
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:57,817
What is it?

808
01:18:57,901 --> 01:18:59,277
Take a whiff.

809
01:19:01,363 --> 01:19:03,823
Yeah, that's buffalo, by God!

810
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:05,617
Coming from right down there.

811
01:19:06,076 --> 01:19:08,995
Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna go dark fast.

812
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,748
Better find ourselves a stand.

813
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:07,387
By heaven!

814
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,222
Charlie, this is the place!

815
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:12,392
This is Armageddon.

816
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,187
This is the place in my nightmare.

817
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:18,898
The place where I fought the white buffalo.

818
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:21,526
I'll be a Dutchman!

819
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:24,029
First time I ever saw hokum come true.

820
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,698
We'd better fort up in that piney grove

821
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,450
and keep the trees at our back.

822
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:44,799
Captain, you sure you
wanna play this hand?

823
01:20:45,008 --> 01:20:46,801
You wanna make tracks, Charlie?

824
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:49,429
Two thousand dollars
don't much pleasure a dead man.

825
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:52,223
Hell or heaven,

826
01:20:53,767 --> 01:20:55,560
if this is the night I was born for,

827
01:20:55,602 --> 01:20:56,770
so be it.

828
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:58,313
Amen.

829
01:21:02,192 --> 01:21:03,860
Better take the Winchester.

830
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:05,612
You only got one shot in that.

831
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:07,155
All it takes.

832
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:09,783
Don't freeze.

833
01:21:10,075 --> 01:21:11,701
Colder than a hooker's heart.

834
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:14,454
I'll back you up from here.

835
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:16,433
Captain!

836
01:22:18,435 --> 01:22:19,519
Captain!

837
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:33,783
Captain, you awake?

838
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:42,375
There to your left!

839
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:43,877
It's a wolf!

840
01:22:48,173 --> 01:22:49,507
It's Worm.

841
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:53,178
You want I should rub him?

842
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:56,222
No, the sharp might scare away the spike.

843
01:22:59,309 --> 01:23:02,854
Maybe that demon horned bag of tricks
has flimflammed us.

844
01:23:02,896 --> 01:23:04,481
He's here.

845
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,984
I know he's here.

846
01:24:49,294 --> 01:24:52,046
Jesus sake's, Captain, put him down!

847
01:24:55,675 --> 01:24:57,677
Shoot! Shoot!

848
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:01,806
Captain!

849
01:25:33,046 --> 01:25:34,881
<i>Pteska!</i>

850
01:25:34,922 --> 01:25:36,716
Captain, for the love of God, peel an eye!

851
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:37,925
He's on the charge again!

852
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:44,557
Captain!

853
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:14,253
Worm, use the gun!

854
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:23,096
Captain! Captain!

855
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:31,813
Captain, for the love
of Jesus, what are you doing?

856
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:33,231
Captain!

857
01:26:39,112 --> 01:26:40,613
Use the gun!

858
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:03,988
You all right?

859
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:05,948
Is the <i>wanagi</i> dead?

860
01:28:06,032 --> 01:28:08,201
Hell, no, he's run off.

861
01:28:13,122 --> 01:28:15,708
He's clear to Christmas by now.

862
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:42,628
Why didn't you use your gun?

863
01:29:42,712 --> 01:29:45,006
I am war chief of the Oglalas.

864
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:47,258
I could not use the white man's iron.

865
01:29:47,675 --> 01:29:50,052
This bull had to be taken in the old way.

866
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:53,139
Until I slew this bull in the old way,

867
01:29:53,222 --> 01:29:55,808
I could not wear my own name again.

868
01:29:56,726 --> 01:29:58,519
You're Crazy Horse.

869
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:02,189
Pahaska, my friend,

870
01:30:02,273 --> 01:30:04,734
truly we have suckled at the same mother.

871
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:07,778
Truly we are brothers
born from the same belly.

872
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:16,537
Will you look at
that mountain of meat, huh?

873
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:19,373
Who got him?

874
01:30:19,457 --> 01:30:20,875
Cahoots.

875
01:30:23,711 --> 01:30:26,047
He'll never even know he's dead.

876
01:30:29,425 --> 01:30:31,302
The robe belongs to Worm.

877
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,309
God damn you, Hickok!

878
01:30:40,353 --> 01:30:42,229
Damn you and your red rooster!

879
01:30:42,313 --> 01:30:45,566
You can't do it! You
can't throw $2,000 gold

880
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:47,485
on a maggot meal papoose!

881
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:49,528
Charlie, I'll make it up you in Cheyenne.

882
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:55,660
So you went and got
yourself some red religion, huh?

883
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:03,125
Well, you can tell your
blood brother to shove it up his ass!

884
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:06,545
We're quits.

885
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:38,911
Don't try it on, old timer.

886
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,964
Stop scaring me, Captain.

887
01:31:50,047 --> 01:31:52,842
I only got one clean pair of drawers left.

888
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:57,096
You sanctimonious son-of-a-bitch!

889
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:22,455
You have lost a friend.

890
01:32:23,122 --> 01:32:25,124
So it seems.

891
01:32:27,418 --> 01:32:29,253
And found one.

892
01:32:57,698 --> 01:32:59,450
Is everything done?

893
01:33:00,201 --> 01:33:02,244
It is done.

894
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:05,414
When I cover the Little One with the robe,

895
01:33:05,498 --> 01:33:08,375
she will be healed and well
and whole in the other world.

896
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:11,504
Will you have the right
to wear your own name again?

897
01:33:14,507 --> 01:33:17,384
Then I'll be saying goodbye, Crazy Horse.

898
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:23,766
Hickok.

899
01:33:27,186 --> 01:33:29,438
You heard One-Eye call my name.

900
01:33:30,231 --> 01:33:31,482
Yes.

901
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:34,527
You are Okute the Shooter.

902
01:33:34,568 --> 01:33:37,363
The one who killed
Whistler the Peacemaker.

903
01:33:38,155 --> 01:33:40,157
That was another time

904
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:42,409
when I was young and headstrong.

905
01:33:42,493 --> 01:33:44,370
It was a bad thing.

906
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:45,788
Can't be undone.

907
01:33:47,331 --> 01:33:49,667
I will tell no others.

908
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,544
But, Longhair,

909
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:54,338
though you and I are brothers,

910
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:56,590
we must never meet again.

911
01:33:56,674 --> 01:34:00,052
Hear me, my friend. These are my words.

912
01:34:01,137 --> 01:34:03,472
We must never cross
paths in the tomorrow.

913
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:08,018
For if we do, I will see
only a white enemy.

914
01:34:08,394 --> 01:34:10,729
And you will see only an Indian.

915
01:34:11,564 --> 01:34:14,233
And we will both solve the Great Mystery.

916
01:34:16,277 --> 01:34:18,404
<i>Ohinyan</i>, Longhair.

917
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,740
<i>Ohinyan</i>

918
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:24,243
forever.
