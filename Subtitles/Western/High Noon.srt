Did you see,
what I saw?

28
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,140
C'mon Joe, open it up.
We're going to have a big day, today

29
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:13,773
- You're in a hurry?
- Yeah, I sure am.

30
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:16,860
You're a fool.
Come on.

31
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,908
All right, all right, ladies and gentlemen.
Let us begin.

32
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:29,123
Would the bride and groom
kindly step forward?

33
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,627
Will Kane and Amy Fowler,

34
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:38,549
you appear before me in my capacity
as Justice of the Peace of this township.

35
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:42,428
To be joined together
in the bounds of holy matrimony.

36
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:52,813
- Man, it sure is hot.
- Hot? You call this hot?

37
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,060
- Well, I'll be...
- What's the matter?

38
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,860
I thought I saw Ben Miller.

39
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:04,117
- Ah, he's down Texas somewhere.
- I know.

40
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:08,330
Looked like Pierce and Colby, too.
No, it couldn't be Miller.

41
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:31,104
My goodness gracious

42
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:42,282
- Noon train on time?
- Yes, sir. That is, I think so, sir.

43
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:46,578
Don't know reason why
it shouldn't be...Mr Pierce.

44
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:52,084
How're you,
Mr Miller... Mr Pierce... Mr Colby?

45
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,207
Do you, Will Kane, take Amy
to be your lawful wedded wife,

46
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:34,670
to have and to hold from this day forward,
until death do you part?

47
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,214
I do.

48
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:39,550
Do you Amy take Will
to be your lawful wedded husband

49
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:44,305
to have and to hold from this day forward
until death do you part?

50
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:47,767
- I do.
- The ring, please.

51
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:58,404
Then by the authority invested in me
by the laws of this territory,

52
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:02,532
I pronounce you
"man and wife".

53
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,120
I can't speak for the rest of you men,
but I claim an ancient privilege.

54
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,130
Moving mighty fast
for a Sunday.

55
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:29,852
- Will!
- All those people...

56
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:34,566
Amy, people ought to be alone
when they get married.

57
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,818
I know.

58
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:40,863
I'm gonna try, Amy.
I'll do my best.

59
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:43,618
I will too.

60
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:52,835
Honeymoon is officially over.
Come on, everybody.

61
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:57,298
- Don't look so shocked.
- No privacy on his wedding day.

62
00:07:57,465 --> 00:08:02,763
Well, one more ceremony,
and Will's a free man, more or less.

63
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:05,139
Marshal,
turn in your badge.

64
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:08,851
To tell you the truth, I hate to do this
without your new Marshal being here.

65
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:13,189
Will, Fuller, Haland, and  I are the entire board
of selectmen of this community.

66
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,567
We're also
your very good friends.

67
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:20,321
With the fine job you've done I feel free here
to say, and the judge will bare me out,

68
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:23,030
this town will be safe
'til tomorrow.

69
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:28,663
You win. But don't marry a Quaker,
she'll have you running a store.

70
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:31,917
- I can't picture you doing that, Will
- I can.

71
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,003
So can I,
and a good thing, too.

72
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,089
Thank you.

73
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:40,301
You didn't talk that way
when you were wearing a star.

74
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,180
All right, it's coming off.
But I gotta to be paid first.

75
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:50,729
- Let me down!
- Not until you kiss me.

76
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:54,274
Will, let me down,
you fool!

77
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,270
[Crowd claps]

78
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,708
- You should have been a lawyer.
- I was meant to be a storekeeper.

79
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,669
Marshal,
a telegram for you.

80
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:17,799
It's terrible,
it's shocking.

81
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:23,513
- They've pardoned Frank Miller.
- I don't believe it.

82
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:25,890
We could go too.

83
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,602
- Nice of them to let you know.
- And that ain't all.

84
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:31,854
Ben Miller is down the depot now
with Jim Pierce and Jack Colby.

85
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:35,317
- He asked about the noon train.
- The noon train?

86
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,951
Will.. You get out of this town.
Get out of this town this very minute.

87
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,122
- What is it?
- Never mind that now.

88
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:50,720
But, what is it,
Mr Howe?

89
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,420
Don't you worry. Just get out of town,
and everything will be alright.

90
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,250
- We'll take care of everything.
- I think I ought to stay.

91
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,710
Are you crazy?
Think of Amy.

92
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:07,350
Goodbye, Amy.
Don't worry, everything will be alright

93
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,350
Good luck, boy!
Hurry!

94
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,123
Hm...
That's funny.

95
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:35,130
- What?
- Oh, you can't see now.

96
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,759
Kane and his new wife
just took off in a big hurry.

97
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,304
- What's so funny?
- I mean, a big hurry.

98
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:48,726
Hey, you don't suppose
Kane's scared of those three gunnies?

99
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:54,357
I never saw him
whip a horse that way.

100
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:09,039
- Sam?
- Come in, Helen.

101
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:14,378
Ben Miller is in town.
He has two of the old bunch with him.

102
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,093
I guess
I'll take a look around.

103
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,351
- Why are you stopping?
- It's no good. I've got go back, Amy.

104
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,729
- Why?
- This is crazy. I haven't got any guns.

105
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,358
- Then let's go on. Hurry.
- No.

106
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,485
That's what I've been thinking.

107
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,406
They're making me run.
I've never run from anybody before.

108
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:24,952
- I don't understand any of this.
- I don't have time to tell you.

109
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,081
- Then don't go back, Will
- I've got to. That's the whole thing.

110
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:32,939
Kane's back!

111
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,568
- Don't believe it.
- Just seen him!

112
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,906
- How many coffins have we got?
- Two.

113
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:43,242
We'll need at least two more,
no matter how you figure it.

114
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,494
You better get busy,
Fred.

115
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:53,169
Please Will,
if you'd just tell me what this is all about.

116
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:57,256
I sent a man up five years ago for murder.
He was supposed to hang.

117
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:01,886
But up north, they commuted it to life
and now he's free.

118
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,514
I don't know how.
It looks like he's coming back.

119
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,891
- I still don't understand.
- He's a...

120
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:12,064
He was always wild and kind of crazy.
He'll probably make trouble.

121
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:15,484
But that's no concern of yours.
Not any more.

122
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,778
I'm the one who sent him up.

123
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:22,659
But that was part of your job. It's finished, now.
They've got a new Marshal

124
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:27,831
He won't be here until tomorrow.
Seems to me I've got to stay.

125
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,252
- Anyway, m the same man with or without this.
- That isn't so.

126
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:36,047
I expect he'll come looking for me.
Three of his old bunch are waiting for him.

127
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:39,885
- That's why we ought to go.
- They'll just come after us.

128
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:44,180
Four of them...
And we'd be all alone in the prairie.

129
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:46,683
- We've got an hour.
- What's an hour?

130
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,228
It's a hundred miles. We'd never be able
to keep that store, Amy.

131
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:53,023
They'd come after us. We'd have to run
again as long as we live.

132
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:56,985
No, you wouldn't.
Not, if they didn't know where to find us.

133
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:02,617
- I'm begging you, please, let's go.
- I can't.

134
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:06,579
Don't try to be a hero.
You don't have to be a hero, not for me.

135
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:10,499
I'm not not trying to be a hero.
If you think I like this, you're crazy.

136
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,087
Look, Amy. This is my town.
I've got friends here.

137
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:17,150
I'll swear in bunch of special deputies,
and with a posse behind me,

138
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,750
maybe there won't be any trouble.

139
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:23,305
- You know there'll be trouble.
- Then, it's better to have it here.

140
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,771
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you feel about it.

141
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:35,401
- Do you?
- Of course I do. It's against your religion.

142
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:40,406
- Sure I know how you feel
- But you're doing it just the same.

143
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:45,203
Oh, Will..
We were married just a few minutes ago.

144
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,708
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.
Doesn't that mean anything?

145
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:53,420
You know I've only got an hour,
and I've got lots to do.

146
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,964
Stay at the hotel
until it's over.

147
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,467
No,
I won't be here when it's over.

148
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:02,345
You're asking me to wait an hour to find out
if I'll be a wife or a widow.

149
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:05,765
- It's too long to wait. I won't do it.
- Amy...

150
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:10,354
I mean it. If you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.

151
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,774
I've got to stay.

152
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,270
" <i>On this,
our wedding daaayyy.</i>"

153
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,770
" <i>Do not forsake me,
oh, my daaarlin',</i> "

154
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:36,770
" <i>Although you're grievin',
I can't be leavin'</i>  "

155
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:40,302
- Glad you got here, Percy.
- Are you?

156
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:56,694
Have you forgotten that I'm the man that
passed sentence on Frank Miller?

157
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,488
You shouldn't have come back,
Will

158
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:03,368
I figured I had to.
I figured I had to stay.

159
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:07,580
- You figured wrong.
- I can deputize a posse, 10-12 guns.

160
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:11,793
- My intuition tells me otherwise.
- Why?

161
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:16,964
No time for a lesson in civics,
my boy.

162
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:19,426
In the 5th century BC
the citizens of Athens,

163
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:23,221
having suffered under a tyrant,
managed to banish him.

164
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:26,809
When he returned years later
with an army of mercenary,

165
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:30,771
those same citizens
not only opened their gates for him,

166
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:35,401
but stood by while he executed
members of the League of Government.

167
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:41,574
Similar thing happened eight years ago
in a town called Indian Falls.

168
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:47,747
I escaped death only through the intercession
of a lady of somewhat dubious reputation,

169
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:52,127
and the cost of a very handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother.

170
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:54,379
Unfortunately,
I have no more rings.

171
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:59,175
- You're a judge.
- Been a judge many times and many towns.

172
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:04,765
- I hope to live to be a judge again.
- I can't tell you what to do.

173
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,920
Why must you be so stupid?
Have you forgotten what he is?

174
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,020
Have you forgotten what he's done to people?
Forgotten that he's crazy?

175
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,440
Don't you remember when he sat
in that chair and said:

176
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:19,113
<i>''You'll never hang me. I'll come back
I swear it. I'll kill you, Kane!''</i>

177
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,665
Here you are, ma'am.
This will take you to St. Louis.

178
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:30,450
Thank you.

179
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:41,094
Maybe you'd rather wait somewhere else.
Like at the hotel, maybe.

180
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:44,514
- All right thank you.
- I'm sorry about all this, Mrs Kane.

181
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:48,018
Don't you worry.
The Marshal'll take care of himself alright.

182
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,687
Thank you
very much.

183
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,815
Hey, that wasn't here
five years ago.

184
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:58,487
- So what?
- Nothing...yet.

185
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:08,080
Harvey, don't you think
Kane will be looking for you about now?

186
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,760
- You're really sore at him.
- Wouldn't you be if you were me?

187
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:16,089
I suppose...
if I were you.

188
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,350
Be back in a little while.

189
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:49,541
- Goodbye, Will
- Goodbye.

190
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,002
- You think I'm letting you down, don't you?
- No.

191
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:57,382
Look, this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere.

192
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:00,803
Nothing that happens here
is really important. Now get out.

193
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:02,760
There isn't time.

194
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,016
What a waste.
Good luck.

195
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,781
Johnny!

196
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:26,537
- Why ain't you in church?
- Why ain't you?

197
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,080
Will you do somethin'
for me?

198
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:31,960
Go find Anderson, Howe and Fuller,
and tell them I want them here.

199
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:35,797
- Then find Harv Pell!
- Don't have to do that. I'm right here.

200
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:39,008
- Where have you been?
- Busy.

201
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,720
You know what's doing?
We've got lots to do.

202
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:45,723
Hold up a second.
This ain't really your job, you know.

203
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:49,853
- That's what everybody keeps telling me.
- Just listen a second.

204
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:54,275
- All right, I'm listening.
- This is the way I see it.

205
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:59,739
If you'd gone with the new Marshal
not due till tomorrow, I'd be in charge, right?

206
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,285
If I'm good enough to hold down the job
when there's trouble,

207
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,788
how come the city fathers
didn't trust me with it permanently?

208
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,458
- I don't know.
- Don't you?

209
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:13,753
- No.
- I figure you carry a lot of weight.

210
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:17,632
Maybe they didn't ask me.
Maybe they figured you were too young.

211
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:21,553
- You think I'm too young too?
- You sure act like it sometimes. Come on.

212
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:36,485
It's very simple, Will. You just tell
the old boys that I'm the new Marshal.

213
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:40,322
Tomorrow they can tell the other fellow
sorry but that the job's filled.

214
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,035
- You really mean it, don't you?
- Sure.

215
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,789
- But I can't do it.
- Why not?

216
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:52,544
- If you don't know, it's no use me tellin' you.
- You mean you won't do it?

217
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:55,256
- Have it your way.
- All right

218
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,760
The truth is, you probably
talked against me from the start.

219
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:04,140
You've been sore about me
and Helen Ramirez right along, ain't you?

220
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,476
You and Helen Ramirez?
I...

221
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:12,397
It so happens I didn't know and it don't mean
anything to me, you ought to know that.

222
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:14,692
Yeah, you've been washed up
for more than a year.

223
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,572
You get married, only, you can't stand
anybody taking your place there...

224
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,617
- ...especially me.
- You're...

225
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:33,545
- I haven't got time, Harv.
- Okay, let's get down to business.

226
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:36,090
You want me to stick,
you put a word in for me.

227
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:40,635
Sure I want you to stick, but I'm not buying it.
It's gotta be up to you.

228
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:18,550
I thought you'd grew up
by now.

229
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,888
I thought your disposition might've
sweetened up a little down in Abilene.

230
00:23:23,054 --> 00:23:25,641
I guess we're both wrong.

231
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:34,776
What's so funny?

232
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:37,361
Did you really think
you could put that over on Kane?

233
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,782
- Why not?
- When are you going to grow up?

234
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:43,409
- I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.
- Then grow up.

235
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,030
Cut it out!

236
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,044
- All right
- Why should he have gone for it?

237
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:56,090
He needs me plenty
when Frank Miller gets here.

238
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,717
- That's possible.
- He should've had me made Marshal.

239
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:02,722
- He's just sore. Sore about you and me.
- Is he?

240
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,180
Sure.

241
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:07,434
- You told him?
- Sure.

242
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:09,978
You're a fool.

243
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:13,899
Why?
Didn't you want him to know?

244
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:20,572
Hey... Who did the walking out anyway,
you or him?

245
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,829
Get out,
Harvey.

246
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,666
- I might just do that.
- Then do it!

247
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:34,420
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

248
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:38,258
You're gonna talk different
when Frank Miller gets here.

249
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:41,345
You might want somebody around,
when you try to explain about Kane.

250
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:44,265
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

251
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:49,100
I've heard that you might not be so pretty
when he gets through with you.

252
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:55,693
- I won't be back.
- Good.

253
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,260
[Knock on door]

254
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:08,665
Come in.

255
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:15,798
- I just saw Harvey. Is everything alright?
- I think I have to talk with Mr Weaver.

256
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:19,843
- You're getting out?
- Yes.

257
00:25:20,093 --> 00:25:23,014
You want me to give
Kane a hand?

258
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:31,356
- No.
- All right.

259
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:45,245
May I wait here
for the noon train?

260
00:25:46,997 --> 00:25:49,791
I said,
may I wait in the lobby until noon?

261
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:54,462
- Sure, lady.
- Thank you.

262
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:59,509
- You're Mrs Kane, ain't you?
- Yes.

263
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:03,597
You're leaving on the noon train,
but your husband ain't.

264
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:07,643
- No, why?
- No reason, but it's mighty interesting.

265
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:12,815
Now me, I wouldn't leave this town at noon
for all the tea in China.

266
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:16,318
No, sir.
It's going to be quite a sight to see.

267
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,310
" Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord; "

where the grapes of wrath are stored;</i> "

of his terrible swift sword;</i> "

270
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,210

277
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,800
- Will, I just heard...
- Hello Herb.

278
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,670
You can count on me,
you know that, don't you?

279
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,640
- I was figuring I might.
- You cleaned this town up.

280
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,850
You made it fit
for women and kids to live in.

281
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,220
Miller or nobody else'll never
drag it down again.

282
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,100
- I hoping people'd feel that way.
- What other way is there?

283
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,650
- How many men you got lined up?
- None yet.

284
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,450
Well, you better get going, man. I'll be back
in 10 minutes. Loaded for bear.

00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,850
Where is he?

00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,650
He's coming up the back way.
There's careful man.

[Knock on door]

290
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,780
- Come in, Mr Weaver.
- Hello Mrs. Ramirez.

291
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,580
- Hello. Sit down, please.
- Thanks

292
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,710
- Is there anything wrong, Mrs Ramirez?
- No.

293
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,710
Then,
why did you send for me?

294
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,300
I'm leaving town.
I want to sell the store.

295
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,930
- You want to buy me out?
- Well, how much did you want?

296
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,850
Two thousand.
I think that's fair.

297
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,480
It's fair alright, 
but I couldn't raise that much right now.

298
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,520
- How much can you raise?
- Oh... 1000 dollars.

299
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,150
All right you can pay Sam the rest
in six months.

300
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,370
- He'll get it to me. A deal?
- Yes, ma'am.

301
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,750
All right, Mr Weaver.
Thank you.

302
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,250
Mrs Ramirez, I want to
thank you for everything, I mean...

303
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,670
When you first put the deal to me
about staking me in the store,

304
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,640
and being a silent partner,
you know, my wife thought...

305
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,520
Err... What I really mean to say is that
you've been real decent to me right along,

306
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,690
and I want you to know
that I've been honest with you.

307
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,520
I know you have, Mr Weaver.
Goodbye.

308
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,900
Goodbye, Mrs Ramirez.
And good luck to you.

309
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,900
Thank you.

310
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,510
- Will..
- Amy. You've changed your mind.

311
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,140
I thought you'd
changed yours.

312
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,560
No, Will,
I have my ticket.

313
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,020
I see.

314
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,570

Mrs Miller is very particular.

- Is Helen Ramirez in?
- I guess so.

316
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,240
Think you can find it
alright?

317
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,820
[Knock on door]

318
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,210
Come in.

319
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,690
What are you looking at?
You think I have changed?

320
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,190
Well, what do you want?
You want me to help you?

321
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,610
You want me to ask Frank to let you go?
You want me to beg for you?

322
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,120
I would not do it.
I would not lift a finger for you.

323
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,210
I came to tell you he was coming.
I should've figured you know about it.

324
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,960
I know about it.

325
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,710
You ought to get out of town
or I might not be able to...well..

326
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,880
- Anything can happen.
- I'm not afraid of him.

327
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,890
I know you're not but you...
you know how he is.

328
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,220
I know
how he is.

329
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,980
Maybe he doesn't know.

330
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,030
- He's probably got letters.
- What about it?

331
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,660
Nothing in life is free.
I'm getting out. I'm packing.

332
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,500
That's good.

333
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
[In Spanish]
One day, mister.

334
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Sí, Rosa.

335
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,890
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Kane...

336
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,180
If you're smart,
you will get out, too.

337
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,190
- I can't.
- I know.

338
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,470
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

339
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,940
- Who is Miss Ramirez?
- Mrs Ramirez?

340
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,020
She used to be a friend of your husband's
a while back.

341
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,610
Before that
she was a friend of Frank Miller's.

342
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,990
I see.
Thank you.

343
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,160
- You don't like my husband, do you?
- No.

344
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,000
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

345
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,790
One thing, this place was always busy
when Frank Miller was around.

346
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,380
I'm not the only one.

347
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,170
There's plenty of people think
he's got a comeuppance coming.

348
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,590
You asked me, ma'am,
so I'm telling you.

349
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,040
- I'll go and get some liquor.
- You have to have it?

350
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,250
- Yeah.
- If you're going after that...

351
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,250
- I said I was going for liquor.
- Keep away from Kane.

352
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,170
Sure,
I can wait.

353
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,170
Cowboy:
Hiya, Harvey.

354
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,080
Hello, Harv.
Where's the tin star?

355
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,670
- I turned it in and quit.
- Smart move.

356
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,340
I didn't ask you
for your opinion.

357
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,160
Hey, Ben!
How are you?

358
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,330
Hey,
look who's here!

359
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,830
- How are you, Ben?
- Give me a bottle.

360
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,800
- It's been a long time, Ben.
- Yeah.

361
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,890
- Yes, sir.
- How's Frank?

362
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,640
- He's not complaining.
- It'll be a hot time in the old town tonight, eh?

363
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,070
I wouldn't be surprised.

364
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll give you odds Kane's dead five minutes
after Frank gets off the train.

365
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,750
- It's not much time.
- That's all Frank'll need, because I...

366
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,730
You carry a badge and a gun, Marshal.
You ain't got no call to do that.

367
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,320
You're right.

368
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,320
No.

369
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,630
I guess you all know
why I am here.

370
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,470
I need deputies.
I'll take all I can get.

371
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,220
You must be crazy comin' in here
to raise a posse.

372
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,730
Frank's got friends in this room.
You ought to know that.

373
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,770
Some of you were special deputies when we
broke this bunch. I need you again...now.

374
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Things were different then, Kane.

375
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,490
You had six steady deputies 
to start off with.

376
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Every one a top gun.
You ain't got but two now.

377
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:51,790
You ain't got two.
Harv Pell says he just quit. Why?

378
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,880
That's between the two of us.

379
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,760
You're asking an awful lot Kane,
considering the kind of man Frank Miller is.

380
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,510
All right
We all know what Miller's like.

381
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,310
That's why I'm here.
How about it?

382
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,310
[Crowd begins laughing]

383
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,310
" <i>He made a vow
while in state prison</i> "

384

or his'n</i>  "

but oh</i> "

" <i>Do not forsake me,
oh my darlin' </i>"

388
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,880
Mildred, he's coming.
Now you do like I told you.

389
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,890
I'm not home. Don't let him in.
No matter what he says, I'm not home.

390
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,430
Sam, he's your friend.

391
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,430
Don't argue with me. 
He'll be here in a second.

392
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,770
He won't believe me.
He'll know I'm lying.

393
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,770
You do as I tell you.

394
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,770
[Knock on door]

395
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:52,120
- Hello, Mrs Fuller. Is Sam in?
- No. No he isn't.

396
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,710
Do you know where he is, Mrs Fuller?
It's important to me, to find him.

397
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,340
I think... He's in church, Will.
He's gone to church.

398
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,670
Without you?

399
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,390
I'm gonna go in a little while,
as soon as I get dressed.

400
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,610
Thank you, Mrs Fuller.
Goodbye.

401
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,600
Well, what do you want?
Do you want me to get killed?

402
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,100
Do you want to be a widow?
Is that what you want?

403
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,270
No, Sam.
No.

404
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,310
Kane!

405
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:57,860
- What's the matter, Jimmy?
- Nothin'. I've been lookin' for you.

406
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,780
I wanna a gun. I wanna be with you
when that train comes in.

407
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:07,330
- Can...can you handle a gun?
- Sure I can. I used to be good.

408
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,160
Honest.
It ain't just gettin' even.

409
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:14,330
It's a chance. This is what I need.
Please Kane, let me get in on this.

410
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,970
All right, Jimmy.
I'll call you if I need you.

411
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,470
Get yourself a drink
meanwhile.

412
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,140
[Knock on door]

413
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,860
Come in,
Sam.

414
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,780
You're leavin' town?

415
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,450
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

416
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,370
This doesn't make much sense.

417
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
- You're afraid, huh? 
Afraid of Miller.

418
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,210
No.

419
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,550
Sure you are.
You wouldn't be runnin'.

420
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,840
You don't have to worry about as long as 
I'm around, you know that.

421
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,940
I'm not scared of Miller. 
I'll take him on any time.

422
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,140
I believe you.

423
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,140
Then why are you goin'?
You're cuttin' out with Kane.

424
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,940
- Oh, Harvey...
- Why are you goin'?

425
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,360
- What difference does it make?
- It's Kane! I know it's Kane!

426
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:20,860
It isn't Kane. I'm going to tell you something
about you and your friend Kane.

427
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,200
You're a good-looking boy,
you have big broad shoulders.

428
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,080
But he is a man.

429
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,000
It takes more than broad shoulders
to make a man, Harvey,

430
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,410
and you have a
long way to go.

431
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,380
You know something?
I don't think you'll ever make it.

432
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,840
Let me tell you something.
You're not goin' anywhere.

433
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,760
You're stayin' with me.
It's gonna be just like it was before.

434
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,190
You want to know why I'm leaving?
Then listen.

435
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,690
Kane will be a dead man in half an hour.
And nobody's going to do anything about it.

436
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,110
And when he dies, this town dies too.
I can feel it.

437
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,780
I'm all alone in the world,
I have to make a living.

438
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,000
So I'm going someplace else,
that's all.

439
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,170
And as for you, I don't like anybody to put
his hands on me unless I want him to.

440
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,220
And I don't like you to
...anymore.

441

Our text today
is from Malachi, chapter four.

<i>''For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn
as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all..''</i>

447
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,540
Yes?

448
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,050
I'm sorry, parson,
I don't want to disturb the services...

449
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:01,840
You already have. You don't
come to this church very often, Marshal.

450
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,300
When you got married today
you didn't see fit to be married here.

451
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,180
What can be so important
to bring you here now?

452
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,730
I need help.

453
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,070
It's true, I haven't been a churchgoing man,
and maybe that's a bad thing.

454
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,280
I didn't get married here today
because my wife is a Quaker.

455
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,370
But I came here for help
because there are people here.

456
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm sorry, Marshal.
Say what you have to say.

457
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,550
Maybe some of you already know it,
but if you don't...

458
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,720
It looks like Frank Miller
is coming back on the noon train.

459
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,850
I need all the special deputies
I can get.

460
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,280
Well,
what are we waiting for?

461
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,950
Let's go.

462
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,160
Hold it a minute,
hold it!

463
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:07,160
Before we rush out into something
that isn't going to be so pleasant,

464
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:10,160
let's make sure we know
what this is all about.

465
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:16,000
What I want to know is this. Ain't it true
that Kane ain't no longer a Marshal?

466
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,970
And ain't it true there is personal trouble
between Kane and Miller?

467
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,390
All right, alright!
Quiet, everybody!

468
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,520
If there's a difference of opinion,
let everybody have a say.

469
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,980
But let's do it like grown-up people,
and let's get the kids out of the building.

470
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,060
- Anything on the train?
- It's on time as far as I know, sir.

471
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,130
I say it don't really matter 
if there's anything...

472
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,530
personal between Miller 
and the Marshal, here.

473
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,330
We all know who Miller is,
and what Miller is.

474
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:30,330
- What's more, we're wasting time.
- All right Coy!

475
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,670
Yes, we all know who Miller is
and we put him away once.

476
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,210
And who saved him from hanging?
The politicians up north.

477
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,010
I say, this is their mess.
Let them take care of it.

478
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,510
- Fryer?
- Well, I say this:

479
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,930
We've been paying good money all along
for a Marshal and deputies.

480
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,940
The first time there's any trouble,
we're supposed to take care of it ourselves.

481
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,110
What have we been paying for
all this time?

482
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,650
I say we're not peace officers,
and this ain't our job!

483
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,780
I've been saying right along,
we ought to have more deputies.

484
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,660
If we did,
we wouldn't be facing this thing, now.

485
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:09,500
Just a minute, just a minute!
Everybody, quiet!

486
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,420
Keep it orderly.
You had your hand up, Ezra?

487
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,840
I can't believe I've heard
some of the things said here.

488
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,800
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

489
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:21,300
Sure, we paid this man,
and he was the best Marshal we ever had.

490
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,640
It ain't his trouble,
it's ours.

491
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,850
If we don't do what's right,
we're gonna have plenty more trouble.

492
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,980
There ain't but one thing to do now,
and you all know what that is.

493
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:34,520
- Go ahead, Kibbee.
- This thing has been handled wrong.

494
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,650
Those three killers
walking the streets bold as brass...

495
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,360
Why didn't you put them in jail
where they ought to be?

496
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,120
Then we'd only have Miller to worry about
instead of the four.

497
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:48,330
I haven't anything to arrest them for.
They haven't done anything.

498
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,210
There's no law against them
sitting on a bench at the depot.

499
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,130
I can't listen to any more of this.
What's the matter with you people?

500
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,200
Don'tca remember when 
a decent woman

501
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,300
couldn't walk down the street 
in broad daylight?

502
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,720
Don'tca remember when this wasn't a fit place
to bring up a child?

503
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:07,600
How can you sit here, and talk, and talk,
and talk like this?

504
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,190
What are we getting so excited about?
How do we know Miller's on that train?

505
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,780
We can be pretty sure he's on it.
Time's getting short.

506
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:23,490
- Parson, you got anything to say?
- I don't know.

507
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,410
The commandment says
<i>''thou shalt not kill''</i>

508
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,290
but we hire men to go out
and do it for us.

509
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,710
The right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here,

510
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,550
but if you're asking me to tell my people
to go out and kill,

511
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:42,890
and maybe get themselves killed, I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

512
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,010
All right,
I'll say this.

513
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:51,230
What this town owes Will Kane, it can never
pay with money. Don't ever forget it.

514
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,270
He's the best Marshal we've ever had,
and maybe the best we'll ever have.

515
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,030
So if Miller comes back here today,
it's our problem, not his.

516
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,160
It's our problem
because this is our town.

517
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,660
We made it with our own hands,
out of nothing.

518
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:10,160
If we want to keep it decent
we gotta think mighty clear today.

519
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:14,840
We gotta have the courage to do what is right,
no matter how hard it is.

520
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,720
All right! There's gonna be fighting
when Kane and Miller meet.

521
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,100
And somebody's going to get hurt,
that's for sure.

522
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,930
Now...
People up north are thinking about this town.

523
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:34,310
Thinking about sending money down here,
to put up stores and factories.

524
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,820
It would mean a lot to this town,
an awful lot.

525
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:43,990
But if they'll read about shooting in the streets,
what are they going to think?

526
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,950
I'll tell you. They'll think
this is just another wide-open town,

527
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,790
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

528
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,920
In one day, this town
will be sat back five years.

529
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,760
And I don't think
we can let that happen.

530
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,640
Mind you, you all know
how I feel about this man.

531
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:08,980
He's a mighty brave man, a good man.
He didn't have to come back here today.

532
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:14,900
And for his sake, and a sake of this town,
I wish he hadn't.

533
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,360
Because if he's not here
when Miller comes,

534
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:20,740
my hunch is,
there won't be any trouble, not one bit.

535
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,870
Tomorrow we'll have a new Marshal
and if we offer him our services,

536
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,200
I think we can handle anything
that comes along.

537
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:34,000
To me that makes sense.
To me that's the only way out of this.

538
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,010
Will, I think you better go
while there's still time.

539
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,760
It's better for you and...
it's better for us.

540
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,440
Thanks.

541
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:26,610
[Playing tune on harmonica]

542
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,140
Why don't you put
that thing away?

543
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,830
- Bang, bang, bang!
- You're dead, Kane.

544
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,830
"<i>Do not forsake me,
oh, my darlin',</i>"

545
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:02,830
" <i>On this,
our wedding daaayyy.</i>"

546
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:08,230
" <i>Do not forsake me,
oh, my daaarlin',</i> "

547
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:14,730
" <i>Waaait;
wait alone.</i> "

548
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:29,160
I just sent the kid to find you.
Didn't he come?

549
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,960
He was here.

550
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,210
You've been my friend all my life.
You got me this job.

551
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,050
You made them
send for me.

552
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,590
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted to be like you, Mart.

553
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:49,640
- You've been a law man all your life.
- Yeah, all my life. It's a great life.

554
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,810
You risk your skin catching killers,
and the juries turn them loose,

555
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,650
so they can come back,
and shoot at you again.

556
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,570
If you're honest,
you're poor your whole life.

557
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,950
And in the end you wind up dying all alone
on some dirty street.

558
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,160
For what?
For nothing. For a tin star.

559
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:13,290
Listen, the judge's left town, Harvey's quit,
and I'm having trouble getting deputies.

560
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,500
It figures.
It's all happening too sudden.

561
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,300
People got to talk themselves into law and 
order before they do anything about it.

562
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:26,430
Maybe because down deep they don't care.
They just don't care.

563
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,230
What'll I do,
Mart?

564
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,940
I was hopin' you
wouldn't come back.

565
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,660
- You know why I came back.
- But not to commit suicide.

566
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,410
Sometimes... 
Sometimes prison changes a man.

567
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:53,460
Not him. This is all planned,
that's why they're all here.

568
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:56,380
Get out, Will!
Get out.

569
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,430
Will you come down
to that depot with me?

570
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,890
No.

571
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,320
You know how I feel about you,
but I ain't goin' with you.

572
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:22,030
Seems like a man with busted knuckles
didn't need arthritis too, don't it?

573
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,910
No,
I couldn't do nothin' for you.

574
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,870
You'd be worried about me.
You'd get yourself killed worryin' about me.

575
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,250
It's too one-sided
like it is.

576
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,140
- So long, Martin.
- So long.

577
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,850
It's all for nothin', Will.
It's all for nothin'.

578
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:02,240
Excuse me,
what is Mrs Ramirez's room number?

579
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,120
- Three.
- Thank you.

580
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:25,390
Come in.

581
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,980
- Yes?
- Mrs Ramirez? I'm Mrs Kane.

582
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:34,270
I know.

583
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,820
- May I come in?
- If you like.

584
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,330
- Sit down, Mrs Kane.
- No, thank you.

585
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,460
- What do you want?
- Please...

586
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,790
It's just I'm afraid that if I sat down,
I wouldn't be able to get up again.

587
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,050
- Why?
- It wasn't easy for me to come here.

588
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,380
- Why?
- Look, Mrs Ramirez...

589
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:03,970
Will and I were married an hour ago.
We were all packed and ready to leave...

590
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,430
...then this thing happened
and he wouldn't go.

591
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,690
I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,
I just couldn't reach him.

592
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,400
- And now?
- That man downstairs, the clerk..

593
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:19,320
He said things about you
and Will

594
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,070
I've tried to understand
why he wouldn't go with me,

595
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,240
and it's got to be because of you.

596
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:28,620
- What do you want from me?
- Let him go.

597
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,960
He still has a chance.
Let him go.

598
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,670
- I can not help you.
- Please.

599
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,170
He isn't staying
for me.

600
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,050
I haven't spoken to him for a year,
until today.

601
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:48,730
- I'm leaving on the same train you are.
- Then why is he staying?

602
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,400
If you don't know,
I can not explain it to you.

603
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,900
Thank you anyway.
You've been very kind.

604
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:05,450
What kind of woman are you?
How can you leave him like this?

605
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,200
Does the sound of guns
frighten you that much?

606
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:11,630
No, Mrs Ramirez.
I've heard guns.

607
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:14,790
My father and my brother
were killed by guns.

608
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,260
They were on the right side, but that
didn't help them when the shooting started..

609
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,100
My brother was 19.
I watched him die.

610
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:29,270
That's when I became a Quaker.
I don't care who's right or who's wrong.

611
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,360
There's got to be some better way
for people to live.

612
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,690
Will knows how I feel about it.

613
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,120
Just a minute. Are you going to wait 
for the train downstairs?

614
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,740
- Yes.
- Why don't you wait here?

615
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,740
"<i>Do not forsake me,
oh, my darlin',</i>"

616
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:58,740
" <i>On this,
our wedding daaayyy.</i>"

617
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,370
" <i>Do not forsake me,
oh, my daaarlin',</i> "

618
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:05,760
I've got no use for Kane,
but he's got guts.

619
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:08,730
You're mighty broadminded, 
Joe.

620
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,670
How about you? I always figured you had guts,


621
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,070
but I never gave you credit for brains, 
until now.

622
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,820
What does that mean?

623
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,080
It takes a smart man
to know when to back away.

624
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,230
If I can't pick my company 
when I drink in here,

625
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,830
I ain't coming in here anymore.

626
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:37,710
Okay... All right
The boy with a tin star.

627
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:46,710
Bartender: All right boys, 
what are you gonna have?

628
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:08,310
Put a saddle on him, Kane.
Go on, saddle him up.

629
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,770
He'd go a long way
before he tires.

630
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,310
- That's what you were thinking, wasn't it?
- Kind of.

631
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,090
You're scared?

632
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,190
I guess so.

633
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,660
Sure.
Stands to reason.

634
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,410
Come on.
Let me help you.

635
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,340
Seems like all everybody and his brother
wants is to get me out of town.

636
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:41,680
Nobody wants to
see you get killed.

637
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:43,730
Where're you going?

638
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:45,140
I don't know.
Back to the office, I guess.

639
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:48,270
Oh, no. You're getting on that horse
and getting out.

640
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,180
What's the matter with you?

641
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,730
You were ready to do it yourself.
You said so.

642
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,570
Look, Harv. I thought about it
because I was tired.

643
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,570
You think about a lot of things
when you're tired. But I can't do it.

644
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,870
- Why?
- I don't know.

645
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,450
Get on that horse, 
Will!

646
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:11,170
Why is this so important?
You don't care if I live or die.

647
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,840
Come on.

648
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:16,840
Don't shove me, Harv. 
I'm tired of being shoved.

649
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:05,660
I hate this town.
I've always hated it.

650
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:09,000
To be a Mexican woman
in a town like this...

651
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:13,380
- I understand.
- You do?

652
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:18,670
That's good. I don't understand you,
no matter what you say.

653
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,510
If Kane was my man,
I'd never leave him. I'd get a gun.

654
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,970
- I'd fight
- Why don't you?

655
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:29,520
He's not my man.
He's yours.

- You have some clean water I can use?
- Why, sure, Marshal sit down.

661
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:07,220
- Running some kind of trouble, Marshal?
- No, no trouble.

[Hammering in distance]

663
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:14,570
- What're you building?
- Just fixing things up out back.

664
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:18,070
Now, take it easy, Mr Kane.
Settle back, that's it.

665
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:25,330
Fred, Fred! Hold it awhile.
Stop 'til I tell you to start again.

666
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,100
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Marshal.

667
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:51,440
- Oh, no charge...
- Tell your man he can go back to work now.

673
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:19,880
- Will!
- I guess I forgot about you, Herb.

674
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:24,680
- I'm sure glad you're here.
- Time's getting pretty short.

675
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:27,680
- Sure is.
- When are the other boys coming?

676
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:30,230
- We gotta make plans.
- The other boys?

677
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,310
There aren't any others
It's just you and me.

678
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,690
- You're joking.
- No, I couldn't get anybody.

679
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,990
I don't believe it!
This town ain't that low.

680
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,990
- I couldn't get anybody.
- Then it's just you and me.

681
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,450
- I guess so.
- You and me against all of them?

682
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,380
- That's right. Do you want out, Herb?
- Well..

683
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:58,880
It isn't that I want out, no.
You see...

684
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:03,430
- I didn't figure on anything like this.
- Neither did I.

685
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,850
I volunteered, you know I did.
I was ready.

686
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:12,480
I... I'm ready now, but this ain't like
what you said it was gonna be.

687
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:15,980
This is just committing suicide.
I'm no law man.

688
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:19,530
I just live here.
I got nothing personal against nobody.

689
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:23,370
- I got no stake in this.
- I guess not.

690
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,580
There's a limit how much you can ask a man.
What about my kids?

691
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,170
Go on home to your kids,
Herb.

692
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:40,130
You get some of the other fellows,
and I go still through with it.

693
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,300
Go on home,
Herb.

694
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:14,630

- I found them, all but Mr Henderson.

- You're welcome.

Marshal, let me fight with you.
I ain't afraid.

- No.
- Please, let me, Marshal!

698
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:30,980
- You're a kid, you're a baby.
- I'm 16!

699
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:35,730
- I can handle a gun, too.
- You're 14. What do you wanna lie for?

700
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,150
I'm big for my age.
Please, Marshal!

701
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:44,030
Well, you're big for your age,
but no, go on, get out of here.

Marshal!

707
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:06,580
Sure appreciate it.
Certainly do.

You don't happen to know
if the saloon's open, do you Will?

- Yes, sir.
