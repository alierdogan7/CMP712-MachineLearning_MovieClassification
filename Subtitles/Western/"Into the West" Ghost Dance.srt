paiute reservation
nevada

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,600
loved by the buffalo could not
change growling bear's vision.

6
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,400
now he sought to understand it.

7
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,970
new prophets came with new visions.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,500
loved by the buffalo listened in hope.

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,100
messiah. messiah.

10
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,900
my children...

11
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,900
brothers from all the nations...

12
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,500
you listen now.

13
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,900
i have been to the white man's heaven.

14
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,500
i have seen the white man's god.

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,000
and he say to me,
one day a great spirit will come,

16
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,760
bring back the buffalo,

17
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,400
and all dead indians will
come back and live again.

18
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,200
when this day comes,there
will be no more sickness.

19
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,800
all indians will be strong like young men.

20
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,600
be young again.

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,200
white people cannot hurt indians then.

22
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,700
do not tell the white people this.

23
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,300
follow my words.

24
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,760
go back to your people.

25
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,400
tell them to love one another.

26
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,900
do not fight.

27
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,960
do not steal.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
do not lie.

29
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,360
god showed me a dance

30
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,800
a dance to take to my people.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,700
go home.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
make this dance.

33
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,100
all indians dancing.

34
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,500
good times will come.

35
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,730
pine ridge reservation
south dakata
march,1890

36
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,390
10 years had passed since robert
and clara nhad left pennsylvania.

37
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,620
robert had seen the land's
promise turn bitter,

38
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,720
but he was determined to carry on
the best way he knew how.

39
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,710
yeah,the burial scaffolds
are outlawed now.

40
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,160
lot of things have changed since
they split up the reservation last year.

41
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,090
now you've got pockets
of white settlers all over.

42
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,840
i imagined it
so differently.

43
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,540
10 years
is a long time,george.

44
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,530
stand aside,please.

45
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,100
you give something.

46
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,020
these rations are property
of the u.s. government.

47
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,120
i'm just the man
who delivers them.

48
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,700
government
have no stomach.

49
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,920
you're going to have to get
your rations from agent royer.

50
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,690
royer.

51
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,950
i'm sorry for your plight,

52
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,520
but there's nothing
i can do.

53
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,790
now please stand aside.

54
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,850
when your children
cry for food,

55
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,560
you will do nothing?

56
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,280
do you people
want your rations or not?

57
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,980
pay attention. next.

58
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,550
no distribution
till the line is straight.

59
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,140
can't you people understand
what straight means?

60
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,180
next.

61
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,070
metal breasts

62
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,240
what's the news,
wheeler?

63
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,410
well,you're the reporters.

64
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,300
you tell me.

65
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,050
looks like he's got
nothing for us...

66
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,380
as usual.

67
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,510
well,i'm sorry
to disappoint your readers.

68
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,890
you'd think with all the hauling
you do between here and standing rock

69
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,060
you'd see at least one
young buck on the warpath.

70
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,810
you know,you boys could stand
to get out of the agency for a spell.

71
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,780
why don't you talk
to george?

72
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,470
he just arrived here on the
overnight out of new york city.

73
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,620
i'm sure he'd be happy
to share his impressions.

74
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,380
next.

75
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,640
royer around?

76
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,020
you know he never shows
his face on issue day.

77
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,480
next.

78
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,350
only coffee,flour,
and blanket this month.

79
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,740
- no meat?
- no meat,no sugar.

80
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,730
- flour,coffee,blanket.next.
- want bacon.

81
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,210
children very sick.
need food.

82
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,590
bacon is meat.

83
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,260
next.

84
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,020
ingrates.

85
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,720
you holding back
on us here,wheeler?

86
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,650
why i want to talk
to royer.

87
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,820
a little business matter.

88
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,710
next.

89
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,750
no long hair.
no more than one wife.

90
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,850
no heathenish ways.

91
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
no old religion.

92
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,690
no drinking.

93
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,990
no language but english.

94
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,150
if you can accept
these things,

95
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,850
then step over there
and pick up your uniforms.

96
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,410
indian police are doing well.

97
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,150
well,can't blame 'em for
wanting something better,i suppose.

98
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,880
things took a bad turn
back in '88.

99
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,580
crops failed
two years running.

100
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,890
and the indians weren't
the only ones who suffered.

101
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,960
we were
damn near wiped out.

102
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,410
but clara,the boy,
and me,

103
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,380
we saw ourselves
through.

104
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,500
she can't wait
to see you.

105
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,930
"to see a world
in a grain of sand,

106
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,690
"and heaven
in a wild flower,

107
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,290
"hold infinity
in the palm of your hand

108
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,420
and eternity in an hour."

109
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,090
isn't that
a wonderful thought?

110
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,500
to see a world
in a grain of sand.

111
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,020
how many times do we look
without seeing?

112
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,120
poetry teaches us
to see things in a different way.

113
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,740
there's no reason
to be afraid of it.

114
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,800
who wants to try?

115
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,510
read among
yourselves. quietly.

116
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,860
quite a dapper eastern
gentleman you've become.

117
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,950
yeah. it's good
to see you,miss clara.

118
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,560
don't be so formal.
it's just plain clara now.

119
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,190
yes,ma'am.

120
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,450
i believe i'll let you two
get reacquainted.

121
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,920
i've got some business
with royer.

122
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,220
come meet my pupils.

123
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,550
class,i want you to meet
george voices that carry.

124
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,870
george was a student of mine
a long time ago.

125
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,810
he used to live here
in pine ridge.

126
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,190
now he's come back,
i hope to teach.

127
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,130
no,not to teach.

128
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,110
to learn.

129
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,190
i have lived among
the white men for many years,

130
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,770
but i am still lakota...

131
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,760
like you,

132
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,560
and there is much
to learn from our people.

133
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,000
congress sets the policy,
mr. wheeler.

134
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,890
i'm merely charged with
carrying out its intent.

135
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,740
the beef allotment to this agency
has been reduced by one million pounds.

136
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,870
washington takes its census
numbers quite seriously.

137
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,240
well,it seems pretty damn
short-sighted,if you ask me.

138
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,250
and what about
this bill of lading?

139
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,370
- couldn't bring myself to refuse 'em.
- they were starving.

140
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,250
i'll pay for
the lost goods in full.

141
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,770
your charity only exacerbates
a difficult situation,mr. wheeler.

142
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,280
you may want to have
a look at this.

143
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,790
my colleague at standing rock,
mr. mclaughlin,

144
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,610
informs me that rumors
of an indian messiah

145
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,500
are spreading like wildfire.

146
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,990
he reassures me
it is only a minor annoyance,

147
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,660
but i have my doubts.

148
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,140
well,no telling where
desperate people will find hope.

149
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,060
i can only do so much,
mr. wheeler.

150
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,380
more than that
i am not allowed.

151
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,020
these people are suspicious
of any changes.

152
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,140
your predecessor
colonel gallagher

153
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,090
was a hard man,
but fair.

154
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,770
- they'd come to respect him.
- be that as it may

155
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,520
the new administration has
selected me to see to its affairs.

156
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,850
well,maybe when you've been here a little longer--

157
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,770
as you say.

158
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,330
is there anything else
you wish to discuss?

159
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,860
no.

160
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,360
no,i figure
we're through.

161
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,430
i'll say good day then.

162
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,240
let's go,people.
keep it moving.

163
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,600
where is your mother?

164
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,250
our mother can not feed us

165
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,840
sitting bull's camp
standing rock reservation

166
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,100
i'm looking for red lance,

167
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,270
son of white crow,
grandson of running fox.

168
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,360
who looks for
red lance?

169
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,790
his brother,
voices that carry

170
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,610
little brother,
look at you.

171
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,220
did they drink your blood,
turn you into a wasichu?

172
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,510
the wasichu
did not defeat us.

173
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,950
it was the wind and the snow of our
grandmother's land that was our enemy.

174
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,750
and our father
and grandfather?

175
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,760
i'm sorry,brother,
truly.

176
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,820
sitting bull was the last
to give up his rifle and horse.

177
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,620
the long knives,
they promised us land,

178
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,420
but they lied.

179
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,690
they made us prisoners.

180
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,410
all of you?

181
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,350
two years the soldiers
watched over our tipis,

182
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,920
and then long hair
came and took us.

183
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,210
buffalo bill.

184
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,910
he said he would
pay us to be indians.

185
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,940
he showed us how to make faces
and shake our tomahawks around.

186
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,870
i've come to stay,
brother.

187
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,200
this is good.

188
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,600
the messiah's medicine
is powerful

189
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,750
many saw their relatives
in the next world

190
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,090
this dance will make
many problems

191
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,250
does the messiah say we
will fight the white man?

192
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,850
no

193
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,260
when the time comes,
the white man will go away

194
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,240
let the dance be
taught to our people

195
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,770
you believe in this man
wovoka's vision?

196
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,990
i believe in hope

197
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,930
june,1890

198
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,970
red cloud could stop this
nonsense with a word,

199
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,250
but the old codger says
it's nothing to do with him.

200
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,260
as i understand
the dogma,sir,

201
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,880
it shares many of our own
christian principles.

202
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,870
a harmless version of their
outlawed sun dance.

203
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,800
looks more like
a war dance to me.

204
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,490
and you,mr. wheeler,do you consider
this demonstration harmless?

205
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,740
well,this ought to be
interesting,boys.

206
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,090
i don't see
any call for that.

207
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,190
i'll thank you to stay out
of government business,
mr. wheeler.

208
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,050
this obscene display
will cease immediately!

209
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,770
this prayer.
white people pray,

210
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,800
go heaven.

211
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,870
we go heaven,too.

212
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,240
you will stop dancing
and disperse!

213
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:02,090
we should call him...

214
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,460
young man afraid of indians

215
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,250
get outta my way.

216
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,090
take this down,mr. duffy.
make it fast,lang.

217
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,430
to the editor,
new york herald.

218
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,750
uh,"the long-awaited violence
here finally exploded today--"

219
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,800
"exploded."
i like that.

220
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,390
"when a band of armed hostiles
confronted the government's agent.

221
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,930
"against impossible odds,

"it is common knowledge in these parts
that the sioux never dance this.

september,1890

228
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,670
you must be jedediah.

229
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,490
you're--you're him.

230
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,300
i reckon i am.

231
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,300
welcome.

232
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,530
welcome.

233
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,670
when a man gets to
a certain age,

234
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,800
he wants to be close to those
folks that mean something to him.

235
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,430
what family
we have left is...

236
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,190
they're still
in these parts.

237
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,130
but it has all
changed so much.

238
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,040
makes you wonder what it's
gonna be like 100 years from now.

239
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,320
bigger and faster.

240
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,080
better,i suppose.

241
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,270
don't know
about better.

242
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,290
sir...

243
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,250
do i look anything
like jedediah smith?

244
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,640
there's only one
jedediah smith,son.

245
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,740
but...

246
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,470
let's have a look-see here.

247
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,140
well,if you--you put on
a few pounds

248
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,080
and a few score years,
and...

249
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,400
rounded it off
with a beard,i'd say...

250
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,250
nope. nothing like him.

251
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,530
i often dream of
margaret light shines.

252
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,400
and you've had
no word of her?

253
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,910
no. not a day goes by that
i don't wish i could see my children again.

254
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,400
is she's on the reservation,
robert will find her.

255
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,170
you can count on it.

256
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,450
closer together now,
fellas.

257
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,110
that's it.

258
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,900
all you bucks,give me
a--a ferocious look.

259
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,500
that's good.

260
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,470
all right now.
uh...sergeant,

261
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,000
take the rifle
off the chief

262
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,830
and--and hold it up.

263
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,720
a little higher.

264
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,830
there it is!

265
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,400
hold still now.

266
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,320
"intrepid pine ridge
police sergeants

267
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,790
"old coyote
and yellow earring

hostiles on the warpath

269
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,380
with custer's own rifles."

270
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,140
yeah,that's good.

271
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,740
1...

272
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,300
2...

273
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,490
3!

274
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,080
huh?
that was perfect.

275
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,480
drink up,gentlemen.

276
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,310
thank you so much.

277
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,940
they are gonna
eat this up in new york.

278
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,820
you got permission
for that?

279
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,000
i got permission.
ask royer.

280
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,310
you might have
seen her yourself.

281
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,580
i don't keep track
of faces.

282
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,850
standing rock reservation

283
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,340
you let the fire go out.

284
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,460
didn't notice.

285
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,850
what good are all
these white man's books

286
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,330
if you don't know
when you're cold?

287
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,530
it's not that cold.

288
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,940
you,uh...
read all these books?

289
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,910
there's much
to learn from them.

290
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,030
what good
is this knowledge?

291
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,980
you have many questions,
red lance,but

292
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,750
you have no desire
to hear my answers.

293
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,250
and you do not
wish to learn.

294
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,310
i've told you.

295
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,310
the ghost dance
is only superstition.

296
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,560
spirits can't
help our people.

297
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,180
only we can do that
for ourselves.

298
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,110
you do not have ears.
you will not listen.

299
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,710
i bring you the
promise of a day

300
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,740
when no white man
will treat us badly again

301
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,530
when the sacred dead
will live again

302
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,980
it is impossible for a
dead man to live again

303
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,660
the white hair at the
agency,mclanghlin

304
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,940
says soldiers will
stop this dance

305
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:56,440
the soldiers will
harm no one

306
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,950
the messiah has
sent me a vision

307
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,290
the shirt is powerful medicine

308
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,240
it will stop the soldiers' bullets

309
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:17,010
red cloud and big foot's
people are dancing

310
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,440
sitting bull's people
must also dance

311
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,420
cotton will not stop
a lead bullet

312
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,080
no matter what
kicking bear says.

313
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:40,520
to say "believe"
or "do not believe,"

314
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,970
this is the white man's way.

315
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,800
let them dance

316
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,080
this pernicious item,
gentlemen,

317
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,480
is known as
a ghost shirt.

318
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,830
among its many powers,

319
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,680
it is alleged
to stop bullets.

320
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,510
so let us not deny further
that trouble is imminent.

321
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,650
every one of these hostiles
is prepared to use violence.

322
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,440
i've been
among them before.

323
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,050
question is: what are you
going to do about it?

324
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,520
we can do nothing until the interior
department and the war department

325
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,630
provide explicit
instructions.

326
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,090
until then,
we must all wait

327
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,050
and be on our guard
at the first sign of outbreak.

328
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,220
if you just
leave it alone,

329
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,440
and likely as not,

330
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,630
the whole craze will just
die out on its own.

331
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,490
mr. mclaughlin at standing rock
believes that

332
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,960
as long as a single malcontent
like sitting bull remains at large,

333
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,340
that we cannot
be secure.

334
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,190
and i concur.

335
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,870
if you lock up
the ringleaders--

336
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,410
then you're gonna have
a real problem on your hands...

337
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,290
not just in
your imagination.

338
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,630
is this a ghost shirt?

339
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,290
ghost shirt,savvy?

340
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,600
ghost shirt.

341
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,320
what will you
take for it?

342
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,360
you...and me.

343
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,670
we make trade.

344
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:18,390
- trade.
- that's right.

345
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,950
you want my camera.

346
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,560
what's a squaw know
about taking pictures.

347
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,620
i'll tell you what.

348
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,850
i'll give you...

349
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,290
two american dollars.

350
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,500
no can do.

351
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,860
it's not for sale.

352
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,070
hey,another camera's
easy to come by.

353
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,560
where in the hell else are you
gonna find another ghost shirt?

354
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:08,470
lady,you got yourself
a deal.

355
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,190
- how about that?
- that's nice.real nice.

356
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,380
- and bulletproof.
- better not try it.

357
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,550
needs mending.

358
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,770
we best see to it.

359
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,890
look at that.

360
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,190
i'll be doggoned.

361
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,240
i'm gonna go back
to the barn

362
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,240
and get some extra wire
and tools and whatnot,

363
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,580
and we'll--we'll fix her.

364
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,330
they busted in.

365
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:39,270
won't they just
bust out again?

366
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,630
no,i don't think so.

367
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,870
well,why not?

368
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:50,760
maybe because this
is the land they remember.

369
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,430
father.

370
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,630
it makes my heart glad
to see you with these children.

371
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,510
you are a good mother
to them.

372
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,890
as you were to me.

373
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,730
my wandering must have
caused you great worry and pain.

374
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,860
forgive me.

375
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,500
you were always
our family's seeker.

376
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,660
but the road you have chosen
has not been easy.

377
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,820
they were
so many times

378
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,390
when i thought
it was impossible to go on.

379
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,790
but i remembered
your strength,

380
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,680
how you carried on even
after we thought father had died.

381
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,610
that was the greatest
gift you gave to me.

382
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,230
you helped me to endure.

383
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,480
to live.

384
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,300
when you're ready,
you look through here,

385
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,590
then you press this button.

386
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,070
i'm happy you
still take pictures.

387
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,500
i didn't...

388
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,840
after sand creek.

389
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,720
but it is
all different now.

390
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:47,480
"when in disgrace
with fortune in men's eyes,

391
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,390
"i all alone be weep
my outcast state,

392
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,160
"and trouble deaf heaven
with my bootless cries,

393
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,830
desiring this man's art,
and that man's scope."

394
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,210
what do you
say now,mr. wheeler?

395
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,680
do you still
think this craze,

396
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,020
as you call it,
is dying out?

397
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,130
well,i have put up
with quite enough of this lunacy,

398
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,410
and i intend
to do something about it.

399
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,060
duffy,take this down.

400
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,870
to the commissioner
of indian affairs in washington,

401
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,690
wild indians are dancing,

402
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,520
and cannot be
induced to stop.

403
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,150
the ghost dance has now
assumed such proportions,

404
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,640
both in the number,and the spirit
of the adherents,

405
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,970
that it is entirely beyond the control
of the agent and the police force

406
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,800
who are openly defied
by the dancers.

407
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,010
the employees and the government property
of this agency has no protection,

408
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,470
and we are at the mercy
of these dancers.

409
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,200
we need protection,
and we need it now.

410
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,660
this agent suggests
sending a body of troops

411
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,660
sufficient to arrest
the leaders therein,

412
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,990
and imprison them,

413
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,650
and disarm the balance
of the reservation.

414
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,010
nothing short of
a thousand troops,

415
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,940
backed by
the proper artillery,

416
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:23,220
will stop the proliferation
of this diabolical dance.

417
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,870
god bless ya,boys!

418
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:41,720
december,1890

419
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,180
colonel forsyth,

420
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,830
we are friends
of the agent.

421
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,510
we are friends
of the soldiers.

422
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,860
the great father's friends
are my friends,too.

423
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,310
i want not any trouble
for my people.

424
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,920
we have no guns
to fight with.

425
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,650
we have
nothing to eat.

426
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,550
we are too poor
to do anything.

427
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,890
you're not too poor
to dance your ghost dance.

428
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,370
many say i have
been to this dance.

429
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,540
that is not right.

430
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,020
my eyes are sore.

431
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,000
they do not
see very well.

432
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,160
but,when they better,
i go and see.

433
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,990
we do not ask you to see it,
we ask you to stop it.

434
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,320
when winter comes,
dancing stops.

435
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,890
there will be
no problems.

436
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,330
many of your people have
taken to the badlands.

437
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,020
if they do not return

438
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,980
we'll have no choice
but to consider them hostile.

439
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:19,060
they think the soldiers
have come to kill us.

440
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,920
i not believe this,

441
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,270
but they are afraid
for their families.

442
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,550
you understand.

443
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,480
and the warriors
with them?

444
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,320
what's to keep them
from joining up with kicking bear

445
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,620
or the other
renegades?

446
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,970
that is all i have to
say about this question.

447
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,810
"the belligerent
old scalp-taker

448
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,200
"harangued his listeners
with a brazen speech

449
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,690
"in which imminent
hostilities were threatened.

450
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,660
"the army can do nothing until the
murdering redskins have broken out,

451
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,010
"and the young bucks have
burned a dozen ranches,

452
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,900
and slaughtered a score
of women and children--"

453
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,650
general miles' orders
are quite specific.

454
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,420
to offer protection,
and maintain control and discipline.

455
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,320
so we're all just
expected to sit here?

456
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,620
in the meantime,you are
directed not to force any issue

457
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,470
that might result
in an outbreak.

458
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,250
discretion,mr. royer.

459
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,500
if you and the other civilian au
horities had demonstrated as much,

460
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,720
the seventh would not
be here now to enforce order.

461
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,270
what's going on?

462
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,940
word is sitting bull's
headed this way

463
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,040
to join the renegades
in the badlands.

464
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,800
we'll be read for him.

465
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,990
i caution you
against any supply trips

466
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,510
through standing rock
in the next few days,mr. wheeler.

467
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,600
why is that?

468
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,240
general miles has
authorized sitting bull's arrest.

469
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,790
wouldn't it be better
to wait till ration day?

470
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:37,990
the fewer of
his people around,

471
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,350
less cause there'll be
for a disagreement.

472
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,930
sitting bull's actions
require his immediate apprehension.

473
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,650
well,could be
just rumor.

474
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,930
whatever the people
of the press are telling you.

475
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,120
i provide you this information
with regard to your own safety,mr. wheeler.

476
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,760
what you wish
to do with it
is not my concern.

477
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,260
take it.

478
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,250
i can't.

479
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,470
you are false to your people
if you do not wear the ghost shirt.

480
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,310
this way is the way
to death,red lance.

481
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,610
maybe we can
find our own road.

482
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,740
maybe we can
find our own
destiny again.

483
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,940
what are you doing?

484
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,820
you have
too many wasichu ways.

485
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,650
you even think
like a wasichu!

486
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,930
you play the savage
for money,red lance!not me!

487
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,400
indian police.

488
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,860
what do you want here?

489
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,210
you are my prisoner.

490
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,100
you must
go into the agency.

491
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,790
we were warriors together

492
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:59,360
now you do the white man's bidding

493
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,840
let go of me!

494
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,230
coming through!

495
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,660
keep moving!

496
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,990
sitting bull
is under arrest.

497
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,480
do not take him!

498
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,430
protect our chief

499
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:30,580
no!

500
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,920
come with us.

501
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,280
white hair mclaughlin
only wants to talk with you.

502
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,310
don't listen to
these troublemakers.

503
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:39,850
come on.

504
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,270
december 24,1890

505
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,740
move it to the right
a little more.

506
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,680
apart from a few
minor skirmishes,

507
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,140
most of the fugitives have
been persuaded to return peaceably.

508
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,570
hunger can be a powerful
inducement to surrender.

509
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,280
we've still got thousands
holed up in the badlands,

510
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:17,760
and no telling how many of sitting
bull's people racing
to meet them.

511
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,770
our principal concern
is chief big foot.

512
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,810
abandoned his camp on the
cheyenne river several days ago.

513
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,080
lieutenant colonel sumner
intercepted him,

514
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,930
and demanded
his immediate return.

515
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,080
big foot
promised to do so,

516
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,750
but during the night,
he slipped away.

517
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,720
where is he now?

518
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,230
we think he intends to join
the rebels in a badland stronghold.

519
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,400
i await word from
our scouting parties.

520
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:44,400
a very merry
christmas indeed.

521
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,720
he's wanted for the murder
of an indian policeman.

522
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,910
you don't know
the circumstances.

523
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,170
clara,the circumstances
don't matter.

524
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,600
if they catch him,
they'll shoot him.

525
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,370
surely,you're exaggerating.

526
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,910
have you seen
what these

527
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,060
so-called reporters
are writing?

528
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,740
"the murderous redskins
are now whetting their knives

529
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:14,960
"in anticipation of the moment
when they begin their bloody work."

530
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,980
anybody with eyes in their head
can see the agency's peaceful.

531
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:24,180
if george did kill somebody,

532
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:26,560
he did it with provocation.

533
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,510
we'll say a prayer for him.

534
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,050
he has the protection
of tatanka.

535
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,630
that is enough.

536
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,720
where do you come from?

537
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,350
we come from the place where...

538
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,100
the police have killed sitting bull

539
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,430
standing rock

540
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,190
we will go to pine ridge

541
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,320
to red cloud's people

542
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:50,670
red cloud will help us

543
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,660
we saw sighs of many long knives

544
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,400
if the long knives come

545
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,360
we will talk to them

546
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,090
let there be no fighting

547
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,970
i'm not who
i once was,grandfather.

548
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,700
none of us
are who we were.

549
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:31,720
it is enough that you have
returned to your people.

550
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,000
i,uh...i killed a man.

551
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,270
not a wasichu.

552
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,390
another lakota.

553
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,230
i saw a darkness
inside of you.

554
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,590
now i understand.

555
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,690
i've lost my center.

556
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,710
the world has
lost its center.

557
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,250
you ready for
your christmas present?

558
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:34,890
huh?

559
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,360
halt!

560
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:16,000
december 28,1890

561
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,870
i won't parley with you.

562
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:50,610
it's either unconditional
surrender or fight.

563
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,040
what is your answer?

564
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,360
we'll fight.

565
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,480
where were you headed?

566
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,210
pine ridge.

567
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,280
make peace.

568
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,800
you lied to our troops
once before.

569
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,230
why should we
believe you now?

570
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,340
no lie.

571
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,490
i'm glad to find you
peaceable.

572
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,790
you and your people will
follow us back to our camp.

573
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,870
we'll provide
blankets,rations.

574
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,720
i'll,uh,
have an ambulance sent forward.

575
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,350
you'll ride
more comfortably.

576
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,470
i guess i'm sick today.

577
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,820
how far is the camp?

578
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:34,060
5 miles. the creek
called wounded knee.

579
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,070
you can't see 400 people on this

580
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:16,750
your job is to deliver the required
rations to wounded knee,mr. wheeler,

581
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,450
not to question
the order.

582
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,050
i'm--i'm not questioning it.
i'm just saying.

583
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,200
don't fail to bring back
your keen eyewitness observations.

584
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,820
why don't you climb aboard
and see for yourself?

585
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,340
uh,thanks,wheeler,
but,uh,

586
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:33,110
i'm forced to remain
in the thick of activity.

587
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,540
yeah.you style yourselves
"war correspondents,"

588
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,490
but the only fighting you've seen
is at the bar at the hillsgate hotel

589
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,090
where you lubricate
your vivid imaginations.

590
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,100
pine ridge,
south dakota.

591
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,140
sunday,december 28th.

592
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,970
the indian war here
has collapsed.

593
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,660
chief big foot's
defeated hostiles

594
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,060
rest fewer than 30 miles
from this agency,

595
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,740
apprehended by the gallant men
of the famed 7th cavalry.

596
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,440
the chief's surrender
is all but certain

597
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,130
to flush out those bands
of renegades

598
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:06,740
which for too long
have held this agency

599
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,590
and its surrounding settlements
in a virtual state of siege.

600
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,690
all civilized people here
await big foot's return

601
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,240
and give thanks
in this time of peace

602
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,430
that the indian troubles are
about to be brought to a close

603
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,940
without further sacrifice
of life.

604
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,150
here you go.

605
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,830
this is for big foot.

606
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,430
somethin' else
to keep you warm.

607
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,250
army regulation
wool underwear.

608
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,200
this good medicine.

609
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,670
the best.

610
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,650
here,take a pair
for yourself.

611
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:25,710
go on,take 'em.

612
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,220
he cannot hear.

613
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,310
they say some of sitting bull's
people are here with you.

614
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,370
i'm lookin' for
a friend of mine.

615
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:41,950
he's young,speaks english.

616
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:45,010
his name's voices that carry.

617
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:51,280
i know this man

618
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,360
i cannot go back with you.

619
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:13,700
i don't understand.

620
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,570
i thought it was possible

621
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,870
to bridge the indian's world
and the white man's world.

622
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:21,510
- you are that bridge,george.
- no.

623
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:26,400
when i was back east,people looked
at me as an educated indian.

624
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:30,640
something different.
a curiosity.

625
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,680
i see that now.

626
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,860
i lived among the white men,
but i never belonged.

627
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,220
and you belong here?

628
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,950
i belong nowhere...

629
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,540
this is what i've learned.

630
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:50,680
this has been
my real education.

631
01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:01,890
i am grateful to you for everything
you've done for me,my friend.

632
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,860
george.

633
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:11,640
good-bye.

634
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:48,370
december 29,1890

635
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,440
the colonel wants your men to
fetch yourselves up to big foot's tent .

636
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,460
parley. you savvy?

637
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,710

638

parley!

639
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,280
before taking your people
to pine ridge,

640
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:11,410
we must ask that you surrender
any arms in your possession.

641
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:18,360
those with guns or rifles
may now step forward

642
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,410
one by one

643
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,230
and lay down their weapons.

644
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,220
who else?

645
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:06,270
surely this cannot
be all of them.

646
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,810
no more guns.

647
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:15,830
have i not put you in an ambulance
and have my doctor look after you?

648
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,960
did i not put you
in a good tent

649
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:21,430
with a stove to make you
warm and comfortable?

650
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:26,160
did i not feed your people?

651
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:31,430
yet now,big foot repays
my kindness with lying?

652
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,780
no more guns.

653
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,560
very well.

654
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:46,530
- sergeant!
- sir.

655
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:51,120
you and your men search
the village tipi by tipi.

656
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,040
troop! detail!

657
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,350

658
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:25,040
let me in.

659
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,210
tell that man
to sit down!

660
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,090
when circle finish,
he sit down.

661
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:08,440
i have lived long enough

662
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:35,490
where is the rest?

663
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:36,830
that's the lot
of it,sir.

664
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:40,100
i was led to believe
this band was better armed.

665
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:03,240
you. get up.

666
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,130
damn it.

667
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:12,340
why do you want my gun?

668
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:14,080
can't you see?
he's deaf!

669
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,390
let go!

670
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:25,180
nooo!

671
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,130
fire!

672
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,070
no!

673
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:43,790
fire!

674
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,830
what should we do,sir?!

675
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:10,840
thy kingdom come,thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.

676
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:12,490
give us this day
our daily bread

677
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:13,630
and forgive us
our trespasses

678
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:16,190
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

679
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,010
and lead us not
into temptation.

680
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:14,090
what is she saying?

681
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:19,160
she said they told her
if she put on the dress

682
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:21,880
the bullets would not
go through.

683
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:28,240
why would anyone
shoot women and children?

684
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:54,120
robert! robert!

685
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,980
is he gonna be all right?

686
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:00,440
looks like
a bad shrapnel wound.

687
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,310
he'll pull through it,

688
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,990
but i can't speak
for the leg.

689
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,230
here. keep that tight.

690
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:25,680
you're all to return to your
homes immediately and stay there.

691
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:29,420
until the situation at wounded knee
and the badlands is fully resolved,

692
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:32,320
this agency
is under martial law.

693
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:36,230
anyone violating the curfew
or found holding a meeting

694
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:39,140
will be arrested on site.

695
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,920
can you tell us
what happened out there?

696
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,030
well,reports from the field
are still coming in,

697
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,080
but as best as
i can ascertain,

698
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,930
the indians fired first.

699
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,970

01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:52,610

703
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,240

man performing a death rite!

705
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:22,200

706
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:26,980
i am called lovede by the buffalo

707
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:34,540
my mother is thunder heart woman

708
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:47,680
help me

709
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:58,350
that day,

710
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:04,530
i saw growling bear's vision
come to pass.

711
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:08,020
my heart was sad,

712
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:12,630
but our people still live.

713
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:20,120
we live,
and so we have hope.

714
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:27,140
well,that's the story as is.
i know how to tell it.

715
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:31,350
now somebody else might
tell it a little differently.

716
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:37,010
you see,the only history
a man knows for certain

717
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:41,830
is that small part
he owns for himself.

718
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:44,420
you can't forget we're
all part of the same wheel--

719
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,320
the hubs and the spokes
and the felloes.

720
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:53,560
you break one
and you break the wheel.

721
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:56,560
when you tell your stories,

722
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:59,980
you touch your grandmothers

723
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,030
and grandfathers.

724
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:08,660
and all the ancestors
who walk before them.

725
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:12,600
and when others ask you
where you know these things,

726
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,050
tell them...

727
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:24,270
loved by the buffalo was spared
so i can tell you this story.

728
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,700
i want you to remember
these stories,jedediah.

729
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:31,960
so when your time comes,
you can pass 'em on.

730
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:37,120
it's important for people
to know where they came from

731
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,600
and what others
have been through.

732
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:44,060
i always told my children,
i said,

733
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:48,330
"you are one part virginia
and one part lakota.

734
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,490
be proud of both."

735
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:55,400
now this story
belongs to you.

736
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,000
into the weat
part 6
the end

737
