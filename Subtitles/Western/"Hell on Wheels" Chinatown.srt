180
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,428
I come to see you distribute
the Chinese payroll square.

181
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,736
Payroll distribution has
continued without incident.

182
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:56,372
You're skimming the wages. That stops now.

183
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,846
This is very unusual,

184
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:08,150
a white man coming into my establishment

185
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:11,387
to lecture me on how I conduct my business.

186
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,222
The railroad is my business, Mr. Chang,

187
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:14,790
and all the workers on it.

188
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:19,528
Well, the Chinese workers are contracted
through my company, Mr. Bohannon,

189
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:21,496
for a negotiated price.

190
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:26,334
How we then compensate those
workers is Chinese business.

191
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:37,879
You sell your dope, pimp your whores.

192
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:41,149
If you don't want me back in here regular,

193
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:43,084
pay the workers what they're owed.

194
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:47,088
Give my regards to Mr. Tao.

195
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:58,632
He's a pirate, whelped
aboard a British opium ship

196
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,602
commandeered in South China sea.

197
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:04,171
Chang's father was a Manchurian prince

198
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:08,909
who turned to piracy after a
failed plot to murder his brother.

199
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:11,445
But it was his mother,

200
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:14,948
a Polynesian beauty pillaged
from her tribe of cannibals,

201
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:19,252
that gave him his taste for human flesh.

202
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,855

203

00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,696
Uh, it's nothing your daddy can't handle.

206
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:34,617
Chang is, uh, stealing from
his own people, though.

207
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:37,236
That's between him and his Chinese.

208
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,172
- Doesn't concern us.
- Concerns the workers.

209
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:44,210
Chang provides our workforce, Mr. Bohannon.

210
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:47,413
And he takes a little from them
off the top, that's his business.

211
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:50,349
Them Chinese struck last year over wages.

212
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:52,451
Now they got Chang taking a piece.

213
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,021
Only a matter of time
till they strike again.

214
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:56,755
Chang keeps them in line.

215
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,761

00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:05,989

357
00:31:29,082 --> 00:31:31,650
You're pretty well-spoke for
a heathen, ain't you, Chang?

358
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:57,108
Men like you and I make our own fates,

359
00:31:58,276 --> 00:31:59,877
don't we, Mr. Bohannon?

360
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:02,213
Our own luck.

361
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:05,349
It wasn't the stars that brought you
into my rice shop this morning,

362
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:08,018
or to my pleasure house this afternoon.

363
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:12,423
It was both railroad business, Mr. Chang.

364
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:28,471
(GRUNTING)

365
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,407
(YELLS)

366
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:37,547
(BOTH YELLING IN CANTONESE)

367
00:32:58,001 --> 00:33:00,002
Did the fates give you those cards?

368
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:03,272
You threw that hand.

369
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,576
It's easy when you're losing
other people's money, isn't it?

370
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:18,287
(GRUNTING)

371
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:22,914
_

372
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:30,865
(GRUNTING)

373
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:37,371
(GRUNTING)

374
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:49,850
Do you think it's by luck

375
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,819
that I sit here now?

376
00:34:03,198 --> 00:34:04,731
Leave it alone, Bohannon!

377
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:11,171
Back up!

378
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:11,462
(CHUCKLES) You know, the
first time I saw a Chinaman

379
00:35:11,496 --> 00:35:13,497
was in a sideshow tent.

380
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:16,534
Mr. P.T. Barnum had a whole family of them.

381
00:35:16,568 --> 00:35:18,735
Reading, writing,

382
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:21,104
eating with their choppy sticks,

383
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:25,022
dressed in the finest silk.
I felt like Marco Polo.

384
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:29,408
They have an ancient
civilization, Mr. Bohannon.

385
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:34,810
They're mysterious and wise, industrious.

386
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:37,212
Beautiful in their way.

387
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:40,282
Oh, you can hire them, admire them,

388
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:44,419
eat their food, lay with their women.

389
00:35:46,722 --> 00:35:48,523
It's easy to get distracted.

390
00:35:49,124 --> 00:35:50,325
Hmm.

391
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:55,229
Chang's gonna be a problem
for this railroad.

392
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:57,965
The Union Pacific is
halfway across Wyoming.

393
00:35:58,301 --> 00:36:01,002
Thomas Durant is gobbling
up five miles per day.

394
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,604
With it, government bonds, mineral rights.

395
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:05,406
At the rate we're going,

396
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,742
we'll have ceded the Weber Canyon
coal fields team before year's end.

397
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,083
Durant is winning the race, Mr. Bohannon.

398
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:20,187
That is a problem for this railroad.

399
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:23,524
Durant's resourceful but reckless.

400
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:26,460
He'll bring the entire U.P.
enterprise down on his head

401
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:27,861
without somebody there to stop him.

402
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:29,763
Without you?

403
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:34,901
Do I have your loyalty?

404
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:47,013
Do I have your loyalty, sir?

405
00:36:55,322 --> 00:36:56,622
I'm here, ain't I?

406
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:00,192
(SIGHS) Good.

407
00:37:03,497 --> 00:37:04,630
Mr. Bohannon.

408
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,001
No more distractions.

409
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:42,867
Fong.

410
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:46,670
- Tao?
- Sick list.

411
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:54,747
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

412
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:16,871
(GRUNTS) Samuel.

413
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:21,238
- Lock up if you leave.
- Sir.

414
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:12,754
(SIGHS)

415
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:15,691
Damn turncoat.

416
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,124
(SIGHS) Never trust a rebel.

417
00:39:39,381 --> 00:39:41,181
Your favorite brand.

418
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,525
Don't get you out of the fare.

419
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,959
(CHUCKLES)

420
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:03,504
Yah!

421
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:13,379
(SIGHS)

422
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:18,752
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

423
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:21,154
(SIGHS)

424
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:24,390
Ain't you get enough of
my money last night, Jim?

425
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,760
I swear.

426
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:29,595
Mr. Bohannon.

427
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:32,998
It is a pleasure to see you again.

428
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:37,636
Yeah. Heard you slipped the noose.

429
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:40,073
Uh, I arrived in camp

430
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:43,576
with the rest of the Mormon
workers while you was surveying.

431
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,813
When Mr. Huntington told me you
had joined the Central Pacific,

432
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:49,481
(CHUCKLES)

433
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:51,684
I prayed for your safe return.

434
00:40:53,653 --> 00:40:56,221
(STUTTERS) I would like to thank you.

435
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:58,390
I'd like you to step back from my door.

436
00:41:00,226 --> 00:41:02,594
Yeah, I have stepped back, yeah.

437
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:07,566
I would like to thank you
for revealing the truth.

438
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:11,703
I am not Bishop Dutson.

439
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:14,206
I was never Bishop Dutson. (CHUCKLES)

440
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,111
Didn't bother Brigham Young none, I guess.

441
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:24,248
The blasphemer who sits in Salt
Lake City is a false prophet.

442
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:27,619
Heavenly Father has shown me, through you,

443
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,488
that I am the one true prophet.

444
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,456
Prophet?

445
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,094
You got any followers 'sides
that tick-bit mongrel?

446
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,733
I will reveal you, Mr. Bohannon,

447
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,335
as you have revealed me.

448
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:47,571
For if I was never Bishop Dutson,

449
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:53,309
you have never been reformed
husband and father.

450
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,246
No, you are the devil.

451
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,883
Sent by divine providence to test me,

452
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,787
to forge me into the lion I must become.

453
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:09,992
Oh, I look forward to
this next test, devil.

454
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,801
Now you think I'm the devil.

455
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:22,238
(SCOFFS) That's fine.

456
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,474
Probably take a devil to finish this road.

457
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,476
Mmm-hmm.

458
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:32,247
And you can call yourself whatever you
like, long as you brought a shovel.

459
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,685
Because this ain't the Mormon
fort, you Swedish son of a bitch.

460
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,086
You work for me.

461
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,523
I got a race to win.
