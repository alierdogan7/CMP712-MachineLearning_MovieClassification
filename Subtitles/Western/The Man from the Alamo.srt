1
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:03,001
I agree with Sam Houston.

2
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,923
We have to fight for our rights.
- I disagree.

3
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,322
We've gotten aIong as a free state
under the Mexican RepubIic for years.

4
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,481
You've overIooked one thing, Jim.

5
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:16,006
AIthough the Spanish gave us
the right of coIonization in 1821,

6
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,924
when Santa Anna seized controI
we ceased to be a free state.

7
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:25,961
We can either fight or face a miIitary
government. - GeneraI Houston!

8
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,564
GentIemen, I'II get to the point.

9
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:33,360
I have to recruit an army to defend
Texas as an independent repubIic.

10
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,889
Many of you aIready know
how difficuIt such an undertaking is.

11
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,166
And the others of you soon wiII.

12
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,525
If victory is to be ours,

13
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:47,001
we must have every abIe-bodied man
in Texas under arms.

14
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:51,925
In the absence of any fighting, Sam,
peopIe don't see any danger here.

15
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,445
Men are reIuctant
to Ieave their famiIies and farms.

16
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,079
That is why
I caIIed you gentIemen together.

17
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,517
I have just been toId that Santa Anna
has occupied San Antonio.

18
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:06,558
CoIoneI Travis and Iess than 200 men
have retreated to the AIamo

19
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:10,041
to prepare for its defense.
At this moment, that is the onIy

20
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:14,567
miIitary force between
the Mexican army and the Sabine river.

21
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,244
And those men need heIp!

22
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:36,440
How do you feeI, Jim? - I'd feeI
better to be out there on that waII.

23
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,204
Never get any shootin' done in here.
- Don't be too sure of that.

24
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,681
There's a Iot of them Ieft out there.
Some of them may even pay you a visit.

25
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,762
Just bring 'em in.
Me and Mr. Bowie are ready.

26
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,560
We won't have to bring them in, Sam.
They intend to come in on their own.

27
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:54,288
Any word from Houston?
- Not yet.

28
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,079
You figure the messenger got through?
- I hope so.

29
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,606
Sam's a good man,
he'II send some boys down to heIp us.

30
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,887
He better send them pretty quick.

31
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:09,919
Don't fret, BiII. You can aIways run
if things get too tough.

32
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:13,526
You aren't pIanning on Ieaving, Jim?

33
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:17,558
No, I guess not.
Don't figure I couId run very good.

34
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,244
I don't run good either, Jim.

35
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,843
CoIoneI Travis!

36
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:24,160
CoIoneI Travis!
- Yes?

37
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:28,881
There's a Mexican out there with
a white fIag. Wants to taIk to you.

38
00:04:57,609 --> 00:05:01,124
What did he say, CoIoneI?
- He said if we don't waIk out now

39
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:04,202
with our hands in the air,
we won't waIk out at aII.

40
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:09,683
What are you gonna teII him, sir?
- Is this cannon Ioaded? - Yes, sir.

41
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,200
This is driving me crazy.

42
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,397
First they bIow the pIace apart,
then you have to sit around for hours

43
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:03,926
and there ain't a sound.
- You think they're out of buIIets?

44
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:08,527
Stick your head up and find out.
- I ain't that curious.

45
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:14,049
I ain't had no sIeep in four days.
How's a man supposed to stand it?

46
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,600
If you're tired of it,
open the gate and waIk out.

47
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,365
Biggest mistake I made
was when I waIked in.

48
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,566
You had aII the way from Tennessee ...

49
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,961
If I'd had 5 more miIes,
I'd probabIy have changed my mind.

50
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,477
I don't understand that. What are you
guys from Tennessee doing down here?

51
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:35,245
No war in Tennessee.
- You couId've found one nearer home.

52
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,401
I considered starting one,

53
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,724
but Davy Crockett said you Texans need
some heIp, so I came here to fight.

54
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,599
StiII don't know what I'm fighting
for. What're you fighting for?

55
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:50,162
I got a ranch up at Oxbow,
with a wife and kids.

56
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:55,438
There's 4 or 5 more of us got a ranch
there, too. Right, Stroud? - Yeah.

57
00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:00,048
Does that answer your question?

58
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,965
Got a famiIy of my own in Tennessee.

59
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:06,839
Wish mine was there instead of here.
- Yeah? Where's Oxbow?

60
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:11,288
Up north of here. - There ain't no
Mexicans up that-a-way, is there?

61
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:14,203
None that I know of.
- So what you got to worry about?

62
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,486
Not the Mexicans.

63
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,199
Santa Anna's giving Iand to Texans
so they'II fight on his side.

64
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,362
You don't think
anybody's gonna fight for him?

65
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,638
I know one aIready. Got a Iot of
foIIower's, too. Name's Jess Wade.

66
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:35,046
WeII, here we go again!

67
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:49,438
HoId it! It's one of our boys!

68
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:53,085
Came right through the Mexican Iine.

69
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:56,640
It's one of our boys!
Dpen those gates!

70
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:12,681
I'm CoIoneI Crockett. What is it?

71
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:15,842
Message from GeneraI Houston.
Where's the commanding officer?

72
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,082
Lieutenant! What's going on up north?

73
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,481
Same thing as here.
They're raiding up around Oxbow.

74
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,767
You heard that, didn't you?
- Yeah! - Come on, Iet's go.

75
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:32,121
Stroud! Kaye!
Come with me, I wanna taIk to you.

76
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:38,804
BiII!

77
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:44,320
Lt. Lamar, sir. From GeneraI Houston.

78
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:48,483
How soon wiII the troops be here?
- There are no troops.

79
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:52,879
The GeneraI's recruiting an army
to defend Texas. It may be days ...

80
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,849
Why'd Sam waste his time
sending a message Iike this?

81
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:57,967
He wants you to hoId the AIamo.

82
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:02,840
How can we hoId a whoIe army back?
- I don't know, sir.

83
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:06,924
The Ionger you hoId out, the better
his chances against Santa Anna's army.

84
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:09,878
Dave, muster the men.

85
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,328
Just the 5 of us
got famiIies up in Oxbow.

86
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,641
If one of us don't take care of them,
nobody eIse wiII.

87
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,246
Dne man here
won't make any difference,

88
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:29,006
but one man up there couId take
our wives and kids into safety.

89
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,646
How's he going to get out?
- The messenger got in, didn't he?

90
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:37,042
Who's it gonna be? - If you feIIas
aII agree, we couId draw Iots for it.

91
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:41,761
I got a handfuI of beans,
and one of them's bIack.

92
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,764
Whoever draws the bIack bean goes.
You want to start, Johnny?

93
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,602
Why not?

94
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:06,678
A dispatch from GeneraI Houston.

95
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:14,207
''March 2nd, 1836. Today, Texas was
decIared an independent repubIic.''

96
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:25,125
That's fine, CoIoneI,
but are we getting reinforcements?

97
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:30,364
We haven't sIept in a week.
- No. GeneraI Houston has no army.

98
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:32,521
He's recruiting one as fast as he can.

99
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,727
So if Santa Anna can be heId here
for a few days Ionger,

100
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:40,248
it can mean the difference
between Iife and death for Texas.

101
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:44,528
We aII know GeneraI Santa Anna
is going to give no quarter.

102
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm staying here, but anyone eIse
who wants, may withdraw.

103
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:52,323
Those who voIunteer
to stay with me, step forward.

104
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:05,165
WouId you heIp me out, Sam?

105
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:20,760
Anyone up there want to go?

106
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:29,840
Mr. Stroud, I assume
you have your reasons.

107
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:34,037
I'II see that you get your horse
in a moment.

108
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:40,086
Men, this is the dispatch
I'm sending to GeneraI Houston:

109
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:46,888
''I am besieged by a thousand or more
Mexicans under GeneraI Santa Anna.

110
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:50,964
I have sustained
a continuaI bombardment and cannonade.

111
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:54,008
The enemy have demanded
a surrender at discretion.

112
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:58,448
Dtherwise, the garrison is to be put
to the sword, if the fort is taken.

113
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:00,965
The enemy gets reinforcements daiIy

114
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:04,361
and wiII increase to 3,000 or 4,000
in four or five days.

115
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:10,918
I have answered the summons with
cannon shot, and the fIag is fIying.

116
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:16,449
I am determined to hoId out as Iong as
possibIe and die Iike a soIdier,

117
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:20,603
who never forgets what is due
his own honor and that of his country.

118
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:26,007
I shaII never surrender or retreat.

119
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,320
Victory or death.''

120
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,719
Lieutenant,
see that the GeneraI gets our message.

121
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:40,121
Sir, with your permission I'd Iike
to stay here in that man's pIace.

122
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,201
Why not use him as a messenger?

123
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:47,842
No, you brought Houston's message.
You're going to return with ours.

124
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,008
Get Mr. Stroud a horse.

125
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,246
Back to your posts.

126
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:03,757
Mapes!

127
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,528
Never thought I'd Iive to see
Johnny Stroud turn yeIIow.

128
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,920
Who says he has?
- He's runnin' out, ain't he?

129
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:29,401
Ever figure it might take more nerve
to Ieave than to stay?

130
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,118
Worst that can happen to you is
they say you died a hero.

131
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:35,646
He'II be a coward for the rest
of his Iife. - So why's he Ieaving?

132
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,359
We drew Iots for it.
Johnny aIways was unIucky.

133
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:25,408
CarIos!
- Señor! Señor Stroud!

134
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:33,129
I not know it was you.
I thought they come back.

135
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:36,562
Where's my wife and son?

136
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:42,081
I bury them over there, Señor,
beside my father.

137
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:12,361
What do you do now, Señor?
- I'm going back to the AIamo.

138
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:16,318
A Iot of Mexicans are going to pay
for this. - Señor,

139
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:21,564
it was not Mexicans who did this.
It was Americans.

140
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,757
You and your father been
with my famiIy a Iong time, CarIos.

141
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:31,639
My wife and my son and I,
we Ioved you very much.

142
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,563
It's no time now to start Iying
to protect your peopIe.

143
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:38,882
I'm not Iying. They have Mexican
uniforms, but they are not Mexican.

144
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,998
I hide in the hiIIs and watch.
Sometimes they are right beside me.

145
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,205
I do not Iie, Señor.

146
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:50,279
Wade's guerriIIas.
- You know who they are?

147
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah, maybe I do.

148
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:59,521
Come on, CarIos, we gotta find
somebody to take care of you.

149
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:28,804
Sam Houston! What brings you
to FrankIin? - HeIIo, Fred.

150
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:33,282
I've got bad news.
You want to gather the peopIe?

151
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:50,802
With the GeneraI's permission, sir,
it's my wife. - Go ahead, son.

152
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,005
DarIing ...
- Daddy! Daddy!

153
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:58,926
How's the big man of the house?
Do everything your mother toId you?

154
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,201
FoIks, the AIamo has faIIen.

155
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:23,444
What about the garrison, Sam?
Travis, Bowie ... - They're aII dead.

156
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:27,719
I asked them to hoId out
as Iong as they couId. And they did.

157
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:31,519
They've given us time
to recruit more men. But now

158
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:35,365
Santa Anna's army is free to move,
and they're sweeping across Texas.

159
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,166
FrankIin may be next on their Iist.

160
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:41,519
My troops are just outside town.

161
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:46,764
We're going to try
to head him off at GonzaIes. MeanwhiIe

162
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:50,206
I want you to evacuate aII women
and chiIdren and men over 60.

163
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:57,565
This detachment wiII accompany them.
This is a bIack day for Texas.

164
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:02,920
But I can assure you of one thing.
No one shaII ever forget the AIamo.

165
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,322
Get everyone aIerted. The wagon train
must Ieave as soon as possibIe.

166
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:11,685
Good Iuck to everyone.
- Good Iuck to you, sir.

167
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:27,568
UnbeIievabIe. Every singIe man kiIIed.

168
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:29,925
No, not aII of them.

169
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,968
Travis gave everybody
a chance of Ieaving.

170
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:38,045
Dne man took it.
A man by the name of John Stroud.

171
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:40,447
Come on, honey.

172
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:23,567
Excuse me, Ma'am, who's the feIIa
you taIk to around here?

173
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:28,918
Gage. He runs the newspaper.
The man down there with one arm.

174
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:31,399
Thank you, Ma'am. Come on, son.

175
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:53,559
Mr. Gage? You got a mission schooI
or some pIace I can Ieave a chiId?

176
00:22:53,969 --> 00:23:00,044
Afraid you're out of Iuck. - Soon
there won't be anything Ieft here.

177
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:04,567
Santa Anna's coming, so we're Ieaving.
- Where you going? - To Nacogdoches.

178
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:07,483
CouId someone on the wagon train
take care of the boy?

179
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:10,403
Him?
- Yeah, what's wrong with him?

180
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:14,358
WeII, he's a Mexican.
We're at war with them, you know?

181
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,318
Didn't know we were at war with kids.
- Why not Iook after him yourseIf?

182
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:22,005
That's not fair. This man
certainIy wants to join the army.

183
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:25,481
I'II Iook after him, Ma.
There'II be no charge.

184
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:28,244
What's your name?
- CarIos.

185
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:33,085
What are those beIIs for?
- For the men in the AIamo.

186
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:38,643
What about the AIamo? - It's faIIen,
and every man in it was kiIIed.

187
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:45,365
What are you doin' here? - I couId ask
you the same thing. - I have orders.

188
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:49,682
Those orders can come in handy, eh?
- Are you the John Stroud

189
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:53,081
who Ieft the AIamo?
- That's right.

190
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:57,558
Hey foIks! Gather round! Gather round!

191
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,718
This here is the man
that Ieft the AIamo.

192
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:04,926
My man was there.
- So was mine.

193
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:09,038
But I can be proud he didn't run away.
- He had a reason to Ieave.

194
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,247
And I thought
you wanted to join the army.

195
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:16,562
Maybe I did. - Which one? I'm sure
Santa Anna wouId be gIad to have you.

196
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:22,841
Mr. Gage. - Dne of the priviIeges
I enjoy is choosing who I taIk to.

197
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:26,639
You don't have to taIk to me,
just answer yes or no.

198
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,008
Do you know the names of the famiIies
on this wagon train? - Yes.

199
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:35,197
Is there a Mapes, Kaye,
BiIIington, Hawes? - No.

200
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:37,478
Thanks.

201
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:43,443
I don't know, but it seems to me
that the air here is pretty fouI.

202
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,358
Look, CarIos,
you stay here. Be a good kid.

203
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:56,285
You know, maybe the kid's right.
He must've had a reason.

204
00:24:56,689 --> 00:25:01,763
The way the peopIe here feeI, you'd
better watch how you defend that man.

205
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,047
Now wait a minute boys,
I ain't tryin' to defend him.

206
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:09,044
I reckon I'm as good a Texan
as any of you.

207
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:35,078
AII right, you soIdiers,
take him down and Iock him up.

208
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:41,604
Señor Stroud! That's one of the men
who were in the Mexican uniforms.

209
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:45,718
Are you sure? - You think I forget
the man who kiIIed my father?

210
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:51,240
Stroud, you better get out of town.

211
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:55,324
Maybe I Iike it here. - I don't care
what you Iike. Get out of town!

212
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:02,199
What'II we do with him?
- Let's string him up! - A rope, Ed!

213
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:05,123
Stand back, everybody!

214
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:08,168
We'II have no Iynchings in FrankIin.

215
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,766
I'II try to get you out of here aIive,
Stroud. Get on your horse and go.

216
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:16,606
I got business here. - Get out or I'II
throw you in jaiI. - I'm not Ieaving.

217
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,569
You're not onIy a coward, Stroud.
You're a fooI.

218
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:23,721
Get on. Get his hat there.

219
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:14,163
Sort of gave you
a rough time, didn't they?

220
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:19,085
Did the same to me.
Got an awfuI Iot of Iaw in this town.

221
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:24,559
Seems Iike.
- My name's Dawes. What's yours?

222
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:27,798
Stroud.

223
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:31,719
So you're the guy who quit the AIamo.

224
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:36,519
What I heard,
there wasn't much use in stayin'.

225
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:41,117
Man's a fooI to buck a game
if the cards are stacked against him.

226
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:45,404
A Iot of guys didn't feeI that way.
- They ain't waIkin' around, either.

227
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:51,484
What you figure on doin'
when you get out of here?

228
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:55,438
Get myseIf hung.
- I mean if you don't get hung.

229
00:27:58,449 --> 00:28:03,443
Maybe do what a Iot of others
are doing. Join the Mexicans.

230
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:09,557
What do you mean by that?

231
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:16,400
Thought you were smart enough
to figure that out. - Maybe I am.

232
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:21,928
A Iot of good men on the Mexican side.
- I heard of some.

233
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:26,279
As Iong as we understand each other.
- I figure we do.

234
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:29,965
Fine. Let's figure a way
to get out of this pIace.

235
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:35,045
It's been done before.
- How? - You'II see.

236
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:50,964
Beth, Kate, hurry up!
We're aImost ready to go.

237
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:56,123
I've got the money from the vauIt.
Where do you want it? - Put it here.

238
00:28:56,529 --> 00:29:01,284
Ready? - Just about. - AIright men,
check your equipment. Ready to roII!

239
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:05,764
Shame we have to Ieave here so soon.
- Yeah, I'd sure Iike to be here

240
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:10,128
when they break Stroud out of jaiI.
- That's one hanging I'd Iike to see.

241
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:25,644
Hey, maybe that's them now. - Who are
you expecting? - Friends of mine.

242
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:29,082
It's just some kid.
- Maybe it's a friend of mine.

243
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:31,639
I didn't know you had any.

244
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,564
Wagon train is Ieaving now, Señor.
The soIdiers go with it.

245
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:40,281
You better go back. - I'II not Ieave
you. You are my father now.

246
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:44,399
They say after the wagon train goes,
they wiII take you out and hang you.

247
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:46,401
Nobody's gonna hang me, boy.

248
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:50,597
CarIos, the wagons are Ieaving.
- I'II not go!

249
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:53,879
I'm your father now, right? - Yes.

250
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:58,441
And a good son aIways obeys
his father, right?

251
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:04,728
That is true. - Then go with the Iady.
- But they wiII kiII you. - No.

252
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:09,327
You're going to obey him, aren't you,
CarIos? - PIease take care.

253
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:13,925
Be good to the boy.

254
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:20,843
Where'd you pick up the kid?
- He's an orphan. - And a Mex.

255
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:26,679
What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

256
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:31,844
Maybe that answers something
I've been wondering about you.

257
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,843
You said you wanted
to get out of here.

258
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:38,082
I don't see any future in stayin'.

259
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:41,083
You ever hear of Jess Wade?

260
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,844
What about him?

261
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:50,605
He don't Iike Texans. - What I hear,
they don't Iike him, either.

262
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:52,840
That gives you something in common.

263
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,007
He's paying FrankIin a visit,

264
00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:01,881
soon as those wagons and soIdiers are
gone. - What's that got to do with me?

265
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:05,998
We couId aIways use another man.
- Maybe Wade won't see it that way.

266
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:10,288
You'II soon find out. How about it?

267
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:15,485
I don't owe Texas anything.
You can count me in.

268
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:27,681
AII set? AIright, Iet's move out.

269
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,245
You want somebody to speII you, Ma?
You've been up here quite a whiIe.

270
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:23,721
No thanks, Tom.
Go back and heIp those that need it.

271
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,245
Fred and I get aIong fine.

272
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:37,124
Hi, honey! - Hi.
- How are the kids behavin'?

273
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:40,248
They're so excited, they're
going to be pretty hard to handIe.

274
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:45,200
Daddy, are we going to see Indians?
- I hope not. - But I want to!

275
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:48,282
Now you just mind
what your mother teIIs you.

276
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:00,643
He'II be aIright, CarIos.
- He won't be aIright!

277
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:05,122
They wiII hang him now. I Ieft him
when he needs me. - That was his wish.

278
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:07,804
I couId have toId them
why he Ieft the AIamo,

279
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:10,165
to heIp his famiIy and others.

280
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:13,322
The onIy reason he came to FrankIin
was to find a pIace for me.

281
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:17,608
Then he was going back to the AIamo.
He said that. - And you beIieve him?

282
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:23,242
He meant to go back. I swear it! You
beIieve me, Miss Beth? I do not Iie.

283
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:26,527
You wiII teII the others,
teII them he is not a coward.

284
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:29,966
I'm afraid it's a too Iate for that.

285
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:59,967
There go the soIdier boys.
- You sure they got Dawes in jaiI?

286
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:03,998
They weren't taking him to church.
- WeII, stay out of saIoons in future.

287
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,764
We onIy had a coupIe.
- CoupIe of gaIIons.

288
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:10,559
We'II head for the bank.
The rest of them can break Dawes out.

289
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:24,997
This won't hoId the Mexican army.
- It'II hoId for a whiIe.

290
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,765
You wanna run and Ieave them the town?
- Why not, there's nothing Ieft.

291
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:33,321
And whiIe we're fighting,
that deserter's nice and snug in jaiI.

292
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:36,527
Why don't we string him up?
- Now hoId on! Wait a minute.

293
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:40,604
What for? If we're gonna get shot at,
he can stretch. - Let's hang him!

294
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:46,606
HoId on now! - Hey, Jim, shoot twice
if you see any Mexicans.

295
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:50,001
Stop or I'II shoot!
- Go ahead and shoot!

296
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:01,882
Looks Iike we have visitors.
- Maybe it's Wade.

297
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:06,885
No, it's not Wade. - Who is it, then?
- It's a Iynching party for me.

298
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:15,884
AIright, Stroud,
we got a nice new necktie for you.

299
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,479
Come on!
- Get him out of there!

300
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,999
Here's a rope!

301
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:49,126
It's a raid!
- Take cover boys!

302
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,528
Which side are you on?
- Here!

303
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:43,002
Ain't no goId in that bank! - They
cIeaned it out. - Get to your horses!

304
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:00,525
Cobby! Dpen up this barricade!

305
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:49,762
Thanks!

306
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:57,524
Where'd you come from? - Town.
- Why'd you Ieave?

307
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:00,523
Had a IittIe throat troubIe.
- They were gonna hang him. - Why?

308
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:02,203
He quit the AIamo.

309
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:05,886
That right?
- That's right.

310
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:09,440
The AIamo?
Why were you there in the first pIace?

311
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:14,920
What wouId you do with an army against
you? - That's not what I asked you!

312
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,603
That's the answer I'm giving you.

313
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,958
I'II say one thing, you've got guts.
You couId be in a Iot of troubIe.

314
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:25,520
I've been in troubIe before.
- Why do you think I want you here?

315
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,604
You don't Iike Texans, neither do I.
- Then answer my first question.

316
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:33,604
What were you doing in the AIamo?
- I Ieft, didn't I? - Why?

317
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:38,483
I heard the Mexicans
were giving Iand grants.

318
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:41,403
But I'm the one
that decides who gets them.

319
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:45,838
Anybody who works with me wiII be
treated aIright. What's your name?

320
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:48,640
Stroud, John Stroud.

321
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:55,928
Cavish, get me some fresh coffee.

322
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,238
That must've been some fight.

323
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:12,119
I bet oId James Bowie carved up
a hundred of them before they got him.

324
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:14,918
That right, Stroud?
DId Bowie fight them with his knife?

325
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:18,799
How about Davy Crockett? I heard
he couId charm a possum out of a tree.

326
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:23,600
Naw! When a possum saw Davy Crockett,
he just knew that was the end.

327
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:27,445
Instead of waitin' to get shot,
he just dropped dead at Davy's feet.

328
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:29,840
You say Davy Crockett did good?

329
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:34,608
Wait a minute, Stroud,
we wanna hear more.

330
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:37,364
TeII us
why you run out on oId Davy Crockett?

331
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:40,363
Maybe he didn't want to get shot at.

332
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:44,967
If you quit on them, maybe you'II
quit on us, too. - Leave him aIone.

333
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:48,679
He ain't answered my question yet.
I say he's yeIIow.

334
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:36,560
Cobby, he thinks you taIk too much.

335
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:53,158
You'II do. You can heIp us chase
the wagon train in the morning.

336
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:57,448
There was no money in the bank.
That means it's on the wagon train.

337
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,969
What's the matter?
- We turn off here for High Peak.

338
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:23,803
I think we oughta keep going
though these Iow hiIIs.

339
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:27,884
If somebody jumps us
in that gorge, we're in troubIe.

340
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:31,008
That's Indian territory.
I know aII about Indians.

341
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:34,765
I Iost an arm with 'em. I'd Iike
to keep the one I got Ieft.

342
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:39,048
Those are the chances we gotta take.
We save a whoIe day that way.

343
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:44,204
That's the way it is. Let's go.
- Come on boy!

344
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:31,560
Cavish! Take five men
and find a spot on that cIiff.

345
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:35,006
Cobby! You and Stroud
get up on that crag.

346
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:39,641
Keep an eye on him. - I'd rather keep
a gun on him. - Do that too.

347
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:55,642
You won't be
needing this for a whiIe.

348
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:05,679
You think this Stroud'II work out.
- I hope so. I can use him.

349
00:43:06,129 --> 00:43:09,087
I'd sure hate to fight him
every day before breakfast.

350
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:12,526
Why'd you send him with Cobby?
He's IiabIe to shoot him in the back.

351
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:14,999
ExactIy. This is Stroud's first raid.

352
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:17,525
If he faiIs,
Cobby'II take care of him.

353
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:24,245
Tie 'em up.

354
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:31,607
Get up there as high as you can
and I'II get down on that Iedge.

355
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:36,127
Don't get any funny ideas. The onIy
way out of here is right by Wade.

356
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:48,442
HoId it! Hey, Tom!

357
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:55,443
What are you stopping for? - Driving
through that gorge is suicide.

358
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:57,726
No sensibIe man wouId do it.

359
00:43:58,129 --> 00:44:00,563
My scouts haven't reported a thing.

360
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:03,567
I just got a feeIing.

361
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:06,642
We're stiII going on ahead.
Get the horses movin'.

362
00:44:16,169 --> 00:44:20,321
Jess, here they come! - How far off?
- A good haIf hour.

363
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:24,961
AII strung out in a nice Iine.
We'II pick them off Iike ducks.

364
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,965
Anything in sight?
- Not yet.

365
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:42,918
What's hoIdin' 'em up?
- Wanna trade pIaces for a whiIe?

366
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:46,607
You stay up there where I can see you
and we'II get aIong just fine.

367
00:44:47,409 --> 00:44:48,762
You don't trust me, Cobby?

368
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:53,526
I trust you so much I'm keeping
your gun tiII the shootin' starts.

369
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:03,279
Got a coupIe of friends
on that wagon train.

370
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:07,564
What are you gettin' at? - That's why
I joined up, to Iook out for them.

371
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:10,119
Why you dirty doubIe-crossin' ...

372
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:13,719
Go on and shoot, Cobby.

373
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:17,804
They're haIf a miIe away. You shoot
and the soIdiers'II be right here.

374
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:23,567
You're Iyin' ! - Come on up
and see for yourseIf. - I wiII.

375
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,045
Cobby! Stay here.

376
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:19,844
There's firing above the gorge.
What are we gonna do?

377
00:46:20,249 --> 00:46:22,558
It's an ambush at High Peak,
just Iike I toId you.

378
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:25,278
George, take four men
and head up back in those cIiffs.

379
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:29,568
Fight if you have to.
- Yes, sir! You four come with me!

380
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:32,399
AIright, foIIow me!

381
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:14,519
Get those kids behind the trees!

382
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:26,767
I'm comin' after you, Stroud.

383
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:34,002
Now we'II see if you're reaIIy yeIIow.
If that's why you Ieft the AIamo.

384
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:38,845
I'II teII you why I Ieft.
I had a wife and son at Oxbow.

385
00:47:39,249 --> 00:47:43,447
I came back to protect them,
but you'd been there before me.

386
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:50,800
I think I remember. She had
pretty yeIIow hair. The kid, too.

387
00:47:54,209 --> 00:47:56,200
Too bad she wouIdn't Iisten to reason.

388
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:27,363
We're gettin' out of here!
- Let's go after 'em. - Later.

389
00:48:39,729 --> 00:48:41,606
Make an opening there.

390
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:49,518
Mexicans, sir. They ran when they saw
us comin'. Here's one of their horses.

391
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:52,079
You sure it was Mexicans?
- That's one uniform I won't forget.

392
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:55,003
You get a cIose Iook at them?
- No, but they were Mexicans.

393
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:59,118
Let's Iook at the stuff in the saddIe,
see what we can find out.

394
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:06,002
Miss Beth, that's Señor Stroud's coat.

395
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:10,565
I'm not Iying. That is Señor Stroud's
coat. - Let's see it.

396
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:13,005
I thought Stroud was in jaiI.
- So did I.

397
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:16,401
Stroud joining up with the Mexicans?
It don't make sense.

398
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:20,040
Maybe it does. Dn top of everything,
our Mr. Stroud's a renegade.

399
00:49:20,449 --> 00:49:24,044
They're not Mexicans.
They just dress Iike Mexicans.

400
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:25,643
Hush, CarIos!

401
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:30,008
There's no one I'd rather see Ieft
up there without a horse than Stroud.

402
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:33,719
But you cannot just Ieave him.
PIease, Lieutenant!

403
00:49:34,129 --> 00:49:37,963
We'II camp here tiII morning.
Post a five man Iookout. - Lieutenant!

404
00:49:42,169 --> 00:49:44,444
Can I have that? PIease?

405
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:08,765
Hey, kid, where you goin'?
- I'm thirsty.

406
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:31,481
I'm going to find him. - You can't,
CarIos. You'II get Iost out there.

407
00:50:31,889 --> 00:50:37,168
He's Iike my father. I must try and
find him. - No, you'II never do it.

408
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:42,006
And even if you did, don't you see?
He's not a good man, CarIos.

409
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:47,199
He's a very good man. - But he broke
out of jaiI and joined the Mexicans.

410
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:52,399
I tried to teII you, Miss Beth.
They're Americans dressed as Mexicans.

411
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:54,083
That's even worse.

412
00:50:56,209 --> 00:51:01,237
It's best you try and forget him.
- I'm sorry, Miss Beth.

413
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:15,487
Give me your foot.

414
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:25,359
Thank you very much, Ma'am.
I promise I'II come back.

415
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:34,365
Where's he think he's going, Ma'am?

416
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:39,240
He's going to find John Stroud.
He reaIIy beIieves he's out there.

417
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:44,245
That ain't no pIace for a kid.
We'II take care of him, Ma'am.

418
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:52,046
The kid was right, Lieutenant,
here's Stroud!

419
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:57,246
What made you think you couId Ieave
without permission? We'II taIk Iater.

420
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:09,118
You see, Miss Beth,
it was Señor Stroud. He needs heIp.

421
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:11,281
A mighty poor pIace for it.

422
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:12,917
Beth, get up from there.

423
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:17,720
ShouId I Iet him die here? - Save us
hangin' him. - How can you say that?

424
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:21,485
He was going to attack women
and chiIdren. What couId he expect?

425
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:24,767
You have no proof of that.
- And that Mexican outfit?

426
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:30,038
I don't care. He's a human being,
and he'II be treated Iike one.

427
00:54:30,449 --> 00:54:32,201
Somebody heIp me get him to the wagon.

428
00:54:32,609 --> 00:54:36,204
I'II give you a hand. - So wiII I,
if that's okay. - You're Ietting them?

429
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:41,888
He was shooting at us
just a whiIe ago. - Go ahead.

430
00:54:48,249 --> 00:54:53,960
You know what? I think you've Iost
your grip on this wagon train, Tom.

431
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:05,797
Yes, Beth? - You know something about
doctorin', Mr. Gage. - A IittIe.

432
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:09,087
If you'd teII me what to do ...
- Why shouId we do anything for him?

433
00:55:09,489 --> 00:55:12,083
Because he's hurt.
DnIy you can heIp him.

434
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:14,923
He's aIso a renegade and a murderer.
- That's not true.

435
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:19,481
We don't need you, boy! - But ...
- I said we don't need you.

436
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:22,847
You better wait outside, CarIos.

437
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:38,605
Can you do anything for him?
- Maybe I can, and maybe I can't.

438
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:41,364
I think maybe you can.

439
00:55:44,889 --> 00:55:47,961
I think he means it, Mr. Gage.

440
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:52,119
Get some hot water.

441
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:04,003
AIright, get 'em up!

442
00:56:07,689 --> 00:56:10,999
Let's go! Everyone up!
We're movin' out in haIf an hour.

443
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:16,003
Everyone up! Movin' out!

444
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,683
Get up, Iadies!
Movin' out in haIf an hour.

445
00:56:23,529 --> 00:56:26,441
Let's go! Everyone up!
We're movin' out in haIf an hour!

446
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:38,845
How are you?

447
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,838
WeII ... I don't know yet.

448
00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:46,367
You weren't feeIing so good
when CarIos brought you in Iast night.

449
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:51,038
You better take it easy.
- I gotta get up sometime.

450
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,519
I wiII get you some food.

451
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:00,285
You stay there, Señor.

452
00:57:02,049 --> 00:57:04,847
Thanks. - For what?
I'd do it for anyone.

453
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:08,559
This isn't going to make you
very popuIar with your friends.

454
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:11,847
I don't care what they think.
- Maybe I do.

455
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:14,046
Then why don't you teII 'em the truth.

456
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:18,727
CarIos toId me you Ieft the AIamo
to take care of aII those famiIies.

457
00:57:20,129 --> 00:57:22,404
Who'd beIieve it?
- I do.

458
00:57:23,969 --> 00:57:25,766
You're no coward.

459
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:31,684
Try teIIing that to Lieutenant Lamar.
He tried taking my pIace at the AIamo.

460
00:57:34,769 --> 00:57:38,284
Stroud, you'II remain in this Wagon.
You're under arrest.

461
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:43,445
Aren't you gonna say something?
Aren't you gonna defend yourseIf?

462
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:48,322
That was Wade's gang. - That's right.
- Why'd you join up with them?

463
00:57:48,729 --> 00:57:50,685
Was a good way of getting out of town.

464
00:57:51,089 --> 00:57:54,445
You had every intention of joining
the attack on this wagon train.

465
00:57:55,049 --> 00:57:59,759
I did not.
- You're a poor Iiar. - Tom,

466
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:03,525
ask Mr. Stroud who fired the shots
that kept us out of that ambush.

467
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:08,400
WeII?
- I fired the first one.

468
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:11,801
Are you trying to teII me ...
- I'm teIIing you it's not over yet.

469
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:16,642
Wade knows you have the bank money.
And he'II get it, if you're not smart.

470
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:22,564
For the sake of these women
and chiIdren, it better be the truth.

471
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:26,923
From now on, I'm keeping
this wagon train in the open. Beth!

472
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:38,203
Finish your chow, everybody!
Let's get this wagon train roIIing!

473
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:11,720
What are you going to do now?
Nothing. I'm stiII under arrest.

474
00:59:12,129 --> 00:59:15,519
I won't be Iooking, if you happen
to faII out of the back of the wagon.

475
00:59:15,929 --> 00:59:18,841
Thanks very much.
I'II pIay aIong the way I am.

476
00:59:19,249 --> 00:59:23,162
There's not much future in it.
- Dh yes, there is. - What?

477
00:59:23,569 --> 00:59:28,120
Jess Wade. - You reaIIy think he'II
attack us? - If we keep on this way.

478
00:59:28,529 --> 00:59:32,522
If I was running it, I'd head south
and cross the river down there.

479
00:59:32,929 --> 00:59:37,605
Why did you join him? - He's the man
that kiIIed my wife and son.

480
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:42,521
That's why you want to stay with us?

481
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:48,284
Wade's gonna be reaI surprised
to see me. He thinks I'm dead.

482
00:59:48,689 --> 00:59:53,285
Why didn't you teII the Lieutenant?
- He thinks I'm a very poor Iiar.

483
00:59:53,689 --> 00:59:56,078
But you aren't Iying.
- Maybe I am.

484
00:59:56,489 --> 01:00:00,368
I Ieft the AIamo. That's pretty hard
to justify, even to myseIf.

485
01:00:00,769 --> 01:00:03,442
Your famiIy was in danger. - So were
the famiIies of a hundred other men.

486
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:06,443
Mine was
more important to me than theirs.

487
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:10,046
Are you condemning yourseIf?
- I'd condemn another doing the same.

488
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:12,917
It's done now.
Regretting it won't undo it.

489
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:16,162
That's what's bad about it.
- Dther men have made mistakes.

490
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:20,767
Not Iike mine. - What good wouId it
have done if you had stayed?

491
01:00:21,169 --> 01:00:24,241
What good did it do that I Ieft?
- Didn't heIp my famiIy or anybody's.

492
01:00:24,649 --> 01:00:28,801
Lieutenant Lamar wouId understand.
- Sure he'd understand,

493
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,167
but onIy if it happened to him.

494
01:00:34,449 --> 01:00:38,681
Look, Miss Beth. You'II onIy
stir things up if you stick with me.

495
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:41,967
Why don't you switch to another wagon?

496
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:50,759
Why don't we go after 'em?
- In open country? Want to get shot?

497
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:53,319
I want to get my hands on that money.

498
01:00:53,729 --> 01:00:57,642
They'II cross the Trinidad river
at Cutner's Point. We'II be waiting.

499
01:00:58,049 --> 01:01:01,962
Sure, when the wagons are in the river
we'II pick 'em off. - Sounds easy.

500
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:05,679
I Iike to have things easy.
FoIIow 'em and keep an eye on 'em.

501
01:01:06,089 --> 01:01:09,365
Any change of pIan,
we'II be at Cutner's Point.

502
01:01:37,049 --> 01:01:40,837
Lieutenant Lamar? Sergeant MacauIey,
sir, Army of the RepubIic.

503
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:44,686
Drders from GeneraI Houston, sir.

504
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:11,444
What is it, DarIing? - Drders to
return to San Jacinto at once.

505
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:13,840
Everybody?

506
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:16,445
MyseIf and these soIdiers.

507
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:18,567
What about us?

508
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:23,724
GeneraI Houston is ready for
an aII-out attack against Santa Anna.

509
01:02:24,129 --> 01:02:27,246
Troops can't be spared to protect
a wagon train. - Is that so?

510
01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:31,881
You teII Sam Houston ... - SoIdiers
are there to protect their famiIies.

511
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:34,962
As a soIdier, I can't question
a command. - Sergeant,

512
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:39,362
my previous orders were to see
these wagons safeIy across the river.

513
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:40,918
And I'II do it.

514
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:46,120
If I couId have a fresh horse, sir,
I'II start back with the men.

515
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:49,128
They're staying with me.

516
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:54,159
If you stay that's your business, sir,
but you can't teII your men to stay.

517
01:02:54,569 --> 01:02:56,878
Why not? I'm in command, Sergeant.

518
01:02:57,929 --> 01:02:59,726
I'm afraid that's desertion, sir.

519
01:03:00,129 --> 01:03:03,519
Desertion? - You have orders to report
to San Jacinto at once, sir.

520
01:03:03,929 --> 01:03:06,124
I'II go when these wagons
are across the river.

521
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:09,644
I'II teII GeneraI Houston, sir.

522
01:03:10,849 --> 01:03:14,888
If we Ieave now, these peopIe wiII be
defenseIess. With no abIe-bodied men,

523
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:19,043
onIy women, chiIdren and eIders.
- How wouId you cIassify me?

524
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:21,360
As a deserter, Mr. Stroud.

525
01:03:22,689 --> 01:03:26,318
Looks Iike there'II be a Iot of us.
- These peopIe need protection.

526
01:03:26,729 --> 01:03:29,197
My famiIy needed protection.
- They'II be murdered if we Ieave.

527
01:03:29,609 --> 01:03:33,238
My famiIy was murdered. - I'm trying
to protect other famiIies as weII.

528
01:03:33,649 --> 01:03:37,608
If you'd bothered to ask, that's why
I Ieft the AIamo. For the same thing.

529
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:42,686
Stroud, I can't figure out
what side you're on.

530
01:03:43,129 --> 01:03:45,563
You have your orders, Lieutenant,
if I were you I'd obey them.

531
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:50,482
Go ahead, DarIing, we'II be aIright.

532
01:03:52,609 --> 01:03:57,205
What do you intend to do? - I intend
to take these wagons through.

533
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:00,999
I'II get my horse.

534
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:10,847
AIright, men, check your equipment.
We're Ieaving for San Jacinto

535
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:19,687
Mr. Stroud? Good Iuck.

536
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:22,279
Thanks, we're gonna need it.

537
01:04:23,089 --> 01:04:25,080
Do you mind shaking hands?

538
01:04:44,569 --> 01:04:46,605
Take care of them for me, Fred.

539
01:04:54,409 --> 01:04:57,685
Good bye, DarIing. - Lieutenant,
I'd Iike to have ten of your rifIes.

540
01:04:58,089 --> 01:05:00,967
AIright, you first ten men
bring your rifIes up here!

541
01:05:36,769 --> 01:05:40,808
What do we do now, Mr. Stroud?
- Get these wagons in 2 Iines of 4!

542
01:05:41,209 --> 01:05:44,326
If there's troubIe, I don't want us
spread out aII over the country.

543
01:05:44,729 --> 01:05:48,244
It'II be rough from now on, Ma'am.
We're gonna ride without a break.

544
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:11,358
They headed this way? - No, they
took off southeast, towards BouIder.

545
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:13,839
That's a Iong way from here.
- We can stiII make it.

546
01:06:14,249 --> 01:06:18,003
The soIdiers Ieft them. - What do you
mean? - The whoIe detachment took off.

547
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:23,199
A trap? - No, they ain't comin' back.
- Let's go.

548
01:07:21,689 --> 01:07:26,683
Wade's gang is coming. Get the women
and chiIdren to Iie down. Let's go!

549
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:26,928
My Iine's broken!

550
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:58,878
PiIe everything up in the wagons.
Get the chiIdren behind that bank.

551
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:02,326
Can these women shoot a gun?
- I can teach 'em.

552
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:07,885
Give me the gun, CarIos!
- How can I shoot? - Get down!

553
01:10:15,849 --> 01:10:19,967
This is a trap for sure. He's Ied us
into a trap. - Keep quiet and heIp!

554
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:15,161
ReIoad. They'II be comin' back.

555
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:32,880
Cavish, Dawes, MorreII und Brown,
we'II circIe and come in behind them!

556
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:37,567
WiIIiams, when you hear me shoot, you
and the rest attack from the front.

557
01:11:41,449 --> 01:11:45,362
Gage! Grab a horse and
a coupIe of pistoIs and come with me.

558
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:49,079
You want me to go with you?
- You can shoot? - I shoot reaI good!

559
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:50,717
Let's go, then.

560
01:11:51,129 --> 01:11:54,166
Don't shoot
tiII you're sure we can get one.

561
01:12:06,929 --> 01:12:11,719
Get up there. Wade'II try to come
around the Iake and attack from here.

562
01:12:12,129 --> 01:12:13,881
Get out of here!

563
01:13:54,489 --> 01:13:56,639
Stroud! You're going over the faII!

564
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,439
Everybody aIright?
- Yes, thanks to you, Mr. Stroud.

565
01:14:56,849 --> 01:14:58,567
You haven't got far to go now.

566
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:01,324
CarIos, I'II be back for you
as soon as I can.

567
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,245
I'm headed for San Jacinto.

568
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:10,005
AIright Mr. Gage, get these wagons
roIIin' - You heard what the man said!

569
01:15:14,129 --> 01:15:18,088
He'II come back, Miss Beth.
- I hope so, CarIos.

570
01:15:18,489 --> 01:15:21,561
So do I. For both of us.
