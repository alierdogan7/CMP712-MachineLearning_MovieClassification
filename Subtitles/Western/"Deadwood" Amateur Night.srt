1
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:18,287
One-third of six is two. The combination of the safe in the hardware store.

2
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,810
Which you should commit to memory against eventualities.

3
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:24,443
As was threatened by the arrival of those men last night.

4
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:34,914
Yes.There are deeds, some 7% bonds, certificates, sundry receivables, one-third of six is two.

5
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,674
One-three-ought-six-two.

6
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:41,612
Yes.

7
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:45,038
The children and I are moving into the new schoolhouse today.

8
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:46,110
Good.

9
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,381
I'll walk with you.

10
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,969
I wish we'd found out the last part for Mrs. Bullock to tell the children.

11
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,022
We did as best we could.

12
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:06,334
Does four desks to a row seem right?

13
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:11,609
Mm, if not, they ain't nailed to the floor.

14
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,321
You ain't seen Jane?

15
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:21,222
The camp is to know they're here.

16
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:26,145
The camp is to know they're my employees.

17
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:32,230
If this knowledge came first from some disruption of traffic in the thoroughfare, I would have no objection.

18
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:32,900
All right.

19
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:35,719
And matters might deteriorate from there.

20
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:39,921
Coffee!

21
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:40,657
Ready.

22
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:44,428
Well-positioned, Davey.

23
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:46,597
Yes, Sir, Mr. Swearengen.

24
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,865
Eyeing them idlers outside Hearst's hotel.

25
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:54,064
Copperhead cocksucker Hearst,
bringing in the fucking Pinkertons.

26
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:59,438
Not much of a horserace, Dan, between the appetite for blood and fidelity to political conviction.

27
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:00,649
Fucking Pinkertons!

28
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,239
Do we have alternatives to enlisting reinforcements in Cheyenne?

29
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:07,219
I knew I should have stayed packed from four days ago.

30
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,769
Some bullshit's jumping off on the thoroughfare, Mr. Swearengen.

31
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:24,696
Get out of the way, Hop Lee!

32
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:26,933
Hang on.

33
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:28,929
Cocksucker!

34
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:35,869
Cocksucker!

35
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:37,771
Move along, ding-dong!

36
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,647
Go get fucking Wu.

37
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,741
Question extant being—till reinforced, can we learn the ways of church mice?

38
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:53,711
Call on Tolliver.

39
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,599
You will not mistake the newspaperman.

40
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,399
He looks like a…big turtle.

41
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:05,519
Published a letter meant to embarrass me.

42
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:11,774
That I authored his discomfiture should come clear only as events accumulate.

43
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:13,420
All right.

44
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,454
The top of my to-do list every morning, and every day gets away from me.

45
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:20,821
Anyways, here you are.

46
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,008
Here I am.

47
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:25,461
Al's delegate, as far as him and you deal with Mr. Hearst.

48
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:29,666
Will you still if invited to sit or will it take me offering a meal?

49
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:31,772
I'd sooner not sit, Sir, and already ate.

50
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:34,040
Only asking, ought I bear a message to Al?

51
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,121
Nothing comes to mind.

52
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:39,856
Horsemen come to camp by torchlight last night.

53
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,837
Tell Al as we didn't wake to the apocalypse, I suppose all we need fear is their Winchesters.

54
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:00,212
The pillars of my existence who should know each other:

55
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:04,212
Mr. John Langrishe, my dear Aunt Lou Marchbanks.

56
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:07,273
With whose art I am most appreciatively familiar.

57
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:11,482
Uh, Mr. Langrishe is now to my back, Aunt Lou, what you have long been to my belly.

58
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:14,521
I may say that so long as the nodals are quiet,

59
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:21,387
that girth at the midriff, preached a sin by so many among the guardians of sacral well-being.

60
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,050
Is absolved as a danger by me.

61
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,894
I've been heavy all my life.

62
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:29,741
Oh, I refer not at all to you, Dear Lady.

63
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:32,853
Salty, juicy ham this morning.

64
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:34,646
I must have it.

65
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,177
The usual for me, Aunt Lou.

66
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:39,190
Sit sit sit sit.

67
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,302
Must I do so four times?

68
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:48,677
Ah, my closest confidant in the camp is Aunt Lou, and I say that with every awareness.

69
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:49,615
Wonderful.

70
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,849
I guess I must have went invisible over night.

71
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:56,381
I saw you, Drummer.

72
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:58,697
And yet you cut in front of me.

73
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,445
I just knew you wouldn't be eating.

74
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:12,837
Did I not see the gentlemen who is still upright arrive in the camp last night?

75
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:15,082
I believe I may have as well.

76
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:20,239
I was on the porch of this structure, and you with Mr. Swearengen on his balcony.

77
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:23,049
I believe he came in on horseback.

78
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,789
Not as a pedestrian, ironically, given his heavy-footed virtuosity.

79
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:34,368
What did Mr. Swearengen make of the coming into camp of that man among his friends?

80
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:40,859
Do allow me, Mr. Hearst, as your corporal comfort's advocate, in this regard to be neutral.

81
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,161
Let me show in your company on the subject of Al,

82
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:48,786
no less rigorous a reticence than I exhibit with Al when addressing the subject of you.

83
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,983
Ah!  My ham.

84
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:12,647
Good morning.
Morning.

85
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:18,294
Good morning, Louis. I hope your night was uneventful.

86
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:22,792
Yes, ma'am. Jim's late so I'll watch till he arrives.
Thank you.

87
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,316
How have you been, Trixie?

88
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:30,222
No complaints. As if anybody would give a shit.

89
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,013
I come to put in some money.

90
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:35,262
I'm glad.

91
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:50,510
Oh shit!  You motherfucker!

92
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:55,422
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

93
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:57,293
I ain't no Goddamn nurse!

94
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,419
I gotta see to my business in this camp.

95
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,267
Tom's rules. You can't set if you ain't drinking.

96
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,447
He's buying for them that do.

97
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,030
Yeah, uh, and what if he messes hisself?

98
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:08,606
For them that wipes him off.

99
00:09:09,868 --> 00:09:12,105
I ain't seeing him out. I ain't gonna fucking do it!

100
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:21,167
You seem better of late at a distance than you appeared when last seen up close.

101
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:23,697
And now that you've seen me up close?

102
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:28,416
I get the same impression, particularly of a clearness at the eye.

103
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,557
I am better.

104
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:32,072
Good morning.

105
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:37,260
Anyways, there's 12 bucks I deposit into my account.

106
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:41,198
If the currency's counterfeit, my fucking Jew boss is the culprit.

107
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:47,164
Do not, please, Madam, hasten your business or abridge it.

108
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:48,219
I don't need no receipt.

109
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:50,195
Trust the lady.

110
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:56,816
John Langrishe, Madam,
of the Langrishe Theater Company.

111
00:09:58,413 --> 00:09:59,610
How do you do, Mr. Langrishe?

112
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:02,219
Glad I'm well to bid you good morning.

113
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:06,625
I'd undertake two transactions.

114
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:13,409
Deposit of $4,000 and the borrowing of like amount.

115
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,127
Those would seem at cross-purpose.

116
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:21,679
Theater types being perceived as transient, nomadic

117
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:25,752
—without stake, so to speak, in a place's particulars—

118
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:35,046
my redundant undertakings would allay mistrust of my kind endemic in such camps as these.

119
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:41,770
Oh. No less weighty than my verbiage.

120
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,647
You have your loan, Mr. Langrishe.

121
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:48,937
A pleasure, Mrs. Ellsworth.

122
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,688
By way of publicity, this evening we conduct an amateur night.

123
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,785
I wish to state, unequivocally with this imposing gentleman as witness,

124
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:14,179
I have no gossamer filament of doubt you have skills to delight and amaze.

125
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:20,469
They have their fucking fun with you, and in the morning, they treat you like dirt.

126
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:23,657
And you a fucking virgin…

127
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,796
No, and not pretending to be.

128
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,951
To be wounded by her callous ways.

129
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,344
All I'm saying is she could have been nicer, and those steerers more fucking polite.

130
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,934
Assholes!

131
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:47,452
Hey, we got a timber lease to work. Get over there.

132
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:58,417
Dinh.

133
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,228
Oh, yeah, I'm sure them scribblin's as clear as fuckin' rainwater to you, Johnny

134
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:29,714
—He who was stymied by a couple of fucking X's and a Goddamn straight line.

135
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:33,372
Winks, grins, gives Wu the big okay.

136
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:34,916
Okay.

137
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:42,305
If I recall the drawing you're referring to, I believe the straight line signifying the bar was first made out by me.

138
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:51,191
As far as these pictures here, now I, not fathoming the full particulars, I feel I get the general drift.

139
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,797
You best trot upstairs with Johnny, Wu.

140
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:54,985
Show Al your work is finished.

141
00:12:55,817 --> 00:13:00,078
But remember, Al, he—he ain't near as quick as Johnny or fucking Jewel.

142
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:04,702
No, Al might be confused and treat you to a fucking ass-kicking.

143
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,787
Bok Gwai Lo.

144
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:16,608
Well, what does Tolliver know of the guns come to camp?

145
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,762
Said he don't know nothing.

146
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:19,692
And you fuckin' believe him, huh?

147
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,015
I think, I did. Felt like he's outside looking in.

148
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,009
We ought to form a fucking club.

149
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:42,825
Fucking Yankton's rejoined us for Christ's fucking sake?

150
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,701
Must have finished stealing from the Indians.

151
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,408
Wipe your ass, Hiram.

152
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,918
It feels strange at first, but the shit protects against blisters.

153
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:16,543
Will you be here after work?

154
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,451
If I am, will you suck my prick?

155
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:21,355
Well, if you ain't, and a fella says Hiram's trying to find you,

156
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,370
if he don't go on to call you a cunt, he's cutting the message short.

157
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:27,823
Let's go, Morgan.

158
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:31,935
What, was it him that got you hooked on cocksucking? Get on the fucking wagon.

159
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:33,283
I'll be here, Hiram.

160
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:35,807
Try some shit on them blisters.

161
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:38,227
Let him fuck your ass. He may raise your pay a quarter.

162
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:43,823
You might already be too loose.

163
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:48,065
See you this afternoon.

164
00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:01,621
A room, if I may, unexposed to the gales which must blow through that hole above us.

165
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,823
Mr. George Hearst, who is now the hotel's owner,

166
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,908
put the hole in that wall.

167
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:12,011
Enhancing not at all for me the prospect of a room in the hole's proximity.

168
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,844
Could I get a wheelbarrow or the like?

169
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:16,044
Yes, Sir.

170
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:18,563
Richardson! Wheelbarrow!

171
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:30,351
Miss Stubbs?

172
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:33,354
I guess you're near ready to take the children over.

173
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:36,583
Or are you ready now? Do I keep you from it?

174
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:39,373
Oh, I'm—I'm taking the children in an hour's time.

175
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:42,852
Just now you give us happy respite from our numbers.

176
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:48,508
Anyways, Mose says the man was a Norwegger from Wisconsin,

177
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:53,446
built the building around the tree so as to have sap on hand for syrup,

178
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:57,437
which must takes like hell for being burr oak, but...

179
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,103
probably smells nice in a lamp.

180
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:03,148
Does anyone know why he left?

181
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:07,695
No luck on that score. Far as that, we came up empty.

182
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,256
It's too bad.

183
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,899
It's freer rein for the children's imaginations.

184
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:14,963
Fewer facts, I guess, to trample.

185
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,224
I hope that you'll walk with us, Miss Stubbs.

186
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:19,965
Oh…

187
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,686
Sure.

188
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,942
Good. I'll see you in an hour.

189
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:41,827
I recognize, Mr. Fields, that in any foreseeable future, Steve will not resume operations of the livery

190
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:45,139
or pay on his note to the bank. Be assured I am grateful

191
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:50,853
for the expedient care you have taken of the livery and its occupants, having no obligation in this matter of any kind.

192
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:55,901
No shadow ought be on Hostetler's reputation that sold to Steve by me now taking leave.

193
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,444
No reasonable person would cast one.

194
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,643
I guess I can head out then, knowing the one in a 100 that is,

195
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,879
won't sully Hostetler's name.

196
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,504
I got a life to live of my own.

197
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:11,192
As do all here in the camp.

198
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,052
Sorry to hold you all up.

199
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,693
Jesus Christ, whoever thought I'd come to write an article?

200
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:29,182
Have you a notice you wish circulated, Sir?

201
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:30,503
What?

202
00:17:30,755 --> 00:17:33,336
By “Article” do you mean you have some notice you'd wish published?

203
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,535
By “article” I mean a fucking article.

204
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,877
What would be your article's subject?

205
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:42,097
You're a fat fucking bastard, ain't ya?

206
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:45,752
I think we ought best continue our conversation Sir,

207
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:48,524
when you're not under the influence of spirits.

208
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:53,650
Something stupid looking about you.

209
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:55,627
I must insist you leave.

210
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:58,905
Fucking irritating! How you look makes me fucking embarrassed!

211
00:17:59,565 --> 00:17:59,950
Oh dear.

212
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,125
“Oh dear”!?

213
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:08,686
Oh dear.

214
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:16,380
You'd better come help your friend.

215
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:19,293
Mr. Merrick, I'm sorry!  I'm so sorry!

216
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,386
Swedgin, Hearst, Heng Dai?

217
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,605
We're the opposite of fucking Heng Dai!

218
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:29,843
We're bok gwai Lo, the two of us.

219
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:30,816
Bok gwai lo?

220
00:18:30,816 --> 00:18:33,032
Fuck bok gwai lo! We're not fucking heng dai!

221
00:18:33,307 --> 00:18:34,668
We're the opposite of fucking heng dai.

222
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:35,821
Now make your fucking point.

223
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:38,344
Yah!  Swedgin!

224
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:39,324
Hearst!  Eek!

225
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:40,759
Jesus fucking Christ.

226
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:47,821
150 chung kuo cocksucka.Custer.

227
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,822
He's dead, for Christ's sake, Wu!

228
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:53,341
Hey, how about the canoe?

229
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,258
Did you know that had been fucking invented yet, huh?

230
00:18:56,511 --> 00:19:00,308
Custer, chung kuo cocksucka, 150, Custer.

231
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:04,196
Custer City?

232
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:06,698
Oh! Custer City!

233
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:13,167
Wu's holding his men outside Custer City.

234
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,227
Huh.

235
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,291
‘Cause you and Hearst are on the outs.

236
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:30,255
Clever precautionary fucking thinking, Wu.

237
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,186
Miss Stubbs.

238
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:37,012
Mr. Utter.  Mr. Langrishe.

239
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,984
The blessed Miss Stubbs,

240
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:43,222
whose bust is so very prominent in the mind's pantheon of the camp.

241
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:47,097
Some not 50 yards from us will put these of mine to shame.

242
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:54,046
As I've made to Mr. Utter a proposal,

243
00:19:55,093 --> 00:20:00,982
the answer to which he must generate only in privacy and after meditation,

244
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,044
if you'll excuse, I'll take my leave.

245
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,388
Well, I will too.

246
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:05,752
No no no, Miss Stubbs.

247
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:08,971
It is only I from whom he must be sequestered.

248
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,700
Your counsel may be invaluable.

249
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:17,983
If you can cartwheel or puff your cheeks like a fish…

250
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:24,002
we have a festivity tonight. I'll live in hope you'll attend.

251
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:34,239
There is a strange fucking bird.

252
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:41,131
Some kind of, uh,  amateur night he's organizing, connected with his theater.

253
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,605
Some way I couldn't fathom.

254
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:45,447
A prelude, he called it.

255
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:49,948
Fuckin' Jane ought to break out her bullwhip.

256
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:57,422
I nearly came to know for Mrs. Bullock to tell the children why that schoolhouse has a tree growing through it.

257
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,462
The new one has a tree growing through it?

258
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:04,119
Who the man was, why he built around the tree instead of cutting it down.

259
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,868
Mose couldn't find out where he got to.

260
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:11,587
Why does she need to know where the man got to for Mrs. Bullock to tell the children about the tree?

261
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:14,273
To finish the story.

262
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:17,307
More than where the man got to once he was through,

263
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:23,429
I'd think the story was of the tree and the schoolhouse built around it.

264
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:27,572
I guess you're right, though.

265
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:33,119
I—I guess children are like that, wanting to know all the information.

266
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,431
I guess that's how they are.

267
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:45,857
You got something to send, Miss Stubbs?

268
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:51,202
I was just stopping by to say good morning.

269
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:55,616
Friends become adversaries.

270
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,012
Become now, I hope, friends again.

271
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:02,194
Doing any good for yourself?

272
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:05,273
Oh, hard of late, Adams, doing that in Yankton.

273
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,367
That is something you would be aware.

274
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:10,556
From what I read on the crapper.

275
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:16,209
Washington harasses us for our difficulties in distribution to the Indians,

276
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:23,117
thereby distracting the nation at large from Washington's own fiscal turpitudes and miasms.

277
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,897
There amongst the turpitudes and miasms, you got caught stealing the money.

278
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:28,432
The money was not stolen.

279
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,895
There was an amount of siphoning off and certain irregularlities.

280
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:38,178
Sounds like it was regular as milking Bessie, 96¢ on the dollar.

281
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:40,261
Rank exaggeration.

282
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:44,261
If it was less than 90,  you fucked generations of Indian Agents to come.

283
00:22:44,768 --> 00:22:51,852
If saying so will let us go on, then, yes, we stayed above 90.

284
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:53,571
And did you lay a few cents by?

285
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:56,256
A few. Never enough.

286
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:58,456
Your star here is in ascension?

287
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,115
I've been keeping busy.

288
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:01,571
Tell me how.

289
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:03,605
Don't delete a single detail.

290
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:08,041
That's a pretty taut line, Mr. Jarry, not knowing how deep your hook's set yet.

291
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:12,520
How deep would 500 set it, time being of the fucking essence?

292
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:15,129
Hard to know till it's inside my pocket.

293
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:23,395
I'd rather not produce it in this place.

294
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,207
Worse gets produced here pretty regular.

295
00:23:36,892 --> 00:23:39,143
Much has been answered already.

296
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:42,673
Little has fucking changed.

297
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:46,986
Ugh, it was nightmarish.

298
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,517
Whatever cogent purpose the man may have had,

299
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:53,100
his drunkenness kept him from conveying,

300
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:58,676
and yet I had the eerie sense he knew what he was doing.

301
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,609
Maybe not so drunk as he seemed, huh?

302
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:16,870
Details, Sir.  Did the newspaperman try to defend himself?

303
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,108
Did he beg you to stop? Did he cry out?

304
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,136
He said “Oh dear.”

305
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:23,558
Was bleeding and curled up like a baby.

306
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:28,799
I'm guessing your bottom rib is cracked,

307
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:34,476
and this contusion at your belly show the colors of the rainbow before it's through with you.

308
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:38,133
Apparently, my expiration is not imminent.

309
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:40,518
‘Course, I'm wrong as much as I am right.

310
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:45,767
What purpose might the man have had, Al, in feigning drunkenness?

311
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:47,517
Allow you to penetrate the pretense?

312
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,766
Teach fear while inflicting pain?

313
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,607
You printed any letters lately, Merrick,

314
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:56,890
that some miserable cocksucker would send an underling to punish you for?

315
00:24:57,881 --> 00:24:58,798
Bastard.

316
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:01,198
I should be ashamed that I didn't come to help.

317
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:04,473
I'm so sorry, Mr. Merrick, my dear friend.

318
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:09,008
Oh, cut it the fuck out, the both of you, unless you want to act to the cocksucker's purpose.

319
00:25:11,617 --> 00:25:13,664
This came for the cocksucker, Mr. Swearengen.

320
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:24,460
Take it to him.

321
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:27,180
I'd like to punch him.

322
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:29,366
Give him the fucking telegram

323
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:32,229
—and no punching.

324
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,742
Long pulls on the laudanum as needed.

325
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:39,401
Check out that sow Tina, Doc,

326
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:44,978
when the opportunity presents. That ain't the whiff of roses when she passes.

327
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,728
Have I bled on your bed linens, Al?

328
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:52,336
You wouldn't be the first.

329
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:09,820
Do yourself a favor, Sol.

330
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,037
Stop thinking of that derringer as a problem solver.

331
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:14,642
It solved several for me.

332
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:21,644
Free fucking kindling, if you have need for it.

333
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,988
Our timber lease ain't nothing but pecker poles.

334
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:28,331
Let's see them blisters…Hiram.

335
00:26:31,663 --> 00:26:33,598
Aw!  Son of a...

336
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:35,745
Jesus Christ, Morgan!

337
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:38,600
Stay inside.

338
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:39,989
Stay in here.

339
00:26:41,693 --> 00:26:42,416
Help me.

340
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:45,021
I did, you motherless cunt—to bleed out in the fucking mud.

341
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:49,261
Stand away till I find out what happened here!

342
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:50,732
That fight was fair.

343
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:55,638
Bullshit!  Corey was under orders not to draw.

344
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:57,482
Man's gun's out of its holster.

345
00:26:57,732 --> 00:26:59,560
Was it you took it out after he was down?

346
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,760
Do you say I did?

347
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,158
That saw me come from my store as you came down the boardwalk?

348
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:05,754
I say someone did.

349
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:08,690
Corey had orders not to draw.

350
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:12,978
You're fucking under arrest.
What for?

351
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,942
For interfering with a fucking peace officer. Come with me for questioning.

352
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:18,340
All right.
All right, Sheriff.

353
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,063
You tell your men to interfere.

354
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:23,264
Give me a reason to do what I want.

355
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:28,467
Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph Company, Mr. Hearst.

356
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:29,500
Mr. Blazanov.

357
00:27:30,154 --> 00:27:31,248
Telegram for George Hearst.

358
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:33,612
I decline your gratuity, Sir.

359
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:35,903
Change in policy.

360
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:51,217
So where you gonna take this, Richardson?

361
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:54,574
To finish curing in the smokehouse.

362
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,062
How long you gonna leave it in there?

363
00:27:57,705 --> 00:27:58,436
Three weeks.

364
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:00,480
How you remember three weeks is up?

365
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:03,323
The notch where I sleep.

366
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:08,049
Beside the notches for my other hams.

367
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:10,745
You getting the hang of this, Richardson.

368
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,153
So next time I ain't gonna asked you.

369
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,699
Only check did you make your notch.

370
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:17,895
You'll find it made, Aunt Lou.

371
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:25,747
Would you excuse us, Sir?

372
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:27,246
Yes.

373
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,152
Odell is dead.

374
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,360
Jesus, help me.

375
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:47,994
They found him near the road to Rapid City.

376
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,999
How they sure it's Odell?

377
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:56,775
The letters I gave him were still on his person, and his Bible bore his name.

378
00:28:59,183 --> 00:29:01,056
Get away from ‘round me, Sir!

379
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,642
You don't have to feign strength with me, Aunt Lou.

380
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:06,583
I ain't pretending shit! Get the hell away from ‘round me, Sir!

381
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:09,491
Oh God!  Oh my God!

382
00:29:17,608 --> 00:29:18,960
Get out of my fucking light.

383
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,570
It's me.

384
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:24,682
Who is me?  The fucking eclipse?

385
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:25,804
Mose Manuel.

386
00:29:26,523 --> 00:29:27,538
Oh, really?

387
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,150
I thought it—it was Giganto, the runaway circus elephant.

388
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:36,680
Miss Stubbs has been looking for you.

389
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:41,731
Those kids need chaperoning to the new schoolhouse, Jane.

390
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:49,920
I cannot hear you, nor can I see you any longer.

391
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,419
You fucking drunken slob!

392
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:02,016
Get up and walk them kids.

393
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:04,212
Okay, Giganto!

394
00:30:09,021 --> 00:30:11,257
Don't tusk me to death with your tusks.

395
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,416
How long do I have to assemble myself?

396
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:25,941
They'll be ready to go in a few minutes.

397
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:27,210
Shut up.

398
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:37,503
I'm sorry, Mama. I'm so sorry.

399
00:30:37,974 --> 00:30:40,599
I can't take it.  I can't take it.

400
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:46,505
Who produced their weapon first?

401
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,960
Said they come out the same time.

402
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:52,584
We drew as one.

403
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:54,834
That's a fucking lie.

404
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:56,581
Come here a second.

405
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,384
Shut up.

406
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,349
Are you as sure about your timber lease?

407
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,612
What do you mean?

408
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,824
As that this is truthful.

409
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:10,659
Are you as sure that lease ain't worth fuck-all?

410
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:14,297
Absolutely fucking certain.
Then nothing holds you here.

411
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:18,628
And arguing against you staying is who this fuck-head works for,

412
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:22,838
and the man you shot in the fair fight.

413
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:29,709
Best you move on, taking your genius brother with you.

414
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:34,831
Um…I ain't showed myself to advantage here, Sheriff.

415
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:37,612
I'm fully fucking aware.

416
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:03,870
Stay close. I might need you for support.

417
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:06,066
I don't want to hold her hand.

418
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:08,392
You can lock arms instead.

419
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:30,758
Sheriff?

420
00:32:33,815 --> 00:32:37,181
Tell him I ain't coming for his lecture. Tell him I don't need it.

421
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:41,876
Tell him if my temper was gonna get the best of me, this cocksucker's brains would be on the floor.

422
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,629
Tell him I got it. All right?

423
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:46,447
Tell him I'm on top of it.

424
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:00,447
Sheriff.

425
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,266
They're finished, Charlie.

426
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:10,922
I got it.
I told Mrs. Bullock I'd walk with her.

427
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,593
Well, go ahead. Hello to Miss Stubbs.

428
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,962
Soap!  Soap with a prize inside!

429
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:26,192
Guaranteed prize in every case of soap!

430
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:29,615
Soap!  Soap with a prize inside.

431
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:31,888
Hello!

432
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:37,781
As we have in Chicago, Denver and San Francisco,

433
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:44,374
the Langrishe Troupe bids welcome to the Deadwood Camp!

434
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:50,329
Nights to come will find us on the stage within.

435
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:53,849
Our enactments may bring an odd tear to the eye,

436
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:59,285
and may be relied upon to produce guffaws and howls of laughter.

437
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:09,299
This evening, however, in memoriam of a passing colleague, whose jocund spirit hovers over our gay fiesta,

438
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:12,383
I will give you his favorite epithet.

439
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:19,593
“All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.”

440
00:35:20,341 --> 00:35:24,608
Tonight, we will be the audience to you.

441
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:51,372
How you feeling, Aunt Lou?

442
00:35:52,656 --> 00:35:53,759
I'm getting dinner ready.

443
00:35:54,412 --> 00:35:59,633
Don't.  Isn't right you serving supper to strangers when you're in such grief.

444
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,780
I want to.

445
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,451
No.

446
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:09,934
Kitchen's closed.

447
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:15,919
The sustenance I would take in any case, Mr. Hearst, like

448
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:24,041
a newly-hatched bird, would come, I would hope, from your mouth.

449
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,382
Don't follow so damn close.

450
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:46,693
Kill you if I could, George Hearst.

451
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,317
Sir!  Do you tumble!

452
00:36:49,259 --> 00:36:51,601
Do you have a colleague!  Tumble, Sir!  Tumble away!

453
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:52,569
Soap with a prize inside!

454
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:57,523
Magnificent!  Well done!  Bravo!

455
00:36:58,523 --> 00:37:02,044
A round of applause for our dueling gymnastics!

456
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:07,383
And again, who's there next?  Our pick of the week?!

457
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:16,169
On you go, Sir. Bravo!  Bravo!  Bravo!

458
00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:18,336
Young lady, you'd raised your hand.

459
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,836
I have a sense you might favor us with a song.

460
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:29,365
Jesus loves me. This I know.

461
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:34,217
When my dad died, I didn't even cry.

462
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,123
Here you are, I'll give you a dollar.

463
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:41,934
You cry right for him right now.

464
00:37:43,669 --> 00:37:45,307
Oh!  Look at this!  Look!

465
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:55,425
That is the best fucking thing I have ever heard in my life.

466
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:56,933
Indeed it is, Sir!

467
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:09,090
Hell, it's easy for you.  You didn't know the cocksucker.

468
00:38:21,994 --> 00:38:22,746
What's the upshot?

469
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,245
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

470
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:25,994
I was arrested, I was locked up.

471
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:27,245
What's the upshot?

472
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:33,340
Go and sin no more.

473
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:39,964
Go ahead, Charlie.

474
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:42,109
Where?

475
00:38:43,244 --> 00:38:44,870
Go ahead to the fucking amateur night.

476
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:49,640
You don't mind?

477
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:52,713
All right.

478
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:59,882
I believe I'll attend badgeless,  Lest I put a damper on stupidities.

479
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:18,057
Grandpa's trick!

480
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:24,305
It is, yes.  And we oughtn't to let that spoil it for us.

481
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:32,491
Such elegance! Such dexterity!  Ah, magnifico, magnifico!

482
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,983
Let's hear it for the lariat lad.

483
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:45,367
Get outta here with that fucking nonsense.

484
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:49,053
Get outta here before I cut your fucking throat!

485
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:53,981
Go on!  Fucking amateur night.

486
00:39:55,263 --> 00:39:58,913
Some people gotta…fucking work, hmm?

487
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,227
Look at this!

488
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,950
A mystery from the east.

489
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,724
Magnificent, young lady.

490
00:40:46,386 --> 00:40:49,051
Well done, young lady. Well done, well done.

491
00:40:56,114 --> 00:40:57,711
Little fucking James, huh?

492
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,552
He is a chatterbox.

493
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,646
“Why why why?”  Shut the fuck up and maybe you'll find out.

494
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:07,114
He liked the tree house most of any.

495
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:11,052
What's a tree house doing way the fuck up there?

496
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,614
I like them school kids.

497
00:41:15,613 --> 00:41:20,989
Well done, well done. Ah!  Orbs of gold!  The wonderful Mr. Richardson

498
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:24,690
And his magic orbs.

499
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,174
And again, Sir, and again.

500
00:41:28,847 --> 00:41:31,488
And again, Sir!  Hidden talents!

501
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:32,817
Richardson!

502
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:36,425
You're done.

503
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:44,334
Envy is a cardinal sin, Mr. Farnum. Cardinal sin.

504
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:50,195
How many are they?

505
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:54,987
265 soldiers have bivouacked near Sturgis now.

506
00:41:55,415 --> 00:41:58,039
Another 200 could be brought to the hills if needed.

507
00:41:59,454 --> 00:42:01,737
Why can't the soldiers near Sturgis vote twice?

508
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,832
Reinforcements are available should poll watchers prove hostile to repeaters.

509
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:10,053
Come forward, God damn it. My back fucking worsens.

510
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:12,319
I am so sorry, Sir.

511
00:42:13,234 --> 00:42:15,541
Better you dizzy than me have to turn around and look at you.

512
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:19,465
These votes will support candidates

513
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:25,203
of your preference in each office, Mr. Hearst, as if cast by you yourself.

514
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:31,358
My stringent instruction from Governor Pennington is to convey upon my return

515
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:36,613
a confirmation in your hand that— that we have had this conversation.

516
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:39,889
Then the Governor in turn confirms the rumor he's a moron.

517
00:42:42,537 --> 00:42:43,919
My heavens, no.

518
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:50,334
I do mean that he would seek your signature on any itemizing of particulars,

519
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:56,230
merely to confirm the fact that I spoke to you.

520
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:00,061
Oh My God.

521
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:06,326
Oft confused with the most high, though our inseams got different lengths.

522
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,577
Fuck you.  Fuck you!

523
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:17,115
You can't come in here, Cy.

524
00:43:17,316 --> 00:43:18,920
I suppose I could if I want to.

525
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:21,346
If you need us to talk, we can do it somewheres else.

526
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:23,347
It ain't for you to come in here.

527
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:24,724
Fuck you, Joanie Stubbs,

528
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,789
and your fucked-out whores thinking what's mine to come into and ain't.

529
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:35,132
Come on, girl.  Come on close.

530
00:43:37,293 --> 00:43:38,931
Come on.

531
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:46,396
Mose!  Help, Miss Stubbs. I'm too afraid.

532
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:54,511
What a lovely tree inside a building.

533
00:43:57,103 --> 00:44:02,602
Is that a darling fucking tree house in the precious fucking branches

534
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:07,937
for the shitheel little kids to play amongst in jolly joy?

535
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:10,312
Get away, you!

536
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:15,125
Well now, Mose.

537
00:44:15,374 --> 00:44:16,347
Go on!

538
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:18,982
You fat bastard.

539
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,222
I'll hold your heart in my hand for your beady little rat eyes to look at before I shove it down your fucking throat!

540
00:44:25,222 --> 00:44:25,936
Cy!

541
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:34,460
I wonder how till tonight I found my way in the world at all,

542
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:37,835
not having my steps directed at every fucking quarter.

543
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:39,343
Go along.

544
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:42,030
I got fucking places to go.

545
00:45:07,436 --> 00:45:08,949
Isn't this fun, man?  Huh?

546
00:45:10,247 --> 00:45:12,309
Ah!  The camp giant!

547
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:21,278
What a figure! What a figure.

548
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:26,042
Look at this!  Look at this!  Look at that, Ladies and Gentlemen.

549
00:45:30,892 --> 00:45:35,081
Well done!  Bravo, bravo!  Bravo.  Magnificent.

550
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:10,140
<i>As I was a-walking down by St. James Hospital</i>

551
00:46:12,365 --> 00:46:14,314
<i>As I was a walking down by there one day</i>

552
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:20,142
<i>Who should I spy but one of my comrades. All wrapped up in flannel and gray was the day</i>

553
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:26,615
<i>I asked him what ailed him, I asked him what failed him, I asked him the cause of all his complaint</i>

554
00:46:27,499 --> 00:46:29,940
<i>‘Twas all on account of some handsome young woman </i>

555
00:46:31,794 --> 00:46:35,011
<i>‘tis the reason why I weep and lament.</i>

556
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:43,263
<i>If she had but told me before she disordered me</i>

557
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:46,126
<i>If she had but told me all but in time</i>

558
00:46:46,899 --> 00:46:52,167
<i>I mighta got pills and salts of white mercury but now I'm cut down in the height of my prime.</i>

559
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,558
<i>Get six young soldiers to carry my coffin</i>

560
00:46:57,837 --> 00:46:59,760
<i>And six young girls to sing me a song</i>

561
00:47:00,886 --> 00:47:06,213
<i>I let each of them bear a bunch of green laurel so they don't have to smell me as they bear me along.</i>

562
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,276
<i>So don't muffle your drums and play your fifes merrily</i>

563
00:47:12,985 --> 00:47:15,466
<i>And play a quick march as you carry me along </i>

564
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:24,033
<i>And blaze your bright muskets all over my coffin saying there goes an unfortunate lad to his home.</i>

565
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:40,263
