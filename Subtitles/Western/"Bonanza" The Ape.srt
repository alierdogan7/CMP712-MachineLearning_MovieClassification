00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,472
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,109
<i>is brought to you</i>
<i>in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,772
(fanfare plays)

4
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,648
MAN:
Hyah! Hyah!

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,834
Freddy... I'm homesick.

6
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,236
Would you buy me a drink?

7
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,805
<i>Me</i> buy you a drink?
(scoffs)

8
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,573
Your job's hustling drinks
from the customers.

9
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,775
But I've been trying!

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,543
I can't get anybody
to buy me anything.

11
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,211
Maybe if you'd stop crying
in their beer

12
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,347
all the time
about being homesick...

13
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,450
- (ruffles cards)
- ...you'd make out better.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,217
It's a long walk
back to Memphis, Tennessee.

15
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,786
You'd throw me out
in the street, wouldn't you?

16
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,898
Your cut on them drinks is

17
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,265
what we're gonna
have to eat on tonight.

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,562
I haven't been able
to start a game all day.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,949
HOSS:
Go on in and get me a beer.

20
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,418
I'm going to go in here and see
Dave Stone a minute.

21
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,681
LITTLE JOE:
Right.

22
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,262
Sherry, those boys just
coming in--the Cartwrights--

23
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,231
they own a big ranch.

24
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,358
Get busy.

25
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,970
The young one is just a baby.

26
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,572
So sell him milk.

27
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,438
Long as you get your cut.

28
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,180
Howdy, boys, and welcome.

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,949
My name's Sheribelle.

30
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,619
You can call me Sherry.

31
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,488
Uh, pleased to meet you.
I'm Adam Cartwright.

32
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,789
This is my brother Joe.

33
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,790
Howdy-do?

34
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,858
It's my pleasure, ma'am.

35
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,826
Would you like to have
a drink with us?

36
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,662
Why, thank you.

37
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,498
I believe
I might just do that.

38
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,899
Hey, Dave,
let me have four beers.

39
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,300
Hoss will be along in a minute.

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,435
(coin clinks on table)

41
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,470
ADAM:
Uh, my turn to pay, isn't it?

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,938
LITTLE JOE:
No, I've got it.

43
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:24,544
(chuckles) Let's play blackjack
and win enough to buy champagne.

44
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,180
Is the only thing
you ever drink champagne?

45
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,883
You'll have to catch me
to get your dollar back.

46
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,684
Oh, honey, I'm going
to catch you.

47
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,785
You can bet on that.

48
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,053
(Sheribelle laughing)

49
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,389
(shrieks)

50
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,153
(screams)

51
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,894
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,930
I... I didn't know
you were there.

53
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,368
Now... I'm trying
to apologize like a lady.

54
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,069
The least you can do is...

55
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,704
Will you let go of my arm?

56
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,606
Ow... ouch!

57
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,042
Take your hands off of me!
You're hurting my arm!

58
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,044
Will you let go of me?!

59
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,313
Let go of me, you big ape!

60
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,010
You're the ugliest man
I've ever seen!

61
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,683
(theme music playing)

62
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,132
(breathing heavily)

63
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,369
You got somethin'
to say to me?

64
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,214
No, not me.

65
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,883
Whiskey.

66
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,890
Well, I got money.

67
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,802
Don't suppose he's human.

68
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,795
Well, I'm not fixing
to find out.

69
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,776
You don't have to.

70
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:42,315
Well, he's a customer,
and customers are my business.

71
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,716
Hey, Sherry, better not.

72
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,551
I don't think
it's a good idea.

73
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,754
Well, maybe <i>he'll</i> buy me
some champagne.

74
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,391
Hey!

75
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,656
Big man!

76
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:00,433
Buy me a drink?

77
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,597
Wow. I like <i>big</i> men.

78
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,676
Even if they are
uglier than sin.

79
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,542
(laughing)

80
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,347
I don't especially
like 'em stupid.

81
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,593
(growls)

82
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,470
Why'd you call me that?

83
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,974
Look, uh, the lady didn't
mean anything by that.

84
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,776
Why'd you say that to me?

85
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,046
I'd like to apologize
for the lady.

86
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,649
I ain't talking to you!

87
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,984
Look, if you don't want
to accept an honest apology,

88
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,579
why don't you go back
to the bar and forget it, huh?

89
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,691
(Sherry screams)

90
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,460
(horse whinnies, gallops off)

91
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,728
(grunting, struggling)

92
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,968
One hour and 15 minutes...

93
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,437
and they ain't even moved
the last ten.

94
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,429
(both grunting)

95
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,378
Dad-gone!

96
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,013
I'm sure gettin' tired.

97
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,175
How 'bout you?

98
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,919
What are we
fighting about, you know?

99
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,979
I don't know!

100
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,820
(Hoss laughing)

101
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,755
(coughing)

102
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,635
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

103
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,705
You know, you're dang near
as strong as I am.

104
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,839
(coughs)

105
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,574
And you smell
nearly as bad, too.

106
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,236
(both laughing)

107
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,010
Come on... (laughing)

108
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,382
(both laughing)

109
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,151
Hey, you don't suppose

110
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,518
they done something
to their heads, do you?

111
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,862
My goodness!

112
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,531
Two great big boys like you

113
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,833
fighting over
a little thing like me.

114
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,434
Gracious.

115
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,770
A body would think
you'd have better sense.

116
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,475
Not that it isn't flattering,
of course you understand, but...

117
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,709
My goodness...

118
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,978
where <i>did</i> you get
those shoulders?

119
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,848
Boy, Arnie, I swear, I...
I know some mules

120
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,450
that would like to be able
to kick as hard as you can hit.

121
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,054
Boys, please, you're...

122
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,991
you're making me
all butterflyish inside.

123
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,155
All that trouble over little me.

124
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,898
Uh, name's Sheribelle.

125
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,500
You can call me Sherry.

126
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,337
Sheribelle...

127
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,172
Now ain't that a purty name?

128
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,334
Ain't that a purty name, Hoss?

129
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,946
Yeah, that's... that's
a real pretty name.

130
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,114
Hoss, we got to get moving.

131
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,683
Pa's probably waiting
supper for us.

132
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,552
Arnie, these are my brothers.

133
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,387
This is Adam and Little Joe.

134
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,322
Hi, Arnie.

135
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,553
Purty, ain't they?

136
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,130
Well, they're not...

137
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,232
they're not really as bad
as they... they seem.

138
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,534
You fellas go on.

139
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,736
Me and Arnie's got
some talking we got to do.

140
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,137
Now, uh, Hoss, haven't we, uh,

141
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,173
lost enough time
on this already?

142
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,005
Go on, Adam.

143
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:18,651
They don't like me.

144
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,886
You'll... You'll learn

145
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,522
to like one another
once you get acquainted.

146
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,891
There!

147
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,794
I bet that didn't
hurt you a bit, did it?

148
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,630
Hurt me?

149
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,131
No, ma'am.

150
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:36,899
I've never seen anyone
with such big muscles.

151
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,408
Well, I sure hope Hoss
knows what he's doing.

152
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,910
Ah, you know he's always
picking up stray critters

153
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,246
bringing them home,
patching them up.

154
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,914
Remember that,
remember that grizzly cub

155
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,549
he found up on the Tahoe rim?

156
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,251
Yeah, well,
that was just a cub.

157
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,345
This time he's got himself
a full-grown bear.

158
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,371
(coyote howling)

159
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,307
ARNIE:
This is it, Hoss.

160
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,943
Arnie, this is where you live?

161
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,179
Oh, it's got a good roof on it.

162
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,115
HOSS:
Yeah.

163
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,518
Well...

164
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,820
I got you home
in one piece anyhow.

165
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,854
Hoss?

166
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,022
Yeah, Arnie?

167
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,691
Wasn't she the purtiest...
(chuckles)

168
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,027
the purtiest girl
you ever did see?

169
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,329
I ain't never seen nothin'
like her.

170
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,933
That's... That's her job,
being nice to folks, Arnie.

171
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,868
I wouldn't give her
too much credit.

172
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,771
Oh, no, Hoss,
she can't help being nice.

173
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,273
I can tell.

174
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,142
I'd like to see her s-some more.

175
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:54,313
Arnie, you don't, you don't
think for one minute that...

176
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,948
Well...

177
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,584
Well, what I'm, what I'm
trying to say is that...

178
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,487
Arnie, girls like Sheribelle,

179
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,023
they, they ain't interested
in a man unless he's got money.

180
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,357
Oh, I got some money.

181
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,160
A feller...
a feller give it to me.

182
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,595
What feller?

183
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,630
Some feller.

184
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,632
I don't know who he was.

185
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,101
I forget.

186
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,741
Oh... look here, let's...
let's get you out of here

187
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,542
and get you
into a rooming house somewhere.

188
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,311
I don't want that.

189
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,713
I don't like houses much.

190
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,649
Arnie, you can't just live here.

191
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,519
Well, this is a good place.

192
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,852
They ain't
nobody else a-around.

193
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,659
Hoss...

194
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,395
you're my friend,
ain't you, Hoss?

195
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,887
Sure I am, Arnie.

196
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,172
You ever have a friend before?

197
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,541
Sure I have.

198
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,444
Well, I was raised
with my brothers, Arnie.

199
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,280
Brothers is different.

200
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,216
I ain't never had
a friend before.

201
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,118
Course you have, Arnie.

202
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,653
No, I didn't!

203
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,355
You know why!

204
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,490
People get scared of me.

205
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,460
People just take one look
and-and they don't like me.

206
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,362
Well, I like you.

207
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,364
And I took
more than one look at you.

208
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,498
Well, well, well,
maybe...

209
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:25,165
you're...
a-a little more like me.

210
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,442
Your brothers--
they just took one look.

211
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,577
I can tell.

212
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,013
I always been able to tell.

213
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,879
Oh, I don't blame nobody.

214
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:42,354
Well, I ain't exactly
a palomino, myself.

215
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,889
Looks don't mean
everything, Arnie.

216
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,882
I-I guess I ain't
too smart, too.

217
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,663
People don't leave me alone.

218
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,233
I get mad sometimes.

219
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,227
I oughta be used to it,
but I get mad.

220
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,111
What I need's money, Hoss.

221
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,353
It's gonna take a lot of money.

222
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,689
What's gonna take
a lot of money?

223
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,191
My farm.

224
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,394
I-I used to live on a farm.

225
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,530
Y-You ever live on a farm, Hoss?

226
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,368
Yeah, I... I guess I sort of
live on a farm now.

227
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,360
Yeah?

228
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,175
Ain't nothin' like a farm.

229
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,644
I used to get up
real early in the morning

230
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,747
and go out and slop the pigs.

231
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,740
Whole bunch of
little old baby pigs.

232
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,322
They ain't hardly got
no hair at all--

233
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,892
just a-squealin'
and a-eatin' away.

234
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,160
And that ol' sow,
standin' over 'em,

235
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,663
making sure every one
of her little babies

236
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,655
gets enough to eat.

237
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,737
How come pigs
is better'n people?

238
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,006
You really liked it back there,
didn't you, Arnie?

239
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,999
They, they ain't nothin'
like a farm.

240
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,115
When I get my farm, ain't
gonna be nobody mean on it.

241
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:21,420
I'm gonna have cows and pigs
and maybe even some sheep.

242
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,657
And they all gonna get along
good together.

243
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,426
And just them animals and me.

244
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,863
And, well, maybe...

245
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,431
maybe somebody else.

246
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,201
How'd-How'd you like to come out
and go to work on my place?

247
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,191
The Ponderosa.

248
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,173
Well, what'll your brothers say?

249
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,975
Well, they ain't got
nothin' to do with it.

250
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,543
It's-It's up to me.

251
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,567
Me and my pa.

252
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:52,851
I-I could make some money.

253
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:58,624
Hoss, you think
Sh-Sheribelle would like me

254
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,093
i-if I was making some money?

255
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,595
(sighs):
I...

256
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,265
I wouldn't count on it
too much, Arnie.

257
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,861
That-That Sheribelle--
she's a... she's a funny girl.

258
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,149
That's the way I feel,

259
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,051
and I know Adam will
back me up all the way.

260
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,653
That's right, I do;
and I'm sorry, Hoss.

261
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,821
Now, wait a minute.

262
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,089
There ain't nothin' wrong
with Arnie.

263
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,324
He-He's just
a great big strong man.

264
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,892
He-He ain't too smart,
that's true.

265
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,794
But that don't mean
he can't do a job.

266
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,330
I'd just as soon have
a wild animal working for me.

267
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,065
He's strong as a bull
and just as dangerous.

268
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,400
You can't trust him!

269
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,401
That ain't true, Adam.

270
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,535
He don't mean no harm, Pa.

271
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,903
He-He don't mean no harm?!

272
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,605
I just won't be able
to use my jaw for a week.

273
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,606
Well, that'll be a relief.

274
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,874
All you do with it
is jaw, anyway.

275
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,605
Come on, the sun's up.
We got work to do.

276
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,782
Just remember, Hoss...

277
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,118
we didn't do anything
to make him that mad.

278
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,687
If you hadn't come along
when you did,

279
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,679
he might've killed somebody.

280
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,930
What about it, Hoss?

281
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,118
Is that the way it was?

282
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,654
Oh, it... wasn't
all that bad, Pa.

283
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,157
Sounds as though it were.

284
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,826
Why do you want to get mixed up
with somebody like that?

285
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,386
I guess I just understand him.

286
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,600
I sort of put myself
in his shoes.

287
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,006
When... When you're as big
as-as Arnie and me, Pa, you...

288
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,842
Well... there's some things
he's got to learn, Pa,

289
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,210
some things that I learned.

290
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,379
Don't you think he'd be
better off

291
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,848
learning those things
by himself, the way you did?

292
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,751
Pa, I didn't learn 'em
by myself.

293
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,745
I had you and Little Joe
and Adam to back me up.

294
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,192
Arnie ain't got nobody, Pa.

295
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,761
You mean he needs a friend?

296
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,754
He's got a friend, Pa.

297
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,268
A man like Arnie just
can't afford to go around

298
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,971
losing his temper
like ordinary folks.

299
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,740
He's got to learn to put up
with a little teasing.

300
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,077
Sometimes even from a girl.

301
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,580
He needs me, Pa,
to help him learn those things.

302
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,917
Can you teach him
to control his temper?

303
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,552
I won't stand
for any troublemaking.

304
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:44,389
Aw, Pa, Arnie ain't gonna
start no trouble.

305
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,358
He's pretty good at ending it.

306
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,462
Well... all right.

307
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,798
We can always use a good hand
on the Ponderosa.

308
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,400
Thanks, Pa.

309
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,735
Soon as I finish work,

310
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,727
I'll go into Virginia
and get him.

311
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,943
(door opens, closes)

312
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,935
(piano playing inside saloon)

313
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,780
(laughter in saloon)

314
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,670
(laughter)

315
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,173
SHERIBELLE:
Hey, everybody, look!

316
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,641
Look at the big muscle!

317
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,109
- (whoops)
- Hey!

318
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,810
(laughter)

319
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,312
Let's have a little drink, hmm?

320
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,047
ARNIE:
Mm-hmm.

321
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,349
SHERIBELLE:
All right, here we go.

322
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,341
(laughter)

323
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,491
Hello, Arnie.

324
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,826
Hoss, y-you come back.

325
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,396
Sheribelle,
this here is my friend.

326
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,665
You got lots of friends, Arnie.

327
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,933
S-Sit down, Hoss.

328
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,001
We're havin' a good time.

329
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,404
Yeah, I can see you are.

330
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,705
This here's Freddy.

331
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,207
He's a friend of mine, too.

332
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,975
- Any friend of Arnie's.
- Yeah, sure.

333
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,044
Take all you want, Hoss.

334
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,479
I-I paid for the whole bottle.

335
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,917
I was just saying, Arnie is
the strongest man I ever saw.

336
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,554
ARNIE:
Yeah, I-I'm awful strong.

337
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,183
Only, I guess Hoss
is about as strong.

338
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,394
Arnie, I got good news for you.

339
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,562
Yeah?

340
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,397
Me and my pa want you
to come to the Ponderosa

341
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,387
and go to work for us.

342
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,202
Sheribelle...

343
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,838
you hear that?

344
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,173
I-I got a job.

345
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,941
Whoopee!

346
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,344
That's wonderful.

347
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,346
Now you can buy me
some presents. (chuckles)

348
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,947
Sure I can.

349
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,083
I-I never thought of that.

350
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,252
I-I can buy you presents

351
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,686
and-and purty little things.

352
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,221
(Sheribelle laughs)

353
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,757
Arnie, aren't you
forgetting something?

354
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,261
What am I f-forgetting, Hoss?

355
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,695
Your-Your farm.

356
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,997
You was gonna save your money

357
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,398
and buy yourself a farm,
remember?

358
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,067
Oh, no, I wouldn't
forget that, Hoss.

359
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,899
I-I'm gonna have a farm.

360
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,007
You're going
to be a farmer, Arnie?

361
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,008
Uh-huh.

362
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,643
I'm gonna have a big farm.

363
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,778
Gonna raise pigs.

364
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,346
A pig farm.

365
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,048
(snickers)

366
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,449
Did you hear that, Freddy?

367
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,786
That's what you ought
to have Sheribelle--a farm.

368
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,455
You're too nice a girl
to work in a place like this.

369
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,793
That's exactly
the way I feel about it.

370
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,062
Well, I-I've always wanted
a little cottage

371
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,397
somewhere out in the country.

372
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,665
With roses.

373
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh, yes!

374
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,670
With lots of pretty roses.

375
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,507
And maybe some
pretty little moo-cows.

376
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,376
FREDDY: Every girl ought
to have some moo-cows.

377
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,644
Shut up, both of you.

378
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,013
W-What's the matter, Hoss?

379
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,649
Well, Arnie, you're a long ways

380
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,518
from being ready
to raise moo-cows.

381
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,554
Well, a feller's got
to start somewheres.

382
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,757
They ain't nothin' wrong
with roses and-and stuff.

383
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:09,895
Hoss Cartwright,
you're just an old grouch.

384
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,997
I think it's wonderful
that Arnie wants me to have

385
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,132
all those pretty things.

386
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:19,304
And if Arnie wants moo-cows,
I think he should have moo-cows.

387
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,706
Fine.

388
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,774
I know where there's
10,000 of 'em, right now,

389
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,543
need to be taken care of.

390
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,179
Come on, Arnie, you got to
get up early on the Ponderosa.

391
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,982
Aw, Hoss, n-not right now.

392
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,418
Right now,
if you still want the job.

393
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,387
Oh, okay, Hoss.

394
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,189
Don't you worry none,
Sheribelle.

395
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,692
I-I'll come back, and
I'll bring you somethin' purty.

396
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,561
Sure.

397
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,931
Maybe just a little moo-cow.

398
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,924
(Arnie laughs,
others laugh at him)

399
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,682
There's your pony, Arnie.

400
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,150
He's all yours. Mount up.

401
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,153
This is my horse?

402
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,988
For as long as you want him.

403
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,981
That's the purtiest thing.

404
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,628
I-I come here,

405
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:19,865
I just had the clothes
I was wearin'.

406
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,458
Now I got a friend...

407
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,371
I got a job and...

408
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:30,976
and people are good to me,
and now you give me a horse.

409
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,344
(sobbing softly)

410
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,846
I-I don't know what to say.

411
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,849
Aw... you ain't
gotta say nothin'.

412
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,340
Go on, mount up. Let's go.

413
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,790
(cattle mooing)

414
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,140
Uh, hey, Pepe.

415
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,110
Uh, how do you say, uh, "pony"?

416
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,840
<i>Caballo.</i>

417
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,685
Come on, uh...

418
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,220
<i>ca-ballo.</i>

419
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,888
Let's go to work.

420
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,914
(Pepe laughs)

421
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,854
(cowhands shouting,
whooping in distance)

422
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,493
(cattle bellowing)

423
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,681
Doing real good, Arnie.

424
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,349
Sure a big fella.

425
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,017
Maybe bigger than you,
Señor Hoss.

426
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,353
Well, he ain't no smaller,
that's for sure.

427
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,754
And he eats twice as much.

428
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,090
I'd sure hate to have him
get mad at me.

429
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,293
Won't have to worry about that
as long as you feed him good.

430
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,195
We've got plenty
of frijoles, Señor Hoss.

431
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,187
(Pepe laughs)

432
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,368
(coyotes yipping,
howling in distance)

433
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,360
(Arnie sighs)

434
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,475
Well, I-I ate an awful lot.

435
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,845
Uh, did I eat too much, Hoss?

436
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,748
You always take what you want--
that's what it's here for.

437
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:19,784
I don't think you did
much good eating before.

438
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,521
Well, I-I used to get
awful hungry.

439
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,685
I-I ain't never
had a job before.

440
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,493
Arnie, you, uh,
you told me once

441
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,262
that a man gave you some money.

442
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,255
I don't want to talk about that.

443
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,339
(Pepe speaking Spanish)

444
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,831
(men laughing)

445
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,380
- What'd you say?!
- I say you'll never tire,

446
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,949
because you're the biggest
bean-eater in the country.

447
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,553
- You're a liar! You're a liar!
- No, Arnie, no! No! No!

448
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,284
- Señor Hoss! Señor Hoss!
- Arnie!

449
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,826
(Arnie panting)

450
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,663
Arnie, what'd he say to you?

451
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,298
They was laughin' at me!

452
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,033
Th-They was talkin' 'bout me!

453
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,035
We didn't laugh at him,
Señor Hoss.

454
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,037
We were only having
a little joke.

455
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,874
HOSS (panting):
I told you, he don't joke easy.

456
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,477
Arnie... we're your friends,
don't you understand that?

457
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,913
I-I'm real sorry, Hoss.

458
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,882
I just got mad.

459
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,351
I-I won't do it no more.

460
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,420
Honest, Hoss.

461
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,855
Arnie, I told you
you could work here, as...

462
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,024
as long as you didn't
cause no trouble.

463
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,255
Now that goes for fighting.
Anybody.

464
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,664
You gonna...
kick me off the ranch?

465
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:43,134
By golly, I ought to.

466
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,471
Well... I got it coming.

467
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,940
I'm sure gonna miss my horse.

468
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,609
Aw, shut up,
you ain't goin' no place.

469
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,277
But you said you was gonna--

470
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,379
I said I ought to,
and I oughta!

471
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,714
But I ain't gonna.

472
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,410
(horse approaching)

473
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,579
Go on and get you
a cup of coffee.

474
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,715
(horse whinnies)

475
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,327
What are you doing out here?

476
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,929
Pa sent me out to tell you...

477
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,263
- Hoss?
- In a minute, Arnie.

478
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,099
What's the matter,
you having trouble with him?

479
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,133
I can handle Arnie.

480
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,401
Ain't nothin' wrong, is there?

481
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,236
Yeah. Remember that squatter
you threw off the ranch

482
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,671
a couple of weeks ago?

483
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,773
Yeah, I ain't, I ain't likely
to forget Jake Staple.

484
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,309
Next to Arnie there, he's the
biggest man I ever tangled with.

485
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,578
Yeah, well, he's not
so big now; he's dead.

486
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,381
- Dead?! -Yeah, Sheriff rode in
late this afternoon.

487
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,349
Told Pa they found his body
up on the Carson.

488
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,484
He'd been robbed.

489
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,885
- Sheriff said--
- I want to tell you something...

490
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,854
Arnie, I told you I'd
talk to you in a minute.

491
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,289
Now, go on, sit down.

492
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,457
How was he killed?

493
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,925
Somebody broke his neck.

494
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,094
Snapped it like a matchstick.

495
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,897
Wow. That'd take some doin'.

496
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,066
- Yeah, it would.
- (Arnie panting)

497
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:51,736
What I got to say is,
I-I never mean to hurt nobody.

498
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,506
I just get...
well, I just get mad.

499
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,242
I-I don't know why,
I just get mad!

500
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,710
I don't wanna...!

501
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,537
(gasping, whimpering)

502
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,825
(sighs)

503
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,993
It's a scorcher out there.

504
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,161
Let's have another.

505
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,563
Hoss, there's something
I got to do

506
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,698
before Sheribelle gets here.

507
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,766
Oh, I got to buy her a present.

508
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,135
Oh, Arnie, you ain't
got to buy her nothin'.

509
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,271
But, Hoss, I promised her.

510
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,906
She likes me, Hoss.

511
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,041
Arnie...

512
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,477
Sheribelle's a...
a saloon girl.

513
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,713
It's her job
being nice to fellers.

514
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,582
But... well, dang it, that
don't mean she really likes you.

515
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,484
I never know'd a girl before.

516
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,519
N-Not never.

517
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,888
They didn't even want
to talk to me.

518
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,790
I-I just gotta
buy her somethin'.

519
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,125
I-I just gotta!

520
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,928
(Hoss sighs)

521
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,263
All right, Arnie, you...

522
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:55,256
you got your week's wages;
don't spend it all.

523
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,401
HOSS:
Dave...

524
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,059
Where's your tame grizzly?

525
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,369
He's out spending
his week's wages.

526
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,702
On a present for me?

527
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,741
Why don't you leave him alone?

528
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,877
He ain't never done
nothin' to you.

529
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,939
Ah... why don't you buy me
a little old drink?

530
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,018
You know, uh, it
wouldn't be too much trouble

531
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,487
for a girl to get to like you.

532
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,990
No, no, I reckon not.

533
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,926
No more so than...
getting to like Arnie.

534
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,728
Oh! That big ape?!

535
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,198
If you think he's such an ape,
why do you bother with him?

536
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,633
Well, he's a customer.

537
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,135
Besides, they pay me
to be nice to customers.

538
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,371
And he's good for laughs.

539
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,507
And around here, a girl needs
all the laughs she can get,

540
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,742
let me tell you.

541
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,074
(Sheribelle chuckles)

542
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,413
Well, don't push him too far.

543
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,082
He ain't got much
of a sense of humor.

544
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:22,086
Now, don't you worry--
Arnie bores me.

545
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:25,023
And once the novelty
wears off...

546
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,724
he's just a joke.

547
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,928
If that's the way you
feel about it, then...

548
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,897
you won't mind
not seeing him anymore.

549
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,566
Mind?

550
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,034
I'd be tickled to death.

551
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,037
And if you don't want your
big dumb friend coming in here,

552
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,131
then just keep him
away from me.

553
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,307
Hoss!

554
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,475
Lookit here.

555
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,810
Ain't it purty?

556
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,979
Uh, cost me
purt near all my money.

557
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,480
Sheribelle's a-gonna love 'em.

558
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,716
Arnie, Arnie, I don't think
you're gonna be able

559
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,150
to give 'em to her right now.

560
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,285
Why not, Hoss?

561
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,887
Well... Well,
she ain't in there now.

562
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,789
The bartender told me she
wasn't gonna be back till later.

563
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:36,661
But I-I ain't never bought
no presents for nobody before.

564
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,197
Sheribelle's a-gotta see these.

565
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,632
I want to give 'em to her now.

566
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,267
Arnie, I-I done told you,
the bartender said

567
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,669
she wasn't gonna be back
in there till late tonight.

568
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,171
But that's a long time, Hoss.

569
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,606
Aw, it'll pass
before you know it.

570
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,408
Anyhow, while you're waiting,
I want you to come

571
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,610
take a ride with me--there's
something I want to show you.

572
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,913
- Wh-What is it?
- Well, now, I can't tell you.

573
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,905
I got to show you.

574
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,318
Well, where are we going?

575
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,986
Up to the Tahoe Rim.

576
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,785
It's... sort of
a favorite place of mine.

577
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,894
Uh, then can I come back and
give Sheribelle her present?

578
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,830
Uh, promise?

579
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,992
If you still want to.

580
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,159
Come on.

581
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,285
Take a look at that, Arnie.

582
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,253
ARNIE:
Oh...

583
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,586
Pretty, ain't it?

584
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,067
I-I wish I was a tree
a-growin' here

585
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:27,038
so I couldn't never move away.

586
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,375
There's a little place all the
way across the lake over there,

587
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,176
about 150 acres, I'd make it.

588
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,446
Seems almost a shame
to waste it on cattle.

589
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,575
Sure would make a fine farm.

590
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,652
Good meadow, water.

591
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,721
Fine stand of timber.

592
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:47,558
Wouldn't take too much
for a man to buy it, neither.

593
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,560
Well, who owns it, Hoss?

594
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,496
Well, I do right now, but...

595
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,998
Arnie, you could own it
in a couple years,

596
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,300
if you'd work real hard
and save your money.

597
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,568
(gasping happily)

598
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:01,372
Oh, it's prettier than I-I even

599
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,909
e-ever did dream it could be.

600
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,147
A little ol' cabin over there,
s-some roses.

601
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:13,151
Well, I don't know
one flower from another,

602
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,450
but Sheribelle likes roses.

603
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,133
Arnie...

604
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,125
come here and sit down.

605
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,975
Arnie, I... I spend
a great deal of time up here.

606
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,511
This is grizzly country.

607
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,347
Old big grizzly,
he likes it up here

608
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,783
where the air's clean.

609
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,452
He can live and...

610
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,616
hunt like a grizzly's
supposed to.

611
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,594
He likes it by himself, 'cause
he don't need nobody else.

612
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,795
But...

613
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,797
you get down lower, you...

614
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,789
you get into the wolf country.

615
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,170
The wolf travels in a pack.

616
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,708
He'll track down
a herd of deer, and...

617
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:14,702
cut out the weak ones and...
tear 'em down.

618
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,349
The sick ones.

619
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,319
The old deers
that can't run no more.

620
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,989
People are sort of
like that, Arnie.

621
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,358
They... There's them that,
like the wolf,

622
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,694
they run in packs.

623
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,929
And then there's others that...

624
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,999
like the grizzly, they... they
like to get up in the country

625
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,734
where the air is clean.

626
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,536
They can make their own way.

627
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,335
'Cause they don't need
nobody else.

628
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,079
Arnie...

629
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,081
me and you...

630
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,649
we're bears.

631
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,519
We ain't wolves.

632
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,784
I-I don't understand you, Hoss.

633
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,094
Arnie, I don't want you
to go back into Virginia City,

634
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,062
tonight or no other time.

635
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,864
But I got to.

636
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,734
I-I-I got to give Sheribelle
my present.

637
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,536
Arnie...

638
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,571
you can have that land
over there,

639
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,673
you can have it tomorrow, but
that girl don't go with it.

640
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,776
You can move on your farm, now,

641
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:23,014
if you'll promise me you'll
never see that girl again.

642
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,750
<i>You</i> want her--
that's what it is!

643
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,552
Now, Arnie, wait a minute.

644
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,819
You want her yourself.

645
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,922
And you call yourself
a friend of mine.

646
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,056
Arnie, don't you understand?

647
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,291
She don't care nothing
about you.

648
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,059
She's been laughing at you
all along.

649
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,227
You're a liar!

650
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,361
Arnie, I swear it.

651
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,863
She's been
making fun of you, Arnie.

652
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,398
She admitted it to me.

653
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,100
You're trying to make me believe
something that ain't true!

654
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,336
I'm going into Virginia City
and get her right now.

655
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,929
Arnie, wait a minute.

656
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,532
(groans, sighs)

657
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,769
You said you was my friend,
but you ain't!

658
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,248
Hoss?

659
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,521
Don't you understand, Hoss?

660
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:07,219
I ain't never had a girl before.

661
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,906
(sighs)

662
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,068
Arnie?

663
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,739
Arnie?

664
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,010
Arnie!

665
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,991
Wait a minute.

666
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,592
Where you going?

667
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,194
My feet are killing me.

668
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,895
I've got to change my shoes.

669
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,564
It has been a long night.

670
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,965
I'm kind of tired myself.

671
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,504
I'll only be a few minutes.

672
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,439
Take your time.

673
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,743
Suppose I bring you
a little nightcap.

674
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:03,909
Sure. Why don't you do that.

675
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,266
(door closes)

676
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,267
(sighs with relief)

677
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,670
You.

678
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,738
All right.

679
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,640
What are you doing here?

680
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,409
Well, I-I didn't mean
to be late.

681
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,177
Hoss wanted
to show me something.

682
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,246
Will you get out of here.

683
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,715
B... I guess I shouldn't have
come back here.

684
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,877
I-I should have stayed outside.

685
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,755
Can't you understand English?!

686
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:49,360
I don't want to see you in here,
out there or anywhere!

687
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,762
Look, I brung you
these here beads.

688
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,135
You dumb fool.

689
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,970
(beads clattering)

690
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,872
You stupid fool.

691
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:05,042
Do you think I care
what you bring me?

692
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,811
You're just something
to laugh at.

693
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,680
You're just good for laughs!

694
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,683
Now, will you get out of here
before you stop being funny.

695
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,052
No! You better not mean that!

696
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,620
(laughing)

697
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,889
You stupid clown.

698
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:22,727
You're a stupid, ugly,
smelly clown!

699
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,229
- No!
- (Sheribelle screaming)

700
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,221
(Arnie gasping)

701
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,236
- Sherry?
- (thud)

702
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,535
Sherry?

703
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,000
(Arnie gasping)

704
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,449
(Arnie descends stairs)

705
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,785
FREDDY:
Help...

706
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,554
Somebody, help.

707
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,891
Help!

708
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,025
SHERIFF:
...but be careful.

709
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,560
He's big enough
to tear a man in two.

710
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,363
I believe I'd as soon see him
brought back dead as alive.

711
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,199
Yeah, I shoved that door open,
I saw Arnie standing there

712
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,934
like a, like a ape or somethin'.

713
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,570
Sheribelle laying
on the floor like a broken doll.

714
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,472
Arnie took one look at me,
let out a roar,

715
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,707
yelled he was going to kill me.

716
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,275
You boys know
I'm no hero or anything--

717
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,077
he's about twice as big
as I am,

718
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,678
but I tried
to stop him anyways.

719
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,348
And there's the man
who's responsible for all this--

720
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,749
Hoss Cartwright.

721
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,184
If it hadn't been
for Hoss Cartwright,

722
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,519
Sheribelle
would be alive right now.

723
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,853
SHERIFF: Now that's just
about enough of that.

724
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,288
Maybe the Cartwrights
did make a mistake

725
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,124
by giving that man a job,
but it was an honest mistake.

726
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,360
- Where's Arnie?
- Pa...

727
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,295
Hoss, if you know where he is,
tell us.

728
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,130
He killed a girl last night.

729
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,899
Huh...

730
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,367
And you're ridin' after him?

731
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,736
He worked for us.
We have a responsibility.

732
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,704
It's all my fault, Pa.

733
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,039
No, it wasn't your fault.

734
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,541
You tried to help him.

735
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,443
Hoss, do you know where he is?

736
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,946
(sighs) Well, I ain't...
I ain't for sure.

737
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,915
I... I know where he might be.

738
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,416
I'll tell you where it is, Pa,

739
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,251
but you gotta promise
to give me a head start.

740
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,352
Why?

741
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,887
'Cause I gotta see him.

742
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,757
I gotta try to explain
before they get to him.

743
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,426
Look at 'em--
they'll tear him apart.

744
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,894
Hoss, you can't let him go.

745
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,529
Now, he...
he has to be punished.

746
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,064
If you try to get in between him
and the posse,

747
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,933
they-they'll tear you apart,
too.

748
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,870
Yes, sir, I...
I know what's got to happen,

749
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,839
but he's my friend, Pa.

750
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,607
I don't know
what I'm going to do,

751
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,701
but I can't just leave him
out there to die all alone.

752
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,203
Where is he?

753
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,851
He's at Granite's Point
on the rim.

754
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,218
At least, I... I think he is.

755
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,923
All right.

756
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:33,858
You go to him.

757
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,094
Hoss... be careful.

758
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,086
Thank you, Pa.

759
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,303
We're about ready, Ben.

760
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,138
FREDDY: That's Hoss Cartwright
riding down the street.

761
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,473
I want to know
where he's going.

762
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,465
SHERIFF:
Will you shut up?!

763
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,614
Ben, where <i>is</i> Hoss going?

764
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,983
Well, why do you want
to know, Roy?

765
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,385
You ain't letting him
get the jump on us

766
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,087
so's he can warn that Arnie,
are ya?

767
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,056
Hoss knows Arnie
better than any of us.

768
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,325
He's just trying
to keep anyone else

769
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,493
from getting killed.

770
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,562
By helping that murdering maniac
to get away?

771
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,531
Now, Roy,
you know that isn't so.

772
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,833
If it was, I wouldn't have
let him ride off like that.

773
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,535
Ben, I should have known
that you and Little Joe

774
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,103
was just as anxious as we are

775
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,539
to get that woman-killer
to a rope.

776
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,574
We're anxious to see
justice done.

777
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,042
It's the same thing.

778
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,544
FREDDY: I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

779
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,045
I'm gonna shoot
that wild man on sight,

780
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,346
and if any of you
have any guts,

781
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,581
you'll do the same thing.

782
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,016
SHERIFF: Now, if you want
to go on this posse,

783
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,451
you're gonna do what I say.

784
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,021
Get back there.

785
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,718
You about ready to lead us
out to this Granite Point?

786
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,760
I'll get you there.

787
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,328
All right.

788
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,664
SHERIFF:
All right. Mount up, boys.

789
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,361
But don't any of you
take any chances.

790
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,033
(horse neighs)

791
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,888
You was right, Hoss.

792
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,957
She was laughin' at me.

793
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,326
(sniffles)

794
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,996
Hit me with the beads
I brung her.

795
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,166
I know.

796
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:26,661
I... I hurt her real bad,
didn't I, Hoss?

797
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,501
Arnie...

798
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,946
Arnie, you...

799
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,209
you killed her.

800
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:41,852
I-I guess I knowed I did.

801
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:44,254
I-I loved her, Hoss.

802
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,086
Why didn't she know that?

803
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,593
You killed Jake Staple, too,
didn't you?

804
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,962
Well, I didn't mean to.

805
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,666
I-I come in his camp
and he just took one look at me,

806
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,035
and he flung hot coffee
in my face.

807
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,337
It hurt awful, Hoss.

808
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,307
Well, I got mad.

809
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,443
I-I guess
I just hit him too hard.

810
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,846
And you took his money?

811
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,150
Wasn't going to do him no good,
and I was hungry.

812
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,319
Don't you see, Hoss?

813
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,655
I didn't mean to hurt nobody.

814
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:22,226
That feller, he burnt me and...
and I got mad.

815
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:26,030
And... And Sheribelle,
she was laughing.

816
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,500
Arnie, it's all right.

817
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,197
It's all over now.

818
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,703
They're coming after me, huh?

819
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,377
They got to, Arnie.

820
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:51,287
I always knowed
they'd be comin' some day.

821
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,020
I'm... I'm terrible sorry,
Arnie.

822
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,197
Hoss?

823
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,565
Yeah, Arnie.

824
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,635
I'm glad you brung me up here.

825
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,194
This is a good place.

826
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:12,176
I almost had it, didn't I, Hoss?

827
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:15,145
Little ol' farm.

828
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,082
Little bunch of squealing pigs

829
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,584
slopping out their trough,

830
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,679
and ol' mama nosin' 'em around.

831
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:30,024
I-I come awful close.

832
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,530
Arnie, turn around.

833
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,904
Wh... What's that for, Hoss?

834
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,442
We're gonna go down
and meet 'em.

835
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,344
I-I want to stay here.

836
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,880
Arnie, get your horse.

837
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,882
I ain't goin'.

838
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,851
Arnie, we... we're going
to ride down there together,

839
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,152
just you and me.

840
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,121
Now, I ain't gonna
let 'em hurt you.

841
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,758
You try to stop 'em,
they'll hurt you, too.

842
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,693
No, they won't.
I'll talk to them.

843
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,321
They ain't gonna hurt nobody.

844
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:11,368
You're right, Hoss.

845
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,937
You wasn't lying to me.

846
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,141
You're the only person
I ever knowed

847
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,843
who wouldn't lie to me.

848
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:23,413
I'll go with you.

849
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,216
You're doing
the right thing, Arnie.

850
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,208
Come on.

851
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,695
I couldn't let you do a thing
like that, Hoss.

852
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,392
They'd have killed you, sure.

853
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,813
LITTLE JOE:
Hey, wait a minute.

854
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,147
I thought I saw
something up there.

855
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,315
BEN:
Arnie?

856
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,476
LITTLE JOE:
I don't know.

857
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,788
Granite Point's only about
a quarter mile up now.

858
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,585
(panting)

859
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,402
(fierce scream)

860
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,746
(gunfire)

861
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,548
(Arnie yells)

862
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:32,811
(thudding)

863
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,951
I tried to help him, Pa.

864
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,223
I know, Hoss.

865
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:24,668
He didn't want me to get hurt.

866
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:28,469
He never wanted
to hurt anything.

867
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,008
I'm going to take Arnie
to his farm.

868
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,386
