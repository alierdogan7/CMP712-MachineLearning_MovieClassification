1
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:57,275
As far as I'm concerned,
you have my blessing.

2
00:01:57,819 --> 00:01:59,343
Thank you, sir.

3
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:04,523
The rest is up to you.

4
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,556
May I suggest the garden
at the west side of the house?

5
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,498
It's a very romantic spot.

6
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,770
I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine.

7
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,805
Dr. Alan Bent. Meriwether Lewis.

8
00:02:17,873 --> 00:02:19,170
-Doctor.
-How do you do?

9
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:22,836
Mr. Lewis is here from Washington.
He's Mr. Jefferson's secretary.

10
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,509
I trust the President is in good health.

11
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,309
He's very well, thank you.

12
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,611
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

13
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:46,860
I was wondering, Julia,
if you'd care to take a walk in the garden.

14
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:49,631
I was hoping
you were going to ask me to dance.

15
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,702
-Would you excuse us, Mrs. Hancock?
-Certainly.

16
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,172
Julia, couldn't we go outside for a minute?

17
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,380
I thought you liked to dance.

18
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,438
Well, it's....

19
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:03,711
I have something to say to you.
It's important.

20
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:05,514
I have something important to tell you.

21
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:07,680
Your friend Mr. Clark is coming here tonight.

22
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:09,280
Bill Clark, coming here?

23
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:12,350
It was Father's idea.
He thought it'd be a nice surprise for you.

24
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:14,520
I haven't seen Bill
since I got out of the Army.

25
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:16,791
I want you to tell me all about him.

26
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:22,793
That is indeed wonderful news.

27
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,570
I must tell my guests.

28
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:29,507
Orchestra!

29
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,804
Ladies and gentlemen...

30
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:38,177
Mr. Collins has brought us news
that I'm eager to share with you.

31
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,412
The Congress has approved
President Jefferson's purchase...

32
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,750
of the Louisiana Territory.

33
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:50,328
The President has acquired...

34
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:53,926
500,000 square miles of new territory...

35
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,629
more than doubling the size
of the United States.

36
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,779
Ladies and gentlemen...

37
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,945
I hope that you will drink a toast with me...

38
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,811
to this healthy young country of ours.

39
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,089
Orchestra!

40
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,399
-Good evening, Lieutenant.
-Good evening.

41
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,869
-Lieutenant, this is a great pleasure.
-Mr. Hancock.

42
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:35,008
My dear, may I present Lt. Clark?
Mrs. Hancock.

43
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,805
-Lt. Clark.
-My pleasure, ma'am.

44
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:39,438
-Mr. Collins, Lt. Clark.
-Your servant, sir.

45
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:40,740
Thank you.

46
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:42,545
Will you take punch with us, Lieutenant?

47
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,642
Nothing I'd like better.

48
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,548
There's Bill now.

49
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:53,952
It's good to see you.

50
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,156
Merne, what are you doing
out of Washington?

51
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,562
Well, I....

52
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,690
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,234
Julia, may I present Bill Clark?

54
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:01,769
Bill, Miss Julia Hancock.

55
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:03,270
-Miss Hancock.
-How do you do?

56
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:07,206
You'll have to forgive the Lieutenant's
appearance. He's been fighting Indians.

57
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:08,902
So I understand.

58
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:11,570
What about you,
still running the White House?

59
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:14,274
Well, I get a little help from Mr. Jefferson.

60
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,375
-Come and meet our friends, Lieutenant.
-Yes, I'd like to.

61
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:20,353
-I'll join you right after this dance, Bill.
-That's fine.

62
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,022
Miss Hancock.

63
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:26,253
Mr. Lewis, a soldier just come
from Washington with this message.

64
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:28,421
-Thank you.
-He's waiting outside.

65
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,331
Pardon me, Julia.

66
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:33,433
It's Mr. Jefferson.
He wants me back at the White House.

67
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:36,027
-Tell him I'll leave within the hour.
-Yes, sir.

68
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:39,039
It says, ''I'm sure you appreciate
I would not call you back...

69
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:41,940
''from your vacation
except for a matter of utmost urgency.

70
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,478
''Please convey my apologies
to Mr. and Mrs. Hancock...

71
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:45,877
''and especially to Miss Julia.''

72
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,609
I wish you didn't have
to leave tonight, Merne.

73
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:49,911
So do I.

74
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:52,381
-Goodbye, Mrs. Hancock.
-Goodbye.

75
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:55,287
-Goodbye, sir. Thank you for everything.
-Good luck.

76
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:56,850
Goodbye, Julia.

77
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:59,553
-You come back as soon as you can.
-Of course.

78
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,025
Take care of yourself, Bill.

79
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,890
-Safe trip, sir.
-Goodbye, Tom.

80
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:09,064
Seems a shame Merne's visit
had to be cut so short.

81
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:10,331
Yes, indeed.

82
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,973
You must plan to spend
a few days with us, Lieutenant.

83
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,269
By all means.

84
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,967
Thanks, I'd be most happy to...

85
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,905
if Miss Hancock has no objections.

86
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,875
Why don't you ask her to dance
and find out?

87
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,079
Come in.

88
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:01,585
-Good morning, sir.
-Merne.

89
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,521
Congratulations on the Louisiana Purchase.

90
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,490
I hope you and Miss Julia have forgiven me.

91
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,028
We're happy to hear
of your success with the Congress.

92
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:09,996
Dealing with the Congress is like shaving.

93
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:13,796
No matter how well you do, you have
to get up next morning and do it again.

94
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,302
However, in this case,
we've made a good beginning.

95
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,804
I'd say it's more than that, sir.

96
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:21,569
We paid $1 5 million,
and we got a lot of real estate.

97
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:23,410
We know it stretches...

98
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,878
from the Mississippi River
to the Continental Divide.

99
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,312
That's all we do know about it.

100
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:28,679
What do you have in mind, sir?

101
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,516
A military expedition
to explore and map our new territory.

102
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:35,078
Find out what's there:
soil, minerals, animal life.

103
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:37,056
Land is no good unless people can use it.

104
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,288
-Sounds like a big order, Mr. President.
-This is now a big country.

105
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:43,854
The first step is to explore
the Missouri River to its headwaters.

106
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:46,162
The second is to press on further west.

107
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:47,929
Beyond the limits of the purchase?

108
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:49,732
To the Pacific Ocean, if possible.

109
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,671
-But we don't own that territory.
-Neither does anyone else.

110
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:54,299
That's the point.

111
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,413
Here is the Mississippi River.

112
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,304
Here's the Missouri.

113
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:05,275
Here are the mountains,
and here is the Pacific Ocean.

114
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:08,880
Now, we believe there are rivers
flowing westward to the sea.

115
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,158
If those rivers could be navigated...

116
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:14,957
we'd have a strong claim to the land
that lies along the Pacific Coast.

117
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,555
-Your mouth is open, Mr. Lewis.
-I'm sorry.

118
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,166
We are surrounded by foreign powers...

119
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:23,700
who would dearly love to see us fall.

120
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:28,298
The dream on which this nation
was built will never be secure...

121
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:32,312
until the United States stretches
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

122
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:34,176
Do you really think it's possible, sir?

123
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:36,342
Would you please help me with this?

124
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:39,148
The leader of this party
must be a man of many talents.

125
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,519
A soldier, a mapmaker, an adventurer...

126
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:44,520
and above all, a diplomat.

127
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:46,658
A man like that might be hard to find, sir.

128
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:49,253
I don't think so. What about yourself?

129
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:52,031
-Me?
-Your mouth, Merne, it's open again.

130
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:56,067
Well, what do you say?

131
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:59,804
I'm tremendously flattered, sir.
I'm tremendously pleased.

132
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,498
Then it's settled.

133
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:05,177
I'll apply for a reinstatement
of my commission.

134
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,271
I took the liberty of going over your head.

135
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,282
You'll need one other officer.

136
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,875
Anyone in particular
you'd like me to request?

137
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:14,786
-Yes, sir. Lt. William Clark.
-Yes, Clark.

138
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:18,481
He's a good soldier.
He's had a lot of experience fighting Indians.

139
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,519
I want you to remember that, in a sense,
you'll be acting as my ambassador.

140
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,463
You will use diplomacy instead of force
wherever possible.

141
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:28,058
Yes, sir. I have one request, Mr. President.

142
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:31,572
I'd like Lt. Clark to share command
with me, in a position of equal rank.

143
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,834
If that's the way you prefer it...

144
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:36,103
you make your plans and we'll discuss them.

145
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:37,474
Yes, sir.

146
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:43,480
Now I suppose Miss Julia will really hate me.

147
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:45,382
I'm afraid she will, sir.

148
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,785
-Mr. Lewis.
-Good morning, Tom.

149
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,554
-Mr. Hancock is in the library.
-Yes.

150
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,344
-Welcome back. It's good to see you.
-Thank you, sir.

151
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,901
Is Julia around?

152
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,010
She went for a walk, I believe,
with Lt. Clark.

153
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,244
They should be back any minute now.

154
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:20,648
Come and sit down
and tell me about this expedition....

155
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:29,029
Well, you....

156
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:32,458
You told me
that garden was a romantic spot.

157
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:34,693
I guess you were right.

158
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,468
Merne, I'm very sorry.

159
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,715
Mr. Hancock, I've just asked
your daughter to marry me...

160
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:53,253
and she's accepted.

161
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:55,151
I hope you've no objections. She--

162
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:58,852
No, I won't object to anything
that will make Julia happy.

163
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,393
-Capt. Lewis is here.
-Wonderful.

164
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,054
I'm sure you'll understand...

165
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:06,623
if he doesn't seem to share your happiness.

166
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:10,767
No, I can't say that I do.

167
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,131
Congratulations, Bill.

168
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:18,236
Thanks.

169
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:20,004
I must tell you, Merne...

170
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:23,778
I don't think Lt. Clark
knew of your feelings in this matter.

171
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:27,483
I can see now that my feelings
were never shared by Julia.

172
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:29,556
I can't blame anyone for that.

173
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:31,655
Excuse me, gentlemen.

174
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:35,723
You got my letter?

175
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:40,490
Yes. I also got my orders
from the War Department.

176
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,470
Merne, I didn't realize
how you felt about Julia.

177
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,264
I'm sure you didn't, Bill.

178
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:52,773
I knew you were good friends.
I thought that's all there was to it.

179
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:57,614
I wanted to think there was something
more than that, but there wasn't.

180
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:01,082
Now about the expedition,
do you want to go?

181
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,646
Yes, of course I want to go.

182
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:09,760
Merne, you've got to tell me the truth.
We have to be honest with each other.

183
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:12,697
Do you still want me to go, now?

184
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:16,570
We leave for Wood River in the morning.

185
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:19,402
If everything goes well,
we should be there by early spring.

186
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,056
You, Shannon!

187
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:23,594
-Yes, Sergeant?
-Take up on them back stays.

188
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:41,954
-Capt. Lewis, sir?
-Yes.

189
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:45,515
Sgt. Gass, sir.
I'm in charge of the enlisted detail.

190
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,953
I'll show you to your quarters, sir.

191
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:52,256
What about the men, Sergeant?

192
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,700
They're a pretty good lot, sir.
Young and strong and full of the devil.

193
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,704
-They're all volunteers.
-Good.

194
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,999
I wish I'd had these boys
back in '76 against the British.

195
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:03,942
All they need is training
and a firm Irish hand.

196
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,644
Between us,
we'll see they get plenty of both.

197
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:09,842
-You are Lt. Clark, sir?
-This is Capt. Clark, Sergeant.

198
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,782
Sorry, sir. This War Department dispatch...

199
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:13,980
came addressed to Lt. Clark.

200
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:17,389
You were right the first time, Sergeant.

201
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,388
I thought you said
I was supposed to get a promotion.

202
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:24,954
Seven hundred men in the Army and
not one vacancy in the grade of captain.

203
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:27,126
-You said the President authorized it.
-He did.

204
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,795
You know the Army.
Somebody forgot to tell somebody else.

205
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,839
-That's no help to me.
-Don't worry about it.

206
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:34,500
As far as this expedition is concerned,
you're a captain.

207
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,668
Who should I believe,
you or the War Department?

208
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:38,473
-They say--
-I don't care what they say.

209
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,276
Mr. Jefferson said we'd share command
and it'll be that way.

210
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:42,839
-Is that clear, Sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

211
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,942
Capt. Clark and I will share these quarters.

212
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,419
-Will you send for our duffle?
-Yes, sir.

213
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:57,792
In gangplank.

214
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,432
Let go forward.

215
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,101
Fend her off.

216
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,000
Let go aft.

217
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,002
Helm hard to starboard.

218
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,347
Safe journey!

219
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:18,851
Goodbye.

220
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:51,278
Pull!

221
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,284
Put your backs in it.

222
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:07,226
Time.

223
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:11,538
Five-eight-six.

224
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,141
Forty degrees and 12 minutes.

225
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:18,735
Forty degrees, 12 minutes.

226
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:30,488
-Watch that line.
-Keep that line moving.

227
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,445
I just saw another one.

228
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:02,055
We must be getting pretty close
to their village.

229
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:04,785
Pass the word, Sergeant.
Everybody on the alert.

230
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,656
Expecting trouble, Captain?

231
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,627
They're Indians, aren't they?

232
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:11,524
When we land,
I want everyone in full uniform.

233
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,734
I thought maybe we could sail
right past them.

234
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,064
What's the matter, Sergeant?

235
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:18,605
Don't you want something
to tell your grandchildren?

236
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,407
Shore, march.

237
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,801
Company, halt.

238
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:00,874
Order firelocks.

239
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:05,911
We have come to see LeBorgne,
Chief of the Minnetarees.

240
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:07,249
I am LeBorgne.

241
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:10,682
We have come from
the Great Chief of the United States.

242
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:15,685
Our chief sends you this
as a sign of friendship.

243
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,890
-He wants you to know--
-<i>Messieurs.</i>

244
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,833
Americans cannot trade here.
This territory belongs to France.

245
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:23,868
-Who are you?
-My name is Charboneau.

246
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:26,873
I have the permit to trade here
from the Northwest Company.

247
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,806
The news evidently hasn't reached here.

248
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:30,969
This territory has been purchased
from France...

249
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:32,979
by the United States government.

250
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:34,776
We are here to explore it.

251
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,652
This is a picture of our chief.
He is your chief now, as well as ours.

252
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,217
These words...

253
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,951
they stand for peace and friendship.

254
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,151
It is our desire to live in that spirit
with the Minnetarees.

255
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:51,357
In return, you will get protection
from your enemies.

256
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:54,595
The Minnetarees need no protection
against their enemies.

257
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:58,727
My warriors are brave. We too have guns.

258
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:01,902
The white man has more guns
and more warriors.

259
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,035
If we were weak,
we would not come as friends. We....

260
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,047
We need one of you to guide us
to the mountains where the river begins.

261
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,448
That is the land of our enemies,
the Shoshones.

262
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,111
We'll not go there.

263
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,555
How about you, Charboneau?
You ought to know this country.

264
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:20,651
If you are successful,
other Americans will come.

265
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,758
There will be trading posts
at every bend of the river.

266
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:27,528
No. I will not help you to ruin my business.

267
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:31,165
This is a big country.
There's room enough for everybody.

268
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,399
I like it better the way it is.

269
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:36,743
We came as friends.
We will leave as friends.

270
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,811
With your permission,
we will camp here for the night.

271
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,178
We have brought gifts for your people.

272
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:56,994
Company, shoulder firelocks.

273
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,123
To the right, about face.

274
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,664
To the front, march.

275
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:38,104
Excuse me, sir. There's a squaw outside.

276
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,298
She wants to see you.

277
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,500
-All right, send her in.
-Yes, sir.

278
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:48,806
Yes?

279
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,781
My name is Sacajawea.

280
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:57,120
At the village, you said you are going
to where the river meets the mountains.

281
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,249
Yes, we are.

282
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,259
That is the land of my people.

283
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,528
That isn't Minnetaree country.

284
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,553
I am Shoshone.

285
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:07,533
I was captured by the Minnetarees.

286
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:11,566
They raid our villages, steal our horses...

287
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:14,073
and carry our women off as slaves.

288
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:21,142
Take me with you. I will show you the way.

289
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:25,745
What you ask is impossible,
even if what you say is true.

290
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,553
I do not lie.

291
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:37,628
I was wearing this when I was captured.

292
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:40,159
You will not see one like it here.

293
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:41,993
These are seashells.

294
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:46,066
The Shoshones live in the mountains.

295
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,933
My father got this
from beyond the mountains.

296
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:51,534
From the people
who live by the Great River.

297
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:54,637
-There's a river beyond the mountains?
-Yes.

298
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:58,013
The river that flows to the big salt water.

299
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,212
I want to return to my people.

300
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:04,780
My brother is chief of our village.

301
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:07,117
You would be made welcome.

302
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:08,418
No.

303
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,556
Sorry.

304
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,359
We'd like to help you, but we can't.

305
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:32,777
If you find your way, give this to my people.

306
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:36,352
I have stolen these seeds, one at a time.

307
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:38,218
Teach them how to plant the seeds...

308
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:41,090
so they will not go hungry
when the winter comes.

309
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:45,255
-This will be done.
-My people will thank you.

310
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,240
Bill, maybe we're making a mistake.

311
00:22:58,012 --> 00:23:00,572
We could use somebody
that knows the country.

312
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:05,409
I've been fighting Indians long enough
to know you can't trust any of them.

313
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:08,753
I think the girl was telling the truth.

314
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,228
I have given much thought
to the white man.

315
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:22,802
If they are allowed to pass,
many more will follow.

316
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:28,041
Then the white men will have
too many soldiers, too many guns.

317
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,766
This is true.

318
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:33,710
Already they speak
of their chief as my chief.

319
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:37,180
You have something on your mind?

320
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:40,517
I will need your help.

321
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:43,883
You asked once for the Shoshone slave.

322
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,622
Sacajawea.

323
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,694
I will give her to you.

324
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:51,521
What is it you wish me to do?

325
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,232
Crow Woman, leave us alone.

326
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:07,443
You will go to these white men.

327
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:11,808
You will tell them
that you will lead them up the river.

328
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,515
''It is further agreed that
the Government of the United States...

329
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:21,788
''hereby undertakes
to guarantee the protection...

330
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:24,160
''of Chief LeBorgne and his people
from all enemies.

331
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:25,755
''By the wearing of this emblem...

332
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,859
''Chief LeBorgne acknowledges
his allegiance to the authority...

333
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:31,302
''and sovereignty of the United States.''

334
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:42,879
Sergeant.

335
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:46,313
Detail, to the left, face!

336
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:49,785
To the front, march!

337
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:09,040
Take her in.

338
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:17,610
-Gangplank aboard.
-Sergeant, cast off.

339
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:19,549
Cast off!

340
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:21,815
Fend off there.

341
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,687
Pull in those lines!

342
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:31,621
Lay down your oars! Now!

343
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:37,297
Give way together!

344
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:42,837
Pull!

345
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:23,914
Tomorrow, you ride against our enemies.

346
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,712
The Great Spirit will ride with you.

347
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:32,190
You will bring back many scalps!

348
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:12,528
Shoshone.

349
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:18,696
Tonight you will sleep
in the hut of Charboneau.

350
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,272
I don't understand.

351
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,036
You have been given to Charboneau
by Chief LeBorgne.

352
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,204
He will want you in his hut
when he returns tomorrow.

353
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:30,147
But Charboneau has gone.
He will not come back for many moons.

354
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,308
He will return tomorrow.

355
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,280
Be ready for him.

356
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:47,266
He is leading the white men
up the river to the mountains.

357
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,564
How can he come back tomorrow?

358
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:53,561
Perhaps the white men
will not be allowed to go so far.

359
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,678
We are slaves, child.
This is no concern of ours.

360
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,855
Halt, or I'll fire!

361
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:38,661
Sergeant!

362
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:05,757
-Take me to your chief.
-Wait here.

363
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:13,299
What are you doing here?

364
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:16,858
I came to warn you.
The Minnetarees are going to attack.

365
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:20,305
-How do you know?
-I saw them leave the village.

366
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,273
Then how did you get here ahead of them?

367
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:23,969
Look at my horse.

368
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:29,839
Why do you ask questions?
You must do something.

369
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:32,043
I think she's telling the truth.

370
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,245
We'll see if she is.

371
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,413
Sergeant, double your guards.
Assemble the men.

372
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:36,751
Yes, sir.

373
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,419
McNeil.

374
00:34:16,656 --> 00:34:17,748
Fire!

375
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,341
Hold your fire!

376
00:34:56,997 --> 00:34:59,932
Thought you said
they wouldn't give us any trouble.

377
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:03,900
They are savages, Captain.
Who knows what they will do.

378
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:16,079
Maybe you'd like to deliver these yourself.

379
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:36,260
-Hey, look over there.
-What is it?

380
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:38,099
-Fresh game.
-Hand me my gun.

381
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:39,331
Buffalo meat.

382
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,838
Good size herd, too.

383
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:42,340
How about pulling into shore?

384
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:43,808
There it is, Capt. Clark.

385
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:44,935
Look at the elk.

386
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:46,444
Plenty of them, too.

387
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:49,948
Better eating than buffalo.

388
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,576
-Anything would taste good to me.
-Sure are a lot of them.

389
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,313
Never seen so many.

390
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:01,387
Hey, they got one.

391
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,160
Give us a hand here!

392
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,857
Fresh meat!

393
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:16,137
All right, I got it.

394
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:19,541
You should've seen the whole herd.
Bigger than horses.

395
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:22,445
We've been carrying this carcass for miles.

396
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,108
Pull!

397
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,300
Which way?

398
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,303
That way.

399
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,407
To the left, Cruzatte.

400
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:04,984
Bear to the right.

401
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:09,053
Better pull in to shore.

402
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,832
Merne, you wanted her along
because she knows the country.

403
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:19,462
She's positive it's the left fork.

404
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,734
I know, but she could be wrong.

405
00:37:21,808 --> 00:37:24,641
According to my calculations,
it's the right fork. Here.

406
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:26,303
You will find out.

407
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:30,008
On the river that comes from
the mountain there is a great falls.

408
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,880
How far up from here?

409
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,350
Two days.

410
00:37:37,657 --> 00:37:39,090
But we've got to be sure, Bill.

411
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:41,923
We can't afford a mistake.
Time is so important.

412
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:46,196
Why don't we split up and look for this falls?

413
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:50,893
All right. I'll take Charboneau
and try the right fork.

414
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,430
The one who finds the falls waits there.
The other one turns back after two days.

415
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:56,873
All right.

416
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,229
Cast off forward!

417
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:24,634
All clear!

418
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:28,164
Fend off there!

419
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:12,774
You take great care
with these tools of yours.

420
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:15,344
We use them to make maps.

421
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:18,688
Pictures of the river.

422
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:21,760
Here. Like this.

423
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:26,691
Look.

424
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:35,973
But you cannot see the sun on the water...

425
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,942
or the blue of the sky.

426
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,738
I would rather look at the river.

427
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:43,813
So would I.

428
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,145
These pictures, they are important?

429
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,857
Yes. I guess they are more important
than we are.

430
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:58,791
A picture is more important than a man?

431
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:00,230
Sometimes.

432
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:04,461
You see, our job is to get these pictures
to our people.

433
00:40:07,874 --> 00:40:09,637
They will come here.

434
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:13,237
They will bring their women,
and they will stay.

435
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:14,971
Maybe. Someday.

436
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:18,941
They are beautiful,
the women of your people?

437
00:40:21,788 --> 00:40:23,085
Some of them.

438
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:25,647
Just like some Indian women.

439
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:39,572
You know, that's the first time
I've seen you smile.

440
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,005
What is it?

441
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:46,674
I would like to see a woman with red hair.

442
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:52,642
Cruzatte! The rope!

443
00:40:54,854 --> 00:40:56,116
Cruzatte!

444
00:40:57,123 --> 00:40:59,023
Keep her bow upstream!

445
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:00,591
I'm trying!

446
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:08,227
I can't hold her!

447
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:57,734
You should put on dry clothes.

448
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,404
I have to get this sextant dry first.

449
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:05,645
A little cold water never hurt anybody.

450
00:43:29,642 --> 00:43:31,200
Do you like it?

451
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:34,406
It's very pretty.

452
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:37,848
It's nice and dry.

453
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:48,926
You know....

454
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,929
Maybe we could...

455
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:58,865
fix it up a little.

456
00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:05,437
There.

457
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,351
That's much better.

458
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:22,687
You look a lot more like Mary Jane
than Sacajawea.

459
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:26,120
That name's going to give me
a lot of trouble.

460
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:29,330
You mind if I call you Janey?

461
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:33,164
Janey?

462
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:35,834
It sounds pretty.

463
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:38,203
What does it mean?

464
00:44:38,878 --> 00:44:40,641
It means ''beautiful.''

465
00:44:51,924 --> 00:44:54,017
I'll tell you one thing, Janey.

466
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,594
That dress is too long.

467
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:52,574
Get to work,
you lazy, worthless, prying scum!

468
00:45:53,352 --> 00:45:54,546
Go on!

469
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:58,255
You men, get the supplies onboard.

470
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:00,258
Make ready to cast off.

471
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,054
Go on!

472
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:23,410
Steer for the bank!

473
00:46:39,832 --> 00:46:41,732
What do we do now, sir?

474
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:45,599
We'll wait here for Capt. Lewis.
Then we'll push on.

475
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:47,434
What about the boat, sir?

476
00:46:47,506 --> 00:46:49,371
We'll take it with us.

477
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:52,535
Up over them falls? Sir, that's impossible.

478
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:56,805
I'm surprised at you, Sergeant.
In the Army, nothing's impossible.

479
00:46:57,683 --> 00:47:01,585
Well, sir, in the Navy,
they say it was impossible.

480
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:07,782
Let her fall!

481
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,327
Let clear!

482
00:47:29,715 --> 00:47:30,773
Now!

483
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:34,418
All together! Heave ho!

484
00:48:12,925 --> 00:48:16,918
Hey, Sergeant, why can't they find
a river going our way for a change?

485
00:48:48,394 --> 00:48:49,691
Help me out, fellas!

486
00:48:49,762 --> 00:48:51,559
Everybody get a hold!

487
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:53,921
Hang on!

488
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:03,738
Get your backs in it!

489
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:20,085
That's done it.

490
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,083
Hold hard now.

491
00:49:31,837 --> 00:49:33,099
Sergeant!

492
00:50:28,894 --> 00:50:30,828
-Capt. Lewis.
-Hello, Sergeant.

493
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:33,294
-Well, the Indian girl was right, huh?
-Yes, sir.

494
00:50:33,365 --> 00:50:35,265
You men have done
a lot of work around here.

495
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:36,961
You wouldn't believe it, sir.

496
00:50:37,036 --> 00:50:39,436
We've been doing things that are impossible.

497
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:40,972
Where's Capt. Clark?

498
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,100
-He's in the tent, sir. He's laid up.
-What happened?

499
00:50:44,176 --> 00:50:47,111
Well, he just keeled over
while we was working.

500
00:50:47,846 --> 00:50:50,041
It looks like the fever to me.

501
00:50:56,922 --> 00:50:58,412
Fever is high.

502
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:00,692
I will take care of him.

503
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,086
Good.

504
00:51:02,194 --> 00:51:04,526
If you're as excellent a nurse
as you are a guide...

505
00:51:04,597 --> 00:51:06,360
Capt. Clark will be in good hands.

506
00:51:07,866 --> 00:51:10,835
Let him sleep now, but when he
wakes up, give him two of these.

507
00:51:10,903 --> 00:51:12,734
I'll come back as soon as I can.

508
00:51:13,706 --> 00:51:17,107
Well, Sergeant,
let's get the boat around the falls.

509
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:21,531
You like this American.

510
00:53:22,101 --> 00:53:25,537
You should know that LeBorgne,
your chief, has given you to me.

511
00:53:25,604 --> 00:53:28,402
-Why did he do this?
-Why is not your business.

512
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,030
You are mine.

513
00:53:30,476 --> 00:53:32,000
Remember that...

514
00:53:32,411 --> 00:53:35,039
if you want this American to get well.

515
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:57,332
The fever is gone now.

516
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:00,165
Look...

517
00:54:00,606 --> 00:54:03,370
what was that you gave me to drink?

518
00:54:05,477 --> 00:54:07,911
I didn't think you would remember.

519
00:54:09,214 --> 00:54:11,546
My head was in your lap.

520
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:16,352
Your hands were cool on my face...

521
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:19,056
and soft.

522
00:54:21,794 --> 00:54:24,024
When a man has the fever...

523
00:54:24,496 --> 00:54:26,828
he has strange dreams.

524
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:28,927
I wasn't dreaming.

525
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:32,468
Go to sleep.

526
00:54:36,508 --> 00:54:38,169
I wasn't dreaming.

527
00:54:52,825 --> 00:54:54,190
How is Capt. Clark?

528
00:54:54,259 --> 00:54:55,556
He wants his breakfast.

529
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:58,061
Breakfast? It's almost 4:00 in the afternoon.

530
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,757
A man needs his sleep.

531
00:54:59,832 --> 00:55:02,027
Those pills worked faster than I expected.

532
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,158
What pills?

533
00:55:03,235 --> 00:55:04,827
I used another medicine.

534
00:55:04,903 --> 00:55:07,235
It tasted like boiled gunpowder.

535
00:55:08,307 --> 00:55:11,105
-How are things going up above?
-They're not good.

536
00:55:11,176 --> 00:55:13,167
The men are tired, discouraged, and hungry.

537
00:55:13,245 --> 00:55:15,679
We're going out to see
if we can find some fresh meat.

538
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:19,114
I'll go up there later
and see if there's anything I can do.

539
00:55:19,251 --> 00:55:20,946
He's in your hands, doctor.

540
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,246
Janey will take good care of me.

541
00:55:23,355 --> 00:55:24,413
Who?

542
00:55:25,123 --> 00:55:27,557
I will take care of Chief Red Head.

543
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:29,150
Chief Red Head?

544
00:55:29,862 --> 00:55:33,821
He gave me a white girl's name.
I have given him an Indian name.

545
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:35,393
I see.

546
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:02,651
This is just about
the sorriest looking camp I've ever seen.

547
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:16,868
Cruzatte, where's that fiddle of yours?

548
00:56:17,843 --> 00:56:20,539
Sergeant, what would you say to a drink?

549
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:22,676
I don't mind if I do.

550
00:56:27,319 --> 00:56:31,187
Boys, you haven't tasted
the likes of this in over a year.

551
00:56:31,256 --> 00:56:32,985
It's called whiskey.

552
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:35,149
Well, what are you waiting for?

553
00:56:35,227 --> 00:56:37,024
It's enough to make a man homesick.

554
00:56:37,095 --> 00:56:39,393
That will put sand in your belly.

555
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,428
Come on.

556
00:56:44,102 --> 00:56:45,592
All right, Cruzatte.

557
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,606
You've wet your whistle.
Give us a tune now.

558
00:56:58,884 --> 00:57:01,375
Sgt. Gass, choose your partner.

559
00:57:23,642 --> 00:57:25,371
Come on, give me some.

560
00:57:46,765 --> 00:57:48,494
Come on.

561
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:50,559
Give me some.

562
00:58:05,283 --> 00:58:07,615
Take your hands off. This is my woman.

563
00:58:07,686 --> 00:58:10,416
-What are you talking about?
-She belong to me.

564
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,619
No knife!

565
00:58:27,873 --> 00:58:29,238
Let him go.

566
00:58:50,696 --> 00:58:51,993
Watch the knife.

567
00:58:57,636 --> 00:58:58,830
That's it, Captain.

568
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,521
That's it. You gotta go.
Get him while he's down.

569
01:00:25,724 --> 01:00:27,385
What's going on here?

570
01:00:27,526 --> 01:00:29,585
He tried to steal my woman.

571
01:00:29,694 --> 01:00:32,026
She's mine. She was given to me.

572
01:00:32,164 --> 01:00:34,064
I do not belong to him.

573
01:00:34,432 --> 01:00:35,831
Sgt. Gass...

574
01:00:36,101 --> 01:00:39,002
give this man some food
and send him back down the river.

575
01:00:53,652 --> 01:00:55,847
I thought you had more sense.

576
01:01:12,604 --> 01:01:13,764
Janey.

577
01:01:14,706 --> 01:01:16,333
What's all this?

578
01:01:17,142 --> 01:01:19,838
You have fought for me and you have won.

579
01:01:20,545 --> 01:01:22,843
-Well?
-I belong to you now.

580
01:01:24,015 --> 01:01:25,505
Wait a minute.

581
01:01:25,951 --> 01:01:28,715
I fought Charboneau
because he tried to kill me.

582
01:01:28,787 --> 01:01:31,517
I belong to you, as if you had bought me.

583
01:01:31,656 --> 01:01:33,283
It is the custom.

584
01:01:35,827 --> 01:01:38,523
This is a free country now, Janey.

585
01:01:39,397 --> 01:01:41,558
You don't belong to anybody.

586
01:01:42,834 --> 01:01:44,563
You do not want me?

587
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:47,504
That's not what I mean.

588
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:51,565
You see, our customs are different.

589
01:01:52,744 --> 01:01:56,544
We don't get our women
by fighting over them or buying them.

590
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:03,719
How does a white woman get a man?

591
01:02:05,257 --> 01:02:06,622
She waits...

592
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:09,624
until he asks her to marry him.

593
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:12,228
I will wait.

594
01:02:13,598 --> 01:02:15,156
Another thing.

595
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:18,896
You see, where I come from,
a man's only allowed one wife.

596
01:02:19,604 --> 01:02:21,367
This is a good idea.

597
01:02:23,074 --> 01:02:24,871
You don't understand.

598
01:02:26,678 --> 01:02:28,942
-You have a wife already?
-No.

599
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:31,675
I'm not married.

600
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,715
Then I will wait.

601
01:02:35,553 --> 01:02:37,714
It's not quite that simple, Janey.

602
01:02:38,356 --> 01:02:40,847
You see, there are
other people involved. I can't--

603
01:02:40,926 --> 01:02:43,861
You asked me to wait,
and I said I would wait.

604
01:02:45,363 --> 01:02:48,298
Now you are trying to tell me
something else.

605
01:02:50,168 --> 01:02:51,999
Janey, look.

606
01:02:53,805 --> 01:02:55,102
Sit down.

607
01:02:58,877 --> 01:03:01,971
You see, what I am trying
to explain to you....

608
01:03:10,355 --> 01:03:12,186
You stay here tonight.

609
01:03:13,925 --> 01:03:15,916
Get a good night's sleep.

610
01:03:19,464 --> 01:03:21,989
We'll talk this over in the morning.

611
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:39,409
Do you mind if I sleep in here tonight?

612
01:03:39,651 --> 01:03:41,243
No, I guess not.

613
01:03:44,422 --> 01:03:46,219
What's wrong with your tent?

614
01:03:46,691 --> 01:03:49,626
Things are getting
pretty crowded over there.

615
01:03:51,196 --> 01:03:54,165
Janey seems to think
that fight with Charboneau...

616
01:03:54,733 --> 01:03:56,724
makes her my squaw.

617
01:04:05,076 --> 01:04:07,943
By the way,
what did you name this fork of the river?

618
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:10,244
Sacajawea.

619
01:04:17,822 --> 01:04:20,154
What did you call the other one?

620
01:04:21,493 --> 01:04:23,154
I called it Julia.

621
01:04:43,615 --> 01:04:46,209
These are the mountains
where my people live.

622
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:51,277
Somewhere up there
is the end of the Louisiana Territory.

623
01:04:51,356 --> 01:04:55,349
What do we do now, Captain?
Carry the boat or move the mountains?

624
01:04:55,794 --> 01:04:58,160
We'll try to find a river that runs uphill.

625
01:05:31,696 --> 01:05:33,357
Let go of the anchor!

626
01:05:33,832 --> 01:05:35,823
Ready with the firelocks!

627
01:05:38,803 --> 01:05:41,203
Cruzatte, hold her in the center!

628
01:05:44,109 --> 01:05:45,838
Man the swivel gun!

629
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,672
Prepare to fire!

630
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,181
Stop. These are Shoshones.

631
01:05:54,352 --> 01:05:55,512
Janey!

632
01:05:58,490 --> 01:05:59,582
Get out of there!

633
01:05:59,657 --> 01:06:01,955
This is my brother, Cameahwait.

634
01:06:26,384 --> 01:06:28,716
We have much to be thankful for.

635
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:34,490
With these seeds we can grow food.

636
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,857
We will not go hungry when the snow falls.

637
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:44,863
The white chiefs have delivered
my sister from our enemies.

638
01:06:46,004 --> 01:06:48,404
We owe them more than we can pay.

639
01:06:48,473 --> 01:06:51,169
We are your friends. You owe us nothing.

640
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:54,676
As friends,
we ask your counsel and your help.

641
01:06:54,946 --> 01:06:56,538
Speak of what you need.

642
01:06:56,614 --> 01:06:59,811
We need horses to cross the mountains
and someone to guide us.

643
01:06:59,884 --> 01:07:02,318
We will repay you with food and supplies.

644
01:07:02,387 --> 01:07:04,480
The white men say they are friends.

645
01:07:04,556 --> 01:07:07,116
Let them give us guns, then,
to fight the Minnetarees.

646
01:07:07,192 --> 01:07:09,422
We are not here to make war
among the tribes.

647
01:07:09,494 --> 01:07:10,756
It is peace we want.

648
01:07:10,828 --> 01:07:13,695
These are big words.
But words cannot feed us.

649
01:07:13,765 --> 01:07:15,562
They cannot destroy our enemies.

650
01:07:15,633 --> 01:07:19,467
I have talked with my sister.
These white men speak the truth.

651
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:22,605
Do the thoughts of a woman
now guide our council?

652
01:07:22,674 --> 01:07:24,869
I, Cameahwait, guide your council.

653
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:27,977
Now hear me.

654
01:07:28,413 --> 01:07:31,871
I myself will take the white chiefs
across the mountains.

655
01:07:31,983 --> 01:07:34,247
Whatever they need, they will have.

656
01:07:35,186 --> 01:07:37,211
Does any man oppose this?

657
01:07:39,357 --> 01:07:41,382
Your sister, Sacajawea...

658
01:07:42,026 --> 01:07:43,653
she will remain here?

659
01:07:43,728 --> 01:07:45,628
That is for her to say.

660
01:07:45,997 --> 01:07:48,261
Before she was captured,
she was promised to me.

661
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:50,995
Much time has passed since then,
Wild Eagle.

662
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:52,969
Many things have changed.

663
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:55,164
If there is someone else who claims her...

664
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,673
we will settle it...

665
01:07:57,242 --> 01:07:58,436
between us.

666
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:01,842
It is already settled. My sister has told me.

667
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:06,247
She belongs to the chief with the red hair.

668
01:08:18,263 --> 01:08:20,026
You will sleep here.

669
01:08:29,741 --> 01:08:31,231
This is yours.

670
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:52,226
You are angry with me.

671
01:08:53,831 --> 01:08:56,129
What did you tell your brother?

672
01:08:56,868 --> 01:08:59,928
He wanted to know everything
that has happened.

673
01:09:01,506 --> 01:09:04,703
He said you belonged to me.
What did you tell him?

674
01:09:06,511 --> 01:09:09,207
I told him that you fought Charboneau...

675
01:09:09,881 --> 01:09:11,314
and you won.

676
01:09:12,016 --> 01:09:13,347
What else?

677
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:19,988
He is a man. He understands the rest.

678
01:09:20,058 --> 01:09:22,925
But you lied.
There was nothing else to understand.

679
01:09:22,994 --> 01:09:24,484
I did not lie.

680
01:09:27,932 --> 01:09:30,093
I did not tell the truth.

681
01:09:32,537 --> 01:09:34,732
-But I did not lie.
-Why?

682
01:09:36,174 --> 01:09:38,404
Why didn't you tell the truth?

683
01:09:41,946 --> 01:09:43,436
I was ashamed.

684
01:09:44,982 --> 01:09:46,210
Ashamed?

685
01:09:48,086 --> 01:09:50,611
He would think I did not please you.

686
01:09:57,695 --> 01:09:59,060
I am sorry.

687
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:01,722
I will go now.

688
01:10:10,408 --> 01:10:12,137
What are those for?

689
01:10:13,378 --> 01:10:15,869
To keep evil spirits from our door.

690
01:10:20,518 --> 01:10:22,952
What will happen if you leave now?

691
01:10:27,058 --> 01:10:29,492
It is a man's right not to want a woman.

692
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,051
No. I mean, what will happen to you?

693
01:10:34,232 --> 01:10:37,599
-I said I would go now.
-Janey, answer me.

694
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:43,969
I will be given to Wild Eagle.

695
01:10:58,656 --> 01:11:00,681
You'll sleep here tonight.

696
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:52,034
From this lake,
a river leads to the great salt water.

697
01:13:24,101 --> 01:13:26,228
These white men are friends.

698
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:28,566
They come in peace.

699
01:13:31,175 --> 01:13:34,474
You give my people food,
they will give you canoes.

700
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:36,345
That is agreed.

701
01:13:36,414 --> 01:13:39,110
-Sergeant, bring up the pack horses.
-Yes, sir.

702
01:13:53,464 --> 01:13:54,726
Bahrie.

703
01:13:58,603 --> 01:14:01,367
Go downriver to the land of the Nez Perce.

704
01:14:01,606 --> 01:14:04,234
Tell them they are not to harm
the white men.

705
01:14:04,308 --> 01:14:06,503
Tell them Cameahwait said it.

706
01:14:27,031 --> 01:14:29,261
This will not be forgotten by my people.

707
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,631
We are friends. That is enough.

708
01:15:03,534 --> 01:15:05,399
She was supposed to leave with her brother.

709
01:15:05,469 --> 01:15:06,959
Why is she still here?

710
01:15:07,038 --> 01:15:09,529
She changed her mind.
She's coming with us.

711
01:15:10,074 --> 01:15:11,974
Who told her she could?

712
01:15:12,176 --> 01:15:13,370
I did.

713
01:15:13,444 --> 01:15:16,004
-You better tell her she can't.
-Why?

714
01:15:17,515 --> 01:15:20,746
You don't care anything
about this girl's feelings, do you?

715
01:15:20,818 --> 01:15:22,513
Any more than you care about Julia's.

716
01:15:22,586 --> 01:15:24,383
I don't think that's any concern of yours.

717
01:15:24,455 --> 01:15:27,117
Anything that happens here
is a concern of mine.

718
01:15:27,391 --> 01:15:29,825
Tell her to go back to her people.

719
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,088
Is that an order?

720
01:15:32,363 --> 01:15:33,955
That's an order.

721
01:16:14,438 --> 01:16:16,497
-Everything ready, Sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

722
01:16:16,574 --> 01:16:19,338
We'll keep one canoe out ahead
as point at all times.

723
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,310
The rest of you stay together.

724
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,253
You want to take the point?

725
01:16:38,829 --> 01:16:41,320
You're giving the orders around here.

726
01:16:41,398 --> 01:16:43,525
-Sgt. Gass, take the point.
-Yes, sir.

727
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:45,364
Launch your canoes!

728
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:49,100
Easy now.

729
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,700
Too much power.

730
01:16:54,145 --> 01:16:55,476
Shove off!

731
01:16:59,984 --> 01:17:02,714
Watch the rocks there. Hold them steady.

732
01:17:04,488 --> 01:17:05,819
All clear.

733
01:19:35,306 --> 01:19:36,500
Janey.

734
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:43,636
Janey, darling.

735
01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:13,642
That's our point canoe!

736
01:20:28,292 --> 01:20:29,589
Sergeant, send four men ashore.

737
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,389
Make sure they have plenty of ammunition.

738
01:20:31,462 --> 01:20:32,724
Yes, sir.

739
01:20:32,796 --> 01:20:34,730
Thayer, Collins, Fraser.

740
01:20:34,865 --> 01:20:37,425
Better get started with your burial detail.

741
01:20:49,947 --> 01:20:52,939
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
You'd better take that up with Capt. Lewis.

742
01:20:53,017 --> 01:20:54,279
Yes, sir.

743
01:21:06,463 --> 01:21:09,455
The Sergeant here has something
he wants to say.

744
01:21:10,901 --> 01:21:12,698
What is it, Sergeant?

745
01:21:13,804 --> 01:21:16,295
-It's about the men, sir.
-What about them?

746
01:21:16,473 --> 01:21:17,940
They've had enough.

747
01:21:18,275 --> 01:21:20,300
We've been away 1 8 months.

748
01:21:20,744 --> 01:21:23,212
They know we've gone beyond
the Louisiana Territory...

749
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,214
and they don't want to go any further.

750
01:21:25,282 --> 01:21:28,843
-They're soldiers, aren't they?
-Yes, sir. They're good soldiers.

751
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,753
-There's something else, sir.
-What's that?

752
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:36,755
They know things ain't right
between you and Capt. Clark.

753
01:21:37,294 --> 01:21:40,422
I think that's got them worried
more than anything else.

754
01:21:41,832 --> 01:21:43,857
-Is that all, Sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

755
01:21:43,934 --> 01:21:45,424
Then let's get on with the work.

756
01:21:45,502 --> 01:21:48,562
Send out a patrol
to scout the other side of the river.

757
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:50,001
Yes, sir.

758
01:21:58,515 --> 01:22:01,279
George. Ross. I want two volunteers.

759
01:22:19,036 --> 01:22:20,503
Where are you going?

760
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,171
That patrol's been out three hours now.
They may have run into trouble.

761
01:22:27,244 --> 01:22:29,178
I think it's time somebody did something.

762
01:22:29,246 --> 01:22:33,342
That is my responsibility, not yours.
From now on, you'll do as you're told.

763
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:36,011
-Just a minute.
-I told you not to bring that girl along.

764
01:22:36,086 --> 01:22:37,075
You paid no attention.

765
01:22:37,154 --> 01:22:41,420
Now I'm telling you for the last time.
Put her in a canoe and send her back.

766
01:22:41,925 --> 01:22:44,553
-Sorry, Merne.
-I'm giving you a direct order.

767
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:47,026
If she goes, I go with her.

768
01:22:47,364 --> 01:22:50,162
-I won't send her back.
-That is insubordination.

769
01:22:51,201 --> 01:22:53,032
Why don't you prefer charges against me?

770
01:22:53,103 --> 01:22:56,368
I will. If we ever get back,
I'll have you court-martialed.

771
01:22:57,141 --> 01:22:59,302
I swear, I believe you would.

772
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,909
I've watched you with this girl.

773
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:04,004
You've been leading her on,
the same as you did Julia.

774
01:23:04,214 --> 01:23:06,205
Maybe you've forgotten about that.

775
01:23:06,283 --> 01:23:08,444
But I have good reason to remember.

776
01:23:08,585 --> 01:23:10,917
What are you trying to do, Merne,
get even with me?

777
01:23:10,988 --> 01:23:13,889
I'm not worried about you.
I'm thinking about Julia.

778
01:23:13,957 --> 01:23:17,393
We might as well get one thing straight.
I'm in love with Janey.

779
01:23:17,694 --> 01:23:21,357
-That's what you said about Julia.
-I love Janey. I'm gonna marry her.

780
01:23:21,632 --> 01:23:23,497
I think you're a liar.

781
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:29,436
Merne, I....

782
01:23:34,077 --> 01:23:35,840
Excuse me, gentlemen.

783
01:23:40,684 --> 01:23:42,413
Go on to the camp, George.

784
01:23:45,455 --> 01:23:49,915
Since you're not behaving like officers,
I'll not speak like a sergeant.

785
01:23:50,761 --> 01:23:54,128
I don't know what's between you two,
and I couldn't care less.

786
01:23:55,098 --> 01:23:57,828
But if you have any sense of responsibility...

787
01:23:57,901 --> 01:24:00,597
you'll stop acting
like a couple of schoolboys.

788
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:04,801
Them woods down there
is crawling with Indians.

789
01:24:06,043 --> 01:24:08,477
If we're to get out of this alive...

790
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:11,604
you'll need every man in the outfit.

791
01:24:12,883 --> 01:24:15,716
I'll follow you, but the others won't.

792
01:24:16,486 --> 01:24:18,920
And I can't say that I blame them.

793
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:23,751
If you'll excuse me,
I'll get on with the burying.

794
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:40,977
Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name.

795
01:24:41,612 --> 01:24:42,943
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done...

796
01:24:45,082 --> 01:24:47,414
On earth as it is in heaven.

797
01:24:48,285 --> 01:24:51,083
Give us this day our daily bread.

798
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:54,455
And forgive us our trespasses...

799
01:24:54,658 --> 01:24:57,684
As we forgive those who trespass against us.

800
01:24:59,162 --> 01:25:03,258
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.

801
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,926
Amen.

802
01:25:07,104 --> 01:25:09,766
I owe you men an explanation.

803
01:25:10,307 --> 01:25:12,901
You volunteered to explore
the Louisiana Territory...

804
01:25:12,976 --> 01:25:15,240
and you've accomplished your mission.

805
01:25:15,746 --> 01:25:17,941
But I haven't yet accomplished mine.

806
01:25:18,849 --> 01:25:22,080
I have orders from President Jefferson
to push on further.

807
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:25,450
If this river can be followed to the ocean...

808
01:25:25,522 --> 01:25:29,322
the United States will be one nation
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

809
01:25:30,927 --> 01:25:33,418
We've traveled a long, hard way together...

810
01:25:34,431 --> 01:25:36,991
and I'm not going to order you
to follow me further.

811
01:25:37,067 --> 01:25:39,433
You've served with courage and devotion.

812
01:25:40,837 --> 01:25:44,398
And I think your sons will read about you
in their history books.

813
01:25:45,509 --> 01:25:48,706
To those of you who want to go on,
I can promise little.

814
01:25:50,247 --> 01:25:53,045
I can't be sure we won't dig other graves.

815
01:25:54,518 --> 01:25:56,213
All I can promise you...

816
01:25:57,387 --> 01:25:59,753
is a chance to serve your country well.

817
01:26:11,868 --> 01:26:13,961
I'm going with Capt. Lewis.

818
01:26:15,772 --> 01:26:18,366
Anybody who wants to join us,
launch your canoes.

819
01:26:40,897 --> 01:26:43,195
Well, what are you waiting for?

820
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:14,117
Ambush! Hold your canoes!

821
01:28:14,424 --> 01:28:15,618
Ambush!

822
01:28:59,836 --> 01:29:01,360
Watch the logs!

823
01:30:07,771 --> 01:30:09,671
Board your canoes!

824
01:30:48,144 --> 01:30:52,012
By right of exploration,
I claim for the United States of America...

825
01:30:52,082 --> 01:30:53,674
all the land we have traveled...

826
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,378
from the Rocky Mountains
to the Pacific Ocean.

827
01:31:00,256 --> 01:31:02,417
Sgt. Gass, dismiss your men.

828
01:31:06,563 --> 01:31:07,723
Fall out!

829
01:31:07,797 --> 01:31:10,857
Have you changed your mind
about taking the girl back with you?

830
01:31:10,934 --> 01:31:14,893
No. Have you changed your mind
about my court-martial?

831
01:31:15,338 --> 01:31:17,670
Those charges are part of the official record.

832
01:31:17,741 --> 01:31:20,232
You can check them for accuracy if you like.

833
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:22,505
I'll take your word for it, Captain.

834
01:31:46,703 --> 01:31:49,433
You are sure
of what we talked about last night?

835
01:31:51,307 --> 01:31:54,037
If I go back to Washington,
you go back with me.

836
01:31:58,515 --> 01:32:01,040
You will be glad to see your people?

837
01:32:03,987 --> 01:32:05,614
I don't know, Janey.

838
01:32:07,691 --> 01:32:09,158
I don't know.

839
01:32:21,004 --> 01:32:23,370
I ask you to bear this in mind...

840
01:32:24,574 --> 01:32:26,337
when you study the budget...

841
01:32:26,409 --> 01:32:30,106
I am requesting for the year 1 807.

842
01:32:31,781 --> 01:32:33,043
Come in.

843
01:32:36,186 --> 01:32:38,586
-They're here, sir.
-Good. Show them in.

844
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:41,421
All right.

845
01:32:44,327 --> 01:32:46,955
-Mr. President.
-Lewis, my boy, I'm glad to see you.

846
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:48,895
-Thank you.
-And this is Capt. Clark?

847
01:32:48,965 --> 01:32:50,125
Lt. Clark, sir.

848
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,067
I hope you'll forgive
that unfortunate mistake.

849
01:32:53,136 --> 01:32:55,969
I have your certificate of promotion
on my desk.

850
01:32:56,039 --> 01:32:57,063
Thank you, sir.

851
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:59,335
I've also arranged a little surprise for you.

852
01:32:59,409 --> 01:33:01,673
It won't repay the debt
your country owes you...

853
01:33:01,745 --> 01:33:04,270
but I think it will be welcome all the same.

854
01:33:04,347 --> 01:33:06,144
Please sit down, gentlemen.

855
01:33:08,318 --> 01:33:11,116
-May I ask a favor, Mr. President?
-Of course.

856
01:33:11,421 --> 01:33:13,889
There's someone outside
I'd like you to meet.

857
01:33:13,957 --> 01:33:17,393
Someone who helped us a great deal.
Saved our lives, as a matter of fact.

858
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,553
By all means. Bring him in.

859
01:33:21,464 --> 01:33:22,988
Thank you, sir.

860
01:33:39,783 --> 01:33:43,014
Sir, may I present Sacajawea,
Shoshone Tribe.

861
01:33:43,853 --> 01:33:45,582
Janey, this is our chief.

862
01:33:46,589 --> 01:33:48,955
It is an honor to receive you, my dear.

863
01:33:49,392 --> 01:33:51,189
I am very happy to be here.

864
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:55,757
Clark isn't exaggerating, sir.
We owe this girl a great deal.

865
01:33:56,466 --> 01:34:00,300
She is responsible to a great extent
for the success of the expedition.

866
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:03,839
I hope we can show you
some measure of our gratitude.

867
01:34:05,308 --> 01:34:06,570
Come in.

868
01:34:08,278 --> 01:34:09,802
Come in, Julia.

869
01:34:11,281 --> 01:34:12,839
How are you, Julia?

870
01:34:14,317 --> 01:34:17,218
-Merne, it's good to see you.
-It's good to see you, Julia.

871
01:34:17,287 --> 01:34:19,983
Julia, I want to present a visitor of ours.

872
01:34:20,056 --> 01:34:21,648
-This is--
-Janey.

873
01:34:21,758 --> 01:34:23,225
Thank you, my dear.

874
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:27,725
Janey was with them on the expedition.
Saved their lives, as a matter of fact.

875
01:34:28,531 --> 01:34:30,123
We're very grateful to you.

876
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,327
Why don't you take Janey up to your room.

877
01:34:32,402 --> 01:34:34,927
I haven't had a chance to talk to these two.

878
01:34:35,004 --> 01:34:37,802
Of course, Mr. President.
I want to thank you very much.

879
01:34:37,874 --> 01:34:41,310
You'll get your chance later,
at the reception this evening.

880
01:34:42,178 --> 01:34:43,975
Shall we go upstairs?

881
01:34:57,927 --> 01:34:58,916
Well, gentlemen?

882
01:34:58,995 --> 01:35:01,020
Before we talk, perhaps you'd like to read...

883
01:35:01,097 --> 01:35:02,860
the official record of the expedition.

884
01:35:02,932 --> 01:35:04,456
Of course, we kept daily journals.

885
01:35:04,534 --> 01:35:06,559
We have complete maps, charts,
and so forth.

886
01:35:06,636 --> 01:35:10,299
Good. I'm most anxious to.
Then we can talk, after I've read them.

887
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:11,905
Fine, sir.

888
01:35:17,714 --> 01:35:19,739
Please make yourself at home.

889
01:35:20,283 --> 01:35:22,649
I have to pick out a dress for tonight.

890
01:35:24,053 --> 01:35:26,715
Later, I want you to meet
my mother and father.

891
01:35:33,329 --> 01:35:36,492
-You live in a house like this, too?
-No.

892
01:35:37,133 --> 01:35:39,966
Compared to the White House,
we live quite simply.

893
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:47,566
Didn't I hear the President call you Janey?

894
01:35:48,711 --> 01:35:50,736
Capt. Clark gave me that name.

895
01:35:52,148 --> 01:35:54,446
He said Sacajawea was too long.

896
01:35:58,154 --> 01:36:01,521
The President said you saved his life.
What happened?

897
01:36:02,558 --> 01:36:04,583
That was a long time ago.

898
01:36:05,662 --> 01:36:07,254
I have forgotten.

899
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:27,616
Capt. Clark, he will be a chief now?

900
01:36:29,719 --> 01:36:30,811
Yes.

901
01:36:31,854 --> 01:36:33,845
I think perhaps he will.

902
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:36,558
I hope so, for his sake.

903
01:36:38,428 --> 01:36:41,158
Then he would live in a house like this.

904
01:36:43,933 --> 01:36:45,423
It's possible.

905
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:50,198
Someday, perhaps in this very house.

906
01:36:57,847 --> 01:36:59,610
These are all yours?

907
01:37:01,951 --> 01:37:04,283
I know it seems rather silly...

908
01:37:05,221 --> 01:37:08,679
but here in Washington,
we have to have a dress for every occasion.

909
01:37:13,262 --> 01:37:16,231
Don't worry. Your dress is lovely.

910
01:37:22,472 --> 01:37:25,532
Among my people,
there is not so much to learn.

911
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:29,371
A woman cooks for her man...

912
01:37:30,113 --> 01:37:32,638
works in the fields, and has the babies.

913
01:37:33,216 --> 01:37:34,615
That is all.

914
01:37:35,184 --> 01:37:37,846
I think that's quite a bit, don't you?

915
01:37:39,956 --> 01:37:42,151
Here, I think it is different.

916
01:37:44,761 --> 01:37:48,822
A little more complicated perhaps,
but not so different.

917
01:37:54,604 --> 01:37:58,096
The wife of a white man, what does she do?

918
01:38:02,745 --> 01:38:05,077
That's a little hard to explain.

919
01:38:06,282 --> 01:38:08,807
She does have certain social duties.

920
01:38:12,488 --> 01:38:14,513
But these can be easily learned.

921
01:38:17,593 --> 01:38:21,586
She runs her husband's home...

922
01:38:23,466 --> 01:38:25,457
entertains his friends...

923
01:38:27,336 --> 01:38:31,432
tries to make him happy and successful...

924
01:38:32,809 --> 01:38:34,902
and proud of being married to her.

925
01:38:40,983 --> 01:38:42,951
Most important of all...

926
01:38:44,854 --> 01:38:46,981
she must love him very much.

927
01:38:48,925 --> 01:38:50,825
But this is not enough.

928
01:38:56,732 --> 01:38:58,199
I don't know.

929
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:07,206
You see...

930
01:39:08,744 --> 01:39:10,644
I'm not married myself.

931
01:39:23,259 --> 01:39:25,022
It's very beautiful.

932
01:39:28,231 --> 01:39:30,358
Would you like to try it on?

933
01:39:33,603 --> 01:39:35,468
You love him, too, don't you?

934
01:39:42,111 --> 01:39:45,046
You like this? Please take it.

935
01:39:49,085 --> 01:39:51,918
I won't be going to the reception tonight.

936
01:40:19,315 --> 01:40:20,509
Julia.

937
01:40:26,389 --> 01:40:27,617
What's wrong?

938
01:40:28,591 --> 01:40:29,819
Nothing.

939
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,289
It's about Bill, isn't it?

940
01:40:34,297 --> 01:40:37,664
I'm sorry.
I wish there was something I could do.

941
01:40:39,302 --> 01:40:41,429
Don't be angry with him, Merne.

942
01:40:43,806 --> 01:40:46,468
If anything happened between you two, I....

943
01:40:47,443 --> 01:40:50,640
I'm proud of you both,
what you've done together.

944
01:40:51,614 --> 01:40:53,809
I don't want anything to spoil that.

945
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:59,715
If you'll excuse me, Julia...

946
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:02,280
the President is waiting for these records.

947
01:41:22,545 --> 01:41:23,773
Come in.

948
01:41:26,582 --> 01:41:29,881
The President would like to see you
in his study, Captain.

949
01:41:31,187 --> 01:41:34,054
Do you know if he's read
Capt. Lewis' report, sir?

950
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:36,381
I believe he has.

951
01:41:36,859 --> 01:41:39,089
Capt. Lewis is already there.

952
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:40,992
They are waiting for you.

953
01:41:51,507 --> 01:41:53,031
After you, sir.

954
01:42:02,985 --> 01:42:04,213
Come in.

955
01:42:11,761 --> 01:42:14,195
I've just finished reading Lewis' report.

956
01:42:14,263 --> 01:42:18,461
I don't know how you feel about it,
but I think it's very clear and objective.

957
01:42:18,534 --> 01:42:19,592
Yes, sir.

958
01:42:19,669 --> 01:42:22,536
Anything you'd care to add
from your own viewpoint?

959
01:42:24,507 --> 01:42:25,531
No, sir.

960
01:42:25,608 --> 01:42:27,974
I can assume, then, that these are the facts.

961
01:42:28,044 --> 01:42:29,306
Yes, sir.

962
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:38,010
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I have to say goodbye to someone.

963
01:42:38,521 --> 01:42:41,217
I'm curious about one thing, Lewis.

964
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:44,115
You were so meticulous
about everything else.

965
01:42:44,193 --> 01:42:47,560
Toward the end of your report,
there are five pages missing.

966
01:42:47,797 --> 01:42:50,322
Yes, something happened
to those pages, sir.

967
01:42:50,666 --> 01:42:52,395
I can't explain it.

968
01:42:52,768 --> 01:42:56,101
Perhaps if you gave it some thought,
you could reconstruct them.

969
01:42:56,172 --> 01:42:58,072
I have thought about it, sir.

970
01:42:58,174 --> 01:43:01,041
I find that I have completely forgotten
the incident.

971
01:43:02,278 --> 01:43:04,838
In any case,
I want to congratulate you both.

972
01:43:05,014 --> 01:43:07,812
And I want to thank you with all my heart.

973
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:13,152
Please ask the guests to come in.
I'll be back at once.

974
01:43:13,222 --> 01:43:14,484
Yes, sir.

975
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:28,201
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President would like you to come in.

976
01:43:43,519 --> 01:43:45,180
I wonder where Janey is.

977
01:43:48,491 --> 01:43:50,584
Mrs. Hancock, have you seen Julia?

978
01:43:50,659 --> 01:43:53,958
No, she hasn't come down yet.
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.

979
01:43:54,063 --> 01:43:55,291
Martha.

980
01:43:55,631 --> 01:43:57,929
I think I'll go upstairs and find out.

981
01:44:16,952 --> 01:44:19,318
What's the matter? Where's Janey?

982
01:44:20,055 --> 01:44:22,546
-She's gone, Bill.
-Gone where?

983
01:44:28,431 --> 01:44:31,025
I wrote it all down just the way she told me.

984
01:44:36,772 --> 01:44:41,641
''When you hear this,
I will be on my way back to my people.

985
01:44:43,946 --> 01:44:47,882
''I have talked with his chief,
and he is going to help me.

986
01:44:48,617 --> 01:44:51,051
''He is a good man, and he is very wise.''

987
01:44:51,287 --> 01:44:53,778
-The President had no right.
-Bill, please.

988
01:44:59,261 --> 01:45:01,229
''Words do not come easy.

989
01:45:02,198 --> 01:45:04,598
''I only know what is in my heart.

990
01:45:05,401 --> 01:45:09,235
''I have seen your country now,
and I have met your people.

991
01:45:10,673 --> 01:45:12,800
''They were very kind to me.

992
01:45:14,977 --> 01:45:19,107
''But it is not my country,
and they are not my people.

993
01:45:22,751 --> 01:45:24,742
''I am proud of what I am.

994
01:45:25,421 --> 01:45:27,912
''I do not want to try to be something else.

995
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,150
''If I did, I would fail.

996
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:37,827
''I would fail you,
but I would also fail myself...

997
01:45:38,701 --> 01:45:40,828
''and all my people.

998
01:45:41,437 --> 01:45:44,065
''Many women grow old and die...

999
01:45:47,710 --> 01:45:50,440
''and never know the happiness I have had.

1000
01:45:52,548 --> 01:45:56,109
''For this, I will always be grateful.

1001
01:45:58,687 --> 01:46:03,124
''Now there are others
who love and need you...

1002
01:46:06,362 --> 01:46:10,059
<i>''as you will need them</i>
<i>in the years that lie ahead. ''</i>

1003
01:46:13,035 --> 01:46:16,027
<i>There is much we both can do</i>
<i>for our people.</i>

1004
01:46:17,773 --> 01:46:21,766
<i>Many things we have learned</i>
<i>from each other we can teach to them.</i>

1005
01:46:23,546 --> 01:46:26,379
<i>Patience, kindness...</i>

1006
01:46:27,483 --> 01:46:29,883
<i>and the wisdom to know the truth.</i>

1007
01:46:32,187 --> 01:46:35,213
<i>You would not have let me</i>
<i>say these things to you...</i>

1008
01:46:36,025 --> 01:46:39,085
<i>but in your heart,</i>
<i>you will know they are true.</i>

1009
01:46:41,864 --> 01:46:46,062
<i>You will be sad, as I am sad.</i>

1010
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:49,863
<i>And you will think of me...</i>

1011
01:46:50,539 --> 01:46:54,339
<i>as I will think of you</i>
<i>many times in the years to come...</i>

1012
01:46:57,513 --> 01:47:01,415
<i>when you see a river of white water</i>
<i>dancing in the sun...</i>

1013
01:47:02,618 --> 01:47:05,587
<i>or clouds hanging high above the mountains.</i>

1014
01:47:08,724 --> 01:47:13,286
<i>But soon the memories will grow dim,</i>
<i>as memories should...</i>

1015
01:47:15,431 --> 01:47:18,366
<i>and there will be others to take their place.</i>

1016
01:47:21,136 --> 01:47:25,766
<i>May they be happy ones for you, my love...</i>

1017
01:47:27,576 --> 01:47:30,443
<i>as happy as those we shared together...</i>

1018
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,905
<i>all the days of your life.</i>
