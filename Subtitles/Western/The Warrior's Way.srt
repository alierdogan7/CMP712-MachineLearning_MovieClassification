1
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,893
[Male narrator] Okay.
Settle down.

2
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,724
Got your ears open?

3
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:32,353
[Clears throat]

4
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:35,565
This is the story of a sad flute

5
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:38,526
a laughin' baby
and a weepin' sword.

6
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:52,081
A long, long time ago
in a land far, far away,

7
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,792
there lived a warrior...

8
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,503
warrior with empty eyes.

9
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:37,027
He'd trained his entire life
for one purpose.

10
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:43,484
To be the greatest swordsman
in the history of mankind.

11
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:31,577
He'd just achieved
his life's ambition,

12
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:34,375
but his heart felt emptier
than ever.

13
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:41,542
These two clans had been warrin'
for 500 years.

14
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:44,595
And they vowed to keep on warrin'
until one of them

15
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,093
didn't have a single man
left above Styx.

16
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:01,733
[Giggles]

17
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,491
[coos, cries]

18
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:17,998
[coos, giggles]

19
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,876
And so now, here he was,

20
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,925
peerin' down
at this very last of his enemy.

21
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,751
[Baby coos, laughs]

22
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:36,476
When that
little warrior princess giggled,

23
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:38,648
it did somethin' to him inside.

24
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:42,853
But this was no time for feelin'.

25
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:15,014
For when spared that baby's life,

26
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:19,064
he put his name at the top
of his own clan's death list.

27
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:23,787
With nothin' but the clothes on his back
and the baby in his arms,

28
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:29,218
he decided to pay a visit to an old
warrior friend in a faraway land.

29
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,016
Hey, Johnny.

30
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,357
I don't like your stinkin' face.

31
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,436
Easy, Ronald.

32
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,114
The name's Eight-Ball.
Like in the game.

33
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,442
Good luck for some,
bad luck for others.

34
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:20,154
How can I assist you,
my friend from the mystical East?

35
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:25,454
Uh-oh.

36
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,215
Haven't been here
since Smiley kicked the bucket.

37
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:36,632
Was a 3-day wait
just to get your shirts pressed.

38
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,051
[Laughs]

39
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:46,388
For a guy who cleaned sheets all day,
he sure liked to make a mess

40
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,974
in the after-hours,
if you know what I mean.

41
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:51,984
See you in the morning.

42
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:14,003
[Man] You came to me
to be strong.

43
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,388
I have made you the strongest.

44
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:28,014
She will always be the enemy.

45
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,202

[bellows]

47
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,240
Here it is.

48
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:23,364
Just rub some on your shoulder.

49
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:27,281
Smiley's Oriental cure-all.
Works like a charm.

50
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,410
[Crying]

51
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,241
Now, honey,
I didn't forget about you.

52
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:35,547
It's alright there. It's okay.
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

53
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:39,923
Sorry about the tap I gave ya.
I thought you knew the sword.

54
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:45,007
Smiley was always yabberin' on about
a guy who was gonna roll into town.

55
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:49,686
But I shoulda figgered.
What do you call her?

56
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:51,388
I do not know.

57
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:53,815
Oh. She's not yours?

58
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:55,984
Where's her folks?

59
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:58,062
Dead.

60
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:11,537
Oo-ee, best we find you
another diaper.

61
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:12,868
Alright.

62
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:17,505
Smiley like
your uncle or something?

63
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:19,332
Friend.

64
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:22,715
Well, if you were his friend,
maybe he would like for you

65
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,087
to take over his laundry.

66
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:27,925
-- Do not know how.
-- So I'll teach ya.

67
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,975
I always done the laundry
around here.

68
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:32,520
That's how I repaid Smiley
for teaching me the sword.

69
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:35,314
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

70
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:38,610
You stay here, I'll teach you how
to tie a diaper properly.

71
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,939
We'll be partners, 60:40.
You are the 40.

72
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,237
Alright now,
time to get to work.

73
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,907
Dang, you're slower
than molasses in January.

74

[Fly buzzing]

75
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:20,985
You clean that real good,
yellow boy.

76
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:23,233
As clean
as Snow White's panties--

77
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:28,318
If I find the smallest bit
of condor crap on my fancy duds...

78

-- Well, we gonna have us--
-- [crunch]

79
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:36,079
Didn't I tell you I'd rip 'em off
if you don't watch yourself?

80
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,206
Let go, evil midget!

81
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,629
Come on, Eight-Ball,
we were just havin' us some fun.

82
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,957
-- Really?
-- Ah! [Grunts]

83
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:45,543

Let go.

-- Get outta here!

How 'bout a home-cooked meal
for you and your little 'un?

86
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:03,903
Once that Ferris wheel is finished,
it's gonna bring everybody rushin' back,

87
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,528
And then we can take the word
"travelling" out of "travelling circus."

No thanks.

you walked into this--

[Singing continues]

107
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,832
You ever seen
one of these before?

108
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:10,002
The sound it's makin'?
It's called "opera."

109
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:13,677
Day my poppa found his first chunk
of gold,

110
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:16,137
he went out and bought this thing.

111

Listen.
Here's my favorite part.

112
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:04,098
[Narrator] So at the edge of the desert,
in a busted town full of broken people,

113
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:10,058
the warrior began to learn stuff
he shoulda learned a long time ago.

114
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:12,064
[Squishing]

115
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:23,988
No, no! Rough!

116
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:29,285
Like the joy
of gettin' dirty things clean.

117
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,505
[Laughs]

118
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,675

Woo hoo! That's me!
[Laughs] Thank you!

120
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:53,188
I told you to aim at the line,
not at the coin!

All right! [Laughs]

122
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:57,484
He also learned the joy of losing.

123
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:00,908
You're gonna need blood and bone of
about 100 dead buffaloes as fertilizer.

124
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,281
Smiley always tried
to get something to grow.

125
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:05,033
Never, ever lasted too long.

126
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:13,205
He learned you could be happy
workin' with folks.

127
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:18,843
And findin' the simple peace
in some private time

128
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,342
after a hard day's work.

to have a few friends around

135
00:18:57,635 --> 00:18:59,546
when the sun goes down.

136
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:11,104
But most of all, the warrior learned
there's a heck of a lot more pleasure

137
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,274
makin' things grow
than there is in cuttin' 'em down.

when we went to bury her,

she was still breathing.

that close to kickin' it.

165

We didn't know what to do wit' her,
if'n she was gonna live or die.

166
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:57,757
So we just put her in bed
and waited.

167
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:00,685
Two days,
and she was eating soup.

168
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:03,854
By the day three, she was already
sitting up somehow

169
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,977
and slinging daggers
at the wall.

170

Do not talk. Focus.

181
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:13,924
It is your heart that shakes.

189
00:26:22,454 --> 00:26:24,410
Smiley told me everything.

190
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:26,534
I just taught you to focus.

191
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:41,219
Why you do that?

192
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:27,717
Okay.
I've always been dyin' to know.

193
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,767
Why are y'all called
The Sad Flutes?

194
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:37,852
So you got lady Sad Flutes,

as you both fly under the stars
to the tunes of The Sad Flutes--

200
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:00,675
We are called Sad Flutes
because when you cut the throat,

201
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:04,128
the last sound is like a sad flute.

202
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:07,385
Dang!

203
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:11,640
Skinny, sure know how to throw
a dead cat into a party room, don't ya?

204
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:19,355
Why'd you become a Sad Flute?

205
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:24,982
To be strong.

206
00:28:25,077 --> 00:28:26,283
That it?

207
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:36,160
My father was working in the field.

208
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:37,745
I was helping him.

209
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:42,709
A swordsman came.

210
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:44,384
Killed my father.

211
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:47,713
Just to test his sword.

212
00:28:49,643 --> 00:28:51,884
That musta hurt you
somethin' bad.

213
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:56,018
Not hurt. Angry.

214
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:58,224
Course.

215
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:00,229
No.

216
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,279
I was angry at my father.

217
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:24,633
Here. Take it.

218
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,713
It's a present.
My momma gave it to me.

219
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:33,597
She said, "If you hold it
over your heart when you're sad,

220
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:35,928
it takes away all your sadness."

221
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:40,232
It works.

222
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,775
Kinda.

223
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,775

Yes, master.

231

Oh, tarnations.

232
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:28,856
Only to protect,
not kill.

233
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:31,112
What am I gonna kill in this town,
an armadillo?

234
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,741
Is that what I think it is?

235
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:53,968
You've sealed it.

236
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,300
So they cannot hear.

237
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:58,602
Hear what?

238
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,054
The weeping.

239
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,938
Of all the souls I have taken.

240
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:10,606

And if it hears?

243
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,911
No more music.

244
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:33,295
This is a big country.
Where do we look?

245
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,301
Do not look.

246
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:41,137

248
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:23,554
Think of the sword
as part of the body.

249

Like a tooth.

250
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,399
Rather think of it like metal
slicin' through a herd of buffalo!

251

Show me what Smiley taught you.

252
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,751
You do not have the power.

253

I did not know that.

254

00:46:27,074 --> 00:46:28,484
What?

361
00:46:28,576 --> 00:46:30,988
Find that funny?

362
00:46:31,078 --> 00:46:32,864
Or is it because of this?

363
00:46:32,955 --> 00:46:35,492
[Door opens]

364
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:40,076
Thank you, gentlemen.

365
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:43,459
This girl says she'll serve herself
up to you instead of the spics.

366
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:49,335
Have we, uh, met before?

367
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,638
No. We haven't.

368
00:46:52,725 --> 00:46:57,185
This is bound to be a night
you will never forget.

369
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:08,153
You have good teeth.

370
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:10,857
I like that.

371
00:47:10,952 --> 00:47:14,615
Colonel, as you unwrap me,

372
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:17,993
I'm sure you will find there's
a whole lot more of me to like.

373
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:20,541
I have no doubt of that.

374
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,209
And though I may be young,

375
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:25,288
I was hopin' you could teach me
a thing or two.

376
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:27,669
Life's best lessons tend to hurt.

377
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,469
Sharp pain
can bring sharp pleasure.

378
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:39,765
Tell them to get.
This ain't the theatre.

379
00:47:41,649 --> 00:47:44,937
Gentlemen, you heard the lady.
Make yourselves scarce.

380
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:49,942
[Door closes]

381
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:03,994
Lynne!

382
00:48:06,048 --> 00:48:07,333
She's not here!

383
00:48:22,023 --> 00:48:27,017
Now I, I might say
some things during.

384
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:31,150
Feel free to answer if you like.

385
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:36,409
Nothing is too wrong.

386
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,827
I've been waitin' my whole life
for a place

387
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,624
where it's right to be wrong.

388
00:48:43,711 --> 00:48:44,917
[Grunts]

389
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:55,800
You know, I don't think any part
of the body is dirty or bad.

390
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,428
Just as long as it's well-scrubbed

391
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:03,886
Yes.

392
00:49:37,014 --> 00:49:38,345
Assemble.

393
00:49:38,432 --> 00:49:39,888
Now.

394
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:47,931
Now where do you plan
to begin the inspection?

395
00:49:48,025 --> 00:49:51,768
[Water splashing]
I like where the skin creases...

396
00:49:51,862 --> 00:49:53,477
Go on.

397
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:56,735
Between your nice... big...

398
00:50:00,162 --> 00:50:03,620
Moment I smelt your neck...

399
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:06,871
it all came flooding back.

400
00:50:06,961 --> 00:50:11,250
No girl could ever smell as sweet.

401
00:50:13,676 --> 00:50:18,340
You changed it all.
My world.

402
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:21,298
My face.

403
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:24,759
You changed my life,
little girl.

404
00:50:26,981 --> 00:50:29,643
And now I'm--
I'm going to change yours.

405
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:40,612
[Grunting]

406
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:51,377
That certainly is a beautiful scar
I gave you.

407
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,339
[Grunts] A hard-on for a scar.

408
00:50:58,429 --> 00:51:01,546
[Chuckles]
Now that is wrong.

409
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,596
Oops.

410
00:51:03,684 --> 00:51:05,800
I forgot.

411
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:08,136
Nothing tonight is wrong.

412
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,141
[Grunting]

413
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:21,407
Tell the cook
to fry up some potatoes

414
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:23,155
[chuckles]

415
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,747
And while we're waiting,
I thought I should give you

416
00:51:31,837 --> 00:51:37,377
what I was so generously offering
ten years ago.

417
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:41,593
Enjoy the show.

418
00:51:57,154 --> 00:51:58,894
No! He's mine.

419
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:21,091
-- Lynne...
-- Are you all right?

420
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:27,006
Cover me!

421
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:29,763
Hold on!

422
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:32,057
Lynne!

423
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:03,963
Agh!

424
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,773
[Indistinct murmuring]

425
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,531
[man] Pull it off.

426
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:30,407
-- She got the wrong guy.
-- That ain't him.

427
00:53:30,497 --> 00:53:32,488
[Woman] Oh, God help us.

428
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:35,199
Merry Christmas!
[Laughs]

429
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:38,912
Sweet mother of God,
it's a goddamn butcher shop in here!

430
00:53:39,006 --> 00:53:40,712
[Indistinct murmuring]

431
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:46,274
I must go
or you will all be in danger.

432
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:48,947
[Eight-Ball]
We're in danger already.

433
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:50,820
Colonel's on the loose.

434
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:53,618
That's right.
Lynne here smoked the wrong guy.

435
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:56,698
Now the Colonel's coming back,
and he's bringing the whole damn family.

436
00:54:56,792 --> 00:55:00,000
We need the guy who did
that butcher job in the saloon.

437
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:02,624
Well, I say
we all just pack up and leave.

438
00:55:02,715 --> 00:55:05,127
He's right! If you stay and fight,
you'll die like rats.

439
00:55:05,217 --> 00:55:07,378
Well,
we'll die like rats with rifles.

440
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:08,925
What rifles?

441
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:11,629
You got a Chink with a sword
and a buncha juggling idiots.

442
00:55:11,724 --> 00:55:15,262
-- How dare you?!
-- That ain't all we got.

443
00:55:16,979 --> 00:55:18,935
Hey!

444
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:21,059
Beth will understand.

445
00:55:25,863 --> 00:55:27,319
Follow me.

446
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,758
I ruined everything.
Didn't I?

447
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:56,632
You did what you had to do.

448
00:55:59,897 --> 00:56:03,685
You coulda just grabbed April
and hit the trail.

449
00:56:03,776 --> 00:56:05,812
But you didn't.

450
00:56:05,903 --> 00:56:10,488
Knowing saving me would ruin
every new thing you found here.

451
00:56:13,118 --> 00:56:17,578
This New World, without you...

452
00:56:17,664 --> 00:56:19,950
not so new.

453
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:30,337
Hey, let's say somehow they all come
and go and we're still breathin'.

454
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,671
You're still gonna leave, right?

455
00:56:38,227 --> 00:56:39,967
That is the plan.

456
00:56:42,189 --> 00:56:44,521
Um...

457
00:56:44,608 --> 00:56:47,395
Maybe I could go with you?

458
00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:54,072
Just think about it, alright?

459
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:48,873
Hey!

460
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:51,421
That's my primo cactus juice!

461
00:57:51,508 --> 00:57:53,590
[Laughter]

462
00:58:21,038 --> 00:58:24,781
Yee-haw! Whoo!

463
00:58:29,671 --> 00:58:32,162
I knew what you was
from the get-go.

464
00:58:32,257 --> 00:58:35,420
Don't need to look
at the size of a man.

465
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:37,843
I can smell the blood.

466
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,012
It was on you, too.

467
00:58:42,643 --> 00:58:43,928
Yeah.

468
00:58:48,232 --> 00:58:49,642
Good.

469
00:58:49,733 --> 00:58:52,395
Now,
get my jacket clean if you can.

470
00:58:52,486 --> 00:58:55,603
If I'm gonna die,
I want to look good doing it.

471
00:58:55,697 --> 00:58:57,403
Why die?

472
00:58:57,491 --> 00:59:00,324
'Cause we only got about a hundred
sticks of dynamite and a few weapons.

473
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:04,198
That ain't much more
'n to sting them with.

474
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:06,371
You also have that.

475
00:59:28,063 --> 00:59:32,773
Done a good job on this garden.
Well, for a laundry man.

476
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:38,149
You do a good shooting.

477
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,232
-- For a drunken man.
-- [Chuckles]

478
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:42,987
Why you stopped the shooting?

479
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:48,869
Well, I just went around
robbing banks, hitting trains

480
00:59:48,959 --> 00:59:54,579
till I ran into the only force
that can truly bring down any outlaw.

481
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:56,664
Sheriff?

482
00:59:56,758 --> 00:59:59,340
[Grunts] Woman.

483
01:00:01,388 --> 01:00:03,970
When I was with her,
I didn't wanna run.

484
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:09,392
What happened then?

485
01:00:09,479 --> 01:00:13,222
There was a couple of Rangers
who hadn't forgot about me.

486
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:18,607
They ambushed me.

487
01:00:18,697 --> 01:00:20,688
Bullets flyin' everywhere.

488
01:00:22,576 --> 01:00:24,316
One of 'em found Beth.

489
01:00:26,163 --> 01:00:31,248
Last thing she ever said to me was,
"Don't never pick up no gun again."

490
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:35,248
So far...

491
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:38,046
Well, at least till today...

492
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:40,124
I done what she asked.

493
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:47,514
But for fellas like me and you,
we are what we are.

494
01:00:50,103 --> 01:00:55,348
If you truly love somethin'
or somebody, Laundry Man...

495
01:00:55,442 --> 01:00:59,355
you get as far away
from 'em as possible.

496
01:00:59,446 --> 01:01:03,280
'Cause we're sand.

497
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:07,150

These are yours.

500
01:01:32,062 --> 01:01:34,018
These are to kill.

501
01:01:45,283 --> 01:01:46,568
Come.

502
01:01:50,747 --> 01:01:52,783
Closer.

Here.

Remember these places.

507
01:02:26,158 --> 01:02:28,615
Fastest way to kill your enemy.

508
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:56,594
I will remember.

her father and her entire clan?

for an assassin

but the heart of a priest.

Keep walkin'.

The warrior walked away.

623
01:29:32,616 --> 01:29:35,323
And legend has it,
he never stopped walkin',

624
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:40,370
always making sure to keep
as much distance as possible

625
01:29:40,457 --> 01:29:45,451
between himself
and the little gal he loved.
