Well, that's about it.

00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,994
That's about it for this Independence
Day as the clock rocks 12:00,

5
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:38,331
ladies and gentlemen,
on July 5th, 1996.

6
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:43,836
And you know, fellow Americans,
we are now 220 years old.

7
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:46,047
We've just about, of course,
wiped out the ozone layer.

8
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:50,260
Uh-huh, we live under
a continual first-stage smog alert,

9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,720
and there's a brand-new drug--
I don't know if you heard this by now.

10
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:54,264
Check this out.
You ready for this?

11
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:56,474
There's a new drug out there
for the kids of America

12
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,850
to bury themselves with.

13
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,853
It's called Crystal Dream.
Can you believe it?

14
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,439
Now listen to this.
You don't drink it. You don't smoke it.

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,275
You don't snort it.
And you don't shoot it.

16
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:08,027
What do you do? I know you're asking.
What do you do with this thing?

17
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,405
Well, what you do
is you put it in your eyes,

18
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:13,074
and apparently it tells you lies,
all right?

19
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,325
I'll tell you,
all this decadence,

20
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:16,536
and we still haven't
nuked ourselves outta here.

21
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:17,745
It's amazing.

22
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,706
With a little luck
and a whole lot of hope,

23
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:23,167
I think maybe the human race might live
to see another 220 years.

24
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:24,794
And with that in mind...

87

there's five rules
when shooting a game of pool for cash.

Lesson number one.

89
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:06,302
Always shoot
with a cigarette hanging in your mouth.

90
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,138
Can't smoke with no fire, asshole.

91

Always know the table
before you shoot.

94
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,241
Lesson number three.

95
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:32,703
Make sure you chalk that stick

96
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,873
real good before each shot.

97

If you lose...

102
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,659
stand up straight and tall--

on my own terms.

00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,144
Who's trying to strong-arm you?

350
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:39,521
The bank.

351
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,566
What bank?

352
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,610
Great Trust.

353
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,032
Oh, the suits?

354
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,701
Mm-hmm.

355
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,080
Well...

356
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:02,335
there's only one place
to get that kind of money so fast.

357
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,213
No suit's gonna loan us $2.5 million.

358
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,589
Man:
That's for sure.

359
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,467
Hey, man,
I ain't talking about no loan.

360
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,472
I don't wanna hear it, Harley.

361
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,307
Hear what?

362
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:17,851
You don't wanna know.

363
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,436
Know what?

364
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,397
He's gonna say
we should rob the bank.

365
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,150
We ain't gonna rob
any damn bank.

366
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,985
We ain't bank robbers.

367
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,279
We owe it to the old man.

368
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,156
We grew up in this place.

369
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,575
You boys don't owe me anything.

370
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:36,369
Harley:
Sure, we do.

371
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:40,331
Hell, if it wasn't for you,
we'd all be face-down in the gutter

372
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,001
with a cigarette for company
and a...

373
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,087
a needle for good times.

374
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,178
I'm ready to go.

375
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,264
- Okay baby, in a minute.
- Now!

376
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:04,439
Count me out of this one.

377
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,608
I made a promise to Lulu.

378
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,154
Yeah, you've made me
a lot of promises, Jack.

379
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:14,074
We're gonna have a baby someday.

380
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,743
Can't start a family
from behind bars.

381
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,416
You know...

382
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,711
I really love this place.

383
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,214
It's home.

384
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:30,840
Makes me feel good.

385
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:35,970
And if we gotta rob a bank to save it...

386
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,890
I'll do that.

387
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,226
But I can't do it alone.

388
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,729
You guys are gonna
have to get it up, too.

389
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,552
( Chuckles )

390
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,176
Man: (on radio)
12 minutes, Pacific and California.

391
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,261
We'll check with you then.
Over.

392
00:27:58,511 --> 00:27:59,762
Roger, Dispatch.

393
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,144
We copy.

394
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,774
Whoa, shit!

395
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,446
Car 3, car 3, this is Dispatch.

396
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,241
Give me your 10-20
and security code, over.

397
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,117
Man:
Dispatch, we're at the shipyard.

398
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:10,124
What's with this hard hat?

399
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,711
( Horn honking )

400
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,681
You're gonna have to move your
equipment. I got a delivery to make.

401
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,727
What, are re you fucking deaf?
I said you're gonna have to move your--

402
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:31,354
I heard what you said.

403
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,358
Drop your gun.

404
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,860
You're not gonna like
what you're getting into, pal.

405
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:41,990
Harley: Hey, friend, from 15 feet away,
there's a chance you could miss me.

406
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,450
I could be blind as a bat
and still blow your head off.

407
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:47,245
- So you drop it.
- No, you drop it, asshole.

408
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,791
- Shit!
- Think fast.

409
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,299
Shit.

410
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,136
Come on.
Get over here. Sit down.

411
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,975
Guns are made to be shot, Harley,
not thrown.

412
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,019
Harley: Go do it, Jose.

413
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,230
You're about the deadest shot
I've ever seen.

414
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,898
Where'd you learn to do that?

415
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,484
Read a book.
Came with the gun.

416
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,111
Who are you guys?

417
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:22,488
Well, he's Harley Davidson.

418
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,116
And I'm the Marlboro man.

419
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,660
You look like a bunch
of two-bit hoods to me.

420
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,587
Now does that look like the work
of two-bit hoods?

421
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,631
Yeah.
Pros would have used my keys.

422
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,886
Well, he likes to blow things up.

423
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,929
Hot stuff.
Watch it.

424
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,931
Nice day for work, huh, Jimmy?

425
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:51,517
Ha, none better ever.
None better ever, homes.

426
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,570
Nice doing business with you boys.

427
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,531
Your business isn't with us.
It's with them.

428
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,554
Well, whatever they've got to say,
I don't wanna hear it.

429
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:32,600
Let's rock it!
We got company.

430
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,893
Shit, no.

431
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:45,029
What the fuck is all this about?!

432
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,789
Hey, Harley, why don't you
throw that shotgun at 'em?

433
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,290
Maybe you'll hit something.

434
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:07,343
- I thought you was a dead shot.
- So did I.

435
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,720
Then why the fuck ain't they dropping?

436
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,681
Beats the shit outta me.

437
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,605
( Bellows )

438
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:37,540
Come on, guys!

439
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,761
- Come on, Harley.
- Let's go, Jimmy!

440
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,541
( Cheering )

441
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,839
Yee-ha! ( laughs )

442
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,342
Jimmy: All right,
you're a big fucking hero, big man!

443
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:31,010
A big fucking hero!

444
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,512
You guys needed backup!

445
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:34,347
I had nothing to do
and no one to do it with.

446
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:35,765
Shit, backup, hell.

447
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:39,268
Old Harley's thinking here
damn near had us on the ropes.

448
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,187
Saved our lives, big boy.

449
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:44,440
You guys owe me a bike.
I gotta get a new bike.

450
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,484
Hey, man, you'll get a new bike.

451
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,694
Promise me you won't tell Lulu.

452
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,531
I don't want her getting mad.
She's mean when she's mad.

453
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:55,159
Hey, look, I can take care of the bike,
but I can't take care of the bitch.

454
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,161
Why not?
You did once.

455
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,497
You boy might wanna
take a look at this shit.

456
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:06,921
What is it?

457
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,965
Un-melted pure Crystal Dream.

458
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:12,134
Well, what the fuck is that,
and what the fuck is it doing here?

459
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:15,137
It's a drug, and I don't know
what the fuck it's doing here.

460
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,474
I'm a son of a bitch.

461
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,142
We jumped the wrong train.

462
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,477
Oh, fuck!

463
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:22,770
Shit, man.

464
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,358
His little brother OD'ed
using this shit.

465
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:30,903
Don't worry, Hose,
we ain't drug dealers.

466
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,450
This is not a walk in the park, Harley.

467
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,077
This is way fucking
out there on the edge.

468
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,870
These guys aren't street dealers
dealing grass and pills.

469
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,080
They're killers.

470
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,623
They killed their own men
trying to waste us.

471
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,000
That's enough, Jimmy.

472
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,129
Never liked this plan from the start.

473
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:50,047
But you needed help,
and you took it.

474
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:52,800
So don't whine about it now.

475
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:57,013
What's done is done.
There ain't no turning back.

476
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,975
Man:
Who are these men?

477
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:05,605
Judging from their ability and data
we gathered, they're dilettantes.

478
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:10,318
Details would suggest that they were
not aware of the cargo they've stolen.

479
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,361
( Sighs )

480
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,582
If they're amateurs,
how'd they destroy two vehicles...

481
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:28,502
and then manage
to get away with the goods?

482
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:32,173
- Hmm?
- They were extremely lucky.

483
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:33,966
( laughs )

484
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,218
Mm.

485
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:41,390
I don't have time for luck,
now do I?

486
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,643
Get back what's mine.

487
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:48,064
And kill these men,
Alexander, okay?

488
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,485
(Lulu singing)
 ♪ Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe. ♪ 

489
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:57,907
 ♪ Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah ♪ 

490
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,784
 ♪ Whoo... ♪ 

491
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,792
Oh, man, we really fucked up big.

492
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,130
Marlboro, how the fuck
was I supposed to know

493
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:16,926
somebody's using a bank
as a front to run drugs?

494
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:20,971
Harley, I'm tired and I'm pissed.

495
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,558
And I'd just like to unwind.

496
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,437
So stop thinking.

497
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:32,149
Oh, fuck, man, now I gotta think
of some way to make things right.

498
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,280
- Hi.
- Hey.

499
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,951
I know you don't know me,
but I don't have a way home,

500
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,745
and Jimmy said
that you'd give me a ride.

501
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:49,125
Sure, I'll give you a ride, Sally.

502
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:53,879
Oh, the name tag's wrong.
My real name's Honey.

503
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:59,218
Pure gold
and sweet.

504
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,763
I'm off at 10:00.

505
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:10,354
Well, my old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

506
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,982
the right woman can make you,
and the wrong one can break you.

507
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,526
You know,
I woke up one morning...

508
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,197
and she was gone.

509
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:26,412
No note. No kiss goodbye.
No nothing.

510
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,123
And I still have feelings
for her deep inside.

511
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,169
Well, partner...

512
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:38,674
I only know of two cures
for that particular ailment.

513
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:42,720
And since you don't drink anymore,
you're down to one.

514
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,640
Let me borrow your bike.

515
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:49,393
I gotta take Sally home.

516
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,061
Get a cab.

517
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:10,706
(siren wailing )

518
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:04,927
( siren strops )

519
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,514
Stand up and put your hands
behind your head.

520
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,687
Ah, hell, I was just blowing off
a little steam.

521
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:16,772
Yeah?
Well, You blew in the wrong place.

522
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,816
Now kiss the wall and spread 'em.

523
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:42,298
Okay, cowboy,
let's blow off some steam.

524
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:48,888
What's wrong tonight?

525
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,058
I'm getting married.

526
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,731
God damn you, Robert,
I'm tired of waiting around

527
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:01,358
for you to come by
when you feel the need.

528
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:02,610
I get lonely.

529
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,945
I like to share my bed
with someone at night.

530
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,038
Hell, isn't that what we're doing?

531
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,959
One, maybe two nights a month,
if I'm lucky.

532
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,922
Well, I am what I am, Virginia.

533
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:27,968
I've accepted that, even loved it.
But I don't have to like it.

534
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:33,474
I get scared for you.
I worry.

535
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:35,225
You could spend the rest of your life

536
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:38,228
looking for whatever the hell
it is you're looking for,

537
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:41,231
but someday you're gonna
have to find yourself.

538
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:43,984
I just can't wait
for you to do it anymore.

539
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,032
I love you, Robert.

540
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:55,162
But after tonight,
you're not welcome here anymore.

That's for Marlboro.

Me and you'll go out
and have something to eat.

551
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,925
You're a bad man, Harley.

552
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,472
What are you two up to this time?

553
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:04,356
Do you know anything
about this new drug, Crystal Dream?

554
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:09,445
It's 100% addictive and kills
one out of every seven users.

555
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,196
Don't mess with it, Harley.

556
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:13,449
I don't mess with drugs no more,
you know that.

557
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,497
It's a liquid-based blue crystalline
substance

558
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:24,668
with a neurotoxin RAH--
retina-activating hallucinogen.

559
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:30,549
Hmm, so it sort of numbs the senses
and makes the world look better?

560
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,259
Yeah, that's the high.

561
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:34,344
The low is it damages
the central nervous system,

562
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,472
causes insanity and then death.

563
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,515
On the street it's called "The Dream."

564
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:40,434
Thank you.

565
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:49,193
Hey, I'm broke.

566
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:08,587
You know something, Harley?
In a weird way I'm jealous of you two.

567
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:12,216
( Engine starts )

568
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:14,009
But why's that?

569
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:18,138
The rest of us work
so damn hard at life, and...

570
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,224
you guys just live it
one day at a time.

571
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:24,978
Yeah.

572
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:26,438
See ya.

573
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,171
Hey, what's with you
and them boots?

574
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:56,927
Lay off my boots, Harley.
I'm in no fucking mood.

575
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:59,930
Did you have a rough night?

576
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,724
Woke up smelling the coffee.
Gimme a light.

577
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,518
Hey, I thought you quit.

578
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:06,019
Just give me a light.

579
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:18,657
Whose bike?

580
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:20,075
Probably hers.

581
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:23,245
She ain't got no Harley.

582
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:31,044
Hey, man, what're you doing?

583
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:35,382
It ain't hers,
but I'll bet I know whose it is.

584
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:36,800
Whose?

585
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,385
His.

586
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:42,639
You gotta cross and cut
the red and the green wire.

587
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,683
I know how to hot-wire a bike, Harley.

588
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:48,562
Don't tell me how to hot-wire
a God damn bike.

589
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:50,731
( Engine cranking )

590
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:53,525
You gotta turn on the gas.

591
00:44:58,322 --> 00:44:59,781
( Engine starts )

592
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:05,287
if he's gonna take my girl,
I'm gonna take his bike.

593
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,391
You sure this is the right bank?

594
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:28,393
Yeah, I'm sure.

595
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:29,770
How sure?

596
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,439
Hey, man, I'm real sure.

597
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:35,108
Yeah, well, you were real sure
there was gonna be money

598
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,361
on that armored truck.

599
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:40,405
You were real sure
this plan was gonna work.

600
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:42,950
You better be right about this,
or I'm for real sure

601
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,494
gonna break your head
so you can't think no more.

602
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,246
Hey, man, why don't you lighten up?

603
00:45:47,496 --> 00:45:49,831
Tell me about that guy
that's working Virginia.

604
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,917
Don't care.
Didn't ask.

605
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:57,172
You mean you're gonna let her go
just like that?

606
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,091
From where I stand,
she let me go.

607
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:02,427
Well, you know, if she wants you
to chase her, that's the game.

608
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:05,973
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

609
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:08,350
never chase buses or women.

610
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,686
You always get left behind.

611
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,662
I assume you're here to do business?

612
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:33,208
Well... I'd like to do some business
with you some other time.

613
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,836
But right now we got to talk
to the man upstairs.

614
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:37,921
Stay on my tail.

615
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,303
No problem.

616
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,653
Well, looks like we really
rattled the cage, Marlboro.

617
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,705
You know this ain't gonna fly.

618
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,290
I'll bet you it flies.

619
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:19,463
- How much?
- I'll bet you a dollar.

620
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,798
But if you win, you're gonna have
to give me some credit

621
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:24,468
'cause that cab fare last night
broke me.

622
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,222
If I win, we're dead.

623
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:33,185
( Telephone rings )

624
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,896
Well, strap on your seat belt
and get ready to fly.

625
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:40,400
American Airlines.

626
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,986
You've got something of mine.

627
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,404
And I want it back.

628
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,407
Oh, really?
What is that?

629
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,576
You know something?

630
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:53,538
You've got balls.
Big ones.

631
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:56,541
But they're not as big
as you might think.

632
00:47:56,792 --> 00:48:00,796
Well, mister, my balls are big enough
to get your attention.

633
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,589
( Whistles )

634
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:12,557
What do you want?

635
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:15,811
Oh, how's about two and a half
million dollars?

636
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:20,399
Nah, wait a minute. Check that.
I got a little side bet going.

637
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:24,027
Make that two and a half
million dollars plus a buck.

638
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:27,739
When?
Where?

639
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,367
Airplane graveyard.

640
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:34,663
Late.
Tonight.

641
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,166
Well, I'll tell you what,
you better call your boys off

642
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:40,710
or you ain't gonna get nothing.

643
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:43,964
Yeah.
Talk to you on the rebound... asshole.

644
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:45,465
( Click )

645
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:51,263
( telephone rings )

646
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,223
Yes, sir?

647
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:56,435
Let 'em go, Alexander.

648
00:48:56,685 --> 00:48:57,978
Let 'em go.

649
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,566
( Helicopter flying overhead )

650
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,709
Okay, let's do it.

651
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,067
Your boys are good...

652
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:47,861
for dilettantes.

653
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,906
They're not my boys.
They're my friends.

654
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:53,492
Yeah.
Let's see the crystals.

655
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:56,286
Let's see the cash.

656
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:59,998
Hey.
Open it real slow, huh?

657
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,625
( Chuckles softly )

658
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,594
Why the extra dollar?

659
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:14,095
We had a bet.

660
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,266
Okay.

661
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:42,666
Well, wasn't a walk in the park,
but the job's done.

662
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,292
( Chuckles )

663
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:50,173
( laughs )

664
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:53,510
You did it.
You did it, man.

665
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,262
Check this out, old man.

666
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:01,935
Besides Jimmy and Lulu
and the rest of you,

667
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:05,480
this place is what keeps me
coming back day after day.

668
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,191
Thank you for giving that back to me.

669
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:12,028
I've got things to do.

670
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:14,114
Tomorrow we open for good.

671
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:16,408
All right.
All right, Pops.

672
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:18,451
( laughs )
Whoo!

673
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:21,621
Oh, man, I am thankful for this.
( laughs )

674
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:24,666
But you boys are whacked out,
you know that?

675
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:28,003
I'm talking about you, Harley.
( laughs )

676
00:51:29,713 --> 00:51:31,423
Hey, man,
that's what friendship's about.

677
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:35,051
Jack: It's done, and it's done good.
So let's take the edge off.

678
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:37,220
Come here, Marlboro,
get in this.

679
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,932
To Lulu, who'd kill me
if she knew what I helped do.

680
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,602
But because I did it,
she still has a job.

681
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:45,145
To Lulu.

682
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,743
What's wrong, man?
We done good tonight.

683
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:03,872
Shit, Harley,
we're way out of our league, man.

684
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:07,000
It was too easy.

685
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:10,128
I think we oughta get the fuck
out of Dodge,

686
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,339
let things cool off for a while.

687
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:14,966
Aw, look at this shit.

688
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:25,143
Harley:
How the fuck did they find us?

689
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:26,811
Marlboro:
I don't know.

690
00:52:27,062 --> 00:52:29,856
I damn sure don't wanna find out.

691
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,399
( Shotgun cocks )

692
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,945
Not this again.

693
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:38,531
I can't deal with this again, Harley.

694
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:43,036
The old man has got it under control.

695
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:49,167
Yeah, tell them we were in,
but we left.

696
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,877
That's right.
That's right, boy.

697
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:53,463
Take your pussy friends,
get the hell out of here.

698
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,882
Marlboro:
Oops.

699
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:57,175
I don't think he liked that.

700
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:00,261
I don't give a flying fuck
what he likes.

701
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:17,153
( Screams )

702
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,551
We gotta get the hell outta here!

703
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,010
No kidding.

704
00:54:04,826 --> 00:54:08,163
I'm gonna fucking die today, Harley,
and I blame you.

705
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:12,250
No, we're gonna live, man, and we're
gonna go through that window to do it.

706
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,130
Jack, cover me.

707
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:32,437
Jack, come on!

708
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,276
Jack:
I'm right behind you!

709
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,284
Jack?!

710
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,205
Jack!

711
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:21,546
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

712
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:27,677
- ( Muffled screaming )
- Shh, shh, shh.

713
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:30,013
Lady?
Lady, hey, hey, hey, hey.

714
00:56:30,263 --> 00:56:32,181
Take it easy.
We don't wanna hurt you.

715
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:38,229
Take her.

716
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:48,781
"Take her" he says.

717
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,619
Jesus, lady!

718
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:00,793
Hey, hey, hey!
This is a restricted area, man.

719
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:02,795
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

720
00:57:03,046 --> 00:57:04,589
You're gonna have to scoot.
I mean fast.

721
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:09,594
Hey, chump,
in case you don't hear so good,

722
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,471
I said get the fuck outta here!

723
00:58:02,397 --> 00:58:04,440
I hate this fucking town.

724
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:08,444
Hey, man, you don't know
anything about this city.

725
00:58:08,695 --> 00:58:11,030
I grew up here,
you dumb bastard.

726
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:14,784
I didn't know that.

727
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,995
Yeah, well,
what you don't know is a lot.

728
00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:22,750
You mean to tell me
that real cowboys,

729
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:27,672
I mean, shit-kickin' rodeo cowboys,
come from Vegas?

730
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:31,509
Some of the best.

731
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,096
Maybe even one of the best.

732
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:47,066
Hey, man,
I know you don't wanna be here.

733
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:52,488
We're just gonna stay long enough
to clean up and get some sleep.

734
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:54,907
Yeah, okay.

735
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:57,577
Did I ever tell you the time
I lost my cherry

736
00:58:57,827 --> 00:59:00,830
to a fat girl in a room just like this?

737
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,874
It was in Mesquite, Texas.

738
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:04,375
Her name was Annie.

739
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:09,047
Wasn't too good putting us
up on this top floor like this.

740
00:59:09,297 --> 00:59:11,966
There was a convention in town.
It was all we could get.

741
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,553
Makes for a tough getaway.

742
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:19,265
Look, partner,
they're not gonna find us here.

743
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:22,101
- They can't.
- I wouldn't bet on that.

744
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:30,318
Why don't you stop whining, you know?
You're starting to sound like Jimmy.

745
00:59:41,496 --> 00:59:43,456
Jimmy's dead,
you heartless piece of shit.

746
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:53,883
Four of our friends got killed tonight.

747
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,512
They're gone.

748
00:59:57,762 --> 00:59:59,514
Fucking tagged-on-the-toe dead.

749
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:02,391
Does that matter to you?

750
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:05,645
I mean, do you fucking care?

751
01:00:08,064 --> 01:00:10,149
Hey, Marlboro,
I didn't force anyone to do it.

752
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:15,113
They took the chance,
and they knew the risk.

753
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:19,951
All right, hey, look, it's my fault.

754
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:21,744
And I gotta live with it.

755
01:00:23,496 --> 01:00:26,958
But right now me and you gotta
pull it together if we're gonna survive.

756
01:00:44,851 --> 01:00:46,394
( Telephone rings )

757
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:49,814
Hello?

758
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,149
Marlboro: Hello.

759
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:52,775
Hey.

760
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:55,486
Where are you?
Are you all right?

761
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,071
Las Vegas.

762
01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:02,201
I called because I'm drunk,
and I'm tired.

763
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:04,745
I just wanted to hear your voice.

764
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:07,915
Tell me exactly where you are
and what you've done.

765
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:09,917
- ( Chuckles ) No.
- And I can help.

766
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,713
No.
Can't do that.

767
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:20,303
I've already dug too many graves.

768
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:22,054
None of them my own.

769
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:24,140
Robert...

770
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:28,394
you keep running, and sooner or later,
you're gonna end up like your dad.

771
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:31,856
Drunk, dead and alone,
and all you can do is hold on and wait.

772
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:43,409
Robert?

773
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:46,120
Hello?
Are you there?

774
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:51,125
Harley, let's go.
We got company.

775
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:54,503
- Hey, I know how they found us.
- Yeah? Well, Tell me later.

776
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,179
Please, God,
let us get out of this one.

777
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,514
I promise I'll change.

778
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:07,600
That's bullshit, Harley.

779
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,268
I'll fucking try.

780
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:10,853
( Elevator dings )

781
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:14,440
Shit.

782
01:02:19,028 --> 01:02:20,571
Up!
They're going up!

783
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:50,476
Holy shit.

784
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,312
Come on!

785
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:12,331
We're at death's door, Harley,
and the devil's a-knocking.

786
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:16,294
So you better think up of something fast
or start your ass praying for real.

787
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:33,144
Put your gun away.
We're gonna jump.

788
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:47,908
Are you out of your fucking mind?

789
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:51,287
You got a better idea?

790
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:07,553
Well, whatever the hell they're
wearing's made outta die-hard bluesteel.

791
01:04:09,263 --> 01:04:11,140
All right, come on,
take my hand, man.

792
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:12,391
No!

793
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,477
- It's the only way, man.
- I don't care.

794
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:15,686
Well, I'm gonna do it.

795
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:17,313
Do it!

796
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:19,106
You're gonna get shot up here.

797
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:20,941
You're gonna get smashed down there.

798
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:22,526
Hey, man,
I'd rather be smashed than shot.

799
01:04:22,777 --> 01:04:23,861
Not me.

800
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:26,655
All right.
Fuck you!

801
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:29,492
You stay up here,
and you get shot and die!

802
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:30,868
I owe you that.

803
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:51,263
I hate you for this, Harley.
I fucking hate you for this.

804
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:55,601
I hate you, Harley!

805
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:57,061
Oh, shit!

806
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:03,776
Was that fucking intense or what?

807
01:05:27,258 --> 01:05:29,093
( Train whistle toots )

808
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:33,389
We gotta go back, Harley.

809
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,810
What the fuck you talking about?

810
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:41,730
We survived.
It's over.

811
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:46,444
It ain't over.

812
01:05:46,694 --> 01:05:49,822
Hey, man, it's definitely over.

813
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:51,240
See this?

814
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:55,536
It's out of commission.

815
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:59,790
That means that them fuckers can't
keep coming out of nowhere anymore.

816
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:06,005
We still got a bunch of money
we didn't get for ourselves,

817
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:08,883
and a bar full
of dead friends in L.A.

818
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:12,344
It ain't over.

819
01:06:14,472 --> 01:06:15,681
This ain't right.

820
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:19,560
And we owe it to our friends
to make it right.

821
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:24,106
Hey, man, I ain't making any plans
for you and me for a long time.

822
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:27,902
We came out alive.
We came out ahead,

823
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:29,445
I ain't doing it.

824
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:33,908
God damn it, Harley.
We ain't ahead.

825
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:39,038
And if being alive means
living on the run, then I don't want it.

826
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:43,918
Marlboro, you do
what you think is right, right?

827
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:45,920
I'm gonna stay alive.

828
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:57,890
Better to be dead and cool...

829
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,642

870
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:45,516
Sorry I'm late.
I had a layover in Denver.

871
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:51,980
Are you and me friends?

872
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,441
Sure, we're friends.

873
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:56,944
Then how come,

874
01:09:57,194 --> 01:10:00,072
with all the shit that me
and you have been through,

875
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:03,033
I've asked you the same question
a thousand times

876
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:05,285
and you ain't never answered me?

877
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:10,582
What question?

878
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:13,585
What's with you
and those fucking boots?

879
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:16,922
My old man gave me these boots

880
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,135
first time I rode
in a professional rodeo.

881
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:26,557
It was the first and last thing
he ever gave me.

882
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:30,978
Hey, Marlboro,
you could've told me that.

883
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:34,314
Just kind of figured
it was between him and me.

884
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:39,653
I got throwed
and busted my arm in four places.

885
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:43,031
Hey,
I think you should do it again.

886
01:10:45,743 --> 01:10:48,370
Someday.
Maybe.

887
01:10:57,963 --> 01:10:59,965
The hell'd you get that hog leg?

888
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:01,300
Denver.

889
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:07,347
This is a Ruger Super Blackhawk.

890
01:11:07,598 --> 01:11:09,975
454 conversion.

891
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:15,397
God damn, Harley,
that's too much gun for you.

892
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:17,524
This is what I learned with.

893
01:11:17,775 --> 01:11:22,112
( Chuckles ) Nobody learns
with a converted 454.

894
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:23,906
I did.

895
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:28,452
That explains it.

896
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:34,249
I've been through
a lot of shit in my life.

897
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,586
But up until about three weeks ago,

898
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:41,423
the only God damn thing
I ever shot at was tin cans.

899
01:11:43,759 --> 01:11:47,221
You know, I never wanted
to shoot at nobody in anger.

900
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:51,517
And I sure as shit
ain't never wanted to kill nobody.

901
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:54,186
Me, neither.

902
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:16,291
( Beeping )

903
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:21,129
Take up a heading of zero one zero.
They're seven clicks northeast of here.

904
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:24,383
Sounds like the same heading
my co-pilot shouted out

905
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:26,760
the day we choppered into Khe Sanh.

906
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,221
Last thing the ugly bastard ever said.

907
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:31,473
Shut the fuck up and fly, Tom.

908
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:35,269
Okay. Okay.

909
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:52,990
Well, God, if you do exist
and you're up there watching

910
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:57,035
from wherever it is
you're watching from...

911
01:14:57,285 --> 01:14:58,704
just look away for a minute.

912
01:14:58,954 --> 01:15:02,416
Marlboro: Remember,
these bastards are bulletproof.

913
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,794
So aim for their heads,
dead center.

914
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:10,173
You might wanna hold
onto that cannon with both hands.

915
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:12,509
Don't yank.

916
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:14,761
Don't pull.

917
01:15:15,012 --> 01:15:16,054
Squeeze.

918
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:18,056
You ready?

919
01:15:18,306 --> 01:15:20,726
Let's rock and roll these motherfuckers.
( cocks pistol )

920
01:15:20,976 --> 01:15:22,602
Let's make things right.

921
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:48,920
You know, that gun costs about two bucks
every time you fire it.

922
01:15:49,171 --> 01:15:50,756
That's two bucks a bullet.

923
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:54,342
Well, how many did I hit?

924
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:58,680
You spent 12 bucks
and didn't hit a God damn thing.

925
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:01,266
I nailed one,
and it cost four and a quarter.

926
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:02,559
Where'd they go?

927
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:06,730
Right there,
and they're spending a fortune.

928
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:19,409
We really pissed them off this time.

929
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:21,745
No shit.
Come on, let's go.

930
01:16:57,531 --> 01:16:58,949
( Clang )

931
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:20,637
Harley?

932
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:23,140
Are you shooting?

933
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,520
- Harley?
- What?!

934
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:40,634
That's two for me.
You better get off your ass, Harley.

935
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:43,470
Hey, give me a fucking break.
God knows I'm trying.

936
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,140
You better ask God for some help.
We ain't done yet.

937
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,935
Fuck! Shit! Piss!

938
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:33,853
Horseshit in a bear's ass!

939
01:19:43,405 --> 01:19:44,489
Two bucks.

940
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,285
That's four.

941
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:51,538
Six.

942
01:20:03,758 --> 01:20:04,926
12.

943
01:20:39,336 --> 01:20:40,378
(gunshot)

944
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:45,842
( groans )

945
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,768
You're gonna die today.

946
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:58,396
If you wanna make it fast,
tell me where the money is.

947
01:20:58,646 --> 01:21:01,900
If you wanna make it slow, don't.

948
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,610
It's your choice.

949
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:08,365
It's a good day for dying.

950
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:10,825
I'll do it slow.

951
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:17,415
Harley: Hey, slick.

952
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:19,834
Cut him loose.

953
01:21:20,085 --> 01:21:22,712
Oh, shit.
I'm a dead man.

954
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:24,464
Where is the money?

955
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:28,176
Where is the money?

956
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:37,102
Squeeze it, Harley.
Just squeeze it.

957
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:44,484
Agh!

958
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,986
- Shit.
- Shit!

959
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:52,158
That hurt, Harley.
That hurt bad.

960
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:57,580
Looks like your luck just ran out.

961
01:21:57,831 --> 01:21:59,290
Now, where is the money?

962
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:02,168
Shoot him, God damn it!

963
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:07,424
Keep shooting.
You'll make my job easier.

964
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:11,803
Shoot the bastard!
Don't think, just shoot him!

965
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:13,179
Shoot him!

966
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:46,671
Marlboro: Well, that one's for you.
How'd it feel?

967
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:50,133
- Best 12 bucks I ever spent.
-( laughs )

968
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:53,845
Agh... son of a bitch.

969
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:56,222
How you feeling?

970
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:58,224
Oh...

971
01:22:58,475 --> 01:23:00,727
Like I've been rode hard
and put up wet.

972
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:04,647
Well, shake it off.
We got one more.

973
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:06,149
Let's go.

974
01:23:16,618 --> 01:23:19,454
I can't believe
you fucking shot me, Harley.

975
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:24,959
Dickhead,
you fucking shot me.

976
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,507
Can't believe you shot me,
you shit bird.

977
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:40,683
Pilot: I find it hard to believe
you greased those cue balls.

978
01:23:40,934 --> 01:23:43,478
But it's a good thing somebody did.

979
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:45,396
Yeah?
Why's that?

980
01:23:45,647 --> 01:23:47,607
They were pussies.

981
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:52,904
Their clothes were made out of
that lightweight Japanese Kevlar.

982
01:23:53,154 --> 01:23:55,323
( Speaking Japanese )

983
01:24:14,342 --> 01:24:17,887
All right, pal,
this is your last paycheck.

984
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:19,597
You work for us now.

985
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:34,070
( Speaking Japanese )

986
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,076
Here's what we'll do.

987
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:44,122
As soon as I ask him
to change the lease and he says no,

988
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:46,958
just shoot his ass dead.

989
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,918
Why me?

990
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:51,588
I'm all out of bullets.

991
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,637
Yes, Howard,
it's good to hear from you, too.

992
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:02,599
Now, uh, what do you want from me?
Spit it out.

993
01:25:04,309 --> 01:25:05,393
Uh-huh.

994
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:09,063
Uh, listen, How-- Howard,

995
01:25:09,314 --> 01:25:10,982
I'm not interested
in the third world, okay?

996
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:13,735
There's too much can go the wrong way
and not much that can go our way.

997
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:16,487
Now, we've had this discussion.
I don't want to have it again, okay?

998
01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:19,240
Listen, Howard, say hello to your wife.
You're married, aren't you?

999
01:25:25,997 --> 01:25:29,459
Looking for Chance Wilder.
You him?

1000
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:34,172
That's right.

1001
01:25:34,422 --> 01:25:37,133
Deal away, Harley.

1002
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:38,843
Well, here.

1003
01:25:40,428 --> 01:25:42,930
This is yours. We took it.
Wasn't right of us.

1004
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:47,644
So now you can change the lease back
to the Rock 'N' Roll Bar and Grill.

1005
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:52,231
No handouts.
No breaks.

1006
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:55,485
Just a fair deal,
that's all we're asking.

1007
01:25:55,735 --> 01:25:58,738
You guys must be charmed...

1008
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:00,698
to have made it this far.

1009
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:02,867
Well,
four of our friends are dead.

1010
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:06,162
No, we're not charmed.

1011
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:07,830
We're just pissed off.

1012
01:26:08,081 --> 01:26:09,290
That's too bad.

1013
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,833
Oh!

1014
01:26:11,084 --> 01:26:13,711
That's too bad.

1015
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:16,589
Sorry I pissed you off.

1016
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:19,050
Listen...

1017
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,344
the lease stands, okay?

1018
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:23,304
So that's the end of that story.

1019
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:26,599
So if you came here to kill me,
do it now.

1020
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:29,644
If not,
get the fuck out of here.

1021
01:26:29,894 --> 01:26:33,606
I don't have the time to play
with guys like you, okay?

1022
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:35,900
I'm very busy.

1023
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,902
Hey, this ain't a game.

1024
01:26:38,152 --> 01:26:40,363
All business is a game
one way or another.

1025
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:42,657
Selling drugs ain't no game.

1026
01:26:42,907 --> 01:26:44,909
It's not your average game,
that's true.

1027
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:50,039
I make $500,000 a year to sit
in this office and run this bank, okay?

1028
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:55,712
I make another $50 million a year to sit
in the same office and run those drugs.

1029
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:58,423
Now, that's a big game,
and it's big-time.

1030
01:26:58,673 --> 01:27:01,801
Well, game's over.
Go ahead and do it, Marlboro.

1031
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:19,318
What are you waiting for?

1032
01:27:19,569 --> 01:27:21,696
Just kill him and let's get
the fuck out of here.

1033
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:27,869
( Whispers )
I can't do it.

1034
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:33,708
It's not right.

1035
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:37,712
Hey, this scumbag killed
four of our friends just for laughs.

1036
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,173
Still doesn't make it right.

1037
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:42,341
What are you talking about?

1038
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:48,264
My old man used to tell me,
before he left this shitty world,

1039
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:50,558
never shoot an unarmed man.

1040
01:27:50,808 --> 01:27:52,727
Marlboro, fuck your old man.
Your old man's dead.

1041
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:55,104
Leave my old man
out of this, all right?

1042
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:59,108
All right. Here.
Now he's armed.

1043
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:00,818
That gun's empty, Harley.

1044
01:28:02,487 --> 01:28:03,738
So what?

1045
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:06,324
This piece of shit
gives drugs to kids.

1046
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:08,618
Drop it!

1047
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:24,383
You guys, did you really think you were
just gonna walk in here and shoot me?

1048
01:28:24,634 --> 01:28:26,385
You--
you thought that, didn't you?

1049
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:28,721
That was the plan.

1050
01:28:30,348 --> 01:28:31,349
Yeah, that was the plan.

1051

( laughs )
You guys--

1052
01:28:34,352 --> 01:28:36,020
you guys are a piece of work.

1053
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,648
You got an edge.
And I like that.

1054
01:28:38,898 --> 01:28:40,441
I do. I like that.

1055
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:42,485
It almost makes me sorry
that I have to kill you.

1056
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:44,195
But I-- I do. Hmm.

1057
01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:46,614
I do right now.

1058
01:29:48,175 --> 01:29:50,428
What'd you do?
Did you pay him?

1059
01:29:51,929 --> 01:29:54,056
No, man, that was your money.

1060
01:29:54,307 --> 01:29:56,809
You paid him.
He did that for free.

1061
01:29:59,854 --> 01:30:00,938
You guys.

1062
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:04,108
Like your buddy said,
fuck your old man.

1063
01:30:04,358 --> 01:30:06,193
He's dead, right?
Fuck him.

1064
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:08,195
Let's see what you're made of, huh?

1065
01:30:17,622 --> 01:30:18,789
Think fast!

1066
01:30:50,738 --> 01:30:51,781
Harley!

1067
01:30:58,162 --> 01:31:01,457
- Good timing.
- I told you to shoot the fuck.

1068
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:14,220
( Screams )

1069
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:24,105
Hey, guns are made to be shot,
not thrown.

Who says I'm going?

1074
01:31:45,543 --> 01:31:48,170
You always do, Harley.

1075
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,089
It's that time.

1076
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:52,633
You wanna come with me?

1077
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,097
Can't.

1078
01:32:00,099 --> 01:32:02,893
I shouldn't have asked.
You never say yes.

1079
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,991
- Get the hell outta here.

Announcer:
This is Robert Lee Edison,

1083
01:32:49,732 --> 01:32:53,027
a third-generation cowboy
with his own brand of misery.

1084
01:32:53,277 --> 01:32:55,488
He hails from Las Vegas, Nevada,

1085
01:32:55,738 --> 01:32:57,031
and hasn't seen the back
of a bull's neck

1086
01:32:57,281 --> 01:32:59,867
since he got off real hard
in the National Finals Rodeo

1087
01:33:00,117 --> 01:33:01,494
seven years ago.

1088
01:33:01,744 --> 01:33:04,288
Let's see what he gets done
on a bull called Hondo,

1089
01:33:04,538 --> 01:33:07,333
the top bull
of the Diamond S rodeo company.

1090
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:10,920
Okay, big boy,
let's make it a good one.

1092
