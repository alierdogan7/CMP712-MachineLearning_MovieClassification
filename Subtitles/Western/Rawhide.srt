to learn you the business...

shaving, taking a bath.

00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,898
Well, it's no wonder them mules
don't take to you kindly.

- Placerville.
- In a mining camp?

- That's right.
- Poor little thing.

<i>- That's tough.</i>
- It's tough to be born anywhere.

Little more coffee, Mrs. Holt?

66
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:07,388
No, thank you. And please stop calling me

- Miss Holt?
- Yes.

68
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,780
Have a little more coffee,
Mr. Slade?

69
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:26,148
Coffee? This stuff tastes like burnt corn
boiled in branch water.

00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,653
Well, could be.
We don't run no fancy hotel here.

Back wherever you came from I'll bet you were
glad to get a drink out of a sluice box.

Mule boy doesn't.
But it's eat or starve, so I— I eat.

- J.C. Owens.

00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,825
- You just pull in from the west?
- Half hour ago.

90
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,768
- You didn't by any chance
see four men on the road?
- Nope.

<i>- [Scott] I thought they had him</i>
<i>in prison over at Huntsville.</i>

94

Him and three others.

96
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,851
- You didn't see 'em, did you, Todd?
- No. And I don't want to neither.

97
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,853
Figure they crossed over into Mexico?

98
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,651
No, they're after gold.
Lots of it.

99
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,693
Found that out at La Mesilla,
where they held upJohnny Madden's stage.

100
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,955
- Well, Johnny drove through here just yesterday.
<i>- That's right.</i>

101
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,725
- Do much damage?
- Plenty. Killed Johnny Madden.

102
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,925
- Johnny Madden killed?
- Johnny?

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,968
Yeah. We're here to give you escort...

104
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,128

00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,408
- You and little Callie
will have to stay here, Miss Holt.
- Why?

107
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,415
- Company rule.
- That's right, ma'am.

108
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:42,250
Company rule, my foot. I paid my fare. It took
all the money I could scrape up. I won't do it.

109
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm sorry. It's a company rule
not to risk the lives of children.

110
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,021
If you're bent on going,
I can't stop you...

111
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,086
but you'll have to leave
the baby behind.

112
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,131
That's one responsibility
I'm not allowed to take.

113
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,168
Leave Callie behind?
Jibber-jabber.

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,305

- [Sam] Go on. Hurry it up.

00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,311

You leave me and my things alone!

120
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,248
I'm going in this stagecoach,
and the baby's going with me!

121
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,259
- Stop her, Tom.
- Just try and stop me!

122
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,261
- I said stop her, Tom!
- How?

123
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,423
- Well, grab her. Doggone it. Grab her.

- Come on. Hurry up.

126
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,471
<i>Take your hands off me!</i>
<i>Let me go!</i>

127
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,009
You fool! You'll make me

128
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,979
- Hurry up, Gil! Get 'em on out!
- Let me go!

129
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,779
I hope you're happy
with what you've done.

130
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,411
- I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
- Thanks for not breaking it.

131
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,819
Don't blame me, ma'am.
I'm only a hired hand here.

132
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,451
You'll only lose one day, ma'am.
You can go in on the stage tomorrow.

133
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:01,256
Tom, you take her things inside,
and I'll look after the mules.

137
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,407
- I'm sorry. This is mine.
- Not tonight it isn't.

138
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,876
What are you afraid of?
Coyotes?

139
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,105
Yeah. The kind with boots on.

140
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,172
Wait a minute.

141
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,650
Is there someplace around here
I can take a bath?

142
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,211
- Yeah. The pitcher's full.
- I said bath.

143
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,758
Come on.

00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,919

147
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,970
That's a horse trough.

148
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,633
Well, just don't use any soap.
The animals don't like it.

149
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,768
Is that where you take a bath?

150
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,677
- No.
- Don't you ever take a bath?

151
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,443
Now and again,
back in the canyon, a hot spring.

152
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,883
That's more like it.
Mind if I borrow this?

153
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,251
Well, it looks as if you already have.

154
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,256
You sure you know how to use it?

155
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,418
- I've seen them around.
- Well, here.

156
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:12,055
In that case, you might
just as well take this too.

157
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,999
And you'll find my towel
and my soap in my room.

She's doing what you
ought to do once in a while: Take a bath.

161
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:37,388
Keep dry outside and wet inside.
That's what a man does in this country.

162
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,883
<i>[Horse Whinnies]</i>

163
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:47,193
What's that?
You hear anything?

164
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,229
- No, I don't hear anything.
- Where's your gun?

165
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,296
- Where do you think? She took it.
<i>- [Horse Whinnies]</i>

166
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,983
Psst.

167
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,100
[Sam]
Now, who can—who can that be?

168
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,795
- [Tom] What are you gonna do?
- Keep a bead on him till you find out who it is.

169
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,622
[Rifle Cocks]

170
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,095
- Are you the station keeper?
- No, I just work here.

171
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,066
Where's the boss?

172
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,626
Oh, he's around.

173
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,366
Just the two of you work here?

174
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,073
I guess you're wondering
who I am, huh?

175
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,304
Well, there aren't
many strangers come along.

176
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,145
I've been wondering about you too.

177
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,914
But I guess you're all right.

178
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,983
<i>Deputy Sheriff Miles,</i>
<i>from Huntsville.</i>

179

Oh. [Chuckles]
Owens is my name.

180
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,565
It's all right, Sam.
You can come out now.

181
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,849
I hear they killed
one of my best friends, Johnny Madden.

182
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,255
- That's right.
- Ought to be shot down
like a mad dog, that Zimmerman.

183
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,316
Not a doubt about it.

184
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,624
Trooper said he's looking for gold.

185
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,630
Just stand still, Todd.

186
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,298

<i>- [Zimmerman] Keep 'em covered.</i>

193
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:48,037
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Sure, Zim.</i>

194
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:58,051
- That everybody, boss? Just them two?
<i>- Don't know for sure.</i>

195
00:15:58,122 --> 00:16:01,319
- By golly, it worked, just like Zim said.
- We could have rode straight in.

196
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,826
- Yancy, take a look around outside.
- Sure.

197
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:07,353
- Here. Take this.
- You reckon that I'll be needing firearms, boss?

198
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:11,095
- Take it. Put our horses
in the corral and hide the saddles.
- Sure.

199
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:15,301
Take a look around for guns.

200
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,068
- Gratz.
- Yeah, Zim?

201
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,088
All right, Todd, Owens, turn around.

202
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,295
- Listen, Zimmerman.
- I'll do the talking!

203
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,797
I gotta say something!

204
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:45,432
Now, I want answers,
and I want 'em right.

205
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,595
What time's the next stage due here?

206
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:51,972
- One from the east.
- What time?

207
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,375
- Tonight.
- What time?

208
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,413
About sundown.

209
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:59,075
What about the next stage
from the west?

210
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,710
- That's tomorrow.
- What time?

211
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,651
Usually early mornin'.

212
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,615
That right?

213
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,552
I ask you, is that right?

214
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:16,459
- Yeah.
- Know how much gold it's carrying?

215
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:21,565
- No.
- You?

216
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:23,903
None. That shipment
went through today.

217
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:25,966
You—

218
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,140
I don't like to be lied to.

219
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:36,812
The westbound stage
is due here at 8:00 tonight.

220
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:39,584
The California stage
comes through tomorrow noon...

221
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:42,490
and it's carrying close to
$100,000 in gold bars...

222
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,154
consigned by the Crocker Mining Company
in Sacramento...

223
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:47,322
to the government mint
in Wall Street, New York.

224
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:51,459
<i>You both knew it becauseJohnny Madden</i>
<i>told you so yesterday.</i>

225
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,663
'Tain't so, Zimmerman.

226
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,713
Hey, Zim! Look!

227
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:06,511
You want to take me out
to a barn dance?

228
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:09,815
- Where did you get those things?
- In there.

229
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,855
- Where is she?
- Look, Zimmerman—

230
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:14,187
<i>- [Zimmerman] Your wife?</i>
- No.

231
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:17,318
So she's yours.

232
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:20,990
Where is she?
Where is she, Owens?

233
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:24,728
- Where's your wife?
- I haven't got a wife.

234
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,640
[Chuckles]
Look at the mules.

235
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:45,745

236
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,720

238
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:16,513
He won't hand us no more lies.

239
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,147
Where was you, Zim?

240
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:23,853
Using my head.
You ran out and left Owens.

241
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,793
Where is he?

242
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,225
You want I, uh, should
take care of him too?

243
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:35,238
If you had half a brain,
you'd know we need Owens.

244
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,240
<i>[Callie Crying]</i>

245
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:40,038
Sounds just like a baby crying.

246
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,739
<i>- [Crying Continues]</i>
- I'm a ringtail monkey if it don't.

248
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:55,154
Look. Look.
It-It is a baby.

[Crying Continues]

251
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,778
Those are the men
the troopers were looking for.

252
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:24,117
<i>- Why did they lock me in here?</i>
- They think you're my wife.

253
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,179
- Your wife?
<i>- That's right.</i>

254
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:30,887
- What gave them that idea?
- I don't know. I didn't say it. It was their idea.

255
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:33,624
- Did you tell 'em different?
- They didn't give me a chance.

256
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:36,223
- Well, don't do it then.
<i>- Why?</i>

257
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,598
Well, it might save
your skin and your baby's.

258
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:41,137
- How?
<i>- I don't know, but as long</i>
<i>as they've made a mistake...</i>

259
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,139
<i>we might as well go along with it.</i>

260
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:47,007
- Whose skin are you trying to save? Ours or yours?
- Well, mine too.

261
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:50,844
Now listen here, <i>Miss</i> Holt or Mrs. Holt
or whatever your name is...

262
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:53,145
those killers are after gold—

263
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:55,981
gold that's coming through tomorrow
on the stage from California.

264
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:59,216
I don't know what's in their crazy heads
or what their scheme is...

265
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,521
but killing me right away isn't part of it,
or they'd have done that by now.

266
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:05,118
What's all this got to do with
your telling them I'm your wife?

267
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:08,791
I told you I didn't tell 'em.
They just put two and two together.

268
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:12,131
Simple as that, huh?
You're not getting me mixed up in this.

269
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:15,070
I'm going out there and tell them
I'm just a passenger on this line.

270
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,198
They can rob all
the stagecoaches they want to...

271
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,334
but I'll do nothing to get
Callie and me killed.

272
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,344
Now you listen to me.

273
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:23,972
Your only chance of staying alive
at least as long as I do...

274
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,243
is to let 'em keep on thinking
that you're my wife.

275
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:28,478
They need me.

276
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,748
The gold they want
is on the eastbound stage...

277
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,120
but it doesn't come
through here until tomorrow.

278
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,921
There's a westbound stage
that goes through here tonight.

279
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:39,759
Sam's dead. They've got to
keep me here alive.

280
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:43,323
Now you and the baby
can stay alive just as long as I do.

281
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:46,234
That's all I've gotta say,
and you can do what you like.

282
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,521
- Where'd you get this?
- Why do you think Todd
was running for the stable?

283
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,525
That's where Zim find it, by golly.

284
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,562
Old sowbelly sure could have
picked us off with this.

285
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:15,725
Give it to Gratz. He won't leave it lying around
where Owens can get his hands on it.

286
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:23,198
Meanin' you can't count on me?

287
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,142
Now let's get this straight.

288
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,610
I didn't pick any of you for this.

289
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,239
You just happened to be there
when I made my break.

290
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:34,113
All right. You're here.
And that's my bad luck.

291
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:36,119
By golly, Zim, I don't do nothing.

292
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:38,314
<i>Aw, it's not you he's shootin'at.</i>

293
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:42,485
You, Gratz—You're nothing but a—
a big dumb coot that does anything he says.

294
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,587
And you, Yancy—
You're a one-horse horse thief.

295
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:49,599
It's me he's gripin' at.

296
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:55,565
The first thing to do
is to get rid ofTodd's body.

297
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,801
Take care of it, Tevis.

298
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,436
- You, Yancy. Give him a hand.
- Sure.

299
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:03,503
<i>[Tevis]</i>
<i>Come on, bean belly.</i>

300
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:22,932
All right. Come out.

301
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,177
Gratz!

302
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:39,410
- You must forgive him.
He's just a big dumb animal.
- Yeah, by golly.

303
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,350
What kind of an animal are you,
letting them shoot down an unarmed man?

304
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,787
Kill or be killed.
He was heading for that rifle.

305
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:51,552
- Where's your gun?
- My what?

306
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:55,690
- Your revolver. You know what I'm talking about.
- Can't you see he hasn't any?

307
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,393
Where's your revolver?

308
00:23:57,468 --> 00:24:00,869
Well, Sam had it. You took it away from him.
Don't you remember?

309
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:04,066
- Where's his gun?
- He sent it to Tucson to have it fixed.

310
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:06,507
What was wrong with it?

311
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,670
The firing pin was broken.

312
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:16,876
That's a rotten thing to do.

313
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,521
Tevis.

314
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,427
Put that body on a pack mule.

315
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:38,039
Tevis has no respect for the dead.

316
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,669
And he just loves the living.

317
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,679
Why don't you let us bury him?

318
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,341
We won't run away.
We'd hate to get shot in the back.

319
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:48,283
Go ahead, if it'll make you
feel any better.

320
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:50,286
Wait a minute.
I'll get the baby.

321
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:52,379
She's all right
where she is, Mrs. Owens.

322
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:56,415
If you want to go with your husband, go,
but the baby stays here.

323
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:03,595
Go with 'em.

Where's my pistol?

335
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,132
It must be behind the water trough.

Just a minute.

337
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:51,571
Now I want the next stage
to come through and no questions asked.

Where were you bound for?

348
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:04,577
I was taking Callie to her father's folks
in Independence.

349
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:10,078
- Where is her father?
- He was killed in Gold Run three months ago.

354
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:29,534
We used to sing and dance
on the Mississippi riverboats.

355
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:33,600
Jeannie fell in love with a gambler.

356
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:36,145
He got the gold fever.
You know, wanted to go out west.

<i>She wouldn't go without me.</i>

358
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:44,086
<i>So we went.</i>
<i>From mining camp to mining camp.</i>

359
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:47,988
Jeannie was pretty.
Johnny, her husband, was...

360
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,117
hot-tempered and jealous.

361
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:53,789
Every time a man so much
as gaveJeannie a smile there'd be a brawl.

362
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:57,095
One night a drunken
claim jumper took a fancy to her...

363
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:00,466
and when the shooting
was over I was alone...

364
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:02,528
with Callie.

365
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:04,597
I kept on working.

366
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:08,540

to get us back east.

367
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,315

368
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,408

Owens'll take orders from us

that's the only way
he'll save his wife and kid.

blows up in our faces.

It's just a coat—

380

He took it from that

381
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,344
- He took a whole carpetbag full.
- Take it off!

leave a woman and baby...
