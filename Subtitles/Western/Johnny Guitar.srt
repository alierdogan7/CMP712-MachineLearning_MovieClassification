1
00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:03,922
(stately music)

2
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:15,767
(dramatic orchestral music)

3
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,522
(loud explosion)

4
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:47,901
(horse whinnies)

5
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,737
(loud explosion)

6
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,244
- [Voiceover] All's clear!

7
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,917
(wagon rumbles)

8
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:16,221
(gun firing)

9
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:29,317
(urgent music)

10
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:40,829
(horses galloping)

11
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:54,759
(wind swirling, roaring)

12
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,570
(quick snapping)

13
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,285
(soft rattling)

14
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:15,924
- What's your pleasure?

15
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:16,841
- Whiskey.

16
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,822
Where's the boss?

17
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,407
- [Bartender] Who's asking?

18
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,743
- Name is Johnny...

19
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:44,661
Guitar.

20
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:46,496
- So?

21
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,083
- I have an appointment with Vienna.

22
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,253
- Vienna's busy, you'll have to wait.

23
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,673
- I could use a little dinner.

24
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,758
- Fix him up in the kitchen, Tom.

25
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:00,260
- Right this way.

26
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:07,183
- You ain't paid for your drink, mister.

27
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:10,103
- Now friend, don't rush the night.

28
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,063
I may be around awhile.

29
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,150
Take good care of these.

30
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,235
- [Tom] That's a lot
of man you're carrying

31
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,987
in those boots, stranger.

32
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,363
You know, there's
something about a tall man,

33
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,448
makes people sit up and take notice.

34
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:23,533
Yes, sir.

35
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,993
- [Voiceover] It's a Johnny Guitar.

36
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:28,579
Says he has an appointment with you.

37
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,415
- I'll see him later.

38
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,309
(wind howling)

39
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,519
- Sam, light a lamp and hang it outside.

40
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:53,229
- Nobody'll be in in this weather.

41
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,315
- [Vienna] And if they do,
how can they find the place?

42
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:56,816
Just hang a lamp.

43
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:03,448
- Never seen a woman who was more a man.

44
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:04,907
She thinks like one, acts like one,

45
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:08,411
and sometimes makes me feel like I'm not.

46
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,417
- Eddie, that's last month's paper.

47
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,627
How many times do you have to read it?

48
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:19,547
- I like to know what's
happening in the world outside.

49
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:22,258
- There'll be plenty going on here soon.

50
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:23,968
Just worry about that.

51
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:28,014
- I never believed I'd end
my years working for a woman

52
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,265
and likin' it.

53
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,644
- Spin the wheel, Eddie.

54
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,813
- What for? There's no customers.

55
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,982
- I like to hear it spin.

56
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,739
(ball rattling)

57
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,793
Please sit down.

58
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:02,215
More wine, Mr. Andrews?

59
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:03,800
- Oh, no more, thanks,
I'd better be getting

60
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:04,884
back to my crew.

61
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,761
We've a good deal of mountain
to blast through yet.

62
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,807
- But you have to wait
till the storm settles.

63
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:14,560
- Tell me, why did you
pick this spot to build?

64
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:15,520
How could you possibly know

65
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,981
that the rail road was coming this way?

66
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,192
- Some time ago, I ran into your surveyor

67
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:23,694
and we exchanged confidences.

68
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:25,696
- Ah.

69
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,909
- When the rail road comes through here,

70
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:34,205
how much do you think this
property will be worth?

71
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:35,456
- What's Albuquerque worth?

72
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:38,918
- How would you like to share in it?

73
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,045
I'll need all the help I can get.

74
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,923
- I couldn't help you, I'm
not very handy with a gun.

75
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,801
- I'm offering you an
opportunity to get rich.

76
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,055
- An opportunity to get
killed would be more accurate.

77
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:55,351
- I see you've been
influenced by my friends.

78
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:59,021
- They're determined people,
too determined for my tastes.

79
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,441
But I wish you luck, Vienna.

80
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,401
For whatever it's worth.

81
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,987
- Thanks, Mr. Andrews, but
I'm not trusting to luck.

82
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:09,991
A good gunfighter doesn't
depend on four leaf clovers.

83
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,825
And I think I...

84
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,035
(horses galloping)

85
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,745
- Expecting company?

86
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,414
- Not for dinner.

87
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,250
(dramatic music)

88
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,753
- [Driver] Whoa!

89
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:25,423
(wind roaring)

90
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:47,403
(roulette wheel rattling)

91
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,409
(bell rings)

92
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,208
- Keep the wheel spinning, Eddie.

93
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,960
(ominous music)

94
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,729
- Come on down, Vienna.

95
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:25,775
(roulette wheel rattling)

96
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,944
- Take a good look, Vienna.

97
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,737
- I'm sorry, Emma.

98
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,114
Your brother was a very fine man.

99
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,367
- How would you know?

100
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,119
He was one man who never
even looked at you.

101
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,080
- He was still a fine man.

102
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,374
- [Voiceover] We want the
Dancin' Kid and his bunch.

103
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,333
- [Vienna] Why come to me?

104
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:43,709
They don't live here.

105
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:44,544
- [Emma] You're one of them.

106
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:45,378
- Now, just a minute.

107
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,587
- We don't need you any more, Marshal.

108
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,173
- We got enough trouble,
Vienna, don't give us none.

109
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,134
- The only trouble we have
here is what you've brought in.

110
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:52,969
- Jenks!

111
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:53,844
- Yes, Mr. McIvers.

112
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,805
- You were driving the
stagecoach, you saw the killin'.

113
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,473
Who did it?

114
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:58,891
- [Marshal] Answer the question.

115
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,142
- Well, there was four of 'em--

116
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,769
- I didn't ask ya how
many, I asked ya who.

117
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,187
- The sun was shinin' in my eyes.

118
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,982
- A while ago, you said
it was the Dancin' Kid.

119
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,149
Say it now.

120
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,236
- You said it was the Kid, I
only said it could have been.

121
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,029
- Any more witnesses, Marshal?

122
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:13,948
- We don't need any more witnesses.

123
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:17,660
We're taking you and
your men into custody.

124
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:21,163
- Eddie, you can stop spinning the wheel.

125
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,138
Come and get me, Mr. McIvers.

126
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:38,806
- We don't want no shooting, Vienna.

127
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,851
- I'm not coming peaceably, Marshal.

128
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,978
- Now look here, this is a hanging matter.

129
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,063
We can't just go arresting
people without proof.

130
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:47,982
- If the Kid was here,
would you ask for proof?

131
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,151
- [Marshal] The Dancin' Kid
and Vienna aren't the same.

132
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,028
- I say they are.

133
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,030
They both cast the same shadow.

134
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,616
- Someone holds up the
stagecoach, your brother is killed

135
00:10:56,824 --> 00:11:00,286
and all you can think about
is hanging the Dancin' Kid.

136
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,663
You know he didn't do it.

137
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:04,081
You all know it.

138
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,918
What's your real reason, Emma?

139
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,211
- 'Cause he's a killer.

140
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,796
- What has he killed?

141
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,506
Why do you hate him so?

142
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:14,842
What did he ever do to you?

143
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:21,307
Maybe you don't hate him.

144
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:25,144
- If you got something to say,
you'd better say it, Vienna.

145
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:26,771
- Let Emma say it.

146
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,523
- I wouldn't spit on him.

147
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,360
Oh, he was always eyeing me.

148
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,486
I never told my poor brother

149
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,780
because Len would have killed him.

150
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,948
That's why he held up the
stage and killed my brother.

151
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:42,495
Because now he thinks he
can get me, that's why.

152
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,040
- You've got it a little
twisted, haven't you, Emma?

153
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,209
Now you think you can get him.

154
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,460
- She's crazy.

155
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,171
- You want the Kid and
you're so ashamed of it,

156
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,006
you want him dead.

157
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:56,592
You want me dead, too.

158
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:59,095
Then maybe you can sleep nights.

159
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:02,598
- I won't sleep 'til I
see both of you hanged.

160
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:06,560
You and the Kid and all
of your filthy kind.

161
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,354
Look at her, standing up there,

162
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,774
staring down on us, like a somebody.

163
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,026
Go get her! Drag her down!

164
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,823
- I've never done a
thing to hurt any of you.

165
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,533
Don't make me do it now.

166
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,243
- You're nothin' but a rail road tramp.

167
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,453
You're not fit to live
among decent people.

168
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,247
- You better get out
of here while you can,

169
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,289
you and your men.

170
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,958
- We're here to stay, Mr. McIvers,

171
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,168
you'd better get used to that idea.

172
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,712
- We don't want you here.

173
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,463
- This was free country when I came.

174
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,799
I'm not giving up a single foot of it.

175
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,634
- You don't hear so good.

176
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,386
We don't want you here.

177
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,472
- You don't own the earth,
not this part of it.

178
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,307
- [McIvers] You stay and
you'll keep only enough of it

179
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:46,517
to bury you in.

180
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:49,437
- I intend to be buried here,

181
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,021
in the 20th century.

182
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,358
- You'll never see a train run through.

183
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,153
- Now you said it.

184
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,408
It took a long time for the
truth to come out, didn't it?

185
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,286
You and McIvers own the whole town

186
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,789
and every head of beef within 500 miles.

187
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,958
But that isn't enough, is it?

188
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,627
You've got to own everything.

189
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:17,631
You can't stand to see anybody else live.

190
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,717
Well, you're going to.

191
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,845
You're going to see a whole new town

192
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,431
right where you're standing.

193
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,266
A town you don't own.

194
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,936
The railroad's sending in people by tens,

195
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,272
twenties, hundreds and thousands.

196
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:35,608
You can't keep them all out!

197
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,401
Tell them, Mr. Andrews.

198
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,695
- I think you put it rather well.

199
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,864
- You're not building no depot here.

200
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,450
- That's for Vienna to decide.

201
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,453
- Vienna decided.

202
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:49,663
Now get out!

203
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:51,916
Get out, all of you!

204
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:55,336
- That's big talk for a little gun.

205
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,588
You can't shoot all of us.

206
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,258
- Two of you will do.

207
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,680
- You don't have the nerve.

208
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,390
- Try me.

209
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,769
- Stop pushing, Emma.

210
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:14,271
- Put down that gun, Vienna.

211
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,773
Put down the gun.

212
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,986
- Down there I sell whiskey and cards.

213
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:25,241
All you can buy up these
stairs is a bullet in the head.

214
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,118
Now, which do you want?

215
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:30,996
- All right, break it up here, men.

216
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,081
Break it up.

217
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,682
- I'm going to kill you.

218
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:51,559
- I know.

219
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,187
If I don't kill you first.

220
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,407
(guns firing)

221
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:14,790
(raucous laughing)

222
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,209
You wanted the Dancin' Kid, Marshal.

223
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:18,460
Here he comes.

224
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,464
(wind roars)

225
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,220
(laughing)

226
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,377
(coughing)

227
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:10,220
(rolling glass)

228
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,868
- Could you spare that smoke, friend?

229
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,378
I'll trouble you for a light, friend.

230
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:54,056
There's nothing like a good
smoke and a cup of coffee.

231
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,352
You know, some men got the
cravin' for gold and silver,

232
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,606
others need lots 0' land
with herds 0' cattle.

233
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,984
And there's those that got the weakness

234
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,194
for whiskey and for women.

235
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,157
When you boil it all down,

236
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,118
what does a man really need?

237
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,162
Just a smoke and a cup of coffee.

238
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,622
- And who are you?

239
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:20,416
- The name, sir, is Johnny Guitar.

240
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,418
- That's no name.

241
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,336
- Anybody care to change it?

242
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:29,299
- I hired you to play the
guitar, not insult my customers.

243
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:30,551
- Well, if these are your customers,

244
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,470
I'm not so sure I'll take this job.

245
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,763
- That's pretty strong talk for a man

246
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,974
who doesn't wear a gun.

247
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,059
- It's also bad manners.

248
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,730
- You must be the Dancin' Kid.

249
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,233
- That's the name, friend.

250
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,818
Care to change it?

251
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,739
- No. No, I like it.

252
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,824
Can you dance?

253
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,659
- [Kid] Can you play?

254
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,587
("Old Joe Clark")

255
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,964
I'm sorry, Emma.

256
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,970
- Where you boys been this afternoon?

257
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,889
- How does that concern you?

258
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:00,140
- Relax, Bart.

259
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,102
Marshal's only trying to do his duty.

260
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,770
- I'm still asking.

261
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,898
- Where were we this afternoon, Corey?

262
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:10,818
- Same place we are every day.

263
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,361
Working in our silver mine.

264
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,529
- What mine?

265
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,989
You got a silver mine, nobody ever saw it.

266
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,658
- Where do you think we get our money?

267
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:21,161
- Stealing. Killing honest
folks that work for theirs.

268
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,913
- That's harsh talk, Mr. McIvers.

269
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:24,331
- You boys don't ranch, you don't farm.

270
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:25,332
You got no business.

271
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,584
Still, you always got
plenty of money to spend.

272
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,504
- I told you, we got a silver mine.

273
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,714
- Maybe you better show
us that silver mine.

274
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,175
- Huh! And have every man within 500 miles

275
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,885
stamping on our necks?

276
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,011
- What is this?

277
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,971
We just did a day's work,

278
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,347
we came in here for a few
drinks and a little cards,

279
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:43,183
like we do every Friday,
isn't that so, Vienna?

280
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,768
- They never miss a Friday.

281
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:47,020
- She's lying, that tramp.

282
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,275
- Anyone else think I'm lying?

283
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,068
- She's one of them.

284
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:56,321
I say string them all up, all of them!

285
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,656
- Me too, Emma?

286
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:02,911
- [Marshal] Jenks, how many
men held up that stage?

287
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,788
- I think there was four.

288
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,206
- Come here, Jenks.

289
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,207
- What for?

290
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,336
- Take a good look at these men.

291
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,713
You recognize any of them?

292
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,923
- I told you, the sun was in my eyes.

293
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,134
- Jenks, you got me and
a dozen men behind you.

294
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,094
You don't have to be
afraid to tell the truth.

295
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,053
- I ain't afraid, Mr. McIvers.

296
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,263
I told you they wore masks.

297
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,223
How could I recognize anybody?

298
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:24,683
- You, come here.

299
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,686
- I got a name, mister.

300
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,229
- I said come here.

301
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,148
- Well, say it nicer.

302
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:34,484
- Don't start anything, go talk to him.

303
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,365
- [McIvers] Where are you from?

304
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:41,450
- Albuquerque.

305
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,951
- You come over the trail this afternoon?

306
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,994
- Uh-huh.

307
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,079
- You see anything?

308
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,664
- [Johnny] Yeah.

309
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,750
Yeah, I saw the stage being held up.

310
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,335
- What?

311
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:52,628
- (chuckles) From high in the mountains,

312
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,004
couldn't make out any details.

313
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:56,131
- Well, why didn't you
ride down and help 'em?

314
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,549
- With what, this?

315
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,842
(strums guitar)

316
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,260
- Where are your guns?

317
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,094
- I don't wear any.

318
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,555
- Maybe you got rid of them
right after the shooting.

319
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,641
- Now, you have a suspicious mind, mister.

320
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,643
- How come you don't go armed?

321
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,771
- Because I'm not the fastest
draw west of the Pecos.

322
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,106
(laughing)

323
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,236
- They're laughing at you.

324
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:21,406
Is that what you came here
for, to be laughed at?

325
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,704
(glass shattering)

326
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,040
- Now listen, everybody.

327
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,834
Listen good, 'cause I'm
only gonna say this once.

328
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,796
In 24 hours, mark it, 24 hours

329
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,257
this is gonna be closed territory.

330
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,341
We got a saloon in town.

331
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,301
We don't need one out here.

332
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,761
I'm passing a law against gambling

333
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,305
and drinking anyplace
outside the town limits.

334
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,598
That law goes into effect

335
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,017
in 24 hours, that's all.

336
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,687
- Well, it was nice meeting you all.

337
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,398
- You don't own this
whole territory, McIvers.

338
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,191
You've got no call asking us to leave.

339
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:59,069
- I'm not asking, I'm telling you.

340
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,488
- Supposing we don't?

341
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,156
- You got 24 hours.

342
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,618
- He can't make his own laws.

343
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:07,452
Tell him, Marshal.

344
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,037
- Now Mac, you know we
can't pass a law like that.

345
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,163
- 24 hours.

346
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,039
- Just a minute, Mac.

347
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,041
- Don't cross me, Marshal.

348
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,918
I give these people fair warning.

349
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:15,752
If they don't pull out,

350
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:19,506
I suggest you go fishing
'til it's all over.

351
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,218
Sounds like the storm's all over, boys.

352
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,303
Let's go.

353
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,972
- Mr. McIvers, I believe you owe me

354
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,224
for one bottle of whiskey.

355
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,145
(paper crackling)

356
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,898
- I don't want to owe you anything.

357
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,695
- Don't you ever forget that, Mr. McIvers.

358
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,239
- Come on, Emma.

359
00:22:56,418 --> 00:23:00,547
- [Emma] And when they go,
you better go with 'em.

360
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,800
- [Driver] Ya!

361
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:10,015
# Oh, her name was Emma
Small, was Emma Small #

362
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,019
(strumming guitar)

363
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,606
- 24 hours, the man said.

364
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,775
Want me to help you pack?

365
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,820
- I threw away my trunk when I came here.

366
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,074
- McIvers has over 30 guns riding for him.

367
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:31,078
What are you gonna hold
him off with, a guitar?

368
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:35,999
- Mr. Guitar?

369
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,167
- Yes, ma'am?

370
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,720
- Still want the job?

371
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:52,057
- Well, a man's gotta
plant roots somewhere.

372
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,018
This seems like a nice, quiet place.

373
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,311
Friendly, too.

374
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:59,648
- (laughs) I like him.

375
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,316
I like you, mister.

376
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,611
Maybe you'd care to work for me.

377
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,947
- Just what is your business, sir?

378
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:07,823
- I'll find one.

379
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:11,618
All you have to do is
play that guitar for me.

380
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,036
- I like the first offer better.

381
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,622
- It's better you work for me.

382
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,251
- Let Mr. Guitar make up his own mind.

383
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,379
- All of a sudden, I
don't like you, mister.

384
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:26,133
- (snickering) Now that makes me real sad.

385
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,969
I always hate to lose a friend.

386
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:32,806
- That's the way it
goes, lose one, find one.

387
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,685
Play something for me, Mr. Guitar.

388
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,353
- Anything special?

389
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,691
- Just put a lot of love in it.

390
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:43,942
- He ain't gonna play so good,

391
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,987
all stretched out on that crap table.

392
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,114
- What's eating the fancy man?

393
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,740
- I don't know. What's your trouble, Kid?

394
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,076
- I'm in no trouble, he is.

395
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,454
Fooling with a strange woman

396
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,081
can bring a man a lot of grief.

397
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,168
- You a strange woman?

398
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,836
- Only to strangers.

399
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,130
- [Kid] What's going on with you two?

400
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,841
- Just what you see, friend.

401
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,802
- Oh, you picked the wrong
place to come to, mister.

402
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,555
- The lady sent for me, not you.

403
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,058
- Heads, I'm gonna kill you, mister.

404
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,728
Tails, you can play her a tune.

405
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,528
- Play me a tune.

406
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,531
(melancholy music)

407
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,137
Play something else.

408
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,392
(upbeat music)

409
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,406
- Play what you was playing before.

410
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,450
- The lady didn't like the tune.

411
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:16,952
- A troublemaker.

412
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:22,332
(off-key chord strikes)

413
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,875
- You want something?

414
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:24,793
- Yeah.

415
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,296
I wanna study you some more.

416
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,464
Have a drink.

417
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,769
- (sighs) Thank you.

418
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:44,938
- Don't go, have another.

419
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:47,482
- No, thanks.

420
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:48,316
- [Bart] Yes, thanks.

421
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,693
- [Johnny] I said no, thanks.

422
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:52,237
- I'm setting 'em up, all
you gotta do is drink 'em.

423
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:55,407
- Maybe, maybe he don't
like your company, Bart.

424
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:59,661
- Yeah, the guit' box man's
fussy who he drinks with.

425
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,707
- Your health, gentlemen.

426
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,337
- Now one more.

427
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,214
- I thank you kindly,
mister, but I had enough.

428
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,383
- I'll say when's enough.

429
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:15,594
Empty it.

430
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,809
- That one slipped.

431
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,311
- When a man can't hold onto a glass,

432
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:28,481
he should drink like
a baby, from a bottle.

433
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,277
Open your mouth, guitar
man, I'll feed you.

434
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,112
- Want me to stop it?

435
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,866
- I don't think so, not just yet.

436
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:41,036
- I said open your mouth, guitar man.

437
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,831
- Outside, please.

438
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,719
Bart, leave your guns.

439
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:24,204
(quick punching)

440
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,998
- Seems I've lost some of my charm.

441
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,833
- [Vienna] All of it.

442
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:34,547
- I always wanted to
shoot me a guitar man.

443
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:38,635
- That's a worthy ambition.

444
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,220
- What's the matter with me?

445
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,388
Now, tell me.

446
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,016
What do you see you don't like?

447
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:48,687
- Nothing, as a matter
of fact, I, I like you.

448
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,148
- But not enough, huh?

449
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,566
- Not that much.

450
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,153
- [Kid] I remember different.

451
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,697
- You remember, I don't.

452
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,741
(loud clattering)

453
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,076
That's the way it goes.

454
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:07,330
(loud shuffling)
(horse whinnies)

455
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,088
(loud thudding)

456
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,594
(wood snapping)

457
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,304
If you're smart, you'll
ride out of here and

458
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:26,641
keep on riding and you won't come back.

459
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,311
- That's what I should do

460
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,480
I never do what I should.

461
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,817
- Well, it's your funeral.

462
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,821
- Don't bury me yet.

463
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:44,951
(stuttering steps)
(playful music)

464
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:50,832
(forceful music)

465
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,752
(loud clattering)

466
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,229
(whimsical music)

467
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,734
- Put him on his horse.

468
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,409
You made a big mistake, mister.

469
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,745
Bart's not a man to forget.

470
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,457
He'll be getting back at you.

471
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,475
Thanks, Vienna, for a real nice time.

472
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,112
- Vienna?

473
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:06,074
- [Vienna] Yes, Turkey.

474
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:12,288
- You know, after what happened today,

475
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:15,917
I don't guess we'll be
seeing you any more.

476
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,171
I'm sure gonna miss you.

477
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,507
- I'm going to miss you a lot, Turkey.

478
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,718
- You know, you've been
about my only friend.

479
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,096
If you're gonna stay here,
you're gonna need somebody to,

480
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,682
sort of, look after you.

481
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,851
So, I'm staying with you.

482
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:37,856
- If you look after me, who's
going to look after you?

483
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,108
- You talk like I was a boy.

484
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,025
I'm a man.

485
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,322
- Every man's entitled to
be a boy for a little while.

486
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,408
You were cheated, Turkey.

487
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,119
- I'll prove to you I'm a man.

488
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,955
(gunshot)

489
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:07,552
(tense music)

490
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:14,142
- That was good shooting,
Turkey, for a boy.

491
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,109
Give me that gun.

492
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,696
(somber music)

493
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,872
You're still gun crazy, aren't you?

494
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,457
- No, I, I thought the
youngster was trying

495
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,376
to shoot up the place.

496
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:26,297
- Frank, Eddie and Sam didn't think so.

497
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:27,840
- I guess I acted a little hasty.

498
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,342
- If I hadn't stepped in front of Turkey,

499
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,427
you would have shot him.

500
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,638
Where are your guns?

501
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,223
- In my saddlebag.

502
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,058
- Suppose you leave them there.

503
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,018
I'll tell you when to use them.

504
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:41,354
- [Johnny] You're the boss.

505
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:46,275
- You haven't changed at all, Johnny.

506
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,486
- [Johnny] What made you think I had?

507
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:51,364
- In five years, a person
should learn something.

508
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,866
- Five years ago, I met you in a saloon.

509
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,618
Now I find you in one.

510
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,829
I don't see much change.

511
00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,914
- Except I own this one.

512
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,544
Come here for a minute.

513
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:07,338
(dramatic music)

514
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,514
Do you know what this is?

515
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,391
- Looks like a lot of towns I've been in.

516
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,685
This town will be here next year.

517
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,311
You can own part of it.

518
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,607
Share and share alike with
Frank, Tom, Eddie and Sam.

519
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:27,734
- Why me?

520
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,569
- Maybe I'll need a gunfighter.

521
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:32,488
- Albuquerque's lousy with gunfighters.

522
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:34,949
- But I sent for Johnny Logan.

523
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,993
- I don't use that name any more.

524
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,703
- Oh, so you changed your name and thought

525
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,913
that would change everything, huh?

526
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,790
- You hired me to do a job.

527
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:46,961
- Is that all you came
here for, to do a job?

528
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:50,048
- No. No, I wanted to see you again.

529
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,342
Heard you had a little luck.

530
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,303
- Luck had nothing to do with it.

531
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,388
- [Johnny] I was being polite.

532
00:34:57,597 --> 00:35:00,058
- I'm not ashamed of
how I got what I have.

533
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:03,144
The important thing is, I've got it.

534
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,232
- That's the way most people look at it.

535
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,694
- Except you, what
right have you to judge?

536
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:13,696
- I once loved you.

537
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:17,116
A man takes a pride in
something he really cares for.

538
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:18,951
He hates to see it trampled.

539
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,121
- A man can lie, steal and even kill,

540
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:25,625
but as long as he hangs on to his pride,

541
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,460
he's still a man.

542
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:28,419
All a woman has to do

543
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:31,089
is slip once and she's a tramp.

544
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:36,010
Must be a great comfort
to you to be a man.

545
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:37,178
- It was more of a comfort to think

546
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,097
that you were waiting for me.

547
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,389
- Did you honestly believe,

548
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:43,935
after five years, I'd be waiting for you?

549
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,687
- Well, I had a long ride
up here from Albuquerque.

550
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,773
I had to think of something.

551
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:49,857
But it kinda was nice to know

552
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:51,442
that we'd be together again.

553
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:54,821
- Well, that's very
generous of you, Mr. Logan.

554
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,531
Is that a proposal?

555
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,741
- A man's gotta stop somewhere.

556
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,077
This seems as good a spot as any.

557
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:03,496
- That's just about the
most touching speech

558
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:06,165
a woman ever listened to.

559
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:07,583
I'm overwhelmed.

560
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:17,301
- Maybe it's rushing it a little but

561
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,095
that's the general idea, isn't it?

562
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,973
- No, Mr. Logan, that
isn't my idea at all.

563
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,057
- [Johnny] Suppose you tell me.

564
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,433
- Oh, it's a sad story.

565
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:26,727
- I listen good to sad stories.

566
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,313
- Five years ago, I loved a man.

567
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,149
He wasn't good, he wasn't bad

568
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:32,567
but I loved him.

569
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,864
I wanted to marry him, to work with him.

570
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:40,741
To build something for the future.

571
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,494
- They should have lived
happily ever after.

572
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:45,913
- They didn't, they broke up.

573
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:50,835
He couldn't see himself
being tied down to a home.

574
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,128
- Looks like the girl did a smart thing

575
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:53,504
in getting rid of him.

576
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:56,299
- She was smart, all right.

577
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:59,468
She learned not to love anybody again.

578
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:01,470
- Five years is a long time.

579
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,183
There must have been quite
a few men in between.

580
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:06,100
- Enough.

581
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,019
- What do you suppose would happen

582
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,188
if this man was to come back?

583
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,441
- When a fire burns itself out,

584
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,776
all you have left is ashes.

585
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:19,906
- I'll do that.

586
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,409
- Thank you.

587
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,954
(solemn music)

588
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:48,809
(bright orchestral music)

589
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,322
(water falling)

590
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:03,259
(suspenseful music)

591
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:07,930
- Why us?

592
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:11,100
Why every time, us?

593
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:13,227
- Why don't you try and figure
out who held up the stage.

594
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:15,563
- There must be a hundred
gangs hiding out in Mexico.

595
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,190
They hit and run and we get the blame.

596
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,567
- [Bart] We got more
than the blame this time.

597
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:22,611
McIvers says we got 24 hours to get.

598
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,406
In case any of you dis-remember.

599
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:26,741
- Our silver mine's all played out.

600
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,243
It wasn't much to begin with.

601
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:32,913
We might as well pull out.

602
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:34,540
- What do you say, Corey?

603
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,542
- The Kid'll tell us what to do.

604
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,794
- [Bart] I asked you
your opinion, Mr. Corey.

605
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,963
- I told you, (coughing)

606
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:44,383
The Kid'll do the telling, Mr. Lonergan.

607
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,473
- Seems like the Kid has
other things on his mind.

608
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:51,515
- Meaning what?

609
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:52,641
- [Bart] Vienna.

610
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,226
You're still soft on her.

611
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,645
That's what's keeping us all here.

612
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:58,481
- You wanna go, go.

613
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,441
- You can't stay without a fight.

614
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,651
McIvers don't make small talk.

615
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,862
- It seems you lost your
taste for fighting, Bart.

616
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,697
- Depends on what I'm fighting for.

617
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:08,324
- [Kid] Sit down.

618
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:10,701
- And no woman's worth it.

619
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,037
- [Kid] You really think so, uh?

620
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,207
- I've known plenty, they're all the same.

621
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,124
No good.

622
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:21,045
- You know, you and Emma
would make a fine couple.

623
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:21,962
Yeah.

624
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,633
- What do you mean?

625
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,094
- Bart, you don't drink, you don't smoke.

626
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,262
You're mean to horses.

627
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,430
What do you like?

628
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,848
- Me. I like me.

629
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:37,061
And I'm taking good care of me.

630
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:40,606
- Maybe you're right, Bart.

631
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:43,776
This dust and sand is
bad for Corey's lungs.

632
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:44,693
Here.

633
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:47,863
How'd you like to come
home with me, Corey?

634
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:49,365
- Where's your home?

635
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:50,574
- New York.

636
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:53,035
- New York? I've been there.

637
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,370
Stinks of fish.

638
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,080
(laughs)

639
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,916
- And where you come
from don't stink, much.

640
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,210
- Well, let's decide,
we've gotta go some place.

641
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:02,420
- [Bart] I know of a place.

642
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:03,921
- I just decided.

643
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,383
We're going to California.

644
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,884
- The horses won't last.

645
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:11,137
- We'll buy fresh horses on the way.

646
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:13,472
- Did I hear you say buy?

647
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:16,308
- That's right, only idiots steal horses.

648
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,644
- [Bart] With what are we
gonna buy these fresh horses?

649
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:21,939
- With gold, Mr. Lonergan, with gold.

650
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:23,649
- We haven't any gold.

651
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:24,608
We hardly got enough silver

652
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:27,153
to plug up the holes in Bart's teeth.

653
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:30,239
- We stay around here,
we'll wind up hanging.

654
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:34,535
I hate to be run out for
something we didn't do.

655
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,412
So let's do something.

656
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,123
Something they can hang us for.

657
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:41,083
Mm, that's only justice, ain't it?

658
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,711
- Sounds like justice to me.

659
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,380
(somber music)

660
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,577
(wheel clattering)

661
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:38,599
- Having fun, Mr. Logan?

662
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,518
- I couldn't sleep.

663
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:42,436
- That stuff help any?

664
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:46,440
- Makes the night go faster.

665
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,986
What's keeping you awake?

666
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:51,904
- Dreams.

667
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:55,491
Bad dreams.

668
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:02,122
- Yeah, I get 'em sometimes, too.

669
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:12,258
Here, this'll chase 'em away.

670
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:15,928
- I tried that, didn't
seem to help me any.

671
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:27,356
- How many men have you forgotten?

672
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,034
- As many women as you've remembered.

673
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:43,664
- Don't go away.

674
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:46,875
- I haven't moved.

675
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,962
- Tell me something nice.

676
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,756
- Sure, what do you want to hear?

677
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:55,092
- Lie to me.

678
00:43:56,468 --> 00:44:00,347
Tell me all these years
you've waited, tell me.

679
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:03,809
- All these years I've waited.

680
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:07,479
- Tell me you'd have died
if I hadn't come back.

681
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:10,649
- I would have died if
you hadn't come back.

682
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:14,403
- Tell me you still
love me like I love you.

683
00:44:15,404 --> 00:44:18,365
- I still love you like you love me.

684
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:24,288
- Thanks.

685
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:26,373
Thanks a lot.

686
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:28,083
(loud crashing)

687
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:30,919
- Stop feeling so sorry for yourself.

688
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:32,463
You think you had it rough.

689
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,381
I didn't find this
place, I had to build it.

690
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,133
How do you think I was able to do that?

691
00:44:36,342 --> 00:44:38,052
- I don't wanna know.

692
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,220
- But I want you to know.

693
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:46,352
For every board, plank
and beam in this place--

694
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,853
- I heard enough.

695
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:51,899
- No, you're going to listen.

696
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,526
- I told you, I don't wanna know any more.

697
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,738
- You can't shut me up, Johnny.

698
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:58,906
Not any more.

699
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:06,330
Once I would have crawled
at your feet to be near you.

700
00:45:16,674 --> 00:45:19,426
I searched for you in every man I met.

701
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:23,597
- Look, Vienna, you just
said you had a bad dream.

702
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:26,058
We both have, but it's all over.

703
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,393
- Not for me.

704
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:30,270
- It's just like it was five years ago.

705
00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:32,523
Nothing's happened in between.

706
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:33,565
- Oh, I wish--

707
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,025
- Not a thing.

708
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:39,279
You've got nothing to tell
me 'cause it's not real.

709
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:42,741
Only you and me, that's real.

710
00:45:44,702 --> 00:45:47,454
We're having a drink at the
bar in the Aurora Hotel.

711
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:48,914
The band is playing, we're celebrating,

712
00:45:49,123 --> 00:45:49,873
'cause we're getting married.

713
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,583
And after the wedding, we're
getting out of this hotel

714
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:52,376
and we're going away.

715
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:56,630
So laugh, Vienna and be
happy, it's your wedding day.

716
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,218
- I have waited for you, Johnny.

717
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:07,558
What took you so long?

718
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:20,946
(pleasant music)

719
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,170
Good morning.

720
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,504
- Good morning.

721
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:42,551
- Well, what are we waiting for?

722
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,552
- Where are we going?

723
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:44,470
- To town.

724
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:04,281
- Like the man said, all a
fella needs is a cup of coffee

725
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:06,825
and a good smoke.

726
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:09,995
(whimsical music)

727
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:12,831
(peaceful music)

728
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:19,671
- [Johnny] Up, ho.

729
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:47,991
(rattling door)

730
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,327
(knocking)

731
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,040
- Bank's closed, Vienna.

732
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:57,376
- [Vienna] Why? It's no holiday.

733
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:00,254
- There all down at the cemetery
for Mr. Small's funeral.

734
00:48:00,462 --> 00:48:02,214
- That still doesn't make it a holiday.

735
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:03,549
It's ten o'clock Saturday morning

736
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:05,300
and I want my money.

737
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:10,222
Wait here.

738
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,139
- Mm-hm.

739
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:19,022
- [Ned] I guess we can
accommodate you, Vienna.

740
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:20,524
- Thank you, Ned.

741
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,446
- [Ned] Why are you closing your account?

742
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:30,117
- Now that Len's gone, I'm
not doing business with Emma.

743
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:32,202
- [Ned] Do you want it in gold or notes?

744
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:33,620
- Notes will do.

745
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:48,135
(wagon rumbling)
(horses clomping)

746
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:20,834
(knocking)

747
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:22,252
- [Ned] No one else, Jake.

748
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:24,588
(knocking)

749
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:30,218
- Bank's closed, son.

750
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:31,219
- [Turkey] I wanna make a deposit.

751
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:32,512
- [Jake] Now, come back in an hour.

752
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:33,889
- [Turkey] Well, can
I leave this with you?

753
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,475
I don't wanna carry it around.

754
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:38,644
- Hand it over.

755
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:41,021
(scuffling)

756
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:50,822
(tense music)

757
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:54,159
- [Kid] Stay where we can see you, Ned.

758
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:07,631
- Well, looks like I
got me a front-row seat

759
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,174
at the show, huh?

760
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:12,594
- Want to be a hero or stay alive?

761
00:50:12,803 --> 00:50:15,055
- I got a lot of respect for a gun.

762
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,516
Besides, I'm a stranger here myself.

763
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:21,061
- Unhitch the horses and keep him covered.

764
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:23,063
Help Corey!

765
00:50:27,693 --> 00:50:28,819
- Got a gun?

766
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,821
- No, not this morning.

767
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:35,033
You didn't tell 'em what happened, eh?

768
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:39,746
(laughs)

769
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:44,626
- You picked a bad time
to do business, Vienna.

770
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:46,336
- You must be crazy.

771
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:48,672
Now they will hang the
stage killing on your neck.

772
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,840
Call your men off and get out of here,

773
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,425
no one will know.

774
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:55,053
Ned, tell him you'll forget about it.

775
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:57,848
- I promise you, Kid, no one'll know.

776
00:50:58,056 --> 00:51:01,059
- But I want 'em to know and to remember.

777
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:02,728
I'm gonna leave this town so broke,

778
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:04,980
they'll never forget the Dancin' Kid.

779
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:07,107
- Emma will never let
you get away with it.

780
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,985
You don't know her, I do.

781
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:11,194
- Hurry it up in there.

782
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:13,280
That funeral ain't gonna last all day.

783
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:16,491
- Listen to me, so far,
you've done nothing wrong.

784
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,244
- You heard McIvers, we gotta go.

785
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:21,997
But we ain't going empty-handed.

786
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:26,752
- He told me to go, too.

787
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,712
But I'm staying.

788
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,756
Give this up and you won't have to go.

789
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:33,133
- And what have I got to stay for?

790
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,843
- What would make you give this up?

791
00:51:35,052 --> 00:51:38,180
- You. And if I give this
up, could I hold on to you?

792
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:39,347
For how long?

793
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,060
- Sorry, Kid.

794
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:45,604
- What's taking you two so long?

795
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:47,773
(dramatic music)

796
00:51:47,981 --> 00:51:49,066
You can't stop me, Vienna.

797
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:49,900
- I'm going to.

798
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:51,193
- [Kid] Don't try.

799
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:52,235
- You'll have to shoot.

800
00:51:52,444 --> 00:51:54,029
- [Kid] I will. Keep 'em up, Ned, high.

801
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:55,947
Don't push me, Vienna.

802
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:00,952
Time's up, let's go.

803
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,259
Bart!

804
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:18,136
- I was only gonna wing him
so he couldn't follow.

805
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:21,640
- Yeah, I know, he's not going to follow.

806
00:52:27,813 --> 00:52:28,605
Yee-ha!

807
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:02,931
- Now where to?

808
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,933
- Let's go home.

809
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:08,061
- (whip cracking) Come on.

810
00:53:08,228 --> 00:53:11,189
Was I dreaming or did I
just see a bank held up?

811
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:12,816
- The Kid's no bank robber.

812
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:15,569
McIvers forced his hand
by giving him 24 hours.

813
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:16,987
- McIvers didn't put a gun in his hand

814
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,029
and wheel him up to the bank.

815
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:19,739
That was the Kid's idea.

816
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:21,658
- I tried to stop him.

817
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:24,369
- Who's going to believe that?

818
00:53:24,578 --> 00:53:25,453
- Don't you?

819
00:53:27,122 --> 00:53:28,248
- What I think doesn't matter.

820
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,666
- It does to me.

821
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,419
What are you thinking?

822
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:34,629
You and the Kid, hitting
the bank at the same time,

823
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:36,214
that don't look good.

824
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:38,383
He didn't take your money, did he?

825
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:39,634
No, he didn't.

826
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,346
This is all Emma needs.

827
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:44,764
Why does she hate you so?

828
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:46,349
- She's in love with the Kid.

829
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,435
- Last night, she was trying
awful hard to get him hung.

830
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:52,439
- He makes her feel like a
woman and that frightens her.

831
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:53,648
- By now, Emma's all worked up

832
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:55,066
and she's started on the others.

833
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,735
We've gotta get out and get out fast.

834
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:57,819
- Where do we go?

835
00:53:58,028 --> 00:53:59,279
- We can't worry about that now.

836
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:03,241
We'll keep going until
we're out of the valley.

837
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:05,493
- I still want to go home.

838
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,841
(all shouting at once)

839
00:54:24,346 --> 00:54:25,972
- It's a rough climb over those mountains.

840
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:28,058
- It's the only way out.

841
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:31,853
- We'd make better time
through the desert.

842
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:33,271
- Look, Corey, once we're into it,

843
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,149
the closest water hole is 400 miles.

844
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:37,484
I'm not chancing it.

845
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:42,239
- Maybe we oughta split
the money and separate.

846
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:44,741
- [Kid] We're riding together.

847
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,743
- What about it, Corey?

848
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,247
- We're riding together.

849
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,669
' [Turkey] So let's go!

850
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:11,268
(horses clomping)

851
00:55:17,941 --> 00:55:20,652
(water splashes)

852
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:25,365
- They took it all. All of it.

853
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:27,409
- The Kid and his bunch.

854
00:55:27,617 --> 00:55:28,702
- And Vienna.

855
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:30,328
- No, Vienna tried to stop him.

856
00:55:30,537 --> 00:55:31,538
- She's one of them.

857
00:55:31,705 --> 00:55:32,664
- I tell you, she wasn't.

858
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:33,748
- She was here, wasn't she?

859
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:34,582
- Yes, but--

860
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:36,501
- Jake, Vienna got you

861
00:55:37,669 --> 00:55:40,130
to unlock the door, didn't she?

862
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:41,381
- Yeah, but they came later.

863
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,717
- How much later, a minute?

864
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:48,346
They planned this thing from
the very beginning, together.

865
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:49,889
You come with me, Jake.

866
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:53,310
We're gonna bring every cent of it back.

867
00:55:57,314 --> 00:56:00,525
And Vienna was one of them, understand?

868
00:56:05,655 --> 00:56:07,407
- Well, I did see him kiss her.

869
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:10,160
(ominous music)

870
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,473
(rushed music)

871
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,184
- Here, take a gun.

872
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:37,937
We won't need you, Emma.

873
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:38,772
- I'm coming along.

874
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,773
- You'll only be in the way.

875
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,066
- It's my money they got.

876
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:41,941
I'm going after it.

877
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,360
- They got a lot of my money, too, Emma.

878
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:44,861
The marshal's right,
you'll only slow us up.

879
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,613
- I'm riding with you.

880
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,239
And I'll be riding first.

881
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:50,992
(anxious music)

882
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:17,894
(tense music)

883
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:23,608
(horses clomping)

884
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:32,158
- [Kid] Hyah!

885
00:57:43,128 --> 00:57:45,004
- [Man In Red] Hey you!

886
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:50,260
(echoing drowns out speech)

887
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:59,018
(loud blasting)

888
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:21,666
- They're closing the pass.

889
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:25,920
If you're thinking of
running, it's a little late.

890
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:27,881
I've got a hunch the posse will be

891
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:31,009
dropping in on you before night.

892
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:33,052
Same people who paid
you a visit yesterday,

893
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:35,346
only they won't be the same.

894
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:36,431
A posse isn't people.

895
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,766
I've ridden with 'em and
I've ridden against 'em.

896
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,101
A posse is an animal.

897
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:41,603
It moves like one and thinks like one.

898
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:43,396
- They're men with itchy
fingers and a coil of rope

899
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:46,733
around their saddle horns,
looking for somebody to hang.

900
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,859
And after riding a few hours,

901
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:50,695
they don't care much who they hang.

902
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:53,031
You haven't told me a thing I don't know.

903
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:54,240
- I haven't finished.

904
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:56,284
- Finish, but be brief.

905
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:58,411
- A posse feels safe because it's big.

906
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,205
They only make a big target.

907
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:02,457
I can ride around and pick off a few.

908
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:03,875
The rest of 'em will lose their guts,

909
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:07,337
turn tail, break up, and go home.

910
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:10,507
- I hired you for protection.

911
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:12,217
I won't have any killing.

912
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,260
- What do you think they're
coming to do to you?

913
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:16,262
Make up your mind, to stay is to fight.

914
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:17,597
(loud blasting)

915
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:19,516
- I'm going to stay.

916
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:22,185
I'm going to fight but I won't kill.

917
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:24,020
- To fight, you've got to kill.

918
00:59:24,229 --> 00:59:25,647
I don't know any other way.

919
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:27,398
- You are gun crazy.

920
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:33,279
You'll never be any different.

921
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:38,493
It was a mistake to send for you, Johnny.

922
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:42,872
You can pick up your pay now.

923
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,793
(blasting)

924
00:59:48,253 --> 00:59:51,172
(treacherous music)

925
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:55,218
- [Bart] Hyah!

926
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:00,974
(loud blasting)

927
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:07,897
You and your smart ideas!

928
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:11,401
(repeated loud blasting)

929
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,914
(horses neighing)

930
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:46,894
(loud blasting)

931
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,831
(horse sputters)

932
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:16,341
- (panting) I'm all right.

933
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,054
Help me on my horse.

934
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:27,393
(loud blasting)

935
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:32,106
- [Bart] We're not gonna get through that.

936
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:33,066
- [Corey] ls there another pass?

937
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:33,900
' [Kid] No.

938
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:34,984
- [Bart] If we ditch the horses.

939
01:01:35,193 --> 01:01:36,361
- [Kid] We'll never make it on foot.

940
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:37,612
- [Corey] Then we'll
have to try the desert.

941
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,447
We can't stay here.

942
01:01:39,656 --> 01:01:40,615
- We'll go back to the lair.

943
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:42,033
- [Bart] What?

944
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:43,076
- We'll be safe there.

945
01:01:43,284 --> 01:01:44,827
Maybe we can't get out,
but they can't get in.

946
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:46,287
- It's like walking into a trap.

947
01:01:46,496 --> 01:01:47,955
- Well, what's your idea, Mr. Lonergan?

948
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:49,707
- I said we should have
taken a desert route.

949
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:52,418
- [Kid] That was before. I'm asking now.

950
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:55,171
(loud blasting)

951
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:14,399
- Treat, you and your men
cover the desert trail.

952
01:02:17,944 --> 01:02:20,822
The rest of you boys, come with me.

953
01:02:28,496 --> 01:02:31,374
(horses galloping)

954
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:00,153
- You each have enough money to stake you

955
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:03,197
for six months, wherever you go.

956
01:03:03,406 --> 01:03:06,075
If I'm still here by then,
I'll expect you back.

957
01:03:06,284 --> 01:03:08,870
You'll each have a share, like I promised.

958
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,288
If I'm not here,

959
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:13,833
just keep wheeling and dealing.

960
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:17,670
The 24 hours aren't up yet.

961
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:18,713
If you run into the posse,

962
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:20,798
they'll let you through.

963
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:23,468
You'd better get started.

964
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:24,802
- Good luck, Vienna.

965
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,387
- See you, Vienna.

966
01:03:28,097 --> 01:03:28,890
- Eddie.

967
01:03:34,187 --> 01:03:38,149
This is for Tom, find him
and take him with you.

968
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:46,741
Mr. Logan.

969
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,879
That's for your trouble.

970
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,720
Vienna's is closed, Mr. Logan.

971
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:12,099
(somber music)

972
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:27,949
(ominous music)

973
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,503
(limb snaps)

974
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:50,847
(urgent music)

975
01:04:57,395 --> 01:05:00,189
(horses clomping)

976
01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:10,741
(water rushing)

977
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:19,125
- Where's Turkey?

978
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,084
- Well, he was right behind me

979
01:05:20,293 --> 01:05:21,669
when we came over the bridge.

980
01:05:21,878 --> 01:05:25,923
- Then he's somewhere between
here and Vienna's, come on.

981
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:39,186
Turkey must've passed
out, we gotta go back.

982
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:40,396
- We can't go looking now!

983
01:05:40,605 --> 01:05:41,689
- We gotta find him before they do.

984
01:05:41,898 --> 01:05:43,566
- These woods are gonna
be full in a minute.

985
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:44,609
We'd better get inside and quick.

986
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,861
- We go back for Turkey, they
cut us off from the lair.

987
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:47,987
We got no place to hide.

988
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:48,988
- How does that help Turkey?

989
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:50,156
- He took his chances.

990
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,116
- Kid, it could have been any one of us.

991
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:54,577
Besides, he's better off alone.

992
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:56,704
- You two go in, I'll look for him.

993
01:05:56,913 --> 01:05:58,539
- You're coming with us.

994
01:05:58,748 --> 01:06:00,750
- Take your hand off.

995
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:04,128
- You said we ride together, remember?

996
01:06:04,337 --> 01:06:06,464
- Bart's right, Kid.

997
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:08,007
We gotta stick together.

998
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:11,928
Turkey'll have to make
it back as best he can.

999
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:33,866
(water splashes)

1000
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:38,079
- They couldn't get through the mountains.

1001
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:40,623
That fancy engineer said the
redhead Turkey got hurt trying.

1002
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:41,832
- Let's go to Vienna's.

1003
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,209
- Now, why should they go there?

1004
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:44,085
Hey, Pete.

1005
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:46,379
- We're wasting time.

1006
01:06:46,587 --> 01:06:48,589
- You just can't push
these men, Emma, wait.

1007
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:50,466
- We gotta get to Vienna's.

1008
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:51,968
- The men aren't ready yet.

1009
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:54,136
- Well, get 'em ready or let me do it.

1010
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:55,930
- My men are not killers.

1011
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:59,100
They gotta be cold, tired and
hungry before they get mad.

1012
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:01,018
- How long does that take?

1013
01:07:01,227 --> 01:07:03,187
- You've got five years of mad in you.

1014
01:07:03,396 --> 01:07:05,314
You can give them another five hours.

1015
01:07:05,523 --> 01:07:07,358
- There's no signs of
them trying the desert.

1016
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:08,609
They've holed up somewhere.

1017
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:10,778
- Probably in that place
they call their silver mine.

1018
01:07:10,987 --> 01:07:11,946
- [Marshal] Anyone of you men have an idea

1019
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:13,239
where that mine is?

1020
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:16,117
- I watched 'em leave Vienna's,
they followed this creek.

1021
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:18,536
Then the camp's gotta be between
Vienna's and Furnace Ridge,

1022
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:20,788
'cause there's nothing beyond
the ridge, I know that.

1023
01:07:20,997 --> 01:07:22,832
- If they got a camp
up there, I'll find it.

1024
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,166
I know this stream good.

1025
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:26,627
I've panned every inch of it, let's go.

1026
01:07:26,836 --> 01:07:29,088
- Hey now, wait a minute,
boys, I got a better idea.

1027
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:31,549
- Wait, I'll say when and
I'm not saying it yet.

1028
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:33,009
All right, Lou, you
know this country better

1029
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:34,468
than anybody else.

1030
01:07:34,677 --> 01:07:35,970
Go ahead, we'll follow you.

1031
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:36,804
Come on.

1032
01:07:37,013 --> 01:07:38,347
- Wait a minute.

1033
01:07:38,556 --> 01:07:41,517
(apprehensive music)

1034
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:05,416
- Hey, someone's coming!

1035
01:08:10,963 --> 01:08:13,257
- [Voiceover] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1036
01:08:13,466 --> 01:08:15,092
(horse whinnies)

1037
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:16,719
- [Marshal] Hold that horse steady.

1038
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,846
- [Voiceover] Hey, that's
one of their horses.

1039
01:08:19,055 --> 01:08:20,848
- Yeah, looks like they never
got to where they're going.

1040
01:08:21,057 --> 01:08:22,641
- Well, one of 'em didn't make it.

1041
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:24,226
- Find him and you'd find 'em all.

1042
01:08:24,435 --> 01:08:27,813
- The only place between
here and town is Vienna's.

1043
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:31,734
Reckon maybe you been
right all along, Emma.

1044
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:34,820
- Of course I was right
but you wouldn't listen.

1045
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:37,823
None of you, the last time, either.

1046
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:40,910
There wouldn't have been any bank hold-up,

1047
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:42,620
the stage wouldn't have been robbed,

1048
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:45,247
my brother wouldn't have been killed.

1049
01:08:45,456 --> 01:08:48,209
I've been right about that
woman ever since she came.

1050
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:50,252
I wanted to run her out
before she ever got in

1051
01:08:50,461 --> 01:08:53,422
but you wouldn't listen, none of you.

1052
01:08:54,423 --> 01:08:58,636
The Marshal says he has
to have legal cause.

1053
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:01,722
Mr. McIvers thinks he can do it with talk.

1054
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:04,558
And the rest of you
can't make up your minds.

1055
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:06,602
Well, what are you waiting for?

1056
01:09:06,811 --> 01:09:07,937
You heard her tell how they're gonna

1057
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:09,522
run the rail road through here,

1058
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:12,316
bring in thousands of
new people from the east.

1059
01:09:12,483 --> 01:09:14,235
Farmers, dirt farmers.

1060
01:09:15,486 --> 01:09:18,030
Squatters. They'll push us out.

1061
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:22,660
Is that what you're waitin' for?

1062
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:24,912
(crowd murmuring)

1063
01:09:25,121 --> 01:09:28,040
You're actin' like she's some fine lady.

1064
01:09:28,249 --> 01:09:31,418
And doin' nothin' makes
all of you fine gentlemen.

1065
01:09:31,627 --> 01:09:34,088
Well, she ain't and you're not.

1066
01:09:35,506 --> 01:09:37,800
So you better wake up

1067
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:41,512
or you're gonna find you
and your women and your kids

1068
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,808
squeezed between barbed
wires and fence posts.

1069
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:48,561
Is that what you're waiting for?

1070
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,730
Well, I'm not.

1071
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:54,483
(all murmuring)

1072
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:59,822
- One of you boys better stay here.

1073
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,824
Clem, you stick around.

1074
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:11,167
(hooves clopping)

1075
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,844
(somber music)

1076
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:57,421
- Tom, what are you doing here?

1077
01:10:57,588 --> 01:10:59,465
Why didn't you leave with the others?

1078
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:01,634
- We've got a visitor.

1079
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:04,428
(loud stumbling)

1080
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:13,520
- You shouldn't have come back, Tom.

1081
01:11:13,729 --> 01:11:15,606
- I won't be in the way.

1082
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:17,191
- I can't have anyone here.

1083
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:21,445
- Nobody notices me, I'm
just part of the furniture.

1084
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:28,702
- Why do you think I sent
you away, all of you?

1085
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:43,717
- What are you gonna do with him?

1086
01:11:43,926 --> 01:11:45,219
- I can't keep him here.

1087
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:46,053
(coughs)

1088
01:11:46,262 --> 01:11:47,054
- He can't travel.

1089
01:11:47,263 --> 01:11:49,890
- Then I'll have to turn
him over to the posse.

1090
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:53,352
But they'll hang him, he's just a boy.

1091
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,439
- Boys who play with guns have
to be ready to die like men.

1092
01:11:57,648 --> 01:11:58,315
- Let me take him.

1093
01:11:58,524 --> 01:11:59,608
I'll hide him out in the cottonwoods.

1094
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:02,528
(horses clomping)

1095
01:12:03,696 --> 01:12:04,863
It's too late.

1096
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:08,284
You'll have to turn him over now.

1097
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:10,619
- Help me, help me, Vienna.

1098
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:14,123
(groans)

1099
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:32,933
(gentle piano music)

1100
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,221
- We came for the Kid and his bunch.

1101
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,640
- That's what you said yesterday.

1102
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:15,684
- [Marshal] We came for you, too, Vienna.

1103
01:13:15,893 --> 01:13:16,602
- Why?

1104
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:21,190
I had nothing to do with robbing a bank.

1105
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:23,984
Every man here knows that.

1106
01:13:24,193 --> 01:13:27,071
I don't have to hold up banks.

1107
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:28,864
All I have to do it sit here and wait

1108
01:13:29,073 --> 01:13:30,949
for the rail road to come through.

1109
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:32,993
And that is my intention.

1110
01:13:33,202 --> 01:13:35,746
- What was your business
at the bank this morning?

1111
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:39,375
- If you remember, McIvers
gave me 24 hours to close.

1112
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,878
I drew out my own money, paid off my boys

1113
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:45,172
and I'm closed.

1114
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:49,593
You can't buy a drink or turn a card.

1115
01:13:50,511 --> 01:13:51,929
I'm sitting here in my own house,

1116
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:55,724
minding my own business,
playing my own piano.

1117
01:13:55,933 --> 01:13:58,602
I don't think you can
make a crime out of that.

1118
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:18,789
Are you satisfied they're not here?

1119
01:14:18,997 --> 01:14:20,874
- No! I'm not satisfied.

1120
01:14:23,877 --> 01:14:28,382
If they're not here, she
knows where they are.

1121
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:31,093
Ask her to tell you, Marshal.

1122
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,678
- How would she know?

1123
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:36,432
- She and the Kid spent
a lot of time together.

1124
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,810
They didn't spend all of it here.

1125
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:42,146
He's back in the lair.

1126
01:14:42,354 --> 01:14:45,441
And she knows how to get there.

1127
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:46,525
Now ask her.

1128
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:49,069
- Vienna?

1129
01:14:49,278 --> 01:14:50,988
- I can't help you, Marshal.

1130
01:14:51,155 --> 01:14:53,031
- [Marshal] You mean, you won't.

1131
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,867
- I said I can't.

1132
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:56,952
- Either you side with them or with us.

1133
01:14:57,161 --> 01:14:59,538
- [Vienna] I'm not
taking sides with anyone.

1134
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,540
- You can't stay on the fence no longer.

1135
01:15:01,748 --> 01:15:04,668
It's not just Emma and
McIvers, the men are fed up.

1136
01:15:04,877 --> 01:15:05,878
Show us the way to the lair

1137
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:08,839
and save yourself a lot of grief.

1138
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:11,425
- I gave you my answer, twice.

1139
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:15,554
- We won't take that.

1140
01:15:15,762 --> 01:15:17,806
(piano keys banging)

1141
01:15:18,015 --> 01:15:20,809
- And just what do you think
I've been taking from you?

1142
01:15:21,018 --> 01:15:23,437
Who are you and you and
you to break into my house

1143
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:26,607
with your angry faces and evil minds?

1144
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:30,652
Why do you come here?

1145
01:15:30,861 --> 01:15:32,905
I knew you would, but why?

1146
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,284
I held up no stagecoach,

1147
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:38,785
I robbed no bank.

1148
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:41,788
But you're here again.

1149
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:46,752
I know, and I know you know, I'm innocent.

1150
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,963
Yet you stand there in
your funeral clothes,

1151
01:15:50,172 --> 01:15:54,009
like vultures, waiting for another corpse.

1152
01:15:54,218 --> 01:15:55,928
Why, you miserable, you hypocritical...

1153
01:15:56,136 --> 01:16:00,182
(dramatic music)
(loud crashing)

1154
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:19,451
- Where's the rest of the bunch?

1155
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:22,120
Where are they?

1156
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:25,582
You've got a rope around your
neck, son, you'd better talk.

1157
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:28,001
- It was Vienna's idea, wasn't it?

1158
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,628
Tell us, don't be afraid.

1159
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:30,754
We'll protect you.

1160
01:16:30,963 --> 01:16:33,549
- I got a rope around my neck,
how you gonna protect me?

1161
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:35,467
- Tell us the truth if you want a trial.

1162
01:16:35,676 --> 01:16:37,261
- He's my prisoner, and I'm taking him.

1163
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:39,346
- We're gonna get the
truth out of him first.

1164
01:16:39,555 --> 01:16:42,641
- Vienna got Jake to open
the bank for you, didn't she?

1165
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:44,476
- Come on, Turkey, tell us.

1166
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:46,144
I'll give you my word you won't hang.

1167
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:47,604
- Stop making promises
you can't keep, McIvers.

1168
01:16:47,813 --> 01:16:50,107
- Stay out of this, Marshal.

1169
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:52,109
- Just tell us Vienna
was one of your bunch

1170
01:16:52,317 --> 01:16:53,944
and we'll give you a chance.

1171
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:55,612
- [McIvers] We might even
let you ride out of here.

1172
01:16:55,821 --> 01:16:58,740
- [Emma] You're only a boy,
we don't want to hurt you.

1173
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:00,993
- The truth, son, that's all we want.

1174
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:03,620
- Just tell us she was one of you, Turkey,

1175
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:05,414
and you'll go free.

1176
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:06,665
- [McIvers] Better talk, boy.

1177
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:08,250
You'd better talk.

1178
01:17:10,294 --> 01:17:11,837
- What should I do?

1179
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:15,674
I don't wanna die. What do I do?

1180
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,303
- Save yourself.

1181
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:24,891
- What'll you do to her?

1182
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:28,687
- The law will take its course.

1183
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:32,316
- You don't have to
say anything, just nod.

1184
01:17:32,524 --> 01:17:34,234
Was Vienna one of you?

1185
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:41,074
- Well, was she?

1186
01:17:43,869 --> 01:17:45,245
(sobbing)

1187
01:17:45,454 --> 01:17:47,664
- He's a liar, you scared him into lying.

1188
01:17:47,873 --> 01:17:50,500
(quick smacking)

1189
01:17:56,131 --> 01:17:58,800
- You heard it from
Turkey's own lips, men.

1190
01:17:59,009 --> 01:18:00,552
What are you going to do now?

1191
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:02,012
- What do you say, Mr. McIvers?

1192
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,388
- Hang them!

1193
01:18:03,597 --> 01:18:05,724
- No! No. (gasping)

1194
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:07,476
No, no, no.

1195
01:18:07,684 --> 01:18:09,645
- Let Mr. McIvers say it.

1196
01:18:13,774 --> 01:18:15,567
- Alright, I'm for it.

1197
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:20,155
- Her, too?

1198
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:30,415
- Her, too.

1199
01:18:32,918 --> 01:18:35,045
(sobbing)

1200
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:43,345
- I'll shoot any man that steps up here.

1201
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:45,430
I'm taking Vienna and Turkey to town

1202
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:47,474
and I'm holding 'em for trial.

1203
01:18:47,683 --> 01:18:51,478
- You can take Turkey,
Marshal, but not Vienna.

1204
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:55,023
- Put that gun away, Tom.

1205
01:18:55,232 --> 01:18:57,484
- Not 'til you all get out of here.

1206
01:18:57,693 --> 01:18:58,902
All of you!

1207
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:00,529
(gun fires)

1208
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:02,948
(gun fires)

1209
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:15,919
- Why did you do it, Tom?

1210
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:20,215
- You'd do the same for me.

1211
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:31,268
Look.

1212
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:36,106
Everybody's looking at me.

1213
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:43,447
It's the first time I ever felt important.

1214
01:19:43,655 --> 01:19:46,283
(dramatic music)

1215
01:20:02,007 --> 01:20:04,634
(intense music)

1216
01:20:17,773 --> 01:20:20,484
(glass breaking)

1217
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:28,408
(glass breaking)

1218
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:08,490
(gun fires)
(loud crashing)

1219
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:11,493
(flames crackling)

1220
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:15,789
(ominous music)

1221
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:32,514
(disturbing music)

1222
01:22:13,263 --> 01:22:16,057
(horses clomping)

1223
01:22:30,739 --> 01:22:33,450
(horse whinnies)

1224
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,960
(horse sputters)

1225
01:22:44,169 --> 01:22:45,921
- You said I wouldn't die.

1226
01:22:46,129 --> 01:22:47,088
You promised!

1227
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:51,968
You promised me I wouldn't die.

1228
01:22:52,177 --> 01:22:53,428
You promised.

1229
01:22:53,637 --> 01:22:56,181
Mr. McIvers, you promised.

1230
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:57,682
You said I wouldn't hang.

1231
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:58,475
(quick whipping)

1232
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:00,518
You promised me! Ah!

1233
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:04,022
(frightening drum music)

1234
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:25,335
- Hurry it up, Jenks!

1235
01:23:25,543 --> 01:23:27,671
- You wanna do it yourself?

1236
01:23:28,672 --> 01:23:30,882
This isn't my idea, Vienna.

1237
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:32,759
- Never mind the talk.

1238
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:38,598
Get it over with, Pete.

1239
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:41,476
- What do you say, Mr. McIvers?

1240
01:23:41,685 --> 01:23:42,268
- Maybe we oughta--

1241
01:23:42,477 --> 01:23:44,270
- Maybe we oughta what?

1242
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:46,731
- Nothing.

1243
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:47,649
- Alright.

1244
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:53,822
- I can't.

1245
01:23:55,907 --> 01:23:56,866
Not a woman.

1246
01:23:59,744 --> 01:24:01,121
- It's up to you.

1247
01:24:02,247 --> 01:24:03,039
- Not me.

1248
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:08,503
- I'll give 100 dollars!

1249
01:24:08,712 --> 01:24:11,256
(voice echoing)

1250
01:24:16,011 --> 01:24:19,139
- You'll have to do it yourself, Emma.

1251
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:42,245
(quick whipping)

1252
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:44,914
(urgent music)

1253
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:13,026
(hooves clopping)

1254
01:25:21,951 --> 01:25:24,662
(fire crackling)

1255
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,473
Follow me.

1256
01:26:08,998 --> 01:26:10,917
Why did you come back for me?

1257
01:26:11,126 --> 01:26:12,877
- First chance I ever had to be a hero.

1258
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:14,379
I couldn't pass it up.

1259
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:15,213
Why did you bring--

1260
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:17,090
- There's a mine shaft down here.

1261
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:20,260
It'll take us out on the other side.

1262
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:26,808
(wood thudding)

1263
01:26:27,016 --> 01:26:28,017
- Taking you out of here in that dress

1264
01:26:28,226 --> 01:26:30,353
is like carrying a lantern.

1265
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,275
(wood crashing)

1266
01:26:35,483 --> 01:26:37,402
(fire crackling)

1267
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:38,361
- Vienna!

1268
01:26:38,528 --> 01:26:39,279
- Johnny!

1269
01:26:40,989 --> 01:26:43,867
(flames crackling)

1270
01:27:03,553 --> 01:27:06,264
(flames roaring)

1271
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:27,785
- This place looks pretty
safe, why can't we stay here?

1272
01:27:27,994 --> 01:27:30,663
- They know about this mine.

1273
01:27:30,872 --> 01:27:33,708
When the fire burns down,
they'll come looking.

1274
01:27:33,917 --> 01:27:35,919
- We'd better start thinking
of some other place.

1275
01:27:36,127 --> 01:27:38,504
- I have, but the Kid's there.

1276
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:43,259
- Oh, that's why you brought us here.

1277
01:27:43,468 --> 01:27:45,803
- You and the Kid under the same roof?

1278
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:48,306
How long do you think you'd both be alive?

1279
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:50,225
- Which one are you worried about?

1280
01:27:50,433 --> 01:27:51,851
- What's your guess?

1281
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:52,894
- I only know what I saw.

1282
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:55,063
He didn't act like any stranger.

1283
01:27:55,271 --> 01:27:56,356
(tender music)

1284
01:27:56,564 --> 01:27:58,066
- I never said he was.

1285
01:27:58,274 --> 01:28:00,151
- Or even like a friend.

1286
01:28:00,318 --> 01:28:01,277
- He was more.

1287
01:28:01,486 --> 01:28:03,905
- Now tell me it was all one-sided.

1288
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:04,822
- No.

1289
01:28:07,367 --> 01:28:10,578
No, it wasn't, but I never lied to him.

1290
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:13,706
He knew there was someone else.

1291
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:16,334
There always would be.

1292
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:19,379
Even if you hadn't come back.

1293
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:21,214
- How do I make sure?

1294
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,514
If you're not sure by
now, telling won't help.

1295
01:28:36,312 --> 01:28:40,441
(dynamic music)
(fire roaring)

1296
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,627
(loud crashing)

1297
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:46,966
- Better wait, they may
double back this way.

1298
01:29:48,009 --> 01:29:50,136
(panting)

1299
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:59,520
(fire crackling)

1300
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:10,698
(water rushing)

1301
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:44,148
(horse whinnies)

1302
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:47,318
- That's Turkey's horse.

1303
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:58,454
(water splashing)

1304
01:31:22,103 --> 01:31:24,814
(water spraying)

1305
01:31:41,038 --> 01:31:43,458
It's Vienna and Johnny Guitar!

1306
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:46,919
- [Corey] Tell him to put his hands high.

1307
01:31:49,547 --> 01:31:50,882
- Where's the Kid?

1308
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:53,050
- In the cabin with Bart.

1309
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:05,646
Bart ain't gonna be
happy to see you, mister.

1310
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:11,527
- We're gonna die here, that's for sure.

1311
01:32:11,736 --> 01:32:14,071
They'll find a way in.

1312
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,657
- We'll have a chance
to shoot our way out.

1313
01:32:16,866 --> 01:32:18,409
- Yeah, some chance.

1314
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:23,706
- If you don't like it here,
you can take your cut and get.

1315
01:32:23,873 --> 01:32:27,126
- Oh, no, I'm sticking right with you.

1316
01:32:27,335 --> 01:32:30,004
When I get it, you're
gonna get yours, too.

1317
01:32:30,213 --> 01:32:34,258
- You keep talking, you're
gonna get yours a lot sooner.

1318
01:32:36,511 --> 01:32:37,303
Drop it.

1319
01:32:43,434 --> 01:32:45,311
How'd you get in?

1320
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,854
- Corey let us by.

1321
01:32:48,105 --> 01:32:50,316
- What'd you bring him for?

1322
01:32:51,484 --> 01:32:53,778
- There was a lynching last night.

1323
01:32:53,945 --> 01:32:55,279
He saved my life.

1324
01:32:56,656 --> 01:32:58,074
- Who'd they hang?

1325
01:32:58,282 --> 01:32:58,991
- Turkey.

1326
01:33:00,576 --> 01:33:01,369
- Turkey?

1327
01:33:04,038 --> 01:33:05,414
They hung Turkey.

1328
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,294
And we could have gone back for him.

1329
01:33:10,503 --> 01:33:13,381
- Sure, and we'd all be hanging now.

1330
01:33:14,549 --> 01:33:16,717
You're wishin' it'd been me, uh?

1331
01:33:16,926 --> 01:33:18,469
- You read me like a book.

1332
01:33:18,678 --> 01:33:19,637
- Will you stop it?

1333
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:23,474
You'll both get a chance
to hang soon enough.

1334
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:28,354
- Some dry clothes in there.

1335
01:33:28,563 --> 01:33:29,272
Turkey's.

1336
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,575
- Vienna's a good shot,
she'll come in handy

1337
01:33:40,783 --> 01:33:42,952
when the shooting starts.

1338
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,537
What good is he?

1339
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:47,790
- I didn't come here looking
for trouble, Mr. Lonergan.

1340
01:33:47,999 --> 01:33:52,378
- Bart's the name, all
my friends call me Bart.

1341
01:33:52,587 --> 01:33:54,213
- Thank you, Mr. Lonergan.

1342
01:33:54,422 --> 01:33:55,381
- Cut it out.

1343
01:33:56,382 --> 01:33:58,676
We got enough trouble outside.

1344
01:33:58,884 --> 01:34:01,762
Ain't it time you relieved Corey?

1345
01:34:01,971 --> 01:34:02,722
- Yeah, it's time.

1346
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:05,558
- Well, what are you waiting for?

1347
01:34:22,575 --> 01:34:24,452
I wanna thank you for helping Vienna.

1348
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:26,245
- I didn't do it for you.

1349
01:34:26,454 --> 01:34:28,331
- I didn't think you did.

1350
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:30,124
Mind if I thank you anyway?

1351
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:31,626
- No, not at all.

1352
01:34:32,793 --> 01:34:34,920
You got some dry clothes
that I could put on?

1353
01:34:35,129 --> 01:34:35,838
- In here.

1354
01:34:54,649 --> 01:34:56,859
(coughing)

1355
01:34:58,861 --> 01:35:00,863
- What are you so happy about?

1356
01:35:01,072 --> 01:35:02,698
- Why'd you let the stranger in?

1357
01:35:02,907 --> 01:35:05,743
- I couldn't risk a shot,
there's posse all around.

1358
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:08,663
Besides, if Vienna brought him
along, he must be all right.

1359
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:10,247
- He ain't all right with me.

1360
01:35:10,456 --> 01:35:11,165
- Who is?

1361
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:16,879
Take it up with the Kid,
I'm still riding behind him.

1362
01:35:30,685 --> 01:35:33,312
- Doors are made to knock on.

1363
01:35:33,521 --> 01:35:35,147
(knocking)

1364
01:35:35,356 --> 01:35:36,482
- I'm knocking.

1365
01:35:38,943 --> 01:35:41,195
So it's the Johnny boy, huh?

1366
01:35:41,404 --> 01:35:43,572
- [Vienna] What if it is?

1367
01:35:43,781 --> 01:35:45,700
- I don't like it.

1368
01:35:45,908 --> 01:35:48,619
- [Vienna] Why don't you tell him?

1369
01:35:50,162 --> 01:35:50,955
- I will.

1370
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:57,753
- What are you gonna tell me, Kid?

1371
01:35:57,962 --> 01:36:00,256
- Well, look at Mr. Guitar.

1372
01:36:00,464 --> 01:36:04,009
All dressed up and
looking mighty dangerous.

1373
01:36:05,386 --> 01:36:07,596
- What did you wanna tell me?

1374
01:36:07,805 --> 01:36:11,100
- I'm too scared, now that you got a gun.

1375
01:36:14,979 --> 01:36:17,398
- You'd better lay off him, Kid.

1376
01:36:17,606 --> 01:36:18,941
- I wouldn't hurt him.

1377
01:36:19,108 --> 01:36:21,777
- I wasn't thinking of you hurting him.

1378
01:36:21,986 --> 01:36:23,446
- [Kid] You mean he
might, uh, shoot himself

1379
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:26,782
in the leg, trying to draw? (laughs)

1380
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:29,869
- No. But if I were you,
I wouldn't fool around

1381
01:36:30,077 --> 01:36:31,454
with Johnny Logan.

1382
01:36:37,668 --> 01:36:39,295
- Are you Johnny Logan?

1383
01:36:39,503 --> 01:36:41,547
- That's the name, friend.

1384
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:44,425
Well!

1385
01:36:48,888 --> 01:36:50,014
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Logan.

1386
01:36:50,222 --> 01:36:54,685
- I never shake hands
with a left-handed draw.

1387
01:36:54,894 --> 01:36:55,686
- Smart fella.

1388
01:36:55,853 --> 01:36:57,021
- That's how I keep alive.

1389
01:36:57,229 --> 01:36:59,982
- We have to figure a
way to get out of here.

1390
01:37:00,191 --> 01:37:02,943
Let's try to work together, just once.

1391
01:37:03,152 --> 01:37:05,237
- Anything for a friend.

1392
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:07,782
- Could you spare a little breakfast?

1393
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:10,201
- Sure, sure, help yourself.

1394
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:17,833
- You wouldn't shoot a man in the back?

1395
01:37:18,042 --> 01:37:19,835
- In front of Vienna?

1396
01:37:20,044 --> 01:37:23,422
Why, she'd never forgive such bad manners.

1397
01:37:27,218 --> 01:37:30,513
- You'd better stick to your dancing, Kid.

1398
01:37:30,721 --> 01:37:32,181
You'll live longer.

1399
01:37:37,853 --> 01:37:41,982
(horse neighing)
(intense music)

1400
01:38:18,394 --> 01:38:21,105
(water spraying)

1401
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:34,869
(intense music)

1402
01:38:56,307 --> 01:38:59,018
(water spraying)

1403
01:39:09,069 --> 01:39:11,363
- No! No, Bart, don't shoot!

1404
01:39:12,531 --> 01:39:14,158
I wanna talk to you!

1405
01:39:15,868 --> 01:39:17,536
- Come on in!

1406
01:39:17,745 --> 01:39:19,663
Through the falls. Alone.

1407
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:25,753
- Hold the men.

1408
01:39:26,837 --> 01:39:27,880
I'm going in.

1409
01:39:28,923 --> 01:39:30,382
I can handle Bart.

1410
01:39:33,594 --> 01:39:36,305
(dramatic music)

1411
01:39:45,022 --> 01:39:47,483
- Now, I was real fond of Turkey.

1412
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:49,068
He was a good boy.

1413
01:39:50,861 --> 01:39:53,906
Hanging, hm, that's a mean way to go.

1414
01:39:58,077 --> 01:40:00,287
You couldn't have saved
him, huh, Mr. Logan?

1415
01:40:00,496 --> 01:40:01,914
- I had to make a choice.

1416
01:40:02,122 --> 01:40:02,831
- Yeah.

1417
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:06,126
How'd Turkey take it? Hard?

1418
01:40:06,335 --> 01:40:10,047
- You ever know anyone
to take a hanging easy?

1419
01:40:11,757 --> 01:40:15,344
- How did it feel with that
rope round your neck, Vienna?

1420
01:40:15,552 --> 01:40:17,638
- Try it sometime.

1421
01:40:17,846 --> 01:40:20,432
- What was you thinking?

1422
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:21,684
- I don't know.

1423
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:23,352
- [Kid] Well, you must have
been thinking something.

1424
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,895
- She don't wanna talk about it.

1425
01:40:25,104 --> 01:40:26,814
- I'm asking her, do you mind?

1426
01:40:27,022 --> 01:40:28,607
- Got any eggs?

1427
01:40:28,816 --> 01:40:29,900
- Top shelf.

1428
01:40:30,109 --> 01:40:31,110
- Get them.

1429
01:40:31,318 --> 01:40:34,697
- Let him get them, he's eating 'em.

1430
01:40:34,905 --> 01:40:36,448
Crawling on that bridge
and cutting that rope.

1431
01:40:36,657 --> 01:40:39,702
That was real brave
thing to do, Mr. Logan.

1432
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:42,246
How you gonna thank him, Vienna?

1433
01:40:42,454 --> 01:40:43,872
- He hasn't asked for any thanks.

1434
01:40:44,081 --> 01:40:47,126
- Yeah, but he expects
plenty, don't you, Mr Logan?

1435
01:40:47,334 --> 01:40:48,419
- Sit down, Johnny.

1436
01:40:48,627 --> 01:40:49,837
- Let him stand.

1437
01:40:55,551 --> 01:40:58,554
(sudden snapping)

1438
01:40:58,762 --> 01:41:00,806
Look at him, Vienna.

1439
01:41:01,015 --> 01:41:01,974
Can't wait to shoot me.

1440
01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:03,809
Finger's just itching on the trigger.

1441
01:41:04,018 --> 01:41:06,103
(metal slapping)

1442
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:07,521
Huh. Nice fella.

1443
01:41:10,482 --> 01:41:14,820
You've finally got someone
to do your killing for you.

1444
01:41:15,029 --> 01:41:17,573
That oughta make you real happy.

1445
01:41:22,494 --> 01:41:25,372
(door slamming)

1446
01:41:25,581 --> 01:41:27,041
- Sit down, Johnny.

1447
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:30,502
(solemn music)

1448
01:41:43,557 --> 01:41:46,477
We've both done a lot of living.

1449
01:41:46,685 --> 01:41:50,147
Our problem now is how
to do a little more.

1450
01:41:54,318 --> 01:41:55,027
- [Kid] See anything?

1451
01:41:55,235 --> 01:41:55,861
' [Bart] Nope.

1452
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:59,198
- Bart, keep away from the guitar man.

1453
01:41:59,406 --> 01:42:00,949
- [Bart] Why?

1454
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:02,076
- His name is Johnny Logan.

1455
01:42:02,284 --> 01:42:04,286
(serious music)

1456
01:42:04,453 --> 01:42:06,830
Just thought I'd tell you.

1457
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:08,082
- You told me.

1458
01:42:15,547 --> 01:42:18,050
(door slams)

1459
01:42:18,258 --> 01:42:19,885
- What's up?

1460
01:42:20,094 --> 01:42:21,887
- Plenty, the posse's found a way in.

1461
01:42:22,096 --> 01:42:23,472
Relax, they're still outside.

1462
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:24,765
- And we gotta keep 'em there.

1463
01:42:24,973 --> 01:42:26,642
- Now will you just listen,
I just had a talk with Emma.

1464
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:29,186
She don't want us, she wants
Vienna and the guitar man.

1465
01:42:29,394 --> 01:42:30,521
- [Corey] What about the
bank, the money we took?

1466
01:42:30,729 --> 01:42:31,772
- [Bart] Aw, will you listen!

1467
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,816
Now listen, she'll settle
for half of what we got

1468
01:42:34,024 --> 01:42:36,026
and we get out of here into open country.

1469
01:42:36,193 --> 01:42:36,860
- Did you tell the Kid?

1470
01:42:37,069 --> 01:42:37,778
- No, I didn't tell the Kid.

1471
01:42:37,986 --> 01:42:38,779
- Well, why not?

1472
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:39,571
Why not?

1473
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,490
- Well, if you listen,
I'll tell you why not.

1474
01:42:41,698 --> 01:42:42,950
The Kid is still stuck on Vienna.

1475
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:43,867
He'll never turn her over.

1476
01:42:44,076 --> 01:42:46,161
He'll put up a fight
and get us all killed.

1477
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:47,371
Now I got a better idea.

1478
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:49,414
- Well, I don't like it.

1479
01:42:49,623 --> 01:42:51,291
- You don't like it?

1480
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,459
What don't you like?

1481
01:42:52,668 --> 01:42:53,669
Are you crazy?

1482
01:42:53,877 --> 01:42:54,878
I'm offering you a split and a chance

1483
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:56,338
to get out with a whole skin.

1484
01:42:56,547 --> 01:42:58,966
I'm sticking with the Kid
and you're gonna, too.

1485
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:01,051
- You don't make sense, Corey.

1486
01:43:01,218 --> 01:43:03,262
- I don't like the sense you make, Bart.

1487
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:08,142
I think we ought to have a
talk with the Kid right now.

1488
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:09,768
(sudden disturbing music)

1489
01:43:09,977 --> 01:43:14,022
(coughs)
(clatters)

1490
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:18,777
- Some people just won't listen.

1491
01:43:20,863 --> 01:43:23,031
(serious music)

1492
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:24,533
' [Johnny] Corey!

1493
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:57,274
Kid!
(gun cocking)

1494
01:43:57,482 --> 01:44:00,694
(gun firing)
(urgent music)

1495
01:44:00,903 --> 01:44:01,778
- That's it!

1496
01:44:02,779 --> 01:44:05,490
(water spraying)

1497
01:44:07,743 --> 01:44:08,619
- Let's go!

1498
01:44:11,496 --> 01:44:12,289
Ya!

1499
01:44:16,668 --> 01:44:19,463
(dirt scrambling)

1500
01:44:29,056 --> 01:44:30,641
(gun fires)

1501
01:44:30,849 --> 01:44:33,977
(gun fires repeatedly)

1502
01:44:42,903 --> 01:44:45,197
(gun fires)

1503
01:44:46,448 --> 01:44:48,742
(gun fires)

1504
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:53,747
Lou, I'll tell you when
there's to be any shooting.

1505
01:44:55,832 --> 01:44:59,294
- Looks like something's gone wrong, Emma.

1506
01:45:01,088 --> 01:45:03,799
(sinister music)

1507
01:45:52,139 --> 01:45:54,099
(gasps)

1508
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:02,024
(gun fires)
(glass shatters)

1509
01:46:04,818 --> 01:46:06,653
- I'm coming up, Vienna!

1510
01:46:06,862 --> 01:46:08,697
(voice echoes)

1511
01:46:08,905 --> 01:46:09,614
- I'm waiting!

1512
01:46:09,823 --> 01:46:12,284
(voice echoes)

1513
01:46:15,203 --> 01:46:17,664
(tense music)

1514
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:31,845
(gun fires)

1515
01:46:33,263 --> 01:46:35,390
- Mac, me and the boys had
enough of this killing.

1516
01:46:35,599 --> 01:46:36,975
- So have I.

1517
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:39,353
It's their fight, has been all along.

1518
01:46:39,561 --> 01:46:40,228
Run and tell the others

1519
01:46:40,437 --> 01:46:42,731
there'll be no more shooting.

1520
01:46:44,858 --> 01:46:47,819
(suspenseful music)

1521
01:47:51,425 --> 01:47:53,718
(guns fire)

1522
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:55,929
- Emma!

1523
01:47:56,138 --> 01:47:56,847
- Ah!

1524
01:47:57,055 --> 01:47:59,266
(gun fires)

1525
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,395
(gun fires)

1526
01:48:03,603 --> 01:48:06,273
(gun fires)

1527
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:09,025
(ominous music)

1528
01:48:53,236 --> 01:48:55,780
(gun thudding)

1529
01:48:57,491 --> 01:49:01,620
# Whether you go, whether you stay

1530
01:49:04,372 --> 01:49:06,750
# I love you

1531
01:49:09,961 --> 01:49:13,465
# But if you're cruel

1532
01:49:13,673 --> 01:49:17,052
# You can be kind, I know

1533
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:27,479
# There was never a man like my Johnny

1534
01:49:35,987 --> 01:49:40,116
# Like the one they call Johnny Guitar #

1535
01:49:46,164 --> 01:49:49,042
(regal band music)
