00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,592
( theme music playing )

00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:11,881
Reverend:
MY DARLING WIFE...

3
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,885
( panting )
I HAVE $68 PUT BY--

4
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,891
OUR BELLY CLEAVETH 
TO THE EARTH.

5
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,899
I HOPE TO BE HOME
SOON, AMANDA.

6
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,269
I'’LL HELP WITH
THE CIDER PRESSING.

7
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:38,608
( groaning )

8
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:57,544
OUR SOUL IS
BOWED DOWN TO THE DUST.

9
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,665
TELL JOHNNY TO BREW SOME COFFEE,
OPEN SOME PEACHES.

10
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,024
- AL KNEW THEY WAS COMIN'’.
- WELL, HE KNEW SOMETHIN'’
WAS COMIN'’.

11
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,917
I'’D ABOUT DECIDED HE JUST
COULDN'’T SLEEP WITHOUT TRIXIE.

12
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,799
AM I RIGHT IN BELIEVING
THAT I SAW YOU LAST YEAR
IN THE HILLS?

13
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,069
HE AND HIS MEN WOULD REQUIRE
SOME RESUPPLY AND RESPITE.

14
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,886
I'’LL MAKE YOUR FEELINGS KNOWN
TO THE OTHER OPERATORS.

15
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:11,260
I AND MY FELLOW OFFICERS
WOULD BE GRATEFUL NOW
FOR THE USE OF THE BATHHOUSE.

16
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:16,265
MR. BURNS HERE
WILL STEER YOU.

17
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:25,274
THE CAMP WILL
WANT A PARADE.

18
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:32,498
A PARADE IS ALL RIGHT.

19
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:42,008
UNLESS YOU WANT A GIRL
TO SPONGE YOU WHILE
WE CONVERSE?

20
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,056
THOSE ARE THE DAYS
TO MY FUCKING LEFT.

21
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,574
IT CAN'’T BE DONE.

22
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,013
YOUR MOST VICTORIOUS
SMILE.

23
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,019
I HOPE YOU
CHARGE SOMETHING
FOR YOUR SERVICE.

24
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,866
HI, DOC.

25
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:27,373
THE FUCKIN'’ MAGISTRATE DON'’T
GO BACK TO YANKTON ALIVE.

26
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,468
COMMON ROOM.
SWEEPIN'’.

27
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,475
WHAT YOU GOT
IN YOUR TOTE SACK?

28
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,312
LETTUCE.

29
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,745
ALL RIGHT.

30
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,137
I MAKE THIS STIPULATION.

31
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,020
OF YOUR FUCKING BOOT.

32
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,479
( whispers )
ALL RIGHT.

33
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,879
HERE'’S YOUR GODDAMN BOOT.

34
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,386
HELP ME PUT IT ON.

35
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,676
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

36
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,287
OH, FUCK YOU, AL!

37
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,663
I'’LL SEND SOMEONE OVER
TO PICK HIM UP.

38
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,893
I MADE JEWEL
A BRACE AND A BOOT.

39
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:22,525
I'’M WORKING ON MY DEPLOYMENTS
AND FLANKING MANEUVERS.

40
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,663
HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER ONE?

41
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,450
TRIXIE'’S FINE.

42
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:53,856
TRIXIE?

43
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,814
ARE TRYING
TO WASH OUR SHIRTS
IN GODDAMN FECES!

44
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:46,775
IT DEMANDS CAPITAL.
( chuckles )

45
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,472
GENERATING FROM THE INTEREST
ON THE PREVIOUS DEBTS?

46
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
ALMA...

47
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,518
YOUR SPIRIT TO UNDERSTAND
IS ALWAYS PAINFUL FOR ME.

48
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:10,859
AFTER YOU GOT ME OUT OF DEBT,
I GOT MYSELF BACK IN.

49
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,031
.
MY DAUGHTER BECOMING
A GARRET RAISED ME IN
THE LENDER'’S ESTIMATION

50
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,456
AND CONSIDERABLY MORE.

51
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,294
ALL RIGHT, DADDY.

52
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,392
I'’LL HAVE THAT IN WRITING
BEFORE I HELP YOU.

53
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,934
AND YOU'’LL
HAVE NO SUCH THING.

54
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,110
GET AWAY FROM HER!

55
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:44,620
WHY, THANK YOU, SIR.

56
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,841
( sobbing )

57
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,767
PLUS $2 SOME-ODD
FOR MRS. GARRET TO GIVE
THAT GIRL.

58
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:09,478
( sobbing )

59
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,952
I'’LL GIVE HER
THE MONEY LATER.

60
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,045
SETH.

61
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,857
.
I'’M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP

62
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,041
THEY LOVE--
TO HAVE THEIR
PICTURES TAKEN.

63
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,519
- SHOULD I STAY WITH HER
AT THE STORE?
- PLEASE.

64
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:47,409
AND BILKING YOU LOSE,
NEEDING TO RUB AGAINST
YOUR BETTERS.

65
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,844
FIRST-RATE THINKING.

66
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,275
AND WIDEN SUSPICION
TO INCLUDE YOURSELF?

67
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,995
SHOOT CRAPS,
MR. BULLOCK?

68
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,288
I KNOW WHAT'’S
IN THE TILL.

69
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:40,762
WERE YOU BULLIED, MR. BULLOCK,
WHEN YOUNG AND INCAPABLE?

70
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,733
MY OLFACTORIES ARE KEEN
TO THE SMELL OF SHIT.

71
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,462
AS TO HER COMPLICITY
IN HER HUSBAND'’S MURDER...

72
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
I SUPPOSE YOU'’D BEST
TAKE YOUR SWING.

73
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,936
GENTLEMEN,
WATCH THE FELT.

74
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:43,251
( distant drum corps
playing )

75
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,746
( whispering )
PLEASE...

76
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,916
- SEE TO MY FATHER.
-( marching band playing )

77
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:35,103
( gunshot )

78
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,470
- FUCK THAT MONKEY NOISE!
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!

79
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,856
TAKE JURISDICTION
ON THIS CORPSE!

80
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,579
Man:
BACK OFF, OLD MAN.

81
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,667
( band continues playing )

82
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,724
AT ONCE ATTACKED
FROM ALL FOUR SIDES.

83
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,027
LAST SEEN ON HIS PERSON
WHEN HE RODE INTO BATTLE...

84
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,032
CAPTAIN.

85
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,260
AND NOW RECLAIMED

86
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,135
ARE GONE, DRIVEN OFF.

87
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,238
...TO THE PROGRESS

88
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,340
GOTTA TAKE OFF
THE FUCKING BADGE.

89
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:01,176
NOT CERTAIN I TAKE
YOUR INFERENCE.

90
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,146
.
AND IF I DO,
I'’M NOT SURE I LIKE IT

91
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,190
LEAVE IT THERE,
YOU BOUGHT-OUT
SON OF A BITCH.

92
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:47,439
UM, "THE SIOUX
AND CHEYENNE...

93
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,736
WE'’LL WORK SOMETHING OUT.

94
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,580
BUT, OF COURSE, YOU'’RE
BUYING FOR FULL-GROWN MEN.

95
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,935
I DON'’T THINK
I KILLED HIM.

96
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,532
NOW, THAT'’S THE MESSAGE
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE UPSTAIRS.

97
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:17,288
YOU OUGHT TO PIN THAT
ON YOUR CHEST.

98
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,762
YOU JUST TELL HIM.

99
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,109
OR TO MAKE
YOUR FUCKING WAY?!

100
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,002
( crowd chattering )

101
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,526
YOU WISH YOU
COULD AMEND, SETH.

102
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,533
WHAT KIND OF A MAN
HAVE I BECOME, SOL?

103
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,536
I DON'’T KNOW.

104
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,540
THE DAY AIN'’T
FUCKING OVER.

105
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:08,293
DID I SAY
SOMETHING FUNNY?

106
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,223
THAT COCKSUCKER
CLAGETT'’S BAGMAN.

107
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,698
MODERATION
IN ALL THINGS.

108
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,705
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, SIR.

109
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,628
- Soldier:MUCH OBLIGED.

110
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,753
WHICH WE AIN'’T.

111
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:30,258
ARE WE SURE
WE CAN'’T TEMPT YOU?

112
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,474
CASH COMPENSATION,
UNRECORDED.

113
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,229
MR. BULLOCK.

114
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,527
WHY ARE YOU HERE,
MR. BULLOCK?

115
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,787
- HE NEEDS PROTECTION.
- PROTECTION FROM WHOM?

116
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,350
AND THE CAMP SHERIFF CAN BE
BOUGHT OFF FOR HALF A CAN
OF BACON GREASE.

117
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,634
MAY I HAVE
A WORD, GENERAL?

118
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,006
WE ALL HAVE
BLOODY THOUGHTS.

119
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,935
I QUITE
UNDERSTAND.

120
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,942
.
IF I WERE SHERIFF,
I'’D HAVE YOU HANGED

121
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,113
Joanie:
I BROUGHT THESE.

122
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,673
HI, SWEETHEART.

123
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:13,681
SEEMS HE WILL.

124
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,902
MR. BULLOCK WAS
MY AGENT IN THIS.

125
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:55,773
TILL HE SOLD ME
TO CY TOLLIVER.

126
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,704
OH.

127
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,586
EVENING.

128
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:30,057
( whispers )
GOOD EVENING,
MR. BULLOCK.

129
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:47,024
UM, UH-- SOPHIA.

130
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:54,532
YOU GO WITH MISS STUBBS
FOR DINNER, OKAY?

131
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,782
I'’VE ASKED GENERAL CROOK
TO SEE TO HIS SAFETY.

132
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,242
WE'’LL DEAL
WITH THAT THEN.

133
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:59,980
MARRIED.

134
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,734
YES.

135
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:31,295
IF YOU'’D-- IF YOU WOULD BE
MORE COMFORTABLE BEHIND
THE SCREEN...

136
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,636
( whispers )
WOULDN'’T THAT
DEFEAT OUR PURPOSE?

137
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,680
( sighs )

138
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,896
GIVE YOU TIME
TO MAKE UP WHICH SIDE
YOU'’RE ON, ADAMS.

139
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:18,319
IF THE COCKSUCKER
WOULD EVER SHOW UP.

140
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,640
FOR THAT WHICH I DO,
I ALLOW NOT FOR...

141
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:03,998
BUT SIN THAT
DWELLETH IN ME.

142
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,457
SHUT THE DOOR.

143
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,817
JESUS CHRIST.

144
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,237
TO KNOW YOUR-YOUR--
YOUR OMNIPOTENCE?

145
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:37,424
IT HURTS SO BAD."
( breathing heavily )

146
00:44:58,645 --> 00:45:02,066
THY WILL BE DONE, AMEN.

147
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,077
( moaning )

148
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,889
DEAL OUT DEATH
WHEN CALLED UPON?

149
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,928
( choking )

150
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,247
( choking gasp )

151
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,169
YOU CAN GO NOW,
BROTHER.

152
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,686
I GOT THOSE OTHER TWO GUYS
WAITING UPSTAIRS.

153
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,890

-( piano playing )
-( crowd chattering )

156
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,569
TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN
UPSTAIRS, HUH?

157
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,252
AND HIS BUTLER.

158
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,824
- WHICH HE'’D BE...
- Al: WHEREVER HIS
ALLEGIANCE MAY LAY.

159
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,303
LIVING AS WE ALL DO
IN DOUBT, PLEASE PROCEED.

160
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,442
WILL NO LONGER
WEIGH UPON YOU.

161
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,230
WHAT MAN COULDN'’T
THAT BE SAID ABOUT?

162
00:49:11,732 --> 00:49:14,234
( gagging )

163
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,155
- ( blade slices )
- ( groans )

164
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:36,890
WHEN YOU TAKE THAT 
FUCKING GUN OFF ME.

165
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:46,233
BOTH OF THEM.

166
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,198
NO, I STILL
OWE YOU THE TWO.

167
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:15,595
-( gunshots )
-( bugle playing )

168
00:50:40,654 --> 00:50:43,573
I DON'’T BEGRUDGE HIM
AN UNCOMFORTABLE JOURNEY.

169
00:50:50,163 --> 00:50:52,049
AND AFTER THAT,
HE'’S ON HIS OWN.

170
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:09,349
OR IS THAT ONE OF
YOUR FUCKING HERESIES?

171
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,191
HE PASSED.

172
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:29,536
WAITED TILL I GOT HIM
