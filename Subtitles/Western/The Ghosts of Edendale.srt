1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:08,000
<i>Ten years ago, in the small East African country of Rwanda, 800,000 people were slaughtered by their own government.</i>

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,091
Maj. BRENT BEARDSLEY, Military Ass't to Gen. Dallaire: 
This was ordinary men, women and children,

3
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:15,475
and the only reason that they were killed was because they were Tutsi.

4
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:18,018
<i>Virtually the entire world turned away</i>

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,174
<i>and did almost nothing to stop the genocide.</i>

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,826
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, U.N. Ambassador: 
In retrospect, it all looks very clear.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,315
But at the time, what was happening in Rwanda, the situation was unclear.

8
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:31,235
PHILIPPE GAILLARD, Red Cross: 
They cannot tell me that they didn't know.

9
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:33,817
Everybody knew what was happening.

10
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:40,437
<i>Tonight on FRONTLINE, the full story of perhaps 
the darkest and most brutal tragedy of our time.</i>

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,004
<i>It is a story told by the victims</i>

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,900
<i>and by the killers,</i>

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,737
<i>by those who turned away</i>

14
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:53,104
<i>and by those who stayed and tried desperately 
to save as many people as they could.</i>

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,724
CARL WILKENS, Aid Worker, Adventist Church: 
By the time the genocide was over,

16
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,629
I was so angry

17
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:01,575
at America,

18
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:03,500
America the beautiful, America the brave.

19
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,613
<i>They are all still haunted by what happened--</i>

20
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:11,500
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE, U.N. Force Commander, Rwanda: 
I was the commander, and hundreds of thousands of people died.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,675
I can't find any solace in statements like, "I did my best."

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,521
<i>--still haunted by the Ghosts of Rwanda.</i>

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
GHOSTS OF RWANDA

24
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:55,801
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
Rwanda will never, ever leave me.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,193
It's in the pores of my body.

26
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:08,000
My soul is in those hills. My spirit is with the spirits of all those people who were slaughtered and killed that I know of.

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,366
And lots of those eyes still haunt me,

28
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,525
angry eyes or innocent eyes.

29
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:17,292
No laughing eyes.

30
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:24,421
But the worst eyes that haunt me are the eyes of those 
people who were totally bewildered.

31
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:27,292
They're looking at me, with my blue beret,

32
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:31,955
and they're saying, "What in the hell happened?

33
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:34,513
"How come I'm dying here?"

34
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:40,986
Those eyes dominated,

35
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:44,527
and they're absolutely right.

36
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:49,303
How come I failed?

37
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,439
How come my mission failed?

38
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:59,000
How come, as the commander, I did not convince,

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,676
I lost soldiers,

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,505
and 800,000 people died?

41
00:03:23,513 --> 00:03:31,033
August 1993

42
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:46,038
<i>For General Romeo Dallaire, commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda,</i>

43
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,590
<i>it was his first trip to Africa.</i>

44
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:59,937
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
You know, the first breath of air of Africa--

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,050
oh, what a-- what a phenomenal experience!

46
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,940
It's-- it felt like you were in another continent, that you were-- 
you were-- it was different.

47
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:23,659
Felt a little nervousness, of course, you know, of the first shaking hands with --

48
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:29,518
with those leaders and starting up the mission.

49
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:36,818
<i>For Dallaire, a Canadian general who had never seen action, 
this was the command of a lifetime,</i>

50
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:39,222
<i>a U.N. peacekeeping mission</i>

51
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:42,534
<i>in the heart of Africa.</i>

52
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,723
<i>His job seemed simple.</i>

53
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:51,923
<i>He would enforce a peace agreement between 
the Rwandan government in Kigali</i>

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,926
<i>and a rebel army positioned behind a ceasefire line.</i>

55
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:02,501
<i>The rebels were mostly Tutsis,</i>

56
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:06,195
<i>an ethnic minority that had been persecuted for decades.</i>

57
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:12,074
Gen. PAUL KAGAME, Cmndr, Rwandan Patriotic Front: 
Some of us had been refugees since 1959.

58
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:20,016
And over the years, in the early '60s and '70s, there had been killings 
of Tutsis from different parts of Rwanda.

59
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:25,917
So we mainly focused on the very fact that there was a 
need for change in the country

60
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:29,018
and that these stateless people, ourselves,

61
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,069
who were everywhere in the neighboring countries and beyond,

62
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,319
needed to come back home.

63
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:46,245
<i>The rebel threat had heightened tensions between Tutsis 
and the ethnic majority, the Hutus.</i>

64
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:52,847
<i>The Hutus had ruled since independence from Belgium in the early '60s.</i>

65
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,220
<i>Under the U.N.-backed peace accord, the Hutus would be 
forced to share power with the Tutsi rebels.</i>

66
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>But the peace process was already faltering,</i>

67
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:18,161
<i>even as General Dallaire set up his command center in a rundown Kigali hotel.</i>

68
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:28,892
<i>With only 2,500 lightly-armed troops, he was ill-prepared to enforce a 
fragile peace in a country he did not understand.</i>

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,846
Maj. BRENT BEARDSLEY, Military Ass't to Gen. Dallaire: 
We had very, very little information, knowledge of the background to Rwanda,

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,542
its history, its culture, the-- you know, what had taken place in the country 
since independence or even before independence,

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,445
and especially even in the last couple of years. 
So, we went in quite blind.

72
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,100
<i>From the moment he arrived, someone was testing 
Dallaire's ability to keep the peace.</i>

73
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:03,042
<i>There were mysterious riots and assassinations.</i>

74
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:13,821
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: And-- and also, we were already getting all these stories 
about a third force, you know, of-- squadrons of killers.

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And we couldn't confirm anything. 
We were just getting all that, you know, as rumors, innuendoes,

76
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:26,292
and we couldn't cross-check the damn stuff 
because I was not allowed to have an intelligence capability.

77
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:32,462
So all that sort of-- sort of came as a dark cloud.

78
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,580
Ultimately, I-- I felt we could do it.

79
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:43,942
But that is a bravado, I think, also, from my part.

80
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:47,645
Nothing was going to stop me.

81
00:07:59,385 --> 00:07:51,885
Bit of innocence in there, eh?

82
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:58,884
January 1994

83
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:07,625
<i>Then, from inside the third force, an informant emerged.</i>

84
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:14,212
<i>The informant revealed that a secretive group of Hutu extremists 
was plotting to derail the peace agreement</i>

85
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:16,837
<i>and exterminate their enemies.</i>

86
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:23,037
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
And he was within the higher structures of the MRND party,

87
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:26,006
which was the hard-line party of the president.

88
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:31,193
He said that he-- he simply wasn't going to continue to work in that atmosphere,

89
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:33,954
that they were undermining the whole process

90
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:43,800
and they were ultimately planning the evilest of deeds, of-- of attacking

91
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,517
not only Tutsis but all the moderate Hutu leaders also.

92
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:57,438
<i>The informant was a trainer for the Interahamwe, a paramilitary youth movement.</i>

93
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,088
<i>He said they were planning to kill some of Dallaire's troops,</i>

94
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:05,531
<i>Belgian soldiers, the backbone of the peacekeeping force.</i>

95
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,511
Maj. BRENT BEARDSLEY: 
Jean-Pierre, the informant, said they felt that if the Belgians were killed,

96
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:15,409
that Belgium and the U.N. would pack up and leave.

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So already, the situation was changing, that somebody didn't want us there

98
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:25,200
and that they were going to target us to-- to encourage us to go.

99
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:35,343
<i>In an urgent cable to the U.N. leadership, 
Dallaire repeated the informant's warnings</i>

100
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,420
<i>that there was a plan to exterminate all Tutsis in Kigali,</i>

101
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:46,364
<i>that Belgian peacekeepers would also be killed in the belief that Belgium would then withdraw all its troops.</i>

102
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:56,274
<i>Dallaire told New York he was going to raid the militia's arms caches.</i>

103
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:05,071
<i>He signed off in his native French,
"Where there's a will, there's a way. Let's go."</i>

104
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:10,047
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
I sent that, and then I went to bed and probably slept one of the best nights I had

105
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:19,977
because I felt that, finally, we were going to-- we were going to take a certain level of control that would permit us to do so much more.

106
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:26,444
<i>The cable arrived in New York at the United Nations' peacekeeping department, 
then run by Kofi Annan.</i>

107
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:39,075
KOFI ANNAN, Head of Peacekeeping, U.N: 
And the fax came in. 
And General Dallaire had also been in touch on the phone with General Baril,

108
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:44,874
and in fact, he has sent other messages where sometimes his question that,

109
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:57,342
"Somebody came and gave me this information. I don't know how sincere it is, whether I'm being manipulated or not," because intelligence can also be used to manipulate you.

110
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:04,849
<i>Annan was skeptical. In his response, he ordered Dallaire, 
first, not to take any action, and second,</i>

111
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:08,072
<i>to share the informant's secrets with the Rwandan government,</i>

112
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:12,923
<i>which he knew had strong ties to the Hutu extremists.</i>

113
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:25,047
KOFI ANNAN: 
Why did we go that route? Often, sharing-- shining light on these things and telling those planning it at a governmental level

114
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:34,052
that, "The international community knows what is being planned, we are monitoring, we are going to deal with you harshly and we know what you are up to"

115
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,661
-- sometimes it's a very good deterrent.

116
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:48,472
<i>Annan told Dallaire he was not to raid the arms caches 
and he must avoid any action that might cause U.N. troops to use force.</i>

117
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:59,249
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
The big hammer at the end of the message that came to me within hours of my sending my information message

118
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:04,830
was, "Stop, decease, and by the by, you're totally outside of your mandate."

119
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:12,977
At that time, the whole philosophy was, "We don't want another Mogadishu, and so keep it tight."

120
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,155
<i>Mogadishu. 
Three months earlier, when the Black Hawks were shot down in Somalia and 18 American soldiers died on a U.N. mission,</i>

121
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:30,000
<i>it changed everything about Washington's commitment to peacekeeping,</i>

122
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:32,393
<i>especially in Africa.</i>

123
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:43,242
MICHAEL SHEEHAN, White House Liaison on Somalia: 
The Clinton administration was brought to its knees by the -- by the problem in Somalia.

124
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:51,239
A secretary of defense was fired, a presidency was dramatically weakened. 
They were enormously criticized for this adventure in Somalia.

125
00:12:51,260 --> 00:13:00,640
And now you had another situation unfolding in Rwanda. 
And certainly, no one was clamoring for a re-intervention into the heart of Africa.

126
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,739
March 1994

127
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:15,822
<i>Despite the growing sense of danger, 
Kigali was teeming with thousands of Western expatriates</i>

128
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:20,724
<i>-- diplomats, aid workers and their families.</i>

129
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,620
<i>The official line from the U.N. and all their embassies was that Rwanda was still safe.</i>

130
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:34,856
CARL WILKENS : 
It was strange because, on the one hand, here's little groups of eight U.N. soldiers,

131
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:41,737
fully decked out, you know, with all of their gear and their machine guns and everything, patrolling the city-- of eight, you know?

132
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,819
And we used to joke, you can't-- you can't spit without hitting a U.N. car.

133
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:49,044
And so you got all this white vehicles, black "U.N." all over them,

134
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,527
and-- and occasionally, you would see some white tanks or something. 
There was an incredible sense of security in that.

135
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,300
And yet we also knew things were going to blow.

136
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:06,788
<i>Hutu extremists were now confident the U.N. would not stand in their way.</i>

137
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:15,143
<i>They imported thousands of machetes, prepared death lists and began targeting their political opponents.</i>

138
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:27,481
MONIQUE MUJAWAMARIYA, Human Rights Activist: 
It became simply a nightmare for the Tutsis, for all of the members of the opposition parties,

139
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:33,081
even if they were Hutu, and we lived through a series of political assassinations almost on a daily basis.

140
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:45,595
Every day, every day God gave us, we had three, four, five dead bodies, people that we picked up on the streets every day.

141
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:59,926
JOYCE LEADER, U.S. Embassy, Kigali: 
The people tried to tell us and tried to explain to us or help us understand, but we just-- maybe we just didn't get it.

142
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:04,612
It was just very hard to conceive of something so awful

143
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,100
actually being meticulously planned and carried out.

144
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:18,447
April 6, 1994 

145
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:29,009
<i>In central Kigali, a group of friends gathered for dinner 
at the home of a young American diplomat, Laura Lane.</i>

146
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:34,457
LAURA LANE, U.S. Embassy, Kigali: 
We had a couple of friends over, and

147
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:38,018
you know, I just-- we just sat down to dinner,

148
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:41,964
and all of a sudden, there was a huge explosion. And I--

149
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:50,727
I-- didn't instantly, you know, come to me what that was 
because I wasn't used to hearing those kinds of sounds.

150
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:55,368
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
And then at 8:30, the first phone call came in,

151
00:15:56,298 --> 00:16:01,798
saying that there-- originally, the first phone call said 
that there had been a big explosion in Kanombe camp,

152
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,038
which is just at the end of the runway of the airfield, the Kigali airfield,

153
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:10,019
saying that it looked like an ammunition dump had exploded.

154
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:16,025
Maj. BRENT BEARDSLEY: 
And it went from "There's been an explosion at the airport" to 
"We think it's the ammunition dump at Kanombe that's blown up"

155
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:20,021
to "It's a plane that's crashed" to "It's the presidential plane that's crashed."

156
00:16:22,454 --> 00:16:27,104
<i>Someone had fired a missile that shot down the Hutu president's airplane.</i>

157
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:33,277
<i>Even 10 years later, the responsibility for the attack remains a mystery.</i>

158
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:38,974
Lt. Col. CHARLES VUCKOVIC, Defense Intelligence Agency: 
There are many theories as to who shot down the plane.

159
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:42,081
I don't know if anybody has the answer to that.

160
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,692
Was it Hutu extremists or was it Tutsi extremists?

161
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:55,140
Was it done by the Tutsis as an excuse to begin the movement south by the RPF and take control of the country?

162
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:56,580
Hard to say.

163
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,695
Or was it used by the Hutu extremists to begin the genocide that took place?

164
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,760
I don't know the answer to that.

165



166
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:13,522
<i>That night, U.N. commanders were summoned to a crisis meeting at Rwandan Army headquarters.</i>

167
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:18,291
Maj. BRENT BEARDSLEY: 
We were heading through very darkened streets in Kigali, very quiet streets. There was no one--

168
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,261
the streets were just empty. It was like a ghost town.

169



170
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:29,947
They found a leading Hutu extremist, Colonel Theoneste Bagosora, in control.

171
00:17:34,147 --> 00:17:40,747
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
Colonel Bagosora was the chef de cabinet of the minister of national defense and a hard-line person

172
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:44,625
-- in fact, considered even more than hard-line.

173
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,009
He was chairing the meeting.

174
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:53,948
<i>Bagosora had once vowed to launch an "apocalypse" against the Tutsis.</i>

175
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,030
<i>Dallaire insisted he step aside and hand power 
to the moderate acting prime minister Madame Agathe.</i>

176
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:09,929
<i>Dallaire knew she would resist the extremists' power grab and appeal for calm.</i>

177
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:19,724
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
Bagosora kept saying that she's of no use and she never was able to garner her cabinet anyways, and--

178
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:23,448
Maj. BRENT BEARDSLEY: 
An officer that was sitting next to me stunk a booze,

179
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:28,187
started swearing in French underneath his breath about her

180
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:30,186
and calling her various names and --

181
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,579
so we were stalemated.

182
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:39,741
April 7, 2:00 AM

183
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:42,727
<i>Dallaire asked U.N. headquarters for guidance.</i>

184
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:46,351
<i>They responded by tightening his rules of engagement.</i>

185
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:53,009
<i>He was ordered not to intervene, and above all, to avoid armed conflict.</i>

186
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,657
KOFI ANNAN: 
We were concerned, one,

187
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:09,583
that Dallaire and his force didn't have the capacity and didn't -- to take on that sort of responsibility

188
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:14,006
and that if they attempted to do it and any of 
the peacekeepers were killed, 

189
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:20,256
we may see a repeat of Somalia and we may not even be able to offer any assistance.

190
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:37,137
LAURA LANE: 
You heard gunshots. You heard screams. You heard--

191
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:49,541
you heard just so much activity that you knew this was going to be, you know, an awful night. And in

192
00:19:51,338 --> 00:20:00,312
-- in the darkness, you were just -- I remember feeling like, "I don't want-- I don't want the daylight to come because I don't want to see, knowing what I'm hearing."

193
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,154
CARL WILKENS: [home video] 
Well, what's going on here, huh? We got all the kids in the hallway and the television.

194
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:21,986
This is April 7. It's about-- it's about 6:00 o'clock in the morning, and we were woken up at about 5:15, 5:20, by a lot of gunfire and stuff.

195
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:26,853
Yeah, the killing was happening right there. 
Our kids were listening in. We--

196
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:32,920
while they're describing on the radio and I'm talking back to them 
and saying how people are being killed in their front yard,

197
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,821
and I'm saying, "We're trying to get help." 
And we're just trying to figure out what we can do.  


198
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:40,622
This whole drama's unfolding, and our kids are standing there, 
glued to this thing. 

199
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:43,067
And all of a sudden, I go, "Whoa."

200
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:46,510
I see, you know, one of them standing there and just transfixed. 

201
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:50,900
And I say, "Theresa, take him away."

202


203
00:20:55,532 --> 00:21:02,032
<i>That morning, Dallaire sent Belgian and Ghanaian peacekeepers to guard Madame Agathe, the moderate prime minister.</i>

204
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,790
<i>Then he went to find the extremist leadership.</i>

205
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:17,000
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
Agathe was getting all the protection she needed, at least, we expected to need. I mean, we ended up by having 25 troops there.

206
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:29,002
With that sort of in hand, my job now, because I was moving around, is to go get ahold of Bagosora and say, "OK, what's going on now? What is the situation?"

207
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:31,098
Roadblocks were coming up.

208
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:45,001
But as I got closer to the inner core of the city, the roadblocks became more serious, and ultimately, the roadblocks in that inner circle there was controlled by the presidential guard.

209
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:51,838
And so we made our way to the ministry of defense. 
Nobody was there.

210
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:57,033
And so I said, "Well, maybe they're right back to where they were last night."

211
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,583
So we just turned and went towards the center.

212
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:07,607
<i>As Dallaire looked for the extremist leaders, the prime minister's house was surrounded by Rwandan troops.</i>

213
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:15,202
<i>Inside, U.N. peacekeepers sent to protect her were under orders not to use force.</i>

214
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:21,004
<i>The prime minister called her neighbor, American diplomat Joyce Leader.</i>

215
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,230
JOYCE LEADER: 
About 8:30 in the morning,

216
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:28,984
she called and asked if she could come and hide in my house.

217
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:32,710
- The prime minister?
- The prime minister. And...

218



219
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:40,015
I didn't give it very much thought, and I said yes,

220
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:47,105
but then when the Ghanaian peacekeeper who was guarding her --

221
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:53,894
he must have put a ladder up on her side of the fence,

222
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:59,971
and he came up above the -- he raised his head above the fence, and there were shots fired,

223
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:00,600
just then.

224
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:07,021
<i>Rwandan troops stormed the prime minister's compound.</i>

225
00:23:07,772 --> 00:23:11,872
<i>The peacekeepers radioed for instructions from Dallaire's Ghanaian deputy.</i>

226
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,743
Gen. HENRY ANYIDOHO, Deputy U.N. Cmndr, Rwanda: 
We were in communication with them all along, and

227
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:22,008
it was not even rational for them to try to oppose them.

228
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,205
The best they could do was to talk to them, to negotiate,

229
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:30,244
to tell them, "Look, what you are about to do is wrong. You cannot do it."

230
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,050
<i>At gunpoint, the U.N. troops surrendered their weapons to the Rwandans.</i>

231
00:23:38,057 --> 00:23:40,807
<i>The Ghanaian peacekeepers were soon released,</i>

232
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,230
<i>but the 10 Belgian troops were taken hostage and led away.</i>

233
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,081
Gen. HENRY ANYIDOHO: 
Their radios became silent.

234
00:23:48,943 --> 00:23:54,043
Then you suspected something had gone wrong 
because communication was utterly cut off.

235
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:58,061
Then you sense the danger. Something must have happened.

236
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:05,964
JOYCE LEADER: 
About another half hour later, we actually heard a scream and a shot

237
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:12,335
and realized that it was the prime minister 
who had been found and killed.

238
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:28,879
<i>General Dallaire hadn't heard of the attack, but he'd learned the extremist leadership was meeting at army headquarters.</i>

239
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:35,695
<i>As he approached, Dallaire caught a glimpse of his soldiers inside the Army compound, lying in the dirt.</i>

240
00:24:39,073 --> 00:24:51,273
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
And at the gate, as we went by, I saw two soldiers in the Belgian uniform lying on the ground about 50-odd meters inside-- inside the camp.

241
00:24:52,877 --> 00:25:00,973
And so your whole life is dependent on those nano-seconds 
of taking that right decisions because it's life and death.

242
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:10,956
I was already saying, "I can't get those guys out of there. 
I just don't have the forces or the deployment capability.

243
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:18,658
I've got so many other troops that I don't know of and all the vulnerability of the rest. I can't take these bastards on."

244
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:23,719
To do anything for them and for the others, I had to negotiate.

245
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:29,563
<i>Dallaire carried on through the next gate to confront the extremist leadership.</i>

246
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:38,099
<i>But he decided not to mention his troops, who he knew were being beaten 200 yards away.</i>

247
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:48,648
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
What I said was, "Get a grip of your units. I'm staying."

248
00:25:55,641 --> 00:26:06,341
The informant, Jean-Pierre, had told us that they were trying to set up to wipe out a dozen or so or 10 Belgians in order to break the back of our mission

249
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:16,000
because if the Belgians pulled out, I had no real substantive capability to sustain myself, and that the international community would pull us all out.

250
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,292
These guys knew about Mogadishu also.

251
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:26,006
And so what I was making clear to them was, is that I'm staying.

252
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:36,437
<i>Dallaire later demanded to know what had happened to the Belgians, but he took no military action to rescue his troops.</i>

253
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:49,008
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
Finally, a phone call, after insistence, came in 
and said that they are all at the hospital,

254
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:53,136
at the morgue.

255
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:55,155
And so I said, "Right. Let's go."

256
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:59,776
Morgue was a little shack,

257
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:03,917
and a bit of an L-shaped small shack.

258
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:08,004
And it was a 24-watt bulb, at best.

259
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:17,008
And there in the corner of the L-shape was this pile of potato bags,

260
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:21,703
just looked like a pile of potato-- big, huge potato bags.

261
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:25,474
And as we got closer, we saw that they were bodies.

262
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:39,168
April 8

263
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:47,641
<i>In the wake of Somalia, the murder of more Western peacekeepers triggered an immediate response.</i>

264
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:49,772
MIKE McCURRY, State Department Spokesman: 
Good afternoon, everybody.

265
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:53,015
I wanted to start with the situation in Rwanda.

266
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:58,607
The president called the secretary of state 
this morning to express the president's concern 

267
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:04,632
about the safety of Americans in Rwanda 
in light of the deteriorating situation there.

268
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:13,132
LAURA LANE : 
By that morning, we kind of had a sense that we were not going to be able to wait this out.

269
00:28:14,002 --> 00:28:22,202
I took our wedding album. We took our guns and put the dog at our feet and literally slumped down in the car

270
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:32,212
and drove down the streets, like, just looking over the 
dashboard, you know, as we hear fire in the background, and made it to the embassy.

271
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:39,560
<i>The Clinton administration ordered an immediate evacuation of all 257 U.S. citizens in Rwanda.</i>

272
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:44,265
<i>It was up to Laura Lane to get every American out alive.</i>

273
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:55,592
LAURA LANE: 
We said, "We have to, you know, evacuate the American 
community out" because we couldn't risk, you know, their lives trying to wait this out

274
00:28:55,592 --> 00:29:03,991
because if this was a plan, it had a larger purpose, 
and that larger purpose would not be good where you'd want anyone in harm's way.

275
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,010
<i>But Lane told Washington she wanted to stay and keep the embassy open as a safe haven for Rwandans.</i>

276
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:25,094
LAURA LANE: 
I felt very, very strongly that if there is someone who is planning this kind of evil, they need to know that there is also another group,

277
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:31,056
that we, the Americans, will stand right here and stand against them.

278
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,920
And I felt very, very strongly about that because

279
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:37,123
otherwise, they'd think they could get away with it.

280
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:48,298
GEORGE MOOSE, Ass't Sec'y of State for Africa: 
Yeah, I do recall there-- there the notion that, yes, maybe we could stay behind and maybe we could do something.

281
00:29:49,717 --> 00:30:00,533
And then you have to say, with what do you create a safe haven? If the Belgian troops could not defend and protect the prime minister from a ruthless attack,

282
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:07,455
what were unarmed Americans bearing a flag going to do?

283
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:17,825
LAURA LANE: 
Maybe hopelessly naive. I mean, we are four people in an embassy, and a very small embassy community. But I don't know, I--

284
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:26,058
I think one person can make a difference, and maybe if we just saved one life, that was one life worth saving. 

285
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:38,040
Maybe we couldn't save everyone, but I would have rather stood there and said-- and stayed and said,
"I am going to stay because it is worth that risk."

286
00:30:39,092 --> 00:30:44,892
So in the end, the decision was taken out of my hands.

287
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,760
<i>All embassies in Kigali closed.</i>

288
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,948
<i>Aid workers and diplomats were ordered out of the country.</i>

289
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:07,000
Maj. BRENT BEARDSLEY : 
We started going out, picking up our military observers, 
who were at various locations, picking up our U.N. staff, picking up diplomats, picking up people at risk.

290
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,297
And we started a whole series of what we call rescue missions to go pick people up, try to locate them.

291
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:22,524
<i>Beardsley went to rescue Polish Catholic priests trapped 
with two U.N. observers in a Kigali church where Tutsis had sought refuge.</i>

292
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:31,302
Maj. BRENT BEARDSLEY: 
The military observers and the priests could hear people screaming 
over the church,so they'd left their quarters and had come over to see what was going on.

293
00:31:31,302 --> 00:31:41,000
They were grabbed and they were put up against the wall with rifle 
underneath their chin, and they were held there while the identity cards were-- were captured and were burned.

294
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:52,440
And then the militia came in and the gendarmes literally -- 
the police literally handed them over to the-- to the militia, who then proceeded through the rest of the evening to chop them apart with machetes.

295
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:03,444
Inside the church itself were about 150 people.

296
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:08,822
About 15 of them were still alive. The rest had been attacked with machetes and had been killed.

297
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:21,100
And-- and the thing that stood out in my mind, up until that day, it almost bore resemblance of a coup, taking out the moderates.

298
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:32,576
But this was different. This was-- this was just ordinary men, 
women and children, and the only reason whatsoever that 
they were killed and targeted was because they were Tutsi.

299
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:45,016
Northern Rwanda

300
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:53,273
<i>Behind the ceasefire line, the Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front were preparing to respond.</i>

301
00:32:54,589 --> 00:33:07,286
Gen. PAUL KAGAME : 
The information very clearly came in very fast, showing how targeted killings were being carried out and how these were spreading out not only in Kigali, but going beyond Kigali to other parts of the country.

302
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:11,937
And we knew that was the usual style. The massacres had started,

303
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,554
and we have to take action.

304
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:20,417
<i>The rebels declared the peace process dead and attacked the extremist government.</i>

305
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,440
<i>General Kagame had gone through training at Fort Leavenworth.</i>

306
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:30,546
<i>The U.S. military maintained contact and understood the rebel leader's intentions.</i>

307
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:39,024
Lt. Col. CHARLES VUCKOVIC : 
In retrospect, there was no chance, I think, that RPF was in any mood to negotiate right from the beginning.

308
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:40,563
INTERVIEWER: 
They wanted what?

309
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:45,691
They wanted to control the country. 
They wanted to take over control politically, militarily.

310
00:33:46,014 --> 00:33:48,346
There was no way you were going to stop the RPF.

311
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:51,566
There was no way that they were in the mood to negotiate once this all started.

312
00:33:55,025 --> 00:33:58,065
April 9

313
00:33:59,446 --> 00:34:07,104
<i>Overnight, 1,000 French and Belgian paratroopers had arrived without warning, seizing Kigali airport.</i>

314
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:14,190
<i>These troops were not under U.N. command. Their mission was solely to get the expatriates out.</i>

315
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:21,906
<i>Dozens of journalists had arrived with the new troops.</i>

316
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:27,899
<i>They traveled with Belgian soldiers to Kigali's psychiatric hospital, where the Western staff was trapped.</i>

317
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:37,104
<i>On the way in, they drove past the Interahamwe waiting outside.</i>

318
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:46,695
<i>Tutsis emerged from the hospital building, where they'd been hiding for three days.</i>

319
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:53,996
<i>They said they were surrounded by the militias, that some of them had already been killed.</i>

320
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:06,967
<i>When it was clear the soldiers weren't going to help, the refugees appealed to the journalists.</i>

321
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:28,519
KATELIJNE HERMANS, Belgian Television: 
There was a whole group of people, but in the whole group, one woman started to speak and started to explain why they were afraid and what was happening to them.

322
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:33,482
And she started begging us to take her and the others with us.

323
00:35:35,873 --> 00:35:42,223
She was speaking to me, a woman to a woman, saying, "I'm afraid. Please help me!"

324
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:47,129
And we were just listening to her, and we couldn't do anything.

325
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:53,131
At that moment, we thought we couldn't do anything, just listen and say "Yes."

326
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:02,973
So we left.

327
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:10,175
For the white people, it's over, but we knew the hundreds that stayed.

328
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,720
And we heard the shooting at the moment we left. 
So it was clear for me that hell starts for them.

329
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:29,433
<i>All Western troops and U.N. peacekeepers were under orders not to evacuate ordinary Rwandans.</i>

330
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:38,207
Maj. BRENT BEARDSLEY: 
What that meant was, anybody that was white-skinned got to get on an airplane and fly to safety, and anybody that was black-skinned got to stay in Rwanda and get killed.

331
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:48,006
And that's as simple as it came down to. It still to this day leaves a very, very bad taste in my mouth that the United States of America could have 350 Marines sitting at Bujumbura Airport,

332
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:55,559
that the French were able to get in 500 or so paratroopers, that the Belgians had over a 1,000 paratroopers.

333
00:36:56,386 --> 00:37:00,014
You know, we basically had our intervention force already on the ground.

334
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:07,917
You know, what they later told us, is it was impossible to get on the ground. We had it on the ground on the 10th of April, within three days of this thing starting and

335
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:13,822
-- but it wasn't there to intervene. It wasn't there to save Rwanda, it was there to save white people.

336
00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:15,579
And that's what it came down to.

337
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:23,979
<i>With the airport taking fire, the American embassy decided to evacuate its staff and expatriates overland</i>

338
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:29,138
<i>in convoys, south to Burundi, where U.S. Marines were waiting.</i>

339
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:44,068
JOYCE LEADER, U.S. Embassy, Kigali: 
And there were people standing on either side of the road, and it's my recollection that I saw some instruments, like machetes, in their hands.

340
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,811
And I remember thinking, "Well, they're just waiting for us to get out of here

341
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:54,099
before they go on about their gruesome business."

342
00:38:01,802 --> 00:38:05,352
BONAVENTURE NIYIBIZI, U.S. Embassy Employee: 
I was working for the American embassy, basically.

343
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:17,000
I saw them leaving. I saw the flags on the vehicles. 
I knew all the vehicles. I know all the people they belong to. And so I said, "OK."

344
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:35,024
I think it was sad, surprising to see that by the end of the day, you are a person who have-- who has to die, when other people are allowed to be alive.

345
00:38:35,091 --> 00:38:37,791
This is a strange feeling.

346
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:46,288
Americans were allowed to be alive. My neighbors were allowed to be alive. They were walking on the street. They were going to the market.

347
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,180
And we were here, feeling that we had to die anyway.

348
00:38:59,578 --> 00:39:04,822
<i>As she organized the last American convoy, Laura Lane made a final attempt to do what she thought was right.</i>

349
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:18,009
LAURA LANE: 
We had-- we had a convoy of over 100 vehicles with over 600 people, only 9 Americans.

350
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:22,109
Greg and I were the last two. The ambassador was at the front.

351
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:30,306
And yes, there were-- there were Rwandans in there. 
There were Tutsis in there, and in some cases, there were Hutus.

352
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:37,553
And so if they made it to our checkpoints and we-- you know, we could hide them, we did.

353
00:39:38,072 --> 00:39:43,022
Some of them were-- you know, we dubbed them Americans for the day, you know what I mean? 

354
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:50,210
We made them honorary Americans so that they could be in the convoy.

355
00:39:54,074 --> 00:40:00,176
CARL WILKENS : 
If people in Rwanda ever needed help, now was the time.

356
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:03,412
And everybody's leaving.

357
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:12,349
<i>Carl Wilkens had put his family on an American convoy,</i>

358
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:18,583
<i>but he decided to stay behind with Rwandan colleagues and workers who'd sought refuge in his home.</i>

359
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:31,080
CARL WILKENS: 
That Tutsi young lady and that Tutsi young man were faces right there to me representing the country, and I felt if I left, they were going to be killed.

360
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:39,615
And then-- and then I recognized, you know, how is it-- 
I've got a-- I've got this blue American passport. 
That means I can go. But all of these people don't have a passport. They can't go. And--

361
00:40:40,794 --> 00:40:45,944
and while all of those things played in, the bottom line is it just seemed the right thing to do.

362
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:55,163
<i>By the evening of April 10th, Carl Wilkens was the only American left in Rwanda.</i>

363
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:15,157
WARREN CHRISTOPHER, Secretary of State: 
As far as I know, everyone in Kigali who's wanted to leave has been able to leave, and they're probably successfully out by now, safely out by now.

364
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:18,237
<i>The Clinton administration breathed a sigh of relief.</i>

365
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:29,509
<i>In Belgium, the country was in crisis. With 10 of its soldiers dead, the government wanted to pull all its peacekeepers out of Rwanda,</i>

366
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,080
<i>but it didn't want to be embarrassed by leaving alone.</i>

367
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:38,693
<i>The foreign minister called Secretary of State Warren Christopher.</i>

368
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:56,091
WILLY CLAES, Belgian Foreign Minister: 
The reaction of the public opinion in Belgium was-- 
was very strong. And I may say there was unanimity in all, in order to ask to pull out the troops after the killing.

369
00:41:59,503 --> 00:42:08,597
Warren Christopher told me that he understood perfectly why the Belgian government took that decision.

370
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:17,076
He confirmed that the preference of the Americans went to the withdrawal of the MINUAR.

371
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:29,030
GEORGE MOOSE : 
Quite right. The Belgians wanted to have a cover of having others leave, as well.

372
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:34,205
And I think-- and we sort of-- we did. We yielded to that request.

373
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:38,884
In retrospect, I wonder if that was the right thing to do.

374
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:50,075
<i>Christopher instructed Madeleine Albright, America's ambassador at the U.N.,</i>

375
00:42:50,804 --> 00:42:54,204
<i>to push for the withdrawal of the entire peacekeeping force.</i>

376
00:42:56,002 --> 00:43:00,852
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT : 
My instructions were to support full withdrawal.

377
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:20,583
And I listened to the discussion very carefully in the Security 
Council, and I could see that we-- our position was wrong, 
and especially in listening to the African delegate, Ambassador Gambari from Nigeria was very moving on this.

378
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:31,937
IBRAHIM GAMBARI, Nigerian U.N. Ambassador: 
And I had the full backing of my of my colleagues to argue, on the contrary, that we must forget about cutting and running,

379
00:43:32,106 --> 00:43:45,007
that it would be-- it would be callous. It would be contradictory 
to the spirit of the charter, which says the Security Council has 
a responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, everywhere in the world,

380
00:43:45,007 --> 00:43:46,796
including Africa.

381
00:43:48,902 --> 00:43:59,002
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: 
And I asked my deputy to take my seat while I left and went out into the hall, into these phone booths, and called Washington.

382
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:03,194
And they said, "Well, no, we're worrying about this, and we-- these are your instructions."

383
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:09,350
And I-- I actually screamed into the phone. 
I said, "They're unacceptable. I want them changed."

384
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:17,456
<i>Albright's call was to Richard Clarke, head of peacekeeping at the National Security Council.</i>

385
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:23,231
<i>Clarke declined to talk to FRONTLINE, but he did talk to journalist Samantha Power.</i>

386
00:44:25,006 --> 00:44:28,083
SAMANTHA POWER : 
And they end up in a screaming match.

387
00:44:28,796 --> 00:44:33,846
The fight is not about whether to send U.S. troops to Rwanda. 
That's not even contemplated.

388
00:44:34,094 --> 00:44:40,306
The fight is simply about how to withdraw the U.N. peacekeepers 
and how many to withdraw and how many to leave in place  


389
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:46,006
and what the function of those peacekeepers should be who remain in place. That's what the fight is about.

390
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:55,809
That's the extent of the dissent at the highest level of the U.S. government about this genocide.

391
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:58,338
That's it! That phone call.

392
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:10,013
<i>With the United States demanding a withdrawal, the U.N. instructed General Dallaire to start closing his peacekeeping mission.</i>

393
00:45:12,095 --> 00:45:17,095
<i>Dallaire turned to his deputy, General Henry Anyidoho, for advice.</i>

394
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,030
GEN. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
And I remember sitting in front of his desk-- huge man sitting there, stoic.

395
00:45:24,023 --> 00:45:40,003
And I said, "Henry, they want us out. We've failed in the mission. 
We've failed in attempting to convince. We've failed the Rwandans. We are going to run and

396
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:44,213
cut the losses. That's what they want us to do."

397
00:45:47,813 --> 00:45:56,013
Gen. HENRY ANYIDOHO : 
And I said, "No, we haven't failed. And as commanders, 
we are going to sit here, work hard, and see to its solution.

398
00:45:56,356 --> 00:46:02,306
So let's tell those people back in New York that we do not think that the mission should be closed.

399
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:07,339
<i>Anyidoho assured Dallaire his Ghanaian peacekeepers would stay.</i>

400
00:46:09,824 --> 00:46:19,174
Gen. ROMEO DALLAIRE: 
And that was all I needed. That meant that I would still have 
troops on the ground, which were good troops-- not well equipped, but good troops.

401
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:26,553
So I stood up and I said, "Henry, we're not going to run. We're not going to abandon the mission.

402
00:46:26,596 --> 00:46:34,346
And we will not be held in history of being accountable for the abandonment of the Rwandan people."

403
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,441
It was just morally corrupt to do that.

404
00:46:39,025 --> 00:46:41,975
And that's why I went back and told them to go to hell.

405
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:47,007
Nyarubuye, Eastern Rwanda

406
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:57,748
<i>As the U.N. debated whether to keep a peacekeeping force in Kigali, the extremist Hutu leadership implemented the next phase of its plan,</i>

407
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:06,062
<i>to spread the killing across the nation by exploiting Rwanda's culture of obedience.</i>

408
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:14,506
<i>They told Hutus the Tutsi rebels were foreign invaders bent on turning them into slaves.</i>

409
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:22,919
<i>Their propaganda reminded Hutus that the Tutsis had ruled them for centuries, often treating them with disdain.</i>

410
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:40,324
GITERA RWAMUHIZI, Hutu Farmer:  
Tutsis used to abuse Hutus. For example, if a Tutsi chief wished to 
stand up from his chair, he would call up a Hutu, who would allow his foot to be pierced by the Tutsi's spear as he stood up.

411
00:47:46,194 --> 00:47:54,244
My understanding is that Tutsis are not originally from Rwanda. 
I heard that they might have come from Egypt or somewhere else.

412
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,580
<i>An extremist hate radio station told Hutus to eliminate their Tutsi neighbors.</i>

413
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:23,090
VALENTINA IRIBAGIZA, Tutsi Schoolgirl:  
Then, when the war began, people changed.

414
00:48:23,094 --> 00:48:29,354
One day across the valley, we saw houses burning and people fleeing from their homes.

415
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:48,027
<i>A 12-year-old girl named Valentina followed her parents into the Catholic church in Nyarubuye, where along with more than 5,000 other Tutsis, they waited.</i>

416
00:48:49,006 --> 00:48:50,706
<i>It was April the 15th.</i>

417
00:48:55,671 --> 00:49:02,221
VALENTINA IRIBAGIZA:  
I was a young girl. My parents thought the church was safe because no one would be killed in a church.

418
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:14,103
When we arrived, I could see the older people were very sad 
and upset. Everybody was scared, but nobody knew what was going to happen.

419
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:30,073
GITERA RWAMUHIZI:  
The leader of the local community told us that Tutsis had fled
to Nyarubuye and that we're to go there and kill them.

420
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:37,150
On the morning of April 15th, we woke up and started walking towards the church.

421
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:40,816
It was like going to the marketplace.

422
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:52,010
VALENTINA IRIBAGIZA:  
I saw the soldiers come in, and they started shooting and shooting. All we had to defend ourselves were rocks.

423
00:49:55,035 --> 00:50:00,065
Then our local governor, Gacumbizi, came in and stood in front of us.

424
00:50:00,377 --> 00:50:10,077
Gacumbizi said that everyone should know what they were there 
for. He said that all those who were there should be killed, that no one should survive.

425
00:50:18,646 --> 00:50:25,596
Then they started killing, hacking with their machetes. 
They kept doing it, and I was hiding under dead people.

426
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,690
They didn't kill me. Because of the blood covering me, they thought they had killed me.

427
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:44,996
GITERA RWAMUHIZI:  
It was as if we were taken over by Satan.

428
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:50,161
When Satan is using you, you lose your mind. We were not ourselves.

429
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:57,210
You couldn't be normal and you start butchering people for no reason. We'd been attacked by the devil.

430
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:07,727
VALENTINA IRIBAGIZA:  
It was very late, around 2:00 AM, when the Interahamwe came back.

431
00:51:08,043 --> 00:51:17,236
One of them stepped on my head. He was shaking me 
with his foot to see if I was alive. He said, "This thing is dead," and so they left.

432
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:26,032
I lived among the dead for a long time.

433
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:32,616
At night, the dogs would come to eat the bodies.

434
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:40,149
Once a dog was eating someone next to me. 
I threw something at the dog and he ran away.

435
00:51:46,022 --> 00:51:51,072
I hid in a small room. That's where I stayed and slept for 43 days.

436
00:52:08,905 --> 00:52:18,065
<i>As the Tutsi rebel army pushed south towards the capital, 
they found evidence of massacres in village after village.</i>

437
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:53,817
<i>With the rebels approaching, extremist Hutus unleashed more Interahamwe militias to accelerate the killing.</i>

438
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:05,340
<i>The murdered prime minister had been replaced by 
Jean Kambanda, who incited followers to repulse the Tutsi rebels and their sympathizers, known as Inkotanyi.</i>

439
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:18,003
JEAN KAMBANDA:  
The Inkotanyi did not come to conquer power only. 
They are after you, too. They want to kill you all.

440
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:27,139
Guns are not only for soldiers. Every person can own a gun. If they shoot, you shoot back.

441
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,900
I, too, carry one all the time. Here it is.

442
00:53:38,655 --> 00:53:44,055
Red Cross Hospital, Kigali

443
00:53:56,474 --> 00:54:02,074
<i>Extremist Hutus referred to Tutsi survivors as "those not finished off."</i>

444
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,149
<i>The Red Cross had never left Rwanda, and those who stayed confronted a stark moral dilemma.</i>

445
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:14,097
<i>What do you do in the face of evil?</i>

446
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:36,901
<i>A BBC reporter spoke to the Red Cross leader in Rwanda, Philippe Gaillard.</i>

447
00:54:38,448 --> 00:54:45,048
FERGAL KEANE, BBC: 
Walking around here, the images are quite horrific. 
You've been dealing with this for a long time. What do you think?

448
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,910
PHILIPPE GAILLARD, Red Cross: 
I don't know if I-- if I still feel something.

449
00:54:50,236 --> 00:54:52,986
I'm-- I have a brain of iron.

450
00:54:54,441 --> 00:55:00,009
That's the way I've survived. That's the way I can speak to you in so clear language.

451
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:06,725
FERGAL KEANE: 
Is there a high price to be paid for that kind of brain of iron? Later on, perhaps?

452
00:55:06,823 --> 00:55:11,023
PHILIPPE GAILLARD: 
Later on, maybe. For the time being, so far, so good.

453
00:55:30,008 --> 00:55:35,468
<i>Soon after the killing began, Gaillard decided he had to challenge the extremist government.</i>

454
00:55:37,979 --> 00:55:42,529
<i>Rwandan troops had stopped a Red Cross ambulance and killed six patients.</i>

455
00:55:47,002 --> 00:55:51,402
PHILIPPE GAILLARD: 
I decided to call my headquarters in Geneva to tell the story.

456
00:55:52,188 --> 00:55:58,038
And my counterpart in Geneva told me, "Do you think we could make it public?"

457
00:55:59,214 --> 00:56:07,014
And then you think twice. I mean, because if you make it public, then you know that people might kill you,

458
00:56:10,061 --> 00:56:13,511
or would really decided to kill you because of what you told.

459
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:24,441
It was a bit spoken. We decided to do it. 
So following day, BBC, Reuters, Radio France Internationale-- it was everywhere.

460
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:33,699
<i>The publicity embarrassed the extremists, and their government 
gave the Red Cross safe passage throughout Rwanda.</i>

461
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,340
PHILIPPE GAILLARD: 
So these six people didn't die for-- for nothing.

462
00:56:39,587 --> 00:56:47,007
I mean, they-- because of their deaths, hundreds of other people could be saved.

463
00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:59,019
<i>Gaillard cultivated a relationship with the extremist leadership, 
which he believes helped the Red Cross save 65,000 lives.</i>

464
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:12,312
PHILIPPE GAILLARD: 
When-- when we talk about mass saving, I think that's best. 
And the only way is to talk with the people who want to kill them.

465
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:21,534
I remember one day, I met by chance Colonel Theoneste Bagosora.

466
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:31,118
I told him, "Colonel, do something to stop the killing. 
I mean, this is-- this is absurd. I mean this...

467
00:57:36,598 --> 00:57:39,198
-- this-- this is suicide. I mean

468
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:41,701
-- And his answer was

469
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:45,009
-- there are words you never forget, you know?

470
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:53,140
His answer was, "Listen to, sir. If I want, tomorrow I can recruit 50,000 more Interahamwe."

471
00:57:56,096 --> 00:58:00,546
So... I took him by the shirt.

472
00:58:01,002 --> 00:58:05,602
I'm 58 kilograms and he must be 115....now

473
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:09,981
I took him by the shirt, looked his eyes and told him,

474
00:58:10,003 --> 00:58:12,243
"Theoneste, you will lose the war."

475
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:22,129
<i>Gaillard's network of aid workers across Rwanda gave him 
the most accurate count of the death toll.</i>

476
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:29,095
<i>He estimated that in the first two weeks, 100,000 Rwandans had been killed.</i>

477
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:42,017
<i>The Red Cross has a tradition of neutrality and public silence, but Gaillard decided that this genocide would be different.</i>

478
00:58:44,138 --> 00:58:50,288
PHILIPPE GAILLARD: 
The International Committee of the Red Cross, 
which is a 140 years old organization,

479
00:58:51,096 --> 00:58:54,796
was not active during the Armenian genocide,

480
00:58:55,066 --> 00:58:57,516
shut up during the Holocaust.

481
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:02,225
Everybody knew what was happening with the Jews.

482
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:17,051
In such circumstances, if-- if you don't at least speak out clearly

483
00:59:20,001 --> 00:59:24,801
and-- you are participating to--

484
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:31,989
to the genocide. I mean,

485
00:59:32,831 --> 00:59:37,081
if you just shut up when you see what you see--

486
00:59:41,813 --> 00:59:44,363
and morally, ethically, you cannot shut up!

487
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It's a responsibility to-- to talk, to speak out.
