1
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:16,549
Blackfeet.

2
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,458
Smoke.
Do you smell it, sir?

3
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,153
They certainly made
a thorough job of it.

4
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:21,952
Aye, they did that,
sir.

5
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:26,018
- You'll probably find shovels
in one of the wagons.
- Yes, sir.

6
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,492
What-

7
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:08,705
No! Don't touch me!
Go away!

8
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,797
Please! Please go away!

9
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:13,672
- We're not going to hurt you.
- Leave me alone!

10
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:16,541
- The Indians will come back and kill me too!
- There, lassie.

11
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,638
- Let me go!
- There, there.

12
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:21,343
You're perfectly safe now.
We won't let anyone harm you.

13
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:23,716
They'll come back!
I know they will!

14
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,846
They killed my grandfather.

15
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:28,789
He's over there under that wagon.

16
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:31,224
- Shh! Shh! Come on.
- No.

17
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:33,319
- Come on now. That's it.
- Please! Please!

18
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,058
Everything's going
to be all right.

19
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,897
Everything's going
to be all right.

20
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:42,063
There now, now.

21
00:04:56,654 --> 00:05:00,317
Shh. Everything's
all right.

22
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:02,756
I'm afraid.

23
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,024
Now, listen, Sue.
You and I are going to have a little talk.

24
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,691
You know, there never was
anything to be afraid of...

25
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,768
that couldn't be cured
by one little word.

26
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:14,201
Do you know what
that word is?

27
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:18,673
" Courage.'' It can beat the toughest
situation that ever happened.

28
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,074
You see,
when you're afraid of things...

29
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:23,169
the more you think of'em,
the bigger they get.

30
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,942
But if you just throw
your head back and say...

31
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,180
" I won't be scared
of anything anymore,'' then you're not.

32
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,255
Aren't you ever afraid
of anything?

33
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:36,458
Well, uh,
let's put it this way:

34
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,427
When I meet up with something
I'm not quite sure of...

35
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,431
I decide first of all that everything's
going to come out all right.

36
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,728
Whatever it is,
I'm going to lick it.

37
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:47,099
And usually it does
come out all right.

38
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:49,604
- You know what does it?
- Courage?

39
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:51,698
Courage.

40
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,801
Now, let's forget everything
that made us unhappy.

41
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:57,380
Let's learn to smile again,
because we know everybody's...

42
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,644
gonna do all they can to help us,
so we'll help too.

43
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,810
- What do you say?
- I'll try, Mr. Monty.

44
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,889
That's the girl.
Now, back to sleep.

45
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:15,197
- Good night.
- Good night.

46
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:48,054
Easy.

47
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,660
Dismissed, Mac.

48
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:04,177
- Welcome home! Praise be you're safe and-
- Shh!

49
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:07,944
- What have you got there?
- Quiet. Quiet.

50
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:10,713
- Where in heaven's name did you get her?
- You'll hear about that later.

51
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,812
- Is the superintendent still up?
- He is.

52
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:14,891
- And if I told you the half of it-
- I can't escape it.

53
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:17,358
Give me a quick brush.
I want to report in.

54
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,452
Beggin' your pardon, sir.
You can't go in them clothes.

55
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:21,861
- I've your other uniform all laid out.
- Why should I change uniforms...

56
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:24,229
- at this time of night?
- The others, sir.

57
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:28,031
Every one of'em is dressed up like a widow
at a wake. If you knew who was there-

58
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:31,505
- I wouldn't dandy up tonight to meet Lily Langtry.
- But it's the O.C. 's daughter.

59
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:35,669
- Will you stop thatjabbering and brush me off?
- I'll do it!

60
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,215
- I'll do it. Please let me.
- Now look what you've done with your shouting.

61
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:42,149
You're the worst old fishwife
ever came out of County Kildare.

62
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,720
He's otherwise known as
Patrick O'Hannegan.

63
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:47,382
- This is Miss Susannah Sheldon.
-Just call me Sue.

64
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:49,823
Now, young lady, we'll have to arrange
sleeping quarters for you.

65
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,918
- Where will that be, sir?
- Your room.

66
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:54,691
- My-
- Do I sleep in with him?

67
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:58,063
No. Pat can sleep
out here on the couch.

68
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,336
But I wouldn't wanna take
Mr. Pat's room.

69
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,101
That's all right. He'll be very
comfortable out here, won't you?

70
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,042
- Oh, yes, sir. Very.
- Give this a lick.

71
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:11,046
Let's see.
What about sleeping things?

72
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:13,878
Use one of my nightshirts.
You might have to cut it down.

73
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:17,249
- Now, young lady, off to bed with you.
- Oh, wait.

74
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:20,448
There's a hair on your shoulder
the brush didn't get.

75
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:23,583
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Monty.

76
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,073
Come on.
I'll fix the bed for ya.

77
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:43,544
I'll help you.

78
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:50,813
dd

79
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:05,296
dd

80
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:07,393
- Excuse me, sir.
- That's quite all right, Monty.

81
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:09,734
- Glad to see you're back.
- I didn't mean to intrude, sir.

82
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,138
- I've come to make my report.
- Come in, won't you?

83
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,006
I want you to meet my daughter.
She's come out from Toronto for a visit.

84
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:17,580
Well, I'm-
I'm hardly presentable, sir.

85
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:20,275
Perfectly all right.
Come along.

86
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:23,080
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Monty.

87
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:25,154
- Hello, fellas.
- Hi, old boy.

88
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:28,088
Vicky, this is
Inspector Montague.

89
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:30,819
- I'm very happy to know you, Mr. Montague.
- It's a pleasure, Miss Standing.

90
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:33,590
Won't you join us?
Perhaps you'd like a glass of sherry.

91
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:36,666
- Not a thing, thanks.
- You'll need something to fortify you.

92
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,962
- We'll probably have more singing.
- If I know Monty...

93
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:42,664
- he'll be right along with us.
- He's just the baritone we've been looking for.

94
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:46,800
- We really are having a little baritone trouble.
- I say, now,just a moment.

95
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,276
I'll be glad to
as soon as I make my report.

96
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,643
- That won't take long.
- Excuse me?

97
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,773
Certainly.

98
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:01,450
- Doctor, do you mind getting my hat for me?
- Certainly.

99
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,526
- You're not going?
- What's left for me?

100
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:05,822
- It's baritone or nothing.
- Good night, old boy.

101
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:07,920
It's nothing.

102
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,460
Pat, you old pirate, why didn't you
tell me to change uniforms?

103
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:14,662
- Why, she's a beauty!
- Tell you? I did tell you.

104
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,205
You didn't tell me anything of the kind.
Those are the things you should tell me.

105
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:19,332
But you said you wouldn't
dandy up for Lily Langtry.

106
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,502
Lily Langtry couldn't hold a candle
to her. Get off these boots...

107
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:23,579
- and get me a clean shirt.
- Yes, sir.

108
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,671
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

109
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:28,080
When did she get here?
You didn't even tell me she was young.

110
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:30,710
- Two days ago, sir.
- And I had to be away on patrol.

111
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,812
Why, she's beautiful.
She's as pretty as a picture.

112
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,415
What the-

113
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:39,256
Why aren't you in bed?

114
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:43,197
I'm helping, sir.
Here's your shirt.

115
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:49,496
00, and regulations
for enlisted men are lights-out at 10:00?

116
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:52,268
- Get.
- Yes, sir.

117
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:54,367
Good night.

118
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:56,776
Good night. Run along now.
Here, unbutton that shirt.

119
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,747
You let me go over there looking like
a hayseed to meet the most beaut-

120
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,512
Not that I care how I look,
but out of respect for her.

121
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:05,247
I'm sure she'll understand, sir.

122
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:09,314
You didn't even tell me she
had blue eyes. And deep blue eyes at that.!

123
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:13,727
- dd
- You know, Dad didn't think
I should come, even for a visit.

124
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,231
- But I'm here.
- You might find it a little rugged.

125
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:21,236
- You know, I've been wondering.
- What?

126
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:24,205
Well, whatever made a man like you
take a job like this?

127
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:28,641
There are times when it's rather humdrum.
But right now, you're here.

128
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:31,373
And I'm going to change things.

129
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:34,644
Inspector Montague, we're going
to give a dance on Wednesday night.

130
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:37,618
- A real one. Dress uniform and frills.
- A dance?

131
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:42,158
- Well, you do dance, don't you?
- Well, I- Oh, yes. Yes, of course, thank you.

132
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:46,320
Splendid. And being the only woman
in the vicinity, I'm bound to be popular.

133
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:54,735
Whoa!

134
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:57,602
- Hello, Chambers.
- Hello, sir.

135
00:11:57,707 --> 00:12:00,232
- Hello, Inspector.
- What's the trouble? Anything wrong?

136
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:03,107
Indian raid. Four of my workmen wounded.
And they've stolen 20 head of horses.

137
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:06,614
If we hadn't caught them in time,
they'd have cleaned out the whole corral.

138
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,684
- Inspector, turn out 10 men.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:10,776
- Mr. Randall, you'll take out the patrol.
- Sir.

140
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,287
- Go to the construction camp
and track down the raiders.
- Yes, sir.

141
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,486
- I'll need your doctor too.
- Then come inside. We'll get him.

142
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:20,791
- Call the doctor.
- Harlan.!

143
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:23,331
Why, Vicky, what on earth
are you doing here?

144
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:27,301
- Came out for a visit.
- Well, why didn't you let me know
you were coming?

145
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,372
I didn't even let Dad
know I was coming, did I?

146
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:32,465
No. As a matter of fact,
she didn't. Oh, Doctor.

147
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,544
- Yes, sir.
- Go back to camp with Mr. Chambers.

148
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:36,635
- You're needed there.
- I'll get my kit, sir.

149
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:39,544
- Mr. Churchill, check the guard.
Prepare for any emergency.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:42,618
- You may be able to assist him, Mr. Williams?
- Yes, sir.

151
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:45,313
- Good night, Miss Standing.
- Good night. Anything serious, Dad?

152
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:47,652
- Good night.
-Just a little Indian trouble at my camp.

153
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:49,987
- Nothing for you to worry about.
- It's hardly the best time...

154
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:53,392
for you to have come out here, but I can't
tell you how pleased I am to see you.

155
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:56,523
Don't tell me I leave you speechless, Harlan.

156
00:12:56,633 --> 00:13:00,034
You always did. Superintendent,
why didn't you give me notice?

157
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:02,469
I'd have met her at Winnipeg
and brought her out here on a special.

158
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,802
You didn't give
the Canadian Pacific a chance.

159
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:06,876
We'll see what can be done
about that in the future.

160
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:09,969
- You bet we will.
- The patrol's ready, Mr. Chambers.

161
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,312
Thank you. I'll be back for a real visit as soon
we've settled with these horse thieves.

162
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,476
- Good night.
- Good night and good luck.

163
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,054
Thanks. We need it.
Thank you, Superintendent.

164
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:21,522
- Not at all. Good night.
- Good night.

165
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:33,397
Probably the same band that
attacked the wagon train, sir.

166
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:37,337
This will give the railroad people another
opportunity to clamor for government troops.

167
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,601
I hope not, sir.

168
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:43,372
We'll try a direct hit.
I wanna get Big Eagle in here for a talk.

169
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,539
It's only a three-hour ride
to his camp.

170
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,049
- If you like, I'll have him here in the morning.
- Good.

171
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:50,176
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

172
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:14,307
dd

173
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,972
dd

174
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:30,987
Good mornin'.
You're up mighty early.

175
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:34,222
- Mr. Monty hasn't come home yet, has he?
- He has not.

176
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,424
- Where did he go?
- On duty.

177
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:39,058
- Where else would he be goin'?
- When will he get back?

178
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,933
I not be knowin' that.

179
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,563
- What are you making?
- Never mind now. Never mind.

180
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,938
Curiosity killed
the cat, you know.

181
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:50,479
You shouldn't be sewing.
That's a woman's work.

182
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,140
Not in the army, darlin'.
That's where I learned it.

183
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,810
You men on the fort should have wives
to do things for you.

184
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,910
Wives, is it?

185
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:00,649
Heaven pity the poor girl
that'd marry a man in this outfit.

186
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:05,160
- Why?
- 'Tis a no-good lot of heartbreakers, they are.

187
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:09,426
- Are you a heartbreaker?
- Well, I've had me day.

188
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:13,696
Of course, I did have certain
disadvantages in the way of a face, but-

189
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:15,794
Hold your hush now.

190
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:18,999
Stop your questions
till I get this last button sewed on.

191
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:22,272
- Is Mr. Monty a heartbreaker too?
- Isn't he, though?

192
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,815
You oughta seen him at Regina
when he was there.

193
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:29,874
Who was he talking about last night
when he said she was so beautiful?

194
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:33,979
- And who'd be askin'?
- Oh, I was just wondering.

195
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,058
You know very well
who he was talking about.

196
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,559
But don't you bother.
She'll be goin' home soon.

197
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:41,563
We'll have Mr. Monty
all to ourselves.

198
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:44,964
There.
It's finished.

199
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:47,696
- And I hope it fits ya.
- Is it for me?

200
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:49,795
And who else would I
be sewin' for all this night?

201
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:52,238
And there's these
to go with it.

202
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:54,970
- I be makin' ya other things
when I get around to it.
- Oh!

203
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:58,536
Now I'm goin' to the mess hall
to get you some breakfast.

204
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:00,639
Thank you, Mr. Pat!
Thank you!

205
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,208
That's all right, darlin'.
That's all right.

206
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:16,155
What are those Indians
coming here for?

207
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,598
Don't worry. They won't hurt you
while you're with us.

208
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:21,364
- Mr. Monty's bringin' 'em in for a powwow.
- Oh.

209
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:24,065
Come along now.

210
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:26,165
He looks all right though,
doesn't he?

211
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,143
Of course he's all right.
Come on. Inside with ya.

212
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:35,045
"The sun has shone on us many
days in peace, my brothers.

213
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:38,450
Now a cloud
passes over the sun.

214
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:42,514
Two days ago,
a wagon train was destroyed.

215
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:48,257
Last night, the Iron Horse camp
was attacked and many horses stolen.''

216
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:53,260
Indians who kill wagon train
steal horses...

217
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,361
not from camp of Big Eagle.

218
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,906
They were Blackfeet.
But if you mean, Wolf Pelt...

219
00:16:58,007 --> 00:17:00,202
that they were from
some other part of your tribe...

220
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,473
that does not lessen
the responsibility of your chief.

221
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,879
If Blackfeet Indian
make trouble...

222
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:11,079
we'll send guilty ones
to white chief.

223
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,883
- I'll hold you to that.
- Give word.

224
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,117
I believe that, Big Eagle.

225
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:20,390
And I'm willing to admit that these raids
may have occurred without your knowledge.

226
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,955
But so that we shall have
a clear understanding in the future...

227
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:28,231
I have prepared a paper,
a fair and honorable bond...

228
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,363
between the white
and the red man.

229
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:36,639
We'll speak in council
with my chiefs.

230
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:40,147
And I'll expect your answer
within five days.

231
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,616
In the meantime,
I'll need some guarantee...

232
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,846
that you'll keep
your warriors in check.

233
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:46,945
Huh?

234
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:51,584
The white chief means he has great
responsibility to the queen mother.

235
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:53,662
He must have some token-

236
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:56,789
the guns of your young braves
or your running horses-

237
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,562
to prove that you'll
keep your promise.

238
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:02,929
Huh.

239
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:10,540
If white chief think Big Eagle
speak with forked tongue...

240
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:14,242
will give something
more close to heart.

241
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,879
Little Chief stay here.

242
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:22,515
Token Big Eagle's word
is straight.

243
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:27,286
That's more
than I'd ask for...

244
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,662
but it will do no harm for your son
to learn the ways of the white man.

245
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:35,602
And you may be sure he'll have the best
treatment that we can offer.

246
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:40,535
Go now.
Send word soon.

247
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:50,816
- The Indians are coming out.
- Oh?

248
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,184
What do you suppose
they were doing in there?

249
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:56,918
Probably gettin' blue blazes from the O.C.
for the devilry they've been up to.

250
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:01,893
There's something
I'd like to tell them too.

251
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:05,832
Where ya goin'?
Come back here. Come back here!

252
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:12,166
Are you the chief Indian?

253
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,903
Hmm.
Me Big Eagle.

254
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:19,880
Well, I certainly hope Mr. Standing is going
to make you Indians behave from now on.

255
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:23,180
And if you got what you deserved,
he'd send you all to jail.

256
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:25,618
That's where you belong for what you've
been doing. What right have you-

257
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:29,624
Here,just a minute, Sue.
You must forgive her, Big Eagle.

258
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:32,957
This little girl was the only survivor
of the wagon train.

259
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:43,237
Golden Hawk,
little spirit of the sun.

260
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:47,105
Big Eagle sorry
you have trouble.

261
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,269
Will not happen again.

262
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,870
I don't see why you want to fight
the white people anrway.

263
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:55,473
They haven't done anything to hurt you.

264
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:58,952
Will send present
to little Golden Hawk.

265
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:04,656
We be good friend now.

266
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:24,436
- Do you really think he's sorry?
- Yes, I'm sure he is.

267
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,515
But where did you
get all this? Mmm!

268
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,675
That's quite an outfit.
You're a regular cowboy.

269
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:30,776
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Mmm.

270
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,912
- Mr. Pat made it.
- Monty?

271
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,991
- Yes, sir.
- I'll turn Little Chief over to you.

272
00:20:36,092 --> 00:20:38,652
- Arrange for his care, will you?
- Very good, sir.

273
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:41,491
Well, so, this is
the little girl you spoke of.

274
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:43,589
Yes, sir.
This is our other guest, Sue Sheldon.

275
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,328
- This is Superintendent Standing, Sue.
- How do you do, sir?

276
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:49,633
How do you do, Sue? I hope you'll
enjoy your stay here with us...

277
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:52,003
until we can find
a home for you.

278
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:55,703
Now, you go with Inspector Montague,
Little Chief. That's right.

279
00:20:57,213 --> 00:20:59,875
Mr. Monty, is he
gonna send me away?

280
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:01,974
Oh, we won't worry
about that now.

281
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:04,212
We'll need you to help
entertain Little Chief.

282
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,256
I'll go see about quarters for you, son,
while you two get acquainted.

283
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:27,567
It's very nice weather
we're having, isn't it?

284
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:30,237
Uh.

285
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:32,405
" Uh''?

286
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:35,875
Is that your pony?

287
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:39,751
I guess Indians learn to ride
when they're babies, don't they?

288
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:43,155
I suppose you don't understand English...

289
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:45,284
so there's no use
my talking to you.

290
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:29,804
You're wonderful.
I mean, you're a wonderful rider.

291
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:32,466
- Squaw ride?
- Well, I, um-

292
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:35,635
Oh, you think I'm a freak, do you?

293
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:38,305
Come on.
Help me on.

294
00:22:38,414 --> 00:22:40,712
Well, aren't you
going to help me?

295
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,615
Brave never help squaw.

296
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,158
You're not very polite, are you?

297
00:22:52,261 --> 00:22:56,163
All right.
I'll get on by myself.

298
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:22,918
Oh!

299
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,164
Well, I could get on
if I had enough time.

300
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:33,326
You never ride horse.
You just papoose.

301
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:36,970
Papoose?

302
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:39,371
Don't you ever call me that again!

303
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:42,273
Stop grunting at me!
And you apologize too!

304
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,403
- Papoose.
- Ooh!

305
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,384
Ooh!

306
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:05,391
Where's Little Chief?
Didn't he wanna play?

307
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:08,368
Mr. Monty, do you know
what he called me?

308
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:11,872
A papoose!
That's Indian for " baby,'' isn't it?

309
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:14,568
- I'm afraid it is.
- I thought so.

310
00:24:14,677 --> 00:24:17,703
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute, Sue. Come here.

311
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:20,647
Come on. Sit down.
Let's talk this thing over.

312
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:24,813
I'm sure Little Chief
didn't mean to be rude.

313
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,549
Indians always treat their women
with a superior air.

314
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:30,888
- The women seem to like it.
- Well, I don't.

315
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:34,394
You know, even if he liked you a lot,
he'd act just the same.

316
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:38,228
You see, we're supposed to be much
more grown-up than they are.

317
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:41,167
There are some things
you just can't put up with.

318
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,830
Papoose!

319
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,502
But, uh, it's our job to understand them
and make allowances.

320
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:51,444
Would you like me
to make allowances for him?

321
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:54,243
He's our guest.
So, if you two had a little spat...

322
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:59,219
I think you oughta make a treaty
and smoke the pipe of peace.

323
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:01,620
All right.
I'll try.

324
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:04,124
I'll give him
one more chance.

325
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:08,220
- But only for your sake.
- That's right. For my sake.

326
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:11,425
I doubt if I can do much
with him though.

327
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:21,972
I've come to make allowances.

328
00:25:24,714 --> 00:25:26,773
I didn't ever expect
to speak to you again.

329
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:29,374
But Mr. Monty says
I'm much more grown-up than you are...

330
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:31,612
and I should try
to understand you.

331
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:34,656
- So we'll smoke the pipe of peace.
- White squaw smoke?

332
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:38,158
Well, I, uh-
I never have.

333
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:41,424
But we're going to make a peace treaty,
and you have to smoke on that, don't you?

334
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,794
I guess that means yes.
So how do we start?

335
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:54,700
Thank you.

336
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,072
I only hope I've got
enough allowances to hold out.

337
00:26:07,556 --> 00:26:12,255
Now, the first part of our treaty is
that you're to stop pushing me.

338
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:14,761
You're not
to be rude anymore.

339
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:18,698
- I mean, uh, any ruder than
an Indian can't help being.

340
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:22,362
And the second is that you teach me
to ride as well as you do.

341
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:25,269
- Much work.
- There you go.

342
00:26:25,374 --> 00:26:29,003
- Are you going to make a treaty, or aren't you?
- Make treaty.

343
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:33,946
And the third part is that you're not
to call me " papoose'' again.

344
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,018
Do you hear?

345
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:38,177
Does that mean yes?

346
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:42,815
Can't you stop grunting? Say yes when you
mean yes, and no when you mean no!

347
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:46,326
Now, do you understand that?

348
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:48,397
What's the use?

349
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,727
I guess you mean yes.

350
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:55,736
Well, I can't think of anything else
just now, so we'd better smoke on it.

351
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:58,398
I expect you'd
better light it.

352
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,935
Here.

353
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:18,987
Now squaw smoke.

354
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:31,306
It isn't bad!
Anybody can make a treaty like this.

355
00:27:38,214 --> 00:27:41,274
Oh, dear.

356
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:41,803
Must find Indians
who raid wagon train...

357
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:44,971
and steal from
Iron Horse camp...

358
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:50,075
so redcoat chief know
we speak with straight tongue.

359
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,451
Think ones who make war
on white man...

360
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:56,855
are from camp
of Lone Buffalo.

361
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:59,450
Huh? Why you think that?

362
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:04,499
Know they make medicine
to sun god for war two moons ago.

363
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,661
I go find out
if they ones who do it.

364
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:11,604
All right.
You go.

365
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:15,302
If find guilty ones,
take to redcoat chief...

366
00:29:15,411 --> 00:29:20,678
so he know Big Eagle
keep word and speak truth.

367
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:22,842
Mmm.

368
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:27,378
dd

369
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,481
- Get me a handkerchief.
- Yes, sir.

370
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:32,686
dd

371
00:29:32,795 --> 00:29:35,286
You look, uh,
very nice.

372
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:38,389
Thank you, Sue.

373
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:43,460
- How do you think I look?
- You look very nice t-

374
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:46,541
Mm-mm! Where did
you get that dress?

375
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:49,236
- Mr. Pat bought it for me.
- Well, well. Good for Pat.

376
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:51,336
Thank you, sir.

377
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:55,975
It would be a nice dress
to go to a party in, wouldn't it?

378
00:29:56,085 --> 00:30:00,988
-You'd be the belle of the ball.
-If I was invited to a party.

379
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:05,525
Glory be. Where in
heaven's name are they?

380
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:08,028
- Now what's the matter?
- Your handkerchiefs, sir.

381
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,327
I put 'em in the top drawer here where they're
always put, but there's never a one of'em.

382
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:13,424
Oh, the handkerchiefs!

383
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:16,596
You had them in with Mr. Monty's
shaving thing, so I changed them.

384
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:19,401
I put the shirts in where the socks used to
be, and I put the socks in with the underwear...

385
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:22,272
where the nightshirts used to be, and I
put the nightshirts in with the sheets.

386
00:30:22,378 --> 00:30:25,506
- But where did you put the handkerchiefs?
- In with the socks.

387
00:30:25,614 --> 00:30:29,744
And it's taken me two years to educate
himself where to put his hands on things.

388
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:32,787
- I was only trying to help.
- Ohh!

389
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:38,253
What are you doing?
Give me that!

390
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,727
It's only a piece of old buffalo skin I've
been using to rub up Mr. Monty's boots.

391
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,424
- Ohh!
- Why, Sue, that's Pat's pride and joy.

392
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:46,558
- It's his toupee.
- Toupee?

393
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:49,604
- Sure. Show her, Pat.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:52,799
Oh, no. Put it on.

395
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,035
Oh, it's your hair.

396
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,307
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't know.

397
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:02,475
It makes you look so handsome.
You oughta wear it all the time.

398
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:04,576
Oh, yes.
He's a lady-killer with that on.

399
00:31:04,687 --> 00:31:08,123
He wears it on leave, and uses it
to fool the redskins too, don't you?

400
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:10,283
Yes, sir.
If any of them comes after me...

401
00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:13,418
it's the toupee he'll get
and not me scalp, I hope.

402
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:16,394
- Your handkerchief, sir.
- You'd better get another one.

403
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:19,661
- You'll need two for dancing.
- Two? Why?

404
00:31:19,768 --> 00:31:21,759
An extra one to hold against
the lady's back.

405
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,896
Faith and help. She's right, sir.
I'll get you another one.

406
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:26,998
You seem to know
a lot about dancing, Sue.

407
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:29,942
I do. My grandfather
was a wonderful fiddler.

408
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:33,674
- I learned how to dance from him.
- Here you are, sir.

409
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,512
Sue, come here.

410
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:43,355
Sue, uh, between you and me,
I'm in an awful hole tonight.

411
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:47,259
- I don't know the first thing about dancing.
- Oh, I can teach you.

412
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,526
I'll go with you to the party,
and you can dance with me until you learn.

413
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,999
Mm-mmm. That wouldn't be so good,
because they might catch on.

414
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:56,663
Besides, it'd keep you up too late.
Couldn't you show me right here?

415
00:31:56,772 --> 00:32:00,208
Yes. But it would be better
if I went with you so we'd have music.

416
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:04,678
- I can whistle.
- Well, what dance will we start with?

417
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,977
Well, uh-
Why, is there more than one?

418
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:11,109
Of course. The waltz, the schottische,
the two-step, the polka-

419
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,950
Whoa. We'll just
concentrate on one.

420
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:16,991
That, uh-That waltz sounds familiar.
How does it go?

421
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:19,993
Come on.
I'll show you.

422
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:22,461
Now, put your arm
around me, like this.

423
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:25,556
- Wait a minute. I want my handkerchief.
- That's very important.

424
00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:27,727
- Now, give me your other hand.
- Like this?

425
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:30,498
- Yes. You start with your left foot.
- Left foot. All right.

426
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:32,574
- You ready?
- Yeah.

427
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:35,405
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

428
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:38,241
-Just glide on easy. One-
- One, two, three. Oh!

429
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:42,044
- The main thing is to dance very smoothly.
- Uh-huh.

430
00:32:42,151 --> 00:32:44,585
Here. Try this.

431
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:47,713
Now, stoop down.

432
00:32:47,823 --> 00:32:51,384
Don't let it fall. That's the way
they teach you in dancing school.

433
00:32:51,493 --> 00:32:53,723
I don't know.
I hope I can keep it up there.

434
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:56,855
You can.
Now, let's try it again.

435
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:59,991
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

436
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:04,163
You're doing much better.
One, two, three. That's fine.

437
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:08,334
Just glide along like you were rippling
over water. Oh!

438
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,776
Oh! We sort of
went overboard, didn't we?

439
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:12,938
You're getting a little
mixed up with your feet.

440
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:15,608
Maybe I'd better show you how it goes
first, and then we can dance together.

441
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:18,243
- Maybe that would be better.
- Now watch me.

442
00:33:18,354 --> 00:33:23,257
dd

443
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:31,866
dd

444
00:33:35,204 --> 00:33:39,971
Now with me.
dd

445
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:59,426
dd

446
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:11,940
dd

447
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,134
- dd
- dd

448
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:25,611
dd

449
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:33,251
You must be very fond of that piece.
They've played it every time we've danced.

450
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,592
Well, uh, the boys
know it's my favorite.

451
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:37,665
That's the music
I learned to waltz to.

452
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:41,202
- I see.
- I can remember it just as though it were tonight.

453
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:44,101
dd

454
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,542
Time Little Squaw
go sleep.

455
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,882
I guess if everybody else can stay up
dancing, I can stay up and watch them.

456
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:07,522
- Redcoat make her his squaw?
- He will not!

457
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:12,589
Funny. Dance like that
and not make her his squaw.

458
00:35:14,303 --> 00:35:16,498
He's only doing that
to be nice to her.

459
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:19,073
Indian dance better.
Use feathers.

460
00:35:19,174 --> 00:35:23,508
- Oh, let me try it on!
- No. Only brave wear feathers.

461
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:26,012
- Well, I've got one anrway.
- Mmm.

462
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:28,742
- Where did you get all these things?
- Warrior bring.

463
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:34,016
Bring teepee too.
Little Chief no sleep white man house.

464
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:36,818
You could sleep anrwhere
if you were tired enough.

465
00:35:36,925 --> 00:35:40,861
Mmm. Forgot.
My father sent pony. Present for you.

466
00:35:40,963 --> 00:35:43,557
A pony for me?
Where is it? Show me!

467
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:49,103
- Aren't you coming?
- Brave always go first.

468
00:35:49,204 --> 00:35:51,195
Squaw walk behind.

469
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:53,604
Walk behind?
I will not!

470
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:55,836
Then brave not go.

471
00:35:55,944 --> 00:35:58,435
If we hadn't made
a peace treaty-

472
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,606
Well, all right.

473
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:03,617
But this is just about
the last of my allowances.

474
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:06,688
Mmm.

475
00:36:09,024 --> 00:36:11,288
All I can say is that
if Indian women put up...

476
00:36:11,393 --> 00:36:13,918
with being treated like this,
they must be-

477
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:17,931
Squaw keep quiet
and walk behind brave.

478
00:36:20,736 --> 00:36:22,761
dd

479
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:25,567
- Make mine a two-step, boys.
- Give me a minute, Harlan.

480
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:27,642
- I'd like a glass of water.
- I'll get it.

481
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:30,234
Thank you.

482
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:34,111
- Now we'll have him back on our hands.
- Why not?

483
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:38,084
- Making three a crowd, aren't you?
- Everyone's my crowd tonight.

484
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:40,814
You know, with all this attention,
I'm beginning to appreciate...

485
00:36:40,923 --> 00:36:43,118
the advantages
of being a pioneer woman.

486
00:36:43,225 --> 00:36:45,420
That's great
while the fun lasts, Vicky.

487
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,495
But you won't feel that way
when the going gets rough.

488
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:49,723
That's bound to happen
out here, you know.

489
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,890
And you think I couldn't
stand up to it if it did?

490
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,400
I know you couldn't.

491
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,940
Look, will you tell me why everybody wants
to rush me back to Toronto?

492
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,305
Well, I was really
thinking of myself.

493
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,243
You see, we'll be stopping
construction soon because of the snow.

494
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:07,804
And, naturally, I'd like you there when I
go back home for the holidays.

495
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:10,111
But suppose I
have other plans?

496
00:37:10,218 --> 00:37:13,449
I might decide to become
a pioneer woman at that.

497
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:17,013
- Don't you think I could, Mr. Montague?
- Beg pardon, Miss Vicky?

498
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,787
Don't you think I could
become a pioneer woman?

499
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:22,523
I'm sure you could...
if you set your mind to it.

500
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:24,963
There you are.
That's one vote for me.

501
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:27,160
dd

502
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:33,537
Isn't that a tom-tom? It's getting closer.

503
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,178
You stay here, Vicky.

504
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:41,272
dd

505
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:12,709
- What was it?
- Sue and Little Chief are on the warpath.

506
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:19,978
dd

507
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:26,686
No more dance. Squaw laugh.

508
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:29,764
I'm awfully sorry. Honest.
I won't do it anymore.

509
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:32,891
Please don't stop dancing.
We're enjoying it.

510
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:34,992
Maybe one day
you'll teach me an Indian dance.

511
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:41,165
Isn't he rude?

512
00:38:41,276 --> 00:38:43,244
These Indians
certainly are a problem.

513
00:38:43,345 --> 00:38:46,041
You don't seem to have much difficulty
handling Little Chief.

514
00:38:46,148 --> 00:38:48,116
It took time for me
to understand him.

515
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:50,912
But it was worth it, because I
expect to be here for a long time.

516
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:53,852
- Really?
- Yes. But it wouldn't be worthwhile...

517
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:57,118
for you to go to all that trouble,
because you're going home soon.

518
00:38:57,225 --> 00:39:00,888
- Am I?
- Aren't you?

519
00:39:00,996 --> 00:39:02,964
Mr. Pat said you were.
And I'm sure you wouldn't...

520
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:05,966
- like it out here anrway, because it's full of-
- Sue.

521
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:08,298
- Good night.
- Good night.

522
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:13,239
I'll wait up for you. You'll need someone
to put your clothes away.

523
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:16,606
And if someone is up when I get there,
they'll be off to bed with a slipper.

524
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:18,771
Come on.
Kiss me good night.

525
00:39:20,716 --> 00:39:23,082
- Now what do you say?
- See you first thing in the morning.

526
00:39:23,185 --> 00:39:25,676
- Good night, Sue.
- Good night, Mr. Monty.

527
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:30,551
I hope you're not offended.
She's a very strange child.

528
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,093
Strange?
I don't think so.

529
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:35,390
- She adores you.
- Hmm?

530
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:38,466
It's just that you're slow
to notice things like that.

531
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:43,163
- Perhaps.
- I say, are we men supposed
to dance with each other?

532
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:45,535
Come on.

533
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:55,007
What's the matter now?

534
00:39:55,117 --> 00:39:57,813
You have a face as long
as the old woman that kissed the cow.

535
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:03,853
- He's in love with her.
- Me darlin'.

536
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:07,520
'Tis one of the delightful misfortunes
that overtakes the male of the species.

537
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:10,154
'Tis me that knows.

538
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:15,126
I wish she'd go back
where she came from.

539
00:40:15,237 --> 00:40:18,468
Oh-ho.
'Tis jealous, you are.

540
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:22,134
I am not. But she couldn't take care
of him the way we do.

541
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:24,212
I'll bet she couldn't
even make his bed.

542
00:40:24,312 --> 00:40:26,974
- And you're not doing it right either.
- I'm not, ain't I?

543
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:29,346
You haven't the covers up
close enough around his neck.

544
00:40:29,451 --> 00:40:31,976
- Oh. Huh.
- And you should unfold his nightshirt...

545
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:34,055
and have it
all laid out for him.

546
00:40:34,156 --> 00:40:38,183
What are you tryin' to do, spoil him?
Here, me bucko, I'll take that.

547
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:47,833
Oh, Mr. Pat! And I taught him
how to dance with her.

548
00:40:47,936 --> 00:40:51,303
Heaven help us.

549
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:54,204
I know, I know.

550
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:57,301
'Tis a terrible thing
to be a woman in love.

551
00:40:57,412 --> 00:41:00,813
- Oh, Mr. Pat!
- Ah, yes, I understand.

552
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,646
Never you mind.
Never you mind now.

553
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,220
And it's
a heartbreaking ruffian he is.

554
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:10,655
He is not a ruffian.
I won't let you say that.

555
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:14,525
Oh, well, have it
your own way, me darlin'.

556
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:16,722
Have it your own way.

557
00:41:16,832 --> 00:41:20,359
Close them pretty eyes now.

558
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:24,928
dd

559
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:37,074
Good night, Miss Standing.
It's the jolliest night we've ever had.

560
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:39,551
- Good night.
- Good night.

561
00:41:39,654 --> 00:41:41,986
- Certainly a lovely party.
- What's this?

562
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:03,975
Chief Big Eagle say here bad Indians
who make trouble for covered wagon...

563
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,445
and steal horses
from Iron Horse camp.

564
00:42:06,548 --> 00:42:10,314
He send to you.
Show redcoat he keep word.

565
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:18,355
Take them
to the guardroom.

566
00:42:36,511 --> 00:42:39,309
- This fellow's dead, sir. He's been stabbed.
- They're all dead, sir.

567
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:48,684
Order out a detail
to bury them.

568
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,531
Well, this looks as if Big Eagle
is showing his defiance.

569
00:43:02,637 --> 00:43:05,367
He knows the dispensing of justice
belongs to the Mounted Police.

570
00:43:05,473 --> 00:43:08,806
I'll take that up with him
when he comes to sign the treaty.

571
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,606
If it's ever signed.

572
00:43:11,713 --> 00:43:14,876
Chambers, if I should decide
to send Vicky home...

573
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:17,611
could you do anything for me
in the way of transportation?

574
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:20,654
I certainly could, sir. There's a supply
train up on Sunday morning...

575
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:22,723
that'll take her as far
as Winnipeg.

576
00:43:22,824 --> 00:43:24,985
From there, she can connect
with the Eastern Limited.

577
00:43:25,093 --> 00:43:27,687
I agree with you. It'd be wise
to get her away from here.

578
00:43:27,796 --> 00:43:30,526
- I'll let you know.
- No, thanks. I won't come in now.

579
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:33,624
I better get back to the camp
to see that everything's all right then.

580
00:43:33,735 --> 00:43:35,930
- Good night.
- Good night, Chambers.

581
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:48,209
Won't you eat your eggs, sir?
They're that fresh...

582
00:43:48,316 --> 00:43:51,649
I just saw the cook take them
from under the hen with his own hands.

583
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:53,778
Oh, no, thanks.

584
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:08,827
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

585
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:12,566
Here's your baked apple and milk.
All ready for you.

586
00:44:12,674 --> 00:44:16,872
- I'm not hungry this morning, thank you.
- Heaven help us.

587
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:20,675
There's more than one sufferin' from the
same complaint this morning, I'm thinking.

588
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:22,750
Well, I'll get
a bit of work done. Sir?

589
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:25,149
Hmm? Oh, yes.
Go ahead.

590
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:33,594
Was it a nice party?

591
00:44:33,695 --> 00:44:35,925
Yes, very nice.

592
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:38,056
Is she a good dancer?

593
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,930
Very good.

594
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:44,028
- Better than I am?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

595
00:44:46,374 --> 00:44:48,899
- Are you going to marry her?
- Marry her?

596
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:53,538
Well, I was watching you
dance together last night.

597
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:57,709
And the way she looked at you, and the way
you looked at her, I thought maybe-

598
00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:00,652
Don't you think you
ought to have your breakfast?

599
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:06,387
Yes, sir. But I supposed that when people
were in love, they always got married.

600
00:45:06,494 --> 00:45:08,587
She's going home tomorrow.

601
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:10,789
Even Little Chief-

602
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:14,062
- She is? She's really going home?
- Mm-hmm.

603
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:17,605
Oh, isn't that a shame? Won't you sit
over here in the rocking chair?

604
00:45:17,705 --> 00:45:20,105
- It's much more comfortable.
- No, thanks.

605
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:23,644
I'll get you your pipe.
Would you like your pipe?

606
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:26,839
Here's-
Here's some matches too.

607
00:45:26,948 --> 00:45:31,749
I guess you smoke more matches than you do
tobacco. Can I get you anything else?

608
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:33,912
No, thanks. You'd better run along
and play with Little Chief.

609
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,185
- If you need me for anything,just send Mr. Pat.
- I will.

610
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,329
Hello, Mr. Pat!
Hello, Mr. Pat! Hello!

611
00:45:47,235 --> 00:45:49,260
- Hello!
- Hello, Susannah.

612
00:46:16,297 --> 00:46:18,561
- Hi, Carruthers.
- Good morning.

613
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:21,863
Oh, good morning, Miss Vicky.
I was hoping I'd see you before you left.

614
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:26,339
I'm sorry we have to say good-bye, but Dad
isn't in favor of my becoming a pioneer woman.

615
00:46:26,441 --> 00:46:29,239
He's right, Miss Vicky.
This really isn't the place for you.

616
00:46:29,344 --> 00:46:32,575
Are you going to keep it
a man's country forever?

617
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,910
It's apt to be that way
for quite a while yet.

618
00:46:35,016 --> 00:46:38,747
Well, I suppose if we're ever to see each
other again, you'll have to come to Toronto.

619
00:46:38,853 --> 00:46:41,048
I'm afraid there's not
much chance of that.

620
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:44,853
- Why?
- We'll be pushing farther west every year...

621
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:48,258
and by the time I get back to Toronto,
you'll probably be married...

622
00:46:48,363 --> 00:46:51,025
- and have a family of grown-up children.
- And what about you?

623
00:46:51,132 --> 00:46:55,432
Oh, I guess I'll just end up
being the old man of the mountain.

624
00:46:55,537 --> 00:47:00,338
Well, good-bye.
I'll always remember the fun we've had...

625
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:04,275
and I'll probably find myself wishing I could
hear you sing that little waltz song again.

626
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:09,078
And I'll find myself wishing
it wasn't so far to Toronto.

627
00:47:10,385 --> 00:47:12,444
Good-bye, Vicky.

628
00:47:37,545 --> 00:47:39,877
Squaw ride faster!

629
00:47:39,981 --> 00:47:42,279
I'm coming
as fast as I can!

630
00:47:46,354 --> 00:47:48,754
- Squaw ride like-
- Don't you dare say it!

631
00:47:53,428 --> 00:47:55,658
- White man buy?
- Take your time.

632
00:47:55,763 --> 00:47:57,754
If they're sound,
we'll make a deal.

633
00:47:57,865 --> 00:47:59,992
What are they doing
over there?

634
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:02,228
Wolf Pelt sell horses
to railroad.

635
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,498
Let's go watch.
Come on.

636
00:48:05,573 --> 00:48:08,974
Oh, all right!

637
00:48:09,077 --> 00:48:12,979
Go ahead.
I'm getting used to being a squaw.

638
00:48:13,081 --> 00:48:17,142
Aah! No have to look.
How much pay?

639
00:48:17,252 --> 00:48:22,087
- We'll settle that later.
- You'll buy now. All good horses.

640
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,182
Sure. Three of them's very good horses.
They oughta be.

641
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:28,456
They're three that were stolen in the raid
and wasn't brought back with the others.

642
00:48:28,563 --> 00:48:30,861
White man lie.
Indian ponies.

643
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:33,365
Yeah? Well,
there's Bully Boy...

644
00:48:33,468 --> 00:48:36,266
that's LadyJane,
and there's Steamboat.

645
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,396
And I'll prove it.

646
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:43,968
They didn't even make
a good job of dyeing it!

647
00:48:44,078 --> 00:48:46,478
More of
your thieving tricks.

648
00:48:46,581 --> 00:48:49,379
I wouldn't do business with your breed
if I had to go without horses!

649
00:48:49,484 --> 00:48:51,475
You leave those animals here
and clear out.

650
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:54,521
- White man pay.
- I'll give you nothing.

651
00:48:54,622 --> 00:48:56,988
If you got what you deserve,
I'd take it out of your hide.!

652
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:59,616
- Let us handle him, boss.
- We'll take care of him.

653
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:02,560
- Wait a minute.!
- You've been babied
by the redcoats long enough...

654
00:49:02,664 --> 00:49:04,723
but you're at the end
of the rope with me.

655
00:49:04,832 --> 00:49:07,027
I'm going to have the railroad bring out
government troops to deal with you.

656
00:49:07,135 --> 00:49:09,660
Iron Horse bring soldiers?

657
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:14,037
Yes, plenty of them.
They'll keep you in order... with bullets.

658
00:49:14,142 --> 00:49:17,509
All right.
White chief has spoken.

659
00:49:17,612 --> 00:49:20,080
Don't let 'em get away!

660
00:49:28,456 --> 00:49:30,481
Hold him up.! Get him.!

661
00:49:33,027 --> 00:49:35,052
- Hang him.!
- Hang him.!
- Hang him.!

662
00:49:35,163 --> 00:49:37,222
You kids better clear out.
This is no place for you.

663
00:49:37,332 --> 00:49:40,529
- White man no right beat Indian.
- Run along before you get hurt.

664
00:49:40,635 --> 00:49:45,834
Come on, Little Chief.

665
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,857
Natosi,
sun god, not answer.

666
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:17,904
Three suns pass
since talk to redcoat chief.

667
00:50:18,005 --> 00:50:20,064
He wait for our answer.

668
00:50:20,174 --> 00:50:25,237
Natosi turn face away from our medicine.

669
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:39,459
My fathers, see what white men
have done to your children.

670
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,256
This is what they do when
go their camp in friendship.

671
00:50:42,363 --> 00:50:46,629
- Take them to squaw.
- White man's words are sweet, but heart bitter.

672
00:50:46,734 --> 00:50:50,795
- Who has done this, my son?
- Men who make trail for Iron Horse.

673
00:50:50,905 --> 00:50:55,308
And now their chief has spoken. Iron Horse
soon bring soldiers, kill our people!

674
00:50:58,045 --> 00:51:00,605
Will we wait while
white warriors come like locusts?

675
00:51:00,715 --> 00:51:03,115
Drive off people
from land like buffalo?

676
00:51:03,217 --> 00:51:09,156
I say not listen redcoat chief who talk
peace and give us lies on paper...

677
00:51:09,257 --> 00:51:11,782
who take your son
and call himself your brother.!

678
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:14,020
I say make war
while able!

679
00:51:14,128 --> 00:51:16,619
- Destroy trail of Iron Horse.!
-dd

680
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:19,791
Drive out white men!
All white men!

681
00:51:22,203 --> 00:51:26,003
Medicine answered.
Natosi angered. Natosi say war.

682
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:38,510
dd

683
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:46,585
dd

684
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:56,597
dd

685
00:52:11,185 --> 00:52:14,279
dd

686
00:53:13,814 --> 00:53:16,442
It looks like war on a big scale.
The signal fires are burning...

687
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:18,917
and the tribes are gathering
from every part of the west.

688
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,922
Mr. Monty! Mr. Monty, I'm so glad
you're back! I was so worried.

689
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:25,891
- You shouldn't be up this late, Sue.
- But I had to tell you.

690
00:53:25,993 --> 00:53:28,791
Little Chief said the Indians are going
to kill all the white men in redcoats...

691
00:53:28,896 --> 00:53:30,887
because of what happened
at the railroad camp.

692
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:32,966
- At the railroad camp?
- What happened, Sue?

693
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:36,559
The Indians tried to sell Mr. Chambers
his own horses back.

694
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:39,162
He got so mad, because they
were trying to cheat him...

695
00:53:39,273 --> 00:53:41,798
he said he was gonna bring soldiers
out to make them behave.

696
00:53:41,909 --> 00:53:44,275
The Indians didn't like that.
When they tried to leave...

697
00:53:44,378 --> 00:53:48,337
the workmen pulled them off their horses
and started hitting them.

698
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:52,283
I can try to reach Big Eagle and explain that he
has nothing to fear from Chambers's threats.

699
00:53:52,386 --> 00:53:54,354
I'm afraid it's too late for talk now.

700
00:53:54,455 --> 00:53:56,855
- What is it, Father? More trouble?
- Yes, Vicky. Plenty.

701
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:59,552
And our friend Chambers
started it.

702
00:54:01,629 --> 00:54:03,688
Let's take a look
from the tower.

703
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:15,099
dd

704
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:08,557
- Now squaw put out finger.
- And let you cut it? I will not.

705
00:55:08,663 --> 00:55:12,963
- Squaw afraid?
- Well, no.

706
00:55:20,975 --> 00:55:23,205
Oh, you did!
It's bleeding!

707
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,040
Now put together.

708
00:55:26,147 --> 00:55:30,277
Make Golden Hawk and Little Chief
blood brothers.

709
00:55:30,384 --> 00:55:33,148
You mean this will
make me an Indian?

710
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:35,313
Mm. Indian now.

711
00:55:37,158 --> 00:55:41,458
- Will my face turn red?
- No. You stay paleface.

712
00:55:41,562 --> 00:55:43,587
I'm glad of that.

713
00:55:43,698 --> 00:55:46,326
Oh, but if I'm a member
of your tribe...

714
00:55:46,434 --> 00:55:49,130
they'll all be my relations,
won't they?

715
00:55:49,236 --> 00:55:52,967
Not Wolf Pelt.
He bad Indian.

716
00:55:53,074 --> 00:55:56,771
- Him steal horses from white man camp.
- He did?

717
00:55:56,877 --> 00:56:00,108
Then why didn't your father send him
to Mr. Standing, like he did the others?

718
00:56:00,214 --> 00:56:04,173
Father not know.
Wolf Pelt lie.

719
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:08,585
Say he not one of them.
Other Indians not tell.

720
00:56:08,689 --> 00:56:13,752
- Well, I'm going to tell.
- You belong to tribe now. Must keep secret.

721
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:18,696
- But he should be punished.
- We catch him Wolf Pelt right time.

722
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,360
Not tell now.
We put in treaty.

723
00:56:29,577 --> 00:56:32,705
Oh, dear.

724
00:57:15,489 --> 00:57:19,323
Come on! Get ready!
They're coming this way! Hurry up!

725
00:57:19,426 --> 00:57:22,054
Come on!

726
00:58:11,412 --> 00:58:14,506
- Superintendent in?
- Yes, sir.

727
00:58:16,984 --> 00:58:19,418
- What's happened?
- Our camp was raided.
We had to fight our way out.

728
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,887
I told you weeks ago that you couldn't keep
order in this territory without troops.

729
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:26,153
Now we're trapped. The tracks are torn
up behind us, and the bridge is burned.

730
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:30,993
The telegraph lines are down. They probably
killed half the men in my camp by now.

731
00:58:31,098 --> 00:58:33,498
Mount a detachment
to go to their aid.

732
00:58:33,601 --> 00:58:36,934
Bring the workmen here if the situation
warrants and have Churchill take charge.

733
00:58:37,037 --> 00:58:42,441
- Yes, sir.
- The few men you send won't stop
2,000 bloodthirsty savages.

734
00:58:42,543 --> 00:58:44,773
We wouldn't be facing this situation,
Mr. Chambers...

735
00:58:44,879 --> 00:58:47,507
if it weren't
for your unreasonable conduct.

736
00:58:47,615 --> 00:58:50,914
- My unreasonable conduct?
- Your presuming on our authority...

737
00:58:51,018 --> 00:58:53,816
threatening to bring the militia
here to make war on the Indians.

738
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:56,481
Well, I- Perhaps
I was a little hasty.

739
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:59,286
You were more than that.
Your stupidity is responsible...

740
00:58:59,393 --> 00:59:02,590
for endangering lives
and property in my charge.

741
00:59:02,696 --> 00:59:05,028
In the future,
keep to the building of your railroad...

742
00:59:05,132 --> 00:59:07,430
but leave dealing with the Indians
to the mounted police.

743
00:59:21,448 --> 00:59:24,713
Inspector Montague?

744
00:59:27,488 --> 00:59:31,822
Have the gates closed and see that the men
are prepared for any emergency.

745
00:59:31,926 --> 00:59:34,019
Yes, sir.

746
01:00:18,439 --> 01:00:21,670
Redcoats go to Iron Horse camp.
Now we get Little Chief.

747
01:00:39,226 --> 01:00:41,751
Sound the alarm!

748
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:52,869
dd

749
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,957
Keep Sue in there,
and you stay with her.

750
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,119
All right. Come on.

751
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:29,795
Vicky, quick!
Inside!

752
01:02:40,647 --> 01:02:43,741
- Here's some more ammunition, Mr. Pat.
- Thank you, darlin'.

753
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:02,699
Get down. Get down.
Get down.

754
01:03:02,803 --> 01:03:05,169
Get behind me.
Get behind me. That's it.

755
01:03:08,842 --> 01:03:11,402
I got it! I got it!

756
01:03:18,285 --> 01:03:21,618
Here it is.

757
01:03:25,392 --> 01:03:29,123
Thank you.

758
01:04:03,363 --> 01:04:05,627
That's it.

759
01:04:05,732 --> 01:04:09,759
Mr. Pat, I've looked everywhere, and nobody
seems to know what's become of Mr. Monty.

760
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:12,395
Never you mind now.
You've had no rest all night.

761
01:04:12,506 --> 01:04:14,667
Sit down there, and as soon as I finish
this, I'll get ya a bit of breakfast.

762
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:18,074
I couldn't eat. I'd better
go back out and keep on looking.

763
01:04:18,178 --> 01:04:20,237
Oh, well-

764
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,347
Sergeant MacGregor,
are you all right, sir?

765
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:27,443
Aye, lassie.
Just a wee nip in the hand.

766
01:04:27,554 --> 01:04:31,490
- Have you seen Mr. Monty?
- Well, no. I can't say that I have.

767
01:04:31,592 --> 01:04:35,926
He isn't in the hospital with the wounded
men, the guardroom or the stables.

768
01:04:36,029 --> 01:04:39,590
- I've looked almost every place.
- D'n' worry your head, lassie.

769
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,295
Mr. Monty can take care of himself
under any circumstances.

770
01:04:43,403 --> 01:04:45,871
Thank you, sir.

771
01:04:52,613 --> 01:04:55,605
Take him to the stables.

772
01:04:55,716 --> 01:05:00,210
Inspector Randall?
Inspector Randall!

773
01:05:03,657 --> 01:05:06,820
- Yes, Inspector?
- I was taken prisoner while on patrol, sir...

774
01:05:06,927 --> 01:05:08,986
and held
at Big Eagle's camp.

775
01:05:09,096 --> 01:05:11,530
Just before dawn this morning,
Inspector Montague was brought in.

776
01:05:11,632 --> 01:05:13,964
- I was released to bring you a message.
- Go on.

777
01:05:14,067 --> 01:05:17,002
Big Eagle demands that the railroad
leave his territory within two days...

778
01:05:17,104 --> 01:05:20,562
or Inspector Montague will not be returned
and hostilities will be reopened.

779
01:05:20,674 --> 01:05:23,336
What will you do, Father?
You must send some word.

780
01:05:23,443 --> 01:05:26,742
There's only one answer
refusal.

781
01:05:26,847 --> 01:05:29,645
Thank you, Randall.

782
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:32,810
Mr. Standing, aren't you going
to try to save him?

783
01:05:32,919 --> 01:05:35,410
- Of course, Sue.
- Well, there must be some way to rescue him.

784
01:05:35,522 --> 01:05:40,550
There aren't many of us. If we tried and failed,
they'd put him to death immediately.

785
01:05:40,661 --> 01:05:44,597
We'll need help. I'll get a message out
to the nearest post.

786
01:05:44,698 --> 01:05:48,498
They may get here
in time.

787
01:05:58,612 --> 01:06:03,914
Iron Horse still go on.
If don't go away, you die.

788
01:06:04,017 --> 01:06:08,044
Iron Horse won't go away,
Little Chief, not for me or anyone else.

789
01:06:08,155 --> 01:06:12,353
Chief redcoat big fool.
All white men be killed.

790
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:14,859
If they do,
many more will come...

791
01:06:14,961 --> 01:06:17,361
and it'll be very bad medicine
for the Indians.

792
01:06:17,464 --> 01:06:20,797
Big talk.
Indian kill them too.

793
01:06:27,307 --> 01:06:31,767
- I get cold water for sick head.
- Thanks. That would be a help.

794
01:06:31,878 --> 01:06:36,315
Do it for Golden Hawk.
She your friend.

795
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:41,820
Too bad you die.
Make her feel sorry.

796
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:19,986
You know I'm not a very good rider,
but you go as fast as you can.

797
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:23,187
I'll stick on some way.

798
01:07:28,568 --> 01:07:31,036
Hold still.

799
01:08:00,801 --> 01:08:05,465
You oughta know which way the Indian
camp is. You used to live there.

800
01:08:05,572 --> 01:08:08,405
Maybe you're thirsty.

801
01:08:10,577 --> 01:08:13,375
Have a drink.

802
01:08:28,862 --> 01:08:30,921
Hurry up.

803
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:35,558
Oh. Oh, hello.

804
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:40,368
- Would you please tell me the way
to Mr. Big Eagle's camp?

805
01:08:40,474 --> 01:08:43,238
I've gotta go there.
It's terribly, terribly important.

806
01:08:43,343 --> 01:08:48,007
- It's all right for me to go there,
'cause he's a friend.

807
01:08:48,114 --> 01:08:51,208
He gave me this pony.
We know each other very, very well.

808
01:08:51,318 --> 01:08:55,118
Won't you take me to him, please?

809
01:08:58,391 --> 01:09:01,554
Thank you very much.
May I see Mr. Big Eagle now?

810
01:09:01,661 --> 01:09:04,789
- Not now. You stay here.
- But-

811
01:09:06,032 --> 01:09:08,091
Why, Sue!

812
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:10,897
Oh, Mr. Monty,
have they hurt you?

813
01:09:11,004 --> 01:09:13,302
I'm all right, dear.
How did you get here?

814
01:09:13,406 --> 01:09:16,375
I came to see Mr. Big Eagle,
but they won't let me talk to him.

815
01:09:16,476 --> 01:09:18,444
- You shouldn't have come.
- I had to.

816
01:09:21,381 --> 01:09:24,248
Mr. Standing sent
to another post for help...

817
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:27,946
but they can't get here in time,
so after dark tonight...

818
01:09:28,054 --> 01:09:31,217
he's coming with a few men
to try to rescue you.

819
01:09:31,324 --> 01:09:34,816
But he's afraid that
if the Indians see him coming, they'll-

820
01:09:34,928 --> 01:09:39,456
- I have to see Mr. Big Eagle somehow,
before it gets dark.
- It won't do any good, Sue.

821
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:43,559
It will.
I know it will.

822
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:48,767
- Please, Mr. Indian, won't you let me talk to-
- You go back.

823
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:52,333
Come over here, dear.
Stay near me.

824
01:09:52,445 --> 01:09:55,505
Oh, Mr. Monty...

825
01:09:55,615 --> 01:10:00,643
if they do anything to you,
they'll have to kill me too.

826
01:10:24,978 --> 01:10:27,572
dd

827
01:10:45,065 --> 01:10:48,057
Redcoats on way!
They are coming!

828
01:10:53,773 --> 01:10:57,504
Signal say redcoat leave post.
On way here.

829
01:10:57,611 --> 01:11:00,546
Make ready now.

830
01:11:02,015 --> 01:11:05,314
dd

831
01:11:22,802 --> 01:11:25,293
You come now.

832
01:11:35,215 --> 01:11:38,480
- Please! What are you going to do?
- Stop it, Wolf Pelt.

833
01:11:41,121 --> 01:11:44,090
- But they can't take you!
- Sue, remember? You promised.

834
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:47,591
- I'm not crying. Please. Let me go too.
- You'll stay.

835
01:11:47,694 --> 01:11:50,356
Then bring Mr. Big Eagle
here so I can talk to him.

836
01:11:50,463 --> 01:11:53,455
Sure. He come.
But not now.

837
01:11:55,702 --> 01:11:57,932
Oh, Mr. Monty-

838
01:12:00,807 --> 01:12:04,937
We're not giving up, you know.
I'll talk to Big Eagle. But now...

839
01:12:05,045 --> 01:12:08,606
let's pretend this is
just like any other night.

840
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:11,275
Kiss me good night.

841
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:22,425
Now, what do you say?

842
01:12:22,529 --> 01:12:27,159
See you first thing...
in the morning.

843
01:12:34,074 --> 01:12:36,508
I can't! I can't!

844
01:13:33,433 --> 01:13:35,526
No!

845
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:40,201
No! Wait! Please! No! No!

846
01:13:40,306 --> 01:13:42,740
dd

847
01:13:42,842 --> 01:13:47,404
Mr. Monty. Mr. Monty. I won't let them hurt you.

848
01:13:47,514 --> 01:13:51,006
- Now, Sue.
- No! Don't! Don't! Please!

849
01:13:51,117 --> 01:13:55,349
No! Let me go! Let me go!

850
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,822
Mr. Big Eagle, please.
Don't let them hurt Mr. Monty.

851
01:13:58,925 --> 01:14:02,224
- No listen to white devil child.
- You have to listen to me. Please!

852
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:05,764
Don't touch Golden Hawk!
She my friend.

853
01:14:05,865 --> 01:14:09,767
I'm your friend too, Mr. Big Eagle,
and so are the redcoats.

854
01:14:09,869 --> 01:14:14,772
- That's what I came here to tell you.
- Redcoat no friend now.

855
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:19,538
Let Iron Horse chief bring
soldier to kill all Indians.

856
01:14:19,646 --> 01:14:22,843
No, they won't.
Mr. Standing won't let them.

857
01:14:22,949 --> 01:14:26,715
And you shouldn't hurt Mr. Monty
because of what Mr. Chambers said.

858
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,448
I won't let you.

859
01:14:29,556 --> 01:14:33,856
White child lie to save redcoat.
All tribe know soldiers come.

860
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,088
The redcoats are the only ones who can
speak for the great queen mother.

861
01:14:37,197 --> 01:14:40,564
- The soldiers will not come to your lands.
- Redcoat lie!

862
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:44,194
White men beat Indians!
Sun god say kill all white men!

863
01:14:44,304 --> 01:14:47,569
No, you won't! It was all your fault anrway!

864
01:14:47,674 --> 01:14:51,735
You deserve to be whipped! If you hadn't
tried to cheat Mr. Chambers when you-

865
01:14:54,013 --> 01:14:57,813
Right time now.
You tell.

866
01:14:57,917 --> 01:15:00,647
The only reason Mr. Chambers said
he'd bring out the soldiers...

867
01:15:00,753 --> 01:15:04,917
was because Wolf Pelt tried to sell him back
the horses he had stolen from the railroad.

868
01:15:05,024 --> 01:15:07,822
Not true. No listen.
Devil child have forked tongue.

869
01:15:07,927 --> 01:15:09,918
Golden Hawk speaks straight.

870
01:15:10,029 --> 01:15:14,159
You one who lead braves who steal horses
and let others take blame.

871
01:15:14,267 --> 01:15:18,328
Little Chief lie too. Since live with
white man, he have forked tongue.

872
01:15:18,438 --> 01:15:20,429
Stop!

873
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:24,601
Why you not tell redcoat
about Wolf Pelt?

874
01:15:24,711 --> 01:15:27,908
Because Little Chief and I
made a treaty to keep it a secret...

875
01:15:28,014 --> 01:15:31,245
so I couldn't
break my word, could I?

876
01:15:32,552 --> 01:15:35,282
You make treaty
with Golden Hawk?

877
01:15:35,388 --> 01:15:38,016
Yes.
Make her blood brother too.

878
01:15:38,124 --> 01:15:40,786
No make treaty now.
Too much talk.

879
01:15:40,894 --> 01:15:44,990
- All lies.!
- Wait!

880
01:15:45,098 --> 01:15:48,465
I've told you the truth,
Mr. Big Eagle.

881
01:15:48,568 --> 01:15:51,969
Honest, I have.
On my word of honor.

882
01:15:52,071 --> 01:15:55,234
Little Chief give word too.

883
01:15:56,943 --> 01:15:59,173
They try to fool you
till redcoats get here.

884
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:02,180
No wait.
Wolf Pelt tell truth!

885
01:16:02,282 --> 01:16:05,115
Bring medicine.

886
01:16:05,218 --> 01:16:07,914
dd

887
01:16:09,555 --> 01:16:12,752
Who lying?

888
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:57,736
You one who lie.
Take him away!

889
01:16:57,837 --> 01:17:00,203
No! No lie. No.
Devil child lie!

890
01:17:00,306 --> 01:17:06,245
Set free!

891
01:17:43,449 --> 01:17:49,388
Little Golden Hawk
show white man and Indian...

892
01:17:49,489 --> 01:17:52,287
how to live
as brothers.

893
01:17:52,392 --> 01:17:55,122
She smoke too.

894
01:18:29,629 --> 01:18:32,928
Oh, here I go again.
