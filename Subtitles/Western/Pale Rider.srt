00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,534
SARAH: You got her talking more
like she's your daughter.

178
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,496
Tell her that fighting is nonsense.

179
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,706
Who's talking about fighting?

180
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,667
You, talking about this stranger!
Is he a gunman?

181
00:22:56,168 --> 00:23:00,339
I hope so. I'd chip in an ounce of dust
for a little protection.

182
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,216
From a hired killer?

183
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,092
HULL: Who said he's a hired killer?

184
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:05,802
Megan, we're going home.

185
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,888
- Sarah, please.
- Get rid of him!

186
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,765
HULL: I will.
SARAH: Today!

187
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,934
- Right after supper.
- No!

188
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,436
- Now!
- He saved my life.

190
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:23,278
I hope I'm not the cause of this excitement.

191
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,706
Do you mind?

192
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,626
Go right ahead.

193
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,672
There's nothing like a shot of whiskey...

194
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,842
...to whet a man's appetite.

195
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,726
Fine looking fricassee.

196
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,437
PREACHER: Don't want it to get cold.

197
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:58,981
I apologize.

198
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,067
I didn't realize...

199
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,944
I'll be damned.

200
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,865
Here, come right down here.

201
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:12,870
I'll get you some biscuits.
There's your stew, some butter and syrup.

202
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,372
MEGAN: You want anything else?

203
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,208
Just some company.
Aren't you joining me?

204
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,752
Of course!

205
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:22,921
How do you do?

206
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:27,176
Thank you for helping
on Hull's behalf this morning.

207
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,137
I'm Sarah Wheeler.

This is my daughter, Megan.

209
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,894
HULL: I guess we got carried away...

210
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:40,480
...but from the way you handled
those men, I never would have thought...

211
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,065
Will you say grace?

212
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,068
Certainly.

213
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,655
PREACHER: For what we are
about to receive...

214
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,741
...may we be truly thankful.

215
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:51,867

MCGILL: I apologize.

222
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,462
We'd have been here,
but we got tied up at the sawbone's.

223
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,090
What the hell happened?

224
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,635
We had a little set-in with Barret
in town, Boss.

225
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:55,931
And you got whipped?
In LaHood, California, by a tin pan?

226
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,309
There was a stranger
who gave him a hand.

227
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,478
Stranger?

228
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,021
A big guy.

229
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,066
Who're you talking about?

230
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,152
He left with Barret.
We didn't stick around.

231
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,657

232

[Dramatic instrumental music, background]

235
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:50,777
PREACHER: This man, LaHood,
he's the one you all are feuding with?

236
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:54,448
HULL: Him and his son.
Old Coy LaHood, he's a powerful man.

237
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,826
He came up here in '54 or '55,
I think it was.

238
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,704
He was the first to strike it rich.

239
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,209
He saved himself a poke, then he'd stake
new claims and mine them out...

240
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:09,963
...then buy some more. Lately,
he's been using big hydraulic monitors.

241
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:14,301
They blast a place to hell.
Excuse my French.

242
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,890
LaHood's more powerful now than ever.

243
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:23,393
Carbon Canyon's the only place
he hasn't ruined.

244
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,354
He's greedy for it, too.

245
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,981
Does he have any rights to your canyon?

246
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,734
No, our claims are filed in Sacramento.

247
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:35,239
The only way LaHood can take
this land legally is if we leave it.

248
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,826
I take it he's been kind of persuasive.

249
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:44,248
I don't care if they all leave, I'm staying.
He killed my dog and Grandpa.

250
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,420
Isn't there any law around
to take your case to?

251
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:54,132
If there was, LaHood would own them
like he owns everything.

252
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:57,594
And there's not much a lawman could do
even if we had one.

253
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,972
LaHood ain't killed anyone yet.

254

HULL: Meg's grandpa's heart gave out.

255
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:06,395
I've been taking care of Sarah
and Megan ever since.

256
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:11,900
It ain't that we're living in sin...

257
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,653
...or that I won't marry her.

258
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:18,115
But one day, a few years back,
her husband...

259
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,701
...Megan's father, lit out on her...

260
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,787
...and left her with a child.

261
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:29,543
And since then, getting her trustful
of a man hasn't been easy.

262
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,964
But when we do get hitched,
will you do it?

263
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:40,804
If you're waiting for a woman to make up
her mind, you may have a long wait.

264
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:44,933
Yeah, I guess so.

265
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:48,645
Meantime, why don't you put me to work?

266
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:51,273
No, I couldn't ask you to...

267
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,984
Maybe something spiritual.

268
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:58,071
That spirit ain't worth spit
without a little exercise. Tell me where.

269

Well, okay.

270
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:04,661
I always thought that
if I could split that rock there...

271
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:10,667

there's gold been waiting there forever.

have kind of an agreement.

or it's going to do me in.

348
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:00,405
COY: No, don't.

349
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:05,577
If we get too rough, we'll make a martyr
out of him. Don't want that.

350
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:09,456
- That's true.
- You didn't get no help from Sacramento?

351
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:12,084
COY: Sacramento ain't worth moose piss!

352
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,796
JOSH: They didn't sign the writ?

353
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,464
COY: Not only that...

354
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:23,762
...some of them bastard politicians
want to do away with hydraulic mining.

355
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,099
COY: "Raping the land," they call it.

356
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,103
We got to move on Carbon,
and move fast and dig deep.

357
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:36,775
Because the way the wind's blowing,
we may be out of business soon.

358
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,778
COY: And those tin pans have got to go!

359
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:42,156
And that preacher!

360
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,074
We'll have to find a way to deal with him.

361
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:45,534
We'll have to find a way to deal with him.

362
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,166
MEGAN: Were Grandma and Grandpa
happy when you got married?

363
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:55,836
SARAH: They didn't have a thimbleful
of choice in the matter.

364
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,297
MEGAN: Were they surprised?

365
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,800
SARAH: Grandpa took the measles,
and Grandma got drunk.

366
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,720
I suppose you could say
it surprised them some.

367
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,389
MEGAN: Because they thought
you weren't old enough?

368
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,267
Your grandma was 15
when she got married.

369
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,937
No, I think what riled them
was who I married.

370
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,650
Will you be happy married to Hull?

371
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:21,487
Who says I'm marrying Hull?

372
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,697
He's nice enough, isn't he?

373
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:26,825
Yes.

374
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,702
He's nice.

375
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:34,124
Do preachers get married?

376
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,505
I don't see why not.

377
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:44,176
How do I look?

378
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:48,514
You look lovely.

379
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,935
SARAH: You are the prettiest daughter...

380
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,895
...I could ever have.

381
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,325
[Hull squeals]

382
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,035
PREACHER: Break your hand?

383
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:13,664
It's a nugget! The biggest damn nugget
I've ever seen.

384
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:16,083
Look here. Look at that!

385
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:21,088
Isn't that beautiful?
Almost as beautiful as Sarah.

386
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,798
Sarah! Megan!

387
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:29,054
Yeah, it figures.

388
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:42,943
It came from underneath that boulder.

389
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:45,195
[Spider repeats Hull's explanation]

390
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,613
I was right.

391
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,615
HULL: I was right.

392
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:51,910
It must weigh four oz.
That's a quarter pound of gold.

393
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,453
[Sarah and Megan gasp]

394
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:54,872
Is that real?

395
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,124
Real? Just look at it.

396
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,377
[Sarah and Megan gasp and laugh]

397
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,797
Let's celebrate.

398
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,591
Can we go into town?

399
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:08,051
I don't think that's a very good idea.

400
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:10,804
That would clear your credit, wouldn't it?

401
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,931
It would, and then some.

402
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,892
Can we, please?

403
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:16,852
What do you think?

404
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,023
Why not? We've got as much right in town
as the next person.

405
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,242
Going to town again?

406
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,745
That's right. Want to come along?

407
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:39,166
No, our daddy wouldn't let us go to town.

408
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,169
EDDIE: Sure is a nice day for it, though.

409
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:48,800
[Horse carriage rattles]

410
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:20,624
HULL: I'll be back.
I'll go square things with Mr. Blankenship.

411
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:24,127
HULL: Take care of the ladies.
PREACHER: That won't be hard.

412
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,588
HULL: We'll get a soda after I'm done.

413
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,476
MEGAN: Look.

414
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:48,360
MEGAN: I'll go get Hull.
PREACHER: That's all right.

415
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:49,987
He'll be fine.

416
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:02,124
My papa wants to see you, Preacher.

417
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:03,625
He does, does he?

418
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:07,129
All right.

419
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:11,258
SARAH: Don't go. I know it's a trick.

420
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:12,843
I'll be all right.

421
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:23,187
MEGAN: What if they hurt him?
SARAH: Shut up.

422
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:25,731
I'm sorry.

423
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,401
It's all right.

424
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:41,997
COY: Preacher, my name is Coy LaHood.

425
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:44,333
PREACHER: I know.

426
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:49,796
COY: Do you imbibe, Reverend?

427
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:52,799
PREACHER: Only after 9:00 in the morning.

428
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:54,426
[Coy chuckles]

429
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:57,679
COY: When I heard
a parson had come to town...

430
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:01,934
...I had an image of a pale, scrawny,
Bible-thumping Easterner...

431
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:05,938
...with a linen handkerchief and bad lungs.

432
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,606
PREACHER: That's me.

433
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:10,818
Hardly.

434
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:13,111
Your health.

435
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:18,700
COY: It occurred to me it must
be difficult for a man of faith...

436
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:22,079
...to carry the message
on an empty stomach, so to speak.

437
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:23,372
I thought...

438
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:27,543
...why not invite this devout
and humble man to preach in town?

439
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:31,922
COY: Why not let the town be his parish?
In fact...

440
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:35,300
...why not build him a brand-new church?

441
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,890
I can see where a preacher'd be
mighty tempted by an offer like that.

442
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:43,517
Oh, indeed.

443
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:49,356
Then he'd be thinking about getting himself
a batch of new clothes.

444
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,441
We'd have them tailor-made.

445
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:55,571
Then he'd start thinking
about those Sunday collections.

446
00:44:55,779 --> 00:45:00,117
Hell, in a town as rich as LaHood,
that preacher'd be a wealthy man.

447
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:02,744
That's why it wouldn't work.

448
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:07,291
Can't serve God and Mammon both.
Mammon being money.

449
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,085
[Coy sighs]

450
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:22,639
COY: I opened this country.

451
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:24,474
I made this town what it is.

452
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:26,768
I brought jobs and industry.

453
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:29,855
I built an empire with my own two hands.

454
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:33,233
And I've never asked help of anyone.

455
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:38,447
COY: Those squatters, Reverend,
are standing in the way of progress.

456
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,074
Theirs or yours?

457
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:46,288
Here, look. Just look at that writ!

458
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:51,502
Comes hot from Sacramento, giving me
mineral rights to the whole canyon.

459
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:56,965
That hardly seems likely. If you had
those rights, you'd have exercised them.

460
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:01,887
No, those people have legal claims.
You can't mine there till they leave.

461
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,181
Damn it! You read that writ!

462
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:08,185
If it was worth the paper it's on,
you wouldn't be trying to bribe me.

463
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,779
What's your business
with those tin pans, Reverend?

464
00:46:19,613 --> 00:46:21,657
Nothing. They're just friends.

465
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:27,287
You and your friends got 24 hours
to pack up and leave...

466
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:31,792
... or my men will ride through that canyon
and run you out!

467
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:35,212
I've been a law-abiding man,
but now I'm out of patience.

468
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:38,423
And any blood that gets spilled
will be on your hands.

469
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,719
[Slow, dramatic instrumental music,
background]

470
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:56,567
You're a troublemaker, stranger.

471
00:46:57,776 --> 00:47:01,905
You spell bad cess in letters
that stretch from here to Seattle.

472
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:09,371
Thanks for the drink.

473
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,666
[Slow, dramatic instrumental music
continues]

474
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:19,298
Now, I've reasoned and I've bargained
with you and I've come up short.

475
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:23,802
But what's mine is mine,
and if you make me fight for it, I will.

476
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:27,014
COY: There is a man, a marshal.

477
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:32,019
He keeps the peace, if you take
my meaning. His name is Stockburn.

478
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:35,063
And he won't be as patient as me.

479
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:42,446
These people in Carbon Canyon,
would you pay cash for their claims?

480
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:45,574
Buy them out?

481
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:50,746
I'd do anything to prevent bloodshed.
How about $100 a head?

482
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,207
How about $1,000?

483
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:56,126
[Coy laughs, others join in]

484
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,593
I'll tell you what: I'll go up to $125.

485
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:09,848
Stockburn and his deputies
will cost you a lot more than that.

486
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:14,269
How would you know?

487
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:17,564
How much is it worth
to have a clear conscience?

488
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:22,736
[Coy sighs]

489
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:24,780
$1,000 per claim then.

490
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:28,116
But I want them out of here in 24 hours!

491
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:36,375
I paid him off in full. I even have enough
to pay off Sparters.

492
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:39,169
[Sarah breathing heavily]

493
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:40,712
Where is he?

494
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:42,756
In there.

495
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:48,220
Well, do something, Hull!

496
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:16,290
What were you doing in there?

497
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:17,332
LaHood was buying me a drink.

498
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:18,333
LaHood was buying me a drink.

499
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:20,419
Thanks for the thought.

500
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,881
MINER LEADER: So we all vote in favor?
MINERS: Yeah!

501
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:26,550
MINER LEADER: Speak up!
All those in favor?

502
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:29,344
MINER LEADER: Are any opposed?
MINERS: Nay.

503
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:36,768
SPIDER: Me and LaHood's seen a lot
of ground together, starting back in '55.

504
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,605
He may be greedy, but he ain't no fool.

505
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:44,568
If he offers $1,000 a claim,
it's because it's worth five times that.

506
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:47,988
GRIZZLED MINER: The way LaHood works,
maybe. The way we work...

507
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:50,491
... we're lucky to see $1,000 a year.

508
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,494
I say we take his offer.

509
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:59,500
Suppose you struck a thousand bucks
in nuggets.

510
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,878
Would you quit and blow town?
Or keep digging?

511
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:12,513
SPIDER: What do you say, Preacher?

512
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:16,934
PREACHER: What I say doesn't matter.
It's your sweat he's buying.

513
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:21,063
Why don't you sleep on it,
make the decision in the morning?

514
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,026
What if we don't decide in the morning?
What happens if we can't decide?

515
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:29,363
