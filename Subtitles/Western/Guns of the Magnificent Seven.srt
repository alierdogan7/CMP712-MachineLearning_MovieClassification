Lobero wants from the revolution

01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,054
Where's your hero?

1098
01:41:43,138 --> 01:41:44,222
Lobero?

1099
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:46,390
He was sick.

1100
01:41:47,559 --> 01:41:49,644
A bullet in, uh,

1101
01:41:50,979 --> 01:41:51,979
his belly.

1102
01:41:54,733 --> 01:41:56,859
(MAN SPEAKING SPANISH)

1103
01:42:42,197 --> 01:42:43,531
Emil, uh,

1104
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:46,242
I made this for you.

1105
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:49,662
Uh, it's really just
a frog stick, Emiliano.

1106
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,915
But if a man used
a real one the right way,

1107
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:56,335
he might be able to
help his people one day.

1108
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:00,590
Levi?
What?

1109
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:29,285
Chris.

1110
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:32,330
Chris, we're going to
scatter in the hills

1111
01:43:32,414 --> 01:43:34,290
and we're going to
fight them again.

1112
01:43:35,417 --> 01:43:38,336
We will stalk them
in the night like jaguars.

1113
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:43,257
We will... We will sweep down
from the mountains like hawks.

1114
01:43:43,634 --> 01:43:46,302
We're going to tear out
their throats like wolves.

1115
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:50,514
In the deserts, Chris, in the
valleys, all of us, Chris...

1116
01:43:57,147 --> 01:43:58,522
Goodbye, Chris.

GABRIEL: Max,
you must stop him.

1119
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,261
Quickly! The money,
all the money, he forgot!

1120
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:29,345
Chris!

1121
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,305
Chris!
Max!

1122
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,517
He did not forget.

1123
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:41,190
Max, what did Chris say?

1124
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:51,742
He said,
"The cowards die many deaths,

1125
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:54,954
"the brave only one. "
