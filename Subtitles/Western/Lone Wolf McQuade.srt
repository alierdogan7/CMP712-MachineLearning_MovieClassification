<i>Apúrense, muchachos.</i>

6
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,833
This is Deputy Sheriff Oscar Garcia.

7
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,077
You are all under arrest
for horse stealing. Drop your guns.

<i>¡Échale con tu chingada madre, cabrón!</i>

You gonna steal these horses
back from me? Huh? Policeman?

11
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,398
These are my horses!

12
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,479
Garcia, Ramos, policemen...

13

<i>¡Órale!</i>

14
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,517
You'll never get away with this. You can't
kill a policeman. They'll hunt you down.

15
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,870
<i>¡Hijo de perra!</i>

16
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,958
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

17

I'm gonna teach him a lesson.

18
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,434
Some of these guys
are a lot taller than me.

19
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,834
A whole head taller.

20
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,948
<i>¡Pues de la chingada!
¿ Qué está pasando?</i>

21
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,870
<i>Hey, you, cabrón! You're hurting my cars,
pendejo! Why you do that?</i>

22
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,231
This is JJ McQuade, Texas Ranger.

23
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,279
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,550
Put 'em down.

25
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,509
<i>- Do not move.
- "Do not move." (cackles)</i>

26

Hey, you. Stand up like a man
so I can see you.

27

<i>¡Puta!</i>

28

Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

<i>There! You think I care

30
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,158
Put down your weapon

31
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,317
I say I'll shoot this man, motherfucker!

32
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,917
<i>Better listen to me, cabrón!</i>

33
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,838
Right now! Come down!

34
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,953
<i>Ranger! I'm gonna kill this man!
Drop your weapon! ¿ Qué quieres?</i>

35
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,868
Ain't no one ever killed no Texas Ranger
and lived to tell it.

36
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,269
<i>He ain't that big. Muchachos, come down.
Show our honoured guest some respect.</i>

<i>¡Echa, hijo puta!</i>

39
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,437
I've never seen
a Texas Ranger up close before.

40
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,152
You know,

41
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,353
once a Texas Ranger
kicked my father's teeth out.

42
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,233
Would you do that to me, Texas Ranger?

43
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,395
Don't shoot me.

44
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,916
Don't shoot me! You already kicked
my teeth out! What else do you want?

45
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,077
Like father, like son.

46
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,997
Come on.

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,073
I just wanna say thank you.
Thank you. You were great.

50
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,671
OK, OK, kid. OK.
Go cut your buddies loose. Go on.

<i>Adios, amigos. Hasta la vista.</i>

69
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,990
- Good speech, Dakota.
- The hell with it. Did you get 'em?

70
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,078
- You bet.
- Sorry I was at this hand-job session.

71
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,873
- I'd love to have helped.
- I could have used you.

72
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,798
- Dakota?
- Yeah, Captain?

73
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,230
Can't say as I'm gonna miss you.

74
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,716
Thank you very much, Captain.
And thank you for the watch.

75
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,718
- And you, McQuade...
- Drink, Captain?

76
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,593

<i>"And you, McQuade..." (laughs)</i>

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,556
Hey, McQuade.

Hi, there.

80
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,913
- Captain?
- Sit down, McQuade.

81
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,949
You think you're pretty damn good,
don't you, McQuade?

82
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,154
In case you didn't know it there's more to
being a Texas Ranger than making busts.

83
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,397
<i>- You gotta look good doing it.
- (toilet flushes)</i>

84
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,476
Style.

85
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,593
The best always have style.

86
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,396
- I said, sit down.
- I'll stand, Captain.

87
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,349
Now, in terms of
unassisted felony arrests,

88
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,392
I admit your record is unrivalled.

89
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,709
But my kind of Ranger is a model citizen.
A pillar in the community. Goes to church.

90
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,436
He lives clean
and he's got a lovin' wife and kids.

91
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,915
Read it.

92
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,393
It's an editorial by the senator who
happens to approve our annual budget.

93
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,035
I quote: "Ranger JJ McQuade
is a walking symbol

94
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,188
of the brutal, uncooperative, obsolete and
discriminatory nature of Rangers today."

95
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,799
Unquote.

96
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,277
Well, your "lone wolf" attitude
is gonna change.

97
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,396
You're going to start cooperating with the
state and federal agencies. Understand?

- You wanted to see me, Captain?
- Yes.

101
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,109
Ranger, meet your new partner.
Deputy Arcadio Ramos.

102
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,596
Arcadio. You can just call me Kayo.

103
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,119

Where'd you get that piece?

107
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,278
- That's what I'm gonna find out.
- Ranger?

108
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,958
Stay with it, son.

109
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,119
Our Russian friends have failed us. We
will have to finance the coup ourselves.

Would you like to count it, Señor Wilkes?

114
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,790
Trust is the most important thing
in our business.

115
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,070
Of course it is.

116
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,193
Now, have the plane loaded at once.

117
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,756
I am in a hurry
to get back to Havana, Señor Wilkes.

118
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,472
Quickly, now.

119

That quick enough?

131
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,440
Kid, get out of here.
And forget that partner crap.

00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,469
- Nice to meet you, Bobby.
- Nice to meet you, Ranger.

173
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,310
Bobby, Daddy's takin' me riding. I hope
you don't mind. I'll see you tonight, OK?

174
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,351
Uh, yeah, sure.

175
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,313
- See you later.
- Have a good old time.

176
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,680
Bye. See you later.

177
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,596
Bye, Mom! See ya!

178
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,835
<i>(Sally) I'm ready to take Foxy out now.</i>

179
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,997
<i>- (Dakota) Just be patient.
- OK.</i>

180
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,872
All right. I'm ready to go.

181
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,151
Pay attention, dummy.
She's got some mustang in her.

182
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,431
- I can handle her, OK? Let's go.
- OK.

183
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,358
- Be careful, honey.
- OK. Easy, Foxy.

184
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,916
Hey. How'd you like to bite that in the butt,
develop lockjaw and be dragged to death?

185
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,838
- Who is she?
- Clark Richardson's widow.

186
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,632
- That's her, huh?
- That's her.

187
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,399
From a poor family.
Married Clark with all that money

188
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,640
just before he got himself squashed
in that Italian racing job. Quite a crash.

189
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,548
Clark ran with a pretty tough crowd
and talk is it wasn't an accident.

190
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,671
But nobody can prove it.

191
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,191
Shame, though.
All that fruit just rotting on the vine.

192
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,278
Doesn't look too rotten to me.

193
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,630
- Sally!
- Foxy!

194
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,599
- Sally!
- Help me!

195
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,395
Help!

196
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,553
It's all right. It's OK.

197
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,633
- You all right, honey?
- Yeah.

198
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,191
Thank you.

199
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,914
- What's your name?
- Sally.

200
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,191
- Next time, Sally, be more careful.
- I will.

201
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,713
I wanna thank you for what you did.
The name's Jim McQuade.

202
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,150
The infamous Texas Ranger.
Pleased to meet you.

203
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,111
<i>(car horn)</i>

204
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,438
This is Rawley Wilkes, my late husband's
partner. Ranger McQuade.

205
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,438
And now you're my partner.

206
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,313
I understand you're very good
with your hands and feet.

207
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,556
Pretty good.

208
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,353
Rawley was all-European
karate champion.

209
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,869
Is that right?

210
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,755
Ranger Brown. Sally.

211
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,838
Ranger McQuade, it was especially nice.

212
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,995
Oh, by the way, Rawley's giving a little
martial arts display by the racetrack.

213
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,636
- Just a little exhibition.
- Why don't you gentlemen drop on by?

214
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,072
- I don't think we...
- Oh, it'd be our pleasure, ma'am.

215
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,475
Good.

216
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,396
Hey, Foxy.

217
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,629
- Wait. What are you doin'?
- I wanna ride.

218
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,276
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure. Excuse me, please.

219
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,550
Gallop. Let's go.

220
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,238
Never backs down, does she? Reminds
you of somebody else in her family.

221
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,790
# But choosin's never easy and
I can't decide which one I'd rather see

222
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,990
# There's a woman from El Paso and I
know she will be comin' here this evening

223
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,310
# She'll be wearing a red dress and
I know the one with whom she'll be leavin'

224
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,878
# There's another girl from Dallas...

225
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,190
- You got Pearl beer?
- No. Heineken, Michelob or Dos Equis.

226
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,276
Forget it.

227
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,471
- Bottom shelf, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

228
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,077
<i>(woman) It's Rawley showing off.</i>

229
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,030
This should be very interesting.

230
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:50,230
I see we are graced with the presence
of a media favourite, Ranger JJ McQuade.

231
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,596
Care to go for one, Ranger?
A little wager, perhaps?

232
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,116
No, thanks. I don't fight for money.

233
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,195
I don't want you dancin' with no greaser.

234
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,754
You are a greaser, aren't you?

235
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,956
Excuse me a minute.

236
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,712
- Quit while you're ahead, partner.
- Who the hell asked you?

237
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,831
Let me show you.

238
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,916
Come on, tough guy.

239
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,559
Boys are just havin' a little fun.

240
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,353
Do you wanna join the fun?

241
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,713
This is not my idea of fun!

242
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,193
Please let me apologise. Some of my
friends could learn a little manners.

243
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,278
Maybe you need some new friends.

244
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,751
Music! Play!

245
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,636
<i>(cackles)</i>

246
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,598
<i>This was my party.</i>

247
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,555
We should have booked those bastards.

248
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:28,277
If I locked up every guy who took a swing
at me, half the county'd be behind bars.

249
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,632
Well, you're makin' a real habit
of saving my ass. I appreciate it.

250
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,833
- You take a good punch, kid.
- I'll take old hamburger-face home.

251
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,599
- Good idea.
- Come on, boy.

252
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,317
You look like you could use
a change of scenery. Come on.

253
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,276
I'll drive.

254
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,673
<i>Cuidado, mis cuates, la chota.</i>

255
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,950
Not too popular, are you?

256
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,355
They understand me.

257
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,199
<i>Por favor.</i>

258
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,677
<i>Una botella de mezcal, dos limones
y si me puede limpiar la mesa. Gracias.</i>

259
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,268
- Mezcal?
- Yes.

260
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,834
How about a kiss, baby?

261
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,996
Excuse me.

262
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,595
Time to leave.

263
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,238
Watch out!

264
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,593
- Sally, get back here.
- Nope.

265
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,795
Hey, come on. Open up.
Let me in. Come on, Sally.

266
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,514
- Nope.
- Come on, open the door. Let me in.

267
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,837
- You promise you won't try anything?
- I promise. Let me in.

268
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,269
OK.

269
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,833
- Aaargh!
- Bobby!

270
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,918
- You promised. Cut it out.
- I lied.

271
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,918
<i>(trucks starting up)</i>

272
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,999
- What is it?
- It's coming from down on the highway.

273
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,997
Stay here.

274
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,076
Bobby?

275
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,957
<i>(gunfire)</i>

276
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,150
Holy shit.

277
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,636
Let's get out of here.

278
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,476
Get down.

279
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,151
What do you guys want?

280
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,592
No!

281
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,280
Bobby! No!

282
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,115
<i>(screaming and sobbing)</i>

283
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,475
See you around.

284
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,391
<i>(woman on radio) Come in, 6R1.
Can you read me?</i>

285
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,835
<i>- 6R1 here. Over.
- Roger, 6R1.</i>

286
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,238
<i>We've got a multiple fatality and injury
on I-10 south of Estelline.</i>

287
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,396
I'm going home. Is there anyone closer?

288
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,672
<i>Negative. You'd better go. We've been
notified that your daughter's involved.</i>

289
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,756
<i>- My daughter?
- (siren)</i>

290
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,235
- Sally McQuade.
- Room 418.

291
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,396
Ranger! Wait!

292
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,830
Please. She needs rest.

293
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,269
She was very lucky.

294
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,919
Bobby...

295
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,476
<i>Bueno.</i>

296
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,836
<i>(siren)</i>

297
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,239
Howdy, Ranger.

298
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,079
The feds. They've taken over.

299
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,668
Marcus Jackson, FBI, Houston.

300
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,394
- McQuade, Texas Ranger.
- I know.

301
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,592
I'm sorry about your daughter,
but this is a federal case.

302
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,915
From now on, it's out of your jurisdiction.

303
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,793
There's brass everywhere. 9mm.

304
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,989
Excuse me. Get it to the lab. I want a
ballistics report. Let's see what we got.

305
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,839
I guess this is his show.

306
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,590
There were pages blowin'
all over the place when I got here.

307
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,473
I kept this one.

308
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,319
It's a logbook page from an army convoy.

309
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,396
Fort Nelson.

310
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,315
Ranger?

311
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,190
<i>- Hello. Lieutenant Dade, Shipping.
- McQuade, Texas Ranger, El Paso.</i>

312
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,838
I'm calling to verify that shipment
number... 5501 left Fort Nelson yesterday.

313
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,518
<i>Yes, sir, it certainly did.</i>

314
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,394
<i>- What were the contents of those trucks?
- Sir, I'm not at liberty to say.</i>

315
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,511
<i>- Who is?
- Colonel McNeil, sir.</i>

316
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,756
<i>- Would you connect me, please?
- Yes, sir.</i>

317
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,677
<i>(knock at door)</i>

318
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,917
<i>- Colonel McNeil's office.
- Could I speak to the colonel?</i>

319
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,873
<i>- He isn't in today.
- When do you expect him?</i>

320
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,150
<i>- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Where is he?</i>

321
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,874
- I don't know.
- Lady, what the hell do you know?

322
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,992
<i>I only work for the colonel.
I don't sleep with him.</i>

323
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,998
You won't get anywhere that way, Ranger.

324
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,159
Follow me.

325
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,150
- What the hell are you doing?
- Accessing into Aristotle.

326
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,272
- Who?
- The military central computer.

327
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,552
You see, I borrowed the codes
from the Texas Criminal Info Center.

328
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,555
- Shit.
- If you get it figured out, kid, let me know.

329
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,719
Wait, Ranger, I'm in. I got it.

330
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,475
I got it.

331
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,193
They got a shitload of guns. Oh, man.

332
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,309
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.

333
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,913
- Good job, kid. Really a good job.
- Thanks, Ranger.

334
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,958
<i>(McQuade) Here's our little Judas goat.</i>

335
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,228
- What's his connection?
- His name's Snow.

336
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,669
Hustler, dealer, pimp, you name it.

337
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,349
There isn't any dirt
he doesn't have his hands in.

338
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,793
What do you say
we pay him a visit, Ranger?

339
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,753
Let's go.

340
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,518
- You gonna park?
- Hang on.

341
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,119
What?

342
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,634
You're learning, kid.

343
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,195
I see I got a lot more to learn.

344
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,039
Come on, kid.

345
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,116
Son of a bitch.

346
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,876
Whoops.

347
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,033
<i>¿ Señora?</i>

348
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,596
<i>¿ Dondé fue el hombre que pasó ahorita?</i>

349
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,916
<i>Gracias.</i>

350
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,752
- Remember me, Snow?
- J-Jesus!

351
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,950
Watch it!

352
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,108
Round the front.

353
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,232
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

354
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,995
Goddammit! Shit!

355
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,992
Don't!

356
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,918
- No! No!
- Come on!

357
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,395
<i>(Snow moans and whimpers)</i>

358
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,833
Come on.

359
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,077
- Take him.
- I'll call the fire department.

360
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,637
Later. I need to talk to him
before I let the feds have him.

361
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,474
You're gettin' more slippery all the time,
ain't you?

362
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,639
Come on. How many times
have I busted you, you son of a bitch?

363
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,159
- Argh! It hurts my hand!
- Yeah, it does, don't it?

364
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,918
<i>(Snow) You son of a bitch!</i>

365
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,156
Can I borrow that contraption?

366
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,719
Sure.

367
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,633
What are you gonna do?

368
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,632
Stop! Wait!

369
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,270
<i>(Dakota) Got something to say, pissant?</i>

370
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,154
I know who you want.
It's the Mexican Mafia man, Falcon.

371
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,793
Emilio Falcon?

372
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,957
They're heistin' guns everywhere.
All they can get.

373
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,516
What are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

374
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,236
I said, what are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

375
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,877
Shit! They fly 'em off to Mexico,
to Central America, to terrorists and stuff!

376
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,309
All over the place.

377
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,317
I don't know.

378
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,672
They're gonna kill my son, man!
Goddammit!

379
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,434
Please? Please?

380
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,313
Please, man. Let me go, goddammit.

381
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,197
You stay right there, boy.
Don't you even breathe fast.

382
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,470
Thanks. I figured you'd bring him around.

383
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,194
It has been my pleasure, JJ.

384
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,635
Hang onto him till I get back.

385
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,150
I'm gonna clean up
and pay a little visit to Señor Falcon.

386
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,034
- What about me, Ranger?
- Hold down the fort... partner.

387
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,116
<i>Bueno.</i>

388
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,279
Let's go have
another little talk with our guest.

389
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,315
<i>(Snow) What you gonna do? What you
gonna do, man? I'm not scared of you.</i>

390
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,196
<i>(singing)</i>

391
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,631
What the hell?

392
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,716
Damn!

393
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,234
<i>(singing and sound of vacuum cleaner)</i>

394
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,675
<i>(she sings loudly)</i>

395
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,469
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, hi.

396
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,388
- I just thought I'd clean up a bit.
- Lady, if I want a maid, I'll hire one.

397
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,913
Jim, you're a hopeless slob.
Let me have my cord.

398
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,951
What's this?

399
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,036
Vitamins.

400
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,430
Where's my beer?

401
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,115
In the garbage.

402
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,631
Can't you see you're killing yourself?

403
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,596
Lady...

404
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,157
if I want to kill myself,
it's my own business.

405
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,277
Fine. That's just fine.

406
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,356
<i>Adios.</i>

407
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,192
<i>(door slams)</i>

408
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,952
Shit.

409
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,518
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

410
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,116
Look, uh...

411
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,358
I, uh... I didn't mean to be such a...

412
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,355
What I mean is...

413
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,035
Lola, I...

414
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,356
I'm sorry.

415
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,756
You know, you could use some
improvement. You really could.

416
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,716
Yeah, I know.

417
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,636
<i>(she sobs)</i>

418
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,315
Hey! I'm not the trash.

419
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,759
OK, you're asking for it.

420
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,437
OK. Here.

421
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,116
- Sorry. This is by invitation only.
- This is my invitation.

422
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,992
Hey.

423
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,150
So, the lone wolf pays us a visit.

424
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,430
As you can see, mine's bigger.

425
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,994
Mine's loaded.

426
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,155
<i>(laughs)</i>

427
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,796
- Tell me, Ranger, do you like games?
- I'm not here to discuss games, Falcon.

428
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,831
<i>- (buzzer)
- Damn!</i>

429
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,916
- Then what brings you?
- Guns.

430
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,511
Guns? You know, at one time
I had a great interest in guns.

431
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,315
- Somebody tells me you still do.
- And you would like to believe him.

432
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,238
Two nights ago,
several men died in a convoy heist.

433
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,590
Yes. Of course I'm aware of these things.

434
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,350
However the certain party who is stealing
the guns was once a close friend of mine.

435
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,597
He might take it personally
if I were to divulge details.

436
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,792
He is a businessman, just like I am, and...

437
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,552
Why am I telling you this? You will find
these things out for yourself in good time.

438
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,310
- Meanwhile I'll enjoy watching the game.
- It may be a game to you, Falcon.

439
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,719
But if I find out you're playing,
I'm gonna have your little ass.

440
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:29,790
Well, Ranger, it's been a pleasure having
a chat with you. But I'm afraid I must go.

441
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,237
<i>(Falcon) Oh, and Ranger?
The man you caught - Snow.</i>

442
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,990
<i>I understand he won't live
through the night. Adios now. (cackles)</i>

443
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,559
<i>- You can't get through?
- I'm sorry, 6R1. I can't help you.</i>

444
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,752
<i>That line's been reported out of order.</i>

445
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,518
Mm-hm.

446
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,916
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Snow calls it. There's his 30 cents.

447
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,998
I call it. There's my 30 cents.
What have you got, baby?

448
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,636
- Best hand all day.
- Look at that. Pair of kings.

449
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,150
Look at that, folks.
Three eights. Isn't that delicious?

450
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,116
You didn't win here. I'm gonna take a little
bit of your money. How much this time?

451
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,119
- A quarter.
- One quarter, you wish to try. 25 cents.

452
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,549
Sit still, boy!

453
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,232
Now, you are going to love this game.
You're gonna get a marvellous hand.

454
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:30,559
Unfortunately it is going to be slightly
inferior to mine, but you're going to like it.

455
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,958
What do you got, boy? What do I hear
from you? What do I hear from you?

456
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,753
- I need another beer.
- Oh, you need another beer.

457
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,589
- No cards up the sleeve, huh?
- No need to, with a patsy like you.

458
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:47,158
You learn when you play this game
that you really play people, not...

459
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,750
You don't play cards, you play people.

460
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,269
Loose lips sink ships.

461
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,550
You understand?

462
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,353
I thought you would.

463
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,677
I just play the cards good and tight.

464
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,394
Oh, fuck!

465
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,476
<i>(siren)</i>

466
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,357
<i>(cracking)</i>

467
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,599
<i>(Snow screams) No! Don't kill me!</i>

468
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,474
<i>(Kayo) Dakota! You all right?</i>

469
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,672
Dakota! Answer me!

470
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,708
Kayo.

471
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,472
Kayo?

472
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,956
It's OK, kid.

473
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,117
Captain.

474
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,152
Ranger, I think you know Agent Jackson.

475
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,152
This is Colonel Remsing
and ATF Special Agent Burnside.

476
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,513
- Feds.
- You better read this.

477
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,629
- Federal indictment?
- With your name on it.

478
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,469
You're dealing with
international gun smugglers. Butchers.

479
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,718
They provide every damn terrorist
organisation in the world with our guns.

480
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,513
I can't stand by you on this one, Ranger.

481
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,430
You withheld evidence, harboured
a key witness in a federal investigation,

482
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:40,429
caused a good man's death and violated
every jurisdictional clause in the book.

483
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,790
I've no choice but to put you on probation.

484
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,436
You'll take a mandatory vacation without
pay until this matter can be cleared up.

485
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,596
You want my star, Captain?

486
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,792
That won't be necessary. Not yet.

487
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,080
Hey, Wolf. How's my boy?

488
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,312
Jim...

489
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,276
What's wrong?

490
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,233
Nothing worth talking about.

491
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,471
Hey.

492
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,909
Hey.

493
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,190
Are you OK?

494
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,875
Yeah, I'm OK.

495
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,716
<i>(wolf growls)</i>

496
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,275
Lola!

497
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,759
- You think they got the message?
- Just like you planned.

498
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,712
Damn.

499
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,596
<i>(he yells)</i>

500
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,512
Jim?

501
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,674
Come on. Let's go home.

502
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,672
I'll see you soon, honey.

503
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,759
- Daddy, aren't you coming in?
- No, I'd better get going.

504
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,835
I don't wanna leave you.

505
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,798
You're becoming quite a lady, you know.

506
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,234
I'm gonna miss you, honey.

507
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,636
- I love you, Daddy.
- Oh, I love you too.

508
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,673
Pretty jittery for a Ranger.

509
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,508
- Pretty quiet for a fed.
- Oh, I make it my business.

510
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,428
Looks like somebody
doesn't like you, McQuade.

511
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,519
- I make a few enemies here and there.
- Yeah? So do I.

512
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,839
- What do you want?
- I came to enlist your help.

513
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,033
See, I'm not the token nigger
when it comes to following the rules.

514
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,070
Get to the point.

515
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,318
<i>(Jackson) I know they got a drop-off point
somewhere between here and Big Bend.</i>

516
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,877
- That's 500 square miles.
- Who knows? We might just get lucky.

517
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,710
Pretty desolate terrain, McQuade.

518
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,873
<i>(McQuade) There are no roads up here.</i>

519
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,198
- This could take weeks.
- Yeah, it's gettin' late.

520
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,153
We'd better turn back.

521
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,596
See somethin'?

522
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,751
Take us down over there.

523
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,435
There's been some activity here. Pretty
well-organised for the middle of nowhere.

524
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,711
There's nothing
indicated here on the map.

525
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,272
What's goin' on?

526
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,951
I've got a bad feeling about this place.

527
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:45,598
<i>(Kayo) Well, Ranger, how does it feel
to be baby-sitting Burnside?</i>

528
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,188
<i>(McQuade) Candy-ass feds.</i>

529
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,230
McQuade! What is this?
A damn goat trail?

530
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,672
- If you wanna turn back, that's fine by me.
- Who the hell does he think he is?

531
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,920
He knows this country better than you
know the warts on your wife's backside.

532
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,157
Why don't we all line up and kiss his ass?

533
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,039
- I'll be damned.
- You need some help?

534
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:55,591
Let's show 'em what this baby can do.

535
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,197
What the hell does he think he's doin'?

536
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,311
What the hell?

537
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,395
Hang on.

538
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,469
- What's he got there? A damn tank?
- Why don't you just shut the hell up?

539
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,760
Let's go.

540
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,394
A real pretty setup, huh?

541
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,120
It's been too easy.

542
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,596
Let's check around
before we make a move.

543
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,918
Burnside, hold it.

544
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,712
- This is the FBI.
- Burnside!

545
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,559
Drop your weapons
or we'll commence firing.

546
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,557
Get down!

547
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,279
- Run for it. I'll cover you.
- I'm staying here.

548
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,473
Get your ass out of here!
That's an order, Trooper!

549
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,995
You son of a bitch!

550
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,396
<i>Now this is my idea of fun.</i>

551
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,071
Rawley, that's enough!

552
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:58,069
Look, darling. I have a surprise for you.
One of your new friends.

553
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,269
Rawley, please! Rawley!

554
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,960
I waited a long time for this.

555
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,356
Please don't do it this way, Rawley!

556
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:12,429
Very well, my dear.
Get his truck. I have a better idea.

557
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,990
Get her out of here.

558
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,395
You murderer! You murderer!
Let go of me!

559
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,119
Pick him up.

560
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,635
Put him in it.

561
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,549
Something to remember you by.

562
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,272
<i>Adios.</i>

563
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,115
Freeze, assholes!

564
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,153
Ranger!

565
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,475
You son of a bitch!

566
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,356
Ranger!

567
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,358
Ranger?

568
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,917
Don't die on me now, dammit.
Dammit, don't die on me now!

569
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,115
Get me a beer, kid.

570
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,596
Yes, sir!

571
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,313
Aren't we a sorry bunch of bastards?

572
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,313
Whose idea was this, anyway?

573
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,312
<i>(groans)</i>

574
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:11,119
- Oh, Jim, thank God you're here.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

575
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:15,358
It's Sally. She's missing.
I called all of her friends.

576
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,758
OK, calm down, calm down, calm down.
Are you sure you checked everywhere?

577
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,518
Oh, Jim.

578
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,193
I'll take care of this.

579
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,874
Is it "Ranger" or "Mr" McQuade?
May I come in, please?

580
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,276
- Say what you came to say.
- I came to offer my assistance.

581
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,509
A business acquaintance of mine, Rawley
Wilkes, has disappointed me greatly.

582
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:49,111
I'm not interested in your problems.
I'll get him my own way, in my own time.

583
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:52,755
- Wilkes has your daughter, McQuade.
- Oh, Jim! Jim!

584
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,111
It's his way of saying
he would enjoy your company again.

585
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,231
I want my daughter back, Falcon.

586
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,836
Please, please. I'm more than willing
to help you retrieve your loved one,

587
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,679
providing, of course,
that you return the favour.

588
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,075
What's your deal?

589
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,193
I will tell you precisely where
you can find Mr Wilkes and your daughter.

590
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:20,189
However, in return I would like
certain assets of mine protected.

591
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,232
I wish to claim what is mine.

592
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,677
Jim...

593
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,075
Anything. Please.

594
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,551
- Hey, partner. Where you headed?
- Mexico.

595
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,672
- Mexico? What the hell for?
- They got my daughter.

596
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,156
- Hold on. I'm comin'.
- It's not your fight.

597
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,235
Hey, Ranger!
You're in no shape to do this alone!

598
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,429
<i>Dinero, por favor. Dinero, por favor.</i>

599
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,111
<i>Gracias. Muchas gracias.</i>

600
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,515
<i>- ¿ Se lo lleno, señor?
- Sí.</i>

601
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,952

<i>Señor?</i>

604
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,153
They are wishing you well.

605
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:49,031
You didn't think
I'd miss all the fun, did you?

606
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,190
- A new toy, huh?
- Just a little surprise.

607
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,878
<i>(car approaches)</i>

608
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,195
You gotta be kidding.

609
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,037
Hey. You guys remember me?

610
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,072
How we gonna
smuggle him back to Texas?

611
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,553
That's your problem.

612
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,358
Can you make it?

613
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,553
I didn't come this far
just to drop dead on the trail, did I?

614
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,638
It's all downhill from here on.

615
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,430
OK!

616
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,110
We split up from here. Stick to the plan.

617
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,435
- Right.
- Good luck.

618
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:43,516
Hello, Sally. How you doing?

619
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,919
What does he want from me?
Why is he keeping me here?

620
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:49,995
Rawley...

621
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,955

Where do you think you're going, dude?

625
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,518
- Let's go. It's gonna get rough round here.
- McQuade.

626
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,235
Get that crap off.

627
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,229

Yeah. I never forget an asshole.

Rawley killed my husband

Don't move, don't talk,

Can we print the comment that you made
about your daring rescue?

And the FBI credits
the Texas Rangers with the rescue?

673

- Absolutely correct.
- Can I have another picture?

Why not?
Ranger, you feel up to a picture?

Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna say it's
a pleasure having this man on my team.

I feel responsible for every move he's
made. After all, I taught him all he knows.

I can't wait to show you our new house.
Come on, let's go.

681
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,153
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Molly.

682
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:40,590
Gimme a hug. I really
appreciate your helping us move.

683
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:44,156
- My pleasure.
- Come on, let's go.

684
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,753
Oh, boy. Here we go.

01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:02,119
Ranger, we got a 10-31 in progress
at the Texas National Bank.

687
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:05,312
- I'm on vacation.
- They've got hostages.

688
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,750
- We really need you, Ranger.
- Comin', Jim?

689
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,356
Daddy?

690
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,515
Hostages?

691
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:24,432
Daddy?

692
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,516
Are you comin'?

693
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,590
See you later. Let's go.

694
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:35,393
JJ McQuade, you'll never change!

695
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,275
Oh, hell.
