00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:17,017

00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:32,532


3
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:47,547


4
00:00:47,547 --> 00:01:02,562


5
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:17,577


6
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:32,592


7
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:47,107


8
00:01:47,607 --> 00:02:02,122

00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:17,137


10
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:32,152


11
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,155
JOHN!

12
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,657
LOOK... LOOK UP HERE!
OH.

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,662


14
00:02:42,662 --> 00:03:04,184


15
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,687
I'D LIKE TO SEE MRS. DEVLIN.
WOULD THAT BE
MISS SANDRA?

16
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,689
SHE'S MRS. DEVLIN NOW.

17
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,192
I'M...
(Mr. Poli)
MR. DEVLIN?

18
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
YES... MR. POLI?

19
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,196
YES.

20
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,199
SO YOU ARE THE MAN WHO
MARRIED MY DAUGHTER.

21
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,700
WELL, WE, UH...

22
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,702
SORTA GOT THE
IDEA IN A HURRY.

23
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,204

24
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:31,711

25
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,213
ORNERY CUSS,
THAT POLI.

26
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,714
HE DON'T FIDDLE
WITH NOBODY.

27
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,716
HE USED TO RUN A
STAGECOACH LINE,

28
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
FOR HE WENT IN FOR
RAILROADIN'.
HUH?

29
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:50,230
????
??

30
00:03:50,230 --> 00:04:01,741


31
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,742
WAIT!

32
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,744
PAPA IS JUST AS
CRAZY AS YOU ARE.

33
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,746
HE'LL GETHISGUN,
AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

34
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,748
PAPA'S KIND OF HIGH
STRUNG, ISN'T HE?

35
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
PAPA SAYS YOU ARE
A GUN-TOTIN',

36
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,752
HIGHBINDIN',
TINHORN GAMBLER.

37
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,755
WELL, PAPA SHOULDN'T
TALK LIKE THAT IN FRONT
OF THE CHILDREN.

38
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,257
BUT YOU ARE.

39
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,263
SANDRA!
HOW'D YOU GET OUT WHEN
I LOCKED THE DOOR!?

40
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,764
GET HIM, MEN!

41
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,765
HEYA!

42
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
YOU'D BETTER COME BACK,
OR FROM BETWEEN THE EARS

43
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,273
I'LL SHOOT YOU!

44
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,778
WAIT... MY BAGS!

45
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,281
WE HADN'T BETTER MAKE
ANY STOPS NOW, SANDY.

46
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,282
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

47
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
IF I CAN'T LOOK PRETTY,
YOU CAN'T EITHER.

48
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,286
WE'RE CLEANED OUT
FOR SURE NOW.

49
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,788
WHO SAID SO?
LUNCH?

50
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,790
NO...

51
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,792
TWENTY THOUSAND
DOLLARS.

52
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,793
THAT CINCHES IT...

53
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
SANDY, I LOVE YA.
WHO WOULDN'T?

54
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
YOU COULDN'T WIN THAT
MUCH IN A POKER GAME.

55
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,799
YOU MEAN, UNLESS
I WAS DEALING.

56
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
(bang bang)

57
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,303
THAT'S PAPA...
HE'S SHOOTING AT US!

58
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,305
(bang)

59
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,309
(bang)
HURRY UP!
AH, THAT'S NOTHING.

60
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,312
(bang)

61
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,315
ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS DO YOU TAKE AFTER
PAPA OR MAMA?

62
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
PAPA ALWAYS WANTS TO
SHOOT THINGS OUT.

63
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
HE HAS NO MORE SENSE
THAN YOU HAVE.

64
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,820
(bang bang)
I DO HOPE HE DOESN'T
KILL US.

65
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,822
HE'D NEVER GET OVER IT.

66
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,325
WELL, I'D FEEL KIND
OF REGRETFUL ABOUT
IT MYSELF.

67
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,826
(bang)

68
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,827
HE'S GOT HIMSELF
ANOTHER GUN!

69
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,331
(bang)

70
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,332
CAN'T YOU GO
QUICKER?!

71
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,833
(bang)

72
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,337
DO YOU SUPPOSE IT
COULD BE, SANDY,

73
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,839
THAT WE WEREN'T
MEANT FOR EACH
OTHER AFTER ALL?

74
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,341
I DON'T LIKE
TO BUTT IN,

75
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,842
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE
I OUGHTA ASK IF YOU
WOULDN'T PREFER

76
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,843
ANOTHER CARRIAGE?

77
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:52,352


78
00:05:52,852 --> 00:06:00,860


79
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,362
(bang)

80
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,363
HEYA!

81
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,366
SIT TIGHT, SANDY!
WE'RE HEADIN'
FOR CALIFORNIA!

82
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,869
WELL, DO WE HAVE TO
GO TO CALIFORNIA?

83
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,871
KNOW A BETTER PLACE?!

84
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,873
HOW ABOUT DAKOTA?

85
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,875
DID YOU SAY DAKOTA?

86
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,377
YES, DAKOTA.

87
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
OH, I THOUGHT YOU
SAID DAKOTA.

88
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
WE'LL MAKE IT
CALIFORNIA.

89
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
HEYA!

90
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,884
TURN LEFT AT THE
NEXT CROSSING.

91
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,396
OH!

92
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,398
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

93
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,899
YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,901
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YES, SIR.

95
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,404
YOU'RE FIRED!
GET YOUR HORSES!

96
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,405
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

97
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
HE'S ONLY ANGRY NOW.

98
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,411
WAIT TILL HE FINDS OUT
I SOLD THE GAINSBOROUGH
FROM HIS LIBRARY.

99
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,427
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH DAKOTA?

100
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,929
IT HAS LOTS OF PEOPLE
IN IT, HUNDREDS,

101
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
AND IT'S A GREAT
WHEAT COUNTRY.

102
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,433
WHAT DOES A MAN DO
IN A WHEAT COUNTRY,

103
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,934
OPEN A BAKERY?

104
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,436
THERE ARE LOTS OF
THINGS WE COULD DO.

105
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,937
ONCE WE'VE ESTABLISHED
OURSELVES...

106
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,939
LET'S TALK IT OVER
IN CALIFORNIA.
BUT SOME DAY,

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
WHEN DAKOTA IS ADMITTED
INTO THE UNION,

108
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
YOU COULD GO
INTO POLITICS.

109
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,447
OH, OUR MONEY!
SPEAKING OF
POLITICS,

110
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,449
WHERE WE'RE GOING THERE
ARE ONLY TWO PARTIES--

111
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,951
THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.
(train conductor)
ALL ABOOOAARD!

112
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,953
THAT'S OUR TRAIN.
HOW MUCH DO
WE OWE YA?

113
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,955
OH, FORGET ABOUT
IT, MY FRIEND.

114
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

115
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,460
MAYBE YOU HADN'T
BETTER DRAW UP ANY
PLANS UNTIL...

116
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,462
UNTIL WHAT?

117
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
I WAS GONNA SAY UNTIL
YOUR MONEY RUNS OUT.

118
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
(train conductor)
ALL ABOOOAAARD!

119
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,985
DID YOU SAY THIS
IS OUR TRAIN?
YES.

120
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
THAT LADY IS SANDRA
POLI, BIGTREE.

121
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,994
HER FATHER OWNS
THIS RAILROAD.
THAT SO?

122
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,997
WELL, GUESS MAYBE
SHE'S SOMEBODY WE
OUGHTA KNOW, HUH?

123
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,998
MM-HMM.

124
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
HURRY UP... DON'T LET
THEM GET AWAY!!

125
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,031
QUICK, SEND A TELEGRAPH
TO BELLS CROSSING!

126
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,032
YES, MR. POLI.

127
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,035
TO JAKE BONZO
ON TRAIN 67...

128
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,538
SAY, "HOLD MY DAUGHTER!

129
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,040
"TAKE FROM HER THE
BIG TINHORN

130
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,543
AND KNOCK OUT
HIS TEETH!"

131
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,545
NO, WAIT...
IT'S TOO MUCH.

132
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,548
JUST HIS FRONT TEETH,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

133
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,050
AND UH, WAIT...
NO... NO... NO.

134
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,553
MAYBE IT WOULD
BREAK HER HEART.

135
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,055
MAYBE SHE WOULD BE
MAD... IT'S NO GOOD.
NO... NO.

136
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:20,059
UH... SAY, "DON'T KNOCK
OUT HIS FRONT TEETH."

137
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,062
SAY... OH, WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

138
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,065
ARE YOU CRAZY...
HOW CAN YOU SEND
SUCH A TELEGRAPH?!

139
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,569
HUH?
SHE'S MY OWN
LITTLE GIRL.

140
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,071
MAYBE SHE LOVES HIM,

141
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,574
THAT BIG NO-GOOD.

142
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,075
AND YOU WILL BREAK
HER HEART, HUH?!

143
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,577
ME?

144
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,078
SEND ANOTHER ONE.

145
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,581
"TO MY DAUGHTER,
MRS... UH...

146
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,082
MRS... UH...

147
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
NOW WHAT'S HIS NAME?

148
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,587
DEVLIN... NO...
YES, DEVLIN!

149
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
"HAVE A GOOD TIME,

150
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,593
"AND REMEMBER YOUR PAPA

151
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,095
IF YOU NEED MONEY
OR SOMETHING."

152
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,598
OH, SHE'S A SWEET GIRL...

153
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,600
OH, SOMETHING ELSE!

154
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,604
"IF MAYBE YOU GET TIRED
OF YOUR WONDERFUL, BIG,
LOVELY MAN,

155
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,606
"DON'T WORRY, WE'LL
PUT HIM IN JAIL,

156
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,108
"THAT NO-GOOD RAT!

157
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,111
I MYSELF WILL
TAKE HIM AND..."

158
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
HE'S BIGGER THAN I,
THAT'S THE TROUBLE.

159
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,121
BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN
CALIFORNIA BUT FLOWERS,

160
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,624
AND EVERYONE KNOWS
FLOWERS GIVE YOU
HAY FEVER.

161
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,626
I GOT IT MYSELF,
RIGHT NOW.

162
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,128
LOOK, SANDY,
WITH $20,000,

163
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,130
WE CAN OPEN A LITTLE PLACE
IN THE GOLD FIELDS...

164
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,133
A SALOON AND GAMBLING
PALACE WITH DANCE HALL
GIRLS...

165
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,136
WOULDN'T YOU
JUST LOVE THAT?
(conductor) TICKETS, PLEASE.

166
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
I BROUGHT THE TICKETS,
LIKE YOU TOLD ME.

167
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,140
(train whistle blowing)

168
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,642
WHEN DO WE GET TO ST.
LOUIS, CONDUCTOR?

169
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,645
ST. LOUIS!?
CAN'T DO IT AND STAY
ON THE TRACKS.

170
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,148
WE'RE HEADED
FOR ST. PAUL.

171
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,650
WHY... WHY, YOU
SEE, JOHN,

172
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,151
I HAD TO DO IT.

173
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,152
I COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING ELSE.

174
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,153
YOU COULDN'T, EH?

175
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,155
I JUST COULDN'T...
I COULDN'T.

176
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,157
I LOVE YOU AND IT WAS
FOR YOU, SO I DID IT.

177
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,660
BUT WHY ST. PAUL?

178
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,662
BECAUSE FROM ST. PAUL,
WE'LL GO TO DAKOTA.

179
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
WAIT.

180
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,669
LAST NIGHT PAPA HAD SOME
OF HIS BUSINESS FRIENDS
TO DINNER,

181
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,671
AND I HEARD THEM SAY
THEY'RE GOING TO EXTEND

182
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
THE RAILROAD
INTO DAKOTA.

183
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,175
IN A FEW WEEKS, PAPA
WILL SEND AGENTS

184
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,678
TO FARGO TO BUY UP
ALL THE LAND

185
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,179
AND THE RIGHT
OF WAY,

186
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,181
SO WHAT WE'LL DO...

187
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,683
IS BEAT HIM TO IT,

188
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,184
OPTION EVERYTHING
IN SIGHT,

189
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
MAKE HIM PAY THROUGH
THE NOSE.

190
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,189
BUT THE CATCH IS
TO MAKE THE PROFIT,
WE HAVE TO GO TO FARGO.

191
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,191
BUT IT'S A
WONDERFUL PLACE!
SURE.

192
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
THERE'S PROBABLY
NOTHING THERE BUT
A TRADING POST.

193
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,698
WE'LL BE STUCK UP THERE
WITH NOTHING TO DO BUT...

194
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,199
MAKE LOVE.

195
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,202
HMM, WHAT'S
WRONG WITH THAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

196
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:54,714
????
??

197
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,715
STOP IT!

198
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:05,224
????
??

199
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
BELLS CROSSING!

200
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:18,237
????
??

201
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,739
GET RID OF THEM.

202
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,240
THANKS FOR
PITCHIN' IN.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

203
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742
LOOKED LIKE YOU COULD
USE SOME HELP.

204
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,744
HE'S A GOOD MAN.
BIGTREE?

205
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,245
(conductor)
TELEGRAM FOR MR. BONZO!

206
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,247
HE'LL DO... MY NAME IS
BENDER, JIM BENDER.

207
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,249
I'M DEVLIN...
THIS IS MRS. DEVLIN.

208
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,251
HOW DO YOU DO,
MRS. DEVLIN?
MRS. DEVLIN?

209
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,253
YES...
THANK YOU.

210
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,755
MAY I?
SURELY.

211
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,268
IT'S FROM PAPA...
EVERYTHING IS ALL
RIGHT.

212
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,770
HE SAYS IF WE NEED MORE
MONEY OR ANYTHING,

213
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,773
WE JUST LET HIM KNOW.
ISN'T HE WONDERFUL?

214
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,275
NICE GUY TO DO BUSINESS
WITH, BY LETTER.

215
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,278
GOING TO ST. PAUL,
MR. BENDER?
I'M GOING TO FARGO.

216
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,780
SO ARE WE.
REALLY... THAT'S FINE.

217
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,281
WE'LL PROBABLY BE SEEING
A LOT OF EACH OTHER.

218
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:13,793
????
??

219
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,794
HEYA!

220
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:28,307
????
??

221
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,811
WE'VE PASSED THE FORT.
SHOULD BE IN ABERCROMBIE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

222
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,814
AND YOU LOOK JUST AS
FRESH AS WHEN WE
STARTED, MRS. DEVLIN.

223
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,317
THANK YOU...
WE BOUGHT SOME
THINGS IN ST. PAUL.

224
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,319
OH, AREN'T THEY
SOLDIERS?

225
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,322
HUH?
PROBABLY AN ESCORT
FROM THE FORT.

226
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,325
MUST BE SOME HOSTILE
INDIANS AROUND.

227
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,328
INDIANS... OH!

228
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,832
JOHN, NOW THAT WE KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

229
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,834
DO YOU REALLY THINK WE
SHOULD GO TO FARGO?

230
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,836
WELL, WE'VE COME
THIS FAR.

231
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,838
MAYBE WE OUGHTA STOP
OFF AND, UH,

232
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,340
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

233
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO DO
IN FARGO, MR. DEVLIN?

234
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,344
WE ARE GOING TO INVEST
SOME MONEY IN LAND.

235
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,346
FARMLAND...
WE THOUGHT WE'D

236
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,348
PICK UP A FEW ACRES
AND GROW SOME WHEAT.

237
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,351
YOU WOULDN'T WANT US TO
BELIEVE YOU WAS A FARMER,
WOULD YA, MR. DEVLIN?

238
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,854
MAYBE I OUGHTA
SPROUT A BEARD, EH?

239
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,856
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY
YOU'D WANT TO BUCK
A PROPOSITION

240
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,358
AS UNCERTAIN AS YOU
MAY FIND IN THE
WHEAT COUNTRY.

241
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,861
WHA... WHAT'S
UNCERTAIN ABOUT IT?

242
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,362
YOU DON'T THINK
NOBODY'S GONNA LET
YOU WALK INTO FARGO

243
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,865
AND JUMP ANY CLAIMS,
DO YA, MA'AM?

244
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,867
BIGTREE MEANS, YOU MIGHT
HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE

245
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,870
GETTING HOLD OF A DECENT
PIECE OF LAND--

246
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,371
GOOD ACREAGE IS SCARCE.

247
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
TRYIN' TO TELL US THAT

248
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,376
THEY DON'T TAKE KINDLY
TO STRANGERS IN FARGO,
MR. BENDER?

249
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,378
I DON'T IMAGINE THEY'D
WELCOME STRANGERS

250
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,882
WHO COME TO FARM, UH,
WITHOUT IMPLEMENTS,
MR. DEVLIN.

251
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,405
WHOA!

252
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,907
EVERYBODY OUT...
WE DONE IT AGAIN!

253
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,408
FORT ABERCROMBIE,
FOLK.

254
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,410
MR. BENDER?

255
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,411
I'M BENDER.

256
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,913
COMPLIMENTS OF
COLONEL WORDEN, SIR.

257
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,415
HE'D LIKE YOU TO RIDE
OVER TO THE FORT WHEN
YOU'RE RESTED.

258
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,417
WELL, I WAS GONNA SAIL
ON THESIOUX PRINCESS.

259
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419
HAVE YOU GOT ANY
IDEA WHAT HE WANTS
TO SEE ME ABOUT?

260
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
THERE'S BEEN SOME
KILLINGS AT FARGO.

261
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,424
THEY'VE BURNED THE
HOMES OF MOST OF THE
BONANZA FARMERS.

262
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
- INDIANS?
- WELL, ACCORDING
  TO MR. STOWE,

263
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,928
IT WAS MADE TO LOOK LIKE THE
SIOUX WERE MIXED UP IN IT,

264
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,930
BUT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IT.

265
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
STOWE WASN'T BURNED
OUT, WAS HE?
YES, SIR.

266
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,434
IT SEEMS ONLY THE LITTLE
FELLAS ARE LEFT NOW, THE
HOMESTEADERS.

267
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,436
MR. STOWE'S AT
THE FORT NOW.

268
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,438
HE AND COLONEL WORDEN
HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR
YOU TO GET BACK.

269
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
FOR ME?

270
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,441
I THINK MR. STOWE HAS
SOME IDEA OF ORGANIZING

271
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,444
A LAW ENFORCEMENT
AGENCY AT FARGO.

272
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,448
OH... WELL, YOU TELL
'EM I'LL WASH UP
AND BE OVER AFTER SUPPER.

273
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,450
WELL, THESIOUX PRINCESS
SAILS AT SIX, SIR.

274
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,952
WELL, I'LL ARRANGE
TO MISS THAT

275
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,454
AND GO WITH CAPTAIN
BOUNCE ON THE
RIVER BIRD.

276
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,455
MY COMPLIMENTS TO
COLONEL WORDEN.

277
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,466
THERE YA ARE, DEVLIN,
THAT'S FARGO FOR YA.

278
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,970
WHAT'S FARGO?
DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT
THE LIEUTENANT SAID?

279
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,972
MENTIONED A COLONEL
SOMEBODY OR OTHER,

280
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,474
FORT... SOMETHIN'
GOIN' ON?

281
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,477
NO, NOTHIN' MUCH,
NOTHING VERY
INTERESTING.

282
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,980
BIGTREE, GET OUR
BAGS OUT OF THESIOUX
PRINCESS,WILL YA?

283
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,482
I'LL SEE YOU AND

THE BOAT, HUH?

284
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,985
YEAH, SURE.

THAT, UH, FARGO BOAT,
SIOUX PRINCESS?

286
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,489

THAT'S ONE OF 'EM.

287
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,991
T'OTHER'S THE
RIVER BIRD,

288
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
THAT'S OL' CAP'N
BOUNCE'S TUB.

289
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,995
SHE'S A HUFFER
AND A PUFFER.

290
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,496
BUT IF I WAS A
MAKIN' THE TRIP,

291
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,499
SHE'S THE ONE
I'D TAKE.
BETTER BOAT?

292
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,001
NOPE, BUT IF YA SAIL
ON THERIVER BIRD,

293
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003
YOU'D HAVE IT PRACTICALLY
TO YOURSELF,

00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,005
AND IF THE MOON HAPPENS TO
BE RIDIN' ALONG WITH YA,

THANK YOU, COLONEL.

374
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,749
I WISH YOU COULD'VE TALKED
TO BENDER IN MY PRESENCE.

375
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,252
WELL, WE'LL TRY TO
ARRANGE A LITTLE
PARLEY LATER.

376
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,254
I'M TERRIBLY SHORTHANDED AND

00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,757

YOU BETTER GET ABOARD
AND CLAIM YOUR STATEROOM.

381
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,266
IT'S NUMBER ONE...
THE ONE WITH THE
DOOR ON IT!

382
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,273
MR. STOWE,
I'M GLAD TA SEE YA.

00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,276
HERE WE GO.
CALM YOURSELF, SANDY.

384
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,777
NOTHING'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO US.

385
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,779
WE WON'T TURN UP THE
WELL-KNOWN TOES

386
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,781
UNTIL OL' MAN TIME
CATCHES UP WITH US.

387
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
(bang)

388
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,287
(bang)

389
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,288
(bang)

390
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,790
(bang)

391
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,797
IT DIDN'T TAKE OLD
MAN TIME LONG TO
CATCH UP WITH US.

392
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,301
OOH, YOU'RE HURT!
A LITTLE.

393
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,820
PLEASE...

394
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,822
TELL MRS. STOWE...

395
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,827
NOT TO SELL TO BENDER.

396
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,839
JOHN, DO YOU THINK
THERE'LL BE ANY MORE
TROUBLE?

397
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,841
NO.
WHY WOULDN'T
MR. STOWE

398
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,843
WANT HIS WIFE TO
SELL TO BENDER?

399
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,347
THAT'S THE QUESTION.
THIS IS THE BOILER ROOM.

400
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,848
MR. BENDER SAILED ON
THESIOUX PRINCESS,

401
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,850
SO HE COULDN'T HAVE
DONE ANY SHOOTING.

402
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,352
THIS MUST BE IT...
IT'S THE ONLY ONE
WITH A DOOR ON IT.

403
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,357
(Bigtree)
LOOKIN' FOR
ME, FOLKS?

404
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,862
I THINK THIS IS OUR
STATEROOM, COLLINS.

405
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,865
ONLY, UH, WHAT
COUNTS AROUND
THESE PARTS IS...

406
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,367
WHO GETS THERE FIRST.

407
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,868
LET'S TAKE THE
OTHER ROOM, JOHN.

408
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,870
I THINK COLLINS WANTS
US TO HAVE THIS ROOM.

409
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,376
WELL, I GUESS A MAN
TRAVELING WITH HIS WIFE

410
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,878
SHOULD HAVE A ROOM
WITH A DOOR ON IT.

411
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,380
DIDN'T HURT YOUR GUN
HAND, DID YA, DEVLIN?

412
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,884
I CAN STILL...
WRITE WITH IT.

413
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,386
A MAN'S GOT TA
WATCH HISSELF.

414
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,388
AN ACCIDENT LIKE THAT
COULD PUT HIM OUT OF
BUSINESS, HUH?

415
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,391
SEE YA.

416
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:28,907
????
??

417
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,909
LOOK OUT NOW, YOU SWEET
LITTLE HUNK A MISERY.

418
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,412
LOOK OUT... SHE'S RIGHT
UP AHEAD THERE.

419
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,913
PORT TA HELM, NICODEMUS!

420
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,914
COMIN', CAP'N.

421
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,419
NOW HERE SHE COMES...
LOOK OUT NOW.
LOOK... DROP.

422
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,423
DROP, YOU SNEAKIN' COUSIN
OF A SNEAKIN' CATFISH!

423
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,924
POP YOUR INNARDS!

424
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,427
BUST IS COMING!!

425
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,429
GET OVER THERE!!

426
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,931
THERE, SEE HOW EASY IT IS
WHEN YOU WANNA DO IT?

427
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,935
GOT HER OVER THAT ONE,
DIDN'T YA, CAP'N?
OH, SHE'S SCARED.

428
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,938
SHE'S BEEN HANGIN'
HERSELF UP ON THEM RIVER
WARTS FOR FIVE YEARS,

429
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,942
AND SHE KNOWS IF SHE
JUST SETS HERSELF DOWN
JUST ONE MORE,

430
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,944
I'LL BLOW HER HIGHER
THAN THE COST OF LIVIN'
IN FARGO!

431
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,451
- JOHN?
- YES?

432
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,954
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
IN ABERCROMBIE
WAS NOT A FAULT OF YOURS.

433
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,956
IT WAS MR. STOWE
THEY WERE AFTER.

434
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,458
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE
BEEN KILLED

435
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,460
SIMPLY BECAUSE
YOU DREW A GUN,

436
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,962
WHICH YOU COULDN'T HAVE
DRAWN IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
CARRYING IT.

437
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,964
WHEN I SEE A GUN POINTED
IN MY DIRECTION,

438
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,967
SO FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
I'M PART AND PARCEL TO
THAT DEAL,

439
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,469
AND I'M GONNA ACT
ACCORDINGLY.

440
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,970
(boat whistle)

441
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,473
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

442
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,474
MUST BE TAKIN'
ON PASSENGERS.

443
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:42,481
JOHN?
IF I DID SOMETHING THAT
WOULD MAKE YOU ANGRY,

444
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,982
WHAT WOULD YOU
DO TO ME?

445
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,484
WHAT A FELLA SHOULD
DO TO A LITTLE GIRL

446
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,486
THAT'S DONE SOMETHING
SHE SHOULDN'T A DONE.

447
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,489
YOU WOULDN'T?
I'D BE EMBARRASSED
TO DEATH.

448
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,491
WELL, WHAT BROUGHT
THIS ON?

449
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,993
WELL, AS I WAS SAYING,

450
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,495
IF YOU HADN'T REACHED
FOR YOUR GUN,

451
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,997
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
SHOT AT YOU.

452
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,999
DON'T SCARE ME
LIKE THAT.

453
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,501
(Captain Bounce)
WHAT YOU FELLAS WANT?!

454
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,003
WE'D LIKE TO COME
ABOARD, CAP'N.

455
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,506
INJUNS SNUCK UP ON
US LAST NIGHT AND
STOLE OUR HORSES.

456
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,008
WE STARTED TO LEG IT BUT
GOT OFF THE TRAIL.

457
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,510
GIVE ME A HAND, WILL
YA, BIG FELLA?

458
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,514
YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS?

459
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,516
I AIN'T GONNA TAKE MUCH
OF YOUR TIME, MISTER.

460
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,017
HEY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON DOWN THERE!

461
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,519
GET YOUR HEAD BACK
IN THERE, POP.

462
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,020
(bang)
(ding ding)

463
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,524
WHICH POCKET'S
THAT MONEY IN?

464
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,025
WHO TOLD YOU I
HAD ANY MONEY?

465
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,027
AN INJUN CAME TO ME IN
A DREAM LAST NIGHT

466
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,529
AND SAYS AS HOW
YOU WAS LOADED.

467
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,530
GET BACK THERE,
FLATFOOT!

468
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,034
- AND YOU, MISTER, STAY
  RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.
- YEAH, SURE.

469
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,541
OH, AIN'T I THE
LUCKY ONE?
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

470
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,042
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE!
GET BACK, LADY.

471
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,545
YELLOWTAIL!

472
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,546
GET BACK!

473
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,556
(bang)

474
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,058
(bang)

475
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,563
(bang)

476
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,063
(click click)

477
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,074
WOULDN'T LEND ME YOUR
GUN FOR A COUPLA MINUTES,
WOULD YA, COLLINS?

478
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,577
WOULD YA LEND ME YOURS,
DEVLIN, IF IT WAS LOADED?

479
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,579
NO.

480
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,582
BUT THOSE MEN, THEY'RE GETTING
AWAY WITH OUR MONEY!

481
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,085
TOO BAD, MA'AM.
BUT MY MOMMA TOLD ME,
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE SHAVER,

482
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,588
IF I NEVER BUTTED INTO
TO NOBODY'S BUSINESS,

483
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,590
I'D NEVER GET HURT.

484
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,593
GOOD ADVICE FOR ANYBODY, MA'AM.

485
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,604
WELL, I CAN'T DO MUCH
FIGHTIN' WITH
AN EMPTY GUN.

486
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,110
THEN IT ONLY COST US 20,000
GREENIES TO FIND THAT OUT.

487
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,112
WELL...

488
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,616
HOW WAS I TO KNOW ANYTHING LIKE
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?

489
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,118
I'LL NEVER TOUCH YOUR
OL' GUN AGAIN!

490
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,120
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET
YOUR SILLY HEAD SHOT OFF,

491
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,623
I'M NOT GOING TO CARE...

492
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,124
MUCH.

493
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,127
FUNNY PART OF IT IS
IF YOU HADN'T
EMPTIED MY GUN,

494
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,129
I MIGHTA TAKEN A FEW
SLUGS IN THE BACK.

495
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,633
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY,
SANDY, IF I WERE TO
TELL YA

496
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,135
THAT YOU LOOK AS GOOD
TO ME WITHOUT MONEY

497
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,138
AS YOU DID WITH IT?
OH, JOHN.

498
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,139
(Bang!)

499
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,643
TAKE THAT, DAG BLAST YA!

500
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,145
COME BACK HERE AND I'LL BLOW IT
THROUGH YOUR THIEVIN' BONES!!

501
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,652

WELL, I'M SORRY,

THEY CAME AND RAIDED
AND BURNED THE PLACE

594
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,953
THE NIGHT HE LEFT.

595
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,956
OH, BUT YOU MUST BE VERY
TIRED AND HUNGRY.

00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,973

00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,674
WHEN A LADY WANTS TO
DANCE, WE GOTTA FIX
IT SO SHE CAN, RIGHT?

667
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,177
YEAH, SURE.

668
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,679
I WANT YA TA HAVE YOUR FUN
WHILE YA CAN, MRS. DEVLIN.

669
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,682
YOU NEVER CAN TELL
HOW YA FEEL ABOUT THINGS
COME TOMORRA.

670
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,184
HERE YA ARE, DEVLIN.

671
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,686
ANY TIME WE'RE NOT
HERE, AND YOU WANT
TO SEE ME OR BENDER,

672
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,688
LOOK BACK IN
THE OFFICE.

673
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,690
TAKE WHICHEVER
ROOM YA WANT,

674
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,692
BUT LEAVE US ONE
WITH A BED IN IT.

675
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:46,704
????
??

676
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,706
DARLING, WHY DO YOU
TAKE SUCH CHANCES?

677
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,210
AFTER ALL, NO ONE
HERE'S ON OUR SIDE.

678
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,213
I LEARNED ONE THING FROM
GENERAL MORGAN, SANDY...

679
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,715
THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE
SURROUNDED AND
HAVEN'T A CHANCE...

680
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,718
ATTACK.

681
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,719
HELLO.

682
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,223
MET YOUR BROTHER
THIS MORNING.

683
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,724
YEAH... HOW'S HE DOING?

684
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,228
NOT BAD, BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE THERE'S SOME SAD
DAYS AHEAD.

685
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,236
JOHN?
YES?

686
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,237
DO YOU THINK I LOOK
GOOD IN BLACK?

687
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,741
THERE AIN'T NO GOL'
DARNED HORSE THIEVES

688
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,243
HOLDIN' UP NO
SHIP O' MINE.

689
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,247
SO I GRABS MY CARBINE,
I GETS THE PAIR OF 'EM
IN MY SIGHTS AND WHAM!

690
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,250
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THIS, BUT, EH...

691
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,751
MISSED 'EM, CLEAN
AS A WHISTLE.

692
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,754
THIS OUR KEY, CAP'N?
IT DON'T MAKE NO
DIFFERENCE,

693
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,256
IT FITS ALL
THE DOORS.

694
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,758
I JUST STOPPED BY TO
TALK TO THE LADIES A
MINUTE.

695
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,760
THEY REMIND ME OF MY
DEAR OLD AUNT MINNIE.

696
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,263
OH, THIS IS MR. AND
MRS. DEVLIN, LADIES.

697
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,765
THEY WORK HERE...
THEY'RE DOIN' A SONG
AND DANCE ACT.

698
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,768
OF COURSE, THEY'RE
OFF FOR TONIGHT
ON ACCOUNT OF THE BIG DOIN'S.

699
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,772
- I'M JERSEY THOMAS.
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT
  JERSEY WAS A STATE.

700
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,275
COULD BE, ON
OCCASION.

701
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,277
THAT'S NEW JERSEY YOU'RE
THINKING OF, DEAR.

702
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,783
THEY CERTAINLY MANAGE
TO ATTRACT ALL THE
UGLIEST TYPES HERE,

703
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,285
HAVEN'T THEY?

704
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,287
JUST ONE BIG HAPPY
MELTING POT, EH?

705
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,289
BUT DON'T MELT TOO
EASILY, WILL YOU, DEAR?

706
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,793
AND YOU THINKING ALL
THE TIME THAT JERSEY
WAS A STATE.

707
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,798
WHY YOU!

708
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,300
YOU OPEN THIS DOOR,
YOU BIG LADY KILLER!

709
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:34,812
????
??

710
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,315
WELL, GLAD I MET'CHA,
GOOD-BYE.

711
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,318
HE MUST BE ONE OF
THOSE ONE-WOMAN MEN
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

712
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,320
OH, I GUESS HE JUST
GONE DOWN TO GIT
HISSELF A DRINK.

713
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,835
SUPPOSE WE LEAVE IT
UNLOCKED, DEVLIN?

714
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,837
SOME OF THE BOYS MIGHT
WANT TO DROP IN.

715
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,839
HOW ARE YA?

716
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,842
FOR THE MOMENT,
SHORT ABOUT $20,000.

717
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,345
IS THAT SO...
HOW'D YA LOSE IT?

718
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,846
TURNING BACKFLIPS.

719
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,351
THAT COULDN'T BE
IT, COULD IT?

720
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,853
YOU PROVE IT'S YOURS,
AND YOU CAN HAVE IT.

721
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,855
WHEN I WALK OUT OF HERE,
IF IT'S IN MY POCKET,

722
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,857
WILL THAT PROVE
ANYTHING?

723
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,860
YOU WOULDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF A MAN WITH A BAD LEG,
WOULD YOU, DEVLIN?

724
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,362
WELL, YOU WOULDN'T
HIDE BEHIND IT

725
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,864
WITH MY $20,000,
WOULD YOU, BENDER?

726
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,367
YOU TALK LIKE YOU MIGHT
TRY TO TAKE THAT MONEY
AWAY FROM ME,

727
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,869
AND I DON'T THINK
I LIKE THAT.

728
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,373
YOU'RE NOT IN FARGO TO
STAY, ARE YOU, MR. DEVLIN?

729
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,876
OH...
BAD CHARACTER, EH?

730
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,877
OUGHTA MOVE ON.

731
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,380
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
TO SEEM BLUNT,

732
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,383
BUT WE'VE GOT A PRETTY NICE
LITTLE COMMUNITY HERE,

733
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,885
AND WE DON'T EXACTLY
COTTON TO SHARP WITS
WHO COME HERE

734
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,887
WITH THE IDEA OF TRIMMING
THE FOLKS HEREABOUTS.

735
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,389
(crash)

736
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,405
FRIEND OF YOURS
OR MINE?

737
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,407
BETTER HAND OVER
THE MONEY, BENDER.

738
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,409
I GOT THE PLACE SURROUNDED.

739
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,413
THAT'S FUNNY, SO HAVE I.
THINGS OUGHT TO START
TO BREAK SHORTLY, HUH?

740
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,415
RIGHT NOW...
LET'S HAVE IT.

741
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,918
GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT,
IF YOU LIKE THAT
KIND OF A GAMBLE.

742
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,421
THERE'S AN EASIER WAY TO
GET IT, THOUGH, DEVLIN.

743
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,423
LEAVE ON THE
FIRST BOAT?

744
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,425
THERE'S NOTHING PERSONAL
ABOUT IT AT ALL.

745
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,428
THIS COUNTRY'S MY COUNTRY, AND
THE PEOPLE IN IT ARE MY PEOPLE,

746
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,430
AND I'M GONNA LOOK AFTER
THEIR INTERESTS.

747
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,433
BUT IT'S NOT TO THEIR INTEREST
TO LET YOU RUN AROUND
WITH YOUR HANDS FULL OF MONEY,

748
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,436
BUYING UP OPTIONS ON THEIR LAND,
VERY CHEAPLY, FOR THE RAILROAD.

749
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,439
YOU GOT ALL THE FACTS RIGHT
ON FILE, HAVEN'T YOU?

750
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,441
YOU'RE MARRIED TO POLI'S
DAUGHTER... FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED,

751
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,443
THAT CONNECTS YOU
WITH THE RAILROAD.

752
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,946
AND THAT PROVIDES ME WITH
A NEAT LITTLE LIFE INSURANCE
POLICY TOO.

753
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,949
- DOES IT?
- IF YOU GOT ME, SHE'D
  SCREAM FOR HELP,

754
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,452
AND PAPA POLI'D BE UP
HERE WITH THE UNITED
STATES ARMY

755
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,455
BEFORE YOU COULD
SADDLE A HORSE,

756
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,957
WHICH LEAVES YOU HOLDIN'
THE SMALL CARDS, BENDER.

757
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:00,958
SO I'LL TAKE
THE MONEY.

758
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,461
LOOK OUT!
(bang)

759
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,471
SWEET LITTLE BABY.

760
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,474
NOW DON'T YOU GET TO FLIRTIN'
WITH THEM SAND BARS,

761
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,976
AND PAPA'LL BUY YA A
NICE NEW TON A COAL

762
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,479
WHEN WE GIT TO GRAND FORKS.
(bam)

763
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,487
I NEVER SEE'D THIS RIVER
KICK UP LIKE THIS BEFORE...

764
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,988
MUST BE A STORM A BREWIN'.

765
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:37,995
HEY!

766
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,501
THEM WINDSTORMS COME UP WITHOUT
GIVIN' NO ADVANCED NOTICE,

767
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,002
DON'T THEY?

768
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,005
I SEE'D YOUR WIFE...
HURT HER HARD.

769
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,508
PICKED ME UP AND
SLAMMED ME DOWN

770
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,511
LIKE I WAS A OLD
SPITTOON OR SOMETHIN'...

771
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:58,015
ALLOWED THEM TO KEEP
THEIR DOORS CLOSED
IN HURRICANE SEASON.

772
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,021
WHICH WAY'D SHE BLOW,
FROM THE NORTH OR THE
SOUTH?

773
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,024
SANDY?

774
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,530
HERE, USE MY KEY.

775
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,532
THEY'RE ALL ALIKE...
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

776
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,041
LOOKIN' FOR YOUR WIFE?

777
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,549
DON'T GUESS SHE'D BE IN
THAT SUITCASE, DO YA?

778
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,053
YOU AIN'T FIGURIN' ON
SHOOTIN' HER, ARE YA?

779
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,560
NOW WAIT A MINUTE!
MAYBE IT WEREN'T HER FAULT.

780
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,062
FOR A WOMAN, SHE
DIDN'T LOOK TOO BAD.

781
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,064
THE MAN DON'T SHOW MUCH SENSE,

782
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,066
SHOOTIN' A WOMAN...

783
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,068
ESPECIALLY IN THIS COUNTRY,
WHERE THEY'RE SO SCARCE.

784
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,580
(dog barking)

785
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:17,094
????
??

786
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:32,109
????
??

787
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:47,124
????
??

788
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,626
(Dr. Judson)
HOLD THAT LIGHT CLOSER.

789
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,637
(Sandy)
JOHN.

790
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,643
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, JOHN.

791
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,144
THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT ME.

792
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,648
IT WAS YOU THEY SHOT AT.

793
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,654
THIS MAN KNOW HIS
BUSINESS, BENDER?

794
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,155
IF HE DOESN'T,
YOUR WIFE MAY DIE...

795
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,661
IN WHICH EVENT I
ALSO CASH IN, RIGHT?

796
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,162
NOW IF SOMEONE WILL
HOLD HER OTHER ARM.

797
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,166
TAKE A DEEP BREATH,
MRS. DEVLIN.

798
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,669
JOHN, I'M FRIGHTENED.

799
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,676
NOT SO MUCH OF A WOUND,
THE DOC SAYS.

800
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,178
TROUBLE IS THAT BULLET'S
PRESSING ON AN ARTERY.

801
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,682
IF HE HAPPENS TO MAKE A SLIP
AND PUNCTURE THAT ARTERY,
THEN SHE'S GONNA BE IN TROUBLE.

802
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,686
IS THAT IT, DOC?
THAT'S IT.

803
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,688
ANYTHING ELSE YOU
WANTED TO SEE ME
ABOUT, DEVLIN?

804
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,690
SHE BE ALL RIGHT, DOC?

805
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,692
HER SHOULDER MAY BE
STIFF FOR A COUPLA DAYS.

806
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,694
MY GUESS IS THAT
SHE'LL OUTLIVE YOU.

807
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,697
HOW LONG WILL IT
TAKE YA TO FINISH UP?
A FEW MINUTES.

808
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,198
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
DEVLIN, YOU IN A
HURRY?

809
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,703
YEAH.
GET OVER THERE WITH BENDER!

810
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,705
(Bender)
LET ME REMIND YOU,
IF I HADN'T GOTTEN MRS. DEVLIN

811
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,207
OVER HERE TO
DR. JUDSON, SHE
MIGHT'VE DIED.

812
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,210
I'M REMEMBERIN' IT,
AND ALSO HOW SHE
CAME TO GET HIT.

813
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,713
MAYBE I OUGHTA FIX IT
SO ACCIDENTS LIKE THAT

814
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,215
CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
THAT CALLS FOR
KILLING TWO MEN

815
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,217
IN COLD BLOOD,
DOESN'T IT?
YES.

816
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,719
IT REQUIRES A
CERTAIN TYPE
OF MAN

817
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,721
TO KILL WITHOUT
EXCUSE, DEVLIN,

818
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,723
SOMEBODY MORE
LIKE MYSELF.
YOU COULDA KILLED HER, BENDER.

819
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,725
THAT'S ALL THE
EXCUSE I NEED.

820
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,727
(Sandy)
JOHN?

821
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,232
IS IT...
IS IT ALL OVER?

822
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,234
YOU SEEM TO HAVE
A SOBERING EFFECT

823
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,236
UPON YOUR HUSBAND,
MRS. DEVLIN.

824
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,739
YOU BETTER TAKE YOUR
WIFE BACK TO THE
HOTEL, DEVLIN.

825
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,741
PERHAPS IT'D BE TO THE
BENEFIT OF ALL OF US

826
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,242
IF YOU POINTED OUT
THE ADVANTAGES TO HIM

827
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,746
OF BOTH OF YOU
RETURNING TO CHICAGO.

828
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,748
SUPPOSE YOU
POINT 'EM OUT.

829
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,250
AN AGENT COMMISSIONED
TO OPTION LAND FOR
THE RAILROAD

830
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,753
CAN'T FUNCTION VERY WELL
WITHOUT MONEY, CAN HE?

831
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,257
I'LL BE OVER
TOMORROW FOR
THE MONEY.

832
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,260
TOMORROW MAY BE TOO LATE
FOR IT TO DO YOU ANY GOOD.

833
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,762
HAVE IT READY.

834
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,767
NICODEMUS!

835
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,770
COMIN', CAP'N.

836
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,272
GET UP OUTTA THERE!
THE TOWN'S DONE CLEANED OUT!

837
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,774
WHERE'S EVERYBODY AT?

838
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,777
CAP'N, WHY... WHY DOES

839
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,278

THEY'RE ALL GOIN' TA
FARGO ON THE SOM'DOTHER,

841
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,783
ON DA OTHER SIDE OF THEM TREES.

842
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,788
FARGO ON THE
PRAIRIE?

843
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,790
WHAT'S GOIN' ON
OVER THERE?

844
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,293
WHY... WHY YA HAS TA
ASK ME THAT, CAP'N?

845
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,797
MAN GOES SOMEPLACE,
IT'S A VISIT.

846
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,300
A BUNCH OF MEN GO SOMEPLACE,
IT'S A PARTY.

847
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,302
EVERYBODY GOES SOMEPLACE,
IT'S A MEETIN'.

848
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,305
WHATEVER'S GOIN' ON OVER THERE
HAS GOT TO BE A MEETIN', CAP'N,

849
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,307
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THEY'S ALL AT.

850
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,309
WELL, COME ON...
LET'S GO OVER.

851
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,314
IS YOU COMIN', OR
IS I GOTTA SHOVE
YA OVERBOARD!!

852
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,315
COMIN', CAP'N.

853
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,821
SO AS SOON AS I SAW THE CROP
WAS GONNA BE TOO BIG
FOR US TO HANDLE,

854
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,824
BEING PRESIDENT OF THE WHEAT
GROWERS ASSOCIATION,

855
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,826
I GUESS IT WAS UP TO ME
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

856
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,329
TO GET THE CROPS HARVESTED
AND OFF TO THE MARKET.

857
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,332
SO LIKE I TOLD YA,
I WENT TO MR. BENDER

858
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,334
AND MADE A DEAL FOR HIM
TO LEND US THE MONEY

859
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,336
TO BRING IN A GANG
OF HARVEST HANDS,

860
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,838
AND TO TAKE CARE OF
SHIPPIN' COSTS.

861
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,339
(farmer)
BUT WHY YOU GO
TO MR. BENDER?!

862
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,342
THE BANK IN GRAND FORK,
SHE'S GOT PLENTY OF
MONEY TO LEND!

863
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,844
(Slagin)
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH BENDER'S MONEY,

864
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,345
AIN'T IT ANY GOOD?

865
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,848
(Collins)
MR. BENDER'S DONE PLENTY
FOR US AROUND HERE.

866
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,351
HE'S GIVE US CREDIT
AT THE STORE
AND STAKED A FEW OF US.

867
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:38,355
AND I SAY HERE AND NOW!
IF THERE'S ANY SIDE MONEY
TO BE MADE AROUND HERE,

868
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,356
HE'S THE MAN WHO
OUGHT TO GET IT.

869
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,364
BUT THIS CONTRACT
WE ARE TO SIGN,

870
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,366
IF SOMETHING IS
WRONG WITH CROPS,

871
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,369
ALL OUR LAND WILL BELONG
TO MR. BENDER?

872
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,371
WELL, A MAN HAS TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF SECURITY

873
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,873
FOR THE MONEY HE
PUTS UP, AIN'T HE?

874
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,376
IT'S DUMB BUTTS LIKE YOU
THAT KEEP US SMART FOLKS
FROM PROGRESSIN'.

875
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,880
WHAT YOU GOT TO
SAY ABOUT THIS?
YOU DON'T FARM NO LANDS!

876
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,885
NOBODY CAN TALK THAT WAY TO ME!

877
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,887
WHAT HE... WHAT HE DON'T
KNOW IS THAT I...

878
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,889
I GOT SECRET HOLDIN'S.

879
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,891
I GOT A PIECE OF 10,000 ACRES,

880
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,893
AND I AIM TO SEE THAT WHEAT
CUT WITH FARGO MONEY.

881
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,895
AND IF THERE'S ANY
PROFIT TO BE MADE,

882
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,897
I WANT MY GOOD FRIEND, MR.
BENDER, TO COLLECT IT, SEE?!

883
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,402
AND ANOTHER THING...
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THE CROP,

884
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,905
MR. BENDER'S GONNA PAY US
FOR WHAT THE LAND IS WORTH,

885
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,907
ACCORDIN' TO GOVERNMENT
VALUATION--

886
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,909
A DOLLAR AN ACRE!

887
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:36,413
AND WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO
BUY WORTHLESS PRAIRIE ACREAGE
WITH NOTHIN' GROWIN' ON IT?

888
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,423
WHAT MR. COLLINS SAID
SOUNDS LOGICAL ENOUGH.

889
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,426
ALL I KNOW IS THIS
DEAL IS FIXIN' THINGS

890
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,429
SO THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
OF BENDER BUYING OUR LAND.

891
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,931
AND ANOTHER THING...

892
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,433
THE WHOLE BLAMED LAYOUT
IS SO SLICK AND PRETTY
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

893
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,434
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A CATCH IN IT.

894
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,436
EXACTLY WHAT I
WAS THINKING,
MR. PLUMMER.

895
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,438
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO THE WHEAT CROP,

896
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,940
LOOKS TO ME LIKE I'M
STUCK WITH ABOUT

897
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,442
50 SQUARE MILES OF
WORTHLESS PRAIRIE.

898
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,944
SO AS A FAVOR TO ME,
WILL YOU LET OUT

899
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,446
A MAN-SIZED PROTEST
ABOUT THE WHOLE DEAL,

900
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,448
AND GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO SQUEEZE OUT OF IT?

901
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,451
DON'T GUESS IT'D DO
ME ANY GOOD FOR ME TO
SAY ANYTHING, BENDER,

902
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,453
A COUPLE OTHER
MEN TRIED THAT

903
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,455
AND GOT NOWHERE.

904
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,457
SEEMS LIKE I HAVE TOO MANY
FRIENDS, DOESN'T IT?

905
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,460
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
WORTHLESS PRAIRIE OR NOT,

906
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,463
YOU'RE GOING TO OWN ALL THE
LAND AROUND HERE, MR. BENDER.

907
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,966
DO YOU EXPECT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN
TO YOUR WHEAT, MRS. STOWE?

908
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,968
WELL, ALONG WITH SOME
OTHER BONANZA FARMERS,

909
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,971
LIKE MRS. STOWE AND MR. WATERS,

910
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,973
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO
GET BURNED OUT.

911
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,975
SOMEBODY COME ALONG
WITH A TORCH, EH?

912
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,978
WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR FARM
BUILDINGS COULD HAPPEN TO
OUR WHEAT.

913
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,480
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOUR
WHEAT, I'M THE LOSER.

914
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,983
SO I THINK WE BETTER TAKE
STEPS TO SEE THAT NOTHING
DOES HAPPEN TO IT.

915
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,485
WHAT KIND OF STEPS,
MR. BENDER?

916
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,487
WHEN THE PEACE OF A
COMMUNITY IS DISTURBED

917
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,489
BY VIOLENCE AND ACTS OF
VANDALISM, MRS. STOWE,

918
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,491
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
TO DO ABOUT IT

919
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,994
AND THAT'S BRING IN THE LAW,
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

920
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,004
SOUNDS HONEST
ENOUGH, DIDN'T HE?

921
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,006
I'D NEVER HAD
SUSPECTED HIM,

922
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,509
IF ANSON HADN'T SAID HE
WAS JUST NO GOOD AT ALL.

923
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,011
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
HAVE MYSELF,

924
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,013
IF IT WASN'T FOR THE
FACT THAT EVERYONE
THAT WAS BURNED OUT

925
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,016
GOT AN OFFER FROM HIM
FOR THEIR LAND FIRST.

926
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,019
COME ON, NICODEMUS,
THIS IS NO PLACE FOR US.

927
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,020
COMIN', CAP'N.

928
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:38,535
????
??

929
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:47,544
????
??

930
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,546
SO THE ONE WITH ALL
THE EYEBROWS SAYS TO
ME, HE SAYS...

931
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,548
"WHAT MAKES YOU
SO DIFFERENT?"

932
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,050
OF COURSE, I COULD
ALWAYS TRIM HIS
EYEBROWS A LITTLE,

933
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,052
BUT EVEN IF I DID,
WHAT WOULD I HAVE?

934
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,053
A WHEAT FARM.

935
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,554
I'LL TAKE A NICE,
DIRTY MINER

936
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,556
WITH GOLD DUST CAKED
UNDER HIS FINGERNAILS.

937
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,558
IF YOU CAN SPARE ONE.
ME, TOO.

938
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:06,063
THERE I WAS IN CALIFORNIA, UP
TO MY ELBOWS IN HARD-ROCK MEN,
AND I HAD TO COME HERE.

939
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,565
I COULD'VE MARRIED,
SETTLED DOWN AND HAD
MYSELF A NICE HOME.

940
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,067
AND A NATIVE SON.

941
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,569
PUT IT IN A GILT
FRAME, AND I'LL
BUY IT.

942
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,072
LOOK, GIRLS, THEBELL OF THE
NORTHWESTGETS IN TONIGHT,

943
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,075
AND COLLINS WANTS YOU ALL THERE
AT THE LANDING WHEN SHE TIES UP,

944
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,077
LOOKING YOUR BEST, SO BE THERE.

945
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,581
OH, EXCUSE ME...
I THOUGHT THIS
WAS THE KITCHEN.

946
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,083
WELL, IT IS THE KITCHEN.

947
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,086
LOOKING FOR ANYONE
IN PARTICULAR?

948
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,587
I WANTED TO GET
A COUPLE OF EGGS.

949
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,090
WELL, IN THAT
CASE, COME ON
IN.

950
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,093
WE'LL THANK YOU TO SPEAK
OF US WITH MORE RESPECT,
MR. DEVLIN.

951
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,594
WE USUALLY TAKE THE
EGG TO THE CUSTOMER,

952
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,097
UNLESS THE CUSTOMER
INSISTS ON COMING
TO THE EGG.

953
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,099
WE WANT YOU TO BE
HAPPY, OF COURSE.

954
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,601
AND YOU'RE JUST THE
LITTLE GIRL THAT
CAN DO IT, EH?

955
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,603
WELL, THESE EGGS
ARE FOR MRS. DEVLIN,

956
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,605
AND I THOUGHT I'D
TAKE THEM UP TO HER.

957
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,608
YOU SEE, SHE, UH...
SHE HAS A HEADACHE.

958
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,611
PEOPLE GET THEM
IN FARGO.

959
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,613
IF YOU WANT TO
GET BACK TO YOUR
CROCHETING, GIRLS,

960
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,615
I'LL LOOK AFTER
MR. DEVLIN.

961
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,617
HOW ABOUT A COUPLE
OF EGGS FOR MR.
DEVLIN, NORA?

962
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,620
AIN'T GOT NO EGGS...
THE GIRLS ATE 'EM ALL UP.

963
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,622
BUT WE GROW THEM RIGHT
OUTSIDE THE DOOR,

964
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,124
IF YOU'VE GOT
TO HAVE THEM.

965
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,625
WELL, I'M AN OLD
EGG RUSTLER.

966
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,128
NO FUN RUSTLING
ALONE.

967
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,130
DID I SAY RUSTLING?

968
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,631
I MEANT RUSTLING.

969
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,637
(knock knock knock
knock knock knock)

970
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,139
IT'S NOT LOCKED!

971
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,141
WHERE ON EARTH DID
YOU GO FOR THE EGGS?!

972
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,142
MORNIN', MA'AM.

973
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,145
OH.
WHERE IS MR. DEVLIN?

974
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,646
HE'S GETTING ME
SOME BREAKFAST

975
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,148
FROM ST. PAUL,
I THINK.

976
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,649
IS IT SOMETHING
IMPORTANT?

977
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,151
NO, MA'AM, I DON'T
GUESS IT IS.

978
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,153
BUT BENDER IS OVER IN
FARGO ON THE PRAIRIE

979
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,155
GETTIN' THEM FARMERS
TO SIGN CONTRACTS.

980
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,157
I THOUGHT MAYBE MR.
DEVLIN WOULD LIKE TO
KNOW ABOUT IT.

981
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:44,161
OH, I'M SURE HE WOULD.
RUN DOWN TO THE KITCHEN.

982
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,163
NEVER MIND,
I'LL GO MYSELF.

983
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,165
LOOK...

984
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,667
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT
THERE'S A MAN DOWN THERE

985
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,669
WHO'S BEEN WATCHING
THIS WINDOW.

986
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:56,173
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
HE'S SPYIN' ON
SOMEONE, HUH?

987
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,674
WELL, WE'LL SOON FIND
OUT ABOUT THAT.

988
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,678
HEY, GO AWAY!

989
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,181
(Bang!)

990
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:08,185
DAGNABIT, I GOTTA LEARN TO KEEP
MY HEAD OUT'N THEM WINDOWS
FOR I GET ALL CUT UP.

991
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,188
FOR THE RECORD,

992
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,690
YOU WERE WITH
MORGAN'S RAIDERS...
FIRST COMPANY...

993
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,192
FAST WITH A GUN...
NONE FASTER...

994
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,194
A KILLER...
WITH BOTH HANDS...

995
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,196
AND YOU'RE AN AGENT
FOR THE RAILROAD?

996
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,698
UH, THEY KNOW THAT.
MM-HMM.

997
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,700
WELL, THAT'S
FOR COLLINS.

998
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,202
NOW WHAT'S FOR ME?

999
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,706
WELL, NOT MUCH, HONEY.

1000
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,209
JUST MARRIED?
A COUPLA WEEKS.

1001
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,211
GOOD, EH?
SWELL.

1002
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,713
NICE GAL?
THE BEST.

1003
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,215
SHE'D HAVE TO
BE, OF COURSE,

1004
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,716
OR YOU'D HAVE SENT HER
DOWN FOR THE EGGS.

1005
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,721
THESE HENS SEEM TO BE A
LITTLE SLOW ON DELIVERY.

1006
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,725
THINK THEY'RE
IN THE MOOD?
THEY'VE NO EXCUSE.

1007
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,227
I JUST SHOWED THEM
HOW IT'S DONE.

1008
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:56,233
WELL, I'D LIKE TO TELL YA THAT
I THINK YOU'RE
AN ALL-RIGHT GAL,

1009
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,734
BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO
HEAR THAT, WOULD YOU?

1010
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,737
MM-MM, NOTHING
SECONDHAND.

1011
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,740
AND THIS MAY
NOT BE FINAL...
WHO CAN TELL?

1012
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,743
ANYWAY, I'LL CHECK WITH
YA FROM TIME TO TIME.

1013
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,245
WELL, IN THE MEANTIME,
DON'T PASS UP ANYTHING

1014
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,747
THAT'LL DO JUST AS
WELL, EH, JERSEY?

1015
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,749
SEE YA LATER.

1016
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,751
COME TO THINK OF IT,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL WAIT.

1017
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,753
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'LL
BE GOING ANYPLACE FOR...

1018
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,755
A COUPLE OF HOURS.
WHY NOT?

1019
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,758
WHY... I THINK...

1020
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,260
BENDER'S MEN...

1021
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,762
THEY'VE ORDERS NOT TO LET
YOU OUT OF THE HOTEL.

1022
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,765
WHY?
WHAT'S UP?

1023
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,268
WHY, I THINK...

1024
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,770
BENDER AND COLLINS,
THEY'RE AT FARGO ON
THE PRAIRIE

1025
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,772
SIGNING A CONTRACT
WITH THE WHEAT GROWERS.

1026
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,780
DON'T BE A FOOL.
IT'S NOT ONLY THEM,
THEY'VE GOT 20 MEN.

1027
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,782
YOU HAVEN'T GOT
A CHANCE.

1028
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,785
YEAH.
I KNOW.

1029
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:59,296
????
??

1030
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:09,806
????
??

1031
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,808
HAVE YOU SEEN
MR. DEVLIN?

1032
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,310
PLEASE, HAVE YOU
SEEN MR. DEVLIN?

1033
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,820
(bang)

1034
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,323
(bang bang)

1035
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,325
HE'S RIDING TO FARGO
ON THE PRAIRIE...

1036
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,826
ON BUSINESS, I
THINK HE SAID.

1037
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,331
I JUST WANTED TO
SAY, FRIENDS,

1038
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,334
I'D LIKE TO THANK MR.
BENDER FOR PUTTIN' MY
NAME UP FOR OFFICE

1039
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,336
AND ALL YOU BOYS FOR
GETTIN' IN BACK OF ME.

1040
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,842
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I WANT TO WARN YA,

1041
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,844
FRIEND AND FOE ALIKE,

1042
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:51,348
AS LONG AS I'M MARSHALL,
THERE'S GONNA BE LAW
AND ORDER IN FARGO.

1043
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,857
LOOKS LIKE IMPORTANT
THINGS HAPPENING IN
FARGO, MRS. STOWE.

1044
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,859
YES, AND ALL IN
ONE DAY TOO.

1045
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,861
OH, MR. DEVLIN,
MEET MR. PLUMMER.

1046
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,863
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW ARE YA?

1047
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,365
HOW IS YOUR VERY
CHARMING WIFE?

1048
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,367
SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
THANKS.

1049
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,869
IS THIS A FREE
EXPRESSION OF THE
WILL OF THE PEOPLE?

1050
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,871
EH, A LITTLE FARMER
WHO DIDN'T KNOW VERY
MUCH,

1051
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,373
OPENED HIS MOUTH
TO SAY SOMETHING

1052
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,375
AND FOUND HE WAS
CHEWING ON COBB'S
KNUCKLES,

1053
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,877
AND THE WILL OF THE
PEOPLE CURLED UP LIKE
A SICK MACKEREL.

1054
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,879
THEN THE DEAL'S
BEEN MADE.

1055
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,381
YES, AND IF OUR
CROPS ARE HARVESTED,

1056
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,383
MR. BENDER TAKES
A PROFIT.

1057
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,386
IF THEY'RE NOT
HARVESTED, HE TAKES US.

1058
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,388
IN OTHER WORDS, WITH
COLLINS AS MARSHALL,

1059
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,391
WE'LL BE DRAWN
AND QUARTERED.

1060
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,893
WELL, IF YOU
DON'T LIKE IT,

1061
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,895
ONE OTHER THING
YOU CAN DO...

1062
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,398
PACK UP AND GET OUT.

1063
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,400
OR ORGANIZE AN
OPPOSING TEAM.

1064
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,410
DEVLIN, I BELIEVE
I HAVE SOME MONEY
OF YOURS.

1065
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,412
WOULD YOU
LIKE IT NOW?

1066
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,415
NO PLACE TO INVEST IT
AROUND FARGO, IS THERE?

1067
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,916
MIGHT OPEN UP A
POPCORN STAND,

1068
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,419
THE COMMUNITY'S BOUND
TO GROW WHEN THE
RAILROAD COMES THROUGH.

1069
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,422
WHAT RAILROAD?

1070
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,924
I SEE YOU MADE
COLLINS MARSHALL.

1071
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,927
YEAH, GOOD MAN.

1072
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,431
YOU RIDIN' MY WAY?
YEAH.

1073
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,432
COME ON.

1074
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,957
NOW ABOUT THAT
RAILROAD, I...
ON SECOND THOUGHT, BENDER,

1075
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,460
MAYBE YOU BETTER LET ME
HAVE THAT MONEY NOW.

1076
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,463
IT'S SAFE AT THE HOTEL.
YOU FOUND A USE FOR IT?

1077
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,965
YEAH, I'M PULLIN'
OUT TONIGHT.

1078
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,467
CHICAGO?

1079
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,970
NOPE, GRAND FORKS.

1080
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,972
DAKOTA?

1081
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,474
YEAH.

1082
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,987
YOU'RE TRYIN' TO RUN A
BLAZER ON ME, DEVLIN,

1083
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,989
BUT YOU'RE BETTIN'
AGAINST A BAD HAND.

1084
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,991
THINK SO?
YEP.

1085
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,993
YOU SEE, I FOLLOWED
THE SURVEYORS UP HERE.

1086
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,995
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THE
GOVERNMENT'S GRANTED
THE RIGHT OF WAY

1087
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,497
AND PLANS HAVE
ALREADY BEEN DRAWN

1088
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,499
FOR THE RAILROAD TO
RUN THROUGH FARGO.

1089
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,502
BUT THEY COULD CHANGE
THOSE PLANS, RUN THROUGH
GRAND FORKS.

1090
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,003
NOT AFTER THEY'VE
SPENT ALL THAT MONEY

1091
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,005
RUNNIN' A SURVEY
THROUGH HERE.

1092
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,507
HOW MUCH DO YOU
THINK THAT'D COST?

1093
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,509
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.
AND HOW MUCH
WOULD IT COST

1094
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,011
TO BUY THAT CONTRACT YOU
MADE WITH THE FARMERS?

1095
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,014
ONE-HALF MILLION DOLLARS,
GOOD AMERICAN GO...

1096
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,520
OH.

1097
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,527
SEE, IT'D STILL BE
CHEAPER TO RUN
ANOTHER SURVEY

1098
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,529
AND BYPASS FARGO.

1099
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,031
YEAH, I SUPPOSE
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

1100
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,033
LIKE CONSIGNING THAT
CONTRACT YOU HAVE
WITH THE FARMERS

1101
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,035
OVER TO ME...

1102
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,036
FOR A CONSIDERATION,
OF COURSE?

1103
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,541
LET'S GO IN MY OFFICE.
WHY NOT?

1104
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,546
THERE YA ARE...

1105
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,548
TWENTY THOUSAND ON
ACCOUNT, AND EIGHTY
THOUSAND

1106
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,550
WHEN THE RAILROAD
COMES THROUGH.

1107
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,052
YOU'RE TAKIN' ME
OVER, DEVLIN.

1108
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,554
MAYBE, BUT A SURE
HUNDRED THOUSAND

1109
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:21,558
IS BETTER THAN HALF A
MILLION IN THE BUSH.

1110
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:25,061
WELL, THERE IT IS,
CONSIGNED TO YOU
PERSONALLY, RIGHT?

1111
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:25,562
NATURALLY.

1112
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,566
(boat whistle)

1113
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,067
HERE SHE COMES...

1114
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,069
THE BOAT'S COMIN'!
HERE SHE COMES!

1115
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:45,081
????
??

1116
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:57,093
????
??

1117
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,596
THERE'S NICODEMUS...
THE HORSES MUST BE READY.

1118
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,598
BUT I STILL CAN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY
WE'RE LEAVING.

1119
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,600
YOU'VE GOT THE
CONTRACTS.
WE'RE LEAVING

1120
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,102
BECAUSE WE GOTTA STAY
AWAY FROM BENDER UNTIL
THE WHEAT'S HARVESTED.

1121
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,104
IF HE CAN'T GET HIS
HANDS ON THAT CONTRACT,

1122
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,607
HE WON'T BURN THE WHEAT--
IT WON'T DO HIM ANY GOOD.

1123
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,610
WHAT IF SOMEONE SEES US
TAKING OUR BAGS OUT?

1124
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,613
THEY WON'T.
AFTER BOUNCE ARRANGES
TO HAVE US PICKED UP,

1125
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,114
HE'S COMIN' BACK FOR 'EM.

1126
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,616
THEN THEY'LL SEE HIM.

1127
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,118
LET'S NOT MAKE THE
WORST OF IT UNTIL
WE GET IT, SANDY.

1128
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,120
WE'LL GO DOWN AND SEE
THE RIVERBOAT COME IN.

1129
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,122
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD?
WHY NOT?

1130
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,124
THEY'RE WATCHING US...
LET'S LET 'EM SEE US.

1131
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,627
THEN THEY WON'T THINK
WE'RE UP TO ANY TRICKS.

1132
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,630
IF YOU WEREN'T TRYING TO
BE SO FINE AND NOBLE,

1133
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,632
WE WOULDN'T BE IN
THIS AWFUL MESS.

1134
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,134
SURE... YOU CAN REMEMBER
ME AS A MAN WHO...

1135
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,136
GAVE HIS ALL FOR HIS FELLOW MAN.

1136
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,139
I REMEMBER YOU AS
A BIG SO-AND-SO,

1137
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,141
WHO I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITHOUT.

1138
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,144
WAIT A MINUTE...
TEARS AND EVERYTHING.

1139
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,646
WHAT IS THIS, GOOD-BYE?

1140
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,649
I DON'T KNOW, BUT...
I JUST DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO US.

1141
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,151
LIKE THINGS THE
WAY THEY ARE, EH?

1142
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,153
WHERE WOULD I EVER
FIND ANOTHER

1143
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,155
HANDSOME, EASY-GOING...

1144
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,158
NO-GOOD MAN LIKE ME?
YES.

1145
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,161
IN ANY FIRST-CLASS JAIL
WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI.

1146
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,167
HOW'D YOU DO WITH
THEM PESKY SAND BARS?

1147
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,170
GET YOURSELF HUNG UP
ON OL' CAMELBACK?!

1148
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:18,675
SURE, I DID, AND I GOT
MYSELF OFF OF'N 'EM,
TOO, BY JUCIFER!

1149
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,176
GET ABOARD, 'N
COME UP HERE!

1150
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,183
WE HAD AN ESCORT
FROM THE HOTEL.

1151
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,687
YEAH, SLAGIN
AND COBB.

1152
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,189
LOOKS LIKE BENDER'S
TRAVELING.

1153
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,691
HE'S PROBABLY LEAVING
ON THE BOAT, TOO.

1154
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,694
THAT'S RIGHT,
CHECK UP ON US.

1155
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,697
LET'S FIND OUT.

1156
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,699
GOOD EVENING.
GOOD EVENING.

1157
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,201
DEVLIN... MRS. DEVLIN,
HOW'S THE SHOULDER
THIS EVENING?

1158
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,203
BETTER, THANKS.
THAT'S FINE.

1159
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,205
NOT GOING AWAY,
ARE YOU?

1160
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,208
YES, I AM,
FOR A FEW DAYS.

1161
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,712
GRAND FORKS?
NO, CHICAGO.

1162
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,215
I MADE A LITTLE DEAL.
I'M GOING TO
CHECK UP ON IT.

1163
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,718
JOHN, LOOK!
IT'S MR. GEARY.

1164
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,220
GEARY?
FATHER MUST HAVE SENT
HIM HERE TO BUY THE LAND

1165
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,723
FOR THE RAILROAD.

1166
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,228
SANDRA.

1167
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:16,733
I DID IT AGAIN.
BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME?

1168
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,739
YOUR FATHER TOLD ME
THAT YOU SKIPPED OFF
WITH A RASCAL NAMED DEVLIN.

1169
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,240
I DIDN'T BELIEVE
IT, OF COURSE...

1170
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,242
I MEAN, ABOUT HIS
BEING A RASCAL.

1171
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,744
SOMEHOW I COULDN'T
IMAGINE YOU MARRYING
ANYONE

1172
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,246
WHO WASN'T MADE OF
BONE AND MUSCLE...

1173
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,248
THAT MAKES YOU
DEVLIN, RIGHT?

1174
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,251
I CAN'T GET OUT FROM
UNDER IT EITHER.
I'M GEARY, CONGRATULATIONS.

1175
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,754
YOU MARRIED A GREAT
LITTLE GIRL.
I'VE KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE.

1176
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,256
BEEN WITH HER FATHER
FOR 25 YEARS.

1177
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,259
I SHOULDN'T TALK SO LOUD.
I'M HERE, MORE
OR LESS, INCOGNITO.

1178
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,262
SPEAK RIGHT OUT,
MR. GEARY, WE'RE
FRIENDS HERE.

1179
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,764
NOTHING YOU SAY'LL EVER
BE USED AGAINST YOU.

1180
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,766
I'M JIM BENDER...
THIS IS MR. COLLINS,
OUR MARSHALL.

1181
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,769
UH, MR. GEARY, I, UH...
WE WERE JUST GOING
TO THE HOTEL.

1182
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,271
YEAH... SEE YA
LATER, BENDER.
I'LL WALK ALONG WITH YOU.

1183
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,274
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO
TALK TO SOMEBODY FROM
THE OUTSIDE.

1184
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,776
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A
BIG SECRET, I KNOW,

1185
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,778
BUT, UH, WE ALL KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE

1186
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,280
TO BUY A FEW PIECES OF
LAND FOR THE RAILROAD.

1187
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,284
BUT DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
ABOUT IT, UNLESS YOU FEEL
YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS.

1188
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,287
WELL, THE BIGGEST PART
OF MY JOB IS TO
KEEP MY MOUTH CLOSED,

1189
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,289
BUT OF COURSE, YOU'RE
PRIVILEGED TO THINK
WHAT YOU PLEASE.

1190
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,793
I'M PLEASED TO THINK
THAT YOU JUST SAVED ME
A GOOD PIECE OF MONEY.

1191
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,295
BY THE WAY,
MR. DEVLIN...

1192
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,300
SLAGIN, YOU AND
COBB GO AFTER HIM.

1193
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,802
BRING BACK THAT
CONTRACT.

1194
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,805
COLLINS, ROUND UP
WHAT MEN YOU'VE GOT,
AND MEET ME AT THE STORE.

1195
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,809
SOMETHING TELLS ME
I TURNED UP AT THE
WRONG MOMENT.

1196
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,310
OH, YOU CERTAINLY DID.

1197
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,818
GOT EVERYTHING FIXED
UP JUST LIKE YOU
WANTED, MA'AM.

1198
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,820
CAP'N SPARKS IS GONNA
SLOW DOWN AND PICK YA UP

1199
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,822
RIGHT OFF'N WHERE THE
RIVER BIRDWENT DOWN.

1200
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,323
BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
LIKE HE WAS SAYIN'

1201
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:50,326
WHEN I WAS TELLIN' HIM WHAT'S
GOIN' ON AROUND HERE.
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE

1202
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,329
WE'RE CHASIN' AROUND,
DUCKIN' OUR OWN SHADOWS, DO YA?

1203
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,332
BUT CAPTAIN, RIGHT NOW BENDER'S
MEN ARE LOOKING FOR MR. DEVLIN,

1204
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,334
AND WE'VE GOT TO HELP HIM.

1205
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,336
OH, I DON'T THINK THAT
MUCH IS GONNA HAPPEN.

1206
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,338
BUT IT WILL... IT IS!

1207
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,341
LOOK, CAPTAIN, YOU KNOW
MOST OF THE MEN IN FARGO.

1208
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,844
PLEASE LET THEM KNOW WHAT
MR. DEVLIN'S DONE FOR THEM,

1209
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,846
AND ASK THEM TO STAND BY.

1210
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,849
WELL, I'LL TALK TO SOME OF THE
BOYS AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY,

1211
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,350
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
GONNA BE INTERESTED.

1212
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,356
WHAT IF HE DOES MANAGE
TO FIND HELP, WHAT THEN?

1213
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:24,861
OH, MR. GEARY, IF
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO
THAT BIG SO-AND-SO,

1214
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,863
I'LL JUST DIE,
THAT'S ALL.

1215
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,372
A RIDER GO BY THIS
WAY, PARTNER?

1216
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,374
(speaking Italian)

1217
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,376
ITALIAN?
(speaking Italian)

1218
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:46,883
CIANO.
(speaking Italian)

1219
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,388
HE SEEN ONE LOOKED
JUST LIKE DEVLIN.

1220
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,903
MR. PLUMMER?
OH, HELLO, MR. DEVLIN...
HOW ARE YA?

1221
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,404
HELLO!

1222
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,406
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO YOUR FOOT?

1223
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,909
OH, SPRAINED IT, I
GUESS... MAKES IT
KINDA AWKWARD, TOO.

1224
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,911
I WANTED TO GO
OVER TO STOWES'.

1225
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,412
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO YA A MINUTE.

1226
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,414
WELL, COME INSIDE.

1227
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,917
WE'RE HOLDING A MEETING
TO TALK THINGS OVER.

1228
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,418
AT THE STOWES'?
YES.

1229
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,921
HILDA, THIS IS
MR. DEVLIN.
HOWDY, MR. DEVLIN.

1230
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,923
MRS. PLUMMER.
THERE'S A FEW OF
US MIGHT NOT LIKE

1231
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,926
THE WAY THE
BENDER/COLLINS FACTION
WILL HANDLE THINGS,

1232
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:33,930
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D GET TOGETHER
AND SORT OF, UH...
COUNT OUR GUNS.

1233
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,432
WE HAVEN'T MUCH
TO OFFER IN THE
WAY OF COMFORTS.

1234
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,935
WE WERE BURNED OUT.
YEAH, WE HAD TO THROW UP
A SOD HOUSE--

1235
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,436
HAD TO HAVE SOME
KIND OF SHELTER.

1236
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,940
WELL, BENDER'S A LITTLE
CARELESS WITH MATCHES.

1237
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,442
WELL, I'VE GOT SOMETHING
HERE THAT MAY MAKE YOU
FEEL A LITTLE BETTER.

1238
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:50,446
I GOT BENDER TO SIGN
OVER THAT CONTRACT
HE MADE WITH THE FARMERS TO ME.

1239
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,949
THE RAILROAD'S
COMING THROUGH HERE,

1240
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,951
AND THIS LAND'S
GONNA BE WORTH A
NICE CHUNK OF MONEY.

1241
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,953
(Mrs. Plummer)
THIS IS WONDERFUL.

1242
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:00,456
AND IF YOU WANT TO
STAY HERE AND KINDA
LOOK THIS THING OVER,

1243
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,959
I'LL GO OVER TO THE
STOWES' AND BRING THE
BOYS BACK HERE.

1244
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,463
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DO YOU GET
OUT OF THIS?

1245
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,968
WELL, WHEN THE
RAILROAD PAYS OFF,

1246
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,971
YOU CAN TAKE 20,000 OUT
OF THE KITTY FOR ME.

1247
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,473
CALL IT A HOUSE CUT.

1248
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:31,988
????

1249
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:40,997

1250
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,000
LET'S SEE NOW...

1251
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,003
I'LL SAY, "COME ON, BOYS, AND
GIT YOUR GUNS AND COME ALONG.

1252
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:50,506
"THINGS IS GONNA
BUST WIDE OPEN."

1253
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:54,510
THEN THEY'LL SAY TO
ME, "WHAT THINGS?"

1254
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,512
WHEN I'M TRYIN' TO THINK
OF THE ANSWER TO THAT ONE,

1255
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,515
SOMEONE'LL FETCH ME OVER THE
HEAD WITH A SACK A MEAL,

1256
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:04,520
AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL
GET FOR THROWIN' IN
WITH THIS FOOL KINDA BUSINESS.

1257
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,023
I SAID IT BEFORE,
AND I'LL SAY IT NOW...

1258
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,526
NOTHIN'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO NOBODIES... NO TIME.

1259
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,028
(bang bang)

1260
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,036
(whistling)

1261
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,542
"TO JOHN DEVLIN,
I, JAMES K. BENDER,

1262
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,045
RELINQUISH ALL RIGHTS
AND INTERESTS."

1263
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,547
THAT'S IT...
ALL RIGHT, MEN.

1264
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,550
YOU AND I'LL GET
THINGS STARTED AND
HEAD BACK TO TOWN.

1265
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:50,066
HUH, DON'T LOOK LIKE THE

NOPE, NOBODY HOME.

LOOKIN' FOR PEOPLE THAT AIN'T
AROUND IS A FOOL BUSINESS.

1274
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:26,602
IF THEY AIN'T AT THE STOWE
PLACE, THEY AIN'T NO PLACE,
AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'M GOIN'.

1275
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,104

1280
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,643

1282
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,150

1286
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,662

1384

1385
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,209

1386
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:42,217

WELL, THERE IT IS.

1391
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,313
AND IF IT ISN'T
ALL THERE,

1392
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,315
YOU'LL HAVE TO
COLLECT THE REST
OF IT YOURSELF.

1393
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,823
STAND BY AFORE AND AFT!
SHE'S READY TO CAST OFF!

1394
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,826
GET ON THAT SPRING
LINE OVER THERE!

1395
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,828
I HOPE THEY GET THE
SUITCASES ABOARD,

1396
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,330
BUT BAGS OR NO BAGS, WE'RE
HEADIN' FOR CALIFORNIA.

1397
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,332
YOU KNOW, JOHN, THAT
RAILROAD MONEY

1398
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,335
ISN'T GOING TO HELP
EVERYONE THAT WAS
BURNT OUT.

1399
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,838
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY OUGHTA FORM
SOME KIND OF A POOL

1400
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:46,842
AND FIX IT SO
EVERYBODY'D HAVE ENOUGH
TILL THE NEXT HARVEST.

1401
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,844
THAT'S WONDERFUL...
WHY DON'T YOU DO IT?

1402
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,846
WE'RE GOIN' TO
CALIFORNIA.

1403
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:54,349
BUT YOU'RE A HERO NOW.
WE COULD GO INTO ANY
BUSINESS WE LIKE.

1404
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,352
MAYBE, UM, RIVERBOAT.
YEAH?

1405
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:58,854
WITH A RAILROAD
COMIN' THROUGH?

1406
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,356
BUT IT WILL BE ALMOST
A YEAR BEFORE IT'S
FINISHED,

1407
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,358
AND IN THE MEANTIME,
WE COULD HANDLE ALL
THE SHIPPING.

1408
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,861
CUT IT OUT, SANDY, BEFORE
YOU HAVE ME IN TEARS.

1409
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,363
I DID IT BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU, THAT'S
WHY I DID IT.

1410
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,867

MUCH OBLIGED TO YA, MR. DEVLIN!

1415
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,879
MUCH OBLIGED?
WHAT FOR?

1416
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:25,881

1417
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,884
