DURANT: What brings the defender
of the saints to Laramie?

3

EVA: What's this?

00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:09,536
JOSIE: I'm not stealing from you.

EVA: Don't mistake me for soft, Josie.

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,762
BRIGHAM: Salt Lake City's
to be the terminus.

7
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:15,844
BRIGHAM: I have assurances
from both railroads.

8

HUNTINGTON: No luck finding
your wife and child?

00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,817
PHINEAS: My father's
declared a work stoppage.

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,729
We are to report home to
Salt Lake immediately.

SWEDE: Are you prepared for your ascension?

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,057
STROBRIDGE: President Ulysses S. Grant
has called a meeting in Salt Lake City...

13
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:29,459
and you my friend are late.

DURANT: <i>Gentlemen, if you please.</i>

COLLIS: <i>Wait, we are
getting absolutely nowhere.</i>

16
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,620
- DURANT: <i>May I repeat...</i>
- COLLIS: <i>You have made your point, sir.</i>

17
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:37,893
DURANT: <i>For the record, this time.</i>

18
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:40,899
COLLIS: <i>For the record, we are going
round and round and round in circles.</i>

19
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,713
DURANT: <i>This meeting, I'm beginning
to think, has no shape at all.</i>

20
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:45,285
COLLIS: <i>No. No shape,
nor a purpose. Neither.</i>

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,391
DUNT: May I suggest
we start from the beginning?

22
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:50,386
No. Let's start at right now.

23
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:55,201
I want an answer, Mr. Durant.

24
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:57,977
Not an equivocation, not a redirect...

25
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,611
A simple answer to a simple question.

26
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:05,566
Will the Union Pacific build north or south

27
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,367
of the Great Salt Lake?

28
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:11,212
The Union Pacific is planning to build

29
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,113
south to Salt Lake City.

30
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:16,787
This great city in which we are gathered

31
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:21,698
is and has always been
our designated terminus.

32
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,100
Are you suggesting
Miss Ellison made this up?

33
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:28,613
I am stating that Miss Ellison
is a journalist, Mr. President.

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,149
She will write anything to sell newspapers.

35
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:33,754
I thought her prose, uh, well founded,

36
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,563
articulated and... And
compelling, frankly, Mr. Durant.

37
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:40,100
Nobody is interested in your
literary criticism, Mr. Hunting...

38
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,171
Gentlemen. Per my contract

39
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:44,644
with Collis Huntington and
the Central Pacific Railroad,

40
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,516
he had agreed to build south
through Salt Lake City.

41
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,452
Cassius?

42
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:53,528
Yet this map, which I am
recently come to possess,

43
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:56,334
proves him to be both a liar and a thief.

44
00:01:58,472 --> 00:01:59,805
Mr. Huntington?

45
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:05,178
Well, Central Pacific Railroad
intends to build north.

46
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:10,186
Any, uh, misunderstanding on the part of
Mr. Young is regrettable and unintentional.

47
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:11,787
- (SCOFFS)
- I motion

48
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:15,462
that construction on
the Central Pacific's road

49
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:18,064
be suspended pending a full inquiry.

50
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,733
I would ask you, Mr. President,

51
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,373
uh, to consider how

52
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,475
Brigham Young acquired that map,

53
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:26,946
private property of
the Central Pacific Railroad.

54
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,682
Uh, Samuel Ammerman, my...

55
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,122
My telegraph operator, disappeared ages...

56
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:35,895
Ages ago after being placed
there by Thomas Durant to spy...

57
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:38,668
That is an unsubstantiated accusation, sir!

58
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:40,170
Private business of a private corporation!

59
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:41,738
Have not corporations rights, sir?

60
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:42,907
Now, surely, a...

61
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:45,345
A penalty for corporate
espionage must be levied.

62
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,416
"Corporate espionage." You
practically invented the concept!

63
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,385
Thomas Durant is undermining
your railroad, Mr. President.

64
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,653
(YELLS) Enough!

65
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:00,838
- Mr. Bohannon.
- Mr. President.

66
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:09,621
I promised the American people a railroad
that crosses this country, gentlemen.

67
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,659
It will be built.

68
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,061
If not by you, by someone else.

69
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:17,299
We will establish a route and a terminus,

70
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,105
a place where your two
railroads shall meet,

71
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:23,576
before any of us steps foot
outside Salt Lake City.

72
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,177
One hour recess.

Never mind.

You're here now.

81
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:31,432
Uh, we have lost Brigham's trust

82
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,136
and his workers with it.

83
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,239
Regrettable but not irreparable.

84
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:39,142
We're gonna strike back...

85
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,579
Hit Durant hard.

86
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:47,185
Listen to me. There is no way
Durant gives up Ogden.

87
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,254
He's lying to Brigham Young

88
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,656
just to keep the Mormon workers
on his payroll long as possible.

89
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,157
We catch him in a lie,

90
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:55,292
get Grant to give us Ogden

91
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:57,361
and its millions of dollars' worth of coal

92
00:04:57,395 --> 00:05:00,195
as penalty for Durant wasting our time.

93
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:03,299
Hmm?

00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:04,869

Mr. Bohannon! (CHUCKLES)

96
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:13,543
I'd heard Collis had
taken you under his wing.

97
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:17,513
I hope all this talk of
business and politics

98
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,416
doesn't prove too much of a bore for you.

99
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:22,020
No. You always keep things interesting.

Well, I...

103
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,629
I, uh, hardly recognize you.

104
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:36,398
BRIGHAM: We have Durant's support,

105
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:39,464
but only as long as
his interests align with ours.

106
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:40,767
He needs our workers,

107
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:44,237
but not as badly as I need his road.

108
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:51,375
Father, I've returned.

109
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,943
Yes, four days late,

110
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,180
and wearing unsightly boots.

111
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,520
Your brother and I are concerned
with pressing railroad matters.

112
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:00,487
The railroad is also my concern.

113
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:03,519
I pulled the men from Truckee
as you requested.

114
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:05,888
I've done your bidding, Father,
and I have a small request.

115
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:09,325
A quick one, I hope.

116
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:11,092
The Hatchites.

117

The heretic sect,
I need to know where they are.

118
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,364
What you needed was an awareness

119
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,168
of the treachery brewing
right under your nose

120
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,838
during your time on the Central Pacific!

121
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:21,407
Brother Phineas is...
Is not at fault, O Lion.

122
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,808
It was the gentiles,
in particular, Cullen Bo...

123
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,741
Don't defend this imbecile!

124
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,976
I'm perfectly aware were it not for you

125
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,477
our mission there would've
proved twice as disastrous.

126
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:32,347
You will not speak to me in this way!

127
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,126
Enough.

128
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:44,429
Get out of my sight.

129
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:50,773
Now!

130
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,550
Brother Phineas.

131
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:04,022
No. Brother Phineas...

132
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,458
No. It...

133
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:08,662
Do you see how he treats me?

134
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,862
I do, it is deplorable. Hmm.

135
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,017
- Our men are well-trained.
- Yeah.

136
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,435
- Well-armed.
- Yes.

137
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,936
- We have prepared for this.
- We have.

138
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,105
We must strike now.

139
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,206
- Yeah, he has so many well-armed guards...
- Phineas!

140
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,443
And now the soldiers.

141
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:31,978
No, Zion is better protected
than when we left.

142
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:33,547
Uh, now, we...

143
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:35,717
We must be patient. Huh?

144
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,085
Phineas, wait.

145
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:39,254
Ah! Hey, Cassius.

146
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:40,722
(CHUCKLES)

147
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:42,057
Oh, look at you.

148
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:44,095
The Hatchites are in the Red Valley,

149
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,694
southeast of Camp Douglas.

150
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,160
Couple hours ride from here.

151
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:50,630
Thank you, Cassius.

152
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,699
Welcome home, brother.

153
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,800
You see, yeah,

154
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,337
Heavenly Father continues to bestow upon us

155
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:06,172
his unpected blessings.

156
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:09,574
Uh, he will tell us when it is time.

157
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:12,579
I grow tired of waiting, Brother Thor.

158
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:14,947
Yeah, yeah. Uh, yeah. I see that.

159
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,417
I see that.

160
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:20,954

If only it was your own favors
I was paying for, Madam Eva.

but he said it didn't count,

Seven hundred dollars.

172
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,080
Our money.

173
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:52,288
Now, whoever's doing this
is stealing from all of us.

Oh, I'm looking at her.

- Quiet, Tess!

00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,674
I'm real scared.

179
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,711
(CHUCKLES) No, no, no.

180
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:12,982
You're too stupid to be scared.

181
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,883
Highfalutin on account of your
pretty face and your fast hands.

182
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,585
Don't forget, little girl,

183
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:25,825
I found you in a pile of pig slop

184
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,762
gnawing on a chicken bone.

185
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,699
You cross me,

186
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,167
you'll be back there
quicker than you can come.

187
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,572
That money'd best turn up.

188
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,341
Eva ain't fit to be running things.

189
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,676
That's the truth of it.

190
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,243
It's what I been saying, Mick.

191
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:50,311
She don't protect us from
johns when they get rowdy,

192
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:52,212
and now there's this money gone.

193
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:53,945
- Stolen?
- (SCOFFS)

194
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,946
All she can do to fix it is blame us.

195
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,317
You mean she blames you?

196
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:01,385
She's just got it in for me 'cause
all the girls like me better.

197
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:03,788
They listen to Josie. I've seen it.

198
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:08,526
And you think you could run the girls?

199
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,863
I could look out for 'em,
keep the cash safe.

200
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:15,436
Be happy to work alongside Johnny
here, you think that's best.

201
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,312
The route west and south
along the lake, Mr. President,

202
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,515
it crosses open country for thirty miles.

203
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,819
It has advantages both as to cost

204
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:41,986
and speed of progress.

205
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,356
As per federal law,

206
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:48,894
we will acquire the land

207
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:51,231
and mineral rights

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,570
twenty miles on either side
of the southern route,

209
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:57,572
precise numbers here.

210
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:03,149
Any questions, you may direct to the man

211
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:05,053
who made the survey for the Union Pacific

212
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:08,491
while he was in my employ, Cullen Bohannon.

213
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:12,562
I have some questions, Mr. President.

214
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:19,573
This is the route the Union
Pacific plans to follow, exactly?

215
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:23,243
Uh, saving room for any
necessary detours, yes.

216
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,614
Detours?

217
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:31,182
Unforeseen departures from the thing

218
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,450
you have committed yourself to doing.

219
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,487
I know you're familiar with the term.

220
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:39,286
I'm familiar with the route.
And having surveyed it myself,

221
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:41,190
I assure you it requires no detours.

222
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:43,724
(LAUGHS) Come, Bohannon.

223
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,163
Well, changes in the weather, uh,
(STUTTERS)

224
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:50,665
shortage of supplies...

225
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,466
Employees leaving.

226
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,133
Barring extenuating circumstances,

227
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,939
do you agree this route
requires no detours?

228
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:04,843
Barring extenuating circumstances.

229
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:07,849
Let the record show Mr.
Durant's nod in the affirmative.

230
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,553
I propose that we take a vote to lock in
the southern route through Salt Lake City,

231
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:14,790
and exclude any detours north,
including the coal fields

232
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:16,960
around Ogden.

233
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,563
Well, uh, Central Pacific is ready
to lock in the southern route,

234
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,763
as proposed by the Union Pacific.

235
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,099
Wise decision.

236
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,436
What do you say, Mr. Durant?
Will you make it unanimous?

237
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,138
Excluding Ogden is premature.

238
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:29,440
It's foolhardy.

239
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,277
Could I suggest that we...

240
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,146
(CLEARING THROAT) Mr. Durant,

241
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,315
Ogden is outside the straightest
route. The southern route.

242
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,484
Building to Ogden would constitute
a waste of federal funds.

243
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,016
(STUTTERS) A felony for which Mr. Durant

244
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,419
has already served time, if I'm
not mistaken, Mr. President.

245
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:46,555
Mr. Durant, you have two choices,

246
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:48,687
go south and forfeit Ogden,

247
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:50,756
or go north through Ogden.

248
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,592
I want your choice made now.

249
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:02,133
You force my hand, um...

250
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:09,271
The Union Pacific will have
to go north, through Ogden.

251
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,909
You lying heathen!

252
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:15,873
(CLEARS THROAT)

253
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,687
The northern route has been confirmed.

254
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,320
When we reconvene,

255
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,888
we shall settle on where
your two railroads would join

256
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:24,123
by naming a final terminus.

257
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:31,730
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

258
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:34,799
(SIGHS)

259
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,132
It's the ease with which you lie and steal

260
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,998
that truly impresses me.

261
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,169
Did you not hear me
fighting for you in there?

262
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:50,272
For Salt Lake City,
to the point of hoarseness?

263
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,573
(CHUCKLES)

264
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,911
The bone you have to pick
is with Cullen Bohannon,

265
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:55,783
the man who just saw to it

266
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:58,182
that the Transcontinental Railroad

267
00:14:58,217 --> 00:15:01,155
will bypass your fine, fecund city.

268
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:04,725
I need you to put Salt Lake
City back on the table.

269
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:09,332
Give me back your laborers

270
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,867
and I will order the immediate construction

271
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:15,873
of a glistening spur line
direct to Salt Lake City.

272
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:18,241
There, your... Your Zion resurrected!

273
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:21,743
The President's dream of
uniting this country by rail

274
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:23,710
will crumble to dust

275
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:26,043
without lumber from Mormon poplars,

276
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,545
sugar from Mormon beets,
flour from Mormon wheat,

277
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,612
and tools forged in Mormon fire.

278
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:36,650
Brigham, you and I both know

279
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,352
your Zion will die

280
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:43,124
without the influx of cash
a contract with me provides.

281
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,626
Now, you have a choice.

282
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:50,267
You can stomp your feet
like a petulant schoolgirl

283
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:55,212
or you can join me
in undoing Cullen Bohannon.

284
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,144
Salt Lake City is the terminus

285
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,479
or you can build your railroad alone.

286
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,258
Come. Come, come, come, please.

287
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,061
We propose Fort Bridger

288
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:30,160
as the final terminus of the railroad.

289
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:32,929
Edge of Wyoming, and that
fatuous double-dealer,

290
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:35,833
he won't even make it far enough
west to smell the coal in Ogden.

291
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,102
We ain't even through the Sierras.

292
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:39,571
Durant will see through it, so will Grant.

293
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:42,242
Well, Grant's never been to the
Sierras, and Durant neither.

294
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:44,443
Nobody knows for certain where we are...

295
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:45,578
Except you and me.

296
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:47,816
You know, put it on the map,
Grant will believe it.

297
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:56,427
I ain't lying to the President
of the United States.

298
00:16:59,164 --> 00:17:01,834
What's good for the railroad
is good for America.

299
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:03,905
We are patriots, Mr. Bohannon!

300
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:08,853
Do you know why I hired you?

301
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:12,016
To build your railroad.

302
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:16,790
Yeah, and also because Grant,

303
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:18,127
that old soldier,

304
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:20,665
holds you in higher regard
than the rest of us combined.

305
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:22,966
You call it (STUTTERING) a lie.

306
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,768
Call it a battlefield strategy...

307
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,974
But this... This, right here

308
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:29,278
is the very stuff of your lifetime.

309
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:33,616
Now you fancy yourself a railroad man...

310
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:37,885
Minute you accepted a stake
in the Central Pacific,

311
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,319
you became a tycoon.

312
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:45,555
And a tycoon always chooses the win...

313
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:49,391
No matter how he comes by it.

314
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:57,764
Pretty goddamn sure of yourself, ain't you?

315
00:17:57,798 --> 00:17:59,332
(LAUGHING)

316
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,436
I am. (GRUNTS)

317
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,373
It's a well that replenishes.

318
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:07,842
Time for you to drink from that same water.

319
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:10,979
Deliver this for me.

321
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,452
Josie's a whore.

322
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:24,257
Whores lie.

323
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:26,761
Well, Josie's running all over you
and all the other girls see it.

324
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:30,261
She came to me after your job.

325
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,596
(SCOFFS)

326
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:34,031
She's a nasty piece of work.

327
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:36,730
Running women is nasty business, sure.

328
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:39,862
They need to be kept in line. And
you let them away with too much.

329
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,465
My cousin favors the change.

330
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:51,462
We'd keep a place for you, of course.

331
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,500
Always room for a good whore.

332
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:59,468
I'll get the money back.

333
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:02,973
Pray that you do.

334
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:06,041
And get control of Josie and
the other girls, otherwise...

335
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:07,842
(MOUTHING) I will.

336
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:37,875
Well, your favorite brand, as I recall.

337
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,059
Ain't you got schemes to spin?

340
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:51,553
You know, it gives me no pleasure

341
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:54,222
to find us set against
each other, Bohannon.

342
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,527
I'm a little surprised, I will admit.

343
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,265
Given all your talk of "honor."

344
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,566
I joined the Central Pacific
to find my family.

345
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,199
The Union Pacific is your family.

346
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:07,170
It has been since the day you
bust into my rail car

347
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,436
and told me to hire you
instead of hanging you.

348
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:18,847
You regret your decision?

349
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:22,451
Not if you come home.

350
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:29,620
You don't owe that puny
shopkeeper Huntington anything.

351
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:32,357
He's using you.

352
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,996
He will ask you to misrepresent
the progress of the Central Pacific

353
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:39,865
to the President of the United States,

Now, under my compass,

535
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:19,246
the Union Pacific has laid
987 miles of tracks

536
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,413
across four states,

537
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:24,887
using half the amount of money,

538
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,757
work force, and supplies
as the Central Pacific.

539
00:33:29,193 --> 00:33:31,528
The Union Pacific would like to propose

540
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:35,430
the naming of Promontory, Utah,

541
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:40,999
385 miles west of Laramie, Wyoming,

542
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,235
as our terminus.

543
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:45,202
At three miles a day,

544
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:49,706
we will be there in less than
130 days from today.

545
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,439
Thank you, Mr. Durant. Mr. Huntington?

546
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:57,710
Mr. President, if it pleases
you, I'd like my partner, uh,

547
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,445
to deliver our case.

548
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:09,991
The Central Pacific will not be naming

549
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:12,927
Fort Bridger as the final
terminus here today.

550
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:15,764
Mr. Durant spoke true when he said

551
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:18,401
such a proposal would be
outside our capabilities.

552
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,707
But he is mistaken

553
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,578
in naming Promontory as the
proper terminus of this road.

554
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:31,049
Central Pacific wishes to propose
a more radical alternative,

555
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:33,184
one which has been considered
but not fully discussed

556
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:35,721
by the men in this room
over the last couple days.

557
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:39,892
We propose no terminus at all.

558
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:41,323
Mr. Bohannon, I...

559
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:43,860
But that both railroads follow
the agreed upon northern route,

560
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:45,562
bypassing Salt Lake City,

561
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,663
the point to be determined by the speed

562
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:49,163
with which each railroad builds.

563
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:50,996
Godless bastard!

564
00:34:51,397 --> 00:34:53,867
I second Mr. Young's objections!

565
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:57,636
Mr. Bohannon, the purpose of this
meeting was to set a final terminus.

566
00:34:57,671 --> 00:34:59,038
Mr. President,

567
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:03,942
not long ago, I took a
train ride after a long war.

568
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:08,344
And today, I sit here, in this room,

569
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:10,879
a stake-holder in
the Central Pacific Railroad.

570
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,115
And make no mistake about it,

571
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:15,650
the other men in this room are
driven by self-interest and greed.

572
00:35:15,685 --> 00:35:17,785
Greed for the coalfields in Ogden.

573
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:20,619
But Ogden's riches shouldn't go to the man

574
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:23,054
with the best speech
or the most devious lie.

575
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:31,101
This contest hadn't ought to end in a room.

576
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:35,274
Ogden should go to the man
who gets there first.

577
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:38,346
You said it yourself...

578
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:41,380
Nothing's ever off the table.

579
00:35:54,832 --> 00:35:55,965
You want a race?

580
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,408
(SCOFFS)

581
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:06,812
Yeah... Yeah, I want a race.

582
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:10,706
Then, Mr. Bohannon,

583
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:13,216
you shall have a race.

584
00:36:18,981 --> 00:36:21,181
I would be within reason to fire you.

585
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:25,468
Not if you aim to win this race.

586
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:33,510
Get us through that tunnel quick.

587
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:36,346
Thomas, as always...

588
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:37,416
No.

589
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:39,716
Collis, you don't stand a chance.

590
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,050
Oh, I think I do.

591
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:53,534
You know, starting a race from
behind a granite wall

592
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:56,036
is not going to make
for a very exciting finish.

593
00:36:57,271 --> 00:37:00,341
I was hoping for more of a fight from you.

594
00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:03,344
You've been an advocate of mine, Doc,

595
00:37:04,414 --> 00:37:06,685
but if you aim to beat me,
you should've ended this race

596
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,485
where you stood a chance of winning
it... Right here in this room.

597
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,587
The race we start tomorrow
will be decided in the mud.

598
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:14,192
Hell, I've... (SCOFFS)
I was born in the mud.

599
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:16,691
Tore a farm out of that mud.

600
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:19,662
Built an army out of more mud.

602
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:34,276
In one month, I'll punch
through the Sierras.

603
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,544
In two months, I'll be across Nevada.

604
00:37:36,577 --> 00:37:38,913
By year end, both railroads
will be at the Utah state line,

605
00:37:38,947 --> 00:37:41,251
and the last place you want to see me

606
00:37:41,286 --> 00:37:43,321
is at rail end building in your direction.
