(JOSEPH URGING HORSE ON)

1576
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:25,169
JOSEPH: Are you all right, Shannon?

1577
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:27,250
Are you all right?

1578
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:33,045
Go, Joseph. Go!

1579
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,399
Ride.

1580
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,443
SHANNON: Go get your land.

1582
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:11,451
You're not in Ireland anymore,
you arrogant bastard!

1583
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:17,324
Damn it, Shannon. Do you
want your land or don't you?

1584
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:21,645
(SHOUTING)

1585
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:41,850
This land is mine.

1586
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:44,763
Mine by destiny.

1587
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,479
Go ahead, Joseph!
Claim it!

1588
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:17,011
Shannon!

1589
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:18,519
Claim it?

1590
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:19,767
Stephen!

1591
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:22,249
SHANNON: Look out, Joseph!

1592
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,289
No! Joseph!

1593
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:39,808
SHANNON: Oh, my God! Joseph!

1594
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,719
Joseph!
Shannon?

1595
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,679
Joseph.
Don't touch him.

1596
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:46,519
Get away, Stephen.
Shannon, listen to me.

1597
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,085
Get away, Stephen.
Shannon...

1598
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:50,041
Leave!

1599
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:54,442
Joseph? Joseph.

1600
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:58,882
Joseph, look at me.
Look at me.

1601
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,567
No, don't move.
Stay still.

1602
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,121
Shannon.

1603
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,765
Don't do this.

1604
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,519
You've made your choice.

1605
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,768
Joseph, look at me.

1606
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:22,481
Look at me.
Look at me.

1607
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:25,039
Joseph, look at me.

1608
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:27,079
I feel myself dying.

1609
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:30,079
No. No, you stay looking at my eyes.
Look at my eyes, Joseph.

1610
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,199
Shannon?

1611
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:32,239
No, you're not dying.

1612
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:35,046
Look!
You've got your land.

1613
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:39,121
But all the land in the world
means nothing to me without you.

1614
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:40,961
Joseph...

1615
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,687
I tried to prove myself to you,

1616
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:52,926
but I know nothing
of books or alphabets

1617
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:56,729
or sun or moon or...

1618
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,091
All I know

1619
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,490
is Joseph loves Shannon.

1620
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:13,402
That's all that matters to me.

1621
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,799
Hey, Shannon.

1622
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,639
Joseph, Joseph, no.

1623
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:26,679
Shannon.

1624
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:28,848
No, no, stay with me.
Stay.

1625
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:30,765
Joseph, no!

1626
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:34,690
No. Joseph, look at me. Joseph!

1627
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:39,160
Joseph, please.
Please don't leave me.

1628
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:41,728
Please don't leave me alone.

1629
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,646
Joseph, Joseph, no!

1630
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:52,043
Joseph! Joseph, no!

1631
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:54,879
No!

1632
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:56,241
(CRYING) Please.

1633
02:11:58,280 --> 02:12:01,051
No. Please come back, please.

1634
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:03,368
Don't leave me.

1637
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:11,762
This is our dream together.

1638
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:15,041
I don't want this without you.

1639
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:25,571
I loved you.

1640
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:30,567
I loved you from the
first time I saw you.

1641
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:44,961
I often wondered about that.

1642
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:49,327
How? Joseph.

1643
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:53,559
You died.
You died!

You can be sure
I won't be dying twice.
