1
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:44,939
Let me light the lamp.

2
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,387
I’ve misplaced my boots.

3
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:50,990
I put them downstairs by the kitchen door.

4
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:57,284
I was asleep…when you took ‘em and did that.

5
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:02,004
Yes.  Would you rather I not?

6
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,170
No.

7
00:02:05,204 --> 00:02:14,355
No.  Only I had intended to be awake last night so
we could talk, which, what with how it’s been,

8
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,235
we have not done in the peace of the evening as I would like, since your arrival.

9
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,579
I would enjoy to converse in the stillness, after the day, like that.

10
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:30,092
Tonight, I will have two cups of coffee, and I will not fall asleep.

11
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,267
In the morning…

12
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:37,323
in the quiet before we each take up our work,

13
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:40,571
is also a pleasant occasion for such intercourse.

14
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:49,515
Yes.

15
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,363
Would you like to start a discussion this morning?

16
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:03,405
I wouldn’t…want to – disturb the boy.

17
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:07,725
William sleeps soundly.

18
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:14,203
If you will see to the bedroom door…Mr. Bullock?

19
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,653
Have I killed ‘im?

20
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:41,752
First, the dead don’t shiver.  And next, you just done what he asked.

21
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,460
Ain’t it more likely what turned him worse is underlyin’ woe

22
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:50,301
than a thumb up his ass attemptin’ his fucking relief?

23
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:52,764
Go on, get the fuck out of here.

24
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:58,949
It’s alright, Honey.

25
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:26,332
Hello.

26
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:28,492
What’s your business?

27
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:31,219
I’m Francis Wolcott.

28
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:35,916
My name’s Ellsworth, Mr. Francis Wolcott.  Can you hear me?

29
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,393
Yes, sir.  How do you do?

30
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:40,085
I’m well.  Glad you make me out.

31
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,841
Yes, sir.

32
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:45,236
Because them as poke around Miz Garret’s workings without a by-your-leave ain’t welcome,

33
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:49,327
Mr. Wolcott, and you ought not to repeat your fuckin’ mistake.

34
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:54,099
Well, that’s an uncivil response to an innocent error.

35
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:56,978
Did you work in the Comstock when you was beardless?

36
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:57,707
I did.

37
00:04:57,742 --> 00:05:01,759
For Mr. George Hearst, as a keen eye for the color?

38
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:07,177
As a geologist for Mr. Hearst.  Well, you have the advantage of me, Mr. Ellsworth.

39
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,599
That ain’t a possibility, Wolcott.

40
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:12,516
No more than an error of yours would be innocent.

41
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:19,373
I do dimly recall an Ellsworth—superintended the consolidated Virginia operations.

42
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:21,721
I don’t give a fuck what you recall.

43
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:26,153
A hero.  Dug a week without respite to save three poor souls from a cave-in.

44
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:30,094
And 46 corpses in a fucking hole that ought never to have been dug.

45
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,147
Always a choice…to count the saved or the lost.

46
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:35,966
Get off this property.

47
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:43,275
Just as a man opposed to inevitable change needn’t invariably be called a luddite,

48
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,162
another choice might be simply to describe him as slow in his processes.

49
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:52,024
You tell that cocksucker you work for the next surrogate he sends

50
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,335
oughtn’t to be bloodied from the Comstock.

51
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:04,691
The noise is terrible, isn’t it, Mr. Ellsworth?  Like fate.

52
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,793
“Ox, Box, Fox.”

53
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:20,662
Nora’s attentions are wandering.  If I were you,

54
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:22,485
I’d bribe her with candy.

55
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,150
Good Morning.

56
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,932
Please come in, Miss Isringhausen.

57
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:41,815
Will you have a seat?

58
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,537
Do you remain of a mind, Ma’am, to dispense with my services?

59
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:53,590
I have immense respect for your training and intelligence, Miss Isringhausen,

60
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,794
and gratitude for your efforts toward Sophia’s education.

61
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:04,277
I am ill suited temperamentally to collaborate
with you as women in our positions must do.

62
00:07:04,312 --> 00:07:05,605
I see.

63
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,907
I propose to pay you six months’ wages severance and an additional $200

64
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:15,112
against the expense for your journey here and return to Chicago.

65
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:16,287
While you’re making your arrangements,

66
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:19,772
I will also continue to pay for your room here at the hotel.

67
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,240
As to those terms, Mrs. Garret, your behavior is very fair.

68
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:29,303
Miss Isringhausen, Cotton Mather would have found hard

69
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:34,357
and joyless the standards you so resolutely apply to me and Sophia,

70
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:36,514
and of course to yourself.

71
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:43,911
I wish you very well.

72
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,315
Thank you, Madam.

73
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,073
Would you

74
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:50,473
I will not say goodbye to Sophia, to spare her upset.

75
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:02,429
Dan.

76
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:05,458
E.B.  Coffee?

77
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:06,672
Please.

78
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:15,974
I’ll be candid, Dan.  I did not sleep well last night.

79
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:18,057
I heard screaming from Al’s room.

80
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:20,786
Happens up ‘ere many a fuckin’ evenin’.

81
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:22,529
Well, Al was fuckin’ screamin’, Dan.

82
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:25,112
And I’m wondering how he’s feeling this morning.

83
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:29,621
And you dancin’ around the pole ain’t allayin’ my fucking anxieties.

84
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:31,932
Well, do you hear any screams from him now?

85
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:33,901
Silence ain’t proof either way.

86
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:35,756
Take no tongue with me, E.B.,

87
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,537
or I’ll slap you fuckin’ silly!

88
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:45,958
He’s on the mend, and he ain’t fuckin’ receiving.

89
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,701
Well, that’s all I was fuckin’ askin’.

90
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,988
Then that’s your fuckin’ answer.

91
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:51,112
Convey my joy.

92
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:55,353
And tell him numerous scores await.

93
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,867
Soft-fuckin’ day, Dan.

94
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:15,843
Morning, Crop Ear.  Oh—sorry—Eamon.

95
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:18,686
Take a good look.  Ain’t growin’ back.

96
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,415
Is he about?

97
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,225
Uh…Al’s out early.  Look at a place in Gayville.

98
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,614
Oh, yeah?

99
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,818
You must seize fortune by the forelock, Dan.

100
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:35,508
That’s why I’m here, to put a matter before him.

101
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,174
You know I’ll not waste the man’s time.

102
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,579
No, you won’t.

103
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:41,039
That’s some fuckin’ way you have about you, Dan.

104
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:43,122
Now, you could either say your piece to me and Johnny,

105
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:45,660
or you can-get-the-fuck-outta here.

106
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:48,956
I’ll say it gladly, and hope you’ll commend my words to him

107
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:51,948
who’s in Gayville at the earliest opportunity.

108
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,297
I contemplate a piece of activity.

109
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:58,699
I need to organize some reliable fellows,
locate a right place to waylay that metal.

110
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:00,707
Well, I’ll let him know.

111
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:05,033
25%.  One full quarter of the proceeds in total go to

112
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:08,822
Al Swearengen, the Gem Saloon,

113
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:12,390
or you and Johnny as the fucking case may be.

114
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:16,559
You may need to clean the wax out of your
holes, because I said I will let him know.

115
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:20,345
When do you suppose I could expect a favor of a response?

116
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,193
Tomorrow afternoon.

117
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:25,994
He’s overnight in Gayville then?

118
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,579
Then tomorrow afternoon it is.

119
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,682
Gettin’ particular of where he was gone, I realize now,

120
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:41,546
it was a fuckin’ mistake, which happened because I’m so fuckin’ upset.

121
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:44,348
From this point forward, I’ll handle that earless cunt.

122
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:49,115
Top two bags.

123
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:05,329
May I help you with your bags, Miss?

124
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:09,385
No, you can’t.  Or look at me or talk to me until I’ve took a bath.

125
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,530
Well, follow the quagmire then, Ma’am.

126
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:14,232
The establishment you want is the last on the right.

127
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,957
Take this lady’s luggage to the Chez Amie.

128
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:18,232
Yes, sir.

129
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:21,049
Do not look at her or talk to her until she’s bathed.

130
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:31,293
Mr. Wolcott.

131
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:37,582
Deceptively fair weather given the devastating rumors.

132
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:41,560
Less volume, Mr. Farnum.  More conviction.

133
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:42,582
Yes.

134
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:45,273
Your hotel?

135
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:46,676
Yes, it is, sir.

136
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:48,985
Your luggage?

137
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,819
Yes.

138
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:51,941
May I install it in one of our better rooms?

139
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:56,902
Please.  Uh, direct me to the Bella Union.

140
00:11:56,937 --> 00:12:06,143
Not 50 yards as the bird flies, or a man is lead
on by his prick, or needing to test his luck.

141
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:08,228
To whom shall I assign the room?

142
00:12:08,263 --> 00:12:09,896
Hugo Jarry.

143
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:13,039
E.B Farnum, owner-proprietor.

144
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:17,016
Also mayor, though that position is largely ceremonial.

145
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:21,524
Lawrence County Commissioner.  The position is real.

146
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,704
Hello, Jarry.  Commissioner Jarry.

147
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:32,630
Commissioner Jarry now, yes, as of the last five days.

148
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,940
Delighted to find you here, Adams.

149
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,839
You could have known my next whereabouts
if you had talked to me in Yankton,

150
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:41,188
where I sat outside your office for half a fuckin’ day.

151
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:42,177
It seemed

152
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:47,931
to many of us in Yankton that in the aftermath
of Magistrate Clagett’s disappearances,

153
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:50,099
you chose different companions.

154
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:54,645
Last I saw Clagett, he rode in here with General Crook.

155
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,320
I figured he left with him, too.

156
00:12:56,355 --> 00:13:00,715
And perhaps was plucked up subsequently
from amidst the troops by savages?

157
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,979
Yes, such moonlight treachery being their stealthy hallmark.

158
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:11,094
Maybe he took a bribe from someone, didn’t
hold up his end, got his just desserts.

159
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,292
That’s of no personal interest to me

160
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:18,631
or anyone in Yankton, any more than your choice of companions.

161
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,986
If you’re trying to freeze out Swearengen before the Governor makes his play,

162
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:25,144
You are bettin’ the wrong way.

163
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,151
Someone certainly is.

164
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:30,032
Anyways, I’ll tell him I saw you.

165
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:34,464
I have a close schedule, otherwise, I’d pay the respects myself.

166
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:39,729
I wonder if you will let me pass.

167
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:54,065
I only hope, Marvin, you ain’t privy to information that I ain’t.

168
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,181
$600 U.S. Dollars, Mr. Tolliver.  Claim 16 above Discovery.

169
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:02,977
That ain’t responsive to my previous fuckin’ statement, young man.

170
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:06,767
I tell you what, sir.  It’s the fuckin’ altitude that’s got to me.

171
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:07,939
I see.

172
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:10,144
Nosebleeds and every fucking thing else.

173
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,227
Well, your health’s got to come first.
Leon!

174
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:21,855
Light as my kit’s got, we can go ahead and say done.

175
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,896
$600, Con.

176
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,259
Right here, sir.

177
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:38,517
Jesus Christ, don’t pay it to me, Marvin here will shoot us both!

178
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:41,709
Here you go, Marvin.

179
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:43,073
You lettered, Marvin?

180
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:46,293
I’m up to making my “X”, Sir.

181
00:14:46,328 --> 00:14:48,073
Con you sign as witness.

182
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:49,589
Will do, Sir.

183
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:53,229
Don’t be lookin’ over my shoulder when I’m signin’ my fuckin’ X!

184
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:00,655
Don’t ever say that to me again.  You surprised yourself.

185
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,942
It’s what happened.

186
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:05,277
I don’t want to hear it spoken of, because it darkens my thoughts.

187
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:08,951
About who you’re partnered with?

188
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:10,770
Exactly.

189
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:17,362
They get led by their dicks.  Our cunts lead us, we lose our only edge.

190
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:19,181
That wasn’t what was going on.

191
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:23,395
Was it worse?  Were you angry at him, Joanie?

192
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,023
Was that what surprised you,

193
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:31,576
How angry you were that George Hearst’s
second was a cruel and evil man?

194
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:39,563
Did you think maybe you’d shoot him to get us little people even?

195
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:43,199
I took that gun into the room with me to protect myself.

196
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,267
Who fuckin’ asked you to go into the room with him?

197
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:50,480
Nobody gets even.  We get dead.

198
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:54,078
And before I go, I intend a long and comfortable retirement,

199
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:56,692
and that cocksucker’s gonna pay the freight.

200
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:59,799
Something terrible is going to happen here.

201
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:05,589
You don’t even know the girl—he wants to harm.

202
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,187
You stay the fuck out of it.

203
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:19,861
He tipped you! This whole place smells like shit.

204
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:32,697
It is no disloyalty to be a realist, Richardson, we are mortal.

205
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:37,772
One hopes for the best.  One perseveres.

206
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:43,529
One reevaluates constantly.  One is an asshole if one doesn’t.

207
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,645
Loyalty expanded is not loyalty betrayed.

208
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,546
I contemplate no disloyalty to Al Swearengen.

209
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:05,141
I feel exposed.  I don’t like being weak, and I know that I am.

210
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:10,110
I yearn to rely on a stronger will.

211
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:16,511
I fear what I’m capable of in it’s absence.

212
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:28,402
Whereas you, Richardson, know nothing of yourself.

213
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:33,058
Are you shitting or going blind?  Or on foot or horseback?

214
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:37,226
You vile fucking lump!

215
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:44,124
Bury that offal in the Shepherd’s Pie.

216
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:52,495
Oh, God damn it.

217
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,639
May I go up today?

218
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,088
Unh-uh.

219
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,418
How long is my fuckin’ sentence?

220
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:03,427
Any messages?

221
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:07,746
Is there any fuckin’ chance you and me don’t end up in blood?

222
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:11,911
Any of you realizin’ that the sun don’t rise and set on me and you?

223
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:13,769
What the fuck does that fuckin’ mean?

224
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:17,897
Means there may be other fuckin’ factors factored into my decision-making.

225
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:21,041
Besides the fact that I find you to be a pain in the balls, personally.

226
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:29,146
Please report – Commissioner Jarry from Yankton has
arrived to the camp and intends to fuck Al up the ass.

227
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,154
Said he to you while doin’ the same?

228
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:42,783
It is important that he hear that.  You do him disservice not to tell.

229
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:53,777
Listen, Adams.  Al is fucked up bad.  May be dyin’.

230
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:56,384
Jesus.

231
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:02,047
Goddamn right, Jesus.  Them stones have
done plumb blocked off his piss passage.

232
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:06,856
Fuck.  Okay, Alright.

233
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:10,463
It’s  all backed up in him.  Hey, shit, he’s got piss in his lungs.

234
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:11,639
Can he talk?

235
00:19:11,674 --> 00:19:16,941
Fuck no, he can’t talk.  He just lays there and shivers and stares at nothin’.

236
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:21,903
Uh, he screams when Doc abuses him
with them fuckin’ prick poles of his.

237
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:26,910
Sorry I broke your balls.

238
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:30,091
Well, I’ll see to it he gets your news

239
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,972
if he gets to a point I think he can understand my meanin’.

240
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:41,043
Listen, how uh – how’s your little buddy, the one I put the beatin’ on.

241
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:42,112
Hawkeye.

242
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,067
Yeah, Hawkeye.

243
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:45,378
He’ll live.

244
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:53,195
It’s something anyway.

245
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:01,873
Mornin’, Ma’am.

246
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,690
Good morning, Mr. Ellsworth.

247
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:06,986
I’m sorry I’m late.  I hope you spent a restful night.

248
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:10,092
I did.  And you’re forgiven.

249
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,790
But this morning, I note an amount of confusion…

250
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:22,932
and anxiety abound, and words of panic
about Yankton’s disposition of the claims.

251
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:26,343
Panic’s easier on the back than the short-handled shovel.

252
00:20:27,524 --> 00:20:28,508
I see.

253
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:35,724
The creator, in his infinite wisdom, Miz Garret,

254
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:42,235
salted his works so that where gold was, there also you’d find rumor.

255
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,505
Though, he decreed just as firm that the opposite wouldn’t always hold.

256
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:53,801
You understand I needn’t be comforted at the expense of the truth.

257
00:20:53,836 --> 00:21:00,197
I’m late, Ma’am, over shooin’ a man away
from your diggin’s named Frances Wolcott,

258
00:21:00,232 --> 00:21:02,631
that scouts for George Hearst,

259
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:09,427
who wouldn’t spare attention for a camp or the
sun itself if he didn’t think it likely to fill his coffers.

260
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:15,247
Nor the sort’d shrink from a lie, or more than one, to advance his purpose,

261
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:21,638
or be ignorant or of how to circulate his falsehoods
without anyone knowin’ their source.

262
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:29,915
And now I come to camp to hear the waters
called muddy and the current quickened,

263
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,552
though I see no change in the creek.

264
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:39,373
And the “Hooples,” certain sure that flood crest fast approaches,

265
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:46,089
have begun to think keenly, “I’ll get ahead of the event.

266
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:49,403
Maybe I’ll sell my claim at discount.”

267
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:54,300
Anything to unharness so they can head for the higher ground.

268
00:21:54,335 --> 00:22:00,907
Myself, Ma’am, I’d be bettin’ that the levy’ll hold.

269
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:13,282
Did you speak of it to Mr. Bullock, Mama?

270
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:15,148
Not yet, William.

271
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,010
Will you speak of it today?

272
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,721
Good morning, Mr. Bullock.

273
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,399
Good morning.

274
00:22:23,414 --> 00:22:27,596
Oatmeal…Seth?

275
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:31,638
Please…Martha.

276
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:34,814
Mr. Bullock, mother was wantin’ a kitchen garden,

277
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:36,643
which I would have care of.

278
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:39,438
Have you chosen a spot yet?

279
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:41,844
I paced one out in the back of the house, sir.

280
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:47,887
Yesterday, I would have broken the ground, but from wantin’ the tools.

281
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:51,564
Would you like to go now and tell Mr. Star you need shovel, hoe and a rake?

282
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,558
Yes, sir.

283
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:55,310
Do you recall your way to the hardware store?

284
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:59,163
I do, sir.  Is it okay if I go now, mama?

285
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,610
Mrs. Garret.

286
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:31,549
Mr. Farnum.

287
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:48,130
Mrs. Garret?  What male would not trade our small superiority of intellect

288
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:54,758
to possess that gift of intuition so bountifully bestowed on the lesser sex?

289
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:57,044
Mr. Farnum, your meaning is beyond me.

290
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:01,142
I imagine you, Madam, awakening the other morning,

291
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:06,655
suddenly and for no earthly reason, convinced the camp was at peril.

292
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:13,258
”My gold should be spirited to Denver,” I imagine you thinking,

293
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:15,149
maybe as you brushed your hair,

294
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:21,422
and without worrying the conviction or
studying upon it, sending the gold away.

295
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:29,066
At peril?  Mr. Farnum, the camp?  Oh, your meaning is beyond me.

296
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:37,564
Ma’am, if a Nubian genie were at my disposal,

297
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:43,126
I’d see his great nigger fingers whisk up my hotel and deposit it in Denver,

298
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:44,633
just as you did your gold.

299
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:48,204
Because the camp’s at peril?

300
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:53,757
Yes, Madam, yes.  Peril. And worse than peril.

301
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,791
Perhaps you should sell.

302
00:24:57,826 --> 00:25:02,844
Mrs Garret, had I your intuition, would I not have done.

303
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:07,286
I’ll buy it.

304
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:13,130
Aren’t you wonderful and kind and intuitive and generous.

305
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:17,227
No, I couldn’t burden you nor impose upon your generosity,

306
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:19,413
tremendously wealthy as you are.

307
00:25:21,512 --> 00:25:26,240
Name your price, Mr. Farnum.  We’ll close the transaction now.

308
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,748
Madam, now you unsettle and trifle with me.

309
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:32,642
Ungh—and make me nervous and uncertain.

310
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:36,713
My intention is quite otherwise, and intuition.

311
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:38,735
Oh, your intuition?

312
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:41,277
Name your price.

313
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:46,744
How do you males put it…”Shit or get off the chamber pot?”

314
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,867
Oh, Mrs. Garret—shit, indeed.  Oh dear.

315
00:25:49,902 --> 00:25:51,968
Unless, Mr. Farnum…

316
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,172
Unless, what, Madam?  Do you reconsider?

317
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:57,349
No, no.

318
00:25:57,384 --> 00:26:00,274
I’d understand. It’s your sex’s prerogative

319
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:04,768
Unless, I meant to say, you’re lying about the camp’s peril?

320
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:06,264
Lying? I?

321
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,150
But why would you do that?

322
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:10,450
Exactly.

323
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:14,693
You will make a price for me then.

324
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:17,165
Let me…consider, Mrs. Garret.

325
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,123
Don’t, Mr. Farnum.  Trust your instincts.

326
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:26,464
I’ll have you in a dress in no time.

327
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:37,674
Miserable, haughty, cunt.  Putting me beyond my depth.

328
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:43,155
We’ve come to a crisis, Al, and I have to say my piece.

329
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:50,273
The stones can be excised surgically in one of two ways…

330
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,561
The so-called “High Method,”

331
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:58,193
which cuts into the bladder from above your
penis, and the other which enters from below.

332
00:26:58,228 --> 00:26:59,705
Below what, Doc?

333
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,034
His balls.

334
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:05,941
So the “low” entails cutting through his ‘tain’t.

335
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:13,262
Now, I have seen the high method performed.

336
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:17,664
I assisted at a closing, afterwards discussed it with the surgeon.

337
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:20,879
Come to it, that is the one that I would prefer.

338
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:24,413
Al’s with you.

339
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:25,839
Well, how’d he indicate it?

340
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:31,721
A hard blink for the upper and a scowl for cutting through his ‘tain’t.

341
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:40,593
With a knife in expert hands, two men in 10 survive the procedure we contemplate.

342
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:48,785
But at what point, without intervention, will your
condition so worsen as to put you beyond recovery?

343
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,059
I believe we have approached that point.

344
00:27:51,094 --> 00:27:56,828
I am not an expert, but I will give it my best effort,

345
00:27:56,863 --> 00:28:01,428
and I ask you now for your consent, should we need to proceed.

346
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:05,005
He’s with you , Doc.  He wants the upper.
Hey, that’s it.  That’s the final call.

347
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,909
Right, Al? The upper?

348
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:12,849
He wants the upper.  Well, I guess you better go make ready.

349
00:28:12,884 --> 00:28:19,683
All right.  All right. Come with me, Johnny.
Help me with the stove.

350
00:28:19,718 --> 00:28:21,360
Sure.  Sure, Doc.

351
00:28:39,495 --> 00:28:42,929
As to claims filed and worked prior to the new treaty

352
00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:46,143
in essence from when the hills still belonged to the Sioux

353
00:28:46,178 --> 00:28:49,190
the presumption of legitimacy will apply,

354
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:52,026
subject to qualification, according to mitigating facts.

355
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:56,326
In short, with no controlling principle being invoked,

356
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:59,672
title will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

357
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:00,928
When claims are overturned,

358
00:29:00,963 --> 00:29:03,877
new title will be awarded at said prices,

359
00:29:03,912 --> 00:29:07,927
via lottery, to those submitting verified offers.

360
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:12,865
I only hope territorial officials will be excluded from eligibility.

361
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,481
Yes.

362
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:18,573
Better tell your friends and relatives to pick
their lucky suits out for that drawing.

363
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:21,189
Only after Mr. Wolcott’s have picked out theirs.

364
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:28,012
Of course, anticipation of the forthcoming judicial
holding may itself largely cleanse the market.

365
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:31,639
It’s always preferable to allow the market to operate unimpeded.

366
00:29:31,674 --> 00:29:40,719
Would that argue for allowing word of my presence
to circulate a bit before presenting myself officially?

367
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:44,197
Man might use that time to put some stink on his Johnson.

368
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,044
Hello?

369
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,864
Down here.  Behind the counter.

370
00:29:57,032 --> 00:30:00,038
Taking inventory.

371
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:06,992
I can’t do a lesson today.

372
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:08,675
All right.

373
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,839
He’s too sick.  Maybe he’ll fuckin’ die.

374
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:15,445
But I can’t stay.

375
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:23,985
But it’d be smart to stay and learn to calculate
fuckin’ interest on that accommodation paper

376
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,293
and those fucking discount notes and whatever the fuck

377
00:30:28,723 --> 00:30:29,866
Another time.

378
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,318
It’s fine, Trixie.

379
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,005
Did I hurt your shoulder?

380
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,213
No.

381
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,480
I gotta go.

382
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:52,900
Want to go out for a bit?

383
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:59,239
She says Swearengen’s bad off.  Last night
I heard him screaming out again and again.

384
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,673
I guess he’s…worsened with the day.

385
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:10,507
Thanks for outfittin’ the boy with garden equipment.

386
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:14,223
Oh, he’s planning to take some prizes come harvest fair.

387
00:31:14,258 --> 00:31:16,567
He mentioned corn and squash both.

388
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:19,308
I had some news from Denver…

389
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:22,548
concerning our proposal on the bank.

390
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:26,680
We’d need to find 15% of our proposed capitalization.

391
00:31:26,715 --> 00:31:28,791
If we capitalize at the two million we figured on

392
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:31,526
$300,000 separate from what Denver will underwrite.

393
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:36,206
Or they’d credit Mrs. Garret’s accounts as collateral.

394
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:37,432
Not doing that.

395
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:41,509
I don’t advocate it.  I’m informing you
of a communication they volunteered.

396
00:31:41,544 --> 00:31:42,655
We’re not doing that.

397
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,001
Suppose I’ll have to dip into my own kit then.

398
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:48,711
Even so, it’s back to cutting my own hair.

399
00:31:48,746 --> 00:31:50,581
I’ll take the idea around.

400
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:52,686
Swearengen’d put it up.

401
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:54,346
Fucking reputable people.

402
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:59,357
If money had to be clean before it was recirculated,
we’d still be living in fucking caves.

403
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:00,697
Your old man?

404
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:02,856
Me.

405
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:09,392
Mr. Lee will provide opium to you exclusively 
for sale to whites in the camp.

406
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:13,295
You will receive 50% of the gaming proceeds from Celestial’s Alley.

407
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,348
My men will lamp the take.

408
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:21,317
It will spare Mr. Lee here explaining how slow business
was ‘cause of Buddha’s wedding anniversary.

409
00:32:21,352 --> 00:32:25,743
Your men lamp the take—also on proceeds from Celestial prostitutes.

410
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,503
How many do you want?

411
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:29,067
How many can you bring?

412
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:32,555
How many?

413
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,191
That- that sounds like a man with an inexhaustible supply.

414
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:40,464
How much English do you have, my friend?

415
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:46,361
Maybe when we get to know each other better.

416
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:50,238
I’ll take a dozen, and I don’t want ‘em fucked out.

417
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:52,540
I set the rates.  The upkeep’s on him.

418
00:32:52,575 --> 00:32:55,350
And my understanding is the upkeep is quite minimal.

419
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:59,396
Good!  Gives him more to spend on Mah-Jongg.

420
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:06,275
I won’t question the apparent one-sidedness of our arrangement.

421
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,279
Uh, the arrangement is not yours and Mr. Lee’s alone.

422
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:13,293
Yes, and in ways that I don’t understand,

423
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:17,271
it must benefit you and the man whose name I must never say,

424
00:33:17,306 --> 00:33:22,686
to have Mr. Lee in camp…and perhaps Mr. Wu out of it,

425
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:26,556
maybe among the spirits of his ancestors.

426
00:33:27,491 --> 00:33:31,352
But what a blessing for me, finally to reach a point in life where…

427
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:33,427
I don’t feel I have to know.

428
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:42,731
A creature walking ‘round on hind legs.

429
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:49,073
Just like crop ear and them half-dozen bushwhackers out in the forest,

430
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:55,737
ones I’d fall in with or out—whatever suited my daily purpose.

431
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:01,444
That’s what I was till I crossed paths with Al.

432
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,877
Well, bang the drum and play the 
pipes and I’ll rend our fuckin’ garments.

433
00:34:08,412 --> 00:34:09,625
I was just sayin’. 

434
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,825
I ain’t hearin’ confessions this afternoon.

435
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:23,466
Say you’ll burn it down with me, Dan.

436
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:25,235
What?

437
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:33,011
This fuckin’ place – before letting Tolliver take it over.

438
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:37,625
Done.

439
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,974
Well, open your mouth, Jewel, and say
somethin’ we can’t fuckin’ understand!

440
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:53,303
He’s asking for you.

441
00:34:56,021 --> 00:34:59,268
Don’t die with your fucking secret.

442
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:07,316
Clean the number three.  Dolly said she bled.

443
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:16,190
God damn it.

444
00:35:19,402 --> 00:35:22,211
I may get me a whiskey, Doc.  You want a whiskey?

445
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:25,683
No, I do not want a fucking whiskey.

446
00:35:25,718 --> 00:35:29,241
Well, maybe as far as steadyin’ the hand.

447
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:34,494
How dare you?  You shut your fucking mouth!

448
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:36,465
I didn’t mean nothin’ by it.

449
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,815
Whiskey does not steady the hand.

450
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:45,489
It just dulls the worry over the hand’s unsteadiness.

451
00:35:45,524 --> 00:35:50,825
Jesus Christ!  Jesus Christ, I do not need to kill another man!

452
00:35:57,912 --> 00:36:00,141
Top left corner of my fucking bag.

453
00:36:00,176 --> 00:36:01,172
What?

454
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:06,411
Balm, you fucking idiot, against the burn you fucking just sustained.

455
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:10,300
Thanks, Doc.

456
00:36:11,623 --> 00:36:12,976
Alright.

457
00:36:25,326 --> 00:36:26,271
Dahn!

458
00:36:26,306 --> 00:36:27,906
Go away, Wu.

459
00:36:27,941 --> 00:36:29,033
Swedgin.

460
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:30,019
No.

461
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,038
Swed-gin!

462
00:36:32,073 --> 00:36:33,807
Well, it ain’t gonna happen.

463
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:34,586
Swedgin!

464
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:37,487
No, Wu!  He’s fucked up.

465
00:36:37,522 --> 00:36:40,570
Now, Al can’t talk to you right now, and I can’t understand you,

466
00:36:40,605 --> 00:36:41,911
so you go the fuck back to chink alley!

467
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:43,070
Diu na Ma ga hai! Nei go Bok Gwai Lo!
(Loosely translated: Fuck your mother! You white cocksucker!)

468
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,740
Do not start drawing air to talk gibberish to me!

469
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:52,837
Cocksuckah.

470
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:55,027
Oh, fer Christ’s sake.

471
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:56,576
Cocksuckah!

472
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:58,396
It’s wasted on me, Wu.

473
00:36:58,431 --> 00:37:00,666
mmm—cocksuckah! Cocksuckah!

474
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:04,607
I—I—I don’t get it, Wu.  I am not as smart as Al.

475
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:07,397
And there’s too much on our fuckin’ plate right now to deal with it.

476
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:08,347
Cocksuckah!

477
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:10,826
Cocksuckah!  San Francisco.

478
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:11,987
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

479
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:17,010
All right, there’s a-there’s an invisible cocksucker
next to you, and he’s from San Francisco.

480
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:17,973
Hou!

481
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:19,144
Cocksuckah!

482
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:21,256
San Francisco cocksuckah!

483
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:24,588
I-I’m going with you—you want me to tall Al that there’s a cocksucker

484
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:24,995
he looks like

485
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:31,760
he looks like you, and he’s from San Francisco and he’s got your dander up.

486
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:33,168
I’m going up now.  I’ll go tell him.

487
00:37:33,203 --> 00:37:34,227
Tell him what?

488
00:37:34,262 --> 00:37:35,404
Oh, God only knows.

489
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:40,667
Why don’t you learn to talk American!  Save us all a lot of fucking trouble!

490
00:37:40,702 --> 00:37:44,869
Wu no Englishee!  Bok Gwai Lo!  Swedgin!

491
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,561
Mr. Adams?  Good day.

492
00:37:56,896 --> 00:37:59,003
Good day, Miss Isringhausen.

493
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,358
I can’t imagine what you must be thinking at the moment.

494
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:06,342
Please, come in.

495
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:19,574
I can offer you a whiskey or – water that I just washed my face in.

496
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:21,432
I will have whiskey, Sir.

497
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:22,697
Sure.

498
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:29,915
I’ve just been discharged.  Sacked.

499
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,086
By Mrs. Garret?

500
00:38:32,121 --> 00:38:34,947
As tutor for her ward.

501
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:43,772
Well, I hope you punched her in the nose.

502
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:51,257
This is a day of firsts.

503
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:56,113
Dismissal from employment, unchaperoned presence in a man’s room.

504
00:38:56,148 --> 00:38:59,469
I’m sorry for your news, Miss Isringhausen,

505
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,095
but if that’s your first taste of liquor,

506
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,504
I’m sorry for the hand you’ve been playing your whole life.

507
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:11,795
You mind if I drink from the bottle?

508
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,253
No, Sir.

509
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:21,354
Oh boy.

510
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:25,053
Oh boy.

511
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,368
I’m sorry

512
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:28,851
You want me to get outta here?

513
00:39:28,886 --> 00:39:30,377
It’s your room.

514
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:35,125
That’s okay.  You’re not a thief.  Or would you feel better if I shot myself?

515
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:39,856
Why do you say that?

516
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:44,850
I apologize.  It-it was just a stupid way of trying to be funny.

517
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:49,121
Because I fear I may be killed.

518
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:51,456
What?

519
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:57,228
I can’t explain -- It’s nightmarish.  It’s incomprehensible.

520
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:59,381
Who’s threatening your life?

521
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,505
Mrs. Garret.

522
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,584
I know it sounds impossible, but I can testify to you, Mr. Adams,

523
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:11,742
I would not be the first person she’s killed.

524
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:18,444
You want I should tie him high or tie him low?

525
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:20,271
Tie him high.

526
00:40:20,306 --> 00:40:23,737
Should we go ahead and put a good fuckin’ hit of dope down him, Doc?

527
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:26,654
Yeah, go ahead and get a hit ready.

528
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:30,659
Al, I have to secure you for surgery!

529
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,449
What is it, Al?

530
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:41,307
He’s afraid.

531
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,560
You afraid, Al?

532
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:49,282
Ah—you’ve got a fear of the knife.

533
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:51,746
He wants to try passin’ them stones natural.

534
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:54,497
Are you afraid, Al?

535
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,338
Are you afraid, Al?

536
00:40:56,373 --> 00:41:00,177
Oh God!  I’m on his fucking nuts!

537
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:05,509
Goddamn smelling salts is what we’re goin’ to administer!

538
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:07,029
Do you here me, Al?

539
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:10,173
Here is a fucking dose

540
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,905
of smelling salts to your nose!

541
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,042
What are you doing, Doc?!

542
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:18,752
Be quiet!  Sit him up and get him to his goddamn feet!

543
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,589
Take his prick out!

544
00:41:21,624 --> 00:41:24,995
Come on! Come on!

545
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,522
There you come, Al!  There you come!

546
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:31,947
There you go!  You’re doin’ it!

547
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:35,929
There you go, you ox-minded son of a gun!

548
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:39,897
Push at it, you bastard!  Push at it!

549
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:40,559
Come on, Al!

550
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:43,750
You’d do a horse proud with the strength of that fuckin’ stream!

551
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:46,770
Lay him down.  Lay Al down on the bed!

552
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:50,129
We are gonna take care of this.

553
00:41:50,164 --> 00:41:53,540
I’m gonna put this instrument back inside you

554
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:55,999
and clear that cocksucker you’ve been making progress with,

555
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:58,154
and we are not gonna cut you!

556
00:41:58,189 --> 00:42:00,388
Bring his knee up to his chest.

557
00:42:00,423 --> 00:42:03,400
You hold him down.  Johnny, you…
go on out to the balcony.

558
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:05,366
I have charge of the salts!

559
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:07,619
Alright

560
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,579
Alright!

561
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:15,848
I can feel the fucking click of the gleet!

562
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:21,666
Alright, now I want you to milk his prick from top to bottom,

563
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:23,971
and I want you to bring that cocksucker down.

564
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:25,183
That’s it.  Now.

565
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:28,004
Come on, Al.

566
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,377
Alright!  Look at it!

567
00:42:30,412 --> 00:42:33,618
One gleet chasing a-fucking-nother!  God

568
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:37,901
God bless you, Al!  Thank you.

569
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:41,385
Thank you for saving me, God…

570
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:54,954
Are you uncomfortable, Girls?

571
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,745
They’re fine.  You’re paying them to stand in that position, Mr. W.

572
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,078
They’ll stand in that position.

573
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:03,758
They’ve been in more awkward positions before.

574
00:43:03,793 --> 00:43:07,431
Thousands of years ago, in Cyprus,

575
00:43:07,466 --> 00:43:08,849
women went about their own lives

576
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,875
only after first spending time as prostitutes at the temple of Aphrodite.

577
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,227
The tribute to their promiscuity

578
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:20,123
meant to secure for the island the goddess’
grant of bountiful crops and beautiful weather.

579
00:43:22,249 --> 00:43:26,284
Woman’s generative instrument on the altar of the race’s necessities,

580
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,317
have we not come some far piece since then?

581
00:43:30,352 --> 00:43:33,477
Who, for example, fucks on altars anymore,

582
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:37,037
or pretends anything can make up the weather’s mind?

583
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,446
Are you gonna fuck me tonight, Francis?

584
00:43:39,481 --> 00:43:42,129
I bore Carrie.

585
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,119
You were peeking. I asked you not to look.

586
00:43:49,154 --> 00:43:50,018
Sorry.

587
00:43:50,053 --> 00:43:55,358
Why not just go do what you’re gonna do, Mr. W.?

588
00:43:55,393 --> 00:43:56,948
Am I on a schedule then?

589
00:43:56,983 --> 00:44:00,249
She only meant our educations can wait.

590
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:03,201
I quite enjoyed our talk the other night.

591
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:04,722
Do you want to fuck her?

592
00:44:04,757 --> 00:44:07,152
No. Carrie, no.

593
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:10,028
Or I’d say so.

594
00:44:10,663 --> 00:44:13,503
The atmosphere of the room turns against me

595
00:44:13,538 --> 00:44:18,389
A growing collective impatience, where
should be a haven of indulgence.

596
00:44:18,424 --> 00:44:21,491
Won’t you indulge me?

597
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:25,793
We’re trying, Mr. W., but you are behaving badly.

598
00:44:25,828 --> 00:44:30,506
Disappointing, from you who I thought
to regale with details of the myths

599
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:36,299
gods fornicating with mortals, the endless incest,

600
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:40,597
fathers upon daughters upon sisters

601
00:44:45,428 --> 00:44:47,514
Take her in or get out, please.

602
00:44:47,549 --> 00:44:49,635
Excuse us.

603
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,850
Of course.

604
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:58,057
Er, be generous.  I think I’ve upset her.

605
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:13,181
Well, whatever were you aimin’ at?

606
00:45:13,216 --> 00:45:14,980
Your titties!

607
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:23,606
Any chance in here of an imminent
finish, commissioner?

608
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:26,409
My thought bein’ you might want to deliver

609
00:45:26,444 --> 00:45:30,258
our newspaper editor a certain document
before he’s too drunk to make it out.

610
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:36,974
I think not, until my bath is finished.

611
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:41,500
Uh-huh.  And I think a finish would involve

612
00:45:41,535 --> 00:45:44,553
you blowin’ some of them bubbles underwater, Honey.

613
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,513
Eamon.

614
00:46:15,055 --> 00:46:17,727
Has he per any fuckin’ chance returned from Gayville,

615
00:46:17,762 --> 00:46:20,065
Dan, which he had never been to?

616
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:24,850
Al’s upstairs.  Now if you agree to a few fuckin’ rules,

617
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:26,882
I’ll give you a brief audience with him.

618
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:30,037
Don’t it feel good to play at “Boss,” Dan?

619
00:46:30,072 --> 00:46:32,558
Unless you want to sit down here and bust my fuckin’ balls

620
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:35,875
over you never learnin’ to move amongst civilized people?

621
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,085
No, an audience is more important.

622
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:43,164
Alright.  Now, you listen careful while we walk up.

623
00:46:46,766 --> 00:46:48,510
You get up ‘er, you propose the robbery.

624
00:46:48,545 --> 00:46:50,322
You give him the location,

625
00:46:50,357 --> 00:46:52,847
the take that you are prepared to guarantee,

626
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:56,554
Al’s fee on that take, and then a bonus for overage.

627
00:46:56,589 --> 00:46:58,729
And then, Eamon, you shut the fuck up.

628
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:00,801
Al has had a tough fucking day.

629
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:04,740
Now, you let him indicate to you however
he fuckin’ chooses as to a yes or a no.

630
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,460
Now, that’s fair ain’t it?

631
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:09,901
You’re a great man, Dan.

632
00:47:09,936 --> 00:47:12,576
It’s you that’s the great one.

633
00:47:12,611 --> 00:47:14,302
Don’t bust my fuckin’ balls.

634
00:47:14,337 --> 00:47:17,103
Don’t call me “Crop Ear,” you gutless son of a bitch.

635
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,899
Eamon, we live life however we choose.

636
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:27,026
And you choose life as a cunt standing behind a bar.

637
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:28,717
Just tryin’ to do you a favor.

638
00:47:28,752 --> 00:47:30,101
I’ll have no favors from you!

639
00:47:30,136 --> 00:47:34,766
Alright, then.  Crop Ears.

640
00:47:34,801 --> 00:47:37,115
Or whatever the fuck it is you want to be called!

641
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:46,462
Trying to gauge Al’s recovery and do you a fuckin’ favor.

642
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,342
Crop Ears is dyin’ up ‘er.  You take him over
to the Chinaman’s and you throw him away.

643
00:48:02,377 --> 00:48:07,645
Sure, Dan. Sure.  Yeah, I’ll go get the sled.

644
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:11,389
I don’t have the patience for this fucking bullshit!

645
00:48:11,424 --> 00:48:13,742
I have had a tough fucking day!

646
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:24,590
Were you seeing a relative, Carrie, or did
the madam withhold you to frustrate me?

647
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:29,469
She doesn’t tell me why she does things.

648
00:48:29,504 --> 00:48:32,591
But you’d know if you were seeing a relative.

649
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:35,900
Yes.  I wasn’t.

650
00:48:35,935 --> 00:48:37,800
Were you seeing anyone?

651
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:45,349
A wild Indian. I fucked him and I fucked his horse.

652
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:48,732
You hate it here.

653
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:51,570
I suppose you don’t.

654
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:53,782
I don’t, no.

655
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:58,693
The rocks tell me stories.  And now I have you.

656
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:03,332
Well, I’m not a crazy person, so they don’t talk to me.

657
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:07,763
And I’m with me wherever I am, so I wish I was in fucking New York.

658
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:13,143
The rocks don’t “talk” to me, but—still I learn their stories.

659
00:49:13,178 --> 00:49:17,879
Oh, I understand now.  Thank you for saying it like I’m a baby.

660
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:23,727
Well, uh…these hills are unimaginably rich.

661
00:49:23,762 --> 00:49:24,985
So what?

662
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,357
To compel even the vagrant attentions of someone like my employer.

663
00:49:29,392 --> 00:49:32,087
I won’t stay for any amount.

664
00:49:32,122 --> 00:49:36,467
For a large amount, will you stay for a little?

665
00:49:36,502 --> 00:49:40,268
Give me some now.

666
00:49:40,303 --> 00:49:49,148
Of course. It’s more than I gave the madam.

667
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:55,335
And you musn’t hit me like you do the others.

668
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,924
You’ve never displeased me.

669
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:09,811
Don’t-fucking-hit me, Francis.

670
00:50:09,846 --> 00:50:12,324
Done.  Agreed.

671
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:27,743
I will run away to the Indians.

672
00:50:28,678 --> 00:50:31,920
You would change the course of history.

673
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,540
Be the first of the women chiefs.

674
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,146
Oh…

675
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,710
I’m too quick.

676
00:50:50,754 --> 00:50:53,409
You can’t be too quick for me.

677
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:08,142
You might try it sometimes with your prick outside of your pants.

678
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:13,217
I sense Miss Stubbs has fucked a relative.

679
00:51:13,252 --> 00:51:15,294
It’s a big club.

680
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:28,803
Pff-fft.
