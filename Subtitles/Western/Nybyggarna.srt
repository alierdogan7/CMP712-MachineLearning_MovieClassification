00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,393
NORTH-AMERICA
MINNESOTA TERRITORY 1850

3
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,355
Now I don't want to rock any more'
not on land and not at sea.

4
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,358
We'll be home soon.

5
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,870
HOMESTEADER KARL OSKAR NILSSON'
NORTH-AMERI CA

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,233
What if it had been my oxen.

7
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,710
-Aren't we there yet?
-Just a little bit further.

8
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,029
You didn't consult me before
you took a place this far away.

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,989
-Are the rocks hot?
-Yes' a little.

10
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,716
No' let's continue.
They might hurt us if they see us.

11
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,631
Anders claims the savages
aren't that aggressive.

12
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,599
You couldn't come' Kristina'
so I had to make the choice on my own.

13
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,955
-I have claimed the best land in North-America
-It's just so far away.

14
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,756
To a place like this' no road could be too long

15
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,714
Don't think I will just accept anything you do.

16
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,075
-Just trust me' Kristina.
-You never ask anyone's advice.

17
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,433
I ask your advice sometimes' don't I?

18
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,997
Maybe sometimes.
But you do whatever you want regardless.

19
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,478
At lest the soil is easy to till here

20
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,310
It's a nice place you've got here' Karl Oskar.

21
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,079
Do you see over there?
Can you see the 'shanty' up there.

22
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,959
It's only a little 'shanty'.

23
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,837
But it will have to house us
until we can get the house ready at least.

24
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,839
We'll have to start as peasants'-

25
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,354
-even if we have more' and better'
land than any of the big farmers at home.

26
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,718
Look at this' Kristina.

27
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,917
Have you seen anything like it? And it's just
as deep throughout. We'll grow good bread here.

28
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,198
THE SETTLERS

29
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,593
-Karl Oskar?
-Yes.

30
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,716
We have to buy a cow'
so we'll have milk for the winter.

31
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,790
I should have told you sooner.
We have nothing to buy a cow for.

32
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:34,508
Nothing? Are we that badly off?

33
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,397
Everything is so unconscionably expensive. And I
haven't bought anything we didn't strictly need.

34
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,550
Surely a cow is just as necessary
as anything else?

35
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,558
Not as necessary as the house.

36
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:01,598
But the whole winter. . . do you think the children
will survive till spring without milk?

37
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,758
Is there no way' do you think?

38
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,112
How can we buy anything without money?

39
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,394
-Is that the winter coming already?
-It can't come that suddenly.

40
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,676
Will you get the house ready in time?

41
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,595
Next time I will build bigger.
And shave the timber on both sides.

42
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,675
Here we go!
One' two' three. . .now!

43
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,750
What on earth. . . !
Did you find a wild cow on the way?

44
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,874
You can borrow Lady over the winter.
We only need one cow.

45
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,358
The cow is old' of course.
But she is fat' and she has plenty of milk.

46
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,072
-Now she's stuck.
-Are you stuck?

47
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,078
It's your fault' Karl Oskar.

48
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,591
You've cut it too narrow for a grown woman.

49
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,236
You should know women have wider hips than men.

50
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,557
God made us to lie on our backs-

51
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,468
-whilst we carry out his commandment
to populate the world.

52
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,912
Ulrika can certainly make porridge.
That's the kind of woman one should have.

53
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,559
-You already have a woman.
-The Indian woman couldn't cook for pigs.

54
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,078
She's only good in bed.

55
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:01,788
She's a bit small down there'
but all the Indian girls are petite.

56
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,750
Yeah' I'll drink to that. Cheers!

57
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,634
The American liquor are good and strong'
but they look like cows piss.

58
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,518
Come over here and give me a hand.

59
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,553
-Can you keep a secret' Arvid?
-My lips are sealed' you know that.

60
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,117
-I'm getting out of here as soon a possible.
-Are you leaving your brother?

61
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,032
Karl Oskar isn't in charge of me.
I'm going to look for gold.

62
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,392
-You never said anything about this.
-Such things must be kept secret.

63
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,629
But I wasn't planning on going on my own'
I was hoping you would come with me.

64
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,150
Will you?

65
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:12,158
-We don't have to cross any oceans' do we?
-No. Come on.

66
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,430
Hey there' troubadours' not bad.
strumming both back and forth

67
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,678
Gusten's jaw is chewing the rhythm
Janne squeezing with might and sound

68
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,952
Your favourite harmonica
sounds more like a horse in heat

69
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,392
Lena' you soar like the bird in the sky
And your legs are surely not made of led

70
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,718
If I have a girl in my bedroom'
it sounds like a jackhammer

71
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,879
The skirts swings so beautifully to
the sound of Jane’s notes and Gusten's song

72
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,596
And we see a day so beautifully blue
the sun sets behind the mountains

73
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:00,308
Pink and purple the night sky
hangs over Finnbäcksby

74
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,719
As soon as we get the road fixed up'
if won't seem so far anymore.

75
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,550
Does anyone regret emigrating?

76
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,708
Does anyone regret emigrating?

77
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,391
Regret moving to a country where one
is treated like a decent human being?

78
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,594
No' they'd sooner have to
make sausage meat of me.

79
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,475
At home they think Sweden is the whole
world. That's why they're so conceited.

80
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,637
That devils nest!

81
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,150
If you went out and had your morning fart'-

82
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,673
-people would carry on until
the whole county was willed with it's sound.

83
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,236
It was meant to be' us moving here.

84
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,717
We should neither regret' nor be afraid.

85
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,470
I regret I didn't move here six years ago.

86
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:15,109
No one is going to make me leave this place'
as surely as I am sitting here before you.

87
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,835
-Kristina?
-What is it' Kristina?

88
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,675
Forgive me' please.

89
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,839
Sit down and have a sip.

90
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,715
I can't help it.
It'll be over soon.

91
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,513
I tell you our next house. . .

92
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,034
Our next house at home here by Ki-Chi-Saga - that
will be something !

93
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,794
Karl Oskar hates the Indians.

94
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,199
But they are smart enough not to
go randomly digging up the soil.

95
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,948
Hey' Robert? That gold.
Where did you say that was?

96
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,758
-In California.
-No' I mean' do you know exactly where it is?

97
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,433
No' not precisely'
will just have to go searching and ask for help.

98
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,712
Is it all scattered around'
or is it all in one place?

99
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,230
It's scattered around.

100
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,799
-I wonder what Danjel is going to say.
-Aren't you your own man?

101
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,789
Of course' but he did pay my fare.

102
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:00,109
Afterwards you can pay him so much
he could spend the rest of his life travelling.

103
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,514
Out! Get out!

104
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,794
Karl Oskar! Karl Oskar!

105
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,199
Oh my God' that was dreadful.

106
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,993
Au !

107
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,630
-Are you sure it's not serious?
-I'm sure it will pass.

108
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,038
-But your in pain.
-It will pass.

109
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,032
The time has come.

110
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,756
-Are you sure?
-It couldn't be anything else.

111
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,989
-But isn't it too early?
- 1 4 days. But it's not like I decide!

112
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,715
-We have to get help.
-Go to Ulrika.

113
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,276
I asked her when we were moving.

114
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,913
Ulrika. . .

115
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,669
There you go' little Kristina.

116
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,190
Help me.

117
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,996
-Will mother die' dad?
-There is nothing to worry about' Johan.

118
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,715
There is nothing to worry about.
Mother will be right as rain soon.

119
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,795
I can see the head !

120
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,755
Hold her firmly' Karl Oskar!

121
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,237
Hold me!

122
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,719
It's a boy.
He looks like his dad between the legs.

123
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,273
Hand me the scissors' Karl Oskar.

124
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,830
He was made in Sweden.

125
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,995
And let's prey the lords watches over him'-

126
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,353
-so he won't have any permanent
damage from that.

127
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,109
He will be a true American.

128
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,108
Here' Karl Oskar.
His a big boy.

129
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,476
Shall we say hello to your mother?

130
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,238
Let's have the birthing drink' Kristina.

131
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,672
I baptise you Nils Oskar Danjel-

132
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:54,070
-in the name of the father' the son. . .

133
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,593
. . .And the holy spirit. Amen.

134
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,435
Let us pray.

135
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,630
Karl Oskar! I've shot an Indian !

136
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:02,553
-What are you talking about? You're lying.
-No!

137
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,229
I think he fell. He shot at me first.

138
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,832
If you've shot an Indian you've brought
misfortune down on all of us. Where was it?

139
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,318
-Below the big cliff.
-Come show me.

140
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,675
There!

141
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,956
-Was he shooting arrows at you' or what?
-Yeah' he shot several arrows at me.

142
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,959
He's been dead for weeks.
He didn't shoot anything at you.

143
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,074
It's true' Karl Oskar.
I swear it!

144
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,832
It must have been another Indian in another
tree. I could hear the arrows fly by.

145
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,397
You hearing is shot in one ear.
I know what this means.

146
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,150
For as long as the ground is frozen
the Indians can't bury their dead.

147
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,831
-But I swear!
-You are lying. Take it back!

148
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,795
-I'm not taking any of it back.
-So you believe your own lies now?

149
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,516
In the end no one will believe
you about anything.

150
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,156
You not in charge of me.
Your not my father.

151
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,716
I'm your older brother.

152
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,035
Well. . . that was the last of it.
From now on we make do without bread.

153
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,074
Couldn't we borrow a sack of flour from Danjel.

154
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,753
We still owe him for the bank' but I suppose
we don't have another choice.

155
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,714
-Soon there will be one mouth less to feed.
-What?

156
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,277
I'm leaving.
I'm going to look for gold in California.

157
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,837
-And what exactly will you do there?
-Dig for gold' of course.

158
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,114
-Dig for gold !
-Arvid is coming too.

159
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,437
You can't. I won't allow it!

160
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,432
In America each man is his own master.
We worked it out this autumn

161
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,236
We'll work on the steam boat to St.Luis'
from there on we take the highway.

162
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,913
You can't do it on your own.
You're only 18 years old.

163
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,114
You were only 14 when you moved
away from home.

164
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,234
That was in Sweden.
That's different.

165
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,753
You made your own decision when you were 14.
Why can't I when I'm 18?

166
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,955
You can't stop me.
As soon as the ice melts we're off.

167
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,708
-Don't give me your last dollars.
-You might need them.

168
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,152
Just in case you don't find as much
gold as you think you will.

169
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,035
LETTER TO:

170
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,473
Here's the flour' Mr Nelson.

171
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,157
I'm sorry that isn't enough.
I need 20 cent.

172
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:46,028
You don't have it? Well. . . I'm sorry.

173
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,757
Maple syrup. . . Everything OK?

174
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,158
Yes' everything is fine.

175
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:07,197
-Any letters for me?
-Sorry. We haven't received any letters.

176
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:03,718
-Has Samuel Nöjd asked you to marry him?
-Yes' it is true. Nöjd asked me to marry him.

177
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,435
Him too. And what did you tell him.

178
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,189
I told him the same thing I told
Mr Månsson and Mr Abbott.

179
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,791
I wonder who will end up being your husband.

180
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,833
I don't wonder about anything myself' Kristina.

181
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,910
I'm moving from DanjeI to Stillwater.
A miracle has happened.

182
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,832
I'm going to become a Baptist'
and my husband to be will baptise me.

183
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,032
What on earth?!

184
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:43,349
I'm getting married to Reverend Jackson
in StiIIwater. It's a miracle!

185
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,828
Kristina' I can't explain it!
There is nothing more I can say.

186
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:58,436
Dear' sweet Ulrika. You surprise me.
It's not like you to be upset like this.

187
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,236
I'm not upset' I'm happy!

188
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:09,435
-You couldn't ask for a better husband.
-It's a miracle!

189
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,396
Turn around' close your eyes. Don't open them
till I tell you. Close your eyes!

190
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,474
Now you can look.

191
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,831
No. . . !

192
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,596
-You have to try it on' Kristina.
-No' no!

193
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,316
You look prettier than the
grandest noble lady.

194
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:11,078
Here you go' Mr Nelson. 15 cent.

195
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,228
-That's right. 15 cent.
-What do you mean. . .?

196
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:23,038
That will be 15 cent for the postage.

197
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,391
Me? 15?

198
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:37,555
-Don't you have any cash?
-No' I don't have any cash. Not today.

199
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,275
Can you come back?

200
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,479
I'm sorry.

201
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:56,233
-Another day?
-Monday? Come back on Monday.

202
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,798
I will need to keep hold of that' Mr Nelson.

203
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,275
Thank you.

204
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,076
Goodbye.

205
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,748
Reach out your strong hand'
and yank me back to Sweden !

206
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,998
I thought you were asleep' Karl Oskar.

207
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,954
Something woke me.

208
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:10,878
-How are you' Kristina?
-I'm fine.

209
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,913
Just go back to sleep.

210
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,989
-Why are you lying awake?
-It's nothing.

211
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,558
It's just silly and childish.

212
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:33,439
You're sad' aren't you?
You're sad' Kristina.

213
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:42,191
If your battling with something' then let me
help. That what good friends are there for.

214
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,830
If you want God to reach out and yank you back,-

215
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,990
-then I will reach out my arm
and keep you here with me.

216
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,513
Do you know what' Karl Oskar?

217
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,871
There is nothing more to say.

218
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,509
It was a childish thought that occurred
to me as I was saying my evening prayer.

219
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:33,679
Karl Oskar. . .
Don't you ever miss the old ones?

220
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,998
Maybe sometimes.

221
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,750
I can't help it!

222
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,318
Sweetness' ah my sweet. . .
Wait. I'm going to fetch you something.

223
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,511
Anna's old boot.

224
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,875
It helps me remember
when I get homesick sometimes

225
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,515
Maybe it will help you too.

226
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:42,111
One day our children will thank us for
moving to America.

227
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:52,798
-Do you think so? Do you really think so?
-I can feel it in my bones. I know so.

228
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:59,234
Maybe your right. One never knows.

229
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:09,397
Hey' Kristina?
Do you remember when we moved here?

230
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:16,631
And you said it was almost as pretty as
it was at home at Duvemala.

231
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:22,630
I have been wondering if we should name
our new home Duvemåla as well

232
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,198
What do you think?
Or maybe New Duvemåla.

233
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,752
Do you think. . .

234
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,237
Duvemåla?

235
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,990
Then we wouldn't live by Ki-Chi-Saga anymore.

236
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,558
We would live in DuvemåIa.

237
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:57,153
-It sounds so strange' Karl Oskar.
-Let's do it then?

238
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,996
Do you know what day it is tomorrow?
It's a big anniversary.

239
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:10,353
It's the 14 of April.
A year tot he day of-

240
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,350
-the day we stepped on
board the ship in Karlshamn.

241
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,792
And tomorrow I will till
American soil for the first time.

242
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,315
Your Swedish' I suppose?

243
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,636
-Petrus Olausson' from Alfta County.
-Karl Oskar Nilsson' from Ljuder County.

244
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:38,757
I was thinking pf settling down here by
the lake. Now we'll be neighbours.

245
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:46,639
In Sweden I had to pay a 200 'daler' fine for
having read the Bible in my own house.

246
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,311
Sweden is corrupted by unjust authorities.

247
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,436
I every evening I thank god in my prayers
for my new homeland.

248
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:04,511
I'm glad to get some neighbours. I didn't think
anyone wanted to live this far out.

249
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:11,478
You won't have the place to yourselves much
longer. There are two other families coming.

250
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:16,549
-There you go' Kristina.
-Then we can set up our own parish.

251
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,593
-A church parish?
-Yes' we'll build a church.

252
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,395
A small temple to God.

253
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,150
A gods house of plain timber' naturally.

254
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,274
First I have my barn to think about.

255
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,359
After that I was going to build
a new farm house.

256
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,995
But you can't just toil in the here and now'
and forget all about the ever after.

257
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:48,832
A barn is no excuse to delay
building a house of God.

258
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,070
If only I had an oxen'
I would have had 30 acres by now'

259
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,354
I have an oxen.
If you get one then we can help each other.

260
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,072
-Are you the only man?
-My brother went to California.

261
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,034
Nobody knows if he is even alive.

262
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,073
This is where I'm building my new farm house.

263
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,951
You're aiming big.

264
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:25,154
The kitchen will be over here
and the bedroom over there.

265
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,113
And the wall will go here.

266
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,995
Mark my words' Nelson.
You can't build it that big.

267
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:39,150
Look at this' Olausson. This is from Sweden.
This is from home.

268
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,353
-It's an apple tree.
-We'll have glass apples

269
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,992
I want to plant a blomst.

270
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:05,114
-''''Blomst''''?
-Yes' bI omst.

271
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,988
''''BI omst''''?

272
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,157
Ah !

273
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,397
I wanta bI omst.

274
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:25,071
-Seeds?
-No.

275
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:33,312
-Seeds. . .
-I know what you mean. I'll go get it.

276
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,319
This is what you want' Mrs Nelson.

277
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,916
You want five of those? Help yourself.

278
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,591
-Blomst.
-Flowers' Mrs Nelson.

279
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,996
Flowers.

280
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,476
-Flowers.
-Blomst.

281
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,912
How nice they are.

282
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:33,319
-The men here are very polite.
-Yes' people appreciate their women around here.

283
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,197
In Sweden' men use women as maids in
the daytime and mattresses at night'-

284
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,993
-and in between she is nothing.

285
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,954
We just stood still for a while
in front of this machine'-

286
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,552
-and as by magic we were captured
on this thick paper.

287
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,036
It is just as nice as a painting.

288
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,913
Henry and have been standing there
looking just the same all year.

289
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,593
Would you like some more?

290
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,639
-You have a nice and kind husband.
-Henry is very gentle.

291
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,355
How did you understand each other
before you learnt to speak English?

292
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,838
We pointed and made signs
and waved our hands a lot.

293
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,192
-Excuse me.
-Did you choke on something?

294
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,518
No' it's the priest coming.

295
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:05,192
Not Henry' but the priest I will
bring into this world. That's why I threw up.

296
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,474
-I'm pregnant' you see.
-Ulrika !

297
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,910
When I got married I hadn't been
with a man for four years'-

298
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:23,115
-so it felt nice to use the body
for the purpose it was made for.

299
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:28,872
And that in a union blessed by God.

300
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,472
But Jackson was doing it too fast
in the beginning. That was the problem.

301
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:42,952
Sleep tight' Kristina.
You've got a long journey tomorrow. Good night.

302
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,355
-Ask who it is before you open.
-Who is it?

303
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,189
May I come in' good people?

304
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,513
-Is he Swedish?
-Yes. Thank goodness

305
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,998
-He must have been out in bad weather.
-Yes' it was terrible weather.

306
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:27,871
-Where have you come from?
-St. Paul. I walked here.

307
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,630
I'm completely exhausted.

308
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,957
Sit him down' let him dry off.

309
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,472
It's so nice to come into a nice
dry house a little while.

310
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:53,029
-He's bleeding ! Has he been hit?
-It's the mosquitoes' they were biting bad.

311
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,472
We are the Nilsson's.
Karl Oskar Nilsson' from Ljuder County.

312
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:10,278
Erland Törner is my name'
from Väderstad County in Östergötland.

313
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,712
I see' ÖstergötIand. Well' well. . .

314
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:21,868
Has he come here to claim land then?

315
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,390
No' I'm a priest in the Swedish church.

316
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,037
-He's a priest?
-Yes.

317
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,631
I come to you unknown my fellow countrymen.

318
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,799
I have an emigration license
which confirms that I'm. . .

319
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:49,519
We never doubted the father' not for a second.

320
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:55,237
Would the father like some dry clothes?
I'm sure Karl Oskar has some that will. . .

321
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:05,676
It almost feels like blasphemy to
dress a priest in this manner.

322
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,078
Well' it's a little big'
but nice and warm.

323
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,637
If the father will accept'
this is all we have.

324
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,874
May I ask. . .
Why has the father come to America?

325
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,111
-For the sake of the emigrants.
-For our sake? But who pays him?

326
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,750
No one' but good people
house me and feed me'-

327
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,749
-just like you have this evening.
Just the way you have taken care of'-

328
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:56,592
-I will be taking care of the souls
of my fellow country men.

329
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,079
Would the father perhaps honour us
with some bits out holy scriptures?

330
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,317
We have not been able to make our
confessions for more than three years.

331
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:48,439
Oi ! Oi' oi' oi !

332
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:24,756
And from that can draw

333
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:34,790
that sin is no joking matter

334
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:44,754
I have selected today's text from
the Deeds of the Apostles chapter 1 7.

335
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:52,195
''''And he let people of all kind' who all come
from one person' populate the whole world'''''-

336
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,959
-''''and he gave them set times''''-

337
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:00,552
-''''and lay out boarders to
their territories.''''

338
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,798
Excuse me' father.

339
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:43,232
God has determined how far and
how wide people should travel and flee.

340
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,717
I am speaking to you'
Swedish men and women-

341
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:51,549
-who have crossed a
third of the earths surface'-

342
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,638
-who have travelled from one
continent to another.

343
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:01,949
Me' poor sinful human. . .

344
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,436
. . .who has been born with sin. . .

345
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:12,318
. . .and who must suffer
all the days of my life. . .

346
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,832
Jesus Christ' whose body you are about to
receive'-

347
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,875
-may he keep you in eternity. Amen.

348
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,231
Jesus Christ' whose body you are about to
receive'-

349
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:33,150
-may he keep you in eternity. Amen.

350
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,398
Jesus Christ' whose body you are about to
receive'-

351
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,991
-may he keep you in eternity. Amen.

352
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,795
Jesus Christ' whose blood you are about to
receive'-

353
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:51,836
-may he keep you in eternity. Amen.

354
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,670
Look now' look now.

355
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:04,559
We all know how Jesus. . .

356
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,990
You mean Ulrika.
She is my best friend.

357
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:26,910
But your friend is married to the
Baptist preacher in StiIIwater!

358
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:32,558
-She has been re-baptised !
-I know' but that is her business.

359
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,993
Well' you should know: we are not
allowed to associate with heretics.

360
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,591
Don't let the woman into your house.
Don't open the door to her.

361
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:48,750
Mrs Jackson is an enemy of our faith.
It is only out of love we seek to warn you.

362
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,312
Brother Petrus. Does he know. . .

363
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,877
Does he know that he is speaking
of my best friend in America?

364
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,314
-Friendship blinds you.
-Spirits appear to be friends.

365
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:13,310
You cannot recognise the enemy of
the church in this Mrs Jackson because of it.

366
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,594
-Are you talking about Ulrika behind her back?!
-Poor child' what is she saying !

367
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:26,115
Be quiet. Put your wife in her place.
Help us talk some sense into her.

368
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,677
This is absurd.
You have nothing to do with Kristina.

369
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:37,717
She opens the door to whomever she chooses.
Don't you give orders in my house!

370
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:43,198
I don't need a guardian' nor does my wife.
At least that is cleared up!

371
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:47,518
Nelson' dear neighbour.
You must understand us. . .

372
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,235
You come over here wanting to
separate Ulrika and me.

373
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:56,150
You speak ill of her and accuse
her of evil doings.

374
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:01,434
You have forgotten the eight commandment' that
is how much of a Christian you are. Shame on you !

375
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:08,995
-Come' Petrus. We have come too late.
-Dear Kristina. . .

376
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,433
We came her today out of Christian love'
and you greet us with insults'-

377
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:21,033
-but I forgive you.
Heresy speaks through you.

378
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:27,474
Christian people must avoid this house'
until we can clean it.

379
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:33,118
Out! Get out of here!
Out' if it's too dirty for you.

380
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:39,588
''''Clean''''' you said. ''''until it
is cleaned'''' I will never forget this.

381
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,632
In this territory' 19 out of 20 men-

382
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:24,110
-lie alone at night whimpering till
moss grows on their rods.

383
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,996
Or you have to do as Samuel Nöjd did
and take one of the brown ones as your wife.

384
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:40,796
I could never go to bed with an Indian woman.

385
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,673
I am sure you would if you got desperate enough.

386
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:48,351
I'm sure there is nothing wrong with their
pussies' even if they are very small.

387
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,837
If you wrote a letter to the
Swedish Government'-

388
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:00,674
-maybe they could send over a shipload of
good' decent Swedish women.

389
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,679
And then we could swear' in writing-

390
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:10,318
-that we would rob them all of their
virginity the very day they arrived.

391
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:15,912
and then we could. . .
Or maybe possibly the second night at the latest.

392
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:20,238
If anyone had their virginity
intact by sunrise'-

393
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,273
-she would get a 1000 daler compensation.

394
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:37,517
If only I had my own oxen.
I could produce twice as much.

395
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,669
It is best if you get off.

396
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,113
Stomp properly!

397
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,710
No. No!

398
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,718
Move!

399
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:49,230
Move' you devil !

400
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,669
We'll soon be home' Johan.
Wrap up tight in your coat.

401
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,392
There you go.

402
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:59,317
Johan? Little Johan?

403
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,432
Johan !

404
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:24,234
There you go' Johan. Just so.
I'll be back soon.

405
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:11,635
Robert! Are you back!

406
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,957
You recognised me faster than Karl Oskar.

407
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,596
But he was still in the crib when I left.

408
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:30,395
And here is one more. This is Ulrika.

409
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:43,355
-You must be hungry?
-I'm mostly thirsty.

410
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:10,111
I picked up a cold on the steam boat.

411
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:17,510
-Where is Arvid? Isn't he with you?
-No' Arvid isn't with me.

412
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:24,273
-Where is he now' then?
-He stayed behind over there.

413
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:37,079
You've got to eat. You've got to finish it.
You're nothing but skin and bones.

414
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,839
Is your ear still painful?

415
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:50,114
Yes' it howls and aches in there.

416
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:56,230
If only you could hear the
things it tells me in the nights.

417
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:10,232
I should have had that crib with me
tot he gold fields.

418
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:14,956
Gold is treated like an infant.

419
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:19,392
You rock it back and forth till all
the sand and gravel is sifted out'-

420
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,990
-and the it lies there'
flashing on the bottom.

421
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:28,752
Where did you find the gold?

422
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:33,351
It was everywhere.

423
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:39,635
Sometimes in the strangest places.
Once in a washer boy.

424
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:46,233
One night he got a terrible stomach
cramp' screaming and twitching.

425
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:50,717
The next morning he was dead.

426
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:55,436
Then someone took out a knife
and opened him up'-

427
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:00,714
-and inside it shimmered of gold

428
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:07,439
He had been stealing nuggets.
Swallowing a pinch here and there.

429
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,839
He had thought it would come out the
usual way' but it hadn't.

430
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,397
He had swallowed gold for 4000 dollar.

431
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:23,311
-So that is how you find gold in California.
-That is terrible!

432
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,956
What dreadful things you have
lived through' Robert.

433
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,874
Did you hear that' Karl Oskar?

434
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:46,156
Robert' did you really find
gold in California?

435
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,512
-I'm satisfied.
-Is it true? I mean. . .

436
01:22:53,600 --> 01:23:00,676
I have had my last landlord.
I have enough for the three of us.

437
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,232
Stop lying to us.

438
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:10,150
I can't stand to listen to this.
It's painful.

439
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:17,118
-You don't believe me' Karl Oskar?
-You know you don't have any gold.

440
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:23,349
No ones blames you for coming back without
it. we are only happy you're alive.

441
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:28,036
You think I'm lying.

442
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:54,353
Take that. It's as good as gold.

443
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,198
I took out some pocket money from the bank.

444
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,037
Keep the trousers. They're a gift.

445
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:53,197
. . .400' 450' 500' 550'
600' 650' 700' 750. . .

446
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:11,392
-Do we dare keep the money in the house?
-Who thins we have that kind of cash?

447
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:18,631
We got 1500 'riksdaler' for Korpamoen.
This is ten times as much.

448
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,833
I had a feeling Robert
wasn't lying this time.

449
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:29,479
-We can't be sure though.
-Do you still doubt him?

450
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:34,515
-The money could be fake.
-Do you think your brother is a forger?

451
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:41,318
It will be Ok when we get to California.

452
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:58,269
Arvid. Everything will be Ok
when we get to California.

453
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,434
Robert! Let's go home!

454
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,792
Robert' Let's go home!

455
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:25,675
Robert's sleeping.

456
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:32,074
Go out and play. Run along !

457
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:59,717
-We have our own parish' and a school.
-You brother is trusted here on America.

458
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:06,518
-Danjel and he are on the board.
-I have become a church deacon.

459
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:14,149
-So' you've become a church deacon?
-Without a church. But we are working on that.

460
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:17,352
We argued for a year about where to build it.

461
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:23,032
People here can't agree on anything.
They argue over the slightest details.

462
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:29,190
People have too little say in Sweden.
So' now they are making up for it here in America.

463
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:38,390
Are the kids learning English in school?

464
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:43,992
-DO you want to read a little for you uncle?
-Stand up' like you do in school.

465
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,432
''''A tall boy.
A beautiful book. Red apples.''''

466
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:55,271
''''I dress myself. She dresses herself.
We walk and talk together.''''

467
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:02,997
I don't understand half of it.
Märta' sing for your uncle Robert.

468
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,750
-Sing the school song.
-yes' sing that one.

469
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:13,273
To school we go
and stand in row

470
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:18,428
with clean hands
and shiny faces

471
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:23,475
Ah' let us hear'
with an attentive ear

472
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:29,311
Everything that is thought
before it's too late

473
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:35,629
If we stand without posture
and walk around thoughtlessly

474
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:41,312
Things will turn out badly
and it will be our fault.

475
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:47,117
Ah' hurry and learn
and yearn for knowledge

476
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:52,439
For it is much better
than silver and gold
