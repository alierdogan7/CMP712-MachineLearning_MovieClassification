1
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,953
[engine starts]

2
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,169
[tires squeal]

3
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,505
Oh, hey. Uh, Sheriff.

4
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,757
Your Jane Doe is right over...

5
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,318
She's not a Jane Doe.

6
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,616
Do you want me to...

7
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,530
I can pray with you if you'd like.

8
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,534
What?

9
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,061
Would you like me to pray with you?

10
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,789
She must've meant a lot to you.

11
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,085
It's not Donna.

12
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,862
Oh, my Lord. But, uh...

13
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,257
But the description on the report.

14
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,368
Oh, I feel terrible I
put you through this.

15
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,869
It's just I-I couldn't get
Sheriff Wilkins to come down here

16
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,957
to I.D. our Jane Doe, and...

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,852
I'm so sorry.

18
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,547
There's no need.

19
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,443
You did the right thing.

20
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:22,910
So, should I try to get
Sheriff Wilkins again?

21
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,204
No.

22
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,370
Hey there, Eamonn.

23
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,806
[Eamonn] God.

24
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,332
Hey, Walt.

25
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,228
This is a creepy sort of surprise.

26
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,065
I need to talk to you inside.

27
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,609
Look, I don't know what Vic told you...

28
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:58,928
- I don't care about you and Vic.
- Well, you say that,

29
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,948
but it's after 10:00
and you're lying in wait.

30
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,276
- I'm not lying in wait.
- You're sitting in the dark,

31
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,161
- your truck's nowhere to be seen.
- 'Cause I don't want to be seen.

32
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,080
- It's basically the definition...
- It's about your boss.

33
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,696
- It's a little hard to believe.
- Is it?

34
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,783
How much did Sheriff Wilkins
receive in, uh, campaign donations

35
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,326
from Newett Energy last election?

36
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,261
I don't know.

37
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,247
I do. I looked it up.

38
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:30,144
Every member of their board wrote
the maximum check allowable by law.

39
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,503
Just because he's accepting
political contributions

40
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,194
doesn't mean he's protecting a criminal.

41
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,298
- And yet that's what he's doing.
- According to you.

42
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,135
Why else would he check Walker
Browning out of the hospital

43
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,096
and ban me from his county unless
he's trying to hide something from me?

44
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,766
When you say "ban," you mean
in the legal sense of ban?

45
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,785
- Like a restraining order?
- I don't know.

46
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:51,438
But I do know that he ignored a Jane
Doe that matched my missing person.

47
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,791
That seems like a cover up to me.

48
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,193
[sighs]

49
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,296
All right.

50
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,843
Even if all of this were true,
what do you want me to do?

51
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,786
Help me.

52
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,538
Keep an eye out for Walker Browning.

53
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,723
Can you do that?

54
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,142
I don't know.

55
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,355
I'll think about it.

56
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,692
Fair enough.

57
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,594
[grunts]

58
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,907
Shit.

59
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,951
Don't move, asshole.

60
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,039
- Take off that mask.
- No.

61
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,874
Take it off or you're dead.

62
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,127
- You can't kill me.
- Oh, really?

63
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,462
Why not?

64
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,175
Because Hector lives,
and because I know you.

65
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,451
You're a thief.

66
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,929
But you're not a murderer.

67
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,063
[gunshot]

68
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,191
[knock on door]

69
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,817
Hey, Sheriff.

70
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,029
You didn't by chance stop
by the print shed last night

71
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,339
and pick up your Bronco?

72
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,633
- Yep.
- Ah.

73
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,786
Yeah, so normally when I'm
collecting evidence on a vehicle,

74
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,266
it helps to not have somebody take
the vehicle in the middle of the night.

75
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,101
- How's Larry doing?
- What?

76
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,106
Larry, the arson investigator
who's going over Donna's van.

77
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,464
He got pulled away.

78
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,758
Uh, suspicious brush
fire at Pronghorn Ridge.

79
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,818
Right.

80
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,407
- Can I have the keys to the Bronco back?
- Nope. I'm leaving.

81
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,329
What do you want me to do
with the kid in the cell?

82
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,689
Has anyone confirmed
that he's Donna's son?

83
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,191
No.

84
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,960
Then nothing.

85
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,216
[door closes]

86
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,692
[grunts]

87
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,055
[Donna] Came out after my
group and... and it was on fire,

88
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,100
and the fire department said
that someone broke the window

89
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,496
and threw a Molotov
cocktail inside, so...

90
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,167
[blows]

91
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,632
[Donna] Well, my
patient's suicide, um...

92
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,635
it was because of me.

93
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,932
Have you ever heard of transference?

94
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,796
This patient hasn't made
their last four sessions,

95
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,900
so I'm completely in the dark as
to their state of mind right now.

96
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,283
[Vic] Have you totally
lost your damn mind?

97
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,369
Where the hell did you go last night?

98
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,936
[Walt] Cumberland County morgue.

99
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,207
They called me in to I.D. a Jane Doe.

100
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,961
Uh, blonde, 5'6", 45, 50 years old.

101
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,341
Shit.

102
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,492
I'm so sorry, Walt.

103
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,886
It wasn't her.

104
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,724
What does this look like?

105
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,312
Um... Red Stripe.

106
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,148
Same brand that Duncan Butler was
drinking when we visited him yesterday.

107
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,553
So, then I was right.

108
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,221
It was one of her patients.

109
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,866
You go to his house,
I'll head to his work.

110
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,034
No way.

111
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,978
I'm not letting you back
behind the wheel again.

112
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,666
- Give me the keys.
- I'm fine, Vic.

113
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,885
What the hell have you gotten me into?

114
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,788
I would be happy to file a police
report for you, Standing Bear.

115
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,082
I almost got killed.

116
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,226
That is on you.

117
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,793
It was a good plan.

118
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,853
Good?

119
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,048
You told me I was retrieving a
single antique piece of pottery

120
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,934
from a residence where nobody was home,
but not a single part of that description

121
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:14,678
- turned out to be true.
- What do you mean?

122
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,574
- You couldn't find the pot?
- I found hundreds of pots!

123
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,016
It might've looked like
a residence from outside,

124
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:24,230
but inside it was some kind of warehouse
filled with counterfeit Indian artifacts,

125
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,874
and somebody was home.

126
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,292
Can you describe him?

127
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,462
I only remember the shotgun
he pointed at my head.

128
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,172
What else?

129
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,674
So, no apology.

130
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,742
[telephone ringing]

131
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,619
I got to take this.

132
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,473
[sighs] Yeah.

133
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,291
Anybody get hurt?

134
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,935
Good.

135
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,938
Well, we finally got
an excuse to get inside.

136
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,025
All right. Yeah, I'm on my way.

137
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,737
Well, Standing Bear, I got to go.

138
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,347
Apparently, there was a
home invasion last night.

139
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,202
Some broken pottery,
a couple shots fired.

140
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,704
Someone said they even saw Hector.

141
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,461
You knew somebody would be
in that house last night.

142
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,964
You sent me there to cause a disturbance
so you could enter the house legally.

143
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,468
I told you it was a good plan.

144
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,351
[cell phone ringing]

145
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,090
[sighs]

146
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,676
[cell phone beeps]

147
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,321
Hello, Jacob.

148
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,374
Duncan?

149
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,334
- Can I help you?
- [Vic] Uh, yeah.

150
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,277
We're looking for Duncan Butler.

151
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,879
Uh, maybe you should talk to Brent.

152
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,507
- This way?
- Yeah.

153
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,803
[Brent] Can I see some I.D.?

154
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,039
Duncan has the day off. Call him
at home. I'm sure he'll see you.

155
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,903
We already went to his
house. He wasn't there,

156
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,125
- so we figured he'd be here.
- [Brent] Well, he's not.

157
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,629
Look, I don't know what you guys
want to talk to Duncan about,

158
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,298
but he served his
country for four years.

159
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,861
I think the least the rest of
us can do is cut him some slack.

160
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:20,005
Really? 'Cause what we want to talk to
him about is a van that got firebombed.

161
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,012
[scoffs] I see.

162
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,849
So, just because he served in Iraq
means he's the one who bombed a car.

163
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,252
- Yeah, sort of.
- And the rest of us have no responsibility

164
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,557
to help people like Duncan
after all they've done for us?

165
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:29,466
[Walt] Brent.

166
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,690
I appreciate what
you're doing for Duncan,

167
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,650
but this is not just
about a firebombed van.

168
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,737
There's a woman missing. Now, she
was also trying to help Duncan.

169
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,240
I don't know if he's done
anything wrong or if he's hurt her,

170
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,617
but I do need to speak to him.

171
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,702
Now, he doesn't have the
day off today, does he?

172
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,013
- He just didn't show up.
- Duncan is a good guy.

173
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,140
Brent.

174
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,041
When we spoke to you the other day,
you provided an alibi for Duncan

175
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,127
for the bombing and the abduction.

176
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,356
Would you swear to that
in front of a judge?

177
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,799
Sometimes Duncan has bad days.

178
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,237
He doesn't make it in, I...
I clock in and out for him.

179
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,615
This happen on the dates we asked about?

180
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,018
Yeah.

181
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,686
[Walt] You got any idea where he is?

182
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,788
No.

183
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,648
His wife wasn't home either.

184
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,734
- Do you know where she works?
- His wife?

185
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,598
His wife hasn't been
home since last November.

186
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,700
She left him.

187
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,428
[Walt] Okay, thanks, Ferg.

188
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,849
Duncan's wife filed
divorce papers in January.

189
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,209
Her most recent address is in Tensleep.

190
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,837
I'm no psychiatrist, but
Duncan seems delusional.

191
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,882
His wife leaves him and he keeps
her stuff laying around for months?

192
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,801
[static crackles]

193
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,803
[Ruby] I have Eamonn
O'Neill for you, Walt.

194
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,905
Put him through, Ruby.

195
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,282
- [Eamonn] I got to make this quick.
- Shoot.

196
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,225
[Eamonn] I think you
should come out here.

197
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,494
What'd you find?

198
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,288
I'd rather not say over the phone.

199
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,980
Where should I meet you?

200
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,165
I'll text you the address.

201
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,959
I don't have a cell phone.

202
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,569
[Walt] Text it through to Vic's.

203
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,964
Oh, you, uh, you with Vic?

204
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,549
Hey, Eamonn.

205
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,927
Hi.

206
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,372
Okay, send me that address.

207
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,599
[clears throat]

208
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,228
- [sighs]
- I'm not going out there.

209
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,046
No.

210
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,526
No, you're going to Tensleep
to look for Duncan's ex-wife.

211
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,845
You didn't hire Eamonn, did you?

212
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,680
[Walt] Nope.

213
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,782
What was that call about?

214
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:32,185
If we're wrong about Duncan, we
need to reconsider Walker Browning.

215
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,730
We still haven't ruled
him out as a suspect.

216
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,625
Eamonn may know where he's hiding.

217
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,960
I thought you said that I was right
about it being one of Donna's patients.

218
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,463
No, you said that.

219
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,091
I'm gonna need my keys back.

220
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,051
Recite the alphabet.

221
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,804
Backwards.

222
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,600
[rock music plays on radio]

223
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,105
[drawer closes, opens]

224
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,410

225
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,021
- [camera shutter clicks]
- [door opens]

226
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,999
You better not be messing with me.

227
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,209
Hello, Mathias.

228
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,947
So, I went and checked on that
house you broke into last night.

229
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,257
It's hardly a warehouse.

230
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,491
What do you mean?

231
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,828
Only artifacts I saw were
two bowls and a cooking pot.

232
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,329
And they were broken.

233
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,350
One was thrown, the other two
were blown up by a shotgun.

234
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,917
I know what I saw.

235
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,336
They're filing an insurance claim.

236
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,648
- How much?
- $120,000.

237
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,358
For counterfeit clay pots?

238
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,596
Not counterfeit.
Authentic, but black market.

239
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,889
We believe that someone's
systematically been stealing

240
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,449
and selling our people's history.

241
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,142
Like that pot I sent you for,

242
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,621
that was stolen from Adele
Chapman's house last week.

243
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,373
Instead, you drove their
operation underground.

244
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,219
- Hector has that effect on people.
- Uh-huh.

245
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,154
I'm actually a little concerned
that Hector doesn't fully appreciate

246
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,632
the nature of our arrangement.

247
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,209
He's supposed to be an
asset in fighting crime,

248
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,794
and he's supposed to be stealthy.

249
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,315
He's not supposed to shoot up the
joint, scare the bad guys into hiding.

250
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,424
Next time, maybe you should arm Hector

251
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,320
with a little more information
about what you expect from him.

252
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,450
Okay. Here's what I expect from him.

253
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:21,021
He's gonna watch that house, see
who comes and goes, and follow them.

254
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,999
I need to find where
that merchandise went.

255
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,484
Now, last night was strike one.

256
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,797
You get one more chance or I
send my blood samples to the FBI.

257
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,519
That is not how strikes work.

258
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,938
I never had much patience for baseball.

259
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,768
You have the code?

260
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,578
Nope. We got to climb.

261
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,914
You sure it's worth it?

262
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,440
No.

263
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,944
But this morning, a shutoff
engineer from the Newett oil field

264
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:12,405
came in to report that some cranky cowboy
came sniffing around his work site.

265
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,866
Same work site where you and
I questioned Walker Browning.

266
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,093
I wasn't that cranky.

267
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,412
Yeah, well, shortly after that,

268
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,766
Sheriff Wilkins announced
he'd be working from home.

269
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,436
Sheriff Wilkins lives here?

270
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,729
Yep.

271
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,505
You think Walker Browning's here?

272
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,027
It's just a hunch, but Sheriff
Wilkins doesn't ever work from home.

273
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,696
Nobody there to laugh at his jokes.

274
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,912
[grunts]

275
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,759
[Walker] Hey there, Sheriff.

276
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,057
Sound travels in the mountains.

277
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,603
Heard that old Bronco of
yours all the way up here.

278
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,757
Why don't you come on up for a chat?

279
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,236
Tell your little, uh,
deputy friend to join you.

280
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:20,032
Hey, Eamonn, you're not fooling
anybody. I can see you right there.

281
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,750
Yeah.

282
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,140
Curious that you recognize
the sound of my truck.

283
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,768
You been driving it recently?

284
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,627
Man, you are so literal.

285
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,379
[sighs] You got me there.
That's great detective work.

286
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,798
I didn't actually hear it.

287
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,985
This, uh, place has these
closed-circuit TV channels

288
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,179
[grunts] that show the
comings and goings at the gate.

289
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,156
Where is she?

290
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:04,434
Did you lose her?
After all that trouble?

291
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,494
Answer me, Walker.

292
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,455
I don't know where Gab
is. I didn't take her.

293
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,585
Took off after you
ambushed me, killed Trot.

294
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,962
That's not what happened,
and you know that.

295
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,550
You the sniper, huh?

296
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:23,429
You know, hiding in the woods
just like you were doing here?

297
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,641
For your sake, I sure as hell hope
you got a warrant this time, Walt.

298
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,500
I do not.

299
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:34,148
Walker invited us in, so
this is all perfectly legal.

300
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,382
Us?

301
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,676
You and Eamonn?

302
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,195
Are you two a couple now? [laughs]

303
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,865
Sheriff, I think this is
just a big miscommunication.

304
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,396
Well, we can straighten that
right out, can't we, Eamonn?

305
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,603
Escort this son of a bitch
back to Absaroka County.

306
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm not leaving.

307
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,624
You know what, scratch that.

308
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,605
- Arrest the sheriff.
- He hasn't done anything.

309
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,544
- Arrest him!
- There's no need.

310
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,890
Get up. Get off me!

311
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,333
You attacked me in my home,

312
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,020
and then you took Donna 'cause
you saw what she meant to me!

313
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,257
[sighs] I really like the
idea of hurting you, Walt.

314
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,558
I really don't give a shit
about hurting your feelings.

315
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,447
It was you! Say it! Get off!

316
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,973
All right, Longmire, that's it.

317
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,868
- You're under arrest!
- Say it!

318
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,227
- Say it!
- If I shot you, I would've shot you dead.

319
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,331
- I think you thought you did.
- Oh, I would've made sure.

320
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,377
[chuckles]

321
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,357
You may as well go, too,
Eamonn, you piece of shit.

322
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:04,238
I expect your resignation
on my desk inside the hour.

323
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,189
[Eamonn] He thought
that the she was Gab.

324
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,107
Yep.

325
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,568
So, he's a pretty good liar.

326
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,046
He is.

327
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:26,219
But this time... this time,
he's telling the truth.

328
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,890
He would've killed me
if he had the chance.

329
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,311
Why don't you come work for me?

330
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,340
Yeah, that sounds great.

331
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:44,403
Leap from one unstable, hostile
work environment to another.

332
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,699
But thanks for the offer.

333
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,231
[sighs] I'm sorry I got you fired.

334
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,359
Yeah, just a matter
of time before I left.

335
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,879
Hard to work for a
boss you don't respect.

336
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,758
You really should get that checked out.

337
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,429
You really don't want to bleed to
death in Sheriff Wilkins' county.

338
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,544
How was everything?

339
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,355
Eh, it was a little rare.

340
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,424
I am sorry to hear that.

341
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,527
I will let the kitchen know.

342
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,739
[grunts]

343
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,658
Hey, buddy, break it up!

344
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,742
Get down! Hey, back off! Back off!

345
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,276
- I'm making a citizen's arrest. Huh?
- Who the hell are you?

346
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:36,857
- Get off me!
- Shut up! Shut up, man!

347
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,815
Sir, please, just... just calm
down. I can call the sheriff.

348
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,336
No, no. No need. I got this.

349
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,921
Hey, you, come here.
Sweetheart, come here.

350
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,423
Come on! Get over here!

351
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,370
Here.

352
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,957
Zip his wrists up real tight, okay?

353
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,059
Don't move.

354
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,898
Jesus, come on, come on!

355
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,966
Come on, come on.

356
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,777
Okay, come on. Get up! Get up!

357
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,281
Stay back. Everybody,
stay where they are.

358
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,991
This'll be over real soon.

359
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,917
[Ferg] The abductor is a
male Caucasian in his 30s.

360
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,296
He is driving a red
pickup truck, Ram 2500.

361
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,797
You got any plate numbers?

362
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,425
County one-six,
license number four-two.

363
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,328
County one-six, license four-two.

364
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,992
Got it. Will you run
those plates for me?

365
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:36,636
That's what I'm doing. Hold on.

366
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,477
Ferg, this guy seems unhinged.
He might hurt someone.

367
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,768
I do not think it is wise
to wait for the cavalry.

368
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,022
I can run him off the road.

369
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,191
Don't, Henry.

370
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,819
Not until we know who we're
dealing with, which is...

371
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,321
Duncan Butler.

372
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,763
Holy shit. Are you sure, Ferg?

373
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,991
Truck was registered
to him just last year.

374
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,077
[siren wails]

375
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,665
- I don't know who you think I am...
- Look, I know who you are.

376
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,489
- I know what you did.
- I didn't do anything!

377
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,241
- Bullshit!
- Oh!

378
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,585
[tires screech]

379
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,623
- [grunts]
- Jesus, officer, watch where you're going.

380
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,174
I almost hit you.

381
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,657
Get on the ground!

382
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,759
Get out.

383
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,761
I got him! He can
tell us where Donna is.

384
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,204
Duncan, get on the ground!

385
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,681
Hey. Help me!

386
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,641
Hey! Stay back. This is police business.

387
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,094
- Get out.
- Let go of the hostage

388
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,404
and put your weapon down.

389
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,421
What? Oh, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

390
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,567
I arrested him, all
right? Citizens arrest.

391
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,361
[grunts]

392
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,804
- Duncan, what the hell is going on?
- He's the guy who took Donna.

393
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,491
- Which one of these guys is the bad guy?
- I don't know.

394
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,395
Oh, shit. I got him.

395
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,872
[grunts] Get down!

396
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,792
[Vic panting] Get down!

397
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,585
Okay.

398
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,820
[door closes]

399
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,044
Look, I don't know why you're
talking to me, all right?

400
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:53,647
Randal's the one who took Donna.

401
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,553
What makes you think that?

402
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,097
I've seen him hanging
around the parking lot,

403
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,683
waiting for Donna
after his group session.

404
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,687
Looking for a little, uh, one on
one time, if you know what I mean.

405
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,440
What were you waiting for?

406
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,567
Come again?

407
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,777
Were you waiting for
some one on one time, too?

408
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,804
No.

409
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,365
I was just looking after her is all.

410
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,950
Donna and me, we have a connection.

411
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,791
She has this ability...
see right through you.

412
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,568
Next thing you know, you're
just pouring your heart out,

413
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,963
feeling things you never felt before.

414
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,049
She's that good, why'd
you stop going to therapy?

415
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,678
You missed your last few appointments.

416
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,305
We had an awkward session.

417
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,683
[Vic] What exactly
happened at your session?

418
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,019
I brought her a stew.

419
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,901
I made it myself from
scratch from a rabbit I shot.

420
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,155
- Wow, you shot a rabbit?
- Right?

421
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,851
You know, I never cooked
that stew for nobody but Jean.

422
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:07,208
It was homemade, but she
just... turned it down.

423
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,941
How rude.

424
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,151
Right?

425
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,611
And instead of saying thank you,

426
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:15,072
she... she asked me

427
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,676
what I thought the nature
of our relationship was.

428
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,970
She went all robotic on me,

429
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,433
i-insisting that our relationship
was just doctor-patient.

430
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,703
- Like she was just toying with you.
- And that's not the worst part.

431
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:30,880
I missed a few sessions, and this
bitch sent me a... a bill, right?

432
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,190
Can you believe that shit?

433
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,611
- I'd have gone ballistic.
- I did.

434
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,155
I know.

435
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,160
[Walt] You recognize that beer bottle?

436
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,731
Red Stripe.

437
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,001
Only beer I know comes
in a bottle that shape.

438
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,860
I'm a Rainier man myself,

439
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,672
but they don't sell that in
bottles around here, so...

440
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,262
Not very useful for Molotov cocktails.

441
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,610
[Vic] And Duncan, before
you say another word,

442
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:08,431
you need to know that your boss
isn't backing up your story anymore.

443
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,586
We know that you don't have an alibi

444
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,410
for the time that that
van went up in flames.

445
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:14,555
Okay, okay. Okay, you got me, all right?

446
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,984
It's... [sighs]

447
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,529
I got anger issues.

448
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,014
Donna and I were working on that.

449
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:26,519
And I know it wasn't appropriate
to firebomb her truck.

450
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,788
I was upset.

451
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:34,235
I needed Donna to know that you
can't treat people like that.

452
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,714
You can't just... just brush me off.

453
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,511
That stew was homemade.

454
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,431
So, where is she, Duncan?

455
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,290
What?

456
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,725
I told you, Randal has her.

457
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,228
You just admitted to torching her van.

458
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,356
Yeah.

459
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,275
I torched her van, but I
wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

460
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,311
[Ferg] Hey.

461
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:11,021
I finally confirmed the
I.D. of Andrew Price.

462
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,649
He really is Donna's
son. I talked to her ex.

463
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,734
Okay.

464
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:19,614
Um, and his dad,
Donna's ex, is a lawyer.

465
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,325
He's pretty pissed that we're
holding his son without charging him.

466
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,034
You want me to charge him?

467
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,179
No. Uh, no.

468
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,333
Duncan just confessed to,
uh, firebombing Donna's van.

469
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,604
We'll see if that's all he's
done, but you can let Andrew go.

470
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,512
All right, make sure this is everything.

471
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,822
Sign here, okay?

472
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,356
- No, no, no, no.
- Hey, who's this?

473
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,608
My mom's old boyfriend?

474
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,992
You can show yourself out, Andrew.

475
00:28:56,993 --> 00:28:58,736
- You locking me up?
- Yep.

476
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,881
This is insane. What about this guy?

477
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,342
This guy's pressing charges!
I might even sue your ass!

478
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,844
[Ferg] Sit down.

479
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,681
Hey, Sheriff.

480
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,249
You probably should hear this.

481
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,207
[cell phone beeps]

482
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,251
[Donna] Hey, Andy.

483
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,478
It's Mom.

484
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,255
Uh, no big dealio. Just checking in.

485
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,089
Look, she never just checks in,

486
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,275
and I've never heard her
say "dealio" in my life.

487
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,863
Okay, I think something is,
like, actually, seriously wrong.

488
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,282
Call log says she called two hours ago.

489
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,934
I'll have the phone company trace it.

490
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,995
Here. Write down your number.

491
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,082
So, that call came in
while Duncan was in custody.

492
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,791
[keypad clicking]

493
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,570
Yeah, I'm with the Absaroka County
Sheriff's Department. I need a trace.

494
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,363
Yeah, I'll hold.

495
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,366
Hey, maybe Donna got access to a phone
after Duncan went to the Red Pony.

496
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,203
But if she was alone, why would
she feel the need to speak in code?

497
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,349
He only admitted to the
bombing, not the abduction.

498
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,058
So, maybe Duncan was telling the truth,

499
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,322
and the bomber and the abductor
are not the same person.

500
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:59,171
So, what, you think there's
a third person out there?

501
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,356
Nope.

502
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,528
Okay. You call me as soon
as that trace comes through.

503
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,365
[door closes]

504
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,309
[Vic] Tamar Smith was in the
hospital, Walt. She's got an alibi.

505
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,955
[Walt] For the bombing.
What about the abduction?

506
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,443
According to Donna, Tamar's
suicide attempt is related

507
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,796
to transference issues with Donna.

508
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,169
Think how she reacted when
she heard Donna was missing.

509
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,156
Nothing.

510
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,634
Yeah, and Duncan freaked out.

511
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,284
Right.

512
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:33,557
Tamar was more concerned that I
looked like her commanding officer.

513
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,501
[cell phone rings]

514
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,322
Hey, Ferg.

515
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,116
Yeah.

516
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,176
Okay.

517
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,515
Phone company confirms that
Donna's call came from here.

518
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,825
Vic.

519
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,745
Shit.

520
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,066
- I'm so sorry, Walt.
- It's not your fault.

521
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,776
She was here. I didn't see this.

522
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,487
- I didn't look here.
- At least we know she's alive.

523
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,965
We just got to figure
out where Tamar took her.

524
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,652
[man] Excuse me, ma'am.

525
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:11,145
- Looks like you could use a little air.
- Back up, asshole.

526
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,290
Whoa, take it easy, sweetheart.

527
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,699
I said back up.

528
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:17,995
God damn it! What the
hell's wrong with you?!

529
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,998
- I'm trying to tell you your tire's low!
- Do I stutter?! Back off!

00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,020
Let's go!

533
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:47,882
- [pounding on door]
- Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

534
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,817
Come on!

535
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,510
Hang on.

536
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,512
[Tamar] Let's go!

537
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:54,263
- Yes, okay, okay, okay.
- Now!

538
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,991
- Okay.
- Come on.

539
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,352
Yeah.

540
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,896
Yeah, we heard it on the evening news,

541
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:05,042
but you got to keep putting that
information out there until we find her.

542
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,461
Yeah, I appreciate it.

543
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,624
[man on radio] The Absaroka
Sheriff's Department

544
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,500
is looking for information
on the whereabouts

545
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,810
of local woman Tamar Smith,

546
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,002
a Caucasian in her early 30s.

547
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,689
Ms. Smith is wanted in conjunction
with the possible abduction

548
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,008
of Dr. Donna Monaghan
of Sheridan, Wyoming.

549
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,010

[radio shuts off]

553
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,410
You know you're not really a ghost.

554
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,139
You can't just run into traffic.

555
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,725
What are you doing out here?

556
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,273
I will not be needing this anymore.

557
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,820
- Why not?
- Because I will be in jail.

558
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,280
Are you backing out on our deal?

559
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,699
I am.

560
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,117
Take me to the feds.

561
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,286
Are you serious?

562
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,813
I will not be manipulated
or exploited anymore.

563
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,916
I would rather be back in prison.

564
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,085
All right.

565
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,903
If that's how you feel.

566
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,880
[Henry] It is.

567
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,324
And I am sorry.

568
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,886
I realize this puts you
in a difficult position.

569
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,221
Me? Why do you figure that?

570
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:48,645
You told me you were having a tough time
getting people on the Res to trust you.

571
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,860
I imagine that will
become even more difficult

572
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,529
when they learn that you are
the one that arrested Hector.

573
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,100
Do you think people will thank
you for sending their folk hero

574
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,410
to the white man's prison?

575
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,787
I am not so sure.

576
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,168
What do you want, Henry?

577
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,715
I would like to renegotiate
the terms of our arrangement.

578
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,994
[man on radio] The Sheriff's
Department is still asking residents

579
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,872
to be on the lookout
for Dr. Donna Monaghan.

580
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,958
The Sheridan resident has
been missing for three days.

581
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,979
The sheriff is also looking
for a silver Subaru Forester...

582
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,798
I'm so stupid.

583
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,443
The media's gonna twist this
into some kind of sex scandal.

584
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,719
They're going to say
I'm a crazy lesbian lover

585
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,470
who just fell off the deep end.

586
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,473
No, they won't because I won't let them.

587
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,893
I should never have let you
make that call to your son.

588
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,121
You let me make that call
because you care about me.

589
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,981
I know that.

590
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,625
And I care about you.

591
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:53,776

592
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,336
But now they're gonna come find me.

593
00:35:56,738 --> 00:36:00,950
Look, Tamar, I'm gonna say something
as a friend, not a therapist, okay?

594
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,785
I...

595
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,472
Don't you think that on some level,
you want this whole thing to end?

596
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,763
I mean, you have no escape
plan, there's nowhere to go,

597
00:36:09,764 --> 00:36:12,145
- there's nothing that you can do.
- I just need to think.

598
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:17,466
Look, let's just try to figure
a way out of this together, okay?

599
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:21,178
I think that we should go to the police,
and you should just turn yourself in.

600
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,764
I-I don't think it's gonna be that bad.

601
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,700
Look, I will tell them that
you were only trying to help me.

602
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,496
You will?

603
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,831
Yes.

604
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,484
So... [sighs]

605
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,295
Basically, I just have to trust you?

606
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,840
Yes.

607
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,326
Well, a few weeks ago in session,

608
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,721
you said that I was placing
too much trust in you.

609
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,765
Well, this is different.

610
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,396
It sure is.

611
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,069
How am I supposed to trust
you when you do shit like this?

612
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,177
I think this ends tonight's session.

613
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,857
- Where'd she go?
- Around the side of the building.

614
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,507
To use the bathroom, I guess.

615
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,759
Can we see that video?

616
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,593
I only got one camera,
and it's to keep people

617
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,137
from helping themselves to free gas.

618
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,115
I never thought I'd
need one on the restroom.

619
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,349
Do you know if this woman was alone?

620
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,684
I don't know anything about her.

621
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,229
She just went a little psycho on the guy,
and he came in here to tell me about it.

622
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,930
Before I could go out and talk
to her, she peeled off in the car.

623
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,168
Which direction?

624
00:37:58,318 --> 00:37:59,944
Uh, right on up the hill.

625
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:02,380
She went way faster
than the speed limit.

626
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,383
I suppose that's the
least of her crimes.

627
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:11,080
Man, those things are a pain
in the ass to fold back up.

628
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,664
- What are you looking for?
- Lake.

629
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,541
Pretty sure there's one nearby.

630
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,144
Foley Lake's right up that way.

631
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,186
Show me where.

632
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,296
Uh, right there.

633
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,215
What's so special about Foley Lake?

634
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,968
It's named for one of Custer's soldiers.

635
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,905
- Story is he had some relative...
- Tamar had a picture of a lake.

636
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,698
[Vic] Where?

637
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,497
At her house when we talked to her.

638
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,705
I didn't see it.

639
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,501
It came from the drawer.

640
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,128
Somebody's getting his memory back.

641
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,404
You think that's where Tamar's headed?

642
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,007
It's worth a look.

643
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,017
You really think there
are any houses out here?

644
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,519
[Walt] I see two docks.

645
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,046
One there.

646
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,982
One back there.

647
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,694
Chances are each one belongs to a house.

648
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,224
There's no boats at either of them.

649
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,518
We should probably
check them out anyway.

650
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:19,124
Let's just do a quick recon pass,
meet back up on the other side.

651
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,122
[Ferg] How do you
think he's really doing?

652
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,792
- Walt?
- He seems a little off.

653
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,395
Yeah, well, he got shot.

654
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,795
And hit in the head.

655
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,565
[sighs]

656
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,861
Just give him time.

657
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,745
[Ferg] Do you think
he'd even be able to deal

658
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,190
with having another
woman he cares about die?

659
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,126
Let's hope we don't have to find out.

660
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,488
Tamar!

661
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,033
Tamar!

662
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,761
You need to come out of there right now.

663
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,349
Come out slowly with
your hands over your head.

664
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,019
[Donna] Walt, it's me.

665
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:49,149
I'm okay, just drop your weapon.

666
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,176
Donna!

667
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,861
[Donna] Just please put the gun down.

668
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,515
You have to trust me.

669
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,326
Put down the weapon.

670
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,528
Okay.

671
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,047
I put it down.

672
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,571
[door creaks]

673
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,299
- Drop the gun!
- Drop it!

674
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,735
[Donna] Easy!

675
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:17,779
Everybody easy.

676
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,614
- I told you we couldn't trust him.
- I don't want to shoot,

677
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,825
but I will if I have to, now drop it!

678
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,995
Don't yell, Walt, okay?
Please just lower your voice.

679
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,606
You were supposed to
leave the gun outside.

680
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,441
- You lied to me.
- You shot me.

681
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,044
Was I supposed to trust
you? Now let Donna go.

682
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,672
- I can't let you hurt Dr. Monaghan.
- I won't.

683
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,882
- I'm trying to protect her.
- Bullshit!

684
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,790
Tamar.

685
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,460
I do not want to hurt
Dr. Monaghan or you.

686
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,688
But I also don't want you to hurt her.

687
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,423
Me?

688
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:55,924
I'm protecting her!

689
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,528
You shot her, and you kidnapped her.

690
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:03,199
T-To keep me from being raped, Walt.

691
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,559
You see, the other day when...
when... when you took me

692
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,228
back to my house to get some
things, Tamar saw us there

693
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:12,691
and she saw you, and she thought you
were big a-and threatening and macho,

694
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,253
and she just got very worried for me.

695
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,422
Do you understand what I'm saying, Walt?

696
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,514
Are you in love with Dr. Monaghan?

697
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,099
- See?
- No.

698
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,643
- Tamar.
- I told you.

699
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,439
- This is what everybody will think!
- No, no, they won't.

700
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,632
Walt, this is not about jealousy.

701
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,277
It is about trauma.

702
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,137
Tamar is a rape victim,
and you are triggering...

703
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,907
Shut up! No more!

704
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,158
Shut up!

705
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:50,229
There's a reason that
soldiers don't go to shrinks.

706
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,039
'Cause it just makes it worse.

707
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,668
I should've kept this to myself.

708
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,653
No.

709
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,756
But you opened me up, right?

710
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,533
And all the shit started
coming out of my head,

711
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,052
and it should've just stayed there.

712
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,265
Was it your C.O.?

713
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,102
Tamar?

714
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:17,422
The man in the picture that
you showed me who looks like me?

715
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,732
Did he rape you?

716
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:25,532
[breathing shakily]

717
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,334
He was supposed to protect us.

718
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,173
Off base, you know, where the enemy is.

719
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,742
[voice breaking] You
know, where the danger is.

720
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,804
Back on the F.O.B., it
was supposed to be safe!

721
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:56,604
But Captain... Frederick...

722
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,279
I never knew when he was gonna show up.

723
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,284
I'm not like him.

724
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,412
You don't know him!

725
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,664
You don't know what he's like!

726
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,667
[breathing shakily]

727
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,904
Dr. Monaghan, you say
that you trust this guy.

728
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,924
How well do you really know him?

729
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,384
Because I thought that I
knew my commanding officer,

730
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,953
but he had all the power,
and he used it against me.

731
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,665
And because of his rank,
nobody listened to me.

732
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,769
Why should I trust this guy?

733
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,590
You're right, Tamar.

734
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:43,067
You don't know me.

735
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,655
So, let's give Dr. Monaghan the power.

736
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,796
If you and me are both
trying to protect her,

737
00:46:50,797 --> 00:46:54,568
let's... let's let
her decide what to do.

738
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,125
Now, I want everybody to be safe.

739
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:04,421
So, I'm gonna give Dr. Monaghan my gun.

740
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,665
It's okay, Tamar.

741
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,435
You and I just wanted
Dr. Monaghan to be safe.

742
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,229
Now she is.

743
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,692
You've done your job.

744
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,528
Now you can go.

745
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,907
Nothing bad's gonna happen now, Tamar.

746
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,107
Uh...

747
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,092
Oh, yeah.

748
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,177
Wow.

749
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,054
[sniffs] If it makes
you feel any better,

750
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:14,933
I've never really used one
of these things anyway, so...

751
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,744
It, uh...

752
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,564
It does not make me feel any better now.

753
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,333
[gun clicks]

754
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,722
[Donna] I'm okay. I'm gonna be fine.

755
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,916
[Walt] You're okay.

756
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,686
[Donna] I'm okay. I'm okay.

757
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,127
- Thank you.
- You sure?

758
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,146
Yeah.

759
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,483
Listen.

760
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,428
You stay in here, and
you stay low, okay?

761
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,574
Yeah, okay.

762
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,205
Walt.

763
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,816
If you catch her, don't hurt her, okay?

764
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,526
She's... she's not a criminal.

765
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:09,296
She's just deeply traumatized.

766
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,258
Yeah.

767
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,185
[Walt] Tamar.

768
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,235
This was my grandpa's place.

769
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,114
It's the last place I felt
safe before I deployed.

770
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,450
Now I'm afraid to go out.

771
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,246
To sleep, even.

772
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,650
You've been through a lot.

773
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,944
So have you.

774
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,839
I'm used to it.

775
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,433
Where am I supposed to go, sir?

776
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:49,212
I can't function out there anymore.

777
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,648
Look at what I did to
you and Dr. Monaghan.

778
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:55,277
I'm hurting people.

779
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,699
That's not who I am.

780
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:02,744
Or who I was.

781
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,710
Cuff me.

782
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,089
I don't think that'll be necessary.

783
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,824
I don't trust myself anymore, sir.

784
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,760
Please.

785
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:43,242
When you tell your side of the
story, people will understand.

786
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:52,043
Can I just have a minute?

787
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,716
I just want to take one
last look at this place.

788
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,721
Try to keep one good memory in my head.

789
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,530
I'm so sorry.

790
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:24,741
What for?

791
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,351
I just... I seem to have a knack

792
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,372
for stirring up trouble in
other people's lives, and...

793
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,375
That's not how I see it.

794
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,382
[splash]

795
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,384
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Tamar!

796
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,096
[somber piano music plays]

797
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,107
[Donna] I don't see
her! I don't see her!

798
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,984
- Is that Walt?!
- Yes!

799
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,095
- What the hell is he doing?!
- He went in to save my patient!

800
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,655
She jumped in!

801
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,076
Shit.

802
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,744
Where is she?!

803
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,897
- No! Don't.
- She's there!

804
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,166
Wait, wait, Ferg.

805
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,046
Hold on to me. Hold on to me.

806
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,673
[grunts]

807
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,467
- Grab me. You got me?
- I got you.

808
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,594
[Ferg] She's gonna drown him!

809
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,679
- I got you.
- Okay.

810
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,306
Walt, reach for it.

811
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,766
Hold on to me. Get me. You got me?

812
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:32,976
- I got you.
- Grab it.

813
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,103
- [grunts]
- Oh, shit!

814
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,980
[Walt] Take her.

815
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,439
[oar clatters]

816
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,359
Come on. Take her.

817
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,611
[grunting]

818
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:50,619
[Vic] Ready? [grunting]

819
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,080
Ready? [grunts]

820
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,877
[music continues]

821
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,619
[Vic] Okay. Let me see if she's...

822
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,996
- Is she okay?
- No.

823
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,431
Pulse?

824
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,726
Nothing. Okay, put her on her side.

825
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,169
- Go on the side.
- Ready?

826
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,211
- Okay.
- Come on.

827
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,880
- Breathe, breathe.
- Walt. Walt.

828
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,882
- Come on!
- She's breathing, she's breathing.

829
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,234
Tip her up. It's all right.

830
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,177
Deep breaths.

831
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,362
Okay. Okay.

832
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,806
Okay. You're okay.

833
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:30,284
- [coughing]
- You're okay.

834
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,785
[Ferg] You're all right.

835
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,897
All right, okay. Just
take some deep breaths.

836
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:38,625
[panting]
