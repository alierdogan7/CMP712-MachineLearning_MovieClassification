1
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,493
Name?

2
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,930
Juliano dos Santos.

3
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,767
Father's name?

4
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:37,100
Don't know.

5
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:40,309
Mother's name?

6
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,214
Georgina dos Santos.

7
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:49,244
- Profession?
- Miner.

8
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:52,791
And before?

9
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,524
Before that I was nothing.

10
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,931
I boxed for money.

11
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:07,033
It says here
that you're some big shot.

12
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:10,199
Claim boss, gold smuggler,
drug trafficker.

13
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:14,739
I'm a miner sir.

14
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:19,983
You ever kill anyone?

15
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,053
You ever have anyone killed?

16
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:36,329
Are you related with
drug trafficking?

17
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:54,409
And the guy in the hospital,
he's in on the scheme too?

18
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:58,254
No, he's my friend.

19
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:04,024
<i>Serra Pelada breaks</i>
<i>a new record in production.</i>

20
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:07,099
<i>The mine located in southern Para,</i>
<i>where only last week</i>

21
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,896
<i>the larges gold nugget found</i>
<i>in Brazil for over 100 years,</i>

22
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:14,370
<i>is going to extract over</i>
<i>7 thousand kilos of gold this year.</i>

23
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:18,337
<i>The gold from Serra Pelada</i>
<i>reaches the Presedential Palace.</i>

24
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:22,947
<i>The two largest gold nuggets</i>
<i>found in Brazil.</i>

25
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:26,208
<i>The largest weighs</i>
<i>over 30 kilos</i>

26
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:30,823
<i>and is worth over</i>
<i>370 million cruzeiros.</i>

27
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,687
<i>The nugget worth</i>
<i>16 million cruzeiros</i>

28
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:36,057
<i>was put on exhibition today</i>
<i>in Belem in Para.</i>

29
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:41,291
<i>It weighs 7 kilos 400 grams and</i>
<i>was found last Sunday in Serra Pelada</i>

30
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,595
<i>by miner Lindomar Natal.</i>

31
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:50,736
<i>The nugget is 86% solid gold and worth</i>
<i>16 million 149 thousand cruzeiros.</i>

32
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:54,503
<i>Technicians from the Federal Savings</i>
<i>and Loans Bank confirm the information</i>

33
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:58,414
<i>given by the Minister of Mining and</i>
<i>Energy that this is the larges nugget</i>

34
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,586
But, why'd they fire you?

35
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:10,796
What'd you do wrong?

36
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:12,524
I didn't do anything.

37
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,968
They're cutting costs.
I wasn't tenured, I had to leave.

38
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,170
But, any way you look at it,

39
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,034
it doesn't make any sense trying to get
by on a public school teacher's wages.

40
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,837
I'm happy with you here,
with the way we live. Aren't you?

41
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,175
That's not the question, lzabel.

42
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:33,185
This is our chance.
I'm talking of gold, real gold.

43
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:37,316
Any gold nugget I find is worth
more than a whole year's salary.

44
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,984
I'm not going to stay here
by myself, Joaquim.

45
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,787
No way. You have a pregnant wife,
house installments to pay,

46
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,659
and you're going off,
running after some illusion.

47
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:48,097
Izabel I grew up in poverty, and I
don't want the same thing for my son.

48
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:50,830
- You can find a better job.
- No, I'm going to find gold.

49
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:01,674
AMAZON FOREST

50
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:11,506
The world's going to end and we still
won't have got to the fucking place.

51
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,751
Stop complaining Juliano.

52
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,121
This is the biggest gold
mine ever found in Brazil.

53
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:19,225
But it sure is fucking far away.

54
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:21,917
- Oh yeah? You wanta go back?
- Yeah.

55
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,686
Let's go Juliano.

56
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:30,531
<i>It was easy for Juliano</i>
<i>to leave São Paulo.</i>

57
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,969
<i>There was nothing there for him.</i>

58
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:35,732
<i>Just some debts and no options.</i>

59
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,571
<i>I left everything behind.</i>

60
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:51,453
BEGINNING OF MINE

61
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:09,802
Yeah professor, seems like
everyone read that newspaper

62
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:11,935
of yours and they all got
the same idea.

63
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,603
If they all came, it's because
there must be some truth in it Juliano.

64
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:20,652
<i>The news of the gold spread</i>
<i>through Brazil like wildfire.</i>

65
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:25,051
<i>In 10 days there were 30 miners.</i>
<i>In one month, over a thousand.</i>

66
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,106
You understand what
I was saying now big shot?

67
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:25,980
I understand now.

68
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,653
You see the size
of that thing?

69
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,223
Let's go get ours.

70
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,317
<i>In the beginning, the place was divided</i>
<i>up in around three hundred claims.</i>

71
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:38,227
<i>Each claim had an owner,</i>
<i>the CAPI TALIS T.</i>

72
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:41,289
<i>He was the one</i>
<i>who financed the mine.</i>

73
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:45,201
<i>The claims were called "dAMES".</i>
<i>And each dame had a king.</i>

74
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,637
<i>The Capitalists are king</i>
<i>of the Mountain.</i>

75
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:50,837
<i>The middle-class at the mine</i>
<i>is called "meia-praça".</i>

76
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,537
<i>They act like they own the mine,</i>
<i>but don't own jackshit.</i>

77
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:57,249
<i>They think they're the</i>
<i>Capitalist's partner.</i>

78
00:08:57,383 --> 00:09:00,546
<i>But, in the end, the only</i>
<i>thing they do is work for him.</i>

79
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:05,916
<i>The last guy on the supply</i>
<i>chain is the Ant.</i>

80
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:08,988
<i>Ant's spend their lives carrying</i>
<i>bags on their backs.</i>

81
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:11,290
<i>30 kilos of dirt and mud.</i>

82
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:26,772
<i>When a Miner finds gold,</i>
<i>he's called a "BAMBURRAdO".</i>

83
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,405
<i>They're the lucky guys who find</i>
<i>the gold everyone is talking</i>

84
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,414
<i>about at Serra Pelada.</i>

85
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,781
<i>Lot's of guys struck it</i>
<i>rich at the mines.</i>

86
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,411
<i>And a lot of stories about guys</i>
<i>who made fortunes</i>

87
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,750
<i>and then spent it all</i>
<i>in one day.</i>

88
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:40,356
<i>Like José da Silva,</i>

89
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:43,188
<i>who bought a different car</i>
<i>for each day of the week.</i>

90
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,861
<i>And Caboclo, for example,</i>
<i>when he struck it rich,</i>

91
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,094
<i>he decided to hire</i>
<i>a plane all for himself</i>

92
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:51,533
<i>and went to Belem</i>
<i>and the nightclubs.</i>

93
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:57,475
<i>Nego diamante never missed</i>
<i>a night at the Tropical,</i>

94
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,771
<i>one of the better known</i>
<i>nightclubs in Marabá.</i>

95
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:02,679
<i>He loved to slap his money</i>
<i>onto the dancers' asses.</i>

96
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:05,943
<i>What Nego couldn't imagine was</i>
<i>that when Serra Pelada closed down,</i>

97
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,815
<i>he'd be flat broke and</i>
<i>that dancer over there...</i>

98
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:12,085
<i>would become a successful</i>
<i>businesswoman in the capital.</i>

99
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:15,853
<i>But things changed real quick</i>
<i>at the mine.</i>

100
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,565
I'm gonna hit China soon.

101
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:30,605
- You miss São Paulo Juliano?
- Oh yeah.

102
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:32,606
Why don't you go back?

103
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:34,641
You think I'm crazy?

104
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:36,846
Your friend the loanshark
is waiting for you.

105
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,975
Precisely why I don't go back.

106
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:41,379
Come on big shot.

107
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:45,347
Let's get to work...

108
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:51,491
- Hi.
- Hi.

109
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:52,825
Everything OK?

110
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:55,026
- How's the rates today boss?
- They're good today.

111
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,675
400 grams.

112
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,869
Alright, I thought it was less.

113
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:07,807
Check to see
if anything's missing.

114
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:10,347
Better check right here,
if we have to complain...

115
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:26,031
There'll be food,
good grub with meat,

116
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,732
a hammock, place to sleep...

117
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:30,597
But, that's a lousy deal.
It ain't easy without a salary.

118
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:33,205
Yeah, but nobody's paying
2% around here.

119
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:35,297
Go look for yourself,
nobody'll give you that.

120
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:37,339
But they'll guarantee
you something at least.

121
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:40,341
But the other mines are paying
1% and we're paying 2%. The double.

122
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,747
That's the way it's gonna be here.
Take it or leave it, you understand?

123
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,717
Everybody will be happy when
we find gold. So?

124
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:51,223
Let's get to work?

125
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:54,015
Alright then.

126
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:56,391
OK. And if it were up to me,
we wouldn't be paying 2%.

127
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:58,657
It'd be 1, but the professor
here is a communist...

128
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:01,926
OK then. This is the deal:
2% with no salary. Right?

129
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,492
And another thing:
We'll give you a pair of sneakers,

130
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,501
shorts and 3 T-shirts.

131
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:08,631
Anybody get drunk and lose
his sneakers will work barefoot.

132
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,744
Now, let's get some rest.
Give me your papers.

133
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,275
Get some rest so
we can start tomorrow early.

134
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,680
See you tomorrow.

135
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,289
It's all working out, Big Shot.

136
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:28,155
You're too soft professor.
You're in Serra Pelada!

137
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:30,426
Listen,
I wanta tell you something:

138
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:37,535
We're going to get everything
we want, together.

139
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:41,535
A brother's pact.

140
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:46,969
Brother's pact.

141
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,375
<i>Big Shot had been my friend</i>
<i>since we were young.</i>

142
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,419
<i>We were a good duo.</i>

143
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:04,525
<i>Juliano had always been hot-headed,</i>
<i>always liked to give the orders.</i>

144
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,165
Josias, where's Mudinho?

145
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:18,599
He has to take these bags on up
by the end of the afternoon.

146
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,612
We don't think this
is right, no way.

147
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:30,449
Too much land for tool
few men.

148
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,121
- You talking to me?
- You deaf or something?

149
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,259
I said it's too much land
for only a couple guys to be working.

150
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,822
You took over this whole area while ther
are a lot of other people wanting to dig.

151
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,526
What you gonna do?

152
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:46,169
We didn't just take over buddy.
This claim is ours.

153
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:47,929
I have the deed.

154
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:50,632
The deed?

155
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,706
He has the deed to the claim!

156
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:58,849
The only good deeds are in the bible,
and the bible only has saints...

157
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,476
and I don't see
no saints around here.

158
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:03,282
What you want?

159
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:06,424
I want what everybody wants, man.
Land.

160
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:09,089
Land or blood.
Take your pick.

161
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,355
Let's settle this
some other way man.

162
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:13,624
We can talk this over...

163
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,757
Drop the knife and let's talk.

164
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:18,561
Juliano!

165
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:24,303
Come here!

166
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:33,785
That's enough.

167
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,008
Let's go.

168
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,679
Come on, quick!

169
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:29,167
What you assholes looking at?

170
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,838
Help me here man!

171
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,054
What you playing...

172
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:21,318
What's it called?

173
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:23,219
Fuinha.

174
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:24,895
Fuinha.

175
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:27,022
- Know how to play?
- No.

176
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:37,968
Thanks for saving
my life Big Shot.

177
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,856
I killed a man.

178
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,295
I never killed anybody before.

179
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,968
It wasn't your fault,
he started it.

180
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:21,276
I liked it.

181
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:30,521
Let me tell you something,
Big Shot.

182
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:33,930
Look at me.

183
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:41,529
This place brings out
the worse in us.

184
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:50,308
Just the way it is here.

185
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,778
That's the way things happen.

186
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,084
Here's to the "bamburrados"!

187
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,384
<i>One month later we struck gold.</i>

188
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:37,225
Happy now huh, professor.

189
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:38,853
Sure am!

190
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:42,129
Let's drink more
so our mine won't run dry!

191
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:44,362
<i>Me and Juliano struck it rich.</i>

192
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:46,798
Take another one.
Take another one.

193
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,805
My friend, my brother.
My friend, your brother.

194
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,141
Buddy and buddy,
Son of a bitch and son of a bitch.

195
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:09,083
<i>People began talking about</i>
<i>Serra Pelada all over Brazil.</i>

196
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:13,562
<i>Since its discovery in early 1980,</i>

197
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:18,636
<i>the mine at Serra Pelada has already</i>
<i>produced around six tons of gold.</i>

198
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:21,736
<i>It wasn't long before the government</i>
<i>took over the mine.</i>

199
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:30,947
<i>All gold was to be sold directly</i>
<i>to the Federal Savings and Loans Bank,</i>

200
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:33,843
<i>who paid a fair price</i>
<i>for the gold.</i>

201
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,886
<i>The government also set up</i>
<i>a health center for the miners.</i>

202
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:39,718
<i>But, on the other hand,</i>
<i>they prohibited women,</i>

203
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:43,056
<i>liquor and fire arms in the mine.</i>

204
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:46,158
<i>Lots of people didn't</i>
<i>like the changes,</i>

205
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:49,961
<i>but at that time everybody had</i>
<i>to dance according to the music.</i>

206
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,632
Izabel?

207
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:26,100
<i>Joaquim? It's been so long since</i>
<i>you last called. Over two weeks!</i>

208
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,063
How are you?

209
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:31,072
And the baby?
Is everything alright?

210
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:32,808
Yeah, everything is alright.

211
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:35,743
Listen honey, I have to tell you.
We found gold.

212
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:38,749
- Really?
- <i>Really. We struck it rich, honey.</i>

213
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:41,879
That's wonderful!
That means you'll be coming home,

214
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:46,718
<i>right Joaquim?</i>

215
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:49,417
I'll send you some money
as soon as I can.

216
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,794
- Aren't you coming home?
- <i>No.</i>

217
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:57,296
I'm not going honey, I can't go back now
that I've found gold.

218
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,760
I have to stay now.

219
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:01,897
<i>But, if you've already got some money,</i>
<i>you can come back, Joaquim.</i>

220
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:04,237
I'm not going back with
"some" money, no way.

221
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,835
I'm going back a rich man.

222
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:09,271
That boy of ours is going
to be rich.

223
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:11,110
But, honey, I need you here.
The baby's going to be born soon.

224
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:14,809
<i>No, I can't talk now,</i>
<i>I have to get back to work.</i>

225
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:16,717
I love you, lzabel,

226
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:18,922
I love you.

227
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:21,254
Very much.

228
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:48,081
Why don't you just shave it all off,
huh tough guy?

229
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,447
Because it makes me look
like a baby.

230
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:52,819
Always playing
the tough guy, huh?

231
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,090
<i>Fags were welcome here.</i>

232
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:58,687
<i>They were called the Marias.</i>

233
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:01,123
<i>In a place without any women,</i>

234
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:04,734
<i>the guys who couldn't control</i>
<i>themselves wound up adapting.</i>

235
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:08,838
<i>But not all the Marias were</i>
<i>sweet and delicate.</i>

236
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:12,440
Hi João.

237
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:19,281
I'll be right with you Marcelo.

238
00:22:19,385 --> 00:22:21,046
I ain't got all day.

239
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:24,417
I think that'll about do it,
shaky scissors.

240
00:22:25,824 --> 00:22:27,451
Get this off of me.

241
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,291
How much is it?
200 for the hair,

242
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,871
200 for the beard... here...
200 for being nice.

243
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,704
How's that?
Thanks, João.

244
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:52,150
<i>It didn't take long before Juliano</i>
<i>found out that the Maria he had killed</i>

245
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,519
<i>was Marcelo's big love.</i>

246
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:59,750
- What'll it be today?
- The whole treatment, João.

247
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,056
I'll make you look like
a million gal.

248
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,460
Shake that thing, Maria.

249
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:08,293
What's the matter,
you never seen it before?

250
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,028
I'll let you fuck me and I'll give you
a blow job. But don't go hassling me!

251
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:12,661
If you get me pissed off
I'll cut off your balls

252
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:15,501
and stick them down your throat,
you son of a bitch.

253
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:17,400
I've got my eye on you...

254
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:19,977
When you see me coming you look down
and ask for my blessing!

255
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,876
I've got my eye on you too!

256
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:30,083
Take it easy man,
you're too uptight.

257
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,885
Leave me alone.

258
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:39,094
Don't look so sour.

259
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:53,877
Come on, have a drink.

260
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:06,118
Let's go driver,
let's get this show on the road.

261
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,650
Won't fit anymore back here.

262
00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:33,946
<i>As the government had outlawed booze</i>
<i>and women at the mine,</i>

263
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:36,919
<i>the owners of the bars and</i>
<i>the whores had to go somewhere else.</i>

264
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:39,080
<i>A place 30 km. From the mine,</i>

265
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:42,682
<i>called the "30's"</i>
<i>where everything went,</i>

266
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:45,395
<i>the Las Vegas of the Amazon.</i>

267
00:25:23,268 --> 00:25:24,599
Look Juliano.

268
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,837
Look at that car.

269
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:28,735
You gotta have money
for a car like that, huh?

270
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,467
- You give discounts for virgins?
- Sure.

271
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,101
He's a virgin.

272
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:34,969
Go on, Professor.

273
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:39,048
Hey, Josias, the professor
struck it rich.

274
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:12,340
- It's loaded right?
- Yeah.

275
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:15,545
I'm screwed if it doesn't
have any bullets man.

276
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:18,216
Go on, take a look.

277
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,123
You really into this
thing now, huh.

278
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:28,660
Into what?

279
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:33,528
You going to go around
packing a gun now?

280
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,204
Professor, it's like this here,

281
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:37,602
either you give the orders
or you take them.

282
00:26:40,145 --> 00:26:41,806
And I'm not the kind
that takes them.

283
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,244
Come on, don't look so glum,
it's not all that bad here.

284
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,384
Let's have some fun,
go dance "forró".

285
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:32,492
Hey man, give me two more
of these here, please.

286
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:33,961
Thanks.

287
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:38,634
Holy shit.
Did you see that girl?

288
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,000
- What?
- No... don't look.

289
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:44,875
Look now. There, at the table with
the short guy, some big shot.

290
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:46,704
All dressed in gold.

291
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:49,946
Jeez, she's beautiful.

292
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:52,480
Beautiful was my mother,
that there is a goddess.

293
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:55,747
Let's just drink up these
two here and leave.

294
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,912
We've spent too much money
already.

295
00:27:58,123 --> 00:28:00,057
Stop talking about
leaving and money.

296
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:01,386
There's a saying at the mine:

297
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:04,452
Anybody who doesn't spend
their money with girls or booze...

298
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,195
Won't find any gold.

299
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,129
Won't find any gold.
Here's to us!

300
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,886
Well, I'm crazy then.

301
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:39,590
- Stay here professor.
- Watch your step Big Shot.

302
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:14,531
Hey!

303
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:19,927
A wildcat.

304
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,802
I like that.

305
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:34,028
Hey, what's going on here?

306
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:36,299
These two were fighting
outside sir.

307
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:37,807
And she wants to talk to you.

308
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,500
This macho man here was
trying to kill me.

309
00:31:39,711 --> 00:31:41,440
She was pawing some other guy.

310
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:43,410
And I had asked
her to marry me, sir.

311
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:45,641
I was going to marry this whore,
in the church and everything.

312
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,912
Why honey, you going to let a good deal
like that get away from you?

313
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:50,518
He's one big loser.
Doesn't have a penny to his name.

314
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:53,953
She took my gold, spent it all and
now she's going round with other guys.

315
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,389
She's gotta pay.
With her life.

316
00:31:57,462 --> 00:32:00,625
Yeah... two-timers are better dead,
you're right.

317
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:08,733
But, any guy that falls in love
with a whore deserves being two-timed.

318
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:11,802
Don't you think?

319
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:15,439
Listen Romeo,

320
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:18,311
take this money here
and go find some other Juliet

321
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:20,541
to ask her to marry you.
Go on!

322
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,387
He won't do anything
to you honey.

323
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:26,682
Go on now.
Get them out of here. Beat it.

324
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:29,187
Get that whore out of here.

325
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,563
Here's my precious nugget.

326
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:41,230
My diamond nugget.

327
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:46,835
How much is it to close
this place for a private party?

328
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:48,978
With women and drinks.
The whole place?

329
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:55,015
It's a deal.
The place is mine.

330
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:57,780
You can stay.

331
00:32:57,922 --> 00:32:59,651
You leave. You stay.
You stay too.

332
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:02,621
You there, you leave.

333
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:06,662
Hey partner,
let me stay, partner.

334
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:09,425
Partner?
I ain't got no partner.

335
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:10,996
I told you already, beat it.

336
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:14,904
Come on buddy, the girl got all
dressed up for tonight.

337
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,474
- Put on her best clothes...
- The place is closed.

338
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,577
Beat it.

339
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:23,209
- Just to stay here.
- I told you already, beat it.

340
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:25,880
Listen buddy, you struck it rich,
but you're not the only one.

341
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:27,917
How much is he paying you,
Ednardo?

342
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:29,350
15 grand.

343
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:33,355
Great. Listen partner.
Here's 20, just for you to leave.

344
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:37,285
You take your money
and leave.

345
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:40,421
Don't do this man,
you're wrong partner.

346
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,796
Hey partner.

347
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:45,564
Kiss my ass.

348
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:53,137
Why'd you do that for?

349
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:55,539
You shouldn't have done that.

350
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:01,846
What'd you do that for?

351
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:12,886
Why would anybody do that,

352
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:17,967
everybody drinking...

353
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:21,305
I'll leave this here for you,
OK Ednardo,

354
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,405
leave this for you.

355
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:28,136
No need for him to have done that,
none whatsoever.

356
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:34,879
That guy scare you?

357
00:34:40,158 --> 00:34:42,956
No need for that,
totally unnecessary.

358
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:55,806
You're the one who killed my man,
didn't you, you sack of shit?!

359
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,167
- Yeah, I'm the one.
- So now it's your turn to die.

360
00:34:58,209 --> 00:34:59,767
Oh yeah,
and who's going to kill me?

361
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:01,311
Who's going to kill me, you?

362
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:03,744
I'm going to kill you,
you can be sure of it.

363
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:04,972
Drop the knife.

364
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:07,040
I'll get you when
you're least expecting it.

365
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:09,517
- Drop the knife.
- I'll get you, you sack of shit.

366
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:10,684
Let's go, Maria.

367
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:12,815
Juliano listen to me!
Listen, let's go.

368
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:14,357
You're swearing you're going
to kill me, is that it?

369
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,527
Yeah, that's a promise,
son of a bitch.

370
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:20,430
That's enough! Let's go!

371
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:24,227
You see what it's like here, professor,
this is the way it is here.

372
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,136
<i>And like they say:</i>
<i>During the day it's the "30's",</i>

373
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,571
<i>at night "38's".</i>

374
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,961
When you coming to live
with me, sweet pea?

375
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:57,557
- I've already got my man.
- Who, the midget?

376
00:35:58,536 --> 00:36:00,970
I'm engaged to be married, Juliano.
I'm getting married in one month.

377
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:03,870
What you going to marry
him for? His money?

378
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:06,273
- Yeah.
- I have money too.

379
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:08,971
It's not just that.
He takes care of me.

380
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:11,305
You want a father,
or a husband?

381
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,345
I can take care
of you too Tereza.

382
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:17,987
You sound like some miner
who just struck it rich.

383
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,887
Wildcat.

384
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:22,853
I don't trust men, no way.

385
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:25,527
For me, you and the midget
are just the same.

386
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:28,689
Yeah, but he's a midget.

387
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:48,277
Hey buddy,
any letters for me?

388
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:51,116
- What's your name?
- Joaquim Francisco Souza da Silva.

389
00:36:57,562 --> 00:36:59,029
Thanks.

390
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:23,650
"It's a girl!"

391
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,163
- Thanks buddy.
- For nothing.

392
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:52,307
<i>Things at the mine got better</i>

393
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,412
<i>and me and Juliano started</i>
<i>finding lots of gold.</i>

394
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:05,255
<i>The only father my daughter had</i>
<i>was the check I'd send every month.</i>

395
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:08,758
<i>But it wasn't enough.</i>

396
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:11,559
<i>I wanted more money.</i>

397
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:21,273
<i>And Juliano wanted more power.</i>

398
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,055
- Did you talk to Juliano?
- No.

399
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,351
I'm the one giving
the orders here today.

400
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:08,422
Nobody is going to die
on my claim, no way.

401
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:11,323
Listen up everybody.
I've got something to tell you.

402
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:15,425
Due to the landslide over
at the "milharinha" claim,

403
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:17,792
you get the day off today.

404
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:20,064
Joaquim, Joaquim,
no way,

405
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:22,163
you can't go giving
these guys a day off.

406
00:39:22,273 --> 00:39:24,104
What are you going to do with
the two guys who died up there then?

407
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,233
They died. They've gone up to heaven,
we keep on working here.

408
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:27,811
And how we supposed
to get to the top?

409
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:30,279
We'll go the long way around,
go up "Goodbye momma".

410
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,039
And who's going
to be responsible for that?

411
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,708
I'll be responsible, if anybody
has to be. I'll be responsible.

412
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:35,877
Well then you can be responsible
for this too then.

413
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:37,318
He's the responsible one now.

414
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:38,753
Joaquim I don't know how
to do this shit here, no way.

415
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:40,153
You can learn then.

416
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:41,983
Josias, you keep track here.

417
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:44,151
Josias, my ass. Shit.

418
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,488
Listen man, some son of a bitch
dies everyday here.

419
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:49,191
What you gonna do?
Hold mass, send the widow flowers?

420
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:51,197
Have a funeral? Don't be stupid.

421
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:53,533
Let's get moving, the shovelers
shoveling, the carriers carrying...

422
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:54,797
let's get working.

423
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:57,473
- You're going to be responsible for this.
- Yeah, I know.

424
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:59,803
You assume all the fucking
consequences.

425
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:02,071
Put it in that little notebook
of yours. Let's get working.

426
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:04,078
I hope you know what
you're doing.

427
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:17,519
<i>Gold was shipped out of Serra Pelada</i>
<i>by the official route,</i>

428
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:20,958
<i>with a police escort</i>
<i>to the airstrip.</i>

429
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,968
<i>But it was still being taken out</i>
<i>another way too...</i>

430
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:32,438
<i>Juliano began playing the game.</i>

431
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:35,912
<i>He'd sell gold to the smugglers.</i>

432
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:39,409
<i>Guys who would take the gold</i>
<i>over the border.</i>

433
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,815
<i>And anybody smuggling</i>
<i>didn't smuggle just one thing.</i>

434
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:46,118
<i>The car that took the illegal</i>
<i>gold took drugs, guns...</i>

435
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:55,964
<i>The ants did the hard work,</i>

436
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:01,261
<i>but the guys who got rich</i>
<i>were another group...</i>

437
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:05,303
<i>and it was this group</i>
<i>that Juliano wanted to be part of.</i>

438
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:10,070
<i>The criminal organization headed</i>
<i>by Carvalho was in charge</i>

439
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:13,742
<i>of dozens of gold mines scattered</i>
<i>around the Amazon area.</i>

440
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,644
- I'll sink the 12 ball.
- Nope.

441
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,315
Sure I will.

442
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:24,490
If I sink the 12 ball,
what'll I get?

443
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:26,757
My asshole.

444
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:32,691
- And if I don't?
- What'll you give me?

445
00:41:33,938 --> 00:41:35,405
The world.

446
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:44,710
- How many tries do I get?
- One.

447
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:53,988
Beer.

448
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,824
Well I'll be, if it isn't
the guy with the tiny claim?

449
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:02,923
Tiny claim? Alright.

450
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:05,499
I want to buy it.

451
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:11,607
I wasn't really thinking
about selling man.

452
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,375
No?

453
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,705
Everything is for sale
in this world.

454
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:20,477
I've already bought
all the claims around yours.

455
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:22,378
I've heard...

456
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,310
Tell him the names
of all my claims.

457
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:53,479
Babylonia,

458
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:56,484
Old Plain,

459
00:42:57,788 --> 00:43:00,484
Black Rock,
Milharina,

460
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:04,751
Igrejinha,
Malvinas,

461
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:10,030
Tight Pussy...

462
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:15,806
Widow's Hole,
Catarina...

463
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:19,468
X eréu, Nigger's Head,
Yellow House,

464
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,940
I know all your claims.

465
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:24,974
Yours is the only one
I don't have.

466
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:27,851
You've got a lot of claims,
don't you sir.

467
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:30,115
What you want so much gold for?

468
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:40,328
Our claim ain't for sale.
Joaquim...

469
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:43,498
Thanks for your hospitality sir.

470
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,760
I'm not going to sell
my claim to that guy.

471
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,729
It's not just your claim,
Juliano.

472
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:15,923
Why do you think
he wants our claim?

473
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:19,161
I don't know. All I know is
that claim is running dry.

474
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:20,727
But he knows there's
more gold further down.

475
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:22,999
He's the type of guy who has
geologists working for him,

476
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:24,598
he pays them to study these thing.
He knows, Joaquim.

477
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:26,302
And what do you know
about shit like that?

478
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,741
You didn't even hear
the guys offer.

479
00:44:27,878 --> 00:44:29,573
I didn't hear it because
I'm not going to sell anything

480
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,908
to that son of a bitch.

481
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:32,538
You're blind man,
completely blind because of that girl.

482
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,675
We could both be rich
with the money he pays us.

483
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:37,613
Is that your problem?
You want to be rich?

484
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:39,450
Yeah, I want to be rich.

485
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,050
I want to get back to lzabel,
to my daughter, back home,

486
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:45,720
lzabel is has been
a saint up to now...

487
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,855
No, lzabel hasn't been no saint,
no, you know what she is,

488
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:50,462
I'll tell you,
lzabel is a single mother.

489
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:52,633
You watch your mouth...

490
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:54,898
It's no use arguing with me,
no use for us to fight.

491
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:57,766
All I have to say is this:
There's more gold further down.

492
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,775
Lots of gold Professor.

493
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,082
I've had enough.
I want to get out of this place.

494
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:11,281
This place brings
the worst out in everybody.

495
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:17,416
I'll take whatever
I can get for that claim.

496
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:27,167
So, this is what we do then...
we'll dig for a while more,

497
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:29,833
if we don't find gold,
we'll sell the claim,

498
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,773
you take your money and leave, go be
happy with your wife and your kid.

499
00:45:32,877 --> 00:45:34,845
Because I'm going to stay.
I ain't leaving.

500
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:36,503
I thought we were
in this together.

501
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,807
We were, but you don't have
ambition Professor!

502
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:40,439
I sure as hell do.

503
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:42,313
Well then, yours is
a lot different than mine.

504
00:45:42,353 --> 00:45:44,218
That's where the problem is.

505
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:48,483
OK, we'll do it your way then.

506
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:50,286
I know.

507
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:22,057
Come on over next to me,
come on.

508
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,153
I can't do this anymore,
Juliano

509
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:28,593
What'd you come here
for then?

510
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,931
I came to tell you that.
I can't take it any more.

511
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:34,300
Don't be stupid.
Come here...

512
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:39,401
I can't do this to him.

513
00:46:39,477 --> 00:46:42,275
Tereza, you can't do this to me.

514
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:50,676
Come here now.

515
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:54,157
If you're here just to waste
my time, go on back then.

516
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:56,623
Go on back to your midget,
I saw the way he respects you,

517
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,387
spreading your legs like
that right in front of me.

518
00:46:58,562 --> 00:46:59,824
Shut up.

519
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,964
I won't put up with no whore
hitting me in the face like that.

520
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,033
No whore, because that's what you are,
a whore. A two-bit whore.

521
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:05,498
That's what I used to be.
A slut.

522
00:47:05,636 --> 00:47:07,570
But you don't go shooting off
the mouth about Carvalho.

523
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:09,866
You don't know anything about him.
You don't know anything about me.

524
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:12,771
He took me out of the whorehouse
when I was 13 years old.

525
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:16,873
Everything I got I owe to him.
I like him.

526
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,918
I'm going to marry him.

527
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:26,112
You're going to marry him.
Go ahead and marry him.

528
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:28,555
I'm going to marry him.

529
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:31,320
Marry him, go ahead.

530
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:33,989
I'm going to marry him.

531
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:42,170
I'm going to marry him.

532
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:01,290
Hello.

533
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:04,490
I came to check out
my claim personally.

534
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:06,357
This claim isn't yours.

535
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:08,831
No?

536
00:48:09,466 --> 00:48:12,299
I don't remember having made
any deal with you.

537
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:17,465
Well my boy, everybody here
is standing on gold.

538
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:21,372
The only problem is finding out
where it'll surface.

539
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:24,642
And that's why I bought
all the claims around here.

540
00:48:25,316 --> 00:48:27,011
I bought Milharina,

541
00:48:27,418 --> 00:48:30,751
Widow's Hole,
Pedra Pedra,

542
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:35,016
I bought Tight Pussy...

543
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,660
The same thing again, huh?

544
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,831
You didn't even hear
my offer, boy.

545
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:53,900
And I don't intend to. There's gold here.
I ain't selling anything, no way.

546
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:57,209
We're not interested
in selling, sir.

547
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:04,687
Well I guess we'll have
to be good neighbors then, right?

548
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:09,825
Because everything, everything,
everything around you...

549
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:13,856
is mine.

550
00:49:19,003 --> 00:49:20,994
Don't listen to him Juliano.

551
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,747
You don't know if it was him,
Juliano.

552
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:10,249
I know it was him.
You know it was him.

553
00:50:10,354 --> 00:50:13,187
- And he knows it was him.
- You're just jealous. You blind?

554
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:17,123
You going to stand there and defend
a guy who's out to get me...

555
00:50:17,227 --> 00:50:19,821
- Who tried to kill me?
- You don't know if it was him.

556
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:25,361
- And how do you know it wasn't?
- Nobody knows who did it, Juliano.

557
00:50:25,436 --> 00:50:27,404
There's no way we can know.

558
00:50:32,376 --> 00:50:35,243
Learn how to lie better.
You're going to have to choose.

559
00:50:35,312 --> 00:50:38,247
Look at me, you're going to have
to choose Tereza.

560
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:43,351
You're going to have to choose,
you hear me?

561
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,839
What's happening to you, Juliano?
Are you crazy?

562
00:51:46,216 --> 00:51:48,081
He was going to kill us.

563
00:51:52,923 --> 00:51:55,790
- You've turned into an assassin.
- And you into a chickenshit, Joaquim.

564
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:59,226
Why? Because I don't go
around killing people?

565
00:52:04,768 --> 00:52:06,565
- Assassin.
- Chickenshit.

566
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:16,878
<i>After Carvalho was killed,</i>
<i>power switched hands.</i>

567
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:40,426
<i>Juliano took care</i>
<i>of all his enemies.</i>

568
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:43,603
<i>Some by his own hand,</i>

569
00:52:45,676 --> 00:52:47,541
<i>others by destiny.</i>

570
00:52:48,946 --> 00:52:53,144
<i>AldS had found its way to Serra Pelada</i>
<i>and the Marias were blamed.</i>

571
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:56,980
<i>The Marias were all kicked out</i>
<i>of the mine.</i>

572
00:52:57,287 --> 00:53:00,017
<i>Among which was Marcelo,</i>

573
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:03,984
<i>who had always been talking</i>
<i>about killing Juliano one day.</i>

574
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:12,292
Let me go,
I'm a working man, let me go!

575
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:14,130
Keep moving.
Shut up.

576
00:53:15,138 --> 00:53:17,538
- João Maria stays.
- And why's that?

577
00:53:18,342 --> 00:53:20,435
Because he cuts my hair.

578
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:23,637
And because
of my automatic pistol here.

579
00:53:25,282 --> 00:53:27,216
Beat it João Maria.

580
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:32,286
You'll have to disappear
for a while.

581
00:53:32,823 --> 00:53:35,155
Everybody is out
of their mind here.

582
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:24,103
Let's go,
get down from there.

583
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,407
Let me go, shit.

584
00:54:38,555 --> 00:54:41,115
What the fuck you doing
in this whorehouse?

585
00:54:41,525 --> 00:54:43,254
I'm working.

586
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,351
You ain't no whore
to be working here.

587
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:47,120
Yes I am.
You forget?

588
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:50,731
You ain't no whore.
You're my girl.

589
00:54:51,768 --> 00:54:54,566
My girl, Tereza, my girl.

590
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:01,576
- Let me go.
- What?

591
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:07,640
Only Northern Chapel
doesn't have any shares for sale.

592
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:10,179
But over here... Babilonia 1,
Babilonia 2, Malvinas...

593
00:56:10,347 --> 00:56:12,178
all of them are up for sale.

594
00:56:13,283 --> 00:56:14,682
Lindo...!??

595
00:56:15,986 --> 00:56:17,283
Lindo Rico.

596
00:56:17,387 --> 00:56:18,752
Lindo Rico!
I forgot man...

597
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:21,390
I knew it was some kind
of singer's name,

598
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:25,392
I just could remember.
This here is the Claim's Market.

599
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:26,726
Which I put together...

600
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:29,596
Me and... Joaquim.

601
00:56:29,966 --> 00:56:31,831
Why don't you get him some coffee?
Coffee... Get him some...

602
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:33,197
A cup of coffee.

603
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,337
Fresh, just made, go ahead,
get him some...

604
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:40,572
And, it's like I say,
you put money in the claim,

605
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:43,837
you'll be buying a share, a percentage
of what the claim produces.

606
00:56:44,014 --> 00:56:47,108
Like if the claim produces
100kg of gold, 1 kg is yours.

607
00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:51,014
Well let's just imagine...
partner...

608
00:56:52,723 --> 00:56:56,659
I buy a claim,
a percentage of a claim,

609
00:56:58,428 --> 00:57:00,328
and the claim I buy into is dry.

610
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:02,091
Man if you find a claim in
Serra Pelada

611
00:57:02,232 --> 00:57:04,132
that doesn't give you any gold
you show it to me,

612
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:05,997
because I've never seen one.

613
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:08,797
But, it's the same old story,
an investment is always a risk.

614
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:10,631
A guy can have some bad luck.

615
00:57:10,674 --> 00:57:12,869
But you won't be putting
your money into only one claim.

616
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:25,212
The question isn't if it'll produce
gold, but when the gold will be found

617
00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:27,119
and that means digging.
Let's start digging?

618
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,885
I'll think it over
and give you an answer.

619
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:33,285
Great, that's it then.

620
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,792
Who's coming with me?
Maranhão?

621
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:36,796
- But, it's a great idea.
- I know.

622
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:45,707
Partner.

623
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,714
I was just thinking here about
what your boss said.

624
00:57:52,816 --> 00:57:55,011
Who?
Juliano isn't my boss, no way.

625
00:57:55,152 --> 00:57:57,950
He's my business partner.
We've been friends since we were kids.

626
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:04,383
I've been here two years now.

627
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:08,288
I've got claims, "damas",
the whole bit.

628
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:11,629
And I see that when people
start making money...

629
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:13,460
He's your friend...

630
00:58:14,037 --> 00:58:15,595
good guy.

631
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:18,172
The way he talked to you back there,
I thought that...

632
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:22,711
- What are you talking about?
- I don't like that.

633
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,176
- You don't like what?
- That, what I said.

634
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,375
- The way he talked?
- Of what I said.

635
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:31,879
That's your problem.

636
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:35,657
It's his problem, partner.

637
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:45,034
How'd you like to work
with me?

638
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:45,830
No, no thanks.

639
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:49,202
I'm not talking about you being
my errand boy, to get coffee and shit.

640
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:51,534
No way. I'm talking about
you being my partner.

641
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:53,735
For real.
I can see that you...

642
00:58:54,444 --> 00:58:56,571
I don't want to work with you.

643
00:58:56,746 --> 00:58:58,680
You don't like money?

644
00:58:59,983 --> 00:59:02,213
You don't like money, huh?

645
00:59:05,622 --> 00:59:07,249
Think it over.

646
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:09,887
I'll be here...

647
00:59:10,427 --> 00:59:12,088
you'll look me up.

648
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:17,891
I'll be around...

649
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,890
It's two in the morning.
What are you doing here?

650
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,598
I came for a little talk, brother.

651
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,693
To show you
a little piece of paper.

652
01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:29,595
Joaquim Francisco Souza da Silva.
That's you, isn't it?

653
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:38,775
So professor,
I'm the dumb guy around here.

654
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:40,744
I don't know
how to read no books.

655
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,909
But there's one thing
I know how to do, numbers.

656
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:44,919
What you want Juliano?

657
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,451
- You robbing from me, Professor?
- No.

658
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:49,751
I'm your partner, you forget?

659
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,291
You're robbing me you clown.
What's your plan?

660
01:00:51,494 --> 01:00:52,825
Grab the money and run?

661
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:54,826
I'm going to take my part
and get back to my family.

662
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:56,557
That's what I'm going to do.

663
01:00:58,068 --> 01:01:00,366
Show me the money, Professor.

664
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:07,237
I can't believe you're doing this.
Put that gun down.

665
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:10,379
Get me the fucking money, Joaquim.

666
01:01:10,814 --> 01:01:12,213
Go on, move it.

667
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:33,829
- This money here is mine.
- Put it on the table.

668
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:39,001
You want to go back to São Paulo,
go on. But the money stays here.

669
01:01:39,142 --> 01:01:43,340
Now, if you want to work for me,
I need a good accountant.

670
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:45,706
I think you might be
the right person.

671
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:47,578
Your business is illegal,
you know that, don't you?

672
01:01:47,717 --> 01:01:49,844
There's some guys in Marabá
who take care of that part.

673
01:01:49,953 --> 01:01:53,480
But I need someone here.
I need you.

674
01:01:59,963 --> 01:02:01,726
Brother's pact.

675
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:07,999
You know what's best.
It's either this or nothing.

676
01:02:08,104 --> 01:02:11,972
Starting tomorrow, at the claim,
you don't work there anymore.

677
01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:54,682
Juliano, where's my money?

678
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:56,880
- What money?
- The money you stole from me.

679
01:02:56,953 --> 01:02:58,079
I didn't steal your money.

680
01:02:58,254 --> 01:03:00,415
Yes you did, and I want my money.
Where is it?

681
01:03:00,757 --> 01:03:02,520
I think you've been out
in the sun too long.

682
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:04,182
You're the one who stole me,
Joaquim.

683
01:03:04,294 --> 01:03:06,728
- I'm your partner, where's my part?
- That's where you got it wrong.

684
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:08,490
You're not my partner anymore.
You robbed me.

685
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:10,428
This claim isn't yours anymore,
the house isn't yours,

686
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,430
our partnership is over.

687
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:13,192
It's over?
Yeah right, asshole!

688
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:15,200
Son of a bitch! Shit!

689
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,137
Fucking traitor.
Clown, chiseller.

690
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:21,973
Stick the knife in,
Josias, go ahead!

691
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:24,172
Get him out of here.
Beat it man.

692
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,474
Traitor.

693
01:03:25,715 --> 01:03:27,478
Got no ambition.

694
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,911
You haven't heard the end
of this.

695
01:03:45,735 --> 01:03:48,898
<i>Serra Pelada turned into the biggest</i>
<i>concentration of manual labor</i>

696
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:51,131
<i>ever since the pyramids in Egypt.</i>

697
01:03:51,307 --> 01:03:53,366
<i>The only difference was</i>
<i>that the miners</i>

698
01:03:53,576 --> 01:03:56,272
<i>built an upside-down pyramid.</i>

699
01:04:00,216 --> 01:04:04,277
<i>Serra Pelada, which used to be a hill,</i>
<i>turned into a hole.</i>

700
01:04:05,622 --> 01:04:09,353
<i>Over 60 thousand men moved</i>
<i>the mountain from its place.</i>

701
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,661
This is no toy.

702
01:05:55,999 --> 01:05:58,092
Sit up straight
and close your legs.

703
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:15,749
You looking at that
guy over near the counter?

704
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:17,644
What?

705
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:20,085
That clown over near
the counter.

706
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,589
You think I'm like that midget
with the horns.

707
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,687
I'm not looking at anyone,
no way.

708
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:29,297
That clown over near the bar.

709
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:34,369
- You think I'm stupid?
- No, I think you're crazy.

710
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:37,770
Stay put.
You, beat it.

711
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:45,611
Go on asshole, beat it.

712
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:07,161
Juliano, what'd you do?

713
01:07:09,739 --> 01:07:10,831
What?

714
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:13,671
What'd you do to that
guy that was there.

715
01:07:13,776 --> 01:07:15,937
I removed him from my sight.

716
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:17,533
<i>Let me go!</i>

717
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:21,274
Let me go!

718
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:23,572
Aww, my little runaway...
Let her go.

719
01:08:25,214 --> 01:08:27,705
- Let me leave, Juliano.
- No.

720
01:08:28,618 --> 01:08:30,882
Why do you want me around?

721
01:08:31,187 --> 01:08:34,213
I don't like you anymore.
You don't like me. Let me leave.

722
01:08:34,323 --> 01:08:37,520
You kidding with me, Tereza?
You trying to piss me off?

723
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:41,387
You're only leaving when
I say you can go.

724
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:43,460
And I don't want you
to go right now.

725
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:47,593
I don' t like you anymore.
Let me leave. It's over.

726
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:53,265
Let's go home.

727
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:03,041
Get my bag.

728
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:05,974
You crying?

729
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:10,412
Don't go pouting like that,
it's your fault.

730
01:10:11,053 --> 01:10:12,645
It's my fault?!

731
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:14,881
I didn't tell you
to run away...

732
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:18,457
It's your fault, Juliano.

733
01:10:20,062 --> 01:10:23,088
You're all alone now.
Everybody left you.

734
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:24,957
Who's all alone?
The place is full of people.

735
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:27,433
Wake up Juliano.
There's nobody left here.

736
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,935
You're the loneliest man
in the world.

737
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:39,775
- I pity you.
- I don't need your pity.

738
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:44,517
Where's your friend?

739
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:47,019
Didn't you have a friend?

740
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:55,497
Where's your friend, Juliano?

741
01:10:58,267 --> 01:11:00,735
You're all alone, huh?

742
01:11:01,304 --> 01:11:03,204
Where's your friend?

743
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:09,943
- That's it, hit me.
- Shut up.

744
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:13,075
- Where's your friend?
- Shut your mouth.

745
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:16,013
Shut the fuck up.
You think I won't kill you, huh,

746
01:11:16,052 --> 01:11:18,816
you two-bit whore? You think
I won't kill you?

747
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:21,252
You think I'm scared
of killing you?

748
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:55,218
Go on beat it.

749
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:58,089
Get on with your life.

750
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:05,443
Ice!

751
01:14:15,965 --> 01:14:18,798
That was fantastic.
Clap your hands.

752
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:20,629
I like that song a lot.

753
01:14:20,703 --> 01:14:23,797
Here, one grand for every time
you play that song.

754
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:29,300
One, two... play it again.

755
01:14:29,478 --> 01:14:32,038
Just that song.
Go on...

756
01:14:34,183 --> 01:14:36,174
You two, sit down.

757
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,452
There's a guy singing here,
show some respect...

758
01:14:40,589 --> 01:14:42,989
- Go on, play it again.
- You're the boss.

759
01:14:57,306 --> 01:14:59,968
I know. You play only
that song tonight.

760
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,517
Go on, sing, shit!

761
01:15:14,156 --> 01:15:16,090
That was better huh...

762
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:18,490
One more time.

763
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,594
<i>Malaria was pretty common</i>
<i>at the mine.</i>

764
01:16:39,742 --> 01:16:45,305
<i>Malaria fever was</i>
<i>like gold fever.</i>

765
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,934
Pull!

766
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,596
<i>I almost died that night.</i>

767
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:51,504
<i>After the fever had gone,</i>
<i>my dream came true.</i>

768
01:17:59,688 --> 01:18:01,781
Hey.
Here you go buddy.

769
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:10,490
I'm leaving now.

770
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:13,892
Hold it a second,
I'll get the money...

771
01:18:15,004 --> 01:18:16,164
OK.

772
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:50,561
Thank you.

773
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,206
I'm leaving.
I'm going to see my family.

774
01:18:56,745 --> 01:18:58,076
Thank you.

775
01:20:33,308 --> 01:20:35,139
Joaquim!

776
01:20:42,017 --> 01:20:43,678
Can I sit down?

777
01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:47,854
What happened to you Joaquim?

778
01:20:52,828 --> 01:20:55,456
Go buy yourself some candy.

779
01:21:02,037 --> 01:21:03,834
Juliano robbed me.

780
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:05,768
Ohh.

781
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:08,308
I had struck it rich and
I was leaving.

782
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:11,035
Now, I'm back to zero.

783
01:21:11,213 --> 01:21:13,204
You sure it was him?
It might not have been him.

784
01:21:13,382 --> 01:21:15,873
- This place is full of crooks.
- Lf it wasn't him, who was it then?

785
01:21:17,619 --> 01:21:20,247
Cesinha, what is it that
I'm always telling you.

786
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:22,322
Tell him, go on...
Trust... tell him.

787
01:21:22,424 --> 01:21:26,758
When these guys got here, they were
the biggest buddies, like brothers.

788
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:30,087
Didn't I tell you?
Juliano is screwed.

789
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:32,663
You were the one who supported
that asshole.

790
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:34,893
You have to come work with me.

791
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,402
I told you that before.
I don't know what you want.

792
01:21:37,573 --> 01:21:39,939
I just want to teach him a lesson.
I want him to pay.

793
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:47,547
You know Eduardo Ramos,
the sheriff over in Marabá?

794
01:21:47,749 --> 01:21:48,909
No.

795
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:51,915
I've known him since I was a kid,
I'm the one who got him his job.

796
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:57,921
If you want to help...
He'll be really grateful.

797
01:21:58,994 --> 01:22:01,588
- What do I have to do?
- Aren't you the bookkeeper?

798
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:06,726
Joaquim, this here is Marcelo.

799
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:10,367
Joaquim is going to tell you
exactly what you have to do

800
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:12,406
when you get there.
Pay attention.

801
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:16,009
You have to get a cashbook that
is in a bookkeeping firm in Marabá,

802
01:22:16,211 --> 01:22:18,111
on Remedios St.

803
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:22,409
You the bookkeeper?

804
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:23,915
We want Juliano's book.

805
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:25,381
Is this guy here the bookkeeper?

806
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:27,684
The cash book,
from inside the safe.

807
01:22:29,758 --> 01:22:31,919
Go on honey,
get the fucking book.

808
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:34,391
If I don't have any patience
with guys, imagine with women.

809
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:37,293
You know where it is.
Go on get it, quick.

810
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:40,232
You know it's in the safe.
Move it bitch!

811
01:22:40,769 --> 01:22:42,760
A black book
with orange corners.

812
01:22:42,838 --> 01:22:44,772
We have this one here...

813
01:22:44,906 --> 01:22:46,897
- Black or orange?
- Black with orange corners.

814
01:22:46,942 --> 01:22:49,240
They'll try to give you another one,
but don't let them.

815
01:22:49,378 --> 01:22:50,779
You trying to fool me
son of a bitch!

816
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:53,839
Get me the fucking book, fast, if not
I'll shoot your face full of holes.

817
01:22:54,016 --> 01:22:56,780
It's inside the safe.
The black one with orange corners.

818
01:22:56,885 --> 01:22:58,250
That's it.

819
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:02,057
- Any questions?
- No.

820
01:23:02,057 --> 01:23:04,082
You want me to make
a drawing for you?

821
01:23:05,761 --> 01:23:08,059
Let's go!
Don't try anything stupid!

822
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,068
Hey, what do I get?

823
01:23:17,005 --> 01:23:18,666
Don't you want revenge?

824
01:23:18,774 --> 01:23:21,834
That's my own business.
How much do you think I deserve.

825
01:23:26,615 --> 01:23:28,583
Greedy.

826
01:23:29,751 --> 01:23:31,480
That's life.

827
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:37,754
DUDINHA!

828
01:23:39,628 --> 01:23:41,926
This chocolate is great,

829
01:23:41,997 --> 01:23:44,397
only it all melts in this
fucking heat.

830
01:23:51,006 --> 01:23:54,999
Here. This is for you to be
awarded cop of the year.

831
01:23:56,678 --> 01:23:59,306
Don't forget that I'm the one
who gave it to you.

832
01:24:00,115 --> 01:24:02,777
Trophies don't fill
anyone's belly.

833
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:16,354
And what about this?

834
01:24:16,665 --> 01:24:19,498
Can you eat this?
Can you?

835
01:24:19,634 --> 01:24:23,297
Can you feed your face
with this, huh asshole!?

836
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:26,406
Can you eat this, you fat ass.
Can you eat this?

837
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:29,911
This here...

838
01:24:47,763 --> 01:24:50,061
- How's your wife?
- Alright.

839
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,660
- And the kids, alright?
- Yeah, just fine.

840
01:24:56,204 --> 01:24:58,399
The important thing is health,
isn't it?

841
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:05,842
Get the book there.

842
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:13,480
Hold it close.

843
01:25:17,893 --> 01:25:20,191
Where'd you buy this chocolate?

844
01:25:20,562 --> 01:25:22,291
Here in Marabá.

845
01:25:24,466 --> 01:25:26,559
It's good, only it melts.

846
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:35,638
Boss, you know
who ratted on us, right?

847
01:25:35,944 --> 01:25:39,175
It was your buddy, the professor.
He's in cahoots with Lindo Rico.

848
01:25:39,781 --> 01:25:41,214
Lindo Rico.

849
01:25:41,316 --> 01:25:43,307
Juliano, we've got to get out
of here, right now.

850
01:25:43,418 --> 01:25:44,680
It's all over.

851
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:46,753
There's an airplane on the airstrip
waiting for us. Let's go.

852
01:25:46,855 --> 01:25:48,220
No.

853
01:25:53,295 --> 01:25:55,661
<i>And when the smugglers</i>
<i>and the big shots realized</i>

854
01:25:55,864 --> 01:25:59,391
<i>that everybody was going down,</i>
<i>they started knocking off everybody.</i>

855
01:26:23,325 --> 01:26:26,556
Put some music on,
for everyone to dance.

856
01:26:44,045 --> 01:26:46,878
I was the one who gave them
the cashbook.

857
01:26:47,782 --> 01:26:50,182
- I know.
- You here to kill me?

858
01:26:50,318 --> 01:26:52,013
No, it's an idea,
but I have a better one.

859
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,179
- I came to get you out of here.
- Fuck off, Juliano.

860
01:26:54,322 --> 01:26:56,256
I was already leaving
this fucking place.

861
01:26:56,424 --> 01:26:58,915
But you stole my money.
You stole my dream!

862
01:26:59,661 --> 01:27:01,856
You had them stick me up after you
found out I had struck it rich.

863
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,557
What are you talking about?

864
01:27:03,665 --> 01:27:05,292
- You going to tell me it wasn't you?
- Of course it wasn't me.

865
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,300
And you're going to tell me
that you believe in Lindo Rico,

866
01:27:07,402 --> 01:27:08,926
in the son of a bitch
who wants my place?

867
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:10,628
Do you know what he's going to do?

868
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:12,637
He's going to come here and kill
both you and me.

869
01:27:15,243 --> 01:27:16,642
Let's get out of here Professor.

870
01:27:16,678 --> 01:27:19,875
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Let's get out of here professor.

871
01:27:20,048 --> 01:27:21,845
I'm not going anywhere with you.

872
01:27:22,017 --> 01:27:23,882
You crazy?
They'll be here any minute.

873
01:27:29,858 --> 01:27:31,849
Listen to me you piece
of shit, listen.

874
01:27:31,927 --> 01:27:34,452
I promised your wife
I was going to get you out of here,

875
01:27:34,563 --> 01:27:36,656
take care of you...
and that is what I'm going to do.

876
01:27:36,731 --> 01:27:38,665
You're leaving with me.
We got into all of this together,

877
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,891
and we're going to get out of
it the same way.

878
01:27:41,036 --> 01:27:43,027
- Let me go!
- We're leaving this place together.

879
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:48,503
Shit Professor.

880
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:16,769
- Were you the one who robbed me?
- No. I didn't rob you.

881
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:34,417
You ruined my life, Juliano.

882
01:28:34,956 --> 01:28:38,756
I know,
but you fucked up mine too.

883
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:48,493
Stupid!

884
01:28:57,245 --> 01:28:59,213
Come on,
let's get out of here.

885
01:28:59,581 --> 01:29:01,014
Hold it...

886
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:24,299
Can you walk? Go, go...

887
01:30:18,626 --> 01:30:20,389
It's over Juliano.

888
01:31:07,675 --> 01:31:09,506
Hey driver,

889
01:31:09,778 --> 01:31:11,507
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.

890
01:31:28,463 --> 01:31:33,093
<i>In a way, leaving Serra Pelada</i>
<i>was harder than leaving São Paulo.</i>

891
01:31:36,504 --> 01:31:41,134
<i>Chasing after a dream is</i>
<i>always easier than letting it go.</i>

892
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:47,309
<i>But, if there's one thing the mine</i>
<i>knows how to do</i>

893
01:31:47,415 --> 01:31:50,384
<i>is teach you to face reality.</i>

894
01:31:54,022 --> 01:31:57,981
<i>What each person chooses to do</i>
<i>in face of reality varies a lot.</i>

895
01:31:59,394 --> 01:32:03,160
<i>And it is this choice which</i>
<i>determines who you really are.</i>

896
01:32:16,644 --> 01:32:20,910
<i>And my choice,</i>
<i>I already knew what it was.</i>

897
01:33:34,489 --> 01:33:36,389
How you doing at school?

898
01:33:37,358 --> 01:33:38,655
Alright.

899
01:33:38,726 --> 01:33:39,988
Alright.

900
01:33:42,397 --> 01:33:44,490
What's your favorite food?

901
01:33:47,068 --> 01:33:49,730
- Rice and potatoes.
- Rice and potatoes?

902
01:33:50,405 --> 01:33:52,669
Like that?
Like those?

903
01:33:55,476 --> 01:33:57,307
Pass them would you honey.

904
01:34:05,353 --> 01:34:08,345
And the guy in the hospital,
he in on the scheme too?

905
01:34:08,456 --> 01:34:10,048
No.

906
01:34:10,658 --> 01:34:12,683
He's my friend.

907
01:34:21,035 --> 01:34:23,230
Last question miner.

908
01:34:23,404 --> 01:34:26,840
How much are you willing
to pay to get out of here?

909
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:51,289
Thank you.
