1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,881
[Snoring]

2
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,701
[Knock on door]

3
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:31,869
MAN:
Mr. Goodnight?

4
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,070
[Knocking on door]

5
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:37,673
Mr. Goodnight,
I have a 9:00 appointment!

6
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:43,056
GOODNIGHT:
Yeah.

7
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:45,147
[Knocking continues]

8
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:48,523
Mr. Goodnight,
I have a 9:00 appointment!

9
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:50,721
Yeah, just a minute.

10
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:53,732
I'll be right with you.

11
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:59,462
Yeah.

12
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:02,233
- You're Goodnight?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:04,367
Morgan, right?

14
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:08,403
Come on in.
I'll be right with you.

15
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:10,210
I'll be with you guys momentarily.

16
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:12,352
[Door closes]

17
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:19,755
I was expecting
someone a little more, um...

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,260
Lawyerly?
Yeah, I can't say I blame you.

19
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:26,626
Thing is, I was up all night
on a case.

20
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,894
No cause for concern.

21
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:31,800
You'll get your money's worth,
I assure you.

22
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:36,740
So, uh, it's true you've never lost
a trial?

23
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,537
So far.

24
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:41,912
What can I do for you?

25
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:43,606
Um, I need a patent.

26
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:45,411
So, you're an inventor?

27
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,953
I'm just an ordinary man
with an idea.

28
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:51,615
Well, every man is ordinary
until he does an extraordinary thing.

29
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,960
Right.

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,960
May I speak frankly?

31
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:57,359
Of course.

32
00:01:57,464 --> 00:02:02,834
I'm not entirely sure if my invention
is 100% original.

33
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:08,997
Well, Shakespeare borrowed
all but three or four of his ideas.

34
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:10,576
That puts you
in pretty good company.

35
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:12,308
[Clears throat]

36
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,403
Uh, excuse me.
I'm in a meeting here.

37
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:17,278
John William Goodnight,
you're under arrest.

38
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:18,508
For what?

39
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:21,348
For disturbing the peace,
public drunkenness,

40
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:22,922
illegal gambling,

41
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:26,720
and destruction of property...
rooms 13, 47, and 49,

42
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:28,158
The Drake Hotel.

43
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:33,790
That, yes. Well, I will take care
of those damages right here.

44
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,902
[Sighs]

45
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:40,034
So, um...

46
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,903
Uh, Mr. Morgan, I'll be in touch.

47
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:43,737
Okay.

48
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:44,902
You Goodnight?

49
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,343
Stand aside.
This man's under arrest.

50
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:49,039
Not anymore.

51
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:59,787
GOODNIGHT:
You wanted to see me, sir?

52
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:02,123
Do you know why you're here?

53
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:06,092
I have a few ideas,
most of them unpleasant.

54
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:09,497
I believe the word
is "unprofessional."

55
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:11,261
I can't argue with that.

56
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:12,303
Tell me...

57
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:15,863
do you like being a lawyer,
Mr. Goodnight?

58
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:19,707
Well, sir, while I-I have
a great deal of respect for the law,

59
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:24,716
I can't, uh, I can't say the same
for lawyers, myself included.

60
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:26,379
And why is that?

61
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:30,115
For a lawyer,
justice is inconsequential.

62
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:31,656
Victory is paramount.

63
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,291
Mm.

64
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:36,021
And you are tired of winning?

65
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:41,695
Well, you can be happy to know that

66
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:44,302
your winning streak
has come to an end.

67
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:48,864
You will no longer be practicing law
in the state of Illinois.

68
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:51,034
Are you, uh, taking away my license?

69
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:53,145
No.

70
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:54,770
Not quite.

71
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,083
Put your hand on the Bible.

72
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:07,991
It is with the power vested in me
by the President of the United States

73
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:10,995
that I hereby appoint you,
John William Goodnight,

74
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:15,123
to the position of Circuit Judge
in the Wyoming Territory...

75
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:17,830
...where you can continue
to demonstrate

76
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:21,135
your respect for the law,

77
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:25,075
and perhaps find
some respect for yourself.

78
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,439
Do you accept?

79
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,541
Do I have a choice?

80
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,877
[Chuckles]
No.

81
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,332
[Sighs]

82
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:01,672
You know what I
will miss the most?

83
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:05,945
Looking out there
at all that land and sky

84
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:07,952
knowing it once was ours.

85
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:16,819
We could sell my ring.

86
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:20,032
You've already given up enough.

87
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,828
We all have.

88
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:23,897
It could buy us another month.

89
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:27,531
Another month without rain
ain't gonna grow those crops.

90
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:31,407
Besides, there are some things
that ain't to be sold.

91
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,668
Like what?

92
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,206
A wedding ring.

93
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:38,944
And a man's soul.

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,622
We did our best out here.
There will be other times.

95
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,652
I know.

96
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,923
Grab your things.
Don't want to miss the stage.

97
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,101
You keep hold of that, Johnny.

98
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:59,433
You don't let it break...

99
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,200
okay?

100
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,837
I got to go.

101
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,256
YOUNG GOODNIGHT:
Where's the stagecoach?

102
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:26,093
MR. GOODNIGHT:
This town doesn't have one, son.

103
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,532
We'll ride out on this
and catch a stage in Laramie.

104
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:38,376
We got enough for candy?

105
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,497
- Can I help you?
- How much for candy?

106
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:03,693
How much you got?

107
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:09,637
- Grab a handful.
- Thank you, sir.

108
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,372
I always go for the peppermint.

109
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:17,510
SHOPKEEPER: [Chuckles]
On your way, Judge?

110
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:19,084
Worn out my welcome, I think.

111
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:22,154
Well, not in my book. That piece
of dirt deserved to be hanged.

112
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:24,223
I hope so.

113
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,252
Looks like we'll
be traveling together.

114
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,520
Aldous Shaw, Circuit Judge.
My wife, Rebecca.

115
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,026
William and Anna Goodnight.

116
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,155
- Pleased to meet you.
- JUDGE: Where you folks headed?

117
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,562
- John.
- Oh.

118
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,194
[Chuckles]

119
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:40,636
- Where are you folks headed?
- Back east.

120
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,004
I'm afraid we just didn't
get lucky out here.

121
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:44,736
Droughts one year, floods the next.

122
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,971
Don't feel bad.
This is a hard country.

123
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,844
I've seen a lot of good people
come and go.

124
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,614
A true man is someone
who does right by his family,

125
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:54,346
no matter where that takes him.

126
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,277
Thank you, sir.

127
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:59,081
- Fred.
- Judge.

128
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,122
Rebecca.

129
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,726
SHOPKEEPER:
John.

130
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:20,007
Mrs. Goodnight.

131
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:24,882
MRS. GOODNIGHT:
Do you have children, Mrs. Shaw?

132
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:25,973
MRS. SHAW:
Sadly, no.

133
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,716
With the judge gone so much,
we just...

134
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:32,986
Well, no child should grow up
without a father.

135
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:36,718
Though I often wonder
if we made the right decision.

136
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:38,693
Oh, I'm sure
you're blessed in other ways.

137
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,056
That we are.

138
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,330
Still, looking at your boy,

139
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:46,371
I can't help but think
what we've missed.

140
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:47,769
He's a good boy.

141
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,209
- He's very handsome.
- Yes.

142
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:52,503
Is that a six-gun?

143
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:54,635
Yes, it is.

144
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:56,211
You a good shot?

145
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:57,371
Not bad.

146
00:08:57,483 --> 00:09:01,510
I shot a can off a fence post
with my pa's Winchester.

147
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,449
Son, with a gun like that,
he's not shooting at cans.

148
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:11,457
You ever kill anyone?

149
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,256
Son, watch your manners!

150
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,163
No, it's a fair question.

151
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,667
I have killed,
to uphold the law,

152
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,138
and when you
pull a gun like this,

153
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,503
chances are someone's
gonna be shooting back.

154
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,942
A man has to figure out
what he's willing to sacrifice

155
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,082
in order to do
what he knows is right.

156
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,480
I never met anyone
who talks like you.

157
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:36,282
Well, when a person's life
is in your hands,

158
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:38,084
you owe it to them to be
as good with your words

159
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,715
as you are with a gun.

160
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:44,088
So, if you don't shoot them,
you can talk them to death?

161
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,992
[Laughter]

162
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:48,329
What's got into you?
Apologize to the judge. Go on.

163
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,197
JUDGE:
No, not necessary.

164
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,205
You know who said almost
that very same thing to me?

165
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,738
Abe Lincoln.

166
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,365
You met President Lincoln?

167
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:58,340
We rode circuit together
back in Illinois,

168
00:09:58,444 --> 00:09:59,968
before he was president.

169
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,471
Looks like you live
a charmed life, Judge.

170
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,515
[Horses approaching]

171
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:05,845
Looks can be deceiving.

172
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,588
Driver, bandits!

173
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:10,587
Who are they?

174
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,658
I hanged one of their men
back in town.

175
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:16,227
I'm afraid they're looking
for blood, not justice.

176
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:17,660
[Gun cocks]

177
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:19,058
[Gunshot]

178
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,894
- Get down! Get down!
- On the floor!

179
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,432
JUDGE:
Faster, driver, faster!

Hyah! Hyah!

183
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:49,819
JUDGE:
Hold on!

184
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:50,987
Mary!

185

[Screams]

186
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,899
MAN:
Mr. Goodnight...

187
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:05,241
The Governor's offices
are closing now.

188
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,480
[Door closes]

189
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,924
Where on Earth did you
find tulips in autumn?

190
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:24,721
Well, it wasn't in
the Wyoming Territory,

191
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:27,391
I can tell you that.

192
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:29,961
So, you saw the Governor?

193
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,300
- He's different than I thought.
- More talkative, I imagine.

194
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,067
Oh, yes, he's
a real chatterbox.

195
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:38,974
In fact, I'm pretty sure he told me
everything you wanted him to.

196
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:41,842
He always was very good
at taking directions.

197
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,441
Better than me, you mean.

198
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,150
You're angry with me, John.

199
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,353
It's just that the Wyoming Territory

200
00:11:57,463 --> 00:12:00,660
is the most dangerous,
lawless place in America.

201
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:04,498
The last three judges there
met with an untimely death.

202
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:07,470
You're just as likely to meet with
one here, the way you've been living.

203
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:14,207
You know, I always hoped
you might settle down,

204
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:17,282
raise a family of your own...

205
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:21,751
...but you haven't, and you won't...

206
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:25,149
...not here, not like this.

207
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:31,563
Because beneath all
that fast talk and fancy clothes

208
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:34,460
and big-city manners,

209
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:38,560
you're still the same tortured boy...

210
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:43,838
...and I fear you will never have
peace until you have justice.

211
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:46,739
It's been my blessing
to raise you, John.

212
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,473
The blessing is mine.
You gave me a life.

213
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:53,848
You lost your parents,
I lost my husband,

214
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:55,443
but we have each other.

215
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:02,355
Now, go out there

216
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:03,986
and find that killer.

217
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,462
Make him pay.

218
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,590
There's no guarantee I'll find him.

219
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,395
He may be dead already.

220
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:12,027
That will save you the trouble, then.

221
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,434
Just remember, there's a difference
between justice and revenge.

222
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,237
Aldous knew that.

223
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:21,177
And when the time comes...

224
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,406
...you'll know it, too.

225
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,415
Will I?

226
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,716
Because after all this time,
I still dream about killing him.

227
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:32,023
I do, too.

228
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:36,150
But there are
bigger dreams to have.

229
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:49,304
This is the knife that killed Aldous.

230
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:52,210
[Horse neighs, gunshot]

231

This is for hanging my friend, Judge.

238
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:57,836
These are yours now.

239
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:03,841
Aldous carried this gavel
for 20 years,

240
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,036
calling order in every manner
of court you can imagine.

241
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:11,549
He always said you needed order
to respect the law,

242
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:16,679
and the sound of this gavel
in his capable hand

243
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:19,685
would bring that order.

244
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:29,924
Some people do not heed
the call of the gavel.

245
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:34,436
They come reluctantly to justice.

246
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,774
And for those
who require it a little more,

247
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:44,544
that same capable hand
would guide them...

248
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:48,652
...with this.

249
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:01,796
Oh, John.

250
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,330
Good luck.

John William Goodnight presiding.

254
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:30,120

???
...

256
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:33,992
Yes?
What seems to be the problem?

We have a bathtub problem.

260
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,467
Yeah, a big problem.

261
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,798
Bathtub?

262
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,033
- That's right.
- Yeah.

insists on taking his bath first,

265

and he's so dirty
that, by the time it's my turn,

266

the water's so filthy, I might as well
go bathe with the pigs!

Well, she's so big

268
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,585

by the time she's done,

there's no water left!

270
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,820
Have you considered
the possibility

271
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,659
of taking your baths
on different days?

272
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,527
Huh?

For instance, Ma'am,
you take your bath on a Monday.

on Wednesdays.

[Gavel bangs]

289
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,267
It's been my experience

290
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,638
that people who exhibit
such open contempt for the law

291
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,472
have generally just broken it.

292
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:54,469
Well, I ain't done nothing wrong.

293
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,945
Section 94
of the Wyoming Legislature

294

prohibits public spitting.

295
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:01,146
That's 3 days in jail and a $1 fine.

296
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,221
So, you're gonna jail me for spitting?

297

Son, your incarceration will be
a result of your own stupidity.

298

Now, I'm gonna read
the charges off this docket.

299

which other ones you're guilty of.

Stealing chicke...

304
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,573
Stealing chickens?

305
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,605
You know, I could maybe forgive that
if it were one chicken,

306
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,406
but you stole eight chickens,

307
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,447
and from a widow, no less.

308
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,175
He did that, Judge.

you to replace the birds...

a sharp lookout.

you might be interested in.

One of my girls is on trial.

338
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:29,961
You know, for what they pay me,
I could use a little extra cash...

339
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:33,036
...and I have been known
to do things I shouldn't...

340

...but unfortunately for you,
I don't take bribes.

and unprovoked act

356
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:55,745
has rendered me unable
to use my right hand,

357
00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:58,846
preventing me from exercising
my duties at the bank

358
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:02,484
and causing my wife
undue anxiety.

359
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:03,685
I see.

360
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:08,233
So, it is your testimony, then,
that she stabbed you for no reason.

361
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,356
That's right.

362
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:15,065
Sit down and tend to
your heinous and unprovoked wound.

363
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:20,409
Miss Landry,
did you stab Mr. Jones?

364
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:21,637
Yes.

365
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:24,178
But I had to.

366
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:25,875
I didn't know how else
to make him stop.

367
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:28,509
- Stop what?
- He attacked me.

368
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,450
Oh! That's a lie!

369
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:34,117
Look, I may be a lot of things,
but a liar isn't one of them.

370
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,922
You were drunk, and you waited
for me outside the saloon,

371
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:38,188
and you tried
to take advantage of me,

372
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:39,559
and when I said no,
you hit me!

373
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:40,824
I did no such...

374
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:48,006
I did no such thing.

375
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:50,905
I am a pillar of this community.

376
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:53,773
Thank you very much
for reminding me.

377
00:23:53,912 --> 00:23:56,506
I'm ready to render a verdict.

378
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:59,175
Whenever I've
had to stab someone,

379
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:02,776
it's, uh, usually been
in the gut or the chest,

380
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:08,086
but Miss Landry here, she appears
to be a very robust young woman.

381
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:11,754
Now, if she had wanted to inflict
a more serious level of damage

382
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,397
on Mr. Jones,

383
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:15,091
it seems to me apparent
that she could have.

384
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,966
She could have stabbed him
in a more dire place, for example.

385
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:21,004
Instead,

386
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:25,839
he appears here today in this
courtroom with a wound on his hand.

387
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:29,812
It appears to be
a defensive wound.

388
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,552
While I find there is often reason
to stab a drunk man,

389
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:37,121
there is never good reason
to hit a woman.

390
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,586
Miss Landry, the charges are
dismissed, and you're free to go.

391
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:45,992
Mr. Jones, you're also free
to go... home with your wife,

392
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:47,291
and when you get there,

393
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,493
check your kitchen knives
and make sure that they're dull,

394
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:53,230
in the very likely event
that she may want to stab you, too.

395
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:54,804
[Gavel bangs]

396
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:56,065
What about my hand?

397
00:24:56,508 --> 00:24:58,305
Use the other one.
Next case.

398
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,809
[Gavel bangs]

399
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:15,589
I thought you didn't take bribes.

400
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:19,355
If it happens after the trial,
it ain't no bribe.

401
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:44,221
What's going on?

402
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:47,690
Murder trials are pretty popular
around here.

403
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:50,057
I'm sorry to hear that.

404
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:56,432
He hated my father
because of the color of his skin.

405
00:25:56,535 --> 00:26:00,596
He said he'd kill him if he ever
stepped foot in his restaurant again.

406
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:04,767
When was the last time
you saw your father?

407
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:08,005
About two weeks ago.
My baby brother took sick.

408
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,580
Papa went into town
to fetch him some milk.

409
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:12,911
He never came back.

410
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:19,123
And do you have reason to believe
that he went to Mr. Ayles' restaurant?

411
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:22,716
BO Y: It was a Sunday night.
Everything else was closed.

412
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:25,263
When was your father found?

413
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:31,093
The next morning,
hanging from a tree by the creek.

414
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:38,207
I'm, uh, sorry that I have to ask you
these painful questions, Isaack.

415
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,912
It's just water.

416
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,384
You want me to drink
from your cup?

417
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:52,419
Go ahead.
I'm not contagious.

418
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,538
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

419
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:15,239
Now, Isaack, I want you
to think really hard here.

420
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,639
Did you or anyone that you know of

421
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,184
actually see your father
with Mr. Ayles

422
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:23,254
on the day that he disappeared?

423
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:25,045
No, sir.

424
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,587
Anyone in this courtroom?

425
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:34,593
[Raised voice] Does anyone in this
courtroom have any knowledge

426
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,262
of Mr. Ayles committing
bodily harm or injury to Mr. Samuels?

427
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:48,576
Son, this is a court of law.

428
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,148
We require proof that a man
has committed a crime

429
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:52,841
before he can be punished.

430
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,189
You may sit down.

431
00:28:03,562 --> 00:28:05,757
Harlan Ayles,
you're accused of murder.

432
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:08,424
- How do you plead?
- My client is innocent.

433
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,933
And with all due respect,
these proceedings are a farce.

434
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:13,663
A man is dead.
I'd call that a tragedy, not a farce.

435
00:28:13,772 --> 00:28:16,366
This is a trial with no evidence,
no witnesses.

436
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,170
My client had nothing to do
with this incident.

437
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:21,312
Well, then, he won't be
needing his lawyer, will he?

438
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,380
Mr. Ayles has hired me
as his advocate.

439
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:25,416
Then I suggest you
give him his money back.

440
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:28,145
Mr. Ayles, step to the center
of this court.

441
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:30,550
But, Your Honor, you can't
run a courtroom without lawyers.

442
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:32,680
Yes, I can.
You know why?

443
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:36,022
It's my courtroom,
and I don't like lawyers.

444
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:38,529
Place your hand on the Bible.

445
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,798
Unlike your lawyer,

446
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:45,164
do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but?

447
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:47,635
- I certainly do.
- You'd better.

448
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:50,708
Be seated.

449
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:53,403
Do I detect a bit
of a Southern accent?

450
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:56,342
- Tennessee.
- Hmm, nice place.

451
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:58,710
It used to be. It's not the same
after the war, though.

452
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,546
Word is a little group
got its start there.

453
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:01,880
Maybe you've heard of them.

454
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:04,353
Call themselves the Ku Klux Klan.

455
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:06,684
I wouldn't know anything about that.

456
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:08,423
Surely you read the papers.

457
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:10,058
Just the Bible.

458
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:12,357
A spiritual man.
That's comforting.

459
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:16,425
Your restaurant is
a whites-only establishment.

460
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:22,403
Well, it is within my rights
as a citizen to serve who I want.

461
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:23,939
Sadly, that's true.

462
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:27,211
Did Mr. Samuels
ever enter your restaurant?

463
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:30,109
Once, but I told him
he wasn't welcome.

464
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:31,271
What happened then?

465
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,418
Well, he left.
He understood.

466
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:36,577
Tell me, when was
this, uh, friendly exchange?

467
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:39,519
I'd say five, six months ago.

468
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:42,259
And your future dealings
with Mr. Samuels?

469
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:44,084
We had none.

470
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:45,695
So it is your testimony

471
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:48,061
that he did not come
to your restaurant two weeks ago

472
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,066
looking for milk for a sick child.

473
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:52,369
That's right, sir.
He did not.

474
00:29:57,275 --> 00:30:00,108
This record indicates
that Mr. Samuels' murder

475
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:04,715
is the third lynching
in these parts in the last year.

476
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:06,750
Three lynchings, no witnesses?

477
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,745
And yet you have been called
to this courtroom each time.

478
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:12,790
And I have been acquitted
every time.

479
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:14,256
The only reason I'm here now

480
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,953
is because those Negroes
want to punish me

481
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:18,586
for not letting them
eat in my restaurant.

482
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:22,089
- You must have awfully good food.
- Yes, sir, we do.

483
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,498
It's the finest in town,
and I aim to keep it that way.

484
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:27,797
GOODNIGHT: So, your restaurant...
does it have shiny silverware...

485
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,607
...fine china, and nice, clean,
white tablecloths?

486
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:33,175
Yes, sir, we do.

487
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:35,176
Have you ever noticed

488
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,681
how a white tablecloth
can resemble a sheet

489
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:40,114
out there in the dark?

490
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,548
You know, I do not care
for your insinuations, sir.

491
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:44,679
I-I'm a patriot,
and I fought for this country.

492
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:47,121
- In the Confederate army?
- Yes, sir.

493
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:50,592
Well, then, I might remind <i>you, sir,</i>

494
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:52,162
your side lost.

495
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,532
[Murmurs]

496
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:58,194
You may return
to your seat, Mr. Ayles.

497
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,677
Isaack, I'm sorry for your loss.

498
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:16,310
I, too, have lost loved ones
in a terrible way.

499
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,217
What I can tell you is,

500
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,655
while time heals the pain
a little bit,

501
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,956
it won't erase the memories.

502
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:27,828
It is my hope that, despite
all the evil that's been done here,

503
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:31,027
you'll be able to find a path
of dignity and purpose...

504
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:35,795
...and know that you
can take solace in the fact...

505
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:38,839
...that you did your father proud.

506
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:44,145
And you...

507
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,074
My gut tells me
that you are guilty as hell,

508
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:49,312
and I would love nothing more
than to see you swing

509
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,514
from the same tree
as Mr. Samuels.

510
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,982
But this is a court of law,
not a court of justice,

511
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:59,996
and the law is something
that I can't turn my back on.

512
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,799
Without any witnesses
or any evidence,

513
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:07,201
all I can do is acquit you,

514
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:10,536
so you are free to go.

515
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,743
MAN:
A joke of a trial.

516
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,760
Now, the last time I checked,
this land belonged to white folk,

517
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:38,164
not a bunch of colored
who jumped off the slave ship.

518
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,932
I say we round up
every last one of them

519
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,337
and decorate the trees
from here to Knoxville!

520
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:44,465
Hear! Hear!

521
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:52,142
What the hell?

522
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:54,283
[Ayles grunts]

523
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,193
Ironic, isn't it?

524
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,733
Out here in the dark,
we're all the same color.

525
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:14,736
I'll be back here in three months,
another three months after that.

526
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:17,101
If I so much as see your name
on my docket again,

527
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:19,972
I'll come back,
and I'll hang you for real.

528
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:23,037
[Gasping]

529
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,898
[Distant screams]

530
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:52,238
WOMAN:
Get off of me!

531
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,446
[Gunshot]

532
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:04,516
Who the hell are you?

533
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:06,613
My name is
John William Goodnight.

534
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:10,358
I'm Circuit Judge,
sworn jurisdiction in this territory.

535
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:12,894
Yeah, well, we don't need
no judge out here.

536
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:14,429
GOODNIGHT:
Mister, you're lucky I am a judge.

537
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:17,365
If I weren't sworn to uphold the law,
I'd shoot you right now.

538
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:19,135
The way I see it,
we got a choice:

539
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:21,034
We can go into town
and deal with this,

540
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:22,673
or you can face the law right here.

541
00:34:22,774 --> 00:34:25,538
Either way, justice
is being served today.

542
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,041
Yeah, well...

543
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:30,581
There's two of us
and one of you.

544
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:32,081
I like those odds.

545
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:35,209
When I drop this hammer,
one of you is gonna be dead.

546
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,810
There's a 50/50 chance that's you.

547
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,548
You still like those odds, gambler?

548
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,020
[Gunshot]

549
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,556
[Gunshot]

550
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:47,730
[Woman panting]

551
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:55,536
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

552
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:56,731
Thank you.

553
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:58,638
You sure?

554
00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:00,734
I can handle myself, generally.

555
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:03,336
They came on me by surprise.

556
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:07,276
So, you're our new judge.

557
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:09,283
John Goodnight.

558
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:12,781
Kate Ramsey.

559
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:16,588
I think it might be a good idea if I
rode along with you, Miss Ramsey.

560
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:19,722
I suppose that depends
on your intentions.

561
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:22,389
My only intention
is to get into Crooked Stick

562
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,694
to a bed and a hot bath.

563
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:28,129
I'm just a little mistrustful
of judges, is all.

564
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,968
I do hope you're
not like the last one.

565
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:31,130
What was he like?

566
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:34,473
Bought, owned,
and, thankfully, dead now.

567
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:35,568
You?

568
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:39,046
No, no, and not yet.

569
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:45,555
Well, you can ride along
with me if you like.

570
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:49,650
As low as they are,
they deserve to be buried.

571
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:52,823
Do you bury all the men you kill?

572
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:57,598
I don't know.
I've never killed anyone before.

573
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:04,470
KATE: My father taught me to shoot.
He's good with a gun, too.

574
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:07,909
Well, at least he used to be.

575
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:10,947
I've lived most my life
in Crooked Stick.

576
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:16,783
I probably should have left by now,
but, well, I feel an obligation.

577
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:19,516
My husband was the doctor there.

578
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:22,821
Since he died, I've tried
to take over where he left off.

579
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:25,462
You know,
I have been alone three years now.

580
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:31,529
That long, you'd think
I'd be used to it, but I'm not.

581
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:34,833
What about you?

582
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:37,206
What about me?

583
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:39,736
Well, are you alone?

584
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:43,041
I've got my horse.

585
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:47,483
Yeah, but can you
talk to a horse?

586
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,917
I've got a feeling you can.

587
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:54,685
Well...

588
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,128
I do enjoy
a good conversation.

589
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:04,028
It was a nice place to live
before Dan Reed showed up.

590
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:07,161
I could treat the Indians at my clinic
if not for Reed.

591
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:08,670
You heard of him?

592
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,498
You will.

593
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:14,577
He built most of Main Street,
and he employs almost everyone in it.

594
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:18,546
Naturally, his generosity
comes with a price.

595
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:24,086
No one stands up to him,
no matter what he does,

596
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:27,749
and a lot of what he does
is against the Indians.

597
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,722
When we get to town,
I'll talk to the sheriff.

598
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:34,625
Well, that won't do much good.

599
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:36,658
He's on Reed's payroll, too.

600
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:39,396
- I'm not.
- Yet.

601
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:43,964
If I were interested in money,
I'd still be in Chicago.

602
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,474
Do you always drink like that?

603
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:52,607
Like what?

604
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,012
Like there's no tomorrow.

605
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:56,950
There may not be.

606
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,724
You always talk so much?

607
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:04,855
What if I said yes?

608
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,864
I guess I could live with it.

609
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:10,764
Until morning, anyway.

610
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,403
I can't sleep.

611
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:24,913
Can you?

612
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:28,014
I'm trying.

613
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,553
You must have done
something awfully wrong

614
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:34,249
to be appointed to this circuit.

615
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:38,355
I imagine there are
few places on Earth as lawless.

616
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:39,452
I imagine.

617
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:41,728
Are you running from something?

618
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,834
Not that I know of.

619
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:47,702
It's a woman, isn't it?

620
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:50,202
You're here because of a woman?

621
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,200
Are you gonna keep
asking questions all night?

622
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,477
I might.

623
00:38:56,814 --> 00:39:00,341
Well, no, I'm not running
from anything,

624
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:04,911
and, yes, I'm here
because of a woman.

625
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:06,957
My mother.

626
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:54,864
Good morning.

627
00:39:55,106 --> 00:39:56,130
Good morning.

628
00:39:56,507 --> 00:40:01,706
I'm, uh, glad to say
you don't talk in your sleep.

629
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:06,311
Well, I'm happy to see you drink
something other than whiskey.

630
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:12,379
Well, after you've had some of this,
you might prefer whiskey.

631
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:18,025
I tell you what...

632
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:22,031
When we get to town, I will make you
a real cup of coffee...

633
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,530
...along with the best supper
you've ever eaten.

634
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:36,274
Do you want to have dinner
with me or not?

635
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:41,074
Supper would be, uh... fine.

636
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:44,344
- Good.
- Good.

637
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:46,421
All right.

638
00:40:53,898 --> 00:40:57,390
Here we are.
Crooked Stick.

639
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:18,253
Is something wrong?

640
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:25,956
- <i>We got enough for candy?</i>
- <i>I always go for the peppermint.</i>

641
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,531
SHOPKEEPER: <i>That piece of dirt</i>
<i>deserved to be hanged.</i>

642
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:40,266
What is it?

643
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,207
What's the matter?

644
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:48,079
I, uh, I've been here before,
a long time ago.

645
00:41:48,186 --> 00:41:50,177
Oh.

646
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:52,347
Well, then, I guess...

647
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:54,686
Welcome back.

648
00:41:57,628 --> 00:42:00,119
And thank you.

649
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:36,061
My ma says you're the judge.

650
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:37,725
I am.

651
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:39,893
My ma says you hanged a man
for spitting in Jackson.

652
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:42,130
Well, your mama heard wrong.

653
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,936
I would never hang a man
just for spitting...

654
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:49,342
unless, of course, he was spitting
on someone he'd just killed.

655
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:52,177
But if I spit, I'm not guilty
of anything, right?

656
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,319
Son, every man is guilty of something,
and you know what that is?

657
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,845
It's all the good that he didn't do.

658
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:03,927
Thank you.

659
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:13,265
How much is candy these days?

660
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:15,396
- Two cents, sir.
- Hmm.

661
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:16,905
This your store?

662
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:18,498
Uh, no, it's Mr. Reed's.

663
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:20,804
It used to belong
to my grandpa, though.

664
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:22,470
Is he around?

665
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,606
Uh, you actually just missed him,
but he'll be in tomorrow.

666
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:26,774
All right.

667
00:43:26,884 --> 00:43:28,579
He's not in any trouble
or anything, is he?

668
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:33,248
No, no, not as far as I know.

669
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:40,154

[Door slams]

671
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:56,170
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

672
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,713
[Door slams]

673
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,480
John William Goodnight.

674
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:06,290
I'm here to replace Judge Henry.

675
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,516
Yeah.

676
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:09,923
We got a wire saying
he was gunned down.

677
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:11,651
That's just a terrible thing.

678
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:13,787
GOODNIGHT: Well, being shot
in the back usually is.

679
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:15,623
Wouldn't happen on my watch.

680
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,700
Glad to hear it.

681
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:23,273
So, what do... what do you make
of our town so far?

682
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:25,136
Well, the candy's
pretty good.

683
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:30,841
Your jail is a little full, though.

684
00:44:30,948 --> 00:44:32,245
SHERIFF:
I hadn't noticed.

685
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:33,974
Why are they being held?

686
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:36,312
Being Indian, I guess.

687
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:40,651
I didn't realize being Indian
was against the law.

688
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:43,487
[Chuckling]
Well, Judge Henry did.

689
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:45,754
Yeah, well, like you said,
he's dead.

690
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:48,127
And I'm here now,
so I will see those detainees

691
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:49,891
tomorrow in my courtroom.

692
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:51,969
Well, your... your docket's
already full.

693
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:54,469
- I'll make room.
- Mr. Reed won't like it.

694
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:57,473
Well, unfortunately for Mr. Reed,
I don't work for him.

695
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:00,304
And may I remind you, Sheriff,
neither do you.

696
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:06,508
I want to hear
this case first thing in the morning.

697
00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:09,279

00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:22,958
- Who is it?
- Kate.

700
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:28,872
Walk right in, why don't you?

701
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:31,173
You about done in there?

702
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:33,570
The water's still hot.

703
00:45:34,512 --> 00:45:36,537
Well, you invited me to dinner.

704
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:39,213
[Sarcastically]
Right. I...

705
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:42,877
Well, I-I didn't realize
that was tonight.

706
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:46,322
Well, I'm here.

707
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:49,186
And I'm hungry.

708
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:58,398
I'll just be outside.

709
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,765
[Door closes]

710
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:14,717
You are hungry.

711
00:46:18,522 --> 00:46:20,387
I don't eat out much.

712
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:26,989
Nobody asks me.
I don't like to dine alone.

713
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:32,126
The last time I was here,
I was with my father.

714
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:34,227
I haven't seen him
in nearly two years.

715
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:36,064
Where is he?

716
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,969
He moved to Laramie.

717
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:44,047
He's a businessman.
There's richer clientele up there.

718
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:45,113
Mm.

719
00:46:45,216 --> 00:46:47,582
But, then, I never did
see much of him,

720
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:48,982
even when he lived here.

721
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,080
He was always coming and going.

722
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,250
Some men are restless
like that, I suppose.

723
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,525
I suppose.

724
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:01,693
Are you restless?

725
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:03,289
Not exactly.

726
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:04,627
But you've never been married?

727
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:08,067
You ask a lot of questions.

728
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:10,339
You'd make a pretty good lawyer.

729
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:13,205
Well, I thought
you didn't like lawyers.

730
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,402
Oh, I don't.

731
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:19,641
But I could learn to like them
if they all looked like you.

732
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,755
Thank you.

733
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:30,458
But you still didn't answer
my question.

734
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:33,095
Uh, there was a question?

735
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:35,263
Why haven't you married?

736
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,831
Because when you
get close to someone like that,

737
00:47:37,935 --> 00:47:41,462
it's just one more loss you're
gonna have to face down the road.

738
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:47,202
Why do I get the feeling
that I scare you

739
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:49,211
more than those outlaws?

740
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,507
Maybe because
all they can do is kill me.

741
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:57,345
[Laughs]

742
00:47:57,621 --> 00:48:00,021
Relax, Mr. Goodnight.

743
00:48:00,124 --> 00:48:02,354
The only thing
I'm interested in killing

744
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:04,893
is the rest of this steak.

745
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:07,327
- You're doing a good job on it.
- [Laughs]

746
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:11,124
I know you're just passing through.

747
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:15,437
But that doesn't mean
we can't enjoy a nice evening

748
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,066
before you free
those Indians tomorrow.

749
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:22,137
So, this is about those Indians.

750
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:27,206
This is about a lot of things.

751
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:40,186
Well, before we, uh,
go any further,

752
00:48:40,297 --> 00:48:42,765
I should tell you
I can't be bribed.

753
00:48:45,302 --> 00:48:50,205
Well, might I remind you
that you're the one paying for dinner?

754
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:56,046
I have a feeling I'm gonna be paying
for this dinner for a long time.

755
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:00,347
[Chuckles]

756
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:06,753
Why, thank you.

757
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:15,394
Evening, folks.
Having a nice night?

758
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,728
Please tell Mr. Reed
we were having a lovely night

759
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:20,667
until you showed up.

760
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:25,538
I'd be happy to, as soon as the judge
here packs up and rides out.

761
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:28,703
Now, why would I do that?
I just got here.

762
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:30,574
I could give you some reasons.

763
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:32,772
[Kate screams]

764
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:46,525
KATE: Help, please!
Somebody, help!

765
00:49:46,997 --> 00:49:48,191
Please, somebody, help!

766
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:50,231
You, come, please!

767
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:55,434
Please help him!

768
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:56,471
Come on.

769
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:01,406
Oh, come on.

770
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:02,910
I'd normally take you to the clinic,

771
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:07,507
but I expect you're used
to having girls in your hotel room.

772
00:50:07,618 --> 00:50:10,553
Yeah, it isn't usually this painful.

773
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:15,450
Maybe it's best
you leave in the morning.

774
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:17,321
Best for who?

775
00:50:19,163 --> 00:50:21,688
There is nothing you can do here.

776
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:24,866
I don't know why I keep hoping.

777
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:27,528
This place is poison.

778
00:51:12,983 --> 00:51:15,713
You were just gonna leave
without waking me?

779
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:19,220
I figured I'd see you in court.

780
00:51:19,323 --> 00:51:22,952
So that wasn't
a kiss good-bye last night?

781
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,359
If it was,
it would have been shorter.

782
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:29,025
I'll walk with you.

783
00:51:30,267 --> 00:51:32,235
As much as I'd like that,

784
00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:34,600
maybe you'd better wait
a few minutes.

785
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:37,105
I don't want people
getting the wrong idea.

786
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:41,540
This town already
has their ideas about me.

787
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:45,346
It's not your reputation
I'm worried about.

788
00:52:01,598 --> 00:52:03,862
Judge Goodnight.

789
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:05,857
Dan Reed.

790
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:08,895
Your reputation precedes you.

791
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:11,040
As does yours, Mr. Reed.

792
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:13,803
I, uh, met your welcoming committee
last night.

793
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:17,708
Yes, I hear there was
a misunderstanding.

794
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:19,373
I apologize for their bad manners.

795
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,482
We have a pleasant
little town here.

796
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:25,987
I regret if you've gotten
the impression otherwise.

797
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:31,288
I see you appreciate guns.

798
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:36,995
Beauty, isn't it?
[Chuckles]

799
00:52:38,602 --> 00:52:39,967
Make up for last night.

800
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:44,906
You have it,
with my compliments.

801
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:46,064
I've got a gun.

802
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,905
A man can never have
too many guns.

803
00:52:49,379 --> 00:52:51,142
Judge Henry had three.

804
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:54,750
It's a pity he's no longer alive
to enjoy them.

805
00:52:54,852 --> 00:52:56,114
REED:
That it is.

806
00:52:56,653 --> 00:52:59,349
You know, I'm not altogether sure

807
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:02,482
your judicial services
are needed here.

808
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:04,925
We're used to handling
our own problems.

809
00:53:05,095 --> 00:53:06,119
I'm glad to hear that.

810
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,596
I figure as long as I'm here,
I'll make myself useful.

811
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:11,461
And there's nothing I can do
to make you change your mind?

812
00:53:12,503 --> 00:53:14,733
Afraid not.

813
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:19,403
I look forward to watching
you dispense justice, then.

814
00:53:26,617 --> 00:53:31,384
On your way into the courtroom,
leave that gun with the deputy.

815
00:53:32,422 --> 00:53:34,014
And what about <i>your</i> gun, Judge?

816
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,221
My courtroom.

817
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:37,793
My rules.

818
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:41,997
[Laughs]

819
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:13,893
GOODNIGHT: Yesterday, when I
arrived here, I recognized this town.

820
00:54:14,932 --> 00:54:18,698
I was here as a little boy.

821
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:24,798
And while I can see that this town
has grown a great deal,

822
00:54:24,908 --> 00:54:28,571
in some ways,
it hasn't changed at all...

823
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,011
...as evidenced by the members
of the Cheyenne

824
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:39,146
who are in this court today
after 30 days of incarceration.

825
00:54:39,723 --> 00:54:41,748
I look forward to hearing
the evidence against them,

826
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:43,849
should there be any.

827
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:46,690
Sheriff...

828
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:51,723
They was arrested
for trespassing on Mr. Reed's land.

829
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:53,460
And where did this crime
take place?

830
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:55,963
I'm not sure.

831
00:54:56,473 --> 00:54:58,532
You're sure it happened,
you're just not sure where.

832
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:00,270
That's right.

833
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:03,236
Is that because you
didn't actually see it happen?

834
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,537
Mr. Reed saw.

835
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:07,144
Of course he did.

836
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,946
Have a seat.

837
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,412
Mr. Reed...

838
00:55:12,356 --> 00:55:14,620
...can you shed some light
on this mystery?

839
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:16,258
Be happy to, Judge.

840
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:17,951
Stand, please.

841
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:26,467
- Did you hurt your leg?
- Old injury.

842
00:55:26,937 --> 00:55:28,165
I'm sorry to hear it.

843
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:29,937
I appreciate the concern.

844
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:33,303
So, why don't you start
by, uh, telling this court

845
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:34,775
how much land you own.

846
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:36,612
100,000 acres, give or take.

847
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:38,507
That's a lot of land.

848
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:41,750
That's the... that's the better part
of this valley.

849
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:44,016
I might have trespassed
on my way in.

850
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:46,646
It's the savages
I'm concerned with.

851
00:55:47,324 --> 00:55:49,019
Not savages.

852
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:50,320
People.

853
00:55:51,294 --> 00:55:55,321
The word "people" refers
to individuals rather than Indians.

854
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:57,091
Not in here it doesn't.

855
00:55:58,101 --> 00:56:01,195
REED: Those "people"
lit fires and spooked my cattle.

856
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:03,464
GOODNIGHT: If they lit fires,
there should be evidence.

857
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,800
That shouldn't be too hard to find.

858
00:56:05,676 --> 00:56:06,768
Be my guest.

859
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:12,045
I believe I already am
your guest, at the hotel,

860
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:13,614
which I'm told you own.

861
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:14,979
That's correct.

862
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:16,985
My hotel employs 23 people.

863
00:56:17,154 --> 00:56:19,281
It pays a sizable tax
to the town,

864
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:22,085
which is helping to build
a new schoolhouse.

865
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:23,625
And, yet, with all that going on,

866
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:27,663
you still have time to concern
yourself with a few Indians

867
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:30,961
on a piece of land
you barely recognize?

868
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:32,660
I'm not on trial here.

869
00:56:32,836 --> 00:56:35,464
No, no.
My apologies.

870
00:56:35,572 --> 00:56:38,973
Must be the effect of that
good bottle of wine I ordered

871
00:56:39,076 --> 00:56:40,065
at the restaurant last night,

872
00:56:40,243 --> 00:56:44,236
which, I am told,
you are also the proprietor of.

873
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:47,710
I'm beginning to think
you're a bit envious, Your Honor.

874
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:50,184
[Laughs]

875
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:51,914
Well, that may be,

876
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:54,387
considering that everything
I have in this world

877
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:56,425
would fit into two saddlebags.

878
00:56:58,528 --> 00:56:59,927
You may sit down, Mr. Reed.

879
00:57:00,597 --> 00:57:02,690
Why, thank you, Your Honor.

880
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:05,167
Who will speak for the tribe?

881
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:08,971
Curtis Whitecloud, Your Honor.

882
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:10,369
I will speak for my people.

883
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:13,872
Did you trespass
on Mr. Reed's land?

884
00:57:14,277 --> 00:57:17,337
We come to town
only to trade supplies.

885
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:20,208
Our village is 20 miles from here.

886
00:57:21,418 --> 00:57:26,219
We use an abandoned trail
that runs across a corner of his land.

887
00:57:26,323 --> 00:57:28,382
It saves us a day's travel.

888
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:30,693
Did you build a fire
on this land?

889
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:34,228
We lit a small fire to keep warm.
We did no harm.

890
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:36,797
They've been warned
not to use that trail.

891
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:39,328
Do white people use the trail?

892
00:57:39,536 --> 00:57:41,367
REED: White people
don't threaten my property.

893
00:57:41,738 --> 00:57:43,171
His people do.

894
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:47,575
Mr. Reed, the Cheyenne
have been building fires on this land

895
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:48,666
for hundreds of years

896
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:52,875
and somehow managed
to not destroy it.

897
00:57:54,217 --> 00:57:56,708
So, you were arrested
in the act of trespassing?

898
00:57:56,987 --> 00:57:57,976
No.

899
00:57:58,488 --> 00:58:02,549
We were arrested when we
got to town, just like always.

900
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:06,623
- So this has happened before.
- Many times.

901
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:11,731
Sometimes they just spit on us
and call us names,

902
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:16,431
and sometimes they round us up
like cattle and beat us.

903
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:20,243
I see the bruises there
on your wrists,

904
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:22,937
and, uh, your clothes are torn.

905
00:58:23,046 --> 00:58:24,411
What happened?

906
00:58:24,514 --> 00:58:27,574
I was dragged down Main Street
behind a horse.

907
00:58:27,684 --> 00:58:29,982
And the sheriff did this to you?

908
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:31,110
No.

909
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:33,018
It was them.

910
00:58:36,092 --> 00:58:38,925
Can anyone step forward
and corroborate this testimony?

911
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,993
You know,
I'm beginning to think

912
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:48,764
there's something wrong
with the drinking water

913
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:50,339
here in Crooked Stick.

914
00:58:50,507 --> 00:58:53,032
There seems to be
an epidemic of blindness.

915
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:58,310
I saw Mr. Whitecloud
dragged down Main Street.

916
00:59:01,518 --> 00:59:04,851
I've seen things
that bad and worse, for years.

917
00:59:06,022 --> 00:59:08,684
GOODNIGHT: And you're
just coming forward now?

918
00:59:09,893 --> 00:59:11,656
Yes.

919
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:15,290
Mr. Reed threatened
to torch my clinic

920
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:17,229
if I made any trouble for him.

921
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:19,959
Thank you, Miss Ramsey.

922
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,265
You may have a seat.

923
00:59:25,008 --> 00:59:26,737
I'm ready to make my ruling.

924
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:28,743
Will the defendants please rise?

925
00:59:34,451 --> 00:59:36,419
You don't knock a man down

926
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:39,010
and then accuse him
of living in the dirt.

927
00:59:39,823 --> 00:59:42,314
You don't strip a man
of his clothes

928
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:45,826
and then punish him
for being naked.

929
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:49,824
While there are no laws
on the books of this territory

930
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,401
protecting Indians' rights,

931
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:59,203
there is a law that says you can't
hold a human being for no reason.

932
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:02,507
And we are all
human beings here,

933
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:04,840
regardless of our heritage,

934
01:00:05,682 --> 01:00:09,083
and as such,
you men are free to go.

935
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:19,090
Mr. Reed, let this be a warning
to you and your men.

936
01:00:19,896 --> 01:00:21,830
I don't care
how much land you own.

937
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:28,629
If I ever hear of another incident
of abuse regarding these people,

938
01:00:28,805 --> 01:00:30,932
you will have the pleasure
of hearing another of my verdicts,

939
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:34,167
and I guarantee you,
you will not like it.

940
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:36,204
Case dismissed.

941
01:00:36,379 --> 01:00:37,403
[Gavel bangs]

942
01:00:37,514 --> 01:00:39,448
Next case.

943
01:00:44,154 --> 01:00:46,884
- This isn't over.
- I expect it isn't.

944
01:01:03,473 --> 01:01:05,805
My grandson said
you were looking for me.

945
01:01:05,909 --> 01:01:07,774
You look the same
as you did back then.

946
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:08,969
You must be blind.

947
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,444
You still like those peppermints?

948
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:13,982
You remember me.

949
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:16,279
Well, it was
a pretty memorable day.

950
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:18,980
It was the last time
I saw Judge Shaw.

951
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:21,080
It seems like all the judges
who comes through here

952
01:01:21,191 --> 01:01:23,352
end up with a bullet
in 'em eventually.

953
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,654
That's what they tell me.

954
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:28,219
I gonna do my best to see
if I can't break that tradition.

955
01:01:28,331 --> 01:01:31,129
After today,
I wouldn't bet on it.

956
01:01:32,068 --> 01:01:33,831
You know, it can't be
too good for your health

957
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:35,461
out here talking with me, either.

958
01:01:35,638 --> 01:01:38,766
I'm an old man, long past
worrying about my health.

959
01:01:39,342 --> 01:01:43,142
What do you remember about
the outlaws who killed Judge Shaw?

960
01:01:43,313 --> 01:01:46,111
Not much.
They weren't from around here.

961
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:48,878
Best I recall,
they were just passing through.

962
01:01:49,052 --> 01:01:51,043
- You remember any names?
- No.

963
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:53,247
Why the interest?
I thought they all died out there.

964
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:57,315
All but one. Took a bullet
in the leg and rode out.

965
01:01:57,427 --> 01:02:00,055
If he's still alive,
he'd be about 50,

966
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:02,825
good with a gun,
dragging a limp.

967
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:05,331
Sounds like you're
describing Dan Reed.

968
01:02:05,735 --> 01:02:06,861
How'd he make all his money?

969
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,165
I don't know,
and I don't intend to ask.

970
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:12,399
He just turned up here
half a dozen years ago with his wife

971
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:14,440
and started buying up
everything in sight.

972
01:02:14,544 --> 01:02:15,943
He has a wife?

973
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:17,673
Not anymore.

974
01:02:17,847 --> 01:02:19,542
She's the one
that re-named this town.

975
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:21,514
- We used to be called...
- Dry Gulch.

976
01:02:21,618 --> 01:02:23,210
Yeah.
That's right.

977
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:26,152
She didn't think that was too pretty.
I have to say, I agree.

978
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:28,847
Of course, "Crooked Stick"...
it isn't much better.

979
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:31,085
Crooked Stick's
an Indian name.

980
01:02:31,194 --> 01:02:33,025
Yeah.

981
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:38,865
MAN: Hey, come on, take a look!
Come on, you got to see this!

982
01:02:38,968 --> 01:02:41,095
Come on over here!
Over here. Take a look!

983
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:54,941
It was him.

984
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:56,109
It was Reed.

985
01:03:05,028 --> 01:03:06,757
Evening, Judge.

986
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:09,627
A man lies dead in the street,
and you're gonna do nothing about it?

987
01:03:09,732 --> 01:03:10,721
Yeah.

988
01:03:10,867 --> 01:03:11,891
Where's Reed?

989
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:15,800
He's in the hotel.
He's got his men there.

990
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:18,166
[Tin cup clatters]

991
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:21,402
- What the hell are you doing?
- Keeping you company.

992
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:24,911
[Door opens, slams]

993
01:03:25,515 --> 01:03:29,144
Evening, Sheriff, Judge.

994
01:03:29,252 --> 01:03:30,617
Say what you got to say.

995
01:03:31,554 --> 01:03:32,543
Mr. Reed...

996
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:36,715
I'm afraid you're
under arrest for murder.

997
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:38,451
[Reed laughs]

998
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:45,726
So, who did I kill?

999
01:03:46,669 --> 01:03:48,603
Curtis Whitecloud.

1000
01:03:49,906 --> 01:03:53,069
Yeah, I heard about that.

1001
01:03:53,176 --> 01:03:54,404
A real shame.

1002
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:56,274
Get up.

1003
01:03:56,613 --> 01:03:59,013
You've got the wrong man, Judge.

1004
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:01,675
I've been in this fine establishment
all evening

1005
01:04:01,784 --> 01:04:03,308
enjoying a leisurely dinner.

1006
01:04:03,486 --> 01:04:06,114
Don't bother ordering dessert.

1007
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:08,486
One more time...

1008
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:09,615
Get up.

1009
01:04:09,893 --> 01:04:12,259
You think because you've
got a lawbook and a gavel

1010
01:04:12,362 --> 01:04:14,023
you can tell me
how to run my town?

1011
01:04:14,197 --> 01:04:15,630
This isn't your town.

1012
01:04:16,432 --> 01:04:19,265
Well, I paid for most of it.
That makes it my town.

1013
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:22,131
- Some things can't be bought.
- REED: I disagree.

1014
01:04:22,539 --> 01:04:23,836
Kill him.

1015
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:26,874
I expect they'll get a few shots off,

1016
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:30,104
and from this distance,
I don't think they'll miss.

1017
01:04:30,213 --> 01:04:32,977
I guarantee you... I won't.

1018
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:42,491
You'd give up your life
over a dead Indian?

1019
01:04:42,592 --> 01:04:45,026
Young lady, that's a very pretty dress
you're wearing tonight,

1020
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:47,729
but if Mr. Reed
doesn't obey the law,

1021
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,162
you're about to have
his blood all over it.

1022
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:55,197
Hm!

1023
01:05:00,343 --> 01:05:02,743
Put your guns down, boys.

1024
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:17,717
[Gun cocks]

1025
01:05:19,429 --> 01:05:21,522
Go.

1026
01:05:32,408 --> 01:05:33,636
You're crazier than I thought.

1027
01:05:33,743 --> 01:05:36,007
You have no idea.

1028
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:40,081
You see all these
fine citizens here?

1029
01:05:40,183 --> 01:05:43,983
When my men come for me,
they won't help you.

1030
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:46,954
Nobody will.

1031
01:05:58,468 --> 01:06:00,436
You expect me to stay
in this filth-hole?

1032
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:02,901
Last occupants...
they felt the same way.

1033
01:06:03,006 --> 01:06:04,837
Yeah, well,

1034
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:06,602
when you think about it,

1035
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:08,973
the more dead Indians
we got now,

1036
01:06:09,078 --> 01:06:11,273
the less we'll have to kill
in the next war.

1037
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:14,350
- Is that a confession?
- It's a fact.

1038
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,146
The way I see it is it doesn't matter
how many of them you kill.

1039
01:06:17,654 --> 01:06:20,953
It's not gonna change the fact
that your wife left you for an Indian.

1040
01:06:22,825 --> 01:06:24,725
You know nothing about my wife.

1041
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:27,657
I know she chose
their way of life over yours.

1042
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:31,766
I know that she left you
and all your money

1043
01:06:31,868 --> 01:06:33,301
with just the clothes
on her back

1044
01:06:33,403 --> 01:06:36,930
and you... you never
saw her again.

1045
01:06:38,074 --> 01:06:39,632
You have no idea
what you've started.

1046
01:06:39,742 --> 01:06:42,438
This started 20 years ago.

1047
01:06:42,545 --> 01:06:44,137
I'm just here to finish it.

1048
01:06:44,314 --> 01:06:45,508
What the hell are you talking about?

1049
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:48,641
Your mind's so full of killing,
you don't remember it?

1050
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:51,320
I remember it.

1051
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:54,356
- Like it was yesterday.
- You really are crazy.

1052
01:06:54,524 --> 01:06:57,015
You shot up a wagon
outside of this town.

1053
01:06:57,193 --> 01:06:59,354
You thought you killed
everyone inside it.

1054
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:02,555
You took my family and the judge.

1055
01:07:02,665 --> 01:07:03,859
But there were some survivors,

1056
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:06,696
and one of them is here
to make sure you hang for it.

1057
01:07:06,803 --> 01:07:08,964
I know nothing
about your family.

1058
01:07:10,707 --> 01:07:14,302
But I do know
I never killed a judge...

1059
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:15,843
yet.

1060

REED: See something
you fancy out there?

1066
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:42,762
Funny, isn't it,

1067
01:07:42,872 --> 01:07:46,638
how feelings for a woman
can get in the way of things?

1068
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:51,914
Tell them to let her go.

1069
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:55,139
I'll let her go.

1070
01:07:55,251 --> 01:07:58,220
Unlock the cell.

1071
01:08:03,226 --> 01:08:04,420
Howdy, boys.

1072
01:08:06,629 --> 01:08:07,653
Let her go.

1073
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:11,330
REED:
She's all yours.

1074
01:08:16,506 --> 01:08:20,169
You're not getting out
of this town alive, Judge.

1075
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:36,923
- You all right?
- I am so sorry I got you into this.

1076
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:39,426
- You didn't.
- He'll be back for you.

1077
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:40,791
I know.

1078
01:08:40,897 --> 01:08:43,058
I want you to take my horse
and ride to the outpost.

1079
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:44,929
- Stay there until I come for you.
- And if you don't?

1080
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:47,559
- Don't look back.
- I can't do that.

1081
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:50,705
You do feel something
for me, don't you?

1082
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:53,106
Yes.

1083
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:59,941
When this is over,
you are taking me out to celebrate.

1084
01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:01,778
There's this little place
outside of town.

1085
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:03,852
The liquor's watered down,
and the food's awful,

1086
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:05,614
but it isn't owned by Reed.

1087
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:07,450
This isn't gonna end well, Kate.

1088
01:09:07,557 --> 01:09:10,993
Probably not,
but I'm willing to chance it.

1089
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:12,755
Why?

1090
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:16,263
Because if we somehow
manage to live through it,

1091
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:19,425
I'm hoping you'll stay on here.

1092
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:21,162
In Crooked Stick?

1093
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:24,671
That might be the worst offer
anyone's ever made me.

1094
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:26,298
I mean...

1095
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:28,639
...with me.

1096
01:09:35,485 --> 01:09:36,884
You're right.

1097
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:38,453
It's a terrible idea.

1098
01:09:38,621 --> 01:09:40,646
No, I didn't say that.

1099
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,631
They probably won't kill us
till daylight.

1100
01:10:15,391 --> 01:10:16,881
What is it?

1101
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:19,488
Where did you get that?

1102
01:10:20,663 --> 01:10:21,652
Why?

1103
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:23,355
This ring?

1104
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:25,866
Well, my father gave it to me

1105
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:27,629
when I was a little girl.

1106
01:10:28,404 --> 01:10:31,339
Your father?

1107
01:10:31,807 --> 01:10:34,002
What's wrong?

1108
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:35,837
What's his name?

1109
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:37,912
Francis LeGrange.

1110
01:10:39,282 --> 01:10:40,806
Not Ramsey?

1111
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:43,144
No, Ramsey
was my husband's name.

1112
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:49,181
I don't understand
what this is about.

1113
01:10:50,693 --> 01:10:53,059
Your father...

1114
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:55,153
He taught you to shoot?

1115
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:57,596
He was a gunman.
That's why he was gone all the time.

1116
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,167
No, I told you,
he was restless.

1117
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:02,965
Did he have a knife... like that?

1118
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:04,471
He had a lot of knives.

1119
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:07,270
Did he have a scar on his leg
from a bullet wound?

1120
01:11:09,245 --> 01:11:11,543
You tell me right now
what this is about.

1121
01:11:11,714 --> 01:11:14,182
That ring on your necklace

1122
01:11:14,283 --> 01:11:15,511
is my mother's wedding ring,

1123
01:11:15,618 --> 01:11:18,587
and it was ripped off her finger
by the man that killed her.

1124
01:11:20,623 --> 01:11:22,352
I don't understand.

1125
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:23,856
I think you do.

1126
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:26,460
No. I don't.

1127
01:11:26,562 --> 01:11:29,588
You don't know him.
He's a good man!

1128
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:31,530
Maybe he was just a good shot.

1129
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,966
Did he ever tell you how he
got so good with a gun, Kate,

1130
01:11:37,073 --> 01:11:39,337
why he was coming
and going all the time?

1131
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:41,910
How did he get
a woman's wedding ring?

1132
01:11:42,011 --> 01:11:44,844
Did he ever tell you how he made
his money when he was young?

1133
01:11:44,947 --> 01:11:46,141
I'll tell you.

1134
01:11:46,315 --> 01:11:49,284
Riding with an outlaw gang,
robbing, killing innocent people

1135
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:50,374
and just watching them die!

1136
01:11:50,486 --> 01:11:53,546
You stop this!
This isn't a trial.

1137
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:55,783
This is you talking to me

1138
01:11:55,891 --> 01:11:58,223
about my own flesh and blood.

1139
01:11:58,361 --> 01:12:00,955
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I'm not wrong.

1140
01:12:02,064 --> 01:12:04,225
He may not be that person now,
but he was,

1141
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:07,302
and when I bring him in,

1142
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,665
you ask him yourself.

1143
01:12:10,139 --> 01:12:13,734
You mean before you kill him.

1144
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:28,972
Hey!

1145
01:13:30,019 --> 01:13:32,510
Come here!
Here, hand it back to her. Come on.

[Horses approaching]

01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:34,445
Looks like hell's in session
in Crooked Stick.

1148
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,882
Well, for once, we agree.

1149
01:14:37,286 --> 01:14:39,311
It doesn't have to be like this.

1150
01:14:39,822 --> 01:14:42,382
I offered you
a chance to ride away.

1151
01:14:42,591 --> 01:14:45,822
You also offered me that fine
pearl-handled pistol of yours.

1152
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:50,627
To be quite honest, I'm kind of
wishing I'd taken you up on it now.

1153
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:51,995
How'd you come by it?

[Chuckles]

1156
01:14:56,071 --> 01:14:58,062
...and he wants to know
about my gun.

1157
01:15:00,342 --> 01:15:02,503
I won it in a poker game
in Laramie.

1158
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:05,908
A mean son of a gun
who didn't like losing.

Did you catch his name?

LeGrange.

1161
01:15:08,918 --> 01:15:10,647
Is that what you wanted to hear?

1162
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:12,818
No.

1163
01:15:17,092 --> 01:15:20,584
Tell your boys
to put their guns down.

1164
01:15:20,763 --> 01:15:23,823
- I'll give them a fair trial.
- Sorry, Judge.

1165
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:25,432
No more trials.

1166
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:27,634

no better than you.

We'll be sorry to see you go.

what I'm leaving behind.

Does it?

We didn't have that before.

1191

I'm looking for Francis LeGrange.

1195
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:30,201
Don't think I know him.

1196

Think a little harder.

1197

Why didn't you say so,
Your Honor?

1198

Are you not that
distinguished gentleman,

1204
01:21:24,326 --> 01:21:25,452
Death?

1205
01:21:25,627 --> 01:21:28,152
You killed my parents.

1206
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:29,890
I killed many.

1207
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:33,900
It's something that just...

1208
01:21:34,002 --> 01:21:37,369
seemed to come naturally to me.

I never troubled
to recall the details.

When I was seven,
I watched my daddy get hung

and I listened to my mama praying
for his soul be saved from hell.

This isn't about your parents.
It's about mine.

1214

So shoot me.

01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:32,359
hiding in the bushes
like a scared little schoolgirl?

1221
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:34,995
I let you live

1222
01:22:35,097 --> 01:22:37,327
because I knew,

1223
01:22:37,432 --> 01:22:41,835
I knew you'd relive
that nightmare over and over

1224
01:22:41,937 --> 01:22:44,770
until it tore you apart,

1225
01:22:44,873 --> 01:22:48,707
and I prayed
that when that day came,

1226
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:53,110
you would take
your rightful place in my plan

1227
01:22:53,282 --> 01:22:55,216
to bring more pain
into the world...

1228
01:22:56,985 --> 01:22:59,044
...more pain than all the good...

1229
01:22:59,254 --> 01:23:01,119
[Gasps]

1230
01:23:34,189 --> 01:23:36,749
You killed him?

1231
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:42,523
Mr. LeGrange died
of natural causes, ma'am.

1232
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:46,967
Frankly, I'm surprised
he lived as long as he did.

1233
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,444
I'm sorry, Kate.

1234
01:24:01,116 --> 01:24:03,414
I was wrong.

1235
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:06,544
The man I was looking for,
it...

1236
01:24:06,655 --> 01:24:10,056
wasn't your father.

1237
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:18,290
[Crying]

1238
01:24:54,903 --> 01:25:00,068
This, uh, belongs to you.

1239
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:06,041
I know that now.

1240
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:11,748
What are you gonna do?

1241
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:17,418
Watch you ride off.

1242
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:23,764
And wish things were different.

1243
01:25:29,404 --> 01:25:32,305
I'm gonna miss hearing you talk.

1244
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:50,954
Is that a kiss good-bye?

1245
01:25:55,664 --> 01:25:58,030
No.

1246
01:25:58,133 --> 01:26:00,499
You hold onto this.

1247
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:04,967
For both of us.

1248
01:26:16,751 --> 01:26:18,582
I'll be back.

1249
01:26:19,955 --> 01:26:23,550
Well, when you come,

1250
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:25,990
I might just be waiting.

1251
01:28:03,008 --> 01:28:04,990
---the end---
