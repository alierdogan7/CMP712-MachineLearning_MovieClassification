1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,721
[Man]
Run!

2
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,758
Hurry!

3
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,151
[grunts]

4
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,355
Come on. Up.

5
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,990
Come on!

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,836
[cocks]

7
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,004
[gunshot]

8
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,514
[horse whinnying]
They're still shooting
at us!

9
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,222
Go!

10
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,565
[Man]
There's a boat!

11
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,966
Hey, get on that boat!

12
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,279
- [grunts]
- Let's go! Let's go!

13
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,352
Grab that paddle,
Jimmy!

14
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,622
Grab it! Let's go!
They're following fast!
They're coming!

15
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,257
They're following close!

16
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,228
[cocks]

17
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,036
It's moving.

18
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,540
Go get me the Sharps
with the sight. Now!

19
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,912
I'm gonna do this right.

20
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,349
[panting]

21
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,619
I'm gonna get your gun.

22
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,071
Maybe it's an omen.

23
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,874
Just seems like bad luck
or something, you know?

24
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,677
There ain't never been
nothing like this.

25
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,779
[sighs]

26
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:38,151
If I don't claim it now,
some other asshole will
and take the fame.

27
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,954
And Snyder didn't pay
for nothing.

28
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,625
I'm telling you, Mooar,
it ain't right.

29
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,194
Frankly, I feel
I walk away right now,

30
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,763
you'll come back
and claim it yourself.

31
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,843
[cheering]

32
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,120
[cheering continues]

33
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,624
Thank you! Thank you!

34
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,959
We'll be right back.

35
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,295
You can have
some more pictures.

36
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,864
[Man] John Mooar!
Little business here.
We'll be right back.

37
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,433
I'll tell you what,
Mr. Mooar.

38
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,302
You put this place
on the map.

39
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,937
I want you
to meet a fella.

40
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,506
He's the one
who led me to the white.

41
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,608
He's a big old boy,
ain't he?
Isn't he?

42
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,477
[chuckling]
Come on inside.

43
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,112
I got plans.

44
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,191
This is a lot of money
for tracking an animal.

45
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,994
So how about a drink?

46
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,797
Snyder, Texas.

47
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,600
That's got
a good ring to it.

48
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,570
He can run your whiskey
up to Granbury.

49
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,439
I'm not sure I trust Barkley
to do it.

50
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,176
No. I got 12 jugs
of moonshine, homemade.

51
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,811
The best there is.

52
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,081
Can you get it
all in your boat?

53
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,949
Yes.
Good.

54
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,752
Then I'll send Barkley
to tell Gordon...

55
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,854
to meet on the river
in three days.

56
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,190
- You come back
with the payment.
- I agree.

57
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,095
This ought cover
the shipping costs.

58
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,664
That's a lot of money too.

59
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,701
Boys, come on.

60
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,970
If you don't mind,

61
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,306
I'd like folks to think...

62
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,875
it was shot
with my father's rifle.

63
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,422
I'll have Barkley
load up the whiskey.

64
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,626
Barkley!

65
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,495
Come on!
We'll load up some whiskey.

66
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,597
[Man]
If I could trouble you
for a few more photographs.

67
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,232
Sure.

68
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,334
[ Man ]
John!

69
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,137
[cheering]
Oh!

70
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,173
[Mooar]
Excuse me. We're gonna
take some more photographs.

71
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,144
Picture, please?
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,713
Please step back.
Make room for
the camera, please.

73
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,348
Thank you.
Step back, please.

74
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,917
A little more.
A little more.

75
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,654
Excellent. Hold that.

76
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,924
[cheering]

77
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,380
Hey.

78
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,219
[sighs]
Good God.

79
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,723
Mm-mmm.

80
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,292
I got some confessing
to do anyway.

81
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,029
I can think of a few things
gone awry.

82
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,401
I don't think I've seen
such a pretty girl...

83
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,905
since last time I saw
your sister in Spokane.

84
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,642
[Man]
...my whole life.

85
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,211
Charlie Austin,
him and his colored companion--

86
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,714
I want him found,
and I want you
to punish him.

87
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,919
You get revenge
for me and my daughter.

88
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,721
[Man #2]
If you want us to do it,
it's gonna cost you.

89
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,692
If we can do it without force,
won't be much.

90
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,561
All it takes
is one little bullet,

91
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,130
and, bang, double the price.

92
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,071
[Man #1]
Now where did she go?

93
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,173
I can assure you,
we will try to avoid that.

94
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,611
Like I said,

95
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,947
we fire our guns in town,
it's twice the pay.

96
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,582
That's the deal.

97
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,056
We're going to Dallas, boys.

98
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,092
[Men laughing]
I'm real sorry
about your daughter.

99
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,902
Two thousand dollars
for "Champagne" Charlie Austin!

100
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,873
- [Men whooping]
- [gunshots]

101
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,508
Hyah!
Hyah!

102
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,061
[bell tolling]

103
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,908
[footsteps approaching]

104
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,082
[sighs]

105
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,520
[Irish accent]
Can I get a bottle
of whiskey down here?

106
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,491
My own mouth
is trying to kill me.

107
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,695
Pardon me.
Bottle of whiskey.

108
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,965
Anything brown water
whiskey'd be nice.

109
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,468
Ya Irish prick.

110
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,373
Oh, Lordy.
Bless you, darling.

111
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,176
Mmm. Mmm!

112
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,045
[coughing]
Hey!

113
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,847
What the hell is that?
Turpentine.

114
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,950
What are you doing?

115
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,986
Don't drink any more of that.
It was supposed to be a joke.

116
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,621
Yeah, well, I was hoping
it'd kill me.

117
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:52,358
[chuckles]
You know, there is
a dentist in town.

118
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,694
Yeah, well,
I think doctoring...

119
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:58,197
is no better
than petty sheep thieving,

120
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,832
which I used to be
really good at.

121
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,803
Isn't the dying man
gonna ask my name?

122
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,941
Pardon me. You are?

123
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,043
Katherine.

124
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,780
Well, Nurse Katherine,

125
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,583
can I offer you a taste?
[chuckles]

126
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,685
Ladies don't drink whiskey.

127
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,087
I like that.

128
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,422
But I bet you're lying.

129
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,028
[exhales]

130
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,831
Well, Jim,
[chuckles]

131
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,933
Doc Seegars is not
too far away from here.

132
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,502
I'm sure he could fix
that dreadful tooth.

133
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,071
I could walk you over there
if you like.

134
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,443
You're kindly persuasive.

135
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,750
Let me pay the man.
[coins clinking]

136
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,917
Shit.

137
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,362
Shall we?
Lead the way.

138
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,698
Thanks for nothing.

139
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,238
[James] You know,
what say we just go back
to my place at the Cherry?

140
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,106
I don't want you
to have a toothache...

141
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,975
when you escort me to dinner
this evening.

142
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,610
Oh, we got dinner plans
this evening?

143
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,478
Unless you have someone else
to take.

144
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,449
I'll see you
at the St. Charles
in a couple hours, Jim.

145
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,850
See you then, Nurse.

146
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,222
Oh, sweet God in heaven,
Lord God help us.

147
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,534
Hello?

148
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,971
Mister-- Or, uh, Dr. Seegars?

149
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,606
[Man, slurring]
He's not here!

150
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,278
He's away for the month to, uh,

151
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,146
wherever the hell.

152
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,650
You need some teeth made?
We don't do that anymore.

153
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,285
No, I'll just keep
my teeth, thanks.

154
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,920
He's gone for a month?

155
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,788
I'm afraid so.

156
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,759
- You're a dentist, then?
- Aye. Dr. Holliday.

157
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,095
That's what they put
on the sign.

158
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,430
I got a tooth that's trying
to put me under.

159
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,065
Well, have a seat.

160
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,269
Let me just grab
some equipment.

161
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,714
[sighs, coughs]

162
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,619
[James]
What are you doing?

163
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,488
What, are you
gonna get drunk?

164
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,356
Uh, no.

165
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,925
This is for you.

166
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,495
And you are gonna
want to have some.

167
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,268
Fires of hell...

168
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,304
mixed with the waters
from heaven.
[coughs]

169
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,676
Ahh.

170
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,545
Tell me, what's your name?

171
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,216
- Greg.
- Greg.

172
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,085
Do you have
a high tolerance for pain?

173
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,720
What?
Never mind.

174
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,888
Open.

175
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,457
[ James ]
Ow!

176
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,793
[screaming]

177
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,398

00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,707
I am now.

352
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,809
[gunfire stops]
He's out.

353
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,882
- Get your hands up!
- [gunshot]

354
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,685
[gunshots]

355
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,889
[cocks]

356
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,523
- Where's Tower?
- Dead!

357
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:31,062
[crying out]

358
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,237
[groans]

359
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,106
Come on.

360
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,857
[gunfire continues]

361
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,483
Gonna have to head up
into that brush soon.

362
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,586
We can't outrun them
in this wagon.

363
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,987
But I didn't
do nothing wrong.

364
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,388
I shouldn't be
turning off nowhere.

365
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,023
Listen here, friend.

366
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,359
I ain't stopping,
so you can get off
any time you like.

367
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,695
Yeah, but I was
on here first.

368
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,096
Come on!

369
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,600
Look. This ride
came equipped with a sh--

370
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,534
Shit!

371
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,972
Damn it! Hold on!

372
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,278
Hey.

373
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,614
That wheel ain't
gonna last much longer.

374
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,183
What are you doing?
They're right behind us.

375
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,489
Quite a distance,
but it's that stage.

376
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,825
Let's go.
Hyah!

377
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,927
You wanna come with me,
you can.

378
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,262
If you are, get your ass
out of that seat.

379
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,897
Shit!

380
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,337
[two gunshots]
[horses whinny]

381
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,577
Come on out, you cowards!
I got no gun!

382
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,446
Show yourself!

383
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,015
You wanna be quiet?

384
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,117
I had to shoot the horses.

385
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:10,088
Shot the horses?
Are you out of your mind?

386
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,424
It'll draw too much attention
to ourselves...

387
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,694
if we ride into town
on somebody else's
branded horses.

388
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:20,131
Well, we're not exactly
in town, are we, Will?

389
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,233
That there
is the Brazos River,

390
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,737
and on the other side of it
is Granbury.

391
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:29,007
I tell you, your fella
in this Granbury...

392
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,342
better put some money
in my pocket real quick,

393
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,912
'cause I don't kill people
for it.

394
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,547
I don't kill people
for it.

395
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,583
Your gang shot up
the whole place.

396
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,787
That ain't me.
Do you understand?

397
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,692
When we get to town,
my friend can help us out.

398
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,794
But if you go back
to Dallas,

399
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,597
you're gonna have
a real hard time talking
your way out of a noose.

400
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,400
I'm just still trying...

401
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,903
to grasp just exactly
what the hell happened there.

402
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,407
All I know is
I gotta get my money back.

403
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,677
I have to get my money back.

404
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,545
Who am I to say you can't?

405
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,684
But we both know you ain't
never gonna see it again.

406
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,786
Come on. Let's get moving.

407
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,187
Just gotta swim across.

408
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,494
Can't do it.

409
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,596
What do you mean,
you can't do it?

410
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,398
Can't do it.
Not gonna do it.

411
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,201
Well, if you don't swim
across it, you're gonna
have to go around.

412
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,836
You know how long
you'll be walking for?

413
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,471
Two minutes ago,
I had a horse.

414
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,573
I told you, when we get to town,
my friend Benson...

415
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,675
can get us horses, ammo,
whatever we need.

416
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:41,646
Can't do it. Can't do it.

417
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,682
[chuckles]

418
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:47,952
You can't swim.

419
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,390
You job-stealing
son of a bitch,
you can't swim.

420
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,492
I can't swim?

421
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,397
I'll see you in town, Will,

422
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:03,368
but I better get
some real money, real quick.

423
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,937
Here I go.

424
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,105
Mm-hmm.

425
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,440
I'm gonna get in there.

426
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,842
[grunts]

427
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,579
[water splashing]
Oh, it's freezing.
All right.

428
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,915
All right.
I can't swim.

429
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,352
[chuckles]

430
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,958
[James, indistinct]

431
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,461
[Will]
Will you just try to swim?

432
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,031
Come on. Help me.
Come on.

433
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,666
Come on. Here we go.

434
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,702
Come on.
Move it on there.

435
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,206
[men whooping]

436
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,074
Let's go.

437
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:47,278
Shut up.
Watch your line.

438
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,986
[pins clacking]
[Man]
Past the line!

439
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,088
[Men shouting]

440
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,161
[Man]
Come on, come on.

441
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,599
Knock 'em down!
Right now. Let's go.

442
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,467
Knock 'em down.

443
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:15,306
I never interfere with a man
while he's bowling.

444
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,343
[Man] Come on, brother.
Knock them down.
Knock them down.

445
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,912
[Men shouting]

446
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,350
Come on!

447
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,722
[grunts]

448
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,057
- [clack]
- [Men groaning]

449
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,663
You're losing us money!
Get back! Damn it!

450
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,298
Come on!

451
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,502
I might just place myself down
for a game today.

452
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,071
Take on you and Spears.

453
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,341
I'm not gonna stand here
and let you lose it for me,
you bastard!

454
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,677
Ah. Here's one.
If you would
stop screaming--

455
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,246
"As he was valiant, I honor him.

456
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:59,217
But as he was ambitious,
I slew him."

457
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,487
Caesar. Easy.

458
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,589
Well, well done.
I'm gonna
slap your face,

459
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,691
my brother, Lord help me.

460
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,260
I would love the challenge,
but I'm enlisted to the bar.

461
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,662
I could use some help.
[men shouting]

462
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,530
[cocking]

463
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,464
Kid?

464
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,333
Whoa.
[cocks]

465
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,340
Damn it!

466
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,077
Ten-Pin Alley will be closed
the rest of the day!

467
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,347
I do not condone killing...

468
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,383
over wagers on my property.

469
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,420
Take it outta town!

470
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,463
Will you have Stillworth
clean this mess up?

471
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,565
Of course.

472
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,368
I'll be at the saloon
this evening.

473
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,171
[Man]
What about my $16?

474
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,974
[Man #2]
What aboutmy$16?

475
00:32:56,207 --> 00:33:00,411
Funny thing, those two
were on the same team.

476
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,214
I'll see you
in the bar, kid.

477
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,402
Hyah!

478
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,905
I told you, Charlie,
if you want my carrots,
get them at the store.

479
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,343
Throw your legs over.
Throw your legs over.

480
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,445
Come on.
Put your weight on me.
[groaning]

481
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,080
I got you. I got you.

482
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,416
Grab his hat, Maggie.

483
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,219
My whole right side...

484
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,087
feels pretty numb.
Right here.

485
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,189
What can I do?
What should I do?

486
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,226
Nothing.
I'm just gonna hold his head.
He's fine.

487
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,029
Hey, hey, hey!
I got his head.
He's all right.

488
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:55,233
Dad! Messed all over
the storefront, Moon!

489
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,802
Just step aside, Tompson.
Step aside.

490
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,437
Someone's gonna
clean this up.
I'll clean it up.

491
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,838
I got it.
No. No, Maggie.

492
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,473
You get yourself something
nice for your birthday.

493
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,276
Go ahead. Please.
Go on now.

494
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,612
It's gonna be all right, Johnny.
They're gonna fix you up, okay?

495
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,181
I'm sorry.

496
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,582
I'm sorry about
your birthday, Maggie.

497
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,918
It's okay.
Come on. Let's go.

498
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,553
Can you walk?
Yeah.

499
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,655
Watch your head.

500
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,757
You'll be all right.

501
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,326
[birds twittering]

502
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,728
Hey, Maggie.

503
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,465
Got these birds in
from Tennessee.

504
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,801
You wanna take a look?

505
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,610
Dad!

506
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,647
Got a mess out here!

507
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,085
Just have to put
a little pressure on it now.
[groans]

508
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,354
Moon,

509
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,624
I don't see you in town much.

510
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,493
How's your family?

511
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,062
My son had a fall.
Broke his arm pretty good.

512
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,566
Well, you know Doc Bates
isn't a medicine man.

513
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,201
He's a doctor of the Lord.

514
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,536
I didn't ask you
to come in here, Gordon.

515
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,806
[Gordon]
The building is mine.

516
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,609
I just came by to collect
from the good doctor here.

517
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,346
It's gonna take
a good long while
to heal.

518
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,981
I don't have anything
for pain right now,

519
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,017
but I might have
a little laudanum.

520
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,652
Yes, sir.

521
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,791
Can you sit up?

522
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,659
Gotta sit up.

523
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,462
How those horses
working out for you, Moon?

524
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,199
I got your payment for you,
but I need to get them oats
you promised me.

525
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,834
I need them today.

526
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,936
I tell you what,
why don't you take Kelly here?

527
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,739
And he'll lend a hand for you,

528
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,943
seeing as how your son
is in-- incapacitated.

529
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,578
I'm obliged to you.

530
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,148
I'll be back in town
day after tomorrow.

531
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,250
I'll have some trade
with me.

532
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,819
Mr. Gordon,
I'm supposed to be working
at the saloon tonight.

533
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,556
Well, now you
are helping him.

534
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,359
[Gordon]
Come by later in the evening.

535
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,694
Oh, and, Moon,

536
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,329
never a day goes by...

537
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,599
where my heart doesn't mourn
for the loss of your wife.

538
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,037
Don't you ever mention my wife.

539
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,475
Johnny, you're gonna
need to keep that arm
elevated, okay?

540
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,278
You know what that means?
All right?

541
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,015
The break was really clean,
but it's gonna take a long time
for that bone to heal.

542
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,650
You understand?

543
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,752
Yes, sir.
Okay.

544
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,788
All right.
Thank you, Doc.

545
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,657
I haven't forgotten
what you done
for me, Jones.

546
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,058
Go ahead. Get that door.

547
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,115
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

548
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,254
- It's pretty, right?
- That dress is expensive.

549
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,122
It comes from New York City.

550
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,859
I was just admiring it.

551
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:18,436
That man was killed by Indians
just outside this town.

552
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,472
So you're gonna
have to forgive
my store policy...

553
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:25,209
when I don't do business
with savages.

554
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,611
Even half-breeds.

555
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,647
Miss Abigail Peterson,
you come right on in.

556
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,983
You know, I got
that lace in you ordered.

557
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,085
You are just gonna die.

558
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:46,697
[muttering]

559
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,535
[Jones]
Maggie.

560
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,104
Give him this
with a little bit of honey.

561
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,812
[sighs]

562
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,688
You good to walk
back to town?

563
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,359
Make sure you put those bags
in the barn, too.

564
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,777
[door opens]

565
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,629
Well, it's not raining outside.

566
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,731
You two look smarter
than to bathe
with your clothes on.

567
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,768
But I'll leave explanation
to imagination.

568
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,804
Consider the first one
on the house.

569
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,439
That's very kind of you.

570
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:12,410
Not at all. I'm obliged.

571
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,679
[bottle uncorks]

572
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,249
[Will sighs]

573
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,519
Uh,

574
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,621
as Shakespeare said,

575
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:27,358
"So wise so young,
they say do never live long."

576
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,693
Well, I'll pretend
I know what that means.

577
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,562
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

578
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,569
[James]
Mmm! All the way down.

579
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,839
Again, I suppose.
For us.

580
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,642
Sorry, friend.
We can't afford to be buying
bartenders drinks.

581
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,211
Tsk, tsk, friend.
On me.

582
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,481
The last bottle
of Gordon's favorite.

583
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,583
God knows
where it comes from.

584
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,853
Can't say I ever drank
with a barkeep before.

585
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:59,356
Well, gentlemen,
we're not exactly
overrun here.

586
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,459
[clears throat]
I'm feeling a bit under myself.

587
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,327
I could use the medicine.

588
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,130
We're looking
for a friend of mine.

589
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,232
Bill Benson.
Robert Bill Benson.

590
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,867
He lives here.

591
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,903
I can't--
[coughs]

592
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,305
[coughs]

593
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,940
[coughing]

594
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,575
Christ, brother.

595
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,012
I'm due for another.

596
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,815
Bill Benson?

597
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,450
He's dead.

598
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,421
Buried at our cemetery.

599
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,224
I'll take you there.
Five cents.

600
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,326
[laughs]

601
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,829
Look, kid, you know,
I find that hard
to believe.

602
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,698
But I appreciate
the offer.

603
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,800
We're gonna need
some horses while
we're here in town.

604
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,070
Well, see,
that there would be me.

605
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,573
Well, you're a horse,
huh?

606
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:53,077
"One may smile and smile,
and be a villain."

607
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,880
John, you know Gordon's
got anything...

608
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,916
these fellas might require.

609
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,317
Kelly's good people.

610
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,653
He can help you men find...

611
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,522
what or whoever
you're looking for.

612
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,390
We good here?
[James]
No.

613
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,127
Another round.
It's been quite a morning.

614
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,397
So you say you got horses,
is that right?

615
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:21,572
Yeah, I-- I--
I got some horses, sure.

616
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,207
I just, um--

617
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:27,878
Look, I don't
have them personally.

618
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,652
Now, y'all men up
for details?

619
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,754
Cancel them drinks.

620
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,856
Ain't got time
for your bullshit, kid.

621
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,958
Hmph! Kid.

622
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:45,863
Well, y'all got the questions
I got the answers to.

623
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,176
[coughing]

624
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,045
[Kelly]
John?

625
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,913
John!

626
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,950
Get Dr. Bates!

627
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,256
I'm not gonna lie
to you, John.

628
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,759
This stuff
tastes terrible.

629
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,796
[coughing]

630
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,131
I need you to drink it
all the way down, okay?

631
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:27,671
[gags]

632
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,708
[coughs]

633
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,277
[John coughs]

634
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:41,919
[breathing heavily]

635
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,021
Kelly, get out of here.

636
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,196
I'll be a moment.

637
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:58,035
You heard him. Move.

638
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:05,042
He's been in
and out of consciousness
for about an hour.

639
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,786
John,

640
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,421
I'm here.

641
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,924
Jesus, you're pale as a ghost.

642
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,727
[sighs]
Funny that you say that,

643
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,764
because I feel...

644
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,099
like I've been one
for quite some time.

645
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:33,771
There anything
I can do for you?

646
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,340
I just want you
to sit down.

647
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,580
Doc, may we have a moment?

648
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,150
[Bates]
Yeah. I'll be right outside.

649
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,792
I want you
to do something for me.

650
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,894
I can do that.

651
00:44:56,894 --> 00:45:00,397
I think you'd be better off
to just rest now.

652
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,835
Doc Bates says...

653
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:08,572
I probably won't make it
through the night.

654
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:12,076
I want to confess
in front of God...

655
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,178
and in front
of someone I trust.

656
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,448
I afraid
I'm not following you.

657
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,119
1865.

658
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,221
Ford Theatre,

659
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,323
Washington.

660
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:30,294
I walked into
the private seating...

661
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:33,097
of the president
of the United States.

662
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:37,067
I pointed a Colt pistol
to the back of his head,

663
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:41,972
and I pulled the trigger,
point-blank.

664
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,709
I fled to Virginia.

665
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:51,081
By the grace of God,
I escaped,

666
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,052
and I've lived like a rat
ever since.

667
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,387
What do you want me to say?

668
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:00,891
I don't want you
to say anything, Henry.

669
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,993
I'm telling you...

670
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,796
that my name
is not St. Helens.

671
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,767
My name is John Booth,

672
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,270
the assassin
of Abraham Lincoln.

673
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,941
Look, John,

674
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,576
you're sick.

675
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,912
You need rest.

676
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,248
I know how this sounds,

677
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,751
and I know you have no
good right to believe me,

678
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,722
but I want you
to understand...

679
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:35,459
that what I'm saying
to you is truth.

680
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,729
And I'm telling you this,

681
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,831
my friend,

682
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,466
because when I go,

683
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,736
I want a clean slate.

684
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,006
Now, I have prayed...

685
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,874
for God's forgiveness.

686
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:54,845
The weight--

687
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:58,115
it sits inside me
where my soul once was.

688
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,684
It gets harder
to carry every day.

689
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:03,253
I'm sorry, John.

690
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,823
I need to go now.
No. Wait.

691
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,224
And you need rest.

692
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,560
[breathing heavily]
In my room--

693
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,464
In my room, under my bed,

694
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,800
beneath the floorboards...

695
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,902
is all the proof you need.

696
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,420
The gun--

697
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,755
[Gordon]
The gun that shot Lincoln...

698
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,492
was found
at the theater, John.

699
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,930
So I heard.

01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,263
Aye, a lawman.

1048
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:45,000
Deputy James McKinnon here
with Marshal Will Edwards.

1049
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,569
And we can let Kelly hang out
in our jail cell, eh?

1050
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:52,941
Whatever brought you
to Granbury anyway?

1051
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:57,613
Y'all, uh, just a part
of that James Younger gang?

1052
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,985
I mean,
you come in soaking wet,

1053
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,255
no money, no horses.

1054
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:09,992
I mean,
you're just passing through?
Come on.

1055
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,627
Everybody's got their secrets.

1056
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,962
Yeah, well, we ain't got
no secrets, thief.

1057
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,532
Yeah. That's why we hightailed
it out of there so quick, huh?

1058
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,101
[chanting stops]

1059
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,539
The drumming stopped.

1060
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:26,342
What, y'all rob
a bank or something?
Is that it?

1061
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,144
Three hundred dollars?

1062
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:31,714
Y'all are running
from something else.

1063
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:34,283
Yeah, why don't you not worry
about that $300, aye?

1064
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,553
If it was your business,
then worry about it.
But it ain't, so don't.

1065
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,356
Tell you what
I'm gonna do.

1066
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:43,625
I'm gonna have myself
a sip of this whiskey,

1067
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,662
and thank the Lord
that I'm not a ghost today.

1068
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:52,267
Hey, Kelly, why don't you
head up there and keep watch?

1069
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,837
What, are you gonna let me
use your gun?

1070
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,705
No.

1071
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,508
But if you see something,
wake me.

1072
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,143
I'll go shoot it.

1073
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,245
[laughing]

1074
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,114
That's real funny.

1075
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,420
And keep your hands
out of my pockets while I rest.

1076
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,223
Steal one watch--

1077
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,784
Make sure your gun's showing.

1078
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:43,886
I don't have any bullets.
Don't matter.

1079
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:46,688
I don't want them to think
we're hiding them.

1080
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:48,323
I thought you said
that they were friendly.

1081
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,827
I said they should be.

1082
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:53,462
Should be.

1083
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,475
[whistles]

1084
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,109
Kelly.

1085
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,445
Grab a couple
of them pelts.

1086
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,248
We're bringing the whiskey?

1087
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,817
No. The whiskey stays here
till we see what they got.

1088
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,386
[James]
Indians are sneaky.

1089
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:54,656
I should stay behind
in case they start
killing people.

1090
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,393
[scoffs]

1091
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:01,897
Come on.

1092
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:07,269
Irishman scared of
some mean old Indians?

1093
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,305
Hey. Hey!

1094
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,809
I'll just stay here,
then, yeah?

1095
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,546
Guard the whiskey?

1096
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,896
[speaking in native language]

1097
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:36,698
Kutseena! Kutseena!

1100
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,640
[shouting continues]

1101
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,077
[Kelly]
Morning.

1102
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:50,712
English?

1103
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,917
English. Yes.

1104
01:15:56,785 --> 01:16:00,522
You have face
of hungry men.

1105
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:07,062
Well, uh, yeah.

1106
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,631
If you could spare some food,
we'd be mighty grateful.

1107
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,200
My name is Will.
This here is--

1108
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,069
This here is Kelly.

1109
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:16,171
Kutseena.

1110
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,675
P￩kwimake you strong.

1111
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,879
My gift to you.

1112
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,514
[rattling]

1113
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,221
Take, uh, this fur.

1114
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,491
It'll fetch you a big price.

1115
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,061
[speaks native language]

1116
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:42,798
[rattling continues]

1117
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:48,403
[screaming]
Snake!

1118
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:52,374
My eyes see three white men.
Why does one hide?

1119
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,345
- He is not hiding.
- No, he was just tired.

1120
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,512
[James screaming]

1121
01:16:57,746 --> 01:17:01,950
We have much to carry.
He has much to trade.

1122
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:03,352
I'll, uh--

1123
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,454
Snake!

1124
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,322
Snake!
I'll bring him.

1125
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:08,957
I'll--
Snake!

1126
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,826
A snake!

1127
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,629
A snake!

1128
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,263
[speaks native language]

1129
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:18,767
You hungry.

1130
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,636
Oh.
[native language]

1131
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,971
Thanks.

1132
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,307
Thank you.

1133
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:32,581
[panting]

1134
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:35,150
It's a-- It's a snake.

1135
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,420
I killed it.

1136
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,690
Yeah. He came over here,

1137
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:45,193
and I killed him
with my knife.

1138
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,398
- I hate snakes.
- Hate snakes.

1139
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:57,105
[donkey braying]

1140
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,477
Hello.

1141
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,083
[grunts]
How's that fish?

1142
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:11,820
[Kelly]
Oh, it's--
It's real good, actually.

1143
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:15,791
So that right there
is a really fine animal
you got.

1144
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:20,929
Where are your horses?

1145
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:23,965
The horses, they died,

1146
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:27,469
because--
because we ate them.

1147
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,805
[chokes, clears throat]

1148
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,907
[Will]
What, uh--
[snorts]

1149
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,009
What my friend meant to say
was that, uh,

1150
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:38,447
we had some horses
grow sickly,

1151
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:41,016
and we had to put them down.

1152
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:44,986
We would like
to trade you for your mule.

1153
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:47,789
Lighten our load.

1154
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,161
Whitepuukunot for trade.

1155
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:58,767
We have beads--
fine beads for trade
for you.

1156
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:01,103
For furs.

1157
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:03,672
[laughs]
Now, listen here, Chief.

1158
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,774
That's just not--
Yes!

1159
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,110
We will.
We would very much...

1160
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,679
like to trade you
for your beads.

1161
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:14,182
And we will make you
many great offerings.

1162
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,058
[man speaking
native language]

1163
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,160
[no audible dialogue]

1164
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:30,766
- Thanks.
- Well, now, that's
a lovely turtle shell.

1165
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,269
Ooh. Yeah.

1166
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,072
These are beautiful beads.

1167
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:38,940
Very fine beads.

1168
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:41,276
Yeah. Very beautiful.

1169
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,947
Okay. Why don't you
have a look at those?

1170
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:47,582
Ooh.

1171
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:50,852
Hey, uh, James,
you wanna help with this stuff.

1172
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:52,487
Oh, you need some help, Will?

1173
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:53,655
That's okay, Kelly.

1174
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:55,757
Why don't you stay here...

1175
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:58,560
and explain
to these fine gentlemen...

1176
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:01,596
why James ate our horse.

1177
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:04,399
[clears throat]

1178
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:08,603
Oh, um--

1179
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:11,173
You know,
you would never believe it.

1180
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:13,041
We were at the ridge.

1181
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:16,545
You know, back up a ways,
only about a mile out.

1182
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:18,647
You'd never im-imagine...

1183
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,683
what we--
[sighs]
ran into.

1184
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,953
But it was a herd of cougars.

1185
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,522
I never seen anything
like it in my life.

1186
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:30,325
They come after us,
pounce on the horse.
[whispering]

1187
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:31,960
Thing goes down.

1188
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,829
I mean,
I really liked that horse.

1189
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,164
And we had to
be carrying these furs.

1190
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:39,201
The horse's name was, uh--
was, uh,

1191
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:41,303
you know, uh, Billy.

1192
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,872
And it was a good horse.
That's enough.

1193
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,740
Good story. Good story.
They-- They--

1194
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:48,777
[clears throat]
Kelly. Okay.

1195
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:50,879
Well--
[clears throat]

1196
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:55,083
Now,

1197
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,419
as the sun beats down
on our faces,

1198
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:01,156
I'd like to share
an Irish custom with you,

1199
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:04,893
my new Indian friends.

1200
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,528
[quietly]
Now we're trading the whiskey?

1201
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,864
[quietly]
Yes. We're trading
the whiskey.

1202
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:10,732
It better be
out of your share.

1203
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:12,367
That's fine. It is.
[James clears throat]

1204
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:17,272
In this bottle
are the fires from hell...

1205
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:20,542
mixed with the waters
from the heavens.

1206
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:22,410
And when you drink it,

1207
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:26,147
you will become
a fierce warrior.

1208
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:31,753
Now, at first,
it tastes like you're dying,

1209
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:36,191
and then
it's Christmas morning...

1210
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,293
for the rest of the evening.

1211
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,862
[cork pops]

1212
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:49,271
[sniffs]

1213
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:56,978
[clears throat]

1214
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:05,854
[coughs]

1215
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:08,890
[shouts]
[Will]
Hey, hey!

1216
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:12,861
- [laughs] All right!
- Good. Here you go. Here.
Here's a couple more.

1217
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:16,131
[James]
We got plenty of whiskey.
Let's all have a drink.

1218
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,299
Yeah. Why don't we
all have some?

1219
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:19,167
Come on, Kelly.
Raise your glass.

1220
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,605
[Kelly laughs]

1221
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,941
Why don't you
pass that around?
Yeah.

1222
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,809
Ugh!
[coughing]

1223
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:30,145
Burns the belly,
don't it, good, Kelly?

1224
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:31,546
[Kelly coughing]
[James]
Drink up!

1225
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,415
Drink up, drink up.

1226
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:37,152
Whiskey.
[Men coughing]

1227
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,355
[coughing continues]

1228
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,838
[no audible dialogue]

1229
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,922
[birds chirping]

1230
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:23,024
[rooster crows]

1231
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,329
[groans]

1232
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:09,971
You've managed to make it
through another night.

1233
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,014
I'm going downstairs,
John.

1234
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,226
I'm gonna get myself
something to eat.

1235
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,963
[footsteps departing]

1236
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:47,809
[sighs]

1237
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,677
[coughs]

1238
01:25:58,086 --> 01:25:59,954
[groans]

1239
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:06,261
[breathing heavily]

1240
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:55,343
[groans]

1241
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:57,679
[groans]

1242
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:04,452
[groans]

1243
01:27:06,087 --> 01:27:08,189
Where's my satchel?

1244
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:10,525
[footsteps approaching]

1245
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:17,999
Hey, what are y'all doing?
[grunts]

1246
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:32,480
Hurry up.
We gotta keep moving.

1247
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,582
I'd gladly trade places
with you, Will.

1248
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,451
Come on. Come on.

1249
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,086
Hyah!

1250
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:42,757
[whimpering]

1251
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:48,129
You take our food,

1252
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:50,231
our trade.

1253
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,333
Why?

1254
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:54,669
I didn't take anything from you.
[shouts]

1255
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:55,837
[cries out]

1256
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,172
[groaning]

1257
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:00,041
[Kelly sobbing]
Ourpuuku,

1258
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:02,844
our fur--

1259
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:05,179
gone!

1260
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:07,515
Men you came with--
[coughing]

1261
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:09,150
gone!

1262
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:11,719
They wouldn't just leave me!
They wouldn't just--

1263
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:14,289
They wanted to steal my satchel!

1264
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:16,624
Will!

1265
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:20,128
[cries out]
[shouting in native language]

1266
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:23,398
You...

1267
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:26,901
will take us to them!

1268
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:29,937
And if we don't find them,

1269
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:33,207
pitiful white man,

1270
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,944
you will die,

1271
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:39,514
slow.

1272
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:51,893
[James]
Will!

1273
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:08,476
How much further
are you leading us up here?

1274
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:12,680
It'll be faster
if we cut through
those canyon walls.

1275
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,921
It's not as easy
as it looks, Will.

1276
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:23,658
It's too much to get down there.
We'll have to go
all the way back around.

1277
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:26,461
[blusters]

1278
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,132
If we go around,
we'll have no cover.

1279
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,402
Them Indians
are gonna find us.
We're too overloaded.

1280
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:37,438
We're sitting too heavy.
We'd have to leave
some of the load here.

1281
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:42,810
We leave nothing.
We hit that break in the canyon.

1282
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,146
We're sitting ducks out here.

1283
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:46,781
[braying]

1284
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:50,985
[thud]

1285
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,854
Shit!

1286
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:03,831
You were being
too damn careless!

1287
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:38,866
[sniffles]

1288
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:43,304
I'm-- I'm sure they're
just up ahead here.

1289
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:44,705
[twigs snap]

1290
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:50,311
Wait.

1291
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:55,216
Banshee?

1292
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,157
No.

1293
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,194
Move.

1294
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,511
Hey-- Hey--
Stupid! Stupid!

1295
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:24,679
Damn it.

1296
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:29,350
You're a madman, Will.
Here!

1297
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,452
You're a madman if you think...

1298
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:34,489
that we can carry all of this
through that opening...

1299
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,890
before those Indians
catch up to us.

1300
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:38,693
We'll be dead in an hour's time.

1301
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:41,496
Are you hearing me?
We gotta move, Will!

1302
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:43,831
Those Indians
will scalp us dead,

1303
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:46,167
and you're trying to lead us
into the gates of hell!

1304
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,269
We can carry it!

1305
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:53,174
That money--
That money that was stolen
from me in Dallas...

1306
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:55,276
had been in my pocket
for four days, Will.

1307
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,779
For four days.
I stole it from a man
sleeping on a train.

1308
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:02,750
I don't work on the railroads.
I work the railroads.

1309
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:06,254
The money's gone.
The money's gone,
but you know what?

1310
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:08,356
- I'm still here.
- I don't care!

1311
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:11,626
Don't you understand?

1312
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:13,728
Everything that we leave here...

1313
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:15,129
is like leaving gold
in the grave,

1314
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:17,932
and I will go
through the gates of hell...

1315
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:20,735
before I let them Indians
take me down,

1316
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:21,903
and so will you.

1317
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:28,442
Now, pick it up,
and let's move on.

1318
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:41,522
You got three bullets
in that gun, Will.

1319
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:44,091
I don't think you're going
to use any of them on me.

1320
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:45,960
[cocks]
Hey.

1321
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:47,595
Hey!
