00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,064
Whoa, Dan!

3
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,729
<i>- Pinky!
- Yes, sir.</i>

4
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,535
<i>- Come over here.
- Yes, sir.</i>

5
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,138
Take him back to the barn.
I'm going up to the house.

6
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,649
- Clem oughta be getting in from town.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Frank.

7
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,743
- Pinky.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,755
Ain't you never gonna learn? What's my name?

9
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,985
Why, uh, Woodson. Mr. Ben Woodson, sir.

10
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,154
Why do you call me Mr. Frank? Ain't
it just as easy to say Mr. Ben?

11
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,598
Well, seein' as I been calling you Mr. Frank
ever since you were knee-high to nothin'...

12
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,397
ain't no harm in callin' you Mr. Frank
when ain't nobody around here, is there?

13
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,270
Except that one day you're gonna forget
and bawl out Mr. Frank when folks is around.

14
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,243
Pinky, FrankJames isn't hiding
in these hills. He's dead.

15
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,007
Dead? W
- Well, you ain't dead.

16
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,278
- You callin' me a liar? -
Oh, no, sir. No, sirree, but-

17
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:09,082
Ain't no buts about it, Pinky. FrankJames
is dead and buried and underground.

18
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,625
Yes, sure. Sure he's dead and buried
and under the ground and rotted.

19
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,785
- Now remember.
- Yes, I'll remember, Mr. Frank.

20
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:34,373
Jesse
- They killed him!

21
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,940
- Jesse dead?
- Yeah. Shot through the back when he weren't lookin'.

22
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,488
Ain't no other way they could have
gotJesse. They know who done it?

23
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,491
Sure they know. It was them sneakin'
cowards, Bob and Charlie Ford.

24
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,551
Bob and Charlie, huh?

25
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,430
Poor Zee and the baby.

26
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,358
Frank, can I go with you?

27
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,460
Go with me?

28
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,039
Well, I know you don't need any help, but-

29
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,941
I reckon I don't, seein' as
I ain't aimin' to do anything.

30
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,013
What?

31
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,684
Ain't no more to be said now.

32
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,186
Tell Pinky to rustle up some supper.

33
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,555
Gosh, I was so sure you'd wanna
light out after them Fords...

34
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,651
I bought me a gun.

35
00:04:55,762 --> 00:05:00,392
<i>- [Hammer Clicks]
- Hand it over.</i>

36
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,526
I used my own money.

37
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,798
Hand it over.

38
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,847
You're getting too big
for your britches, son.

39
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,350
You got no call to be totin' a gun.

40
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,683
Well, I figured if there was any trouble-

41
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,950
There ain't gonna be no trouble.

42
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,357
Listen, son.

43
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,521
When your father was
killed up at Northfield...

44
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:36,694
I brought you down here hopin' you'd
grow up to be a regular hardworkin' man.

45
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,862
So far I got no complaints.

46
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,939
We've been gettin' along fine, you and me...

47
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,508
workin', mindin' our own business.

48
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,237
We bothered nobody. Nobody's bothered us.

49
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,439
Ain't what them Fords done bothered you none?

50
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,675
The courts will take care of the Fords.

51
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:55,083
- Supposin' they don't?
- I'm supposin' they will.

52
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,420
WhateverJesse done, he was murdered,
and the law don't hold with murder.

53
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,359
Frank, if nothin' gonna
happen to them Fords...

54
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,431
ain't some folks gonna think that...

55
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,695
<i>- well, maybe
you're- - Scared?</i>

56
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,861
- Well?
- What do you think?

57
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,532
Oh, I know you ain't scared.
You ain't scared of anything.

58
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,973
But, gosh, I wish you and me, we could-

59
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:21,569
<i>Vittles is ready. Sit down, Mr. Frank.</i>

60

61
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,481
[Singsong] Mr. Frank is dead. I
mean, Mr. Ben, Mr. Frank is dead.

62
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,323
So I mean, Mr. Ben, mmm, Mr. Ben,
I mean, Mr. Ben, Mr. Frank is dead.

63
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:40,627
So, I mean, Mr. Ben. I mean, Mr. Ben.
I mean, Mr. Ben, Mr. Frank is dead.

<i>Sinners, sons of Belial...</i>

65
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,484
prepare for the vengeance of the Lord.

66
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,686
The day of reckoning is mighty close.

67
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,027
You'll catch it hip and thigh if you don't
get to repentin'. And get to it quick.

68
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,124
Hellfire's awaitin' you. Are
you ready to meet your Maker?

69
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,863
I reckon so.

70
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,498
You willing to stand before the judgment
seat with a chaw of tobacco in your mouth?

71
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,372
<i>Lost souls, that's what you all are.</i>

72
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,946
<i>Black with sin. Black with iniquity.</i>

73
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,880
The light of the Lord ain't in any of you.

74
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,952
Do you ever think of salvation?
Do you ever think of the Kingdom?

75
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,954
No. All you ever think of is
your bellies and your cornpone...

76
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,854
<i>and your chitlins and your corn liquor.</i>

77
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,223
Brother, how about a swig of that jug?

78
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,729
- Ain't hard liquor, is it?
- No, plain spring water.

79
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,807
Oh.

80
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,247
- Crop all in?
- Yeah.

81
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,476
- You from
town? - Uh-huh.

82
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,213
- Any news?
- Hogs is up two cents.

83
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,154
<i>- Good.
- You remember about them Ford boys?</i>

84
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,316
<i>- The fellas that killed JesseJames?
- Yeah.</i>

85
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,917
- I "heared" at the telegraph office they're gonna be hanged.
- You don't tell me.

86
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,553
Uh-huh. Jury found them
guilty of murderin'Jesse.

87
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,565
Don't know why though, bein' as
there's a reward out for his killin'.

88
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,692
Revival meetin' at Clinton tomorrow night.

89
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,998
Be there, brother. It's me and
the devil and no holds barred.

90
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:30,303
[Clicking Tongue] Giddap!

91
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,045
Law's all right, huh?

92
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,750
"Beatenest" thing I ever did see.

93
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,191
It's like I figured, ain't
a jury in western Missouri...

94
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,095
would stand for shooting a friend when
he ain't lookin', no matter what he done.

95
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,463
That'll be a lesson to you, son.

96
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,378
What about us going over to that
revival meeting tomorrow night?

97
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,645
<i>I think it's safe enough if
I sort of stay in the shadows.</i>

98
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,220
I reckon you'd like to see some
other folks once in a while.

99
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,881
Oh, I ain't hankerin' to see no other folks.

100
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,981
But let's go fishin'
tomorrow, you and me, huh?

101
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,959
Sure, son, sure.

102
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,025
Here it is, Mr. Frank.

<i>[Rooster Crows]</i>

104
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,850
Ain't they hangin' 'em?

105
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,612
No, they let them off and
give them the reward money.

106
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,088
I knowed that preacher man heared wrong.

107
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,159
It's just like my pappy always said...

108
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,751
"There ain't no law for the poor
folks except the end of a gun. "

109
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,830
Hush up.

110
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,701
I was certain sure they
wasn't gonna do nothin'.

111
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,295
Did they ever do anything
for our kind of folks? No.

112
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:11,706
McCoy and his railroad stole your farm and
killed your mother. What happened? Nothin'.

113
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,542
And that timeJesse give hisself
up. Did the law treat him right?

114
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,616
Uh-

115
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,952
Pinky, saddle the horses.

116
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,620
<i>- Yes, sir!
- Just my horse.</i>

<i>- Yes, sir.
- You ain't goin' nowheres.</i>

118
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,959
Oh, please, Frank. I won't get in the way.

119
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,002
You and Pinky gotta stay here and look
after the farm. I won't be gone long.

120
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,902
Oh, Pinky can take care of things.
There ain't much to do right now.

121
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,805
The fence has gotta be finished.
The stock's gotta be taken care of.

122
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,673
- Anyways, you're too young.
- I'm no baby. I'm grown up.

123
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,577
Ain't no use arguin', Clem. The
Fords is my affair personal...

124
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,809
and you ain't goin' with me.

125
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,517
Pinky, I'm leavin' Clem in your charge.

126
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,591
- Don't let him get out of your sight.
- No, sir.

127
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,183
- See he studies his figurin' and his readin'.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Frank.

128
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,990
If you want me for anything important,
Major Cobb will know where I am.

129
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,328
<i>- Good-bye, Pinky. Good-bye,

131
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,415

- Hello.

132
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,890
- Didn't know you boys could read.
- [Laughing]

133
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,359
Hello, Connie. How's your pa?

<i>[Chattering]</i>

135
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:02,216
Whiskey. What'll it be,
boys? Bob Ford's buyin'.

136
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,899
- Have a drink, Major.
- I don't drink with rats.

137
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,308
- Watch out, Major.
- No danger. The Fords only shoot at backs.

138
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,506
- You tryin' to make trouble?
- No, but if I had my way-

139
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,482
You had your way. You
and your stinkin' paper...

140
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,780
did everything you could
to hang us, didn't ya?

141
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,855
Well, we're free now, and
we got the reward money.

142
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,186
- There isn't a thing you can do about it.
- Come, come, gentlemen.

143
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,351
Let bygones be bygones.
TheJames case is a closed issue.

144
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,656
Not by a gosh-dang sight it ain't.

145
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:49,201
And it won't be closed tillJesse's brother's
paid for every dad-blasted drop of it.

146
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,428
Your hands ain't any
too clean either, Runyan.

147
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,630
Mine? What have I done?

148
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,934
As an officer employed by
the railroad, naturally I-

149
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,772
Oh, don't pay any attention to the old
buzzard. Talk, talk, that's all he can do.

150
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,847
Yeah, that's about all I can do.

151
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,508
But thoseJames boys are mighty
peculiar. Mighty peculiar.

152
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,382
Jesse's gone, that's true.
Maybe Frank's gone too.

153
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,819
And then again, maybe he ain't.

154
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,983
<i>The boys always had a mighty
peculiar way of turning up...</i>

155
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,721
<i>just when you least expected them.</i>

156
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,060
Mighty peculiar.

157
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,374
What are your plans?

158
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,451
I'm going out West to see a friend of mine.

159
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,378
When?

160
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,060
Now.

161
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,933

My name's Eleanor Stone.
I'm a newspaper writer.

341
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,811
I was passing the hotel,
and somebody told me that-

342
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,220
A writer? You mean you
write pieces for the paper?

343
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,623
<i>Yes, a reporter for the Denver Star.</i>

344
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,788
A lady reporter?

345
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,058
Mind if I sit down? It'll be
easier for me to take notes.

346
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,329
Sure do beat all, a lady newspaperman.

347
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,769
Well, I'm not really and
truly a reporter, not yet.

348
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,501
<i>But I'm going to be. My
father's the owner of the Star.</i>

349

Maybe you've heard of him
- Randolph Stone.

350
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,846
Well, can't say I have.

351
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,347
But if he owns the paper, I should
think he'd be doing well enough...

352
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,440
so his daughter don't have to work.

353
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,781
Oh, I don't have to work.
And, if you must know...

354
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,855
my father's very much opposed to it.

355
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,115

356
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,421
and then sit around with my hands folded...

get around to marrying me.

358
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,828

They- - Not where I come from.

a dozen farmhands and raisin' kids.

362

happened about six weeks ago.

We'd been down in
Hernandez herdin' longhorns.

371
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,469
And that night we went into
town to do a little drinkin'.

372
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,311
- A boy like you?
- Ma'am, I ain't no boy.

373
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:23,080
<i>Down in Mexico, I do a man's
work and a man's drinkin'.</i>

374
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:27,022
When we got to WhiskeyJoe's, there was a
drunken crowd there from another ranch...

375
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,093
a
- roughin' things up.

376
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,856
FrankJames- Oh, I've seen
him a couple times before-

377
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:36,366
he was up at the bar, drinkin'
quiet and mindin' his own business.

378
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,833
You taking this down in
that newfangled shorthand?

379
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,429
Oh, no, just making notes as
I would in classes. Go ahead.

380
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,008
So, this crowd from the other ranch was a
- whoopin' it up...

381
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,509
especially the foreman,
a fella they call Red-

382
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:51,708
Oh, like this
- when a girl comes in the place.

383
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:56,253
Oh, a little girl, maybe 10
or 12, lookin' for her pa.

384
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:00,290
Red makes a grab for her, and
she starts cryin' and a-screamin'.

385
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,724
And that plumb annoys Frank.

386
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,854
He comes over from the bar...

387
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,264
and he pulls the girl away from
Red and knocks him a-kickin'.

388
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,531
<i>Right away I knows there's
gonna be trouble in bushel lots.</i>

389
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,868

gang runs out of the place.</i>

390
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,442
It bein' none of my ruckus,
I ducks behind the bar.

391
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,444
But Frank don't scare any.

392
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,982
He pulls his gun and stands
with his back up against the bar.

393
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,281
It's one against 12 or 15. Red
and his crew start blazin' away.

394
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,049
And Frank's blazin' right
back. He knocks off two guys...

395
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,124
and then gets hit himself in the left arm.

396
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,716
<i>Well, to make it short, he finishes off Red.</i>

397
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,729
Good. Good!

398
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,924

- Uh, where was I?</i>

400
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,897
Oh, yeah. He finishes off Red
and five or six of his gang.

401
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,407
By this time, Frank himself
is leakin' like a sieve.

402
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,444
He's down on the ground,
dyin', but still fightin'...

403
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,604
when a slug gets him in the heart.

404
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,740
Then the fellas that are left
empty their guns into him.

405
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,309
- Oh, the cowards!
- This belonged to Frank.

- Look like?

than 16 or so. Light, curly hair.

What did he look like?

514
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,278
Hmm, he was a man about 29 to 30...

515
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,253
six feet tall, maybe more.

516
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,689
Hard to tell. Walks with a sort of stoop.

517
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:19,285
Has blue eyes and rather high cheekbones.

518
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:22,593
Speaks with a slow drawl,
but doesn't say much.

519
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,430
Yes. What did you say his name was?

520
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,800
Woodson. Ben Woodson.

521
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,203
Woodson. He here now?

522
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:33,834
No. They told me over at the hotel that
he'd suddenly been called away on business.

- Your friend Woodson...

It's all very simple, my dear.

535
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,110
You see, Frank had two very good
reasons for wanting to be dead:

536
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:18,711
The express robbery in Missouri
and his friends, the Fords.

537
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,051
I don't believe it.

538
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,685
He wouldn't do that.

539

- Oh, quite.

01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,953
I haven't practiced in nigh unto 20 years...

812
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,828
<i>not since I took over the
Gazette, and I may be a mite rusty.</i>

813
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:47,425
Ah, rusty or not, you can do as
much for me as any other lawyer...

814
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:49,527
and I reckon that ain't
hardly anything at all.

815
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:53,768
Maybe so, maybe so. But we ain't quittin'.

816
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:56,538
McCoy and that gosh-dinged
Yankee prosecutor of his...

817
01:06:56,645 --> 01:07:00,103
will be breathin' mighty heavy
before I'm through with them.

818
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:04,710
<i>- [Gavel Rapping]
- [Bailiff] Order in the court! Order in the court!</i>

819
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,550
- [Gavel Rapping]
- Everybody stand.

820
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:10,181
Court is now in session. Hear ye-

821
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,283
That ain't the regular judge, is it?

822
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:14,795
No, that's Ferris. They
brought him on from St. Louis.

823
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,888
- Just to make
sure, eh? - Uh-huh.

824
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:20,662
<i>...is now in session. Be seated.
- [Gavel Bangs]</i>

825
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:24,035
<i>Your Honor, the case on
the docket is number 4358.</i>

826
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,200
State of Missouri v. FrankJames.

827
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,405
<i>[Judge Ferris] You may proceed.</i>

828
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:34,214
Not only did he rob the express office...

829
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:39,879
but we will prove beyond the
slightest peradventure of a doubt...

830
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,514
that the defendant, FrankJames...

831
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,753
in keeping with his long, murderous career-

832
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:49,763
I object! The defendant's not on trial in
this court for a long, murderous career...

833
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:52,060
any more than the prosecuting
attorney is charged...

834
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,398
with being in the pay of the
St. Louis Midland Railway.

835
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:58,405
- I resent the innuendo!
- Then stick to the charges in the indictment!

836
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:01,203
- I'm not asking you, sir,
what- - Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

837
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:04,074
Gentlemen!

838
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:09,550
Now, gentlemen, I propose to have this trial
conducted in a quiet and orderly manner.

839
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:13,588
The prosecutor will confine himself to
the matter contained in the true bill.

840
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,624
And you, sir, will
refrain from personalities.

841
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:20,126
<i>Thejury will ignore the
exchange between counsel.</i>

842
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:23,630
<i>We are not concerned with crimes other
than those mentioned in the indictment.</i>

843
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,757
<i>And we certainly are not concerned...</i>

844
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:28,564
<i>with the railroad associations
of the prosecuting attorney.</i>

845
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:31,265
I object, Your Honor. There
have been no associations.

846
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:34,831
I am not aware that I have said
there were. You may proceed.

847
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:41,974
The State will prove...

848
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:45,417
not only did the defendant
rob the express office...

849
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:50,117
but also that he shot down the
watchman, Wilson, in cold blood.

850
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:55,630
<i>The State calls its first
witness, Sheriff Daniels.</i>

851
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,722
<i>[Bailiff] Sheriff Daniels.</i>

852
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,267
You say FrankJames admitted
robbing the express office.

853
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,394
Yes, he did, and before witnesses.

854
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,905
I didn't ask you before whom.
You just answer my questions.

855
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:08,534
<i>- That'll be enough of a strain on that giant intellect of yours.
- [Laughter]</i>

856
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:16,146
- Did FrankJames also admit killing the watchman?
- No.

857
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,277
- He denied it.
- Yes.

858
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:22,187
He said Dan was killed by
a shot from the outside.

859
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,020
- How long you been sheriff?
- Two years.

860
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,427
Before that, what'd you do?

861
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,434
I object, Your Honor!
What possible bearing...

862
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:38,598
can the former occupation of
the witness have on this trial?

863
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:43,144
I see no objection to the
question. You may answer it.

864
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:48,683
- I was in charge of... special police.
- Who for?

865
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:53,551
- [Softly] St. Louis Midland Railway.
- Louder! And speak to the jury.

866
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:57,319
<i>- St. Louis Midland Railway.
- That's all.</i>

867
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:04,462
Your Honor, I must take exception
to this line of questioning.

868
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:09,027
My learned opponent, in his desperation...

869
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,299
is trying to make it appear
that the railroad company...

870
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,841
and not the state of Missouri
is prosecuting this defendant.

871
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:17,811
- The court is under no deception.
- Oh, of that I'm quite certain.

872
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:20,211
But that there be no doubt
in the minds of the jury...

873
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,409
I am about to produce five witnesses-

874
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,248
none of whom is connected
even remotely with the Midland-

875
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,515
who were present when FrankJames confessed.

876
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:31,855
Tain't necessary. We admit
FrankJames robbed the express office.

877
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:35,260
[Chattering]

878
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:38,629
- That's the case.
- Yep. Thought the major would talk about duress or something.

879
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:42,135
<i>- Or at least make the State prove it.
- Why, certainly.</i>

880
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,447
- What are you doing here?
- I had to come.

881
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:02,752
Anyhow, there ain't no sense in me
hidin' out. Nobody's worryin' about me.

882
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,759
- How's it goin' in there?
- Not so well.

883
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:08,955
Suppose it'd do Frank any good if I was
to tell them the robbery was my idea?

884
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:12,295
No. No, there's nothing
you or I or anybody can do.

885
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,426
We've just got to wait and hope.

886
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:18,734
Yeah? Well, we wouldn't be doin' no
hopin' or waitin' if it wasn't for you.

887
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,742
Why didn't you leave Frank alone?
What'd you have to keep after him for?

888
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,869
If you hadn't stuck your nose in it...

889
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,970
we'd have got Bob Ford
and nobody'd got Frank.

890
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:28,447
Now, on account of you,
they're gonna hang him.

891
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:38,251
Raise your right hand, place your left hand
on the Bible. Do you swear to tell the truth...

892
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,351
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

893
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,521
- I do.
- Sit down.

894
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:48,828
- You're FrankJames?
- No doubt about that.

895
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,132
Why are you here?

896
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,231
- Why?
- Yeah. You weren't captured.

897
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,640
- You weren't brought in on a fugitive warrant.
- I come in.

898
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,110
In other words, you're here voluntarily, eh?

899
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:01,376
As far as the State's concerned,
you might still be at large.

900
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,043
I object. That is a conclusion!

901
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,053
Objection sustained.

902
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:10,353
The witness will not be asked
to speculate. You may proceed.

903
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:13,917
You came in voluntarily. Why?

904
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,759
Well, they was aimin' to swing
Pinky for somethin' he didn't do-

905
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,698
something he didn't even know
anything about- so I figured that-

906
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:25,741
So you figured you'd risk your own neck to
save the life of a poor, innocent old darky.

907
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:31,376
Your Honor, I must protest!
I must protest, Your Honor.

908
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,712
The witness isn't being asked to give
testimony. He's being led into argument.

909
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:40,448
The point is well-taken, but when
a man is on trial for his life...

910
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:44,617
the court is inclined to give
wide latitude to the defense.

911
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:48,823
Now take it easy, Major. You'll have
plenty of opportunity to make arguments.

912
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:52,458
<i>- You needn't do it through the witness.
- I stand rebuked, Your Honor.</i>

913
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:55,867
[Clears Throat] You did rob
the express office, didn't you?

914
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,371
- Reckon I did. - Mm-hmm.
What'd you do with the money?

915
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,567
- Used it huntin' the Fords.
- No other purpose?

916
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:04,544
No. It was McCoy money gotJesse
murdered, so I took McCoy money.

917
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:07,638
- Your Honor!
- Major, I want to be fair with you.

918
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,275
In fact, I've been leaning
over backwards to be fair, but-

919
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:15,255
It's all right, Your Honor. I'm finished
with the witness. McCoy can have him. I-I-

920
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:19,623
I mean- I mean, uh- I mean McCoy's
man. No, no, no, doggone it.

921
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,561
- I- I mean the prosecuting
attorney. - [Laughter]

922
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:30,138
<i>- [Gavel Banging] - I'm- I'm sorry,
Your Honor, but my tongue got twisted.</i>

923
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:38,207
- You say you didn't kill the watchman, Wilson.
- I had no reason.

924
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:41,009
- Do you always need a reason for killing?
- Don't you?

925
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:45,610
I'm not on trial. Your accomplice
could've shot Wilson, couldn't he?

926
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,053
- Yeah, could have.
- Ah.

927
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,785
But he didn't. Shot from
the outside got Wilson.

928
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:54,124
I suggest that you caused
the death of the watchman...

929
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,562
either directly or by using him
as a shield in making your escape.

930
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,760
Can't arrest you for
suggestin', but tain't so.

931
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,099
Tell me...

932
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:06,868
just where was the watchman,
Wilson, when he was hit?

933
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,966
Well, let me see. I think he-

934
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,568
Never mind what you think. Where was he?

935
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,081

When did you first meet FrankJames?

954
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:32,486
As a boy of 14 or 15,
when he first joined up.

- You mean when he joined Quantrill's guerrillas?
- Guerrillas?

- I believe they're generally known as such.

01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:14,066
that, sir, was a war for
the Southern Confederacy.

968
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,966
That isn't what they
call it where I come from.

969
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:19,837
Well, that's what this court calls
it, and let the record so show.

970
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:25,472
- You may proceed.
- State rests.

971
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,250
- Yankee.
- [Laughter]

972
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:40,790
As to the robbery itself, I need say nothing.

973
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:46,266
FrankJames admits that with an unknown
accomplice, he broke into the express office...

974
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:51,237
cracked open the strongbox
and escaped with the contents.

975
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:55,538
May I assume that even my
learned opponent will agree...

976
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:58,977
that breaking into a place and
robbing it is a punishable offense.

977
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:02,482
- Go on, talk to the jury. They have to listen to you.
- [Laughter]

978
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:11,387
But FrankJames's crime
did not end with robbery.

979
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,484
There was murder as well-

980
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:16,564
<i>foul, bloody murder...</i>

981
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:21,102
<i>murder that cries aloud for
justice against its perpetrator.</i>

982
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:25,638
FrankJames killed the watchman, Wilson...

983
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:30,609
and you, as honest men...

984
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:34,808
will see that he pays for his
crime at the end of a rope.

985
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:43,320
- It's all my fault.
- I wouldn't feel that way about it if I was you.

986
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:46,861
After all, you only did
what you thought was right.

987
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,123
When I talked to Frank in Denver...

988
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:53,167
I was thinking only of an
innocent man condemned to death.

989
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:57,329
I didn't think that perhaps I
was sending Frank to his death.

990
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:02,843
- What business was it of mine?
- Now listen, Frank's not going to his death.

991
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,504
Ten years, I figure, maybe 15.

992
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,549
If I only hadn't persuaded him.

993
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:13,417
My dear, I'm afraid you're
overcalculatin' your powers of persuasion.

994
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:17,219
You figure it was your persuasion
that made him come in, don't you, huh?

995
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,350
Well, you're mistaken.

996
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:23,261
He'd have come in and when he
did, even if he'd never met you.

997
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,356
You're saying that to make feel better.

998
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,698
No, no, no. I'm not. I'm saying
it because it's the truth.

999
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:30,999
Frank would never have let Pinky die.

1000
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:35,133
You see, I
- I know him better than you do.

1001
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:38,474
[Clears Throat] Well, it's time
to be gettin' back to court.

1002
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:44,142
Come along. You see, I think-

1003
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:48,051
Frank had only one thought:

1004
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:51,592
to avenge the cowardly
murder of his brotherJesse.

1005
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:55,185
<i>But to get on the track of the Fords
he needed money, and he had none.</i>

1006
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:59,563
- You boys know how rich you get workin' a rocky Ozark farm.
- [Laughing]

1007
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:06,870
So, in desperation, and only as a
last resort, did Frank turn to robbery.

1008
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:09,944
But let us see. [Clears Throat]

1009
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:14,209
Did he rob a bank containing the
thrifty savings of the poor? No.

1010
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:17,012
Did he rob an honest shopkeeper? No.

1011
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:19,212
He took money from the railroad...

1012
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:24,349
the railroad that had caused the
death of his mother and his brother.

1013
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:28,259
The railroad that stole your lands and
drove you from your farms, the railroad-

1014
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:31,958
- I object! - Your
objection is well-taken.

1015
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:34,627
Now let me remind you, Major, again.

1016
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,261
The St. Louis Midland is
not on trial in this court.

1017
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,431
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

1018
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:43,272
Now just try and forget what
I said about the railroad.

1019
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:46,643
And there is no evidence whatsoever
that Wilson, the night watchman...

1020
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:49,410
was killed by a bullet from a. 44.

1021
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,543
There is more than a
reasonable doubt about it...

1022
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:55,282
since even the autopsy
surgeon himself couldn't tell.

1023
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:01,118
Now this is the weapon FrankJames
had when he surrendered...

1024
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:03,220
and the weapon he has always carried.

1025
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:08,132
I know 'cause I gave it to him myself
the day he went to join Quantrill.

1026
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:12,570
You see the initials on it- F.J. -
and the date. Here. See here. Here.

1027
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:17,111
- This is very irregular, Your Honor. The evidence is in.
- Let him proceed.

1029
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:24,451
This weapon of Frank's has a very interesting
history. Yes, sir, right from the start.

1030
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:27,784
Its first bullets were fired at those dad
- blasted Kansas jayhawkers...

1031
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:29,914

You remember that, don't you, Ira? [Chuckles]

1033
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:38,265
Next, this weapon was used on the sneakin',
thievin' Yankees that burned Hickoryville.

1034
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:40,857

the blasted blue-bellies at Three Oaks...

1037
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:52,644
and cleared Clay County
forever of the pesky invaders.

1038
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,443
Now tell them how many
innocent men that gun laid low.

1039
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,882
There is no innocent blood on this weapon.

1040
01:20:57,986 --> 01:21:01,183

fired from it. This weapon-
