00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:45,157
WELL, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED

CUT HER UP FOR WOLF BAIT ?

189
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,661

00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,172
OH, SHIT.

191
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,176
IF YOU WANNA RUN, SHOW

192
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,178
RUN THE OTHER WAY !

193
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:10,182

CROSS OTTER'LL BE BACK HERE WITH

194
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,186
HE WON'T MAKE NO BONES

HOW MANY MORE WILL YOU KILL ?

198
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,728
WE HAVE ALWAYS
FOUGHT THE CROW.

199
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,231
NOT OVER SQUAW.

200
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,734
LET THE GIRL GO.
SHE MEANS NOTHING TO YOU.

201
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,237
SHE IS MY WOMAN.

202
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:09,241
YOU TREAT HER
LIKE A COYOTE BITCH.

203
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,244
IT IS NOT THE GIRL
FOR WHAT SHE IS.

204
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,249
IT IS THE LONG KNIVES,

205
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,751
THE HAIR FACES,

206
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,255
MORE AND MORE OF THEM.

207
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,759
IF THEY ARE NOT STOPPED,

208
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,763
THERE WILL BE
NO FOOD TO HUNT,

209
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:36,268
NO LANDS LEFT FOR US.

210
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:40,272
THEN WHY NOT TRY
AND MAKE PEACE WITH THEM ?
TRADE WITH THEM ?

211
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,275
THEY SPIT ON OUR LAND,

212
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,779
DESTROY OUR BUFFALO HERD,

213
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,285
TRAP OUR BEAVER.

214
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,790
HAIR FACE...

215
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,794
BIG ONE,

216
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,797
HE OPENS THE PATH
FOR OTHERS.

217
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,303
BUT HE WILL NOT HAVE HER...

218
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:15,307
OR ONE MORE THING
BELONGING TO MY PEOPLE.

219
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,313
YOU ARE A BLACKFOOT,
AIN'T YA ?

220
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,815
I COME FROM ANOTHER VILLAGE.

221
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,318
MY FATHER SOLD ME
TO HEAVY EAGLE.

222
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,321
ONE HORSE, ONE GUN.

223
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,823
SLAVE ?

224
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,327
WIFE.  THE SAME.

225
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,829
HEAVY EAGLE.

226
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,833
HE BEAT YOU SOME, HUH ?

227
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,846
WHERE'D YOU LEARN AMERICAN ?

228
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,851
FORT McKENZIE.

229
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,855
IN THE SUMMER,
WE TRADE BEAVER THERE.

230
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:08,360
- YOU LEARNED GOOD.
- I GO WITH YOU.

231
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,865
NO.  YOU GO YOUR OWN WAY.

232
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,372
I CANNOT GO BACK
TO HEAVY EAGLE.

233
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:26,378
HELL, YOU--
WELL, YOU CAN COME
TO RENDEZVOUS,

234
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,381
BUT, LOOK HERE, AFTER THAT

I PACKED A SQUAW ALONG
BEFORE.  SIX YEARS.

236
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,388
DAMNEDEST SLUT

237
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:41,393
ALWAYS WANTIN' VERMILION
AND BLUE BEADS...

238
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,396
AND MIRRORS AND SUCH.

239
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,399
BEDDIN' DOWN WITH EVERY BUCK
THAT COME HER WAY.

240
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,903
SHE WAS PRETTY, THOUGH.

241
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,419
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

242
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,421
RUNNING MOON.

243
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,926
YOU'LL CLEAR OUT

244
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,023

00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:28,059
AHHHHH !  WHEE-HAW !

I WAS WEANED

251
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:35,066
MY MAMMY WAS A WOLF,
AND MY PA WAS A GORE GRIZZLY !

252
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,569
AHHHH !

253
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:41,573
HA-HA-HA !

254
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,648

255
00:26:56,648 --> 00:27:01,653
GODDAMN IT, FONTENELLE,

A HEAP MORE THAN THREE DOLLARS.

256
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,156
THIS HERE IS PRIME FUR.
THREE DOLLARS.

257
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,159
THIS HERE'S A FIVE-DOLLAR
PLEW IF THERE EVER WAS ONE.

258
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,662
THREE DOLLARS
SEEMS FAIR ENOUGH TO--

259
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,165
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
- THREE DOLLARS.
I DON'T GO NO HIGHER.

260
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,169
YOU GOT THE BUFFALO ROBES,
I GIVE YOU $20 A PIECE FOR THEM.

261
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,173
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D
SEE THE DAY WHEN BUFFALO
BROUGHT MORE'N BEAVER.

262
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,176
YOU'RE ROBBIN' HIM BLIND,
FONTENELLE.

263
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,679
I NEVER TRADED
CUTTHROAT LIKE THAT.

264
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:33,184
TAKE IT WHILE YOU CAN, BOYS.
NEXT YEAR, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO SELL BEAVER AT ALL.

265
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:36,688
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING, THIS
MAY BE YOUR LAST RENDEZVOUS.

266
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,691

00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,197
THEY'RE NOT MAKING 'EM

269
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:49,200
SILK'S THE FASHION NOW,

270
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,212
- HELL.

271

I SEEN IT COMIN'.
BEAVER'LL SHINE

273
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,726
ACTUALLY, IT SEEMS REASONABLE
THAT IF THERE'S NO DEMAND--

274
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,729
SILK.  WHAT THE HELL

" I LONG TO HEAR YOU "

296
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,842
" AWAY "

297
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:15,346
" I'M BOUND AWAY "

298
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,850
" 'CROSS THE WIDE "

299
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,854
" MISSOURI "

300
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:26,357
MEAN AS IF HE HAD A RED-HOT
POKER UP HIS ASSHOLE.

301
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,861
WELL, LISTEN--

302
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,870
MAYBE IRON BELLY HELP YOU.

303
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,873
HE KNOWS THE BEAVER
LIKE HIS OWN CHILDREN.

304
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,876
CHRIST, I THOUGHT
HE WAS DEAD.

305
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:48,880
HE OUTLIVED SEVEN SQUAWS.
LAST WINTER, HE HAD A SON.

306
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,382
SAY, WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT STUFF ?

307
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,385
KINNIKINNICK.
TASTES LIKE
"BUFFALER" SHIT.

308
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,388

00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,781
YOU CAN'T HURT ME !
THAT'S A GOOD ONE !

310
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:10,285
I DON'T CARE

IRON BELLY ?

311
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,795
IRON BELLY,

00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,798
HOW OLD IS HE ?

313
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,302
A HUNDRED AND TEN.

314
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,805
LOOK AT THAT.

315
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,308

00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,832
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

322
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,841
HE WHO RUNS WITH THE WIND,
SPEAK YOUR HEART.

323
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,347

326
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:23,858
VERMILION AND BEADS
AND SCALPIN' KNIVES AND SUCH
ARE MIGHTY DEAR THESE DAYS.

327
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:32,867
SOME SAY FUR'S DOWN FOR GOOD,
BEAVER WON'T NEVER SHINE AGAIN.

328
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,370

331
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,383
IN THE MOUNTAINS
OF THE RIVER OF WIND...

332
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,885
THERE IS A VALLEY.

333
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,887
THE WIND RIVER RANGE ?

334
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,890
THE LAND OF OUR ENEMIES,
THE BLACKFEET.

335
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,395
THEIR HEARTS ARE BAD,
THEIR EYES RED WITH BLOOD.

336
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,898
AND IT'S CHOCK-FULL
OF BEAVER, AIN'T IT ?

337
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,900
AIN'T IT ?
NO.

338
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,902
IT HAS TO BE.

339
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,905
THE BLACKFEET BEEN KEEPIN'
EVERYBODY OUT OF THERE
FOR YEARS.

340
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:14,409
MUST BE SO FULL OF BEAVER,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRAP 'EM.
JUST CLUB 'EM IN THE BACK.

IRON BELLY--

342
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,414

00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,417

00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,919
FOR THERE ARE BEAVER THERE.

345
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,422

00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,424
WELL, YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.

362
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:56,010
- I HAVE NO HOME.

00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,013

YOU DON'T WANNA GET HIM
RILED, FROGGY.  HE MIGHT

00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,647

00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,700
YOU AIN'T GONNA CATCH NOTHIN'

391
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,202
AH, WE'D BEST MOVE ON
IN THE MORNIN'.

392
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,705
THIS SURE LORD
AIN'T THE PLACE.

393
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:15,209
YES, SIR, WHOLE VALLEY
SWARMIN' WITH BEAVER.

394
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,714
FIGHTIN' TO GET INTO YOUR TRAP.
"TAKE ME, TAKE ME," THEY SAY.
DAMN IT, HENRY !

395
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:23,217
PLACE LIKE THAT AIN'T
GONNA BE EASY TO FIND.
IT STANDS TO REASON.

396
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,221
SEE ANY SIGN ?

397
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,724
SURE AS SHIT
AIN'T NO SIGN OF BEAVER.

398
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,226
I DON'T MEAN
THE BEAVER SIGN.

399
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:35,730
OH, MAYBE.  I CAN SMELL
BLACKFOOT A MILE OFF.

400
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,732
NO OFFENSE, RUNNING MOON.

401
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,234
THIS CHILD
SMELLS BLACKFOOT TOO.

402
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,237
NOTHIN' PARTICULAR,
JUST A FEELIN'.

403
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,240
MY PEOPLE COME HERE

404
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,244
YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE ?
MANY TIMES.

405
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,749
WHY IN THE HELL
DIDN'T YOU SAY SO ?
YOU DID NOT ASK.

406
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,752
YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS VALLEY

407
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,755
MY PEOPLE KEPT IT A SECRET
FROM THE OTHER TRIBES.

408
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,760
THEY SAY IT WAS RICH IN FUR,
THICK AND SLEEK.

409
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,263
WHERE IN THE HELL IS IT ?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

410
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,266
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ?

411

HENRY, SHE SAYS
SHE DON'T KNOW.

412
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,275
IT WAS ONLY A LEGEND.

413
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,858
WHERE YOU BEEN ?

414
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,360

00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,373
YOU LOOK ALL TUCKERED OUT, BILL.
I THINK YOU'RE GETTIN' TOO OLD
FOR THE MOUNTAINS.

418
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,876
LOSIN' YOUR WIND.

419
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,879
COULD BE, HENRY.
AHHHH.

420
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,881

421
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,413
AAAAH !

00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,945
THEY SNUCK UP ON ME,
GODDAMN IT.

428
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,448
THAT'S WHAT INJUNS

429
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,453
HEAVY EAGLE.

430
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,455

431
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,461
YOU RECKON HE SAW YOU ?

432
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,477

433
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,980
MUST BE HALFWAY

434
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,543
RUNNING MOON ?

435
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,551
RUNNING--

436
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,059
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU'D GONE UNDER.

437
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:09,063
HEAVY EAGLE WILL HUNT US.
HIS BLOOD BURNS.  HE WILL--

438
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,065
WHERE'S FRAPP ?

439
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:54,728
HEY, WHERE'S MY SHIRT ?

440
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,733
DAMN IT.  RUNNING MOON,
WHERE'S MY SHIRT ?

441
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,736

442
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,241
DAMN THING'S
PLUMB WORE OUT, ANYWAYS.

443
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,747
WELL, WHAT'S--

00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,753
WELL, NOW, THAT--

00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,760
THAT SHINES.  THAT--

446
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,267
THAT TRULY SHINES.

447
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,887
THE WOMAN IS OF OUR NATION.
SHE'S MINE.

448
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,391
GO ON, GET !
I STAY WITH YOU.

449
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,394
YOU'LL GO UNDER IF YOU DO.
I STAY !

450
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,955
RUNNING MOON !

451
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,960
RUNNING--

452
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,984
WHERE IS RUNNING MOON ?

453
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,987
IS THE LONG KNIFE
A SWIFT RUNNER ?

454
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,989
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, RUN ?

455
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,992
IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE.

456
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,496
THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS
ARE LIKE SQUAWS.

457
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,999
THE WHITE MAN'S MEDICINE
MAKES US WEAK.

458
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,007
WE DIE LIKE FLIES
AT FORT McKENZIE.

459
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,009
YOU MEAN THE POX ?

460
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:40,013
WE TRADE AT THE FORT,
AND OUR FACES ROT AND FALL OFF.

461
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,016
EVEN THE WOLVES
WILL NOT TOUCH US.

462
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:59,032
THIS IS STRANGE,
EVIL MEDICINE.

463
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:05,038
AND WE CAN DO NOTHING
ABOUT IT.

464
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:08,041
BUT YOU AND I ARE THE SAME.

465
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,046
A FEW PASSING SUNS
WILL SEE US NO MORE.

466
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:18,051
OUR BONES WILL BLEACH IN THE SUN
WITH THE BONES OF THE BUFFALO.

467
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:20,554
BUT WE SHALL BE REMEMBERED.

468
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,560
TOMORROW YOU'LL SEE
YOUR LAST SUNRISE.

469
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,062
WHERE IS RUNNING MOON ?

470
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,068
SHE IS DEAD.

471
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,116
RUN.

472
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,319
HE CANNOT BE FOUND.

473
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,032
YOU HUNT FOR HIM STILL ?

474
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,536
NO MAN CAN LIVE
IN THAT WATER.

475
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,039
NOT THE GROS VENTRE.
HE IS DEAD.

476
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,041
I SURVIVED.

477
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,546
WHEN HIS SCALP...

478
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,048
HANGS FROM MY LODGE,

479
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,051
WHEN HIS HEAD
SITS ON MY SPEAR,

480
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,555
THEN HE WILL BE DEAD.

481
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,058
IT WILL BE WINTER SOON.

482
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,562
RUNNING MOON, GO.
BRING US WOOD.

483
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,574
WE HAVE LITTLE TO EAT.

484
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,076
WE MUST MOVE
THE VILLAGE.

485
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:32,582
WHEN THE SNOW FALL,
IT WILL HIDE HIS TRACKS.
WE NEED NO TRACKS.

486
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,585
WE WILL MOVE THE VILLAGE
BEFORE THE SNOW COME.

487
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,089
THEN WE WILL HUNT.

488
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,096
THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE
HE CAN SURVIVE THE WINTER--

489
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,851
IN THE VILLAGE OF IRON BELLY,
THE CROW.

490
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,110
GET !

491
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,114
GO ON !

492
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,737
YOU BLACK YOUR FACE
FOR A HUNT ?
FOR THIS HUNT.

493
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,339
CHRIST !

494
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,426
I AM DYING.

495
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,929
THERE IS NO MORE.

496
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,931
I AM HUNGRY TOO.

497
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,935
I AM MEDICINE WOLF.

498
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,939
I WILL NOT DIE LIKE A SLAVE.

499
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,941
MEDICINE WOLF !

500
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:36,445
YOU KNOW BILL TYLER ?
HE SPOKE OF YOU.

501
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,953
BILL TYLER IS MY FRIEND.
WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM ?

502
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,956
WAS HE NOT
IN YOUR VILLAGE ?
NO.

503
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,959
HE ESCAPED FROM HEAVY EAGLE
BEFORE THE WINTER.

504
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,962
MAYBE HE GO UNDER.

505
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,464
NO.

506
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,466
I KNOW THAT HE'S ALIVE.

507
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,970
MAYBE HE GO NORTH.

508
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,472
YELLOWSTONE COUNTRY.

509
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,976
MANY TRAPPERS WINTER
ON THE MADISON RIVER.

510
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,480
I AM TYLER'S WOMAN.

511
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,984
I WILL BRING YOU MORE.

512
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,526
WHAT THE HELL TOOK YOU,
TYLER ?

513
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:00,029
HENRY ?

514
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,531
SIT YOUR ASS DOWN
AND HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE.

515
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:13,042
OH.

516
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,046
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

517
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,549
THAT'S MIGHTY GOOD.

518
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,552
LOOK HERE, HENRY.

519
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,554
IF I'D KNOWN THAT...

520
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,557
YOU WAS LAYING THERE SCALPED--

521
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,559
IF I'D KNOWED
YOU WEREN'T DEAD,

522
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,062
I NEVER WOULD'VE LEFT YOU,
NOT FOR NOTHING.

523
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:36,065
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL
ME THAT, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
I KNOW THAT.

524
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,568
WELL, I WAS LAYING THERE.

525
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:43,072
COME TO
ALL BY MY LONESOME.

526
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,075
THEM BLACKFEET WAS SO BUSY
TAKING OFF AFTER YOU,

527
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:49,578
THEY EVEN FORGOT
TO TAKE MY RIFLE.

528
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,081
I GOT BACK TO CAMP,
I SEEN YOU WAS GONE.

529
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,583
JUST WALKED
THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

530
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,587
TAKES A LOT MORE
THAN A SCALPIN' KNIFE
TO PUT THIS CHILD UNDER.

531
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,589
IT SURE MUST'VE
SMARTED SOME, THOUGH.

532
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,591
WELL, I GUESS.

533
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,597
ISN'T THAT THE SHITS ?

534
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,601
I'LL TELL YA,
IT FELT MIGHTY QUEERSOME.

535
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,106
MMM.  HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL
IS RUNNING MOON ?

536
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,610
SHE'S GONE UNDER, HENRY.

537
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,614
AND HEAVY EAGLE
STOVE HER HEAD IN.

538
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,117
OH, SHIT.

539
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,121
GODDAMN !

540
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,123
SHE WAS SOME PUMPKIN TOO.

541
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,125
WELL--

542
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,128
SAY, YOU EVER FIND
THAT VALLEY ?

543
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,630
THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS SWARMIN'
WITH THE BEAVERS ?

544
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,633
WHERE THEY RUN UP ON THE BANKS
AND FIGHT ONE ANOTHER
TO GET IN YOUR TRAP ?

545
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,139
HOLLERIN',
"TAKE ME, BILL TYLER !
TAKE ME !"

546
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,644
BEAVER MANY
AS STARS IN THE SKY.

547
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,168
THERE'S AN OLD HORSE OUTSIDE.
WHAT ?

548
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,171
THERE'S AN OLD HORSE OUTSIDE.
YOU ARE ONLY A SLAVE.

549
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,173
THEY WILL NOT GO AFTER YOU.

550
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,187
FIND TYLER.
TELL HIM I WAIT.

551
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,690
GO.

552
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:07,716
BEFORE I GOT THERE,
HE HAD BURNED IT OUT.

553
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,220
KILLED THE OLD MAN
AND THE SQUAWS
AND THE YOUNG 'UNS TOO.

554
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:15,224
LEFT ME BETWEEN
A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.

555
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,227
ALL I COULD DO WAS TRY
FOR THE FLATHEAD COUNTRIES,

556
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,229
SEE IF THEY'D TAKE ME IN.

557
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,232
I WORKED ACROSS
THE YELLOWSTONE.

558
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:28,737
YEAH, YOU GOT THE HAIR
OF THE BEAR ON YOU, TYLER,
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.

559
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,740
I'VE SEEN THE BACK DOOR
TO HELL, HENRY.

560
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,744
YEAH, LOOK THERE.
THERE SHE IS.

561
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,249
YOU LITTLE RASCAL.
GO ON, GET.

562
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,751
I TRADED
A GOOD PINTO FOR HER.

563
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,753
OF COURSE, I STOLE HIM
FROM HER PAPPY FIRST.

564
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,755
THE OLD SON OF A BITCH
HAS GOT SO GODDAMN MANY HORSES,

565
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:50,259
HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIS OWN
WHEN I BRUNG HIM BACK.

566
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,761
SHE DON'T KNOW A DAMN WORD
OF ENGLISH, BUT SHE CAN BE
MIGHTY COMFORTING...

567
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,763
ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS ONE.

568
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,266
I DO MISS MY MULES, THOUGH.

569
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:02,271
HEY, TYLER.
WHERE'S YOUR SQUAW ?

570
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,777
OH, I KNOW.
YOU GET TOO OLD, HUH ?

571
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,284
GROS VENTRE BITCH.
BIG MELONS.

572
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:18,287
WHAT'D YOU PAY FOR HER ?
HUH ?

573
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,290
I BET SHE HUMP YOU
GOOD, HUH ?

574
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,792
SHUT UP,
SHIT FOR BRAINS.

575
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,794
I LIKE RED MEAT, HUH ?

576
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:29,798
I SAID SHUT UP,
YOU GODDAMN
PORK-EATIN' FROG TURD !

577
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,308
I CAN'T STAND
THAT NASTY-TALKIN' BASTARD.

578
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,815
YOU KNOW, IT'S
GODDAMN LONESOME OUT HERE.

579
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,818
IT TOOK YOU
20 YEARS TO FIGURE
THAT ONE OUT, HUH ?

580
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,322
I'M GETTIN' LONG
IN THE TOOTH FOR THIS.

581
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,341
WELL, THAT AIN'T AN ELK.

582
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,343
I RECKON NOT.

583
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,852
NO PRESENTS NOW, TYLER,
YA HEAR ?

584
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,854
NO DAMN MEAT, EITHER.

585
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:37,366
WATCH YOURSELF, BILL,
GODDAMN IT.
HE'S LIABLE TO HAVE THE POX.

586
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,368
HE AIN'T GOT THE POX.

587
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,871
THE WHOLE TRIBE CAUGHT IT
OVER AT FORT UNION
LAST FALL, GODDAMN IT !

588
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,873
WHAT THE HELL--

589
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:48,877
I AM MEDICINE WOLF.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, DAMN IT.
WHAT HAPPENED ?

590
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,880
MEDICINE WOLF HUNTING.

591
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,884
THEY TAKE PRISONER.
ALL DIE.

592
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,888
H-H-HUNGRY.
YEAH.

593
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,391
YOU'LL EAT JUST AS SOON AS
WE GET YOU BACK TO CAMP.

594
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,393
HOW'D YOU GET AWAY ?

595
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,896
RUNNING MOON.

596
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,900
WHAT ?
RUNNING MOON.

597
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,905
SHE HELPED MEDICINE WOLF.
GIVE HORSE.

598
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,907
SHE SAYS--
SHE'S ALIVE ?

599
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:22,411
SHE-- SHE W--
SHE WAITS.

600
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,416
WHAT'D HE SAY ?

601
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,919
WHAT DID HE SAY ?

602
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,922
HE SAYS HE'S HUNGRY.

603
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,924
GOD.
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.

604
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,927
TELL HIM WE AIN'T GOT
NO MEAT TO SPARE.

605
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,931
WE CAN'T GO FEEDIN'
EVERY STARVIN'-ASS INDIAN
COME WANDERIN' INTO CA--

606
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,936
OH, JESUS.

607
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,946
I DON'T RECKON
HE'LL EAT MUCH, HENRY.

608
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,452
YOU FELLAS EVER FIND
THAT VALLEY
YOU WAS HUNTIN' ?

609
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,954
THE ONE IRON BELLY
TOLD YOU ABOUT ?

610
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,956
THERE AIN'T NO VALLEY,
JOE.

611
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:12,461
I HEAR IRON BELLY
TELL YOU DIFFERENT, HUH ?
IRON BELLY'S AN OLD MAN.

612
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,464
HE WAS JUST YARNIN' ME.
IT DIDN'T MAKE
NO NEVER MIND TO HIM.

613
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,467
MAYBE-- MAYBE
HE TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

614
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,970
WHICH WAY MIGHT YOU
BE HEADIN' COME BREAKUP ?
NORTH.

615
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,974
DROP ON OVER
KICKIN' HORSE PASS,
TRAP THE WOLF.

616
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,477
MAYBE THE PEACE RIVER.

617
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,479
IT'S BRITISH TERRITORY.

618
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,983
HUDSON'S BAY AIN'T GONNA BE
TOO HAPPY TO HEAR YOU, UH,
TRAPPIN' THEIR GROUND.

619
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:36,985
IF THE BLACKFEET
COULDN'T LIFT MY HAIR,

620
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,987
I RECKON I CAN STAY AHEAD
OF THE BRITISHERS.

621
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,992
COYOTE ?

622
01:17:54,953 --> 01:17:58,457
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
WE SAW THE TETONS ?

623
01:17:58,457 --> 01:18:01,960
STANDING TALL AND WHITE
AS A WOMAN'S BREAST.

624
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,962
THE WHOLE COUNTRY SO NEW,
IT MADE A MAN THINK...

625
01:18:04,463 --> 01:18:07,966
HE WAS THE FIRST ONE
TO SET FOOT ON IT.

626
01:18:07,966 --> 01:18:11,470
YOU COULD WALK FOR A YEAR
IN ANY DIRECTION
WITH JUST YOUR RIFLE.

627
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,973
LIVE GOOD AND EASY.
NEVER SAY "SIR" TO NOBODY.

628
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:24,483
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT ?

629
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:26,485
I MEAN, RUNNING MOON
AIN'T DEAD, IS SHE ?

630
01:18:26,485 --> 01:18:28,987
WELL, NO MORE
THAN I AM.

631
01:18:28,987 --> 01:18:32,491
SO I DON'T RECKON YOU'RE HEADIN'
FOR NO PEACE RIVER, ARE YA ?

632
01:18:36,495 --> 01:18:39,498
NO, SHE AIN'T DEAD.

633
01:18:39,498 --> 01:18:41,500
THAT BASTARD HEAVY EAGLE
LIED TO ME.

634
01:18:44,002 --> 01:18:46,505
- THERE AIN'T NO VALLEY, HENRY.
- I WASN'T THINKIN' ABOUT THAT.

635
01:18:46,505 --> 01:18:49,007
THERE AIN'T NO BEAVER UP THERE,
GODDAMN IT !

636
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:51,009
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP...

637
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:53,011
STEALIN' RUNNING MOON BACK,
THAT'S ALL.

638
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:55,514
I DON'T NEED NO HELP.

639
01:18:58,517 --> 01:19:00,519
I DON'T RECKON
I NEED ANY HELP.

640
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:05,023
HEAVY EAGLE
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

641
01:19:05,023 --> 01:19:07,025
MAYBE.

642
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:11,029
WELL, I WAS ONLY TRYIN'
TO HELP YOU,
YOU CONTRARY OLD FART.

643
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:14,533
I KNOW IT.

644
01:19:16,034 --> 01:19:19,538
MMM.
GOOD LUCK TO YA.

645
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,042
GOOD LUCK TO YOU TOO,
HENRY.

646
01:20:18,597 --> 01:20:21,099
WELL, SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA LOOK AFTER YOU.

647
01:20:22,601 --> 01:20:25,103
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SQUAW ?

648
01:20:25,103 --> 01:20:28,106
AH, I TRADED HER BACK
TO HER PAPPY FOR THE PINTO.

649
01:20:30,108 --> 01:20:33,111
YOU AIN'T RIDIN' HIM.
THE OLD FART
STOLE HIM BACK AGAIN.

650
01:20:33,612 --> 01:20:35,113
GODDAMN THIEVIN' REDSKIN.

651
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:49,127
WHOA.

652
01:20:56,635 --> 01:20:58,637
TYLER.

653
01:21:01,139 --> 01:21:03,642
DIDN'T FIGURE ON
MEETIN' YOU TWO UP HERE.

654
01:21:03,642 --> 01:21:05,644
WIND RIVER'S A LONG WAYS
FROM KICKIN' HORSE PASS.

655
01:21:05,644 --> 01:21:08,146
I CHANGED MY MIND.

656
01:21:09,648 --> 01:21:11,650
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

657
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:20,659
YOU'RE FREE TRAPPERS.
YOU HUNT WHERE YOU WANT.

658
01:21:20,659 --> 01:21:22,661
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
THERE AIN'T NO VALLEY UP HERE,

659
01:21:22,661 --> 01:21:24,663
AND THERE AIN'T NO BEAVER.

660
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:27,666
NO ?
SO WHY YOU HERE, THEN ?

661
01:21:38,677 --> 01:21:41,680
YOU BOYS ARE ON YOUR OWN HOOK.
STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

662
01:21:47,686 --> 01:21:49,688
WHY ?

663
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:56,695
YOU FORSAKE YOUR PEOPLE.

664
01:21:58,697 --> 01:22:00,699
I HAVE NO PEOPLE.

665
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,202
IAMTHE PEOPLE.

666
01:22:08,206 --> 01:22:10,709
THEY WILL NOT DIE
WHILE I LIVE.

667
01:22:18,216 --> 01:22:20,719
YOU CANNOT LEAVE,
RUNNING MOON.

668
01:22:25,223 --> 01:22:27,225
HE WILL COME...

669
01:22:29,227 --> 01:22:31,229
AS I DID.

670
01:22:34,232 --> 01:22:36,234
AND HE WILL DIE.

671
01:22:58,757 --> 01:23:00,759
THAT WASN'T HERE
THIS MORNIN'.

672
01:23:00,759 --> 01:23:02,761
TWO, THREE HOURS OLD.

673
01:23:02,761 --> 01:23:05,764
SIX, SEVEN OF 'EM.
WAR PARTY.

674
01:23:05,764 --> 01:23:07,766
DON'T TRY TO TEACH ME
MY BUSINESS, HENRY.

675
01:23:07,766 --> 01:23:09,768
TRAVELIN' TOO FAST
FOR HUNTERS.

676
01:23:09,768 --> 01:23:12,270
MAYBE THEY WAS IN A HURRY.

677
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:15,273
WHERE IN THE HELL
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOIN' ?
CHURCH SOCIAL ?

678
01:23:15,273 --> 01:23:19,277
YOU BEST GET BACK ON TO CAMP,
CHECK UP ON THEM TWO
CHEE-CHOPPERS.

679
01:23:19,277 --> 01:23:21,279
I'LL SCOUT AROUND SOME.

680
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,303
THAT CRAP WALKER
DON'T COME IN BY NOW,
HE DON'T COME IN.

681
01:23:46,805 --> 01:23:48,807
QUIT WORRYING.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT LONGER YOURSELF.

682
01:23:54,312 --> 01:23:57,816
I THINK YOU ONE GODDAMN INJUN.

683
01:23:57,816 --> 01:23:59,818
IF I WAS AN INJUN,
YOU'D BE DEAD.

684
01:24:03,822 --> 01:24:06,324
I THOUGHT YOU WAS
HUNTIN' WITH WALKER.
OUI.

685
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:13,832
YOU BURY HIM.

686
01:24:13,832 --> 01:24:17,335
BULLSHIT !
YOU'LL KILL US ALL, TYLER !

687
01:24:19,838 --> 01:24:21,840
AND YOU'LL TAKE
ALL THE BEAVER
FOR YOURSELF !

688
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:26,344
MAYBE YOU KILL MY FRIEND.
THEN MAYBE YOU KILL ME, HUH ?

689
01:24:26,344 --> 01:24:29,347
THAT AIN'T A BAD IDEA,
FROG ASS.

690
01:24:32,851 --> 01:24:35,854
I SEEN THE VILLAGE, HENRY.
I GOT CLOSE ENOUGH
TO SPIT ON IT.

691
01:24:35,854 --> 01:24:37,856
IS RUNNING MOON
UP THERE ?

692
01:24:37,856 --> 01:24:40,859
IT'S NEAR EMPTY.
THE BRAVES ARE OUT HUNTIN' US.

693
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:43,862
ONLY A BUNCH OF OLD MEN
AND BOYS GUARDIN' IT.
IS RUNNING MOON UP THERE ?

694
01:24:43,862 --> 01:24:46,865
SURE, SHE'S THERE.
WELL ?

695
01:24:46,865 --> 01:24:49,868
FIGURED HOW TO GET HER
OUT OF THERE ?
WE WALK IN AND TAKE HER.

696
01:24:49,868 --> 01:24:52,871
TAKE HER ?
CHRIST'S SAKES, TYLER.
"TAKE HER."

697
01:24:52,871 --> 01:24:55,373
THE VILLAGE IS DOWN
AT THE END OF THAT VALLEY.

698
01:24:55,373 --> 01:24:58,877
WE RIDE INTO THE VALLEY
FROM THE EAST,
THEN WE WORK UP A SIDE CANYON.

699
01:24:58,877 --> 01:25:01,379
I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING US
ALL THE TIME, SO I'M CERTAIN
THEY'LL GO AFTER US.

700
01:25:01,379 --> 01:25:04,382
GO AFTER US ?  YOU TETCHED ?
JESUS CHRIST !

701
01:25:04,883 --> 01:25:08,386
ONCE WE DRAW OFF
HEAVY EAGLE AND HIS BOYS,
WE PUT THE SNEAK ON 'EM.

702
01:25:08,386 --> 01:25:10,388
WE WORK PAST 'EM
IN THE THICK COUNTRY...

703
01:25:10,388 --> 01:25:12,390
AND WALK INTO THAT VILLAGE
AS SLICK AS YOU PLEASE.

704
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:14,392
WHO IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE MESSIN' WITH ?

705
01:25:14,893 --> 01:25:16,895
THEM BOYS KILL FOR A LIVIN',
YOU KNOW.
NO.

706
01:25:16,895 --> 01:25:20,899
BY THE TIME THEY GET WIND
OF WHERE WE'RE AT,
WE'LL BE LONG GONE.

707
01:25:23,902 --> 01:25:26,404
HEY, WAKE UP,
YOU OLD FART.

708
01:25:32,911 --> 01:25:35,413
LA BONT LIT OUT ON US,
DID HE ?

709
01:25:35,413 --> 01:25:38,416
TOOK THE PACK STOCK
WITH HIM TOO.
ASSHOLE.

710
01:25:40,919 --> 01:25:43,922
WELL, YOU WAS GUARDIN'
THE HORSES.

711
01:25:43,922 --> 01:25:46,925
IT WAS YOUR TURN,

01:25:46,925 --> 01:25:48,927

YOU OLD BASTARD !

713
01:25:49,427 --> 01:25:51,429
WELL, IT'S NEVER YOUR TURN
TO GUARD THE GODDAMN HORSES !

714
01:25:51,429 --> 01:25:53,431
EVERY GODDAMN TIME
WE LOSE THE HORSES,
OH, SHUT UP !

715
01:25:53,431 --> 01:25:55,433
IT'S MY TURN TO GUARD 'EM,
AIN'T IT ?

716
01:25:57,936 --> 01:26:00,738
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME

718
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:06,744
YOU WAS GUARDIN' THE STOCK.
I WAS GUARDIN' THE STOCK ?

719
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:09,747
BULLSHIT,
I WAS GUARDIN' THE STOCK !

720
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:13,251
WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME
DOWN ON SIDSKIDEE WHEN
THE SIOUX JUMPED YOUR ASS ?

721
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:17,755
YOU WAS--

723
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,760
ASSHOLE !

724
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,765
- DAMN.  THEY NEARLY GOT ME.

725
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:30,268
WHAT YOU THINK ?
THE GODDAMN INDIANS GET 'EM.

726
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,770
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU COME BACK HERE FOR,

727
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:36,774
YOU GODDAMN, IGNORANT,
FOREIGN GODDAMN SHITHEAD FROG ?

728
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:40,278
WHOA !

729
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:49,787
WE SURE PUT
THE SNEAK ON THEM.

730
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:51,789
YES, SIR.
SURE FOOLED 'EM.

731
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:59,297
"AIN'T NOBODY GUARDIN'
THIS VILLAGE."

732
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:04,252
YES, SIREE.

733
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,754
ALL WE GOT TO DO IS...

734
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:08,756
GIVE 'EM THE SLIP
IN THE THICK COUNTRY...

735
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:12,260
AND THEN WHIP RIGHT UP THERE
AND RESCUE
GOOD OLD RUNNING MOON...

736
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,262
SLICK AS YOU PLEASE.

737
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:17,265
YOU GOT ANY IDEAS ?
WELL,

738
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,267
MAYBE IF WE CAN
HOLD 'EM OFF TILL DARK.

739
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:25,273
GET OUR ASSES OUT OF HERE
AND UP TO THAT VILLAGE
BEFORE SUNUP.

740
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:28,276
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HEAVY EAGLE
AIN'T GONNA TRY TO
BUTCHER US UNTIL DAYBREAK.

741
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:31,279
BY THEN, WE COULD BE
HALFWAY TO YELLOWSTONE.

742
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:33,781
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE WON'T BUTCHER US
AT NIGHT ?

743
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:36,784
BLACKFEET DON'T FIGHT AT NIGHT.
YOU KNOW THAT.

744
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:41,789
HENRY, YOU AIN'T GOT
THE BRAINS GOD GIVE GEESE.

745
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:57,305
HEY, WHAT YOU THINK ?
MAYBE WE MAKE DEAL ?

746
01:27:57,805 --> 01:27:59,807
WE GIVE THEM HORSES,
THEY LET US GO, NO ?

747
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:06,314
I'VE BEEN DOWN
THAT TRAIL BEFORE.

748
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,316
HE WANTS PARLEY.
WE GIVE IT TO HIM, NO ?

749
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,819
YOU SUIT YOURSELF.
I GOT NOTHIN' TO SAY TO HIM.

750
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:17,825
HE'S WAY OUT OF RANGE.
I KNOW IT.
I JUST DON'T LIKE HIM.

751
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:11,379
DON'T MISS.
I NEVER MISS.

752
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:29,897
SAY, HENRY,

753
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:32,900
AIN'T NO NEED
FOR YOU TO FIGHT YOUR WAY
INTO THAT VILLAGE.

754
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:34,902
WE-WE COULD JOIN UP AFTER--

755
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:36,904
I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME
THE 'RAPAHOS...

756
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:39,874
CHASED ME UP A CANYON
OVER IN THE BIG LOST ?

757
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,876
NO, BUT I RECKON
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.

758
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:44,879
WELL, IT WAS OVER
ON THE HORSE PRAIRIE.

759
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,382
THIS BAND OF 'RAPAHOS
HAD BEEN CHASING ME THREE DAYS.

760
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:51,386
SO I SEEN THIS CANYON.
I FIGURED, WELL, I'LL WHIP
IN THERE, THEN I'LL SLIP OUT.

761
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:54,389
THE TROUBLE WAS THAT
THERE WAS A WAY IN BUT
THERE WASN'T NO WAY OUT AT ALL.

762
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,392
NOTHIN' BUT CLIFFS
HALF A MILE HIGH
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

763
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,394
A WHOLE DAMN TRIBE
OF BLACKFOOT DOWN THERE...

764
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:02,397
JUST MADDER THAN
TURPENTINE WILDCATS.

765
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,733
SO I HOLED UP
BEHIND SOME ROCKS,
BUT THAT DIDN'T DO NO GOOD...

766
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,735
BECAUSE THEY JUST
KEPT ON A-COMIN'.

767
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:11,239
ENTIRE SIOUX NATION.

768
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:14,242

THEY WAS 'RAPAHO.

769
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,244

01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,297
YOU'RE GETTIN' TOO OLD

774
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,299

776
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:30,318

777
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,321
I TOLD YOU YOU NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO LOOK AFTER YA.

778
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:39,827
YOU JUST LAY QUIET THERE
FOR A SPELL, AND
I'LL HAVE YA OUT OF HERE.

779
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,829
OH, BULLSHIT.

780
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,831
I'M GOIN' UNDER, AIN'T I ?

781
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,836

WELL, WE TRAPPED A HEAP,

783
01:31:56,844 --> 01:31:59,347

01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:01,849
AND BY GOD,
WE REACHED OUT AND TOOK IT.

01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,359
GET THE HELL UP
IN THE HIGH COUNTRY.

788
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,361
INJUNS DON'T LIKE IT UP THERE.

789
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:19,367
YOU CAN HAVE MY PACK MULE.
YOU AIN'T GOT NO PACK MULE.

790
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,369
LOOK, DON'T TALK SO DAMN MUCH.

791
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:26,374
OH, CHRIST'S SAKES.
I'M BLEEDIN' TO DEATH.
I'M GONNA TALK ALL I DAMN WANT.

792
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,876

01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:52,900
A WHOLE VALLEY
FULL OF PRIME BEAVER.

799
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:57,905
A MAN COULD LIVE EASY
THE REST OF HIS DAYS.

800
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:01,409
WAS THEY LIKE STARS
IN THE SKY ?

801
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:03,411
YEAH.

804
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:17,925
WHEN WE WAS FREE TRAPPERS.

805
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,433
