1
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,688
Quick, Merrick.

2
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,010
They are lynching
a rustler.

3
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,537
Do not eat?
The beans are delicious.

4
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,016
Dan ...

5
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,418
Drop that whip!

6
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,656
Who are you?

7
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,653
My name is Merrick.

8
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,938
I'm sheriff
U.S..

9
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,414
He's new here, right?

10
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,374
The law no.

11
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,130
We are the law.

12
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,018
This man is a murderer.

13
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,979
He killed my son.

14
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,332
It hangs from a rope
government.

15
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,491
Colguémosle now
What's the difference?

16
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,732
We will take you to Santa Loma,
the court will decide.

17
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,210
Come on!

18
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,890
Shoot, Billy.

19
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,649
Before you die.

20
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,214
Shoot.

21
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,053
This is absurd, Len.

22
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,058
You're going to die by a murderer?

23
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,780
Take him to Santa Loma.

24
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,529
Come on!

25
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,055
Shoot!

26
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,771
You and Lou take you
the prisoner.

27
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,737
I'll catch up.

28
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,372
Sorry, Roden.
I had to do.

29
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,293
Hang the murderer
and the sheriff.

30
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,212
Reflect,
It is a federal sheriff.

31
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,176
Let's follow him!

32
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,137
Let your father fix it.

33
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,689
Do not risk everything
for revenge.

34
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,849
I lost a son.

35
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,499
Do not want to lose my ranch.

36
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,498
Who is coming?

37
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,255
You know what will happen
in Washington when they learn?

38
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,536
Who cares
one horse thief!

39
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,418
It will just be one more incident.

40
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,650
One more incident.

41
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,730
And maybe the last.

42
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,091
A rustlers were hung.

43
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,616
Well, I'm waiting.

44
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,968
Forget it.

45
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,732
We know how you feel.

46
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,219
Let us help you ...

47
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,859
Bury Ed ...

48
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,052
Out of here!

49
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,976
All of you!

50
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,819
Where are you going?

51
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,334
A bury Ed

52
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,060
We'll bury him at home.
The ranch.

53
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,016
I'll help you bring it.

54
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,056
I'll take one.

55
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,778
Why I can not go?

56
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,736
He's my brother.

57
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,375
It was my son.

58
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,976
So do I.

59
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,452
See you at the ranch.

60
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,176
Gather all men.

61
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,098
No one follows us.
We can rest.

62
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,168
It's new, is not it, sheriff?

63
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,136
Why?

64
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,008
You do not know
the Roden family.

65
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,057
They never rest, ...

66
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,539
To me ... hanging on a rope.

67
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,133
They may not be the law.

68
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,934
I did not kill him, though I suppose
I lose time.

69
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,857
You're wasting my time too.

70
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:47,603
The jury will decide whether
innocent or guilty. Not.

71
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,889
Anyway, ...

72
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,255
Thanks for everything ... Dick.

73
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,816
No tricks.

74
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,050
Billy,
rides in front with him.

75
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,293
The horses are thirsty
and soon darkened.

76
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,735
We should find a place
sleeping.

77
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,859
Guys, if you want to spend
night indoors, ...

78
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,978
My house is ... road,
two hours from here.

79
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,059
I would not mind sleeping
indoors.

80
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,186
Accept the offer.

81
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:30,688
<i> When I left my home
in this single and alone ... </ i></i>

82
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,613
<i> for fame ...
and fortune ... </ i></i>

83
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,225
I can not believe I'm
singing on the way to my own judgment.

84
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:41,427
<i> hear my call
small cottage on the plain ... </ i></i>

85
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,691
You are going to judge
the wrong crime.

86
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,334
Stop!

87
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,248
That's where they say killed
young Roden.

88
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,570
Where is your home?

89
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,536
West.

90
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,931
Back
of those peaks.

91
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,210
Go ahead, Billy.

92
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,291
I catch at home.

93
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,178
Come on, Daddy, let's go.

94
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,417
It has saved a murderer,
What do you want now?

95
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,779
Sorry about your son.

96
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,808
At the ranch, my son was worth
by five men.

97
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,376
She was everything to me.

98
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,655
He was the best son in the world.

99
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,214
The revolver was made
for you.

100
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,731
There was no horse
I could not ride.

101
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,937
Neither man who
not win.

102
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,058
But now he's dead.

103
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,137
Your broken heart
by the bullet of a robber.

104
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,138
- I'll help.
- Take your hands off me!

105
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,256
If you want to help,
hang the murderer.

106
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,419
You do not know if he killed him.

107
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,377
All he knows is that
this man stole their cattle.

108
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,088
Do you believe me capable of killing
a man for stealing cattle?

109
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,778
He killed my son.

110
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,214
And die for it.

111
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,898
We shoot, we are not
livestock!

112
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,860
For your kicks any
'd say you're a mule.

113
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,455
I'm glad you're not.

114
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,216
Let go!

115
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,890
- Leave it!
- Quiet, Daddy.

116
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,652
- Friend of yours?
- It's my daughter.

117
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,450
The old set us
a trap.

118
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,090
What happened?

119
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,460
We came riding
quietly, ...

120
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,053
Old singing ...
his lungs, ...

121
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,450
When he started ... hooting
as an owl.

122
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,212
We thought he was crazy.

123
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,292
Suddenly she appeared
and told us that we marcháramos.

124
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,736
We discuss and began
shooting.

125
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,697
So treat your guests?

126
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,135
Never invite farmers.

127
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,740
Leave it, Anne.

128
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,176
I've tried to convince them.
But they are the law.

129
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,649
The law?

130
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,892
What do they want?

131
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,168
- His father is arrested.
- Why?

132
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,656
For stealing.

133
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,698
- Stealing says?
- That's what I said.

134
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,739
Well, now that we
friends ...

135
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,648
Thank you.

136
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,293
Want ... maybe dinner.
Anne cooks very well.

137
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,934
Let's try their food,
What can we lose?

138
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,011
As our lives.

139
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,692
The Old Testament.

140
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,612
Incredible document!

141
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,253
Shot dear. I can not
cleaned more.

142
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,653
OLD RIFLE
THIS IN THE BARN

143
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,053
This is what I call
a good home cooked meal.

144
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,497
You yourself dinner!

145
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,693
I'm hungry!

146
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,654
Set the table,
I'm not your maid!

147
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,053
Notes:

148
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,655
Whereas,
hereby ...

149
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,493
Bequeath my heritage ...
my daughter.

150
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,299
The recital does not make you
lack.

151
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,819
Well, as you say, ...

152
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,369
But many ...
recitals ...

153
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,815
To look like ... seriously.

154
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,814
And this knife I leave ...

155
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,011
I leave it to me.

156
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,411
Of time.

157
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,218
All right.
He writes:

158
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,888
I leave the sheriff Merrick,
to my regret.

159
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,335
Furthermore, ...

160
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,013
Inquire ... ...

161
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,819
All parties ...
interested, ...

162
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,891
Me ... I want my daughter Anne, ...

163
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,891
Relive ... Lancaster.

164
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,129
Whereas living
Aida with her aunt Bessie.

165
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,495
That goes to put it.

166
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,770
It is my will.

167
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,175
Write it.

168
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,853
Do I have to leave my daughter, no?

169
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,089
I have to leave it to someone.

170
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,730
I tell you what has
to put ...

171
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,255
What will ...
on his tombstone.

172
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,968
Here lies my beloved father ...

173
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,013
Killed by the sheriff ...
Merrick.

174
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,177
Tell me, what is your name?

175
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,854
So we can put it completely.

176
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,893
Where are you going?

177
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,778
A put liniment,
Cares?

178
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,773
His spurs were
goose.

179
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,170
And you, where you are going?

180
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,173
It would be wrong to leave her
go alone.

181
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,894
Do not trust me?

182
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,415
It is a very ugly wound,
need help.

183
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,531
Do not worry, sheriff,
knows the way.

184
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,850
Sit down, I'll play
guitar.

185
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,817
Play the guitar
for them.

186
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,448
And redo the owl.

187
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,615
A cautious type,
not trust anyone.

188
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,895
When works.

189
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,130
Ie, from sunrise to sunset.

190
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,296
I'm going to water the horses.

191
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,451
I already gave them.

192
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,088
I have to put more things
to complete the document.

193
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,898
Here I have some boots.

194
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,692
I bought by mail
twelve years ago.

195
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,055
I have not used, it's a shame,
They are almost new.

196
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,619
- What number do you wear?
- The same. Thank you.

197
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,018
Well, moving on.

198
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,019
Look what's here.

199
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,217
I forgot, the reserved
for the wedding of Anne.

200
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,415
He writes:

201
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,491
Hereby
leave this ...

202
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,697
Better forget it.

203
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,852
It is very dark.

204
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,499
Are you afraid?

205
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,173
Yet.

206
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,258
I'll get it.

207
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,131
Sit.

208
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,857
Sting. Special
for horses and mules.

209
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,738
This will serve.

210
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,057
Hop pants.

211
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,656
I've marked it well, right?

212
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,057
It's nothing.

213
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,016
I would not have tried so
knew it was a girl.

214
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,011
I do not blame.

215
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,575
Sorry, but it would be easier
if you wore a dress.

216
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,492
The dresses, clog.

217
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,049
Depends on what you do.

218
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,572
It will be enough.

219
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,614
Sheriff, I'm sorry
I said before in the house.

220
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,976
It was to kill you
my father.

221
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,290
I did not take it seriously.

222
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,170
Let it go.

223
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,571
Do not you understand?

224
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,810
If you are caught you will be lynched.

225
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,769
They did not lynch,
I promise.

226
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,609
You do not know
these farmers.

227
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,456
We have burned the harvest
for three consecutive years.

228
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,818
Farmers do not want
these lands.

229
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,615
The fourth year we burned
the house.

230
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,256
Do you think you are not able
yo lynch?

231
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,729
He's been caught stealing cattle.

232
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,816
Give it a chance, sir,
please.

233
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,896
Why you?

234
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,370
If you want.

235
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,211
No hurt so needed.

236
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,336
Hurt me??

237
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,375
I use simple spur.

238
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,418
You are struck with
a Mexican spur.

239
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,172
No, let me do.

240
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,649
He is very stubborn you.

241
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,572
Did he use
as a crutch?

242
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,454
I thought tie it around his neck!

243
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,615
Sheriff, nobody knows
we came.

244
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:30,416
Talk.

245
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,335
Roden try to prevent
Loma Santa arrives ...

246
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,933
Man ... with his ranch,
stop them.

247
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,576
Before he was thus
What happened?

248
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,011
I did not know who had
a sheriff.

249
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,934
I do not want trouble for lynch
a rustler.

250
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,852
They also want to lynch
to you

251
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,095
Escóltenos his men
to Santa Loma.

252
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,249
I live here.

253
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,331
No one will face
Roden for a murderer.

254
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,452
Still not been
convicted.

255
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,929
What more proof do you need?
Ed is dead.

256
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,818
And the old man had won.

257
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,090
If you are a murderer,
court deal with it.

258
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,728
If no handles Roden
to do before.

259
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,733
Did you know what he wrote
boy in her grave?

260
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,891
Here lies the heart
of a parent.

261
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,130
A man without heart
It is a dangerous enemy.

262
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,136
Thank you.

263
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,373
Any law prohibits scrub?

264
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:38,374
Sit, Len.

265
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,935
Today we do not eat.

266
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,499
In March, guys.

267
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,979
Do not spend the night here?

268
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,095
Roden seeks him.

269
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,579
Or we go fast
or we are lost.

270
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,855
I do not get it.

271
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,658
We'll go through the desert
Santa Loma.

272
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,572
The desert?
We are in August.

273
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,413
Not make it,
very hot.

274
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,218
It is impossible
Loma Santa around.

275
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,769
We have no choice. Roden
We find if we follow another path.

276
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,339
We kill them all.

277
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,617
Give him the old,
only give us problems.

278
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,578
Give up and save your skin,
coward.

279
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,334
We're now
through the desert.

280
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,369
I know it will be very hard, but
never think of looking for us there.

281
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,690
And if they do, take
overnight lead.

282
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,098
In March, Billy.

283
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,419
Come on, we finished dinner.
Put your hat.

284
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,579
Two more.

285
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,172
Make sure that the saddlebags are well attached.
Do not carry too much food.

286
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,376
You can not miss us water
on this tour.

287
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,498
Sheriff, I feel cause
many problems. I want to thank ...

288
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,220
It is not for you,
it's the law.

289
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,338
I would even if I had
killed 10 men.

290
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,694
Do you think I killed him?

291
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,090
I do not think anything
neither one nor the other.

292
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,212
You are not going anywhere.

293
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,495
I'm going with him.

294
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,855
Stay, we will
Santa Loma.

295
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,851
I will not leave you alone.

296
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,658
This new generation.

297
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,970
Do you think you resist?

298
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,971
Since, Mt.

299
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,776
It is hard, Billy type.

300
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,658
It is a righteous man.

301
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,053
It can be.

302
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,417
I think there are over
songs.

303
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,093
He's right.

304
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,980
Although it may be best
keep singing.

305
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,780
<i> Down in the valley ... </ i></i>

306
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,777
<i> ... the valley so low, ... </ i></i>

307
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,889
<i> About your head ... </ i></i>

308
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,096
<i> ... hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

309
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,820
<i> Hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

310
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:43,053
<i> ... hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

311
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,567
<i> On your head
hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

312
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,299
Do not sing that!

313
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,537
<i> Hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

314
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,974
Enough!

315
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,210
What's the matter, son?

316
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,570
Do not call me son again.

317
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,573
I do not because it is
my blood.

318
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,219
Forget it.

319
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,538
What's the matter, Billy?

320
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,577
Not bad singing.

321
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,300
No one has ever said anything.

322
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,893
If I were you,
sing no more, Daddy.

323
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,254
Why not?

324
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,574
His father used to sing.

325
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,979
Merrick, listen.

326
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,140
My father could only escape ...

327
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,610
But with so many horses ...
they follow the trail.

328
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,369
Give it a chance,
let go.

329
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,214
My obligation is to take
before the judge.

330
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,330
They hang.

331
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,252
Then it will hang.

332
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,693
Hopefully his father also dies
hanging from a tree.

333
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,977
Sure, you've hit the mark!

334
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,335
What's up, Dad?

335
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,093
I got him.

336
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,615
Me loose before
soportándome follow.

337
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:14,077
<i> Down in the valley, ... </ i></i>

338
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:16,529
<i> ... the valley so low, ... </ i></i>

339
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,176
<i> over your head ... and ... </ i></i>

340
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:21,787
<i> ... hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

341
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,539
<i> Hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

342
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,016
<i> ... hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

343
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,983
<i> over your head ... and ... </ i></i>

344
00:24:30,194 --> 00:24:32,010
<i> ... hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

345
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,174
Hate this song.
His father used to sing.

346
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,657
Sorry, Len.

347
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,775
I remember your father, do not you, son?
Will it also led him to the gallows?

348
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,129
Why do not you call me daddy?
So do you keep the joke.

349
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,813
We have a tough road
ahead. The burning wind.

350
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,697
Billy, checks the water.

351
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,130
Lou, full canteens.

352
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,495
Before I prepare the food.

353
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,456
Eat without dismounting.

354
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,568
What?

355
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,651
Eat without dismounting.

356
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,139
We have ridden all night.

357
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,734
Must rest
during the day.

358
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,495
Within hours
the desert is so hot, ...

359
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,493
- ... You can fry eggs.
- Fill it.

360
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,096
I almost drowned.

361
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,616
His father also
chewing snuff, son?

362
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:22,946
<i> Down in the valley, ... </ i></i>

363
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:25,218
<i> ... the valley so low, ... </ i></i>

364
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:27,638
<i> over your head ... and ... </ i></i>

365
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:28,558
<i> ... hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

366
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,729
Let dad.

367
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,811
Do not get cause.

368
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,416
Assign, I have given
a good stab.

369
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,815
If I could catch
his revolver.

370
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,734
This song is better
a gun.

371
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,839
<i> Down in the valley, ... </ i></i>

372
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,979
<i> ... the valley so low, ... </ i></i>

373
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:49,338
<i> over your head ... and ... </ i></i>

374
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,584
<i> ... hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

375
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:54,126
<i> Hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

376
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:56,006
<i> ... hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

377
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,649
<i> over your head ... and ... </ i></i>

378
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:05,337
<i> Hold me tight, ... </ i></i>

379
00:27:05,677 --> 00:27:08,442
<i> ... give them my warmest ... </ i></i>

380
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:11,500
<i> ... if you do not love me ... </ i></i>

381
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,591
<i> ... love who you please. </ i></i>

382
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,019
You are full, Len.

383
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
Very well.

384
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,499
Underway.

385
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,810
We will.

386
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,328
I love it.

387
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,138
Monte on his horse.

388
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,811
It is the stream of dead man
You know, Billy?

389
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,936
And that?

390
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,011
A sheriff fell from his horse
and drowned right here.

391
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:48,520
<i> valley low, ... </ i></i>

392
00:28:49,504 --> 00:28:51,783
<i> over your head ... and ... </ i></i>

393
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:54,256
<i> ... hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

394
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,256
<i> ... hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

395
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,193
<i> ... hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

396
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,500
<i> over your head ... and ... </ i></i>

397
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:03,716
<i> ... hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

398
00:29:03,904 --> 00:29:06,281
<i> If you love me ... </ i></i>

399
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,012
Are not you going to shut up that old?

400
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,092
He seems to have stepped
a monkey tail.

401
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,617
No one can stand
in this heat.

402
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,768
It's my fault.

403
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,692
I should not talk about ...

404
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,418
About what?

405
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,332
I'll also
on this tour, you know?

406
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,819
Nothing.

407
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,031
<i> If you love me ... </ i></i>

408
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,504
<i> ... love who you please. </ i></i>

409
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:33,917
<i> Hold me ... </ i></i>

410
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:36,917
<i> ... give them my warmest. </ i></i>

411
00:29:37,246 --> 00:29:39,298
<i>Give my warmest  ... </ i></i>

412
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:41,359
<i> ... give them my warmest ... </ i></i>

413
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,485
<i> Hold me .. </ i></i>

414
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,810
Follow this starts
to like ... son!

415
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,533
Rest here.

416
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,091
Prepare food, Lou.

417
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,651
Are you hungry now?

418
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,254
Basta, Lou, he also
what's going wrong.

419
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,489
Put a medal.

420
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,018
Merrick, make a deal.

421
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,217
What would not hear me
more singing that song?

422
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,898
Soon will be darkened, and no
blame him.

423
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,938
I will try to cross the desert
to the border, ...

424
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,097
And ... will not hear
that song.

425
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,613
No deal.

426
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,656
Return with others.

427
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,458
Very good, very good.

428
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,134
Answer me one thing, son, ...

429
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,096
... About his father.

430
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,249
I'm curious, child.

431
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,976
What he also hung up?

432
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:27,977
Drop it!
Drop it!

433
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:28,978
Father!

434
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,374
What happened?

435
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,054
Not to make a deal.

436
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,370
Do not even talk about it.

437
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,372
What is it?
Have you gone mad?

438
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,212
Lou helps with food.

439
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,333
Len does not make sense
behave well.

440
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,928
Do you also want to sing?

441
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,208
I do not know.

442
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,417
You know, maybe we should not
take him to Santa Loma.

443
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,774
What are you saying?

444
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,610
It's just an old
scoundrel,

445
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,692
You know what I mean ...

446
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,813
Looks like a murderer ... no.

447
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,015
It's none of your business.

448
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,295
Not mine.

449
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,133
Our duty is to deliver it.

450
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,413
Mount up!

451
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,769
Give us the thief ...

452
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,249
Or you will die ...!

453
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,897
I warn
Last, Roden, ...

454
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,178
More ... stay away!

455
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,531
Come on, take cover!

456
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,695
Keep shooting.

457
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,373
I hit the water.

458
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,292
I want the thief.

459
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,135
Fast!
Come on!

460
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,739
Squat!

461
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,740
Look, Roden!

462
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,494
The catch the thief.

463
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,848
A trigger finger more
will be fine.

464
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,333
I also know how to shoot.

465
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,049
Go back to your site.
Come on!

466
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,252
Drop it.
Hurry!

467
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,139
Still, and raising hands.

468
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,019
Get over there.

469
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,020
Tell them to stop!

470
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,939
Stop them!

471
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,175
Alto, father!
Stop!

472
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,377
Cease fire!

473
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,491
Release my son!

474
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,130
- Go away from here, Roden!
- Okay.

475
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,175
You can stay
the rustler ...

476
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,212
Release ... but my son.

477
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,339
YOUR child will come to us
Santa Loma.

478
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,536
Thus, it will cause us
more problems.

479
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,213
Drop it, I command you!

480
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,456
Go away or I'll kill him!

481
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,177
I lost a son.

482
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,935
I can not lose another.

483
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,333
I Átalo.

484
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,254
What happened?

485
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,452
I turned my back.

486
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,690
I'm a clumsy assistant.

487
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,659
You remove the plate as
get to Santa Loma.

488
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,936
You have to go back now.

489
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,448
You can not cross the desert with him.

490
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:52,449
Shut!

491
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,332
Do not listen, Len, I'm fine.

492
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,417
We only water is
of the canteens.

493
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,097
- There is a well half desert.
- Is it true?

494
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,416
Sure, I'm thirsty.

495
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,218
You can be lying.
Return.

496
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:05,219
No, ...

497
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,295
Roden attack us ...
in the gorge.

498
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,609
And I will not lose.

499
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,728
In the desert
you can not hide.

500
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,730
Move!

501
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,492
What are you waiting for?

502
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,933
Sorry, Billy.

503
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,899
Can you do it?

504
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,414
We will.

505
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,531
Lou, who rides
horse Billy.

506
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,575
You'll be fine, boy.

507
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,889
Sure, ...

508
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,291
I have been hurt ...
other times.

509
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,533
Want to relax?

510
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,619
Lean, Billy.

511
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,814
Stop looking for your father.

512
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,450
Appreciates your life.
We did not follow.

513
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,653
I'm burning, ...

514
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,811
Ardo ... inside.

515
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,095
I thirst.

516
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,215
Do not waste water.

517
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,815
Missing a day's journey
to reach the well.

518
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,418
I feel that escaped me
sorry about your father, Len.

519
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,411
Forget it, Billy.

520
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,730
You saved my life
many times.

521
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,697
Can you forgive me?

522
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,054
Forget it, Billy.

523
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,619
Everything will be fine.

524
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,532
Sing that song, ...

525
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,059
I like ... that song.

526
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,373
Sing.

527
00:42:49,294 --> 00:42:51,114
<i> In the valley below ... </ i></i>

528
00:42:52,284 --> 00:42:54,809
<i> ... the valley so low, ... </ i></i>

529
00:42:55,423 --> 00:42:57,576
<i> over your head ... and ... </ i></i>

530
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:00,953
<i> ... hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

531
00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:03,487
<i> Hear the wind blow, ... </ i></i>

532
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,541
<i> ... hear the wind blow. </ i></i>

533
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,655
I follow you, Len.

534
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,370
I will follow you forever.

535
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,336
He's dead.

536
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,013
If I had heard, ...

537
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,092
If he had left ... go to my father,
would not have died!

538
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,137
You and their law!

539
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,494
How many more will kill?

540
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,175
Continue in an hour.

541
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,849
Pray for him.

542
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,136
And when we get to Santa Loma
pray for you.

543
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,531
- I did not shoot him.
- You, your father, all are guilty.

544
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,656
And you you will pay for it.

545
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,979
Look what you've done!

546
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,017
If he had not killed
my brother!

547
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,930
What are you talking about?

548
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,216
Murderer!

549
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,093
We should hang when
catch him.

550
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,170
Father, but we
have been arrested?

551
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,329
It's what they say, small.

552
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,173
Do not think saying a prayer?

553
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,692
He knew the risk he was taking.

554
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,414
Do not you feel anything?

555
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,413
Do not you care that your best friend
he's dead?

556
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,251
It was not me who killed him.

557
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,216
The fulfilled the law.

558
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,498
The law!

559
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,697
Does the law will lead to my father
to the gallows?

560
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,294
Billy followed the law
and he's dead.

561
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,334
If you forget the law, Billy would still be alive
and my father would not die.

562
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,338
I did that once.

563
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,493
Once I forgot the law,
and my father died for it.

564
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,573
I let hang
my own father.

565
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,774
I killed him.

566
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,857
I was his assistant,
Billy as mine.

567
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,451
Had to deliver
two prisoners.

568
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,818
They wanted to lynch them and I thought
they deserved.

569
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,376
We discussed ...

570
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,815
My father and I ... ...

571
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,495
... And he took the prisoners alone.

572
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,333
We waited on the road.

573
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,376
We also lynched him.

574
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,930
Is that why it behaves like this?

575
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,690
If I had gone with him, ...

576
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,495
Billy came ... like me ...

577
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,849
... Had followed the law, ...

578
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,899
Rather than take ...
justice for my hand, ...

579
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,734
My father ... still be alive.

580
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,656
Or you would also be
dead.

581
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,175
They could lynched him, too.

582
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:11,936
It would have been better.

583
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,971
Stop agonizing over
a past mistake.

584
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,498
Long ago
I stopped doing it.

585
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,012
But when his father
sang that song ...

586
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,694
Well ... my father did ...

587
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,737
I remembered everything ... again.

588
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,415
Why did not you tell me
who accuse my father of murder?

589
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,731
Who told you?

590
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,618
That does not matter ...

591
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,095
But ... now I know why
did not tell me.

592
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,978
Because he knows I love him ...

593
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,654
As much as you want ...
yours.

594
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,570
We are very similar,
You and me.

595
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,415
You are blamed for failing
saved his father, ...

596
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,812
And ... I just try to save
mine.

597
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,458
I can not fool you.

598
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:21,177
He risked his life Billy
on behalf of the law, ...

599
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,853
Has ... but also risky
yours.

600
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,494
I wish my father did not
between us.

601
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,338
I've been thinking.

602
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,809
What?

603
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,336
You could win
lot of money.

604
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,180
No one is bitter sweet.

605
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,649
Want to be the foreman
our ranch?

606
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,619
If you let me escape ...

607
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,008
Reward you ... my father.

608
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,819
I'll tell you what you've done,
and make you foreman.

609
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,415
I do not think enough.

610
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,730
Okay calls.

611
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,094
What is enough?

612
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,770
I own ranch.

613
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,975
Continued.

614
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,932
A big, ya understand me.

615
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,931
Ten acres, perhaps ...

616
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,330
- ... And won.
- You got it.

617
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,090
My father will give the best
ranch all.

618
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,456
You are afraid.

619
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,211
You are scared!

620
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,979
Why would I be scared?

621
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,334
By Merrick.

622
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,615
Do you think enough?

623
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,419
So I do not accept
your proposal.

624
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,810
I do not want to pursue
the rest of my life.

625
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,538
He will not do anything.

626
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,817
No, because I will not
to give him a chance.

627
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,015
Do the same.

628
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,338
Billy has been murdered, ...

629
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,411
Do not like you ... and nothing.

630
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,855
Nothing at all.

631
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,016
You and I are in the same boat.
We have to be together.

632
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,093
You and me?

633
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,172
I killed your brother,
Remember?

634
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,251
- You said you did not.
- Do you believe me?

635
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,614
Yes, of course.

636
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,659
Is that why you tried to kill me?

637
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,971
Hey, I made a mistake.
All were wrong.

638
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,450
Your mistake could cost me
life.

639
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,696
Better
did you calm down ...

640
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,214
He has given you ... a lot of sun.

641
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,219
We must do something.

642
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,850
We can not wait
that crazy to kill us.

643
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,536
You got that right, ...

644
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,689
But ... what can we do?
They have guns.

645
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,615
- What about us?
- We have the girl.

646
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,576
What?

647
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,735
She knows to handle him.

648
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,369
That is, kill!

649
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,616
Let them!

650
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,611
Let them finish!

651
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,374
What has happened now?

652
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,417
They have fought.
Nothing more.

653
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,855
Your duty was to prevent it.

654
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,055
Add the horse.

655
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,854
Collect, Lou.

656
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,738
I'll take care of you.

657
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,855
You do not occupy anyone.

658
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,092
Where is your gun?

659
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,656
Here!

660
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,255
Come on, stupid, ...

661
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,334
... Take off your belt.

662
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,897
Toss it here.

663
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,214
My father with me.

664
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,569
You have to understand.

665
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,772
You made me believe ...

666
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,168
I think all I said ..

667
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,737
But I will not ... I die.

668
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,897
Take my belt also.

669
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,855
We're even.

670
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,178
Now we're even.

671
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,929
Do not repeat ...

672
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,010
If put back ...
hand over ...

673
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,376
I will ... kill you.

674
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,059
I wish I was dead

675
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,734
Maybe it is
sooner than you think.

676
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,579
Stop!

677
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,890
My horse was hurt.

678
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,939
Eh, sir!

679
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,209
That well, ...

680
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,578
Is there ...?

681
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,818
Yes, but there is way.

682
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,092
The horses will not hold
much more.

683
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,488
Soon be dark.

684
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,532
Where did you get that?

685
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,334
Why?

686
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,689
For nothing.

687
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,253
My brother had one like it.

688
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,019
I found it next to him.

689
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,010
Now it's mine.

690
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,455
Now everything here belongs to me.
Give it to me.

691
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,209
Which you will not do you
no foul.

692
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,330
Lou, mounted on horse
the girl.

693
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,611
And you ride with your father.

694
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,168
I warned you.

695
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,934
And if horses
do not stand up well?

696
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,055
Walk.

697
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,410
Move!

698
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,775
He is asleep ...

699
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,209
But ... no.

700
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,019
Go back to your site.

701
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,979
Better sleep also.

702
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,413
Now I sleep in Santa Loma ...

703
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,490
... Hanging from the gallows.

704
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,812
We do not know
the jury's verdict.

705
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,692
Think will not go well
standing, right, Sheriff?

706
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,858
I do not like to hang
anyone.

707
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,010
Is it because you remember
his father?

708
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,215
No, it's not that.

709
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,376
Why her?

710
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:29,850
What's wrong?

711
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,929
Nothing.

712
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,297
I know you do not want to see me
Hanging, and neither.

713
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,655
So ...

714
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:41,377
... If I have a chance to get out
from here and Santa Loma ...

715
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,093
I think ... do.

716
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,977
I do not back
unless you want to die.

717
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,611
I have nothing personal
against you, friend, ...

718
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,936
... On the contrary,
thank you ...

719
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,898
Not to say ...
of which I am accused.

720
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,735
But that does not change the situation.

721
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,012
Now I know
get out.

722
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,092
He knows perfectly.

723
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,535
Do not believe that feelings
going to cloud my judgment.

724
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,852
Fair enough, sir.

725
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,498
Also do not expect anything from me.

726
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,976
And I see that prefer
talk to sleep ...

727
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:27,936
Up ... again.

728
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,619
Collect.

729
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:21,702
Father, ...

730
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,053
Brings us to ... well
or to the border?

731
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,131
As well, small.

732
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,495
There soon ...

733
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,458
If ... we have not lost.

734
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,015
Have you heard, Len?

735
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,898
You've killed a horse, ...

736
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:40,497
Or find the well ...
or kill them all.

737
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,048
Not only the horses.

738
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,378
Ride out.

739
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,257
We will, at a gallop.

740
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,129
Roden and his men!

741
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,574
Cover!

742
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,609
Where are they?

743
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:17,969
There!

744
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,376
Have you gone mad?

745
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,649
Are some rocks.

746
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,851
Look, the brave sheriff, ...

747
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,853
Shooting ... rocks.

748
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,489
Congratulations heroic sheriff,
has captured a mirage.

749
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,332
And with one hand!

750
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,532
Hang in breathing, ...

751
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,099
That's ... not a mirage.

752
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,094
Adelante!

753
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,209
Take cover and keep your
head down!

754
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,849
Lou, remove the handcuffs.

755
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,932
These bugs await their dinner.

756
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,933
There is the well.

757
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,215
It's a trick.

758
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,454
He killed my brother
and kill us all.

759
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,418
When you fall rendered
will flee to the border.

760
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,936
Before you all you will fall.

761
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,095
Look! I told you!
Water!

762
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,213
Do not drink!

763
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,615
The water is poisoned.

764
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,578
My father did.

765
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,298
Wants to kill me ...

766
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,297
So ... has.

767
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,291
And you also
wants to kill me.

768
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:36,730
The sun has upset him.

769
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,459
That water would kill us all.

770
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,660
No water will not get
Santa Loma.

771
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,937
What will you do now, Len?

772
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,854
Guadalupe River is
part time.

773
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,339
It is true, to the south.

774
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,853
What are we waiting?
Come on!

775
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,055
Hold it!

776
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,131
The Guadalupe is on the border.

777
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,813
Continue towards
Santa Loma.

778
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,175
That's what you say.
Enough is enough.

779
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,350
We've followed here ...

780
01:02:02,398 --> 01:02:04,610
But now we go ...
south.

781
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:06,611
You swore to obey
orders.

782
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,374
Billy also
And what do you get?

783
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,336
Come on!

784
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,809
I give the orders!

785
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,493
We'll go east!

786
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:15,969
Ride your horse.

787
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,968
All of you!

788
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,613
Mount up on horses.

789
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,053
You, put handcuffs.

790
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,256
Sheriff, ...

791
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:42,971
Yesterday ... we were three against you
Today we are four.

792
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,892
How long has sleepless
Merrick?

793
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,218
Yesterday did not sleep, ...

794
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,649
Or ... the night before.

795
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,094
Forty hours without sleep, ...

796
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:52,495
More ... maybe.

797
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,772
Your gun will not be
awake while you sleep.

798
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,931
You also you need
sleep.

799
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,694
We slept last night
and sleep today.

800
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,251
Sleep in Santa Loma.

801
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,773
We will not stop until then.

802
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,693
We will sleep before
in the chair.

803
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:11,535
Yes, in turns, while
You wait for fall.

804
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,299
Sweet dreams, sheriff.

805
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,054
When you wake up,
if you do, ...

806
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,734
Do not wait ... find here.

807
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,370
So take leave
Now, it is more polite.

808
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,259
Wait.

809
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,772
You ride with me.

810
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,892
So we say goodbye better.

811
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,609
Move!

812
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,173
Not last much longer.

813
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,013
I thought I would fall before.

814
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,057
Do not you drive them back?

815
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,053
Wait till you close your eyes
and you'll see.

816
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,336
You will not regret,
I promise.

817
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,819
Of course not.

818
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,495
But as you fulfill
the deal, yes you will.

819
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,418
I know you're tired.

820
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,453
I'd stop ...

821
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,012
But ... we have to follow.

822
01:04:59,013 --> 01:05:00,013
Anne, ...

823
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,930
Sorry ... this.

824
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,978
But do not blame you.

825
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,654
I know only try
save your father.

826
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,813
Have you become human?

827
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:16,136
You forget that you're the law?

828
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,214
Not the best time
to quarrel.

829
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,539
Not now.

830
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,453
We have the few minutes.

831
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,853
We'll make it.

832
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,368
Are you okay, Len?

833
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:54,695
Wake up!

834
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,592
- I have.
- I have.

835
01:05:59,593 --> 01:06:00,893
Just what
we were expecting!

836
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,015
We are free!

837
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,977
You can not leave him,
die.

838
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,175
Finish him.

839
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,614
Dad, do not!

840
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,133
Speak thou.
It's your daughter.

841
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,938
It is the occasion
we were expecting.

842
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,294
Len, wake up!

843
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,133
Len ...
Len is now.

844
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,098
Do not you understand that only
I'm trying to save your father?

845
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,690
I can help you
across the border.

846
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,418
No one can stop us.

847
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,899
I will be the master of the ranch,
and throughout the country.

848
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:26,052
Now, my brother is gone.

849
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,938
Your brother?
You do not sound very sorry.

850
01:06:30,217 --> 01:06:31,039
Dad!

851
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,697
Come on, shoot!
Shoot and go!

852
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:42,635
No! No!

853
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,373
So what are you waiting for?

854
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,092
Have the gun.

855
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:03,020
Use it while you have time.

856
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,169
Take it you, I'm no good
to maintain law.

857
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,018
You killed him.

858
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,053
Why do not you finished the job?

859
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,412
How stupid you are!

860
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,170
Lou had a rifle.

861
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,974
Dad killed
to save your life.

862
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,254
Wasting your time, Anne.

863
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,891
It's just a petty and limited man.

864
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,331
You had your chance ...

865
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,534
Left ... and escape.

866
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,891
Sometimes
we all feel confused.

867
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:53,059
I put my head
hanging.

868
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,573
Well, sheriff,
Now it's up to you

869
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,095
Has the gun
and it is the law.

870
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,407
What will you do now?

871
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,698
Bury Lou.

872
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,894
Start digging.

873
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,256
We have blades.

874
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,219
Use your hands.

875
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,057
It seems that now ...

876
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,415
... Have to use your feet.

877
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,213
Congratulations, sheriff,
got what he wanted.

878
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,779
There is Santa Loma.

879
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,134
Three days on
waiting, sheriff.

880
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,699
We delayed.

881
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,339
Well, sheriff, ...

882
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,179
... Are all yours.

883
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,371
- Sheriff Merrick?
- Yes

884
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:37,575
I am the judge Marlowe.

885
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,329
And his assistants?

886
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,095
Dead.

887
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:45,332
His son replies
by one.

888
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:49,459
- And the other?
- The old killed him to protect me.

889
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,456
Roden, can share
your child's cell.

890
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,937
Mr. Roden want to pay
the security of your child.

891
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,613
Of that coyote?

892
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,213
Tomorrow would be in Mexico.

893
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,859
Do you plan to stop me?

894
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,293
You will not flee.

895
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,813
Not while the old alive.

896
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,575
The deposit is $ 5,000.

897
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,332
The court will meet in 3 hours.

898
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,939
Honor, ...

899
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,654
Think ... not celebrate
trial tonight?

900
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,048
I have no choice.

901
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,290
I will judge Keith tonight
Roden and the morning.

902
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,052
I have a trial in Pueblo.

903
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:26,132
Justice! Is this what
we promised?

904
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,098
I warned, is justice
of farmers.

905
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:33,170
A night view
to hang him soon.

906
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,855
Already you satisfied?

907
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,420
Young, I understand that
worry about your father ...

908
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:43,333
Justice ... but does not depend
the time of day.

909
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:47,095
The trial of his father will
equally fair lady.

910
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,691
The people of this territory
against Timothy Keith.

911
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,691
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

912
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,696
I swear.

913
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,818
That morning, Ed got up
before dawn.

914
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,650
He was always the first
to rise, ...

915
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:10,095
... And go to work.

916
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,413
He had ...

917
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,014
Born ... for the ranch.

918
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:21,018
That morning, went to the
northern part to find the cattle.

919
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,295
That was the last time
I saw my son alive.

920
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,097
I saw my brother out.

921
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,978
It was 6:00.

922
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,051
I returned to the ranch, ...

923
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,972
By ... a food for my father.

924
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,656
Dan had discussed
with his father.

925
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,459
Did not understand why
Dan was not like his brother.

926
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:40,933
He got angry with us all ...

927
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,615
And said ... think we were in a hurry.
We did not have time for breakfast.

928
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:49,178
We ordered Sam and me,
that we were to help Ed

929
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:53,772
We found the body at 10
in a cotton field.

930
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:57,649
He was on the floor with a bullet
back the size of a dollar.

931
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,488
The ground was trampled
by cattle.

932
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:04,778
Wilson and Bill Jerome Jake
arrived then, ...

933
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,017
And ... we trace
livestock.

934
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:11,253
At noon, we reached the murderer
and at 12 head of cattle.

935
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,178
No resistance.

936
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,369
He could not.

937
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,696
Even tried
draw his revolver.

938
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,856
He was too scared ...

939
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,849
But I ... found guilty.

940
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,490
Stole cattle, it is true.

941
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,055
I will not say I did not.

942
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:31,452
But I tell you the truth,
I did not kill Ed

943
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,449
He could follow the track,
but he passed me.

944
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,579
The only problem is:

945
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,050
He is not here to prove it.

946
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,577
The defense rests.

947
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:46,934
The accusation is over.

948
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,962
Wait a minute!

949
01:13:57,272 --> 01:13:58,217
Your Honor?

950
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,892
I am an officer of the law.

951
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:11,728
When a man is accused
of a crime, I arrest.

952
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,778
When finished my work ...

953
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:16,818
Is ... the jury decides
if he's innocent or guilty.

954
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,413
It has never mattered to me
verdict.

955
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,339
But this time is different.

956
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:30,698
I can not prove it,
but I know he's innocent.

957
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,532
He took my revolver
and could kill me ...

958
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,370
Used it ... but to defend
Man who tried to kill me.

959
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,933
I do not speak because
I saved his life.

960
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:45,093
What is important is that
had the opportunity to escape, ...

961
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,739
And ... did not.

962
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,370
A murderer would not have wasted
that opportunity.

963
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,929
You have escaped, regardless
where.

964
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,892
I think that's it.

965
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:02,216
Believe me, he's innocent.

966
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:04,134
Honor, ...

967
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,730
I can give ...
a question to the sheriff?

968
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,796
Go ahead.

969
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:09,891
Are you in love
daughter of the accused?

970
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,822
Yes.

971
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,287
That's all, Your Honor.

972
01:15:18,692 --> 01:15:20,010
I hope the verdict.

973
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,449
Gentlemen of the jury,
Do you already have your verdict?

974
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,779
You see, judge, ...

975
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:34,408
... Want a fair verdict.

976
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:38,539
Nobody saw kill the young Roden,
but he's dead.

977
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:42,058
No other
suspect, ...

978
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,736
Defendant wore ... and won
stolen.

979
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:48,411
So we have no choice
to find him guilty.

980
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,218
Prisoner, stand up.

981
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,339
You heard the verdict.

982
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,819
The penalty is mandatory
as dictated by law.

983
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,936
This court convicted ...

984
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,739
To be hung ...
until he dies.

985
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,891
The sentence will be executed
at dawn.

986
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:03,088
You can not stay here.

987
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,531
If it's against the law,
arrest me.

988
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,538
You respect the law.

989
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,972
Yes, respect.

990
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,730
I told you it would
a fair trial.

991
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,169
He had a fair trial.

992
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,491
Then you'll be satisfied.

993
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,615
You testified in his favor,
Your conscience is clear.

994
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:34,570
But it was not a fair trial.

995
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,014
You've not allowed.

996
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:43,095
"It is not my
decide whether innocent or guilty. "

997
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,091
That's what you said.

998
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,133
No matter you discover
the truth ...

999
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,655
Dad deliver only ...
the judge.

1000
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:58,458
What do you think I've been
thinking all night?

1001
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,929
Yes, now you think ...

1002
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:05,255
Now ... it is too
late to prove his innocence.

1003
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,808
They dug his grave and you
he pushed her.

1004
01:18:19,671 --> 01:18:20,659
Father!

1005
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,893
Go home, dear.

1006
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:30,212
No, I'll stay with you, Father.

1007
01:18:30,213 --> 01:18:31,213
I'm not leaving.

1008
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,052
Out of my sight!

1009
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:51,815
You killed your father
and now you've killed me!

1010
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:54,250
What does this mean?

1011
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:55,250
It was crazy.

1012
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:56,819
I want to see the execution, too.

1013
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,136
You paid bail
to view.

1014
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,689
I want to see die murderer
his brother.

1015
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:02,770
What are you talking about?

1016
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,773
Son wanted
and did not want.

1017
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:07,214
Dan always knew.

1018
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:09,769
That's what you told your father
poisoned the well ...

1019
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,851
To get rid of you ... because
You were not like your brother.

1020
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:12,816
Do not listen.

1021
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,015
What are you trying to insinuate?

1022
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,216
I think Dan deserves
what is going to get, ...

1023
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,135
Included ... this.

1024
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,212
Do not be afraid,
it's just a watch.

1025
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:24,208
The dedication reads:
"For my son Dan, ...

1026
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,653
21 ... on your birthday. "

1027
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,483
Give it and be done with it.

1028
01:20:28,484 --> 01:20:30,735
Roden, I have kept for you

1029
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:33,410
I found him
the body of her son.

1030
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,332
Do not listen.
I was not there.

1031
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,377
I found him
the body of his brother.

1032
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:38,636
I lent it to Ed

1033
01:20:38,938 --> 01:20:40,930
He had lost his.

1034
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,819
Lie, ...

1035
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:46,611
Wearing his watch ... in the
pocket when he was buried.

1036
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,733
- Back!
- Drop the gun!

1037
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,255
I learned a quick trick, Merrick.
Remember!

1038
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,748
Drop the gun, Dan.

1039
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,412
Would you hang me?

1040
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:59,459
I want to die with a bullet
on the back, as you killed your brother.

1041
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,814
It's your fault.

1042
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,096
Everything for him and nothing for me.

1043
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,370
I had to do to get
my part.

1044
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:06,859
I worked and killed her.

1045
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,772
You can not take it.

1046
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,653
On the back, you coward!

1047
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,450
You shot ...!

1048
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,493
Do not follow me!

1049
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,929
Have you seen what
happened to me?

1050
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,694
A lawman
in the family, ...

1051
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,777
something ... that's scary.
