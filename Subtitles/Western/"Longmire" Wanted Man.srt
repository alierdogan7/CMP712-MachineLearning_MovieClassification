00:00:02,349 --> 00:00:05,118
<i>Walt: Character is fate.</i>

2
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:10,656
<i>The philosopher Heraclitus said that.</i>

3
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:12,491
<i>I think he meant,</i>

4
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:17,362
<i>Man makes his destiny through
his choices and his values.</i>

5
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:19,998
<i>Martha: Be careful, Walt!</i>

6
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:22,935
I'll try, Martha.

7
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:30,541
I'll try.

8
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:38,750
<i>So, as the arresting
officer of July 27, 2010,</i>

9
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:40,552
Is it your opinion Malachi Strand

10
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:42,553
should be granted early parole?

11
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:47,725
My opinion is that as
the Tribal Police Chief,

12
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:51,128
Malachi Strand was in fact
the most dangerous criminal

13
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:53,330
on the entire Cheyenne reservation.

14
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:56,767
Where are those federal
agents the B.I.A. Promised?

15
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:58,368
I got tired of waiting for 'em.

16
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,371
So you're going to arrest
Malachi in his own station

17
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:02,573
without any back-up?

18
00:01:02,574 --> 00:01:05,041
Not entirely without back-up.

19
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:21,123
Mr. Strand has expressed
remorse for his record.

20
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,391
As a matter of fact,

21
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:24,226
he has convinced a number of people here

22
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:27,363
of his rehabilitation and
fitness for reentering society.

23
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:29,499
Walt: I don't doubt that.

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,166
Malachi can be very convincing.

25
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:36,237
Well, if it isn't the long face of the law

26
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:40,341
and his little sidekick... Deputy Hank.

27
00:01:40,342 --> 00:01:42,143
This is a federally issued warrant

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,078
to arrest you on extortion charges.

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,284
Henry and I are here to serve it.

30
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:55,289
You two should probably
set your weapons down now.

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,225
You really think I'd
walk in here to arrest you

32
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:58,259
without federal back-up?

33
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,628
You're bluffing.

34
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,800
Am I?

35
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:10,071
Man: We understand who
Malachi Strand used to be.

36
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:12,606
What we're trying to
determine is, who is he now?

37
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:14,108
How's he changed?

38
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:17,545
A few weeks ago, Malachi tried to extort me

39
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,413
into giving favorable testimony

40
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:21,481
by threatening the life of my friend.

41
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,350
If Malachi is released,

42
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,086
his abuse and corruption
will only continue.

43
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:28,188
Malachi's character has not changed.

44
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,825
And jail is the only proper
fate for a man like him.

46
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:48,148
Ruby, as soon as there's a ruling

47
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:49,809
on the parole hearing, I want to hear it.

48
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,212
Whose parole hearing?

49
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,513
Malachi Strand.

50
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:55,715
Ruby, how many vacation days do I have?

51
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:57,049
All of them.

52
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:01,020
- Vacation days?
- I'm taking the day off.

53
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:03,490
As far as I can tell, the
best way to clear Henry

54
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:06,392
is to find the person that
actually killed Miller Beck.

55
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:09,395
Since when is finding a
murderer not police business?

56
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:11,564
It's not our police
business. It's Denver's.

57
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,200
I don't think our taxpayers
should be paying for me

58
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,501
to pursue a personal matter.

59
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:17,622
So you think one of these guys

60
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:18,956
is behind your wife's murder?

61
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:22,026
I think they had motivation, intelligence,

62
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:24,728
maybe even opportunity.

63
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,097
Malachi was in prison
when the murders happened,

64
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:32,635
but, uh... not this guy or this guy...

65
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:37,641
...or this guy.

66
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:39,843
Now I need to figure out
where these three were,

67
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,978
so you're in charge.

68
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,245
I'm sorry. In charge of who?

69
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:43,847
You told Branch to take time off

70
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,682
and Ferg's at that certification course.

71
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,249
Well, I got my radio if you need me.

72
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,385
Things have been pretty
quiet around here, so...

73
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:52,288
Walt, Newt Cunningham called.

74
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:58,361
Apparently, someone stole one
of his Rhode Island red hens.

75
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,967
Well, I stand corrected.

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,517
I told you I don't know
anyone named David Ridges.

77
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:28,224
My friend Tom and I know
that you're a White Warrior.

78
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:31,694
Just like Ridges.

79
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:36,031
My name is Sam Poteet. I
work in a hardware store.

80
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:38,500
I never even heard of a White Warrior.

81
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:42,337
Then why did my friend Tom
here see you all painted up

82
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:46,908
with your buddies, dancing
around Ridges' ashes?

83
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,211
Ashes?

84
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:51,146
Why are you even looking
for this Ridges guy

85
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:52,680
if he's not alive?

86
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,682
Let's call one of your
White Warrior friends

87
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:56,017
so he can explain it to you.

88
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:57,853
I know of the Bow String Warriors

89
00:04:57,854 --> 00:04:59,087
and the Kit Fox Warriors.

90
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:02,089
And the Golden State Warriors.

91
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,125
I don't know any White Warriors.

92
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:05,360
Where's Ridges?!

93
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:07,228
- I don't know!
- Like hell you don't.

94
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,365
Hey, if he knew anything, he
would have told you by now.

95
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:11,899
Hand me my thermos!

96
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,869
Now!

97
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,003
[grunting]

98
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:18,172
[breathing heavily]

99
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:29,182
Dad. What are you doing here?

100
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:31,885
Taking that vacation you suggested.

101
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:34,388
So, did you get through
all the discovery yet?

102
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,690
Let us discuss this in my office...

103
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:39,059
So we can speak in private.

104
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,131
Cady: Basically, their entire case

105
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:48,801
hinges on Miller Beck's teeth
being in Henry's possession.

106
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,080
But if we find Hector,

107
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,804
he can testify how Henry
actually got the teeth.

108
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:53,906
So I think we need to get
Hector's face out there,

109
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:55,908
put up some "wanted" fliers.

110
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,643
If we want people to talk about Hector,

111
00:05:57,644 --> 00:05:58,711
we need to offer a reward.

112
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:00,646
With whose money?

113
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:02,981
Everyone's.

114
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:05,651
We still have all the money
donated for Henry's bail fund.

115
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:06,918
And my bail has been paid for,

116
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,620
so that money should be returned.

117
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:10,121
Henry, these people want to help you.

118
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:12,357
That doesn't just stop
because you're out on bail.

119
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:14,292
Plus, Omar and Ruby have
already offered to pitch in.

120
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:16,513
I still have some money
set aside from the cabin.

121
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:26,705
I did not ask to be the object of charity.

122
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:31,375
I didn't ask you to keep
self-incriminating evidence.

123
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:34,044
But here we are.

124
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,377
So...

125
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:51,328
What do you propose?

126
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,030
We pull together a reward
for locating Hector.

127
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,632
Now, it doesn't hurt to get people talking.

128
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,802
While you two look for Hector,
I'm gonna track down some men

129
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:02,072
that may have actually killed Miller Beck.

130
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:03,706
If we go with my theory

131
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:07,177
that Martha's death
wasn't a random mugging...

132
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:12,220
...That would mean

133
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:14,116
someone actually paid
Miller Beck to kill her.

134
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:17,920
And then killed Miller
Beck to cover any tracks.

135
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:19,321
Who are they?

136
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:22,858
Murderers, drug dealers,

137
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,327
and sociopaths I've arrested,

138
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:29,932
Each one a little smarter and
more ruthless than the next.

139
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:32,768
Every one of those three
men was out of prison

140
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,204
at the time of your mom's murder.

141
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,140
And I'm gonna pay each of them a visit,

142
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:41,776
see if they have connections
to Denver or Miller Beck.

143
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,077
Wait. You mean you're going alone?

144
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:44,612
Well, if something happens to me,

145
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,280
We know who our chief suspects are.

146
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,284
[door slams]

147
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:55,790
Travis: What are we doing?

148
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,358
Branch: What's wrong, you scared?

149
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,226
You could have bailed out at any time.

150
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:00,795
Man, I-I didn't even
know what you were doing.

151
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:02,384
When you grabbed that guy, for all I knew,

152
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:04,498
A bunch of Cheyenne drug
dealers were gonna come after us

153
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:06,700
with uzis a-and tomahawks.

154
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:09,036
And then I realized you
were taking him hostage.

155
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:10,805
I just wanted to make sure

156
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:12,973
that, you know, you didn't
screw up your entire life.

157
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:15,008
By what?

158
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,176
Killing him?

159
00:08:16,177 --> 00:08:18,611
How crazy you think I am?

160
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,583
Look. I'm not gonna screw up my life.

161
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,217
Yeah, I thought the same thing

162
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:26,786
when I pulled that gun on you.

163
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:27,954
Now look at me.

164
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,322
That's the thing.

165
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,190
Guys like you get caught.

166
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,460
Guys like me don't.

167
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,334
[Sam groans]

168
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:46,271
Let me out! Let me out!

169
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:48,073
[grunting]

170
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:54,888
It tastes like... purple in here.

171
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:56,129
What the hell did you give him?

172
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,282
Peyote tea.

173
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:00,985
He'll still be hallucinating
by the time they find him.

174
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:03,187
So no one will believe
a damn thing he says.

175
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:05,089
Walk him up.

176
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:09,093
[grunting]

177
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:15,800
Are we... are we just gonna
leave him out here alone?

178
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:18,602
I'm sure the spirits will
take good care of him.

179
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:20,837
Okay.

180
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:23,572
Calm down. I got you.

181
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:28,077
[gasping]

182
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:35,819
They say...

183
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,156
They cracked you open for real this time.

184
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:46,128
Now you can let all that dark stuff out.

185
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:55,270
[vomiting]

186
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:41,029
[gunshot]

187
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:45,010
You're violating the
castle doctrine, Sheriff.

188
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,240
Castle doctrine doesn't apply
if I'm in your yard, Chance.

189
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,342
You just passed through my front door

190
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,245
and you entered my home's zoned perimeter,

191
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:55,181
which means we are both
standing within my domicile

192
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:58,187
and I'm legally entitled
to stand my ground.

193
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:59,689
Isn't that right, Sheriff?

194
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,957
Unless you got a warrant.

195
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,725
I'm just here to talk.

196
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:04,293
You have a gun?

197
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:07,096
- Yep.
- Then I feel threatened.

198
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:09,198
This isn't necessary.

199
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,867
The last time you came around,

200
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,369
you shot and killed my baby brother,

201
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,238
Tried to put me away for murder, right?

202
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,307
I'm sanctioned by the constitution

203
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:21,409
to put a bullet in your head.

204
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,112
I'll just step outside.

205
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:35,056
You knew a man named Miller Beck.

206
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:36,824
I'm under no legal obligation

207
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:39,026
to answer any of your questions, Sheriff.

208
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:42,396
How about this car?

209
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:45,733
Expired Colorado plates. Is this yours?

210
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:48,402
Is that a threat to
dispossess me of my property?

211
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:49,803
So it is yours.

212
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:51,671
Wrong again.

213
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:56,976
Then you can't claim defense
of property if I take this.

214
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:09,121
That's the letter of the law.

215
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:22,801
<i>Ruby: He's gonna be in
everyone's sights now.</i>

216
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:25,838
I printed out about 100 of these.

217
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,974
And Newt Cunningham called
again about his missing hen.

218
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:34,011
Ah, yes. The case of the missing chicken.

219
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:41,986
[sighs] Where's Walt?

220
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:44,322
Taking a little R&R. I'm in charge.

221
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,124
Well, I need some help.

222
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,659
Someone on the Rez found a
Cheyenne man named Sam Poteet

223
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,161
tripping on peyote in their backyard.

224
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:51,795
Okay.

225
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:54,031
Sam claims he was abducted and drugged

226
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:56,299
by a couple bleach boys.

227
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,101
White guys.

228
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:01,305
Do these bleach boys got names?

229
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:04,041
Yeah. Tom and Jerry.

230
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,676
- [laughs]
- I know.

231
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:07,911
I called the hardware
store Sam Poteet works.

232
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,013
Turns out this is the
fourth shift he's missed

233
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:11,348
in the last two months.

234
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:13,050
So he's making up a
story about a kidnapping

235
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:14,184
to avoid getting fired?

236
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:16,153
That or he's just tripping.

237
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:18,722
Either way, I still got to follow up.

238
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:19,890
Okay.

239
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:24,394
Well, we got a binder...

240
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:28,631
with mugshots in it...

241
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,101
...that you can borrow.

242
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,904
Well, when this guy sobers up a little,

243
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:36,038
I'll have him take a look.

244
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:41,043
Ruby, I need you to run a
Colorado license plate number.

245
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:43,615
Baker, Charlie, Baker, 32, Charlie.

246
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:44,414
<i>Ruby: Okay.</i>

247
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:47,317
And, uh, any word back on
Malachi's parole hearing yet?

248
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:49,519
<i>Not yet.</i>

249
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:07,435
[trumpet playing "Dixie land"]

250
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:30,324
What do you want?

251
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:31,893
Walt: A favor.

252
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:32,961
I'm busy.

253
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:34,395
It's dangerous.

254
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:35,829
You might get shot.

255
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,499
I'm listening.

256
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:45,172
They keep pouring in.

257
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,641
I asked Ruby to send all
the reward-seekers here.

258
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,643
So that if they actually have seen Hector,

259
00:14:49,644 --> 00:14:51,344
you can help me question them.

260
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:53,247
And if they haven't, they
might still be thirsty.

261
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:55,748
I have lucked into a brilliant attorney.

262
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:57,083
How are the interviews going?

263
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:59,218
We might actually have
something. Come here.

264
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:04,857
Can you tell Henry what you told me?

265
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:06,292
Yeah.

266
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:09,262
So, I was hiking up near
summer pass by the caves.

267
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:10,696
I heard this rustling

268
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:12,765
and I figured it was just some animal.

269
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:14,066
But it was this Indian guy.

270
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,367
And it looked like he might have had a gun.

271
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:18,737
Can you give us a physical description?

272
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:22,107
Sure. Uh, he's pretty skinny,

273
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:25,143
about medium height, looked
like he had long hair.

274
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,682
Uh, that's not Hector?

275
00:15:29,683 --> 00:15:32,150
No, that is nearly his opposite.

276
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:33,685
Sorry.

277
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:38,223
Lucian: More.

278
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:40,292
More.

279
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:41,326
Whoa, that's good.

280
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,261
All right.

281
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:44,996
Hold that.

282
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,101
[knock on door]

283
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:51,136
Who is it?

284
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,237
Man: Pizza!

285
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:53,805
I didn't order no pizza.

286
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:56,941
I did. Let me handle it.

287
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:02,847
[sighs] No, not again.

288
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:04,582
Come on, Jamie.

289
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,718
This is Creeley Dorn.

290
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:09,460
I put him away for
manufacturing crystal meth

291
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:10,323
seven years ago.

292
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:11,283
He's been out for a while now.

293
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:13,486
You know where I can find him?

294
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:15,354
Uh, I have no idea.

295
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:18,224
Y-you know, I don't
deal with the hard stuff.

296
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:20,259
So, um, knowing any meth guys

297
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,461
would be categorically impossible.

298
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:25,342
Jamie, I'm not trying
to tie you to anything.

299
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,166
Walt, why you trying
to pussyfoot around it?

300
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,335
This is your snitch boy. Get to snitching.

301
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,037
[sighs] Okay.

302
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:35,374
Uh, but... but I need
you both to recognize,

303
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,276
if I do know where this guy is,

304
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:39,877
it's only because I
delivered pizzas to him,

305
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:43,180
w-which is what I do for a living.

306
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:50,121
Okay. I might know where to find him.

307
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:54,692
But he doesn't really
look like this anymore.

308
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:01,595
I am off to investigate a stolen chicken.

309
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:04,565
If I don't make it back, tell
my husband that I love him.

310
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:08,035
Looks like my kidnap victim
is doubling down on his story.

311
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:10,037
He I.D.'d one of his abductors.

312
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:11,605
Which one?

313
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,273
This guy.

314
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:14,875
Travis.

315
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:16,944
Better get some info on
him and go have a talk.

316
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:19,145
No, I know this jackass.

317
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,348
I'll handle it for you.

318
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:24,150
- Okay.
- Yeah.

319
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:25,952
[sighs]

320
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,852
What the hell they
making? Christmas cookies?

321
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:03,154
Walt: I don't know, but I
don't like the look of it.

322
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:06,224
I'm looking for Creeley Dorn.

323
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,625
You know him?

324
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,360
You recognize his face?

325
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:11,496
Rome is burning!

326
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,799
Dónde está?

327
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:18,535
Rome is burning.

328
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:20,237
What's that? Some kind of code?

329
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,772
Or an alarm. Check that corner.

330
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:27,878
Hey, Walt, it's a damn security camera.

331
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:29,580
Creeley's not in here!

332
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:32,316
[engine turns over]

333
00:18:36,454 --> 00:18:38,154
- Windshield?
- Tires.

334
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:39,555
Softie!

335
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:51,768
Come on, Creeley.

336
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,103
You got a key?

337
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:55,438
You got a warrant?

338
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:56,805
Lucian: Fore!

339
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:07,515
Have a seat.

340
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:14,323
Possession with intent to distribute, Walt.

341
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:15,891
We got him dead to rights.

342
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:18,745
Looks like prison didn't
do you much good, Creeley.

343
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:21,896
Actually, prison was
just the break I needed.

344
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:23,264
Big leagues at last.

345
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:26,634
You know I was the best
damn cook in that joint?

346
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:29,303
[scoffs] We're all proud of you.

347
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:30,472
What are you cooking these days?

348
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:32,507
Not a damn thing.

349
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,342
Cooking's dangerous business.

350
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:36,209
I moved myself up to management.

351
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,479
So what are they cooking? More gutter meth?

352
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,214
Nah. Meth's old news.

353
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:42,516
That's cheese heroin.

354
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:45,018
You never even heard of it, have you?

355
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:50,090
Heroin, sleeping pills, a
little strawberry flavoring.

356
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:52,158
The after-school set loves it.

357
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:54,761
Yeah, my little cheese bags
are blowing up everywhere.

358
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,662
You still have delusions of grandeur.

359
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,097
Yeah?

360
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:00,566
Drive out to Salt Lake or Denver.

361
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,001
Tell me what you find.

362
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,335
Let's start with Denver.

363
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,538
You know this man?

364
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,640
Miller Beck?

365
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:10,242
Nah.

366
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,012
I don't fraternize with customers.

367
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:15,814
How'd you know he was a customer?

368
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,486
Homeboy looks like the type.

369
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:21,920
What'd he do?

370
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,189
Walt: He died.

371
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,990
I'm trying to find out who killed him.

372
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,359
[chuckles] What, you think I did it?

373
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,693
I think you're capable.

374
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,996
The two witnesses who testified against you

375
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,259
both showed up dead two
weeks after you were released.

376
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,365
Come on, Sheriff.

377
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:40,271
Lex O.D.'d and P-Magnet,
he... he died in a car crash.

378
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,240
At least, that's what I hear.

379
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,442
Besides, you're the one who arrested me.

380
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,011
Wouldn't that put you at
the top of my bucket list?

381
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,613
Maybe I was.

382
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:52,850
Maybe you sent Miller Beck
to kill my wife instead of me.

383
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,520
Come on.

384
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,156
Stand up.

385
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,590
[handcuffs click]

386
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:02,526
<i>Woman: What happened? Is there trouble?</i>

387
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,161
I just need to speak with Travis.

388
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,995
Oh, no, no, no, no. Travis is sleeping.

389
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:08,098
Ma'am, this is official police business.

390
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,200
And this is mothering business.

391
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:12,335
And you're doing an awesome job.

392
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:14,171
He needs his rest!

393
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,605
Okay.

394
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:20,009
Morning, sunshine.

395
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,951
So, which one are you? Tom or Jerry?

396
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:22,609
Travis: Huh?

397
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,313
Don't you lay a hand on my son.

398
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:26,415
Would you please close the door?

399
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,622
God. Now, what's going on?

400
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:34,925
Did you really abduct a Cheyenne man

401
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,594
and force him to take peyote?

402
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,362
'Cause there's a man named Sam Poteet

403
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,897
who identified you from your mugshot.

404
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,732
O-okay. Wait, wait.

405
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:45,302
You're saying that... that some Indian guy

406
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,471
got high on peyote and picked
my mugshot out at random?

407
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,272
That... that's why you're busting in here?

408
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:50,641
Can you tell me where you were?

409
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,709
- Travis.
- Mom!

410
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,810
Did she hurt you?

411
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,545
What are you doing?!

412
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,069
When a uniformed officer
breaks into my house

413
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,383
to harass my undressed
child, I document it.

414
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,519
Ma'am, this is totally unnecessary.

415
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,588
- Identify your badge number.
- Can you just...

416
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:09,325
[gasps] I captured that. I got it.

417
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:10,860
Okay. Stop. Look.

418
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:13,696
Maybe, uh, maybe the two of
us can go down to the station

419
00:22:13,697 --> 00:22:15,474
- and just talk about this.
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:17,127
Would you two just give
me a second, please,

421
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,130
To get dressed, or do you
want to film that, too?

422
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:23,205
I will not apologize
for protecting my child.

423
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,332
So, you're saying that you saw Hector

424
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,511
steal how many pineapples?

425
00:22:41,512 --> 00:22:43,647
Approximately four.

426
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:46,024
Chapman: Arnie, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

427
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:48,798
Selling out Hector to these
people for a little big of cash!

428
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,460
Miss Chapman, I just... leave! Leave!

429
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:54,839
Can I help you?

430
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,409
Yes, you can. Stop the search.

431
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,011
Hector is a good man.

432
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,147
Who are you to put his
face on a "wanted" poster?

433
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:03,572
What do you even know about him?

434
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:05,785
I know that he beats people up for money.

435
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,311
Because sometimes

436
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:09,356
that's the only way justice can be served.

437
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:11,425
Vigilantism isn't justice.

438
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:13,759
Sometimes on the Rez, that's all you get.

439
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:17,397
Do you remember, Standing Bear,

440
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:23,303
when that young Cheyenne woman
was raped by those two men?

441
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:26,439
Yes. I remember.

442
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,774
But I'll bet you don't.

443
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:33,613
This young woman went to the
police chief, Malachi Strand,

444
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:35,082
to report the rape.

445
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,417
But everyone knows that Malachi

446
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:40,687
only investigates crimes if you pay him.

447
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,660
So the young woman dug up
every penny she could find.

448
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:49,663
Malachi took the money
and found the two men.

449
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:52,432
Do you remember what happened next?

450
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:54,201
Yes.

451
00:23:54,202 --> 00:23:57,036
Nothing.

452
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:59,105
That's right. Nothing.

453
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:03,176
Because the two rapists
paid Malachi even more money

454
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:04,644
to drop the charges.

455
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,813
That was it.

456
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:10,250
Until Hector found out about it.

457
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,485
And he tracked those two rapists down

458
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:14,420
and he beat them unconscious.

459
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:17,090
Then he dragged them to
that young woman's house

460
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:19,397
so she could know that
justice could be done

461
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:21,863
even on the Rez.

462
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:26,265
I had no idea.

463
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,601
The Rez needs Hector.

464
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:31,004
Don't take him from us.

465
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:35,641
[clears throat]

466
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,745
Adele, we do not want
to put Hector in jail.

467
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:40,146
I know back then

468
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,615
he was the only one willing to help you.

469
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:47,819
<i>Right now, he might be the
only one who can help me.</i>

470
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,002
[sighs]

471
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:08,349
I thought Martha died of cancer, Walt.

472
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:11,876
You never told me she was murdered.

473
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,417
So you think this here Miller Beck

474
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,286
you've been talking about from Denver,

475
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,421
this here junkie scum killed her?

476
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,591
Yep.

477
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,160
Now Denver's saying

478
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:30,228
that Henry killed Miller Beck in revenge?

479
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:32,931
[sighs] Yep.

480
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,499
So, what really happened?

481
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,405
Well, I think someone
with a grudge against me...

482
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,342
...paid Miller Beck to murder Martha

483
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,610
and killed Miller Beck

484
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,412
after I started getting too close.

485
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,630
And you think one of these
here jokers is behind it all?

486
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:51,817
Well, that's the theory.

487
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:54,787
Creeley Dorn, his drug distribution

488
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:57,590
stretches all the way to Denver.

489
00:25:57,591 --> 00:26:02,128
Chance Gilbert, he still has
his younger brother's car,

490
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:05,698
which is registered in Colorado.

491
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:11,337
What do you think?

492
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:15,241
I think that...

493
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:18,678
I am sorry for your loss, Walt.

494
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,614
[sighs]

495
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:24,183
I never said that to you and I should have.

496
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:29,588
Martha was... irreplaceable.

497
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,927
Thanks.

498
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:39,031
I made a pass at her once.

499
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,670
She told me it was twice.

500
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:48,241
Really?

501
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:51,143
I believe I was a bit inebriated.

502
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:54,146
I do miss our Christmas potlucks.

503
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:57,716
Yeah.

504
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,451
[sighs]

505
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,088
So, who's next?

506
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,690
Stanley Keene.

507
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:09,862
Stanley Keene.

508
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,435
Wasn't expecting to see you here.

509
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:18,738
Thought I'd finish up some paperwork

510
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:21,774
so I can hit the ground running tomorrow.

511
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:26,245
I'm been doing fine, by the way.

512
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,480
Thanks for visiting me in the hospital.

513
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,182
I don't do hospitals, nephew,

514
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:32,384
just like you don't do old folks' homes.

515
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,039
<i>Creeley: Where you taking me?</i>

516
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,588
Back to the big leagues.

517
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,391
Is that your chicken thief?

518
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,160
No. A Cheyenne guy claims

519
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,737
two white dudes kidnapped him
and forced him to take peyote.

520
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:45,647
Our friend Travis here was I.D.'d by him.

521
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:49,284
Travis... what's going on?

522
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:51,386
I mean, defaulting on your home,

523
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:53,621
That's one thing, but kidnapping?

524
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,557
When did this happen?

525
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,358
- Last night.
- Really?

526
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,593
Well, then it can't be Travis

527
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,261
'cause he was hanging out with me.

528
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,601
He pulled a gun on you last year.

529
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,003
Yeah.

530
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:10,371
And we got drinks at
the Red Pony last night.

531
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:11,773
To bury the hatchet.

532
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,042
I had a few too many, Travis drove me home.

533
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:15,711
Bigger fish, Walt.

534
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:17,779
Vic: Why didn't you just tell
me this in the first place?

535
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,581
I just wanted to get us out of that house.

536
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:21,283
Can you blame me?

537
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,517
So did he resist arrest?

538
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:23,785
- No.
- No.

539
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,753
[chuckles] Not this time.

540
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:28,322
Then I guess that's it.

541
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,236
I'm on my way out, and I owe Travis a ride.

542
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:43,605
[sighs]

543
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:48,710
Want me to call Mathias,

544
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:51,412
tell him that his suspect has an alibi?

545
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:52,547
No, I can do it.

546
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:54,916
Easy enough.

547
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:56,851
Let's go.

548
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:12,544
It's so good to see you again, Walt.

549
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:18,884
Stanley, I wanted to ask

550
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:23,622
if you knew this man... Miller Beck.

551
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:30,061
Doesn't ring a bell.

552
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,267
So, this is business, then?

553
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:38,603
I thought maybe you might
want to talk about Martha.

554
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:41,740
What about her?

555
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:44,409
I heard she was killed.
Why didn't you tell me?

556
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,845
How did you know about my wife's murder?

557
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:49,214
I'm in jail, Walt.

558
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:52,551
Not on some other planet.

559
00:29:52,552 --> 00:29:56,054
I'm profoundly sorry. I...

560
00:29:57,957 --> 00:30:00,792
I know the pain you must be in.

561
00:30:02,294 --> 00:30:06,365
I was so heartbroken when Rebecca passed.

562
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:10,669
It's an unbearable thing
to lose a soul mate.

563
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,938
Rebecca Pound was not your soul mate.

564
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:18,476
She was a woman you stalked and assaulted.

565
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:21,846
And I did my time for that.

566
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:25,282
And finally, the moment I'm released,

567
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,151
Who's there to meet me at the gate?

568
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:30,421
Not her. You.

569
00:30:30,422 --> 00:30:33,290
With a restraining order?

570
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,760
Telling me I can never go near her again?

571
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:38,796
Never see her again?

572
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:42,367
But you were wrong about that one, Walt.

573
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:44,335
There's no denying true love.

574
00:30:44,336 --> 00:30:49,474
You tracked Rebecca down
to Laramie, murdered her,

575
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:53,611
And spread her body parts
across four different counties.

576
00:30:53,612 --> 00:30:56,146
Because you gave me no choice.

577
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,681
You made Rebecca believe

578
00:30:57,682 --> 00:31:00,384
that our love was this filthy thing.

579
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:03,654
Rebecca would have been so happy with me!

580
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:06,557
We'd be together now if it weren't for you!

581
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:09,059
If it weren't for you!

582
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,295
If it weren't for you!

583
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:19,903
Hey. Any luck finding Hector?

584
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:22,405
According to today's eyewitness accounts,

585
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:23,740
we should be able to locate Hector

586
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:25,641
in three different campgrounds,

587
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:27,410
one stolen dune buggy...

588
00:31:27,411 --> 00:31:30,146
and a produce dumpster
at the Piggly Wiggly.

589
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:31,514
Well, I will take that to Walt

590
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,250
and see if there's something he can use.

591
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,485
Henry, can I ask you something?

592
00:31:39,257 --> 00:31:41,057
Branch come here with this guy last night?

593
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:42,191
He did.

594
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,393
They close the place down?

595
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:46,062
No, I believe they had one drink apiece

596
00:31:46,063 --> 00:31:49,498
and left by 7:00-ish.

597
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:52,702
Thanks.

598
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,107
[sighs]

599
00:31:58,108 --> 00:32:02,278
Did you ever feel you created
more evil than you stopped?

600
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:06,115
Well, I always figured it
was a neck-and-neck race.

601
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:09,819
You let your highest self rule
and your truest self grieve,

602
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,421
and the world will still strip away

603
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:15,358
all you ever hoped to achieve.

604
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,560
If you do the job right, Walt,

605
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,829
by the time you put down
your Sheriff's badge,

606
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,464
you're a wanted man.

607
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:25,067
I always figured that I'd
die by violence and die alone.

608
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,236
That's the price we pay for our ideals.

609
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:31,006
And I made my peace with that.

610
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,009
What I didn't make my peace with

611
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,378
everyone around me paying for those ideals.

612
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:42,517
[crowd cheering on TV]

613
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:49,584
You Wyoming people and your unlocked doors.

614
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:51,351
- What the hell are you doing?
- Why didn't you just tell me

615
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:53,395
right off the bat that
you were with Branch?

616
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:54,963
I-I don't know.

617
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,499
'Cause I was hungover and
naked and then my mom...

618
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,702
I just, I needed a little room to breathe.

619
00:32:59,703 --> 00:33:01,069
That's all.

620
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,105
Besides, going down to the station meant

621
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,274
you and I could spend a
little more time together.

622
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,975
It must have been some hangover.

623
00:33:06,976 --> 00:33:08,944
Just how drunk were you
when you drove Branch home?

624
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,279
[chuckles]

625
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,682
You can't arrest me for DUI after the fact.

626
00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:15,483
Can you?

627
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:17,019
No.

628
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,620
I was just curious how many cocktails

629
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,023
a couple of real cowboys
can throw back in one night.

630
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:22,891
- [scoffs]
- Double digits?

631
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:26,427
Let's just say it was a long fade to black.

632
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,997
That's interesting, Travis.

633
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:32,000
Because your bar tab at the Red Pony says

634
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:35,769
you each had one drink and
you left at a quarter to 7:00.

635
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,640
Which means that your alibi is shit.

636
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:41,342
What are you doing?

637
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:43,912
I'm taking you in on kidnapping charges.

638
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:45,613
[scoffs]

639
00:33:47,449 --> 00:33:49,884
Damn it. He was right.

640
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:52,552
Guys like me get caught
and guys like him don't.

641
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:54,421
Who was right? Branch?

642
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:55,990
Look.

643
00:33:55,991 --> 00:33:58,740
I didn't even know what was going on
at first. And then I just went along

644
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:00,381
to make sure that Branch
didn't kill that guy.

645
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:02,637
I've known Branch since we were kids

646
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:04,673
and he's a Connally so
he's always had a temper,

647
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:05,774
but I had no idea.

648
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:07,308
No idea what?

649
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:08,409
That he was psycho.

650
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,344
And now he's got a gun and a badge.

651
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:14,748
I mean, you got to do
something to stop him, right?

652
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:38,180
Branch: Missed me, didn't you?

653
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:42,447
Yeah. Everything ached.

654
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:51,327
Any luck narrowing down the suspect pool?

655
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:54,663
Not really. All three guys we talked to

656
00:34:54,664 --> 00:34:57,098
seemed more suspicious than before.

657
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,721
I'm running some
background checks right now.

658
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,272
Meantime, I'm catching up

659
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:04,143
on these, uh, reportings
of Hector sightings.

660
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,316
Something else?

661
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:20,159
What should I have done in Philly?

662
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,994
About what?

663
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:25,435
Bobby Donolato, the dirty
cop that I turned in.

664
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,515
Should I have just kept quiet?

665
00:35:31,137 --> 00:35:33,672
Has there been another
incident with Ed Gorski?

666
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,908
No. No.

667
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:38,711
Um... [sighs]

668
00:35:38,712 --> 00:35:40,778
Just look at all that's happened

669
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:42,781
since I turned Bobby in.

670
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:48,687
The I.A. investigation,
Bobby's own suicide,

671
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,656
Sean and I having to
move, Gorski stalking me...

672
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:53,692
None of it would have happened

673
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,446
if I'd just kept my mouth shut.

674
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,595
Maybe not.

675
00:35:56,596 --> 00:36:00,298
Or maybe you just stopped a
bad situation getting worse.

676
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,569
Doesn't matter.

677
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,706
It doesn't matter... why not?

678
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,075
I don't think you had a choice.

679
00:36:10,076 --> 00:36:12,977
Looking the other way and keeping quiet,

680
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:14,879
that's not who you are.

681
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,617
Did you check on that chicken?

682
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:23,087
Uh, no. The chicken, mmh-mmh.

683
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:25,756
It was stolen from Newt
Cunningham's farm, right?

684
00:36:25,757 --> 00:36:28,593
Stolen is the wrong word.

685
00:36:28,594 --> 00:36:31,495
Um, whoever took the
chicken left behind 20 bucks,

686
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:33,664
which is pretty much blue book value.

687
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:34,669
Sounds like Hector.

688
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,900
So you think Hector took the
chicken and left behind money?

689
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:40,671
It'd be in his character.
He's always followed a code.

690
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:42,973
Cady told me that, uh, a woman came in

691
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:44,975
begging her to stop the search.

692
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:47,044
Adele Chapman.

693
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:49,612
She lives here.

694
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:52,950
Why mark her house?

695
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:55,818
Who comes in and asks you to
stop looking for a wanted man?

696
00:36:55,819 --> 00:36:58,512
Someone who knows where he is.

697
00:36:58,513 --> 00:37:01,348
And both these locations are
close to the caves at summer pass,

698
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,493
where that hiker claimed he saw an Indian.

699
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:05,929
Well, yeah, but the hiker's description

700
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,365
didn't sound anything like Hector.

701
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:11,468
Long hair, thin build, medium height.

702
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:13,302
You know who this is, right?

703
00:37:17,774 --> 00:37:19,641
It's David Ridges.

704
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:21,810
You admitted it yourself, Walt.

705
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:23,879
There's a chance he could still be alive.

706
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,915
I don't think it's Hector hiding up there.

707
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:29,050
I think it's Ridges.

708
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:32,087
There's only one way to find out.

709
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:39,562
Malachi: Such a fine feeling being free.

710
00:37:39,563 --> 00:37:41,229
Ain't that right, Hank?

711
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,565
Sort of a blessing.

712
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:46,568
You just come and go as you please.

713
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:47,602
[chuckles]

714
00:37:47,603 --> 00:37:51,072
Well, some of us, anyway.

715
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:56,010
What do you imagine you are doing?

716
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,781
Ahh. To sweet freedom.

717
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:04,318
Ahh.

718
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:06,854
[sniffs]

719
00:38:06,855 --> 00:38:09,996
Hey. Thanks for holding my seat.

720
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:15,062
[sighs]

721
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:20,201
The Brotherhood, Hank.

722
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:22,101
It wears many faces.

723
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:26,720
You have not even served
half of your sentence.

724
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,142
How can you be out on parole?

725
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:30,277
I guess the word of Walter Longmire

726
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:33,511
doesn't hold the same sway that it used to.

727
00:38:33,655 --> 00:38:35,315
Funny how things work out.

728
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:38,618
I'm free, you're going back inside.

729
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,555
Times be a-changing.

730
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:47,260
Why, Hank.

731
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:50,630
Why in the world

732
00:38:50,631 --> 00:38:54,734
would you put this noble
specimen up for sale?

733
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:57,570
It's not because of money troubles, I hope.

734
00:38:57,571 --> 00:39:00,899
[chuckles] Now that I think of it,

735
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,208
you're gonna have to sell this place

736
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,144
before you go back inside.

737
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:07,131
You know, maybe it'd be better

738
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:10,887
if you keep it with your
people, your brothers.

739
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:12,304
We are not brothers.

740
00:39:12,305 --> 00:39:14,707
Oh, lighten up, Hank.

741
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:18,310
We'll talk about it when the time comes.

742
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:21,313
In the meantime, I'll go ahead

743
00:39:21,314 --> 00:39:23,983
and take these stuffed
critters off your hands.

744
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:28,520
This ought to add some color to my study.

745
00:39:30,656 --> 00:39:33,891
I'll have the boys come by
and pick up the rest later.

746
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:01,886
I'm not getting shot again.

747
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:03,288
I need Hector alive.

748
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:04,856
What if it's not Hector?

749
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:06,991
Then I need David Ridges alive.

750
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,294
Walt, blood.

751
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,611
Hector!

752
00:40:28,612 --> 00:40:30,789
Hector: You're too late, law man.

753
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,520
What the hell happened to his head?

754
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:34,217
He's been scalped.

755
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:39,122
I was outside the cave when he shot me.

756
00:40:39,123 --> 00:40:42,859
One in the chest, two in the legs.

757
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,696
I dragged myself back in here.

758
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:50,533
But the snake followed me in.

759
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:53,236
Who's the snake?

760
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,575
Was it him?

761
00:40:58,576 --> 00:41:00,677
Yes.

762
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:03,613
That is the snake who killed me.

763
00:41:03,614 --> 00:41:06,015
Why would David Ridges come after you?

764
00:41:06,016 --> 00:41:08,851
I don't know.

765
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:10,953
Doesn't matter.

766
00:41:10,954 --> 00:41:14,490
If it wasn't him, it'd be someone else.

767
00:41:14,491 --> 00:41:17,693
It was always going to end like this.

768
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:24,700
I always wanted to die
as a warrior, law man,

769
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:30,205
under the big sky, on my people's land.

770
00:41:31,508 --> 00:41:37,049
Not in some cave like an animal.

771
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,219
Come on.

772
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:11,279
This is between me and my ancestors now.

773
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:36,563
<i>A good man is dead because of me.</i>

774
00:42:36,564 --> 00:42:38,430
<i>I need to take matters into my own hands.</i>

775
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,521
Where are you?

776
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:42,218
There was something urgent
I needed to take care of.

777
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:44,607
Think I'm losing it.

778
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:47,521
<i>This is about me trying
to find the man who shot me</i>

779
00:42:47,522 --> 00:42:49,662
and maybe coming back for me.

780
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,033
Found Hector, shot and scalped.

781
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:54,393
- Sorry to hear that.
- You're lying.

782
00:42:54,394 --> 00:42:56,943
Maybe you're not thinking
so clearly either.

783
