# King of the Wild Frontier

5
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:17,853
# Born on a mountaintop in Tennessee

# Greenest state in the land of the free

00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:24,124
# Raised in the woods
So's he knew every tree

00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:27,223
# Killed him a bear
When he was only three

# In 1813, the Creeks uprose

# Addin' redskin arrows

00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:43,239
# Now old Andrew Jackson

00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:46,911
# Is the general they sent
To fight the foes #

15
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:49,547
[Jackson] Major. Major Norton.

16
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,521
- Yes, sir?
- Where's that scout I told you to find?

17
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,623
They say the best man is one
of the volunteers, Crockett.

18
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,636
- Where is he?
- Matter of fact, he's out hunting.

19
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:07,798
- Hunting?
- We need food. He's across the river.

20
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:12,334
That's enemy territory.
What you're short on is brains, not rations.

21
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:16,371
- He didn't take a gun, sir.
- I want this Crockett fellow now.

22
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:18,815
- Fetch him.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,554
[Norton] Crockett.

24
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,952
Crockett.

25
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:32,089
Davy Crockett.

26
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:34,190
Where's Crockett?

27
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,132
Speak up, man.

28
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,566
Where is he?

29
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:45,503
- [Growling]
- What's he doing in there?

30
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:49,175
He's tryin' to grin down a bear.

31
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,182
Grin down a...

32
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:55,779
You backwoods buffoons think
the rest of us'll believe anything.

33
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:58,586
Crockett. Crockett, can't you hear me?

34
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,057
[Growling]

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,219
Come out of there.
I've got a message...

36
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:04,797
- [growling]
- [Grunting]

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,468
You sure spoiled things good.

38
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:12,004
Now I gotta do it the old-fashioned way.

39
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:14,867
Yee-haw. Give him what for, Davy.

40
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,568
[Crockett grunting]

41
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,916
Stick with him, Davy.

42
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,113
[Growling]

43
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:41,598
Now, Major, what was it
you wanted to see me about?

44
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,931
[Panting] General Jackson
wants to see you.

45
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:49,101
As soon as we get that bear pulled up.
It's a fair-to-middlin' size critter.

46
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:53,108
[Cheering, indistinct chatter]

47
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,375
Full bellies tonight, boys.

48
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:04,317
- I hear you want to see me, General.
- That's right. Come inside.

49
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,556
Now, how'd you kill that brute?

50
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,998
With my knife.
I was figurin' on grinnin' him to death,

51
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:17,161
but this stumble-footed major
busted my concentratin'.

52
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:20,297
Grinnin' him to death?
What in thunderation is that?

53
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,864
It's somethin' I've been
experimentin' with.

54
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:26,071
You see, there's nothin'
so absolutely unresistable

55
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:29,706
as an old-fashioned,
good-natured grin, like this.

56
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,144
I started on 'coons.
I got so good at it,

57
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,314
an old 'coon throwed up his hands
the minute he seen my teeth.

58
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:40,120
"You got me," he hollered
and he skinned down that tree

59
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,160
and plopped himself in my sack.

60
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:46,528
I figured the same thing ought to work on
bears, but I never got a chance to find out.

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,592
The major come along
and busted up my concentratin'.

62
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,695
I wound up havin' to wrestle
this critter into table meat.

63
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:56,503
- Why was you hankerin' to see me?
- We're on the edge of enemy territory.

64
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:59,511
I want a scouting party to see
what them redskins is up to.

65
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:03,208
Major Norton and a squad of regulars
will accompany ya.

66
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,444
That wouldn't make the chore no easier.

67
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:08,214
Be sure the major brings back
the information I want.

68
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,483
Come on, Major.

69
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:36,878
Some of your boys rode water pretty deep.
Better look to their powder.

70
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,941
Re-prime your pieces.

71
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,113
From here on, don't make
no more noise. No talkin'.

72
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:45,316
Everybody keep close up.

73
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,692
Better stick closer to us, Major.

74
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:31,533
You've led us through swamps,
canebrakes, and briar patches all day.

75
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:34,266
I see a trail and
there's no sense in not taking it.

76
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,831
Has the general got your wife's address?

77
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,845
Take that trail and he's apt
to write her a sad letter.

78
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:43,440
We're here to locate Indians and
I don't like the way you're doing it.

79
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:46,713
We'll cover more ground if we separate.
I'll take that trail.

80
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:50,017
We'll be back here in this clearing
by dawn. See that you are.

81
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,288
Better fix up a signal to identify ourselves.
Can you do an old hoot owl?

82
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,850
Certainly.

83
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,160
[Hooting weakly]

84
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:02,330
That ought to fool the redskins just dandy.

85
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:03,801
[Laughing]

86
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,941
Come on.

87
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,156
[Davy] War party, a big one.

88
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:35,257
Here comes another bunch.
Head for cover.

89
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,991
[Speaking native language]

90
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,492
- That was Red Stick.
- What makes you so sure?

91
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,698
Creeks only got one young chief.
Gotta be him.

92
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,875
Let's leave the horses here.

93
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:30,511
[Chanting]

94
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:33,387
[Chanting, drums beating]

95
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:38,261
Looks like Red Stick's finally
talked the tribe into listening.

96
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:42,296
I don't know what he said,
but I sure don't like it.

97
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:44,393
I hope they keep that up a spell longer.

98
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,166
[Shouting, chanting]

99
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:51,337
We'd better get back to the major fast.

100
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,610
[Hooting]

101
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:09,718
[Hooting]

102
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,735
[Gunshots]

103
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:35,717
Everybody take cover.
Take cover, men.

104
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:54,764
Sounds like the major
got himself in trouble.

105
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,036
- And we'll have to get him out.
- How?

106
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,670
- Surround 'em.
- Think there's enough of us?

107
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:02,544
We'll give 'em the ol' Crockett charge.

108
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:11,089
- [Crockett] Brigade, halt.
- [Russel] Company, halt.

109
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:14,558
Brigade... charge.

110
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:16,753
Company... charge.

111
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,297
It's the general and the whole regiment.

112
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,560
[Cheering]

113
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:24,159
All together now. Fire at will.

114
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,762
Charge. Yee-haw.

115
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,209
Advance on the line of skirmish.

116
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:35,543
Dragoons, dismount.

117
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:40,148
[Russel] Yippee. Yee-haw.

118
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:42,653
We got 'em on the run, men.

119
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,488
Company B, close up.

120
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,456
[Indistinct shouting]

121
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,289
Charge.

122
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,960
Charge.

123
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:57,461
[Russel shouting]

124
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,382
Company A reportin'.

125
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:15,586
[Russel] Here's the rest of us, Major.

126
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:18,488
Company B reportin'.

127
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,988
- You mean, just two of ya?
- Two was enough, wasn't it?

128
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:28,466
- These varmints were just a little party.
- The Creek nation is gatherin'.

129
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:32,470
Take care of your casualties.
We'll get the news to the general.

130
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:52,089
The general's expectin' me.

131
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:56,852
- Sorry to disturb you, General.
- Never mind. What did you find out?

132
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,830
They aim to fight.
They had a big war dance last night.

133
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,357
- Where?
- Back in the mountain.

134
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:04,698
Red Stick, sir.

135
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,968
Red Stick? I'd sure like
to get my hooks on him.

136
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,033
We gotta move fast.
He's whippin' 'em up quick.

137
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,045
- Where's Major Norton?
- He had a little trouble.

138
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,445
Sentry.
What kind of trouble?

139
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:18,746
- Injun trouble, lost some men.
- Yes, sir?

140
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:21,844
Tell the sergeant major to order
the camp struck.

141
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,883
- Lookouts are accounted for.
- Good.

142
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,766
When we catch Red Stick,
this war will be over.

143
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:13,033
There's only two ways he can escape.
I got him stoppered.

144
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:18,237
As soon as the regulars are in position,
jump in and stir up them red hornets.

145
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,485
[Yelling]

146
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:12,622
Give it to 'em, boys.

147
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,200
[Gunshots]

148
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:55,067
Fire and fall back.

149
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,330
[Shouting]

150
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,878
Fire.

151
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,437
Sound assembly.

152
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,804
[Bugle]

153
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:13,245
I reckon Red Stick's tomahawk's
got an awful nick in it.

154
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:17,683
- Got away, didn't he?
- Yeah, but a lot of 'em didn't.

155
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:20,521
Much obliged for savin' my scalp.

156
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:23,824
Mrs. Crockett might have
a kiss for ya when we get home.

157
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:29,824
- [Man #1] Feelin' better, boy?
- [Man #2] I'll make it.

158
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:35,470
- Don't call it a victory around me.
- Their casualties were enormous.

159
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:39,307
We captured three chiefs and they
want to discuss terms for a peace.

160
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:40,811
- Peace?
- Excuse me.

161
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,714
- What do you want?
- Dropped in to say good-bye.

162
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:47,252
Good-bye?
Where do you think you're goin'?

163
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,878
Home.

164
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:52,583
You're going after Red Stick
with the rest of my command.

165
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:55,456
We ain't quittin' the war.
We'll be back.

166
00:16:55,528 --> 00:17:00,090
You see, General, we only volunteered
for 60 days and that's long since up.

167
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,101
Catchin' Red Stick could take
the rest of the year.

168
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,935
We gotta take care of our families
before we start anything like that.

169
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:09,531
You're confined to this camp.
That's an order.

170
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:14,469
My missus'd worry about me.
Sorry, General.

171
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:17,846
If he leaves, it'll destroy
the discipline of the whole camp.

172
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:21,978
- He's attached to your command, Major.
- Then I'm gonna stop him.

173
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:34,160
Halt.

174
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:44,669
- I'm warning you. Turn back.
- You know we're goin' home.

175
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:48,071
Prepare to fire.

176
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,050
Careful, don't burn yourself.

177
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,719
Bring us some bear meat
when you come, Davy.

178
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:05,286
Sure. Anything you want, Major?

179
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,628
Blamedest bunch of volunteers
I ever saw.

180
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,964
When they volunteer to fight,
they fight.

181
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:13,732
When they volunteer to go home,
they go home.

Hey, Ma. Pa's back.

185
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:27,881
Davy, you're back.

186
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:30,444
- Hello, Pa.
- Hi, Pa.

187
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,182
Whee.

188
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:49,207
Well, reckon now's as good a time
as any to collect what I got comin'.

189
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:54,644
Georgie Russel, what happened to you
while you been gone?

190
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:57,807
Davy allowed as how I had a kiss comin'
for savin' his life.

191
00:18:57,883 --> 00:19:02,183
- He sure did.
- Well, in that case.

192
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:09,290
You ain't never gonna
get a woman that way.

193
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:11,522
Reckon I gotta learn ya how.

194
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:17,925
Missed ya an awful lot.

195
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:20,437
Missed you too.

196
00:19:21,774 --> 00:19:24,641
The young'uns like
to pester me to death.

197
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,443
Not a mornin' passed they haven't said,
"Maybe Pa'll be home today."

198
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:33,884
But now, thank the good Lord
you're home for good.

199
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:37,411
Well, not perzactly.
The war ain't quite over yet.

200
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,721
- You goin' back?
- Well, not for a few days.

201
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:44,456
Not 'til I get in a supply of meat
for you and the young'uns this winter.

202
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,863
- You gonna be gone all winter?
- Well, I hope not.

203
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,801
- But I don't know how long it's gonna be.
- Oh, Davy.

204
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:58,205
Now don't take on. I had enough trouble
with the Army over me comin' home.

205
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:02,077
My major and I didn't see quite
eye to eye on it.

206
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:06,015
But I figured I was right.
And you know me.

207
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:09,020
When I'm sure I'm right, I go ahead.

208
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,889
# Headed back to war
From the ol' home place

209

214
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:36,112
- Halt. Who goes there?
- Just us, me and Davy.

215
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:38,809
How the devil did you find us
way off down here?

216
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:43,048
You left a good trail: Army gear,
lame horses, sick men all the way.

217
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,558
- That's us, all right.
- Reckon we better report to the general.

218
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:50,322
General Jackson ain't here.
He done been called to New Orleans.

219
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:52,796
- Who's in command?
- Major Norton.

220
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:55,231
If I'd knowed that,
I wouldn't have come back.

221
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:56,768
Let's get it over with.

222
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,336
I have to admit I'm glad
to see you, Crockett.

223
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:02,397
You too, Russel.

224
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:06,069
I'm at my wit's end.
Most of my men have swamp fever.

225
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:07,908
I got a touch of it, too.

226
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,039
Still chasin' Red Stick?

227
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:12,481
It's a question of who's chasing who.

228
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:15,748
Every patrol I've sent out
has failed to come back.

229

He can't have many warriors left.

230
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:22,526
If we could just locate them, but they
can hide forever in this infernal swamp.

231
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:26,190
Me and Russel are rested up a mite.
It's only fair we take a cut at it.

232
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,666
No, no, that Indian has cost us
enough lives already.

233
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:34,035
I refuse to let you two go out alone.

234
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:37,735
Looks like we'll have to start
disobeyin' orders again.

Baby 'gators.
Kinda cute, ain't they?

236
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,782
I'm more scared of snakes and 'gators
than I am of Injuns.

237
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,902
Two days old, maybe more.

Headin' around the lake.

meet at the other end?

- Hunter? You hunt Indians.

252

253

Your chiefs, the smart ones,
have give up.

254

They've found out that war is no good.

255

War no good because soldiers all die.

256

- I'm talkin' sense and you know it.

You're brave, Red Stick,
and your warriors is brave.

But in the end, they're all gonna die
because you're a bad chief.

Because soon I burn white man's friend?

264

No, Red Stick, because you could all go
home in peace if you'd listen to reason.

265
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:51,921
But seein' as you won't,

I reckon I got to challenge you
accordin' to Injun law.

267

- Injun law no good for white man.
- Why not?

if you'd give it half a chance.

00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:14,461
Yeah, ain't it?

336
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:29,212
Dead center for Big Foot.

337
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,526
This one's dead center too.
You'll have to fire another round.

338
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:46,297
You was lucky.

339
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,673
Less'n a finger off the notch.

340
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:59,717
Better save your powder, stranger.

341
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,465
Why, he didn't even cut paper.

342
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:19,162
That'll take the turpentine
out of your bark.

343
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:23,105
- I was a-fearin' you fired too fast.
- Let's take a look.

344
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:32,440
- He missed the whole blamed board.
- [Old man] I ain't so sure.

345
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:41,855
Looky here.
One bullet right on top of the other.

346
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,052
Yee-haw.

347
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:46,564
That's the kinda shootin' makes
the ol' possum squeal.

348
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:48,832
Come on.

349
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:53,604
Here.

350
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:57,302
You're the first ones
in over to them parts.

351
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,572
Nearest neighbor's a Cherokee,
name of Charley Two Shirts.

352
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:02,408
Nice folks.

353
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:06,183
Thank you, Mr. Russel.

354
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:15,355
Davy Croc... you Davy Crockett?

355
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:18,794
- Why, sure.
- Davy Crockett.

356
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:22,856
No wonder you won Big Foot's beef
away from him.

357
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,266
[Russel] Didn't seem too happy about it.

358
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:28,499
No, Big Foot ain't used
to things goin' again' him.

359
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:31,097
Got folks pretty well
buffaloed around here.

360
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:32,803
So I noticed.

361
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:35,573
We had the beginnin's
of a decent community here,

362
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:38,172
before him and his riffraff moved in.

363
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:41,844
- What are they doin' here?
- Nobody dares talk much about it.

364
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,186
They been runnin' the Injuns off
their land, sellin' it to newcomers.

365
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:49,351
Government guarantees the Indians
their lands by treaty.

366
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:52,021
Treaties don't mean nothin' to Big Foot.

367
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:56,396
- Why don't somebody stop him?
- Fella that was magistrate here tried.

368
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:59,596
Went over to serve a warrant on him.
Never come back.

369
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:02,799
He had the prettiest rifle
ever seen in these parts.

370
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:06,139
Nobody knows what happened to him,
but we know where his gun is.

371
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:10,580
Yeah, Big Foot was shootin'
with it against Davy today.

372
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:16,143
That's right. Crockett, you're the only one
I know that could stand up to him.

373
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:18,951
Will you take on the job as magistrate?

374
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:23,426
- What would I have to do?
- Get us some law and order around here.

375
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:27,192
Well, I ain't crawfishin',
but I kinda got my hands full.

376
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:29,995
We gotta finish our cabins,
so I can bring my family.

377
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:33,799
It ain't no fit place for families
as long as they're runnin' loose.

378
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:35,669
What do you say?

379
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:39,266
Well, take some thinkin'.

380
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:47,648
- I'm drier than a powder horn.
- Fetch me some too.

381
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,399
[Whistling]

382
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:48,946
Hey. This what stood your hair up?

383
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:52,048
[Speaking native language]

384
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:56,177
- I was sure I seen a man.
- Nobody's gonna hurt ya. Come on out.

385
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,393
Come out of there.

386
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:08,695
- Who are you?
- Charley Two Shirts.

387
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:13,169
- He's our neighbor.
- What happened to you?

388
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:17,765
Three white men come to my farm.
Tell Charley Two Shirts, "Get off."

389
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:22,336
I say, "This my land."
They say, "Indian got no land."

390
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:25,280
I show paper.
This land belong Cherokee.

391
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,979
They tear paper up,
then Charley Two Shirts fight.

392
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:40,958
Reckon I'm gonna take on that job
of magistrate right now.

393
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,332
Hey, Big Foot.

394
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:57,137
Lookin' for somebody?

395
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:00,742
Yeah, the man that run my friend here
off his land.

396
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:11,421
I know who you are. Since when
is Davy Crockett a friend of Injuns?

397
00:39:11,496 --> 00:39:13,726
Always been a friend of the Cherokees.

398
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:16,767
Got no bones to pick with the others
since we made peace.

399
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:19,769
This land's too good for Injuns.
I'm filin' on it.

400
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:24,433
No, ya ain't. Injuns got rights.
They're folks same as anybody else.

401
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:27,273
Take a powerful argument
to convince me of that.

402
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:31,975
- That's what I come for.
- I've ate better men than you whole.

403
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:37,246
- How'll you have it, Big Foot?
- Rough and tumble. No holds barred.

404
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:05,279
Now ya got him, Big Foot.

405
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:07,409
Oh.

406
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:44,117
[Big Foot screams]

407
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,633
[Speaking Cherokee]

408
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:04,572
That goes for me too.

409
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:07,639
[Russel] Give him what for, Davy.

410
00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:15,743
[Gunshot]

411
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:23,652
Get 'em, Charley.

412
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:27,192
Come on.

413
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,498
Get up. I said, get up.

414
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:40,407
- Much obliged, Charley.
- Come on, get goin'.

415
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:45,244
- What you aimin' to do to us?
- Me? Nothin'.

416
00:41:45,316 --> 00:41:49,412
But you're gonna stand trial.
You two varmints got a lot to answer for.

417
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:51,546
Now get.

418
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:02,799
[Caller indistinct]

419
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:07,603
Davy Crockett.

420
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:10,106
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

421
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:13,342
- Howdy, Mr. Russel.
- Quite a frolic you got.

422
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:16,209
Ain't it?
Since Davy's been magistrate here,

423
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,408
we can enjoy ourselves
without it turnin' into a brawl.

424
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:23,749
I'll do the tradin' and meet ya out
by the dance. Save a pretty girl for me.

425
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:27,188
Before that fiddle gets into your foot,
I got some tidings for ya.

426
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:29,624
Come over to my place.
I'll tell ya about it.

427
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:34,154
Folks around here is pretty proud
of the job you done for us, Davy.

428
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:39,192
Since you got rid of Big Foot,
honest settlers is movin' in.

429
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:43,001
There's so many of 'em we're gonna
get us representation in Nashville.

430
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:45,167
That's what I want to talk to you about.

431
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:49,646
We held a meetin' last night to pick
who we want to run for state legislature.

432
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:54,481
- You won hands down.
- [Chuckling]

433
00:42:55,653 --> 00:43:00,681
Well, I'm plumb flutterated by the honor,
but I ain't no politician.

434
00:43:00,758 --> 00:43:05,718
You got the wrong bear up a tree, Judge.
Better get somebody more fittin'.

435
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:10,699
Like Amos Thorpe?
That lawyer who tried to get Big Foot off?

436
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:14,499
- You wouldn't run him?
- We wouldn't, but the opposition is.

437
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:17,541
Thorpe's got plenty of money
to spend on a campaign.

438
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:20,008
Money he made off
them Injun land grabs.

439
00:43:20,077 --> 00:43:23,410
We figure you're the only man
that's got a chance of beatin' him.

440
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:25,745
Will ya run again' him?

441
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:30,117
The way you put it,
I ain't got much choice.

442
00:43:31,656 --> 00:43:34,090
[Cheering, applauding]

443
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,101
Hey, I got a letter for ya.

444
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,505
Be right back.

445
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:58,713
It's only a month old too.

446
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:10,025
This ain't Polly's hand.

447
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:16,666
It's mighty poor writin'.
See if you can make it out.

448
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:22,395
- From your sister-in-law.
- Why'd she be writin'?

449
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:27,570
"Dear Davy, I take my pen in hand
to tell you some very sad news."

450
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:31,672
"Your beloved Polly was took...

451
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:44,225
was took down with a fever
and died in spite of all we could do.

452
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:46,855
The end was peaceful.

453
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:49,866
We buried her on the knoll
near your cabin.

454
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:51,798
Don't worry about the boys.

455
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:55,168
They are living with us
and getting along fine.

456
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:59,437
Little ones need a mother and
already they seem like my own.

457
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:04,638
We know you are suffering
the greatest loss a man can endure,

458
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:07,081
but the good Lord knows best.

459
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:09,709
Your loving sister-in-law."

460
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:15,214
[Sigh] Wish there was somethin'
I could say, Davy.

461
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,157
Anything I could do?

462
00:45:17,228 --> 00:45:20,891
Just give me some time by myself.

463
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:41,375
# Now he lost his love
And his grief was gall

464
00:45:41,452 --> 00:45:44,785
# In his heart he wanted to
Leave it all

465
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:47,585
# And lose himself in the forest tall

466
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:51,458
# But he answered instead
To his country's call

467
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:54,531
# Davy, Davy Crockett

468
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:59,968
# Beginnin' his campaign #

469
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:03,266
Well, here it goes.

470
00:46:04,108 --> 00:46:08,340
My honorable opponent knows
I ain't much shucks at speechifyin'.

471
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:13,042
Kind of him to let me speak first, so he
can make a lie out of everything I say.

472
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:14,209
[Crowd laughing]

473
00:46:14,285 --> 00:46:19,587
Truth is, I don't know nothing at all
about politics. I'll leave that up to him.

474
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:22,717
But I do know the woods
and the folks in 'em.

475
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:26,422
If you send me to Nashville,
I'll represent you as honest as I can.

476
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:28,556
Hooray for Davy.

477
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:32,465
I reckon that's all I got to say.

478
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:36,063
If this here speech seems a mite brief,

479
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,735
looks like my worthy opponent's
all set to make up for it.

480
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:42,301
If his speech is gonna be
as dry as I think it is,

481
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:45,439
maybe we better go over
to the tavern and wet our whistles.

482
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:47,814
[Cheering] Come on, boys.

483
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:51,545
Voters of the sovereign state
of Tennessee, I am well aware

484
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:54,853
of the sacred responsibility
you're about to bestow on me...

485
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:57,655
# Sent up to Nashville
The best they could find

486
00:46:57,728 --> 00:47:01,289
# A fightin' spirit and a thinkin' mind

487
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:04,698
# Davy, Davy Crockett

488
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:09,296
# Choice of the whole frontier #

489
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:14,334
- Is Colonel Crockett at home?
- No, but I'm expectin' him directly.

490
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:18,404
I'm Tobias Norton.
He served under me in the Indian wars.

491
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:21,076
Would you like to wait in his room?

492
00:47:28,058 --> 00:47:32,654
- You remember me, don't you?
- So you're Tobias Norton.

493
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:35,528
Never did know your first name, Major.

494
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,126
No rank any more, Davy.
I resigned from the Army three years ago.

495
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:42,468
- It's just plain Mr. Norton now.
- Sit down. What can I do for ya?

496
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,839
Just a sociable call.
I've been meaning to look you up.

497
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,969
Wish I could offer you something.

498
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,809
No, thanks. I never drink
before sundown, Colonel.

499
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:55,045
I ain't rightly a colonel. That was
in the militia, out in the canebrake.

500
00:47:58,422 --> 00:48:01,983
We've watched your career
in the legislature with a lot of interest.

501
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:05,290
- Just who's "we"?
- Why, General Jackson and myself.

502
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:07,728
As you may know,
we're opening a political battle

503
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:09,959
with the present administration.

504
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:14,232
We're going to make Andrew Jackson
the next president of the United States.

505
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:18,469
I had a notion old hickory-face
was travelin' along on his own shanks.

506
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:20,840
Well, everyone needs help, you know.

507
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:24,642
I'm sort of a campaign manager,
unofficially of course.

508
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:27,643
Ever been out to the Hermitage?

509
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:29,515
No, but I sure heard about it.

510
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:33,956
I could get you an invitation.
The general would be glad to see you.

511
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:37,693
I'd admire that just fine.

512
00:48:46,937 --> 00:48:50,236
- Howdy, General.
- Welcome, Crockett.

513
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:54,869
Come in. I'll be right down
soon as I get my boots on.

514
00:48:54,945 --> 00:48:57,379
Don't hurry, General.

515
00:49:03,254 --> 00:49:05,779
Good afternoon, Mr. Crockett.

516
00:49:09,793 --> 00:49:11,954
Take your hat, sir.

517
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:17,292
Glad you could come out, Crockett.

518
00:49:18,602 --> 00:49:21,435
It's been a long time
since we've seen each other.

519
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:24,838
You ain't changed, except
you ain't so fearsome out of uniform.

520
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:28,571
And you ain't so gamey without
your buckskins. Come on in.

521
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:34,476
Yes, everything's imported.

522
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:39,620
Except this.

523
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:42,782
Been savin' it for home folks.

524
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,260
Can't keep it in a decanter.
Eats the bottom out.

525
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,931
To your health, Crockett.

526
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,435
Here's somethin' else
I have to keep out of sight.

527
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:03,912
Exploits of Davy Crockett
in the Rocky Mountains.

528
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:09,385
I ain't never been west of the
muddy ol' Mississip. Let me see that.

529
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:11,887
Somebody's got a mighty
powerful imagination.

530
00:50:13,424 --> 00:50:15,949
"As told by his friend,
G.E. Russel."

531
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:19,086
Georgie Russel.
I might've knowed.

532
00:50:19,163 --> 00:50:20,858
They're making you famous.

533
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:24,059
Next to me you're about the most
famous man in Tennessee.

534
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:26,500
No wonder people's
taken to pointin' me out.

535
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,538
It's not only these yarns.

536
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:31,540
You've made yourself quite
a name in local politics.

537
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:34,133
Soap is only good for
washin' dirty hands.

538
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:37,009
Well, it's a fact.
Now, you listen to me.

539
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:38,946
I'm going to run for president.

540
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:41,951
My enemies will lift my scalp
if I get to Washington City.

541
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:45,682
I intend to take theirs first,
if I can get the right kind of help.

542
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:48,987
Crockett, I want you
to run for Congress.

543
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:53,291
Congress? General, you sure an old
head wound didn't trouble you a little?

544
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:56,356
I mean it.
I want men I can trust.

545
00:50:56,433 --> 00:51:00,164
Men I know are with me.
Men that can get the country behind me.

546
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:04,205
If I was to do what
you asked and I did get in,

547
00:51:04,274 --> 00:51:06,538
I wouldn't be takin' orders from you.

548
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:09,807
I'd be takin' 'em
from them that elected me.

549
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:13,714
That's just the answer I hoped I'd get.

550
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:17,753
# The votes were counted
And he won hands down

551
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:21,484
# So they sent him off
To Washington town

552
00:51:21,558 --> 00:51:25,494
# With his best dress suit
Still his buckskins brown

553
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:29,293
# A livin' legend
Of growin' renown

554
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:32,995
# Davy, Davy Crockett

555
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:37,063
# The canebrake Congressman #

556
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:42,078
Good mornin'.

557
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:45,482
Good mornin'.

558
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:50,012
Just a minute, Your Honor.
Hiya, Davy.

559
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:52,487
I wondered when you
was gonna show up.

560
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:55,787
You ol' bear wrestler you.
How are you?

561
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,020
I put up with your singin'
them lies about me,

562
00:51:58,095 --> 00:51:59,926
but printin' 'em is goin' too far.

563
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:03,023
- They helped put you here.
- Now I gotta live up to 'em.

564
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,365
You think I can go in dressed
like a respectable congressman?

565
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:09,600
I gotta go like the King of the Wild Frontier,
thanks to you.

566
00:52:09,673 --> 00:52:12,767
That's ungrateful.
I come all the way from the Obion River,

567
00:52:12,843 --> 00:52:14,834
to wish ya luck
on your maiden speech.

568
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:18,814
You just get yourself up in the gallery.
You're gonna hear a gullywhomper.

569
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,743
[Indistinct chatter]

570
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:26,886
[Gavel pounding]

571
00:52:26,957 --> 00:52:29,790
Before we get to the order
of business for the day,

572
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,227
the chair will recognize the
new gentleman from Tennessee,

573
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:36,596
the honorable David Crockett.

574
00:52:39,303 --> 00:52:42,101
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.

575
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,834
The fella around called
a Master-At-Arms

576
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:48,002
tells me a new congressman's
supposed to make a speech.

577
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:51,138
Well, here she goes.

578
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:55,015
I'm David Crockett,
fresh from the backwoods.

579
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:58,987
I'm half horse, half alligator and
a little attached to a snappin' turtle.

580
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:00,614
[All chuckling]

581
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:05,253
I got the fastest horse, the prettiest sister,
surest rifle and ugliest dog in Tennessee.

582
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:10,564
My father can lick
any man in Kentucky,

583
00:53:10,634 --> 00:53:13,626
and I can lick my father.

584
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:18,004
I can hug a bear and eat any man
opposed to Andy Jackson.

585
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:25,975
Some congressmen take pride in sayin'
a lot about nothin', like I'm doin' right now.

586
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:29,815
Others don't do nothin' for their pay
but just listen day in and day out.

587
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:32,913
I wish I may be shot
if I don't do more than listen.

588
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:37,450
The next time I get up before ya,
I'll have somethin' to say worth sayin'.

589
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:52,303
Made yourself at home here.
Buildin' that stable for your racehorses?

590
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:55,106
Man's got to have a way
to get his mind off his troubles.

591
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:58,614
This job's twice as tough as
fighting Injuns and ain't half the fun.

592
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:00,081
I know what you mean.

593
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,017
More government business is done
at fancy dress balls

594
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:04,883
than on the floor of Congress.

595
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:08,482
A man's got to skin the cat
any way he can. You know that.

596
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,017
What's important is keepin'
men like you behind me, solid.

597
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:15,223
You put a strain on a fella sometimes,
Mr. President.

598
00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:19,030
You're bound to make mistakes,
and you've made some humdingers.

599
00:54:19,102 --> 00:54:22,469
Davy, the President can't
think of just one group.

600
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:26,100
We're growing too fast.
There's nearly 13 million of us now.

601
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:29,304
We're bustin' at the seams.
We need room to grow.

602
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:32,075
Expansion.
That's what I'm thinkin' of.

603
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:35,585
And by the eternal, I'll not let
anything stand in the way of that.

604
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:42,089
Good morning, Congressman.
I'd like to speak to you a moment.

605
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:46,961
I see ya ain't combed all
the nits out of your hair, Davy.

606
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:50,193
Norton's changed.
He's been a lot of help to me.

607
00:54:50,267 --> 00:54:55,034
I was planning to see you later.
How long have you been in town, Russel?

608
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:58,541
I've arranged for you to do
a speaking tour of the big Eastern cities.

609
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:02,010
- I got work to do.
- That can wait. This is more important.

610
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,946
You're the logical choice.

611
00:55:05,015 --> 00:55:09,111
- Now, hold on. Why me?
- You've become a national figure.

612
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:11,916
Everybody's heard of you
and wants to see you.

613
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:16,289
- You can do a service for the country.
- By tellin' backwoods jokes?

614
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:20,691
I'm serious, Davy.
This tour is an opportunity.

615
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:24,097
You've got to think ahead.
Jackson's in his second term.

616
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:27,625
In three years, they'll be
electing a new president.

617
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,502
And some of us have been
seriously considering you.

618
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:33,634
Under the circumstances,
you can't afford to pass this up.

619
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:37,646
- Is it convenient to leave Sunday?
- Well...

620
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:40,239
- I guess so.
- I'll arrange your passage.

621
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,716
I enjoyed talking to you, Russel.

622
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:49,822
Davy, you used to have a motto.

623
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:52,657
"Be sure you're right,
and then go ahead."

624
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:56,889
Well, I sure hope you're right.

625
00:55:56,967 --> 00:56:00,300
# Him and his jokes traveled
All through the land

626
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:03,669
# His speeches made him friends
To beat the band

627
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,766
# His politickin'
Was their favorite brand

628
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:10,472
# And everyone wanted
To shake his hand

629
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:14,005
# Davy, Davy Crockett

630
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:18,544
# Helpin' his legend grow #

631
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:22,850
Citizens of Philadelphia,

632
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:27,990
this here's the most beautiful rifle gun
I ever hope to see.

633
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:31,523
She's so pretty, I'll give her a name.
Betsy suit you folks?

634
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,176
Now you all heard about me baggin'
105 bears in one winter.

635
00:56:41,244 --> 00:56:43,712
Betsy here ain't gonna
come to no such use.

636
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,045
I don't get no joy out of
killin' critters like that no more.

637
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:50,553
Why, the last bear I treed
I brung home alive.

638
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,214
We tamed him and now he sits
at the table like a man.

639
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:57,026
Named him Death Hug.

640
00:56:57,094 --> 00:57:01,053
I wouldn't wonder if he was smart enough
to travel and maybe go to Congress.

641
00:57:01,164 --> 00:57:03,758
[All laughing]

642
00:57:05,402 --> 00:57:10,567
Now, I hate long-winded speeches
and this one's long enough.

643
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,736
I'll always treasure this here
testimony of your friendship.

644
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:19,077
With a gun like this a man could
put a rifle ball through the moon.

645
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:21,982
First chance I get, I'm gonna try it.
Thank you.

646
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:35,957
What sliver's under your toenail?

647
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:38,557
Remember you tellin' me
how helpful Norton was?

648
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:41,661
He helped you out of Washington
'cause you was in the way.

649
00:57:41,738 --> 00:57:43,899
- Of what?
- The President's Injun bill.

650
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:46,875
- That's not on the floor.
- It's in debate now.

651
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:48,001
What?

652
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:52,515
Couple of your friends are tryin' to stall,
but no tellin' how long they can hold out.

653
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:55,608
Looks like my tour's over now.
How's the quickest way back?

654
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:59,018
- Way I come, in the saddle.
- I know where we can get fresh horses.

655
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:38,659
Haven't you been able
to force the vote yet?

656
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:41,526
The opposition won't yield the floor.

657
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:46,795
Get them to call that vote.

658
00:58:48,038 --> 00:58:52,168
- I didn't expect you back for a week.
- I know.

659
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:55,734
If you're worried about the Indian bill,
it's over. They've passed it.

660
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:58,280
They'll have to change their minds.

661
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:03,012
I'm warning you. Go in there
and you commit political suicide.

662
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:05,213
Know what I think about your politics?

663
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:16,459
I yield to the gentleman
from Tennessee.

664
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:25,732
Mr. Speaker,

665
00:59:25,809 --> 00:59:28,869
fellow members of the Congress
of these United States,

666
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:32,676
I've stood before you a good
many times in fights and fun.

667
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:35,684
We've had a laugh for the country
and our own digestion.

668
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:38,721
But you can fold up your grins
and put 'em away,

669
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:42,053
for you'll hear no jokes
from Davy Crockett today.

670
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:45,094
You have before you somethin'
called an Indian bill.

671
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:47,721
I don't aim to keep you here
much longer arguing.

672
00:59:47,797 --> 00:59:49,526
You've had enough of that.

673
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,467
But before it comes to a vote,
I want to remind you of something.

674
00:59:53,536 --> 00:59:58,064
Expansion is a mighty fine thing.
Sure, we gotta grow.

675
00:59:58,141 --> 01:00:02,009
But not at the expense of the things
this country was founded to protect.

676
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:06,310
The government's promises in the treaties
is as sacred as your own word.

677
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:09,819
Expansion's no excuse for persecutin'
a whole part of our people

678
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:13,447
because their skins are red
and they're uneducated to our ways.

679
01:00:13,523 --> 01:00:16,959
You wouldn't be doin' the settlers
no good votin' for this bill.

680
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:22,727
You'd only be makin' rich men out of
the land grabbers tryin' to get it passed.

681
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:26,360
Now, just who are these scalawags?

682
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:28,700
One of 'em could be the President,

683
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:31,536
usin' this Congress for his own purpose.

684
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:34,702
But I've known General Jackson
for half of my born life,

685
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:38,305
and I'm sure he's got nothin'
but the good of the country at heart.

686
01:00:38,381 --> 01:00:42,715
No, it's just a few thievin' varmints
hangin' on by givin' dinners and parties,

687
01:00:42,786 --> 01:00:45,619
reachin' for whatever
they can get a hold of.

688
01:00:45,689 --> 01:00:49,523
But they're a no-count lot,
'bout as natural as flies around molasses.

689
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:55,189
The real scalawags in this capitol
of the brave and free is us, you and me.

690
01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:59,201
I'm the worst of the lot. Reckon I've
missed as many sessions as any of you.

691
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:02,534
Out shootin' my mouth off
when I should have been here.

692
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:06,564
It's nobody's fault but our own
if a bill like this gets passed.

693
01:01:06,643 --> 01:01:12,104
We got a responsibility to this strappin',
fun-lovin' young bear cub of a country.

694
01:01:12,182 --> 01:01:16,585
We got a responsibility to help it grow into
the kind of nation the Lord meant it to be.

695
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:21,818
If we showed we were the men our friends
figured we was when they sent us here,

696
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:25,292
a bill like this would never live
long enough to even get on our desks,

697
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:27,694
let alone come to a vote.

698
01:01:37,674 --> 01:01:40,666
# He knew when he spoke
His career was done

699
01:01:40,744 --> 01:01:44,271
# But he spoke out strong
And his point he won

700
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:48,078
# Then packed his gear
And his trusty gun

701
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:51,746
# And lit out a-grinnin'
To follow the sun

702
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:55,279
# Davy, Davy Crockett

703
01:01:55,358 --> 01:02:00,489
# Hittin' the trail again #

704
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:03,462
Oh, there you are.

705
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:05,194
Hey, Davy...

706
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:08,536
ain't you gonna get no sleep?

707
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:11,039
- I've been doin' some thinkin'.
- Me too.

708
01:02:11,107 --> 01:02:15,066
We're pretty far downriver.
Ain't it time we decided where we're goin'?

709
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:18,581
- Always have had a good idea.
- Where?

710
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:28,782
"Texas independence threatened."

711
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:32,225
"General Santa Ana
vows to expel settlers."

712
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:34,229
Texas?

713
01:02:34,297 --> 01:02:38,825
We got the whole country to choose from,
and you gotta pick...

714
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:42,895
- Nothin' there but a mess of trouble.
- Americans in trouble.

715
01:02:42,972 --> 01:02:47,432
A bunch of crazy fools tryin'
to take on a whole army.

716
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:51,844
They're so far away from the rest of
the country, they know they won't get help.

717
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:56,352
A bunch of rock-headed idiots that won't
quit because they think they're right.

718
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:03,082
How soon you reckon we'll
be headed out that way?

719
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,787
Right after we get to Little Rock.

720
01:03:08,598 --> 01:03:11,726
A magnificent birthright,
flung willfully into the gutter.

721
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:13,928
A superb inheritance of mind and body,

722
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:17,234
squandered recklessly
in the muck of the common herd.

723
01:03:17,307 --> 01:03:20,970
Talents dissipated, courage abandoned,
character destroyed.

724
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:24,536
Gentlemen, the very one
for whom I've been waiting.

725
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:28,607
'Tis truly written,
"Hope springs eternal."

726
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:32,485
I've been thinking I might yet
find redemption in the company

727
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:36,889
of some peerless paragon of manhood
and virtue such as yourself.

728
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,291
You too, of course.

729
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:41,194
In other words, you want
Davy to be your backbone.

730
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:44,893
Backbone?
That's putting it rather bluntly, sir.

731
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:48,597
I am offering the Colonel
my incomparable companionship.

732
01:03:48,671 --> 01:03:52,300
Me and Russel are figurin'
on headin' down Texas way.

733
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:56,573
That ain't no place for a riverboat gambler
with wobbly knees.

734
01:03:56,646 --> 01:04:00,173
There are times when cowardice
is a virtue, my dear Colonel.

735
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,377
It makes choosing a course simple.

736
01:04:02,452 --> 01:04:05,148
I know nothing of this Texas,

737
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:08,987
but I do know the fury
of the outraged minions of the law,

738
01:04:09,058 --> 01:04:11,925
and as a consequence,
I fear what lies behind me

739
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:15,055
far more than the unknown,
which lies ahead.

740
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:19,465
Surely, you'll not deny me
the pleasure of your illustrious company.

741
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:26,038
Look, in the mornin'
don't forget this was your idea.

742
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:28,976
# He heard of Houston
And Austin and so

743
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:32,412
# To the Texas plains
He just had to go

744
01:04:32,482 --> 01:04:36,316
# Where land was free
And there was room to grow

745
01:04:36,386 --> 01:04:40,015
# And freedom was fightin'
Another foe

746
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:43,456
# Davy, Davy Crockett

747
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:48,020
# King of the wild frontier #

748
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:49,962
Well, there she is.

749
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:52,433
[Davy] Texas.

750
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:55,333
There's room out there
for every dream I ever had.

751
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:58,238
Yeah, there's room, all right.
Too much of it.

752
01:04:58,308 --> 01:05:00,970
A desolate, desiccated desert,

753
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:04,502
untouched by the hand
of man and God alike.

754
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:09,182
Well, there's somebody around,
and they know we're here.

755
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:15,983
- Indians?
- Probably Comanches.

756
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:22,361
You mean, that barbaric horde
they call the Cossacks of the Plains?

757
01:05:22,432 --> 01:05:25,595
Same critters.
We better be gettin' out of here.

758
01:05:36,312 --> 01:05:39,042
[Low rumble]

759
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:40,673
Whoa.

760
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:47,520
- What unearthly manifestation is that?
- Supposin' we find out.

761
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:08,739
[Davy] There's your Comanches.

762
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:10,676
That's what stampeded 'em.

763
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,476
He's crazy. He's headed
into that prairie dog town.

764
01:07:02,298 --> 01:07:05,495
Don't just stand there.
Give me a hand.

765
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:07,502
Bite off more than you could chew?

766
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,903
He might not look it, but he's
a powerful lot of Indian.

767
01:07:10,973 --> 01:07:13,965
If we can patch him up,
he'll make us a good guide.

768
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:32,954
I can hardly wait to sink my teeth
in this buffalo meat.

769
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:36,658
- Your friend's awake.
- [Davy] Good.

770
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:39,167
Think I'll have a palaver with him.

771
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:45,040
Can the Colonel actually
converse with that aborigine?

772
01:07:45,108 --> 01:07:46,166
Watch.

773
01:08:07,697 --> 01:08:10,723
He's tellin' Davy about himself
but I can't get it all.

774
01:08:12,935 --> 01:08:15,802
Near as I can make out,
this Indian's had a hard time.

775
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:18,636
He's been on many war parties
and never got a scalp.

776
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:22,144
The medicine man took his squaw
and kicked him out of the tribe.

777
01:08:22,211 --> 01:08:24,907
On top of that, his pony fell
and he lost a buffalo.

778
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:28,075
With all his busted luck,
sure you want him for a guide?

779
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:31,917
Lucky we ran into him. If we'd have
kept on goin', we'd have lost our hair.

780
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:33,819
Lost our hair?

781
01:08:45,101 --> 01:08:47,433
Mmm, smells good.

782
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:50,097
Says he's willin' to lead us
to a white settlement.

783
01:08:50,173 --> 01:08:52,903
I, for one, do not trust
that perfidious savage.

784
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:57,708
You better trust him. He's the only one
that knows the trail to the next water hole.

785
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:10,087
Mornin'.

786
01:09:10,226 --> 01:09:13,992
There's a settlement of Texans
down this way. Know where it is?

787
01:09:14,063 --> 01:09:17,464
- You mean San Antonio de Mexar?
- Yeah, that's her, San Antone.

788
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:19,501
It is not safe to go over there.

789
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:21,867
General Santa Ana
has already taken Mexar.

790
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,873
If he's taken the town,
where are the Texans?

791
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:29,105
In the Alamo,
an old mission across the river.

792
01:09:29,178 --> 01:09:32,306
- We got here a mite late.
- Let's see if we can make up for it.

793
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:37,114
You must not go there. The Alamo
has been surrounded by a big army,

794
01:09:37,186 --> 01:09:39,313
and there's many patrols all over.

795
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:41,856
We got through Injun country
without trouble.

796
01:09:41,924 --> 01:09:43,949
Company, forward.

797
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:53,799
[Speaking Spanish]

798
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:11,953
- They don't look very friendly.
- Let's get.

799
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:28,602
[Gunshots]

800
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:35,700
[Rifle shots]

801
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:44,912
[Distant gunshots]

802
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:48,810
Cover 'em.

803
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:04,297
- That was a tight squeeze. You all right?
- I reckon.

804
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:06,164
- You in command?
- I'm second.

805
01:12:06,235 --> 01:12:09,500
- Col. Bowie's commander.
- The fella who invented the knife?

806
01:12:09,572 --> 01:12:11,802
That's him. Come on.

807
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:15,071
He's been laid up. He took a fall
helping us mount the cannon.

808
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:18,204
The fever's been giving him
the devil ever since.

809
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,908
Colonel, we have more reinforcements.

810
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:24,384
- I'll see your men are taken care of.
- Thank you.

811
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:27,217
- Colonel Bowie?
- Yeah.

812
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:29,621
I brought a company in
and wanted to report.

813
01:12:29,692 --> 01:12:31,751
I'm Davy Crockett
from Tennessee.

814
01:12:31,827 --> 01:12:35,524
Davy Crockett.
I should've known.

815
01:12:35,598 --> 01:12:40,092
By God, I never hoped to see you
in this neck of the woods. Sit down.

816
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:42,637
[Coughs] I can't get rid of this cough.

817
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:47,836
- Tell me. How many men did you bring?
- Four, includin' myself.

818
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:51,141
Four?
Two acres of wall to defend.

819
01:12:51,213 --> 01:12:54,376
It'd take 1,000 troops to man
this garrison adequately.

820
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,441
I've got less than 200 volunteers.

821
01:12:56,519 --> 01:12:59,511
200 stubborn men
can do a lot of fightin'.

822
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:01,852
Crockett, I'm gonna be honest with you.

823
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:05,087
This miserable excuse
of a fort is our last chance.

824
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:10,189
If we can't hold Santa Ana until Houston
reorganizes our army, Texas is lost.

825
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,667
Well, we'll just have to hold her.

826
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,201
Right.

827
01:13:16,272 --> 01:13:18,706
I want to tell you
what we're up against.

828
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:20,765
We're practically encircled.

829
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:23,573
On top of that, we don't
have enough rations left

830
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,840
for a good-sized family dinner.

831
01:13:25,915 --> 01:13:30,852
Powder? There's about enough left
for a turkey shoot.

832
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,787
None of this goes
outside this room.

833
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:38,520
Sure, Colonel. These 200 you got,
ain't there any more Texans around?

834
01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:40,687
We've been sending messengers out.

835
01:13:40,763 --> 01:13:44,199
One did get back from Gonzales
with 32 men.

836
01:13:44,266 --> 01:13:48,430
There's a fair-sized force at Goliad.
We sent a courier a few days ago.

837
01:13:48,504 --> 01:13:52,235
- But I don't think he made it.
- I'll take a crack at gettin' through.

838
01:13:52,308 --> 01:13:56,472
No, we need your breed of men here.
Half horse, half alligator.

839
01:13:56,545 --> 01:13:59,537
The amount of powder in the gun's
not near as important

840
01:13:59,615 --> 01:14:02,243
as the spirit of the men
behind the sights.

841
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:04,343
Half any battle's
knowing you'll win.

842
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:08,789
Crockett, for the first time since
I've been here, I believe we can hold out.

843
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:13,758
With old Betsy here, and this here
Arkansas toothpick of yourn,

844
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:16,127
how can we lose?

845
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:24,038
Look at that camp. Every morning
there's twice as many as the night before.

846
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:25,835
I bet there's 2,000 of them.

847
01:14:25,908 --> 01:14:30,106
Why did Santa Ana call that truce,
sent for that messenger?

848
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:32,647
[Russel] Whatever it is, it ain't good.

849
01:14:42,992 --> 01:14:45,859
With His Excellency's compliments.

850
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:48,226
Crockett, come down here.

851
01:14:55,237 --> 01:14:57,205
Listen to this, Colonel.

852
01:14:57,273 --> 01:15:00,606
[In Spanish]

853
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:04,669
It's so flowery, it must've
been written by some other attorney.

854
01:15:04,747 --> 01:15:08,513
Roughly translated, it means
we surrender on his terms or...

855
01:15:08,584 --> 01:15:11,678
- I ain't much authority on surrenderin'.
- Neither am I.

856
01:15:11,754 --> 01:15:13,688
Moriarty.

857
01:15:14,456 --> 01:15:16,947
His Excellency's
offered to let us surrender.

858
01:15:17,026 --> 01:15:21,224
He's waitin' for an answer.
Let's give it to him. Fire in the hole!

859
01:15:50,392 --> 01:15:52,417
Hit the dust.

860
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:03,733
They say that war is the most
exalted experience a man can endure.

861
01:16:03,806 --> 01:16:07,503
To me, it's the most miserable
and untheatrical method of suicide.

862
01:16:07,576 --> 01:16:10,511
Shelled us all night and all day,
ain't hit a man yet.

863
01:16:10,579 --> 01:16:12,638
You ain't got nothin' to worry about.

864
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:15,878
Ain't nobody gonna hit you.
You're too shifty.

865
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:22,924
You volunteers better get
food and rest while you can.

866
01:16:22,992 --> 01:16:25,825
Sorry, no rest for the
gunners and officers.

867
01:16:25,895 --> 01:16:28,591
Go get some food.
You too.

868
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:30,461
Take your relief, men.

869
01:16:31,433 --> 01:16:33,799
I'll get yours for you, Davy.

870
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:39,499
Some of the boys are gettin'
worn pretty thin.

871
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:42,408
Four days and no casualties yet.
Incredible.

872
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:44,469
How much longer
will our luck hold up?

873
01:16:44,546 --> 01:16:47,014
This ain't luck.
It's the hand of Providence.

874
01:16:47,082 --> 01:16:50,415
- You really believe that?
- I sure do.

875
01:16:50,486 --> 01:16:52,317
So do I, Davy.

876
01:16:52,388 --> 01:16:54,720
You call that a serving?

877
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:58,954
It's difficult to maintain
manly courage on this provender.

878
01:17:03,565 --> 01:17:07,467
Would you care to tempt lady luck,
double or nothing?

879
01:17:07,536 --> 01:17:11,063
Why not?
My stomach sure ain't gonna miss this.

880
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:15,543
You hold the stakes, Busted Luck.
Come, my sporting friend.

881
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:19,172
We'll venture our fortunes
with the elusive pea.

882
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:24,083
Neither voodoo, hoodoo nor Hindu.
Prestidigitation, an old and honorable art.

883
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:26,519
Now you see it, now you don't.
Choose.

884
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:38,662
Oh, you'd risk your pittance of food
for a chance of a full belly?

885
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:44,434
Very well, my hungry aborigine,
since you thrust the wager upon me...

886
01:17:44,506 --> 01:17:46,599
Choose.

887
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:48,336
There.

888
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:20,300
- How ya doin'?
- Keepin' awake.

889
01:18:20,376 --> 01:18:22,936
I just found out somethin'.

890
01:18:23,012 --> 01:18:25,776
We're sittin' here like a bunch
of treed possums.

891
01:18:25,848 --> 01:18:28,749
We're about out of ammunition.
There's no help comin'.

892
01:18:28,817 --> 01:18:32,253
I knowed that since the day we got here.
We're still holdin' out.

893
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:35,654
Since the day we...
You knowed it since then?

894
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:38,022
Colonel asked me not to say anything.

895
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:40,288
You knowed and
you couldn't trust me,

896
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:43,160
after all the tight ones
we've been through?

897
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:45,325
I thought we was in this together.

898
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:48,268
We're both wore out.
Go get some sleep.

899
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:52,273
All right. From now on,
it's every man for hisself.

900
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,586
- What do you want?
- I had to see you.

901
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:09,317
Was it necessary to wake me up?

902
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:12,656
I ain't scared of fightin',
but this is gonna be a massacre.

903
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:15,788
- Not if we get help from Goliad.
- But you ain't got it.

904
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:20,062
You ain't got no way of tellin' unless
you get a messenger through.

905
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:21,727
You think you can make it?

906
01:19:21,804 --> 01:19:25,638
I've been in and out of bear traps
all my life. I ain't lost no toes yet.

907
01:19:25,707 --> 01:19:28,175
- When do you want to try?
- Right now.

908
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:30,541
I'll have the Colonel's
horse saddled up.

909
01:19:30,612 --> 01:19:33,740
Good. Now, how do I get
to this Goliad town?

910
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:36,341
That's a good question.

911
01:19:36,418 --> 01:19:40,081
Here's a drainage ditch,
sort of a sunken road.

912
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:44,285
If the moon's behind a cloud
and the sentries are asleep,

913
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:47,556
and if you have more luck
than one man's entitled to,

914
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:49,756
you might get through
their lines here.

915
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:58,096
- Why, that man's deserting.
- Deserting?

916
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:00,869
That's Russel trying to make it
to Goliad for help.

917
01:20:00,943 --> 01:20:02,911
Russel?

918
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:19,991
If you're worrying about Russel, don't.

919
01:20:20,062 --> 01:20:23,930
He's only been gone two days.
It's nearly 100 miles to Goliad.

920
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:27,901
- Couldn't make it back, then.
- Not yet. He'd have to wait for darkness.

921
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,835
[Explosion]

922
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:36,502
- There she is.
- Gun crew, over there in that draw.

923
01:20:36,578 --> 01:20:39,308
Save the big pop gun.
It eats too much powder.

924
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:42,214
They ain't as far off as they think
they are, are they?

925
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:44,616
Obligin' of 'em to move in so close.

926
01:20:44,686 --> 01:20:46,551
Moriarty, hold it.

927
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:52,358
- Leave a mite too much windage.
- Raise my sights a mite.

928
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:55,419
Guess you boys haven't
had enough practice.

929
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,925
He says old Betsy'll reach.

930
01:21:11,213 --> 01:21:12,510
[Cheering]

931
01:21:13,982 --> 01:21:15,745
That's more like it.

932
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:32,594
Hey, it's Russel.

933
01:21:33,702 --> 01:21:36,170
- Open the gates.
- [Rifle shots]

934
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:47,548
- How many men will they send us?
- They can't spare us none.

935
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:50,608
You eternal idiot.
You was safe, in the clear.

936
01:21:50,686 --> 01:21:54,281
- What'd you come back for?
- Just got lonesome, I reckon.

937
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:58,586
Notched you up like an ol' razorback.

938
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:01,060
They can't shoot for sour apples.

939
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:05,463
We won't get any help from Goliad.
I can't keep this from my men any longer.

940
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:07,331
Break it to Colonel Bowie.

941
01:22:07,402 --> 01:22:11,168
Have him move to a room in the chapel
where there's more protection.

942
01:22:11,974 --> 01:22:14,636
[Gunfire]

943
01:22:30,425 --> 01:22:32,916
Oh, it's you, Davy.

944
01:22:33,729 --> 01:22:36,061
Mighty good of you
to keep lookin' in on me.

945
01:22:36,131 --> 01:22:38,964
When a man's laid up,
he gets tired of his own company.

946
01:22:39,034 --> 01:22:41,229
I'm glad to see a friend's face.

947
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:43,897
Friends for less than a week.

948
01:22:44,706 --> 01:22:47,140
Pity we didn't meet before.

949
01:22:49,177 --> 01:22:51,270
Russel made it back from Goliad.

950
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:53,337
Tell me, did he...

951
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:56,344
No help.

952
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:03,351
I brought those men in here.
Reckon I better be with 'em now.

953
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:06,553
Take it easy, Colonel.
I'll get you outside.

954
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:12,226
Hornbuckle. Contreras.

955
01:23:14,636 --> 01:23:17,127
Move the Colonel outside.

956
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:22,136
I've called you all together
because it's time you knew the truth.

957
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:24,474
Russel brings bad news, men.

958
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:27,515
The defense of the Alamo
rests on us alone.

959
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:32,118
General Santa Ana has nearly
5,000 men massed against us.

960
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:37,591
I can't force you beyond patriotism
and your own conscience.

961
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:41,288
While it's still dark,
there's time to slip off to safety.

962
01:23:41,363 --> 01:23:44,662
I won't blame any man
who doesn't stay.

963
01:23:52,974 --> 01:23:57,001
Those who stay,
cross over the line.

964
01:24:00,982 --> 01:24:03,314
Boys, I don't think
I can make it myself.

965
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:06,115
I'd appreciate it if some of you
would help me across.

966
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:27,706
Thank you, men.

967
01:24:49,064 --> 01:24:53,433
- It's been a long time for us, Georgie.
- Yeah, a lot of years.

968
01:24:54,836 --> 01:24:57,396
A lot of things to remember.

969
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,497
Play us a little tune.

970
01:24:59,574 --> 01:25:02,702
Why don't you play one, Davy?

971
01:25:02,778 --> 01:25:06,737
That piece you made up when we was
leavin' the green hills of Tennessee.

972
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:10,911
- Figured you'd remember that 'un.
- Yeah, it's the only one you ever writ.

973
01:25:10,986 --> 01:25:13,477
Fellas like it too.

974
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:21,020
# Farewell to the mountains

975
01:25:21,096 --> 01:25:26,056
# Whose mazes to me

976
01:25:26,134 --> 01:25:31,037
# Were more beautiful far

977
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:36,169
# Than Eden could be

978
01:25:36,244 --> 01:25:40,908
# The home I redeemed

979
01:25:40,982 --> 01:25:45,919
# From the savage and wild

980
01:25:45,987 --> 01:25:50,356
# The home I have loved

981
01:25:50,425 --> 01:25:55,727
# As a father his child

982
01:25:55,797 --> 01:26:00,359
# The wife of my bosom

983
01:26:00,435 --> 01:26:04,371
# Farewell to ye all

984
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:08,842
# In the land of the stranger

985
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:11,174
# I rise

986
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:16,013
# Or I fall

987
01:26:20,155 --> 01:26:23,522
# Farewell to the mountains

988
01:26:23,592 --> 01:26:28,052
# Whose mazes to me

989
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:32,532
# More beautiful far

990
01:26:32,601 --> 01:26:37,561
# Than Eden could be

991
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:42,440
# The home I redeemed

992
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:47,312
# From the savage and wild

993
01:26:47,382 --> 01:26:51,978
# The home I have loved

994
01:26:52,053 --> 01:26:56,786
# As a father his child

995
01:26:56,858 --> 01:27:01,659
# The wife of my bosom

996
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:05,427
# Farewell to ye all

997
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:10,870
# In the land of the stranger

998
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:13,464
# I rise

999
01:27:13,542 --> 01:27:18,605
# Or I fall #

1000
01:27:20,515 --> 01:27:23,075
Hadn't you better get a little rest?

1001
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:26,848
It's a capital idea.
It may be our last.

1002
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:40,931
They're on us.

1003
01:27:41,002 --> 01:27:43,493
Here they come. Wake up, men.
On your feet.

1004
01:27:43,572 --> 01:27:45,972
[Military bugle call]

1005
01:28:26,047 --> 01:28:28,743
Ya-hoo. We're holdin' 'em.

1006
01:28:29,784 --> 01:28:32,617
Colonel, what's that bugle call
they were playin'?

1007
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:35,451
That's their signal for no quarter.

1008
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:38,856
Yeah?
Well, they'll be playin' that again.

1009
01:28:49,838 --> 01:28:51,829
Here they come.

1010
01:30:30,538 --> 01:30:32,904
They've breached the north wall.

1011
01:30:32,974 --> 01:30:35,499
Let's swing the cannon.
Come on.

1012
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,478
Fire in the hole!

1013
01:31:54,889 --> 01:31:57,687
Give 'em what for, Davy.

1014
01:32:15,944 --> 01:32:19,141
# Storybooks tell
They was all cut low

1015
01:32:19,214 --> 01:32:22,911
# But the truth of it is
This just ain't so

1016
01:32:22,984 --> 01:32:26,476
# Their spirits'll live
And their legends grow

1017
01:32:26,554 --> 01:32:30,046
# As long as we remember
The Alamo

1018
01:32:30,124 --> 01:32:33,457
# Davy, Davy Crockett

1019
01:32:33,528 --> 01:32:38,693
# Fightin' for liberty #
