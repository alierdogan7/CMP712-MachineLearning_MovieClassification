00:01:56,588 --> 00:02:01,619
American River
California Territory

4
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,400
Looks good on the back of a horse.

5
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,200
It's the indian in him.

6
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
You should not have
traded cows for the pony.

7
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,800
We have so little.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,600
Well, we'll get by.

9
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:36,200
Don't worry.

10
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,800
Look at him.

11
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Ma, did you see me?

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My son has his father's spirit.

13
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
Too much, I think.

14
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,500
"The mohican now found an opportunity to
make a powerful thrust with his knife."

15
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,200
"Magua suddenly relinquished his grasp "

16
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,600
and fell backward without motion
and seemingly without life."

17
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,200
Now go to bed.

18
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Just a little more?

19
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,100
It's late.

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Please, uncle jethro?

21
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,000
All right, a little more.

22
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,200
"Well done for the delawares."

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,500
"Victory to the mohicans", cried hawkeye.

24
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,100
Once more elevating the butt
of the long and fatal rifle.

25
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,500
It's time to teach them to read.

26
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,100
They like the telling.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,100
It was the same when I was a girl and
we listened to grandfather's stories.

28
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,100
They're sure curious, like their father.

29
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,000
Jacob was always thirsting
after something new.

30
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
He loved this book.

31
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,200
It is good you tell them book stories.

32
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,000
It's time I bought 'em some new ones.

33
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Afternoon.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,900
Afternoon.

35
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm sure hopin' you folks can steer
me in the direction of the digs.

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
I seem to have got myself plumb lost.

37
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,600
Digs?

38
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,700
Ain't you heard?

39
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,200
San francisco's gone crazy.

40
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,433
Fella up there's showin'
off gold from sutter's

41
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,300
mill right up here on the american river.

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,100
Gold?

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,500
Somebody's joshin' you.

44
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:21,400
No, it's the truth, mister.

45
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,500
You must be hungry.

46
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,365
Stay. Eat supper with us.

47
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,500
Thank you kindly, ma'am,
but I best be on my way.

48
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,200
There'll be plenty more on
my tail, I can tell you that.

49
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,400
It'll be picked clean in no time.

50
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,700
Could it be true?

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,100
Maybe.

52
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,000
San Francisco

53
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr. Matthers

54
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,300
I've heard nothin', margaret.

55
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,300
Damn it, man, did you hire me a team?

56
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,600
You simmer down.

57
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,800
Is there no one who's met
a virginia wheelwright?

58
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:17,565
No men who served with fremont?

59
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,500
I ask everyone who comes through,
margaret, just like I told you I would.

60
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,300
Hands off! That wagon's mine!

61
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,300
You're wasting my time, girl, and yours.

62
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:26,000
Best let it go.

63
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,000
I can'T.

64
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,500
It's my father.

65
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,900
Upper Klamath Lake
Oregon Territory

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,200
Captain, these aren't the
indians that killed your men.

67
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,900
Those are modoc people, these are klamath.

68
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Stand away from that prisoner, mr. Wheeler.

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,000
This chastisement will serve as
fair warning to all renegade tribes.

70
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,900
I joined the army to open up new lands,

71
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,500
but by opening them, we
had changed them forever.

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,400
I'd had my bellyful of soldiering
and paid too high a price for it,

73
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,600
in my heart and in my soul.

74
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
My family, or so I thought then,

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,100
was forever lost to me.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,565
Jethro had taken my place,

77
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
and they had lived in their rightful peace.

78
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,369
Once I had found that peace myself in the

79
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,500
solitude of the mountains
and hoped I would again.

80
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,200
I don't know.

81
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,500
I think I heard someone say
they were looking for gold.

82
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,300
Really?

83
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,100
Prospector: What's that?

84
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,000
What is that?

85
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,100
Jake.

86
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,800
Jake.

87
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,300
Jake.

88
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Jake, hey, look!

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
All right, all right!

90
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,000
10...

91
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,500
20...

92
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,600
25...

93
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,900
don't pass me by so easily, friend.

94
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
For only a fraction of an ounce of gold,

95
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:01,200
yours can be the secret of vitality.

96
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,200
Fancy a poke?

97
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,100
Sorry?

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,900
Only $5.00.Worth every penny.

99
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
Decided to try your hand?

100
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Yeah, maybe.

101
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,000
Some here's made enough
for 2 lifetimes already.

102
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,500
I'm martin.

103
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,400
Martin jarrett.

104
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,400
Jethro wheeler.

105
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,200
I've seen the elephant
and lived to tell the tale.

106
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,000
$397.17.

107
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
Just like that.

108
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,600
I'll be wishing you luck, jethro.

109
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,800
You just...

110
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,000
pulled that out of the water?

111
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Think on the lord's word, brothers.

112
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,300
What shall it profit a
man to gain the world,

113
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:42,100
but lose his own soul?

114
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
Move along, preacher.

115
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Take your doxology work someplace else.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,100
You're scarin' away all the gold.

117
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,965
You, brother, turn back now.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,900
Turn back before the wages of
sin exact their fearful toll.

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
It's none of my business, reverend, but...

120
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,500
if the good lord didn't want a man to profit
from all those rocks he put in the ground,

121
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:02,500
why'd he put 'em there?

122

134
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,500
Quit that gawking, girl,
and get back to work.

135
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:08,500
There's beds to be made.

136
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,765
I run a respectable house.

137
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,700
You'll see to it that it looks respectable.

138
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,600
Gentlemen, not a twitch.

139
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,300
Hey, you lookin' for someone, gal?

140
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,100
You ask me 'cause I know everybody.

141
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,565
Step aside, sir, please.

142
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,900
I have business with your officer.

143
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,000
Well,

144
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,100
listen to that, huh?

145
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,300
This little gal's got business, huh?

146
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,700
Back to your work, private.

147
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,800
Can I help you, miss?

148
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,000
Are there any men here who
served with captain fremont?

149
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,500
Some in the parade marched under his flag.

150
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,900
There's a few bear flaggers left.

151
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,100
Who you lookin' for?

152
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,200
Jacob wheeler.

153
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,400
Jacob wheeler...

154
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,600
sure, I know him.

155
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,800
Come with me.

156
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,800
I tell you, I've never seen
a muleskinner like old jacob.

157
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,000
Muleskinner?

158
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,800
Yes, ma'am.

159
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,500
Now, I'll do for you,

160
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,900
but first, you got to do for me.

161
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,100
Aah!

162
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,500
No.

163
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,800
Please...

164
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,600
It's all right.

165
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,500
It's all right.

166
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,200
You're safe with me.

167
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,200
You have to listen to me.

168
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:34,100
You have to leave here.

169
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,000
You have to leave here immediately.

170
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,000
You have to trust me.

171
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,100
You must leave.

172
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,300
This one appears to be in your size.

173
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,700
It's too pretty.

174
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,800
Nonsense.

175
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,500
No, I have many of these,
for my sittings, of course.

176
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,900
Thank you, mr. Biggs.

177
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,200
Please, uh...

178
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,300
call me ethan.

179
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,000
I shall call you margaret, all right?

180
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,300
You're very kind.

181
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,200
You must allow me to make
your portrait sometime.

182
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,700
I couldn'T.

183
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,800
Oh, I think you could.

184
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,100
It's not very big.

185
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,900
If you knew what you were talking about
you'd know that's probably worth about $30.

186
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,800
You have found more of this?

187
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,600
Not yet, but I will.

188
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,600
Can I hold it?

189
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,500
Sure you can.

190
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
You've never seen anything like it.

191
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,400
Hundreds of them in the river pulling
out a fortune without even trying.

192
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,300
It's nature's bounty, and it's
right there for the taking.

193
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
It cannot be so easy.

194
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,600
I'm telling you it's just sitting
there in the water waiting to be found,

195
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,500
and I'm, by god, gonna find it.

196
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,800
I want to do what's right by all of us.

197
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,800
You have.

198
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,650
No, no, a man can always do better,

199
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:31,300
and that's just what I mean to do.

200
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,000
You could fix wheels again.

201
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm no wheelwright, and neither was jacob.

202
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:37,400
You know that.

203
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Your brother would not
care about such things.

204
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Hell, he could be in the middle of some
stream right now making his fortune.

205
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
He sure ain't here.

206
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,100
It will be cold tonight.

207
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,700
Please bring in the wood.

208
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,100
Abe can do it.

209
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,500
Go on.

210
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,700

212
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,900
I mean I've looked after
them since my brother--

213
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,800
like I said,

214
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,300
when I'm done here, they're
not gonna want for anything.

215
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,800
Me, I'm going up river.

216
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Spent most of that 400 on supplies.

217
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,696
There's some making more
coin selling a man his

218
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:57,800
3 squares than standing
in the water all day.

219
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,400
Water gets right into my bones.

220
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,900
You gotta get yourself one of these.

221
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,200
Every now and then, it warms
a man's body and his spirit.

222

How do you get this thing out?

229
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,800
One of the hookers knows how.

230
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
This winter will be hard if
the new barn is not finished.

231

232

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,800
ok

365
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,500
We're rich.

366
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,300
We're rich.

367
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,300
We're stinking--

368
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:32,000
shut up!

369
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,900
You want 'em to kill us?

370
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,600
Get your coat quick!

371
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,700

372

373

375
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,700
Will you look at that.

376
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,000
How much gold do you think's there?

377
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,300
It's a big vein.

378
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I'd say a quarter, maybe a third.

379
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,600
Maybe a half?

380
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,100
You must take it from here quickly.

381
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,400
We've gotta get this assayed.

382
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,000
The river's up.

383
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,300
We'll go downstream to sacramento.

384
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:26,300
There's banks there.

385
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,400
We'll set out at dawn.

386
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:28,200
We gotta move fast.

387
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,452

our backs until we reach the river.

388

No

389
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,400
he is a boy.

390
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,600
Well, he's old enough to
make sure we keep what's ours.

391
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:35,265
This is not his doing.

392
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,500
Do not make him part of it!

393

having that rock means everything.

401

403
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,100

city house with servants

410

411

412

What are you gonna do with your half?

413
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,900
"Half".

414
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,800
What are you talking about "half?"

415
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,900
That was my claim.

416
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,100
Oh, you'll get your reward,
but you ain't getting half.

417
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,600
I'd say your take is a quarter.

418

423
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Take it or leave it.

424
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,600

01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,500
the next wheelers to set their wagons
toward the promise of the setting sun.

729
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,100
It's done, pa, just like
you said it would be.

730
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,365
Lincoln elected president.

731
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,800
South carolina to secede from the union.

732
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:31,200
This wheel could use a rim, jeremiah.

733
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,200
Yes, sir.

734
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,800
I measured it out for you.

735
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,300
Like i was saying, sir, if there's
work, I'm looking to get hired on.

736
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,100
I been pounding iron a long time now.

737
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,600
I even had me my own shop on
the plantation where I was born.

738
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,600
Now, I done fixed wheels, shod horses.

739
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,900
I even turned me some real nice
french quarter banisters, too.

740
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,800
Mm-hmm.

741
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,500
I been freed by my master,
and I got papers to prove it.

742
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,650
If it's food you need--

743
01:03:57,685 --> 01:03:58,700
with all due respect, sir,

744
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,600
I'll be working harder
and faster than 2 men,

745
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,900
and I don't expect much,

746
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
just some place to lay my
head when the day's done.

747
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,000
He could have the room at
the back of the shop, pa.

748
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,500
I'll work for nothing till you see
I ain't lying about what I can do.

749
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,600
What's your name?

750
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,400
Henry.

751
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,700
Henry foster, sir.

752
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,100
My sons, aaron and jeremiah.

753
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,700
Shake hands, boys.

754
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,141
The lord did not intend for these western

755
01:04:29,142 --> 01:04:31,700
lands to be cursed with
the scourge of slavery.

756
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:36,300
Virginia may be lost, but we must
endeavor to make sure kansas stays free.

757
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,300
Samson wheeler.

758
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,900
You'll work for wages.

759
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,500
I won't have it any other way.

760
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,000
Yes, sir.

761
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,100
Thank you, sir.

762
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,800
Thank you.

763
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,600
All right then, henry, let's get to work.

764
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:52,700
Yes, sir.

765
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:59,500
Mr. Lincoln has made a proposal to span
the country with a telegraph and a railroad.

766
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,500
A most righteous enterprise.

767
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,400
Do you think there will be war?

768
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,500
Men driven to extremes
are capable of anything,

769
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:13,200
but war and hatred only
breed more war and hatred.

770
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,300
Things will go hard on our
people back in wheelerton.

771
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,850
Well, let those that would
make war look to their

772
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:21,300
consciences for forgiveness
and love as we have to ours.

773
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,700
Why isn't clara helping you?

774
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,900
Oh, I do hate to pull her from her sewing.

775
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:30,500
The girl will never learn to make a home if
you allow her to avoid her responsibilities.

776
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I believe she is called to
a higher purpose, samson.

777
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,259
Someday, women in new orleans or atlanta or

778
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,700
perhaps even new york
will be wearing her gowns.

779
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,300
Frivolities.

780
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,300
Sheer frivolities.

781
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,300
Come in.

782
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,400
Clara, your mother requires
your help for supper.

783
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,800
Papa, look at this. Isn't it beautiful?

784
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,400
It isn't done yet, but...

785
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:02,500
do you like it?

786
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,100
It's quite beautiful.

787
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,000
It is, isn't it?

788
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,600
You know, clara,

789
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,900
your mother might appreciate a new dress.

790
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,000
For material.

791
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,200
I know just what to buy.

792
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,200
Thank you, papa!

793
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,900
I'll make her the best dress in lawrence.

794
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,700
Yes, you will.

795
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:33,412
There are those on our
borders who seek to deter us

796
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,100
from the great cause
which we have made our own.

797
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:44,300
I speak of the murderous bushwhackers who
refer to themselves as quantrill's raiders!

798
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:51,800
I say to you today we will defend our homes,

799
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,400
and we will defend our beliefs,

800
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,671
and we will not shy from blood

801
01:06:59,339 --> 01:07:04,682
until every godless
slave-holding citizen of

802
01:07:04,683 --> 01:07:10,500
missouri is cast into a
burning pit of hellfire!

803
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:24,800
Mr. Lane, why don't you save your guff for
all those blue-bellied yankees back east,

804
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,300
you and all your jayhawkin' kansas trash?

805
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,571
We're not gonna stand
for you comin' around here

806
01:07:33,572 --> 01:07:36,500
and dictatin' to us with
your nigger worshippin'.

807
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,400
You talk about hellfire, mr. Lane?

808
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,900
Well, I reckon we're gonna make things
hot enough around here for ya real soon,

809
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,100
and that is a fact, sir.

810
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,500
I seen your faces, and I'm gonna kill y'all.

811
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,200
I'm gonna murder every last one
of ya, and I'm gonna like it!

812
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:00,700
Hyah!

813
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,100
John brown's body lies
a-mouldering in his grave

814
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,700
john brown's body lies
a-mouldering in his grave

815
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:25,100
john brown's body lies
a-mouldering in his grave

816
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:29,600
his soul is marching on...

817
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,700
Nevada Territory

818
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,500
jacob: The pay was $100 a month,

819
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,000
and the distance was 2,000
miles from st. Joe, missouri

820
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,100
to sacramento, california.

821
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:46,270
The ad read, "wanted: Young,
skinny, wiry fellows not over 18.

822
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:50,400
"Must be experienced riders
willing to risk their failing.

823
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,100
Orphans preferred.

824
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,200
Not many were orphans,

825
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,100
but like my son, abe wheeler,

826
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,400
they were all hungry for
freedom and a taste of adventure.

827
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,700
And they weren't long finding it.

828
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,800
Any sign of indians?

829
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,000
Well, not until just now.

830
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,700
Careful.

831
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,600
Abe wheeler here has seen the back of
every station from, what, st.  Louis

832
01:09:17,635 --> 01:09:19,100
clear to sacramento?

833
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,200
And more than once, too.

834
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:20,900
Is that so?

835
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,100
Well, I rode me 60 miles today.

836
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,600
How many miles you make?

837
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,500
Of course, I done better.

838
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,500
I do my talking in the saddle.

839
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,400
Well, you got yourself a race, abe.

840
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,900
Yeah!

841
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:02,539
California

842
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,954
10 years had passed since I'd
been restored to those I loved.

843
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,100
While the country lay
on the verge of disunion,

844
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,200
for us that decade was
a time of great healing.

845
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,900
Never again would I know
such peace and contentment.

846
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,500
Mother, father, everyone's waiting.

847
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:22,900
Hurry please.

848
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,100
Ethan's losing the light.

849
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:34,000
Right, now, mr. Wheeler, could I have you
move a fraction closer to mrs. Wheeler?

850
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,000
And just for the sake
of symmetry, jacob, jr.

851
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,800
, Could you please change
places with corn flower?

852
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,100
Thank you.

853
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:46,900
All right.

854
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,500
Not a twitch.

855
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,000
And in this time of terrible trial,

856
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:02,240
we ask that you give strength
to mr. Lincoln's soldiers

857
01:12:02,241 --> 01:12:05,400
and keep our son abraham
safe wherever he may be.

858
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,300
And bless our lakota family.

859
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,200
Bless their wives and bless their children.

860
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,600
Amen.

861
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,300
All: Amen.

862
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,300
Let's eat.

863
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,600
Potatoes?

864
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,300
Certainly.

865
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,300
Now, ethan...

866
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,100
yes, sir.

867
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,200
Tell me the truth.

868
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:25,500
Does margaret treat her man
the same way her mother does me?

869
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,300
Jacob.

870
01:12:26,392 --> 01:12:26,900
No.
It's all right.

871
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Margaret is her mother's daughter
in many respects, mr. Wheeler.

872
01:12:29,035 --> 01:12:31,200
Jacob, pass the potatoes.
Yes, sir.

873
01:12:31,235 --> 01:12:32,100
Yeah, but can she cook?

874
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,500
That is a very dangerous question for
me to answer right now, mr. Wheeler.

875
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,700
Aren't you eating?

876
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,400
It's time for me to go, pa.

877
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,000
There's a war on now, and
california's declared for the union.

878
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,400
It's time I set out on my own.

879
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,500
Thought on where you're headed?

880
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,000
North, maybe, then east
across the territories.

881
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,700
I'll just let the wind
blow me where it wants to.

882
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:16,700
Well...

883
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,600
like you to have my pistol.

884
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,800
I'll feel better knowin' you're carrying
a gun that's already done some killin'...

885
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,400
and knows what it's about.

886
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,000
Jacob...

887
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,900
there are plenty out there who mean
harm, so don't you be afraid to use it.

888
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,800
Better that than gettin' killed.

889
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,100
You understand me?

890
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,100
Yes, sir.

891
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,400
I think it's coming today.

892
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,700
He says it's from new york.

893
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,100
Ma'am?

894
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,300
Soldier: Spare a penny?

895
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,000
It's very nice, but no, thank you.

896
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:30,700
Thank you.

897
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,800
Man: Quantrill's men did this.

898
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:54,600
All right.

899
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,100
Get to work.

900
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,700
I reckon I best be movin' on, mr. Wheeler.

901
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,400
No.

To give in to such
terror is to admit defeat.

903

I'll not have any of that kind of talk.

905
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,034
Susannah: Such convictions are all well and

906
01:15:24,035 --> 01:15:26,400
good for the boys, but
I worry for clara's sake.

907
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:30,400
At least allow me to send
word to nephew daniel in omaha.

908
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,799
I will not have the girl
obliged for her welfare

909

not on friendly terms with,

As each year passed, dog
star continued to count.

The symbols he drew caused him much pain,

916
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:10,000
but he did not abandon the sacred
trust which had been placed in him.

917
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:16,400
His brother running fox joked that
he saw no difference in the pictures,

we can't communicate with 'em.
