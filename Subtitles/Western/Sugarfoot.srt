00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,666
NARRATOR: Only men
to whom nothing was impossible

2
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:15,146
could've driven
more than 2,000 miles

3
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,108
to reach Prescott, Arizona,

4
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:21,113
through hostile country,
crawling with Apache Indians.

5
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:26,663
But of all the men who came
to this frontier

6
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:30,122
there were two who had nothing
in common, save ambition.

7
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:33,421
Even their courage was not of
the same breed.

8
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:36,216
Jacob Stint believed in getting
what he wanted

9
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:38,640
by any means that came easiest.

10
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:40,963
Cynical and unscrupulous,

11
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:43,207
he turned his vicious talents

12
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:45,976
to whatever might give him
an advantage or a profit.

13
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:51,290
Jackson Redan had seen service as a
cavalry officer in the Confederacy.

14
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:54,450
With the end of the war,
he was seeking a new home

15
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:57,966
where the name of Redan might climb
to its old importance.

16
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,341
Halt!

17
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:07,446
Whoa.

18
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:14,481
Prescott, Arizona.
- And the gold diggings.

19
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:17,861
Probably by tomorrow I'll be
washing nuggets out of some creek.

20
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:19,763
Gold may not be so easy to find.

21
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:22,744
Let me find some of it,
I'll scoop up what comes easiest

22
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,230
and never get another callous
on my hands.

23
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:28,416
Not Jacob Stint. Never
another day's hard work for me.

24
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:30,728
When did you do your last day of
hard work?

25
00:02:30,763 --> 00:02:34,017
The same day as you! You're a fine
one to sneer at me about work,

26
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:37,337
you that had a slave to pull on
your pants in the morning!

27
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:40,632
I wonder if they've got women here.

28
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,750
Women, yes.
Such women as you crave...

29
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:46,095
In this wilderness, there may be
women that can't be ladies.

30
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,437
You don't like me
any more than I do you.

31
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:50,195
I'll be glad to see the last of you.

32
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,414
I wonder.
- You wonder?

33
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:54,929
If we have seen the last
of each other.

34
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:59,429
Seems to me it's a country
where white men are likely to be
thrown together.

35
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:02,117
Should be room for both of us
without crowding.

36
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:07,059
We'll keep as far away
from each other as we can.

37
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:50,738
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

38
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:55,198
I bid you welcome to Prescott
and to the Diana, of which
I'm the proprietor.

39
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,801
Thank you.

40
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:03,127
- Did you arrive with the wagons
this afternoon?  - Yes.

41
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:05,646
My name's Crane.
- I'm pleased to meet you.

42
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:09,308
Will you quench your thirst
with me, sir?
- Thank you.

43
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,429
I don't know very much
about this sort of...

44
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:40,552
Well, as our Chinese friends say,

45
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:43,875
he who acknowledges ignorance
is on the road to wisdom.

46
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,697
And I don't have any money, either.
(CHUCKLES)

47
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:49,963
Rich men don't come to Arizona.
- I must earn a living.

48
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,363
This country offers opportunities.

49
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:55,686
I'd be grateful for information.
I have a wagon and six mules.

50
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:58,911
Well, you could rent them out,
or hire men to drive.

51
00:04:58,946 --> 00:05:02,552
However, the freighting business
is profitable but dangerous.

52
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:05,217
I don't hire men to go
where I'm afraid to go myself.

53
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:08,378
We're discussing business,
not personal bravery.

54
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,637
Then there's ranching. Land's free,
if you can hold it. Indians.

55
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:17,532
We Redans have had land in our blood
for generations. Broad, fertile acres.

56
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:21,185
I can't imagine a future for myself
which would remove me from the land.

57
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,433
There's no hurry...
the land will be here.

58
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:29,271
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
That's Johnny-Behind-The-Stove.

59
00:05:29,306 --> 00:05:31,181
My swamper.
- Swamper?

60
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:34,344
Mm. Keeps the place clean.
- But not himself.

61
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,473
I make him take a bath
once a month, all over!

62
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:41,207
Tell me,

63
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:44,370
did you ever deal faro?
- No. I've never seen it played.

64
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:46,921
You have an excellent appearance
and manner.

65
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:49,292
Manner's important
in a faro dealer.

66
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:54,334
The wages are high.
I think a month's practice will
fit you to sit behind the box.

67
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,129
Uh... I'm grateful,
but I don't think I'd like it.

68
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,654
I hope you avail yourself
of the Diana. You'll be welcome.

69
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,166
I thank you again.
You've been more than courteous.

70
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:06,037
And without obligation.

71
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:32,827
How be ye?
One of them new pilgrims?

72
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:37,322
Yes, ma'am. Could you tell me
where to get a good meal?
I'm tired of my own cooking.

73
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:40,043
You've come to the right place
at the right time.

74
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:43,434
Only place in Arizona
servin' goat's milk in the coffee.

75
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,572
Board $25 a week, gold.

76
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,501
In advance.

77
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:54,302
You can sit right down,
if you've got a mind to.

78
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:57,374
Sit anywhere.
First come, first served.
- Thank you, ma'am.

79
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,143
I ain't a ma'am. Name's Mary.
- Yes, Miss Mary.

80
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:02,057
Just 'Mary'.

81
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:04,172
But... the family name?

82
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:07,267
Them that don't ask questions
don't hear no lies.

83
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,242
See them goats outside?
- Mm-hm.

84
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:14,420
Drove 'em from Tucson by hand.

85
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:17,583
Come Injuns,
come fire or high water.

86
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:20,245
I named this here house
Fort Misery.

87
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,354
Don't know there was a good reason,
except I had plenty of misery
in my feet by the time I got here.

88
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,430
Wanna mention your name, pilgrim?
- My name's Jackson Redan.

89
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:32,322
Boys, get acquainted with
Jackson Redan, just come in
with them wagons.

90
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:34,098
How do you do?
- ALL: Howdy.

91
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,317
Jones is my name.
Fly-Up-The-Creek Jones.

92
00:07:37,352 --> 00:07:41,300
Earned his nickname
flyin' up one creek or another,
searchin' for gold.

93
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,601
Prospector, too, are you?
- No.

94
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:47,859
Are you cravin' to be a merchant,
sellin' wares over a counter?

95
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:50,478
I wouldn't care to be a merchant.

96
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:54,711
Every man born to woman is filled
with a cravin' and a desire.

97
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:57,390
What's yours?
- To get on in the world.

98
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,801
Reva, meet Jackson Redan.

99
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:05,727
This is Reva Cairn. She sings
down at the Diana saloon
and gambling hall.

100
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:08,092
How do you do?

101
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:14,403
Behaves nice, don't he? Draggin'
out your chair for you an' all.

102
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:17,295
Regular sugarfoot, ain't he?
Sugarfoot Jack.

103
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:32,431
Do I offend you in some way?

104
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,908
I'm sorry if I seem to be staring.

105
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:40,552
It's just that you're not
what I pictured gambling-hall girls
to look like. It surprises me.

106
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:44,256
It surprises you? It surprises you
that I'm a human being?

107
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:48,134
You're the same
as all the rest of them.

108
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:51,502
Do you think I have no life
or existence outside the Diana?

109
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:55,678
I'm afraid I don't know much about…
- I agree, Mr Redan. You don't!

110
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,619
(CHATTER, PIANO)

111
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,359
Good evening, sir.

112
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:15,585
Number 27, red.

113
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:21,780
What'll it be?
- The same.

114
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,442
Meet Sugarfoot Jack,
just got in from the east today.

115
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,692
Howdy.
- How do you do?

116
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:36,379
Thank you.

117
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:03,791

More!

More!

152
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:29,419
What are you so skittish for?

153
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:33,276
You've got no call to put on airs.
Anybody would think you was a lady.

154
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,844
I got money.
That's what you want, ain't it?

I spend freely on a woman.

156

I want no money spent on me.
I want to be left alone.

Stint, you heard Miss Cairn.

158

This ain't your business.
- I'm making it my business.

be on your way.

Good morning.

you really not know me yet.

167
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:21,468
I am Wormser.

168
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:27,408
You know, because I speak Spanish
better than I speak English,

169
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,484
You see? I-I tell you all.

170
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,257
This is my store.
Will you step inside, please?

171
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,995
I don't want to buy anything.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

172
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,841
You do not come in for buy.
For talk.

173
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:40,908
You have been in Prescott already
one whole week.

174
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:43,328
You run here, run there,
to ask questions,

175
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,852
and... you do not come
to Don Miguel.

176
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:47,609
Why? I...

177
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:50,101
No, come in, come in.

178
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,716
Pour out

179
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:02,232
If they buy, yes.
If they don't buy, also yes!

180
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:05,669
But one dram only.

181
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:08,578
It's the rule.
For one man, one dram.

182
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:11,457
Here in Arizona it is not like
where you come from.

183
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:13,746
It isn't like Alabama.
(CHUCKLES)

184
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:16,700
But anyway
I think you have come to stay.

185
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:19,228
I like men who have come to stay.

186
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:21,354
They will prosper.

187
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:23,523
So I say the man who comes here

188
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:26,402
must not be able to do
only one thing good,

189
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:28,563
he must do many things good.

190
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:31,943
He must be a Jacks-of-all-trade
with eyes open.

191
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:35,744
Are you advising me
not to start a plantation
but to be a Jack-of-all-trades?

192
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,052
Yes, but all the time learning.

193
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:41,295
Then a man who saves his money
and has learned many things,

194
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,298
he will be ready.

195
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,663
That is good advice.
- Yeah?

196
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:48,175
You have a good wagon with mules.

197
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,715
I think maybe together,
between me, you and your mules,

198
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,069
something good could happen to us.

199
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:58,466
You know the city of La Paz?

200
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,070
In that town there is merchandise,

201
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:03,762
but nothing comes from there
because of bad road.

202
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:07,927
Do I understand you want me to get
your merchandise in La Paz?
- Mm.

203
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:12,825
There is also in La Paz
other stranded merchandise,
which will be auctioned.

204
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,537
I give you money. If you are smart,
you buy cheap.

205
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,882
Then of that matter we will make
partnership with each other.

206
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:24,082
Partnership?
- You buy, I furnish gold.

207
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:28,053
Of the profits, if we make any,
you should take 25%.

208
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:30,459
Huh?

209
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:34,056
It is good not to jump.

210
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:40,235
You should go out now. You ask this man
and that man, is Don Miguel's money good?

211
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,798
Does Don Miguel deal fair?

212
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,462
You ask, is this Don Miguel
with the funny coat and whiskers

213
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,658
keeps always his word?

214
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:50,775
Then you make up your mind.

215
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,360
(CHUCKLES)

216
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:56,286
Lots of business we will do
together, Mr Sugarfoot, you and me.

217
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:05,565
Is Mr Crane in?
- Sure, Sugarfoot.

218
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,516
JC's up and around.

219
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,214
Hey, JC! Sugarfoot's
cravin' to see you.

220
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:14,266
Well, what can I do for you?

221
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:19,050
I wanna ask about... that foreigner,
the merchant across the street.

222
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:22,068
Do you refer to Don Miguel Wormser?
- That's right.

223
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:25,998
In Prescott we do not refer to him
as 'that foreigner'.

224
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:29,399
In Prescott we do not answer
questions about other men.

225
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,289
I beg your pardon.

226
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,209
Hold your horses.

227
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:39,989
Mr Redan, you come of a class of
men accustomed to take for granted
that they're better than other men.

228
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:45,513
In your manner, your speech,
it's apparent that you were reared
to be an aristocrat.

229
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:47,993
Now, that might be
a very good thing to be,

230
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:50,010
back wherever you came from.

231
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:52,240
It is not a good thing to be
out here.

232
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:55,147
In Arizona we do not judge a man

233
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:59,596
by the accomplishments and
the standing of his grandfather
or by the name of his family.

234
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:02,591
But we do have an aristocracy here.

235
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,613
Don Miguel Wormser belongs to it.

236
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:07,302
You do not.

237
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:09,144
Yet.

238
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,397
Am I clear?
- You are clear.

239
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:14,965
No offence?

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,673
On the contrary, my thanks.

241
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,619
So...

242
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:30,560
You will use your judgment,
Sugarfoot.

243
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:33,466
You have $5,000 gold
in your money belt.

244
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:36,589
It will be enough
to buy this stack of goods.

245
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,704
Pay as little as you must.

246
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:43,441
I'll get a good night's sleep and
leave first thing in the morning.

247
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:46,261
Good luck.
See you when you come back.

248

(COCK CROWS)

250
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:26,025
Someone hit me over the head
as I stooped to get into my tent.

251
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,698
When I came to, the gold was gone.

252
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,411
No-one besides you and myself
knew I had this gold.

253
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:35,314
It's possible to think
I planned it this way.

254
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:38,138
Mm, it could be thought.
- Well, it isn't true.

255
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:41,916
But it is true I was careless.
I took no precautions
and lost your money.

256
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,122
So?
- I assume the responsibility.

257
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:49,514
I haven't the $5,000, but I have
my mules and a good wagon.
You know the fair value.

258
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:51,760
I know what they will fetch.

259
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:55,799
If it doesn't come to $5,000, I'll
give you a note for the balance.

260
00:19:56,743 --> 00:20:00,400
I do not like to own mules.
- Then we'll find a buyer.

261
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:03,316
Look, if I keep my monies
in my safe till now,

262
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,967
they still would be in the safe, no?
- Yes.

263
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:09,813
Also, if you killed by Apaches and
the money is gone, it is my loss.

264
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:12,614
It would be.
- Then there is no difference.

265
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:15,686
It is better, because you are not
dead, only the money is gone.

266
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:17,778
There is the difference
of my carelessness.

267
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,975
Apaches also kill careless people.

268
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,558
Nevertheless,
I assume the obligation.

269
00:20:22,593 --> 00:20:24,791
I cannot honourably do otherwise.

270
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:26,948
Sugarfoot...
Honour, that's a thing.

271
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:30,116
Some honour is honour,
and other honour is foolishness.

272
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:33,209
Every man must live up
to his own conception of it.

273
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:36,850
I'll repay the $5,000.
- Repay it? You have a busted head.

274
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:38,548
That's nothing.

275
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,530
You could not start today
to La Paz with the wagon,

276
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:44,478
not with a head that is busted.
- It only aches a little.

277
00:20:45,082 --> 00:20:47,960
First I fix you up,
and then you come with me.

278
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:49,444
Come.

Oh.

285
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,152
Because I need $5,000,
I must wake you up.

286
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:10,420
Did you have to need it
at this hour?

287
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:12,654
I cannot pick and choose
when I need it.

- Mm-hm.

- Yes, gold.

Now clear out of here.
I want to go back to sleep.

So...

294
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:40,694
Then you start quick.

295
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:43,653
You should hitch your mules
to the wagon. YOUR mules.

296
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:47,533
Oh, that we talk when you come
back, if you are alive. Not now.

You mean, our agreement stands?

298
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:52,267
You mean, you still trust me
after my carelessness?

Every man is entitled
to be careless once.

300
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:58,857
People don't act this way.
How can you trust me again?

301
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,077
It is not a man's mistakes
you trust, just the man.

302

Now you go, Sugarfoot.
You make me a good dicker.

303

And you come back alive,
not sticking full with arrows.

- Yes.

if you never come back.

- Here and there.

Do that. This town suits me
plumb down to the ground.

334
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:39,844
Heh-uh-ep!

335
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:43,703
Come on.
I wanna show you somethin'.

336
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:58,656
Can you make it out?

337
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:01,199
No.

338
00:25:04,693 --> 00:25:06,797
Rattler.

339
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:08,851
Apaches catched this here fella

340
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:12,936
and tied him up, so as he couldn't
move nothin' but his head.

341
00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:15,878
Then they fetched
this here diamondback

342
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:19,383
and made a slit in the skin back
here, just ahead of the rattle,

343
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,888
and shoved a rawhide string
through it.

344
00:25:22,236 --> 00:25:24,861
Then they tied the rawhide
to this here stake,

345
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:28,275
so as that when the rattler struck
it'd be hauled up with a jerk

346
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,799
a couple of inches
from this here fella's face.

347
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:35,288
The snake's mad about
his sore tail, keeps strikin'.

348
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:38,479
Man keeps rearin' back his head.

349
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:43,661
Ain't no way of knowin'
how long he's able to keep it up.

350
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,977
Ain't agreeable to think about it.

351
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,346
I come to look at it
every so often.

352
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:53,261
Sorta reminds me to be cautious.

353
00:26:15,728 --> 00:26:17,662
Hm... that oughta fit.

354
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:20,042
Looks good, too.

355
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:27,837
I understand you have
a stock of stranded merchandise
to be auctioned.

356
00:26:27,978 --> 00:26:28,577
Yep.

357
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:31,507
Everything from bolts of calico
to ploughs.

358
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:34,403
Auction will be held tomorrow,
four o'clock.

359
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:36,495
Any charges
against this merchandise?

360
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,057
1,745 dollars and 73 cents.

361
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:42,777
That's what the company's expecting
to get out of it.

362
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:45,471
Will there be many bidders?
- Who's gonna bid?

363
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:47,601
Who's got the money around here?

364
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:50,160
Maybe that fat man with the hat,
eh?

365
00:26:50,195 --> 00:26:53,221
Who's he anyhow?
Snoopin' around, askin' questions.

366

367

Ain't no skin off my nose.

368
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:01,145
I'll be buying for Don Miguel
of Prescott.

369

a word of business?

My name is Goodhue, Asa Goodhue.

377
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:36,807
You are a businessman, I hope?

378

With an eye always open
to turn an honest penny.

379
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:42,159
You take my point.
You take it exactly.

380
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:47,097
Now, by asking questions, I learned
that you come here to buy
a certain stock of wares.

381
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,062
Oh, not for yourself
but as an agent.

382
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:54,453
There will be few to bid,
possibly only you and I.

383
00:27:54,488 --> 00:27:57,761
Now, sir, if you bid and if I bid,

384
00:27:57,796 --> 00:28:01,031
the price will be high,
the profit reduced.

385
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:03,649
Come to the point.
- Suppose you were to say to me,

386
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:08,087
'Friend Goodhue, I will give you
$500 to refrain from bidding
at this auction'?

387
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:11,775
Then I do not bid. I turn a penny
without risk of capital.

388
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,269
On the other hand, I say to you,

389
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:19,298
'Friend, I will give you $500
not to appear at the sale. '

390
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,600
Then I buy without opposition.

391
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:23,868
That is talking common sense.

the lowest form of life

was a Northern Abolitionist overseer
who'd hire himself out
to drive slaves.

395
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,626

I bet he's in politics.
But he's had his rattles cut off.

399
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:58,516
Fella wouldn't have much chance
agin a snake with his rattles cut
off. Could hit you without warnin'.

400
00:28:58,551 --> 00:29:01,504
I wouldn't estimate Mr Goodhue
as being dangerous.

401
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,851
That's right.
An amateur like you wouldn't.

402
00:29:03,886 --> 00:29:05,917
I was careless once.

403

to one carelessness.

to be friendly?

a more friendly man,

on good terms with all the world.

00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:03,623
Gun loaded?
- Yes.

503
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:05,671
How do you know?
Looked at it today?

504
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,628
No.

505
00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:10,063
You better.

506
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:12,881
Here, let me have a look
at that holster.

507
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:20,753
I've knowed pistols to stick...
just when they hadn't ought to.

508
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,273
Now, jerk it out
two or three times.

509
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,866
Looks dandy.

510
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:38,064
Now, mind you, watch his eyes,
not his hands.

511
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:41,570
Even when he's so far away that you
can't see his eyes.

512
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:44,494
And walk limp and slimpsy.

513
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:47,251
And leave your arms hanging floppy.

514
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,541
Well, I reckon that's all the advice
I got to give you.

515
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:53,452
Thank you.

516
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:57,560
Lay him sudden. In this game you
can't copper no bets.

517
00:36:58,293 --> 00:37:00,568
I... better be going.

518
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:03,739
Yeah.

519
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:15,060
(MURMURING)

520
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:25,877
Out here, you don't fight to see
what a nice gentleman you can be.

521
00:39:25,912 --> 00:39:27,649
You fight to kill.

522
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:30,038
I've learnt that.
- The trouble with you is

523
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:33,440
you was watchin' for what you was
sure he was goin' to do.

524
00:39:33,802 --> 00:39:37,044
Not for what you were sure he
weren't gonna do, so he got you.

525
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,679
I got him, too.
- Yeah, lucky for you.

526
00:39:40,012 --> 00:39:41,991
But he's walking around.

527
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:44,036
And here you be.

528
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:46,972
Yeah, walking around.
Him and that there fat fella.

529
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:48,968
What fat fella?

530
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:51,836
That pop-eyed dude you
horn-swaggled over La Paz.

531
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:54,669
Pair thicker than a couple of
mongrel puppies.

532
00:39:55,003 --> 00:40:00,100
'Bout the only thing I've
accomplished here in Arizona is to
make a pair of enemies for myself.

533
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:02,727
Hello.
- Welcome, Don Miguel.

534
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:04,964
Sit down!
- Sit down, sit there. Sit, sit.

535
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:07,166
It's nice to see you so.

536
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:09,239
You are very lucky, Mr Sugarfoot.

537
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,139
I am as good as new.

538
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:13,972
I hope there will be no more bullets
for you.

539
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:18,494
But I think, Mr Sugarfoot, you are
the man that bullets look for.

540
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:23,478
We have a nice little money
together.

541
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:26,949
First you have your share of what
La Paz goods sell for.

542
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:30,007
It's two thousand, three hundred,
eleven dollars.

543
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:33,391
My share amounted to so much?
- Si.

544
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,856
Also, while you are in your bed,

545
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,940
I think it is bad that your team
and wagons are idle.

546
00:40:38,975 --> 00:40:41,357
So I take freighting contracts for
you.

547
00:40:42,114 --> 00:40:46,369
From this is more or less one
thousand, one hundred and twenty
dollars.

548
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:48,910
I'm obligated to you for much
kindness.

549
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:51,289
Bad things come in this territory.

550
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:54,908
There is much anger,
and can be much suffering.

551
00:40:54,943 --> 00:40:57,029
I don't know what to do.

552
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:59,305
What bad things go on?
- Well...

553
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:04,401
Look, all business in Arizona
depends on the army.

554
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:09,201
To feed the army, to supply the army,
to grow crops for the army.

555
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:12,681
Now, the government cancelled its
contracts with our ranchers

556
00:41:12,716 --> 00:41:14,968
and the army quartermaster
will not buy.

557
00:41:15,003 --> 00:41:17,369
The army must have grain, it has to
buy grain.

558
00:41:17,404 --> 00:41:19,445
Animals must be fed.
- Sure.

559
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,451
They buy from California

560
00:41:21,486 --> 00:41:24,626
when grain raised in Arizona at
their door must rot!

561
00:41:25,117 --> 00:41:27,233
And the ranchers must starve.

562
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,185
And why? Politics.

563
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,313
Because palms are greased.

564
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:34,101
That's intolerable. I think I'd be
violent myself.

565
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:36,206
No, no. Violence is not good.

566
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:38,231
There is wild talk.

567
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:41,576
Our ranchers say that this
California grain must not come in.

568
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:44,237
They say the wagons should be
seized on the way,

569
00:41:44,272 --> 00:41:46,187
and the grain burned with fire.

570
00:41:46,222 --> 00:41:48,412
But that is bad.
There will be killing.

571
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:50,805
It will be bad for the dead
and for the living.

572
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,164
Who's planned this thing, who's
engineering it?

573
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,248
Engineering... I don't...

574
00:41:55,283 --> 00:41:58,571
For sure I don't know. But in
Prescott there's now a man

575
00:41:58,606 --> 00:42:00,614
by the man of Asa Goodhue.

576
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:02,618
Mr Goodhue.

577
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:06,259
Goodhue goes here and there.
He's friends with the quartermaster.

578
00:42:06,294 --> 00:42:09,554
He is a man who brushes himself very
clean and neat outside,

579
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:11,966
but inside he is creased.

580
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:14,029
In his smiling you see it.

581
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,986
I've met him.
- Yes, you have met him.

582
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:18,434
Also goes with him, Jacob Stint.

583
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,981
When do you expect this grain to
arrive from California?

584
00:42:23,016 --> 00:42:25,633
It is said it will be in Yuma or
La Paz, in maybe ten days,

585
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,736
in maybe two weeks.

586
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:31,674
Is it your belief that Goodhue is
the agent of the California parties?

587
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:35,534
I think so. I think he offers this
grain at half the price to ruin us.

588
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:40,063
It means that the ranchers would be
abandoned and he would have no
competition.

589
00:42:40,446 --> 00:42:42,487
Have protests been made
to the General?

590
00:42:42,522 --> 00:42:46,413
Be sure, he's... He's asked...
The orders cancel come
from Washington.

591
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:49,031
Washington.
- Hmm...

592
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,411
I know what it means to depend on
the land for a living.

593
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:55,032
Don Miguel...

594
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:57,661
if our men fight,
I will fight with them.

595
00:42:58,548 --> 00:43:00,880
If only I had
the wisdom of Solomon...

596
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,623
God bless you, Sugarfoot.

597
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,051
You ain't got the sense that God
gave geese!

598
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:24,532
I'm tired of being coddled, Mary.
I'm well.

599
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,698
You're well?
You go traipsin' around,

600
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:29,162
bust open that wound,
you'll see how well you be.

601
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:31,547
Now you're here,
sit down before you fall down.

602
00:43:31,582 --> 00:43:35,131
I got venison stew.
That'll put meat onto your bones.
- Mm...

603
00:43:35,335 --> 00:43:37,803
Hey, Reva, look who's here!

604
00:43:40,457 --> 00:43:43,392
Is this wise?
- It's been days since I've seen you.

605
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,893
I'll wait on you.

606
00:43:45,928 --> 00:43:48,977
Then sit down.
- Sit down now. I'll wait on you both.

607
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:58,778
Seems I remember you in my tent

608
00:43:58,813 --> 00:44:01,259
Seems that I would awaken
and see you there.

609
00:44:01,294 --> 00:44:03,318
There was need for nursing.

610
00:44:03,353 --> 00:44:05,299
But then you stopped coming.

611
00:44:05,334 --> 00:44:07,359
When the need for nursing was over.

612
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,560
Hmm... the days were very long.

613
00:44:09,595 --> 00:44:11,726
Every day I hoped you would come.

614
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:17,137
If we let them skunks fetch that
grain from California,

615
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:19,585
we're nothing but a pack
of pesky coyotes.

616
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,962
Well, I argue against it.
We gain nothing.

617
00:44:21,997 --> 00:44:24,830
But if you boys vote for trouble,
I'll string along.

618
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:27,438
Might as well be shot dead than
starved dead.

619
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:31,546
It's like a dare. Like, if a man tells
you to get out of town before dawn.

620
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:42,263
All right, Johnny. I'll see
Miss Cairn the rest of the way home.

621
00:44:42,298 --> 00:44:46,382
That's what you think. Ain't nobody
gonna molest her on the street no more.

622
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,670
I'm personally responsible
to walk her home every night.

623
00:44:49,705 --> 00:44:51,637
It's all right, Johnny.
- Oh!

624
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:53,791
It's him, hey?

625
00:44:53,826 --> 00:44:56,392
All right, all right.
You two walk ahead and spark,

626
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,976
but I'll be maudlin' right behind
till you get to your door.

627
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:04,624
You know what the ranchers were
discussing today?

628
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:08,038
There'll be trouble.
- There'll be a profit for Goodhue and Stint

629
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:09,820
if there is trouble.

630
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:13,063
Goodhue wouldn't hesitate to
interfere with his own shipments

631
00:45:13,098 --> 00:45:15,976
to make the authorities think
the ranchers were guilty.

632
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:18,855
It's the only use Goodhue would
have for a man like Stint.

633
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,833
Stint's leaving Prescott.

634
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:24,247
I must follow and somehow prevent
him doing what he plans to do.

635
00:45:24,282 --> 00:45:25,979
You're still weak.

636
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,644
A weak, unsteady man would stand
no chance against Jacob Stint.

637
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:31,275
He won't be alone if he means to
attack those wagons.

638
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,320
You'll be alone.
- There'll be Fly-Up-The-Creek.

639
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:37,086
How would you stop the attack?

640
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:38,912
How can I know that?

641
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:42,098
Thing like this, one has to act when
the time comes.

642
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,627
I could mind my own business and do
nothing about it.

643
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,771
It would be possible to do that.

644
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:49,770
Would you advise it?

645
00:45:49,805 --> 00:45:53,309
You're already determined to meddle
in it. You couldn't help yourself.

646
00:45:53,344 --> 00:45:55,351
No advice of mine would stop you.

647
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:58,924
When I come back I'll…
- If you come back it'll always be this way.

648
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:01,110
Always hoping to
see you just once again.

649
00:46:01,145 --> 00:46:04,675
Just once again until…
- Until I don't come back?

650
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,206
Or until I come back to tell you
Jacob Stint's dead?

651
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:10,544
I'll come back to you.

652
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:22,960
Stint's pulling his freight.
- Huh?

653
00:46:22,995 --> 00:46:24,902
Yeah, him and three other skunks.

654
00:46:24,937 --> 00:46:26,649
They're saddlin'.

655
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:29,266
Calculate to travel by night to
circumvent the Injuns.

656
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:31,286
We'll give them a half hour start.

657
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,970
Well, you keep on a settin'.
I'll sneak some horses out of town.

658
00:46:35,005 --> 00:46:38,619
No use shoutin' that we're movin'
out on Stint's trail.
- Good.

659
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,391
Them wagons will be
on the move soon.

660
00:46:57,833 --> 00:47:01,247
Maybe we guessed wrong.
Maybe Stint formed some other plan

661
00:47:01,282 --> 00:47:04,661
and isn't coming to La Paz.
- No, he's coming. Don't you fret.

662
00:47:04,842 --> 00:47:06,708
We should have stayed behind.

663
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:09,177
We shouldn't have let them
out of our sight.

664
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:11,641
I calculate we'll see 'em
plenty soon.

665
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:16,467
Ain't no other town, ain't no other
grain and ain't no other wagon train.

666
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,285
And if you ain't been took in complete, the

but I've got to get him.

There ain't a crack or cranny in this

I know Arizona like
it's the palm of my hand,

00:51:22,632 --> 00:51:25,510
and I just don't see how he's gonna
get back to Prescott

without passing through
Bell's Canyon.

Maybe you do.
- I don't know the country.

Well, you will before you get home.

708
00:51:31,853 --> 00:51:34,450
Now seems to me, if you want to
lay hands on Stint,

709
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:37,534
the thing to do is to wait for him
where he's got to be.
- Right.

710
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:39,359
Let's get to Bell's Canyon first.

we'll be there waitin'.

hide away with a price on my head.

We didn't ride to La Paz to help
Goodhue throw the blame for that
massacre on the ranchers.

00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:13,999
There's no way out of it. Stint or
his bearded friend must talk.

720
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:16,343
Well, they'll be kind of reluctant.

721
00:53:25,032 --> 00:53:26,905
I got mine.

00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,920
Here, let me tie him up.

tie him for keeps.

so good when I remember it.

- I'd answer polite, if I was you.

- Ever heard of a man named Goodhue?

746
00:55:02,058 --> 00:55:04,788
None of your business. But I never
heard the name. Never.

747
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:06,866
Stint recruited you…
- Never heard of no Stint.

748
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:09,677
Stint hired you to go to La Paz.
- I've never been to La Paz.

Not never in my life!
- How much did he pay you?

750

How much to hide behind houses
and shoot down unsuspecting men?
- Nobody hired me.

751
00:55:15,401 --> 00:55:18,691
Never seen this here La Paz.
- What's your price for murder? $100?

Close to it was another skeleton,
that of a rattle snake.

The Indians tied the man down so
that the only thing he could move
was his head.

Then they fastened the snake, so
that when it struck

760
00:55:43,148 --> 00:55:47,266
it could not quite reach the man's
face if he strained his head back.

only get it away from me, mister!

How much did Stint pay you?
- Fifty dollars.

776

How were you to earn it?
- It was to bushwhack the wagon train.

- Would you repeat this in Prescott?
- Yes.

- No, no. Let me go.

00:59:51,202 --> 00:59:54,114
Won't you need it for other things?
I have quite a bit of money.

830
00:59:54,149 --> 00:59:56,389
My singing pays me well.

831
00:59:58,618 --> 01:00:00,352
Your money is yours.

832
01:00:00,387 --> 01:00:02,366
Do you mean you don't like
the way I earned it?

833
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:06,064
Not that. I mean we Redans have
been accustomed to give to our wives,

834
01:00:06,099 --> 01:00:08,520
not to have our wives give to us.

835
01:00:10,012 --> 01:00:12,845
Was there never a Redan
who married a rich wife?

836
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,700
All you have is mine, isn't it?

837
01:00:15,735 --> 01:00:17,654
Yes, all I have or ever will have.

838
01:00:17,689 --> 01:00:21,068
You'd like me to have it? It makes
you happy to give it to me?
- Yes.

839
01:00:21,103 --> 01:00:24,484
Well, then, it's not sensible
to refuse me the same pleasure.

840
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:26,868
I'm not giving to you,
I'm giving to us.

841
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:29,218
I'll be a Redan.
I'll be part of the family.

842
01:00:29,343 --> 01:00:32,415
And when we have a son,
he'll be all Redan.

843
01:00:33,836 --> 01:00:35,798
Keep what you have
and give it to him.

844
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:39,758
Now, go make your plans for a house.
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

845
01:00:42,231 --> 01:00:44,795
Oh, you're stubborn, Sugarfoot.

846
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:46,650
You'll be a difficult husband
to manage.

847
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,985
Not difficult.
- No?
- Impossible.

848
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:52,995
That's what you think.
- A big house with a veranda.

849
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:56,887
A little house with a kitchen, parlour
and one bedroom, painted white.

850
01:00:56,922 --> 01:01:00,597
Where will you get the lumber?
Ain't no saw mill. It burned down.

851
01:01:00,632 --> 01:01:03,003
Then we'll have to build a saw mill.

852
01:01:03,158 --> 01:01:05,831
I'm going over
to have a talk with Don Miguel.

853
01:01:10,473 --> 01:01:12,289
You get married now pretty soon.

854
01:01:12,324 --> 01:01:15,327
As soon as the house is finished.
- Oh, I wish you good things.

855
01:01:15,362 --> 01:01:17,438
It is a good thing, this marrying.

856
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:21,125
It is a good thing for Prescott.
Also for... Arizona.

857
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,906
Civilisation, it is.

858
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:27,162
With each marrying comes more
civilisation and with each baby.

859
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:32,184
I hope soon I hear Reva sing a
kind of song she never sing before.

860
01:01:32,868 --> 01:01:34,911
Hello. JC. JC, come here.

861
01:01:34,946 --> 01:01:36,990
He wants to build a house.

862
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:38,997
So he must get a saw mill.

863
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:43,162
If there is no logs,
I bet you he go and grow trees.

864
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:46,050
He is a man who gets what he wants.

865
01:01:46,596 --> 01:01:51,636
Better everybody keep out from
under his foot or we get trampled.

866
01:01:51,671 --> 01:01:54,481
Wait a minute.
I hear there's a saw mill in Tucson.

867
01:01:54,516 --> 01:01:56,039
What'll it cost me?

868
01:01:56,074 --> 01:01:59,146
How long is a piece of string?

869
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:00,992
I have about $3,000.

870
01:02:01,027 --> 01:02:03,884
Too bad there isn't a stage line
so you can go there quickly to see.

871
01:02:04,173 --> 01:02:06,037
It would save time if I take my wagon.

872
01:02:06,295 --> 01:02:09,139
300 miles to Tucson,
say 12 days there, 12 days back,

873
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,467
if I can get the whole contraption
on one load.

874
01:02:11,502 --> 01:02:13,725
Sugarfoot, it isn't easy
for a man to get ahead

875
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,949
if he can't command
a certain amount of capital.

876
01:02:15,984 --> 01:02:17,685
I said I have a few thousand.

877
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,258
If I'm not willing to back
my judgement with money,
I get out of the argument.

878
01:02:21,293 --> 01:02:24,455
I'm willing to bet on you and
tell the dealer to flip his card.

879
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,878
Naturally, I'm complimented, sir,
and grateful.

880
01:02:26,913 --> 01:02:30,007
What I'm edging around to
is that if you ever have a project

881
01:02:30,008 --> 01:02:32,750
like this saw mill business,
for instance,

882
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:35,259
you can count on me up to $5,000.

883
01:02:35,888 --> 01:02:38,561
Why, I don't know what to say.
It's unusual. It's generous.

884
01:02:38,596 --> 01:02:40,911
Oh, hush your noise.
That's the way I play the game.

885
01:02:40,946 --> 01:02:43,453
When you want the money,
come and get it.

886
01:02:45,572 --> 01:02:47,858
Come in. I help you plan. Come.

887
01:03:14,384 --> 01:03:16,654
I'm going to marry Sugarfoot Redan.

888
01:03:16,689 --> 01:03:18,888
I congratulate him.
I felicitate you.

889
01:03:18,923 --> 01:03:22,381
The point I wish to make
is I'm GOING to marry him.

890
01:03:22,692 --> 01:03:24,693
Why do you say this to me,
Miss Cairn?

891
01:03:24,728 --> 01:03:28,869
Sugarfoot starts on a trip today that'll
be sufficiently dangerous in itself.

892
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:31,653
He must not be shot
from ambush by Jacob Stint.

893
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,720
What an appalling thought.

894
01:03:33,755 --> 01:03:36,531
And it would be wise for you
to order him not to do it.

895
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:39,364
Because if Sugarfoot does not come
back safely,

896
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,689
Johnny-Behind-The-Stove
will shoot you.

897
01:03:41,724 --> 01:03:45,751
Not from ambush but publicly,
wherever he meets you.

898
01:03:45,892 --> 01:03:49,115
Be a pleasure to do a favour
for a lady.

899
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:52,338
Deader'n a mackerel,
right slap dab there.

900
01:03:52,373 --> 01:03:54,804
Good morning, Mr Goodhue.

901
01:04:04,602 --> 01:04:06,266
Reva.

902
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,064
Why the conference with Goodhue?

903
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:10,214
Private. Very private.

904
01:04:10,249 --> 01:04:12,766
Secrets from me?
- More than you'll ever guess.

905
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:15,246
Yeah. And there's
them that'll back her play.

906
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:18,512
I made him a promise and
I think he's convinced I'll keep it.

907
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:20,383
What promise?

908
01:04:20,418 --> 01:04:23,592
That if any harm came to you, if
you were hurt or shot from ambush,

909
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:25,869
Johnny-Behind-The-Stove
will kill him.

910
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,834
Why, he may be totally innocent.

911
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:29,482
No matter.

912
01:04:29,517 --> 01:04:33,192
If you are taken away from me,
I'll see to it that someone dies.

913
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:38,627
Do you think I'm some tame,
pampered girl from Alabama?

914
01:04:39,062 --> 01:04:41,212
I can hate as well as a man.

915
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:43,946
And I would hate more dangerously
than a man.

916
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:50,746
Whew!

917
01:04:53,881 --> 01:04:56,452
Seems to me a body
could do without a saw mill

918
01:04:56,487 --> 01:05:00,248
instead of traipsing 300 miles
to get it.

919
01:05:00,283 --> 01:05:02,600
Now 300 miles back.

920
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:05,994
Ain't no saw mill worth
that much toil, it seems to me.

921
01:05:06,029 --> 01:05:08,574
Well, it depends on
how badly you want a saw mill.

922
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:12,568
Well, me here weren't never married
so I ain't got no advice to offer you.

923
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:16,088
I doubt if advice about marriage
is much good to anyone.

924
01:05:16,693 --> 01:05:20,424
Likely you won't be gallivanting
around much now, Sugarfoot.

925
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:23,137
Everything I've teached you
is kinda wasted.

926
01:05:23,172 --> 01:05:25,506
(CHUCKLES)

927
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:27,840
(GUNSHOT)

928
01:05:28,874 --> 01:05:31,195
Whoa! Whoa!

929
01:05:46,812 --> 01:05:49,792
Injuns got somebody
bushwhacked in them hills.

930
01:05:52,207 --> 01:05:55,529
Couple of 'em. Let's crawl up
and see who's doing what.

931
01:05:55,983 --> 01:05:59,305
I'd rather shoot down onto them
than be shot down onto.

932
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:10,581
(GUNSHOT)

933
01:06:16,466 --> 01:06:19,333
It's Billings.
- Who's t'other gent?

934
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:25,704
A friend of yours named Jacob Stint.

935
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:29,559
See, all we gotta do
is haul our freight outta here.

936
01:06:29,594 --> 01:06:31,454
Just vamoose
and mind our own business

937
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:33,798
and let them Apaches
take a job off'n your hands.

938
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,234
(GUNSHOT)
That would be easy,

939
01:06:35,269 --> 01:06:37,942
only the quarrel isn't
between those Indians and Stint.

940
01:06:37,977 --> 01:06:39,733
It's between Stint and me.

941
01:06:39,768 --> 01:06:41,907
Listen, Sugarfoot,
it's kind of a waste of time

942
01:06:41,942 --> 01:06:43,618
to go rescuing him from them Apaches

943
01:06:43,653 --> 01:06:46,645
just so we can bang a bullet
into him ourselves.

944
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,556
Missed.

945
01:06:57,591 --> 01:07:01,755
That'll be Asa Goodhue.
Maybe he'll scare them Indians off.
He'll think of something.

946
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,675
Better be givin' a thought
to being on time to meet us.

947
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:09,356
Don't he know that a body
can't sit too long in Injun country
without inviting trouble?

948
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:11,607
(GUNSHOTS)

949
01:08:13,428 --> 01:08:17,228
That'll about wind her up.
The rest'll skedaddle.

950
01:08:19,063 --> 01:08:21,349
(GUNSHOT)

951
01:08:32,853 --> 01:08:35,219
That ain't Goodhue!

952
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,534
Damn skunks.

953
01:08:39,569 --> 01:08:42,513
Them wobble-jawed
slit-eared peasant-toothed skunks.

954
01:08:42,548 --> 01:08:45,458
Taking a shot at me
after we just saved their lives.

955
01:08:45,493 --> 01:08:47,816
Now it's our bounden duty
to get 'em.
- No.

956
01:08:48,195 --> 01:08:50,675
You're a comical fella.

957
01:08:51,789 --> 01:08:54,792
Our job is not to cheat the law
that'll hang 'em.

958
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:59,531
Stint! Jacob Stint!
We just saved your lives.

959
01:08:59,897 --> 01:09:03,708
We didn't ask you to! Why didn't you
let the Indians do the job for you?

960
01:09:03,743 --> 01:09:05,913
I like to do my own dirty work.

961
01:09:05,948 --> 01:09:09,952
You're a fool. You were a fool
not to let the Apaches murder me!

962
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:14,231
You always will be a fool
and because you're a fool you'll
make it easier for me to kill you!

963
01:09:14,266 --> 01:09:16,513
He's talking sense.

964
01:09:16,548 --> 01:09:19,153
You don't dare
marry that singer while I'm alive.

965
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:21,559
(GUNSHOT)

966
01:09:24,175 --> 01:09:26,068
Goodhue's up there.
- I see him.

967
01:09:26,103 --> 01:09:28,583
This here's a cat of another colour.

968
01:09:30,218 --> 01:09:33,335
If that's a sample of his shooting,
he isn't very fancy.

969
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:36,454
Takes a right good man
to shoot accurate downhill.

970
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:46,042
Can't argue with a headstrong fella
like that, wasting lead.

971
01:09:46,077 --> 01:09:48,348
Ain't got no idea of economy.

972
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:50,968
(HOOFBEATS)

973
01:09:54,873 --> 01:09:56,969
Darn fool!
Ain't I learnt you nothing?

974
01:09:57,094 --> 01:09:59,135
Stint and Billings,
they're getting away.

975
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:01,177
Yeah, Stint don't miss no bets,
does he?

976
01:10:01,212 --> 01:10:03,138
Plumb active 'tween the ears.

977
01:10:03,173 --> 01:10:05,367
Come on. Goodhue couldn't hit us
with a cannon.

978
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:08,770
Maybe. I helped bury a fella once,
who took things for granted.

979
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:11,394
But Stint's getting away from me.
- He's GOT away from you

980
01:10:11,429 --> 01:10:15,331
and you'll never catch up with
him with a slug through your skull.

981
01:10:18,184 --> 01:10:20,971
Come on, let's hyper of here
and call it a day.

982
01:10:38,286 --> 01:10:39,946
Reva! Hey! Reva!

983
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:42,302
No need to holler the house down!

984
01:10:44,044 --> 01:10:46,063
Oh, I thought
I would never see you again.

985
01:10:46,098 --> 01:10:50,068
Shucks. Before you get
through with it, you'll see more
of him than what you can endure.

986
01:10:50,103 --> 01:10:52,636
Come on.
I've got something to show you.

987
01:10:58,084 --> 01:11:00,393
There's the start of our house.

988
01:11:01,059 --> 01:11:03,084
I'll be a good wife.

989
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:05,064
I'm going to deserve it.

990
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:07,533
I'll ride into town with you.

991
01:11:10,707 --> 01:11:13,130
I won't be but a minute.

992
01:11:19,846 --> 01:11:21,873
My, how that there gal's changed.

993
01:11:21,908 --> 01:11:24,634
How changed, Mary?
- Kind of blossomed out

994
01:11:24,669 --> 01:11:27,361
She'd got to be kind
of ingrown and offish.

995
01:11:27,678 --> 01:11:31,010
But now she's just like a little
gal again, smilin' and natural.

996
01:11:31,045 --> 01:11:34,305
Most gals'd be tickled if
their man gave them a fine present.

997
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:38,003
But to go singing and trilling around
because a man was sweet and kind

998
01:11:38,038 --> 01:11:40,722
and big-hearted enough
to let a gal loan him money

999
01:11:40,757 --> 01:11:43,035
is past my understanding.

1000
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:46,783
Goodness. How I run on.

1001
01:11:46,818 --> 01:11:50,402
Seems like my tongue just gallops
away with my brain sometimes.

1002
01:11:50,437 --> 01:11:53,530
Lookee here, Sugarfoot,
what are you aiming to do?

1003
01:11:54,749 --> 01:11:57,172
This is going to be one
of the proudest days of my life.

1004
01:11:57,207 --> 01:11:59,548
And the sweetest.

1005
01:12:01,741 --> 01:12:04,312
What's happened?
Why do you look at me like that?

1006
01:12:04,347 --> 01:12:08,829
Reva, before I left for Tucson,
Mr Crane offered to loan me $5,000.

1007
01:12:08,864 --> 01:12:12,122
Yes?
- It wasn't his money he loaned to me.

1008
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:14,949
No.
- It was yours.

1009
01:12:15,388 --> 01:12:18,391
Yes.
- Perhaps you have some explanation?

1010
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:21,415
Only that I loved you
and wanted to help you.

1011
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,021
I wouldn't have taken it
had I known it came from you.

1012
01:12:24,056 --> 01:12:29,779
You're offended. You're angry
because I've just done something
that injures your vanity as a man.

1013
01:12:29,814 --> 01:12:31,413
As a Redan of Alabama.

1014
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:33,758
Deceit is not a good foundation
for marriage.

1015
01:12:33,793 --> 01:12:37,069
Oh, you are stubborn, Sugarfoot.
You're relentless.

1016
01:12:37,609 --> 01:12:40,392
When I'm your wife, I will
have to face that and deal with it.

1017
01:12:40,427 --> 01:12:45,137
When I cannot reason with you,
nor persuade you, nor cajole you,
Sugarfoot, I shall trick you!

1018
01:12:45,172 --> 01:12:48,956
There you have it! It's the only
way I can hold my own against you.

1019
01:12:51,036 --> 01:12:54,415
Did you think I was going to cry
or beg for forgiveness?

1020
01:12:58,036 --> 01:13:01,620
Please go away now. Come back
tomorrow maybe or the next day.

1021
01:13:02,353 --> 01:13:05,117
But I don't want to see you
any more just now.

1022
01:13:39,411 --> 01:13:41,788
(KNOCKING)
Come in.

1023
01:13:46,604 --> 01:13:49,016
Where's Reva?
- In her room.

1024
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:52,745
Will you ask her
if she wishes to see me?

1025
01:13:54,656 --> 01:13:56,308
Listen, you, Sugarfoot.

1026
01:13:56,343 --> 01:13:59,327
If you've got the sense
God gave geese, use it this night.

1027
01:13:59,546 --> 01:14:05,632
Use sense, you big lummox.
And understandin', and gentleness.

1028
01:14:26,281 --> 01:14:30,411
You... You once said that we'd have
to prove ourselves to each other.

1029
01:14:30,993 --> 01:14:32,906
I know that I've failed you.

1030
01:14:32,941 --> 01:14:37,184
I've failed you, not only
with myself but with Jacob Stint.

1031
01:14:38,028 --> 01:14:41,771
Reva, what I came to tell you
is that you must cut loose from me.

1032
01:14:42,889 --> 01:14:45,008
Must I? Is that the way of it?

1033
01:14:45,043 --> 01:14:46,809
For YOUR sake,
for your peace of mind.

1034
01:14:46,844 --> 01:14:48,926
Would parting from you
bring me peace of mind?

1035
01:14:48,961 --> 01:14:51,757
Doesn't matter now.
Nothing matters.

1036
01:14:52,269 --> 01:14:55,500
Come humiliation,
come resentment, come anything.

1037
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:58,471
There's nothing left of me but...

1038
01:14:59,101 --> 01:15:00,610
love for you.

1039
01:15:00,645 --> 01:15:03,034
There's nothing else to say.

1040
01:15:03,287 --> 01:15:05,994
Yet you would give me up.
- Because I love you.

1041
01:15:10,283 --> 01:15:11,857
Sugarfoot!

1042
01:15:11,892 --> 01:15:14,315
You're always in the way, Sugarfoot.

1043
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:18,071
You meddle. Not that I bear ill.
I deplore violence.

1044
01:15:18,106 --> 01:15:21,985
I am a simple man of business, Mr Redan.
A simple, peaceable man of business.
- Shut up!

1045
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,827
Let Miss Cairn go away.
- She'll watch.

1046
01:15:23,862 --> 01:15:25,822
That is all so unnecessary.

1047
01:15:25,857 --> 01:15:28,200
If you had but minded your own
business, Mr Redan.

1048
01:15:28,235 --> 01:15:30,132
You have brought it upon yourself.

1049
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:32,897
You are not a good businessman,
Mr Goodhue.

1050
01:15:33,109 --> 01:15:35,495
You have had luck.

1051
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:38,579
Now, take that first encounter at La Paz...
- Shut upl

1052
01:16:37,098 --> 01:16:39,475
It had to be this way.
