And if there is one thing
that Sadie don't like,

371
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,109
is people breaking them.

372
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:40,517
The boss don't
like it much neither.

373
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,861

00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,370
<i>We're having ourselves
a hanging!</i>

375
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,604

you've done here.

379
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,634
Told you not to piss
Sadie off.

[Townsfolk muttering]

I was just wondering
if I could interview you.

You know, for the folks
back at home.

397

Who's the boss holed up
at the end of the street?

Can't or won't?

405
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,435
Uh, he doesn't share
his plans with me.

406
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,529
I write what
he wants me to write

407
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,097

he wants me to do.

Why are you so interested
in him anyway, lady?

410
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,879
Seems to me you've got
your own problems right now.

411
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,890
Got my reasons.

412

Oh!

415
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,532
Don't worry about

this little snitch.

417
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,540
He won't be taking

You're a Brimstone.

That mean
something to you?

Name's Rayne.

427
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,502
I'd shake your hand, but-

428
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,373
I understand.

429
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,674
I'm Muller.

430
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,614

I take it you're not here by accident.</i>

<i>No, I've been tracking Billy
clear from Cheyenne.</i>

432
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,483
Something weren't
quite right about him.

433
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,547
How's he like
as a gunfighter?

434
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,752
<i>Truth be told, he's not
much of a hand with a gun.</i>

435
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,091
He don't need to be.

436
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,996
He take bullets
like a boxer takes punches.

437
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,558
Are you saying
he heals himself?

438
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,900
It's the damnedest thing.

439
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,736
He don't even need to feed on
blood to heal himself.

440
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,138
He must be one old vampire.

441
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,374
He's the strongest
I've ever seen.

442
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,348
He's smart too.

443
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,686
He's got
leadership abilities.

444
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,816
Hell, I admire
the son of a bitch.

445
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,791
Let's see if we can
get you more comfortable.

446
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,492
Here, let me get these.

00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:18,635
Let me see your glasses.

448
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,867
Aah, be careful!
I just bought those!

449
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:29,109
What's this about
building up an army?

450
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,807
Well, we saw
that he was coming in

451
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,213
and attacking
the homesteads.

How many men he turn?

456
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:47,725
I figure he's got
30 vampire cowboys, I reckon.

<i>(Newton)
Uh, excuse me.</i>

00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,502
Turn them?

459

Vampire bites a man,

460
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,799
he'll turn into
a vampire himself.

461
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:02,478
Unless they rip his throat
out in the process.

462

<i>Wasn't until
they took over this town</i>

463

Do you mind?
You're in my light.

Me and my partner.

He was a Brimstone.

468
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,084
He rode off
to get some others.

I don't know how they knew.

They got me on account
of being his partner.

You ever figure out
what they were up to?

473
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:38,742
Well, the railroad's
coming to town

00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,478
next week, right?

475
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,180
Damn it, do you mind
giving me some space?!

476

I'm sorry, I'm just
not very good at this.

477
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,494
Of course.

<i>I figure he'll start here.</i>

482

<i>(Newton) But until the
rail service begins,</i>

he needs to keep things
looking normal.

486

<i>So that's why he took
all those kids hostage!</i>

487

something to feed on

Big speech, small guns.

1108
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,803
You overcompensating
for something?

1109
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:54,143
I'm sick
of your half-breed mouth.

1110
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:55,705

Let me see.
Are you all right?

When it's hard, you get screwed.

1141
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,660
When it's soft, you can't beat it.
