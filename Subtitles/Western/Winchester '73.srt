this far north?

332
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:28,460
I wouldn't know!
But he wants guns!

333
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,798
They all want repeaters
since the Little Big Horn!

334
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,169
Thought I'd clean up
and get out!

335

up Montana way!

at Little Big Horn?

Now, that gun there,

00:26:58,864 --> 00:27:01,765
I'd be willing to give you
300 in gold!!!

344

and let you take your pick
of six-guns and repeaters!

50 rounds of shells!

to fall outta that saddle!

rest up for a little?

gonna make any difference!

That's right!
We've never been
this close before!

that Young Bull's man
won't show up!

with those guns!

I'm down to $80!

to play poker with
if you fellas want cards!

at poker myself!

Still, if it's only
for a dollar or two--

363
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:31,513
Who knows? You might win
another 20 and have the price
of one gun! That the idea?

doesn't show!

for me to suggest that
we bed down for a while?

Nope!
That's what I thought!

When do we sleep?
As soon as we get to Riker's,
we'll sleep then!

he'd go to Riker's, providin'
he was goin' to Tascosa,

said they heard Dutch say
where he was going to!

to give mine back!
