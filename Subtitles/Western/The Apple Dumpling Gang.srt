That'd fit right into your plans.

- No shortage of applicants.

- There's my darling!
- Let me have her!

- What do you know about kids?
- And you?

507
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:42,715
- Let go, you'll hurt her!
- Ladies! This is a private party.

508

513
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:04,487
- They ripped my beautiful dress.
- I know, but we'll fix it. We'll fix it.

in this town!

515
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:14,580
- There's always Miss Clydesdale.
- Who's Miss Clydesdale? Dusty?

516
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,748
Mm-hmm.

517
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,252
- But she's not married.
- That's easy to fix.

518
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,338
Well, who can you get?

519
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,093
- You're not suggesting...
- Only for the kids!

520
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:31,430
- I know, but Dusty?
- She's a fine specimen of womanhood.

521
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:35,434
I saw her get caught in a cloudburst
once, and I can tell you...

522
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,772
Mr. Donavan, please marry Dusty!

523
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,613
No two people ever got married for
a more honorable or worthy cause.

527
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:13,139
If we go to Mrs. Stockley, will she hit us?

528
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,891
Why would she hit you?

529
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,809
She hits Mr. Stockley.

530
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,812
She might get mad
if we track mud in the house.

531
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,649
- Or forget to comb our hair.
- I'm sure she wouldn't do that.

532
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:29,488
When Mr. Stockley gets mad,
he uses words I never heard before.

533
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,324
Mr. Leach is meaner.

534
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:35,077
He'd put you in a sack and throw you
in the river for talking.

535
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,830
You won't be thrown in the river!

we'd sleep in his shed.

01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,956
Get to the oak tree near
Boot Hill at 12:00 sharp.

670
01:03:56,082 --> 01:04:01,086
- Thank you, your Honor.
- Don't thank him for hanging you!

671
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:04,422
- And bring your own rope.
- I'll get it.

672
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,425
- That's the only rope we've got.
- Get out of here!

673
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,594
- The hardware's closed.
- Dummy.

674
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,471
How can you be hung without a rope?

675
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:17,435
- Those dummies are liable to show up.
- Then they'll deserve it.

676
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,772
I want to get them out of town
for good.

677
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:24,776
The sooner the gold's out of here
and in the mint, the better.

678
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,487
A lot of people want that nugget.

679
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,158
Stillwell, we've been sitting here
for two days.

680
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,833
Staring at a bank through a spyglass
won't make us richer.

681
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:47,048
- Worried about the sheriff?
- With a down-home sheriff,

682
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:52,470
you get a town full of vigilantes. We
could be walking into a hornets' nest.

683
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,016
- We got to get the gold some time.
- We'll get it.

684
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:59,477
I didn't ride 200 miles
just to look at the scenery.

685
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,816
- Dang!
- Is your leg hurting again?

686
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,153
Always acts up on me,
every time the weather changes.

687
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:14,659
I'll tell you one thing. If I ever
get in shooting distance of Amos Tucker

688
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,163
he'll have windows where his ears was!

689
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,414
(LAUGHS)

690
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:41,561
- Homer, can we talk with you?
- As barber, sheriff or judge?

691
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,021
Judge.

692
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,026
- Two bits.
- I only got half a shave!

693
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,529
A shave's four bits. Now get,
before I fine you for loitering.

694
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:56,034
- Get! See you next Tuesday.
- All right.

695
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:02,207
Dusty?
You a willing party to this union?

696
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:06,378
They'll get a square deal
and a good home.

697
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:13,134
I never teamed prospects like you.
You're like ice cream and whiskey.

698
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:17,973
You'd be man and wife, like any couple,
and nobody could say different.

699
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,810
You kids make yourselves comfortable.

700
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:27,232
You want the trimmings?
Love, honor, cherish?

701
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,734
- I'd kind of like to hear it.
- Fine.

702
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,654
Well, let's just get it over with.

703
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,622
(INAUDIBLE)

704
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:48,753
- You got a ring?
- No.

705
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,256
We'll need a ring.

706
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,604
You hold this till I tell you.

707
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,985
Was you going to keep your hats on?

708
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,954
You take her, Donavan?

709
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,000
Yes!

710
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,504
- You take him, Dusty?
- I do.

711
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,801
The ring. Give it to Mr. Donavan.

712
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:50,523
By the powers invested in me,
the State of California,

713
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:51,900
I pronounce you hitched.

714
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:57,822
You don't have to kiss,
but you ought to at least shake on it.

715
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:04,412
That's it. I generally get $2
about this point.

716
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,919
I'll pay you back.

717
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:17,717
Since you two don't seem to
have immediate plans, I'm buying.

718
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:23,056
Oh, good! Dusty, would you mind
keeping an eye on the kids for a while?

719
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,352
Might as well get used to it.

720
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:34,484
- We'll celebrate, too.
- How come he's going that way

721
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:37,654
- and we're going this way?
- It's hard to explain.

722
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:44,369
Is that all, Miss Cole?
$4.62. I'll put it on your bill.

723
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:49,874
You can each have a licorice whip
and a jelly bean. But just one.

724
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,089
If you're here for the grain bags,
they're not here yet.

725
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,466
I need boots and jackets for the kids.

726
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,802
We'll look in the catalog.

727
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,763
- I see somebody bought the bed.
- Yep.

728
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,435
- Sure is pretty.
- Yes, sure is.

729
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,646
- Who'd you sell it to?
- Donavan.

730
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,525
- Who?
- Mr. Donavan.

731
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:19,654
- He picked it out this morning.
- Did he really?

732
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,575
Did he really!

733
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,132
Donavan!

734
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:44,387
You snake-oil salesman!
Are you coming out or not?

735
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:48,933
- Is there some trouble?
- Yes, and you're in it!

736
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,688
"I want a chance to leave!
Unencumbered, unfettered!"

737
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:57,233
- That's all I wanted.
- Don't slick-talk me!

738
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,030
Wait a minute, Dusty! Hold on!

739
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:03,740
Wait a minute!

740
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:12,373
Wait! Dusty, will you just let me
say one word?

741
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,958
- One!
- Dusty.

742
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,960
- That's it!
- No!

743
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,676
"Nothing's further from my mind.
You have my word as a gentleman."

744
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,053
I meant...

745
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:26,554
- Gentleman?
- Yeah!

746
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,272
No!

747
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:43,529
Get out from there, you coward!

748
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,448
A-ha!

749
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,243
No, Dusty. Back! Back!

750
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,786
- Don't!
- Stand still!

751
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,624
Wait a minute, Dusty!

752
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,960
No! Wait!

753
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:03,925
This is ridiculous. When you
get rational, we'll discuss this!

754
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,553
We'll discuss it right now!

755
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,061
Sorry, Ralph!

756
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:18,606
You're hysterical.
We can't talk this way!

757
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,359
- What happened?
- They got married.

758
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,154
- Be reasonable!
- Shut up, liar!

759
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,240
Whatever's happened, I can explain!

760
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,831
You're not getting out of it that easy!

761
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,041
Pay you back, Homer.

762
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,713
(STAMMERING)

763
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,299
- What's bothering you?
- That bed!

764
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,592
That great big brass bed!

765
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:50,054
If you don't intend exercising
your prerogatives,

766
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,140
why'd you buy that bed?

767
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:57,854
- That's it? The bed?
- Yes!

768
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:04,736
The bed happens to be
for the kids, Dusty.

769
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:09,741
With the nights getting colder,
they need a warmer place to sleep.

770
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:15,538
So the brass bed is for the boys
and the smaller bed is for Celia!

771
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,960
Why didn't you say so?

772
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,838
We could have avoided
this little misunderstanding!

773
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,722
Pardon me. Excuse me, please.

774
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:38,436
Come along, Celia.
This is no place for a lady.

775
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:48,279
(CROWD CLAMORING)

776
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,255
Order, order! Quiet now!

777
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:13,262
(GUN FIRES)

778
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:22,355
Everybody sit down and shut up.
Edgar, you get back in your seat!

779
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:31,489
I think we've heard all the testimony
this building can take!

780
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:37,078
I'm going to decide who gets
the children.

781
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:39,497
That decision will be final.

782
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:43,000
This court appreciates the generosity

783
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,963
and the kindness of all you good people

784
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,299
who have offered to provide homes
for these kids,

785
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:53,052
and to safeguard their assets.

786
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,888
It shows this town has got a heart.

787
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,974
But after deliberation,

788
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:01,602
considering all the facts
and the merits of the applicants,

789
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:07,942
this court awards
Bobby, Clovis and Celia Bradley

790
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,653
to Mr. and Mrs. Russel Donavan.

791

(CROWD CLAMORING UNHAPPILY)

792
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:17,493
It's an order of the court,
I won't discuss it.

793
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:20,288
I don't want people coming up here...

794
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,921
Hold up. I heard you were
about to gavel off my kin.

795
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,888
That's not necessary.
I'm here to claim them.

796
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,433
Donavan, thank you
for taking care of them.

797
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:46,022
My lawyer will explain
all the whereases and wherefores.

798
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:51,068
Tell them why the kids are mine,
and no maybes.

799
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,488
May it please the court...

800
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:57,283
It would please this court to see
both of you run out of town!

801
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:03,581
A checkered-pants lawyer doesn't
tell me the law! Give me that!

802
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,432
They're yours, Wintle.

803
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:26,979
You and that jackleg get out of here
before the court gets contemptuous.

804
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,315
Guess so, Reverend.

805
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:35,613
That gold's the most valuable shipment
ever entrusted to the Butterfly Line.

806
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:39,784
My goodness gracious!
The most valuable shipment!

807
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:44,914
My word! Exactly how much
does this nugget weigh?

808
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,000
356 pounds, without the crate.

809
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:51,837
That's not as large as the one
they found in Breckenridge.

810
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:55,550
Still, that's a whole lot of gold
all in one piece.

811
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,470
I assume you have
a lot of men protecting it.

812
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,932
There'll be extra guards
from Marysville tomorrow.

813
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:08,437
I see. Then you'll be making
your regular passenger run?

814
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:14,277
Fear not, dear brother.
I'm a servant of the Lord.

815
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:17,321
Being a man of the cloth,
it can do no harm.

816
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:24,704
We're taking it out when the bank
closes at 4:00 tomorrow.

817
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:30,751
They won't be going by the regular route
but over China Grade.

818
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,671
Splendid! Splendid idea!

819
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:40,052
I imagine that they'll not encounter
so much as a horn frog on that road.

820
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,929
I think it precisely.

821
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:46,976
- Reverend, could I buy you a drink?
- Thank you, no, sir. I never imbibe.

822
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:52,064
However, I would be happy to accept
this as a contribution for the poor.

823
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,776
Bless you, brother. Bless you.

824
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:13,252
Charley? I seem to have left my purse
at the office. I was...

825
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,964
Set them up for Charley and me.

826
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:25,348
- Hi, Dusty!
- Howdy.

827
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,440
Annulment papers. Bring them
to the Marysville courthouse.

828
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:36,192
It'll take about three days.

829
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,658
- We must have set a record.
- Yes.

830
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,371
You're rid of them. What now?

831
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:52,917
I'll work my way east.
Change of scenery and luck.

832
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,961
Dusty...

833
01:17:57,297 --> 01:18:02,760
- Thanks for what you did.

01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:50,465
Want to bet?

1002
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:00,850
Look, it's a hold-up!

1003
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,188
Whoa!

1004
01:39:11,111 --> 01:39:12,195
Hi!

1005
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:15,198
Didn't you promise you'd stop?

1006
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:17,158
We are stopping, Mr. Donavan.

1007
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:21,871
We've decided that we've been
the scourge of the West long enough.

1008
01:39:21,997 --> 01:39:24,374
We're hanging our firearms up for good.

1009
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:27,835
We were just wondering if...

1010
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,170
(STAMMERS)

1011
01:39:32,675 --> 01:39:34,008
Climb on!

1012
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:43,643
Will I be living with
these two lawless profligates?

1013
01:39:44,186 --> 01:39:46,896
Just till you hear from Mr. Gould, Pa.

1014
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:51,192
- That horse got a name?
- Lucy.

1015
01:39:51,318 --> 01:39:53,569
Lucy, Clarice. Clarice, Lucy.

1016
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:00,159
(LAUGHING)

1017
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:04,372
So they settled down together
Their troubles all behind

1018
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:07,583
Now that Donavan and Dusty
tied the knot

1019
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:13,256
Their friends wished them happiness
as the church bells rang

1020
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:17,385
For that family
called the Apple Dumpling Gang...

1021
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:21,931
CELIA: Mr. Donavan? I gotta go!

1022
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:27,103
And they called them
the Apple Dumpling Gang
