1
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,406
DAY OF ANGER

2
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:26,064
Morning, Mr Corbitt.

3
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,191
Have you got anything for me today?

4
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:30,402
No, Scott. And push off with that barrel.

5
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,696
My nose can't stand that awful stink.

6
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:35,865
Why, it's all from the respectable
citizens of Clifton.

7
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:37,993
Beat it.

8
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,301
(Cock crows)

9
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:58,596
(Chuckles)

10
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,823
Hey. You see that, Scott?

11
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:18,533
Even though I'm considered blind,

12
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,578
bet there's no-one with an aim
like that in all of Clifton. In fact,

13
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:23,663
in all Arizona.

14
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:27,042
You bet, Bill.
You're the best shot in all of the West.

15
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,845
You filthy tramp.

16
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,531
How many times do I have to tell you...

17
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:42,140
not to dirty my bottles?

18
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,225
I have to use them again.
And you know it.

19
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,396
Now, get out of here... or
I'll get rid of that other eye for you.

20
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,068
Bill didn't dirty 'em on purpose,
Mr Murray.

21
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,904
I'll wash the bottles.

22
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,864
Don't ever touch me again, you...

23
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,950
You ugly son of a bitch!

24
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,078
(Dog barks)

25
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:07,957
- I wonder what's up.
- Uh-huh.

26
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,960
Why, it's years since we've heard
any shooting like that in Clifton.

27
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:14,464
Who fired that shot?
A bonehead or a boozer?

28
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,383
It's nothing serious.

29
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:19,803
Mr Murray sizzled buckshot
in our old friend Bill's behind.

30
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:22,013
(All chuckle)

31
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:26,434
Where are you going?
There's the barrel to empty.

32
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,144
Don't pass this way.
You'll stink up the saloon.

33
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:30,313
Back the other way.

34
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,945
Mr Murray, I thought
I heard some shooting.

35
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,948
It was me, Nigel. To clean out the barrel.

36
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:44,077
You should do the same, every so often,
if you can still find your gun.

37
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:48,289
Well, I'm the law here.

38
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:51,459
This, in Clifton,
is worth more than fancy hardware.

39
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,258
Whoa. Morning, doctor.

40
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:00,552
Where have you been
so bright and early?

41
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:04,973
I had a rough night of it, between
a birth and a bad case of diarrhoea.

42
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,516
No complications, I hope.

43
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:09,978
About the birth, I think
you should ask Hart Perkins.

44
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:12,647
His wife had two little boys.

45
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:17,110
As for the case of diarrhoea, it was
that old mare of Judge Cutcher's.

46
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:28,913
Scott...

47
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:30,623
when you're finished your rounds,

48
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:33,835
take your broom and go and sweep
in front of Skill's house, you hear'?

49
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:37,172
Yes, Mr Miller.

50
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,850
(Cock crows)

51
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:33,454
(Cock crows)

52
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,876
- Hiya, Gwen.
- How are you?

53
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,878
I haven't seen you for a long time.

54
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:50,930
Show too much and you can't sell it.

55
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,099
And you...

56
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:54,475
Have you come here to gawk?

57
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,394
Now get busy with that broom.

58
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,563
When you're finished, come to me.

59
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:00,356
I'll give you a quarter.

60
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,233
Thanks a lot, Vivian.

61
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:04,694
I don't want anything for doing it.

62
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:07,071
I don't forget how much
you did for me, when I was here.

63
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:11,159
(Chuckles) You were just
a babe in arms, Scott.

64
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:24,399
Are you looking for something?

65
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,650
A stable.

66
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:29,445
Ah, yes. There's Miller's stable
at the far end of the street.

67
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,698
You can't miss it.

68
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,033
And where can I sleep... and sleep good?

69
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:37,245
There at the saloon.
You passed by it just now.

70
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,872
Gambling house and hotel,
bar and a restaurant.

71
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:41,582
You'll like it.

72
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:43,918
You want to earn a dollar?

73
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,464
Take my horse to the stable.

74
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:49,590
Yes, sir.

75
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:54,053
What's your name?

76
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:56,848
- Scott.
- Scott what?

77
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,226
Only Scott.

78
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:02,353
Because of my mother.

79
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,397
I never did know her.

80
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,152
And what was her name?

81
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:12,113
Her first name was Mary.

82
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,198
Mary.

83
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:16,576
It's as good as any other name.

84
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:18,494
Why not call yourself "Scott Mary"?

85
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:22,749
They'd all laugh at me,
if I said my name was "Scott Mary".

86
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,834
So what?

87
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:31,591
Who knows for sure
whether they'd laugh at it?

88
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,510
When you get my horse settled,
come on over to the saloon

89
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:36,429
and pick up your dollar.

90
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,682
My name's Talby.

91
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:25,853
Another job, Murph.

92
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,356
Take good care of him.

93
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:31,484
I've already earned a dollar
just for bringing him here.

94
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:36,823
Look at that saddle.
First-class leather. Worked by hand.

95
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,368
What are you going to do with that dollar?

96
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,495
Why, I'm saving it.

97
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,206
With this, I already have eight.

98
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,960
And when I save another ten,
I'll be buying a Colt at the emporium.

99
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:51,379
And what will you do with it, sonny?

100
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,131
The days of fast guns are over.

101
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:57,677
Once upon a time, a good pistol
was worth more than money in the bank.

102
00:12:57,802 --> 00:13:00,388
When Doc Holliday
of the OK Corral died,

103
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,100
there was a real massacre
of people trying to get hold of his gun.

104
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:07,478
Doc Holliday was
the best shot in all the West.

105
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:08,771
Him, not his pistol.

106
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:12,066
Him AND his pistol.

107
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,152
There can be the experience
of a lifetime in a gun.

108
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,989
It's not enough to be able
to draw faster than the other guy,

109
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:21,075
if the other guy knows a trick
that you don't know.

110
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,579
In my day, we had to
either learn the tricks

111
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,582
or we gave work to the gravediggers.

112
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:30,376
I'll buy myself a Colt
and I'm going to wear it.

113
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:34,046
I want to see if anyone'll still
have the courage to call me a bastard.

114
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:36,299
The one I got now is wood,

115
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,634
but it's better than pushing an old broom.

116
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,802
Right, Murph?

117
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:42,763
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't just damn stupid

118
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,725
when I taught you how to draw.

119
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,728
Do the job well, because
this Talby might give you a dollar...

120
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:50,396
Talby?

121
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:52,899
Yeah. The name of the stranger.

122
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:54,817
Talby?

123
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:59,113
I think I've heard that name before.

124
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,407
You have, eh?

125
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:04,535
Not in this town, though.
Not in Clifton.

126
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:18,382
They're very pretty. Too bad. In
a few days, they're gonna be dead.

127
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:20,760
My pa doesn't want
you to speak to me.

128
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:22,637
Ever again.

129
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:24,597
Eileen.

130
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:26,474
Eileen.

131
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,361
Oh, good morning, Judge Cutcher.

132
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:41,072
L...you see... l...

133
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:46,869
You're a good boy, Scott...

134
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:49,372
but you're an illegitimate bastard.

135
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:52,792
Your mother
was one of Vivian Skill's girls

136
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:57,672
and your father...
Who knows who your father was?

137
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:01,175
That's always been
a pretty popular house.

138
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,553
You mustn't raise your eyes
to look at my daughter.

139
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,472
Mind that.

140
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:09,392
You must never talk to her.

141
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,728
And you must never stop here again.

142
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:14,772
Beat it!

143
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,565
Is that clear?

144
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:18,818
Beat it.

145
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,237
(Horse's footsteps)

146
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:46,345
(Laughter)

147
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:54,228
(Man) Good old Perkins. Two little
Perkinses, all at one blow.

148
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,063
Good for you.

149
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:58,607
To the health of your twins.

150
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,405
(Man) Have another one.

151
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,491
(Man 2) Thanks, fellas. Now all
I gotta do is worry about feeding 'em.

152
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,243
(Laughter)

153
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,008
(Man 3) Didn't think you had it in you...

154
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:13,539
(Man 2) Now, here's to the next litter.

155
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:18,252
There's your dollar.

156
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:24,508
Sit down.

157
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:33,934
It's all right.

158
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,853
Sit down.

159
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,653
Would you like a whiskey, Scott Mary?

160
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:46,322
Yeah...

161
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,704
What are you doing here?

162
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,372
He's my guest.

163
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:57,875
He wants a whiskey.

164
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,919
You're not from around here.

165
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:01,378
He cleans the toilets.

166
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:03,089
And collects the garbage.

167
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:06,842
Why, he sweeps the sidewalk.
Sometimes even the saloon.

168
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,177
He can't sit down here.

169
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:10,805
So, if he wants to drink,
he's got to go to the kitchen.

170
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,016
- He ain't the kind of customer...
- (Talby) A whiskey.

171
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:18,270
(Grunts)

172
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:22,942
All right.

173
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,785
Chuck him out, Abel.

174
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,037
Or should I do it?

175
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:38,165
You don't want to make us drink
with that garbage man, do you?

176
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,255
Didn't you hear that?

177
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,965
Get outta here!

178
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,432
Scott Mary is my guest.

179
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,770
My guests drink with me
as long as I or they please.

180
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,898
Listen, stranger.
Clifton is our city.

181
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:05,442
We don't want anyone to boss us around.

182
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:08,487
If you don't watch out, I'm gonna punch
your teeth out and throw you outta here.

183
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:10,948
- Get out!
- You'll have to use your gun.

184
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,244
- Right now.
- (Murray) No!

185
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:34,180
You'll testify that I fired
only after he aimed his gun at me.

186
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:38,058
Perkins was a braggart and a bully

187
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,311
but he never tried to shoot anyone.

188
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:43,647
Now, how was I supposed to know that?
A gun is not a toy.

189
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:54,241
Drink up, Scott Mary.

190
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,828
I don't like to hang around a dead man.

191
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:02,917
(Chokes)

192
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:10,716
That your first?

193
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,512
You better have another drink
to keep it company.

194
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,349
Silence.

195
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:20,643
Silence!

196
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,519
Silence.

197
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:29,652
Having heard the witnesses,

198
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,904
I, Judge Cutcher,

199
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:34,448
in the name of the law proclaim

200
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,244
that Hart Perkins died
in the course of an unprovoked attack,

201
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:43,749
during which, Mr Frank Talby
exercised his right of self-defence.

202
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:46,293
(Chatter)

203
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:51,465
We'll teach you to keep in your place.

204
00:19:57,972 --> 00:19:59,640
(Man) Just one more question.

205
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:03,811
First man you ever killed, Talby?

206
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,647
That is, I mean, in self-defence, uh?

207
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:09,650
No, it wasn't my first one, Nigel.

208
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,652
You want me to put notches on my gun?

209
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,407
The hearing is closed.

210
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,593
Just a minute, you...

211
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:40,764
Wait... and hit him outside.

212
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,569
What the law doesn't see, it can't punish.

213
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,977
This'll teach you to keep in your place.

214
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:50,441
And don't dirty my saloon
with your filthy presence.

215
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:52,609
(Scott groans)

216
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:56,572
You'll be needing lessons, Scott.
For your own good.

217
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:59,116
And this is for poor Perkins.

218
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,076
Those twins were born just yesterday.

219
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:03,537
Hold it, Murray.
The boy had nothing to do with it.

220
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,123
Go back to the stable, you old fool.

221
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,925
You'd better run, Scott.

222
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:18,927
When they arrive,
they'll get Talby.

223
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,232
I guess he's gone.

224
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:14,650
We'll catch up with him, Sartana.

225
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:16,985
Come on.

226
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:57,776
(Gees horse)

227
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:00,487
Come on, Sartana. Come on!

228
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,419
(Gees horse)

229
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:00,923
Come on Sartana. Let's go.

230
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,260
(Gees horse)

231
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:14,603
(Horse snorts)

232
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:18,732
Damn it all, Sartana.
It's because of you we lost him again.

233
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:23,487
- Come on, you stupid mule.
- (Man) Hold it...

234
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:27,407
I don't like people
to mistreat their animals.

235
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:35,999
But...

236
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:38,710
(Horse snorts)

237
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:43,799
You been following me, kid.

238
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:53,350
You better come up with a good
excuse or it may be your last one.

239
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,814
I had to escape.

240
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,524
They were out for my blood.

241
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:02,776
Now that's no excuse.

242
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:05,404
I want to get to be like you.

243
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,533
I know how to draw,
but I've never had a real pistol.

244
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:11,827
If I'm taught right,
I'm pretty bright.

245
00:25:11,952 --> 00:25:14,871
I'd be useful to you
as a sort of partner.

246
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:20,627
Maybe.

247
00:25:21,628 --> 00:25:22,963
All right.

248
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,965
First lesson...

249
00:25:26,174 --> 00:25:27,968
Never beg another man.

250
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,053
You'll take me with you?

251
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,181
How much money you've got?

252
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:34,558
Eight dollars.

253
00:25:34,683 --> 00:25:37,686
Give it to me.
It'll be useful for your second lesson.

254
00:25:57,914 --> 00:26:00,000
Second lesson...

255
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,127
Never trust anyone.

256
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:14,473
Come on, Sartana.

257
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:17,601
We gotta go and hear that third lesson.

258
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:01,079
(Laughter)

259
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:48,543
What's that?

260
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:50,504
Tequila, sefior.

261
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,506
You see, it's the only thing we got here.

262
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,799
It wets your throat.

263
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:57,427
Round here, everybody takes
a glass before taking a trip.

264
00:28:57,552 --> 00:28:59,846
Well, my trip ends here.

265
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,389
You go tell that to Wild Jack.

266
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,476
My name's Talby.

267
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:17,906
Right away, sefior.

268
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,922
Hey. Listen, stranger...

269
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:35,757
- What town is this?
- Bowie...

270
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:39,553
- Bowie. At least for now.
- For now? Why?

271
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,973
Because it's gonna be
hell here, pretty soon.

272
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:47,811
Wild. Wild. Wild.

273
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:19,593
Third lesson...

274
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,137
Never get between a gun and its target.

275
00:30:57,714 --> 00:30:59,132
Hello, Wild.

276
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,718
Come on in.

277
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,138
You're back, huh?

278
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:14,105
It would've been better
if you hadn't come here, Talby.

279
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,316
Don't be a pessimist.

280
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:18,151
You never can tell.

281
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:20,987
I said that for your own good.

282
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:24,366
(Talby laughs)

283
00:31:26,034 --> 00:31:28,828
I'm not after revenge, Wild.

284
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:32,207
Give me my 50,000 dollars,
we'll be friends again.

285
00:31:32,332 --> 00:31:33,959
You can believe it or not...

286
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:37,879
I don't have one lousy, stinking dollar.

287
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:40,465
I just got outta jail three weeks ago.

288
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,551
I know that.

289
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:46,262
I've been waiting ten years
to give you the bill.

290
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:50,850
You lost your money.
I spent ten years in jail.

291
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,560
That's your business.

292
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:56,523
In order to pull this deal, I had to
bring in certain people from Clifton.

293
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:00,276
If you're gonna tell me your life
story, why don't you sit down?

294
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:07,617
We were all set to pull a job in Abilene.

295
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:10,161
The Clifton people had clean hands.

296
00:32:10,286 --> 00:32:11,913
They only passed on the information.

297
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:13,289
They said they were going to alibi for me.

298
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:15,135
Everything was perfect,
there were no risks.

299
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,002
We were to split the
money down the middle.

300
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:19,462
And those clean hands tricked you.

301
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:21,756
You're damn right they did.

302
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:23,383
They testified against me.

303
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,051
The money disappeared.

304
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,219
Well, what could I do?

305
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,762
My word against a banker?

306
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:33,101
A judge? The rest of those...
honest, rich bastards?

307
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:36,604
And, so, my 50,000 ended up
in their pockets too.

308
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,898
Exactly.

309
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,526
Well, why don't you go to Clifton now?

310
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:43,570
Take your revenge, if you have to.

311
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,698
But get the money that's owed to you
and then you can pay your debt to me.

312
00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:48,241
I got a price on my head.

313
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,202
They're looking for me all over Arizona.

314
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:54,456
I'm here in Bowie...
but I got one foot in Mexico.

315
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:56,041
All right...

316
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,835
I'll tell you what we can do.

317
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,504
You get me the names
of those people in Clifton

318
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:04,007
and you go on down to Mexico...

319
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:05,633
and you stay there.

320
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,177
What are you gonna do?

321
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:10,722
Let's say I'm buying
you revenge for $50,000.

322
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:14,851
Then the honest people of Clifton can
owe their debt to Frank Talby instead.

323
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:16,895
How's that?

324
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,688
Or else?

325
00:33:19,272 --> 00:33:22,233
Or else... you have to pay.

326
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:24,652
One way or another.

327
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:34,204
All right, Talby.

328
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:36,164
I can't argue with you.

329
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,374
You're too fast.

330
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:40,960
Drinks for everyone.

331
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,093
I want to celebrate
the return of an old friend.

332
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,887
Everybody drink.

333
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:01,356
You ain't drinking?

334
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:03,066
Not yet, Wild.

335
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,861
Maybe you're telling the truth...
and maybe you're not.

336
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,865
If everything goes all right,
I'll drink to your health.

337
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:13,827
In Clifton.

338
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,163
You think you're pretty
funny, don't you, Talby?

339
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:22,127
Well... we'll drink, amigos.

340
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:23,670
To Wild Jack's health.

341
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,512
Here...

342
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,556
No.

343
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:37,976
You ain't drinking either?

344
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:39,686
No. I'm with him.

345
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,622
We'll teach ya how to drink in Bowie.

346
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:04,419
- Now we'll see if you drink.
- (Groans)

347
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,929
That's enough, Wild.

348
00:36:08,274 --> 00:36:10,276
<i>Vengan.</i>

349
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,251
Fourth lesson.

350
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:27,585
Punches are like bullets.

351
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,714
If you don't make the first ones count,
Scottie, you might just be finished.

352
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,884
I'll remember that.

353
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,484
And now what?

354
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,113
Wait for him at Bill Farrell's place.

355
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:57,991
Hey, Wild Jack.
What's the matter with you?

356
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,827
Why in hell don't we
take care of that man now?

357
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,162
If I get the chance,
I'll take care of him.

358
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:06,874
The rest of you get going. Hurry.

359
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:40,491
Wild.

360
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:02,138
You're forgetting something, Wild. I still
want the names of those people in Clifton.

361
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:06,225
I ain't forgetting nothing.

362
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,729
There was Turner, the banker.

363
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,856
He knew about the shipment of gold.

364
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:17,320
Judge Cutcher.

365
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:20,031
He was gonna alibi for me.

366
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:23,076
Abel Murray. He was driving the train.

367
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:27,205
Bill Farrell. He was
in command of the garrison.

368
00:38:27,997 --> 00:38:30,500
He's got a ranch now.

369
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,627
Out Stafford way.

370
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:57,860
No.

371
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:59,570
No, Frank.

372
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:00,613
Don't kill me.

373
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,281
(Cocks gun)

374
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,408
No!

375
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,618
You can't kill him. You can't kill him.

376
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:38,025
Fifth lesson.

377
00:39:38,151 --> 00:39:40,945
You wound a man, you better kill him.

378
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,738
Or sooner or later he's gonna kill you.

379
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:39,021
(Horse snorts)

380
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,408
Bill Farrell?

381
00:42:48,507 --> 00:42:50,301
(Man) Put your hands up.

382
00:42:50,426 --> 00:42:53,429
If you make a move,
you're a dead man.

383
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:59,060
Wild Jack responsible for this?

384
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:01,771
And you're gonna be next.

385
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,292
Your gun.

386
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,138
Come on.

387
00:43:43,145 --> 00:43:45,523
Now you're going for a nice little ride.

388
00:43:45,648 --> 00:43:47,066
(Laughter)

389
00:43:55,408 --> 00:43:56,826
(Yelping)

390
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:35,698
One more time!
(Laughter)

391
00:44:57,052 --> 00:44:59,764
Well, turn around! Turn around!

392
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,781
Whose mule is that?

393
00:45:16,906 --> 00:45:18,240
(Laughter)

394
00:45:26,582 --> 00:45:27,666
(Piercing whistle)

395
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:43,891
Sixth lesson.

396
00:45:44,016 --> 00:45:45,810
The right bullet at the right time.

397
00:45:45,935 --> 00:45:47,228
And well-aimed.

398
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:48,979
Bravo, Scott Mary.

399
00:45:49,104 --> 00:45:50,940
Bravo.

400
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:53,359
Looks like I owe you my life.

401
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:54,485
You owe me nothing.

402
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,486
But...

403
00:45:55,611 --> 00:45:57,196
take me along, will you?

404
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,576
Seventh lesson...

405
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,789
If you untie a man...
take his gun before that.

406
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:11,752
Eighth lesson...

407
00:46:11,877 --> 00:46:15,256
Don't give a man any more bullets
than what he's got use for.

408
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:23,013
Very good.

409
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:25,599
All right, Scott.

410
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:27,601
You can come with me.

411
00:46:27,726 --> 00:46:30,729
But don't get your hopes up
too high 'cause it's a dirty life.

412
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,115
(Woman) Hi, Scott.

413
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,658
(Scott) Howdy.

414
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,783
Er... what... what can I do for you, sir?

415
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:26,952
I want to see all the pistols you've got.

416
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,288
P...pistols?

417
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,332
Yes. Pistols.

418
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:34,251
Yes, yes... Yes. Certainly, sir.

419
00:47:34,376 --> 00:47:37,379
Pistols. Right away, sir.

420
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:07,701
See how it feels in your hand.

421
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:15,834
All right, let's see how
that gun belt fits.

422
00:48:18,087 --> 00:48:19,588
Put it on.

423
00:48:29,348 --> 00:48:32,351
All right. We'll take the works,
plus a hundred bullets. How much?

424
00:48:36,355 --> 00:48:40,776
The pistol and the gun belt
come to...$50.

425
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:44,279
But the bullets... All
I got is three dozen.

426
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:47,992
Well, we'll take what you have, but
you'd better get some more in stock.

427
00:48:48,117 --> 00:48:51,495
They're gonna be very popular
in a few days.

428
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,164
Now, there's six for the gun.

429
00:48:54,289 --> 00:48:56,917
Er... they're... mine? All mine?

430
00:48:57,042 --> 00:48:59,044
Even the pistol, huh?

431
00:49:01,547 --> 00:49:03,549
Load it.

432
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:16,020
Now, let's see if it's worth the expense.

433
00:49:17,896 --> 00:49:20,482
Yes, good day, sir.

434
00:49:33,245 --> 00:49:35,039
Your belt's too high.

435
00:49:35,164 --> 00:49:38,000
Put the butt of your gun
down by your wrist.

436
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,543
Like so.

437
00:49:40,753 --> 00:49:42,838
That all right?

438
00:49:42,963 --> 00:49:45,632
See what you can do
with that sign up there.

439
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:00,647
Good.

440
00:50:00,773 --> 00:50:02,232
You didn't waste a shot.

441
00:50:02,357 --> 00:50:05,444
Mr Talby, how could you
have aimed six bullets like that?

442
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,322
Go slowly at first.
You don't hammer a hammer.

443
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:09,948
Just fan her.

444
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:12,367
It's all of 20 years that sign's there.

445
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:14,953
What's going on here?
What's all this rumpus?

446
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,955
You better get your horse and disappear.

447
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:21,293
Listen Talby. I warn you:
Perkins' friends have sworn to get you.

448
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,754
Take it easy, Marshal.

449
00:50:23,879 --> 00:50:26,715
If I need any assistance,
I can hire my own.

450
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,134
You won't find anyone.

451
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,053
You want to try me, Mr Talby?

452
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:34,431
Now, get, Scott,
before my patience begins to wear out.

453
00:50:34,556 --> 00:50:39,144
Marshal, that's how it started
with Hart Perkins.

454
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:43,440
- You mean to threaten?
- No. Only a warning.

455
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:55,327
Whether they show up or not.

456
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,628
You've sold your life
for very little, Scott.

457
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,523
Mr Turner.

458
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,317
Well, welcome back, Mr Talby.

459
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:29,069
And what brings you here?

460
00:51:29,194 --> 00:51:30,654
It's a matter of money.

461
00:51:30,779 --> 00:51:32,406
You wish to make a deposit?

462
00:51:32,531 --> 00:51:34,533
No. A withdrawal.

463
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,368
But...

464
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:37,870
you've no account.

465
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:41,248
You've no account open here, Mr Talby.

466
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:43,792
I don't, but Wild Jack does.

467
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:47,379
But, er...

468
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,132
- Well, Wild Jack...
- Sh...

469
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:52,968
(Chuckles) Wild Jack is dead.

470
00:51:53,093 --> 00:51:55,294
But the account is still open
and I've come to close it.

471
00:51:57,306 --> 00:51:59,308
Er, what do you mean, sir?

472
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,562
Bill Farrell is dead too.

473
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:06,648
But before he died,
he signed a confession

474
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:09,902
in which he listed all the names
of his accomplices,

475
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:12,821
including yours.

476
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:14,907
Mr Talby...

477
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:18,744
What's the...

478
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,287
the amount of the withdrawal?

479
00:52:20,412 --> 00:52:21,872
A thousand dollars.

480
00:52:21,997 --> 00:52:23,999
One thousand?

481
00:52:26,668 --> 00:52:28,670
Gimme a thousand.

482
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:34,468
Here you are.

483
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:40,265
And... now may I have that...

484
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,017
that document?

485
00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:45,437
For so little? What do you take me for?

486
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,105
Thank you.

487
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,233
My money's safe with you.

488
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,409
Something wrong, Mr Turner?

489
00:52:59,534 --> 00:53:02,162
Go call Abel Murray
and Judge Cutcher. Immediately.

490
00:53:02,287 --> 00:53:03,705
Yes, sir.

491
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:14,341
Wait. Just a moment.

492
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:25,227
For Abel Murray,
it's much too late, I'm afraid.

493
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:26,853
Go and call the judge.

494
00:53:26,979 --> 00:53:28,981
- Tell him to get here right away.
- Yes.

495
00:53:55,382 --> 00:53:56,758
What does that mean?

496
00:53:56,883 --> 00:54:00,262
We're partners.
Fifty-fifty, this whole place.

497
00:54:04,016 --> 00:54:06,184
For a thousand dollars?

498
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,894
I know I'm generous.

499
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,647
I'm paying for something
that's already mine.

500
00:54:10,772 --> 00:54:13,233
But Mr Talby...

501
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:15,068
If this is a joke...

502
00:54:15,193 --> 00:54:18,113
This is no joke.
I lost my sense of humour.

503
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,492
I inherited my half from Wild Jack.

504
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,372
I'm somebody in Clifton now.

505
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,249
I've got a bank account now...

506
00:54:29,374 --> 00:54:31,376
half a saloon...

507
00:54:33,462 --> 00:54:36,923
...and these scales of justice will
be leaning the way I tell them to

508
00:54:37,049 --> 00:54:40,010
and you just watch the way I tell them to.

509
00:54:40,135 --> 00:54:41,595
Now sign.

510
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,766
What...

511
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:49,311
- What is this?
- It's a contract of partnership.

512
00:54:50,145 --> 00:54:53,899
- But...
- Bill Farrell talked.

513
00:54:54,066 --> 00:54:56,443
And you sign it
or tomorrow you end up in the gallows.

514
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:17,130
Good.

515
00:55:17,255 --> 00:55:18,924
Got a room for me?

516
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:22,052
- I'm boss now.
- Number seven.

517
00:55:23,804 --> 00:55:25,806
What did you make me sign?

518
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,560
A nice, complete, detailed confession.

519
00:55:37,192 --> 00:55:38,610
They're coming, Scott Mary.

520
00:55:39,861 --> 00:55:42,447
All those people that are
locked up in their houses.

521
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,493
The Perkins ranch is to the north

522
00:55:46,618 --> 00:55:48,328
so they should be coming
from down there.

523
00:55:49,204 --> 00:55:51,206
Scott, remember...

524
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:53,667
A man on horseback has
to divide his attention between

525
00:55:53,792 --> 00:55:55,877
his horse and his gun.

526
00:55:56,002 --> 00:55:58,797
So you cannot let them dismount.

527
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,962
Now, find yourself a spot
in the shadows over there,

528
00:56:01,007 --> 00:56:03,009
where you can't be seen.

529
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:08,390
- You want me to shoot?
- Don't shoot until after I do.

530
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,060
And when you shoot, shoot fast.

531
00:56:12,185 --> 00:56:14,563
And hit your target.

532
00:56:16,398 --> 00:56:17,816
Uh-huh.

533
00:57:22,297 --> 00:57:23,715
(Barking)

534
00:57:34,976 --> 00:57:36,269
(Taps Pipe)

535
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,451
(Footsteps)

536
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,059
Your boys on the watch, huh?

537
00:58:16,184 --> 00:58:18,937
Where have you put
your little errand boy?

538
00:58:21,147 --> 00:58:23,900
You'd better step aside
a little. They're coming.

539
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:25,986
(Horses' footsteps)

540
00:58:35,287 --> 00:58:36,913
Give yourself up, Talby.

541
00:58:37,038 --> 00:58:40,125
Listen, men.
I want you all to be law-abiding.

542
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,794
There's been a trial
and Frank Talby was acquitted.

543
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,255
You're putting yourself
right smack against the law.

544
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,674
So clear out of here
or I'll put you in jail.

545
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:50,885
Since when you protecting killers
with your shiny star?

546
00:58:51,011 --> 00:58:52,887
You'd better listen to me, Mackenzie.

547
00:58:53,013 --> 00:58:54,764
Remember what happened to Hart.

548
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:57,225
He met the wrong man
and had a bad end.

549
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:59,853
Why listen to this fool'?
Let's get it over with.

550
00:58:59,978 --> 00:59:02,022
We didn't come here
to listen to his blabber.

551
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:04,232
Come on, let's make this Talby dance!

552
00:59:04,357 --> 00:59:07,611
Better get out of here. He's spread
his men around. He's set a trap.

553
00:59:07,736 --> 00:59:10,238
- Go to the devil, will you?
- (Cocks gun)

554
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:12,240
You stay back.

555
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:26,630
What are you waiting for?

556
00:59:40,518 --> 00:59:42,520
(Man) What's going on here...

557
00:59:45,273 --> 00:59:46,816
Good work, Scottie.

558
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:48,818
Now, nobody will dare get in your way.

559
00:59:48,943 --> 00:59:51,279
- Not in this town.
- But... you're wounded.

560
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:55,742
No problem. It's just on the left side.

561
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:57,619
(Marshal) Four dead and two wounded.

562
00:59:57,744 --> 01:00:00,288
I want to know
what the devil you want, Talby.

563
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:03,375
I only shot after
they knocked you down, Marshal.

564
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,171
Scott...

565
01:00:08,296 --> 01:00:10,840
I think this town is ours.

566
01:00:42,122 --> 01:00:44,374
Nothing more to be done
for these two, Judge.

567
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:45,750
Absolutely unbelievable.

568
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,836
- Unbelievable.
- Aye...

569
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:50,964
You'll have to acquit
him again, I'm afraid, Judge.

570
01:01:00,098 --> 01:01:02,976
- Where is he?
- (Groaning)

571
01:01:03,101 --> 01:01:04,686
You've taken plenty of time.

572
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:05,937
My friend is wounded.

573
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,773
This one's much worse!

574
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:15,155
That's one of the men
who attacked us.

575
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,657
Scott. You've been drinking.

576
01:01:17,782 --> 01:01:20,201
Don't touch me, you bastard.

577
01:01:20,326 --> 01:01:23,997
I'll not be sweeping in front of your
house again. You can bet on that.

578
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,292
Now, get out, you bastard, you!

579
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,464
What did you do to him?

580
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:34,591
He's acting like some rabid wolf.

581
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,845
He was born a wolf.

582
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,513
You made him rabid, not me.

583
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:44,267
Good boy, Scott Mary.

584
01:01:44,392 --> 01:01:46,019
You've always been underestimated.

585
01:01:46,144 --> 01:01:49,981
I'm the first to recognise it
and to ask you to excuse me.

586
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,191
Bring me the broom.

587
01:01:53,234 --> 01:01:56,154
- What?
- I said the broom.

588
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,448
The same one you gave me
to sweep this pigsty.

589
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,533
(Groaning)

590
01:02:02,994 --> 01:02:05,914
Scott... go back to the stable.

591
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:17,091
After you, Marshal.

592
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:19,010
Pigs go before.

593
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,471
- I'm gonna show you...
- Marshal...

594
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:24,474
Don't go anything foolish. Not now.

595
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:26,851
What you been needing
is a beating, Scott.

596
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,186
With a big, big stick.

597
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,940
A big stick, huh?

598
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:34,067
I used to have one once.

599
01:02:34,192 --> 01:02:36,110
Watch this.

600
01:02:36,236 --> 01:02:37,529
Hold it, Murray.

601
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:39,489
(Murray) No!

602
01:02:42,784 --> 01:02:44,244
Mm...

603
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:47,914
Scott...

604
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:52,752
This isn't what I wanted for you.

605
01:02:52,877 --> 01:02:54,170
Come away.

606
01:02:54,295 --> 01:02:57,632
Go to hell. All of you!

607
01:03:06,266 --> 01:03:08,560
You're pretty damn fast, Scott Mary.

608
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:11,646
- Not bad.
- May I go and take care of the other one?

609
01:03:11,771 --> 01:03:13,189
Go ahead.

610
01:03:16,776 --> 01:03:19,487
Was he your friend? He the one
that showed you how to draw?

611
01:03:20,154 --> 01:03:24,325
- Yes, that was him. Murph Allan.
- Murph Allan?

612
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:28,288
That's right. He works in the stable
down the street. Ron Miller's.

613
01:03:30,456 --> 01:03:32,458
Murph Allan SHORT.

614
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:36,337
NOW I remember.

615
01:03:36,462 --> 01:03:40,049
He's gotten so old
he can't wear a gun anymore, huh?

616
01:03:40,174 --> 01:03:42,719
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

617
01:03:42,844 --> 01:03:44,345
He was a marshal in Abilene once.

618
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:47,432
Ran me out of town
with a rifle at my back.

619
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,358
It was a long time ago,
but I won't forget it.

620
01:03:49,934 --> 01:03:51,352
You know, maybe he was right.

621
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,106
I should take your gun away
and send you back to the stable.

622
01:03:58,943 --> 01:04:00,194
Don't try it, Talby.

623
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,988
It's too late.

624
01:04:04,198 --> 01:04:06,159
Yeah.

625
01:04:06,284 --> 01:04:08,036
It's too late.

626
01:04:34,729 --> 01:04:36,105
(Man) Oh...

627
01:04:43,321 --> 01:04:44,989
Are there any arrivals for me?

628
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,950
I think so, Miss Vivian.

629
01:04:56,334 --> 01:04:57,961
Howdy.

630
01:04:58,086 --> 01:05:01,547
I'm Vivian Skill. Would you follow me'?
Your rooms are all ready.

631
01:05:01,673 --> 01:05:04,258
Here's your consignment
of bullets, Mrs Barton.

632
01:05:15,228 --> 01:05:18,481
I want this building to stretch
back just as far as it'll go

633
01:05:18,606 --> 01:05:22,443
because I want to be able
to fit in that 30-foot bar that we've got.

634
01:05:22,568 --> 01:05:24,362
This is very important.

635
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:28,157
Of course, Mr Talby.
We'll make it as big as you want.

636
01:05:28,282 --> 01:05:32,370
All right. Now... I'll tell you
what I want to do for my house.

637
01:06:03,776 --> 01:06:05,194
(Man gees horses)

638
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:41,105
You've made yourself
a lot of enemies, Mr Talby.

639
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:47,820
Thanks.

640
01:07:04,504 --> 01:07:06,964
Been hit, Talby?

641
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:10,093
(Chuckles) The old wound
hasn't healed yet.

642
01:07:15,973 --> 01:07:18,017
Who was he?

643
01:07:18,142 --> 01:07:20,770
Is he with us or against us?

644
01:07:20,895 --> 01:07:22,897
Why did he save your life?

645
01:07:23,648 --> 01:07:24,816
Pretty soon we'll find out.

646
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:35,701
Gentlemen...

647
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,710
Owen, what's the idea?

648
01:07:45,336 --> 01:07:47,630
Why did you save
the life of that man, Owen?

649
01:07:47,755 --> 01:07:50,341
We've brought you here to kill him.

650
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:54,428
I've travelled for 500 miles to get here.

651
01:07:54,554 --> 01:07:57,557
And I couldn't let a barber
steal my work from me.

652
01:07:57,682 --> 01:07:59,684
Then you must have known it was Talby.

653
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:03,688
- And you went and saved him.
- For my $10,000.

654
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:14,407
Well. Since you're so sure
you're gonna kill him...

655
01:08:14,532 --> 01:08:16,534
here's a third of it now.

656
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:20,413
- The rest after.
- Mm-hm...

657
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:27,628
It may cost you a little more this way.

658
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:44,854
Drink to my health, Nigel?

659
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:49,233
Now... this was Corbitt's.
Now it's yours.

660
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,903
It's a great rifle,
in the hands of a good shot.

661
01:08:52,028 --> 01:08:55,615
I gotta warn you: Owen is able to shoot
ten buffalo, riding full speed.

662
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,704
Poor old Corbitt was
an expert only with a razor.

663
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:07,126
Nigel... the weapon that's gonna
kill me hasn't been invented yet.

664
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:09,462
(Man) Who knows?

665
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:20,765
I've heard that you're
pretty quick with a pistol.

666
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,726
And I don't want to question that...

667
01:09:23,851 --> 01:09:25,728
Talby.

668
01:09:25,853 --> 01:09:28,856
But who knows if
you'd take on a real duel?

669
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:32,485
You mean one of those games
where they count off paces?

670
01:09:33,694 --> 01:09:35,196
Almost.

671
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:36,656
Except on horseback.

672
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:39,533
And with front-loading rifles.

673
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:41,285
You got a reason for this?

674
01:09:43,204 --> 01:09:44,956
I've already told you once, Talby...

675
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:50,169
- You've made a lot of enemies.
- I know.

676
01:09:51,337 --> 01:09:54,757
All right. I'll kill you any way you want.

677
01:09:54,882 --> 01:09:56,884
Tomorrow morning.

678
01:09:59,178 --> 01:10:00,888
At sunrise.

679
01:10:41,595 --> 01:10:44,056
You're no better than he is

680
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:46,309
but I hope you plug him.

681
01:10:46,434 --> 01:10:50,604
It's the first time I've had
the best wishes of a marshal.

682
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:52,189
YOU can count on me.

683
01:10:53,607 --> 01:10:56,110
But... l don't understand, Talby.

684
01:10:56,235 --> 01:10:58,863
Would you tell me why you
accepted this ridiculous duel?

685
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,573
Ninth lesson...

686
01:11:00,698 --> 01:11:03,617
There are times you
have to accept a challenge

687
01:11:03,743 --> 01:11:05,953
or lose everything
there is in life anyway.

688
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:10,666
This is one of those times.

689
01:11:12,293 --> 01:11:14,295
But I wouldn't worry about it too much.

690
01:11:47,578 --> 01:11:49,372
(Gees horse)

691
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:22,733
(Footsteps)

692
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:25,069
No. No, no. No.

693
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:26,820
No, please.

694
01:14:26,946 --> 01:14:28,739
Don't do it.

695
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,741
It... it... it... it wasn't my idea.

696
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,869
Oh... don't. No, no...

697
01:14:33,994 --> 01:14:35,913
Don't ruin me. No.

698
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:38,249
It wasn't me. I didn't want to.

699
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:40,209
I'll do whatever you want.

700
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:41,794
You know something, Murray?

701
01:14:41,919 --> 01:14:44,088
- I don't like this place anymore.
- No?

702
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,799
Pretty soon, I'll be
opening up a new saloon.

703
01:14:46,924 --> 01:14:48,592
You know what I'm gonna call it?

704
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:51,178
The Forty-Five.
In honour of this one.

705
01:14:51,303 --> 01:14:52,721
Uh-huh.

706
01:14:52,846 --> 01:14:55,683
I'm dissolving our partnership.

707
01:14:55,808 --> 01:14:57,810
Now I want my half.

708
01:14:57,935 --> 01:14:59,186
Your thousand dollars?

709
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:03,107
Now come on, Murray. You know
this place is worth at least 40,000.

710
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:06,110
Now, I'm not good at mathematics,
but I'm sure you can figure it out.

711
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,654
But you gave me...
No, no, no, no. Whatever you want.

712
01:15:08,779 --> 01:15:13,242
$20,000. But I don't
have it on me right now. I...

713
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:16,370
- A note for payment on demand. Sign it.
- Yes.

714
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:25,629
That's it. I'll fill in the amount later.

715
01:15:28,382 --> 01:15:29,425
Mr Talby...

716
01:15:33,846 --> 01:15:36,265
Here's your receipt.

717
01:15:37,975 --> 01:15:38,892
(Shrieks)

718
01:15:57,161 --> 01:15:58,579
(Screaming)

719
01:16:09,632 --> 01:16:11,050
(Bell rings)

720
01:17:17,116 --> 01:17:19,118
Biggest fire I ever saw in my life!

721
01:17:24,498 --> 01:17:27,209
Have you seen Mr Talby?

722
01:17:27,334 --> 01:17:28,752
Where is Talby?

723
01:17:34,717 --> 01:17:37,344
There's nothing to be done, Scott.

724
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:40,472
God be merciful to the man's soul.

725
01:17:42,307 --> 01:17:43,434
Thanks.

726
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:48,564
Talby. For a minute,
I thought you were...

727
01:17:49,523 --> 01:17:51,567
You're the only one
that would've cared.

728
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:55,487
Well, one saloon's gone.
Let's build us another one.

729
01:18:11,712 --> 01:18:13,338
Scott's together with Talby.

730
01:18:13,464 --> 01:18:16,383
I'm not sure which
of the two is more dangerous to us.

731
01:18:24,391 --> 01:18:27,644
Right now, he's got us
wrapped around his finger.

732
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,272
Well, I'll talk to the marshal.

733
01:18:30,397 --> 01:18:32,232
- Things'll change pretty soon.
- Pretty soon.

734
01:18:32,357 --> 01:18:34,026
What's "pretty soon"?

735
01:18:34,151 --> 01:18:36,904
They might come here at any moment...

736
01:18:37,029 --> 01:18:38,322
and fix us fine.

737
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,533
Talby's in no hurry...

738
01:18:41,658 --> 01:18:43,827
but we've got to wait...
for the right move.

739
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,087
Talby wants to become
the owner of the whole town

740
01:18:54,213 --> 01:18:57,216
and he'll succeed,
if we don't find a way to isolate him,

741
01:18:57,341 --> 01:18:59,176
which means,
get rid of Scott.

742
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:07,017
And I think I've found
a way to do it.

743
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:15,442
Cheer up. It'll be all right.

744
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:22,825
Things have always worked out
before and they will this time.

745
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:24,952
- So long...
- (Knocking)

746
01:19:27,788 --> 01:19:29,081
Who is it?

747
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:33,168
Inside, there's Talby.

748
01:19:33,293 --> 01:19:36,338
He wants to speak
to you personally, Mr Turner.

749
01:19:36,463 --> 01:19:39,049
If he wants any money,
give him any amount he wants.

750
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:41,176
I'm sure we'll get it all back from him.

751
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,099
Go on, now.

752
01:20:24,177 --> 01:20:28,181
- New deputies. That's what's needed.
- Well, I'm thinking of joining.

753
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,351
Have you seen, Scott?

754
01:20:31,476 --> 01:20:33,770
They need assistance.

755
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:37,232
With the $50 they'll be earning a month?

756
01:20:37,357 --> 01:20:40,652
I bet they won't save enough
money to buy their own coffins.

757
01:20:41,945 --> 01:20:44,448
You oughtn't to speak like that
against defenders of the law.

758
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:47,159
I'll speak the way I please.

759
01:20:52,831 --> 01:20:56,877
I've just read that sign.
I'm in. What do I do about it?

760
01:20:57,002 --> 01:20:59,630
Well... why don't you come in
and we'll discuss it.

761
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:02,966
Come on in.

762
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,982
Hey, you...

763
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:23,070
Can you tell us, boy, where
we might find a man called Talby?

764
01:21:23,195 --> 01:21:24,947
But who are you to ask?

765
01:21:25,072 --> 01:21:26,323
We work for him, you see.

766
01:21:30,827 --> 01:21:32,371
He's in the saloon.

767
01:21:55,602 --> 01:21:57,562
Where did you find that pistol?

768
01:21:57,688 --> 01:22:00,941
That? Oh, the marshal gave it to me.

769
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:03,485
Huh...

770
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:07,739
Who are you now?
Murph Allan Short?

771
01:22:07,864 --> 01:22:10,367
Or are you simply plain Murph?

772
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:12,703
One day I made my choice.

773
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:13,996
You can never go back.

774
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,748
Tell the truth.

775
01:22:16,873 --> 01:22:19,209
You don't like my being with Talby.

776
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:21,253
You watch out.

777
01:22:21,378 --> 01:22:23,797
They've been saying
that you're faster than him.

778
01:22:23,922 --> 01:22:26,633
You may be faster and quicker
with your eye and your hand,

779
01:22:26,758 --> 01:22:30,429
but... in order to survive,
you need something else.

780
01:22:30,554 --> 01:22:34,182
- Experience.
- You're trying to turn me against him.

781
01:22:34,307 --> 01:22:37,185
Talby should be about 45.

782
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:39,104
That's a bad age for a gunman.

783
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:41,982
Every day you feel
yourself getting slower.

784
01:22:42,107 --> 01:22:45,485
Your muscles still react,
but your reflexes aren't as quick.

785
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:48,280
Talby's done the same
as a lot of others before him.

786
01:22:48,405 --> 01:22:50,115
He's taken a helper.

787
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,493
Somebody young who shoots
for him when things get too difficult.

788
01:22:53,618 --> 01:22:55,037
That's a lie.

789
01:22:55,162 --> 01:22:57,372
But even if it was true,
what's bad in that?

790
01:22:57,497 --> 01:23:01,918
The day will come when you'll
be throwing too big a shadow on him.

791
01:23:02,044 --> 01:23:03,628
This is his last chance.

792
01:23:03,754 --> 01:23:05,255
His last city.

793
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,716
Either he sets himself up here for life

794
01:23:07,841 --> 01:23:09,259
or he leaves his skin.

795
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:12,471
I don't believe anymore
in your ridiculous fairy tales.

796
01:23:12,596 --> 01:23:13,764
Scott...

797
01:23:13,889 --> 01:23:15,557
Never hammer a hammer.

798
01:23:15,682 --> 01:23:17,768
Just... caress it.

799
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:21,229
And that's just what Talby said.

800
01:23:21,354 --> 01:23:24,357
- I don't get it.
- Have you ever seen him draw?

801
01:23:26,526 --> 01:23:28,570
But, Murph... What's the point?

802
01:23:28,695 --> 01:23:31,198
That's one of his tricks.

803
01:23:31,323 --> 01:23:33,325
You shoot like this.

804
01:23:35,368 --> 01:23:38,371
And he shoots like... this.

805
01:23:39,915 --> 01:23:42,459
But if you hold the barrel like that...

806
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:46,254
you'll make sure...
that you don't stop the drum.

807
01:23:46,379 --> 01:23:48,632
Of course, that's why
Talby's modified the hammer.

808
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:52,677
He can fire six shots
in the time it takes you to fire... three.

809
01:23:52,803 --> 01:23:54,763
And he's more accurate.

810
01:23:54,888 --> 01:23:56,431
It's all in the gun.

811
01:23:56,556 --> 01:23:58,850
Was it he who chose your gun?

812
01:23:58,975 --> 01:24:01,311
Yeah, Murph. It's a beautiful weapon.

813
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:03,146
Beautiful, huh?

814
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:05,065
But the barrel is seven inches long.

815
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:07,526
Huh... The best size for me.

816
01:24:07,651 --> 01:24:09,861
Have you seen Talby's gun?

817
01:24:09,986 --> 01:24:11,655
Yes, it's one like mine.

818
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,782
Erm... only it's missing the sight.

819
01:24:13,907 --> 01:24:15,700
Exactly.

820
01:24:15,826 --> 01:24:18,912
It hasn't got a sight
because he has sawed off the barrel.

821
01:24:19,037 --> 01:24:20,914
You have two more inches of barrel.

822
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:22,999
Two more inches to draw.

823
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:24,334
You know what that means?

824
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:27,045
Look, I've had more
than enough of this talk.

825
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:30,048
But you think you're putting me
against Talby only because of

826
01:24:30,173 --> 01:24:31,967
a pistol much shorter than mine?

827
01:24:32,092 --> 01:24:35,804
Think of me, when the day comes, if you
find yourself face to face with Talby.

828
01:24:35,929 --> 01:24:38,515
- I'm going.
- Listen, my boy.

829
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,517
If anything should happen to me,

830
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,561
I've hidden a package there,

831
01:24:42,686 --> 01:24:44,896
in that box where
you used to keep your money.

832
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:46,731
Bah...

833
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,614
Take it... if you remember me.

834
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:57,409
But leave it there,
if you still think I'm an old lunatic.

835
01:24:57,534 --> 01:24:59,536
Forget it!

Ladies and gentlemen.

863
01:26:38,677 --> 01:26:43,181
I don't think there's anyone, anybody,
more sorry about Abel Murray than I am.

864
01:26:43,306 --> 01:26:46,685
I hope now you can enjoy this place
just as much as you enjoyed his.

865
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:48,812
- Thank you.
- (Applause)

866
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:15,630
My friends, this is your room for gambling.

867
01:27:25,932 --> 01:27:27,809
Gentlemen, come and play here.

868
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:29,853
We're about ready to start.

869
01:27:30,145 --> 01:27:32,856
Please sit down.
Would you be seated, please?

870
01:27:33,023 --> 01:27:34,065
Game's about to begin.

871
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,575
Split the cards, sir.

872
01:27:46,786 --> 01:27:49,789
Place your bets. Place your bets.

873
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:53,376
Fourteen for the gentleman.

874
01:27:58,381 --> 01:28:00,884
- Deuce or house...
- Round and round and round she goes.

875
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,719
Where she stops, nobody knows.

876
01:28:02,844 --> 01:28:07,057
Get your bets in, please. Bets in. Next round.
That's right. Right in.

877
01:28:07,182 --> 01:28:09,142
Looks like you won, sir.

878
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:23,948
Well... you're very lucky.

879
01:28:24,115 --> 01:28:25,158
Here you are.

880
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,658
Two deputies are outside.

881
01:29:06,783 --> 01:29:11,121
They'll get what they're looking for.
Thank you, Gwen.

882
01:29:11,246 --> 01:29:14,249
Two deputies are outside.
What do we do?

883
01:29:17,252 --> 01:29:20,463
Stand guard at the upstairs window.

884
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:22,632
You can go out the back
where I came in.

885
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:25,176
Be careful. These guys
aren't just cowboys.

886
01:29:34,519 --> 01:29:35,937
You go ahead.

887
01:30:06,551 --> 01:30:08,470
Hey, Cross.

888
01:30:08,595 --> 01:30:10,597
Looking for someone?

889
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:17,479
What do you say?

890
01:30:17,604 --> 01:30:20,607
Want to leave things up to the pistols?

891
01:30:20,732 --> 01:30:22,609
You begin, Cross.

892
01:30:22,734 --> 01:30:25,361
I'm a deputy. You got that clear?

893
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:27,489
I represent the law.

894
01:30:27,614 --> 01:30:30,617
You're just like
any other gunman paid to kill me.

895
01:30:30,742 --> 01:30:32,827
All right. I'm ready.

896
01:31:03,274 --> 01:31:05,693
(Man) Scott... everything all right?

897
01:31:07,362 --> 01:31:10,281
Put away your spitfire, Talby.

898
01:31:10,406 --> 01:31:12,408
It's all over.

899
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:18,039
In this town, there ain't
no more deputies with a fast pistol.

900
01:31:21,834 --> 01:31:24,212
Come on inside.
We gotta celebrate.

901
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:31,219
His songs were sad...
but he knew how to play.

902
01:31:32,303 --> 01:31:35,056
He won't play anymore.

903
01:31:35,181 --> 01:31:37,725
I don't think this is a night to celebrate.

904
01:31:38,893 --> 01:31:41,646
When did you get
so sentimental, Scott Mary?

905
01:31:42,772 --> 01:31:44,983
Beginning now.

906
01:31:45,108 --> 01:31:46,526
(Cocks gun)

907
01:31:56,536 --> 01:32:00,832
Scott Mary. Will you come with me?
My father wants to talk to you.

908
01:32:00,957 --> 01:32:02,333
Is that so?

909
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:04,002
I remember being chased away.

910
01:32:04,127 --> 01:32:07,088
I know. You're right.
But it's different now.

911
01:32:07,213 --> 01:32:10,216
Will you? They're waiting
for us at the old mill.

912
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:12,760
Please...

913
01:32:19,475 --> 01:32:21,060
(Gees horses)

914
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:46,294
Scott...

915
01:32:46,419 --> 01:32:51,049
If you do what my pa says, he won't
object anymore to us seeing each other.

916
01:32:53,426 --> 01:32:56,012
What's he want?

917
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,222
I don't know.

918
01:32:58,348 --> 01:33:00,975
But you must do it. For me.

919
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:10,485
Later.

920
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:12,028
I'll be here.

921
01:33:35,134 --> 01:33:37,470
Hands up. All of you.

922
01:33:45,978 --> 01:33:47,980
Murph, close the door.

923
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:51,025
We came here to talk.

924
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:53,820
Nobody's going to do anything to you.

925
01:33:53,945 --> 01:33:55,947
I ain't scared of anybody.

926
01:33:56,447 --> 01:33:59,325
Marshal... get rid of your pistol.

927
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:04,789
A little nervous, eh?

928
01:34:08,751 --> 01:34:12,714
Your judge is much smarter
and believes in living.

929
01:34:12,839 --> 01:34:16,384
You have learned a few tricks, boy.

930
01:34:16,509 --> 01:34:18,302
Tell me what you have to tell me.

931
01:34:19,512 --> 01:34:21,013
Listen, Scott...

932
01:34:21,139 --> 01:34:22,974
We want you to come over...

933
01:34:23,099 --> 01:34:26,060
(Clears throat) On our side.

934
01:34:26,185 --> 01:34:29,897
So we can bring... some order
back to Clifton,

935
01:34:30,022 --> 01:34:32,567
which is just as much
your town as ours.

936
01:34:32,692 --> 01:34:35,194
I've known your order
for more than 20 years...

937
01:34:35,319 --> 01:34:36,946
but you're wasting your time.

938
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:40,491
You're right, Scott.
But you know me well.

939
01:34:40,616 --> 01:34:43,578
And you should think about
the fact that I'm on this side.

940
01:34:43,703 --> 01:34:45,830
Our worst problem,
at the moment, is Talby.

941
01:34:45,955 --> 01:34:48,750
Eliminate him and then
we can think about the rest.

942
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:50,585
No, Murph.

943
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:53,379
As far as I know
Talby's done only justice.

944
01:34:53,504 --> 01:34:55,882
He may have killed, but only
because they made trouble.

945
01:34:56,549 --> 01:34:59,886
He'll kill anyone who comes
between himself and his goal.

946
01:35:00,011 --> 01:35:02,138
Good or bad alike.

947
01:35:02,263 --> 01:35:05,349
But I'll chase him out of Clifton,
like I chased him out of Abilene

948
01:35:05,475 --> 01:35:07,894
20 years ago... Scott.

949
01:35:08,978 --> 01:35:11,481
I don't want to see the two of us...

950
01:35:11,606 --> 01:35:13,232
face to face.

951
01:35:13,357 --> 01:35:15,234
Then just forget Talby.

952
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:16,861
Step aside.

953
01:35:27,497 --> 01:35:28,706
Scott.

954
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:38,674
I told you he wouldn't accept.

955
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,134
Much worse for him.

956
01:35:40,259 --> 01:35:43,471
The bastard is about to die.

957
01:35:43,596 --> 01:35:46,849
And then... it's your turn.

958
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:48,643
Why, you son of a...

959
01:35:48,768 --> 01:35:51,771
- Eileen.
- I'm here, Scott.

960
01:35:58,736 --> 01:36:00,154
(Gunshot)

961
01:36:01,656 --> 01:36:04,826
I made it. I killed Scott Mary!

962
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:06,786
'Got him!

963
01:36:06,911 --> 01:36:08,329
(Gasps)

964
01:36:10,039 --> 01:36:12,208
- Scott.
- There. The two of them!

965
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:15,753
Ah... the plan worked out.
Come on, let's go.

966
01:36:17,004 --> 01:36:19,006
Murderers!

967
01:36:23,636 --> 01:36:25,972
I hope he's dead. The bastard.

968
01:36:26,097 --> 01:36:28,891
You're going to hell, Turner.
Find out down there.

969
01:36:31,102 --> 01:36:32,520
(Eileen) No!

970
01:36:35,606 --> 01:36:38,067
Well, this time it's nothing
to do with self-defence, Talby.

971
01:36:39,068 --> 01:36:41,821
It's murder.
Hand me your gun.

972
01:36:50,913 --> 01:36:53,332
(Talby) We'll see what
the jury has to say, Nigel.

973
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:11,225
You won, Talby.

974
01:37:14,896 --> 01:37:17,732
Obviously, it wasn't just luck.

975
01:37:19,817 --> 01:37:22,612
This country is developing.

976
01:37:22,737 --> 01:37:24,739
And Clifton along with it.

977
01:37:26,032 --> 01:37:29,368
But now, maybe more than ever before,

978
01:37:29,493 --> 01:37:32,955
you need a judge... as your friend.

979
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:37,084
What's done inside the law is sometimes
safer than what's done outside the law.

980
01:37:38,169 --> 01:37:41,088
You're still the smartest, Talby.

981
01:37:41,213 --> 01:37:42,673
But deal with Wild Jack.

982
01:37:42,798 --> 01:37:45,760
You know it's gonna cost
you $50,000 now.

983
01:37:45,885 --> 01:37:47,637
A reasonable price.

984
01:37:47,762 --> 01:37:52,516
But our alliance will yield...
at least twice that.

985
01:37:52,642 --> 01:37:55,269
Every month.

986
01:37:59,732 --> 01:38:02,693
Seeing as how someone's
running away with your carriage,

987
01:38:02,818 --> 01:38:05,821
may I have the privilege
of escorting you home?

988
01:38:06,697 --> 01:38:08,699
Thanks a lot, Mr Talby.

989
01:38:08,824 --> 01:38:11,327
There's no better escort
in the whole county.

990
01:38:20,211 --> 01:38:24,590
- How is he?
- Bad wound. The bullet did a nasty job.

991
01:38:24,715 --> 01:38:26,717
Perhaps he won't be able
to use his arm again.

992
01:38:28,386 --> 01:38:29,929
He'll never be able to shoot again?

993
01:38:30,054 --> 01:38:32,306
I'm hoping he won't,
but that wound of his

994
01:38:32,431 --> 01:38:35,267
shouldn't prevent him
from returning to his broom.

995
01:38:35,393 --> 01:38:39,397
Clifton, I think, will finally go back
to what it was before.

996
01:38:40,898 --> 01:38:44,318
Scott was the only one
who could ever stand up to Talby.

997
01:38:44,443 --> 01:38:47,655
Now Clifton will never go back
to what it was before.

998
01:38:51,367 --> 01:38:53,369
I'll see you tomorrow.

999
01:39:04,964 --> 01:39:06,215
Four queens.

1000
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,550
Here are the cards.

1001
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:10,011
- Cards?
- Cards.

1002
01:39:10,136 --> 01:39:11,554
Cards.

1003
01:39:13,556 --> 01:39:18,019
And I'm to believe that this Scott Mary
passed from broomstick to pistol, huh?

1004
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,645
Just like that.

1005
01:39:19,770 --> 01:39:22,857
Absolutely. When Scott Mary
used his pistol,

1006
01:39:22,982 --> 01:39:25,276
boy, what a spectacle.
(Laughter)

1007
01:39:25,401 --> 01:39:27,069
Scott Mary, the wonder boy.

1008
01:39:27,194 --> 01:39:30,197
Last three weeks he's been enjoying
over at Vivian Skill's house.

1009
01:39:33,617 --> 01:39:37,413
Doctor Cullen says, in order to extract
the bullet from his right arm,

1010
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,206
he had to cut a muscle.

1011
01:39:39,331 --> 01:39:43,627
In fact, we'll be holding the glass to his
mouth, this great gun, so he can drink.

1012
01:39:43,753 --> 01:39:45,671
(Laughter)

1013
01:39:45,796 --> 01:39:47,506
It's a lot of bull.

1014
01:39:47,631 --> 01:39:49,925
When you drop dead
or become too feeble to shoot,

1015
01:39:50,051 --> 01:39:51,969
you get a name
as the greatest shot in the West.

1016
01:39:52,094 --> 01:39:55,347
Yeah. Just like Doc Holliday, for instance.

1017
01:39:55,473 --> 01:39:59,060
When he died, that gun
of his became a legend.

1018
01:39:59,185 --> 01:40:02,980
You know, if Scott Mary
should stay paralysed,

1019
01:40:03,105 --> 01:40:04,565
there's lot of folks gonna think

1020
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:08,486
he was able to light a match
at ten paces' distance...

1021
01:40:08,611 --> 01:40:09,570
(Gunshot)

1022
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:20,456
One, two, three, four,

1023
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:23,501
five, six, seven, eight,

1024
01:40:23,626 --> 01:40:26,378
nine, ten.
(Laughs)

1025
01:40:35,805 --> 01:40:37,223
Champagne.

1026
01:40:38,349 --> 01:40:40,810
We've got to celebrate.

1027
01:40:40,935 --> 01:40:42,937
You're looking good.
How's your arm?

1028
01:40:45,689 --> 01:40:47,108
I can take care of myself.

1029
01:40:49,401 --> 01:40:52,238
You're faster than before.

1030
01:40:52,363 --> 01:40:53,697
Because I exercised.

1031
01:40:53,823 --> 01:40:55,825
I pushed myself out of bed to do it.

1032
01:41:16,846 --> 01:41:18,848
To your recovery.

1033
01:41:26,814 --> 01:41:28,440
The marshal's star.
Who did it go to?

1034
01:41:35,865 --> 01:41:37,867
There is a new marshal, ain't there?

1035
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:40,995
Yeah.

1036
01:41:42,246 --> 01:41:44,123
Murph... Allan... Short.

1037
01:41:46,542 --> 01:41:48,752
He... might make a good sheriff.

1038
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:52,631
A tough one.

1039
01:41:52,756 --> 01:41:55,009
In Clifton, I owe nothing to nobody.

1040
01:41:56,343 --> 01:41:58,012
But to Murph, I'm very indebted.

1041
01:41:58,762 --> 01:42:02,016
(Chuckles) Of course,
I'm indebted to you too.

1042
01:42:02,141 --> 01:42:04,351
I wouldn't want to be between two fires.

1043
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:10,691
I guess not.

1044
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,202
Unfortunately, Scottie...

1045
01:42:23,329 --> 01:42:25,956
you're gonna hesitate
before shooting with me.

1046
01:42:27,291 --> 01:42:30,544
If you do anything against Murph
it's also against me.

1047
01:42:36,759 --> 01:42:39,762
Go home... and put your artillery away.

1048
01:42:50,064 --> 01:42:53,275
Ah... yes, Sheriff.
What do you want?

1049
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,570
As from today, it's forbidden
to sell firearms in the city.

1050
01:42:56,695 --> 01:42:58,530
- Forbidden?
- Yes.

1051
01:42:58,656 --> 01:43:01,283
But I've mailed an order
for 35 pistols and I...

1052
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:02,993
Send the pistols back.

1053
01:43:10,459 --> 01:43:11,293
Talby!

1054
01:43:14,088 --> 01:43:15,506
Talby!

1055
01:43:21,637 --> 01:43:22,972
I hear you.

1056
01:43:23,097 --> 01:43:25,975
As from today, it's forbidden
to wear firearms in the city.

1057
01:43:27,559 --> 01:43:29,603
Unbuckle your belt and let it drop.

1058
01:43:30,396 --> 01:43:31,981
You better come and get it.

1059
01:43:32,106 --> 01:43:33,565
I'm coming.

1060
01:43:36,277 --> 01:43:39,822
I may not be as fast as I used to be,

1061
01:43:39,947 --> 01:43:43,033
but you could lose again
on account of me.

1062
01:44:01,635 --> 01:44:02,469
No!

1063
01:44:08,809 --> 01:44:10,769
I gave you plenty of warning, Talby.

1064
01:44:10,894 --> 01:44:13,814
Now I'm gonna get you.

1065
01:44:36,253 --> 01:44:38,380
"Dear Scott,

1066
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:40,215
"When you read this,

1067
01:44:40,341 --> 01:44:42,509
"I will be dead.

1068
01:44:48,891 --> 01:44:50,392
"The only thing I can leave you

1069
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:52,686
"is this pistol. It's an old one,

1070
01:44:52,811 --> 01:44:54,271
"but it belonged to Doc Holliday.

1071
01:44:54,396 --> 01:44:57,066
"It's also been mine. Now it's yours.

1072
01:44:57,191 --> 01:45:00,194
"It's endowed with the tricks
of three generations of gunmen.

1073
01:45:00,319 --> 01:45:02,071
"The firing pin's been modified

1074
01:45:02,196 --> 01:45:04,573
"so that all you have to do
is think about shooting.

1075
01:45:04,698 --> 01:45:06,909
"The trigger fires immediately.

1076
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:10,037
"This pistol is now in your hands, Scott,

1077
01:45:10,162 --> 01:45:12,498
"but if you still think the way Talby does,

1078
01:45:12,623 --> 01:45:15,459
"I beg you: Throw it away."

1079
01:45:42,361 --> 01:45:43,612
(Cocks gun)

1080
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,118
Scott.

1081
01:45:51,078 --> 01:45:53,080
- Hey, Scott.
- I'm here.

1082
01:45:55,332 --> 01:45:57,084
They're coming over here.

1083
01:45:57,209 --> 01:45:59,962
You're surrounded by
the gunmen of Talby, Scott.

1084
01:46:05,801 --> 01:46:07,428
They might kill you, Scott.

1085
01:46:08,679 --> 01:46:10,305
Don't be worried.

1086
01:46:12,057 --> 01:46:13,434
Come on out, Scott Mary.

1087
01:46:13,559 --> 01:46:15,477
Talby wants to speak to you.

1088
01:46:25,821 --> 01:46:28,740
Now, are you coming out immediately?
Or must we beg you?

1089
01:46:38,375 --> 01:46:42,379
I'm coming out...
but you'd better not shoot.

1090
01:47:04,526 --> 01:47:06,820
You never should beg another man.

1091
01:47:06,945 --> 01:47:09,364
That's the first lesson
I learned from Talby.

1092
01:47:09,490 --> 01:47:12,493
Don't move. Drop your gun, Scott.

1093
01:47:27,341 --> 01:47:30,302
Yeah, friend. You mustn't trust anyone.

1094
01:47:30,427 --> 01:47:33,430
That's the second lesson.

1095
01:48:38,453 --> 01:48:41,164
- Did you see him?
- No. He's not even at Vivian Skill's.

1096
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:46,336
Never get between a gun and its target.

1097
01:48:57,347 --> 01:49:00,350
The right bullet at the right time.

1098
01:49:20,746 --> 01:49:23,999
Talby. Now it's your turn.

1099
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:27,794
There's nobody out here left
to be killed in your place.

1100
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:37,929
A challenge shouldn't be refused,
no matter what it might mean to you.

1101
01:49:39,222 --> 01:49:41,224
Remember saying that to me?

1102
01:49:55,238 --> 01:49:57,658
Sure I do, Scott Mary.

1103
01:50:24,601 --> 01:50:27,187
You sure you want it this way, Scottie?

1104
01:50:27,312 --> 01:50:29,147
You saw what happened to Murph.

1105
01:50:29,272 --> 01:50:31,108
But you won't do it to me.

1106
01:50:31,233 --> 01:50:33,402
Tell me: Did you go to church to pray?

1107
01:50:35,278 --> 01:50:38,615
If I waited for you in the saloon,
the sun wouldn't be in your eyes.

1108
01:50:44,413 --> 01:50:46,623
I don't believe your tricks will be enough.

1109
01:50:52,963 --> 01:50:54,965
My gun will do it.

1110
01:50:55,507 --> 01:50:58,218
(Chuckles) That's where you're mistaken.

1111
01:50:58,343 --> 01:51:01,054
If I was alone,
maybe you could've done it.

1112
01:51:01,179 --> 01:51:03,849
But not against me and Murph.

1113
01:51:03,974 --> 01:51:06,601
Now I got a pistol
that's equal to yours.

1114
01:51:06,727 --> 01:51:09,688
Sight missing, calibrated perfectly.

1115
01:51:10,439 --> 01:51:12,899
Your last lesson, Scottie...

1116
01:51:13,024 --> 01:51:14,693
When you start killing,
you can't stop it.

1117
01:51:17,863 --> 01:51:19,281
Any time you're ready.

1118
01:51:54,566 --> 01:51:56,109
Find me a horse, Scottie.

1119
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,529
I'll get out of your way.

1120
01:52:01,698 --> 01:52:03,992
No. I'd be stupid to help you.

1121
01:52:04,117 --> 01:52:06,703
I've learned your lessons like a good boy.

1122
01:52:06,828 --> 01:52:08,914
When a man has been wounded,

1123
01:52:09,039 --> 01:52:11,291
you've gotta end it.

1124
01:52:11,416 --> 01:52:15,003
Or it might be that later
he'll try to kill you.

1125
01:52:15,128 --> 01:52:16,546
(Cocks gun)

1126
01:52:45,283 --> 01:52:47,619
You won, Murph.

1127
01:53:06,096 --> 01:53:07,931
Scott.

1128
01:53:12,978 --> 01:53:14,396
Scott!
