from the outside.

For a time, we were afraid
they weren't high enough
to hold you in.

a train,

4
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:05,767

Huntsville
this afternoon.

5
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:08,219
Thanks, Chuck.

6
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:10,335
Good luck, Wes.
Good luck.

7
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,446
Goodbye.

8
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,054
Morning.
What can I do for you?

9
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,270
I'm Wes Hardin.

10
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:53,262
John Wesley Hardin?
That's right.

11
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,875
I have a story here.
Wrote it myself.

12
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:58,503
It's about me.

13
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:00,773
I think it might
interest people.

14
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,130
Well, I'd like to read
your story, but...
There's no hurry.

15

Sometimes, it seems like
he enjoys it,
whipping and praying.

Seems like the time
has to come when a man

round up a few cattle

and drive them
to the railroad.

85

But there are
thousands of men,

86
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,013

and horses, that are working
these mavericks.

00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,100
Get out quick, Wes.
He's got three brothers.

They won't ask
who drew first.

in my hat, Rosie.

my saddlebag.

Name? Oh, my name is Marv.
Everybody calls me Marv.

I've been tending
bar here for...
Not your name.

The name of the man
who did the shooting.

Hey, mister...
I mean, Lieutenant.

195
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:01,520
I don't think he saw it.
He couldn't see that far.

196
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,074
You seem to see plenty
around here. You see it?

197
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,821
No, no, but he did.

Maybe I shouldn't.
I'm in trouble.

Well, if you're in trouble,
you've come
to the right house.

Sit down, Wes.
Have some breakfast.

What kind of trouble
you in, Wes?

227
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,695
I shot Gus Hanley.

Gus Hanley?
You killed him?

with that brood,
you should have got them all!

the rest of them as soon as
they come a-running.

He's cut five notches
already.

Wes, what I say is...

234
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,155
You don't say nothing
till you're spoken to.

235
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,751
There's something else.

236
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:46,048
I think maybe I shot
a couple of Yankees
getting out of town.

237
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,416

trying to do, boy?

all over again?

The Yankees don't count.
But the Hanleys do.

Does your pa
know about all this?

242
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:57,643

about it by now.

and go on over to Bonham

that Wes is with us.

to talk about your brother.

where I am.

I expect he don't care.

249
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:13,802
I cut loose from him
before all this.

out looking for Wes.

not for a long time,

to Abilene,

tomorrow morning.
Can't we, boys?

than that if you say so, Pa.

as soon as you can.

looking for him
in one direction,

promising to shoot him
on sight,

looking for him
in the other direction,

00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:35,841
That's a real good-Iooking
pony you got.

280
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:37,529
Must have cost you plenty.

281
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:39,125
Nah, didn't cost
me nothing.

down at the fort,

he confiscated this horse
from a ranch
up near Nacogdoches

284
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,487
and all I done
was confiscate him back.

285
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:46,568
You mean you stole him?

286
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:48,643
Well, no, not exactly.

287
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:52,606
You see, the Major wanted
to play a little poker with
old Zeke, so I obliged him.

288
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:54,745
He got more cards
off the bottom
than he did off the top

289
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:56,474

didn't even know him.

No. Why?

only three days ago,

to Wes Hardin as I am
to you right now.

too sentimental. Now...

out on the trail to Abilene.

Well, then I give him
a real nice hand.

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,000
And then what?

333
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,491
Well, then I give myself
a little bit better hand.

334
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:27,959
Yes, that's how come
I'm riding Rondo.

335

What do you do, son?

336

I'll open for $200.

there ain't that much money
in the whole State of Texas.

Nope. Her eyes are too black.

505
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:38,992
Too black! Lola!
Try it on to Lola.

506
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:40,652
Lola. She's a
nice girl, too, huh?

507
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:42,029
Eh? Eh?

508
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:43,784
No, she don't
look like a bride.

509
00:29:43,853 --> 00:29:45,639
Who then? Me? Me?

510
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:47,743
JOHN: Wes, look at this.

511
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:49,721
Perfect! Perfect!
That's nice, huh?

512
00:29:50,115 --> 00:29:52,119
Let's see your feet.
Feet.

513
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,106
No, too big.

514
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:55,283
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

515
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:57,075
Look at the time,

516
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:58,952
(GUN FIRES)

517
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:03,044
I figure it'll take
just about one minute
to fix that clock.

518
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:09,629
Marshall, in one minute
I'm gonna be as far away
from here as I can.

519
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:12,247
Pick up my money, Uncle John.

520
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,103
JANE: (WHISPERING) Wes.

521
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,552
Oh, Wes,
you shouldn't be here.

522
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:03,067
I told you I'd be back.
Your father will hear us.

523
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,525
Never mind.
I've come back
to marry you.

524
00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:09,808
Look, Jane,
we've got enough money
to buy that farm,

525
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:11,340
just like I promised you.

526
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:13,552
Lots of pasture and trees.

527
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:16,263
Wait till you see
what I've brought you
from Abilene.

528
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:17,477
Look, Jane.

529
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:19,205
Oh, a wedding dress.

530
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:20,253
Try it on.

531
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:22,592
No! It's bad luck.
I want you to now.

532
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,414
It's so beautiful.

533
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:28,213
But where did you get
all that money, Wes?

534
00:31:29,015 --> 00:31:30,539
I didn't steal it.

535
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,206
I didn't mean that.

536
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:34,884
I'm lucky, Jane,

537
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:37,345
luckier than a man
has a right to be.

538
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:41,345
You mean like
when you killed Dirk Hanley?

539
00:31:42,752 --> 00:31:43,863
I heard.

540
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:46,388
The Hanleys came
looking for me.

541
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:50,476
Oh, come on, Jane,
let's get out of here
and never come back.

542
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:52,709
I got a bad feeling
about this place.

543
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,045
But we can't
go now, Wes.
Why not?

544
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,161
Because I promised your pa
he'd be the one to marry us.

545
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:00,507
What'd you do that for?

546
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:01,884
Shh. Wes, be quiet.

547
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:04,688
Wes! Wait!
I've got other plans.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

548
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:06,613
Wes. Wait, Wes.

549
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:09,708
He gave me a home.
He has a right.
I know.

550
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:12,962
But I just have a feeling
it's gonna be
a funeral service

551
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:15,137
Pa says over me,
not a wedding service.

552
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:18,683
If you go to an early grave,
John Wesley,
it won't be my doing,

553
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,316
it'll be God's will.

554
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,745
Then I guess it's God's will
I'm still here.

555
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:24,276
He's had plenty of chances.

556
00:32:25,749 --> 00:32:28,134
Jane, get into
some decent clothes.

557
00:32:30,637 --> 00:32:33,567
I'm not marrying you
to Jane until you're
free of the law.

558
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:36,156
If I turn myself in,
they'll hang me.
Is that what you want?

559
00:32:36,228 --> 00:32:37,208
Hear me out.

560
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:41,782
The Yankees are leaving,
more every day.
The curfew has been lifted.

561
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,065
The only charge that will
be brought is the murder
of Gus Hanley.

562
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:46,282
It wasn't murder.

563
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,196
He drew first!

564
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:51,109
Then you'll get off,
if you have
a fair trial.

565
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:55,032
I'm going to send
for Judge Ames,
the best lawyer in the county.

566
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,493
What if you're wrong?

567
00:32:58,301 --> 00:32:59,792
What if I don't get
a fair trial?

568
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:05,129
If I'm wrong,
I'll take up the gun
and get you free.

569
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,381
I believe you would.

570
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:13,248
We're going to need
the finest legal advice
that money can buy.

571
00:33:13,923 --> 00:33:16,700
Now, I plan to bring
Foster and Pratt down
from Dallas.

572
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,632
Of course, my boy,
that's gonna cost
a good deal of money.

573
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:21,839
More money than you have,
I'm afraid.

574
00:33:22,036 --> 00:33:23,081
How much, Judge?

575
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,638
How much you got?

576
00:33:26,828 --> 00:33:28,319
I got $1,200.

577
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:33,660
Well, you're at least
$700 or maybe $800 shy.

578
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:35,830
I'm very sorry,
my boy,

579
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,960
but the scales of justice
hang in a very
delicate balance.

580
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:42,286
There's nothing like money
to tilt it our way.

581
00:33:42,928 --> 00:33:45,574
Now, you be at Sheriff Webb's
office Monday morning.

582
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:48,287
We'll be waiting there
for you. Good day.

583
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:51,161
There goes our farm, Jane.

584
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,940
And he's not even sure
he can get me a fair trial.

585
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,144
You got to raise
more money, Wes,
to make sure.

586
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:57,490
You got any ideas?

587
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:59,790
I got one.
I don't know
if it's any good.

588
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:02,276
That horse of yours,
you said he was fast?

589
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:05,191
They're holding some races
over in Collin County
this week.

590
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:09,048
I was thinking they wouldn't
know about Rondo.
If you're lucky...

591
00:34:09,122 --> 00:34:10,647
I don't think
you should go, Wes.

592
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:14,546
There'll be drinking,
painted women, gambling.

593
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:16,971
And there'll be trouble.

594
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,433
Wes.

595
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:29,334
Please don't go.

596
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:30,778
I'm not looking
for any trouble, Jane.

597
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:34,091
The way you wear that gun,
you won't have to look for it.

598
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:35,534
You'd be safer here.

599
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,443
All right, I'll go
without my gun.

600
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:41,672
I'll ask Uncle John
and the boys to come along.

601
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,745
There won't be
any trouble.

602
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:46,620
I'm sorry to keep
picking on you.

603
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:49,051
I know you've had to
give up all your money,

604
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:50,767
all your plans, because of me.

605
00:34:50,937 --> 00:34:52,145
We need that money, Jane.

606
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:56,586
And when I get back, Sunday,
I want you to be wearing
that wedding dress.

607
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,462
MAN 1: All right, folks,
the third race is
a sweepstake,

608
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:14,351
winner takes all.

609
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,029
All right, boys,
let's get them up
to the starting line.

610
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:19,016
Come on, come on,
let's get them up there.

611
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:21,057
All right, line
those horses up here, boys.

612
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:23,489
Get in line,
a straight line.
MAN 2: Yes, sir.

613
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,590
Turn them around,
get in a straight line.

614
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:28,022
We're not gonna start this race
until all of them are
in a straight line.

615
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,943
Get those horses in a line.
I won't start this race till
the horses... Clem, get back!

616
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:33,391
Get set, go!

617
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,358
(CROWD CHEERING)

618
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:57,311
(CHEERING)

619
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:06,094
Come on, Wes! Wes!

620
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:11,015
Wes!

621
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,034
(LAUGHING)

622
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:14,787
Judge, how much
is in the pot
for the winner?

623
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:15,902
How much, Charlie?

624
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:19,351
Let's see.
That's $385.

625
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:23,219
Aw, and to think
I had to lose that horse
in a crooked deal.

626
00:36:27,825 --> 00:36:30,091
Don't forget, folks,
all bets will
be paid off

627
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,358
at Jack Martin's saloon
after the last race.

628
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:37,088
Hey, you! I'll bet you $500
against the $385 you can't
outrun my buckskin.

629
00:36:37,984 --> 00:36:39,094
You got yourself a bet.

630
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:40,336
So have you.

631
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:42,677
Gyp, cool him out.

632
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:47,881
Hey, Wes, $385
is a lot of money.
You better be...

633
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:49,290
Put up your money, mister.

634
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,791
Easy come, easy go.

635
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,670
Wes, have a drink
on the hearse?

636
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:57,682
Thanks, Chick.

637
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:01,071
Hey, Wes.

638
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,278
Well, Rosie.

639
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:05,903
You come up here
by yourself?

640
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:08,865
No. No, quite a few of us
came up from Bonham today.
Oh, yeah?

641
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:10,877
Including Ike Hanley
and Sheriff Webb.

642
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:13,311
That's why Chick Noonan
brought along his hearse.

643
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:15,316
Aw, Sheriff Webb's got
no cause to make trouble.

644
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:18,136
But Ike Hanley has,
and you're walking around
without a gun.

645
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:22,285
Ah, you're wrong, Rosie.
I'm going back to Bonham
and give myself up,

646
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:24,303
after I get married
to Jane on Sunday.

647
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,615
Yes, you're gonna buy a farm
and settle down
and raise horses, huh?

648
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:32,255
That's right, but there'll
always be a place
at the table for you.

649
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:36,281
You'll make a fine farmer.
And you'll make Jane
very happy,

650
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,509
wondering every day
when you're gonna
get killed.

651
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:39,851
Don't worry about it.

652
00:37:40,788 --> 00:37:42,857
I don't know why
I should care about you.

653
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,866
Why do you?

654
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:48,699
Maybe it's because
you and me are both
the same kind.

655
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:52,318
Living high on the hog today
because we don't believe
tomorrow's gonna come.

656
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,306
All right, Preacher's Boy,
have it your way.

657
00:37:57,846 --> 00:37:59,120
Goodbye, Rosie.

658
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:06,012
Wes.

659
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:08,506
Yeah?

660
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,946
Take care of yourself.

661
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:12,020
I aim to, Rosie.

662
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:18,374
Who's that peacock?

663
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:20,556
That's Rosie McCoy,
a friend of mine.

664
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:21,603
Where's she from?

665
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:25,030
Bonham. She works
for the Hanleys.

666
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:27,354
You say she's
a friend of yours?

667
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:29,754
The best friend I have,
excepting you.

668
00:38:32,538 --> 00:38:34,226
Hey, what's going on
there, mister?

669
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:35,340
Just shedding
a little weight.

670
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,125
Well, then, I guess we'll
shed a little weight, too.
Take her off, Gyp.

671
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,197
Hey, mister, if you're
gonna ride bareback,

672
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:41,858
you better put some glue on
the seat of your britches.

673
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,130
I'll be all right.
You better get some for him.

674
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,457
He can ride frontward,
backward, sideways,

675
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:48,282
standing up
and without a bridle.

676
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,776
What's going on here?

677
00:38:49,851 --> 00:38:51,409
This feller fancies
himself a rider.

678
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,778
Yeah, wants to ride
without a saddle.

679
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:55,303
Oh.
It's all right by me.

680
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:57,099
Fancy feller, huh?
Yeah.

681
00:38:58,093 --> 00:38:59,040
Okay.

682
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:02,235
Yeah.

683
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,704
Here. Here's a hundred
and a quarter.
How much money you got?

684
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,261
Hundred and a quarter.
On Rondo.

685
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:09,081
MAN 1: All right, boys,
let's get them up
to the starting line.

686
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,769
Get them
even, boys.

687
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:14,288
I want them even.
Steady, get set, go!

688

(CROWD CHEERING)

689
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:23,774
Come on.
Come on, Wes.

00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:28,821
Come on, Wes!
Come on, Wes!

691
00:39:38,695 --> 00:39:39,805
Come on, Wes!

692
00:39:44,413 --> 00:39:45,971
Come on, Wes.

We'll take
our money now, judge!

697
00:40:06,678 --> 00:40:09,357
You'll take your money
at Jack Martin's saloon
like everybody else

698
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:10,504
at the end of racing.

699
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:11,621
Well, well.

700
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:12,901
We'll get it, anyway.

701
00:40:14,185 --> 00:40:16,352
I tell you I can't
go through with it, Ike.

702
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:17,954
I've known that boy
all his life.

703
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:20,474
What you mean is
you're scared.

704
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:23,218
Why not?
He's the fastest draw
in Texas.

705
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,694
But he ain't looking
for trouble from you.

706
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:26,642
Now just handle it
the way I told you.

707
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:27,784
Yeah.

708
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:29,796
Suppose he doesn't try
to resist arrest?

709
00:40:31,084 --> 00:40:32,576
Here's $500
that says he does.

710
00:40:37,345 --> 00:40:38,358
Come here.

711
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:41,295
Take a look.

712
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,075
He ain't even
wearing a gun.

713
00:40:47,088 --> 00:40:49,419
Won't be a minute, boys.
Be right out.

MAN: Want to count it?

719
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,659
Count it, Uncle John.

JOHN: She's all there.

721
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:41,551
Got your money, Wes?

722
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,944
I've got it, Sheriff.

723
00:41:44,014 --> 00:41:45,190
Then start walking.

724
00:41:46,027 --> 00:41:48,956
You're under arrest
for killing Gus Hanley.

725
00:41:51,233 --> 00:41:53,368
You're a bit out of
your territory,
ain't you, Charlie?

726
00:41:53,693 --> 00:41:55,893
It's legal.
I'm making a lawful arrest.

727
00:41:56,983 --> 00:41:58,387
John, you keep out of this.

728
00:41:58,836 --> 00:42:00,688
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

729
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:03,173
There's no sense in
your arresting me today,
Charlie.

730
00:42:03,852 --> 00:42:05,986
You must've talked
to Judge Ames.
Ike knows about it.

731
00:42:06,343 --> 00:42:07,388
Never mind the talk.

732
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:09,759
I'm not looking
for any trouble here,
Charlie.

733
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:11,512
Jane and me are
getting married tomorrow.

734
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:14,807
I'm not turning myself in
till Monday, like I agreed.

735
00:42:15,511 --> 00:42:16,687
And I'm keeping my word.

736
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,411
Come on, Uncle John.

737
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:21,794
You're resisting arrest.

00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:32,494
Whoa.

740
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:43,392
Let's get out of here.

741
00:42:43,622 --> 00:42:44,897
We been here long enough!

742
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:46,365
Where do you think
you're going?

743
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:47,860
I'm going back to Bonham,
like I said.

744
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,492
That's the first place
they'll look for you.

745
00:42:49,564 --> 00:42:50,675
I'm going home
to get Jane.

746
00:42:50,746 --> 00:42:52,401
Aw, Wes, why don't you
stop talking like a fool?

747
00:42:52,471 --> 00:42:53,843
You ain't going back
to get nobody.

748
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,326
You're heading right for
the Rio Grande, right now.
Ain't that so, John?

749
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,372
Well, if he says he's
going back for Jane,
he's going back.

750
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:00,328
And I'm going with him
to see that he gets there.

751
00:43:00,393 --> 00:43:02,876
It's only a short piece,
Uncle John.
I can make it myself.

752
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:05,079
Boys, go on back
to the ranch.

753
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:08,789
And if a posse comes along,
keep them talking
as long as you can

754
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:11,667
and then send them
on the wrong road.
You understand?

755
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:34,056
Wes, you're hurt!
I'm all right.

756
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:36,032
What happened?
Charlie Webb tried
to shoot me down.

757
00:43:36,107 --> 00:43:37,185
Ike Hanley put him
up to it.

758
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,643
I told him I'd turn myself
in after the wedding
like I promised,

759
00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:41,750
but he wouldn't listen.

760
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:42,870
So you killed him?

761
00:43:42,944 --> 00:43:45,808
Yes, I killed him
and Ike Hanley, too.

762
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:49,420
You're a plague
on the earth,
John Wesley.

763
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,823
Sure, lots of people
think that.

764
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:54,148
There's a whole
posse of them
after me right now.

765
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:57,505
But don't start
praying for my
eternal soul, not yet.

766
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:00,603
I'm getting out of here,
clear out of Texas,

767
00:44:00,673 --> 00:44:01,686
Jane and me.

768
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,830
We'll get that farm, Jane,
just like I promised you.
Then we'II...

769
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:09,451
Sure, I know, the place
with the white painted fence,
the green grass

770
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,949
and the water
all year round.

771
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,842
I don't believe that
anymore, Wes.

772
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:14,596
I don't think
you believe it.

773
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:17,475
No. You'll never have
that place. Not now.

774
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,903
You'll never have more than
six feet of ground.
Jane, listen.

775
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:21,306
Because you'll never
stop killing.

776
00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:23,377
I never killed a man
except in self-defense.

777
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,004
Why did you kill
Gus Hanley?

778
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:27,692
I told you! He tried
to kill me first!
And Dirk Hanley?

779
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:29,165
He came looking for me.

780
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,144
Jane, we haven't got time.

781
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:33,151
Uncle John's waiting
on the other side
of the crick.

782
00:44:33,224 --> 00:44:37,211
What are you trying to prove?
That you're above the laws
of man and God?

783
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:41,264
Not God, not his laws.

784
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,570
Your laws, your whip.

785
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:46,319
But you never
made me crawl.

786
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:48,520
I was never afraid
of you or any man.

787
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:50,822
No, you're not afraid
of anyone so long
as you have a gun,

788
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,033
so long as you can kill!

789
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,474
You talk like him.

790
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,545
If you'd come away
with me when I wanted,
if he hadn't interfered,

791
00:44:55,618 --> 00:44:56,859
there wouldn't have been
any more killing.

792
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:01,230
There'll always be more, Wes,
because you'll always have
to prove you're not afraid.

793
00:45:01,304 --> 00:45:02,676
You'll always have
to kill to prove it.

794
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:03,950
Ah, you're talking crazy.

795
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:05,675
How do you feel
when you kill?

796
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,357
Do you feel bad
or do you feel good?

797
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:11,484
Do you feel good, Wes?
Tell me. Tell me!

798
00:45:16,158 --> 00:45:17,618
I stayed too long.

00:45:20,088 --> 00:45:21,395
Don't open that door.

801
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,605
What would you do?
Shoot me down, too?

802
00:45:27,178 --> 00:45:28,257

I'm the Marshall.

804
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:34,332
Sheriff Webb's been killed.
We've got a posse
around the place.

805
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:36,785
We want Wes Hardin to come out
or we're coming in after him.

806
00:45:37,497 --> 00:45:39,403
Get away
from the door.

807
00:45:42,928 --> 00:45:44,485
Don't, Wes. Don't.

808
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:53,880
Put up your hands,
Hardin, and come toward us.

809
00:45:54,204 --> 00:45:55,543
I'm staying right here.

810
00:45:56,409 --> 00:45:59,088
I killed Ike Hanley
and Charlie Webb
in self-defense

811
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,169
and you all know it.

812
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:03,465
You killed
an officer of the law during
the performance of his duty.

813
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,218
You killed him
while resisting arrest.

814
00:46:09,506 --> 00:46:10,452
What are you gonna do, Wes?

815
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:12,380
If they catch me,
they'll string me up
without a prayer.

816
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:13,425
I'll try to make
the crick.

817
00:46:13,499 --> 00:46:15,252
I'll cover for you.

818
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,399
Go on upstairs, Joe.
I'll try and make it
through the back door.

819
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,747

Sure looks like
you stopped some of them.
Let's get over here.

825

you'd bleed to death
before we went a mile.

Here's his horse.

830
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:08,833
I'll be right back
as soon as I can, Wes.
You'll be all right, boy.

831
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:16,381
Tell Jane I'm all right.

832
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:32,568
He's not around here.
He must've taken to the hills.

this is gonna bite.

We're in the Territory
heading for Kansas.

No.

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,204
No, we're going to Bonham.

839
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,195
I told Jane
I was coming back for her.

840
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,958
You can't go back
to Bonham, Wes.

841
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:44,668
I told you I was
going back to get her.

842
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:46,389
No, Wes, no.
There's no need
for you to go back.

843
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:49,098
Jane's dead.

844
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:54,858
They killed her.

845
00:51:57,254 --> 00:52:01,110
They couldn't get me
so they killed her.

846
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,602
Yeah, and if you go back,
they'll get you.

847
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,057
(THUNDER ROLLING)

848
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:02,229
Morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, Captain.

849
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:03,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

850
00:53:03,795 --> 00:53:05,831
Captain, our readers
want to know how,
in actual practice,

851
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:07,809
the Rangers can succeed
in enforcing the law

852
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,790
where the present
sheriffs and marshals fail.

853
00:53:09,865 --> 00:53:11,270
Well, in a practical sense,

854
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:15,550
the importance of a police
agency like the Rangers
can best be illustrated

855
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:16,857
by this man Wes Hardin.

856
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,881
This notorious killer
has escaped apprehension
for six years

857
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:23,215
simply by hopping
from county to county.

858
00:53:23,473 --> 00:53:26,729
But with the Rangers,
they can pursue him anywhere
on a statewide basis

859
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:29,120
and, with a little help
from the Governor's Office,

860
00:53:29,192 --> 00:53:32,830
can go beyond the boundaries
of Texas and bring this man
to justice.

861
00:53:33,504 --> 00:53:34,615
Yes, Duncan?

862
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,163
Gentlemen, you can tell
your readers we'll bring in
Wes Hardin.

863
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:47,232
(CHUCKLES)
Sure, Captain, but when?

864
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:49,756
When? They'll read about it
in the papers.

865
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:56,812
Rosie?

866
00:53:58,453 --> 00:53:59,400
Rosie.

867
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,053
What is it?
Where's my boot?
I can't find my boot.

868
00:54:12,348 --> 00:54:13,328
Here it is.

869
00:54:13,402 --> 00:54:15,123
Maybe you better hang it on
your watch chain.

870
00:54:15,192 --> 00:54:16,564
Yeah. Guess I'll have to.

871
00:54:17,715 --> 00:54:20,100
Going out to look
for a card game?
Mmm-hmm.

872
00:54:20,175 --> 00:54:22,375
Saloon on the corner
seems lively enough.

873
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:23,971
Where's my money?

874
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:33,136
Pretty thin bankroll.
Yeah.

875
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:35,915
Well, it won't always
be like this, honey.

876
00:54:36,498 --> 00:54:38,600
Running all the time,
living with riffraff.

877
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:40,555
Rich in the morning,
poor at night.

878
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,788
Someday were gonna
have that farm.
Sure, Wes, the farm.

879
00:54:43,399 --> 00:54:45,152
With green grass
and white painted house

880
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,940
and water that runs
all year round.

881
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:50,930
You wouldn't take
that farm if somebody
put it in your lap

882
00:54:51,097 --> 00:54:52,273
tied up in ribbons.

883
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:53,549
Why wouldn't I?

884
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:56,811
How many times have you
had enough to buy a farm
twice over?

885
00:54:57,135 --> 00:54:59,683
We had $3,000 in Waco.

886
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,139
And there was
a time in Houston
when you were 8,000 ahead.

887
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:04,094
But did you ever even
look at a farm, Wes?

888
00:55:04,163 --> 00:55:05,176
What are you trying to say?

889
00:55:08,027 --> 00:55:10,544
I'm trying to say
I don't like
your fancy dream.

890
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,510
You hang on to it because
it makes you feel better than
the gamblers, the riffraff.

891
00:55:15,535 --> 00:55:17,190
Maybe even better than me.

892
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,358
And I don't want you
to feel better than me, Wes,

893
00:55:20,231 --> 00:55:22,943
'cause I love you
the way you are,
the way you really are.

894
00:55:23,809 --> 00:55:25,909
One of these days,
I'm gonna surprise you, Rosie.

895
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:29,174
I'm gonna win me
a wagonload of money.
Then we'll settle down.

896
00:55:29,686 --> 00:55:31,723
Might even do it tonight.
Feeling lucky.

897
00:55:32,273 --> 00:55:34,212
Good. You might win enough
to pay for dinner.

898
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:35,875
And if I don't?

899
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:39,899
We'll eat anyway.

900
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,782
Grandma, what would
I do without you?

901
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:45,168
(SCREAMS)

902
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,660
Oh! Why, you pig.

903
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:48,682
I'll be back for supper.

904
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:57,981
When did
Mr. Swain check in?

905
00:55:58,053 --> 00:55:59,262
Last night.
Thank you.

906
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:05,362
Who was the nosy Parker?

907
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:07,795
From the sound of him,
I'd say he came from Texas.

908
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,096
What did he want to know?

909
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,022
All about you
and your brother.

910
00:56:12,045 --> 00:56:13,701
He's probably
a business friend
of my brother's.

911
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,548
Then your brother
must be doing business
with the Texas Rangers.

912
00:56:16,613 --> 00:56:18,432
I saw a star
under his coat.

913
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:28,048
Raise 200.
I'll call.

914
00:56:28,113 --> 00:56:30,825
Wes. Oh, Wes,
a man just stole
my diamond ring.

915
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,381
He's still at the hotel.
Hurry, before he gets away.

916
00:56:34,247 --> 00:56:35,194
Sorry, gentlemen.

917
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:38,939
I hate to leave
in the middle of a game,
especially when I'm ahead.

918
00:56:39,454 --> 00:56:42,166
Oh, wait a minute,
I've got three kings.

919
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,920
I'm sorry, three aces.

920
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,246
Wes, Wes, never mind
the money. My ring. My ring.

921
00:56:47,887 --> 00:56:49,226
I'll be back, gentlemen.

922
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:57,746
What is it?

923
00:56:57,821 --> 00:56:59,379
Wes, the Rangers,
they're here!

924
00:56:59,451 --> 00:57:00,855
What would the Rangers
be doing in Kansas?

925
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,371
I don't know, but there's
one of them at the hotel
looking for you.

926
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,307
Get out of here, Rosie.
There's gonna be
some shooting.

927
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:11,612
No, Wes, no.

928
00:57:11,687 --> 00:57:13,091
Go back to the hotel.

929
00:58:46,529 --> 00:58:47,803
What is it, Rosie?

930
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:51,860
All the time we've been here
and you won't even bother
to unpack.

931
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,967
Or hang up the curtains.

932
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,183
Complaining about
your housekeeper again?

933
00:58:58,253 --> 00:58:59,200
Yes.

934
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,882
Listen, Wes,
I was born on a farm.

935
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:05,880
My father marched away
from a farm,

936
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:07,890
tall and brave in
a fine new uniform.

937
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:09,646
I never saw him again.

938
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:14,028
My mother died on a farm,
giving birth to his son.

939
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,740
I saw plenty of farms
after that, too.

940
00:59:16,813 --> 00:59:18,850
People sweating and digging
their lives away.

941
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:22,909
I saw them slaving so they
could save up a few pennies
for that rainy day.

942
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:26,037
It never rains, Wes,
it pours.

943
00:59:26,205 --> 00:59:27,729
It doesn't have
to be that way.

944
00:59:28,089 --> 00:59:29,363
Well, that's
how it is.

945
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:33,449
If the weather doesn't get
you, the grasshoppers do,
the taxes or the mortgage.

946
00:59:33,935 --> 00:59:36,386
Or the State of Alabama
starts a war with
the State of Georgia,

947
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:39,299
and you get killed
by some fool bullet
meant for a general.

948
00:59:39,524 --> 00:59:42,618
So you never hope
and you never plan because
someday you might get hurt?

949
00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:43,926
If that's the way
you want to say it.

950
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:45,522
Well, I know a card game, too.

951
00:59:46,426 --> 00:59:48,724
I know that
if you want to win,
you've got to take a chance.

952
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,129
You gotta add something
to the pot.

953
00:59:50,195 --> 00:59:52,874
Yeah, but you can't win,
Wes, if you're holding
my kind of cards.

954
00:59:52,942 --> 00:59:53,922
How do you mean?

955
00:59:53,997 --> 00:59:55,456
I mean you, Wes.

956
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:58,306
Now you have to sweat
from sunup to sundown
every day for a year

957
00:59:58,372 --> 01:00:00,921
to earn $1,000,
if you're lucky.

958
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:02,876
You used to be
the kind of man who would
sit in a card game

959
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,847
and win that much money
in one night.

960
01:00:06,423 --> 01:00:07,795
Haven't you been
thinking about that, Wes?

961
01:00:07,861 --> 01:00:10,823
Sure, I've thought
all about that,
but this farm is what I want.

962
01:00:10,896 --> 01:00:13,412
Yeah, yeah,
you want it now.
It's new, it's a toy.

963
01:00:13,483 --> 01:00:16,063
And when you get tired of it,
you're gonna wander into town,
pick up a hand,

964
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:17,658
and have to shoot your way
out of town again.

965
01:00:17,795 --> 01:00:19,734
A man can change, can't he?

966
01:00:20,926 --> 01:00:22,865
Prove it to me, Wes.
Prove it.

967
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,138
Because you got no right
to ask me to change

968
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:29,899
until you can prove it.

969
01:00:40,188 --> 01:00:41,135
Rosie!

970
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:45,742
Rosie! Come here, quick.

971
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:52,098
What is it?

972
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:53,114
Wes.

973
01:00:54,882 --> 01:00:55,829
What is it?

974
01:00:58,045 --> 01:00:58,992
(GASPS)

975
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:12,991
Come in, Parson.
Come in. Come in.

976
01:01:17,564 --> 01:01:18,936
PARSON: Is this the bride?

977
01:01:23,026 --> 01:01:24,169
WES: It sure is.

978
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,463
My, what a pretty dress.
And such a lovely bride!

979
01:01:40,373 --> 01:01:44,522
"Dearly beloved, we are
gathered together here
in the sight of God..."

980
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,094
No trace of Hardin since
you let him get away
from you in Kansas City?

981
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,658
No, sir,
and I don't think
he's in Texas.

982
01:01:49,731 --> 01:01:50,678
Why?

983
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:52,660
Well, these recent killings
don't fit his pattern.

984
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:54,999
He's never been
a thief or a bandit
or a bully.

985
01:01:55,386 --> 01:01:58,131
I think the local officers
just charge every unsolved
shooting to Hardin.

986
01:01:58,644 --> 01:02:00,681
He's a killer all right,
but he's brave and...

987
01:02:00,752 --> 01:02:04,868
John Wesley Hardin has made
the name of Texas stink
in the nostrils of justice,

988
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:08,067
and I want him brought in
here no matter where he is.

989
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,238
Yes, sir.

990
01:02:09,474 --> 01:02:11,259
His brother and uncle
still live up near Bonham,
don't they?

991
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:12,273
Yes, sir.

992
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:14,963
Well, he's bound to get
in touch with them or drop in
on them sooner or later.

993
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:18,092
Yes, sir. We have a man
staked out, checking every
move and watching the mail.

994
01:02:18,258 --> 01:02:19,717
I'd like to take a run
down there myself, sir.

995
01:02:20,048 --> 01:02:23,205
Good. Don't get
too fond of him, Duncan.

996
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,707
If you want
to sing his praises,

997
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,323
we'll give you a chance
to recite a eulogy
over his grave

998
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,765
after we hang him.

999
01:02:29,215 --> 01:02:30,391
Yes, sir.
That's all.

1000
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:32,595
Yes, sir.
We'll bring him in, sir.

1001
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:35,793
All right, bring him in alive,
if you can.

01:02:42,664 --> 01:02:45,049
Hi, honey.
I'm hungrier than a bear.

1004
01:02:45,124 --> 01:02:46,975
Well, you ought to be.
Your food's been
waiting an hour.

1005
01:02:47,105 --> 01:02:48,509
Now it's all cold.

1006
01:02:48,573 --> 01:02:49,554
Well, I'm sorry.

1007
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,955
The buckskin mare's
been having a little trouble.

1008
01:02:52,024 --> 01:02:54,703
And your corn pudding's
all burned.

1009
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,636
I always promised myself
I'd never try to
tie you down,

1010
01:02:57,806 --> 01:02:59,809
tell you when to come
and when to go.

1011
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:01,667
I act like
a nagging old wife!

1012
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,793
Well, now, what's the matter?

1013
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,899
The corn pudding's
not that important.

1014
01:03:07,357 --> 01:03:08,762
The mare's about
to have her foal.

1015
01:03:10,296 --> 01:03:13,009
Well, horses aren't
the only thing born
on a farm, Wes Hardin.

1016
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:17,799
Rosie!

1017
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,929
You mean you? Us?

1018
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:23,615
If it'd been a mare,
you'd have known
weeks ago.

1019
01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:27,857
Wes! Wes!

1020
01:03:28,217 --> 01:03:29,872
Wes! Wes.

1021
01:03:54,922 --> 01:03:58,179
"...and we expect the baby
around the end of October.

1022
01:03:58,245 --> 01:04:02,013
"I am sure it will be a boy
and I'm going to name him
after you."

1023
01:04:03,196 --> 01:04:04,143
Women.

1024
01:04:04,793 --> 01:04:06,732
Since when is
the Good Lord letting on

1025
01:04:06,806 --> 01:04:09,104
whether it's boys
or girls coming into
this world?

1026
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,781
"We have a real fine
farm here

1027
01:04:11,853 --> 01:04:16,286
"and we both wish that you
and Joe could come for
a visit sometime soon."

1028
01:04:17,156 --> 01:04:18,844
Maybe we could, Pa.

1029
01:04:19,775 --> 01:04:22,193
Maybe next winter
after the boy is born.

1030
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,982
I'll be back
day after tomorrow, Rosie.

1031
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:30,475
Will you be all right?
Sure, Wes.

1032
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,577
Oh, Wes...

1033
01:04:35,651 --> 01:04:37,471
Aw, there won't be
any trouble, Rosie.

1034
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:39,452
I've been to
horse auctions before.

1035
01:04:39,518 --> 01:04:41,903
No. No, no,
it's not that, Wes.

1036
01:04:42,616 --> 01:04:45,426
It's something I've been
wanting to say to you
for a long time.

1037
01:04:47,152 --> 01:04:49,700
You remember
when I was being stubborn,

1038
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:51,905
when I said I didn't think
you could ever change any?

1039
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:53,114
Yeah?

1040
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,038
Well, I was wrong.

1041
01:04:55,202 --> 01:04:57,620
I know what's
happened to me.

1042
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,471
Nothing's gonna
change me back to the way
I was, Wes, nothing.

1043
01:05:02,454 --> 01:05:04,871
I guess all a person needs
is half a chance.

1044
01:05:05,745 --> 01:05:08,706
I feel safe here, Wes,
and settled.

1045
01:05:09,257 --> 01:05:12,155
And I don't care if I never
see to the other side
of the next mountain

1046
01:05:12,452 --> 01:05:15,349
because this is
where I want to be,
with you.

1047
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,017
Sure, honey.

1048
01:05:17,723 --> 01:05:21,197
I always heard women
get nervous and fidgety
around this time.

1049
01:05:21,621 --> 01:05:24,234
They get their heads
full of queer ideas.

1050
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:26,439
Well, you go
right on talking.

1051
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:43,115
Wes, hurry home.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

1053
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:05,631
Oh, Dan?

1054
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:08,348
Will you do me a favor
and take him over to
the livery stable.

1055
01:06:08,515 --> 01:06:10,006
Tell them I'll be back
in a couple of days.

1056
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,899
Mr. Swain, I'll do that.

1057
01:06:15,607 --> 01:06:16,554
That's him.

1058
01:06:22,475 --> 01:06:24,033
Round-trip ticket
to Pensacola, please.

1059
01:06:24,104 --> 01:06:25,411
Pensacola?

1060
01:06:27,139 --> 01:06:28,511
Where's Dick Taylor today?

1061
01:06:28,704 --> 01:06:31,732
He took the day off
for himself. I'm filling in
for him, Wes.

1062
01:06:32,091 --> 01:06:34,127
Put your hands up, Hardin.
You're under arrest.

1063
01:06:35,221 --> 01:06:38,314
You're making a mistake,
mister. My name's Swain.
Who are you?

1064
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:40,550
A Texas Ranger and I said
put your hands up!

1065
01:06:43,335 --> 01:06:45,502
MAN: Don't shoot!
I want him alive.

1066
01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:58,051
Get his gun?
He hasn't got one.

1067
01:06:58,572 --> 01:07:00,424
All right, take him along.

1068
01:07:17,419 --> 01:07:18,943
John Wesley Hardin,

1069
01:07:19,273 --> 01:07:23,357
the jury having found you
guilty of the murder
of Sheriff Charles Webb,

1070
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:26,451
it now becomes my duty
to pronounce sentence.

1071
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:29,999
Frankly, there's no doubt
in my mind as to what
punishment you deserve,

1072
01:07:31,252 --> 01:07:35,303
but this court, jealously
guarding the traditions
of American justice,

1073
01:07:35,787 --> 01:07:39,937
refuses to sentence you in
accordance with the demands
of popular opinion.

1074
01:07:40,962 --> 01:07:43,380
And, again, we refuse
to sentence you
for other crimes

1075
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:45,872
which you are alleged
to have committed,

1076
01:07:46,202 --> 01:07:47,793
but for which you
have not been tried.

1077
01:07:50,002 --> 01:07:53,031
In the matter of the murder
of Sheriff Webb,

1078
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,195
the prosecution has failed
to bring forth any witnesses

1079
01:07:56,392 --> 01:07:59,551
who saw the actual
commission of this
particular crime.

1080
01:07:59,938 --> 01:08:02,355
Some of the alleged
witnesses are dead.

1081
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:04,314
Others have failed
to come forward.

1082
01:08:05,912 --> 01:08:08,492
Therefore, it is the sentence
of this court,

1083
01:08:09,616 --> 01:08:12,514
that you be confined
at hard labor

1084
01:08:13,099 --> 01:08:16,225
for a period of 25 years
in the State Prison
at Huntsville.

1085
01:08:16,294 --> 01:08:17,633

in the State Prison!

1088
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:27,151
Has the prisoner
anything to say?

1089
01:08:30,604 --> 01:08:32,031
Yes, I have, Your Honor.

1090
01:08:34,215 --> 01:08:37,471
If you and the jury
weren't afraid of
public opinion,

1091
01:08:38,878 --> 01:08:40,915
I never would have
been convicted

1092
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:45,128
because I shot Charlie Webb
in self-defense
and you all know it.

1093
01:08:47,152 --> 01:08:48,611
Maybe I did wrong,

1094
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,045
maybe I deserve
to be punished,

1095
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:53,602
but I'm not a murderer.

1096
01:08:54,979 --> 01:08:57,527
I never killed a man
who didn't try
to kill me first.

1097
01:08:59,099 --> 01:09:00,275
Take him away.

1098
01:09:13,347 --> 01:09:16,309
Keep the place, Rosie,
no matter what.

1099
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:18,262
I will, Wes.
I promise.

Amy, a true story.

What kind of a story is it?

1119

I don't know yet, Amy,

1120
01:10:39,246 --> 01:10:42,208

know how this story
is going to end.

I wanted to come home
this way, Rosie.

Kind of like I was just
coming back from that
horse auction at Pensacola,

The place looks fine, Rosie.

1130
01:12:19,521 --> 01:12:20,893
You're looking so pretty.

1131
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:23,186
Prettier than I remembered.

1132
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:28,746
Dreamt of you, Rosie,

1133
01:12:29,582 --> 01:12:32,066
every night and every day
for all these years.

1134
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,873
I dreamed of you
for so hard that

1135
01:12:36,323 --> 01:12:38,905
I couldn't rightly
remember what you
looked like anymore.

1136
01:12:40,029 --> 01:12:42,326
I nearly went crazy
trying to draw a picture
of you in my mind.

1137
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:45,735
I know, Wes. I know.
A woman dreams, too.

1138
01:12:55,522 --> 01:12:59,409
We tried to keep
the place together, Wes.
We got some good horses.

1139
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:07,305
We whitewashed the stables
every spring and we tried
to get the house painted.

1140

Is that him?

1141
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,033
Yes.

is he, Rosie?

01:13:23,409 --> 01:13:27,232
John's almost a man now.
He's worked like one
since he was 12.

He's been waiting
a long time for this day.

01:13:34,367 --> 01:13:35,770
We both have.

01:13:58,485 --> 01:13:59,791
Hello, Son.

01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,105
You must be...

01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:04,606
Yep.

1149
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:10,582
Your ma said you were
grown-up, but I didn't
expect to see a man.

1150
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:14,454
Ma says if I keep on growing,
I'll be as tall as you.

1151

You're strong, too.

1152
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:20,550
You've worked hard,
haven't you, Son?

1153
01:14:21,389 --> 01:14:23,110
I don't mind working.

1154
01:14:23,945 --> 01:14:28,759
Well, now that there's two
of us, maybe you'll have time
for some fun once in a while.

1155
01:14:32,505 --> 01:14:35,467
Nice pony. Is he yours?

1156
01:14:35,636 --> 01:14:37,520
I guess he's
rightly yours, now.

1157
01:14:38,288 --> 01:14:39,660
Well, you worked
the place, Son.

1158
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,423
I figure everything here
belongs as much to you
as to...

1159
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,938
You ought to
remember this, Pa.
It's yours.

1160
01:14:47,648 --> 01:14:51,731
Sometimes people come
out here asking to see it.
I keep it loaded, too.

1161
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:55,942
Is this how you
used to do it, Pa?

1162
01:14:57,295 --> 01:14:59,266
How come you never put
any notches on your gun?

1163
01:15:42,688 --> 01:15:44,659
John, did you see
your father?

1164
01:15:45,051 --> 01:15:46,609
Where are you going?

1165
01:15:55,147 --> 01:15:59,166
Wes. What is it?
What's wrong?
What did you say to him?

1166
01:15:59,236 --> 01:16:01,751
I hit him, Rosie.
I hit him.

1167
01:16:03,004 --> 01:16:04,213
Why? Why?

1168
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:06,485
That gun!

1169
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:10,852
He put it on
and it was me, 20 years ago.

1170
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,474
Thinking I could
lick the world with a gun!

1171
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:16,197
I went crazy and I hit him.

1172
01:16:16,262 --> 01:16:18,940
It'll be all right, Wes.
You'll explain it to him.
It'll be all right.

1173
01:16:19,009 --> 01:16:22,319
I don't think it will, Rosie.
He'll be out
looking for trouble.

1174
01:16:22,491 --> 01:16:24,015
Don't say that.
He's a good boy.

1175
01:16:24,088 --> 01:16:25,514
He'll be out
looking for trouble!

1176
01:16:25,589 --> 01:16:27,147
What do you mean?

1177
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,864
It's happened before.
It's happened to me.
I remember.

1178
01:16:29,934 --> 01:16:31,905
My pa and me!

1179
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:34,397
I'm going after him.
I'm gonna bring him home.

1180
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:41,878
Hello, John.
What can I do for you?

1181
01:16:41,945 --> 01:16:43,088
Whisky.

1182
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:45,959
I didn't know
you'd started drinking.

1183
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,455
You seen your Pa?

1184
01:16:48,558 --> 01:16:51,335
The boys said they seen him
coming through town
a little while ago.

1185
01:16:51,402 --> 01:16:54,179
Look, I came in here
for a drink, not to answer
a lot of dumb questions.

1186
01:16:54,244 --> 01:16:56,029
All right, all right.

1187
01:16:56,096 --> 01:16:58,035
Whisky. What makes you
so tough today, Hardin?

1188
01:16:58,109 --> 01:16:59,830
'Cause your old man is home?

1189
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:01,520
Figures the old man will
back him up.

1190
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:02,995
Why don't you shut up!

1191
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,641
Think you're man enough?
Why don't you make me
shut up?

1192
01:17:05,712 --> 01:17:08,773
Maybe he'll show us
his pa's famous trick of
carrying a gun under his vest

1193
01:17:08,843 --> 01:17:10,727
so he can shoot
a man in the back
when he ain't looking.

1194
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,819
You better go on home, son.
No sense in starting
anything with him.

1195
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:16,536
You know... You know,
if I was Wes Hardin,

1196
01:17:16,605 --> 01:17:19,415
and came home from the pen
after 16 years,
first thing I'd do

1197
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:23,052
is un-limber my six-gun
and start banging away
at the nearest target.

1198
01:17:23,122 --> 01:17:24,265
(LAUGHS)

1199
01:17:24,336 --> 01:17:28,519
Especially if I was coming
home to a swell-Iooking
woman like Mrs. Hardin.

1200
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:30,469
Easy, Son, easy.

1201
01:17:30,565 --> 01:17:32,350
You stay out of this.
It's my fight.

1202
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,203
There's not gonna
be any fight.

1203
01:17:35,101 --> 01:17:37,170
Here's his gun. Keep it.

1204
01:17:38,423 --> 01:17:41,647
All right,
the boy's not armed now,
and neither am I,

1205
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:45,702
so see that you don't
shoot off anything
but your mouth.

1206
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:48,930
I'll take care of you
another time
with a horse-whip. Come on.

1207
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,075
I ain't afraid
of you, Hardin,

1208
01:17:50,147 --> 01:17:52,598
even if you have got a gun
under your coat,
so draw and fire.

1209
01:17:55,993 --> 01:17:57,932
What did I tell you?
Didn't you see him reach?

1210
01:17:58,005 --> 01:17:59,018
Give me my gun!

1211
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,997
No. Don't give it
to him.

1212
01:18:01,232 --> 01:18:03,116
Somebody get Doc Barker.

1213
01:18:06,184 --> 01:18:07,675
I thought you said
he had a gun.

1214
01:18:08,227 --> 01:18:10,612
He reached, I tell you.
You all saw it.

1215
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,278
He was wearing a gun under arm
when he killed Webb.

1216
01:18:12,349 --> 01:18:13,492
Don't try anything.

1217
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:14,935
(ALL YELLING)

1218
01:18:17,747 --> 01:18:18,728
I'll get him for this.

1219
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:22,755
No, you're not gonna live
the way I lived

1220
01:18:23,018 --> 01:18:25,567
and end up like this
on a dirty floor.

1221
01:18:26,276 --> 01:18:29,816
It'd be my fault, Son.
Don't you understand?

1222
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:32,275
Leave it alone.

1223
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,399
He'll get his,
but you leave it alone.

1224
01:18:37,617 --> 01:18:38,859
Swear it to me.

1225
01:18:39,565 --> 01:18:41,602
I swear it, Pa.
I swear it.

1226
01:18:43,782 --> 01:18:46,842
Keep him quiet for a couple
of weeks, Mrs. Hardin,
and he'll be all right.

1227
01:18:46,912 --> 01:18:48,697
I'll come out and have
another look at him
this evening.

1228
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,105
Thank you, Doctor.

1229
01:18:50,171 --> 01:18:51,575
Now, John,
you drive real slow.

1230
01:18:51,641 --> 01:18:52,915
Sure, Ma.

1231
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:57,258
Remember the last time
we rode in a wagon, Rosie?
A long time ago.

1232
01:18:57,454 --> 01:19:00,068
Yeah, but this time
is different, Wes.

1233
01:19:00,138 --> 01:19:01,696
This time we know
where we're going.

1234
01:19:02,596 --> 01:19:03,577
John?

1235
01:19:03,652 --> 01:19:04,762
Yes, Pa?

1236
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:06,292
Let's go home.
