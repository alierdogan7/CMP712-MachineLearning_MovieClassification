1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,391
Prviously on AMC's <i>Hell On Wheels...</i>

2
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:09,361
- Joseph Dutson?
- Joseph Dutson

3
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:11,274
You murdered my chief of police.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,387
***

5
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:15,129
You owe me a life for
the one you took from me.

6
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:16,490
War must continue.

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,155
If all contracts will be assigned to me.

8
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:21,960
***

9
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:24,311
I felt his spirit pass.

10
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:26,962
He's the father of my child.

11
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:30,046
I pronounce you husband and wife.

12
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:55,445
I want to register a formal protest.

13
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,030
Noted.

14
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:58,731
Have you thought of everything?

15
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,783
Course not.

16
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:05,455
It doesn't occur to me how to
engineer my own destruction.

17
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,292
We crossed the Missouri like this,

18
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:12,078
greater river than the crow.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,048
Thicker ice, colder weather.

20
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:20,503
And larger balls than my chief engineer.

21
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:24,757
You're the boss.

22
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,760
Who holdin' the money?

23
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,205
- Everybody in?
- Uh-huh.

24
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,850
You there, big fella.

25
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,152
They call me Psalms, Mr. Durant.

26
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:38,654
Psalms, yes, of course, Psalms.

27
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,240
What's the wager?

28
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,910
How far across before the engineer jump.

29
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:50,183
You don't think the train's gonna make it?

30
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:52,285
I ain't bettin' against the railroad itself,

31
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,455
Mr. Durant, just the engineer.

32
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,791
Of course.

33
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:05,882
Engineer, take it across.

34
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:41,894
Ugh!

35
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:05,251
Congratulations, Mr. Durant.

36
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,730
Red hot boiler on ice, wheels spinning.

37
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:21,684
What'd you think was gonna happen?

00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:54,302

39
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:26,954
water is sweet and good.

40
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:30,374
You get attacked by
Indians now or set fire to,

41
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:32,042
won't have to go down to the river.

42
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:36,130
You'll not be here, should that happen?

43
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:38,549
Gave you my word,

44
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,919
I'd be here till the crops is in,
baby's born.

45
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:43,754
Naomi's due any day now.

46
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:46,924
Only thing keeping me here
after that'll be Bishop Dutson.

47
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:50,978
Well, you have honored your word to me.

48
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:55,265
No doubt, he'll feel the same.

49
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:59,987
I try to walk out that gate,
he'll put a bullet in my back.

50
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:04,024
Bishop Dutson is not the
man you claim him to be.

51
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:07,161
Father Hatch, I keep telling you,

52
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:09,246
he ain't the man he claims to be.

53
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,783
An imposter could never lay on hands

54
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:16,870
and speak in tongues like Bishop Dutson.

55
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:21,091
Yeah.

56
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,293
One day you'll see.

57
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:31,435
Close the gate!

58
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:39,393
- Brother Bohannon.
- How's Cheyenne?

59
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:42,446
Sodom and gomorrah's got nothing on it.

60
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,621
Railroad started stockpiling rail yet?

61
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:52,489
Railroad's stuck and busted. I did hear

62
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:56,160
the cavalry's got the comanche on the run,
though.

63
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:59,046
Mind you don't get a haircut next time.

64
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,247
Slim pickings.

65
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:12,392
Wonderful work on the new well.

66
00:07:12,427 --> 00:07:14,578
Careful you don't fall in.

67
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:22,019
Oh,
try to enjoy God's peace within these walls.

68
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,238
Fort this pretty,

69
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:26,823
it's hard to remember I'm a prison.

70
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:31,161
You are a free man, brother Bohannon.

71
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:32,913
Free to leave, you mean?

72
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:36,533
Mm.

73
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,021
It's good to see the men
fight with their fists.

74
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:00,524
Usually,
they reach right for their knives and guns.

75
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,065
It's the final tally for the material

76
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,900
lost in the river.

77
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:18,792
I don't have this kind of money on hand.

78
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:23,413
Find it,
or the central pacific will meet us here...

79
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:26,049
In this God forsaken place.

80
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:57,364
Your wife is unhappy here, I take it.

81
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:09,176
Her father was one of your best friends.

82
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:12,338
He goes missing, you do nothing about it.

83
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:16,250
Well, at's not true. We looked everywhere.

84
00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:22,222
You know,
we really should have dinner sometime,

85
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:24,808
so we can reacquaint.
I can explain it to her.

86
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:27,394
Oh, she'd love that,

87
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:28,862
since she worries you had something to do

88
00:09:28,897 --> 00:09:32,316
with his disappearance.

89
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:35,235
Who could possibly have
put such a hairbrained idea

90
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:38,455
in her head? A Boston detective.

91
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,824
The one who came out here last year.

92
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:46,580
Her father, senator metcalf,

93
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:51,635
was one of my oldest and closest friends.

94
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:55,055
I was her godfather, for Christ's sakes!

95
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,341
Well,
that's what makes it so frightening for her.

96
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:06,100
I will do everything I can
to answer her questions.

97
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:11,155
Meanwhile, advise your wife to be cautious.

98
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:14,775
Cheyenne is a dangerous place.

99
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:45,189
Eva?

100
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:47,057
Howdy, Mr. Durant.

101
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,947
Eva, surely, you can find

102
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:57,568
something more suitable than washing whores'
bedding.

103
00:10:57,619 --> 00:11:01,538
Well, Mickey was good to give me the work.

104
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:05,159
It's either this or go back to whoring.

105
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:10,631
Look at me, Eva.

106
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:12,966
The eyes of the world are upon me,

107
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:15,302
as I stand on the verge of ruin.

108
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:18,222
Harassed on all sides, my wife left me

109
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:21,558
while I was in prison, I have no friends,

110
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:26,146
but you don't see me crying, do you?

111
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:28,949
No, so pick yourself up.

112
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:35,656
Yes, Mr. Durant.

113
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,774
Good.

114
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,449
Mr. Mayor.

115
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,086
I am seeking counsel.

116
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,339
Always happy to oblige
one of my constituents.

117
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:06,603
Ahh.The railroad.

118
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,639
Mm-hmm.

119
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,608
If you were me, what would you do?

120
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:15,612
Historically, sir, you'd have gone back east

121
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:20,284
and sold a bunch of phony
paper for millions of dollars,

122
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:23,537
but after sinking the train,

123
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:25,739
I'd say you have credibility concerns.

124
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:29,293
Correct, so what would you do now?

125
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:32,129
Sell off anything you have of value,

126
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:34,248
including that watch.

127
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,469
I'll give you a fiver for it.

128
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:44,341
I have land,
20 acres either side of the track,

129
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:50,514
and any land I can claim mineral rights to.

130
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:54,851
You should sell it... At auction.

131
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:59,106
And you should buy it, at auction.

132
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,575
I don't want it,

133
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:04,778
and I don't want that kind of trouble.

134
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,282
I made you mayor. I made you rich.

135
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:14,254
You arrived with a magic
show and a dopey smile.

136
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:18,792
You could leave with a lot less.

137
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:25,966
Post a notice, something official.

138
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:28,268
Oh, and bring cash.

139
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:31,638
And for God sakes, get Eva out of the mud.

140
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,974
Some people don't want to
be pulled out of the mud,

141
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:35,275
Mr. Durant.

142
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,062
True. Don't be one of them.

143
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,251
Here.

144
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:13,847
Go ahead and read it.

145
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:23,240
Your railroad's fallen
behind during the winter.

146
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,359
Durant sunk a train into the crow river

147
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,694
and called it a minor setback, so...

148
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:30,530
He struggles,
probably 'cause you're not there.

149
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:40,006
"Chief engineer Martin
Delaney announced today."

150
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,543
Damn it! I can't believe this.

151
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:46,930
- What is it?
- I can't believe

152
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:50,300
durant hadn't fired that
idiot Martin Delaney by now.

153
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:53,887
I beat him out for the job once already.

154
00:14:55,556 --> 00:15:00,060
I know how much that railroad means to you.

155
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:02,529
You came out here to build it,

156
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:06,032
not live a life among
people who aren't your own,

157
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:09,703
with a wife that you may not love.

158
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:39,599
Come to the railroad huntin'...

159
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:43,236
The men who murdered my wife and child.

160
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:50,827
Killed the ones I could find.

161
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:51,746
Now, Naomi...

162
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,922
You're married to a killer.

163
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,702
You're just tryin'
to scare me into not lovin' you

164
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:18,205
so you can leave.

165
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:24,311
No, I'm just bein' truthful is all.

166
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:28,381
You can leave, Cullen.

167
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,985
I'll be all right.

168
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,327
Thank you.

169
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:16,029
It's quite all right.

170
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:21,835
Bread, husband?

171
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:25,455
Why don't you have a seat? Rest a spell.

172
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,043
There you go.

173
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:45,141
Well, I'm glad.

174
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:48,695
After four months among us,
you're making friends.

175
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:50,981
I can count 'em all on one finger.

176
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:53,366
Hmm.

177
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:57,370
Brother dultey.

178
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:01,124
I talk to him, he talks to me.

179
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:05,879
Especially when he returns
from his trips to Cheyenne.

180
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:14,087
Let go of Cheyenne, your former life.

181
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:20,927
- Uh-huh.
- Mm.

182
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:27,183
I want to talk to you about something,
Bishop.

183
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:28,935
Yes?

184
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:33,406
That thing you said about freedom earlier.

185
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:35,659
Hmm?

186
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:38,028
I think I finally understand it.

187
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,414
Good. Good!

188
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:46,252
- And... and something else.
- Mm-hmm?

189
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:48,538
I had me a vision.

190
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:54,561
Tell me.

191
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:59,933
I had me a vision that I
was leaving this place.

192
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:04,471
But why?

193
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:09,109
Th-there's still...
So much to be done with you.

194
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:11,978
I don't know, I just...

195
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,032
Saw myself walkin'
straight through that gate.

196
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,401
No, no. Walkin' right out

197
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:20,870
through that gate, whistling<i> Dixie.</i>

198
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:28,662
You...
you would not abandon your wife and child.

199
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:34,084
Yeah.

200
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:40,090
I wouldn't worry none.

201
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:46,513
It's just a vision.

202
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,815
Hmm.

203
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:06,209
Mr. Campbell,
general grant will see you now.

204
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,287
General grant.

205
00:20:13,442 --> 00:20:16,861
With my election assured,
I'm sending you west, Campbell.

206
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:19,280
Wyoming. Ever hear of it?

207
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:21,783
- Vaguely.
- Lawless place.

208
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:25,453
Union pacific has gotten
itself bogged down out there.

209
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:27,455
Things are running amok.

210
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,547
I don't think I'm the man
you want to send there.

211
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,665
You will not be returning to Atlanta.

212
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:41,386
My work there is incomplete.

213
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,422
I'm saving you from yourself, Campbell.

214
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:47,258
You were a bit overzealous.

215
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,677
Mistakes were made, but order was restored.

216
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,729
And you'll do the same as
the provisional governor

217
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:55,350
of Wyoming. Good luck, sir.

218
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:06,361
General, you honor me with this opportunity.

219
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:19,040
The greatest good

220
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:22,794
to the greatest number
is the object to attain.

221
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:26,798
This requires security of
person and property in every...

222
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:30,184
Gentlemen, the general is very pleased

223
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:32,387
with our success in Atlanta.

224
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,389
He's not giving us the boot?

225
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:35,807
On the contrary,

226
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:38,443
he appointed me governor of a new territory.

227
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:40,361
- Which one?
- Wyoming.

228
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:43,481
- Never heard of it.
- The frontier.

229
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:45,116
It's a wilderness.

230
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,985
This is worse than getting the boot.

231
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:50,321
Well, not so fast. There's gold out west.

232
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:51,656
Free land out here,

233
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:54,542
opportunities for those with a keen eye.

234
00:21:56,328 --> 00:21:59,881
This is not a place of hooded rascals,

235
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:02,083
a city in ashes.

236
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:05,753
It's wild, surely,
but so is an unbroken horse.

237
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:08,806
We'll break it.

238
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:12,844
You'll be provisional marshal
of the whole territory.

239
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:14,646
You'll be the judge.

240
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,181
You'll be the treasurer.

241
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:19,567
Grant says all this?

242
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:23,438
Pack your gear. No carpet bags.

243
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:30,495
Wyoming.

244
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:33,498
Good morning, gentlemen.

245
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,950
This morning, you have a rare opportunity

246
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:38,086
to buy some very valuable land.

247
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,006
Now, what bid do I hear

248
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:46,878
for parcel 21 in the north valley?

249
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:49,430
It breaks my heart to offer it.

250
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:51,766
Ours too. It's open range.

251
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,101
What if somebody fences it in?

252
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:55,803
That open range, as you call it,

253
00:22:55,805 --> 00:23:00,274
was granted by the largess of
the union pacific railroad.

254
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:02,276
$400.

255
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:04,228
$500.

256
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:09,317
$500. The bid is $500, gentlemen.

257
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:12,487
And the advance?

258
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:17,075
$501.

259
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:23,664
$501. Going once, going twice...

260
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:27,418
$600.

261
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:28,753
Mrs. Palmer.

262
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:30,838
Just what is this stunt, Thomas?

263
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,258
This is an auction, Maggie.

264
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:36,260
Hmm, I see that.

265
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:38,763
I thought we had an agreement
about the use of this UP land

266
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:40,765
- for free range.
- Yes, and perhaps

267
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,767
you can strike a similar
deal with the new owner,

268
00:23:42,818 --> 00:23:44,402
whomever that may be.

269
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:47,071
I struck a deal with you,
durant, in perpetuity.

270
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:50,324
Now,
you're reneging behind your flunky here.

271
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:53,661
I'm not a flunky. I'm the mayor of Cheyenne.

272
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:55,696
If you're looking for a range war,

273
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:57,031
just say, "Barbed wire."

274
00:23:57,066 --> 00:24:02,136
I'm looking at a bid of $600.

275
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:04,705
$601.

276
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,457
$1,000.

277
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:14,766
$1,001.

278
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,218
$2,000.

279
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:24,559
I'm going to ruin this scheme.

280
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:27,945
$2,001?

281
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,730
$3,000.

282
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:37,906
Oh.

283
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,246
Shh.

284
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:05,600
Hey. Hey! Hey!

285
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:14,942
Hello, down there!

286
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:17,044
Drop down that ladder, Bishop.

287
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,247
Brother Bohannon, I've been contemplating

288
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:21,282
your vision to leave us.

289
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:28,523
When was the last time you had to draw a gun

290
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:32,226
or raise a hand in violence?

291
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:35,096
Isn't there a peace in that?

292
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,768
I was hoping digging
this hole into the earth

293
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:43,554
would give you time to
contemplate your soul,

294
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:45,857
a daily reminder of...

295
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:49,977
Of our need to return to the light.

296
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:55,983
God has put me on earth to save your soul,
brother Bohannon.

297
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:58,202
I believe you believe that.

298
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:01,422
Don't say no to this second chance.

299
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:06,127
Beautiful young wife and precious son,

300
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:10,631
whose arrival may be heralded as we speak.

301
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,266
The ladder.

302
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:16,404
God has spoken to me that it is a boy,
you know?

303
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,079
- Cullen!
- Drop down that ladder.

304
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:32,119
Will you use this time to
meditate on these words?

305
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:37,124
Cullen! Cullen!

306
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,594
Throw down that ladder!

307
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:43,030
- Cullen!
- Ugh! Bishop!

308
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:44,765
Cullen!

309
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,134
Bishop!

310
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:54,035
Bishop asked me about your leaving.

311
00:26:54,037 --> 00:26:55,536
Yeah? What'd you tell him?

312
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:58,956
Nothin', I thought you liked it here.

313
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:05,596
No, we wait.

314
00:27:06,882 --> 00:27:08,099
To hell with that.

315
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:12,103
Cullen, please!

316
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:15,807
You too?

317
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:17,608
I don't want that sumbitch
anywhere near my wife.

318
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:19,477
There seems to be

319
00:27:19,528 --> 00:27:22,196
a difficulty in the birthing.

320
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:26,484
She's begging for the gentile.

321
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:27,735
Cullen!

322
00:27:27,737 --> 00:27:30,404
Cullen!

323
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,209
Let me go.

324
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:38,162
Please?

325
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:43,467
Oh, Cullen, please!

326
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:54,478
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

327
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:56,264
It's okay.

328
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:58,316
You're gonna have to turn the baby.

329
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,186
We're doing that.

330
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:03,821
Do it faster.

331
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:06,357
We're doing the best we can.

332
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:09,694
She's young, healthy.

333
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:11,362
My first wife was young

334
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:13,247
and healthy, and we lost twins.

335
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:17,335
Do it.

336
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:19,620
Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's all right.

337
00:28:19,622 --> 00:28:20,922
It's all right.

338
00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:22,456
It's all right.

339
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,542
And you made me an enemy of Maggie Palmer

340
00:28:24,593 --> 00:28:28,212
- and her cattlemen.
- Shitkickers and cow-punchers.

341
00:28:28,263 --> 00:28:30,298
She called me your flunky.

342
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,601
Ah, the grit in your oyster.

343
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:37,054
Mr. Mcginnes, you are the mayor of Cheyenne,

344
00:28:37,105 --> 00:28:40,391
and now, the second largest property owner

345
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:42,894
in the entire Wyoming territory.

346
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:45,029
You wiped me out.

347
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:48,783
Merely transferring money
from one ledger to another.

348
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:50,368
Thank you.

349
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:53,738
Ah. Flunky, no.

350
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:55,990
Partner, yes.

351
00:29:01,296 --> 00:29:03,998
You are not your brother, Michael.

352
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:25,319
Pray for me.

353
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:39,333
Please?

354
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,589
who art in heaven.

355
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:51,462
Shit, forgot the rest of it.

356
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:08,612
Hallowed be thy name.

357
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,200
Thy kingdom come,

358
00:30:13,235 --> 00:30:14,952
thy will be done...

359
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:16,404
On earth...

360
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:22,076
And forgive us our trespasses,

361
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:23,494
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

362
00:30:34,884 --> 00:30:37,269
Careless bitch.

363
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,554
Look what you've done.

364
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:42,557
I'm not gonna be an improvement to you.

365
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,308
As head of the family,

366
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:19,928
you should be the first to hold him.

367
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:36,611
Bless you, Bishop Dutson,
for saving us with your prayers.

368
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:44,202
Lord God, bless this child,

369
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:50,675
yours, mine, ours.

370
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,677
Forever and ever, amen.

371
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:56,098
Amen.

372
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:06,558
And bless you, my children.

373
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,064
God's will be done.

374
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,295
Wire Omaha to ship rail and ties.

375
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,414
That's the new bank ledger.

376
00:32:29,465 --> 00:32:31,967
This came for you.

377
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:35,086
Confidential, from general grant.

378
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:36,588
You got company comin',

379
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:38,340
new provisional governor of Wyoming.

380
00:32:38,342 --> 00:32:40,509
"John Campbell and staff."

381
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:44,913
You're to show Campbell every
courtesy and assistance.

382
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:48,183
Don't overstep, Delaney.

383
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:53,488
General grant sends his
best to me and Mrs. Delaney.

384
00:32:56,692 --> 00:33:00,278
First,
my own company sends you to spy on me,

385
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:04,366
and now, the government sends an overseer.

386
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:06,535
Everyone knows what you're capable of.

387
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:16,878
Steady, you son of a bitch!

388
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:25,220
I am capable of anything,
as your wife so clearly intuits.

389
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:33,228
I never said killing her
father was a bad idea.

390
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:44,039
What was your father's name?

391
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:53,381
William. William Edgar.

392
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:58,920
William. Did you like him?

393
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:05,343
I like him better the older I get.

394
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:09,814
Yankees shot him.

395
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,933
Let's name him William.

396
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,033
I like it.

397
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:31,620
We're leaving here together,

398
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:34,289
you, me, and baby William,

399
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:36,258
but you can't tell nobody
till right before we go,

400
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,728
you understand?

401
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:45,433
You want me? Y-you want us?

402
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:54,109
Yes.

403
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:16,164
You promised my husband a life for a life

404
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,166
after you hung my son.

405
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:31,730
There's more to it than that.

406
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:36,901
Yes, there is.

407
00:35:36,936 --> 00:35:43,024
Every time I see you,
all I can think about is my Jeb

408
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:47,195
swinging from that horrible
noose at your hand.

409
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:51,049
I'm sorry, mother Hatch.

410
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:58,056
It's not your...
Your sorrow, your pity I want.

411
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,593
I want you to leave this place.

412
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:06,681
The sight of you sickens me,
as it does others.

413
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:13,521
Naomi will raise the child as her brother.

414
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:19,361
His name shall be Jebediah Hatch.

415
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:24,866
In time, you will be forgotten.

416
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:29,337
Naomi is young and healthy
and will outlive her husbands,

417
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:32,791
as is our custom...

418
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:36,378
Beginning with you.

419
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,249
Jesus.

420
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:20,584
Shh, shh.

421
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,775
What happened to you?

422
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:30,030
I've done all I can for you, Eva.

423
00:37:30,086 --> 00:37:31,670
Twice I gave you train
fare out of this place,

424
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:34,122
and you still don't leave.

425
00:37:34,124 --> 00:37:37,542
Shh.

426
00:37:37,593 --> 00:37:40,212
There's no place for me in this world,
Mickey.

427
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:43,740
You bring it all on yourself.

428
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,718
You involved yourself with a... negro.

429
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:55,894
I loved Elam.

430
00:37:55,945 --> 00:37:57,863
You loved him so much

431
00:37:57,897 --> 00:38:02,784
that you gave away the baby that he adored.

432
00:38:06,122 --> 00:38:07,956
That ain't right.

433
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:16,465
You should never have left off the whoring.

434
00:38:19,085 --> 00:38:20,635
You were good at that.

435
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:26,725
A natural.

436
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:32,647
All women are whores by nature...

437
00:38:32,682 --> 00:38:35,267
I suppose except for me mum.

438
00:38:41,524 --> 00:38:46,161
It's the one thing that
all women have in common.

439
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:51,116
Whoring.

440
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:59,174
Just whores.

441
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:02,594
At the end of the day...

442
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:04,880
They're all whores.

443
00:39:08,885 --> 00:39:12,104
Is everything where you thought it would be?

444
00:39:12,138 --> 00:39:15,557
What?

445
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:19,895
I said, "is everything where
you thought it would be?"

446
00:39:22,815 --> 00:39:26,034
I...

447
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:28,787
I wouldn't...

448
00:39:28,821 --> 00:39:31,072
Didn't mean to.

449
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,840
Maggie! Join me.

450
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:50,892
I actually liked you until today.

451
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:52,761
Oh, you still like me.

452
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:55,847
You just don't trust me.
That's perfectly normal.

453
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:03,905
I had to do it, Maggie. I needed the money.

454
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,742
So here you sit with your money, alone.

455
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:13,498
I'm expecting the new
governor of the territory.

456
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,083
His train is late.

457
00:40:15,117 --> 00:40:19,454
One day,
you will need someone that you can trust.

458
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:24,092
All you'll find is a room of...
empty chairs.

459
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,766
I have bags just like those.

460
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:35,020
Oh, those are your bags,

461
00:40:35,054 --> 00:40:36,605
and here is your bill.

462
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,440
Bill?

463
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:52,571
Figured you'd bring the threat.

464
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:54,155
A plea.

465
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:57,292
Well,
things can be two at once in your mouth.

466
00:40:57,326 --> 00:41:02,097
You kill me outright,
you'll be seen for what you are.

467
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:06,001
Hmm. I kill you outright,

468
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:09,237
you'd be some kind of Saint, and I'd hang.

469
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:15,977
Once outside those gates,
I cannot guarantee your safety.

470
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:21,099
Our safety. Taking my family with me.

471
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,984
Your family?

472
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:24,486
That's right.

473
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:31,326
Oh. Hmm.

474
00:41:49,378 --> 00:41:52,430
You not allowing me to leave...

475
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:56,017
Is that as Bishop Dutson,

476
00:41:56,052 --> 00:42:01,790
or as The Swede,
also known as Thor Gundersen?

477
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:07,362
The late Thor Gundersen was Norwegian.

478
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:11,950
Oh.

479
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:14,402
Well...

480
00:42:14,404 --> 00:42:17,539
Whoever you are...

481
00:42:17,573 --> 00:42:20,241
You better shoot to kill.

482
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:27,499
I'm coming back to finish
this once and for all.
