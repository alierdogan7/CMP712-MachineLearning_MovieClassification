00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,203
Shovel right over there
if you care to help.

185
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,323
You look well.

186
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
<i>So do you.</i>

187
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,842
I swear you look the same
as the day I left.

188
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,849
Now there you go lying again.

189
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,849
I don't recall you being

190
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,849
so distrustful of folks,
Mary Alice.

191
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,088
I'd never lie to you.

192
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,164
Well, I seem to recall you
saying something about

193
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,562
coming back after the war.

194
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,211
Well, I better let you
get back to your work.

195
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,801
Maybe after I get settled
we could ride out to the bluffs

196
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,809
like we used to.

197
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,241
That wouldn't be right.

198
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,163
I'm married.

199
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,163
Married?

200
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,279
Going on eight years now.

201
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,329
I have a little boy, Charlie.

202
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,489
I thought you knew.

203
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,128
No. No, I did not know that.

204
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,609
I waited for you.

205
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,042
But when the years passed
and there was no word and...

206
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,289
Mary Alice, you do not
owe me an explanation.

207
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,681
Who did you marry?

208
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,168
Tom Watson.

209
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,208
Tom's a good man.

210
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,324
Yes, he is.

211
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,325
Welcome home, John Henry.

212
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,481
Shit!

213
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,969
All right.
Bring 'em in, come on.

214
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,320
[horse whinnies]

215
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,165
What the... Dan!

216
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,080
We was just coming
to pay you a visit.

217
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,399
Appreciate you saving us a ride.

218
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,244
I've got nothing to say to you.

219
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,408
Oh well,

220
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,568
I got something to say to you.

221
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,562
[Spits]

222
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,400
[grunting]

223
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,406
[groans]

224
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,329
[groans]

225
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,363
[laughs]

226
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,439
That's enough.

227
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,967
You don't wanna
kill him now, do ya?

228
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,321
Well maybe I do. I...

229
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,410
I hadn't decided yet.

230
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,445
I'm taking him home.

231
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,442
Uh, hold on there now.

232
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,444
It ain't you who's
doing the deciding.

233
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,125
May I take him home?

234
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,529
And what if I say no?
What you gonna do about it?

235
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,523
[Spits]

236
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,569
Nothing.

237
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,439
I'm sorry. I didn't
quite hear that.

238
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,886
Nothing.

239
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,171
All right, John Henry.

240
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,484
You have my permission
to take him home.

241
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,051
Somethings troubling you?

242
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,810
Your mother and I kept
asking ourselves,

243
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,127
asking God,

244
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,762
what we done wrong
in your upbringing?

245
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,611
What did we do that filled you
with so much hate?

246
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,531
It weren't you.

247
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,930
John 8:32, remember?

248
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,520
The truth will set you free.

249
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,523
God knows the truth.

250
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,519
All through the war I kept
asking myself, where was God?

251
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,966
Where was he at Shiloh
and Seven Pines

252
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,969
when men lay dead and dying?

253
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,050
All good men,
God-fearing men.

254
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,562
They just lay there, begging
for some small act of mercy

255
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,847
on His behalf.

256
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,090
And then it finally
dawned on me:

257
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,208
There ain't no God.

258
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,607
[dishes clatter]

259
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,925
There is no God?

260
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,003
All I'm saying is that
if there was ever a time

261
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,011
that man needed God it was then
and trust me, he wasn't there.

262
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,563
If you're expecting God to
save you, he ain't gonna.

263
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,848
Most men came out of that
war wanting nothing more

264
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,247
to do with killing, but not you.

265
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,930
You went looking for it.

266
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,566
God is not responsible
for the life you choose.

267
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,927
I did not choose it!

268
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,001
Get off my land.

269
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,327
We just come to finish
the conversation

270
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,727
that was interrupted, Dan.

271
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,450
DAVE:
Let us avoid unpleasantness.

272
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,884
Sir, I implore you
to see reason.

273
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,245
If you take a fair grasp of your
situation, you will arrive

274
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,647
at the only reasonable
conclusion available to you.

275
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,722
I'm stayin'.

276
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,680
Dirt and rock.

277
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,648
Exactly like the dirt and the
rocks you would find anywhere.

278
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,691
Yeah, but it's my dirt
and my rock!

279
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,679
Yes, and a fine rock it is too.

280
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,251
Is worth dying over?

281
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,681
You believe your wife
would prefer the dirt

282
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,679
and the rock to you?

283
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,679
Will this keep her warm at night

284
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,605
or put the food on the table?

285
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,968
Is it gonna teach your
children right from wrong?

286
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,679
Comfort them in their beds

287
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,083
when they're frightened
by the wind?

288
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,719
You see, I do understand.

289
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,849
I do understand. I truly do
understand the inequities

290
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,008
of your position, sir,

291
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,886
but I believe when you weigh
the alternatives,

292
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,083
you will see that...
[gunshot]

293
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,765
There was no need for that.

294
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,726
We were talking.

295
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,690
It would appear the
conversation's over now, Dave.

296
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,683
He was about to see reason.

297
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,842
CLYDE: You actually ever
kill anybody, Dave,

298
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,521
or you just talk 'em to death?

299
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,768
[gunshot]

300
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,765
Anybody else have
something to say?

301
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,727
REVEREND <i>CLAYTON:
Daniel Peterson...</i>

302
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,930
is now safely
in the embrace of our Lord.

303
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:17,730
But for us, here on earth,
a good man has been taken.

304
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,489
A provider for his family,
a friend to our community,

305
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,323
and in our despair,
we rail against God.

306
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,209
Our faith is tested,
pushed to its very limits.

307
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,530
But Almighty God has a purpose.

308
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,803
And senseless
though it may seem to us,

309
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,324
it is not for mere mortal man
to question God's wisdom.

310
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,809
It is for us to persevere
in a righteous way.

311
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,680
- We gotta do something.
Like what?

312
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,370
- I don't know.
We can't sit around doing nothing.

313
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,766
What about getting a sheriff?

314
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,571
We tried. Most men ain't got the
stomach for a fight like this.

315
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,921
We need a man who knows trouble,
a man who others fear.

316
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,284
You suppose he might
come to our aid?

317
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,967
Put that out of
your head right now.

318
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,765
We could pay him. Took
a collection. We got $200.

319
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,842
He's done with that life.

320
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,248
I can't believe James
would let it come to this.

321
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,126
They killed Daniel Peterson.

322
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,890
I never thought
they'd kill one of us.

323
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,650
It's only gonna get worse.

324
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,161
What makes you say that?

325
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,971
'Cause after the first one,
it gets easier.

326
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,839
You want something?
They heat up a good steak.

327
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,241
No, thank you.

328
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,767
Mrs. Peterson came in
and sold me her farm

329
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,881
on the way out of town.

330
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:49,248
Two other families
wanna sell also.

331
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,001
What I'm saying is, it looks
like a more aggressive approach

332
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,647
is having an effect
on the locals.

333
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,962
Clyde murdered that man.

334
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,562
From what I heard, Peterson
was holding a shotgun.

335
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,765
I did not come hereto be
part of a pack of murderers.

336
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,883
What the fuck did ya think was
gonna happen Dave, huh? What?

337
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:16,771
You think I brought you hereto
sweet-talk folk off their land?

338
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,087
Oh come on, Dave, please.

339
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,044
I want Frank
to take care of things

340
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,561
when it comes to the farms.

341
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,490
He seems to have the
temperament required.

342
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
And me?

343
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,361
Oh, I still want you here.

344
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,960
I believe it's only
a matter of time

345
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,449
before John Henry Clayton
picks up his guns.

346
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,890
Hear we're riding to the
Chadwick farm tomorrow.

347
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,406
Why don't you just
stand up on the bar

348
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,364
and announce our intention
to all creation?

349
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,849
Sorry, guess my enthusiasm
got the better of me.

350
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,651
[birds chirping]

351
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,401
You planning to eat today?

352
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,925
Ain't hungry.

353
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,924
Need to eat.
Told you, I ain't hungry.

354
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,925
You're trying to prove
something out here.

355
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,441
I ain't trying to prove nothing.

356
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,800
Yes, you are.

357
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,685
You're working this
land day in, day out.

358
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,485
You're so weary, time night
comes, you can barely move.

359
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,328
It's not for love of farming.

I know why it is.

this poor earth

362
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,562
to sweat out all
your guilt and anger.

363
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,969
That's what it is, isn't it?

364
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,769
No.

365
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,080
Just because you don't believe
me, Pa, don't make it so.

366
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,004
I told you I'm doing this
because Ma wanted it.

367
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,125
What your mother wanted was for
you to come back from the war.

368
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,369
What about you, Pa?

369
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,801
Did you want me to come back?

370
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,330
Simple enough question.

371
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,011
Did it even bother you that I
didn't come back after the war?

372
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,609
What are you talking about?

373
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,004
I'm talking about the day
you turned your back on me,

374
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:24,889
the day my brother,
William, died.

375
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,324
That's not true.

376
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,250
Ma saw it.
Why the hell do you think she

377
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,930
wanted us to
clear this field together?

378
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,724
She tried to help us
put things right.

379
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,929
There was nothing to put right.

it was yesterday.

382
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,565
Mr. Jenkins came across
William and I down river.

383
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,045
Somehow he managed to drag
us out of there,

384
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:48,201

385
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,006
He told his boy to go fetch you.

386
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,721
I was so cold and scared
I couldn't stop shaking.

387
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,763
When you arrived, I could hear
Mr. Jenkins trying to explain

388
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,644
to you that one of your sons
had passed.

389
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,047
Before you could get the
name out you rushed in

390
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,970
and you saw me.

391
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,366
And I'll never forget it.

392
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,609
The look of disappointment
on your face.

393
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,405
How could you think
such a thing?

394
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,648
Am I wrong?

395
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,090
I didn't feel any
disappointment, far from it.

396
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,361
But I would be a liar

397
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,201
if I said to you
I haven't felt it since.

398
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,079
When word came back
about your exploits,

399
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,765
I couldn't help but think

400
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,167
William might've made
more of his life.

401
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,525
Yeah.

That don't explain why there's
so many guns waiting for us.

414
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,322
Just heard Chadwick
rode through the night

415
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,886
and came back with his kin
from Landers.

416
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,771

to do such a thing?

426

effort you're putting in

427
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,447
that you're planning on staying.

428
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,319
Not sure yet.

429
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,322

If a man can't fit in here,
where can he?

433

You ever thought about
what it might've been

434
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,891
if you'd come back
after the war?

435
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,319
So you never thought about it?

436
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,245
I ain't the same as the man
that left all them years back.

437

I need to understand
why you didn't come back.

438

I think I'm entitled
to that much.

439
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,209
I'll say this,

440
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,085
and I will say no more
on the subject.

441
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,806
The thought of
coming back to you

442
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,521
was the only thing that got me
through that damn war.

443
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,406
And when it was over,
I swear to you on my life,

444
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,842
I tried coming home.

445
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,685

I gave you a red ribbon
from my hair.

Told you to hold onto it till
you could bring it back to me.

Yes, I remember.

You were right to
marry Tom, Mary Alice.

You were right.

You wanted to see me?

00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,647
I set you a simple task.

458

You wanna explain to me
how you took that task

459
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,566

in every conceivable way?

you, but to my way of thinking

no way that adds up
to all right.

dealt with quickly,

468
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,088
it could give the others ideas.

stand up to us.

00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,967

Well, others will help him.

Welcome, gentleman.

Why don't you get
the gentlemen some drinks?

548
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,200
You must be really thirsty
to be drinking in my place.

549
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,926
Let me be.

550
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,447
I heard about what
happened on the street.

551
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,531
Seems women get bolder
every year, don't they?

552
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,999
I believe I have a proposal

553
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,765
which might be of benefit
to both of us.

554
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,008
Now the last thing I want
is to interfere

in a man's marital affairs,

556
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,527
but it appears that
a change in locale for you

557
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,201
might be a solution
for both of us.

558
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,050
When you got a fox
in the henhouse,

559
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,970
only two things to do:

560
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,728
Kill the fox or
move the henhouse.

561
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,529
Sell the land, take
the money, move away.

How are you feeling?

567
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,767
I wish people would
stop asking me that.

568
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,084
It's only natural
for friends to inquire.

569
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,851
Is that what we are, Dave?

570
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,122
Friends?

571
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,084
I'd like to think so.

572
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,079
Then answer me this:
Do you think there's a place

573
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,847
for men like us to go,
get away from the killing?

574
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,248
My experience would
lead me to say no.

00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,802
After the war I swore to myself
I'd never pick up a gun again.

576
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,331
You can't go through
something like that

577
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,119

May I ask, what was
the worst of it for ya?

580
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,563
Without a doubt, Shiloh.

581
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,843
I would concur.

582
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,965
That first day at Owl Creek
I lost a lot of good friends.

583
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,050
I was there at Owl Creek.

I do not recall
seeing you there.

Well.

587
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,161
It would appear the past

00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,329
is close to repeating
itself with us.

589
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,159
I feel you and I are headed
for an inevitable conclusion.

I got no fight with you, Dave.

Besides, if I was looking for

00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,088
How so?

593
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,159

I do admire your restraint,
John Henry. I do.

the other cheek

he's gonna bite.

given you the strength

the agreement we made.

00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,241

couldn't've said that.

start don't mean much

feelings with you.

Oh well, that's very
fucking deep, Tom.

00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,128
Almost poetic.

669
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,559
And as I wipe a weepy tear
from my eye let me say this:

670
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,688
I'm not one who holds high
principles, but when a man

671
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,283
shakes my hand and says
he's gonna do something,

672
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,046
I expect him to follow through.

673
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,767
Now you be here before
the end of business Tuesday

674
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,291
and sign those papers.

675
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,563
And bid this town
a fond farewell

676
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,765

consequences.

677
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,520
Well, I ain't gonna just
sit here pretending

678
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,321
that you and I have ever
seen eye to eye on, well...

679
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,488
pretty much anything.

Reason I ain't coming here

is because I don't think
I deserve it.

682
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,325
But I would be mighty grateful
if you could make my purpose

683
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,410
a little more clear to me.

684
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:45,166

I was just drifting.

Town to town.

686
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,361

place called Norton,

01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,131
way over in Kansas.

688
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,685
Been riding hard, went in
the saloon for a drink.

689
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,689
Two men come up on me
looking for a fight,

690
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,168
so I gave it to 'em.

691
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,241
Cut one of 'em up pretty bad,
outdrew on the other.

692
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,682
Told him to pick up
his partner and get.

693
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,561
All I had to do
was leave that town.

694
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,126
But I didn't.

695
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,448
I waited.

696
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,719
Daring 'em to come after me.

697
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,328
And sure enough,
when I walked outside

698
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,286
those two young men
started firing on me.

699
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:40,604
Shot out my horse. I drew
my pistol. I fired back.

700
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,770
I killed them.
I killed them both.

701
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,685
In the middle of all of it
one of my shots went wide,

702
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,967
straight through
a storefront window.

703
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,405
Woman came out screaming,

704
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,285
covered in blood.

705
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,726
First I thought I'd shot her.

706
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,445
Then her husband come out...

707
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,081
carrying a little boy.

708
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,765
I killed a boy, Pop.

709
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,286
He looked to be
the same age as William.

710
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,971
He just lay there dead
'cause of what I'd done.

711
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,969
Just like William did.

712
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,969
William didn't die
because of you.

713

01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,801
Men from far and wide are

893
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,160
gonna come looking for me to
make a name for themselves.

894
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:37,769
Don't go away. I can't
finish the field on my own.

895
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,690
The field's finished, Pa.
I seeded it

896
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,531
It'll take care of itself.

897
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,959
<i>I</i> gotta go.

898
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,804
You're not going for
another 10 years, are you?

899
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,440
No, I promise.

900
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,688
See you soon, Pa.

901
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,846
<i>MALE NARRATOR:
Little is known</i>

902
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,007
<i>of him after that.</i>

903
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,441
<i>Some say he drifted down
to Coffeeville</i>

904
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,723
<i>where he was involved
in another altercation</i>

905
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,999
<i>a few years later.</i>

906
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,322
<i>But those accusations
were never proven.</i>

907
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,330
<i>The common view was
he moved westward</i>

908
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,329
<i>under a different name,</i>

909
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:37,331
<i>where he lived</i> a <i>life
of quiet isolation.</i>

910
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,330
<i>What is known is that
when Mary Alice died</i>

911
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:48,286
a <i>few years later, he did not
attend her funeral.</i>

912
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:52,086
<i>However, many say
the following day,</i>

913
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:57,127
<i>a faded red ribbon was found
attached to her headstone.</i>

914
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,965
<i>Others in Fowler recounted
stories of seeing him</i>

915
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,210
<i>throughout the years
up until his father's death,</i>

916
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,086
<i>at which time he came no more.</i>
