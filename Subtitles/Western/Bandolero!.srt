00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,911
Excuse me.

500
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,879
Mace, if you're ever alone
with Pop and his little boy...

501
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,713
...don't you turn your back on them.
- I know.

502
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,269
I can't decide which of us
they hate the most.

503
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,597
- Oh, it's you.
- I think you're right.

504
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,875
Mace, I ain't had a chance to tell you,
but it sure is real good to see you again.

505
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,113
And sometimes I think back
to how it used to be with you and me.

506
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,716
- You remember when...?
- Dee, that was yesterday.

507
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,957
Now, let's talk about today.

508
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,317
All right. What about today?

509
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,950
Now, why do you ride
with men like these?

510
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,195
Oh, I don't know. I just got used to it,
I guess, through the years.

511
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,750
You know, you begin to go one way
and keep on going that way...

512
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,115
...pretty soon, there's no other way.

513
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,675
You really believe that?

514
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,358
No, I guess not.

515
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,670
BABE: You sure are pretty.
- Pretty.

516
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,997
A pretty woman ain't good
for nothing but smelling sweet...

517
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,469
...and laying around the house.

518
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,273
Just so pretty.

519
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,359
Is it after a little kiss you are, Babe?
Oh, he's a great kisser, ma'am.

520
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,318
He's the best damn lady-kisser
in the whole of Texas.

[MEN LAUGHING]

522
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,156

00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,679
Oh...

524
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,389
Hell, he wouldn't harm a hair
on her head, laddie.

525
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,479
She's a lady. Treat her like one.

00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,190
It's time you got some sleep.

527
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,754
How far are we going, July?

528
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,797
I mean, are we just gonna...

529
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,633
...keep following them
till we come up on them...

530
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,711
...or what?
No matter how far they go?

531
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,552
That's right.

532
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,029
Suppose they just keep
going on forever?

533
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,555
Then we'll just keep going on forever.

534
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,711
What if we lose them?

535
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,998
There's only a couple of places
they could be headed.

00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,754
There's only a couple of places
with water.

537
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,115
I won't lose them.

538
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,236

- What don't make sense, Hawkins?
- We've come too far already.

dead most likely, if we keep going.

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,234
You wanna turn back?

544
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,313
Wanting ain't part of it.
I'm turning back.

545
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,710

Hey! Wait up there! Wait for me!

554
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,352
What are you hurrying so for? That sheriff
can't go any faster than we can.

555
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,238
Are you giving out, Pop?

556
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,315
Oh, it's just that I don't see no sense
in hurrying, that's all.

in the goodness of his fellow man.

He's never seen it,
but he believes in it.

01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,910

- I believe in myself.

don't you, Dee?

565
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,314
- You don't understand.
- No?

566
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,631

having to scrape for a living?

01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,109
I could tell you a lot
about the hard life...

...but you'd have to live it
to understand it.

01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,478

- All of us.

- I'll find them.

01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,229
Do you know how big this country is?
Why, it just swallowed them up.

- For all we know, they...
- Now, who's missing?

577

ride back home if you want to.

585
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,711
Stay where you are.
You wouldn't recognize him anyway.

586
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,151
I reckon the other one's
around here somewhere.

587
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,950
- The Indians, July?
- No, bandits.

588
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,157
If you wanna ride for home,
you leave right now from here.

589
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:52,108
I'll understand. I'll tell the others
I sent you home to report.

590
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,199
I'll stay with you, July.

591
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,239
Now, you don't have to.
I just want you to know that.

592

No, I'll stick.

593
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,550

594
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,508
"Did you ride all over Mexico
with July Johnson?"

595
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,114
I can say to him, "Yep...

596
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,033
...I rode all over Mexico
with July Johnson."

597
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,669

- Now, none of your lip.

...and pick his nose. Yes, sir.

and it stood me in good stead.

ever mentioned...

- Yeah, liars always start that way.

...gotten me anyplace.

01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,549
But go ahead. Tell me what you wanna
talk about, maybe I'll join you.

624
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,554
All right. I wanna talk about us
having a place of our own.

625

How's that sound to you?

626
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,111

I can remember back to a time...

628

...you wanted a place
of your own awful bad.

about a good woman.

I been with a woman I could respect?

I may not be good, but I sure do know
what good's supposed to be.

634
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,669
We were young enough back in
those days to think about children.

They're not lost to you, Dee.
They're not lost.

638
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,590

away. They're not lost to you.

Honest, Dee, I wasn't gonna do
nothing but kiss her.

643
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,954
Well, what's wrong
with a little old kiss?

644
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:54,032
Ain't nothing wrong
with a little old kiss, Dee.

645
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,634
A little old kiss never hurt nobody.

646

From now on, you and me are gonna be

He is, but that don't make him
any less disgusting.

651
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,877
Matter of fact,
all my friends are disgusting.

652
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,917
You take Pop, for instance.

653
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,958
He was due to be shot
the day he was born.

654
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:06,033
And that heart of his is nothing
but a festering sore.

655

His kid, he's something, ain't he?

656
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,549
If you feel that way about them,
why are you with them?

I've never known
where respectable people stood.

I reckon he's got you
all to himself now.

664
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,909
He's a good man,
but I feel nothing for him.

665
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,993
[CHUCKLES]

666
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,631
Why do you laugh?

667
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:50,352
I was just thinking. We'd make
a perfect pair, you and me.

668
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,318
I'm broke, without a woman...

669
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,358
...and you're rich and without a man.

670
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:47,272
- This ain't Sabinas, is it, laddie?
- Is this what you brung us to?

671
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,876
DEE: This is the town.
MACE: Why, it's a ghost.

672
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,591
DEE: Looks that way, Mace.
Sure does look that way.

673
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,668
MACE: A lot of horses
through here lately, Dee.

674
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,152
Maybe not more than a day or so.

675
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,314
Mostly barefoot.

676
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,395
This is your country. What do you
think happened to these people?

677
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,913
Bandoleros.

678
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,715
They demand too much of the people.

679
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,440
When they grow tired
of being raided, they leave.

680
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,079
As they have done here.

681
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,198
You mean to say a whole town
just packs up and leaves...

682
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,679
...and never comes back?

683
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,070
Well, sometimes
they go to a larger town...

684
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,755
...where they can be protected
by the soldiers of Benito Juarez.

685
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,040
Mace, we'll put up over in that cantina.
That's the best place around.

686
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,795
What do you plan on doing now, Dee?

687
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,158
Well, I'll just rest up here
a few days...

688
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:16,836
...ride on to Hidalgo for supplies
and push on to Matamoros.

689
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,560
I got friends in Matamoros.

690
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,359
Well, what about Mrs. Stoner?

691
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,875
Mace, you think we could
make a go of it in Montana?

692
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,396
Dee, there's a town up there
called Missoula.

693
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,438
- Prettiest place you ever saw.
- What about the Indians?

694
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,195
And the Rockies, they're snowcapped,
and the slopes are forested...

695
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,557
...and there are lots of lakes and...
- What about the Indians?

696
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,551
And there's deer in Montana, Dee.

697
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,278
And antelope and elk...

698
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,876
- Mace, what about the Indians?
...and black bear and...

699
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,712
What Indians?

700
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,633
Ain't there no Indians in Montana?

701
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,758
Well, a few.

702
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,195
Ain't there Northern Cheyenne
in Montana?

703
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:05,875
The Northern...
Well, the Northern Cheyenne...

704
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,396
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- The Crow and the Sioux?

705
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,154
- Well, they're around.
- What else, Mace?

706
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,749
- Listen, Dee...
- What else?

707
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,515
Well, the Blackfeet...

708
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,433
...and Chippewa.
- Some Cree?

709
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,870
Yes. Yes, there are Cree in Montana.

710
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,038
And the Shoshone and the Kootenai
and the Stoney.

711
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,077
Just what are you trying to say?

712
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,239
I'm trying to say there's a lot of
goddamn Indians in Montana, Mace.

713
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,154
- You're impossible to talk to.
- Wait a minute.

714
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,311
Will you sit down, Mace?

715
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,510
I'm tired, Mace. Bone-tired.

716
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,195
I can't even remember what it feels like
to get up in the morning...

717
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,432
...feeling rested and clean,
having a good breakfast.

718
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,556
I can't remember
what it feels like...

719
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,992
...to slip down in between
some cool, clean sheets.

720
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,596
Mace, we'll need money.
Have you thought about that?

721
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,911
I think I know where I can get
my hands on some.

722
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,310
Your brother won't never make it.

723
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,391
There's only one way for him...

724
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,235
...for me, for any of us.

725
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,588
MACE:
Well, what way is that, Mr. Chaney?

726
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,070
This way. The way we know.

727
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,674
The way we growed.

728
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,833
Well, now, that may be so for you,
but for my brother, it's different.

729
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,958
I don't care if he is your brother.
The son of a bitch...

730
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,476
Now...

731
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,630
...before you apologize, I'm gonna
tell you something, Mr. Chaney.

732
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,475
My brother and I are the sons
of an honest dirt farmer.

733
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,638
A man who slaved all his life
from sunup to sundown...

734
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,712
...and never took time
except to deliver his children...

735
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,192
...and go to meeting on Sunday.
A man who died of old age at 45...

736
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,512
...and who never saw more than
$ 10 at one time in his whole life.

737
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,877
We're the sons of a woman
that married him for his goodness...

738
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,031
...because she was good!

739
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,239
And now you can apologize
for slandering my family, Mr. Chaney.

740
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,233
I'll blow your head off.

741
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,398
You ain't no killer.
You ain't got the stomach for it.

742
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,994
Apologize!

743
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,831
I'm sorry, Mr. Bishop.

744
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,912
I didn't mean no harm.

745
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,159
I'm going outside, Dee.

746
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,279
I'd appreciate it if you see
I don't get shot in the back.

747
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,638
- July?
- Mmm?

748
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,108
What if she won't have you?

749
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,472
Why shouldn't she have me?

750
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:26,589
Well, I don't know.
It's just, she might not want you.

751
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,589
You trying to tell me something, Roscoe?

752
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,796
No, July, it's just...

753
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,599
Well, because you want her
doesn't mean that...

754
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,593
...she's gotta want you right back.

755
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,877
Does it?

756
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,877
I don't wanna talk about it.

757
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,118
- Why?
- What?

758
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,477
- Why don't you wanna talk about it?
- Roscoe, I just don't.

759
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:56,315
Now, Roscoe, you been
a good boy all of these years.

760
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,239
Now, don't spoil it.

761
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,159
Who's standing guard?

762
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,990
Jeeters.

763
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:16,711
Well, I reckon I'll go spell him.

764
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,792
MACE: Well, there's another one'll
never make it to Matamoros.

765
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,918
DEE: How many does that make?
- Three.

766
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:18,835
Looks to me like we'll be
mostly walking when we leave.

767
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,912
You two have gotten pretty close,
haven't you?

768
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:30,232
- Nothing's been said.
- Well, nothing has to be said.

769
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:34,393
It's just a feeling, Mace.
You know, it's just a feeling, but...

770
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,437
But what?

771
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,433
I don't know if she has
the same feeling.

772
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,239
Have you thought about asking her?

773
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,789
- Asking?
- Dee...

774
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,315
...I know you don't believe in talking...

775
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,438
...and you've said that talking
never got you anywhere...

776
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,273
...but how are you ever gonna
find out anything...

777
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,637
...from anybody if you don't talk?

778
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,353
There will be coffee soon.

779
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,189
- I wanna ask you something.
- Yes?

780
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,875
I know I've done you real wrong...

781
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,708
...and even if I wanted...

782
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,872
...it's kind of late for apologizing.

783
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,359
I know there's no reason
in this whole world...

784
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,671
...why you wouldn't like to
step on something like me...

785
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:41,108
...but do you think you could ever
take to a man who...

786
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:45,990
...dragged you from your home
and done you the way I done you?

787
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,833
Well, I'll be damned.

788
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,276
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.

789
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,715
Oh, well, you two are gonna be
very happy.

790
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,472
Mace, what'd she mean by that?

791
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,552
She just looked at me, hugged me.
Didn't say nothing.

792
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,199
Oh, boy.

793
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:26,194
Oh, you're a sorry...
Dee, you're so dumb.

794
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,998
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

795
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:32,199
- How'd you like a knock in your teeth?
- No, listen to me, Dee.

796
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,033
Do you wanna go up to Montana
with me or don't you?

797
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,873
Do you wanna help me build
our spread up there?

798
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,793
- I reckon, yeah.
- And the children, what about them?

799
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,871
- What children?
- Children of your own.

800
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,270
The ones you used to want.
What about them?

801
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,079
And her? Do you want her
to go with you to Montana?

802
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,471
- It'd be right nice, yeah.
- Well, then go and tell her.

803
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:56,111
You're right. That's right, Mace.
Now, why didn't I think of that?

804
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,197
ROSCOE:
Bishop, close the door.

805
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,991
Come on in.

806
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,914
All right, tell them it's over, Roscoe.

807
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,516
Now, just so we understand
one another...

808
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,831
...you make one move
I don't like, and I'll kill you.

809
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,594
Now, what's your real name?

810
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,548
- Mace Bishop.
- Bishop. You're brothers.

811
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,234
You hear that, Roscoe?
They're brothers.

812
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:07,792
All right, brothers.
Where'd you hide the bank money?

813
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:12,112
- What bank money?
- Oh, it's gonna be that way, is it?

814
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:18,150
The $ 10,000 your brother there
took out of the Val Verde Bank.

815
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:21,955
$ 10,000 that he helped himself to
when the rest of you lit out.

816
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,628
That's what bank money.

817
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,236
You robbed a bank? You, Mace?

818
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,994
Well, Dee, the bank was there...

819
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:35,517
...and I was there, and there wasn't
very much of anybody else there...

820
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,752
...and it just seemed like
the thing to do.

821
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,390
You know, it's not like
something you never heard of.

822
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:49,428
Lot of people rob banks
for all sorts of different reasons.

823
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,797
You just walked into a bank
and helped yourself to $ 10,000...

824
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,349
...because it seemed like
the thing to do?

825
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:00,719
That's about the way it was, yeah.
That's as well as I can remember, yeah.

826
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,792
I don't know what to say to you.

Well, just don't say anything, Dee.
Don't say a word.

Why, you old bastard.

Just a thought, Dee. Just a thought.

Well, I'm sure glad Mama
ain't around to hear all this.

Well, I sure wish Papa
was around to hear all this.

Wouldn't it be wonderful to see
$ 10,000 in Papa's hands?

836

$ 10,000 in the hands of a man...

837
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,956
...that didn't know there was that
much money in the whole world.
